WEBVTT

00:00.309 --> 00:01.350
Let's try that again.

00:04.654 --> 00:07.576
Hopefully I have everything on now.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.598
I don't know if I have this camera on.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.220
I think that one's on now.

00:14.643 --> 00:18.988
Sorry, I didn't have YouTube ready to go and I want that to stream as well.

00:19.768 --> 00:22.691
So if you have any chance to go over there and check that out.

00:25.382 --> 00:28.045
and just see if YouTube is live for me, that would be great.

00:28.065 --> 00:29.186
You don't have to watch there.

00:29.206 --> 00:32.570
But I just want to see if I'm tapping into new viewers there.

00:32.630 --> 00:42.180
Ladies and gentlemen, again, once again, I'm going to start over with this is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.361
It's the 20th of February 2025.

00:45.827 --> 00:49.715
You're probably watching me live if you're watching on the 20th of February.

00:49.915 --> 00:52.440
Biology is the way, life is a pattern, integrity.

00:52.741 --> 00:55.707
And if you want to be notified of the stream starting next week,

00:57.368 --> 01:05.997
Please follow the directions there by sending an email to gigaohmhq at proton.me with notify me in the subject.

01:06.017 --> 01:09.921
You can also go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a button that'll do the same thing.

01:11.002 --> 01:19.390
If you're here for the first time you're hearing the voice of Jonathan Cooey and you can check my work as an academic by going to the National Library of Medicine's website PubMed.

01:20.151 --> 01:24.794
And enter in the last name C-O-U-E-Y and the first name J-J.

01:25.154 --> 01:26.195
First letters, I guess.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.457
And that should be all you need to do.

01:29.978 --> 01:30.998
I'll see you in a few seconds.

01:31.078 --> 01:32.940
It's probably about a five minute intro today.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.381
Thank you very much for checking YouTube, guys.

01:35.761 --> 01:36.782
And I'll see you in a minute.

01:39.144 --> 01:40.985
Shouldn't just be a few people that are leaders.

01:41.045 --> 01:43.967
Everybody has to figure out their own leader inside themselves.

01:44.389 --> 01:51.015
If they're too shy to go approach somebody in person, then stick a card or a flyer on someone's car next to you every time you park your car.

01:51.355 --> 01:56.600
Stick a card inside of a gas station credit card slot every time you get gas.

01:56.660 --> 02:06.029
If everybody that is aware of the truth and awake to the truth started to do these things, we can touch people, the hearts and minds of people, one person at a time,

02:06.562 --> 02:07.523
in day-to-day living.

02:07.543 --> 02:12.988
We don't need these echo chambers online where we're all repeating to the same followers most of the time.

02:13.328 --> 02:20.875
We get a few new people, but I think we really need more people to take what they're learning and get out there and touch the people that they're in a community with.

02:21.175 --> 02:32.986
By about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

02:33.539 --> 02:37.273
the greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

02:39.511 --> 02:55.883
But the GN1 is very, very alarming because the mutations are no longer restricted to spike protein, which indicates enhanced activity of CTLs to diminish viral infectiousness.

02:56.684 --> 03:06.752
And that CTL activity is responsible for the decline of T cells that in fact boost the non-neutralizing antibodies that prevent virulence.

03:07.472 --> 03:30.641
So that is what I've been predicting all the time, that ultimately this evolution would inevitably lead to the emergence of a highly virulent variant that would cause waves of hospitalization and severe disease in highly vaccinated countries.

03:30.781 --> 03:35.423
Of course, always the same, only in highly vaccinated countries, right?

03:36.920 --> 03:37.280
So that's a relief.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.321
It's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

03:38.341 --> 03:40.583
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:40.603 --> 03:43.206
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:43.226 --> 03:45.368
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.430
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:47.450 --> 03:49.512
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:49.532 --> 03:51.554
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:51.574 --> 03:53.536
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:53.556 --> 03:55.678
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.220
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:58.260 --> 04:01.123
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:01.143 --> 04:02.184
I'm afraid that the latest data tells

04:03.934 --> 04:04.675
And I have lied.

04:04.835 --> 04:05.715
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:05.736 --> 04:06.656
I don't want to lie.

04:07.157 --> 04:08.498
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:08.598 --> 04:09.639
I try not to be a liar.

04:09.659 --> 04:10.519
I don't want to be a liar.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.842
I think it's like, really important not to be a liar.

04:16.084 --> 04:21.248
Specializations should make you suspicious, because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.810
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

04:25.251 --> 04:27.212
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

04:27.232 --> 04:30.355
And that's, that's, that's sort of my starting my starting bias.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.789
the question about pandemic.

04:36.669 --> 04:43.812
And Stephen, your immunology professor said, very good, because the question was very good.

04:44.592 --> 04:55.316
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

04:56.016 --> 04:56.136
And

04:59.159 --> 05:02.483
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.164
It can't.

05:03.785 --> 05:07.509
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

05:07.529 --> 05:12.575
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

05:18.925 --> 05:22.909
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.691
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

05:24.731 --> 05:25.392
Thank you very much.

05:25.452 --> 05:26.653
Can you hear me better now or not?

05:26.994 --> 05:27.895
Yes, much better.

05:28.616 --> 05:37.085
It was really like, it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

05:37.365 --> 05:40.909
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

05:41.209 --> 05:46.311
It aligns so well with the fact that I don't think anybody has been wrong so far.

05:46.471 --> 05:52.554
It's just nobody had a complete picture and this kind of suits all of these things.

05:52.754 --> 06:00.798
There was a misinterpretation of the real question that was being asked and what people really wanted to know is this SARS-2 thing a virus?

06:01.038 --> 06:04.620
That's the real question, not whether or not viruses exist in general.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.101
I mean, I think that just got mixed up too much.

06:07.121 --> 06:08.741
They get mixed up in there indeed.

06:08.921 --> 06:11.883
And I think that people get, yeah, they get swept away in that.

06:12.343 --> 06:21.447
And it's a very much more, I think the people that are actually misrepresenting the no virus angle, and I do believe there are people that are doing it.

06:21.807 --> 06:24.868
are purposefully not curious about what happened.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.570
They're just sure that what they say didn't happen.

06:27.610 --> 06:29.691
And that part of it really bothers me.

06:29.731 --> 06:30.831
It drives me bananas.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.613
And it's the reason why I don't think it makes complete sense.

06:33.733 --> 06:38.695
That's a perfect segue, by the way, to go to JJ's ideas about the infectious clones.

06:38.755 --> 06:42.577
I mean, it's a fascinating idea, and it makes so much sense.

06:42.937 --> 06:47.559
It gives credence to the they did it on purpose as a biological weapon idea.

06:47.799 --> 06:48.860
You want to go JJ?

06:48.960 --> 06:49.721
Yes, thank you.

06:49.801 --> 06:50.141
I'll go.

06:50.301 --> 06:57.828
So I've been active like a lot of these, these humans, um, and trying to get the word out about basic biology.

06:58.929 --> 07:12.721
And, um, I've been kind of focused on learning the immunology again, um, after having learned it as an undergraduate, as a grad student and trying to figure out where the line of fidelity in virology is really drawn.

07:13.970 --> 07:23.194
And after about a year and a half of this struggle, I had my path cross the path of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

07:23.414 --> 07:28.696
And so since then I've been a scientific advisor for him behind the scenes.

07:29.356 --> 07:38.960
And a lot of my recent work has been spurred by questions and specifically questions about what does, what is an infectious clone?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.461
What do they mean when they say this?

07:41.905 --> 07:44.308
was a question that was posed to me by Bobby.

07:44.528 --> 08:00.403
And over the course of trying to figure out what the implications of this methodology were, I've come to realize that I think it's possible that there are more smoke and mirrors than anybody wants to really admit.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.996
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

08:11.096 --> 08:16.400
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

08:17.261 --> 08:24.026
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

08:24.046 --> 08:34.014
Let me introduce.

08:35.134 --> 08:53.648
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:53.668 --> 09:03.236
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

09:08.806 --> 09:29.621
I don't care how you get there.

09:29.641 --> 09:32.323
I don't care what you do to get there.

09:32.343 --> 09:34.905
The goal is to win.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.521
What time is it?

09:40.581 --> 09:41.341
Game time!

09:41.422 --> 09:41.682
Woo!

09:47.707 --> 09:50.889
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, everybody.

09:50.989 --> 09:51.870
Welcome to the show.

09:51.910 --> 09:53.471
This is GigaOM Biological.

09:54.272 --> 10:02.598
What a long, strange trip it's been from the truckers all the way to NIH Director and Health and Human Services Secretary.

10:02.639 --> 10:03.739
Very exciting days.

10:04.900 --> 10:09.402
but we are under an enchantment that can only be dispelled by each of us learning biology.

10:10.082 --> 10:14.824
It sounds weird, but actually that's the truth as far as I can see it.

10:15.584 --> 10:19.266
We all have work to do, we all have reading to do, we all have exercise to do.

10:19.286 --> 10:24.408
We're gonna need to catch up because we have been bamboozled for quite some time.

10:24.448 --> 10:26.769
We inherited these charlatans from our parents.

10:27.569 --> 10:35.452
And it's our consciousness, all occupied by their social media apps, that has really made our consciousness their prime real estate.

10:36.112 --> 10:41.914
Where it's not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

10:42.474 --> 10:51.117
And since all those images that are scrolling past our thumb are their images, this den of vipers and thieves is getting away with murder.

10:51.857 --> 10:54.038
They've already been in control of our money.

10:55.178 --> 10:56.900
for a few generations.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.384
Now, they're in control of our minds because we're not reading books anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

11:02.404 --> 11:04.805
We're not learning our history anymore.

11:04.845 --> 11:06.487
That's really the issue here.

11:07.287 --> 11:11.810
And I think there are a few people in America and around the world who are trying to fix that problem.

11:12.251 --> 11:15.053
I think Mark Kulak out of Boston, Massachusetts is one.

11:15.093 --> 11:16.394
That's Housatonic Live.

11:17.434 --> 11:22.018
I think another one out of Northern or somewhere in New York, I believe,

11:22.918 --> 11:25.300
In the Woods is The Liberty Perspective.

11:25.340 --> 11:29.463
That's Joe Marshall with a book called The Last Call for Liberty.

11:30.624 --> 11:44.693
There's also, of course, Grace's dad, Scott Schara, whose case is going to be very important for establishing a lot of precedence about doctors being culpable in the death of their patients.

11:44.753 --> 11:50.797
And finally, my international friend, Uwe Altschner, who works hard on Substack, who I met through our

11:52.638 --> 11:54.939
collaboration in CHD.

11:55.799 --> 12:00.121
He writes a great substack, plugs my work a lot, and I'm very grateful for that.

12:00.501 --> 12:04.903
He recently published a radio podcast, which was just phenomenal.

12:04.923 --> 12:08.284
It was nuts to hear myself on a German radio broadcast.

12:08.324 --> 12:10.065
Thank you very much for that, Mr. Ulsner.

12:11.105 --> 12:18.408
This is a crazy time, ladies and gentlemen, because this illusion that we thought we saw before the pandemic is still going.

12:19.363 --> 12:24.988
But it's now being maintained by all these new organizations that have come up.

12:25.028 --> 12:29.232
You know, before the pandemic, there was just ICANN and CHD.

12:30.313 --> 12:32.295
And barely anybody knew who the heck they were.

12:34.016 --> 12:35.658
And then now we have this.

12:36.899 --> 12:38.300
And it's really...

12:39.788 --> 12:55.556
an incredible place where we are because I think that the manipulation of us as citizenry is now more exposed than ever because they have overextended themselves on social media with these people and they are relying on us.

12:56.736 --> 12:57.698
not to check out.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.183
They are relying on us not to see the big picture.

13:01.804 --> 13:12.379
The big picture of world population, the big picture of the limits of animal experimentation, the limits of what they can do without our data.

13:13.860 --> 13:19.944
And their plans need us to be attached to their networks so that they can collect our data all the time.

13:20.424 --> 13:26.107
Not only to manipulate the habits and opinions of us, but also to harness our medical data.

13:26.347 --> 13:26.827
It's both.

13:27.968 --> 13:37.853
It is an all-encompassing plan to create a no-sphere by which the average masses can be told what to believe.

13:38.939 --> 13:50.671
And I think that they are told what to believe by the curation of a very, very lively debate within a limited spectrum that reinforces the presuppositions of the system all the time.

13:51.251 --> 13:55.215
And I think what they've done is they stick to a spectacular script.

13:56.021 --> 14:04.846
that they all have privy to, that they all know what the red lines are, and they are all talking points that they're told to stick to.

14:05.826 --> 14:23.356
Some of the people that have been in this narrative have been in the narrative as long as their minor daughters have been producing content for the dry run of this narrative that probably started in 2017 or 18, when people were starting to be put in place like Bret Weinstein,

14:24.176 --> 14:35.424
like the mother of Soph's daughter, Soph, and like many of these other people that were put in place in the intellectual dark web in 2018 and 19.

14:38.296 --> 14:42.677
You just see that people are being pulled off of the same bench all the time.

14:43.518 --> 14:45.598
And you see that their rhetoric is always the same.

14:45.658 --> 14:51.540
I mean, Bret Weinstein saying that this is potentially the end of the West is not a patriotic statement.

14:51.700 --> 15:04.064
And so often, Bret Weinstein is unable to identify as an American fighting for America within an American system, but instead is always talking about the World Health Organization and the UN and the globe.

15:05.279 --> 15:15.763
And that kind of nonsense is an admission just the same as the admissions that Kevin McKernan has been making for five years straight that only followers of me can see, not the followers of him.

15:16.844 --> 15:19.725
Because again, Twitter and X, these are all phantoms.

15:20.605 --> 15:22.806
What you see is not what everybody else sees.

15:24.087 --> 15:25.107
And these people know it.

15:25.147 --> 15:32.030
They work together and they are spectacularly committed to this lie and coordinating it between one another.

15:33.190 --> 15:55.024
I think that Kevin McKernan is probably one of the ringleaders of the narrative control team and that's why he makes ridiculous statements and ridiculous tweets with the confidence of knowing that no one in mainstream media who he's ever going to be exposed to is going to follow up usefully and probably can't even follow up usefully because of the nature of social media.

15:56.414 --> 16:02.155
The reality is that these people still need us to teach our children that gain of function is real.

16:02.635 --> 16:06.056
They still need our science teachers to adopt this idea.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.276
And so we still have a chance to stop them.

16:08.296 --> 16:20.199
The animals in the farm still have a chance to wake up if we can figure out what common sense meant before the pandemic and start using it again, if we can engage in non-compliance.

16:21.199 --> 16:31.173
That's really the trick, is teaching parents how to engage in non-compliance and be able to argue back against the nurse and the doctor or to find a better doctor.

16:31.954 --> 16:36.520
And that is a network that we need to create indeed, but I don't see a lot of people trying to do that.

16:38.290 --> 16:48.180
We need to probably speak to college kids and give them this message that actually their parents are responsible for the trap that they're in.

16:48.240 --> 16:55.787
They would have never gone back to college if their parents would have given them the right advice, if their doctors would have given them the right advice, and we need

16:56.678 --> 17:02.623
Grace's dad, we need Grace's dad's lawsuit to win because again, we need doctors to be held accountable.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.727
They cannot be allowed to say that it was just what they were told to do.

17:08.008 --> 17:10.510
And that's the way we do that is learning the biology.

17:10.530 --> 17:15.234
The way that we do that is really learning the biology.

17:17.608 --> 17:23.594
and the history of it, the history of these ideas, the history of people who curated these ideas, who propagated them.

17:23.995 --> 17:28.159
Because once we give power to a charlatan, you almost never get it back.

17:29.100 --> 17:33.045
And this time, I want it to be different for my kids and for yours.

17:33.105 --> 17:34.987
This time, I want it to be different.

17:36.655 --> 17:44.540
And I think it could be because I do think that this narrative and the biology, the mythology is overextended on social media right now.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.563
It's just a question of whether we can get ahead of them, whether we can get ahead of learning this stuff.

17:49.603 --> 17:50.563
And I think there is hope.

17:51.784 --> 18:03.891
I think there's hope that we can teach high school biology online in a way that kids will go off to college knowing the illusion that all of these people bought into, that the deans of their colleges bought into.

18:05.166 --> 18:15.714
and they will start to pursue a line of truth, a line that is motivated by love, and start to spread the truth to others.

18:16.214 --> 18:25.281
If we could get college kids to understand that intramuscular injection is dumb, that transfection was always criminal, and that RNA cannot pandemic, that we could get college kids to understand that the U.S.

18:25.321 --> 18:33.267
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise, and maybe many of the chronic diseases that they have that their parents don't have are a result of it.

18:36.590 --> 18:37.213
Let's see.

18:37.233 --> 18:37.333
Click.

18:37.655 --> 18:37.896
Click.

18:40.909 --> 18:42.850
Thank you very much for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.

18:42.870 --> 18:47.891
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.892
Just try to fade that out as awkwardly as possible here.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.312
Thank you very much for joining me.

18:53.372 --> 18:54.592
It's the 20th of February, 2020.

18:55.352 --> 18:59.213
We are here again for another news brief.

19:00.053 --> 19:02.434
Today I have a very specific message in mind.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.194
Yesterday I fuddled around a little bit.

19:04.234 --> 19:05.995
I got discombobulated by the

19:06.935 --> 19:10.098
by the communications with the chat, and I apologize for that.

19:10.178 --> 19:16.002
Sometimes I get a little riled up because I think that certainty makes me mad.

19:16.543 --> 19:20.246
I think when people imply certainty, I get upset.

19:21.187 --> 19:35.038
When people imply that I'm being certain or that I'm being misled, I get upset because I guess I feel like after five years of being misled and being the one who's regularly online, on air,

19:35.698 --> 20:03.848
Confessing to being misled the last thing I need to do is to be told in the chat that I'm being misled It's it's one of those things that comes with the territory You know the more people you have whispering in your ear the more likely you are to be misled And I think that's a that's a good rule that in general for me has worked out really well and so again I apologize for getting upset, but you know this is high-pressure stuff and

20:03.948 --> 20:07.832
My old boss is now HHS secretary.

20:07.872 --> 20:18.682
And so things are a little goofy, but I'm trying to project a message of hope that is not for everyone, but for anyone about the truth of the biology of pandemics and vaccination.

20:18.862 --> 20:23.366
And the fact of the matter is, is that none of these ideas and concepts are mine.

20:23.406 --> 20:26.209
These are all things that I found lying on the floor.

20:27.441 --> 20:31.326
and discarded by the people who are leading the charge here.

20:32.007 --> 20:41.178
And I think an important message to bring today is that the United States of America, if we are led by charlatans, we will never escape the trap.

20:41.738 --> 20:44.361
And unfortunately, we are being led by charlatans.

20:45.703 --> 20:55.812
The consequences of that may not be completely obvious to you if indeed you are still, for the most part, skillfully using social media to try and solve your way out.

20:55.852 --> 21:01.778
Because in that case, you're not aware of how close you are to the trap actually closing.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.243
Now, you still don't really know what I'm talking about, but I'll get there.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.873
All the marbles, that's what it's about.

21:10.013 --> 21:11.614
It's about the grandchildren of earth.

21:11.674 --> 21:18.379
So they don't even, they're already kind of have our kids because our kids already have social media accounts.

21:19.039 --> 21:24.162
Our kids that we sent off to college are already in their grasp.

21:24.262 --> 21:32.928
And so this is really about our grandchildren and we need to wake up our children that it's about our grandchildren so that they're aware.

21:34.636 --> 22:01.711
Because if we don't start teaching our kids to think on longer time horizons than a few weeks, then the same stunt that has happened that has pushed the trucker protests so far into our past already, that we can barely remember what year it happened in, to where we won't be able to sort out our own history logically and understand that we were lied to.

22:03.061 --> 22:04.422
lied to by these people.

22:07.204 --> 22:19.995
Now, what I am proposing, if you're here for the first time, is that weaponized piles of money, and there are a lot of them, and the older the pile of money is, the more likely it is to be giant and weaponized against us.

22:21.656 --> 22:24.018
Think Dutch East Indies Company, you know what I mean?

22:24.098 --> 22:26.200
Think Vatican, think that old.

22:27.847 --> 22:38.700
The overclass have placed and have always placed highly trained acolytes in positions of power to manipulate the habits and opinions of the citizenry in order to govern them.

22:39.521 --> 22:43.867
And that allows them to make us believe in almost anything.

22:45.692 --> 23:11.843
And although this has been going on for generations, it is never before in the history of humankind that a combination of technology and connectivity has allowed the extensive bamboozlement of almost an entire world population into believing a whole set of myths about their history and about their biology and about religion and about spirituality that are all wrong.

23:14.156 --> 23:38.224
And now we're at the sort of exponential of where this change is going to happen as rapidly as our controllers want it to happen because we have fully acquiesced as a population to using social media as a tool to communicate and thinking that this is a great kind of town square plus.

23:39.284 --> 23:42.165
And that's absolutely, absolutely, absolutely

23:45.356 --> 23:45.916
That's wrong.

23:47.397 --> 24:11.905
And in this case, in the last five years, they have used the last five years to bamboozle us into not realizing that PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool to not ever come to the realization that your aunt or your mom or dad that was put on supplementary oxygen at the hospital probably progressed to pneumonia or to ARDS because of that oxygen.

24:14.127 --> 24:23.852
And so everybody needs to look at what happened to their relatives that died in hospitals during COVID, especially 2020, 21, 22, because that's what happened to Grace and many others.

24:25.413 --> 24:31.717
Not using antibiotics for pneumonia is a crime and any doctor worth their salt should know that.

24:31.757 --> 24:41.162
And this happened in spades as is illustrated in this graph where we have control of pneumonia for decades and then lose control of it for about two and a half years.

24:46.587 --> 24:56.256
And so it is a long strange trip where Team Worst Case Scenario has accomplished something for our slavers that previous generations have not been able to accomplish.

24:56.376 --> 25:06.765
Also because there wasn't really the time, the computer technology, the storage technology, the AI, the machine learning algorithms didn't exist.

25:08.251 --> 25:10.352
but now they are starting to exist.

25:10.412 --> 25:26.824
And so now we can build the infrastructure that's necessary to collect and store and homogenize the genetic data of as many people as possible and start to use the computing power that we've developed to try to apply machine learning algorithms to the human genome.

25:26.864 --> 25:32.848
But that's not a task like equivalent to applying machine algorithms to go.

25:36.479 --> 25:51.566
because Go is a set number of squares with a set number of stones that only have two possible states, and it was considered to be a crazy accomplishment.

25:52.707 --> 26:00.971
Now imagine that you have a human genome that could have millions of bases with four settings each.

26:01.994 --> 26:09.473
And now tell me how long it's going to take a machine algorithm and how much computing power and how you get all that data to be fed through.

26:11.997 --> 26:25.168
It's just a level of computing space and memory space that we don't really, can't really comprehend from the perspective of the kind of calculations that we do with Go or with chess in machine learning.

26:25.208 --> 26:31.233
And yet it comically, we just hand wave about this as though 10 years from now, this will be a done deal.

26:31.293 --> 26:32.534
It's already gonna be over.

26:34.335 --> 26:40.941
And I assure you behind the scenes in these discussions about this stuff, they've been saying that for decades already.

26:46.058 --> 27:06.185
And so yes, I think Brandy Vaughn is a very important piece to this puzzle because I think that the one thing that strikes me about her is that she says things so well, calling out the yellow fever vaccine, calling out the inside out part of the immune system, calling out, it's all really good.

27:07.509 --> 27:30.545
And so what's striking for me is that these ideas were all pretty sharp already when Brandy was enunciating them, and yet all the people that have come after her have neglected these wonderfully crafted semantic blades, like ingestion versus injection.

27:31.943 --> 27:37.385
like learn the risk, you know, like it's no safe vaccine.

27:38.025 --> 27:53.592
These are things that, like it or not, people were saying around Brandy and Brandy was saying in 2015, 16, 17, and then all the people that stepped in front of us in the beginning of COVID said nothing of the sort.

27:54.452 --> 27:56.273
And we're saying nothing of the sort.

28:01.798 --> 28:24.189
And here we are where the guy who declared a lab leak in January 25th, 2020, that brought us Li Min Yan, the whistleblower, and Miles Gao, her handler, and streamed with Steve Hatfield in January of 2020, seems to have coordinated some kind of populist movement that got Donald Trump reelected and got Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:24.389 --> 28:27.451
near to, but not the vice presidency.

28:30.839 --> 28:52.152
and seems to have involved the intellectual dark web like all these people that are on Twitter and X, all these people who are claiming that Elon Musk was brilliant for saving the world of free speech, all these people that were around in 2020 saying that the mystery of the novel virus was being solved on Twitter and censored on Twitter.

28:54.261 --> 28:58.163
These people seem to be pretty responsible for getting us here.

28:58.663 --> 29:11.330
And the track record will show that Sasha Latupova and Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey and Brett Weinstein, they're all tied together with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:11.390 --> 29:13.031
So if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:13.071 --> 29:19.835
were to be discredited by anything that these people in his proximity do or did or have said or said,

29:20.680 --> 29:22.240
we could have a pretty big problem.

29:22.280 --> 29:27.141
So for example, if somebody on the other side were to find out that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:27.241 --> 29:46.365
interviewed or CHD interviewed Sasha Latupova three times in 2023, and her daughter threatened and lost her YouTube channel in 2019 for threatening to come to the YouTube CEO's house and kill her or something, and then was promoted three times in 2019 by Alex Jones,

29:50.626 --> 29:54.489
Boy, that'll look a little weird, won't it, for the Health and Human Services Secretary?

29:57.111 --> 30:05.018
It'll be also weird if the head of the NIH had interviewed Charles Rixey already a year and a half ago, won't it, when Charles Rixey is finally discredited?

30:07.180 --> 30:07.760
But he did.

30:08.761 --> 30:10.422
And it's on his substack.

30:10.462 --> 30:19.570
So it's very weird how this guy could possibly get confirmed if all of these things are just freely available, and yet Robert F. Kennedy just got confirmed.

30:22.782 --> 30:31.205
And so something very malevolent is happening and it is actually an intentional theater that I think all of these people to some extent or another are involved.

30:32.166 --> 30:46.171
And I don't think it's a crazy idea given the incredible circumstances of Steve Bannon's timeline with how many frontline PBS coverage he got before the pandemic and at the start.

30:47.791 --> 30:49.753
It's just, it's remarkable where we are.

30:50.294 --> 30:53.037
It is absolutely remarkable where we are.

30:54.638 --> 31:08.213
Because these people were in front of the Senate, they were also in front of, in Romania, in Bucharest, and they're all saying the same nonsense that I have been able to very specifically delineate why it is nonsense.

31:09.696 --> 31:24.111
And I really implore you if you're here for the first time, this is what Edward Bernays warned us about in 1924 when he had no idea that we would all be holding a cell phone full of military programs and thinking we were talking to each other.

31:25.453 --> 31:30.198
Thinking we were getting a read on what's happening in America by a few minutes of scrolling.

31:32.165 --> 31:40.188
And so these powers have been acknowledged for generations and these powers are now more powerful than ever given social media.

31:42.256 --> 31:49.339
And we are fractured inside of this limited spectrum of debate that was created by these people in particular in my life.

31:50.039 --> 31:59.382
There are others that are periphery to this, one of them being James Lyons Weiler that I'd like to talk about today, one of them being Brett Weinstein on that picture.

31:59.422 --> 32:05.705
But the simple answer to the question is, is that an anticipated rise in expected deaths

32:06.425 --> 32:12.527
was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

32:12.568 --> 32:21.091
That's why we are here where we are and that's the theater that these people enacted on mainstream media and on social media.

32:21.926 --> 32:41.020
And if you ever thought that you were a part of it, if you ever went to a meeting or a dinner and you sat there and they were listening to you and telling you how great you were, you were essentially brought on stage and you got confused and thought that whatever you said mattered, even though the rest of the people that are on stage were enacting a script.

32:45.163 --> 32:50.747
And so this is the, we're going on the sixth year now, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't wake up soon, we're in big trouble.

33:07.388 --> 33:12.691
In case you are not aware, Giggle and Biological is funded by viewers like you, not like PBS NewsHour.

33:12.751 --> 33:17.452
So if you can and haven't yet, please go to Giggle and Biological and find a way to support the stream.

33:20.512 --> 33:21.653
It is for all the marbles.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.254
It's about the grandchildren of earth.

33:23.394 --> 33:30.438
I want to go back in time as I usually do, because I do think it's very, very important to regularly document and to archive.

33:30.478 --> 33:34.621
And so I think this video, at least the first 30 minutes of it is very important to archive.

33:35.542 --> 33:42.106
But first I think I'm going to make... Hey, this is Dr. Ben Waits, host of the Rational Wellness Podcast.

33:43.243 --> 33:46.125
I want to think about already what you see here now.

33:46.185 --> 33:51.109
In March 2020, this guy seems to know that it's time to be a podcaster.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.490
He's reading it.

33:53.570 --> 33:54.431
He's got music.

33:54.531 --> 33:55.452
He's got an intro.

33:56.292 --> 34:00.315
I mean, he doesn't look like a guy who's into podcasting, but he is podcasting.

34:00.335 --> 34:00.696
Here he goes.

34:04.218 --> 34:06.759
Hello, Rational Wellness Podcasters.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.940
Thank you so much for joining me again today.

34:09.521 --> 34:17.324
For those of you who enjoy listening to the Rational Wellness Podcast, please go to Apple Podcasts and give us a ratings and review.

34:18.265 --> 34:24.267

And if you go to my website, drweitz.com, you can find detailed show notes and a complete transcript.

34:32.421 --> 34:39.766
Today, we will be discussing the coronavirus pandemic with Dr. James Lyons-Weiler.

34:41.047 --> 34:54.878
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the infection with the coronavirus that has made its way from a bat to humans in China and now is spread around the globe, creating a global pandemic.

34:55.868 --> 34:56.548
Dr. James.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.729
In case you're not aware or notice, he is reading a script.

34:59.809 --> 35:02.349
I assume that James gave it to him, but anyway, here we go.

35:02.369 --> 35:05.370
James Lyons, is it Wyler or Wheeler?

35:05.910 --> 35:06.310
Wyler.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.270
Wyler, thank you.

35:08.650 --> 35:09.310
Sorry about that.

35:09.430 --> 35:16.332
Is the founder and CEO of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a not-for-profit research institute also known as.

35:16.412 --> 35:19.312
He's definitely reading a script that James gave him.

35:19.412 --> 35:20.552
Imagine that.

35:20.833 --> 35:23.053
Imagine how sad that is.

35:24.269 --> 35:30.096
No one's ever given me a script to read about their intro or COVID-19 has become a what?

35:30.156 --> 35:31.938
Listen to this script he's reading.

35:31.978 --> 35:32.899
This is gross.

35:33.059 --> 35:33.399
Wow.

35:34.020 --> 35:34.701
I'm impressed.

35:35.382 --> 35:36.343
He's the author of three.

35:37.083 --> 35:39.546
And if you go to my website, drweights.com.

35:39.566 --> 35:40.567
I'm starting this again.

35:40.587 --> 35:43.511
You can find detailed show notes and a complete transcript.

35:44.468 --> 35:51.810
Today, we will be discussing the coronavirus pandemic with Dr. James Lyons-Weiler.

35:53.090 --> 36:06.913
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the infection with the coronavirus that has made its way from a bat to humans in China and now is spread around the globe, creating a global pandemic.

36:07.913 --> 36:11.136
Dr. James Lyons, is it Wyler or Wheeler?

36:11.696 --> 36:12.117
Wyler.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.079
Wyler, thank you.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.119
Sorry about that.

36:15.220 --> 36:22.726
Is the founder and CEO of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a not-for-profit research institute, also known as IPAC.

36:23.387 --> 36:33.375
He's the author of three books, one on Ebola, another on cures versus profits, and a third on the environmental and genetic causes of autism,

36:34.156 --> 36:37.601
which is based on over 2,000 peer-reviewed studies on autism.

36:38.142 --> 36:41.447
Thank you, Dr. Lyons-Weiler, for joining us today.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.230
Yeah, thank you, Ben.

36:43.290 --> 36:47.516
It's a pleasure to be part of your experience here on this planet.

36:48.835 --> 36:49.296
Thank you.

36:49.716 --> 36:54.439
And this is that's definitely a good way to phrase it on a day like this when living in.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.501
Okay, let's make some observations here.

36:56.541 --> 36:58.302
It's March 18, 2020.

36:59.563 --> 37:02.325
He's wearing a suit on a podcast.

37:02.365 --> 37:03.926
He's already got an angle set up.

37:05.268 --> 37:22.584
where I don't know where his camera is but it's set up a little funny and it looks like to me these are very large pieces of paper with large writing on them which is kind of like cue cards but then at home on A4 so just you know just pointing that out there whatever

37:24.417 --> 37:30.702
in Los Angeles and trying to run a chiropractic practice and people are afraid to come out of their house.

37:31.163 --> 37:37.969
And, um, the, uh, level of, uh, fear, panic and anxiety seems to be rising by the minute.

37:38.489 --> 37:43.653
So you mean you guys haven't figured out all you have to do is put a shower curtain between you and your patient.

37:43.673 --> 37:44.154
You're fine.

37:44.354 --> 37:45.175
Like in the movies.

37:47.952 --> 37:56.640
So I thought we'd start with the most important question, and that is, what part does drinking Corona beers play in this coronavirus pandemic?

37:57.161 --> 37:58.322
I think it's an essential part.

37:58.342 --> 38:02.806
You get the most clear-headed, rational thoughts that come to you.

38:02.826 --> 38:05.148
It doesn't necessarily have to be Corona either.

38:05.168 --> 38:06.309
Oh, OK.

38:09.432 --> 38:17.822
So can you explain how this coronavirus, because we've had other coronaviruses before.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.804
We had SARS and we had MERS.

38:20.304 --> 38:24.709
Can you explain how this coronavirus is different than the other coronaviruses?

38:25.535 --> 38:26.075
Absolutely.

38:26.195 --> 38:29.196
So I'm going to be on that topic.

38:29.236 --> 38:32.257
I'll be talking about published research and not yet published research.

38:32.317 --> 38:41.639
So in a published research, we know that there are genomic differences at the genome level and important parts of important proteins.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.780
There are large differences.

38:43.860 --> 38:45.240
The spike protein seems to be

38:45.680 --> 38:57.708
Now, there's no reason in his prior resume to believe that somehow he would have as much molecular insight into the novel virus as he is about to demonstrate.

38:57.828 --> 39:03.571
But, as I have made clear many times, he's one of the first guys that I found.

39:03.651 --> 39:09.515
His blog was featured in Dan Surotkin's Harvard to the Big Houses blog.

39:10.235 --> 39:14.378
Dan Surotkin's dad works at Los Alamos Laboratory and his name is Carl Surotkin.

39:15.723 --> 39:26.107
That blog featured the blog of James Lyons Wyler and cited it as a virology blog with evidence of the fear and cleavage site and therefore a laboratory leak.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.708
So make no mistake about it.

39:28.768 --> 39:42.933
The person that I found and did a bike ride about and then promoted my video on Zero Hedge, that's all wrapped up into this week.

39:43.977 --> 39:45.711
and maybe the two weeks before it.

39:47.466 --> 40:04.415
because it's the last, oh no, sorry, this is a month later, because it's the last week of January, I think, that Harvard to the Big House publishes his blog, and then two weeks later in February, I do my bike ride about it, and there, I'm also already, one of the images I show is from this guy's blog.

40:04.876 --> 40:15.942
He's living in Pittsburgh at this time, and by the time I figured it out that he's living in Pittsburgh at this time, I contacted him on Twitter, and I have those direct messages, and we never,

40:16.722 --> 40:17.782
really connected.

40:17.822 --> 40:21.904
He kind of managed to avoid me until he moved to Michigan the following year.

40:24.084 --> 40:24.704
Quite distinct.

40:24.744 --> 40:31.486
The spike protein on the coronavirus is the protein that sits on the surface of the virus that allows entry.

40:32.086 --> 40:35.267
The virus uses it to enter into the host cell.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.709
Is that when we see those diagrams and those things sticking up?

40:41.810 --> 40:43.071
Yeah, exactly.

40:43.151 --> 40:48.155
So those actually bind to a protein on the surface.

40:48.776 --> 41:04.671
It's called an ACE2 molecule in this virus, and it then fuses to the cellular membrane, and then the envelope opens up and becomes part of the cellular membrane, and then the contents of the virus, which is RNA, is spilled into the cell.

41:05.151 --> 41:11.393
the RNA that is seen by the cell is any other RNA and then it starts creating viral proteins.

41:11.954 --> 41:23.338
So then you get a new virion or a population of viruses in the cell and then the cell bursts and then the virus is spread from cell to cell.

41:23.678 --> 41:37.952
So that's already an incredibly ham-fisted explanation of whatever virology is supposed to be because he skips the problem of having to copy the RNA and putting the RNA back into a viral protein.

41:38.706 --> 41:41.087
like the coat, like the whole package.

41:41.947 --> 42:01.892
So it's a lot more complicated than the RNA going in and then a cell making viral proteins because the cell also has to make copies of the genomic RNA and then package successfully the genomic RNA into a viral particle made of and coated with the viral proteins and not any other proteins.

42:02.512 --> 42:16.457
And so it's a lot of hand-waving that he's happy to do for virology, even though he's supposed to be a guy who's skeptical about the vaccine schedule and skeptical about childhood diseases or something like that.

42:16.537 --> 42:21.839
But in no way, shape or form, does this guy have any grasp on what he's actually talking about?

42:21.879 --> 42:25.801
He's following a script that he doesn't understand well enough.

42:27.950 --> 42:30.571
And so that's why he looks as bad as he looks right now.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.212
And it's going to get much worse.

42:32.732 --> 42:33.632
This is awful.

42:34.413 --> 42:40.195
But there's no other way to see this other than this is a criminal who was given a script and went along with it.

42:40.235 --> 42:49.478
And as a result is a traitor to our grandkids, a traitor to us, his fellow Americans, because he went along with something he should not have gone along with.

42:49.518 --> 42:52.640
He read a script he should not have read because of whoever gave it to him.

42:53.020 --> 42:55.761
He knew that this would be malevolent.

42:59.178 --> 43:05.121
This particular virus has a spike protein that has a number of unique characteristics.

43:05.161 --> 43:17.587
There's a new nature study that I just finished looking over this morning that shows that the spike protein has distinct, well, it's citing some previous literature.

43:17.607 --> 43:22.089
It has a furin cleavage site, which we've known about for about two, three weeks.

43:23.891 --> 43:27.080
He's one of the first people to write about the fear and cleavage site, so there you go.

43:27.140 --> 43:31.351
Two to three weeks would put it right at the end of February, but I think it was earlier than that.

43:33.529 --> 43:44.312
But it has a number of distinct elements, including one that appears to potentially help the virus target immune cells.

43:45.652 --> 43:52.254
And so targeting immune cells was also something that Paul Cottrell was saying over and over again.

43:52.294 --> 43:55.995
He was saying the CD147 receptor over and over and over again.

43:56.852 --> 43:58.612
which I believe is a T cell receptor.

43:59.153 --> 44:04.654
And that's what led to this rumors of flying AIDS that started already, yes, in March, 2020.

44:06.474 --> 44:13.896
With Paul Cattrell and Harvard to the big house and this super clown who is seeding that narrative right now.

44:14.056 --> 44:15.636
And again, this is not his idea.

44:16.036 --> 44:17.597
He's not a molecular biologist.

44:17.637 --> 44:19.217
He doesn't know how to do any of this stuff.

44:19.237 --> 44:22.218
He's just says he's reading papers and coming to conclusions.

44:22.698 --> 44:23.838
He's reading a script.

44:26.656 --> 44:42.151
You know, my own research, and this is the unpublished part of it because it's still under peer review, my own research shows that there is a protein motif signature that is characteristic of this particular spike protein.

44:42.651 --> 44:45.053
There are four elements that we're paying attention to.

44:45.954 --> 44:56.823
And it seems to have, and I want scientists to understand this, it has a truncated N-terminal domain in the spike protein, in the first part of the protein.

44:57.724 --> 45:03.369
That's unusual compared to other SARS and other related beta coronaviruses.

45:05.697 --> 45:11.540
And then it's missing two other domains that appear to be present in all other coronaviruses that are related to this.

45:12.121 --> 45:15.382
And then it appears to have a GP40-like domain.

45:15.402 --> 45:18.604
I always say GP40-like domain because it is not a GP40 domain.

45:19.505 --> 45:23.207
So there are very specific molecular differences in this spike protein.

45:23.547 --> 45:29.530
It's going to have a different molecular function, therefore, because the sequence determines the structure, which determines the function.

45:31.091 --> 45:34.233
But clinically, then, this is a very different virus because

45:34.793 --> 45:36.573
This virus has a four to five day.

45:38.454 --> 45:44.876
So here he's now going to describe the known statistics of the virus in a very certain way.

45:44.916 --> 45:49.617
And again, this host stands no chance and he doesn't, it's not, he's not meant to.

45:50.757 --> 45:51.658
This is all fake.

45:52.578 --> 45:53.418
This was a setup.

45:54.278 --> 45:55.299
You want a podcast?

45:55.459 --> 45:56.719
I got podcast guests.

45:57.079 --> 45:58.579
Here's one of the podcast guests.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.140
He probably had Meryl Nass on too, or one of these other people.

46:02.321 --> 46:03.801
It's almost without a doubt.

46:05.618 --> 46:07.179
asymptomatic period.

46:07.599 --> 46:11.920
So you can get infected and then four or five days later before you have your first symptoms.

46:12.321 --> 46:23.505
About 80% of people can be expected to have mild symptoms, but the people that do have serious symptoms, you know, 14% need hospitalization and 66% need an ICU.

46:24.425 --> 46:27.266
So, you know, we're at the onset of the outbreak here.

46:27.646 --> 46:32.208
We are at least three weeks behind where we could have been with accurate testing.

46:32.876 --> 46:37.138
So we're at least three weeks behind where we could have been with accurate testing.

46:37.178 --> 47:01.629
So on March 18th of 2020, he also knows from his script that a crucial part of the narrative in 2020 is going to be to debate about whether the tests work, and how specific they are, and whether overcycling matters or not, and not talk at all about how many amplicons are being used, or whether there's nested primers, or whether they're sequencing what they amplify, nothing of that.

47:03.186 --> 47:12.614
And so with all of his magic knowledge about all this molecular biology, he's not going to explain the very basics of the PCR test and the premise behind it.

47:15.256 --> 47:17.998
He's just going to tell you that accurate testing is real.

47:18.058 --> 47:19.039
We can totally do it.

47:19.360 --> 47:19.840
It's easy.

47:19.880 --> 47:20.981
We just aren't doing it yet.

47:21.822 --> 47:25.565
Initially, we really, really missed the ball in accurate testing.

47:26.986 --> 47:28.047
But nevertheless, we're in the

47:31.863 --> 47:33.204
exponential part of the curve.

47:33.765 --> 47:40.291
And during that exponential part of the curve, it's a race between the ability to produce enough tests and the virus to spread.

47:40.571 --> 47:43.073
That's the exponential part of the curve right there.

47:45.535 --> 47:52.161
This trader was part of an illusion of consensus about what this curve right here meant.

47:52.682 --> 47:58.087
This curve in America was almost exclusively created by the New York City numbers.

48:00.345 --> 48:03.646
And this curve is exactly what he's talking about right now.

48:05.187 --> 48:09.849
This curve is what Kevin McCairn was predicting would be a billion people dead.

48:10.629 --> 48:11.810
Worst case scenario.

48:14.050 --> 48:21.553
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, I am suggesting that these people were put in place with a script.

48:21.994 --> 48:24.995
It didn't have all the pieces because that would make them vulnerable.

48:25.993 --> 48:34.742
It had the pieces that they were given, and these people were too simple or too excited to evaluate what they were doing.

48:35.823 --> 48:46.993
Maybe the operation was too compartmentalized for them to have any clue what they were doing, other than to know that they were told that they were doing something patriotic or going to save the country or something.

48:47.054 --> 48:47.434
I don't know.

48:48.955 --> 48:49.556
But it ain't good.

48:51.311 --> 49:05.428
because by now they should realize what a absolute fiasco was created by them and what absolute prison planet we are on the way to because of what they did.

49:06.212 --> 49:10.454
So now we've enacted some pretty serious social distancing.

49:10.474 --> 49:12.775
As you've noticed, it's impacting everyone's lives now.

49:13.395 --> 49:18.177
And, you know, two months ago, I was saying that we should stop shaking hands.

49:18.257 --> 49:20.458
We should start using the Ebola fist bump and so on.

49:21.958 --> 49:28.301
Two months ago, in January of 2020, he was saying that we should start using the Ebola fist bump.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.082
sanitize public places.

49:34.142 --> 49:38.146
We need to tell people that are not essential to work from home if they can.

49:38.787 --> 49:43.292
And had those policies implemented then in a gentle way, we would have bought more time.

49:43.312 --> 49:45.495
But now we've already reached the exponential curve.

49:46.095 --> 49:50.120
And in the exponential curve then, you know, even 60 percent

49:53.277 --> 49:59.365
complete quarantine with this virus will not lead to a shutdown.

50:00.306 --> 50:03.751
You can force quarantine 60%, 60, 60% of the American population and it'll still spread.

50:09.386 --> 50:12.268
So why is that even a hypothetical that he's talking about?

50:12.328 --> 50:28.418
Because he wants to cede the idea that the question of whether or not we can be mandated lockdown or not is a valid question to discuss, and if lockdown can stop a virus or reduce a virus to zero in any given situation.

50:28.439 --> 50:30.340
Well, let's discuss that, right?

50:31.120 --> 50:32.041
Holy yuck.

50:33.638 --> 50:42.681
So I got a bunch of questions, but one question I wanted to ask to follow up on the fact that you said there's this incubation period.

50:43.101 --> 50:49.964
During that incubation period, if you get tested, would you potentially test positive or not until you become symptomatic?

50:50.692 --> 50:55.416
Yeah, there's high levels of viruses in the pre-symptomatic period or the asymptomatic period.

50:55.496 --> 51:01.141
Unfortunately, the test that the CDC put out is maybe 60% sensitive.

51:01.261 --> 51:07.907
So he already knows the sensitivity of the CDC test or the WHO test or whatever.

51:07.927 --> 51:10.169
I mean, it's 60%.

51:10.909 --> 51:11.970
What does that even mean?

51:12.050 --> 51:13.772
What kind of bullshit is this?

51:14.898 --> 51:19.042
The certainty level here is what you need to see and realize.

51:19.082 --> 51:22.225
This is not a person who's trying to figure it out.

51:22.265 --> 51:25.949
This is a person who is working a script, running the job.

51:25.989 --> 51:28.031
That's why the script is visible there.

51:28.472 --> 51:29.913
That's why he's got a suit on.

51:30.274 --> 51:32.356
That's why he's got the backdrop already.

51:34.372 --> 51:45.139
which means that there's a lot of people that are going to be given false confidence that they don't have the virus, and that's why we're where we are.

51:45.339 --> 52:00.028
I analyzed the CDC's primer probe sets, and I found that a quarter of them actually amplify human proteins, or likely to amplify human proteins, as well as a viral protein, which could, unfortunately, the way they set up the test, it was best three out of four

52:01.088 --> 52:03.931
amplification reactions as a diagnostic.

52:04.571 --> 52:15.780
So if a person didn't have, you know, they basically needed three out of three, because one of the primer probe sets was probably, that reaction was probably not

52:16.681 --> 52:19.585
not going to lead to a true positive ever.

52:20.226 --> 52:27.556
And so they said that there was some contamination or something like that, but I sent this information to CDC, and then I sent it to the FDA, and they showed great interest.

52:27.596 --> 52:30.741
The FDA showed great interest in what potentially could be wrong with this kit.

52:32.617 --> 52:35.019
because we're already in the exponential part of the curve.

52:36.600 --> 52:40.223
Places like the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have announced that they're making the road test.

52:40.544 --> 52:41.424
People are not waiting.

52:41.965 --> 52:45.488
We cannot wait for the CDC to distribute accurate testing.

52:45.528 --> 52:46.629
That's what people have decided.

52:46.689 --> 52:49.971
I think it's a clinically ethical thing to do, to want to know.

52:50.072 --> 52:53.775
The value of testing at this point is not to shut it down.

52:54.535 --> 52:56.697
Make no uncertain terms.

52:58.158 --> 52:59.398
Don't be confused by this.

52:59.859 --> 53:09.001
If we have 100 or 200 cases or 1,000 cases, for every one of those, there might be 80, for every one case, there might be 80 to 100.

53:09.081 --> 53:10.821
Now make no mistake about it.

53:10.921 --> 53:18.743
This guy has been on stage at every CHD conference that I've attended as a staff scientist.

53:20.004 --> 53:20.944
Not me, him.

53:23.280 --> 53:28.881
And most of the time he's on stage multiple times during the weekend, like once every day, if not twice.

53:30.402 --> 53:36.523
He's shared the stage with people like Susan Humphreys, who really shouldn't share the stage with anyone.

53:40.805 --> 53:42.345
Same with Brian Hooker, to be honest.

53:44.502 --> 53:49.704
This guy is directly connected to our Health and Human Services Secretary right now.

53:49.784 --> 53:58.367
This guy could be used to single handedly discredit Bobby's whole stance on everything.

53:59.988 --> 54:13.133
We watched a video from 2019 where this guy is talking about how vaccinated, vaccinating preventable diseases are circulating in the background of vaccinated populations asymptomatically.

54:15.134 --> 54:19.477
the exact narrative that Paul Offit and the CDC need.

54:20.638 --> 54:25.581
He was saying that to anti-vax people at anti-vax meetings.

54:26.755 --> 54:38.609
while he was promoting the idea that it is a genetic vulnerability to components of the vaccine and we need to do genetic testing on everybody to make the vaccine schedule safe.

54:39.129 --> 54:42.814
This guy has too much knowledge in March of 2020.

54:44.015 --> 54:46.298
Too much knowledge unless he's been read in.

54:49.656 --> 54:51.617
more cases that are out there that we don't know about.

54:51.637 --> 54:56.759
And so there's no way that the medical community is going to find all those people at this point.

54:56.819 --> 54:58.360
We've lost contact tracing.

54:58.380 --> 55:00.261
It's the asymptomatic period.

55:00.861 --> 55:02.322
Contact tracing is not going to be useful.

55:02.602 --> 55:10.286
The only utility of testing this point forward that I see would be expeditious use of resources like ICUs.

55:11.066 --> 55:13.087
And so we need really accurate testing.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.248
We need ventilators.

55:17.299 --> 55:22.083
Well, I mean, how can we know where the curve is to decide upon strategies?

55:22.144 --> 55:33.674
Like, how long are we going to do social distancing and quarantining, or whatever you want to call it, unless we really know what the numbers are?

55:33.854 --> 55:42.082
And do we even know to what extent the numbers are going up, or just the fact that we're testing all these people who maybe were already positive?

55:44.903 --> 55:47.664
I'll take that question as a serious one.

55:48.005 --> 55:51.126
There are two countries that we could have followed the model of.

55:51.266 --> 55:52.246
One is South Korea.

55:52.766 --> 55:54.607
We cannot follow the South Korea model.

55:54.647 --> 55:55.127
It's too late.

55:56.087 --> 55:57.888
We already reached the exponential point.

55:57.928 --> 56:03.410
They did expert contact tracing with online information systems that were really exquisite.

56:03.910 --> 56:11.993
Online contact tracing information systems is what this guy is now advocating for to control a pandemic.

56:13.919 --> 56:21.987
This is as bad as Mary Holland advocating for AI online medicine and other innovation.

56:25.486 --> 56:27.707
They did testing, testing, testing.

56:27.947 --> 56:29.467
They had it in place in time.

56:30.388 --> 56:47.953
It's too late for us to have a serious impact in terms of slowing down the spread of this because we have, for every case that you see right now, that person was also four to five people five days ago were also infected along with that one person.

56:47.993 --> 56:53.275
So we're looking at maybe we, of the number of cases that we have, maybe we know 20% of what we have.

56:54.995 --> 57:05.377
So because we don't have the contact tracing in parity with the clinical testing and the tests that people are being shipped is not accurate.

57:05.798 --> 57:07.358
How did that happen?

57:07.518 --> 57:11.499
Why is there such this massive screw up on the testing?

57:11.539 --> 57:13.739
Why were we so late with the testing?

57:14.079 --> 57:17.160
Why didn't we take the World Health Organization test?

57:17.860 --> 57:20.221
And what's the screw up at the CDC?

57:21.388 --> 57:28.234
So unfortunately, CDC is more like a business corporation than it is a regulatory agency.

57:28.574 --> 57:34.639
They have a not-for-profit that pharmaceutical companies donate over $27 million to every year.

57:34.999 --> 57:45.047
In the name of doing good for humanity, however, the World Health Organization offered the CDC the test from Germany.

57:45.848 --> 57:49.851
And they declined, and that cost us an incredibly valuable two weeks.

57:50.236 --> 58:16.720
Now that's really funny because in November of this same year, Claire Craig of the Heart Group, and Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project, and Mike Yeadon of the Pharmaceutical Industry, and Thomas Binder, cardiologist from Switzerland, and a bunch of other people are going to get together and write a paper about why the Corman-Jorston PCR test is bullshit.

58:20.049 --> 58:25.794
He's saying that because we didn't adopt the Corman-Joriston PCR test, we lost weeks in America.

58:27.276 --> 58:29.898
What a funny little hamster wheel we were on in 2020, right?

58:33.055 --> 58:36.776
And I was hammering on, no, we need to get the testing now, we need to get the testing now.

58:37.356 --> 58:42.098
The other country who's modeled that we, the only, where do we know where we are in the curve?

58:42.138 --> 58:43.298
Well, we know we're exponential.

58:43.318 --> 58:49.119
We know we're only seeing, you know, maybe 20% of the cases that are actually residents in the country.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.560
We don't know where they are.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.700
We don't know who they are.

58:51.760 --> 58:53.461
They include medical staff right now.

58:53.481 --> 58:54.281
They include nurses.

58:54.561 --> 58:58.122
They include the... He's not trying to scare anybody though.

59:00.478 --> 59:00.578
the

59:11.414 --> 59:12.875
did not wait for a vaccine.

59:13.775 --> 59:20.920
China used social distancing, they put the people in home, and if you broke quarantine, you were arrested.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.281
That's why you saw people arrested.

59:22.321 --> 59:24.062
People say, oh my God, that can't ever happen here.

59:24.522 --> 59:29.965
Believe me, every governor in every state will prosecute you if you're under mandatory quarantine and you found to violate their quarantine.

59:31.286 --> 59:35.647
you will be arrested, you will be tried, you could be fined or imprisoned, absolutely, okay?

59:35.907 --> 59:39.008
But to this point, we've never had mandatory quarantine, right?

59:39.108 --> 59:58.892
I think he just told you the same thing that, what is that lawyer, that famous constitutional lawyer that's been on like MSNBC actually went on John Cullen's program or with Jason Goodman earlier in this year as well to say that the government could lock you down and the government could come and inject you.

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:02.404
James Lyons-Weiler is just telling you the same thing.

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.545
The government can put you in jail for this stuff.

01:00:05.926 --> 01:00:09.068
I think San Francisco is now, you know, pretty close to that.

01:00:10.287 --> 01:00:12.628
pretty close to where everybody's supposed to stay.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:17.570
Well, they're told, well, you know, my son's in San Francisco right now going to college.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:25.713
And so they're basically told they're supposed to stay at home except for important things like going into a grocery store.

01:00:26.153 --> 01:00:26.693
OK, right.

01:00:26.733 --> 01:00:27.433
So we'll get to that.

01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:27.773
Right.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:31.115
So quarantine doesn't mean that you have to have three months of food in your house, right?

01:00:31.155 --> 01:00:33.776
It means it's a good idea to have a week or two.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.136
Yeah, Dershowitz.

01:00:34.156 --> 01:00:34.996
It was Dershowitz.

01:00:35.076 --> 01:00:35.296
Right.

01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:36.557
But here's the deal.

01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:38.839
China shut down.

01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:40.060
We're not going to know.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.462
You can still find that video on YouTube.

01:00:42.482 --> 01:00:48.068
I think it was in 2021 that that Goodman had Dershowitz on his on his podcast.

01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:48.268
Yep.

01:00:48.608 --> 01:00:50.810
Water supply is not going to be jeopardized.

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.872
The roof of your house is not going to blow off.

01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:53.833
It's not a hurricane.

01:00:53.853 --> 01:00:55.134
You're going to have electricity.

01:00:55.314 --> 01:00:57.817
OK, the wastewater treatments are still going to work.

01:00:57.917 --> 01:01:01.200
OK, so the utilities will all be there.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:01.861
But in.

01:01:02.381 --> 01:01:08.412
Well, according to some of these people, I think the script was actually that RFK would be the vice president.

01:01:09.354 --> 01:01:14.584
One of the best pieces of evidence I have for that, hold on, let me just get the book so I can show it to you.

01:01:34.289 --> 01:01:35.149
I can't find it.

01:01:35.189 --> 01:01:36.250
Where the hell is it now?

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:38.950
I gotta locate it again.

01:01:39.691 --> 01:01:41.891
I have a new, sorry about that.

01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:53.334
I have a new bookshelf and so I've arranged my books and that means they're not where I expect them to be.

01:01:53.434 --> 01:01:56.835
I have to practice a little bit so I know where they all are all the time.

01:01:59.256 --> 01:02:01.717
But if you look for the book by

01:02:03.649 --> 01:02:05.091
by Jesse the Body Ventura.

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:09.035
It is a biography about his time as the governor of Minnesota.

01:02:09.516 --> 01:02:14.761
It is called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me in the 13th chapter of that book, which is a fictional chapter 13.

01:02:16.826 --> 01:02:20.407
He runs for president with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:20.447 --> 01:02:21.428
as his vice president.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:25.890
And two months after he gets elected, he gets shot and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.090
becomes president and saves America.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:32.532
That's actually how that book from 2009 ends.

01:02:32.712 --> 01:02:42.056
And Brett Weinstein and Steve Bannon are two people, at least I know, who are on camera several times saying that they wanted

01:02:43.296 --> 01:02:45.398
Trump to select Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:45.438 --> 01:02:46.318
as his vice president.

01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:51.201
There's even a video of Brett Weinstein making a pitch for this before J.D.

01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:55.124
Vance was selected from the shore of the lake by his house.

01:02:55.244 --> 01:03:04.050
This is not just something thrown out there, but I do agree him getting health and human services secretary is almost the same thing.

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:11.675
Maybe it is exactly where he was supposed to be in the whole narrative of we wanted him to be vice president is just

01:03:13.416 --> 01:03:23.050
uh to make it more acceptable that he's only health and human services and it could be i don't know china so stop stocking up on water bottles

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:27.209
Well, I mean, if it makes you feel better, right, there's that aspect of it.

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.571
If you like to see 20 cans of sardines in your pantry, go for it.

01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:32.992
You know, if it makes you feel better.

01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:38.454
You're not hurting anybody by doing that, so you're actually driving the economy a little bit, right?

01:03:39.254 --> 01:03:42.436
And that's a serious, that's actually a very serious point.

01:03:42.456 --> 01:03:44.897
No, I know, the supermarkets are booming right now.

01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:52.275
So in China, they shut this down through a combination of therapeutics and social distancing.

01:03:52.815 --> 01:03:56.457
They didn't just use social distancing, and there's no vaccine in China.

01:03:57.057 --> 01:03:59.759
They shut it down, and let me show you a curve, okay.

01:04:00.039 --> 01:04:03.641
China was doing this, and we're now talking about

01:04:04.784 --> 01:04:10.505
extending the curve out, flattening the curve out so that the medical community has time to... I mean, come on.

01:04:11.325 --> 01:04:15.966
I hope you're not arguing with me in the chat because J.D.

01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:18.707
Vance, they made a movie out of his book.

01:04:18.747 --> 01:04:21.407
So you don't have to convince me that that guy was selected.

01:04:21.468 --> 01:04:24.848
It just is a question of, you know, who did they select in the end?

01:04:24.908 --> 01:04:28.909
So I'm not claiming any special knowledge for sure.

01:04:29.049 --> 01:04:32.750
And I'm definitely not arguing with anybody that I know more than you guys do.

01:04:34.132 --> 01:04:37.620
Just be clear, I just know for sure it's a wonderful theater.

01:04:37.801 --> 01:04:39.224
Be able to prepare to handle it.

01:04:39.565 --> 01:04:41.349
China's curve went just like this.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.464
I just looked at it on a map and can we trust that?

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.225
Yes, yes we can.

01:04:49.265 --> 01:04:51.167
The doctors are taking their, yes we can.

01:04:51.307 --> 01:04:54.030
So we can trust the curves from China.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:05:00.276
That's half of the story because the other half of the story is people saying that you can't trust the curves, that they're lying about it.

01:05:00.316 --> 01:05:07.863
Remember that Andrew Huff said that one of the reasons why he knew something was happening was because he saw the smoke from all the burning bodies.

01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:12.063
The doctors are taking, the nurses are taking their masks off.

01:05:12.344 --> 01:05:13.745
People are showing up in the streets.

01:05:13.765 --> 01:05:19.429
You're gonna see video over the next few days or next week of Wuhan itself returning to normalcy.

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:25.434
And that's what we want because we cannot afford an extended social distancing.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:30.058
It will destroy our economy to maintain social distancing.

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:34.742
And there's no promise that the vaccine that's being tried right now in Seattle is gonna show

01:05:35.362 --> 01:05:58.465
the safety profile the vaccine being tried in seattle did you hear that one mark file that it needs to i'm very skeptical that the animal studies well they skipped the animal studies and they went right to human trials the problem with that is that the animal studies in every other SARS like MERS like vaccine that used the spike protein right

01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:07.058
The animals getting the vaccine, when they were challenged with the virus after the vaccine, had worse clinical outcomes, higher morbidity, higher mortality.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:09.280
They had immunopathology in the lungs.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.181
They had hepatitis.

01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:13.282
They had serious issues.

01:06:13.962 --> 01:06:19.585
And I think it's an autoimmune reaction, that you get sensitized to it by the vaccine.

01:06:20.666 --> 01:06:23.287
and then you get challenged by the virus.

01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:39.190
So I did a deep dive into the epitopes that are in the virus, in SARS-CoV-2, and the deep dive that I did showed that out of the 37 proteins that I studied, all of them except for six had immunogenic peptides.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.291
So there's six of them that won't be useful in a vaccine.

01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:52.515
So he's a pretty talented person that can take the sequence of viral proteins and scan them for immunogenic sequences, which I'm not really sure I would know how to do.

01:06:55.316 --> 01:07:03.300
Out of all of those that had immunogenetic peptides, all of them, except for one, had a match to a human protein.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.202
And a third of those matches were to immune system proteins.

01:07:08.652 --> 01:07:13.573
It's weird, right, that all these viral particles would have such an overlap with human signals.

01:07:13.993 --> 01:07:16.374
It's almost like they might just be exosomes.

01:07:17.394 --> 01:07:26.976
So that's probably why these animals had a worse outcome, because their own immune system was being attacked by their own immune system after they were challenged by the second virus.

01:07:27.036 --> 01:07:28.336
It's a two-hit hypothesis.

01:07:28.636 --> 01:07:32.337
People are calling it immune enhancement, which is a misnomer.

01:07:32.377 --> 01:07:33.497
It's a gross misnomer.

01:07:34.077 --> 01:07:37.478
We're changing the terminology to pathologic priming.

01:07:38.198 --> 01:07:53.230
We are changing the terminology to pathogenic priming and he's still the only person on the planet that uses that combination of words to describe what everybody else calls like antibody dependent enhancement or some bullshit like that.

01:07:56.445 --> 01:08:15.873
where the first exposure to the virus sets you up for worse outcomes, whether it's through clinical exposure, you get a double infection, you get the SARS virus this year, you get another SARS coronavirus next year, whatever the second exposure is, and I think that probably explains why the mortality was so, so high.

01:08:15.933 --> 01:08:21.635
Now, the funny part about this is that this is the actual mechanistic explanation for why two shots

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:27.118
are the deadly one and what Sukrit Bhakti has been saying since as long as I've known him.

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:38.306
Which is the first time you get transfected, your body clears that protein and maybe makes antibodies or killer T cells that can recognize that spike protein.

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:45.171
The next time you get transfected to that spike protein, the killer T cells will take care of every cell expressing that.

01:08:47.133 --> 01:08:51.716
The antibodies will activate and kill every cell expressing it.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:09:13.944
And so the potential for the reaction to occur in the endothelium is only as bad as it is in the second one, provided that the whole immune mechanism that they purport is happening is really happening, where a foreign protein is creating antibody and other immune memory that is responded to the second exposure.

01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:21.329
Some of these immune observations that have been made in the past are not wholly bunk.

01:09:21.969 --> 01:09:28.955
They're just kind of dumb simple, and so it's not sufficient for understanding.

01:09:29.516 --> 01:09:37.683
But to some extent, the reason why Sukrata Bhakti was much more right than wrong is because that observation exists.

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:51.024
And so what James Lyons Wyler seems to be doing is seeding a narrative where two exposures to the virus is equivalent to two transfections that nobody knows is coming.

01:09:51.084 --> 01:09:52.845
Nobody knows that's what the plan is.

01:09:53.405 --> 01:09:56.446
Nobody is thinking about this from that perspective.

01:09:56.506 --> 01:10:08.150
But it is very curious that this guy has a script wherein he's telling you that the second time you get exposed to it, no matter how it is, could potentially be very bad.

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.740
I mean, this is gosh awful.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.840
Stop lying!

01:10:17.062 --> 01:10:25.965
Oh, so high initially in the Hubei province and in Wuhan because the people there have been exposed to coronaviruses for years.

01:10:26.485 --> 01:10:33.688
And yet the national vaccine program that was mandatory, a widespread vaccine program, only got started on December 1st.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:35.889
So, you know, we've got people that are...

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:42.414
The widespread vaccination program in China only got started in 2020 or 2019.

01:10:43.375 --> 01:10:44.696
That's a pretty bizarre thing.

01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:51.421
Exposed to this virus while their bodies still has adjuvants from the vaccines in them.

01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:53.823
In many cases, multiple adjuvants.

01:10:54.424 --> 01:11:03.511
Wait, so you're telling me that James Lyons Weiler is aware that the Chinese started mandatorily vaccinating people at the same time

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.922
that this outbreak is starting.

01:11:09.262 --> 01:11:20.305
And so it's not even remotely on his radar that maybe the disease that he's seeing is from this new mass vaccination campaign that was just started.

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:29.087
Instead, he's saying that these people have adjuvants in their body from these vaccines and therefore are reacting to the virus.

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:30.527
Do you hear this?

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:38.466
This is March, 2020, one of the heroes of the CHD movement.

01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:43.529
One of the guys that regularly is on stage at their biggest events.

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:52.075
He was at the bus in Pittsburgh and gave a talk about he was the guy who found the fear and cleavage site first.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:55.057
I am not joking around here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:55.537 --> 01:11:57.058
These traders are visible.

01:11:58.436 --> 01:12:05.599
And their track record goes all the way back to being in high-resolution photographs with Brandy Vaughn.

01:12:07.659 --> 01:12:11.681
Wait a minute, so starting in December they were vaccinated with which vaccine?

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.790
They just started a national mandatory vaccine program.

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:17.551
There's a new law that- For this novel coronavirus?

01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:18.251
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:18.531 --> 01:12:20.572
No, just for, just for vaccination programs.

01:12:21.273 --> 01:12:22.413
So it's really weird, right?

01:12:22.453 --> 01:12:27.335
That the Chinese never had a mandatory vaccine program until the year that the pandemic started.

01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:31.257
It's really interesting that a similar thing happened in Italy, isn't it?

01:12:31.297 --> 01:12:35.098
The year before that they just started vaccinating old people.

01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:37.579
Isn't it interesting?

01:12:38.219 --> 01:12:42.121
The military started vaccinating old people in Italy the year before the pandemic.

01:12:42.714 --> 01:12:44.136
and nobody wants to talk about it.

01:12:58.072 --> 01:13:05.237
actually, Sinovax, actually in the 2000s did a vaccine safety phase one trial on humans.

01:13:05.417 --> 01:13:06.737
They did a vaccine trial on humans.

01:13:07.118 --> 01:13:08.759
I think they had 45 participants.

01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:19.806
I've never seen a phase two or a phase three, but my initial suspicion, because the mortality was so high, I couldn't believe that a simple coronavirus could possibly lead to such high mortality and morbidity

01:13:20.666 --> 01:13:22.907
And people are saying, we can't trust from China what's going on.

01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:23.848
No, it was real.

01:13:24.408 --> 01:13:28.611
And if it was that high, what possibly could have caused it?

01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:45.921
And I suspected that perhaps the Chinese had, on December 1st, started a secret phase two or three clinical trial in Hubei province with SARS coronavirus, setting people up, unbeknownst to them, for this pathogenic priming, aka immune enhancement.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.403
I'm not sure if that's real or not.

01:13:48.683 --> 01:13:50.745
That is absolutely it, Pete.

01:13:50.905 --> 01:14:04.836
If you are recruited by the Pentagon, if you are recruited by a national security van that shows up at your house with a document that, okay, if you accept this folder, now you're on the team, well, then this is how you act.

01:14:05.576 --> 01:14:06.577
Absolutely.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.598
But I know they didn't do that in Italy.

01:14:09.038 --> 01:14:10.619
So Italy has high morbidity.

01:14:11.039 --> 01:14:12.440
They didn't do it in Italy.

01:14:13.261 --> 01:14:15.702
They absolutely did do it in Italy.

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:17.983
Yet he says they know that they didn't.

01:14:18.104 --> 01:14:19.985
Wow, that is phenomenal.

01:14:20.045 --> 01:14:22.626
It's most likely to get sick and die here.

01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:29.570
There's a linear relationship between your age and your risk of morbid serious illness, critical illness and death.

01:14:32.977 --> 01:14:44.207
Is that mainly because older people are more likely to have cardiovascular or respiratory problems and because they're more likely to have immune issues?

01:14:44.227 --> 01:14:53.776
I think that's probably you know a big part of it because if you have a cardiovascular issue you have like a 10% chance of mortality.

01:14:54.136 --> 01:14:56.758
If you have diabetes you have a 6% chance of mortality.

01:14:56.798 --> 01:14:57.739
What are we doing here in the United

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.280
Listen to these figures.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.864
A 10% chance of dying if you have heart issues from COVID.

01:15:04.424 --> 01:15:06.066
That is some shit.

01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:07.607
Now, we could go on.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:09.048
This video is very long.

01:15:09.068 --> 01:15:09.909
It doesn't end.

01:15:09.929 --> 01:15:12.991
It is the same amount of nonsense.

01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:13.852
I could keep it going.

01:15:16.454 --> 01:15:21.295
But the point of this, and the title of this, is The Danger of Following Charlatans.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:24.036
And now, this one is kind of an obvious one.

01:15:24.096 --> 01:15:25.596
Again, it's March 18th, 2020.

01:15:26.316 --> 01:15:35.359
There's no way in hell he can be this certain about this many things about the molecular and biological aspects of this novel pathogen unless he was given a script.

01:15:35.839 --> 01:15:41.020
And it's very likely he was given a script because of his track record before the pandemic.

01:15:42.887 --> 01:15:51.473
Now, associating with this charlatan is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and CHD, and ICANN, and all the people that are in pictures with him.

01:15:52.053 --> 01:15:54.255
All the people that support IPAC.

01:15:54.695 --> 01:15:56.116
That's all the same garbage.

01:15:56.357 --> 01:15:57.918
It's all the same half measures.

01:15:58.538 --> 01:16:03.001
And it is no different than the other people that have stepped in front of Brandy's language.

01:16:04.222 --> 01:16:12.008
Now, five years, six years later, we have the lab leak story being put on Glenn Beck.

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:18.575
and being promoted on Peter McCullough's substack by Charles Rixey.

01:16:19.356 --> 01:16:22.160
And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that it's all one show.

01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:49.729
James Lyons Weiler is no different than Meryl Nass, is no different than Mary Holland, is no different than Pierre Cory, is no different than Robert Malone, is no different than Jessica Rose, is no different than Denny Rancourt, is no different than Nick Hudson, is no different than any of these people who have been on stage around the world and on more than a thousand podcasts in the last four years, parading around, pretending to be leaders in a movement

01:16:51.075 --> 01:17:01.824
When the truth can be summarized very simply as saying there is no safe vaccine, there wasn't before the pandemic, there certainly isn't now, that they've rolled out transfection and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:02.365
Done.

01:17:06.408 --> 01:17:12.954
Now the danger of following these charlatans is that we can be discredited because we've followed them.

01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:24.465
We were fooled into solving this mystery and we have accepted all of the monsters of this mystery as a result of their flawless performance.

01:17:26.787 --> 01:17:34.353
And it is very important that we explain to our kids how this happened and how visible it is in their own track records.

01:17:35.745 --> 01:17:45.606
because the other side of this narrative that still thinks that it's probably just a natural phenomenon and that RNA pandemics are a natural phenomenon.

01:17:46.943 --> 01:17:50.165
They can see through the people on our side.

01:17:50.445 --> 01:17:52.246
They can see through them very easily.

01:17:52.306 --> 01:17:54.807
They have seen through them already years ago.

01:17:55.447 --> 01:18:00.210
And so while we are being misled to believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:13.196
and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Pierre Cory and Jessica Rose and Brett Weinstein have come to save us, the other side already understands these people as charlatans.

01:18:15.643 --> 01:18:20.205
Think about how many of these organizations have directly promoted this fraud.

01:18:22.206 --> 01:18:25.107
And ignored me, despite knowing who I am.

01:18:25.407 --> 01:18:28.188
And ignored Brandy, despite knowing who she is.

01:18:28.248 --> 01:18:36.271
And more importantly, the biological truths that we were able to codify, they ignore with a passion.

01:18:37.152 --> 01:18:42.554
While promoting an absolute monkey like Brett Weinstein.

01:18:44.744 --> 01:18:45.905
That's what this is.

01:18:45.985 --> 01:18:47.646
That's what this performance is.

01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:51.508
You should see it as the worst and most macabre dinner theater ever.

01:18:51.988 --> 01:19:01.533
That ignores everything that Brandy was able to say, ignores everything that I was able to learn and say, and will continue to do so because that's how we are governed.

01:19:01.693 --> 01:19:08.777
Hey everyone, as you all know, I enjoy debunking charlatans more than just about anything else, and today we have a two-for-one.

01:19:09.137 --> 01:19:15.180
We will be looking at Brett and Eric Weinstein, the self-appointed leaders of the intellectual dark web.

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.282
I've never debunked brothers before, so let's have some fun with it.

01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:21.184
Again, in case you've never heard the term before,

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:50.265
Important thing to remember is that this guy's got four thousand four million subscribers on YouTube and this video after four months Has been seen more than 1.5 million times That's a lot more coverage than Peter McCullough's sub stack is getting that's a lot more coverage than Robert Malone's sub stack is getting and this guy is directly connected to Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:50.365
And

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.143
and so could directly discredit him.

01:19:56.464 --> 01:19:58.546
Watch, because it ain't pretty.

01:19:58.566 --> 01:20:06.337
These guys are prominent members of the so-called intellectual dark web, the term actually having been coined by Eric himself.

01:20:06.657 --> 01:20:11.644
The group of people I am increasingly hanging out with is the intellectual dark web, which is emerging.

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:18.365
The dark web, of course, being the place where people hire hitmen and watch kiddie porn, so it's not really the most sparkling connotation.

01:20:18.725 --> 01:20:24.810
But the deeper down the rabbit hole you go with these two, the seedier and more repulsive they seem, so it is quite fitting.

01:20:25.331 --> 01:20:30.395
Now, if you've seen some of my recent debunks on Terrence Howard, you've heard me talk about Eric a bit already.

01:20:30.735 --> 01:20:36.741
Well, there's a lot more to discuss here today, including a special guest to help me debunk his theory of geometric unity.

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:40.965
But let's start with younger brother Brett and then pivot to big boy Eric after that.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:46.009
Brett has a doctorate in evolutionary biology and taught at Evergreen State College for 15 years.

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:51.231
He was catapulted to prominence in 2017 due to an incident on campus.

01:20:51.651 --> 01:20:53.634
Here's the popular version of the story.

01:20:54.094 --> 01:21:03.024
A protest had been held every year called Day of Absence, where minority students and faculty stayed off campus to make a statement about racial issues.

01:21:03.465 --> 01:21:07.810
In 2017, it was requested that white students and faculty leave campus instead,

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:09.651
for that year's Day of Absence.

01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:15.373
Brett vocally protested this idea, saying that you can't force people off campus just for being white.

01:21:15.813 --> 01:21:28.138
As a result, liberal SJW students threatened Brett with baseball bats, the media erupted with a story about reverse racism, and Brett became a hero overnight by standing up for marginalized white people everywhere.

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:30.899
Of course, the reality is totally different.

01:21:31.139 --> 01:21:38.964
The Day of Absence had always been a voluntary activity where all students could attend workshops and discussions of their choosing.

01:21:39.284 --> 01:21:40.584
And this year was no different.

01:21:40.845 --> 01:21:43.606
It was simply that the locations of these discussions had changed

01:21:43.919 --> 01:21:54.305
with the off-campus site only able to accommodate 200 people, making it obvious that it was not expected for all white students to attend, nor had all of the minority students participated in the past.

01:21:54.685 --> 01:22:04.091
None of it had ever been school-sanctioned, nobody was coercing white people off-campus or making them feel unwelcome, and nobody threatened Brett with baseball bats.

01:22:04.491 --> 01:22:24.243
Brett totally exaggerated these events in his own correspondence, distorted the context surrounding those who were protesting a full six weeks after the day of absence regarding separate campus events, and instead went on Fox News with Tucker Carlson to play the victim in a story that reeks of the exact same vibe as the war on Christmas.

01:22:24.623 --> 01:22:29.126
This year, student activists demanded that all white people leave campus or else.

01:22:29.587 --> 01:22:29.987
Listen.

01:22:30.854 --> 01:22:33.143
Listen to his lisp, please.

01:22:33.424 --> 01:22:35.853
Listen to the way that he pronounces his words.

01:22:36.721 --> 01:22:39.823
Oh my gosh, this is like something out of another country.

01:22:40.463 --> 01:22:55.893
Because of the Fox piece, enraged neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen descended onto the campus, repeatedly driving by and shooting guns into the air, sending in bomb threats, and as a result, the school's graduation had to be moved off-site due to safety concerns.

01:22:56.354 --> 01:23:06.000
Brett sued the school for $3.8 million, settled for half a million and his resignation, and promptly began his career as a podcaster and darling of the right.

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:10.066
I'm troubled by what this implies about the current state of the left.

01:23:10.426 --> 01:23:11.287
What you think?

01:23:11.668 --> 01:23:12.528
What you think?

01:23:13.109 --> 01:23:14.410
What you think?

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:17.172
Where else have we seen this story before?

01:23:17.733 --> 01:23:31.785
Ah, yes, Jordan Peterson, frustrated academic taking a stand against PC culture, cartoonishly fabricating the implications of Bill C-16 to manufacture some kind of authoritarianism to rage against.

01:23:32.265 --> 01:23:44.320
Leveraging the blowback and riding the conservative news cycle to launch himself towards a lucrative commentating career, hiding behind a false flag of free speech absolutism, it's all here, beat for beat.

01:23:44.807 --> 01:24:03.679
Brett, like Jordan, played the reluctant martyr and victim of nasty liberal academia, knowing full well that he was distorting the facts, putting students and faculty in real physical danger, many of whom were targeted with harassment and death threats from white nationalists, and he did it all anyway.

01:24:04.019 --> 01:24:09.423
He allowed Tucker to state that white people were being forced off campus, which was a lie.

01:24:09.563 --> 01:24:14.126
The core demand is that all people of your skin color leave the campus.

01:24:14.386 --> 01:24:23.673
He pretended protests were all about a leaked email of his rather than about the treatment of two black students by campus police and other social issues, which was a lie.

01:24:23.994 --> 01:24:27.736
And he kept amplifying these lies on Twitter well after the interview.

01:24:28.157 --> 01:24:39.366
Thus begins the story of Brett Weinstein, a demagogue from the start, stoking the fires of anti-woke conservative hatred for personal gain with no remorse whatsoever.

01:24:40.026 --> 01:24:43.409
Now on to the actual science denial, since that's the real focus here.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:53.536
During and shortly following his departure from academia, Brett gained notoriety through a series of appearances on, where the hell else, Joe Rogan's podcast.

01:24:53.976 --> 01:24:59.781
Having his web presence sufficiently amplified by these appearances enabled him to monetize something of his own.

01:25:00.101 --> 01:25:04.144
So Brett began dishing out consistently garbage conspiratorial takes

01:25:04.562 --> 01:25:12.770
about everything under the sun on his own Dark Horse podcast that he hosts with his wife Heather Haying, who also taught biology at Evergreen.

01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:21.458
Much of their rhetoric capitalizes on a perceived intellectualization of baseless anti-establishment talking points, which we will highlight where relevant.

01:25:22.038 --> 01:25:24.861
So what are the main topics he needs to be exposed for?

01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:27.704
Here's what's on the menu for the Brett half of the video.

01:25:29.065 --> 01:25:32.047
Why I'm showing this to you is because this is on YouTube.

01:25:32.287 --> 01:25:35.969
It's on a very big channel called Professor Dave Explains.

01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:37.710
And he's not a great guy.

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.952
You know, like, he's very left.

01:25:40.092 --> 01:25:42.413
And a lot of things are going to be quite awful.

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:45.615
And his whole take on the pandemic is awful.

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:47.656
But he does debunk a lot of things.

01:25:47.736 --> 01:25:48.557
And he's a clever guy.

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:50.358
And he makes a really sharp video.

01:25:50.758 --> 01:25:56.242
And nothing he says here, as far as I can tell, is that far off, which, again,

01:25:57.384 --> 01:26:02.065
Understand what that sets us up for if Brett is on our team.

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:07.866
Understand what that sets us up for if Sasha Latupova is on our team.

01:26:07.926 --> 01:26:09.907
That means Soph is on our team.

01:26:10.407 --> 01:26:15.168
If Alex Jones is on our team, that's what we're being set up for.

01:26:15.668 --> 01:26:18.708
And on the other side, this is how easy it is.

01:26:19.649 --> 01:26:20.809
Yes, it's delicious.

01:26:21.991 --> 01:26:43.224
But it's a giant vulnerability in our Health and Human Services Secretary, in our NIH Director nominee, and in all of our populist right movement, which somehow or another is being led by people like Brett and McKernan and McCullough and Bannon.

01:26:46.138 --> 01:26:50.100
First up, Brett's attempt at revolutionizing all of medical science.

01:26:50.561 --> 01:26:58.986
According to Brett, and also his brother Eric, Brett had an astounding insight about telomeres that was stolen from him to win a Nobel Prize.

01:26:59.426 --> 01:27:03.068
To get some context, let's first briefly discuss what telomeres are.

01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:09.072
Telomeres are sections of DNA that cap every chromosome in almost all animal species.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:27.111
The evolutionary impetus for this is that every time DNA gets replicated prior to cell division, because of the way that replicative enzymes anneal to the template strand, the last few bases can't be read, so the new complementary strand is necessarily a few dozen nucleotides shorter than the template strand.

01:27:27.491 --> 01:27:29.112
This poses an obvious problem,

01:27:29.392 --> 01:27:40.018
because as incredibly long as chromosomes are, with many millions of base pairs, thousands of cycles of replication and cell division would eventually result in important genetic information being lost.

01:27:40.199 --> 01:27:52.486
Now, this is a problem for a number of reasons that I don't want to go into, and I don't want to debunk Professor Dave too much, but he's really revealing how little he knows versus what he has read and memorized.

01:27:54.327 --> 01:28:01.250
All of the cells in your body, the vast majority of them are like, I don't know, 20 cell divisions from the egg or something like that.

01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.111
It ain't that far.

01:28:02.671 --> 01:28:11.035
So we're not talking about thousands of replication events here in the grand scheme of development and maintenance of us as a pattern integrity.

01:28:11.075 --> 01:28:13.316
And even in the places where we are talking about

01:28:14.176 --> 01:28:16.077
um, constant cell division.

01:28:16.778 --> 01:28:19.839
It's a different, it's not quite what he's talking about.

01:28:19.879 --> 01:28:22.341
Yes, this makes sense from a cartoon perspective.

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:25.802
Yes, it makes sense from a cartoon perspective.

01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:30.265
But the vast majority of DNA translation is partial.

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.206
It's not copying all of it.

01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:39.711
And so if telomeres have some function when it is all copied, I guess that's possible.

01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:43.952
But the rationale is simply one of cartoon drawings.

01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:52.155
Well, if we draw and we open up the double helix and we start to replicate, I just don't see how that works.

01:28:52.215 --> 01:28:53.455
There's some problem there.

01:28:55.066 --> 01:29:01.891
And so we've done a lot of indirect testing that we say gives us some insight into the fact that this might be an issue.

01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:08.935
But I still don't see this as being an exhaustive explanation for what telomeres are.

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:15.940
And so although he's dunking on Brett, it would feel like he's kind of dunking on him in a kind of disingenuous way.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.223
Neither of them know what telomeres really do.

01:29:20.717 --> 01:29:22.880
and therefore new cells that can't survive.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:38.418
Evolution stumbled upon a solution in the form of telomeres, which are around 5 to 50... I mean, evolution stumbled upon a solution, which was to put a bunch of noise at the end, and that's just how he's going to explain it, and he's certain of it.

01:29:38.478 --> 01:29:40.460
That's what I find a big failure here.

01:29:42.857 --> 01:30:10.412
The purpose of them is to act as long strands of non-coding DNA to allow repeated replication, so that nothing bad happens as the tips are continually eroded during replication, and an enzyme called telomerase, when expressed, is constantly at work adding more nucleotides to the ends of each strand.

01:30:10.765 --> 01:30:13.346
to keep the telomeres intact as long as possible.

01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:19.490
If the telomeres are lost completely, further replication can begin to erode actual coding DNA.

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:22.972
All kinds of problems occur, and this is called senescence.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:25.353
And that is nothing to do with it.

01:30:25.373 --> 01:30:28.955
It's a correlation at best, and it's not even a good correlation.

01:30:29.015 --> 01:30:38.480
So again, here he is giving you a dumb, simple explanation with a high degree of certainty that's simply not, it's not warranted.

01:30:39.542 --> 01:30:43.285
Although he is dunking on Brett, I still don't think he's doing it very well.

01:30:44.326 --> 01:30:46.128
Okay, so that's what telomeres are.

01:30:46.388 --> 01:30:48.970
What's Brett's big groundbreaking discovery?

01:30:49.178 --> 01:30:54.340
We actually have a kind of concern about pharmaceuticals very generally.

01:30:54.380 --> 01:31:07.425
And this arises from the fact that in my graduate work, as many of you who are longtime fans of the podcast will know, my graduate work, I happened onto what I believe is a flaw in the drug safety system.

01:31:07.585 --> 01:31:12.107
Now, what I want you to hear very carefully, listening right now to me, what I say.

01:31:12.207 --> 01:31:16.189
Yesterday on Brett Weinstein's podcast, he again revisited this.

01:31:17.009 --> 01:31:45.829
this little discovery and then specifically for some shitty reason that I can't understand other than he must watch our shows he decided to specifically cite Vioxx as an example of a drug that passed safety testing but shouldn't have and the reason why it passed safety testing was because of the flaw in the safety testing system that he identified in grad school

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:56.417
Why on earth, of all the things he could have said statins, he said Vioxx yesterday.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.742
We are shaking them, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:01.843 --> 01:32:05.986
We are shaking them because we are at the brick wall.

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.409
The illusion is about to collapse.

01:32:11.161 --> 01:32:13.603
and they're making admissions on a daily basis.

01:32:14.444 --> 01:32:31.318
I published this flaw and the flaw basically amounts to the mice that are often used for things like drug safety testing and other experiments having been accidentally evolutionarily modified by the breeding protocol that is used to produce them so that their telomeres, which are these

01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:39.423
repetitive sequences at the ends of chromosomes have been elongated tremendously, and this has potentially very large impacts.

01:32:39.843 --> 01:32:51.530
Effectively, these animals have a capacity to repair their tissues, so that if you poison them, but you don't outright kill them, they actually have an extremely good capacity to fix themselves, whereas we have a limited capacity, so they're bad models.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:02.348
Yep, Brett says that because lab mice have longer telomeres than wild mice, all the drug testing on them is invalid and all the drugs in the world are potentially dangerous.

01:33:02.849 --> 01:33:05.411
There is so much stupidity to unpack here.

01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:09.274
First, and the most glaringly obvious problem with this logic,

01:33:09.674 --> 01:33:23.946
is that all drugs go through clinical trials on human subjects before going to market, so it's mice first, then other non-rodent animal species, then humans, prior to going to market, always.

01:33:24.747 --> 01:33:28.749
This fact alone renders this entire idea irrelevant and idiotic.

01:33:29.129 --> 01:33:32.851
We know what drugs do to people before people can buy them.

01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:38.934
So even if lab mice were somehow more resistant to some toxicity, we would catch it in other test subjects.

01:33:39.634 --> 01:33:43.956
Second, telomere length is just barely even relevant to what Brett is talking about.

01:33:44.236 --> 01:33:46.778
He's talking about toxicity and tissue repair.

01:33:47.198 --> 01:33:53.461
All telomeres do is prolong the duration of time that cell division can occur prior to the onset of senescence.

01:33:53.861 --> 01:34:03.067
All they do is, and that's probably very wrong, but he says it with a comical amount of certainty, and since he's dunking on bread, I'm going to let him.

01:34:03.827 --> 01:34:08.430
They aren't some magic shield from every kind of deleterious biological process.

01:34:08.891 --> 01:34:11.892
Telomere shortening isn't even the only cause of senescence.

01:34:12.473 --> 01:34:15.875
Telomere length also does not correlate linearly with lifespan.

01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:19.738
Mice have longer telomeres than humans do, and we live way longer than them.

01:34:20.178 --> 01:34:24.942
And lab mice don't have uniquely long telomeres in the first place, other species have longer ones.

01:34:25.363 --> 01:34:39.254
But most importantly, as any biologist knows, tissue degradation occurs via so many different mechanisms, given that there are so many types of tissues, from neural tissue to muscular tissue and so forth, all of this having indeed

01:34:39.614 --> 01:34:42.957
So it's kind of contradictory to what he just said a minute ago.

01:34:43.017 --> 01:34:45.799
The telomeres do this and telomeres do that, right?

01:34:45.939 --> 01:34:47.080
It's funny.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.941
Very little to do with telomeres.

01:34:49.622 --> 01:34:58.968
Telomere length does not have any impact on gene expression, its products, or its regulation, nor how toxic agents interact with the products of gene expression.

01:34:59.409 --> 01:35:04.793
A toxin that inhibits enzymatic function is not magically neutralized by telomeres.

01:35:05.293 --> 01:35:10.234
Telomeres are relevant to studies on aging, and also certain kinds of cancers, but that's about it.

01:35:10.695 --> 01:35:17.837
This whole thing is just an erroneous observation extrapolated to something totally baseless, drenched in anti-pharma sentiment.

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:19.637
It gets much worse though.

01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:33.021
Brett pretends that this absolute nothingburger of a scientific claim was so astonishing that it was suppressed by the establishment, and then subsequently stolen by a prominent researcher who used it to earn her Nobel Prize.

01:35:33.581 --> 01:35:45.753
Brett likes to retain a facade of humility whenever possible, so he needs his big brother to take the reins with this accusation, as well as generally painting Brett as some kind of mythical hero genius, and Eric does not disappoint.

01:35:46.061 --> 01:35:55.568
In Brett's case, you probably know him, if you know him at all, as the heroic professor who stood up against what can only be described, I swear I'm not making this up, as a Maoist insurrection.

01:35:55.628 --> 01:35:57.970
Can you hear how much they turned the bass up?

01:35:58.030 --> 01:36:00.312
Like, seriously, I'm sorry.

01:36:00.852 --> 01:36:05.716
If I wanted to boost the bass, I could boost the bass and I could make it sound just like Brett Weinstein if I wanted to.

01:36:05.776 --> 01:36:09.438
I could even turn the mid up and then I could really have a great voice.

01:36:09.478 --> 01:36:10.859
Hello, welcome to the show.

01:36:10.919 --> 01:36:12.381
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:36:13.081 --> 01:36:16.565
But I leave all my knobs set right in the middle, which is really funny.

01:36:22.219 --> 01:36:28.582
Yes, he swears he's not making up the dumb thing he made up, a Maoist insurrection.

01:36:29.102 --> 01:36:33.744
Maoism, of course, being a form of communism marked by armed insurgency.

01:36:34.124 --> 01:36:45.909
The students at Evergreen were total Maoists with the way they had to hide in their dorms from actually armed neo-Nazis that Brett invited to their campus with his Tucker Carlson appearance.

01:36:46.389 --> 01:36:48.870
Good God, what a pretentious douchebag.

01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:52.613
Part of what happened is that you are now distorting the history of science.

01:36:53.273 --> 01:36:59.157
You have a place in the history of science that you are not taking up, you are not advocating for.

01:36:59.198 --> 01:37:01.479
There's something that you don't like about this.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.361
Well, that's laughable.

01:37:03.481 --> 01:37:05.382
Brett has published two papers.

01:37:05.822 --> 01:37:08.885
He's contributed essentially nothing to the field of biology.

01:37:09.205 --> 01:37:09.925
He's a teacher.

01:37:10.226 --> 01:37:18.572
But this is Eric's favorite story to tell about his brother and himself, the revolutionary geniuses who got unfairly swept under the rug.

01:37:19.139 --> 01:37:31.438
I know that it happened and I know that it got buried and I know that it's part of what I'm calling the distributed idea suppression complex because quite frankly you were not the only person who was a part of the story.

01:37:32.051 --> 01:37:34.693
Gee, can you guess who else Eric is referring to?

01:37:35.054 --> 01:37:37.015
These two are absolutely shameless.

01:37:37.356 --> 01:37:40.038
Speaking of which, here comes the shameless accusation.

01:37:40.438 --> 01:37:50.847
For context, Carol Greider is a molecular biologist who discovered telomerase as a grad student in the 80s, and in general pioneered much of the early research on telomeres.

01:37:51.263 --> 01:37:57.625
Carol, we are stunned to find that our paper was turned away without review from Nature.

01:37:58.025 --> 01:37:58.845
Without review?

01:37:58.885 --> 01:37:59.646
Without review.

01:38:00.366 --> 01:38:01.246
We need your help.

01:38:01.966 --> 01:38:06.688
Can I send you the paper and have you look at it?"

01:38:06.828 --> 01:38:07.628
And she says, yes.

01:38:07.688 --> 01:38:08.628
And I send her the paper.

01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:21.112
And she sends back the paper with an unbelievable number of intense criticisms that are not sensible.

01:38:21.664 --> 01:38:28.169
Not sensible, which is code for Carroll explaining to Brett how his paper sucks and him not wanting to accept reality.

01:38:28.509 --> 01:38:41.439
You can see for yourself on his paper, published in 2002, where he asserts that telomere shortening is responsible for all tissue degradation, ignoring that there are hundreds of tissue types, each with their own aging dynamic.

01:38:41.939 --> 01:38:47.263
This is why when Experimental Gerontology sent the paper to Carroll to review, she panned it again.

01:38:47.643 --> 01:38:51.046
She was in line for a Nobel Prize, that was well understood.

01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:57.553
I didn't want to accuse a leading light of the field of not- Okay, this is exactly why I got angry with you at the beginning of the podcast, you moron.

01:38:57.893 --> 01:38:58.614
No, no offense.

01:38:59.214 --> 01:39:00.936
You were in line for a Nobel Prize.

01:39:01.016 --> 01:39:01.736
Yeah!

01:39:01.756 --> 01:39:06.201
Does Eric think they give away Nobel Prizes like class participation trophies?

01:39:06.521 --> 01:39:08.263
The guy is beyond delusional.

01:39:08.703 --> 01:39:15.086
Carol discovered telomerase and is the primary pioneer of telomere research in general.

01:39:15.506 --> 01:39:17.667
Brett is a nobody who did nothing.

01:39:18.348 --> 01:39:25.511
Oh, what if this thing in mice is not something you get a Nobel for, and it has nothing to do with what Carol got hers for?

01:39:25.972 --> 01:39:26.672
Insanity.

01:39:27.054 --> 01:39:38.519
I contact her and I discover through talking to her that she and Mike are about to publish their paper on the long telomeres of laboratory mice.

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:42.481
So this is the delta between wild type and laboratory mice.

01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:42.922
Yeah.

01:39:43.982 --> 01:39:46.723
And I'm shocked because she's told me they're keeping it in house.

01:39:47.304 --> 01:39:48.544
I'm disturbed.

01:39:49.845 --> 01:39:52.346
This was my hypothesis that you were testing.

01:39:54.602 --> 01:40:05.192
I should probably be an author on this paper, but at the very least, I need to be an acknowledgment in this paper so that I can go back and point to it and say that was- It changes everything that it was a prediction.

01:40:05.272 --> 01:40:07.134
It wasn't just something that was stumbled upon.

01:40:07.474 --> 01:40:08.195
Absolutely.

01:40:09.028 --> 01:40:12.310
Yes, Brett is accusing Carroll of stealing his work.

01:40:12.671 --> 01:40:22.437
His work that was published in 2002, when in fact Carroll published a paper on varying telomere length in mice in 2000, and even alluded to it in another paper in 1995.

01:40:22.478 --> 01:40:22.638
Whoops.

01:40:24.739 --> 01:40:25.860
awarded the Nobel Prize.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.844
Carol Greider, Elizabeth Blackburn, and Shostak.

01:40:30.245 --> 01:40:47.422
What Carol Greider does with her Nobel lecture, right, Nobel lecture being the biggest lecture a scientist will ever give, the lecture that- and filmed- and filmed, is she delivers a paper in which she very oddly has now embraced my entire

01:40:48.852 --> 01:41:12.021
uh set of hypotheses about the effect she has come over from the comparison between the paper of mine that she panned and said didn't make any sense she is now a total convert to the idea that senescence across the body is being caused by hayflick limits that are telomere based okay and brett outs himself here he backpedals from tissue degradation and all kinds of other unfounded claims

01:41:12.381 --> 01:41:17.608
to connections between telomeres and senescence, which nobody disputes and were already well known.

01:41:18.068 --> 01:41:29.983
This is what frauds do, they make bold, sweeping claims using specific keywords, and then they rein in these claims to reference established science with the same keywords, in order to pretend that it vindicates them.

01:41:30.339 --> 01:41:41.306
The Electric Universe grifters use this playbook when they make up bullshit about electricity powering the galaxy, and then point at Birkeland currents as though they substantiate any of the bullshit they spew.

01:41:41.746 --> 01:41:48.270
As anyone can plainly see, this narrative attracts the people that it attracts because of the anti-establishment sentiment.

01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:58.138
These podcast episodes are littered with comments from people praising Brett for his unparalleled brilliance, just because he says a bunch of words they don't understand.

01:41:58.518 --> 01:41:59.299
It's ridiculous.

01:41:59.579 --> 01:42:01.921
Do they look for interviews with actual accomplices?

01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:05.604
He can't see the fact that those comments are part of the illusion, right?

01:42:05.704 --> 01:42:08.106
And so maybe he doesn't know.

01:42:08.306 --> 01:42:14.191
My guess is that he probably doesn't know, even though he's used in the same way.

01:42:14.611 --> 01:42:17.253
Mark, I don't know who Hayflick worked for.

01:42:17.273 --> 01:42:18.554
I can't remember anymore.

01:42:18.574 --> 01:42:19.995
Did he work for Howard Tenham?

01:42:33.446 --> 01:42:34.606
And Tennant, is that who it was?

01:42:34.687 --> 01:42:34.967
I don't know.

01:42:34.987 --> 01:42:36.987
...saying when he references scientific concepts.

01:42:37.387 --> 01:42:40.408
The allure is not any kind of alleged scientific achievement.

01:42:40.708 --> 01:42:45.310
It's the story of the underdog, the one who got screwed over by the system... Oh wow, Koprowski.

01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:47.511
He worked for Koprowski at Wittstar?

01:42:47.611 --> 01:42:49.731
Oh my goodness, that's fantastic.

01:42:49.771 --> 01:42:50.912
Sorry I didn't remember that.

01:42:50.992 --> 01:42:53.232
...the corrupt bureaucracies behind it all.

01:42:53.573 --> 01:42:57.814
That's why people are here, and that's the only story the Weinsteins know how to tell.

01:42:58.973 --> 01:43:06.315
This tale continues for Brett, as it did for most of the science-denying charlatans who are popular today, with the onset of the COVID pandemic.

01:43:06.695 --> 01:43:10.256
There are three primary narratives he pushed relentlessly in this realm.

01:43:10.576 --> 01:43:16.417
The first was a cartoonish level of confidence in the lab leak hypothesis with absolutely zero evidence.

01:43:16.797 --> 01:43:23.639
The second was being one of the main players in pushing ivermectin as some kind of preventive measure for COVID, again with zero basis.

01:43:24.099 --> 01:43:29.262
and the third was jumping on the bandwagon of fabricating millions of deaths from COVID vaccines.

01:43:42.288 --> 01:43:47.511
all of the 77th Brigade and all this, they were all pushing the idea that there was a mystery to solve.

01:43:47.551 --> 01:43:48.452
So that's for sure.

01:43:49.072 --> 01:43:50.173
And everybody's in on that.

01:43:50.693 --> 01:43:59.679
Promoting ivermectin was something that I think was promoted above hydroxychloroquine at some point, maybe because hydroxychloroquine does work.

01:43:59.739 --> 01:44:02.641
That was something that Zev Zelenko was using.

01:44:03.461 --> 01:44:07.884
So promoting ivermectin so vigorously as he did without even acknowledging that

01:44:08.524 --> 01:44:12.366
that hydroxychloroquine was out there the year before is strange.

01:44:12.966 --> 01:44:16.007
Pierre Cory having a book about ivermectin is strange.

01:44:16.988 --> 01:44:27.813
Alexandros Marinos in that signal chat with Brett and I pushing ivermectin for a year as well as Elon Musk being a genius and a patriot was also weird.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:33.685
but it's very consistent with what this guy on the left can clearly see Brett did.

01:44:34.265 --> 01:44:39.250
And then finally, remember my argument is, is that they rolled out an incredible number of placebos.

01:44:39.330 --> 01:44:48.639
So the complaining about vaccine deaths can be easily misconstrued as a lie because of the way that they rolled out the transfection.

01:44:48.679 --> 01:44:49.080
So here we go.

01:44:49.645 --> 01:44:50.186
one at a time.

01:44:50.746 --> 01:45:12.727
Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus from China in 2019, plenty of conspiracy theories have circulated as to its origin, contradicting the widely proposed zoonotic origin, meaning arising naturally in animal populations, in this case, bats, and developing virulence in humans through natural evolutionary processes, likely after passing through some intermediate species, such as pangolins.

01:45:13.325 --> 01:45:18.306
The more outlandish of these ideas involved the notion that China deliberately created SARS.

01:45:18.546 --> 01:45:28.168
Now, of course, we know that they could have made the sequence and they could have made as a larger quantity as they wanted to, because that's just synthetic genetic technology.

01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:29.708
That's just recombinant genetics.

01:45:30.428 --> 01:45:41.510
Any pharmaceutical company that produces a biologic would have the necessary infrastructure to grow a great big culture of bacteria and then make a large quantity of a DNA plasmid.

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:52.863
And so if they wanted to find a DNA sequence somewhere and they wanted to spray it everywhere or they wanted their agent in Wuhan to claim to have found it, they could do that.

01:45:52.943 --> 01:46:02.473
And this guy seems to be acutely unaware of what infectious clone means in the virology literature and how they are used to distribute these sequences.

01:46:03.354 --> 01:46:14.998
and fraudulently support the idea of virology in a laboratory, which is really just the transfection of animals and cell culture, which this guy should be sophisticated enough to understand, but apparently doesn't.

01:46:15.478 --> 01:46:26.262
Coronavirus 2 as a bioweapon and released it on the world intentionally, something that has been quite thoroughly refuted via genomic analysis, which would require a whole video unto itself to explain.

01:46:26.502 --> 01:46:36.395
So this guy believes that all the genomic analysis that Kevin McKernan says is real and it's got 18 million sequences is real.

01:46:36.436 --> 01:46:37.317
He believes in all that.

01:46:38.302 --> 01:46:43.206
Far less conspiratorial was the notion that the virus accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan.

01:46:43.666 --> 01:46:50.070
As early as June 2020, far less conspiratorial is that the virus was in a lab and that it was leaked.

01:46:50.110 --> 01:47:00.498
And this is also a very Fauci-esque kind of stance to take, that that means it was still a natural virus if it was found in a bat cave and it just leaked out of a laboratory that happened to have it.

01:47:01.599 --> 01:47:03.160
Wow, this is just, this is...

01:47:07.162 --> 01:47:11.044
Brett was on the record saying he was 90% sure this was the case.

01:47:11.404 --> 01:47:17.606
And that theory was demonized at first, that, oh, it can't, come on, that's conspiracy thinking, that it started in the lab.

01:47:17.646 --> 01:47:21.428
But it certainly is a 50-50, would you say that?

01:47:21.948 --> 01:47:24.089
Oh, it's far more likely than that.

01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:26.910
It's a matter of- This is 2020, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:28.771
This is not by accident.

01:47:28.931 --> 01:47:33.773
No one is in front of us by accident, and definitely not in 2020.

01:47:35.546 --> 01:47:54.474
In fact, it said, I think, in June that the chances that it came from the lab looked... What apparently Professor Dave doesn't understand is that you don't get on Bill Maher by chance, that you don't get promoted by chance, that you don't get in front of the Senate to complain about something that happened at a podunk university by chance.

01:47:57.255 --> 01:47:58.076
To me, to be about 90%.

01:47:59.332 --> 01:48:00.772
This is already ridiculous.

01:48:01.413 --> 01:48:03.353
90% sure based on what?

01:48:03.753 --> 01:48:04.173
A hunch?

01:48:04.573 --> 01:48:05.674
His spidey sense?

01:48:06.134 --> 01:48:09.135
He offers absolutely nothing to substantiate this.

01:48:09.475 --> 01:48:11.095
But it gets so much worse.

01:48:11.555 --> 01:48:18.537
As time passed, he began to reject any data regarding zoonotic origin as a conspiracy from the virology community.

01:48:18.857 --> 01:48:27.479
When any such papers were released, he would pretend they were government lies sent to squash the lab leak truth while people were distracted by the war in Ukraine.

01:48:28.039 --> 01:48:47.382
In conversation with Joe Rogan, he has said even crazier things, like that pandemics emerging from nature are nothing to worry about, fatality during the Spanish flu of a century ago was due to over-prescription of aspirin, he thinks polio is actually due to pesticides, and implies that most viruses are lab leaks.

01:48:47.762 --> 01:48:51.264
claiming that monkey pox shows signs of gain of function research.

01:48:51.364 --> 01:48:52.325
And now you see it.

01:48:53.385 --> 01:48:56.427
He is exactly trapped in the Scooby-Doo.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:59.029
It's just the inversion of where we were trapped.

01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:06.813
And that inverted trap is just as sticky as the one that we were in.

01:49:06.993 --> 01:49:09.535
It's just as compelling as the one that we are in.

01:49:10.055 --> 01:49:13.337
And now you can see that this limited spectrum of debate

01:49:14.517 --> 01:49:17.079
is visible from different angles.

01:49:17.179 --> 01:49:20.081
If you get on the other side of Brett, that's what you see.

01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:21.462
You see what this guy sees.

01:49:21.962 --> 01:49:24.544
If you get on our side of Brett, you see what we see.

01:49:25.024 --> 01:49:31.008
And either way, Brett shouldn't be where he is, except for it is designed that way.

01:49:32.008 --> 01:49:34.170
Because it's one Lollapalooza of liars.

01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:37.012
We're just watching from different stages, from different angles.

01:49:38.573 --> 01:49:40.694
He is just completely off his rocker.

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:49.628
there was a enthusiasm for prescribing aspirin for people who came in with flu symptoms.

01:49:49.868 --> 01:49:53.491
And they were prescribed aspirin in doses that are now known to be deadly.

01:49:54.031 --> 01:49:57.954
It's something like an epidemic of polio that's not really an epidemic of polio.

01:49:57.994 --> 01:50:03.939
You have an epidemic of gypsy moths that are being sprayed for with these toxic pesticides.

01:50:08.186 --> 01:50:10.246
Next up, the Ivermectin debacle.

01:50:10.507 --> 01:50:12.927
This incident is particularly fascinating to me.

01:50:13.327 --> 01:50:20.729
Once COVID vaccines began rolling out, anti-vaxxers were desperately looking for ways to criticize the operation and bypass the vaccines.

01:50:26.511 --> 01:50:35.374
Some suggested that ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, was miraculous in not just killing SARS-CoV-2, but also in preventing infection.

01:50:35.794 --> 01:50:49.698
There is no clinical basis for this assertion, but the most hilarious aspect of this story is that it was adopted by those eager to denigrate the pharmaceutical industry for rolling out what they baselessly decided were ineffective or even harmful vaccines.

01:50:49.878 --> 01:51:17.804
Baselessly, I told you exactly why because they were already a known technology called transfection and this jackass ought to know it So again, Professor Dave is not a good guy But what I want you to see is that this limited spectrum of debate that we are trapped in is not defined by Brett and by and by dr. Drew and by Russell Brand But it is it is what is

01:51:18.982 --> 01:51:24.325
is created by their collective existence and coordinated lying that is the trap.

01:51:25.186 --> 01:51:29.888
You can't see the trap by just paying attention to one individual.

01:51:29.908 --> 01:51:35.091
You have to see how they are represented by the machine as a whole.

01:51:35.131 --> 01:51:48.039
And when you see how Brett is represented by the other side, it starts to become apparent how trapped we are, how impressively set up we are for a tremendous collapse

01:51:49.636 --> 01:52:02.778
where people on the left get undermined, where people on the right get undermined by their collective misunderstanding of how we got here, by their collective misunderstanding of American history and of world history.

01:52:03.679 --> 01:52:17.061
And now everybody in America turns on themselves because they are so incongruently aligned to different charlatans that they think are patriots.

01:52:17.861 --> 01:52:20.002
We are in a desperate situation right now.

01:52:20.022 --> 01:52:29.625
It's meant only to make money when ivermectin is itself a pharmaceutical drug developed initially by Merck, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.

01:52:30.786 --> 01:52:36.668
And actually run by Vincent Racaniello's wife for 20 years.

01:52:39.269 --> 01:52:41.431
was not even any consistency to the narrative.

01:52:41.751 --> 01:52:50.860
Those pushing ivermectin wanted to stick it to the pharmaceutical industry by boycotting their vaccines and throwing their money at a random pharmaceutical drug.

01:52:51.540 --> 01:53:02.871
When medical professionals caught wind of the situation and tried to communicate to the public how there is no basis for presuming that ivermectin has any utility whatsoever in curing COVID or preventing its transmission,

01:53:03.331 --> 01:53:06.752
including Merck themselves, who issued this very statement.

01:53:07.032 --> 01:53:10.552
They were instantly labeled pharma shills trying to shut down.

01:53:10.752 --> 01:53:12.393
Now, of course, this is wonderful, right?

01:53:12.433 --> 01:53:18.554
Because if you watch this and you're a vigorous defender of Brett Weinstein, then you'll say, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true.

01:53:19.054 --> 01:53:24.075
Pierre Kory was censored and these people were censored and these meta studies were censored.

01:53:24.115 --> 01:53:26.195
And so you're going to try and argue with this guy.

01:53:26.215 --> 01:53:29.096
And that's exactly what the limited spectrum of debate does.

01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:37.514
It convinces you that your team is right and that that other team over there is so fricking wrong that I've got to spend all my time arguing with them.

01:53:37.534 --> 01:53:39.134
And that's what this video is.

01:53:39.194 --> 01:53:40.495
It's like an invitation.

01:53:42.216 --> 01:53:42.896
And it's a trap.

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:50.159
A story to maintain pharma profits by people who don't even exercise their own logic to its obvious conclusion.

01:53:50.719 --> 01:53:58.782
Anyone could make the same argument for those trying to push ivermectin, a drug that would earn pharma lots of money if the whole world started taking it.

01:53:59.482 --> 01:54:03.123
Except it's not under patent anymore and it could be made generically.

01:54:03.183 --> 01:54:11.985
See, it's this again, as ham-fisted as the vaccine choice people, this guy is going to be ham-fisted in a lot of ways too.

01:54:12.786 --> 01:54:18.347
Because the goal is to make it easy for both sides to get what they want out of the same content.

01:54:19.801 --> 01:54:22.802
breathtaking example of the hypocrisy of science deniers.

01:54:23.462 --> 01:54:37.786
Never one to miss out on some good old science-based charlatanry, Joe Rogan held an emergency podcast with Brett to get the word out on ivermectin, and he continued to push it relentlessly on his own with the help of various other fraudulent guests.

01:54:38.386 --> 01:54:48.469
Brett and his wife, who, if you recall, are highly skeptical about pharmaceutical drugs because of the mouse telomere thing, took ivermectin on the air on their own podcast.

01:54:48.697 --> 01:54:51.299
and we are a bit skeptical of pills.

01:54:51.499 --> 01:54:52.239
A lot skeptical.

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.820
A lot skeptical of pills.

01:54:54.301 --> 01:55:00.685
Once again, there is no evidence of any kind to suggest that this drug has any utility in curing or preventing COVID.

01:55:01.045 --> 01:55:06.068
There is also no- It's funny he doesn't touch cancer because that's where we are on our side.

01:55:06.108 --> 01:55:11.632
We're supposed to believe that all these doctors have evidence that ivermectin in combination with lots of things can cure cancer.

01:55:12.412 --> 01:55:19.639
This is to suggest that the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus, the excuse for why ivermectin was being promoted as an alternative.

01:55:20.199 --> 01:55:32.091
Brett will use garbage fake studies like this Carvalho paper riddled with typos, which claimed 100% efficacy, and when he gets called out for it, instead of admitting it's garbage, he just says it's a little sloppy.

01:55:32.591 --> 01:55:37.272
There was another large study which had to be retracted due to plagiarism and problems with the raw data.

01:55:37.612 --> 01:55:45.214
The same can be said for any other such papers, which again would require a video unto itself to elucidate, but I'll link to some resources in the description.

01:55:45.634 --> 01:55:54.996
He also still promotes a website called IVMmeta.com, which pretends to have a meta-analysis of ivermectin studies that shows it is overwhelmingly effective.

01:55:55.376 --> 01:56:03.520
In reality, it did things like multiplying together the p-values of every study, including fraudulent studies, cherry-picking endpoints, and so forth.

01:56:03.941 --> 01:56:08.543
And of course, a meta-analysis of garbage papers will provide garbage insight.

01:56:08.783 --> 01:56:09.804
It's as simple as that.

01:56:10.264 --> 01:56:15.186
Bad studies do not suddenly become sound when placed next to a bunch of other bad studies.

01:56:15.527 --> 01:56:17.648
The plural of garbage is not evidence.

01:56:18.428 --> 01:56:22.572
In general, Brett's narrative had long been, why aren't they running trials on this?

01:56:22.952 --> 01:56:31.639
And once large clinical trials were being done on ivermectin, proving that it isn't effective, he just came up with conspiratorial reasons to dismiss every single one of them.

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:41.007
But dodging and lying about clinical data aside, the things Brett says to justify his position from the standpoint of biology are just laughably stupid.

01:56:41.368 --> 01:56:42.849
On his podcast he says this.

01:56:43.117 --> 01:57:04.711
The fact that the drug in question, ivermectin, comes from soil bacteria, it's not a completely synthetic molecule, means that it is likely to be similar to things that one's ancestors have encountered before, and there's therefore a good chance that the body has a reasonably elegant way of dealing with it rather than using some mechanism that's not so great.

01:57:05.509 --> 01:57:11.695
Brett is clearly just taking advantage of negative connotations among the public surrounding the word synthetic.

01:57:12.116 --> 01:57:17.000
Whether a drug is synthetic or naturally occurring is totally meaningless.

01:57:17.041 --> 01:57:25.469
With the exception of the fact that something synthetic will have a certain set of purity and contaminants that the natural one would have different

01:57:25.949 --> 01:57:30.752
Bacteria produce toxins that can kill thousands of humans per milligram.

01:57:31.292 --> 01:57:41.557
Anthrax, the Clostridium tetani toxin which causes tetanus, or the Clostridium botulinum toxin, which is the single most toxic compound known to mankind.

01:57:42.158 --> 01:57:47.520
Only the science-illiterate sector of the public thinks that natural equals good and synthetic equals bad.

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.301
Any scientist knows better.

01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:54.504
But Brett isn't a scientist, and he's deliberately manipulating the public, so this is what he goes with.

01:57:54.844 --> 01:58:04.706
That a molecule never existed until humans made it does not tell us anything about toxicity, and naturally occurring compounds can be made synthetically and they are indistinguishable.

01:58:05.226 --> 01:58:12.248
In the end, this is all just clickbait for anti-vaxxers, which exacerbates vaccine hesitancy, which in turn gets people killed.

01:58:12.728 --> 01:58:17.309
Lots of people who listened to Brett avoided getting vaccinated and died of COVID.

01:58:17.509 --> 01:58:20.332
Dang, that is a bold statement, and that hurts.

01:58:20.452 --> 01:58:21.993
And that's how he's going to go on.

01:58:22.514 --> 01:58:27.458
He's also going to go on with the AIDS denialism, and I don't necessarily need to do that part.

01:58:28.199 --> 01:58:34.785
I just need you to see that Brett's track record reveals to everybody that cares that he is a fraud.

01:58:35.366 --> 01:58:37.868
On the left and the right, they can all see it.

01:58:37.968 --> 01:58:41.151
So the idea that the current Health and Human Services Secretary

01:58:41.872 --> 01:58:50.323
stood in front of and stands to promote this guy, to promote Kevin McKernan, to promote Robert Malone.

01:58:51.243 --> 01:59:02.508
This is all one steady pattern of meddlers that I call traitors that have enabled the national security exercise that was the pandemic to be successful.

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:06.190
That's why all of their track records don't check out.

01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:10.132
That's why they look like nothing but traitors.

01:59:10.752 --> 01:59:16.475
That's why these groups are all, they're all promoting these people and only we see them.

01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:21.869
The vast majority of people in America do not see these meddlers and traitors.

01:59:21.909 --> 01:59:24.695
They are controlling us and not them.

01:59:25.577 --> 01:59:28.843
Instead, they are used as examples of the charlatanism.

01:59:30.276 --> 01:59:32.717
and used to discredit these people.

01:59:32.777 --> 01:59:50.363
You see, this is a dangerous place for us to be when we think that we just won, and Donald Trump is in, and Robert F. Kennedy's in, and soon Jay Bhattacharya is gonna be in, and these people will have all the ammunition they need to completely destroy the reputation of the entire administration.

01:59:52.466 --> 02:00:01.756
The vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise, ladies and gentlemen, and somehow or another, these people are not effectively fighting and they're not effectively sending this message.

02:00:02.357 --> 02:00:04.459
That's why GigaOM Biological ain't gonna stop.

02:00:05.995 --> 02:00:09.738
The lie that they are hiding is this population pyramid.

02:00:10.919 --> 02:00:19.345
It is a biological phenomenon that's been on its way since I graduated from high school in 1990.

02:00:19.885 --> 02:00:24.469
They've known that this was coming and they've been planning to use it as an eclipse.

02:00:25.816 --> 02:00:32.342
to bamboozle the entire population of the world into thinking something happened that did not happen.

02:00:32.542 --> 02:00:40.049
And it is no less than that malevolent because the population pyramids of all Western nations are inverted.

02:00:40.089 --> 02:00:46.055
They know that it's going to collapse, and they know that right now there's going to be an increase in all-cause mortality.

02:00:46.095 --> 02:00:51.280
They've known for a while, and they've been watching the development of social media in order to control that narrative.

02:00:52.403 --> 02:00:53.884
That's what all of this is about.

02:00:53.924 --> 02:00:59.827
We have surrendered our consciousness and it is their prime real estate and they are occupying it with their mythologies.

02:01:00.527 --> 02:01:07.271
They are occupying it with their charlatans, with their fake organizations, with their sabotaged organizations.

02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:09.212
And it is these people who did it to us.

02:01:09.572 --> 02:01:10.553
At least they did it to me.

02:01:11.527 --> 02:01:14.369
There's no epidemiological evidence of spread, ladies and gentlemen.

02:01:14.389 --> 02:01:23.635
There is only an anticipated rise in expected deaths that was sculpted using murder to get some peaks that they could point to and call it evidence of an RNA pandemic.

02:01:25.376 --> 02:01:29.099
The list of the ways that people were murdered is available.

02:01:30.179 --> 02:01:40.226
And the reason why we didn't successfully save any of those people and we still haven't gotten justice for them is because these people are still enacting the dinner theater of the mystery solving exercise.

02:01:41.678 --> 02:01:46.646
Brandy Vaughn is a good clue, and may she rest in peace.

02:01:48.529 --> 02:01:50.211
None of these people will ever mention her.

02:01:50.532 --> 02:01:56.441
None of these people will ever mention the ideas that she mentioned and now I mention, which is intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:01:57.456 --> 02:02:00.720
That's why all these people ignored me and I think that's why they ignored Brandy.

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:05.885
Ladies and gentlemen, we can say it quite succinctly and so I suggest you take this language and run.

02:02:05.905 --> 02:02:07.086
You don't have to mention my name.

02:02:07.126 --> 02:02:09.709
Just tell people and learn and try to figure it out.

02:02:09.789 --> 02:02:13.793
Try to prove it wrong and in the end you will learn.

02:02:14.854 --> 02:02:19.658
There is no safe vaccine and intramuscular injection of medicine is a lie.

02:02:20.339 --> 02:02:21.120
That's what I know.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.401
That's what I've come to understand as the truth.

02:02:23.541 --> 02:02:25.842
Ladies and gentlemen, this is about all the marbles.

02:02:27.503 --> 02:02:29.305
This is for all the marbles.

02:02:31.006 --> 02:02:33.167
And so that's how I'm playing the game.

02:02:34.187 --> 02:02:37.650
If you want to know what happened, you got to fill out a calendar.

02:02:37.710 --> 02:02:38.850
I'm going to make one for you.

02:02:39.971 --> 02:02:42.833
So far every calendar I've made is pretty ugly.

02:02:44.271 --> 02:02:47.613
Because it seems like none of these people were ever playing for our grandchildren.

02:02:48.114 --> 02:02:48.534
None of them.

02:02:49.094 --> 02:02:56.418
They were always enacting the mystery science theater 2020 and they are guilty as guilty can be.

02:02:57.599 --> 02:02:59.000
All the marbles ladies and gentlemen.

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.802
Pretty easy to summarize injection versus ingestion.

02:03:01.842 --> 02:03:02.622
I mean that's easy.

02:03:03.022 --> 02:03:04.203
It's pretty easy to summarize.

02:03:04.263 --> 02:03:06.865
PCR is a fraud as a diagnostic.

02:03:06.905 --> 02:03:08.966
The only thing they can do is make a lot of DNA.

02:03:10.031 --> 02:03:15.474
Because they can make a lot of DNA, that means that they could give it to their agent or their agent could deploy it and find it.

02:03:16.114 --> 02:03:22.897
And that could be done easily with a synthetic recombinant pure quantity that they can make and call an infectious clone or anything else.

02:03:23.798 --> 02:03:28.840
The only bottom line is, is that transfection was a crime and the way they got away with it was releasing placebo.

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:33.082
That's why Professor Dave is so confident that nobody died of the vaccine.

02:03:35.063 --> 02:03:48.028
The real illusion here is endemicity and I'm sure Professor Dave would explain exactly what it is and exactly how it occurs and there would be no biological basis for it in his explanation other than he's damn certain that somebody told him it's true.

02:03:50.151 --> 02:03:51.532
One slide, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:51.592 --> 02:03:54.013
Non-specific PCR tests on a hot background.

02:03:54.133 --> 02:03:55.354
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:03:55.534 --> 02:03:57.095
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:03:57.155 --> 02:03:59.456
Transfecting healthy people was always crime.

02:03:59.756 --> 02:04:03.138
And population pyramid is a real problem.

02:04:03.679 --> 02:04:05.019
Thank you very much for being here.

02:04:05.039 --> 02:04:07.321
This is team worst case scenario.

02:04:08.441 --> 02:04:09.402
I'm certain of it.

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:12.063
Don't let the past be erased.

02:04:12.263 --> 02:04:14.565
Don't let our kids inherit this myth.

02:04:15.811 --> 02:04:23.485
make sure that they inherit the truth from you so that they can pass that on to their grandkids.

02:04:25.308 --> 02:04:26.210
Thanks for being here guys.

02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:27.072
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:06:16.977 --> 02:06:17.798
It's a lab leak.

02:06:18.038 --> 02:06:19.740
I believe it's a lab leak.

02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:21.502
I have no responsibility.

02:06:21.562 --> 02:06:22.383
It's a lab leak.

02:06:23.003 --> 02:06:25.246
It is much more likely it's a lab leak.
