WEBVTT

01:45.220 --> 01:46.381
getting that cut wrong.

01:47.102 --> 01:49.724
Anyway, welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49.744 --> 01:50.684
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

01:50.724 --> 01:52.746
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:52.766 --> 01:59.371
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:00.872 --> 02:03.434
At this show, we try to stay focused on the biology.

02:03.494 --> 02:07.237
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

02:07.337 --> 02:09.419
We know who they are, and we talk to them regularly.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.482
This show is a continuation of yesterday's show.

02:14.662 --> 02:34.230
I am Katniss was first in the chat It is part two I will pick up kind of where we left off with the guess who what and when kind of thing with a different Video or a different audio, excuse me and then I'll finally get to Ian Carroll admitting it and what he exactly admits and then clean up an aisle for

02:35.956 --> 02:39.479
Cleanup in Aisle 4 is something I don't know if we're going to get completely through.

02:39.519 --> 02:41.121
We might just get to the beginning of it.

02:41.281 --> 02:47.967
It's gut-wrenching, it's unbelievable, but it's also very revealing because it shows you what's really going on here.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.449
It shouldn't be underestimated.

02:50.529 --> 02:52.551
We're in big trouble.

02:55.011 --> 02:56.172
There's no other way to say it.

02:56.232 --> 02:57.453
We've been walked into a trap.

02:57.513 --> 02:58.493
The trap is closing.

02:59.514 --> 03:03.117
And I think this show is going to be even better than yesterday's show.

03:03.177 --> 03:04.878
So thank you very much for being here again.

03:04.898 --> 03:10.822
And I hope I will see you in a few minutes if this all works out well.

03:11.883 --> 03:17.327
I'm still trying to get the hang of using the GoPro up there as this alternate camera.

03:18.287 --> 03:29.893
Um, it's this, it's this alternate camera right here, which is actually really fun, but it's added a little, uh, dimension of things that I'm not really totally down with.

03:30.953 --> 03:34.855
Um, and so, uh, sometimes it, sometimes it just is not quite right.

03:34.935 --> 03:36.396
Anyway, I'll get there.

03:36.896 --> 03:37.677
Don't worry about me.

03:38.097 --> 03:39.077
I'll be fine!

03:40.038 --> 03:41.979
Um, just gotta learn my buttons again.

03:42.019 --> 03:46.001
I just have a couple buttons that I'm now using that I wasn't taking advantage of before.

03:46.661 --> 03:53.764
And I actually have a couple more possibilities there that I could build in as I work through this.

03:53.824 --> 03:55.665
So thank you very much for your patience.

03:56.705 --> 03:59.406
And I'll see you again probably in a few minutes.

04:01.027 --> 04:01.947
It's been real fun.

04:02.468 --> 04:08.750
I'm really having a good time now that I have a more positive message for you and for myself every day.

04:09.330 --> 04:10.351
I have hope again.

04:13.933 --> 04:14.993
The truth is good for kids.

04:15.413 --> 04:19.294
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

04:19.714 --> 04:21.375
We want everybody to feel good.

04:21.755 --> 04:23.715
That's not the way life is.

04:27.176 --> 04:29.117
It is definitely Code Brown.

04:29.157 --> 04:34.058
It's Code Cory and Kirsch is what it is in aisle four.

04:34.138 --> 04:35.818
Clean up in aisle four, indeed.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.359
You can tell if someone's lying.

04:40.979 --> 04:42.740
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.266
And I have lied.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.347
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:46.367 --> 04:49.130
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

04:49.230 --> 04:50.271
I try not to be a liar.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.152
I don't want to be a liar.

04:51.712 --> 04:54.435
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:59.127 --> 05:00.208
Don't take Tylenol.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.368
Don't take it.

05:01.608 --> 05:03.069
With Tylenol, don't take it.

05:03.690 --> 05:04.390
Don't take it.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.891
Don't use Tylenol.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.031
Don't take Tylenol.

05:07.312 --> 05:08.912
Don't take Tylenol.

05:09.153 --> 05:10.693
Fight like hell not to take it.

05:10.894 --> 05:11.974
I think you shouldn't take it.

05:12.114 --> 05:13.335
Don't take Tylenol.

05:13.535 --> 05:16.977
The baby goes, gets a shot, they say, here, take a drop of Tylenol.

05:17.057 --> 05:17.978
I've heard that for years.

05:18.038 --> 05:18.838
Take Tylenol.

05:19.518 --> 05:20.539
Don't take Tylenol.

05:20.619 --> 05:22.280
Don't have your baby take Tylenol.

05:22.460 --> 05:23.801
Don't give Tylenol.

05:24.932 --> 05:25.613
to the baby.

05:25.873 --> 05:27.734
Don't give Tylenol to the baby.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.655
Don't give your baby Tylenol.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.297
Don't take Tylenol.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.758
Don't take Tylenol.

05:34.219 --> 05:36.480
Don't take Tylenol.

05:36.821 --> 05:37.441
Don't take it.

05:37.701 --> 05:38.362
Don't take it.

05:39.062 --> 05:41.244
So that's it.

05:41.964 --> 05:43.305
There's nothing much to say.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.207
Don't take Tylenol.

05:45.227 --> 05:46.007
Just don't take it.

05:46.508 --> 05:48.389
And I just say it again.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.971
Don't take Tylenol.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.252
There must be a Bernie supporter somewhere.

06:05.272 --> 06:06.872
Socialism right there, buddy.

06:06.952 --> 06:07.593
Free water.

06:07.713 --> 06:09.173
He's donating it on his own.

06:09.193 --> 06:10.794
Someone else paid for that water bottle.

06:10.814 --> 06:11.514
The government sucks.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.543
There's no free lunch.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.224
There's no free lunch.

06:28.525 --> 06:29.065
Economics 101.

06:29.205 --> 06:32.348
That's your corporation, right?

06:32.428 --> 06:34.490
It's a non-profit called Turning Point USA.

06:34.630 --> 06:35.510
Guns ain't flying.

06:35.671 --> 06:38.053
There's no free lunch.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.614
There's no free lunch.

06:39.634 --> 06:43.777
So can I ask one of you fellas, what is your ideal situation then for guns?

06:43.797 --> 06:44.658
The Constitution.

06:44.698 --> 06:45.719
More freedom.

06:45.759 --> 06:46.720
We're far from it now.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.443
Let's get back to a restoration of individual liberty and states' rights.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.665
More like Texas, less like California.

06:52.925 --> 06:55.167
So you have more of a libertarian viewpoint?

06:55.327 --> 06:57.789
Libertarian, conservative, free market, freedom.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.972
Be in control of your own life and your own destiny.

07:01.412 --> 07:02.493
I don't want Washington, D.C.

07:02.533 --> 07:03.574
to tell me how to live my life.

07:03.594 --> 07:06.097
All right, so can I ask you though, what would you recommend?

07:08.959 --> 07:14.761
You know, environmental issues where like a corporation would... Property rights, if it's public land, they're free to protect it?

07:14.781 --> 07:18.502
Yeah, I think states care more about their public rivers than a Washington, D.C.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.003
bureaucrat.

07:19.443 --> 07:25.125
I think the Montana State Wildlife Service will take care of their glacier parks a lot better than Washington, D.C.

07:25.165 --> 07:25.645
ever could.

07:25.925 --> 07:27.126
I think states' rights matter.

07:27.527 --> 07:28.788
And I think Washington, D.C.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.191
is full of corruption, bureaucrats, waste, inefficiency.

07:32.691 --> 07:35.074
And look, I think states created the federal government.

07:35.094 --> 07:36.615
The federal government did not create the states.

07:37.016 --> 07:44.983
And the beauty of individual liberty is if you decentralize the federal government, you can restore freedom back to the people, not have government rule our lives every day.

07:45.003 --> 07:47.806
Now, that sounds very similar to Gary Johnson's platform.

07:48.106 --> 07:48.426
Similar.

07:48.446 --> 07:51.487
It sounds similar to the Constitution, too.

07:52.007 --> 07:57.368
Do you mind if I ask you, you know, who you might be supporting for this election?

07:57.428 --> 07:58.628
Yeah, I will.

07:58.688 --> 07:59.608
It's a binary choice.

07:59.648 --> 08:01.029
I think we've got to save the Supreme Court.

08:01.109 --> 08:03.989
I personally, not the organization, I'll be voting for Donald Trump.

08:05.230 --> 08:05.510
Excellent.

08:05.530 --> 08:06.070
Thank you very much.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.170
Socialism sucks!

08:08.630 --> 08:09.991
Socialism sucks!

08:10.491 --> 08:11.811
Socialism sucks!

08:12.311 --> 08:13.591
Socialism sucks!

08:14.992 --> 08:15.352
All right.

08:15.392 --> 08:16.572
The government sucks!

08:20.615 --> 08:29.900
Big government sucks!

08:48.393 --> 08:50.195
these really wealthy, high-profile people.

08:50.435 --> 08:52.358
And, you know, Eric Weinstein was highlighting this to me once.

08:52.418 --> 08:53.159
He was saying... Smart dude.

08:53.279 --> 08:53.719
Very smart dude.

08:53.839 --> 08:56.182
And he wasn't making any accusations at all, but he was just talking overall.

08:56.442 --> 09:00.287
He goes, I think there are people out there that can facilitate experiences for discreet clients.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.669
And it's very valuable.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.631
Like, look at the guy who gave Epstein that house in Manhattan.

09:03.851 --> 09:04.232
He gave him.

09:04.292 --> 09:04.852
You mean Leslie Wexner?

09:04.912 --> 09:05.733
Yeah, the guy from Victoria's Secret.

09:05.793 --> 09:06.194
He gave him.

09:06.534 --> 09:07.655
A 60 million dollar mansion.

09:07.675 --> 09:08.275
He did way more than that.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.376
He assigned his entire power of attorney to him.

09:09.396 --> 09:10.236
You're so cool, I'm gonna give you a house.

09:10.437 --> 09:13.658
No, he gave him the keys to the entire castle of all of Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch and all of L Brands.

09:13.879 --> 09:16.300
When you find out that people who work at Nickelodeon are pedophiles, you go, oh.

09:16.580 --> 09:17.461
Foot fetishists, no less.

09:17.521 --> 09:19.622
If you're gonna be a pedophile, wouldn't you go be around kids?

09:19.722 --> 09:20.643
Like, if you could be, and sneak around?

09:20.903 --> 09:23.785
Okay, wouldn't you think that Sacha Baron Cohen thought he had exposed pedophile Ringwald filming Who's America?

09:23.905 --> 09:24.465
Oh, that's right.

09:24.645 --> 09:25.386
That's right, I forgot about that.

09:25.406 --> 09:27.147
The concierge said they can point that out, we can help you.

09:27.227 --> 09:27.467
Yeah.

09:27.587 --> 09:29.228
Yeah, things happen out of, like, it's kind of crazy.

09:29.248 --> 09:30.129
Do you remember Andrew Breitbart got killed?

09:30.349 --> 09:30.949
I do remember that.

09:31.049 --> 09:32.550
And he was exposing, exactly, he was exposing Ac

09:34.011 --> 09:35.172
Oh, man, I'm totally blanking on our boy these days.

09:35.212 --> 09:49.581
It does all the keys You know the James O'Keefe got to start with with Breitbart on that story exposing acorn and what they did is they sent James O'Keefe And this other female reporter into acorn and he pretended to be a pimp Well, they asked them for help setting up a underage sex trafficking ring and the people at acorn Yeah, that was the they wanted to they wanted help setting up an underage sex trafficking ring using children from Guatemala or from Central America They say that in the meeting.

09:49.981 --> 09:50.642
They yeah.

09:50.722 --> 09:51.883
Yeah, that's what was on tape.

09:51.903 --> 09:53.964
Yeah, it's a crazy blew my mind when I read I was like, what are we talking about right now?

09:54.064 --> 10:00.768
Cuz I didn't know that history because I wasn't paying attention back then and that's that is the story is that he went in and asked For help setting up a under I don't think he was like I don't think he was probably using the words like five-year-olds ten-year

10:03.450 --> 10:03.951
I don't know.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.232
It's not you can't I mean, I can't find those videos anymore.

10:05.252 --> 10:06.032
I've looked I'm sure they're somewhere.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.735
I'm sure that James O'Keefe could tell the story what happened with him and Project Veritas I don't know.

10:09.075 --> 10:09.415
I have no idea.

10:09.435 --> 10:16.162
It's a whole drama fest and I try to stay I mean I usually try to stay out of the drama in the modern industry because it's like it'll just wait drama Inside the drama industry drama in every industry drama class.

10:16.182 --> 10:28.913
Well, yeah, they look like they he went in and asked for help setting up this ring They allegedly said yeah, here's how you do it We'll help you help you and that's what the case they brought against acorn was right before Andrew Breitbart mysteriously died And then the corner that did his autopsy mysteriously died It's like such a that was such a weird one to stumble upon cuz I didn't know I was about to stumble upon it Yeah, and people can look I mean everyone should look up anything that I say

10:28.993 --> 10:35.737
Always people always just look it up and just start typing things in I'm saying and see what if you can figure out what you think Yeah, I am NOT an ex I'm just a dude that like it's looking things up and I try to be really thorough But like wasn't Breitbart was a Breitbart a drudge.

10:35.778 --> 10:41.061
That was the first victim of these coordinated anti-advertising campaigns I'm sure I know what you mean, but I'll pull out.

10:41.221 --> 10:42.422
Yes Exactly.

10:42.442 --> 10:42.682
I don't know.

10:42.702 --> 10:43.443
They do it strategically.

10:43.603 --> 10:47.245
I think it was done to both probably but I don't know but I think the first one the first one that they did it on I think it was Breitbart.

10:47.265 --> 10:52.869
I think Breitbart was on this like super rapid upward trajectory and they just completely tank the revenue It was a Breitbart or is it you remember Jamie who's talking to us about that?

10:52.889 --> 10:53.389
There was a chase Hughes.

10:53.829 --> 10:54.090
Who was it?

10:54.750 --> 11:05.653
It might have been It is interesting how you can watch out over history the more history you learn the more you get to see where certain strategies Like kind of like deep state strategy so to speak or intelligence agencies strategies get invented and then they start using like Mike Ben's might be a Mike Ben's He knows this shit.

11:05.813 --> 11:07.354
Yeah Okay, right bar plus 90% of his advertisers in two months.

11:07.474 --> 11:07.834
That's what it is.

11:07.974 --> 11:08.774
Yeah, who's still there?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.915
So this was so this the Washington Post and making it seem like this is a normal thing.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.335
Oh, look They lost all their advertising people pulled out because they're full of shit.

11:13.355 --> 11:13.995
It's just another frame game.

11:14.015 --> 11:16.736
No, they all coordinated to try to point out that and kill people.

11:16.756 --> 11:19.177
It's so crazy that all of this is happening in plain view.

11:21.596 --> 11:27.482
Ladies and gentlemen, you probably couldn't hear that because that was on 2X, but I assure you they all but admitted it.

11:28.403 --> 11:31.146
They were talking about Andrew Breitbart and his murder.

11:31.567 --> 11:35.431
They were talking about the start that Veritas had with Breitbart.

11:36.332 --> 11:42.938
And they weren't talking about any of these points, including perhaps the most pertinent one right now, autism being a myth.

11:43.839 --> 11:51.483
The fact of the matter is autism is an illusion that has been created by an illusion of consensus of people on the internet.

11:52.024 --> 11:55.085
And it's our use of social media that allows this to work.

11:56.026 --> 12:04.571
Where a useless argument has been actively engaged in, you know, a limited spectrum of debate for a decade, maybe three.

12:05.591 --> 12:14.093
And if you don't believe that they can do that to you, just think about how many of these pictures are familiar to you in a flash and why that is.

12:14.813 --> 12:24.916
It is because the internet is that powerful and it is that ubiquitous in our lives and we are very visually learning animals.

12:25.036 --> 12:32.258
And so it is very dangerous for us to allow our reality to be defined by such a tiny window of glass.

12:33.558 --> 12:40.101
If you don't understand why the cheese is free behind that little window of glass, you are a mile in that trap.

12:41.102 --> 12:43.043
And it is about the human genome.

12:43.703 --> 12:47.164
It is about a science experiment that involves your grandchildren.

12:48.085 --> 12:49.946
And it is one big cast.

12:50.066 --> 12:53.267
It is a national security theater, so you can't change the script.

12:53.827 --> 13:00.110
Although they are on social media and pretend that you might have that possibility, it is definitely not true.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.271
But we could, in theory,

13:02.031 --> 13:04.373
We could, in theory, make America real again.

13:04.413 --> 13:10.339
We could do that, but I think the only way that's possible is if we start supporting people like me.

13:11.059 --> 13:22.250
People who have a message that is unique, produced by themselves, by their own professional and personal experience and years of trying to get to the truth.

13:22.830 --> 13:25.531
with an unblemished record of integrity.

13:26.151 --> 13:30.672
That's what I think GigaOM Biological brings to the table that very few others do.

13:31.153 --> 13:37.815
And it's evident in the kind of information that I try to present within the first 10 minutes of the start of the stream.

13:37.855 --> 13:39.315
It could, I guess, start with it.

13:40.115 --> 13:41.436
But let's just be honest here.

13:41.856 --> 13:43.116
Nobody says it better than this.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.217
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a myth.

13:45.757 --> 13:57.664
And it's a myth that's specifically used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

13:57.724 --> 14:03.627
And if any of these people were real, they would have gotten here by now, just like getting to the point where

14:04.167 --> 14:10.754
You could say that pandemics and gain of function are also biological myths that are used to make sure that these things aren't questioned.

14:11.195 --> 14:12.556
But they didn't get there.

14:12.996 --> 14:19.183
And the only reason why they didn't get there at this point, the only one that makes the most sense, is it's by design.

14:19.223 --> 14:22.306
And that's why they ignore the biology that I've been trying to

14:23.107 --> 14:36.963
extremely thoroughly explore over the last six years the possibility space i've been trying to explore they ignore it on purpose they have to and it's important to understand that this truth involves my

14:38.231 --> 14:42.013
little tiny personal experience with these monkey people.

14:43.554 --> 14:44.534
They were at my house.

14:44.734 --> 14:46.075
They've been texting my wife.

14:46.495 --> 14:56.660
It's a very personal thing for me that takes a lot of effort and concentration not to be constantly aggravating and constantly about me, but it's really not about me.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.380
It's about us.

14:57.840 --> 15:04.223
It's about our children and our children being trapped on social media because we are trapped on social media.

15:04.664 --> 15:06.284
We were actually trapped on TV.

15:06.344 --> 15:06.985
Let's be honest.

15:07.885 --> 15:16.856
We, us older people over 50 years old, we grew up in a time when you still had to stand up to change TV channels and there were only three.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.912
I remember watching Channel 13 a lot in northern Wisconsin.

15:22.012 --> 15:23.513
NBC was Channel 13.

15:24.373 --> 15:28.515
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, then you're trapped in it already.

15:28.555 --> 15:33.117
But I assure you that social media is the military weapon we need to fear.

15:33.177 --> 15:35.418
It's not the COVID shot.

15:35.498 --> 15:37.679
It's not the COVID virus.

15:37.739 --> 15:40.521
It's not a COVID virus or another virus to come.

15:41.161 --> 15:45.223
It is actually social media and our acquiescence to it.

15:45.803 --> 15:48.984
And as Americans we need to stay razor focused on this idea.

15:49.784 --> 16:07.509
We need to stay razor focused on this idea because all of our politics and all of our discussions about geopolitics are supposedly taking place on social media and damage is being done to our geopolitical relationship because of our use of social media and this is preposterous.

16:08.149 --> 16:15.011
What this is actually is a theater that is designed to make social media relevant where it otherwise wouldn't be.

16:15.571 --> 16:33.156
In other words, it is part of an orchestrated paid campaign to get everybody in the free cell phone handling world to be on social media and to try to use social media skillfully to find the truth.

16:35.945 --> 16:49.633
and using social media to skillfully find the truth has resulted in Children's Health Defense, ICAN, the Brownstone Institute, HART, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Donald Trump, and all of these people.

16:50.703 --> 17:02.653
And the reason why I know is because I've interacted with most of them personally, with texting, and with, as I said, even my wife has had texts and emails from these super clowns.

17:02.813 --> 17:11.419
And they're not, I like to say clowns, but, you know, I'm using that in the kind of scary, terrifying, Steve, you know, Stephen King kind of clown.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.302
Because that's what they really are, they're imposters.

17:15.444 --> 17:23.446
They're imposters dressed up as friendly, cuddly, homesteading farmers.

17:24.507 --> 17:31.209
And really friendly, cuddly dermatologists from Idaho.

17:31.429 --> 17:37.911
Or really friendly, cuddly, intensive care internists from Wisconsin.

17:39.674 --> 17:55.075
um it's it's it's a it's a dark place where we are ladies and gentlemen where RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb transfection is a crime and populations pyramids are real and motivating most of what we experienced over the COVID pandemic now

17:55.916 --> 17:58.938
There is one way out, at least right now, there's at least one way out.

17:58.978 --> 18:05.042
And that is to build your own social media, which is what I'm trying to do, what I'm trying to set an example with.

18:06.302 --> 18:11.666
It is a daunting task that I can only complete because I have a friend.

18:12.686 --> 18:22.430
And that friend helps me do it, but essentially what we have is a website that runs a video hosting platform called PeerTube that also actually has an app that you can download.

18:22.450 --> 18:31.114
The reason why this is cool is because the app and the website don't need you, don't even want to, it's not even possible to log in, to create a login.

18:31.514 --> 18:34.015
You couldn't give me your email if you wanted to.

18:34.995 --> 18:41.938
And in fact, it does use your IP address, but it's only because of the way that the sharing service works.

18:41.978 --> 18:46.419
You kind of hold pizzas of the video and pass them along to other people.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.480
It's an interesting open source thing.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.942
If you're interested in it, you can go to GitHub and other places and find the code for it.

18:56.023 --> 19:01.005
I do not know if Google put something on it before you download it from Google Play.

19:02.205 --> 19:03.786
You know, use at your own risk, of course.

19:03.826 --> 19:10.371
But all the reports that I've had, except for from people with older phones, is that this app works flawlessly.

19:10.411 --> 19:13.473
And so the live show will be up there if it's live.

19:13.894 --> 19:18.137
And otherwise, the last video that was posted will be the first thing that hits your phone.

19:18.597 --> 19:23.281
And that could even be Mark Hulak's stream, which is actually kind of cool right now.

19:23.741 --> 19:28.805
I did see a comment there that I will address a little later from Entropy Rider.

19:30.126 --> 19:32.027
But I'm going to first get the show started here.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.349
Let me just pop myself in.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.452
Good evening, good afternoon, good morning.

19:37.952 --> 19:39.814
It's 1234 here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

19:39.854 --> 19:45.999
We're still trying to seek the truth together about what happened with the pandemic and what motivated these people to lie about so much.

19:46.640 --> 19:52.305
I'm very excited that I do think we're finally breaking through after six years of work.

19:52.685 --> 19:55.527
We're starting to build a sort of

19:56.428 --> 20:13.021
an understanding that isn't wavering anymore about what happened and what wool was pulled over whose eyes and who might still have wool pulled over their eyes versus who has accepted their role in this theater and is now actively participating in the bamboozling of our children which I don't like

20:13.641 --> 20:14.782
I don't like at all.

20:14.982 --> 20:27.670
And so the bamboozlement is primarily about, you know, the existence of elite pedophiles and how blackmail and guns and drugs, I guess, are used to control governments of the world.

20:27.770 --> 20:35.896
And it's kind of preposterous in a way how they talk about this, but that's the reason why apparently Trump needs supporting because he is a

20:37.136 --> 21:01.723
despite this amazing world level of control the elite pedophiles have, Trump was able to get elected twice, non-consecutive terms, and he's trying to upset this apple cart, and so we are supposed to support him because he's not an elite pedophile, he's fighting against them, but of course Trump thinks that COVID was real and that warp speed was fantastic and that vaccines can and do work.

21:02.903 --> 21:04.464
It's just that Tylenol is bad.

21:05.799 --> 21:22.286
And on the other side, we have people who are also sure that this is about the grandchildren of Earth, but I guess Trump is an elite pedophile that's trying to steal them, and COVID is real, and vaccines work, and humans are a plague on the Earth that we should probably reduce population anyway.

21:22.386 --> 21:27.669
So, I mean, with climate change coming, we might go extinct irrespective of what we do.

21:30.782 --> 21:32.323
And of course, none of this is true.

21:32.363 --> 21:34.503
This is all based on bad biology.

21:34.563 --> 21:36.504
It's all based on bad biology.

21:36.544 --> 21:39.185
And that bad biology needs to be unlearned.

21:40.646 --> 21:42.146
And so let me get this music away.

21:42.206 --> 21:43.387
I hope that wasn't too annoying.

21:43.447 --> 21:44.707
I could hardly hear it in my ear.

21:44.727 --> 21:46.708
I had to turn up my monitors a little bit.

21:48.131 --> 21:49.672
We got to get rid of this bad biology.

21:49.712 --> 21:53.114
That's what I've been, you know, threatening to do for quite some time.

21:53.154 --> 22:00.497
And I got to say the developing of that tact has been more difficult and more daunting than I guess I estimated.

22:00.557 --> 22:07.201
I mean, I'm pretty far now behind the scenes, but it's been a lot of reading and I still have a lot more reading to do.

22:08.321 --> 22:10.983
But I guess I kind of decided that I didn't want to

22:12.150 --> 22:13.851
to do it half-assed, if you will.

22:14.151 --> 22:25.339
And so it's not as simple as just deciding that you're going to prove, you know, modern biology and the central dogma is essentially being wrong and then write some silly book about it that gets nowhere.

22:26.279 --> 22:40.229
I want to do what or try to attempt to make a first attempt or a second attempt at doing a third attempt at doing what Buckminster Fuller suggested, which is if you want to fix or change

22:42.890 --> 22:51.153
something about the way that we understand the world, the way to do it is to offer a new model that's better than the old one.

22:51.373 --> 22:58.836
And so I think I'm on my way to being able to do that, and I don't think that's a crazy thing to say.

22:59.813 --> 23:14.376
And the reason why I don't think it's a crazy thing to say is because I will be standing on the shoulders of other giants, just not the ones that the central dogma stands on, not the ones that we are supposed to pay attention to.

23:14.456 --> 23:25.118
And I think that's really the exciting part of what I get to do here, thanks to my supporters like Maurice and Simon and William and Jeff and all these people.

23:26.318 --> 23:35.168
are without a doubt seminal in making this possible, making me believe that I can spend, you know, 15 hours a day on this.

23:35.228 --> 23:37.430
And I'm not talking like Sherry Tenpenny.

23:37.890 --> 23:42.715
I'm talking like Jonathan Cooey, who's, I really, I feel like,

23:43.476 --> 23:48.021
I've gone from losing my mind to finding it again.

23:48.081 --> 23:50.984
And I'm very excited to share that with you over the next couple months.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.308
It remains about the grandchildren of earth.

23:54.348 --> 23:59.773
There remains a global fake health freedom movement that we can dispel one language at a time.

24:00.214 --> 24:02.796
And that's what makes Gaza and Israel so ridiculous.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.597
That's what makes

24:05.078 --> 24:12.702
Donald Trump and Bobby Kennedy and Mark Zuckerberg and Alex and Peter and Jeff makes them all silly.

24:13.382 --> 24:15.283
Makes them all silly.

24:16.584 --> 24:22.927
Elon is one of the biggest jokes ever played on modern humanity.

24:24.011 --> 24:38.542
But just his being known around the world is kind of demonstration to these people that are bamboozled by this idea that they're going to take control of the species or the evolution of the species in a decade or so.

24:39.522 --> 24:46.648
This illusion is largely sustained by a consensus of

24:47.799 --> 24:52.143
I don't know, scripted actors that probably more or less know that they're full of shit.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.947
And they don't mind because of the perks that it has, the roles that they play.

24:58.088 --> 25:05.976
I don't think it's that far away to cite someone like George Carlin to say that it's a big club and you're not in it.

25:06.596 --> 25:24.561
I don't think it's crazy to think that when you watch television you're seeing some people who are not in the club and other people who are in the club and the ones who are in the club might act a little more relaxed than the ones who are auditioning for the club and there are some people who are on TV and have no idea

25:25.520 --> 25:28.581
because they haven't spent their lives trying to figure things out.

25:28.641 --> 25:33.123
They haven't really spent their lives trying to understand the world that they live in.

25:33.163 --> 25:36.384
They've just been, you know, some people aren't that complicated.

25:36.444 --> 25:43.107
I think Leonardo da Vinci is the one who said that some people see, some people see when it's shown, and some people just can't see.

25:44.554 --> 25:47.176
And I think that's an apt description.

25:47.236 --> 26:06.267
And it's not to say that this is a thing, but it's to say that this is the kind of motivation that results in a book like Man and His Future, where the people who can see start to believe that they have some responsibility to govern the people who can't see.

26:07.168 --> 26:19.621
And then once they realize that the people who see only when shown can be shown the wrong thing, then the people who see understand that there's an interesting way we could govern everybody then.

26:20.963 --> 26:22.845
Because we can just show them the wrong thing.

26:22.905 --> 26:24.587
We can show them what we want them to see.

26:26.328 --> 26:28.329
And of course, this is where we are, right?

26:28.369 --> 26:37.794
That's the reason why this show today might be the most impactful show that I do in many, many years, because the cage has been closed.

26:37.874 --> 26:40.676
It's all summarized on this screen right here.

26:42.844 --> 26:43.985
The cage is closed.

26:44.045 --> 26:45.065
What am I talking about?

26:45.085 --> 27:04.817
What I'm talking about is that there is a trap that we have been led into where we think that maybe some actors underneath the Donald Trump banner are actually good guys with good intentions that are gonna try and change things in America for the better or something like that, but it's all a lie.

27:06.021 --> 27:10.786
And there are unwitting participants who can't see even when they're shown.

27:11.586 --> 27:20.695
And then there are witting participants who understand that dynamic and understand what's required to completely bamboozle those people who can't see unless they're shown.

27:22.777 --> 27:26.080
And that's why Mary Holland and Brian Hooker

27:28.072 --> 27:57.289
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Meryl Nass, and all the other people that I've ever come in contact with, with the last five years, have broken off ties with me, and none of them will admit that I exist, because they exist inside of this narrative, behind these people, and behind these movements, behind these telegram groups, behind these, you know, Instagram lives, and whatever else that they're doing, to make sure that nobody gets here.

27:58.524 --> 28:07.469
The exact same reason why they killed Tony Bark and why they killed Brandy Vaughn is because Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn were able to say that intramuscular injection is just dumb.

28:08.629 --> 28:24.498
An injection versus ingestion is a great way to biologically rationalize how dumb injection is, especially intramuscular injection in the context of the immune system and how it's organized around barriers, epithelial barriers.

28:25.851 --> 28:50.479
And if you understand the history of injection around morphine and around the late 1800s with the invention of the hypodermic needle, and read some of the books that I have on my shelves about what they think about the hypodermic needle, why it's such a miracle invention and why it allows so many new treatments for new and previously untreatable conditions.

28:51.957 --> 29:07.728
and listen to these doctors describe their anecdotal cases where their application of intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is able to cure something, it's very easy to see that intramuscular injection is the dumb idea.

29:07.788 --> 29:08.708
That's the problem.

29:08.788 --> 29:21.377
And the laziness with which immunization is done in America and around the world often just involves intramuscular injection because it's considered equivalent to subcutaneous injection.

29:22.267 --> 29:42.124
when in fact it may be several orders of magnitude more dangerous with a much more distributed temporally and phenotypically bouquet of possible outcomes, which can't be connected to the injection because of the nature of it.

29:45.802 --> 30:02.792
And so transfection being an old technology from, you know, 20 years ago, already used in all medical science departments in America and in the Western world are using transfection in mice and monkeys and other animals and in cell culture for decades already.

30:02.832 --> 30:09.756
So an old technology has been renamed or falsely called gene therapy, and it's all bullshit.

30:09.917 --> 30:13.559
And that's the reason why Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project

30:14.299 --> 30:22.084
Robert Malone of DITRA and DOD and all these other things, the WHO and Solveig and whoever else he's worked for.

30:22.584 --> 30:29.868
That's why they were involved in this Steve Bannon conservative populist resistance movement to the COVID thing.

30:29.908 --> 30:34.051
That's why they were there, because the military part of this needed the

30:35.282 --> 30:38.925
alternative social media bubbles to have these people.

30:39.346 --> 30:52.917
And that's also why they had to go to all these podcasts, because the idea wasn't for them to share their message and then to, you know, send it around via USB or have everybody post it on all these websites.

30:52.977 --> 30:53.738
They had to do

30:54.418 --> 31:16.217
personal appearances so that the magic of podcasts, you know, dumb person talking to smart person, asking smart questions of the smart person that were scripted by the smart person, the dumb person comes to learn something from the smart person, and the person who's passively watching that conversation can be bamboozled to believe that they've also learned something.

31:17.932 --> 31:47.431
And that's very specifically why Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Jessica Rose, and Pierre Kory, and Peter McCullough, and Mike Eden, and Claire Craig, and Nick Hudson, and all these people exist, is because a social media network of actors was created, recruited, curated, scripted, their scripts were changed, and they were promoted, or given money for a set, or given rumble contracts, yada, yada, yada, the list is endless.

31:48.544 --> 31:52.547
fake subscribers on Locals, fake subscribers on Substack.

31:52.567 --> 31:55.349
There's all kinds of ways that money could be laundered here.

31:55.970 --> 31:59.272
And it is all because they needed to control the narrative.

31:59.332 --> 32:07.038
That's why Sherry Tenpenny and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone and all these people are on the same side that haven't been able to say this.

32:07.098 --> 32:07.799
Robert Malone.

32:08.419 --> 32:21.906
The preeminent homesteading genius has not been able to summarize any of this biology at all and is still just stuck on the we need safe vaccines and you know this was a contaminated shot just like the script says.

32:23.727 --> 32:36.855
And children's health defense could have saved potentially I guess hundreds of thousands of children from damage had they just been able to say it as succinctly as I said saying it for the last two years instead of firing me.

32:37.803 --> 32:38.929
RNA cannot pandemic.

32:39.070 --> 32:41.403
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.191
Think about that.

32:44.832 --> 33:04.859
Children's Health Defense, primarily defined as an anti-vax group who says that vaccines are responsible for autism, has never been able to get to the point where their scientific advisor, Brian Hooker, was when he was on the radio in 2013 saying that autism was not a word that he liked.

33:04.899 --> 33:06.300
He doesn't use the word autism.

33:06.340 --> 33:08.981
His son was vaccine damaged, neurologically damaged.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.752
It's because it's by design.

33:13.812 --> 33:17.955
It is a military script that Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:17.995 --> 33:19.596
and Mary Holland are all a part of.

33:20.937 --> 33:22.418
It's time that we wake up.

33:23.462 --> 33:32.611
It's time that we accept that the conservative movement in America only exists on social media and mainstream media because they say it does, and it's by design.

33:32.671 --> 33:41.219
It is a trap that Judy Woodruff has laid down, that Steve Bannon has laid down, that the entire national security state has laid down.

33:42.190 --> 33:44.671
specifically to catch all of us in it.

33:45.452 --> 33:53.075
Even now, the Christian nationalist movement is an illusion that only is going to exist on social media.

33:53.155 --> 33:59.478
No matter how many groups of people they show you with guns and marching around, it is an illusion.

33:59.578 --> 34:05.881
Those people might believe it exists, but they only believe it exists because they are skillfully using social media.

34:08.541 --> 34:17.943
And if you need one more piece of evidence that these people are all frauds, think about how easy it is to say that a man who thinks he's a woman is not normal.

34:17.983 --> 34:25.445
The cosmetic transformation, regardless of specific details, results in a transitioned or trans man, not a trans woman.

34:27.385 --> 34:28.305
It's a trans man.

34:29.225 --> 34:33.906
Just like a man who dresses in drag is still just a man dressing in drag.

34:34.386 --> 34:36.887
A man who thinks he's a woman and decides to

34:38.627 --> 34:44.757
surgically alter himself in order to be more like what he perceives as a woman

34:46.288 --> 34:53.051
It's a transitioning man and that transitioning process never ends because, you know, it's not gonna, it's no.

34:53.691 --> 34:55.012
It's trans man, done.

34:55.832 --> 34:57.573
Now there's no language confusion.

34:57.653 --> 35:10.038
Now there's no hearing in front of Congress where some Supreme Court nominee gets asked to define what a woman is because we don't need that anymore because the language is consistent.

35:12.780 --> 35:15.801
But of course, everything on this screen is a language thing.

35:16.795 --> 35:20.579
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

35:20.959 --> 35:25.785
Injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

35:26.365 --> 35:30.770
Transfection is an old technology that would be a crime in healthy humans.

35:31.370 --> 35:32.692
RNA cannot pandemic.

35:32.852 --> 35:35.174
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

35:35.935 --> 35:36.376
I'm done.

35:37.901 --> 35:56.830
And because Children's Health Defense, because Robert F. Kennedy Jr., because all of these people, including Dr. Paul Thomas and anybody that you put on this list, I mean, Suzanne Humphreys, these are all really, really malevolent frauds.

35:58.271 --> 36:03.053
And they deserve to be hit with rotten vegetables in public for the rest of their lives.

36:05.165 --> 36:08.366
I don't think it'll happen, but it should happen a lot.

36:14.749 --> 36:17.770
If they wanted to have won, they could have won a long time ago.

36:17.830 --> 36:21.712
If they really believed what they believed, they could have won a long time ago.

36:21.772 --> 36:23.833
They would have been saying this a long time ago.

36:24.353 --> 36:28.495
They would have been doing things differently and their priorities would remain solid.

36:31.215 --> 36:45.836
Mark said it best the other day, or said it really well the other day, I don't know if this is actually his phrase, I guess it's not, but you know, all corruption is ultimately permitted or allowed or facilitated

36:46.943 --> 36:59.710
by the lack of good priorities, proper prioritization of problems, proper prioritization of what's important in a system or a network allows corruption to occur.

37:00.771 --> 37:16.580
And in this case, social media has been used as an elaborate theater to essentially bamboozle the American public and a lot of the public of the social media using citizens around the world, many of them in the EU.

37:19.266 --> 37:30.914
And this bamboozlement is an ongoing operation to make social media a more relevant governance tool than, say, newspapers or a particular language.

37:30.954 --> 37:37.579
That's the whole trick here, is that if the ultimate window into your governed population is

37:45.299 --> 37:59.341
is social media, and you can get a lot of information from it, and they can demonstrate that as national security value to all of these countries, then behind the scenes, all of these countries are on board with this governance.

37:59.901 --> 38:14.244
And I think that's one of the things that I think we need to kind of assume or put in the assume column of NATO countries is that they've all accepted that social media is either going to be governance by the people that control social media,

38:15.280 --> 38:18.461
or we are going to have our own social media and control it.

38:19.382 --> 38:29.365
It's kind of like the the dune prophecy you know where men turned over their decisions to machines but then that only allowed them to be enslaved by other men with machines.

38:29.845 --> 38:39.529
And so if we turn ourselves over to social media and that's the decision that the technocrats make because they need that data because they want to be able to control us

38:40.529 --> 38:50.077
control what we're thinking about, what we buy and what we do, and distract us with things, then they have also accepted the fact that if we don't do it, someone else is going to do it to us.

38:50.137 --> 38:58.583
And so they've created this whole illusion of TikTok and, you know, that being a Chinese thing that now Larry Ellison is going to save us from, you know, the guy with

38:59.068 --> 39:03.931
All the AI and with Oracle, he's going to save us because he's going to buy TikTok and make it free.

39:04.392 --> 39:10.716
Just like, you know, I guess Elon Musk bought, bought Twitter from the guy with the beard and now it's X and it's free.

39:12.537 --> 39:13.498
And so you can see it.

39:13.558 --> 39:27.547
It's just a corralling of your conscious, our collective consciousness and the creating of this, this no sphere that, that Pierre Chardin or Pierre de Chardin came up with a long time ago, where the whole globe has kind of a,

39:28.368 --> 39:30.949
a collective awareness of what's going on right now.

39:30.989 --> 39:43.433
And Donald Trump represents something like that because a large percentage of people on earth are currently, you know, more or less in the background or in the foreground thinking about the consequences of Donald Trump being in office in America.

39:43.493 --> 39:44.393
Wow, that's crazy.

39:45.233 --> 39:51.235
But this is all an orchestrated campaign to demonstrate the power of social media, demonstrate what they can do.

39:52.386 --> 40:04.479
And I think that if you think deep enough and dark enough and assume the worst, then a lot of what we've experienced over the last couple years should be seen and interpreted as a theater for the whole world.

40:05.740 --> 40:09.945
And so would they fake a shooting for the whole world?

40:13.439 --> 40:22.718
yes they would hey i have no responsibility every once in a while that thing i might have to get a different one it's kind of cheap maybe it's too cheap i don't know

40:24.332 --> 40:27.613
But yeah, I really think you've got to start thinking of it this way.

40:27.993 --> 40:34.555
No matter what you tweet, no matter what you post on Facebook, the Star Trek episode is not going to change.

40:34.915 --> 40:43.337
We've been trying to change the Star Trek episode with social media, not understanding that all these people are actors and they know that.

40:44.588 --> 40:56.874
These people are scripted actors, from Joe Rogan all the way down to Brett Weinstein, from Jimmy Kimmel all the way down to the no virus people.

40:56.934 --> 41:13.402
And so what you need to think about, what I tried to show you yesterday, is what could a couple, three really close friends, 30 year friends, maybe they all worked at the same comedy club, maybe they all, I don't know, had the same boyfriend or,

41:14.522 --> 41:26.271
work for the same movie producer, or you know, all like the same... Imagine what people who were lifelong friends in show business could do together.

41:27.232 --> 41:35.639
If they just shook hands and split up and said, let's do the most damage, let's herd the most cats, let's see who can get the most viewers.

41:38.381 --> 41:38.721
Ready?

41:39.682 --> 41:39.982
Break!

41:42.486 --> 41:47.587
Because that's why I showed the barbecue thing, because it's beautiful what three friends can accomplish.

41:47.627 --> 41:49.908
I mean, they work hard at that place.

41:51.188 --> 41:54.769
Every day, all week long, hard at that place.

41:54.789 --> 41:59.570
And I don't think it's possible unless these guys were friends that trusted each other.

41:59.590 --> 42:02.891
And that's what they are.

42:04.249 --> 42:06.471
I think that's what Joe Rogan and Jimmy Kimmel are.

42:06.511 --> 42:10.475
I think that's what Steve Bannon and Harvey Weinstein are.

42:10.515 --> 42:13.718
I think that's what Goldman Sachs and Steve Bannon are.

42:13.738 --> 42:16.421
I think that's what Goldman Sachs and Aaron Siri are.

42:16.461 --> 42:21.546
I think that's what Steve Bannon and Tony Lyons and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:21.606 --> 42:21.726
are.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.170
I think that's what Robert Malone and Merrill Nass are.

42:26.152 --> 42:46.333
They're very long colleagues that trust each other because they've been in the trenches for a long time, but not at a barbecue at the frickin' fake anti-vax national security operation that makes sure that an anti-vaccine skeptic movement never exists.

42:47.236 --> 43:07.634
And that the only movement that exists is one that thinks that, you know, bioweapons are possible and bioweapons and bioterrorism and biowarfare, you know, all that stuff that they were talking about endlessly right up until 9-11 that Mark Kulak has so eloquently been archiving over the last couple of weeks that nobody seems to cover.

43:07.674 --> 43:10.696
And Steve Bannon was involved in that narrative control too.

43:16.667 --> 43:40.533
so that was what my my barbecue thing was and that's why we don't know anything about population pyramids and nobody's telling you that this signal was coming for since i was in high school that's also why we have these crazy videos where mary holland is on democracy now opposite ran paul and paul offit and 10 years later mary holland is on

43:42.006 --> 43:49.409
Steve Bannon's war room opposite, you know, the same people and the same people are on stage arguing with each other.

43:49.449 --> 44:05.316
It's because this measles narrative is part of this measles narrative because a military operation that is on this kind of timescale is almost invisible if all of its victims are on social media operating on a 24 hour timescale.

44:06.616 --> 44:07.937
And that's what we've missed.

44:09.076 --> 44:13.239
We have missed that if it's for all the marbles, then they would be more than willing.

44:13.279 --> 44:29.532
In fact, it would be required for them to put people in place, to orchestrate a narrative so that the surfer girl who was in the National Guard could be, you know, our Director of National Intelligence after Ben Nonrogan a couple of years earlier.

44:29.612 --> 44:35.276
It's just absurd unless you accept all of this stuff as random, which it can't be.

44:36.397 --> 44:37.118
It cannot be.

44:39.414 --> 44:56.252
And so that's why in 2016, I think it's very significant that when ICANN was founded and the movie Vaxxed was out and all of these people were in it, standing in front of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark, all of those people are still with us right now.

44:56.332 --> 45:01.818
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Brian Hooker, Mary Holland, Suzanne Humphries,

45:03.858 --> 45:09.302
James Lyons Weiler, all those clowns are the clowns that were behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:09.342 --> 45:12.564
and the absolutely fake, fraudulent CHD.

45:12.604 --> 45:20.130
And so they've stolen millions of dollars from people under the pretense that they're a real organization doing real stuff, but they're not.

45:21.050 --> 45:28.196
It is a national security organization that's been taking money from Americans that thought they were the Americans getting on the list.

45:30.137 --> 45:31.578
And this is all orchestrated.

45:31.658 --> 45:33.019
How am I making that argument?

45:33.059 --> 45:43.668
Because not only was Mary Holland and Rand Paul and Paul Offit on Democracy Now in 2015, and now in front of us in 2025.

45:44.188 --> 45:51.795
In fact, they've been in front of us for the entire pandemic, opposite one another, making the same arguments, making no progress.

45:52.315 --> 45:56.679
But even Robert De Niro,

45:57.571 --> 46:17.984
who's been in a couple Weinstein movies, was a part of the Vax thing, corrects himself a week later on the Today Show again, his producer corrects that they had a bunch of inconsistencies, and then now,

46:19.622 --> 46:44.607
again 10 years later we have Robert De Niro on the program with the comeback guy that was orchestrated you know fired for like a day or two and everybody talked about it and then he came back and he got more viewers than ever and now they have 21 21 million subscribers on YouTube but that's just because you know Donald Trump's kind of a doe head and guess who's the actor with them this guy not by accident

46:47.978 --> 46:54.320
It's not by accident, it's because America is being undermined by a national security theater that has spanned more than a decade.

46:55.280 --> 47:05.003
More than a decade because in 2013 is when Joe Rogan was on the Sci-Fi Channel doing a gain of function virus pandemic scary show.

47:05.783 --> 47:11.645
You know, Joe Rogan questions everything with two different characters that look surprisingly like Robert Malone.

47:13.046 --> 47:13.126
In 2013.

47:15.822 --> 47:17.703
So make no mistake about it.

47:18.223 --> 47:20.905
This is a real, this is the real deal.

47:20.965 --> 47:22.706
This is a real American history.

47:23.326 --> 47:34.092
What Mark and I are working on and certainly what I'm working on is recent American history that must be archived, can be archived by anyone.

47:34.553 --> 47:38.155
And you can experience it in real time by just looking at it.

47:38.215 --> 47:40.796
You can see it, you can do it yourself, do the research.

47:40.836 --> 47:43.718
It is impossible that these people have made no progress

47:44.278 --> 48:09.297
that since 2016 when he was on the today show saying that i'm not anti-vaccine i want safe vaccines that we now have robert f kennedy jr with a near miss on the white house saying exactly the same bullshit and now having blamed tylenol this is more than a strikeout it would be nice if it was a strikeout it is a by design failure

48:13.814 --> 48:15.276
It's a by design failure.

48:17.480 --> 48:18.120
Oh yeah, that's right.

48:18.161 --> 48:18.802
I had this here.

48:18.882 --> 48:25.071
So yeah, that's, that's the reason why this, this video is so remarkable because at the heart of this is Joe Rogan.

48:25.832 --> 48:29.558
At the heart of this is this idea that they've realized that podcasts can do it.

48:30.657 --> 48:37.739
where TV shows couldn't, where newspapers couldn't, podcasts can really create the idea that you're thinking along.

48:37.839 --> 48:42.180
And therefore they can convince you of stuff that otherwise you'd never be convinced of.

48:42.220 --> 48:43.261
Let's play the game again.

48:45.381 --> 48:46.822
Whose voice is this?

48:47.902 --> 48:49.202
Let me get the visualizer up.

48:49.262 --> 48:51.443
Test one, two, testing one, two, test.

48:51.483 --> 48:52.443
Whose voice is this?

48:53.904 --> 48:54.984
Let's see if this will play.

48:56.241 --> 48:57.482
And what year again?

48:58.122 --> 49:04.465
We need to have true prior free and informed consent, which means people don't have to give a reason if they don't want to take a vaccine.

49:04.845 --> 49:14.770
You can't, in my view, force parents to vaccinate their children when it goes against not only their religious beliefs, but their scientific understanding.

49:15.150 --> 49:20.033
Why do I want to inject my child with something that's never been properly tested?

49:20.353 --> 49:22.034
as mercury had never been properly tested.

49:22.134 --> 49:23.935
Aluminum's never been properly tested.

49:24.155 --> 49:26.136
Polysorbate 80's never been properly tested.

49:26.436 --> 49:29.978
Why should I be obliged to do that and put my child at risk?

49:30.418 --> 49:34.460
No parent wants to be forced to put their child's health at risk.

49:34.741 --> 49:36.401
And that is the reality today.

49:36.561 --> 49:37.602
That is the reality.

49:38.182 --> 49:46.907
Looking ahead, what would you say is the message people should have as we move forward and thinking about the prevalence of autism in this country and how long this has gone on?

49:48.021 --> 49:58.792
Well, I think, sadly, we have to recognize that governments, medical authorities, medical institutions, hospitals, they are conflicted.

49:59.032 --> 50:00.814
They have financial interests in this.

50:00.854 --> 50:02.696
They have potential liability

50:03.066 --> 50:03.426
for this.

50:03.567 --> 50:07.791
And so they have lied to us and they have lied to us for decades.

50:08.271 --> 50:19.823
And this all reached a whole new level when Congress passed the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which gave complete liability protection to industry and to the medical profession.

50:20.303 --> 50:24.948
So I think when you understand, forgive them, but they are conflicted.

50:25.248 --> 50:27.110
You don't have to listen to them anymore.

50:27.594 --> 50:31.497
And in 45 states, we have religious exemptions.

50:32.218 --> 50:40.345
If I believe it's against my religion to put my child's life on the line, as I do, you have the basis of a religious exemption.

50:40.665 --> 50:41.846
Just don't do it.

50:42.326 --> 50:43.207
Just don't do it.

50:43.367 --> 50:51.114
And I am fighting at Children's Health Defense with many others to restore religious rights in the five states that lack them right now.

50:51.614 --> 50:57.077
You don't have to say yes to putting your child's life and health at risk.

50:57.198 --> 50:57.978
You just don't.

50:58.418 --> 50:59.959
And you shouldn't, in my view.

51:00.399 --> 51:01.420
Or it's up to you.

51:01.600 --> 51:05.262
I want to say, I support parents to do whatever they think is right.

51:06.832 --> 51:11.696
looks at the information that's out there and says, I think my child should get a measles vaccine.

51:11.716 --> 51:13.718
Well, sad to say there is no separate measles vaccine.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.820
You have to get an MMR, measles, mumps, rubella.

51:16.120 --> 51:22.386
But if you believe that that is the best thing for you to do for your child's health, God bless you, then that is your decision.

51:22.666 --> 51:26.129
But every parent should have that right to do what they think is right for their child.

51:26.469 --> 51:28.531
Okay, so what year do you think it is?

51:28.611 --> 51:29.912
I saw one person put 2015.

51:33.086 --> 51:33.766
You're close.

51:34.586 --> 51:36.107
Someone want to try another guess?

51:36.587 --> 51:39.288
And then I will reveal the answer.

51:39.908 --> 51:39.288
2017.

51:42.168 --> 51:42.488
No.

51:43.869 --> 51:45.829
Actually, that recording was made yesterday.

51:45.849 --> 51:48.910
I shit you not.

51:49.270 --> 51:53.151
That's a Sherry Atkinson show, Mary Holland, 2025, September 25th.

51:53.371 --> 51:54.371
And it gets better.

51:54.391 --> 51:55.492
It gets better.

51:55.512 --> 51:55.612
Ready?

52:02.230 --> 52:02.630
Thank you.

52:02.950 --> 52:08.313
And do you say on geoengineering or weather modification, what are your thoughts?

52:08.853 --> 52:15.216
So even to me, that just sounded crazy not all that long ago, but it's actually well documented.

52:15.236 --> 52:16.396
It's well documented.

52:16.596 --> 52:22.439
Where are we with that and why does it seem to be discussed more publicly now than I've ever heard it?

52:23.120 --> 52:24.760
Well, I think it's interesting.

52:24.820 --> 52:28.941
I think there are many things that are now being discussed more than they've been discussed in the past.

52:29.461 --> 52:35.163
And certainly I think there is now much more of a public discussion of geoengineering than there has been.

52:35.523 --> 52:44.365
So as you point out, I mean, President Johnson back in the 60s said very openly at a public address, he who controls the weather controls the world.

52:44.725 --> 52:49.028
We use geoengineering in the Vietnam War, Operation Popeye.

52:49.068 --> 52:52.369
There's zero factual dispute about that.

52:53.870 --> 52:55.871
Now I want you to see what this is, right?

52:55.951 --> 52:57.753
Mark Kulak points it out very well.

52:57.793 --> 52:59.173
Where are her priorities?

52:59.233 --> 53:01.134
What's her priority message here?

53:01.194 --> 53:05.117
What's her priority message at Children's Health Defense?

53:05.177 --> 53:06.798
It's religious exemptions, it's

53:07.698 --> 53:10.499
EMTs, EMPs, I don't know.

53:10.519 --> 53:16.701
NOAA are federal agencies that are engaged in monitoring the climate and engaged in geoengineering.

53:16.741 --> 53:18.082
There's no real dispute about that.

53:18.402 --> 53:21.943
There are private commercial entities that are engaged in cloud seeding.

53:22.363 --> 53:23.824
They are creating rain.

53:23.884 --> 53:27.765
We know that that's not so hard, either to forestall the rain or to make the snow, those things.

53:28.105 --> 53:28.826
We know that.

53:29.206 --> 53:29.346
But

53:31.050 --> 53:37.294
Does this account in any way for some of the really severe weather issues that we're seeing right now?

53:37.614 --> 53:43.558
We're seeing in California and Hawaii, recently in Texas, in Asheville, North Carolina.

53:44.578 --> 53:47.060
Does that help to explain these severe weather events?

53:47.640 --> 53:52.403
I don't think we really fully know, but we've got to look into this.

53:52.483 --> 53:57.286
And if our taxpayer money is actually contributing to these

53:57.746 --> 54:06.049
floods and to these outrageous fires and to the displacement and the deaths of these poor camp children in Texas.

54:06.630 --> 54:07.590
We've got to uncover that.

54:07.610 --> 54:08.550
We've got to stop that.

54:08.871 --> 54:09.491
So it's interesting.

54:09.511 --> 54:14.293
A couple of states have now passed legislation to try to prevent geoengineering.

54:14.313 --> 54:17.374
I'm not sure they're effective yet, to be honest with you, Tennessee and Florida.

54:17.774 --> 54:19.456
because I think the geoengineering.

54:19.476 --> 54:22.900
Okay, so what the actual F indeed, Arthur.

54:24.062 --> 54:29.769
Now, let me just queue up the the thing that's coming because I have it set up in sorry.

54:33.769 --> 54:40.793
Because I have it set up in the background in PowerPoint, it's not so easy for me to go back and forth with the arrows.

54:41.973 --> 54:53.820
So what I want you to be ready to hear is the part in the recording where Mary will very briefly ask Sherry, or sorry, Sherry will ask Mary to stop

54:54.920 --> 55:05.070
Let her get another one of the questions in from the script So that then Mary will continue with the point so you can listen to this whole interview.

55:05.150 --> 55:14.779
It's on YouTube I've already downloaded it because they're gonna produce it into a show But there's like six different times in this 30-minute interview where you can hear them talking about.

55:14.859 --> 55:15.140
Okay.

55:15.700 --> 55:16.861
Do you need any more on that?

55:17.782 --> 55:18.882
Should I say a little more?

55:19.643 --> 55:22.764
And then there, you know, it's kind of like, yeah, should I say a little more about that or not?

55:22.824 --> 55:23.264
Is that enough?

55:23.304 --> 55:23.925
Did you get enough?

55:24.065 --> 55:24.285
Okay.

55:25.345 --> 55:27.166
Cause if I need to laugh again, you know, let me know.

55:27.886 --> 55:29.367
It's that kind of stuff.

55:29.507 --> 55:30.047
And it's coming.

55:30.167 --> 55:34.569
One of them is coming up right now, which I find at first, I was like, what, what did I just hear?

55:35.169 --> 55:42.493
So listen carefully occurs at a higher level than the state actually may have jurisdiction over, but, but I think we need to be exposing this.

55:42.533 --> 55:45.594
So we at children's health defense, every Sunday morning on our,

55:46.054 --> 55:48.976
CHD TV platform, we have the geoengineering report.

55:49.596 --> 56:01.322
And we have Dr. Dayton Wigington, who's been sort of an expert in this area, who does something called geoengineering watch, we have him give a report every Sunday to our audience.

56:01.482 --> 56:03.983
And so that's one of the other major things we're looking at.

56:04.003 --> 56:07.705
We're also spending a lot of our effort looking at electromagnetic radiation again.

56:07.725 --> 56:08.506
Okay, just a minute.

56:08.526 --> 56:09.086
Let me not leave.

56:09.887 --> 56:10.447
If you don't mind.

56:10.527 --> 56:11.348
No, not at all.

56:11.909 --> 56:13.290
We know about cloud seeding.

56:13.430 --> 56:17.935
Are there other forms of geoengineering that are possible or being done as far as you know?

56:18.836 --> 56:25.102
Well, I'm not an expert in this area, but I do think that there are ways to shift the weather.

56:25.262 --> 56:30.408
There are absolutely ways that the government has the right to do or the control to do.

56:30.928 --> 56:34.771
to make certain areas cooler and make certain areas hotter.

56:35.291 --> 56:54.565
And so, Dr. Dane Wigington's hypothesis is that geoengineering is being used to cool down the eastern part of the United States, sort of east of the Mississippi River, where most of the American population lives, so that they're not as concerned about this issue.

56:54.665 --> 56:55.926
But in the western states,

56:56.426 --> 57:06.852
Nevada, Arizona, California, there are places that are really on a regular basis hitting really, really high temperatures and experiencing fires.

57:10.895 --> 57:24.603
By us not necessarily knowing what's fully going on, at least a lot of people think we don't have all the answers, does it imply there's a secret federal project of some kind going on or more than one project of such a secret nature?

57:25.307 --> 57:37.455
Well, I think what we don't know about is not necessarily that it's secret, but certainly the mainstream media, the corporate media, doesn't cover these issues.

57:37.915 --> 57:39.557
So it's not a secret.

57:39.597 --> 57:43.979
The Congressional Research Service has done several reports on geoengineering.

57:44.060 --> 57:55.047
This is solar modification, SRM, solar radiation management, is well understood by Congress as a reality that the government is putting money towards.

57:55.967 --> 58:05.294
The corporate media, for whatever reason, whether they're being told not to cover it or it's not in their interest to cover, I don't know, they don't cover it, but it's not technically a secret.

58:05.674 --> 58:10.217
I think there's a lot of things out there that are just coming to the fore now.

58:10.677 --> 58:14.680
What's actually happening sort of, it's not fully a secret, right?

58:14.740 --> 58:21.945
Like the indemnification of the vaccine industry and doctors, it's not a secret, but the mainstream media has never covered that.

58:21.985 --> 58:24.707
The pharmaceutical industry sponsors their ads.

58:25.687 --> 58:38.156
I do think that there's a lot going on with geoengineering and we at Children's Health Defense, because it affects all of us, especially if they're spraying things like aluminum and strontium and barium, as we believe they are.

58:38.416 --> 58:39.857
Well, that's affecting our food supply.

58:39.897 --> 58:42.098
That's affecting the fertility of the soil.

58:42.138 --> 58:44.160
That's affecting all animal and plant life.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.281
So it has a huge impact.

58:46.541 --> 58:49.943
Again, as we said, then how does that interact with fluoridated water?

58:50.004 --> 58:53.166
How does that interact with somebody who's just had an injection of aluminum?

58:53.846 --> 58:54.647
We don't really know.

58:55.588 --> 58:57.390
And then what is your work on 5G?

58:58.272 --> 59:04.041
Well, we have a program called Stop 5G, and we're starting a lawsuit called 704 No More.

59:04.441 --> 59:10.711
So similar to this 1986 act that indemnified the pharmaceutical industry and doctors for vaccines,

59:11.286 --> 59:15.288
In the early 1990s, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act.

59:15.348 --> 59:25.093
And Section 704 says basically, localities and states cannot oppose electromagnetic radiation towers or antennas put in their district.

59:25.153 --> 59:26.413
There's federal preemption.

59:26.493 --> 59:27.414
Federal law applies.

59:27.754 --> 59:33.257
If the federal governments, if the Federal Communications Commission said, yeah, you can go ahead, Verizon, you can go ahead, whoever.

59:34.554 --> 59:36.255
There's nothing that the local community could do.

59:36.335 --> 59:40.499
We've supported local communities in Idaho and Massachusetts and many places in the countries.

59:40.739 --> 59:41.960
We always lose those cases.

59:42.020 --> 59:43.321
So we've now decided with 100.

59:43.401 --> 59:54.469
It did not work.

59:54.629 --> 59:55.650
Shoot, sorry.

59:55.670 --> 59:57.471
I thought it would work.

59:59.072 --> 59:59.653
It didn't work.

01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:08.717
So I just want to play the last end of that.

01:00:08.757 --> 01:00:12.466
I had to put it in front of the slide in order to play the end, so I apologize for that.

01:00:13.137 --> 01:00:15.298
Get a look at a lot of these related topics.

01:00:15.898 --> 01:00:20.820
Consider reading my latest bestseller, Follow the Science, How Big Pharma Misleads.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.620
Is related to your cell phone.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:31.843
Maybe some of those breast cancers that a friend of mine had because she was holding her phone, you know, reading at bed at night, maybe that is related to your cell phone.

01:00:32.564 --> 01:00:42.647
The media is run by corporations essentially, and it's not in their interest to talk about the side effects, the bad effects of their products.

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:44.431
Okay, thank you.

01:00:45.372 --> 01:00:45.532
Great.

01:00:45.552 --> 01:00:46.132
You're welcome.

01:00:46.593 --> 01:00:48.894
Everything you care about, we care about here.

01:00:50.035 --> 01:00:52.436
We're so grateful to you, Cheryl, for your work.

01:00:52.536 --> 01:00:53.777
No, I think we have so much.

01:00:53.797 --> 01:00:54.837
Do you have enough?

01:00:54.857 --> 01:00:55.178
Do you want?

01:00:55.378 --> 01:00:57.899
Yes, because we've, yeah.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.900
You're over-fulfilled.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.142
We have more topics that you could speak to, but I don't know.

01:01:03.182 --> 01:01:05.063
We're just gonna have like- Whatever works, you guys.

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:08.085
Do you have enough?

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.086
Do you have enough there?

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:10.807
Do you need more?

01:01:10.827 --> 01:01:11.387
Do you have enough?

01:01:13.788 --> 01:01:17.833
I'm not really sure what to say other than that's some shit right there.

01:01:17.893 --> 01:01:19.495
So what year is this?

01:01:20.937 --> 01:01:21.778
What year?

01:01:22.019 --> 01:01:22.840
When is this?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.382
When did this happen?

01:01:24.622 --> 01:01:25.683
With us now, Dr. Eric.

01:01:27.603 --> 01:01:33.348
Feigl Ding, chief epidemiologist, public health chair at the New England Complex Systems Institute, former Harvard researcher.

01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:34.269
It's good to see you.

01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:35.030
Thank you very much.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:39.334
I thought this was an interesting, I don't know if it's a fair tease, but it was what we said.

01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:41.035
Yes, of course, it's 2025.

01:01:41.316 --> 01:01:43.718
Does anybody know who Eric Feigl Ding is?

01:01:43.738 --> 01:01:45.900
Do you remember who he was in 2020?

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.001
Going into your segment.

01:01:48.047 --> 01:01:49.568
Going after RFK Jr.

01:01:49.668 --> 01:01:50.189
is easy.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:54.952
Finding a way to prevent autism or finding the cause of autism is hard.

01:01:55.473 --> 01:01:59.416
Why are so many people taking the easy road in this fight to save children's lives?

01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:01.397
He is reading a script.

01:02:01.738 --> 01:02:07.162
This guy was one of the worst actors on Twitter on earth.

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:16.239
He was a guy who was down for militant lockdowns, masking children with anything, including plastic bags.

01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:18.340
Like this guy was nuts.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:27.024
And he was talking about the new variants and about how deadly they would be and about how it's about to be a disaster over and over and over again.

01:02:27.584 --> 01:02:30.225
Now you might think, well, this is news nation.

01:02:30.285 --> 01:02:31.285
Who's news nation?

01:02:31.325 --> 01:02:32.986
Well, they've got Cuomo.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:41.630
And they've got this guy, which is a very interesting dude to have because he is clearly a fraud.

01:02:43.591 --> 01:02:54.579
He was on the extreme side of the opposite end of like the Christian Andersons and the Angela Rasmussen's.

01:02:54.619 --> 01:03:02.425
This guy was farther that way, farther than she makes Liana Nguyen look like a reasonable woman.

01:03:03.476 --> 01:03:05.672
This guy was a loony tune.

01:03:09.554 --> 01:03:15.715
Well, I think it is really tricky because we don't actually have the fundamental cause behind all these.

01:03:15.775 --> 01:03:16.295
And we need to.

01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:17.356
We need to.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:24.637
Chief Epidemiologist and Public Health Chair of something, Dr. Eric Fingal Feigelding.

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:33.499
Now, you might think, well, this is nothing that anybody watches, but what if my friend Jay Bhattacharya was also on the same show?

01:03:35.032 --> 01:03:36.013
on the same day.

01:03:36.033 --> 01:03:40.895
For decades, Tylenol was advertised as the pain reliever hospitals used most.

01:03:40.975 --> 01:03:52.120
Today, President Trump told the world it could actually be the pain reliever taken by pregnant women that caused the massive spike in autism rates we've seen in the United States.

01:03:53.781 --> 01:03:56.062
Don't take Tylenol.

01:03:56.763 --> 01:03:57.743
There's no downside.

01:03:57.763 --> 01:03:58.423
Don't take it.

01:04:01.229 --> 01:04:02.430
Sorry if that was too loud.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:09.295
Today's press conference was admittedly bold and came with the caveat you should probably check with your doctor and have discussions with them.

01:04:22.828 --> 01:04:32.511
But, and this is the important part, it was a follow-through on the president and RFK's promise to have a report on the causes of autism by the end of September.

01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:35.451
And as you know, this is personal to me.

01:04:35.651 --> 01:04:38.052
Last week, I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.

01:04:38.172 --> 01:04:38.852
I'm autistic.

01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:40.232
RFK Jr.

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:44.454
is right to hunt for the root causes, a condition that affects millions of children.

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:45.694
He's autistic?

01:04:46.693 --> 01:04:50.254
Or his kid, he's autistic, you gotta be shitting me.

01:04:50.914 --> 01:04:53.815
No way, he just said that he wrote a column.

01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:57.055
It is too important to become another political football.

01:04:57.075 --> 01:05:03.517
With us now, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Director of the National Institutes of Health, former professor at Stanford School of Medicine.

01:05:03.857 --> 01:05:04.377
Pleasure, sir.

01:05:04.957 --> 01:05:10.378
As they say in radio, a long-time listener, first-time caller, big fan of your work for a long time.

01:05:11.378 --> 01:05:13.879
I'm not gonna talk to you about the medicine part of this because I think

01:05:14.719 --> 01:05:16.040
The press conference speaks for itself.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.100
People can talk to their doctor.

01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:18.001
You can do your own research.

01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:27.767
But this issue of autism, we've gone from one in 1,000 or one in 2,000 cases when I was a young boy and diagnosed with what we now know to be the condition.

01:05:28.287 --> 01:05:28.967
Now it's one in 36.

01:05:29.668 --> 01:05:30.869
For boys, it's one in 12.

01:05:31.329 --> 01:05:32.810
Minority boys, it's even higher.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:35.211
It's crazy, the explosion in cases.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:43.116
Why has it been so hard to get, and I'll put it in air quotes, science to take this question seriously?

01:05:43.643 --> 01:05:45.544
I mean, I think there's like a couple of things going on here.

01:05:45.604 --> 01:05:58.313
So first, whenever doctors and scientists don't understand something, especially when doctors don't understand something, we often just treat patients who have it like they don't know what they're talking about, that the condition is not real in some ways.

01:05:59.014 --> 01:06:03.357
And I mean, I think there's some of that, like there's lots of groups of marginalized patients like that.

01:06:04.638 --> 01:06:07.079
But also for autism, you know, there's a history.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.703
That's rough because what he should have said there was that vaccine injury is treated that way.

01:06:13.984 --> 01:06:32.985
We have confused vaccine injury with this, you know, very blanket term autism to describe a whole host of neurological disorders that we don't know if they're related and how they're related, but we have come to call a lot of these things autism, and that's by design very, very inaccurate.

01:06:33.871 --> 01:07:01.518
And so what he should have done was said that we have to get rid of this extremely inaccurate term and start to define different manifestations of these early childhood neurological disorders and discern which of these signals are really largely genetic disorders from a single or multiple protein malfunction and which ones are more complex disorders that could be blamed on environmental toxins that absolutely include those that are injected intramuscularly.

01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:13.440
Think about how much of a joke this man and his language are as the head of the NIH replacing Francis Collins.

01:07:15.868 --> 01:07:20.552
A guy who was at the head of the Human Genome Project, right above Kevin McKernan.

01:07:20.572 --> 01:07:23.374
You know, that guy that's been behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:23.394 --> 01:07:25.455
and Children's Health Defense for the last five years.

01:07:25.836 --> 01:07:32.721
That guy who's been scripting all of these people on the conservative movement behind the Steve Bannon-funded joke.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:39.186
From Li Min Yan all the way to Jessica Rose and Pierre Kory and Peter McCullough.

01:07:39.206 --> 01:07:40.127
They're all on one team.

01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:55.052
And that team was designed to sabotage any possibility of a grassroots conservative movement that just didn't accept the narrative of COVID.

01:07:55.853 --> 01:07:56.994
That's what they were there for.

01:07:57.814 --> 01:08:00.137
That's what Jay Bhattacharya was there for.

01:08:00.237 --> 01:08:05.482
Listen to what he says here and realize that this was what they were gonna say all along.

01:08:07.855 --> 01:08:11.576
of this people talking about vaccines being connected to autism.

01:08:11.996 --> 01:08:18.137
And of course, vaccines are a tremendously important part of what doctors have in our portfolio of things we can do to actually keep people healthy.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:24.899
If there is a link, no one wants to talk about it, because what if it reduces the demand for vaccines that would keep people healthy?

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:34.601
I think those two things have made it so that it's so hard to get an honest conversation, because, you know, I'm pretty sure that it's probably not going to be vaccines as the cause,

01:08:35.681 --> 01:08:39.605
But by saying that, I'm acting as if I already know for a fact.

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:43.869
And in fact, I don't know why the rise in autism has happened.

01:08:44.049 --> 01:08:44.470
I don't know.

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:45.531
I don't have an answer to that.

01:08:45.551 --> 01:08:48.554
If you asked me to pin down one thing, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:55.731
It seems as though when we're watching coverage, and I don't like saying this, but I predicted this last week.

01:08:55.771 --> 01:09:08.379
I predicted in my op-ed when this report came out there was going to be far more anger about what might be the causes and saying it's wrong than in the important work to find out what is.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.881
This is just some of the doctors from today.

01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:11.381
Take a listen.

01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:18.393
I think it is pretty solid that there is no association with acetaminophen or Tylenol given in pregnancy and autism.

01:09:18.413 --> 01:09:27.580
This was a dangerously irresponsible thing for President Trump to say when he said, tough it out, because that only puts children at higher risk, especially with fever in the first trimester.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.761
I'm very worried.

01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:30.042
And who was that?

01:09:30.623 --> 01:09:31.263
Who was that?

01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:33.705
That was freaking, that was Paul Offit.

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:43.269
The guy who was on Democracy Now opposite Mary Holland literally 10 years ago, also with Rand Paul, about measles.

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.889
Do you see?

01:09:43.909 --> 01:09:50.295
It is a national security script that spans over more than a decade.

01:09:50.355 --> 01:09:51.776
That's why we can't see it.

01:09:52.237 --> 01:09:56.701
And that's why social media is the opposite timeframe, the opposite time horizon.

01:09:56.741 --> 01:09:57.942
It's 24 hours instead of 25 years.

01:10:01.124 --> 01:10:09.046
that if we take away the one last option based on really junk science, when there is not evidence to do this, we're going to end up causing more harm than good.

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:10.567
We can't just do the willy nilly.

01:10:10.587 --> 01:10:11.787
We have to be serious about it.

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.308
And frankly, there is no link when you look at the best evidence.

01:10:16.308 --> 01:10:18.429
I have to give this thing a little chance here.

01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:21.169
Every once in a while, we get some trouble here.

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:30.534
For decades, Tylenol was advertised as the pain reliever hospitals used most.

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:46.901
It seems as though when we're watching coverage, and I don't like saying this, but I predicted this last week.

01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:48.242
I predicted it in my op-ed.

01:10:48.582 --> 01:10:59.573
When this report came out, there was going to be far more anger about what might be the causes and saying it's wrong than in the important work to find out what is.

01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:02.075
This is just some of the doctors from today.

01:11:02.135 --> 01:11:02.556
Take a listen.

01:11:03.567 --> 01:11:09.571
I think it is pretty solid that there is no association with the set of menophine or Tylenol given in pregnancy and autism.

01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:18.757
This was a dangerously irresponsible thing for President Trump to say when he said, tough it out, because that only puts children at higher risk, especially with fever in the first trimester.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:27.943
I'm very worried that if we take away the one last option based on really junk science, when there is not evidence to do this, we're going to end up causing more harm than good.

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.444
We can't just do the willy nilly.

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:30.665
We have to be serious about it.

01:11:31.085 --> 01:11:33.167
And frankly, there is no link when you look at the best evidence.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:47.607
What I am more worried about when I hear that is what my mother used to say to me sometimes, seldom right but never in doubt, in that it reminds me of what we heard about COVID.

01:11:47.687 --> 01:11:50.448
If you get the vaccine, you cannot get COVID.

01:11:50.488 --> 01:11:51.389
We are positive.

01:11:51.589 --> 01:11:54.090
And if you say anything else, you must be wearing a tin hat.

01:11:54.471 --> 01:11:55.951
You remember, these people did that to you.

01:11:56.572 --> 01:12:00.634
Why is this now the same thing about any discussion of causes of autism?

01:12:01.035 --> 01:12:03.956
I mean, I think, like, you just heard it here on those clips, right?

01:12:04.136 --> 01:12:06.997
They've read the literature, I guess, and they've decided they've made up their minds.

01:12:07.317 --> 01:12:08.378
I've read the literature also.

01:12:08.898 --> 01:12:12.799
The dean of the Harvard School of Medicine agrees with me that there is an association.

01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:15.180
Now, do I know for certain that it's a cause?

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:16.460
I don't know.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.901
But I agree with President Trump.

01:12:18.741 --> 01:12:24.008
If you can avoid taking Tylenol in pregnancy, then it's wise to try to avoid it.

01:12:24.028 --> 01:12:25.750
Actually, it's true for any medicine.

01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:34.300
You want to be careful with any medicine, but especially when there's a potential link to something you don't want for your child later on, and if it's a low-grade fever, you can...

01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:41.546
manage without it, then, you know, try.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:57.498
OK, so next video.

01:12:57.538 --> 01:13:01.402
This is Democracy Now, democracynow.org, the War and Peace Report.

01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:02.684
I'm Amy Goodman, Goodman Gonzales.

01:13:02.744 --> 01:13:03.304
Yes, this is recent.

01:13:03.965 --> 01:13:13.896
We turn now to the subject of autism and false claims about the causes of autism made by President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:14.336 --> 01:13:16.699
at a news conference at the White House on Monday.

01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:31.399
President Trump, without evidence, linked autism to vaccines and said the combination MMR vaccine should be broken up into separate shots for measles, mumps, and rubella.

01:13:32.379 --> 01:13:34.740
I don't think he blamed it on vaccines.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.541
It's so bizarre that she opened with that.

01:13:38.766 --> 01:13:41.727
The announcement was about, that's already distorting.

01:13:41.807 --> 01:13:43.067
Wow, that's impressive.

01:13:43.227 --> 01:13:44.628
You couldn't remember the word rubella.

01:13:45.168 --> 01:13:57.731
Trump also recommended removing aluminum from vaccines and said parents should wait until their children are 12 to vaccinate against hepatitis B, falsely stating it's only transmitted sexually.

01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:06.474
You know, the movie Vax 2 actually has a kid that was like vaccinated when he was 12 carrying around some kind of ventilator and has a tube in his throat.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.016
Trump said you should wait until you're 12 to get vaccinated against hepatitis B.

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.953
Just working those Merck products.

01:14:20.433 --> 01:14:21.534
Which isn't true.

01:14:21.575 --> 01:14:23.937
So saying infants shouldn't have the hep B shot.

01:14:23.997 --> 01:14:33.527
They should wait when in fact it is, um, transmitted, uh, through, uh, breast milk, uh, in utero and in the home.

01:14:34.147 --> 01:14:34.668
Wow.

01:14:34.828 --> 01:14:36.329
And in the home claims.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:37.150
Wow.

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:40.534
Hep B can also be transmitted in the home.

01:14:40.874 --> 01:14:41.634
Stop lying!

01:14:41.994 --> 01:14:44.575
Damn, that is some nasty shit.

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:53.599
That the common painkiller acetaminophen, brand name Tylenol, causes autism in children if taken during pregnancy.

01:14:54.839 --> 01:15:08.925
First, effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of, well, let's see how we say that, acetaminophen, acetaminophen,

01:15:10.103 --> 01:15:10.623
Is that okay?

01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:39.703
Which is basically commonly known as Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased... See how easy it is to use the performance on stage to aggravate one side and then selectively excite or maybe deliver some kind of semi-disappointment to the other side and then they can rinse and repeat it if everybody's in

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:53.523
If everybody's scripted, that's exactly why all those people who came to the rescue of Jimmy Kimmel did it exactly the way that they did it and exactly the way that it was done.

01:15:55.464 --> 01:15:56.284
It's no different.

01:15:56.965 --> 01:15:58.606
It's exactly the same trick.

01:16:01.967 --> 01:16:03.008
Risk of autism.

01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:07.070
So taking Tylenol is...

01:16:08.937 --> 01:16:09.417
Not good.

01:16:10.658 --> 01:16:11.098
I'll say it.

01:16:11.299 --> 01:16:11.999
It's not good.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:34.373
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called President Trump's remarks about Tylenol irresponsible, adding, it's highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:48.408
Dr. Helen Tager Flosberg, founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, said, quote, "'When the President of the United States makes claims like this—' The Foundation of Autism Scientists.

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:59.612
We know that many parents will be listening, and the impact may be truly devastating," unquote.

01:17:00.697 --> 01:17:11.327
For more, we're joined by Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, where he's also co-director of the Texas Children's Center for Vaccine Development.

01:17:11.468 --> 01:17:18.995
This guy was on Charlie Rose with Jeffrey Sachs like more than a decade ago, also not by accident.

01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:25.605
Jeffrey Sachs might, I don't know, he could still show up on the political scene on the left.

01:17:25.846 --> 01:17:26.406
Nevermind.

01:17:26.626 --> 01:17:29.148
I mean, this is all a script.

01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:30.829
It's all a long game.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:31.730
That's the trick.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:36.773
You gotta know the movie, The Sting, for example, one of the best movies of all time.

01:17:38.014 --> 01:17:39.155
It's a long con.

01:17:40.436 --> 01:17:41.857
It's a long con.

01:17:42.297 --> 01:17:44.078
Mary Holland is a long con.

01:17:44.178 --> 01:17:45.299
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:45.339 --> 01:17:46.040
is a long con.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.641
He may be the victim of a long con.

01:17:48.803 --> 01:17:51.425
But Donald Trump is not the victim of a long con.

01:17:51.806 --> 01:17:54.288
He is one of the actors in a long con.

01:17:55.329 --> 01:17:58.232
Just like Hillary Clinton is an actor in a long con.

01:17:58.852 --> 01:17:59.733
These people know.

01:18:01.174 --> 01:18:03.497
Jimmy Kimmel is an actor in a long con.

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.800
Joe Rogan is an actor in a long con.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.723
A lot of them are improvisational actors as specialists.

01:18:10.783 --> 01:18:14.487
That means that they can be given a script, but then improvise within it.

01:18:16.104 --> 01:18:24.886
Those are the best kind of actors for a national security long-term script that needs to be adjusted depending on what kind of people you come against.

01:18:27.107 --> 01:18:30.228
That's the role that this guy plays, know it or not, that's him.

01:18:30.668 --> 01:18:38.830
Just like Fauci, just like Collins, just like McKernan, just like Malone, they're all national security actors on a need-to-know basis.

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:45.812
He's the author of several books, including Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism.

01:18:46.112 --> 01:19:01.211
My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist, Pediatrician and Autism Dad," and his new book, co-authored with Dr. Michael Mann, Science Under Siege, How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces That Threaten Our World.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:04.052
Dr. Hotez, welcome back to Democracy Now!

01:19:04.113 --> 01:19:10.694
I want to reiterate that point, that you are the father of an autistic daughter, as well as a scientist.

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:24.717
If you can talk about this moment, with President Trump stating one unproven fact after another, and talk about Tylenol, what we know and what we don't know.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:33.224
Yeah, yeah, Amy, it was 15, 20 minutes of complete fact-free news conference.

01:19:33.284 --> 01:19:42.131
I think, you know, the best way to approach this is to go back to first principles and understand what is autism and how does it come about.

01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:46.154
We've learned so much about autism, and I wrote about it in the book, which, by the way, came out.

01:19:46.674 --> 01:19:51.318
I wrote that book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism, after a year of conversations with

01:19:51.798 --> 01:19:52.759
with Mr. Kennedy.

01:19:53.279 --> 01:19:57.481
After a year of conversations with Mr. Kennedy, he wrote a book.

01:19:59.122 --> 01:19:59.862
Did you know that?

01:20:01.203 --> 01:20:04.945
Did you know that he could claim that he worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:05.085 --> 01:20:06.306
on his book about autism?

01:20:06.346 --> 01:20:06.986
Did you know that?

01:20:07.046 --> 01:20:08.967
Because this is the end.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:18.833
They are about to be discredited, just like you heard Mary Holland should be discredited, just like Steve.

01:20:18.853 --> 01:20:21.134
They're all going to be discredited as frauds.

01:20:23.407 --> 01:20:39.779
Can you imagine the worst case scenario is that they reveal to you that the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania was actually a staged publicity stunt and that Donald Trump is a complete fraud who was elected only because of that fraud.

01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:42.500
What would happen to the American populace?

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:50.886
How would the American populace judge those people who stuck with the health freedom movement until the end?

01:20:50.966 --> 01:20:52.548
I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:20:53.442 --> 01:21:07.273
But just imagine, because something very similar to that is going to happen when the health freedom movement becomes basically discredited in the vast majority of the minds of Americans, because right now we're very close.

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:09.455
It is not 50-50.

01:21:11.457 --> 01:21:21.785
Please understand the election near misses are an illusion, that they want you to believe that the country is very finely divided right down the middle.

01:21:23.399 --> 01:21:28.923
so that you both sides stand on their, you know, really believe that they can be right.

01:21:29.003 --> 01:21:32.166
When in reality, it's really like 80-20.

01:21:34.147 --> 01:21:35.168
And it's by design.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:40.933
It's social media that makes us believe that the truth is getting out because we are in a bubble.

01:21:40.993 --> 01:21:41.993
You are in a bubble.

01:21:43.294 --> 01:21:43.935
It's a trap.

01:21:45.424 --> 01:21:50.406
And outside of the trap are a majority of Americans that think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:50.446 --> 01:22:05.113
discredited himself already years ago when he left a bear and a bicycle in Central Park, discredited himself years ago as an addict, that Donald Trump discredited himself years ago as an actor and a philanderer and a fraud.

01:22:09.744 --> 01:22:21.029
And it is by design that Donald Trump has been used to drive some people to a point of not being able to think, but that's also not a majority of people on that side.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:26.331
But the truth is not getting out, ladies and gentlemen, it's not getting out at all.

01:22:26.391 --> 01:22:28.092
And the trap is closing fast.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.152
We need to get out.

01:22:29.652 --> 01:22:35.875
And more importantly, we need to get out by actively declaring who it was that got us in there.

01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:40.820
so that our family and friends will forgive us for this mistake.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.861
And that's, there's no, you need to figure it out.

01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:44.921
They need forgiveness.

01:22:44.981 --> 01:22:48.182
We need forgiveness because the whole operation caught us all.

01:22:49.482 --> 01:22:52.323
If you think that this guy is right, you're caught.

01:22:52.463 --> 01:22:54.823
If you think that Fauci was always right, you're caught.

01:22:54.883 --> 01:22:57.724
If you think that Daszak was a liar, you're caught.

01:22:57.784 --> 01:23:00.925
If you think, you know, Ralph Baric did it, you're caught.

01:23:01.005 --> 01:23:02.805
If you think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:02.845 --> 01:23:04.646
was trying but failed, you're caught.

01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.423
It's all one big show.

01:23:13.284 --> 01:23:14.384
That was the product of that.

01:23:14.505 --> 01:23:19.808
And then we followed up this in the brand new book, Science Under Siege with Michael Mann.

01:23:20.508 --> 01:23:22.510
But we know a lot about autism now.

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:28.674
Autism occurs through the action of more than 100 different autism genes.

01:23:28.914 --> 01:23:33.037
Now, there are more than 100 different autism genes.

01:23:33.922 --> 01:23:39.488
I want you to think about that very semantically distorted enchantment.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.171
Autism genes.

01:23:43.953 --> 01:23:45.675
Do those genes code for proteins?

01:23:46.816 --> 01:23:52.002
Do they code for specific steps or changes in the trajectory of the pattern integrity?

01:23:53.143 --> 01:23:55.346
What do those genes code for?

01:23:56.923 --> 01:23:59.725
What do they code for in regular intelligence?

01:23:59.765 --> 01:24:01.686
So why would you call them autism genes?

01:24:01.706 --> 01:24:24.623
Well, you call them autism genes because they did genome-wide association studies in these children, and they found deviations from what is considered to be the healthy human genome template generated by the Human Genome Project, and then have scanned for more impressive deviations from it, more or less.

01:24:26.397 --> 01:24:36.103
called those autism genes and then gotten very unsophisticated biologists like this guy to go around claiming that he knows all about them.

01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:51.429
And that has bamboozled another thousands and thousands and maybe even hundreds of thousands of doctors around the world to believe in that because the central dogma, DNA is translated to RNA, translated to protein, is real.

01:24:52.029 --> 01:24:54.530
Evolution is real because of the central dogma.

01:24:54.851 --> 01:25:02.755
And these people are telling you that the central dogma and its working mechanism genes, over a hundred of them, are responsible for autism.

01:25:05.037 --> 01:25:08.800
And people like James Lyons Weiler behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.480
believe that.

01:25:09.561 --> 01:25:16.546
People like Jay Bhattacharya are on that script as well, because that is the national security script.

01:25:19.209 --> 01:25:31.054
So that's why we call it an autism spectrum, not just autism, because it's a hundred, really a hundred different conditions of varying degrees of neurologic activity.

01:25:31.174 --> 01:25:34.516
All of these genes are involved in early fetal brain development.

01:25:34.616 --> 01:25:43.699
So we can explain the vast amount of autism just simply through the understanding of the genetics and understanding how these genes operate.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:44.900
In theory,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:26:06.495
We can understand autism if we looked at the function of all these genes and how they interact with all the genes that we don't directly associate with autism across time during the development and maintenance of the neurological circuitry of a young, developing human.

01:26:07.615 --> 01:26:12.039
See how stupid it sounds once you try to add words that make meaning from it?

01:26:12.519 --> 01:26:13.560
It's just like crazy.

01:26:15.529 --> 01:26:18.931
We can understand autism by the collective action of 100 genes?

01:26:19.011 --> 01:26:26.274
Great.

01:26:26.394 --> 01:26:36.958
Now, it doesn't mean that there's no environmental exposures or triggers, but it's operating through influencing autism genes early on in fetal brain development.

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:44.702
The best example we know of a teratogen or something that will affect autism genes that will give an autism phenotype

01:26:45.282 --> 01:26:50.183
is a medication called Depakote, otherwise known as valproic acid, which they didn't talk about at all.

01:26:50.263 --> 01:27:03.646
So if you're pregnant and not aware of it, and on an anti-seizure medication called valproic acid, valproate, or Depakote, it'll interact with autism genes and more likely than not could give you an autism phenotype.

01:27:03.946 --> 01:27:05.267
That looks pretty strong.

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:10.168
And there are about half a dozen other chemical exposures that may do the same thing.

01:27:10.891 --> 01:27:16.652
when, and certainly not vaccines, because again, these are all events happening in early fetal brain development.

01:27:16.692 --> 01:27:28.855
So it's not just the massive evidence showing there's no link between MMR or thimerosal or alum or all the other things they say in autism, because it's happening in pregnancy.

01:27:29.616 --> 01:27:30.936
So there's no plausibility.

01:27:31.656 --> 01:27:33.277
But then let's get to Tylenol.

01:27:33.338 --> 01:27:43.006
Now, if you know of the half a dozen chemical exposures that look pretty strongly linked to autism and interacting with autism genes, Tylenol right now is not really on that list.

01:27:43.827 --> 01:27:51.494
Because about a year ago, we had there was a very large study done out of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

01:27:51.814 --> 01:27:57.699
And this is one of the top research institutes in universities in Europe, and it showed

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:10.884
Now I want to be sure that I mention this because I didn't let the Eric Feigl-Ding clip play, but Eric Feigl-Ding cites the same papers that Peter Hotez is citing because they're all on the same script.

01:28:12.315 --> 01:28:19.259
pretty clearly among those two million people enrolled in the study that there was no link between Tylenol and autism.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:29.706
There was a follow-up study of what's called a meta-analysis or a systematic review where the study found some studies could show a link others don't.

01:28:30.607 --> 01:28:38.411
Certainly worth following up on not as higher priority from my point of view as the others higher priority ones on the list and if

01:28:39.352 --> 01:28:44.035
They held a news conference to say, look, we are interested in autism.

01:28:44.075 --> 01:28:47.277
We do think this is important for the health of the American people.

01:28:47.658 --> 01:28:49.199
We're going to convene the experts.

01:28:49.259 --> 01:28:54.943
We're going to convene some of the best neuroscientists, genetics experts, environmental health.

01:28:56.163 --> 01:29:06.265
scientists and bring them together to really pin down that complex interplay between autism genes and the handful of environmental exposures we know about further down the list.

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:08.705
We may also look at Tylenol.

01:29:08.825 --> 01:29:09.386
Fair enough.

01:29:09.466 --> 01:29:19.767
I think nobody would argue with that, but instead what we got was, and I call it fact free, this specific laser focus on Tylenol, which doesn't make sense.

01:29:19.807 --> 01:29:22.748
And then the last thing I'll say is, again, the way

01:29:23.448 --> 01:29:35.056
they talk about autism in this such sort of baby terms, in this very simplistic idea that we're going to find the cause of autism or the cure for autism.

01:29:35.076 --> 01:29:39.620
It rings hollow because we know this complex interplay between autism genes

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.744
maybe some environmental exposures early on in pregnancy.

01:29:44.264 --> 01:29:47.368
It's like talking about any other complex condition.

01:29:47.408 --> 01:29:52.593
We wouldn't say, you know, for instance, we're going to find the cause of cancer, the cure of cancer.

01:29:52.633 --> 01:29:57.037
Nobody would accept that because we know it's a complex interplay between oncogenes and the environment.

01:29:57.478 --> 01:30:03.204
So it was certainly an exercise in frustration for those of us in the scientific community.

01:30:04.258 --> 01:30:17.257
Dr. Hotez, I want to ask you how much of the rising rates in autism are the result of increased testing or recognition of the condition and how much do you feel are real?

01:30:19.249 --> 01:30:21.230
So that's a really important question.

01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:24.551
And it's a fair question to look at in more detail.

01:30:24.651 --> 01:30:28.412
Clearly, we've shifted how we diagnose autism.

01:30:28.452 --> 01:30:29.673
We used to call it autism.

01:30:29.693 --> 01:30:31.693
Now we call it autism spectrum disorder.

01:30:31.873 --> 01:30:44.537
Is it impossible for anybody in the last 10 years to have been able to say it succinctly that I don't like using the word autism to describe vaccine injury?

01:30:44.618 --> 01:30:46.278
I don't think it's the right word.

01:30:46.718 --> 01:30:48.419
Has anybody done that?

01:30:49.448 --> 01:30:51.049
Has anybody tried?

01:30:51.670 --> 01:31:00.257
No, because he's actually saying you can't because there are autism genes and then there are environmental exposures that might trigger it.

01:31:01.598 --> 01:31:04.781
And so you can't separate the environment from the genes.

01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:09.145
It's a complex interplay, yada, yada, yada, but it's mostly genes.

01:31:10.595 --> 01:31:11.656
It's a genetic thing.

01:31:11.776 --> 01:31:12.856
It's a genetic thing.

01:31:12.956 --> 01:31:13.857
It's a genetic thing.

01:31:13.937 --> 01:31:18.359
And some people apparently can just have all the vaccines they want and they won't get hurt.

01:31:18.679 --> 01:31:20.060
And other people are vulnerable.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.982
And every time they get injected, I guess it's a dice roll for them.

01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:25.923
You see the problem with that?

01:31:29.289 --> 01:31:44.339
It goes right directly to personalized medicine, the thing that the National Institutes of Health and the Human Genome Project has been talking about from the beginning, that vaccines or any medicine for that matter can't be appropriate for everybody because everybody is a different genetic puzzle.

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.783
A small subset of people might develop some kind of syndrome if they take aspirin when they're young.

01:31:49.863 --> 01:31:50.764
Other people won't.

01:31:51.224 --> 01:31:55.027
And so let's just tell everybody that aspirin is poison and Tylenol is not.

01:31:57.546 --> 01:32:06.033
Some people might develop autism after, I don't know, a complex exposure to environmental toxins, but not an exposure that has to do with injection.

01:32:06.133 --> 01:32:07.834
That's not exposure.

01:32:07.894 --> 01:32:08.895
That's not what he means.

01:32:10.902 --> 01:32:19.548
And these kinds of consistent inaccuracies, these kinds of consistent lack of continued clarification.

01:32:19.588 --> 01:32:28.354
You know, if somebody was standing behind a camera and saying that they're focusing and they're focusing and they're trying to get it in, just hold still for one more minute.

01:32:28.414 --> 01:32:30.655
And they keep saying, okay, hold on one second.

01:32:30.675 --> 01:32:31.876
Can you stand back a little bit?

01:32:31.896 --> 01:32:33.037
Can you step forward a little bit?

01:32:33.057 --> 01:32:34.358
And they never take the picture.

01:32:34.898 --> 01:32:37.240
you might think that they're not a very good photographer.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:52.012
And if somebody for the last 10 years has been arguing with somebody like Mary Holland, and they still haven't made any progress, just like Mary Holland has been arguing with Paul Offit and Peter Hotez for the last 10 years, and she hasn't made any progress either.

01:32:54.013 --> 01:32:55.754
It can't be by accident.

01:32:55.814 --> 01:33:05.360
It has to be a militarily coordinated, long-term, psychological operation on us.

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:10.704
We are being bamboozled by our own government and actors employed by them.

01:33:11.164 --> 01:33:12.485
That's why Robert Malone

01:33:13.078 --> 01:33:14.879
is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:14.899 --> 01:33:18.502
That's why Meryl Nass is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:18.542 --> 01:33:27.287
That's why Mary Holland and not Tony Bark and not Brandy Vaughn are behind the Health Freedom Movement.

01:33:28.528 --> 01:33:38.915
Because Brian Hooker, former transformer and transfector of plants, is part of the fake Health Freedom Movement.

01:33:38.935 --> 01:33:40.096
You know that guy on that

01:33:42.247 --> 01:33:47.450
They all have autistic kids or they're autistic themselves so that you can't argue with them, but autism is a myth.

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:55.634
And you had this whole very interesting discussion about neurodiversity that brings in a lot of bioethics issues.

01:33:55.995 --> 01:34:06.921
So starting in around the early 2000s, the American Academy of Pediatrics started asking pediatricians and recommended pediatricians to do autism screening between the first and second year of life.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:08.001
And guess what?

01:34:08.021 --> 01:34:08.782
The numbers went up.

01:34:09.683 --> 01:34:13.245
We also got better at diagnosing autism girls and women.

01:34:13.265 --> 01:34:14.566
We used to say it was 10 to 1.

01:34:14.807 --> 01:34:16.108
When did they start doing it?

01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:17.188
In the 2000s?

01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:19.890
You mean right when the Human Genome Project was announced?

01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:20.231
Done?

01:34:24.434 --> 01:34:25.675
Autism screening.

01:34:26.636 --> 01:34:49.245
genetic testing of children boys to girls now the proportions roughly three to one but as we get better in diagnosing autism in girls and women because girls and women tend to camouflage for autism better we often diagnose their comorbidities such as OCD obsessive compulsive disorder or some of the eating disorders it may even get closer to parity we've also um

01:34:50.346 --> 01:34:53.629
reached underserved schools in a better way.

01:34:53.649 --> 01:34:58.092
So we're diagnosing autism in the underrepresented minority community better.

01:34:58.112 --> 01:35:04.878
So all of that feeds into the likely explanation accounting for the steep rise in autism cases.

01:35:04.958 --> 01:35:11.624
Now, I do think there is an environmental component, and I remember having that conversation with Mr. Kennedy years ago.

01:35:11.644 --> 01:35:17.089
I'd say, look, Bobby, I can identify half a dozen chemical exposures like Valproate,

01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:19.051
You're an environmental attorney.

01:35:19.331 --> 01:35:20.512
This is your sweet spot, man.

01:35:20.572 --> 01:35:22.874
You should be all over this and really look into it.

01:35:22.914 --> 01:35:24.796
At the time, he had no zero interest.

01:35:25.576 --> 01:35:32.762
Now, you know, he comes along, you know, years later and talks about Tylenol, which, again, you know, is not what the science is telling us.

01:35:32.782 --> 01:35:35.565
So I do think there could be an environmental component to that as well.

01:35:36.005 --> 01:35:42.551
It should be looked into, but certainly not with the kind of rhetoric and the approach that this administration is proposing.

01:35:42.671 --> 01:35:54.956
Let's go to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recommending the use of lucavorin, claiming it improves verbal communication when given to children on the spectrum.

01:35:56.189 --> 01:36:02.474
We have also identified an exciting therapy that may benefit large numbers of children who suffer from autism.

01:36:03.295 --> 01:36:13.382
Peer-reviewed literature has documented that up to 60% of folate-deficient children with ASD can have improved verbal communications if given Lucaforin.

01:36:14.323 --> 01:36:17.325
I have instructed NIH, FDA, and CMS

01:36:18.266 --> 01:36:19.888
I'll think about how magic that is.

01:36:19.968 --> 01:36:31.001
So they have to define what a folate deficient child is, and then they give it to the children that they define as folate deficient autistic kids.

01:36:31.823 --> 01:36:37.368
That's already a sandwich of assumptions that is like, yeah, wow.

01:36:37.408 --> 01:36:47.617
Doctors who treat children appropriately, Jay, will help tell that story, which started with sound science, the kind that restores faith in government.

01:36:48.627 --> 01:36:52.068
So that's Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a man you know well.

01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:57.411
You spent a year talking to him, your book about your daughter on the spectrum, Rachel.

01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:00.352
I spent a year working for him.

01:37:00.392 --> 01:37:02.893
You could talk to me, too, about how he's a fraud.

01:37:04.614 --> 01:37:05.134
Anyone could.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:06.034
Also comes out of that.

01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:08.635
Explain what this is and what he's saying.

01:37:08.695 --> 01:37:12.677
And what does anecdotal versus evidence-based medicine mean?

01:37:14.116 --> 01:37:31.843
So again, getting back to that first principle and why we started out this way, you know, 100 different autism genes, there are many different phenotypes, there are various subsets of kids and adults on the autism spectrum who have what are called auto-antibodies to different components of their body.

01:37:31.884 --> 01:37:42.348
Some have antibodies to what are called glycosphingolipids, which is a type of glycolipid, others have

01:37:43.108 --> 01:37:59.033
autoantibodies to different membrane proteins some have what are called ANA antibodies which you can also anti-nuclear antibodies that you can find in lupus and there is a subset that seems to have antibodies against folate receptor which is a metabolite used in

01:37:59.433 --> 01:38:02.677
for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines in DNA.

01:38:02.717 --> 01:38:14.111
And perhaps for that subset of kids and adults, there could be some benefit for giving for giving lucavorin, and there are even some studies to support that.

01:38:14.451 --> 01:38:15.933
And that's the way it needs to be framed.

01:38:15.953 --> 01:38:16.493
But again,

01:38:17.655 --> 01:38:20.057
It's always spoken about in these baby terms, right?

01:38:20.117 --> 01:38:22.379
Tylenol is the cause of autism.

01:38:22.479 --> 01:38:23.680
It's ridiculous.

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:32.248
Or now lucavorin is gonna come to be used as a major treatment.

01:38:32.368 --> 01:38:42.758
Again, what we need is better understanding, better precision medicine to really focus on the subgroup of kids and adults who may benefit from lucavorin.

01:38:43.775 --> 01:39:12.591
And, Dr. Hotez, in a broader sense, this war on science that the Trump administration has unleashed, all the cutbacks in research and the reductions of university research capacities, the doctors, many researchers fleeing to Canada or to Europe or Asia to be able to continue to conduct their research, what's the impact on the United States of this war?

01:39:14.650 --> 01:39:16.991
Well, first of all, let's look at why this is happening.

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:36.640
You know, Mr. Kennedy and this new version of Health and Human Services is very tied in with the wellness and influencer industry in which a lot of it is built up whenever they can buy in bulk and jack up the price and then sell with $1,600 telehealth visits.

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.782
I mean, have you ever wondered why they're all antiparasitic drugs, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine?

01:39:42.782 --> 01:39:46.565
Phenbendazole, as we report in the book, it's because they're cheap, available in bulk.

01:39:46.605 --> 01:39:49.627
You can jack up the price and sell it with a $1,600 telehealth visit.

01:39:50.248 --> 01:39:55.051
But it also involves attacking mainstream science.

01:39:55.091 --> 01:40:04.277
That's why, you know, the- The crazy thing is, is the no-virus people are doing it, just like the IMA is doing it, just like America's frontline doctors are doing it.

01:40:04.317 --> 01:40:06.939
They're all doing the telehealth and supplements thing.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.541
Can you believe it?

01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:11.982
It's almost like it was a script.

01:40:12.442 --> 01:40:16.765
It's almost like they were briefed and they knew the destination that they were supposed to take us.

01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:21.468
It's almost like he's the opposite side of the same script.

01:40:21.509 --> 01:40:23.870
It's like one Lollapalooza of liars, isn't it?

01:40:24.190 --> 01:40:31.976
They attack vaccines, and that's why you heard Mr. Kennedy during our terrible measles epidemic that began in West Texas.

01:40:32.636 --> 01:40:38.140
You know, he says, well, yes, you can get the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, or you can get this cocktail of supplements.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.381
budesonide and vitamin A and clarithromycin.

01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:43.621
You're scratching your head as to where the heck does that come from?

01:40:44.021 --> 01:40:57.825
This is, that's his pivot to the health and wellness and influencer industry, but part of that tragically is for them, for the health and wellness influencer industry to sell their snake oil, they have to attack mainstream science.

01:40:58.565 --> 01:41:03.986
And the scientists then portray people like myself as cartoon villains or public enemies.

01:41:04.146 --> 01:41:06.767
And that means attacking the academic health centers.

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:13.468
And they falsely allege that they're tied up with pharma companies and that sort of thing.

01:41:13.508 --> 01:41:15.829
And that's where the NIH funding cuts come.

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:16.909
It's all to benefit.

01:41:16.949 --> 01:41:18.910
That's what the Maha movement is.

01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:23.491
It's basically an economic stimulus plan for the health and wellness and influencer industry.

01:41:23.511 --> 01:41:24.791
And it's very damaging.

01:41:25.531 --> 01:41:30.715
And it's particularly tough for our young scientists who are just starting out.

01:41:31.396 --> 01:41:35.959
Sometimes I feel like they look at me like Moses in the desert.

01:41:35.979 --> 01:41:37.000
Why did you bring us here?

01:41:37.941 --> 01:41:44.986
And you have to find paths of light to carve through this because it has made things very complicated.

01:41:45.026 --> 01:41:48.289
I still think you can, as we talk about in the book, science under siege,

01:41:48.949 --> 01:41:51.812
You know, where there's urgency, but there's also agency.

01:41:51.912 --> 01:41:58.076
I do think we can find a path of light through this darkness, but it's certainly gotten more complicated.

01:41:58.177 --> 01:42:06.723
We just have 30 seconds, Dr. Hotez, but I wanted to go back to this point where Trump says to pregnant people, just tough it out.

01:42:06.963 --> 01:42:08.044
Pregnant people.

01:42:09.185 --> 01:42:19.762
What is the absolutely damaging message here, when people who are pregnant are told that if their temperature spikes, this can damage the fetus?

01:42:20.323 --> 01:42:20.924
Tough it out.

01:42:21.124 --> 01:42:22.005
Don't take Tylenol.

01:42:23.342 --> 01:42:23.983
Yeah, that's right.

01:42:24.003 --> 01:42:42.958
I mean, I'm not an obstetrician, but if talking to my obstetrics colleagues, you know, one of the things that they're aware of is that just like certain harmful drugs such as Depakote has a harmful effect on the fetus, fever itself or some of the viruses that can cause the fever can have a harmful effect on the fetus.

01:42:43.079 --> 01:42:49.424
And so there may be a real downside from not taking Tylenol because we don't have a lot of options for pregnant women.

01:42:49.444 --> 01:42:50.445
You know, the obstetricians

01:42:51.085 --> 01:42:54.427
They tend to avoid using aspirin or ibuprofen.

01:42:54.447 --> 01:42:56.488
So there's not a lot of choice out there.

01:42:56.528 --> 01:43:06.574
So to come out and just push Tylenol when the evidence for it is not there is completely reckless on my part.

01:43:06.614 --> 01:43:09.916
And I don't understand why the administration chose to do that.

01:43:17.701 --> 01:43:32.175
I am going to I'm gonna go to the gym and so I will pick up where I left off here later this evening I know I make that promise a lot but it's Friday it's nice outside I do think it's gonna be possible I'll get back around 430 so maybe I'll be on around 5 p.m.

01:43:32.275 --> 01:43:37.060
Eastern Standard Time for the third installment of the Twilight Zone

01:43:38.541 --> 01:43:45.486
And in the meantime, I will play you out with music and then I will see you again in a few hours.

01:43:46.526 --> 01:43:50.449
I'm going to start with the first song that I ever used in this context.

01:43:52.551 --> 01:44:02.678
I started putting music to the stream with this song right here, which I really, really like a lot.

01:44:02.718 --> 01:44:04.379
And it's kind of appropriate to go to the gym.

01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:07.576
you

01:44:43.587 --> 01:44:44.927
I've seen the toughest around.

01:44:44.947 --> 01:44:47.568
And I know, baby, just how you feel.

01:44:47.728 --> 01:44:51.710
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real.

01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:54.510
Can't you see me standing here?

01:44:54.691 --> 01:44:58.952
I've got my back against the record machine.

01:44:58.972 --> 01:45:01.653
I eat the worst that you've seen.

01:45:13.443 --> 01:45:15.024
Why can't you see what I mean?

01:45:15.044 --> 01:45:17.546
Ah, might as well jump!

01:45:18.146 --> 01:45:19.166
Jump!

01:45:19.287 --> 01:45:20.807
Might as well jump!

01:45:20.887 --> 01:45:22.228
Go ahead and jump!

01:45:22.308 --> 01:45:22.708
Jump!

01:45:22.789 --> 01:45:25.230
Go ahead and jump!

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:26.651
Oh, hey you!

01:45:26.711 --> 01:45:28.692
Who said that?

01:45:29.032 --> 01:45:30.553
Baby, how you been?

01:46:00.438 --> 01:46:03.740
Can't you see what I mean?

01:46:05.281 --> 01:46:09.504
Alright, well, jump, jump!

01:46:09.584 --> 01:46:10.845
Go ahead, jump!

01:47:13.653 --> 01:47:13.773
you

01:47:56.786 --> 01:47:58.273
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:58.333 --> 01:47:59.620
See you again in a few hours.

01:47:59.921 --> 01:48:00.182
Thank you.

01:48:00.202 --> 01:48:00.403
Thank you.

01:48:00.443 --> 01:48:00.785
Thank you.
