WEBVTT

00:32.637 --> 00:32.777
uh

01:00.748 --> 01:03.909
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:53.331 --> 02:02.460
the masks, or behind, you know, proper testing, or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right, this technology that has never been used widely.

02:02.961 --> 02:04.802
None of that is over.

02:04.903 --> 02:13.231
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

02:13.491 --> 02:16.134
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.775
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

02:20.835 --> 02:24.817
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

02:25.257 --> 02:32.899
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

02:33.359 --> 02:34.820
All of that was on a global basis.

02:51.744 --> 02:53.405
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying.

02:53.425 --> 02:55.846
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:57.647 --> 02:58.347
And I have lied.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.428
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:59.448 --> 03:00.368
I don't want to lie.

03:00.828 --> 03:02.209
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:02.309 --> 03:03.329
I try not to be a liar.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.230
I don't want to be a liar.

03:04.790 --> 03:07.611
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

03:11.273 --> 03:12.954
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying.

03:13.614 --> 03:15.335
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:17.179 --> 03:17.840
And I have lied.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.942
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:18.962 --> 03:20.624
I don't want to lie, you know?

03:20.644 --> 03:21.725
I don't think I'm a liar.

03:21.846 --> 03:22.867
I try not to be a liar.

03:22.887 --> 03:23.728
I don't want to be a liar.

03:24.309 --> 03:27.033
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

03:46.013 --> 03:47.556
I think truth is good for kids.

03:47.997 --> 03:51.844
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:52.305 --> 03:53.948
We want everybody to feel good.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.052
That's not the way life is.

04:21.221 --> 04:38.487
I don't care how you get there.

04:38.507 --> 04:41.188
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.849
The goal is to win.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.471
What time is it?

04:49.551 --> 04:50.311
Game time!

04:50.391 --> 04:50.551
Woo!

04:57.918 --> 04:59.258
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

04:59.318 --> 05:01.319
Happy Independence Day.

05:01.539 --> 05:09.762
It's the 4th of July, and it says it's the 2nd of July on Twitch, and I don't care, because I'm staying focused on the biology.

05:09.782 --> 05:11.662
I'm not taking the bait on social media.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.023
I'm not even trying to make stuff.

05:13.743 --> 05:15.225
for social media anymore.

05:16.387 --> 05:24.198
I'm trying to do it for myself and for my kids on my own website and in my own archive and I'm doing it because I know it needs to be done.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.265
But if you're not doing something to subvert social media to

05:30.006 --> 05:34.309
try and spread this message on social media, you should probably get off.

05:34.850 --> 05:40.374
I know there are other messages to spread on social media, but the biggest one should be to get off of social media.

05:40.855 --> 05:50.182
And if you're going to use your time on a computer and on the internet, what you ought to be doing is trying to establish your presence on regular, you know,

05:51.883 --> 06:11.198
trying to get on a federated type thing you don't have to be on my soapbox you can be on mastodon and any web server around the world that does that and then get people using that system it's a it's a way of getting off of this their algorithm and start to follow who you want to follow because autism spectrum disorder is a myth that's used

06:11.798 --> 06:21.023
to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, that public health is never questioned as a reason.

06:21.523 --> 06:25.846
And the pandemic and gain of function are mythologies that have been tacked on top of it.

06:26.346 --> 06:27.887
It's kind of like a one-two punch.

06:28.567 --> 06:42.412
Everybody that needed to be was set up at the beginning to understand the mythology of autism spectrum disorder and vaccine mythology in a certain way and then they were all propelled through the pandemic and now we're out on the other side and we haven't learned anything.

06:43.385 --> 06:49.233
And we're still in danger of teaching this mythology to our children if we don't learn the truth.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.217
And that's really the reality of it.

06:52.257 --> 06:54.360
We need to learn the truth.

06:54.420 --> 06:58.605
We need to be able to teach our children why the cheese is free on social media.

06:59.266 --> 07:07.369
We need to be able to teach our children how the acquiescence to social media allows people to coordinatedly lie to us.

07:07.829 --> 07:19.974
And it's a lot like the guy in that subway where he's faking the stopping and the starting of the train, but it allows hundreds of people to perform that act and make you participate in something that's an absolute illusion.

07:20.074 --> 07:26.496
Biology is way out, and GigaOM Biological is the biology that so far they seem to ignore.

07:26.876 --> 07:28.097
I'm very happy to be here.

07:29.097 --> 07:33.740
It is Friday and I'm very glad for that because after this stream is over with I will be chillin.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.302
I will be chillaxin.

07:38.062 --> 07:42.365
I will be going for maximum chill factor.

07:42.425 --> 07:43.805
It's gonna be a nice afternoon.

07:43.825 --> 07:45.566
The gym isn't open.

07:45.606 --> 07:46.747
I've taken a few days.

07:46.787 --> 07:47.968
It's too many days.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.370
My phone has this incredible lack of red dots.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.353
on the calendar and it's driving me bananas.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.478
Shout out to Housatonicits.com and Housatonic Live.

07:58.498 --> 07:59.859
I love that guy.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.509
And shout out to the Biophenom, Biology Phenom sub stack about the murder and manslaughter in Scotland.

08:09.797 --> 08:14.740
Please share it because it will shock Americans and then Americans might think well, what the hell did they do here?

08:15.500 --> 08:33.630
Americans might wake up to the fact if they see it how awful it is in and how obvious it is in At this substack and in those videos and in those testimonies maybe Americans will think again about maybe we maybe maybe we need to figure out what the truth is and maybe social media

08:35.296 --> 08:40.143
Social media is not like these sunglasses, but rather gigaohm is like these sunglasses.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.786
If you, if you allow...

08:44.364 --> 08:50.069
me or someone like me or Mark to help you approach social media the right way.

08:50.089 --> 08:51.730
Don't worry.

08:53.412 --> 08:55.994
I think we can pull our kids out.

08:56.575 --> 09:11.548
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like an early COVIDsurvivors.com bumper sticker for your car or water bottle, if you'd like a take a home biological biologies the way velcro back patch of which I still have like

09:13.041 --> 09:15.903
190 of and I ordered 200 of them.

09:15.963 --> 09:19.626
So seriously, somebody send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Dr. J at P.O.

09:19.646 --> 09:23.888
Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, 15102.

09:24.429 --> 09:29.492
And let me send you a few stickers and see where you can put them.

09:30.453 --> 09:36.637
Anyway, this is a message from an American in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.839
And I just want to make sure that everybody understands

09:45.622 --> 09:49.904
Those stickers came from somebody we know that I think V's Bees will put in the chat.

09:50.485 --> 09:52.126
Look at how the bird stays focused.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.647
You see this bird, this particular bird, watch him stay focused.

09:55.947 --> 09:56.388
Oh man.

09:57.048 --> 10:00.790
So what we try to do at Gigo and Biological is stay focused like these birds.

10:01.370 --> 10:02.611
I don't know what kind of bird this is.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.272
I'm not a real big bird fan.

10:04.692 --> 10:05.832
I don't know anything about birds.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.354
But I think this is a fish-eating eagle of some kind.

10:11.355 --> 10:28.871
and this bird is focused and he's focused on the biology in front of him he's focused on the task at hand and we need to do that as well and social media is designed exactly if this eagle was trying to to catch his food on social media he'd never catch a fish right

10:29.611 --> 10:33.655
And so I think that's the way you need to realize social media is being used against us.

10:34.496 --> 10:39.622
And quite frankly, we need to get good at surfing it so that we can get our kids good at surfing it.

10:39.682 --> 10:44.026
And the only way to get good at surfing social media is to understand what it is.

10:44.867 --> 11:04.245
understand how the advertising works, the subtle messaging, the coordinated lying across platforms and podcasts, you're not going to be able to see how amazing the illusion is if you're not aware that Sam Seder is scripted by the same people that are scripting Brett Weinstein in the Rubin Report and also Tim Pool.

11:05.126 --> 11:05.266
Now,

11:06.232 --> 11:08.193
If you've been here for a while, you're at the top of the wave.

11:08.233 --> 11:14.777
We haven't always been surfing as well as we're surfing now, but yes, we are doing it good because we stay focused on the biology.

11:14.857 --> 11:17.579
It works if you don't take their bait on social media.

11:18.079 --> 11:22.902
And loving your neighbors is a great idea because then you got people to sit around the campfire with.

11:22.942 --> 11:24.884
You got people to barbecue with.

11:24.904 --> 11:26.445
You've got people to borrow sugar from.

11:27.445 --> 11:31.866
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological where RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection.

11:31.926 --> 11:32.286
It's dumb.

11:32.306 --> 11:36.147
Transfection is a crime and the population pyramids are real.

11:37.267 --> 11:38.687
I'm kind of a Star Trek fan.

11:38.787 --> 11:40.728
I've always kind of been a Star Trek fan.

11:40.748 --> 11:42.168
I don't mind all that stuff.

11:42.708 --> 11:47.409
Sci-fi in general, I think is really interesting because it sparks the imagination.

11:47.909 --> 11:50.229
I'm gonna let you in on a really big secret.

11:50.289 --> 11:52.970
I was also a really good dungeon master back in the day.

11:54.470 --> 11:56.813
I used to be able to run a hell of a campaign.

11:58.054 --> 11:59.275
And I'm not ashamed of that.

12:00.476 --> 12:11.026
It's one of those things where you realize right now, in the current place that we're in, one of the things that they are destroying in our children is their imagination.

12:11.046 --> 12:12.808
And I can see it happening in my own house.

12:13.308 --> 12:17.232
And it's hard to get a handle on what to do about it, especially if the only person that

12:18.848 --> 12:20.989
that is available to do anything about it is you.

12:21.290 --> 12:27.834
So if you're working at home or worst case scenario, obviously what most people are doing is they're working outside of their home.

12:27.914 --> 12:40.303
So when their kids are at home on summer vacation and they're occupying their time with roadblocks or Fortnite or whatever the latest garbage is that's on that screen, inevitably you have this problem where

12:41.912 --> 12:51.148
You can say that we had this when we were kids and I watched the A-Team and I got up in the morning on Saturdays and watched cartoons from like 6.30 in the morning until 10.

12:52.190 --> 12:55.195
But social media is just different.

12:56.098 --> 13:16.064
Social media is just different and I hope that anybody who's watching this show has already become aware of their own habits and their own vulnerabilities on social media and how easy it is to create the illusion of consensus that there are a bunch of people who agree about something and getting sucked into something like that can be as

13:16.824 --> 13:36.841
as innocent as buying a cheap thing from somewhere that nobody bought before but you, to actually participating in the slow dissolving of our sovereignty and our slow transition to experimental animal status.

13:38.562 --> 13:41.084
I'm very excited to be here, as I said, because this is

13:43.394 --> 13:44.635
It's the 4th of July.

13:44.715 --> 13:47.035
It's a great day in America.

13:47.075 --> 13:49.316
It's going to be a great day in Pittsburgh.

13:50.257 --> 13:54.078
And I don't know what we're going to do today, but we're probably going to grill out.

13:54.158 --> 13:55.559
I'm probably going to drink a beer.

13:55.959 --> 14:04.522
I'm definitely going to sit in my front yard and burn a fire and watch people drive by and wave the American flag and say hello.

14:05.602 --> 14:08.003
because it's just a good day.

14:08.983 --> 14:14.145
There are lots of people down the street who are gonna shoot fireworks and we can see those through the trees.

14:15.026 --> 14:15.806
It's nothing.

14:17.487 --> 14:30.892
Let me just say that the house that we were renting to own during the pandemic that we lost as a result of the pandemic was a house on three acres on the top of a hill that directly overlooked essentially

14:31.542 --> 14:38.714
the park, although you couldn't see it because there were too many trees, overlooked the park where the local pool was and also where they shoot the fireworks from.

14:39.335 --> 14:40.778
So the fireworks exploded

14:42.466 --> 14:45.268
I mean, to a certain extent, directly above our house.

14:45.669 --> 14:51.674
And then if the wind was right, the still almost burning embers would land in our backyard.

14:51.714 --> 15:03.664
And we had this beautiful slope behind our house that led to a campsite and another 10 acres that was technically owned by one person, but that person didn't even live in the county.

15:04.364 --> 15:07.107
And so there was a lot of wild woods behind my house, too.

15:07.988 --> 15:16.777
It was arguably one of the best houses in Pittsburgh, probably, given that it was like a hundred year old rock house with a stone roof.

15:18.058 --> 15:20.881
It would probably be a little cramped for us right now.

15:21.642 --> 15:25.407
But in a lot of ways, that place was ideal for the pandemic.

15:25.467 --> 15:38.944
And so I can only assume that somehow or another, I got tremendously lucky by starting to occupy that house and thinking that we would have it for the three years when we most needed it.

15:39.605 --> 15:54.878
And then somehow or another found ourselves on the opposite side of the city, not so happy about where we are, but in a house that's perfect for this work that I'm doing now and closest to one of the nicest basketball gyms on earth.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.982
And I've found my way back to basketball and

16:00.891 --> 16:10.398
I have high hopes that I'm going to be essentially a professional athlete because I will be teaching biology on a basketball court very soon and if I can turn that into something worthwhile,

16:24.013 --> 16:27.756
this will have all worked out in a really weird and odd and beautiful way.

16:27.776 --> 16:50.837
So I'm very very excited about being where we are and luckily being in America because I do think in the next five or six or ten years there's going to be a lot of world history that none of us can really predict although a lot of us have some good guesses and the continued deterioration of

16:52.091 --> 16:53.232
life in Europe.

16:54.112 --> 16:55.533
I'm not sure how that's going to go.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.754
I don't know if there are certain countries that are going to go bad.

16:59.574 --> 17:05.597
But I do know that where we live right now in Pittsburgh and everything, knock on wood, is okay.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.678
And things are going okay.

17:09.519 --> 17:14.421
And that means that we have enough stability on this raft to try and make things go better.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.102
And so that's my goal for the next

17:17.461 --> 17:20.886
I don't know, six months or so, and then we're gonna see where we are in six months.

17:21.086 --> 17:24.110
And that's worked already for six years.

17:24.250 --> 17:32.181
It is in July of 2020 that I first found myself able to succinctly say that they were misconstruing a background with spread.

17:33.649 --> 17:47.879
And the way that I explained it at the time in July of 2020 was that there are lots of viruses, and there are lots of SARS-like viruses that have been found and reported over the last 20 years, and we've never really monitored them.

17:49.421 --> 17:51.682
And in a way, I was kind of describing it correctly.

17:51.702 --> 17:54.724
I was just still using their nomenclature for that background.

17:54.785 --> 17:59.348
SARS viruses, MERS viruses, coronaviruses, flavoviruses, whatever.

18:00.359 --> 18:15.688
All those things, all they all are essentially at this stage in time because of the Human Genome Project and the prevalence of the use of recombinant DNA and also the use of PCR, all these things ever are are genetic signals in the background.

18:17.429 --> 18:27.535
And so they can call them different things and they can claim that they have these different specificities and this different fields of understanding and, you know, different degrees of

18:29.575 --> 18:36.600
Fidelity of understanding in these different things, but the bottom line is is that now modern virology Always starts with a sequence.

18:36.660 --> 18:58.455
So all they have to do is tell you they found something and they can start working on it so if DARPA wanted Peter Daszak to start working on a a What they thought would be a self-transmitting RNA Bioweapon then they could take a guy like Peter Daszak claim that he found the sequence make a

18:59.460 --> 19:07.267
impossible to otherwise find pure and large quantity of that DNA and put it in places and see what happens.

19:08.408 --> 19:21.399
And that's the extraordinary fact that leaves people like that guy in the big square there, Mike Eden, in kind of a shitty position because the bottom line is I didn't put the green screen down.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.862
I'll do that now if you don't mind.

19:23.882 --> 19:26.044
This doesn't take very long, it's just a magnet.

19:27.301 --> 19:40.410
That's what leaves Mike Eden in such a weird position because the deal is that Mike Eden knows how protein biologics are made.

19:41.310 --> 19:53.759
Mike Eden is a self-confessed pharmaceutical executive and pharmaceutical scientist who sold a couple companies and worked for Pfizer for 20 years and worked on respiratory disease.

19:54.279 --> 19:56.921
And so it's important that we're especially

19:59.562 --> 20:10.572
especially scrutinous of his position because he has all of the credentials essentially to be an insider that Robert Malone does just from a different angle.

20:11.232 --> 20:25.605
Has the same credentials to be an insider as somebody like Jonathan Engler or Nick Hudson or even Denny Rancor, all of whom have expertise which should suggest that they should understand some things like, I don't know, a population pyramid.

20:26.105 --> 20:32.049
And yet all of them seem to not be able to pick up on that even after three years of having it badgered into their head.

20:34.151 --> 20:49.522
And so their purposeful ignoring of the story that we've been telling, the story that we're trying to push, all puts them in jeopardy in terms of being outed as part of the same team that's curating a worst-case scenario story

20:50.430 --> 20:58.215
And making sure that nobody comes to understand the real goal here was to get everybody to accept PCR as a diagnostic.

20:59.455 --> 21:06.160
To accept sequencing of remnants as just something that's done, and there's lots of companies that buy remnants for that, we don't care.

21:07.861 --> 21:09.662
And to get people to ignore the murder.

21:10.920 --> 21:23.195
and to make sure that people didn't understand that this expected rise in all-cause mortality was going to cause a rise in numbers, was going to cause a rise in hospital deaths, was going to cause a rise in old folks' homes' deaths.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.400
And so they had an opportunity to use it.

21:28.652 --> 21:35.094
And this is not an idea that's so sophisticated that somebody like Mike Eden doesn't understand it, especially since I've told it to him before.

21:35.134 --> 21:51.519
He's been on my stream with Paul Alexander, where we talked about the fact that the only place that you can make these large quantities of pure DNA, which are perfect PCR positives, is at a pharmaceutical level.

21:52.979 --> 21:57.741
Pharmaceutical companies have the possibility of making grams of DNA.

21:59.019 --> 22:01.241
It's harder to do that in an academic lab.

22:03.703 --> 22:06.845
That's why they have this commercial process down to a science.

22:06.905 --> 22:24.138
So the only thing necessary to do modern virology is this recombinant DNA technology of growing mass quantities of plasmids in bacteria that was basically honed to a fine science by the prerogatives of the Human Genome Project.

22:24.158 --> 22:27.121
That's why genome collector Craig Craig is involved.

22:27.141 --> 22:28.502
That's why NATO scientists

22:29.703 --> 22:30.886
Jessica Rose is involved.

22:30.906 --> 22:35.695
That's why the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project is involved.

22:35.715 --> 22:37.479
That's why the guy from Gabi is involved.

22:37.499 --> 22:37.900
That's why

22:38.570 --> 22:41.611
a glyphosate scientist from MIT is involved.

22:41.651 --> 22:46.713
That's why a country doctor who's an expert on anthrax vaccines is involved.

22:46.753 --> 22:55.777
That's why a guy like this who was selling biometric surveillance to New York prisons in 2019 is involved.

22:56.157 --> 23:03.800
That's why this guy who has DITRA and DOMAIN and Zika and Ebola and Novio and

23:04.560 --> 23:11.964
and Amerithrax and all kinds of other shit on his resume, including transfection about 40 times, is involved.

23:13.966 --> 23:31.216
And so it gets to be tough after a while if Mike Eden has run in circles with Sasha Latupova repeatedly, has written substacks that are critical of me, calling me JJ like all these other people do, even after he was on my stream and I explained to him how this was done.

23:33.427 --> 23:40.072
And he had no commentary for it, even though, of course, you remember that Sukrit Bhakti said he didn't disagree with anything I said.

23:40.112 --> 23:44.595
It's just that now that we know that RNA can't pandemic, we shouldn't talk about it anymore.

23:47.197 --> 23:48.999
These people were all put in place.

23:49.199 --> 23:56.764
And if you watch the Oracle Films interview of Mike Yeadon, I'd like you to go and take notes and watch it.

23:56.824 --> 24:00.047
See if you can come away with an opinion that Mike Yeadon is okay.

24:01.510 --> 24:03.751
There's already a couple of sub stacks written about it.

24:03.771 --> 24:10.195
There's already notes on it and every, you know, highlights is already done on one of these anonymous sub stacks or another.

24:11.096 --> 24:12.556
And so it's all out there already.

24:12.636 --> 24:30.707
I suggest that over the weekend, if you're bored, you spend some time and take some notes and see if you can hear him calling these people out by name, calling these people out by name and not only calling them out by name, but specifically sticking to the script

24:33.427 --> 24:36.009
Because again, he's kind of saying there are no viruses.

24:37.229 --> 24:40.251
And he says it by saying that these people do great work.

24:41.152 --> 24:46.515
And he loops Stefan Lanka in with all of these people, and that's really an illusion.

24:48.957 --> 24:50.418
Because Stefan Lanka has a

24:52.563 --> 24:56.484
very specific set of objections and experiments that he's credited with.

24:56.744 --> 25:00.045
Stefan Lanka was also, I believe, questioning HIV.

25:00.505 --> 25:02.306
These people were not so elegant.

25:02.386 --> 25:04.406
These people were not so precise.

25:07.427 --> 25:18.590
And I think, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what condemns these people as traitors is that in 2023, under the auspices of being a staff scientist at

25:19.905 --> 25:25.759
Children's Health Defense under the auspices of Brian Hooker and Mary Holland.

25:25.939 --> 25:28.465
I approached these people and explained to them.

25:29.602 --> 25:32.983
that virology was a fraud, but not quite the way you're saying it.

25:33.563 --> 25:39.085
There may be viruses, there may not be viruses, there are definitely exosomes, and there are definitely phages.

25:39.145 --> 25:51.689
But what I also know for sure is that pharmaceutical companies and any other interest like that, including an academic interest, would have the facilities necessary to produce large quantities of pure DNA.

25:53.210 --> 25:57.411
And large quantities of pure DNA are the perfect PCR positive.

25:59.130 --> 26:03.193
Large quantities of DNA are how they start these virology experiments.

26:03.233 --> 26:15.961
And so I argued that these people could join forces with CHD and together they could explain how infectious clones is the fraud, because infectious clones is just transfection and transformation.

26:16.461 --> 26:19.003
And they actually threw it out.

26:21.192 --> 26:23.073
They asked for citations.

26:23.133 --> 26:25.254
They said infectious clones are fake.

26:25.655 --> 26:27.076
You don't know what you're talking about.

26:27.156 --> 26:28.456
Send us the papers.

26:28.957 --> 26:36.882
And then they did a five person talk that said that I was a shithead and didn't really answer any questions at all because they're all part of the same show.

26:36.942 --> 26:37.482
I'm sorry.

26:40.029 --> 26:54.385
The problem with them and the problem for them is me, because I am perhaps the only person who has had sufficient interaction with all of them because they have thrown them all at me.

26:55.799 --> 27:16.109
That's why I can say that Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler didn't even start working on me until 2023, because in 2022, I presented three times to their organization, Panda, and they didn't post any of those lectures anywhere on their Rumble channel.

27:16.129 --> 27:22.272
And then in 2023, these three people started working on me right before the book was done.

27:23.772 --> 27:26.870
trying to get me to write a virology review with them and stuff.

27:28.579 --> 27:32.021
And Jessica Hockett turns out to be one of the biggest liars in America.

27:32.161 --> 27:33.542
I don't know what her real name is.

27:33.602 --> 27:34.423
Maybe it's Faber.

27:34.463 --> 27:35.384
I've heard that before.

27:35.924 --> 27:39.246
But these guys from South Africa and from England are nasty.

27:39.806 --> 27:44.450
This is a retired pharma exec who got a law degree in his retirement.

27:44.490 --> 27:54.536
This is an actuary who's never told you about population pyramids and about how there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality across the West.

27:55.517 --> 27:57.178
This guy has never said that.

28:00.657 --> 28:10.486
And of course she hasn't either, but she's been able to have multiple interactions on Substack with Pierre Cory, the oxygen fraud in New York.

28:11.267 --> 28:18.273
The guy who was the medical witness for the George Floyd trial that said he definitely suffocated from the cop.

28:24.893 --> 28:32.379
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like J.J.

28:32.419 --> 28:47.031
Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people as sort of this kind of savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learned.

28:47.071 --> 28:48.653
And in many ways, you know, they are.

28:50.560 --> 28:55.785
So the key to see is that whenever anybody mentions me, they don't actually say what the idea is.

28:56.486 --> 28:59.248
They don't actually say what I've said, and he doesn't say it there.

28:59.809 --> 29:00.149
J.J.

29:00.189 --> 29:02.411
Cooley's take is pretty good, but what is J.J.

29:02.451 --> 29:05.094
Cooley's take, and why is it different than everybody else's?

29:05.134 --> 29:13.122
And of course, his interviewer, who is none other than Germ Warfare in that particular video, his interviewer is a shithead too.

29:15.976 --> 29:20.318
And they got caught on Twitter when I did my interview with Germ Warfare.

29:20.358 --> 29:24.280
Germ Warfare said it would take him three weeks to release the interview, but he doesn't cut anything.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.741
He just needs to get it up to production levels and stuff.

29:28.442 --> 29:35.886
And then in the first week before he released the video, Nick Hudson actually tried to start tweeting that intramuscular injection is dumb.

29:37.119 --> 29:45.862
And I quoted it on Twitter and then I said that this is stolen from the Germ Warfare podcast because the first time I ever said this was on the Germ Warfare podcast.

29:46.983 --> 29:48.263
I never said it so clearly.

29:51.084 --> 29:52.225
So it's pretty remarkable.

29:55.266 --> 29:55.546
Sorry.

29:58.027 --> 29:59.488
Because they walked right into my trap.

30:00.325 --> 30:04.106
And I'm not some kind of master, you know, intelligence agent.

30:04.206 --> 30:16.869
I'm just a guy who suspected that somebody who says that he has wine with Nick Hudson every couple of weeks, um, in South Africa, if he's going to interview me and then says it takes three weeks to release the video.

30:17.329 --> 30:17.530
Huh?

30:18.150 --> 30:21.171
I wonder if I say something clever, if somebody will try and steal it.

30:21.231 --> 30:22.891
And sure enough, Nick tried to steal it.

30:24.111 --> 30:24.731
Oh, brilliant.

30:26.412 --> 30:26.612
Nice.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.089
So anyway, not to whine about that.

30:30.149 --> 30:31.449
I don't care about it.

30:31.589 --> 30:34.531
I don't care about the stealing if they stole something real.

30:35.831 --> 30:44.515
Nick Hudson, and went with it, you know, if Nick Hudson said, yeah, I heard it from Jay, or yeah, I heard it from Germ Warfare, but he must've heard it from Jay because he just interviewed him.

30:44.575 --> 30:45.215
I don't care.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.196
Keep saying intramuscular injection is dumb.

30:48.817 --> 30:50.477
But he didn't keep saying it, you see.

30:51.117 --> 30:51.898
That's the problem.

30:52.538 --> 30:57.280
If he kept saying it, eventually somebody would remind him that, yeah, I guess you got that from Jay.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.401
But that's not what he did.

31:00.121 --> 31:06.044
And he's never said it again, because if he did, then he would be spreading the truth that's not in this script.

31:06.966 --> 31:18.388
And remember that Nick Hudson of Panda was off the coast of Turkey in a boat with Robert Malone and his wife and a bunch of other of these dissidents for a whole week in 2022.

31:18.768 --> 31:23.589
This is a coordinated group of liars that's had several international meetings.

31:23.629 --> 31:31.750
He was also on stage in Romania at the end of 2023 in November with Steve Hatfield standing in front of him.

31:32.230 --> 31:35.451
Nick Hudson is one of the worst actors in this joke.

31:41.997 --> 31:56.763
I mean, all you really have to do is have a bunch of organizations that are dissonant organizations, like I've shown in that group, and make sure that all the good ideas get sucked up and stolen and obfuscated by the front-facing dipshits, and it's all fine.

31:57.723 --> 32:05.006
You know, Nick never promotes any of the ideas that he gets from Panda as who taught him them or who said it.

32:05.626 --> 32:10.848
You know, even though they're inviting, during the pandemic, they were inviting people like three times a week.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.974
You know, he just tweets because I'm smart.

32:14.115 --> 32:15.237
I tweet because I'm smart.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.942
That's how he tweets all the time.

32:21.610 --> 32:31.552
So it's unfortunate that it's probably true that somehow or another these people have been absorbed into the narrative control apparatus.

32:31.652 --> 32:33.512
Is he a coerced guy?

32:34.272 --> 32:35.632
Is he unfortunate?

32:35.652 --> 32:36.913
You know, it's like he upset.

32:37.533 --> 32:40.233
Like, I didn't expect it to last this long.

32:40.273 --> 32:41.693
You guys have really screwed this up.

32:41.733 --> 32:43.234
This is the last video I'm gonna do.

32:43.694 --> 32:46.814
Cause there's a couple of times when he said it was the last video he's gonna do.

32:46.874 --> 32:48.375
Now this one's the final warning.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.335
It's all about digital ID.

32:51.860 --> 32:55.846
And so again, this guy who has all this biological background, you're going to see it.

32:55.866 --> 32:58.029
He doesn't teach anything about the biology.

32:58.049 --> 32:59.331
He doesn't clear anything up.

33:00.219 --> 33:08.082
He is not very specific about anything, even though he has the requisite knowledge to be very specific and to teach it well, like I try to do every day.

33:08.142 --> 33:11.983
But no, he's not going to do that because that's not in his script.

33:12.803 --> 33:17.325
I think he's on Robert Malone's script just because, you know, that one really important video of his.

33:17.885 --> 33:19.206
Look at what's on the microphone.

33:19.246 --> 33:24.828
It's a CHD microphone recording him in London while he walks down the, walks down the, the,

33:25.828 --> 33:26.990
the sidewalk.

33:27.491 --> 33:30.256
It's pretty obvious to me that we're in big trouble.

33:30.437 --> 33:33.382
These guys should make it pretty obvious to you that we're in big trouble.

33:34.905 --> 33:37.429
The scripted bullshit that we talk about all the time.

33:38.937 --> 34:05.322
Now, wouldn't it be funny if around 2017, around that same time when Brett Weinstein's finding his stride in March and getting in trouble with the students, in 2017, wouldn't it be funny if this guy also kind of had his start and got promoted and got sort of his first big public appearance in 2017?

34:05.782 --> 34:07.462
His Wikipedia is really interesting.

34:10.823 --> 34:12.085
Just like in the article.

34:12.165 --> 34:29.282
So again, remember Brett Weinstein just kind of pretended to take this guy to task But he's not really taking anybody to task if you stir first don't look into his image and his track record and what he does And what he his image and his track record is completely manufactured.

34:29.302 --> 34:34.347
This is one of the most of fake pseudo Americans on social media right now

34:35.387 --> 34:43.832
This is a guy whose Wikipedia says he was raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio before moving outside of Chicago in northern Indiana.

34:44.953 --> 34:46.994
Supposedly he grew up in LaPorte, Indiana.

34:47.074 --> 34:50.716
I grew up for a little while in Michigan City, Indiana and my dad taught in LaPorte.

34:51.196 --> 34:52.037
Isn't that interesting?

34:53.110 --> 35:06.375
Anyway, I don't think we actually crossed paths, but if we had, I would have been dressed on a bicycle with a radio strapped to the front wearing a Cubs batting hat, pretending to be Poncharello.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.656
So it would have been an interesting meeting.

35:10.617 --> 35:12.698
Anyway, let's see.

35:13.939 --> 35:16.080
His parents immigrated from India.

35:16.120 --> 35:23.163
So if you read that, normally a Wikipedia reads, Jonathan Cooley was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

35:23.604 --> 35:28.726
But this one reads, Persaud was raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio.

35:28.766 --> 35:38.431
Now what's interesting, if you go to that previous page over here, and you look at this article, if you read this article, it uses exactly the same wording.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.852
He was raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio.

35:42.372 --> 35:44.293
His parents immigrated from India.

35:44.373 --> 35:48.954
So they don't actually say he was born in Cleveland, Ohio because he wasn't.

35:52.796 --> 35:58.557
And so rather than just being honest and straightforward about who he is as a man, he's lying about it.

36:00.298 --> 36:02.919
He's being a little cheeky with it.

36:03.928 --> 36:09.912
Now, what I find interesting is to think about the timeline that we're on and the fact that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:09.932 --> 36:12.914
in 2025 is head of health and human services secretary.

36:13.414 --> 36:19.699
Marty McCary is the head of the FDA and he's not even an American citizen, like he's a dual citizen.

36:21.079 --> 36:25.903
And this Prasad guy was on social media.

36:26.003 --> 36:28.765
And so if you go to his Wikipedia page

36:29.845 --> 36:33.207
You will see that, can you see my arrow here?

36:33.347 --> 36:39.209
He was appointed on May 6th, 2025, made Director of the U.S.

36:39.269 --> 36:42.731
Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

36:42.771 --> 36:54.916
Now, CBER is most certainly the branch of the FDA that would have the authority to go back to 2020 and figure out what happened, especially with regard to the 220 EUA-granted PCR diagnostic tests.

36:59.241 --> 37:00.922
That's a lot of different products.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.727
That's a lot of unregulated remnants, and where did they go?

37:06.827 --> 37:18.876
And who of those FDA, EUA-granted products were used at big campuses like Ohio State, or Indiana, or Illinois?

37:20.117 --> 37:25.664
where there could be as many as 40 or 50,000 students subjected to regular testing.

37:25.724 --> 37:27.667
And then where did those remnants go?

37:27.727 --> 37:32.453
And were the tests that they were using even valid or were they just to create the remnants in the first place?

37:34.255 --> 37:36.518
And that could all be investigated by the FDA.

37:39.022 --> 37:42.403
if the director and the head of CBER was interested in doing that.

37:42.443 --> 37:47.064
But of course, these two cancer biologists, cancer doctors, are not interested in that.

37:47.644 --> 37:49.544
They are interested in faster approval.

37:49.604 --> 37:51.124
They're interested in cancer drugs.

37:51.564 --> 37:57.926
They're interested in the farmer's market that they have in the square outside of the FDA building.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.186
These people are complete frauds.

38:00.266 --> 38:05.327
Now, it would be hard for me to say that without very much evidence, but I think that the

38:06.027 --> 38:09.790
the last five years on the internet is littered with evidence.

38:10.290 --> 38:23.839
Now, if you remember what I just showed you on his Wikipedia, this man was appointed to his post on May the 6th of this year, and on April 23rd, he did this podcast.

38:23.859 --> 38:27.001
And VP, we are motherfucking live.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.903
I have to get the motherfucking out quick, just so people know, don't play this.

38:29.923 --> 38:30.563
What kind of show is this?

38:30.583 --> 38:31.964
This is that kind of show.

38:32.024 --> 38:34.086
You look like Elon Musk at a Trump rally.

38:36.834 --> 38:39.115
We're gonna go to Mars, my friend.

38:39.435 --> 38:40.795
Shout out to Timothy Olivier.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.815
I think he gave me this jacket a few years ago.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.176
No, I'm having a bad hair day, so I had to put a hat on.

38:47.216 --> 38:48.217
You ever have those?

38:48.257 --> 38:48.977
It's easy.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.537
Every day is a bad hair day for me, man.

38:50.597 --> 38:52.278
I was born with bad hair.

38:52.658 --> 38:54.578
You know, actually, when I had hair, it was bad.

38:54.718 --> 38:55.058
Oh, really?

38:55.538 --> 39:00.920
I'm telling you that one week before he was appointed to the FDA, he did this podcast.

39:00.940 --> 39:01.840
He has decent hair.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.321
But in mine, we became this crazy dense thing.

39:05.361 --> 39:08.682
I used to tell the woman to thin it and I would pray, could it please get thinner?

39:09.122 --> 39:09.942
And I got my prayer.

39:11.363 --> 39:13.363
One day I was like, damn it.

39:13.583 --> 39:14.824
This prayer has come true.

39:14.844 --> 39:16.764
Prayer is, why was God real?

39:16.864 --> 39:18.305
All this time I just assumed he wasn't.

39:19.025 --> 39:22.486
Or they, actually God's pronouns are they, them, those.

39:23.086 --> 39:25.967
Those are now pronouns not allowed in department.

39:29.019 --> 39:29.479
the defense.

39:29.859 --> 39:30.940
So they got rid of pronouns there?

39:31.140 --> 39:35.422
And I think that the press secretary, if the reporter has pronouns in their bio, they won't reply.

39:35.442 --> 39:37.342
They won't.

39:37.603 --> 39:38.243
They won't reply.

39:38.263 --> 39:39.363
You know, it's so funny.

39:39.823 --> 39:43.345
Like sometimes these guys blow people up and sometimes these guys blow people up.

39:43.365 --> 39:45.006
So the left had their way for how many years?

39:45.066 --> 39:46.206
Now the right's doing their thing.

39:46.686 --> 39:49.087
It's just reaction, counter reaction, reaction, counter reaction.

39:49.207 --> 39:51.008
You have to see that we are under attack.

39:51.148 --> 39:52.669
America has been subverted.

39:53.029 --> 39:55.150
The FDA is absolutely

39:56.150 --> 40:08.304
useless and we have traders at the top, posers at the top, people who have been told since maybe 2017 that we're going to make something of you, we're going to use you, just like they told Brett Weinstein.

40:10.734 --> 40:14.156
And now we are eight years later, and this is where we are.

40:14.336 --> 40:16.258
Eight years later, and this is where we are.

40:17.178 --> 40:28.886
One week before he's appointed to the FDA, where he becomes some kind of podcast host, I guess, and gives a couple, you know, good presentations, because that's what he's been practicing for the last 10 years.

40:29.466 --> 40:33.309
This fraud, foreign born fraud,

40:35.089 --> 40:53.843
is at the head of the only agency in America that could reverse the ridiculous behavior of our society for the last five years by going back and reevaluating what they gave EUAs to and whether or not any of those products were worth what they did.

40:53.863 --> 40:58.227
Because if they didn't do anything, then we have a very big problem on our hands.

40:58.267 --> 41:00.028
There was an awful lot of fraud going on.

41:01.465 --> 41:07.646
And more importantly, the whole idea of PCR as a diagnostic, which is still just an accepted thing.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.267
There's no more regulation of it.

41:11.767 --> 41:16.488
Because it's, you know, these products come out and they're not supposed to be the only diagnostic.

41:16.548 --> 41:22.109
It's also supposed to be combined with the doctor's, you know, observations of the patient, yada, yada, yada.

41:22.149 --> 41:25.050
So they're not really a high fidelity diagnostic.

41:25.090 --> 41:26.070
They're not claimed to be.

41:26.130 --> 41:30.351
There's nothing that says it on the box, but the doctors are using it that way.

41:31.920 --> 41:36.466
You heard Mary Talley Bowden say it in the interview that she did with me three years ago.

41:37.327 --> 41:40.872
Well, now I have one in my office that does 17 different viruses.

41:47.054 --> 41:52.159
That's the world of duality, as we say in the spiritual-industrial complex, or SIC.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.621
Well, look at all these comments already.

41:55.142 --> 41:55.883
It got thinner.

41:56.363 --> 41:57.684
I don't know what that means, Sophia.

41:58.205 --> 42:02.089
Are you talking about, are you like from Silence of the Lambs?

42:02.129 --> 42:04.791
She's like, it gets thinner or it gets the hose again.

42:08.149 --> 42:09.150
Man, it's been a minute though.

42:09.170 --> 42:09.850
It's been a long time.

42:09.890 --> 42:10.851
How many months has it been?

42:11.051 --> 42:11.892
We were just having dinner.

42:11.952 --> 42:13.313
The show was a surprise.

42:13.393 --> 42:16.315
It was a side hustle from dinner because we were like, let's hang out.

42:16.535 --> 42:20.919
And contrary to popular belief, Vinay and I are friends and we hang out.

42:20.939 --> 42:23.161
We just don't necessarily want to make shows all the time.

42:23.181 --> 42:24.422
We don't always record what we're saying.

42:24.462 --> 42:26.283
That's right, because we would go to jail.

42:26.423 --> 42:27.304
Yeah, probably.

42:27.404 --> 42:28.565
And at least be canceled.

42:29.165 --> 42:31.448
It can't be a record of every conversation, yeah.

42:31.528 --> 42:32.730
Yeah, Ashley likes her jacket.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.993
She says, I feel the bad hair days, my hair is so thick.

42:35.013 --> 42:36.314
See, you have thick hair too.

42:36.715 --> 42:39.839
It is very thick and poofy, so sometimes it doesn't.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.461
You know, you do yoga, right?

42:41.501 --> 42:46.487
They're using a very expensive microphone that actually has a two-way condenser there, so it's like got...

42:47.168 --> 42:53.515
You know, this side and the other side, it's like made for a conversation, so it's a very nice mic.

42:53.555 --> 42:55.818
That's why they're sitting so close together, too.

42:55.858 --> 43:00.363
They don't realize they don't need to be quite that close to the condenser, but they do need to be about that close.

43:00.383 --> 43:01.464
A little less, maybe, but...

43:02.425 --> 43:03.326
I do, I do.

43:03.346 --> 43:04.607
That's what keeps me so flexible.

43:05.067 --> 43:08.149
You look like one of those guys that you see on like a National Geographic.

43:09.069 --> 43:13.472
You can hear they kind of balanced it so that if they're facing the camera, it's fine.

43:13.512 --> 43:16.114
But when they face each other, they're actually overloading it.

43:16.154 --> 43:17.475
You can hear it clip a little bit.

43:18.155 --> 43:25.483
Also using an autofocus camera, which works if there's only one thing to focus on, but not if you have the face recognition and there's two faces and it keeps going to the background in front.

43:37.094 --> 43:41.297
Ken, what we're dealing with here is incredible arrogance.

43:41.737 --> 43:46.500
They know that they're going to win because they've been winning for the last five years.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.961
Everything they say wins.

43:48.021 --> 43:51.363
They get in newspaper articles like they were promised.

43:51.383 --> 43:53.284
They're getting all the views like they promised.

43:53.384 --> 43:54.245
He loves it.

43:56.425 --> 43:57.686
I think I'm the most flexible person.

43:58.086 --> 44:00.367
I think my advantage is probably upper body strength.

44:01.167 --> 44:03.868
Because a lot of people who do yoga are, I mean, some of the best people are women, of course.

44:03.988 --> 44:10.691
Women are usually lower body strength, like roof, but upper body strength is... So what kind of poses are you typically strong at with upper body then?

44:11.192 --> 44:12.932
I could hold plank for several minutes.

44:12.973 --> 44:13.733
We should do a live plank off.

44:17.135 --> 44:21.499
Was that was that a video was that a movie with John Travolta plank off plank off?

44:21.599 --> 44:23.120
Oh my god, that should be okay.

44:23.140 --> 44:24.221
Yeah, so you can do planks.

44:24.261 --> 44:40.616
That's good I realized I realized if I don't look at the camera the focus is focused its face detecting and it sees side faces It's like I don't know what to do some guys at least I have to keep staring at the camera AI is not as good as it needs to be doesn't have I doesn't have I it just has a You know, a lot of people don't have I

44:42.286 --> 44:42.786
Real people.

44:42.906 --> 44:44.647
The eye is the part we've been looking for a long time.

44:44.667 --> 44:45.467
Let's launch into that.

44:45.507 --> 44:46.067
Let's launch into that.

44:46.087 --> 44:51.349
It's funny, because we have a different regime now running health and human services and healthcare.

44:52.190 --> 44:58.252
And people are saying, like, it's all very much on political lines, like people who hated the response to COVID are rejoicing.

44:58.652 --> 45:00.793
People who thought- People like me.

45:00.813 --> 45:01.633
Let's not forget.

45:01.733 --> 45:02.553
The VP.

45:02.833 --> 45:04.114
Oh, people like me.

45:04.234 --> 45:05.434
See how cocky he is?

45:05.474 --> 45:10.476
He already knows, because he already knew back in 2020 that he had the chance.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.381
that he was auditioning.

45:13.141 --> 45:18.845
And this guy probably thinks he was auditioning to it, that they just chose his friend, but that's pretty much a win for him.

45:20.346 --> 45:21.267
That's where we are.

45:22.368 --> 45:24.109
Jay Bhattacharya, the same thing.

45:24.169 --> 45:25.750
He was on Robert Malone's script.

45:25.770 --> 45:31.454
That's why he told me three times in person to stop naming names and specifically stop naming Robert Malone's name.

45:31.895 --> 45:38.619
That's why Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense told Brian Hooker to fire me because of the one minute section in my,

45:39.480 --> 45:47.186
in my December 22nd podcast where I questioned whether Robert Malone was really a supporter of CHD and Robert F. Kennedy or not.

45:47.206 --> 45:50.148
And that was still at a time when I thought Robert F. Kennedy was a good guy.

45:50.648 --> 45:57.333
This is a disaster for them because I can't explain succinctly why they are all frauds.

45:59.475 --> 46:04.018
And it sucks for them because I'm in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

46:03.998 --> 46:06.700
's book and there's no way to explain it any other way.

46:07.645 --> 46:12.910
Why the hell is my name in that book and not Charles Rixey, not Kevin McKernan?

46:16.533 --> 46:17.935
Why the hell am I in the index?

46:18.035 --> 46:19.756
Why am I in the cast of characters?

46:19.877 --> 46:23.660
Why do I have quotes in that book that say they wouldn't even need a virus?

46:25.622 --> 46:26.563
Because it's the truth.

46:28.069 --> 46:30.651
and maybe because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:30.711 --> 46:34.613
is just a tool, and so they didn't realize that I got it in.

46:34.673 --> 46:42.419
Why is the Sina Bavari and Allison Totura paper in that book, and nobody realizes that that's an admission in and of itself?

46:46.822 --> 46:52.325
Because they're all on a really shitty script, and most of them probably unaware of how shitty the script is.

46:52.345 --> 46:54.467
They're just really happy they got a job at the FDA.

46:55.109 --> 46:57.090
And I actually don't care at all.

46:57.150 --> 46:57.931
It's very strange.

46:57.971 --> 47:02.233
Like my whole set of belief structures has kind of just been like, yeah, I don't know.

47:02.633 --> 47:04.294
Not a fan of RFK, I've said that publicly.

47:04.394 --> 47:12.258
But what I think we could talk about is where is the actual intelligence in general on either political side in terms of doing science?

47:12.278 --> 47:13.158
Let's just take vaccine.

47:13.479 --> 47:16.500
So everybody's talking about now, okay, measles is happening.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.601
Go right to the hard stuff.

47:18.081 --> 47:19.622
Because you can talk about,

47:20.242 --> 47:35.949
your moral beliefs around these things, and oh my God, there's conspiracies of this, or we should mask everybody or give every infant child a COVID vaccine, or we could actually go, well, how would you actually design a trial or actually look at this to see what should we do?

47:36.769 --> 47:37.490
That's a good question.

47:37.530 --> 47:39.911
So which vaccine should we talk about?

47:39.931 --> 47:44.233
I think a fall COVID-19 shot maybe.

47:44.253 --> 47:44.633
Okay.

47:45.433 --> 47:49.097
I mean, what I would do is I would say- What's the current recommendation, by the way?

47:49.517 --> 47:58.006
The last year's recommendation by a gentleman named Peter Marks, who's currently probably shopping his CV around a few companies.

47:58.847 --> 48:00.149
I got a CV.

48:00.189 --> 48:01.430
He wants to be my gaffer.

48:01.570 --> 48:05.272
Is it going to work for Moderna or Pfizer or both or all of the above?

48:05.692 --> 48:12.516
Well, it was based on, first of all, he picked a strain to target based on an analogy to purchasing milk.

48:13.137 --> 48:15.258
So, you know, obviously it was very scientific there.

48:15.298 --> 48:18.000
He's like, we could go after this strain or that strain.

48:18.020 --> 48:22.222
But when I go to the milk case, I like to get the most recent jug of milk.

48:23.683 --> 48:24.283
That's what he said?

48:24.303 --> 48:25.404
That's what he said, yeah.

48:25.464 --> 48:27.444
And that is the strength of the recommendation.

48:27.544 --> 48:31.566
So imagine if we managed HIV that way, it would just be like the slogan would be Got AIDS?

48:32.926 --> 48:33.606
Got AIDS.

48:33.806 --> 48:36.227
So that's disturbing, but okay, keep going.

48:36.327 --> 48:40.269
Well anyway, so they, it's been a while since I talked about these topics, or even cared.

48:40.329 --> 48:46.731
Now if you really see it as a script, it then becomes very interesting that he brings up AIDS of all things.

48:48.263 --> 48:52.748
If you really see it as a script, they were just talking about measles, but now he went and jumped with AIDS.

48:53.068 --> 48:55.991
That's because he knows that's something that needs to be hit.

48:56.932 --> 48:57.973
And what's being hit there?

48:58.134 --> 48:58.814
AIDS is real.

48:59.915 --> 49:01.477
That's what they just said and agreed on.

49:01.577 --> 49:02.078
AIDS is real.

49:04.170 --> 49:05.051
about these topics.

49:05.071 --> 49:07.392
It's been a while since I talked about it.

49:07.592 --> 49:11.295
I mean, last year recommendation was, you know, of course the booster starts when you're six months old.

49:11.735 --> 49:12.856
You got to get it in early, right?

49:12.916 --> 49:16.018
Early and often they say about the boosting these kids for COVID.

49:16.298 --> 49:17.819
Six months to all ages.

49:18.399 --> 49:22.882
And it was a vaccine that had no randomized control trials powered for any clinical endpoint.

49:23.282 --> 49:24.323
So we don't know what reduces.

49:24.743 --> 49:28.826
So he's saying no randomized control trials powered for any clinical endpoint.

49:28.866 --> 49:30.867
So again, he's kind of

49:32.025 --> 49:39.798
finishing his audition to join the RFK team because, you know, no placebo-controlled trials is one of their shtick.

49:39.838 --> 49:42.883
That's Aaron Seery's shtick for the last five years.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.981
catching COVID or getting severe COVID or anything like that.

49:47.461 --> 49:54.664
What I think a sensible scientific solution would be, you allow the company some flexibility in what target they want to go after.

49:55.204 --> 49:57.224
I don't think that has to be proscribed by FDA.

49:57.384 --> 50:06.567
We've got a lot of heat for having to tell, you know, telling people, like not telling people the target, but companies should be a little bit free to either go after sort of a parent strain of it or the most recent strain.

50:07.087 --> 50:11.209
And then companies should be said, run a randomized trial September-ish.

50:12.309 --> 50:17.515
August, September-ish when the air conditionings are blowing, you know, because the air conditioning can spread it apparently.

50:18.576 --> 50:22.820
And power your trial for reduction in hospitalization due to COVID.

50:23.601 --> 50:27.345
And then the first thing the company, they'll say the company stats guy is like, well, how big that trial going to be?

50:27.785 --> 50:29.527
And they'll be like, oh, you want to include the six months old?

50:29.887 --> 50:30.948
And they're like, yeah, sure, why not?

50:30.968 --> 50:32.650
They'll be like, oh, then the trial will be 10 million people.

50:32.850 --> 50:35.271
And like, okay, now, because you know, the event rate is so low.

50:35.311 --> 50:38.733
So then they're going to say, okay, now let's, why don't we target the elderly?

50:38.753 --> 50:39.734
Why don't we go after 65 or 70?

50:39.854 --> 50:41.455
I was like, oh, target the elderly.

50:41.495 --> 50:41.715
Hmm.

50:41.935 --> 50:44.376
That's an interesting, so you're saying focus protection.

50:44.496 --> 50:44.636
Yeah.

50:44.676 --> 50:46.117
How about a little focus protection?

50:46.137 --> 50:47.078
Like, oh, that sounds good.

50:47.118 --> 50:47.418
Okay.

50:47.618 --> 50:49.719
So let's go after 65 or, or let's.

50:49.799 --> 50:59.004
Do you actually believe he would ever wear that baseball cap outside or is he just wearing it right now so that he can look like an American?

51:02.959 --> 51:06.861
say 65 with comorbidities or 75 and then they'll say maybe the same.

51:07.022 --> 51:12.285
I see his current outfit as a lot like how Steve Bannon dresses.

51:12.685 --> 51:14.486
Steve Bannon is a complete fraud.

51:15.627 --> 51:20.090
I'm a working man with a Carhartt jacket and three pens.

51:20.570 --> 51:21.971
His biggest joke

51:23.925 --> 51:27.446
The only reason why he buys Carhartt shirts is because he's such a fat ass.

51:27.486 --> 51:29.566
That's probably the only reason why he wears them.

51:29.987 --> 51:34.448
And because he thinks that it makes working class people identify with him.

51:34.488 --> 51:35.748
He's such a fraud.

51:35.888 --> 51:40.829
Temple size should be like something like 20,000 or 15,000 or 30,000, depending on the event, right?

51:41.389 --> 51:48.011
And then they'll run the study and then the study can accrue the, you know, 10% of Americans who want to

51:48.151 --> 51:54.017
Think about the guy who's sitting at the FDA on those podcasts now with his fancy socks and his fancy shoes.

51:54.458 --> 52:01.465
Do you really think professor at Stanford of oncology has a hat like that in his repertoire?

52:01.565 --> 52:02.006
Come on.

52:03.069 --> 52:08.071
participate in such a study, if there's even that, because I think now it's become so polarized, there's huge chunks.

52:08.311 --> 52:11.272
Yeah, I wouldn't enroll in the study, to be honest with you, because I'm not worried.

52:12.073 --> 52:15.314
But they'll run their study, and then they'll get approval if they have a positive endpoint.

52:15.354 --> 52:16.895
I think that's the scientific way.

52:17.715 --> 52:21.457
Like for all drug products, you run a trial, if the trial meets a clinically-.................................................................................................................................

52:31.881 --> 52:34.582
that you can have that Carhartt jacket, I think that's cool.

52:34.922 --> 52:36.463
Relevant end point, you get drug approval.

52:37.523 --> 52:38.524
So that's how I do that one.

52:38.704 --> 52:40.765
Yeah, and what's the chances of that happening?

52:41.225 --> 52:42.125
I don't know, actually.

52:42.165 --> 52:44.106
That ball's in Marty's court.

52:44.446 --> 52:45.187
We gotta bring him back!

52:45.527 --> 52:52.850
We got Marty on the VPZ, but now he's in power, and we know power corrupts, and absolute power doesn't corrupt at all.

52:52.950 --> 52:53.490
Is that the saying?

52:53.730 --> 52:54.431
Marty is like...

52:55.251 --> 52:57.232
like Batman and the third Batman.

52:57.352 --> 52:59.272
He's like so above it all.

52:59.552 --> 53:04.694
He can give it up at any time and be on the piazza sipping a drink with Catwoman.

53:04.774 --> 53:08.135
Now with Marty, it's going to be a gold schlager on the rocks.

53:08.235 --> 53:09.075
A gold schlager.

53:09.155 --> 53:10.316
Or perhaps a peach schnapps.

53:10.436 --> 53:13.136
I know Marty's predispositions.

53:13.316 --> 53:14.097
And a bowl of soup.

53:14.217 --> 53:15.557
And a bowl of soup, that's right.

53:15.857 --> 53:17.878
Yeah, but I think Marty's a good person to put in charge of it.

53:18.798 --> 53:19.538
We'll see what happens.

53:19.718 --> 53:20.619
But okay, let's talk about another thing.

53:20.959 --> 53:23.099
What about if you want to do good vaccine science around safety?

53:23.119 --> 53:23.720
Yeah.

53:23.740 --> 53:24.720
Because I heard they want to do this.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.821
I heard the result is coming soon.

53:26.841 --> 53:27.781
Well, I don't know about the result.

53:27.801 --> 53:29.122
I hear we're curing autism soon.

53:29.362 --> 53:30.802
I hear they want to study it.

53:31.502 --> 53:34.804
And it hasn't been studied, apparently, at all.

53:35.204 --> 53:36.804
Well, OK, that's an interesting question.

53:37.205 --> 53:37.685
I want to make it.

53:37.825 --> 53:39.365
So autism is real.

53:41.366 --> 53:46.768
Autism is real, and it's a complex combination of environmental and genetic factors that brings it about.

53:48.149 --> 53:51.510
Just like James Lyons Weiler said, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:51.530 --> 53:54.331
said, there's profound autism and then there's this other stuff.

53:56.969 --> 53:57.829
Autism is real.

53:57.849 --> 54:00.990
A table of all the vaccines and all the autism studies.

54:01.050 --> 54:02.331
I think it's been studied many, many times.

54:02.351 --> 54:02.931
Exactly right.

54:02.971 --> 54:03.491
That's my point.

54:03.551 --> 54:05.712
But I think a lot of them are MMR.

54:06.852 --> 54:09.793
And I think that some of their claims are like, well, what if it's the combo?

54:10.513 --> 54:14.334
And it's hard to, like, I want to know exactly the landscape of studies.

54:14.794 --> 54:15.334
That's one too.

54:15.554 --> 54:20.856
But I think if you really wanted to study it, you shouldn't, I wouldn't frame it as a study for autism.

54:21.596 --> 54:27.498
I would frame it as we want to study the safety signals of all vaccines, whatever those safety signals are.

54:27.838 --> 54:30.819
So I think it's actually possible that he's just a dipshit.

54:31.560 --> 54:36.741
He's just so naive to the idea that vaccines might cause problems.

54:36.781 --> 54:40.303
He's such a moron that he's never considered it before.

54:40.323 --> 54:42.143
It wouldn't surprise me if he has no kids.

54:44.992 --> 54:47.213
I actually think he might be a stooge.

54:47.974 --> 54:48.954
And that's what they need.

54:49.174 --> 54:51.536
I think Brent Weinstein is also a stooge.

54:53.157 --> 55:06.084
And because they're not sophisticated enough to really see the big picture, because they're just gunners, they're just trying to get an A on the test, even as adults, they still think that there's something like that in the adult world.

55:07.045 --> 55:12.568
And it's the approval of their friends or the people that they respect behind the scenes or their dad or whatever.

55:13.028 --> 55:13.929
But this is sad.

55:15.131 --> 55:19.012
Because what we're teaching at Giga Home Biological isn't that hard to understand.

55:19.072 --> 55:28.656
It just puts into question their fundamental understanding of what it is they do and what it is they think they work on as doctors and as scientists.

55:28.716 --> 55:37.899
Because once they understand that the high-fidelity understanding that they thought they had isn't true, it starts to humble people.

55:38.399 --> 55:40.080
Sometimes you just got to reject it.

55:40.740 --> 55:52.632
And I think that could happen with somebody in the military, for example, who ran into a podcast that made him question the existence of large nukes.

55:53.293 --> 56:01.461
After 20 years of being in the military, assuming that that's the worst case scenario, and assuming that that prerogative is real, it might be a real

56:04.093 --> 56:11.738
It might be a real difficult revelation to have that maybe they lied about nuclear weapons, even if they can make them, they didn't make them, they just told us that they could.

56:13.119 --> 56:24.106
Even just considering that thought and being challenged to consider that thought for the first time in your life, even if your conclusion is, no, I think they made them, is still something that not everybody is ready to do.

56:24.187 --> 56:26.208
Not everybody even has the circuitry to do.

56:28.618 --> 56:37.705
And so you're in a very nice place on the internet where the majority of the people in the chat have the circuitry to reconsider what it is that they assume in every scenario.

56:38.766 --> 56:42.429
And it takes a while to exercise your brain to the point where you can get there.

56:43.249 --> 56:44.991
It's not a weakness, it's a strength.

56:46.092 --> 56:52.817
Where every time you're asked to, you can check all the variables, including the presuppositions of where you are.

56:57.731 --> 56:59.052
These guys clearly cannot.

56:59.332 --> 57:10.281
I think they've been drafted into a script and told the script to a certain extent is going to rope together and neutralize the anti-vax movement.

57:10.401 --> 57:12.983
And so that's a noble lie and a noble cause.

57:13.063 --> 57:21.970
And he probably was drafted into that task, just like Brett Weinstein was probably drafted into that task, that when this pandemic happens,

57:22.771 --> 57:35.500
we're going to have to have useful skeptics that we can use to get us to the end point and the end point we're not there yet because it's like a nine-year plan and the end point will be the next thing that a test can find.

57:35.921 --> 57:44.487
That's what I'm guessing right now that there's going to be because PCR testing is not going to be questioned by these people so it's still a tool and still a way that they can do it.

57:45.725 --> 57:48.426
I think the only way to do it is a prospective data collection.

57:48.606 --> 57:57.188
In other words, I do not think you are able, that it's possible to take existing data sets and get at any greater truth than what we've gotten.

57:57.748 --> 58:10.812
I think if you want to do it, you would say starting this summer, we're going to take 75 sites and literally collect tons of data going forward on anyone getting vaccine, getting vaccine a month later and things like that.

58:11.432 --> 58:12.612
So that's absurd, right?

58:12.692 --> 58:30.917
One of the things that they could do, that CHD could have advocated to do already 10 years ago, or I guess it would be 8 years ago, would be to advocate for the intense inspection of all babies' medical records that die of SIDS.

58:32.844 --> 58:39.550
Because if all those babies that die of SIDS have a commonality in their medical records, that would be worth knowing.

58:39.590 --> 58:44.694
But no one's ever done that study, especially in the context of vaccination.

58:44.734 --> 58:51.520
But again, remember, the idea is to pretend that you are skeptical and you are reasonable.

58:52.460 --> 58:55.783
And in so doing, one of the things that they have to do is

58:57.250 --> 59:01.574
get everybody listening to accept the presupposition that there are good vaccines.

59:02.155 --> 59:10.843
There are just times when it seems like vaccines or a combination of them might result in adverse side effects.

59:10.903 --> 59:12.965
But in general, vaccines are good.

59:13.485 --> 59:17.089
And that is the assumption that even Mary Holland works under.

59:18.075 --> 59:22.798
and has been working under since around 2015 when she came out on Democracy Now!

59:22.978 --> 59:28.682
opposite Paul Offit and started this elaborate decade-long show.

59:29.960 --> 59:32.903
What's your control, or who would be the negative group, just people who decline?

59:33.103 --> 59:38.948
People who decline, or you could do some time series analysis, like people who get it one month later, depending on birthday or something like that.

59:39.668 --> 59:44.172
Because you could examine people who delay vaccines, they don't like the schedule, they think it's too packed, they delay it.

59:44.853 --> 59:45.894
How many of them are getting sick?

59:46.034 --> 59:47.595
Well, we've already done that study.

59:47.755 --> 59:57.684
The CHD had that data already in 2017 from Paul Thomas, and they also had data from other doctors' offices that they never really bothered to break down and work on.

59:58.968 --> 01:00:03.392
where just those kids had less doctor visits, less allergies, less, less.

01:00:06.674 --> 01:00:08.016
And so it's a hamster wheel.

01:00:09.237 --> 01:00:11.899
Their audience is on a little different part of the wheel.

01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:14.021
They're a little behind us or a little ahead of us.

01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.603
It doesn't matter because the rungs are all going to come back again.

01:00:18.631 --> 01:00:28.878
Or even comparing like, you know, like a kid who gets a vaccine at say six months of age against a five month old kid for at least the next month, you know?

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:35.863
I really think for at least the next month, you see, I really think they're naive because they don't, they're almost there.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.645
And they'll never get there now.

01:00:38.745 --> 01:00:41.107
But this is evidence that they are naive.

01:00:41.147 --> 01:00:42.328
They're so cocky.

01:00:43.612 --> 01:00:45.574
because they already know he's got the job.

01:00:45.954 --> 01:00:55.564
They're so cocky that they just talk off the cuff and almost get there and say, you know, it'd be interesting if they just looked at kids who get vaccines at six months and you know, the month after or so.

01:00:56.305 --> 01:00:59.488
Ooh, that was almost too close for comfort, right?

01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:01.651
But you can see how naive he is.

01:01:03.254 --> 01:01:04.955
And they put him back on script, trust me.

01:01:04.975 --> 01:01:05.756
They'll get him right back.

01:01:05.776 --> 01:01:06.857
That's why it's all.

01:01:06.877 --> 01:01:09.579
Somebody who's just below on the cutoff.

01:01:10.119 --> 01:01:11.720
But I think what- So it gets worse.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.721
It gets worse.

01:01:12.761 --> 01:01:13.582
You can watch this.

01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:15.103
It's from April 23rd, 2025.

01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:17.925
It's their last live that they did.

01:01:19.286 --> 01:01:24.590
The other thing that's kind of scaring me is that there seems to be a projection of hopelessness.

01:01:25.706 --> 01:01:43.744
On our side, the conservative side, we even have international politicians that are being promoted by X and being promoted by this group of bought out people on Rumble and on YouTube, like Jimmy Dore, who I've met in person and gave an annotated

01:01:44.966 --> 01:01:56.034
Wuhan cover-up book to him, with a letter in the front cover saying, you know, these people are lying to us, there is no pandemic, etc, etc, etc, and explained stuff in the margins of the book.

01:01:56.694 --> 01:01:57.735
I spent a lot of time.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:05.420
Because when he came to Pittsburgh, I really wanted, I took pictures with him and his wife, and gave him the book and was really excited.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.361
Nothing.

01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:12.485
Instead, he, yesterday, promoted this German lady who I'm sure is on Robert Malone's script.

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:26.698
Another country is going to step in and put a stop to this, to the censorship, to this denying fundamental rights and just taking the path downright into totalitarianism.

01:02:27.038 --> 01:02:36.383
And so her job is to announce the plan while not telling you that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality across the West that they sculpted using manslaughter and lies.

01:02:37.481 --> 01:02:38.783
I told that to Jimmy Dore.

01:02:38.823 --> 01:02:43.389
Jimmy Dore knows that they're lying about that in order to trick people into getting the shots.

01:02:43.989 --> 01:02:47.374
That's why he got vaccine injured and he's not doing anything about it.

01:02:48.558 --> 01:02:59.281
Frickin' Americans were murdered by opioids and by pandemic protocols in hospitals and in care homes so that Jimmy Dore would be scared enough to take the shot.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:05.342
And Jimmy Dore doesn't have the guts or the balls or the brains to speak out about it.

01:03:05.402 --> 01:03:09.683
Instead, he just promotes whoever he's told to promote and collects his money.

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:19.214
But if it's happening in every single Western democracy, who the heck do you think is going to come and bail us out?

01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:21.735
There isn't going to be anyone coming this time.

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:23.276
It's not going to happen.

01:03:24.117 --> 01:03:25.277
She's giving you the warning.

01:03:25.337 --> 01:03:27.579
She's telling you right now, it's not going to happen.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.684
It's not that dissimilar to Mike Eden, who's telling you that the digital ID is going to happen.

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:38.966
The only way you're going to get out of this is by not taking the digital ID.

01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:45.894
But the way that they're going to get you to take the digital ID is they're going to require it on social media.

01:03:45.934 --> 01:03:51.719
We've already been told this three years ago by some guy by the name of Jonathan Cooley in the back of his garage.

01:03:54.201 --> 01:04:01.366
We've got to get our kids off of social media because our kids are in danger on social media from the anonymous accounts.

01:04:02.246 --> 01:04:04.708
And so then they're going to require citizens to have ID.

01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:15.895
Or maybe they'll have special accounts with special privileges because they turned in their ID.

01:04:15.955 --> 01:04:16.815
They're verified.

01:04:18.016 --> 01:04:19.097
That's all they have to do.

01:04:22.038 --> 01:04:24.860
And now our children will take a digital ID.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.882
Even if dad's being a, you know, my dad's a pretty backwards guy.

01:04:28.902 --> 01:04:31.803
He doesn't have a digital ID, so he's not really on the internet.

01:04:31.843 --> 01:04:35.345
He only streams on this, this peer tube that he does himself.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.166
My dad's a dork.

01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:39.370
But I got a digital ID.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:40.611
I'm on Facebook and everywhere.

01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:41.813
That's how it's going to be.

01:04:43.535 --> 01:04:48.141
And they're just announcing it and getting paid to announce it because they've got no alternatives.

01:04:48.782 --> 01:04:55.170
He's on YouTube and rumble doing and reading, reading sponsorships for shit sake.

01:04:56.661 --> 01:04:59.402
Right now we have a special guest with us, Christine Anderson.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:04.525
She's a German politician who has served as a member of the European Parliament since 2019.

01:05:05.365 --> 01:05:08.907
She's representing the Alternative for Germany party, the AFD.

01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:23.394
She was formerly an activist with the Pegida movement, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, and became a member of the AFD in 2013, later serving as the party's group leader at the Limburg-Wilburg district assembly from 2016 to 2018,

01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:26.858
She's very outspoken.

01:05:26.898 --> 01:05:28.361
We're really happy to have her here.

01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:30.525
Please welcome to the show Christine Anderson.

01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:31.126
Hi Christine.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.132
Hi Thanks for having me

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.083
My pleasure.

01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:37.685
So we've been watching lots of you.

01:05:37.745 --> 01:05:40.706
You make a lot of ruckus, which is good for a politician.

01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:55.773
I think all of this you see is that the idea is to try to make it seem like there's an international consensus and an international group of people who has America in its sights and the controlled demolition of America in its sights.

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:57.574
They're going to use Donald Trump

01:05:58.558 --> 01:06:00.080
They're going to use the next election.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.282
They're going to use the crash of the dollar.

01:06:02.322 --> 01:06:03.784
They're going to use the price of gold.

01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:06.046
They're going to use the supply chains.

01:06:06.086 --> 01:06:07.728
They're going to use it all against us.

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:15.756
And these people are going to keep us focused on irrelevant things instead of focused on organizing locally.

01:06:16.886 --> 01:06:22.711
on teaching our children to get off of social media and to stop chasing the ghosts that are on social media.

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:32.340
He's promoting the ghosts on social media and he's doing it happily, even though they murdered people in his home country so that he would be gullible enough to take the shot.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.322
And that's why he's injured.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:38.165
It's almost like they put a gun to these people's head.

01:06:39.591 --> 01:06:42.174
Or they say, you know, if you don't do it, someone else is going to do it.

01:06:42.214 --> 01:06:44.297
And then your podcast will never take off.

01:06:44.577 --> 01:06:46.339
And you will get no sponsorships.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.802
And you won't be able to book another club.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.362
going against the establishment and the status quo.

01:06:58.243 --> 01:07:01.945
And let me just ask you about the AFD.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:11.672
I'm going to remind you of a song that I haven't played in a little while because somebody said thanks for reminding me of that song or there's a new song on my playlist or something like that.

01:07:12.453 --> 01:07:19.498
I really think this is a great tune and I really think this guy's a great musician and I'll tell you who it is afterward.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:23.141
Thanks for being here and thanks for being a part of this show.

01:07:52.930 --> 01:08:20.219
Any minute now My ship is coming in I'll keep checking the horizon And I'll stand on the bow And feel the waves come crashing

01:08:24.013 --> 01:08:41.737
Crashing down, down, down on me And you say, be still my love, open up your heart

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:59.104
Don't you understand I already have a plan I'm waiting for my real life to begin

01:09:18.661 --> 01:09:40.398
Suddenly nothing happened But in my dreams I slew the dragon down this beaten path Up this cobbled lane

01:09:48.567 --> 01:10:13.572
footsteps once again and you say just be here now forget about the past your mask is wearing thin just let me throw one more dice I know that I can win

01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:28.891
I'm waiting for my real life to begin Any minute now My ship is coming in

01:10:44.991 --> 01:11:10.742
I'll keep checking the horizons And I'll check my machine It's sure to be that call It's gonna happen soon Soon, oh so very soon

01:11:13.317 --> 01:11:31.570
It's just that times are lean And you say, be still my love Open up your heart and let the light shine in Don't you understand?

01:11:31.851 --> 01:11:40.037
Oh, I already have a plan I'm waiting for my real life to begin

01:12:28.743 --> 01:12:43.827
On a clear day I can see See for a long way On a clear day I can see See for a long way

01:13:08.789 --> 01:13:11.310
It's a very clear day in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:13.410
I can see a very, very long way today.

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:17.831
That's Colin Hay, originally from Men at Work in a solo album.

01:13:18.612 --> 01:13:21.392
The song is called Waiting for My Real Life to Begin.

01:13:21.572 --> 01:13:23.473
What an artist that guy is.

01:13:23.513 --> 01:13:25.854
That voice is just, wow, amazing.

01:13:26.854 --> 01:13:28.975
Brett Weinstein and his wife are scripted bullshit.

01:13:28.995 --> 01:13:30.355
I don't know if they're witting or unwitting.

01:13:30.395 --> 01:13:32.896
Well, they're witting now, but they might've not been in the beginning.

01:13:33.556 --> 01:13:35.256
But they're definitely scripted bullshitters.

01:13:35.296 --> 01:13:37.817
I just don't think they're sophisticated enough to understand

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:57.328
And since it's Independence Day in America and I don't want to wade in this mud for another hour, I've decided to insert an alternative direction for the show for the remaining of the day in hopes of lifting your spirits and reminding you about what America used to stand for.

01:13:58.149 --> 01:14:02.050
Reminding you of, trying to remind you of how I think of America.

01:14:02.762 --> 01:14:15.997
what I think of America and why I think racism in America is kind of silly, it doesn't make any sense, and they're just folding us in on ourselves with this hamster wheel of bullshit, and they're using social media to do it to us.

01:14:16.818 --> 01:14:21.984
America was something much better than the last few years.

01:14:22.785 --> 01:14:23.326
Check this out.

01:14:30.051 --> 01:14:32.912
Why do people talk about dream so much in sports?

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:36.353
Dream seasons.

01:14:38.914 --> 01:14:39.734
Dream matchups.

01:14:41.554 --> 01:14:42.775
Dream opportunities.

01:14:44.975 --> 01:14:50.377
They do it because so much of sports is about imagining what you want things to be like.

01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:54.078
If only the setting were just right.

01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:58.039
It was one of those times none of us will ever forget.

01:14:58.447 --> 01:15:00.128
The characters, just right.

01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:04.311
I don't know anything about Angola, but Angola's in trouble.

01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.032
The timing, just right.

01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:07.893
11 Hall of Famers.

01:15:09.034 --> 01:15:11.796
I don't think you can ever do that again, at no point in time.

01:15:12.977 --> 01:15:16.359
If only it could all be the way you might have dreamed it up yourself.

01:15:17.399 --> 01:15:22.263
Training camp began on June 22, 1992, in La Jolla, California.

01:15:23.123 --> 01:15:26.926
And when the gym doors opened, no one was quite sure what to expect.

01:15:27.631 --> 01:15:29.412
especially the players themselves.

01:15:30.552 --> 01:15:33.053
It's a lot of egos in one gym and on one team.

01:15:33.993 --> 01:15:38.554
Everybody wanted their form to shine and showcase why they were a part of this team.

01:15:38.975 --> 01:15:43.556
With all these stars on the team, if it comes down to the last shot, who's going to take the shot?

01:15:43.896 --> 01:15:44.116
Me.

01:15:44.396 --> 01:15:44.596
Me.

01:15:45.937 --> 01:15:47.197
Everybody in the world has an ego.

01:15:47.237 --> 01:15:49.598
The only difference between us, we have a reason to have an ego.

01:15:51.759 --> 01:15:53.199
Every one of us felt like we was a

01:15:55.595 --> 01:15:57.216
That dude is massive.

01:15:57.296 --> 01:16:02.117
If you've never seen that guy, he's massive.

01:16:02.578 --> 01:16:03.278
You can see it.

01:16:03.338 --> 01:16:07.119
If you see it, it looks like his head is small, but actually his head's not small.

01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:08.960
His body is just massive.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.961
That Karl Malone is no joke.

01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:17.905
I played at DePaul on their practice team when Steve Howard played.

01:16:18.025 --> 01:16:22.968
And Steve Howard actually went and sat the bench at the Utah Jazz for a year and a half.

01:16:23.589 --> 01:16:27.391
And the size of Steve Howard was mind-blowing.

01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:29.613
Like, he was a big dude.

01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:34.135
And he looked like a child next to Carl Malone.

01:16:34.216 --> 01:16:36.637
Carl Malone is one massive man.

01:16:36.657 --> 01:16:39.279
Trying to prove just how great they were.

01:16:41.687 --> 01:16:43.208
It was a very competitive practice.

01:16:43.548 --> 01:16:45.990
And I'm thinking, aren't we all on the same team?

01:16:48.712 --> 01:16:49.993
Patrick go, I don't want to play with David.

01:16:50.013 --> 01:16:50.854
I want to play against him.

01:16:50.994 --> 01:16:53.256
Then you hear Michael say, I don't want to be on Magic's team.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:54.157
I want to play against him.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:17:02.023
Every evaluation of Michael Jordan at that time was, he's good, but he's never Magic Johnson.

01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:07.973
In my competitive nature, I want to use every little bit that I can gather so that I can gain an advantage.

01:17:08.694 --> 01:17:12.697
Karl Malone, he's the only guy I would even compare to myself at the power forward position.

01:17:13.658 --> 01:17:16.280
So I want to prove that I was the best power forward in the world.

01:17:17.381 --> 01:17:17.781
Charles.

01:17:18.562 --> 01:17:19.543
Yeah, he's a great talent.

01:17:19.563 --> 01:17:20.444
Do I think he's better than me?

01:17:20.484 --> 01:17:21.024
Hell no.

01:17:21.044 --> 01:17:22.806
So let's do this.

01:17:26.649 --> 01:17:31.213
By the time this over with, you're going to be thinking I'm damn good too.

01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:37.912
First practice, Barkley drives baseline, and Karl Malone jumps up like this.

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.833
Barkley just dunked on him so hard.

01:17:40.853 --> 01:17:43.314
It was just an unbelievable play.

01:17:44.174 --> 01:17:48.235
I felt like, man, I cannot believe that I'm part of this practice.

01:17:50.496 --> 01:17:50.896
I bet.

01:17:51.576 --> 01:17:53.097
I want that sweatshirt right there.

01:17:53.117 --> 01:17:53.497
I can't find it.

01:17:53.517 --> 01:17:56.318
The team had a chance to acclimate themselves to playing on the same side.

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:58.938
I've been trying to get one of those big champion sweatshirts.

01:17:59.018 --> 01:17:59.659
I can't find one.

01:18:01.075 --> 01:18:03.496
a group thrilled to be facing off against their idols.

01:18:04.116 --> 01:18:09.619
I was able to find one of the practice jerseys that they didn't use for the other team, right?

01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:13.721
So they got the same reversible jerseys as them.

01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:17.823
And after the dream team, they were yellow for the away team.

01:18:17.863 --> 01:18:18.884
So this is a white one.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:20.985
This I got really lucky on eBay.

01:18:21.105 --> 01:18:21.805
eBay's awesome.

01:18:24.011 --> 01:18:26.892
I found out today I might be picking up magic a little bit full court.

01:18:26.912 --> 01:18:30.034
So, you know, things are just happening for me.

01:18:30.094 --> 01:18:35.256
If you don't know the story of this game, please listen carefully, because it's awesome.

01:18:36.396 --> 01:18:37.937
It really, really makes me happy.

01:18:38.557 --> 01:18:42.379
A lot of those people that I've looked up to, Barclay, Malone, a lot of those people talk confidence.

01:18:42.459 --> 01:18:44.620
And I think it's going to be a good matchup.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.541
There's no advantage on either side.

01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:51.883
For the college players, it was a chance to see how they'd match up against the world's best.

01:18:52.674 --> 01:18:57.259
For Coach Daly, it was an opportunity to get his stars to grow into a single unit.

01:18:58.139 --> 01:19:04.005
I think we're somewhere between the mentality of an all-star game and trying to come together as a team.

01:19:04.025 --> 01:19:07.609
An all-star game, so they're not taking it very seriously, you see?

01:19:09.371 --> 01:19:11.313
So we've got to continually work on this.

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:15.631
Daly had been hired for his ability to manage personalities and egos.

01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:23.494
And when the scrimmage began, it became apparent that his players had left one of their biggest weapons, those egos, somewhere else.

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:33.778
The non-fan would think, well, they're going to go in there, and they're each going to want their own ball, and Jordan's going to be hogging the ball, and Magic's going to be dribbling all over the place.

01:19:34.258 --> 01:19:35.898
Point of fact, it was the exact opposite.

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.099
They overpassed.

01:19:37.899 --> 01:19:39.720
It was like, I don't want to start it off.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:40.440
You do it.

01:19:42.304 --> 01:19:44.766
And before you realize it, the select team was beating us by 10.

01:19:47.388 --> 01:19:48.829
We didn't know how to play with each other.

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:53.373
We didn't want to step on anybody's toes or hurt any egos.

01:19:54.214 --> 01:19:57.516
So these young kids, they were killing us.

01:19:58.537 --> 01:20:02.060
We were not into it, and we paid for it.

01:20:06.403 --> 01:20:07.825
Chris Webber was a man.

01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:10.727
I thought, boy, that guy's coming to this league.

01:20:10.767 --> 01:20:11.528
I could get out of here.

01:20:13.027 --> 01:20:16.809
That is a compliment and Chris Webber was a man.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:19.611
If that guy's coming into this league, I gotta get out of here.

01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:23.973
Think about Larry Bird saying that about you as a basketball player.

01:20:24.013 --> 01:20:24.834
That's badass.

01:20:25.494 --> 01:20:27.315
Bobby Hurley was dominant.

01:20:28.976 --> 01:20:37.481
I did have some success penetrating and collapsing the defense and our energy, our excitement to play, all those things played in our favor.

01:20:39.363 --> 01:20:42.805
Bobby Hurley didn't play two seasons in the NBA.

01:20:43.265 --> 01:20:50.830
Nevertheless, it did expose the one weakness they could have had, which is defending against quick guards.

01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:52.771
They were playing great.

01:20:55.033 --> 01:20:57.815
Then I noticed that Michael Jordan is not playing.

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:01.517
I'm saying something.

01:21:01.577 --> 01:21:02.638
Chuck, then he said.

01:21:03.098 --> 01:21:06.160
That's probably the best basketball coach that's ever lived.

01:21:08.942 --> 01:21:19.026
Mike Krzyzewski is single-handedly responsible for taking the reigns of the USA basketball team after this, this Dream Team and kicking people's ass.

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:21.887
He's a really wonderful coach.

01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:26.929
And what's really crazy is that he learned to coach from Bob Knight.

01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:30.411
Like, talk about America.

01:21:30.431 --> 01:21:33.892
This guy's America right here.

01:21:33.952 --> 01:21:34.993
That guy's America.

01:21:35.053 --> 01:21:36.113
Bob Knight's America.

01:21:36.173 --> 01:21:38.074
Basketball and the Dream Team is America.

01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:39.803
We're all right.

01:21:40.843 --> 01:21:41.604
Yeah, we're all right.

01:21:42.544 --> 01:21:45.405
Daly watched as his players failed to make up the deficit.

01:21:46.065 --> 01:21:49.806
And in their first taste of outside competition, the Dream Team lost.

01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:57.308
It's tribalism, but it's tribalism that's based on what soil do you live on and what legal system do you share?

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.629
And under whose shade do you shelter?

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:09.578
If we shelter under the same trees, then I think we might be better off on the same team.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:19.586
So it's tribalism, but it's a special kind of tribalism now that the world is global and we can have friends all over the world that have no bearing on our lives.

01:22:19.626 --> 01:22:22.428
We can even have friends that we don't even know for sure are real.

01:22:24.089 --> 01:22:25.670
Then you're damn right it's tribalism.

01:22:26.051 --> 01:22:27.792
It's soylism.

01:22:28.793 --> 01:22:31.475
A story their coach didn't want the press to get their hands on.

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:39.297
The teams pose for a picture together, both not sure what to make of what had just happened.

01:22:40.697 --> 01:22:43.037
But the man in charge may have had the answer.

01:22:46.278 --> 01:22:47.118
He threw the game.

01:22:48.799 --> 01:22:50.139
You know, Chuck threw the game.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:23:02.562
If you look how much Jordan played and how he subbed guys in, not picking up, not making any adjustments, he knew what he was doing.

01:23:04.195 --> 01:23:05.216
It was legit.

01:23:05.916 --> 01:23:06.917
It felt tremendous.

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:10.479
You know, what we were doing that day, you know, they couldn't stop it.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:18.225
There are kids who believe in Santa Claus, too, and the Easter bunny.

01:23:18.305 --> 01:23:24.989
And now that they've grown up, I hate to burst their bubble, but it was a game thrown.

01:23:28.692 --> 01:23:30.733
Not many people would have done it.

01:23:31.914 --> 01:23:33.435
And he did it.

01:23:35.988 --> 01:23:41.371
It was gratifying to Chuck for us to get our butts beat like that, because now we had to listen to him.

01:23:42.171 --> 01:23:45.713
The next day, training camp ended with a rematch against the college kids.

01:23:46.293 --> 01:23:49.235
And once play started, everything made sense again.

01:23:49.995 --> 01:23:51.516
The tables were turned drastically.

01:23:53.897 --> 01:23:57.799
We showed them why we are who we are.

01:23:58.939 --> 01:24:00.020
We pretty much beat them by 100.

01:24:01.857 --> 01:24:02.577
They couldn't score.

01:24:04.538 --> 01:24:09.699
And by the way, Jordan played a lot more that next scrimmage.

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.421
Before the Dream Team could play in the 1992 Olympics, they had to qualify.

01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:21.923
The place to do that was Portland, Oregon, in the Tournament of the Americas.

01:24:23.403 --> 01:24:27.024
It would be the public's first chance to see the NBA stars together in a game.

01:24:28.171 --> 01:24:29.832
especially Jordan Bird and Magic.

01:24:29.952 --> 01:24:35.095
I agree that God can take away people's talent in a heartbeat, but I would just.

01:24:35.575 --> 01:24:41.479
The reason why I think this is so special is because this dream team inspired.

01:24:42.579 --> 01:24:43.880
Kids around the world.

01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:50.224
In a way that made basketball go international in a way that before the dream team it was not.

01:24:50.304 --> 01:24:52.045
That is absolutely for sure.

01:24:53.386 --> 01:24:57.268
Daily had asked all three to be team captains, but Jordan had turned him down.

01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:02.632
I knew how much it meant to both of those guys because they never had the opportunity to play on the Olympics.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:07.113
So I'd say you know, Chuck don't worry about me, you know, let these old dogs do it.

01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:21.498
Magic and bird don't forget Jordan was already on an Olympic team with worthy and I don't remember all the guys that were on there, but it was an awesome team weren't just the team's oldest players.

01:25:22.499 --> 01:25:23.759
They were also the most revered.

01:25:25.401 --> 01:25:31.084
They had entered the league together in 1979, embarking on a rivalry that had redefined the NBA.

01:25:31.184 --> 01:25:42.350
In a lot of ways, America was governed in part by the NBA with these two guys as rivals, as these two guys as converse shoe wearers.

01:25:44.031 --> 01:25:51.755
The whole dichotomy in America between black and white was personified by these two guys for like 15 years.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:26:06.029
And their rivalry and getting along and playing along to get along was all part of the cohesive nature of the American dream, the idea that we all are just on the same soil.

01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:08.791
And now we're all going to play under the same flag.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:13.915
This was really a very unique period in America's evolution, if you will.

01:26:15.447 --> 01:26:25.551
One of the best times in America, I would argue, was right after I graduated from high school, right when the Chicago Bulls started winning championships, right when I moved to Chicago and was on my own.

01:26:26.771 --> 01:26:30.892
And along the way, their personal admiration for one another had grown.

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.853
Matty's just a great basketball player.

01:26:34.033 --> 01:26:35.834
He's the best I've ever seen, you know.

01:26:39.715 --> 01:26:40.196
Unbelievable.

01:26:40.216 --> 01:26:41.216
I don't know what to say.

01:26:44.113 --> 01:26:50.537
In 1992, they'd be getting the chance to share the ball, but the opportunity would be coming at the end of their careers.

01:26:52.078 --> 01:26:57.220
Bird had given his soul to the game, but after so many years, his body was betraying him.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.181
I had back problems.

01:26:59.562 --> 01:27:01.403
It just gets to the point where you just couldn't play.

01:27:01.643 --> 01:27:05.785
I mean, you couldn't think, couldn't move, couldn't run.

01:27:06.746 --> 01:27:08.607
You know, if you can't feel your feet, it's hard to run.

01:27:09.864 --> 01:27:12.265
Larry was on the fence because of his back.

01:27:12.305 --> 01:27:14.526
So I said, man, LB, you got to play, man.

01:27:14.546 --> 01:27:15.407
You got to play.

01:27:15.427 --> 01:27:18.508
This is our last chance to be together.

01:27:19.429 --> 01:27:21.830
Magic would be able to convince his old friend to play.

01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:22.610
And then?

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:30.114
But at the start of the 1991-92 NBA season, he was forced to retire after learning he had the HIV virus.

01:27:31.397 --> 01:27:36.261
Doctors would eventually clear him to play in the Olympics, though that didn't stop fears from swirling.

01:27:36.722 --> 01:27:43.527
So everybody learned about HIV from the dream team.

01:27:43.667 --> 01:27:44.989
Holy shit.

01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:55.818
There's a lot of players that really didn't want him to play, didn't want to play with him or against him because nobody knew what diseased man, you know, they say, get a little blood on you.

01:27:55.898 --> 01:27:58.280
You got HIV or breeze on you, you know?

01:27:59.501 --> 01:27:59.561
Um,

01:28:00.157 --> 01:28:01.998
I never bought any of that, you know?

01:28:02.438 --> 01:28:03.838
I just said, we just keep going.

01:28:07.939 --> 01:28:13.221
See why I think NBA players might be the people we need to get to learn the truth about the pandemic?

01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:17.742
And that's what Irvin decided to do, just keep pushing, keep going.

01:28:17.762 --> 01:28:23.723
Six, five, three-pointer.

01:28:23.743 --> 01:28:23.803
Yes!

01:28:23.823 --> 01:28:25.824
Oh, my!

01:28:25.864 --> 01:28:27.825
Magic had made a cameo in the 1992 All-Star Game.

01:28:29.915 --> 01:28:36.017
and had focused his attention on the Olympics, hoping for an encore of a lifetime alongside his old rival.

01:28:37.397 --> 01:28:43.479
Our careers were really over and it was something I thought needed to happen for both of us.

01:28:45.299 --> 01:28:52.962
Their debut would take place at Portland's Rose Garden, with their team needing to medal in the Tournament of the Americas to qualify for the Olympics.

01:28:54.142 --> 01:28:57.083
That seemed like a foregone conclusion to just about everyone.

01:28:58.089 --> 01:29:02.732
including their first opponents, who were completely in awe before the game even started.

01:29:05.274 --> 01:29:13.479
The Cuban team spontaneously, like, drops to its knees as if 12 popes had come by on Easter Sunday.

01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:20.844
At that point, the idea that this is merely a basketball game has been ripped asunder.

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.547
It was a surreal feeling.

01:29:25.851 --> 01:29:28.253
He's like, dude, we're here to kick y'all behind.

01:29:28.273 --> 01:29:31.295
And they want to take pictures with you.

01:29:33.196 --> 01:29:34.457
I love Charles Barkley.

01:29:34.497 --> 01:29:38.139
Magic and Larry come out together, two guys that had saved the league.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.021
They wouldn't even be playing this game without those two.

01:29:41.822 --> 01:29:44.123
And Magic passed the ball, Larry makes the first basket.

01:29:44.243 --> 01:29:50.267
I mean, you know, it just didn't get any better than that.

01:29:54.326 --> 01:29:54.786
The U.S.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:57.408
was off and running, and the result was a thing of beauty.

01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:11.295
And no one seemed more excited to be sharing the court than the co-captains.

01:30:13.196 --> 01:30:17.018
Opening night was a smashing success, with the outcome never in doubt.

01:30:20.984 --> 01:30:27.986
And late in the game, fans in Portland decided they wanted a curtain call from a three-time MVP.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:32.727
The crowd started cheering, Larry, Larry, Larry.

01:30:33.067 --> 01:30:45.351
The crowd reacts to the entrance of Larry Bird, a standing ovation.

01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:48.752
And as he'd done so many other times in his career,

01:30:49.574 --> 01:30:51.515
Larry Bird rose to the occasion.

01:30:59.659 --> 01:31:03.300
It was a virtually flawless performance.

01:31:03.881 --> 01:31:06.262
The final margin of victory was 77 points.

01:31:06.322 --> 01:31:09.403
And Magic and Bird had led the way.

01:31:10.324 --> 01:31:15.286
For Magic in particular, after a year out of the game, the victory had a special kind of meaning.

01:31:16.516 --> 01:31:26.646
Living with HIV, never even thinking that I would ever have a chance to play basketball game and then basketball for the United States.

01:31:27.347 --> 01:31:28.528
It was therapy for me.

01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:32.212
And I needed that in the worst way.

01:31:33.273 --> 01:31:37.257
And then there was the matter of making sure Michael Jordan knew he was back as well.

01:31:37.904 --> 01:31:39.104
Yeah, you hear what the captain say?

01:31:39.124 --> 01:31:40.144
The captain say, sit down.

01:31:40.164 --> 01:31:42.385
But this boat is going to sink.

01:31:42.485 --> 01:31:42.965
That's right.

01:31:42.985 --> 01:31:44.645
Have a seat, because you're going to fall.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:45.205
That's the captain.

01:31:45.245 --> 01:31:46.586
That's going to happen.

01:31:46.606 --> 01:31:48.106
That's the seniority right there.

01:31:48.126 --> 01:31:48.766
I know it.

01:31:49.066 --> 01:31:54.627
With Magic and Michael, there was that little extra something there.

01:31:54.947 --> 01:31:55.487
You know?

01:31:56.067 --> 01:31:56.887
Ah, shit.

01:31:57.027 --> 01:31:58.248
Something kind of to prove.

01:31:58.488 --> 01:31:59.228
That sucks.

01:31:59.268 --> 01:32:00.228
I forgot about that.

01:32:00.268 --> 01:32:01.048
I'm going to stop it.

01:32:01.088 --> 01:32:01.848
Oh, too shit.

01:32:02.408 --> 01:32:05.889
I'm going to end it.

01:32:07.165 --> 01:32:14.348
Because they gave me a strike last time for this copyright shit.

01:32:14.448 --> 01:32:16.468
And they're just giving me strikes whenever.

01:32:16.628 --> 01:32:22.431
They actually told me that that subway video with the dude that's pretending to stop the subway is now copyrighted.

01:32:22.911 --> 01:32:25.212
And they're giving me strikes for every video that has it.

01:32:28.007 --> 01:32:31.350
I took it upon myself to always shoot with Michael.

01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:34.072
Okay, MJ, three throws today.

01:32:34.353 --> 01:32:35.253
Who's the first one to 50?

01:32:36.414 --> 01:32:39.157
Or we had little games, who was the better shooter?

01:32:45.325 --> 01:32:47.367
Thanks for letting me know about the GigaStream.

01:32:47.407 --> 01:32:48.627
The GigaStream is tough.

01:32:48.687 --> 01:32:53.870
I don't know if we have a server that's good enough to do it well, but it's still running, it says.

01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:55.511
It's recording it for later.

01:32:56.231 --> 01:32:58.733
80s, in a sense, even though we were going into the 90s.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.454
Don't touch the phone.

01:33:01.554 --> 01:33:02.815
One hand, don't touch it.

01:33:15.134 --> 01:33:17.375
You know, he'd just come off missing a whole year.

01:33:18.576 --> 01:33:20.036
So it was who can win?

01:33:20.316 --> 01:33:22.797
Who's going to have the bragging rights by the end of this trip?

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:24.598
You can't get too close to Michael.

01:33:24.658 --> 01:33:25.219
It's a foul.

01:33:25.879 --> 01:33:30.381
You haven't committed a foul in almost a year and a half, man.

01:33:30.421 --> 01:33:32.082
How can you talk?

01:33:32.382 --> 01:33:37.364
Michael's always tried to let people know that he's the top dog in whatever.

01:33:37.524 --> 01:33:39.185
That's just his competitive mode.

01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:51.257
While the winner of Magic and Michael's Can You Top This Challenge remained in doubt, when it came to facing the competition in the Tournament of the Americas, the team stood united.

01:33:52.518 --> 01:33:59.984
When we took to court in Portland, which, you know, we're on home ground, we wanted to showcase to the fans who we would be representing there.

01:34:00.564 --> 01:34:01.365
The lead is 30.

01:34:01.425 --> 01:34:01.865
Stale.

01:34:02.225 --> 01:34:02.626
Jordan.

01:34:03.066 --> 01:34:04.207
Jordan.

01:34:04.287 --> 01:34:08.230
I'm going to send a message around the world today.

01:34:08.752 --> 01:34:09.553
Y'all can give it up.

01:34:09.993 --> 01:34:11.294
You foreigners can give it up.

01:34:21.403 --> 01:34:25.567
The Americans won their six games at the tournament by an average of 50 points.

01:34:26.167 --> 01:34:31.452
All right, Larry, your impressions of tonight's game?

01:34:31.472 --> 01:34:34.794
The gold medal was no surprise.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:44.802
But what was unexpected was the team's interactions with their opponents, who showered them with adulation before, after, and even during games.

01:34:46.342 --> 01:34:50.903
Patrick Johnson and Aranda shaking hands after the shot.

01:34:53.144 --> 01:34:55.384
The Tournament of the Americas had served its purpose.

01:34:56.564 --> 01:35:03.286
The US had qualified for the Barcelona games and given the world its first glimpse of what was coming later that summer.

01:35:04.551 --> 01:35:11.516
I just want to say this is just a small step to what our goal really is, to get to Barcelona, win the gold medal and bring it back where it's supposed to be.

01:35:11.536 --> 01:35:14.338
Thank you.

01:35:15.379 --> 01:35:21.063
They would hold several days of practice in Monte Carlo and play one more tune-up before heading to the Olympics.

01:35:21.824 --> 01:35:28.349
The luxurious setting on the Mediterranean Sea was fitting for what already may have been the world's most famous team.

01:35:29.642 --> 01:35:40.446
John Stockton is actually kind of an anti-vax dude because Brian Hookers actually did a podcast with him before which is very interesting.

01:35:42.807 --> 01:35:48.629
Monte Carlo is one of those glamorous cities and here we were with the most glamorous team ever.

01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:53.571
That dude's a monster too, like he's massive, just huge people.

01:35:53.591 --> 01:35:55.752
It was kind of a rock star-ish kind of a thing.

01:35:58.695 --> 01:36:04.439
The players were relaxed and confident, and willing to admit there was more to the trip than just basketball.

01:36:04.819 --> 01:36:06.540
I don't worry about playing basketball.

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.481
That comes naturally.

01:36:07.501 --> 01:36:08.582
I just want to have fun.

01:36:09.202 --> 01:36:11.544
David Robinson, Pat Muir, Michael Jordan.

01:36:11.984 --> 01:36:13.745
This is like spring break in the ghetto.

01:36:16.347 --> 01:36:18.869
Chuck says, OK, this is what's going to happen.

01:36:19.289 --> 01:36:20.710
We're going to play it like a real game.

01:36:20.730 --> 01:36:21.951
We're going to play four quarters.

01:36:22.847 --> 01:36:26.670
We had me, Scotty, Mullins, Bird, and Patrick.

01:36:27.511 --> 01:36:29.012
And Magic had his five.

01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:32.034
We weren't going to change that team at no point in time.

01:36:32.234 --> 01:36:32.975
You got your five.

01:36:32.995 --> 01:36:33.695
I got my five.

01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:35.937
We gave them the college guy.

01:36:35.977 --> 01:36:37.478
You can have Kristin Laitner.

01:36:37.979 --> 01:36:38.900
We don't want him.

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:39.720
You can have him.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.723
He's just over there waiting to tag in.

01:36:44.464 --> 01:36:46.125
But it was about pride.

01:36:46.405 --> 01:36:48.407
And a college kid couldn't help either one of the teams.

01:36:49.361 --> 01:36:52.223
Michael Jordan called Clyde out and went at him.

01:36:52.283 --> 01:36:53.845
Tell him, this is what I'm going to do to you.

01:36:54.445 --> 01:36:55.486
Fall away, jumper.

01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:56.287
Good.

01:36:56.567 --> 01:36:57.648
What did I tell you?

01:36:57.988 --> 01:37:00.110
So I said, no, Clyde, you better get him back.

01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:01.371
You better get him back.

01:37:03.328 --> 01:37:06.029
Charles Barkley said, I want to take Carl Malone now.

01:37:06.329 --> 01:37:09.929
So Charles gets it, far away jumper, good.

01:37:10.429 --> 01:37:12.630
I said, oh, Carl, you got to get him back.

01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:14.610
You better go down there and get him back.

01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:17.211
Carl went right at it, jump shot.

01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:18.451
You ain't nothing.

01:37:18.611 --> 01:37:19.731
You ain't nothing, Barkley.

01:37:20.231 --> 01:37:21.471
So then I came down.

01:37:23.092 --> 01:37:26.412
His energy is real high.

01:37:26.452 --> 01:37:28.693
He feels like he's in an opportunity to prove himself.

01:37:31.069 --> 01:37:33.891
and showcase that, hey, look, I'm still Magic Johnson.

01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:35.492
I still dominate this game.

01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:37.733
That's all right.

01:37:37.993 --> 01:37:38.773
That's all right.

01:37:39.214 --> 01:37:40.675
That's all right.

01:37:40.715 --> 01:37:45.757
Magic was saying, you ain't the guy, and we got other players in this gym.

01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:52.181
It doesn't take much to get Michael going.

01:37:52.761 --> 01:37:55.203
Just a little something to tweak him, and it's on.

01:37:59.122 --> 01:38:00.242
He never liked to lose.

01:38:00.723 --> 01:38:02.323
Michael always got that look.

01:38:03.404 --> 01:38:09.085
When you see that look, then you know just give him the damn ball and get out the way.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:19.589
As much as it was five on five, you could see in Monte Carlo that it was gravitating towards, OK, Michael and Magic.

01:38:20.309 --> 01:38:24.931
Magic was hesitant to surrender his place on the mountaintop.

01:38:26.592 --> 01:38:27.752
And Michael being Michael,

01:38:28.462 --> 01:38:31.286
He needed to say, no, I'm on the top of the mountain now.

01:38:32.687 --> 01:38:35.030
Nigel was saying, look, NBA's not yours yet.

01:38:36.332 --> 01:38:37.113
You know, I'm still here.

01:38:38.094 --> 01:38:39.015
Michael's like, no, it's over.

01:38:39.576 --> 01:38:40.017
This is mine.

01:38:41.345 --> 01:38:45.850
And the funny thing was Larry was sitting on his side going, it's his.

01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:51.677
Chuck realized the competition aspect was getting a little bit too high.

01:38:54.019 --> 01:38:59.565
He wanted to end practice, but Magic didn't want to end because he wanted to keep playing because we just kicked his ass.

01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:13.213
By the time practice was over, even Magic had to acknowledge basketball's landscape had been changed forever.

01:39:14.873 --> 01:39:20.576
Larry and I were talking and Michael walks in and he says, there's a new sheriff in town.

01:39:25.356 --> 01:39:30.139
Just moments ago, the Dream Team boarded the bus outside their hotel along the Ramblas.

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.022
They are heading for their first match-up in Barcelona with the Angolans.

01:39:34.863 --> 01:39:39.986
I can remember the first game, the real game, when we came out of the locker room and stepped on the court.

01:39:41.107 --> 01:39:44.690
And I finally said to myself, I can't believe this, I'm here.

01:39:46.251 --> 01:39:50.174
At that point, we were in serious Olympic mode.

01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:55.401
This actually may be the biggest mismatch of the entire Olympics.

01:40:05.912 --> 01:40:08.113
The U.S.

01:40:08.574 --> 01:40:11.116
with a 46 to 1 run.

01:40:11.136 --> 01:40:11.396
46 to 1.

01:40:11.516 --> 01:40:11.816
Wow.

01:40:12.136 --> 01:40:21.223
It was just a tremendous atmosphere because there was an appreciation for how great the U.S.

01:40:21.283 --> 01:40:22.184
players were.

01:40:23.565 --> 01:40:27.528
After the first half, Barkley's pregame prediction appeared dead on.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:30.951
But in the second, Charles found some trouble.

01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:41.801
I hear the players in Angola, who play against South Barkley, they told us there's no way a kid, a fat boy, is many aggressive in the paint.

01:40:51.928 --> 01:40:54.570
I thought they were playing dirty.

01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:58.392
And I told old boy, I don't even know if he understood my thing, man.

01:40:58.592 --> 01:40:59.433
He's up on the elbow.

01:41:01.136 --> 01:41:02.676
Bartley from Pippen.

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:04.717
I let it go twice.

01:41:05.637 --> 01:41:07.957
You can see the frustration with Bartley.

01:41:08.017 --> 01:41:10.858
And the next time, I just cracked it.

01:41:12.338 --> 01:41:13.479
Bartley from Pippen.

01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:19.920
And a technical foul has been called on Bartley.

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:25.281
To his dying day, Charles claims the guy elbowed him three times.

01:41:25.781 --> 01:41:27.762
People always say, turn the other cheek.

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:29.782
If you turn the other cheek, I'm gonna hit you in the other cheek, too.

01:41:30.953 --> 01:41:32.213
I thought, what are you doing, Charles?

01:41:32.533 --> 01:41:33.954
The guy is half your size.

01:41:34.574 --> 01:41:37.095
But, you know, Charles was an equal opportunity abuser.

01:41:37.555 --> 01:41:41.396
Erlander Kodimbra did not think it was a friendly elbow.

01:41:41.936 --> 01:41:44.016
That's the same guy that just asked for an autograph, Charles.

01:41:44.176 --> 01:41:45.937
I mean, you think he's not intimidated?

01:41:45.957 --> 01:41:50.918
The United States has defeated Angola by the score of 100.

01:41:51.078 --> 01:41:56.259
Once you're on the floor and you're actually competing, that's what happens with some people.

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:57.740
Like, it's real.

01:42:00.433 --> 01:42:13.302
And we, to a certain extent, have to get serious about our country and make sure that we're not playing like an all-star game, that we're taking our responsibilities as adults seriously.

01:42:14.002 --> 01:42:19.906
Because social media is weaponized against us and they are using it as best they can against us.

01:42:24.829 --> 01:42:30.033
The game may have ended in a rout, but afterwards, the result was overshadowed by the controversy.

01:42:30.683 --> 01:42:31.564
What was with the elbow?

01:42:32.204 --> 01:42:33.465
Well, he hit me, I hit him.

01:42:33.485 --> 01:42:35.646
That's the way it is.

01:42:36.426 --> 01:42:41.009
Charles made you look like the ugly Americans, which we were trying not to do.

01:42:44.031 --> 01:42:47.753
We said to Charles, look, man, you're a reflection of all of us.

01:42:48.433 --> 01:42:51.915
So if you do it, they're not going to write the article that Charles Barkley did.

01:42:51.935 --> 01:42:53.336
They're going to say the dream team.

01:43:00.953 --> 01:43:03.494
Barkley had stained a dream debut for the Americans.

01:43:04.495 --> 01:43:14.680
But in their next game against Croatia, Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan grabbed the spotlight, with the focus on their matchup with one of Europe's best players, Tony Kukoc.

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:21.684
The major storyline that carries into this game involves Tony Kukoc, second round pick of the Chicago Bulls back in 1989.

01:43:21.824 --> 01:43:25.366
The Bulls made a strong push to sign him last season.

01:43:26.072 --> 01:43:31.916
At that time, general managers in the league were trying to come up with gems, make their discoveries overseas.

01:43:32.357 --> 01:43:35.399
And Kraus thought this guy could play in the NBA.

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:44.986
While Jordan and Pippen had been winning back-to-back titles, Chicago GM Jerry Kraus had been publicly wooing Kukoc to join the Bulls.

01:43:45.998 --> 01:43:48.699
Kraus was recruiting this guy and talking how great he was.

01:43:48.719 --> 01:43:54.260
You know, that's like a father who has all his kids and now he sees another kid that he loves more than he loves his own.

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.361
So we were not playing against Tony Kukoc.

01:43:57.901 --> 01:44:01.181
We were playing against Jerry Kraus in a Croatian uniform.

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:07.763
But unfortunately for the real Tony Kukoc, he was now the target of the world's two best defensive players.

01:44:08.823 --> 01:44:10.644
We knew the world was going to be watching.

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:14.366
We knew everyone wanted to see what Tony Kukoc was like.

01:44:14.886 --> 01:44:19.529
And we were going to give him the worst experience he ever had on a basketball court.

01:44:20.569 --> 01:44:26.292
Pippen drew the initial assignment of shadowing Kukoc and harassed the Croatian from the opening whistle.

01:44:26.753 --> 01:44:30.915
It was hard to run across the half court without a ball.

01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:36.093
And with the ball, it was just, here, somebody else get it.

01:44:36.213 --> 01:44:39.315
Tony definitely wasn't getting a shot up, and he wasn't gonna score.

01:44:39.696 --> 01:44:42.658
Kukoc is nothing for four, and he's contributed nothing.

01:44:43.318 --> 01:44:45.220
We wanted to go guard him on the bench.

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:51.564
Kukoc is called for the offensive foul, and the pressure continues.

01:44:52.805 --> 01:44:56.187
And after Pippen wore Kukoc down, it was Jordan's turn.

01:44:57.448 --> 01:44:58.249
Kukoc...

01:44:59.269 --> 01:45:00.390
Stolen by Jordan.

01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:02.652
He reads it better than anyone.

01:45:02.672 --> 01:45:03.033
Slam dunk.

01:45:03.674 --> 01:45:06.356
Them dudes were all over him.

01:45:07.157 --> 01:45:08.578
Here's a three-on-two.

01:45:13.717 --> 01:45:15.378
Oh, that play is so awesome.

01:45:16.139 --> 01:45:18.320
He threw it up to himself like he was passing it.

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.202
I had a question for my teammates during the game.

01:45:21.543 --> 01:45:23.064
Like, what is going on?

01:45:23.624 --> 01:45:27.927
Do you not see that they're really trying to get you off the court?

01:45:28.007 --> 01:45:29.048
And we're like, so what?

01:45:29.108 --> 01:45:32.330
I guess that's how an NBA game is played.

01:45:33.391 --> 01:45:39.035
Pippen, Jordan, and the Americans cruised to another victory, this one by 38 points.

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.117
But the domination had its detractors.

01:45:43.723 --> 01:45:49.086
Ervin, there's been some comments that the Dream Team is getting all the attention, and there seems to be some resentment about it.

01:45:49.106 --> 01:45:50.987
Have you heard about it, and do you have any feelings about it?

01:45:52.448 --> 01:45:54.589
Basically, you know, we haven't heard about it.

01:45:54.769 --> 01:45:56.030
We're just here to do our job.

01:45:57.451 --> 01:46:05.835
The media may have been looking for signs of a backlash, but in Barcelona, and in the world beyond, the embrace of the Dream Team was universal.

01:46:07.376 --> 01:46:09.277
You're gonna stand out and root against Picasso?

01:46:09.297 --> 01:46:10.558
I mean, seriously.

01:46:11.378 --> 01:46:12.519
They're rooted for genius at work.

01:46:14.355 --> 01:46:17.016
I kept thinking that the attention would dissipate.

01:46:17.636 --> 01:46:22.977
They're going to play the first game, they're going to win by 60, people are going to go back and watch the track.

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:26.417
It didn't.

01:46:26.498 --> 01:46:28.598
It kept building and building and building.

01:46:39.991 --> 01:46:41.732
The workers were trying to get autographs.

01:46:41.752 --> 01:46:43.554
The security people were trying to get autographs.

01:46:44.154 --> 01:46:51.981
All the athletes were standing alongside like a parade.

01:46:55.144 --> 01:46:57.706
People perceived us as being superheroes.

01:46:58.126 --> 01:47:08.115
Don't forget that Michael Jordan, when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, said very first and foremost, in every video, in every championship, there was always Scottie Pippen.

01:47:08.973 --> 01:47:10.074
Don't ever forget that.

01:47:10.134 --> 01:47:18.201
No matter what they tell you about their rivalry or their feud or whatever, Michael Jordan always credits Scottie Pippen.

01:47:18.221 --> 01:47:19.862
He could have never done anything without him.

01:47:19.902 --> 01:47:21.503
He didn't do anything without him.

01:47:29.022 --> 01:47:32.244
The guy on the bench is taking pictures.

01:47:32.765 --> 01:47:37.007
And I said, wow, we are having an effect over here.

01:47:37.027 --> 01:47:43.452
It was as if the President of the United States was in the midst of a caravan that was going through the streets.

01:47:57.022 --> 01:48:02.288
It was like the Beatles, where there's thousands and thousands of people waiting all the time.

01:48:03.309 --> 01:48:05.712
That was the most exhilarating 15 seconds of my life.

01:48:07.254 --> 01:48:10.157
For the players, surreal experiences have become the norm.

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:14.843
But even more memorable were the unlikely friendships developing behind the curtain.

01:48:15.942 --> 01:48:17.223
It was a unique mix.

01:48:17.884 --> 01:48:22.048
You know, Larry Bird and Patrick Ewing became like best friends.

01:48:22.408 --> 01:48:25.511
I got a white guy from Indiana, and I got a brother from Jamaica.

01:48:25.791 --> 01:48:27.112
Patrick said I could pick his mind.

01:48:27.212 --> 01:48:28.513
It took me three minutes.

01:48:28.553 --> 01:48:31.456
Now I get the chance to come back and start picking on mine.

01:48:32.517 --> 01:48:33.077
Took me one.

01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:39.203
We were probably the two of the most unlikely people you thought that would be friends.

01:48:40.734 --> 01:48:46.737
But if you look, not only Larry and I got to be great friends, but all of those guys got to be much better friends.

01:48:48.818 --> 01:48:50.339
We all enjoyed each other.

01:48:50.379 --> 01:48:52.140
We all enjoyed the ride.

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.482
And we got a sense of each other as men.

01:48:57.583 --> 01:49:01.185
Then when we got to the court, it made it even better.

01:49:02.065 --> 01:49:05.587
The dream team's chemistry turned out to be the hallmark of their success.

01:49:06.568 --> 01:49:08.749
As the players closed in on what they came for,

01:49:13.636 --> 01:49:21.325
Their big margins of victory may have been a testament to their dominance, but numbers couldn't capture what made watching them so unforgettable.

01:49:22.707 --> 01:49:25.751
Guys played the best basketball you've ever seen in your life.

01:49:26.572 --> 01:49:30.016
It was literally like great poetry or great art.

01:49:30.735 --> 01:49:36.558
At times, you feel you're watching a performance, a concert, rather than a basketball competition.

01:49:37.418 --> 01:49:38.038
This was fun.

01:49:38.759 --> 01:49:41.880
This was like... It's how basketball's supposed to be.

01:49:43.181 --> 01:49:52.705
And at the centre of the fun was the team's biggest star, who had come to Barcelona at the peak of his powers and shown how much his popularity had exploded.

01:49:52.725 --> 01:49:56.327
I will say this one thing about Michael Jordan.

01:49:58.154 --> 01:50:00.175
I've been around other celebrities in my life.

01:50:01.075 --> 01:50:04.656
I've never seen people react like they do to him.

01:50:05.277 --> 01:50:07.117
People go crazy when they see him.

01:50:09.678 --> 01:50:14.860
Someday, Jaycee on the hardwoods is going to play one-on-one against Michael Jordan while we talk about basketball.

01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:16.481
Mark my word.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:25.521
in every corner of the world.

01:50:25.541 --> 01:50:27.882
While we talk about biology, I blew that one.

01:50:29.943 --> 01:50:32.484
There was someone who just wanted to see him.

01:50:32.944 --> 01:50:34.344
Please, Michael Jordan!

01:50:34.865 --> 01:50:40.167
No one had the sort of pull, the gravity that Michael Jordan had.

01:50:43.728 --> 01:50:51.992
The Dream Team squared off against Croatia again in the gold medal game, offering the world one more lasting impression of their supremacy.

01:50:53.032 --> 01:50:54.333
Markley with the lead for Mullum.

01:50:54.373 --> 01:50:57.656
Behind the back, Drexler.

01:50:57.676 --> 01:51:00.218
Team USA came to send a message tonight.

01:51:01.499 --> 01:51:10.546
We wanted to win and we wanted to dominate, but how we did it, sharing the ball, including everybody, we did it as a true team.

01:51:11.287 --> 01:51:11.988
The U.S.

01:51:12.048 --> 01:51:20.595
has defeated Croatia 117-85, and they have won the gold here in Barcelona.

01:51:28.945 --> 01:51:35.189
There was never really any doubt the Dream Team would win gold in 1992.

01:51:35.409 --> 01:51:41.973
But as they walked back onto the court to get their medals, the moment still overwhelmed them.

01:51:43.094 --> 01:51:45.455
We saw a lot of tears from players.

01:51:46.356 --> 01:51:51.279
It was a very proud moment for me because anytime you represent your country, you know, that's a prideful thing.

01:51:53.024 --> 01:52:02.390
In Michael Jordan's inducted into the Hall of Fame, Basketball Hall of Fame, you can find out that one of his brothers served in the Army for 31 years, one of his older brothers.

01:52:07.973 --> 01:52:08.333
Man.

01:52:10.235 --> 01:52:11.595
Sent chills down my spine.

01:52:12.556 --> 01:52:16.118
It was a reward that I had never felt like that I would ever achieve.

01:52:17.979 --> 01:52:22.462
To do it on that stage with those group of guys, it's a memory I'll never forget.

01:52:24.188 --> 01:52:28.090
Nothing in my life has ever felt like standing on that podium.

01:52:29.931 --> 01:52:31.132
I was getting goosebumps.

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:38.696
Every single time I heard the National Anthem after that had a different significance to me.

01:52:39.797 --> 01:52:42.638
I knew what it really meant, you know.

01:52:44.859 --> 01:52:53.144
As a young kid growing up, I used to watch Olympics on TV with my father, and all he talked about was the Star Spangled Banner and the gold medal.

01:52:54.462 --> 01:52:56.163
It made him feel proud to be American.

01:52:57.183 --> 01:53:04.826
Being up on that podium that night and receiving it, my father, he'd been pretty proud.

01:53:06.806 --> 01:53:09.867
All those emotions just overcame me.

01:53:11.128 --> 01:53:14.649
I got to be one of the guys one more time for my country.

01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:19.831
I said, man, I'll never forget this moment.

01:53:21.371 --> 01:53:22.652
You know, if this is the end,

01:53:24.246 --> 01:53:25.507
This is how I wanted to go out.

01:53:26.928 --> 01:53:34.474
This group may well be the greatest team ever assembled in the history of team sports.

01:53:36.195 --> 01:53:41.219
But when the medal ceremony was over, another realization began to settle in.

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:48.905
When I walked off, I remember thinking that whole dream has come to an end.

01:53:52.435 --> 01:53:58.197
The next season, every Olympian except Magic Johnson and Larry Bird would return to the NBA.

01:54:00.097 --> 01:54:11.780
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen would win their third title against Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, on the way to six championships overall, the last three with Tony Kukoc.

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:18.002
Eventually, other members of the team would also win titles.

01:54:21.124 --> 01:54:24.526
But each NBA player on the Dream Team would reach the Hall of Fame.

01:54:26.408 --> 01:54:31.051
Still, it's what they did together that summer that had the biggest impact on the game.

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:34.393
An impact that continues to grow today.

01:54:36.134 --> 01:54:48.543
It really lifted basketball and it gave birth to international stars who had nothing to do with those games in 92, but who took so much from it.

01:54:50.339 --> 01:54:52.461
We made the game a worldwide game.

01:54:52.481 --> 01:54:55.423
You know, I talked to Tony Parker.

01:54:57.065 --> 01:54:58.125
I talked to Ginobili.

01:54:59.667 --> 01:55:01.068
I talked to Dirk Nowitzki.

01:55:02.309 --> 01:55:06.212
Those guys say their first love of basketball started with the Dream Team.

01:55:06.893 --> 01:55:08.214
And I'm really proud of that.

01:55:11.056 --> 01:55:12.817
Look at the size of that man.

01:55:13.775 --> 01:55:18.636
His head is tiny because his fricking chest is massive.

01:55:18.676 --> 01:55:20.496
There are moments in time you never forget.

01:55:22.037 --> 01:55:23.257
No matter how long it's been.

01:55:25.097 --> 01:55:27.578
No matter how much else has changed in your life since.

01:55:29.838 --> 01:55:34.379
20 years later, they've all kept ties to the game in one way or another.

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:41.301
And they all talk about the summer of 92 as if it happened just yesterday.

01:55:42.768 --> 01:55:47.350
an experience still unlike any other in their remarkable basketball lives.

01:55:50.631 --> 01:55:53.392
I've never had more fun being around anybody.

01:55:54.132 --> 01:55:55.352
Everybody got along.

01:55:55.593 --> 01:55:56.733
There was no ego.

01:55:57.213 --> 01:55:58.053
We had fun.

01:55:58.934 --> 01:56:02.095
You know, clearly everybody reminds me I never won a championship.

01:56:02.735 --> 01:56:07.757
So that was like winning the championship, winning the gold medal and hanging out with these guys.

01:56:10.233 --> 01:56:13.875
The reward itself is really only a... See how humble he is?

01:56:15.115 --> 01:56:15.855
I love that guy.

01:56:15.955 --> 01:56:16.996
Small part of the story.

01:56:18.797 --> 01:56:23.759
It's what the gold medal represents that will always tie these men together.

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:33.563
This is like, this fraternity is pretty awesome.

01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:40.035
I don't think you're ever gonna be able to get 11 Hall of Famers to play all at once on one team.

01:56:40.635 --> 01:56:46.040
That's- You know why I think, can you see why I think this shirt is so cool?

01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:48.383
This is like one of my favorite possessions.

01:56:49.804 --> 01:56:50.104
Wave.

01:56:50.245 --> 01:56:51.165
It's nuts.

01:56:51.426 --> 01:56:52.347
Wave outside your window.

01:56:53.928 --> 01:56:54.889
I can't believe it.

01:56:55.029 --> 01:56:56.751
It's so magical.

01:56:56.851 --> 01:56:57.872
I just saw my God.

01:57:04.913 --> 01:57:06.574
It changed sport as we know it.

01:57:08.395 --> 01:57:09.856
They showed the world how to play basketball.

01:57:09.896 --> 01:57:10.616
Golly, he's big.

01:57:11.137 --> 01:57:12.017
What other team can say that?

01:57:13.158 --> 01:57:17.180
I don't think we'll ever see anything like it again.

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.000
But you know what?

01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:25.785
I do actually think that Giga Home Biological and the movement that we can inspire among our fellow people on earth

01:57:26.516 --> 01:57:27.898
could actually change the world.

01:57:28.178 --> 01:57:31.081
I'm not going to change the world, but together we could.

01:57:31.802 --> 01:57:37.067
Together we could help people realize that population pyramid is the one thing that nobody showed us.

01:57:37.825 --> 01:57:45.768
And it would be the one thing that would reveal an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that could be misconstrued as a crisis.

01:57:46.528 --> 01:57:58.332
And I believe an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was misconstrued as a crisis in America, and they used manslaughter and lies in America to bamboozle the rest of the planet.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:10.726
Our rise in all-cause mortality sculpted by manslaughter and lies was argued as evidence that the lockdowns in New Zealand and Australia were effective, that the masks in Japan were effective.

01:58:11.966 --> 01:58:18.870
And in reality, they were murdering Americans with very simple changes in protocols that they knew would result in death.

01:58:20.851 --> 01:58:23.372
Or at least doctors worth their shalts should have known.

01:58:24.815 --> 01:58:51.463
And in addition to that, a CDC orchestrated policy which set up Americans to be addicted to opioids and then took them away and criminalized their prescription, created a crisis that could be taken advantage of by any global movement, national security operation that was managing the population pyramid problem with, you know, tough shit if you're on opioids.

01:58:52.509 --> 01:58:54.770
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth.

01:58:55.571 --> 01:59:02.314
Racism is not endemic in America and a virus did not go endemic from Wuhan over the last six years.

01:59:02.894 --> 01:59:08.897
They have used nonspecific PCR on the background of an irreducibly complex genetic storm.

01:59:09.738 --> 01:59:17.342
And they use placebo to make the transfection safe, but they are still using their tests to find their ghosts and finding ever more ghosts.

01:59:17.442 --> 01:59:21.164
And so if you want to save your kids, you've got to dispel this myth.

01:59:21.724 --> 01:59:28.408
And you've got to show your kids that there is a fake anti-vax health freedom movement under whose spell we have fallen.

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:32.471
Ladies and gentlemen, have a wonderful Independence Day.

01:59:32.911 --> 01:59:38.735
Please remember that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:59:39.215 --> 01:59:42.077
Please remember that viruses aren't pattern integrities.

01:59:42.477 --> 01:59:45.219
And please remember that it was always transfection.

01:59:45.239 --> 01:59:46.399
They want your DNA.

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.361
They're already taking it in the UK.

01:59:49.381 --> 01:59:52.765
And they want you to believe in pandemics forever.

01:59:53.406 --> 01:59:56.350
That's why this paper exists.

01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:57.912
They're traders, ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:58.493 --> 01:59:59.314
They're all traders.

01:59:59.974 --> 02:00:01.116
Thank you very much for being here.

02:00:01.136 --> 02:00:02.217
See you again on Monday.

02:00:03.178 --> 02:00:04.500
Have a wonderful weekend.

02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:05.781
I love you all very, very much.

02:00:05.882 --> 02:00:07.343
Team USA, baby!

02:00:22.941 --> 02:00:29.602
If you like what you saw and you'd like to support the stream, you'd be supporting Jonathan J. Cooey and his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:00:30.363 --> 02:00:38.384
You can find the evidence of his academic work on the National Library of Medicine PubWed website using cooey-jj.

02:00:38.804 --> 02:00:52.427
You can also buy the book called Wuhan Cover-Up, help that great organization, Children's Health Defense, and get a copy of the real history of the Wuhan Cover-Up with all of my notations and even the statement where it says they wouldn't even need a virus.

02:00:54.048 --> 02:00:58.650
I also have a YouTube channel, but I'm probably going to get another strike for today, which is really annoying.

02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:01.651
And you know, you just need to share it.

02:01:01.731 --> 02:01:04.733
Please share the stream, share the links.

02:01:04.993 --> 02:01:08.895
You can also download them from stream.kingohm.bio and then share them directly.

02:01:08.935 --> 02:01:11.196
You can download a small version or an ad.

02:01:11.716 --> 02:01:12.657
an audio version.

02:01:13.337 --> 02:01:21.843
And if you do like what you saw and you want to support or share in another way, share with GigaOMBiological.com because there you can also find ways to support the stream.

02:01:22.243 --> 02:01:22.883
Thank you very much.

02:01:24.344 --> 02:01:28.587
And yeah, I'm on Wikipedia, but only on Maybritt Moser's website.

02:01:28.607 --> 02:01:29.628
It's funny you looked at that.

02:01:29.668 --> 02:01:30.609
I looked at that too.

02:01:31.049 --> 02:01:31.809
Thanks for being here.

02:01:31.829 --> 02:01:32.470
See you again soon.
