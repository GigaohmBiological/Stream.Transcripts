WEBVTT

00:00.129 --> 00:11.308
don't worry Mike I'm gonna let you out in a second don't worry I promise I just want to just want to get this going here relax buddy relax

00:27.102 --> 00:35.109
Earlier this month, a Trump administration plan to cut the National Institutes of Health budget by more than 40% was leaked to the press.

00:35.890 --> 00:45.258
The preliminary budget sent shockwaves through the nation's health agency, but also the wider scientific community that relies on the NIH to fund research.

00:46.139 --> 00:54.026
Since January, 1,300 NIH employees have been fired and more than $2 billion in research grants canceled.

00:54.881 --> 01:02.472
It's all part of the administration's effort to shrink the federal government, an effort led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

01:03.253 --> 01:10.142
Tonight, you will hear from an NIH insider about the immediate impact of the cuts on research and patients.

01:10.743 --> 01:15.429
But we begin with Dr. Francis Collins, the longtime director of the agency.

01:16.130 --> 01:25.181
He told us why he abruptly left the NIH and why he fears aggressive downsizing could impact the health of Americans for generations.

01:27.264 --> 01:29.507
The story will continue in a moment.

01:32.574 --> 01:47.290
When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.

01:47.431 --> 01:49.413
Those are people's lives at risk.

01:49.904 --> 01:59.732
Dr. Francis Collins spent 32 years at the National Institutes of Health, serving as the agency's director for 12 years under three presidential administrations.

02:00.352 --> 02:06.437
But he says even he was unprepared for the speed and severity of budget cuts at the NIH.

02:06.998 --> 02:12.422
Give me a sense of what it was like inside the NIH as these cuts started rolling out.

02:12.970 --> 02:20.954
Almost immediately after inauguration, there were statements made that you were not allowed, for instance, to start any new projects.

02:22.715 --> 02:26.136
The ability to order supplies was cut off.

02:27.737 --> 02:34.661
Eventually, it was started back up again, but then they put a $1 limit on what you could order.

02:35.441 --> 02:36.682
There's not much you can order for $1.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.952
Today we celebrate a major landmark in biology and medicine.

02:41.353 --> 02:53.102
Collins joined the NIH in 1993 to lead the Human Genome Project and later directed the agency's development of new tests, therapeutics, and vaccines during the pandemic.

02:54.443 --> 02:55.504
Good morning, everybody.

02:55.544 --> 02:56.244
Welcome to the show.

02:56.304 --> 02:57.605
This is Get Going Biological.

02:57.625 --> 03:01.789
I just wanted to draw attention to the fact that actually Francis Collins

03:03.662 --> 03:08.723
was appointed the head of the Human Genome Project, yada, yada, yada.

03:08.904 --> 03:12.004
And his primary deal was, thank you, this leash is right in here.

03:12.664 --> 03:15.125
He was just, I just had to show him.

03:18.406 --> 03:25.668
That he actually first, his claim to fame was that he had found the gene behind cystic fibrosis.

03:25.748 --> 03:30.249
And cystic fibrosis is a really, it's a really interesting,

03:32.921 --> 03:48.615
It's a really interesting medical condition that has to do, one of the primary problems with it is an excess of mucus.

03:50.056 --> 04:00.405
And mucus, of course, is this sort of rather oddly ubiquitous substance in nature that often forms the

04:02.503 --> 04:10.310
physiological barrier or marks the physiological barrier between the outside world and the inside world.

04:10.490 --> 04:26.263
And what happens inside of mucus as a substrate is actually quite extraordinary in a very parallel way from coral to anemones to fish to the mucus of our own lungs and gut.

04:28.180 --> 04:38.130
And so it's very curious that a guy who found a gene related to mucus production gets appointed to the Human Genome Project.

04:38.170 --> 04:42.955
I think it's a little bit more subtle than that.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.578
And that's part of what we're trying to

04:46.539 --> 04:52.964
I'm trying to get over the finish line here, and I'm hoping that you are following along well enough to see the red thread.

04:53.884 --> 04:55.826
So here he is holding up a coronavirus.

04:55.866 --> 05:03.151
Of course, we know all about the guitar-playing folk singer and NIH director Francis Collins.

05:03.271 --> 05:09.696
Of course, he is the mentor of people like Mark Lander and our friend Kevin McKernan.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.438
So I'll just let this play.

05:13.118 --> 05:15.420
This is 60 minutes from like a couple days ago.

05:16.286 --> 05:21.529
Still, he says, even after COVID, most people don't know what the NIH does.

05:21.949 --> 05:27.293
The National Institutes of Health, NIH, is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world.

05:27.593 --> 05:32.315
What are some of the medical breakthroughs that people might not be aware of that came through the NIH?

05:32.596 --> 05:37.398
Deaths from heart disease are down by 75% in the last 40 years.

05:37.819 --> 05:38.619
That's NIH.

05:38.759 --> 05:40.580
Deaths from stroke are down about 75%.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.121
That's NIH.

05:43.722 --> 05:46.683
HIV, AIDS, where that was a death sentence.

05:47.463 --> 05:54.365
Now, if you have access to those antiretrovirals, NIH and drug companies came up with that, you have a normal lifespan.

05:55.265 --> 06:00.187
The NIH is headquartered on the sprawling 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland.

06:00.767 --> 06:07.889
It's home to the largest clinical research hospital in the world and 27 research institutes and centers.

06:08.817 --> 06:20.942
The leaked budget draft includes a plan to consolidate those 27 institutes and centers into eight and eliminate four, including the Institutes of Nursing Research and Minority Health.

06:22.242 --> 06:29.025
If approved by Congress, it would be the largest budget cut by an administration to the health agency, but not the first.

06:29.585 --> 06:36.808
Most recently, Presidents Bush and Obama made smaller cuts to the NIH, which currently has a $47 billion budget.

06:39.332 --> 06:45.494
But Collins says the bulk of that budget, more than 80 percent, goes to researchers off campus.

06:45.954 --> 06:49.856
Most of that goes out to the universities and institutes all over the country.

06:50.296 --> 07:00.019
They're the ones that do the work, but they get the funds from NIH by writing very compelling grant applications that go through the most rigorous peer review system in the world.

07:00.757 --> 07:08.200
Some of those researchers' work lines America's medicine cabinets, such as statins, antidepressants, and new forms of insulin.

07:08.620 --> 07:08.940
Wow.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.083
I mean, two out of the three of those are going to be proven to be completely dumb in like five years or less.

07:15.143 --> 07:19.284
Statins already has been accepted as ridiculous.

07:19.344 --> 07:23.426
The idea of lowering cholesterol is biologically ridiculous.

07:24.950 --> 07:30.194
And just the whole concept that, oh, wow, it is remarkable.

07:30.294 --> 07:38.679
Only one of the things in that list, antidepressants, statins, and insulin.

07:38.739 --> 07:41.401
Like, wow, that's remarkable.

07:43.635 --> 07:55.780
A Journal of the American Medical Association study found that between 2010 and 2019, 99 percent of FDA-approved drugs had ties to research funded by the NIH.

07:56.678 --> 08:06.101
Every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year.

08:06.562 --> 08:08.122
That's a pretty darn good return.

08:08.362 --> 08:12.904
These kinds of return on investment calculations are such an enchantment.

08:13.004 --> 08:14.525
It's a ridiculous assertion.

08:18.746 --> 08:28.694
that neither that journalist nor this guy can adequately either verify or back up with calculations that make any sense.

08:28.734 --> 08:33.418
That's really, it is really, it's just gross.

08:34.719 --> 08:41.324
But not good enough to escape the crosshairs of the Trump administration's sweeping budget cuts.

08:41.964 --> 08:45.908
In February, Dr. Collins decided to leave the NIH.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.054
It just became untenable.

08:48.074 --> 08:58.020
I was, as every other scientist in that circumstance, not allowed to speak in any kind of scientific meeting or public setting.

08:58.140 --> 09:03.363
You don't think if you would have stayed there, you would have been in a better position to fight for the scientists and the work?

09:04.683 --> 09:05.924
I don't think it would have helped.

09:05.944 --> 09:11.828
I would have been pretty much in a circumstance of not being able to speak about it.

09:13.180 --> 09:26.143
I'm still trying to decide whether they're going to have Jay Bhattacharya do something culturally relevant to his own background in order to contribute similarly to how Francis Collins did to the mission of the NIH.

09:26.763 --> 09:35.966
It seems like one of Francis Collins' big thing was to sing at inaugurations and to sing at special events.

09:36.966 --> 09:40.973
And that shtick can't really be given up at this point.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.696
You're kind of replacing a guy, right?

09:42.756 --> 09:49.668
So I wonder if Jay Bhattacharya has the requisite musical talent to really fill these shoes.

09:53.735 --> 10:00.797
With the exception of a series of rallies, most scientists connected to the NIH have remained quiet.

10:01.297 --> 10:07.299
I'm just going to say something super controversial here to see if I can cause anybody to get mad.

10:07.979 --> 10:20.883
But in April 2025, with all of the amazing social media that we have, I am no longer convinced that protesting in a particular place in America other than where you live

10:21.861 --> 10:28.406
is a very useful way of using your resources.

10:28.546 --> 10:32.809
And those resources include time, but they also include money.

10:33.409 --> 10:35.951
They also include risking travel, this kind of thing.

10:35.991 --> 10:43.917
Not to say that travel's bad, but if you're traveling, you better be doing it to gain the maximum positivity from it.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.138
You shouldn't be traveling

10:45.678 --> 11:07.428
in order to exercise some kind of political freedom that couldn't otherwise be better exercised on a daily basis by establishing an email network, or on a daily basis by getting in touch with your neighbors, or on a daily basis by attending a church, or by a daily basis of doing community service like leading a Cub Scout group.

11:07.568 --> 11:07.968
I don't know.

11:09.707 --> 11:21.376
But the idea that people are being encouraged to travel around the United States and carry around signs in hopes that they might be able to make some impact, this is, oh my goodness, it's terrible.

11:21.976 --> 11:28.721
The reason why it worked in the past was because there was only one front page in each town to get on.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.845
And you knew what photographer was likely taking that picture.

11:33.885 --> 11:36.207
This is a very different media landscape.

11:37.190 --> 11:41.454
The vast majority of people are way, way, way, way past that.

11:41.574 --> 11:56.227
And so if we want to wake people up to the trap that they're in, we want to wake young people up to the trap that they're in, first thing to do is for them to understand how to better, how to better use their resources.

11:58.655 --> 12:01.477
I just hate to see all these people traveling to D.C.

12:01.537 --> 12:03.079
to hold signs.

12:03.119 --> 12:06.701
I mean the whole rescue the republic thing to go to D.C.

12:06.742 --> 12:12.126
and listen to Brett Weinstein speak from behind a plexiglass barrier is just absurd.

12:14.454 --> 12:23.841
You would be better off buying a four-wheeler and keeping it in your garage in hopes that maybe there will be a zombie apocalypse than to use that same amount of money to go to D.C.

12:24.582 --> 12:30.707
and stand behind a metal traffic barrier and listen to Bret Weinstein on stage.

12:30.767 --> 12:31.427
That was so absurd.

12:34.773 --> 12:42.470
Like this physician scientist who still works at the agency, fear their jobs or research may be targeted for speaking up.

12:43.011 --> 12:45.055
He asked us to conceal his identity.

12:46.159 --> 12:57.988
I guess I should have given it a little bit more context here, but this 60 Minutes is in the same week that they do this 60 Minutes about the bird flu and the lady saying worst case scenario.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.029
We want to avoid worst case scenario.

13:00.049 --> 13:10.717
And now we're also talking about the just defunding of science in America and the undermining of everything that's, you know, I guess important.

13:11.438 --> 13:13.299
I mean, what are we really talking about here?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.121
It's such a drama.

13:16.385 --> 13:17.085
over nothing.

13:18.206 --> 13:25.128
They just casually throw in there that Obama made cuts, Bush made cuts, Clinton made cuts, but these are even bigger cuts.

13:27.269 --> 13:34.131
Seeing the morale of an institution or any place change so abruptly to where we feel fear.

13:34.798 --> 13:40.561
It began, he says, in February, when more than 1,000 probationary employees were placed on leave.

13:41.162 --> 13:47.665
When that happened, that first hit, what was the reaction like immediately and in the office the next Monday?

13:47.885 --> 13:48.325
Tears.

13:48.806 --> 13:53.388
Everybody trying to assess damage, who's been fired, who hasn't been fired, what do we do?

13:54.449 --> 14:00.272
And then an immediate sort of assessment in the clinical center, OK, can we still take care of patients?

14:01.133 --> 14:03.634
And our research participants, is it still safe?

14:03.942 --> 14:09.884
No one thought before they fired the people that dealt with the patients that maybe they shouldn't be fired.

14:09.904 --> 14:12.005
This didn't come from within NIH.

14:12.065 --> 14:13.225
It came from outside.

14:13.765 --> 14:28.790
They don't know what these people... And so we're talking about institutions, for example, universities that pay their entire bureaucracy of deans and associate deans and head department heads from $500,000 a year and up.

14:31.636 --> 14:36.257
They pay their entire athletic staff $500,000 a year and up.

14:38.358 --> 14:45.980
The head of departments that are entirely funded by NIH are getting half a million dollars a year as salary.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.641
That is more than a house a year in equivalent value.

14:52.622 --> 14:59.446
for being really good at writing grants or assembling a department of scholars that is very good at writing grants.

14:59.526 --> 15:02.708
That's essentially what we've created as a system in America.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.029
And now these people are whining about it.

15:08.011 --> 15:10.172
Oh, these grants are all running out.

15:10.292 --> 15:14.535
Well, they're just gonna have to justify their work even more, right?

15:14.575 --> 15:17.957
They're just gonna have to, the whole system is gonna fall apart.

15:19.991 --> 15:25.533
And the wonderful thing about it is, ladies and gentlemen, is that it doesn't really matter because they're running out of grad students.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.514
They're going to run out of undergraduates.

15:27.574 --> 15:29.795
We're running out of elementary school students.

15:32.716 --> 15:39.239
In another 10 years, we're not going to be filling football stadiums full of young 19 to 22-year-olds anymore.

15:43.021 --> 15:47.463
There's a reality coming that a lot of people don't understand, but 60 Minutes will tell you about it.

15:47.483 --> 15:47.883
Don't worry.

15:49.563 --> 15:52.646
This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy.

15:53.587 --> 16:05.777
As DOGE dismantled parts of the agency, employees told us work on child cancer therapies, dementia, and stroke slowed or stopped because critical lab and support staff were let go.

16:05.797 --> 16:08.900
NIH employees shared these photos.

16:09.660 --> 16:23.935
They say even after a six-week spending freeze at the agency was lifted, some shelves and refrigerators that held supplies for trials and patients remained empty because much of the staff that procured those supplies was fired.

16:24.616 --> 16:29.501
You can't run an organization as complicated as NIH without a support system.

16:30.121 --> 16:36.488
Doctors and nurses and scientists can't function without a lot of other resources.

16:37.108 --> 16:41.713
So this is what the other side of the country, if you will, is watching, right?

16:41.733 --> 16:44.695
We're supposed to believe that Jay Bhattacharya's got everything under control.

16:44.736 --> 16:46.137
I mean, he just gotten the job.

16:46.597 --> 16:48.019
How much could he have really done?

16:49.585 --> 16:59.914
Yet the Trump administration has apparently just cut everything and changed stuff and they're already gonna rename stuff and consolidate different parts of the organization under different names.

17:02.436 --> 17:04.258
So is it not Jay Bhattacharya?

17:04.298 --> 17:07.140
Jay Bhattacharya is talking to Dr. Drew.

17:12.545 --> 17:14.206
In front of a White House symbol.

17:15.848 --> 17:17.069
The hell's going on here?

17:19.540 --> 17:33.951
It sure seems like the media, the mainstream media and social media is harmonizing in a very malevolent way to make it seem like America is, wow, what is going on?

17:33.971 --> 17:43.238
They need an entire support infrastructure and that has now been decimated.

17:44.835 --> 17:47.377
Some of the fired employees have been brought back.

17:47.837 --> 17:50.839
Others are still being paid, but not allowed to work.

17:51.719 --> 17:57.322
This doesn't feel like a strategic plan to reorganize and make the NIH better and more efficient.

17:57.783 --> 17:59.483
It feels like a wrecking ball.

18:00.044 --> 18:05.107
Typically, when a company has layoffs, they talk about restructuring.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.408
There'll be a new structure, and this is how it's going to work.

18:08.269 --> 18:10.590
Is there a structure in place right now for the NIH?

18:11.851 --> 18:13.992
Not that anybody shared with no idea.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.763
you know, making the organization better.

18:16.943 --> 18:18.084
Everybody is for that.

18:18.144 --> 18:19.225
There's no question.

18:19.505 --> 18:21.646
But again, this is not more efficient.

18:22.246 --> 18:27.769
It is infinitely less efficient right now because you can't get anything done.

18:28.470 --> 18:38.135
The confusion in Bethesda has also paralyzed many of the 2,500 universities and institutes that rely on the NIH to help fund their research.

18:39.187 --> 18:52.254
So far, nearly 800 grants have been terminated, some on HIV and AIDS, trans health and COVID-19, after researchers were told their work was no longer an agency priority.

18:53.211 --> 18:56.973
And last week, the NIH signaled that more cuts could be coming.

18:57.473 --> 19:09.739
It announced that any university with a DEI program or that boycotts an Israeli company might not be awarded new NIH grants for medical research and that existing grants could be terminated.

19:10.559 --> 19:13.521
Without NIH funding, I would not be where I am today.

19:14.500 --> 19:19.724
Kristen Weinstein is a wife, mother, and PhD candidate at the University of Washington.

19:20.385 --> 19:25.609
She hoped to continue her research on cancer and autoimmunity after graduation.

19:26.229 --> 19:28.792
And now, what are you thinking about your future?

19:28.872 --> 19:32.915
Yeah, it's in some ways bleak.

19:33.635 --> 19:43.483
It's really hard for me to imagine and not get just absolutely gutted, frustrated by the idea that they're making some kind of big deal about what every

19:44.639 --> 19:56.005
person that's tried to climb the academic ladder goes through to now make it seem as though this girl or some other people are suffering even more than before because there are even less jobs.

19:56.045 --> 19:59.487
There are going to be less jobs because there are going to be less college students.

20:00.828 --> 20:09.453
We don't need more tenure track professors at universities that aren't teaching because there are going to be even less students.

20:11.380 --> 20:18.326
And so I don't really understand what's gonna happen to the university system, but it's slowly going to die.

20:18.466 --> 20:22.909
It has to, because we won't have the requisite number of people to support it.

20:23.049 --> 20:32.697
Even if we allow all this immigration, and even if all these people learn English and pick a pro team and start buying hats, it ain't gonna matter.

20:38.001 --> 20:38.762
That's the point.

20:39.770 --> 20:42.570
The population pyramid is a real issue.

20:42.630 --> 20:45.871
It is a real certainty that is coming.

20:46.951 --> 20:56.293
And these people behind the scenes, the overclass that sit at the control panel of weaponized piles of money, they've known that this is coming for a long time.

20:56.693 --> 20:58.853
And they're maximizing its usefulness.

21:00.654 --> 21:08.235
Maximizing its usefulness to ruin our cultures, to ruin our sense of ourselves, to homogenate

21:10.168 --> 21:16.894
the human population on social media into thinking that somehow or another they know what's going on.

21:18.075 --> 21:22.438
It's a military social control program, that's all it is.

21:23.299 --> 21:28.784
And every time you get on there and scroll, you are wasting your thoughts.

21:31.246 --> 21:36.751
And if anybody thinks that I'm on X trying to make a difference, you're crazy.

21:36.831 --> 21:44.118
I'm trying to illustrate how awful a platform it is in hopes that people will see it and leave.

21:45.059 --> 21:50.804
I don't want you to read my X. If you're not using X or Twitter, then definitely don't go there.

21:52.165 --> 22:05.514
but that's how I got sucked into this was thinking that the truth was being told or given away on X and that these direct message groups were solving a mystery and they needed my help.

22:08.356 --> 22:16.281
We're now in April, 2025, almost in May and 60 Minutes has again turned on the narrative curation

22:18.081 --> 22:29.805
not that dissimilar to how they did in February of 2020 or January of 2020 or end of 2019 from Peter Daszak all the way to George Webb.

22:31.706 --> 22:40.089
And so I do think it's relevant to watch 60 Minutes because 60 Minutes is the is is what people are trapped on their couch watching.

22:40.169 --> 22:44.170
It's what the the over 50 people are often watching.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.211
This sound

22:47.148 --> 22:49.269
This sound is a very trusted sound.

22:49.309 --> 22:51.149
They really like this sound a lot.

22:51.629 --> 22:53.450
They really like the sound of ticking.

22:53.490 --> 23:06.134
Every time they hear it, it makes them sink a little bit further into their recliner and bring the covers up to their shoulders and relax because they know they're about to be told the truth.

23:11.448 --> 23:18.270
The truth is available, but you have to be able to see that what you see on television is the inversion of it.

23:18.310 --> 23:22.832
What you see on social media is often the direct inversion of it.

23:24.052 --> 23:28.453
Or else it's just there's something right there that everybody just talks around.

23:30.094 --> 23:34.535
Some crucial biological fact that everybody just talks around.

23:35.916 --> 23:39.097
And as long as they do it with a little bit of skill and a little

23:40.205 --> 23:45.568
a little nuance, it's virtually impossible for any individual person to see through the act.

23:46.448 --> 23:50.650
And 60 Minutes is just a very, very well-produced version of this.

23:51.150 --> 23:56.493
Nationwide, there is a hiring freeze at virtually every major academic university.

23:56.693 --> 24:02.876
And even if I did happen to secure a position, now the funding is so uncertain.

24:03.276 --> 24:08.259
I don't know if I would have funding to actually do the research that I was hired on to do in whatever lab I join.

24:09.844 --> 24:13.087
We're very seriously considering at this point leaving the United States.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.529
Don't let the door hit you on the ass.

24:16.810 --> 24:19.572
Oh my goodness, it's brain drain.

24:20.512 --> 24:23.054
All of our grad students are going to go to China.

24:23.695 --> 24:24.295
Oh no.

24:24.756 --> 24:29.880
Weinstein has met with faculty at universities in Europe and spoke in the labs in Canada.

24:30.280 --> 24:30.980
She's not alone.

24:31.861 --> 24:39.231
A survey of 1,600 scientists and graduate students reported 75% are considering leaving the U.S.

24:39.291 --> 24:39.711
to work.

24:40.512 --> 24:48.102
Australia, Europe and China have already boosted recruitment efforts, hoping to capitalize on the potential brain drain.

24:48.963 --> 24:57.446
I grew up with this notion that if I studied hard, I would be able to pursue whatever my interest was.

24:57.466 --> 25:00.387
But now America is letting me down.

25:00.467 --> 25:03.308
Can you see the weaponry here?

25:03.368 --> 25:07.149
Can you see the nonsense, the psychological warfare that's going on here?

25:07.429 --> 25:10.030
There's no reason to be talking to this girl.

25:11.104 --> 25:19.215
Couldn't they at least talk to us with somebody on a visa who came to America trying to live the American dream and get their PhD?

25:19.855 --> 25:21.498
Couldn't they at least talk about that?

25:22.799 --> 25:23.060
No.

25:24.061 --> 25:28.286
Now they're starting to accelerate, or the script is starting to change to Act 25.

25:32.754 --> 25:41.460
And it's about smart Americans leaving because the NIH is collapsing and there's no more guarantee I'm gonna have a job.

25:44.643 --> 25:45.843
Boy, I love it.

25:46.124 --> 25:46.524
I love it.

25:47.856 --> 25:48.417
I really do.

25:48.637 --> 25:49.177
I love this.

25:49.377 --> 25:50.538
I love this narrative a lot.

25:50.718 --> 25:54.980
I believe in the American dream when I would have to leave my own country to pursue my career.

25:56.201 --> 26:00.843
The uncertainty has also created concern for Beth Humphrey and her daughter, Laura.

26:01.584 --> 26:04.345
Beth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last year.

26:04.945 --> 26:06.486
It was devastating.

26:07.187 --> 26:11.689
There is no successful treatment and it is ultimately terminal.

26:13.641 --> 26:15.163
Where is the llama?

26:15.463 --> 26:23.453
The 68-year-old grandmother joined an NIH-funded Alzheimer's study run by Duke University and the University of North Carolina.

26:24.914 --> 26:31.422
Now, the Trump administration wants to restrict how much universities are reimbursed for overhead costs.

26:32.793 --> 26:36.655
which critics argue act as a slush fund for schools.

26:36.875 --> 26:39.357
22 states, including North Carolina, are suing.

26:40.017 --> 26:47.902
Universities warn that policy could lead to billions in losses and would have a dire impact on life-saving trials and research.

26:49.423 --> 26:53.605
If the funding is cut, what does that mean to you?

26:53.645 --> 26:54.306
What's next?

26:54.626 --> 26:56.407
That would be very disappointing to me.

26:57.853 --> 26:59.536
This is not a partisan issue.

27:00.117 --> 27:04.844
Disease doesn't know your party affiliation or your socioeconomic status.

27:05.124 --> 27:10.192
And everyone in America knows someone who has been affected by Alzheimer's.

27:11.609 --> 27:15.533
Actually, the spike protein accelerates Alzheimer's, according to Peter McCollum.

27:16.193 --> 27:21.137
This month, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya took office as the new director of the NIH.

27:21.177 --> 27:21.657
Yeah, Jay!

27:21.677 --> 27:35.909
Bhattacharya, a former Stanford professor whose research focused on the economics of healthcare, has said he was smeared by other academics after he argued against broad mask mandates and lockdowns during the pandemic.

27:36.880 --> 27:42.224
I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives.

27:42.705 --> 27:45.767
Dr. Bhattacharya declined our request for an interview.

27:45.987 --> 27:50.871
But at his Senate confirmation hearing, he outlined his plan for the agency.

27:51.392 --> 28:01.760
If confirmed, I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation.

28:02.637 --> 28:09.705
One way the NIH will carry out that agenda, Bhattacharya says, is by creating a new database to study chronic disease.

28:10.406 --> 28:23.000
The NIH will also invest $50 million to study autism in response to a request by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has clashed with scientists on the topic for years.

28:23.976 --> 28:24.677
What was that?

28:24.697 --> 28:25.277
Was that autism?

28:25.297 --> 28:25.818
Sorry, I missed that.

28:25.878 --> 28:26.678
I didn't do that.

28:26.698 --> 28:27.139
What the hell?

28:52.878 --> 28:54.279
Doesn't want me to replay that one.

28:54.719 --> 28:55.259
Sketchy.

28:55.539 --> 28:59.661
Earlier this month, a Trump administration planned to cut the National Institute.

29:00.041 --> 29:15.107
This past week, Dr. Bhattacharya told agency advisors he's working hard to undo some of the recent, quote, disruptions at the NIH, and called that draft proposal to cut its budget by 40 percent the beginning of a negotiation.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.630
The beginning of a negotiation, hmm, interesting.

29:20.690 --> 29:22.770
Hold on one second, let me get back on that.

29:27.671 --> 29:36.973
I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation.

29:37.833 --> 29:44.835
One way the NIH will carry out that agenda, Bhattacharya says, is by creating a new database to study chronic disease.

29:45.598 --> 29:58.205
The NIH will also invest $50 million to study autism, in response to a request by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has clashed with scientists on the topic for years.

29:59.166 --> 30:14.234
This past week, Dr. Bhattacharya told agency advisers he's working hard to undo some of the recent, quote, disruptions at the NIH, and called that draft proposal to cut its budget by 40 percent the beginning of a negotiation.

30:14.881 --> 30:15.582
Interesting.

30:15.682 --> 30:16.683
Okay, now I heard it.

30:16.743 --> 30:17.404
That's very good.

30:17.484 --> 30:22.028
Okay, I'll be back in one second and then we will do our little read-through.

30:22.068 --> 30:23.289
Thank you very much for being here.

30:24.010 --> 30:24.751
Good to see everybody.

30:27.978 --> 30:32.259
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooey.

30:32.299 --> 30:36.160
If you want to support this work, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to do so.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.860
If you want to share it, go to stream.gigaohm.bio.

30:38.880 --> 30:43.181
There you can download the videos, cut them up however you want to, and make your own channel.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.502
Somewhere spreading the word would be great.

30:46.522 --> 30:47.602
Thank you very much for being here.

30:47.622 --> 30:49.483
If you want to send something to me, send it to P.O.

30:49.503 --> 30:52.483
Box 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102.

30:55.524 --> 30:58.346
Thank you very much for being here again and I'll see you again shortly.

31:23.220 --> 31:23.300
so

31:43.570 --> 31:43.650
do

32:13.200 --> 32:15.641
Should have done that button first and then this button.

32:15.661 --> 32:16.161
There we go.

32:16.661 --> 32:17.521
Good morning everybody.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.282
Welcome to the show.

32:18.322 --> 32:19.782
This is GigaOM Biological.

32:20.202 --> 32:27.204
The new Biology 101 can be summarized as a life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

32:28.885 --> 32:30.845
My name is, again, Jonathan Cui.

32:30.925 --> 32:35.587
You can find my work on PubMed by using my last name C-O-U-E-Y.

32:36.628 --> 32:40.834
I presented to Panda three times, but Nick lost those presentations.

32:40.874 --> 32:51.851
But you can find a lot of my work on the Woodhouse 76 substack where Jonathan Engler and Jessica Hockett regularly take my work and pretend to argue with people like Claire Craig.

32:52.634 --> 32:58.937
or Pierre Cory, or that these ideas are just their wonderful insight into the pandemic, they're so clever.

32:59.557 --> 33:08.981
Anyway, I also was staff scientist for CHD for about half a year, and before that a scientific advisor for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:09.061 --> 33:09.922
on this book over here.

33:10.482 --> 33:11.803
the Wuhan cover-up.

33:12.803 --> 33:14.684
I'm in the index in the cast of characters.

33:14.704 --> 33:18.846
There's a few quotes in the book and there's a few papers in the book that I don't think otherwise would be in there.

33:20.166 --> 33:24.288
Suffice it to say that they're not working very hard to sell that book, but we'll keep selling it here.

33:24.308 --> 33:29.031
I'm also friends with Jay Bhattacharya, at least I was before he got NIH director.

33:29.051 --> 33:29.711
I understand that

33:30.231 --> 33:32.613
things change when you start to get invited to those meetings.

33:32.633 --> 33:36.516
So I'm not, there's no sore feelings here, no hard feelings here.

33:36.896 --> 33:40.919
Biology is the way I'm happy to be able to teach biology online.

33:40.959 --> 33:44.742
People speculate a lot about how in the world can I do it, I have so few subscribers.

33:44.782 --> 33:48.785
But actually, I have a couple angel subscribers, that's the way it works.

33:48.845 --> 33:56.911
I have a couple people, a couple families that trust what I'm doing, believe in what I'm doing, and they make it possible.

33:56.971 --> 33:58.032
And then I have about 130 other people

33:59.813 --> 34:13.560
who give more than I have given to anybody else by giving me sort of like $10 a month or I think there's one plan that I had at some point that was like $20 every three months or something, I don't know.

34:14.201 --> 34:16.202
That wasn't really well thought out when I did it.

34:16.242 --> 34:18.243
We just didn't really know where we were going with this.

34:18.303 --> 34:27.948
We just wanted to make it possible that this didn't seem like, yeah, that we could sell those PDFs of those, of the, of the,

34:29.505 --> 34:31.987
of the slides and produce a product.

34:32.347 --> 34:49.041
And at some point in time, the whole virus and fighting and trying to figure out who's on whose team and it just all, my gosh, it's still really hard to believe that it's April 2025, almost May 2025.

34:49.642 --> 34:54.466
The freshman year of my son at Bethel Park High School,

34:55.552 --> 35:01.356
where the alleged shooter of Donald Trump went to high school is almost over.

35:02.437 --> 35:14.145
And we started this in a different house at a different elementary school that matriculates into a different high school with a whole different set of neighbors.

35:15.826 --> 35:22.251
And my family has been through a lot like a lot of other families in America where our

35:23.283 --> 35:33.197
Ability to get by and how we managed to get by has changed very drastically over five years and I am very very blessed to be where I am where I have

35:34.206 --> 35:38.528
pretty nice set of equipment and it allows me to make a really, really nice little stream.

35:39.749 --> 35:41.470
But it has been a lot of hard work.

35:42.130 --> 35:57.159
What you see here happening when I switch the screen to what's here on the desk or when I switch my screen to the green screen, this is a lot of work and troubleshooting and careful assembly of Craigslist.

35:57.939 --> 36:09.662
items to make something happen in a similar way that I used to be working with a combination of a microscope and a few amplifiers and a few computers and a few lasers.

36:11.203 --> 36:18.965
And so when people are fascinated by the end product here and see an extraordinarily well-produced live stream

36:19.565 --> 36:28.752
that they can't really make sense of, all they should make sense of it is, is that the NIH used to give me funding to build half a million dollar setups, and they worked.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.914
And many of them are still in use today.

36:32.895 --> 36:47.826
And so, the idea that I'm doing something that I shouldn't be doing, I mean, I've been a photographer since I was a young kid in my mind, and the first time I had a chance to buy a camera, I did when I was in college, and I still have it.

36:48.726 --> 36:49.447
I still have it.

36:54.550 --> 36:55.711
That's what this is right here.

36:56.151 --> 37:00.054
This Nikon is a camera that I bought when I was still a bartender.

37:00.994 --> 37:03.536
Still trying to figure out what the heck I was gonna do with my life.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.097
And I still have it.

37:05.217 --> 37:06.258
This thing still turns on.

37:09.929 --> 37:12.690
And so I didn't bring nothing to the table here.

37:13.190 --> 37:26.273
I helped my brother live stream some cooking shows in Texas at the end of 2020 and help him set up a business that brought him and his wife a lot of income for a few years during the pandemic.

37:27.134 --> 37:32.395
And that technical knowledge and experience, I brought back to this.

37:32.995 --> 37:35.616
And with my imagination,

37:36.192 --> 37:40.194
been able to come up with a combination of things that really combines very well.

37:40.254 --> 37:50.498
I don't think very many people have ever thought of what happens when you put black magic, when you put black magic equipment in series.

37:52.018 --> 37:59.181
No one's ever thought about that, but that's how I get a lot of these things to happen that a lot of people don't really think about, but it's just a very easy tricks.

37:59.961 --> 38:01.342
And it's a very,

38:02.952 --> 38:12.602
It's very unfortunate that the reality of it is, is that this is probably the best show on the internet, save Housatonic ITS's live stream.

38:13.403 --> 38:16.346
And we have only 3,000 followers on Twitch.

38:16.386 --> 38:19.028
We have only a few people watching us on YouTube.

38:19.349 --> 38:25.034
It is a very under promoted stream because we don't have anybody promoting us.

38:25.115 --> 38:25.855
It's just us.

38:26.696 --> 38:28.917
There is no algorithmic promotion.

38:28.957 --> 38:31.959
We're not buying promotion on YouTube or anywhere else.

38:33.259 --> 38:35.420
It's just whatever happens by word of mouth.

38:35.540 --> 38:36.441
And in reality,

38:37.605 --> 38:45.327
because these social media platforms are military programs, there is no virality.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.808
Nobody goes viral on the internet anymore.

38:47.868 --> 38:56.950
Everybody that's going viral is going viral because somebody adjusted this knob and adjusted that knob, and that is the result of those adjustments.

38:58.191 --> 38:59.671
And it's not pessimism here.

39:00.352 --> 39:02.292
What you hear here is realism.

39:02.352 --> 39:13.095
And what that means is if we're gonna win, every person that sees value in this message is gonna need to actively share it, almost in a sort of annoying and militant style.

39:13.115 --> 39:23.498
Like just have your clipboard full and click on every blank where you're allowed to put it and plaster it all over all the time.

39:24.457 --> 39:29.260
until somebody calls you a troll and then change your account name and do the same again.

39:30.080 --> 39:34.143
Because the reality is that they have the ability to do that.

39:35.103 --> 39:37.004
in a way that doesn't even look like trolls.

39:37.544 --> 39:41.627
They have the ability to do that just by adjusting the knobs on social media.

39:41.667 --> 39:46.870
We've got to constantly remind ourselves that social media is an illusion.

39:46.970 --> 39:48.090
It is a hamster wheel.

39:48.130 --> 39:52.653
That's why these same questions and these same arguments keep coming back.

39:52.713 --> 39:58.196
That's the only explanation for Angela Rasmussen being on 60 Minutes this week.

39:59.206 --> 40:06.292
It's the only explanation for Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, being on 60 Minutes this week.

40:06.932 --> 40:11.536
Because these are some of the few people that can sustain this illusion over this length of time.

40:12.076 --> 40:12.717
They are

40:13.996 --> 40:14.837
going to fail.

40:15.437 --> 40:17.318
They definitely are going to fail.

40:17.838 --> 40:21.460
This is about our grandchildren, and that's why I know they're going to fail.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.521
They are definitely, definitely going to fail.

40:24.882 --> 40:31.126
And it's just a question of time and how it actually happens.

40:31.246 --> 40:32.687
But the background

40:33.607 --> 40:35.208
of this illusion.

40:35.729 --> 40:39.672
Once the background is properly understood, we can think our way out.

40:39.752 --> 40:47.698
The background is really only understood if you can get yourself out of this trap, the bad biology 101 or evolution because DNA.

40:47.718 --> 40:54.082
When you accept all that nonsense, then it's very hard to argue your way out of this trap where there is no background.

40:54.122 --> 40:57.485
We just have PCR and it's very, very high fidelity.

40:59.039 --> 41:07.326
So we gotta seek the truth, and by seeking the truth, I think it's also important to go back in time and make sure that we're reading real things and we're not reading what the internet gives us.

41:07.426 --> 41:09.648
Darn it, I gotta unplug for a second.

41:09.688 --> 41:15.033
This got all underneath my, all kinds of underneath my stool here.

41:15.053 --> 41:15.733
So we,

41:22.480 --> 41:29.542
I have been exploring the depths of eBay in a way that I never did before the pandemic.

41:29.622 --> 41:32.482
I love eBay now, and I have no stock in eBay.

41:32.522 --> 41:40.604
But I do, in a way, not want anyone else to use eBay, because there are lots of books on eBay that are really cheap, and I haven't bought them yet.

41:41.244 --> 41:42.945
So don't worry about eBay.

41:43.045 --> 41:43.645
eBay's dumb.

41:45.345 --> 41:50.269
But evolution, because DNA, can be dispelled in any number of ways.

41:50.349 --> 41:57.595
But the cardinal principle consequences of thinking this bad biology are, number one, the DNA equals genes.

41:57.675 --> 42:00.657
And genes is already an enchantment.

42:00.837 --> 42:13.508
It is a magic word that when you say it to people who don't understand it as an enchantment, it provokes a very safe, slave-speak thought.

42:14.670 --> 42:19.291
And it's a pretty complex one, but it's a very powerful slave-speak thought.

42:19.331 --> 42:26.233
When you say genes to your kids and the only thing that they have in their head is what they heard in school, it's a very dangerous word.

42:26.833 --> 42:31.034
Genes cause disease is also a consequence of that concept.

42:31.534 --> 42:37.336
And almost all the kids in high school biology would be able to explain to you what I mean when I say genes cause disease.

42:37.956 --> 42:50.067
And of course, Francis Collins made his fame by saying that he found a gene that was associated with a disease, a genetic disorder that is termed cystic fibrosis.

42:50.087 --> 42:53.770
So genes are the nature in nature versus nurture.

42:54.270 --> 43:04.199
And nature versus nurture is already a bit of a trap, but suffice it to say that nature versus nurture is a broad enough use of language

43:05.538 --> 43:34.976
so as to not be a closed trap and a useful thought to think about what you are born with versus what your experience and environment and trajectory across time, if you were to use my language, how those two things interplay to determine the individual that you observe in the trajectory across time, the pattern integrity that you observe in that trajectory across time.

43:36.075 --> 43:39.556
And so the nature versus nurture thing, genes are the nature.

43:39.596 --> 43:40.776
That's the whole idea.

43:40.816 --> 43:44.117
If we understand that, then we understand at least half of that equation.

43:44.617 --> 43:55.059
And since these people would argue that the start of the equation is the constant in the equation is the genes, then it's a pretty important thing in the equation, but is it a constant?

43:56.159 --> 43:57.039
That's the question.

43:57.379 --> 43:59.400
One of the many questions that one could ask.

43:59.480 --> 43:59.620
So,

44:01.297 --> 44:10.250
The reason why I tried to start here was because I want to read an article from Scientific American in July of the year 2000.

44:10.490 --> 44:13.955
It's a special report, The Human Genome Business.

44:15.989 --> 44:43.959
And I have contended, and I think it's largely due or thanks to influences by and a lot of information and knowledge that I gained from my friendship with and following of Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS, that I understand that a very likely broad explanation for the pandemic is an elaborate theater that has allowed the establishment of a remnant stream

44:44.910 --> 45:03.038
a medical sampling leftovers stream that would effectively allow the business of the Human Genome Project to get started, to get really going at a pace that reflects our ability to sequence and store the information.

45:03.820 --> 45:14.348
Because we haven't always been able to sequence a long, large DNA molecule and then assemble it or make large quantities of it and then sequence.

45:14.428 --> 45:18.531
These are all technologies that have taken time to develop.

45:19.775 --> 45:23.176
And in fact, that's a lot of what the Human Genome Project was about.

45:23.776 --> 45:27.337
Now, interestingly, I think it's cool to put this back into context.

45:27.357 --> 45:31.057
That's why I want to go back to the year 2000 and read this article.

45:31.997 --> 45:36.638
This is a Scientific American that I just took out of the wrapper, which is kind of cool.

45:37.539 --> 45:42.119
And yeah, let's just, what did I do with this?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.500
Did I make, yeah, that's what I did.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.100
So I'm going to shovel over here.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.421
So this is the, let me just,

45:51.195 --> 45:56.339
Let me just show you the... Oh, I shouldn't put the name there.

45:56.359 --> 45:59.201
I don't know who... That's not the guy that I bought it from.

45:59.261 --> 46:00.342
Apparently, that's where it's sent.

46:00.862 --> 46:01.763
Warrior, Alabama.

46:01.823 --> 46:04.105
Anyway, ancient civilizations.

46:04.185 --> 46:04.906
Where are they?

46:05.386 --> 46:07.688
The Deadly Lakes in Cameroon.

46:09.289 --> 46:11.371
The CERN Collider, which is interesting.

46:11.411 --> 46:13.412
And then now the Human Genome Project business.

46:13.452 --> 46:15.634
So, I just want to read the Human Genome Project business.

46:19.497 --> 46:20.878
Because I think it's quite interesting.

46:26.721 --> 46:32.666
So, I'm not really sure.

46:33.887 --> 46:35.649
Here's the human genome business today.

46:35.689 --> 46:36.710
Oh, I didn't read this part.

46:36.770 --> 46:37.050
Shoot.

46:37.531 --> 46:37.831
Okay.

46:37.891 --> 46:39.012
I didn't see this article.

46:39.052 --> 46:39.352
Darn it.

46:39.412 --> 46:40.693
I was going too fast here.

46:40.713 --> 46:41.995
I get a lot of stuff in the mail.

46:42.015 --> 46:44.557
Let me just scan this really quick here.

46:44.657 --> 46:46.899
This is layer two.

46:46.999 --> 46:48.600
By the time this, yes, that's right.

46:49.639 --> 46:51.500
Yeah, okay, so this is a lot of reading.

46:51.860 --> 46:53.061
I don't know if I'm gonna do that.

46:53.121 --> 46:53.681
I'm gonna do it.

46:53.961 --> 47:02.705
So by the time this magazine hits your mailbox, you'll be able to read the entire genetic code of a human being over the internet.

47:03.045 --> 47:05.386
It's not exactly light reading start to finish.

47:05.446 --> 47:12.349
It's nothing but letters A, T, C, and G repeated over and over in varying order, long enough to fill more than 200 telephone books.

47:13.270 --> 47:16.031
For biologists though, this code is a runaway bestseller.

47:17.145 --> 47:22.509
The letters stand for the DNA chemicals that make up all your genes, influencing the way you walk, talk, think, and sleep.

47:23.649 --> 47:32.595
We're talking about reading your own instruction book, Marvel's Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.

47:33.216 --> 47:34.677
What could be more compelling than that?

47:35.714 --> 47:41.940
So Francis Collins heads the Human Genome Project and so far a $250 million effort to write out a map of our genes.

47:42.441 --> 47:48.546
The Human Genome Project is a publicly funded consortium that includes four large sequencing centers in the U.S.

47:48.606 --> 47:53.651
as well as the Sanger Center near Cambridge, England, labs in Japan, France, Germany, and China.

47:53.691 --> 47:57.555
Sounds like a fairly substantial investment.

47:57.935 --> 47:58.156
Hmm.

48:02.254 --> 48:11.564
And working together for more than a decade, over 1100 scientists have crafted a map of 3 billion DNA base pairs or units that make up the human genome.

48:12.044 --> 48:18.691
And I've explained this before, it's essentially a restriction enzyme map where consensus

48:21.363 --> 48:30.646
segments of the chromosomes of humans have been identified among the limited sample of genomes that they have mapped in this way.

48:31.446 --> 48:42.970
And they have established some rudimentary landmarks around some commonly shared, let's say, already researched disorders.

48:43.070 --> 48:45.291
So that they have some kind of general map

48:46.323 --> 48:57.587
But it's nowhere what these guys are imagining, which is a phone book collection that is the base-by-base sequence of a particular, or of all, humans.

48:57.647 --> 49:00.608
Of course, it can't be all humans, so then what are they really talking about?

49:00.648 --> 49:02.709
And that's already, you can see, the nonsense here.

49:05.177 --> 49:06.058
And they are not alone.

49:06.118 --> 49:13.463
In April, a brash young company called Solara Genomics in Rockville, Maryland beat the public consortium to the punch announcing its own rough draft to the human genome.

49:13.524 --> 49:17.106
Rough draft is what I mean by a restriction enzyme map.

49:18.147 --> 49:29.515
So a restriction enzyme is the bacterial enzyme which will cut DNA at a particular sequence.

49:29.996 --> 49:32.358
And it usually ends up to be like some kind of, you know,

49:33.953 --> 49:59.262
weird weird combination of bases on the top and the bottom and then you're left with overhanging ends that kind of fit together like this and so if you cut two pieces of DNA with the same enzyme then they'll have ends that can come together and that's a it's the way that the bacterial genomes around us are rearranged all the time and we've taken these many different restriction enzymes and use them advantageously to

50:01.823 --> 50:14.089
find locations in the genome and so a a suitable a suitable

50:20.242 --> 50:40.958
Analogy for this would be, for example, to take a paper punch and go through this book, for example, and punch all of the pages where my last name is found and think about how that would express itself in this book.

50:41.974 --> 50:48.460
Now think about go to another book and do the same thing and look for the same word and you might not ever punch a page.

50:48.500 --> 50:53.184
Of course, none of these other books on this shelf you would punch a page.

50:53.244 --> 51:03.494
These are all the books about vaccination and virology and viruses since around 1988.

51:06.165 --> 51:13.611
And then I go all the way up till now all the sky horse books all the anti-vax books all the you know We said at first books.

51:13.671 --> 51:14.732
I got them all right there.

51:14.772 --> 51:17.595
This is not a Collection of I'm smart books.

51:17.635 --> 51:30.125
This is a collection of history books right here history as portrayed by the bound word and So the only book on that shelf that will have my last name in it is this one I

51:30.762 --> 51:42.071
But you could imagine a scenario where, let's say, take a different word, like spectacular, and now do a map of this book using the same hole punch, but now use the word spectacular.

51:42.611 --> 51:57.843
And now you can imagine a scenario where any book, for example, that was the same book as this one, like let's say, for example, you found another book on there, but that book didn't have the cover on it, you know?

51:58.905 --> 52:02.228
But you'd know immediately, oh yeah, look, these books aren't the same at all.

52:02.928 --> 52:04.149
These two books aren't the same.

52:04.569 --> 52:15.138
But if you started paging through them and you found out that on the same pages there was a hole punch for the word cooie, and it also worked for the word spectacular.

52:16.325 --> 52:22.651
then you could almost bet, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these two books are the same book.

52:22.751 --> 52:35.502
Because otherwise, the hole punches where Spectacular is, and the hole punches where Cooey is, would never have fallen on the same page, never even mined on the same part of the page.

52:37.878 --> 52:45.462
Now if you can do that mental exercise in your head, then you kind of understand how they do it with regard to mapping the human genome.

52:45.942 --> 52:54.486
Except they're using words like therefore, and purpose, and coordinated.

52:55.487 --> 52:58.808
And so in any book, there are going to be holes where that works.

52:59.028 --> 53:04.071
And as a result, you're going to have a lot of maps that don't really make a lot of sense.

53:06.271 --> 53:13.275
You're gonna have a lot of maps that don't really compare to each other, just for the simple fact that things aren't found in the same place, but might be able to do the same job.

53:13.755 --> 53:25.241
And so, it is a horribly limited place that these people have brought us to, as they try in 2002, or in the year 2000, to try and portray as something is done.

53:26.222 --> 53:27.122
But it's not done.

53:27.142 --> 53:31.545
They've barely been able to estimate the task at hand.

53:32.478 --> 53:50.022
Never mind building an infrastructure of computer software and computer storage that could store that data even over a longer term period of time so that when we have stored enough of it, this is a very confounding problem that they've been working on for decades that they're nowhere near solving.

53:51.305 --> 54:08.950
that the current iteration of requires the existence of a remnant stream of testing that they can produce more and more genomic data to feed into this existing network already not, it was not assembled for YouTube videos.

54:09.010 --> 54:17.493
I assure you they are not building servers on container ships to store data for YouTube videos.

54:21.772 --> 54:26.755
And so for a long time, there was a big misconception that with the DNA sequence was done, that we'd have total enlightenment.

54:30.017 --> 54:30.277
That's it.

54:30.317 --> 54:32.778
Maybe I should just make sure I read that bottom.

54:32.798 --> 54:36.520
A young brash beat the public consortium to the punch announcing its own genome.

54:36.540 --> 54:41.723
The rivalry has cast spotlight on the human genome, genetic code, and what exactly researchers now plan to do with it.

54:42.484 --> 54:48.907
For a long time, there was a big misconception that the DNA sequencing was done, that we'd have total enlightenment.

54:49.908 --> 54:49.968
Uh,

54:50.743 --> 54:54.746
about who we were and why we get sick and why we are old.

54:55.687 --> 55:00.751
Remarks geneticist Richard Wilson of Washington University, one partner in the public consortium.

55:00.791 --> 55:01.912
I can't do this with my finger.

55:01.952 --> 55:03.113
That's annoying me.

55:03.653 --> 55:05.154
Maybe I can use this little ruler.

55:06.335 --> 55:09.197
Because I don't think my mouse will show up on that.

55:10.198 --> 55:11.459
If you, yeah, you won't see it.

55:11.559 --> 55:12.059
I will see it.

55:14.804 --> 55:17.005
But total enlightenment is decades away.

55:17.045 --> 55:20.905
So now we're talking like Kurzweiler here, but then, you know, it's over the hill.

55:20.965 --> 55:21.866
It's just over the hill.

55:22.546 --> 55:26.047
But scientists can now imagine that day, what that day looks like.

55:26.127 --> 55:31.628
Drug companies, for instance, are collecting the genetic know-how to make medicines tailored to specific genes.

55:32.548 --> 55:33.928
Sounds like personalized medicine.

55:34.268 --> 55:36.249
An effort called pharmacogenomics.

55:37.168 --> 55:47.294
In the years to come, your pharmacist may hand you one version of a blood pressure drug based on your unique genetic profile, while the guy in line behind you gets a different version of the same medicine.

55:47.334 --> 55:55.418
Boy, that sounds an awful lot like what Kevin McKernan and Francis Collins and Tony Fauci have been talking about for decades already.

55:57.031 --> 56:08.956
sounds an awful lot like very similar to what James Lyons Wyler, the author of the Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism would say about vaccines.

56:11.637 --> 56:22.382
That we might just need vaccines for different genetic backgrounds and that we might have to make special vaccines for people with particular genetic vulnerabilities.

56:23.575 --> 56:29.301
But for sure we're going to have to start testing everybody's genetic background if we're going to make safe vaccines.

56:31.404 --> 56:34.287
It is remarkable where we are.

56:38.001 --> 56:47.772
Other companies are already cranking out blood tests that reveal telltale disease gene mutations and forecast your chance of coming down with conditions such as Huntington's disease.

56:49.174 --> 56:56.362
Oh, and some scientists still hold out hope for gene therapy directly adding healthy genes to a patient's body.

57:01.189 --> 57:02.470
That's pretty extraordinary.

57:02.610 --> 57:12.356
Knowing the genome will change the way drug trials are done and kick off a whole new era of individualized medicine, predicts Craig Ventner, president of Celera.

57:12.416 --> 57:16.758
Now you can find a lot of information on Celera on Heucytonics website.

57:17.239 --> 57:24.363
If you go to the research page, then you go to the C's and then you scroll down past all the people, you'll find a link for Celera.

57:24.723 --> 57:30.747
And you can find one of the interesting things I found on that website was that it was bought by Quest Diagnostics.

57:32.622 --> 57:37.864
Quest Diagnostics controls an awful lot of medical remnants in America.

57:39.945 --> 57:55.931
And all of those medical remnants could, in theory, be feeding into the infrastructure of Celera to do restriction enzyme mapping and targeted gene hunts and whatever other things they want to do.

57:57.332 --> 57:59.533
Full genome sequencing and storage of the data.

57:59.573 --> 58:00.053
Who knows?

58:01.533 --> 58:13.435
Because the remnant streams are, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about them, nobody's talking about them, even though the remnant stream that now exists from PCR testing is heretofore never existed.

58:17.296 --> 58:29.759
And in a country where they still circumcise tiny babies for fibroblasts, and they still sell cesarean section placentas at a much higher

58:30.885 --> 58:31.325
Price.

58:32.887 --> 58:55.968
There's no question that the remnant stream of the COVID-19 testing is not by accident the perfect, the perfect sampling device, the perfect sampling infrastructure for a population-wide genetic experiment.

58:56.775 --> 59:04.021
And I don't mean expressing genes in people, although I think that's what they did when they used hot batches of the transfection or transformation.

59:04.681 --> 59:06.383
I mean collecting data from people.

59:06.963 --> 59:14.129
You know, like a strike force that comes in in the middle of the night and starts collecting data, like the lady said on 60 Minutes yesterday.

59:17.935 --> 59:21.499
And even with the human code in hand, however, the genomic industry faces challenges.

59:21.560 --> 59:22.321
Some are technical.

59:22.381 --> 59:24.183
It's one thing to know a gene's chemical structure.

59:24.203 --> 59:26.707
For instance, quite another to understand its actual function.

59:26.727 --> 59:27.848
Other challenges are legal.

59:27.888 --> 59:31.713
How much must you know about a gene in order to patent it?

59:31.773 --> 59:32.314
And finally,

59:34.440 --> 59:36.601
And finally, many dilemmas are social.

59:36.641 --> 59:42.785
Do you really want to be diagnosed with a disease that can't be treated or won't affect you for another 20 years?

59:43.226 --> 59:50.110
As scientists begin to unravel the genome, the endeavor may come to seem increasingly, well, human.

59:52.631 --> 59:53.711
So the race, right?

59:53.751 --> 59:55.011
This was all about the race.

59:55.091 --> 01:00:06.433
And that was one of the main propaganda motivating narratives before the human genome was declared, sort of completed, was this idea that we were racing.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:21.316
And I don't think that, I think rather that this has a very apt place in your understanding of the coronavirus pandemic, because I believe behind the scenes, there was an awful lot of talk

01:00:22.608 --> 01:00:44.603
You can think of Giordano here if you want to, but I'm sure there are other people who can present like him, where there's a lot of talk about what the Chinese with their different cultural, moral standards is going to get ahead of us because they're not afraid.

01:00:45.764 --> 01:00:48.326
They're gonna get ahead of us because they're willing to do

01:00:49.574 --> 01:00:51.336
experiments that we're not willing to do.

01:00:51.736 --> 01:00:53.618
And in fact, I heard a lot about this.

01:00:54.419 --> 01:01:06.970
One of the most famous primate researchers in Germany before the pandemic moved to China because he was just having so much trouble with animal rights activists in Germany.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.813
And it was so controversial that he couldn't do his research anymore.

01:01:09.853 --> 01:01:12.035
So he said, screw it, I'm moving to China.

01:01:13.697 --> 01:01:15.298
And so this narrative is real.

01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:22.080
It's been ongoing for a while that they might get ahead of us because they are willing to let scientists do lots of things.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.002
You know, the cloning thing, the sheep thing that wasn't also by accident.

01:01:26.022 --> 01:01:40.468
That was a real part of this narrative because behind the scenes, they were telling bureaucrats with the requisite knowledge to understand that this meant that the Chinese were going to get way ahead of us in specifically the theater of biological weapons.

01:01:42.128 --> 01:01:56.158
with the added advantage that they could make a biological weapon which they would be less vulnerable to because they are genetically more homogenous than our multicultural population, our multicultural armed forces.

01:01:56.618 --> 01:01:58.720
It's a very easy story to hear.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:08.107
And to hear someone like Robert Malone or Giordano tell that story behind closed doors, it's not even, it takes no imagination at all.

01:02:11.445 --> 01:02:16.372
And so this imperative to talk about the DMED data and whether or not they're blah, blah, blah.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:24.063
And they've been using the military as test subjects for, for years already to focus on the COVID shot is ridiculous.

01:02:25.885 --> 01:02:29.327
And this is, of course, meant no disrespect to our servicemen.

01:02:29.367 --> 01:02:48.216
It is to try to make them aware that irrespective of whether they see themselves as experimental animals for the COVID shot, I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that most of them have given many other experimental vaccines that heretofore they are not really thinking about as also having had impact on their lives, but most assuredly they did.

01:02:54.614 --> 01:03:02.163
So the all I's are on the first finish line of the genome, roughly a rough draft sequence of the 100,000 or so genes inside all of us.

01:03:02.204 --> 01:03:02.764
So here we go.

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:06.709
Here's where the genes is already using small letters, like you already know what that means.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:12.737
The human genome as a project approach has been described as painstaking and precise.

01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:22.498
Beginning with blood and sperm cells, the team separated out the 23 pairs of chromosomes that hold human genes.

01:03:23.138 --> 01:03:34.444
Scientists then clipped bits of DNA from every chromosome, identifying the sequence of DNA bases in each bit, and finally matched each snippet up to the DNA on either side of it in the chromosome.

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:43.940
And on they went, gradually crafting the sequence for individual gene segments, complete genes, whole chromosomes, and even eventually the entire genome.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:52.244
Wilson compares this approach to taking out one page of an encyclopedia at a time and ripping it up and putting it together again.

01:03:52.264 --> 01:03:54.485
I'm sure it's a real accurate process.

01:03:54.946 --> 01:03:59.208
In contrast, Celera took a shorter route, shredding the encyclopedia all at once.

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:09.582
Solaris' so-called shotgun sequencing strategy tears all the genes into fragments simultaneously and then relies on computers to build the fragments into a whole genome.

01:04:12.762 --> 01:04:20.268
The emphasis is on computer power, using algorithms to sequence the data, not that dissimilar to what Joshua Lederberg imagined many years ago.

01:04:20.788 --> 01:04:24.371
Hence says J. Paul Gilman, Celera's Director of Policy Planning.

01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:28.054
The advantage is efficiency and speed.

01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:34.199
So it's kind of like, you know, who can get the footage of the moon together first and show it on TV?

01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:40.264
The Human Genome Project and Celera teams disagree over what makes a finished genome.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:41.745
Oh boy, here we go.

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:52.692
This spring, Celera announced that it had finished sequencing the rough draft of the genome with one anonymous person and that it would sort the data into a map in just six weeks.

01:04:52.832 --> 01:05:03.475
But the public team immediately cried foul as Collins noted that Celera fell short of its original genome sequencing goals.

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:08.456
In 1998, when the company began, Celera scientists planned to sequence the full genome of several people

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:13.579
checking its consensus genome 10 times over.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:27.409
So they're calling each other out on what they said they were going to do and what you need to understand is this idea of sequencing several people and checking the consensus is one of the things that absolutely failed.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:37.557
Now I don't know how the details of that but rest assured that although we seem to all have a very similar pattern of chromosomes

01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:39.424
The

01:05:41.513 --> 01:05:49.377
homology across genomes is something that they don't understand and have not been able to adequately sample.

01:05:49.417 --> 01:06:11.088
It's one of the reasons why we need to get into all of this because my multiracial background, having a Filipino Indian mom and some kind of Norwegian Dutch dad, French, whatever he is from Wisconsin, that's created a human genome that has never existed before and has very little homology to either of the

01:06:11.828 --> 01:06:15.111
the ancestral lines that it descends from.

01:06:16.232 --> 01:06:21.796
Not the least of which being that both my mother and father are significantly mixed background already.

01:06:24.078 --> 01:06:36.028
And so we are being absolutely fooled into believing that our data is worth nothing when in fact my data is as valuable as any other genome that exists and they need them all.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:51.711
Because the AI needs as many examples of the human genome as it can get so that some pattern, despite the variation that's present, some patterns can be found.

01:06:51.751 --> 01:06:53.432
And yes, they have made progress.

01:06:55.672 --> 01:07:05.974
But they still have no idea how the trajectory across time is encoded, if it is encoded at all, in this protein digest.

01:07:07.162 --> 01:07:20.815
this list of ingredients that they seem to have found and are insisting are genes and not just a list of ingredients with no descriptive recipe with no

01:07:23.191 --> 01:07:26.673
three panel diagram, you know, what do they call that?

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:29.955
Three, the thing you did, we drew in drafting class.

01:07:30.035 --> 01:07:32.957
I mean, come on guys, this has gotta be obvious now.

01:07:33.037 --> 01:07:47.566
They have not made much progress in the 25 years other than making sequencing in theory cheaper and two, making the data easier to store.

01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:49.167
That's it.

01:07:50.094 --> 01:08:19.013
Progress and understanding is almost nil and once you understand that then when we read as we read this it will become obvious what really happened during the pandemic is a conversion of Many populations on earth into full-blown experimental animals not that dissimilar to what was done in Israel with the shot but on a global scale and into the future extended now this system exists and they're only gonna add on to it now and

01:08:21.994 --> 01:08:23.995
The emphasis is on computer power, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:25.056
The advantages, efficiencies.

01:08:25.156 --> 01:08:28.638
The Human Genome Project and Celera disagree 10 times over.

01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:29.299
Yes, that's right.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:37.124
Celera declared that its rough genome sequencing was complete with just one person's genome sequenced only three times.

01:08:37.184 --> 01:08:38.565
So that's crazy, right?

01:08:39.186 --> 01:08:44.469
They're talking about checking the consensus genome 10 times over.

01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:45.210
Because why?

01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:49.693
Because when you re-sequence it, there are gonna be differences because it's just a model.

01:08:49.853 --> 01:08:51.594
It's just a probabilistic model.

01:08:54.491 --> 01:08:58.415
And so when do you declare the genome project done?

01:08:58.475 --> 01:09:06.242
When they could take a picture from above and show Kevin McKernan with all these gels and this little assembly line, then it's done?

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:09.285
Or when they've sequenced 10 people?

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.768
Or when they sequence 10 people 10 times?

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.512
Well, why would that even be a...

01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:24.474
an issue unless the whole concept of the finish line was never being reached by any of these landmarks.

01:09:24.654 --> 01:09:27.775
And then, then you understand it.

01:09:29.656 --> 01:09:40.679
So although many news accounts have characterized the Human Genome Project and Celera as competing in a race, the company has a decided advantage because the Human Genome Project is a public project.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:44.780
The team routinely dumps all its genome data into the gene bank

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.522
a public database available through the internet.

01:09:47.542 --> 01:09:54.549
And like everyone else, Celera has used that data in its case to help check and fill the gaps in the company's rough draft genome.

01:09:55.009 --> 01:10:00.474
Essentially, Celera has used the public genome data to stay one step ahead of the sequencing effort.

01:10:01.215 --> 01:10:04.438
It does stick in one's craw a bit," Wilson remarks.

01:10:04.538 --> 01:10:09.382
But Gilman asserts that Solera's revised plan simply makes good business sense.

01:10:09.962 --> 01:10:13.025
The point is not to sit around and sequence for the rest of our lives.

01:10:13.886 --> 01:10:17.008
So, but that's exactly what they have to do.

01:10:17.809 --> 01:10:21.832
They will have to sequence for the rest of their lives, every one possible.

01:10:22.893 --> 01:10:24.395
So the faster it is, the better.

01:10:24.855 --> 01:10:26.036
The cheaper it is, the better.

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:29.479
The less replicates they have to do, the better.

01:10:31.175 --> 01:10:36.859
And so that's what this technology advance has been about for the last 25 years since this was published, nothing else.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:48.668
So yes, we'll use our threefold coverage to order the public data and that will give us what we believe to be a very accurate picture of the human genome.

01:10:49.449 --> 01:10:55.934
In early May, the Human Genome Project announced that it had completed its own working draft as well as finished sequence

01:10:57.757 --> 01:11:03.241
a finished sequence for chromosome 21, which is involved in Down syndrome and many other diseases.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:07.545
So think about what that statement says, because it doesn't say they're done.

01:11:08.145 --> 01:11:16.051
It says that they have a well-finished draft of the whole sequence, and they have a finished sequence for one chromosome.

01:11:17.192 --> 01:11:21.976
Jeez, it's so unclear exactly what they've accomplished.

01:11:23.419 --> 01:11:27.961
Until now, the genome generators have focused on similarities among us all.

01:11:28.041 --> 01:11:34.064
Scientists think that 99% of your genes perfectly match those of the person sitting beside you.

01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:43.509
But the remaining 0.1% of your genes vary, and it is these variations that most interest drug companies.

01:11:43.589 --> 01:11:48.071
Now, we're not talking at all about the difference in our microbiome.

01:11:51.664 --> 01:12:00.127
We're not talking at all about how our immune system might be predisposed to having a different microbiome than someone else.

01:12:02.168 --> 01:12:06.930
None of this is on the radar yet, even though already in this time, they know it's important.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:15.813
Already at this time, the entire Human Genome Project and all of its technology would not exist without bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:12:15.973 --> 01:12:18.074
Bacteria are doing the work here.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:35.731
And so even a simple nucleotide polymorphism in one of your gene sequences where your neighbor has a C can spell trouble.

01:12:35.771 --> 01:12:36.572
That's the problem.

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:48.563
It can even code for the same amino acid and still be the only genetic signal they have, which indicates the difference between this person who has a healthy phenotype and this person who has a catastrophic genetic disorder.

01:12:50.609 --> 01:12:52.050
The silent mutations.

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:54.311
They have no idea how that works.

01:12:55.092 --> 01:13:00.615
And of course, the reason why or why that works is because they have no idea what this code actually encodes.

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:07.420
They have been able to discern that proteins can be seen to be encoded in these nucleic acids, but that's it.

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.562
It doesn't mean that they can, they've cracked the code.

01:13:16.257 --> 01:13:17.958
And that's really the trick here.

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:32.305
They start by announcing, and Francis Collins even made fun of himself in a video I watched a year or two ago, because they've had so many celebrations about the Human Genome Project and its accomplishments, he's not even really sure what they accomplished anymore.

01:13:36.527 --> 01:13:40.349
So, let's go on here and see where we go.

01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:51.072
So, two genome sequencing strategies here, Celera Genomics versus, this is nested shotgun, this is the whole shotgun.

01:13:51.172 --> 01:13:52.953
So, either way, what are we doing here?

01:13:53.033 --> 01:13:53.394
Wow.

01:13:59.677 --> 01:14:06.261
So, you would hope, right, that these would have overlap and so you would, you know, this sentence matches that sentence and everything's going to be fine.

01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:10.383
And it's nice that they can draw these pictures, but it really, really does not.

01:14:12.443 --> 01:14:19.966
It does not reveal the amount of work that is being done by algorithmic assembly.

01:14:21.586 --> 01:14:23.847
What other genomes are they sequencing here?

01:14:23.887 --> 01:14:29.769
They talk about yeast and the fruit fly and the mouse and the worm.

01:14:31.589 --> 01:14:32.570
The major players.

01:14:33.726 --> 01:14:43.910
Celera Genomics, Human Genome Sciences by William Hastine, Insight Genomics with Roy Whitfield.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:51.173
I haven't checked any of these as to whether they also have their, maybe Mark has already worked on these.

01:14:51.193 --> 01:14:51.533
I don't know.

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:54.735
Here's the Human Genome Project with Francis Collins.

01:14:54.795 --> 01:15:01.878
And you will know that the Whitehead Institute is where the Research and Development Director,

01:15:03.482 --> 01:15:08.486
Kevin McKernan worked under Mark Lander and Millennium Pharmaceuticals.

01:15:08.506 --> 01:15:11.288
Yeah, anyway.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:33.283
patents have already uh testing testing testing wow look at this one i'm just gonna skip a little bit here patents have already led to more than seven and this is might be the second or is this still the same no this is the patents have already led to more than 740 genetic tests that are on the market or being developed according to the nih great

01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:37.449
These tests, however, show how far genetics has to go.

01:15:37.589 --> 01:15:48.704
Several years after the debut of the tests for BRCA and BRCA2, for instance, scientists are still trying to determine exactly to what degree those genes contribute to a woman's cancer risk.

01:15:52.304 --> 01:15:56.346
But it sure generated a lot of interest in genes, didn't it?

01:15:56.406 --> 01:16:02.509
It still perpetuated the mythology that we can learn something and predict something by the presence of a gene.

01:16:02.929 --> 01:16:15.995
And that mythology is still central to the bad biology that the NIH work is largely based on and that billions of dollars are spent on, that people write books about the genetic causes of autism and get paid money to do it.

01:16:21.395 --> 01:16:29.960
And even in the most informative, genetic tests leave plenty of questions suggest Wendy R. Ullman, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.621
In the case of Huntington's disease, we've got a terrific test.

01:16:33.342 --> 01:16:40.385
We know precisely how the gene changes, but we can't tell you the age which your symptoms will start, the severity of your disease, or how it will progress.

01:16:41.186 --> 01:16:43.747
Social issues can get in the way too.

01:16:44.247 --> 01:16:45.548
After Kelly West falls,

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:50.135
A mother pad tested positive for Huntington's disease.

01:16:50.215 --> 01:16:53.618
Westfall, age 30, immediately knew she would take the test as well.

01:16:54.379 --> 01:17:00.323
I had made up my mind that if I had Huntington's, not Huntington's, if you had the gene, I didn't want to have kids.

01:17:00.623 --> 01:17:04.887
Whoa, declares Westfall, lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

01:17:05.347 --> 01:17:08.389
But one fear made her hesitate, genetic discrimination.

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:16.173
Westfall felt confident enough to approach her boss, who reassured her that her job was still safe.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.495
Still, she worried about her insurance.

01:17:19.575 --> 01:17:27.279
Finally, rather than inform her insurance about the test, Westall paid for it, some $450, including counseling out of pocket.

01:17:27.359 --> 01:17:28.860
To her relief, she tested negative.

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:37.661
The Human Genome Project's Collins is among those calling for legislation to protect people like Westfall.

01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:41.682
So there, he's already working on legal issues, right?

01:17:41.702 --> 01:17:43.222
Holy balls.

01:17:43.582 --> 01:17:54.105
A patchwork of federal and state laws are already in place to ban genetic discrimination by insurers or employers, but privacy advocates are lobbying Congress to pass a more comprehensive law.

01:17:55.165 --> 01:17:56.226
Where did my little ruler go?

01:17:56.246 --> 01:17:56.286
Oh.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:08.637
Last February, President Clinton signed an executive order prohibiting all federal employees from hiring, promoting, or firing employees based on genetic information.

01:18:09.717 --> 01:18:12.740
It remains to be seen whether private companies will follow suit.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:20.466
In the meantime, Solera is now ready to hawk its human genome, complete with crib notes on all the genes, to online subscribers worldwide.

01:18:20.906 --> 01:18:23.949
It's not owning the data, it's what you do with it, Ventnor remarks.

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:32.416
He envisions Solera's database akin to the Bloomberg Financial Database or LexisNexis News Archives only for the genetics set.

01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:35.859
Which 300 genes are associated with hypertension?

01:18:35.939 --> 01:18:37.780
What exactly does each gene do?

01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:43.465
These are the kinds of queries Solera subscribers might pose for a price.

01:18:45.146 --> 01:18:50.431
What 300 genes are associated with hypertension?

01:18:54.369 --> 01:19:08.539
As a press of time, Solera planned to offer a free peek at the raw genome data online, but tapping into the community's online toolkit and full gene notes will cost corporate subscribers an estimated $5 million to $15 million a year, according to Gilman.

01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:13.662
Academic labs will pay a discounted rate of $10,000 to $15,000 a year.

01:19:14.062 --> 01:19:16.424
Internet servers can now visit GeneBank for free.

01:19:16.824 --> 01:19:20.306
With all this information available, will scientists really pay Celera?

01:19:20.366 --> 01:19:21.146
Venter thinks so.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.548
We just have to have better tools, he says.

01:19:23.608 --> 01:19:26.069
For genomics, that's becoming familiar terrain.

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:31.492
Maybe you should see if Palantir can help him with those special tools.

01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:34.734
Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen, what can I say about this?

01:19:34.794 --> 01:19:36.375
What is there to say about this?

01:19:37.155 --> 01:19:38.036
I'm not really sure.

01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:41.475
I do know that we can think our way out of it, though.

01:19:41.515 --> 01:19:46.138
We've just got to read the right books, and we've got to stop listening to the wrong people.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:55.805
There was an expected rise in... The world's population may have recently exceeded 8 billion, but it's a deceptive number.

01:19:56.486 --> 01:20:01.950
Not only is growth unevenly distributed, but in so many countries, population is in decline.

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:04.292
In some cases, steep, deep decline.

01:20:05.072 --> 01:20:20.536
Maybe most graphically and demographically, there's Japan, a country that since hitting a high of 128 million citizens in 2008 has lost population for 15 years running and is on pace to shrink by half by this century's end.

01:20:20.756 --> 01:20:22.497
So what's going to happen to schools?

01:20:22.997 --> 01:20:24.517
What will happen to universities?

01:20:24.557 --> 01:20:26.137
What will happen to infrastructures?

01:20:28.098 --> 01:20:31.919
If that happens, what if that's happening all around the world?

01:20:33.319 --> 01:20:47.245
Well, first of all, I can tell you if that's happening all around the world, then it would have started with an expected rise in all cause mortality because you would have an excess of old people from a time when families were more successful and productive.

01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:55.309
Because apparently if there is a decline in population, then families have become less productive.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:21:01.465
And so preceding that will be an expected rise in all cause mortality.

01:21:01.505 --> 01:21:12.781
And I am suggesting to you that around the developed world, there was an anticipated rise in inspected deaths that could be sculpted using a little murder and a lot of sophisticated lying.

01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:33.097
lying about PCR, lying about testing, lying about the sequence of a novel virus, which is really just the distortion of an irreducibly complex background of DNA and RNA, mostly produced by the bacteria in which we are symbiotic or competitively in a relationship with.

01:21:34.266 --> 01:21:45.172
And they did that to create the myth of an RNA pandemic that they can recycle as often as they want to, whether they call it flu or coronavirus or norovirus or, or, or anything else.

01:21:48.113 --> 01:21:55.857
Now, the magnificent thing is, is that this is also 60 minutes from very, very recently, also telling us about how Japan's population is about to collapse.

01:21:56.377 --> 01:22:03.281
But what's curious about that is that their 60 minutes extra was actually about the United States.

01:22:08.355 --> 01:22:09.346
60 minutes overtime.

01:22:13.769 --> 01:22:24.876
Our story this week on 60 Minutes is about Japan, the incredible shrinking country that is losing population at an alarming rate, some of which is for reasons specific to Japan.

01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:27.838
In other ways, this is a real sort of canary in the coal mine.

01:22:27.858 --> 01:22:35.262
This is a real barometer of what a number of countries, the United States included, is going to confront in terms of demographics.

01:22:35.422 --> 01:22:37.284
The United States included?

01:22:37.304 --> 01:22:42.647
I wonder if China has this problem due to a 20-year one-child policy.

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:57.103
I hope that you can see that this population is not a problem if you have effectively reduced the function of, reduced the resiliency of, and reduced the productivity of the family.

01:22:59.345 --> 01:23:01.768
If you've gotten young people to decide not to have kids.

01:23:04.116 --> 01:23:11.001
if you've put enough economic pressure on people so that they don't have a replacement number of kids, then you've already solved the problem.

01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:13.643
You just have to be on a long enough time horizon.

01:23:14.243 --> 01:23:18.306
You have to be thinking and governing on a long enough time horizon.

01:23:18.406 --> 01:23:31.435
Now, combine that very, very clever governance with the impetus to collect as many human genomes as possible while they are available over the next 50 years or so.

01:23:34.011 --> 01:23:37.792
With the idea, again, that you're thinking on a longer time horizon.

01:23:40.233 --> 01:23:45.074
In some way or another, planting trees under whose shade you will never shelter.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.435
But in a malevolent sense.

01:23:48.615 --> 01:23:55.717
Planting seeds of fascism and technocracy under whose slavery you will never suffer.

01:23:56.918 --> 01:23:58.398
That's what all these people are doing.

01:23:59.938 --> 01:24:17.912
And whether he knows it or not, he is an announcer of what has been an orchestrated setup of humanity to make it as productive as possible, to get as much varied data as possible, to assemble data sets that will never be available again.

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:29.201
And all of these people understand it is a national security priority to collect as much as possible because the Chinese are doing it, the Russians are doing it, and the Indians are doing it.

01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:35.544
And they're also a valuable resource that if they're not doing it, we should do it.

01:24:37.785 --> 01:24:45.590
America may already be doing it in other countries in cooperation with their governments on purpose to get the data as part of a collective.

01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:47.011
I don't know.

01:24:47.871 --> 01:24:53.214
I do know that whatever's happening is not what's on TV and certainly not what's on social media.

01:24:54.475 --> 01:24:59.378
In fact, it's closer to what's on 60 Minutes, I would argue, than on anything in social media.

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.030
in the next decades and even centuries.

01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:07.395
Like Japan and many other countries, the United States is facing a low birth rate.

01:25:08.035 --> 01:25:09.116
On Wednesday, the U.S.

01:25:09.177 --> 01:25:13.641
announced a total fertility rate of 1.6 children per woman in the U.S.

01:25:14.462 --> 01:25:24.391
That's less than a 1 percent increase from 2023, a year that's on historic low and still well below the rate of 2.1 births needed to maintain a population.

01:25:25.586 --> 01:25:33.096
Americans are having less babies and they are delaying having baby to later on in life.

01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:40.665
We spoke with Dr. Thuy Ngo, the chair of Columbia University's Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health.

01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:44.700
He told us there are a few things that can explain this decline.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:54.367
The big data story from the CDC data is that women under the age of 30 are having less babies.

01:25:54.907 --> 01:26:04.234
There's a society-wide shift on how people value family, work, and personal fulfillment moving forward.

01:26:04.514 --> 01:26:10.088
And I don't think people are not having family because they don't value family.

01:26:10.389 --> 01:26:12.815
I think they are trying to navigate.

01:26:13.396 --> 01:26:17.918
the dynamic environment for couples who are wanting babies.

01:26:18.518 --> 01:26:21.600
Housing is extremely unaffordable.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.561
Childcare is patchy or unaffordable.

01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:26.322
So 60 Minutes is announcing it.

01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:31.004
60 Minutes is announcing it with people with bad accents about what is coming.

01:26:31.124 --> 01:26:38.348
And what is coming is a change in our population, which will change the socioeconomic landscape of our country.

01:26:39.108 --> 01:26:43.332
As we run out of children, we have too many schools.

01:26:44.113 --> 01:26:47.596
We have too many elementary schools in most places in America right now.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:49.197
What's going to happen to those jobs?

01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:51.299
What's going to happen to those people?

01:26:52.322 --> 01:26:55.806
going to become useless earlier than we ever thought.

01:26:56.487 --> 01:27:05.457
And that means that the number of consumers that are buying all of those goods that high school kids and college kids buy, all of that consumption is going to go down.

01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:08.961
All of those football tickets are going to stop being valuable.

01:27:09.121 --> 01:27:09.621
All of those

01:27:10.202 --> 01:27:11.663
You see where this is going?

01:27:12.064 --> 01:27:17.969
So the idea that the NIH is not funding universities anymore, there's going to be not enough grad students, is ridiculous.

01:27:18.049 --> 01:27:24.354
It's exactly timed perfectly for a precipitous decline in the people enrolling.

01:27:25.856 --> 01:27:27.957
But they're making a different theater out of it.

01:27:28.908 --> 01:27:33.873
just the same way they made a different theater out of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

01:27:33.913 --> 01:27:51.452
Do not resuscitate orders, lack of antibiotic use, supplementary oxygen, ventilators, poor use of steroids, remdesivir, midazolam, the opioid crisis, death certificate fraud, financial incentives, track and trace masks, closure, and mandates, plus PCR fraud, lateral flow test fraud, and sequencing of whole virus fraud.

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:58.055
They misconstrued all this stuff as, wow, man, we really responded badly to this mystery virus.

01:27:58.135 --> 01:28:04.843
Now they are going to continue to use social media to distort reality so that we don't understand it.

01:28:04.883 --> 01:28:08.788
And the way they're doing it now is reinforcing this bad biology.

01:28:11.428 --> 01:28:22.635
by pretending that they didn't know that this was a problem before the pandemic and that the pandemic wasn't actually a using of that, which it definitely, definitely was.

01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:36.385
They used and anticipated rise in all cause mortality due to the shape of the population pyramid that they're happy to cover on 60 Minutes now, but never would tell you that that was the perfect opportunity.

01:28:36.485 --> 01:28:38.426
In fact, it was actually

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:54.980
a financial danger because if we spared no expense in keeping this abundance of old people alive for as long as we possibly could, many of the healthcare systems in the West would go bankrupt over the next five to 10 years.

01:28:56.561 --> 01:29:05.663
We don't have the resources, we don't have the hospital beds to keep all of these people alive and spend infinite amount of money on them.

01:29:05.883 --> 01:29:11.284
Medicare, in the last six months of a Medicare patient's life is about a half a million dollars.

01:29:11.324 --> 01:29:25.728
That's a lot of money to be saved and turned around into $35,000 if we could put them on a supplementary oxygen, not give them antibiotics for the pneumonia that we knew they would develop, and then characterize them as a COVID pandemic

01:29:26.707 --> 01:29:36.969
death for $35,000 as opposed to keeping them alive for the last six months of their life in a hospital for whatever it is that they might die of in that scenario.

01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:43.731
Of course, there are two main signals that they talk about with regard to the pandemic.

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:48.172
First is the number of COVID deaths, which is just a lie.

01:29:49.056 --> 01:29:59.939
But more importantly, what they talk about is a drop in life expectancy, which is not been seen since the 1918 flu.

01:30:00.559 --> 01:30:13.863
And that lie is only possible because all of these people that have any coverage at all are not speaking of the opioid epidemic and how that specifically is the number one killer of people under 40.

01:30:13.943 --> 01:30:17.624
And that's the reason why life expectancy has dropped in America.

01:30:18.877 --> 01:30:30.848
If life expectancy drops in America now as a result of the uptake of transfection and the repeated application of live doses of transfection, that is a compounding factor for sure.

01:30:32.349 --> 01:30:33.971
Make no mistake about it.

01:30:34.731 --> 01:30:45.121
There was an opportunity here and it didn't require much of this in order to get these little peaks that everybody could point at and say that the house is on fire.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:50.633
when in reality it was just an anticipated opportunity to create this mess.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:56.517
And it was a national security priority to create this mess.

01:30:56.577 --> 01:31:00.140
That's why they put people in place to complain about mandates.

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:13.830
That's why a guy like Larry Cook would interfere with Brandy Vaughn's work to the extent to which he started and maintains a, a anti fake anti-vaccine website called stop the mandates.

01:31:16.325 --> 01:31:18.401
Vaccines are a mythology.

01:31:19.693 --> 01:31:26.858
So arguing about which ones work or arguing about which parts of them were tested is slave speak.

01:31:26.938 --> 01:31:27.899
It's part of the trap.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.301
Autism is a mythology.

01:31:30.841 --> 01:31:48.614
It is a spectrum of disorders that is designed to get people to endlessly argue about the infinite possible causes and never come to the useful conclusion that it's just, you know, repeated intermuscular injection can really mess a person up.

01:31:50.049 --> 01:32:01.214
Gain of function is also a mythology that is used to cover up the fact that all they can do is make a lot of pure DNA and put it in places and it does have biological effects when you do that.

01:32:01.954 --> 01:32:13.019
They can make a lot of less than pure RNA and they can put it in places and it will have biological effects that include the expression of or the production of protein at that place.

01:32:15.802 --> 01:32:17.644
And AI is a mythology.

01:32:17.724 --> 01:32:19.205
This is just machine learning.

01:32:19.245 --> 01:32:20.566
This is just brute force.

01:32:21.266 --> 01:32:35.718
And because language is a bit of an illusion that people themselves don't understand, that language, if someone is very skilled as a liar, then you're going to have a hard time seeing through it.

01:32:36.979 --> 01:32:38.560
And that is just language.

01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:40.442
That is just emotion.

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.125
And those aren't really big tricks.

01:32:46.715 --> 01:32:52.197
That's actually the power of language and why certain people are so effective with it.

01:32:53.158 --> 01:33:10.425
And so they're using that weakness in our own cognition to fool us into believing that there's some artificial intelligence that's about to wake up and walk away, when it's really just our own built-in vulnerability to language, to what language is for us.

01:33:11.738 --> 01:33:23.569
And especially what are now very limited or watered down, hampered, ruined language of American English and worldwide English is, if it's not used correctly.

01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:26.091
Slave speak is English.

01:33:26.691 --> 01:33:36.100
And if you're not very good at speaking precisely using the most precise English words available, then you're probably speaking slave speak without even knowing it.

01:33:37.506 --> 01:33:41.749
And so virology is just applications using that synthetic DNA or RNA.

01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:50.256
Autism is actually there as a biological mythology set to confuse the idea that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:33:50.636 --> 01:33:54.579
And vaccines are a myth because intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:33:54.939 --> 01:33:58.662
You don't need to object to mandating poison.

01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:02.385
You need to object to the giving of poison.

01:34:04.827 --> 01:34:10.432
because giving poison to kids is not a good, sound biological idea.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:16.197
And so the way that we're legally attacking this is incorrect.

01:34:16.237 --> 01:34:26.326
The way that we are trying to argue biologically is incorrect because we are arguing within their little subset of ideas.

01:34:26.366 --> 01:34:28.889
We're kicking their balls on their field.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:35.245
instead of picking up the ball and going somewhere else, or more importantly, starting our own game with our own ball.

01:34:35.305 --> 01:34:36.366
That's what we should be doing.

01:34:36.406 --> 01:34:39.167
And that's what the new Biology 101 is.

01:34:39.727 --> 01:34:51.412
It's a new model of biology assembled from a lot of different people's ideas that makes everything just fall into place a hell of a lot better than evolution because DNA does.

01:34:52.349 --> 01:34:56.173
You can insist that it does, but that really doesn't explain very much at all.

01:34:56.233 --> 01:35:00.938
It just is an insistence that all these assumptions must be accepted.

01:35:03.342 --> 01:35:09.765
And so yesterday, I thought I did a really interesting little read of this article in the British Medical Journal from November 2000.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:15.367
If you didn't see that, please watch it, The Importance of Injecting Vaccines into Muscle.

01:35:15.427 --> 01:35:32.635
And in that program, I also drew another version of this little picture here that shows a very simplified version of who you are as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, and why it's so important to understand the oversimplified illusion that they have given to us that they gave to our parents.

01:35:33.255 --> 01:35:34.256
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:35.637
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:35:35.677 --> 01:35:41.422
Transfecting healthy people is a crime and the population pyramid is a real problem and they are actively managing it.

01:35:41.563 --> 01:35:42.303
I assure you.

01:35:43.324 --> 01:35:44.345
Thanks very much for being here.

01:35:44.385 --> 01:35:45.346
I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:13.705
Holy cow, we're going to get to the gym really soon and start filming.

01:36:15.026 --> 01:36:19.750
I'm really close to pulling that trigger on that one because once we start doing that we're going to have a lot of fun.

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:28.656
It's going to mean a little less live streaming because I have editing to do, but the stuff on the hardwood I think is going to be really the bomb.

01:36:28.956 --> 01:36:32.639
I got a lot of good ideas, a lot of good tricks up my sleeve.

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.401
I've basically taken all of this and

01:36:36.602 --> 01:36:52.455
and made a mobile little suitcase that I can bring to the gym and just set it up and and shoot and uh I think it's working out really well and I think I'm almost in a good enough shape to pull it off so we'll see um I think if this is having

01:36:53.556 --> 01:37:04.081
trying to have a longer-term plan here and how we're going to fund the production of the book about COVID and the pandemic and also the book about Biology 101 or books.

01:37:04.681 --> 01:37:10.364
I think we've got so much work to do and I'm looking forward to doing all of it.

01:37:11.024 --> 01:37:12.705
Better and better every day, ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:12.725 --> 01:37:13.745
Better and better every day.

01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:16.106
I love you.

01:37:16.126 --> 01:37:17.427
Team USA, baby!

01:37:18.287 --> 01:37:21.669
Sorry, it's not that I don't like you guys in Canada or anywhere else, but

01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:24.004
I'm fighting for Team USA.

01:37:24.024 --> 01:37:26.365
I'm fighting for the future of America.

01:37:26.646 --> 01:37:33.930
And I think America specifically is under attack because we have the Constitution that can save us.

01:37:34.811 --> 01:37:35.871
Thank you very much for being here.

01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:36.592
I'll see you again soon.
