WEBVTT

00:00.049 --> 00:00.489
Does it matter?

00:00.909 --> 00:03.790
It matters about fear.

00:04.290 --> 00:05.410
So breathe in.

00:08.651 --> 00:08.971
Two.

00:11.932 --> 00:12.292
Three.

00:15.192 --> 00:15.753
Through the nose.

00:18.073 --> 00:19.533
By doing this, two.

00:22.234 --> 00:22.554
Three.

00:23.954 --> 00:26.555
Sam, let it go with the fear that I'm holding in my body.

00:34.190 --> 00:34.390
Yeah.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.291
Get everybody moving their hips.

00:36.731 --> 00:38.071
But don't hit the people beside you.

00:42.113 --> 00:42.473
OK.

00:43.873 --> 00:55.617
And see, as we bring these 10 organs into focus, as we bring these organs into focus, then you'll start to clear your head.

00:55.997 --> 00:57.617
Everybody feel a little clearer right now?

00:57.737 --> 00:58.098
Yeah?

00:59.478 --> 00:59.978
Let me hear it.

01:00.778 --> 01:01.979
Yeah.

01:01.999 --> 01:02.119
OK.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.873
Take your right hand and put it on your right ribcage.

01:05.853 --> 01:07.374
Okay, this is your kidney.

01:07.394 --> 01:08.775
Say hello, kidney.

01:09.195 --> 01:09.895
Hello, kidney.

01:09.915 --> 01:12.676
Okay, take your left hand, reach over.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.057
Lean over to your left.

01:14.097 --> 01:15.958
Take your hand to the right.

01:16.518 --> 01:21.460
Take three sharp breaths, go.

01:21.500 --> 01:27.363
So they say they're aligning 10 different organs in their body together.

01:28.502 --> 01:48.878
being led over a little acoustic guitar picking and it sure seems like this is substituting for some kind of prayer or maybe singing a song together this is like a full body hypnosis

01:51.704 --> 01:55.807
Get them all riled up and ready to go, I guess, all on the same page.

01:55.887 --> 01:57.107
It's innocent, I'm sure.

01:58.008 --> 01:58.989
It's innocent, I'm sure.

02:00.630 --> 02:01.370
Hello, everybody.

02:01.390 --> 02:01.890
Hi, Aaron.

02:01.910 --> 02:02.791
Hi, Lexicount.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.872
Hi, Brother Spoon.

02:04.732 --> 02:05.653
Tazixcube.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.214
I don't know how to say any of these names.

02:07.254 --> 02:12.897
You know, if you don't use an underscore or something like that, I mean, Brother Spoon seems easy.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.341
Anyway, good to see you guys.

02:24.241 --> 02:30.166
Yeah, it's pretty goofy, right?

02:30.186 --> 02:32.208
I find this really goofy.

02:32.408 --> 02:41.997
I don't know what else to say other than this is, this is not how any, uh, any festival I've ever been to started.

03:01.201 --> 03:11.544
I am really here, I'm just not always going to be on camera for this because I'm going to be walking in and out of the house and doing other things because it's not that important, but I'm listening to it.

03:12.945 --> 03:16.206
It doesn't look crowded to me.

03:26.292 --> 03:28.634
The stats class has just stopped last week.

03:28.654 --> 03:30.095
They're going to come back tomorrow again.

03:30.115 --> 03:31.416
I'm going to start again tomorrow.

03:31.436 --> 03:31.817
Don't worry.

03:32.217 --> 03:34.399
When we want to heal, we're sick, we want to retreat.

03:34.499 --> 03:35.880
But we come out, we heal.

03:36.681 --> 03:38.542
So take your right foot, cross it over your left.

03:38.602 --> 03:41.564
It's going to be a little tricky for some of you.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.586
Take your right hand, turn your left.

03:45.107 --> 03:49.571
Take your left hand up top, turn your head to the left, and your body to the right.

03:51.092 --> 03:53.814
OK, now what we're going to do is take six breaths together.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.095
Breathe through the mouth.

03:55.276 --> 03:55.576
Breathe in.

04:10.555 --> 04:15.761
I would characterize this as a very unique kind of maybe cowboy or

04:16.861 --> 04:29.107
or uniquely Western American country music type hypnosis because of the use of the particular acoustic guitar timbre.

04:29.247 --> 04:30.328
It's really curious.

04:30.388 --> 04:30.808
Three.

04:34.170 --> 04:34.750
Through the nose.

04:34.770 --> 04:38.192
Two.

04:40.433 --> 04:40.753
Three.

04:43.394 --> 04:44.515
Rescue the LARP.

05:07.458 --> 05:18.223
You know, Make America Real Again is actually something that I'm going to add to the independent bright web graphic because that's absolutely perfect.

05:19.023 --> 05:27.787
Make America Real Again and it should be an all black hat with a blacked out raised print that says M-A-R-A.

05:27.887 --> 05:30.108
That is fantastic.

05:30.168 --> 05:31.289
It's going to be a new thing.

05:31.489 --> 05:33.150
We're going to put it on the website too.

05:33.270 --> 05:36.011
If you don't mind me stealing it, I'm stealing it right now.

05:39.316 --> 05:43.798
So making the world healthy again, that's one of the ways you can do it right there.

05:43.898 --> 05:44.438
Want to give it up?

05:44.578 --> 05:44.898
All right.

05:45.319 --> 05:47.660
We're about to start the Bain Show in just two minutes.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.041
We'll see you guys in a little bit.

05:49.081 --> 05:50.401
Make some noise for yourselves for being here.

05:50.441 --> 05:51.522
Rescue the Republic!

06:03.652 --> 06:11.635
There aren't that many people there because the camera is not that far from the stage and there's nobody standing next to each other.

06:12.895 --> 06:15.696
If you wanted to get to the front, you could definitely get to the front.

06:18.077 --> 06:21.659
We have quite the lineup for us today.

06:22.599 --> 06:23.780
And it's going to be great.

06:23.820 --> 06:28.861
I mean, I personally, I just got back from an LBGTQ plus rally for Hezbollah.

06:31.442 --> 06:32.263
It was on the roof.

06:35.782 --> 06:37.163
Let that sink in for a second.

06:38.243 --> 06:41.604
We're going to have a great day for you.

06:41.624 --> 06:44.606
There's going to be a lot of impressive speakers.

06:45.606 --> 06:49.288
We're going to ask everybody to, you guys are fantastic.

06:49.308 --> 06:55.570
We're going to ask you, through you, you will be our ambassadors to open up people's hearts and their minds.

06:56.831 --> 06:57.191
To what?

06:57.831 --> 07:01.893
To protect what this is and this hallowed ground that we stand upon.

07:03.137 --> 07:08.461
the freest, greatest experiment in freedom in the history of the world.

07:13.385 --> 07:17.328
And it does require our eternal vigilance now more than ever.

07:18.769 --> 07:19.990
But I am not worried.

07:20.811 --> 07:31.179
I know that God has given us this great opportunity to recharge ourselves, to ask us what we want as a nation, as a community,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.327
as a family.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.108
Why wouldn't we ask what God wants?

07:37.749 --> 07:51.558
We want to continue this for the next generation and for our grandchildren and that decisions that we make this November are going to help continue this freedom moving forward.

07:57.802 --> 08:01.264
The great people who founded this country never asked and never

08:03.086 --> 08:05.248
They didn't say that they wanted a perfect union.

08:06.128 --> 08:08.150
They wanted the opportunity for a better union.

08:09.992 --> 08:11.072
And that's what we have here.

08:11.152 --> 08:12.874
Now, we're going to have a lot of speakers coming up.

08:13.194 --> 08:18.198
We'd like to start this off with a little music just to warm your bones right now as it's a little wet out there.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.861
They have a new album called Revolution.

08:22.401 --> 08:27.005
Please welcome our good friends and freedom fighters, Skillet.

08:30.188 --> 08:30.448
All right.

08:47.711 --> 08:49.272
We're still waiting for Skillet.

08:49.312 --> 08:50.533
I can do something like this.

08:52.554 --> 08:53.674
You remember this slide.

08:55.255 --> 08:59.057
And then the next slide can be bang like that.

08:59.137 --> 09:01.098
Ooh, check it out.

09:01.158 --> 09:01.679
Did you see it?

09:02.339 --> 09:04.740
Did you like that?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.341
All right, ladies and gentlemen, here they are.

09:06.681 --> 09:07.602
Please welcome.

09:08.883 --> 09:09.843
They just did a nice prayer.

09:09.863 --> 09:11.124
Please welcome Skillet.

09:19.654 --> 09:20.215
I am here.

09:20.275 --> 09:27.880
I don't know how often I want to put myself on the screen just because I got all kinds of crap here that I don't, you know, anyway.

09:30.262 --> 09:31.643
It's a mess in the room right now.

09:31.843 --> 09:35.666
And so I'll sometimes be off camera, but I'm always going to be here.

09:35.706 --> 09:36.806
I don't know whose skill it is.

09:36.886 --> 09:40.229
So again, we might be wasting a lot of bandwidth here.

09:41.470 --> 09:42.971
Some, you know, sometimes I don't know.

09:45.222 --> 09:50.347
I didn't want to give them extra attention, but on the other hand, I am happy I caught that beginning part.

09:55.673 --> 09:59.197
I might stay here for a little while just to see, but I might also disappear.

09:59.217 --> 10:01.940
I didn't know whose skill it was.

10:13.995 --> 10:16.397
If you know it, sing it with me.

10:38.522 --> 10:41.984
All my bad, no survival, that's the goddamn spice.

10:42.004 --> 10:47.047
Surrender, don't trigger, leave the zone, and then they'll take your spice.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.068
Hey, hey, hey, let me take it that way.

10:50.088 --> 10:53.890
They're trying to fuck you back in the house.

10:53.970 --> 11:04.116
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me when I say, you're making me strong, you're making me sad.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.467
something like that might work i like it

11:36.341 --> 11:36.922
Spill it!

12:12.254 --> 12:13.495
Wow, this is really bad.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.997
I don't know what to say.

12:15.297 --> 12:23.163
Can you imagine if you drove like six hours and had a hotel breakfast and then showed up and this is what they opened with?

12:44.124 --> 12:49.047
I mean, think about the resources that were mustered in order to get all this stuff together.

12:49.067 --> 12:57.013
I mean, there's probably more resources behind this than there is behind G. Edward Griffin's Red Pill Expo.

12:57.093 --> 13:00.435
And he does what he can.

13:00.855 --> 13:07.560
But I mean, I bet you there's another digit behind the amount of money that was behind this, if not more.

13:09.130 --> 13:13.154
And most of the people that go to the Red Pill Expo are paying for themselves to be there.

13:13.314 --> 13:21.684
I mean, it's not everybody that goes to the Red Pill Expo and needs G. Edward Griffin to cover their hotel and airfare.

13:23.886 --> 13:35.730
I assure you that I don't think, anyway, that the Red Pill is paying for Brian Artis or Kaufman to be there.

13:36.430 --> 13:38.191
They are already, oh, it's fine.

13:38.731 --> 13:40.631
I'm self-funded because they are.

13:42.732 --> 13:45.713
And it's extraordinary, ladies and gentlemen.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.374
It's very extraordinary what you can see happening here.

13:49.334 --> 13:51.015
And now, just think about how much

13:52.917 --> 13:58.200
was spent on it, how many people really needed it to be something.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.102
Because a lot of these people really needed it to be something.

14:01.162 --> 14:03.323
Jordan Peterson did a podcast about it.

14:03.844 --> 14:04.984
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:05.004 --> 14:06.185
did a podcast about it.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.726
Brett Weinstein was on everybody's podcast.

14:09.567 --> 14:10.848
Jimmy Dore did it all.

14:11.288 --> 14:15.170
And all of those people have been promoting it on their little thing.

14:16.900 --> 14:20.243
It's an all-hands-on-deck kind of operation here.

14:20.323 --> 14:25.908
Make America healthy again in the same font.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.711
This is some amazing stuff.

14:29.751 --> 14:31.833
There's two screens on the side there.

14:31.853 --> 14:38.919
I mean, maybe there are companies that provide these things, but again, I'm just talking about orders of magnitude more money.

14:39.099 --> 14:40.220
It's really incredible.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.183
It smells like freedom!

14:47.571 --> 14:53.894
We're here to have a good time and to stand up for this great country and the principles that started it.

14:53.914 --> 14:58.796
This is the resistance.

14:59.977 --> 15:02.158
How many people joined the resistance today?

15:03.278 --> 15:03.878
Come on!

15:04.399 --> 15:04.619
Whoa!

15:21.872 --> 15:23.712
I can't do it anymore.

15:58.951 --> 16:25.647

So that you may be justified in your sermons, and win,

19:58.726 --> 20:06.913
So you notice that they had to zoom in on the crowd really quick because they didn't want you to be able to see the back or the front of the crowd and they kind of blew that cut.

20:07.714 --> 20:09.035
And now they're playing this.

20:10.176 --> 20:21.727
This is Mickey Willis' little, you know, run up that we looked at last night.

20:21.807 --> 20:23.989
With the really low voice in the microphone.

20:25.928 --> 20:50.589
fought for everything we've earned and everything we love is under attack i feel actually really bad turning turning misery or elf it's kind of uh now is the time for the american people to wake up and rise up a rebel alliance is forming in the name of liberty and life people

21:01.901 --> 21:05.806
If there is risk, there must be choice.

21:06.467 --> 21:11.493
I don't think they really have their levels right, so that's why my sound effects are so much louder than theirs.

21:11.573 --> 21:13.716
I can't really turn... I don't want to turn them up anymore.

21:14.377 --> 21:18.562
...that will allow them to punish us from a distance and cut off our food supply.

21:18.782 --> 21:21.225
Prevent political abuse of our judicial system.

21:21.345 --> 21:26.308
What we are demanding is in fact the restoration of the rule of law.

21:26.469 --> 21:27.910
Secure our national borders.

21:28.250 --> 21:33.514
I'm tired of the United States doing nothing to protect the American people.

21:33.594 --> 21:35.075
Protect our children.

21:35.275 --> 21:38.897
To defend our children and to save an entire generation.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.079
Restore critical thinking and education.

21:41.279 --> 21:44.521
I think that the time for change is now and enough is enough.

21:44.821 --> 21:48.324
And above all, break our addiction to war.

21:48.624 --> 21:55.978
The nuclear threat is an emergency of the highest order, and we are all in the crosshairs of this emergency.

21:57.270 --> 22:04.916
We must set aside our differences, work together to fire those warmongering politicians from both political parties.

22:05.276 --> 22:12.622
Everybody from the left, everybody from the right, everybody from the middle coming together to realize that we have more in common than divides us.

22:12.742 --> 22:17.025
What unites us is so much stronger than anything that divides us.

22:17.265 --> 22:18.466
We're a country of love.

22:18.806 --> 22:20.668
We're a country that care about people.

22:20.768 --> 22:25.732
The one thing that brings us together here today is that we value life.

22:31.235 --> 22:32.055
Stop lying!

22:32.075 --> 22:34.637
2020 is the code for healthy vision.

22:34.737 --> 22:38.159
It is also the year we were given the eyes to see.

22:59.773 --> 23:01.574
Can you see how amateur hour this is?

23:01.894 --> 23:03.755
They are replaying it again.

23:04.415 --> 23:15.521
They probably have one person behind the stream thing, and he doesn't even have direct communication with any of the camera people.

23:15.561 --> 23:19.323
That's why you saw that cut, and that's why they're replaying this again.

23:19.343 --> 23:21.384
This is very sad.

23:21.404 --> 23:22.184
Spared no expense.

23:22.224 --> 23:22.544
This is...

23:25.846 --> 23:29.748
We are very close to breaking the veils here.

23:30.889 --> 23:35.651
As their empire of lies is collapsing, they are becoming increasingly desperate and dangerous.

23:35.671 --> 23:36.512
Wow, this is amazing.

23:36.532 --> 23:40.293
Russia, China, and Iran have announced the three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.635
The alliance has been formed to chill us all to the bone.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.716
To the bone.

23:46.176 --> 23:52.800
Everything we have fought for, everything we've earned, and everything we love

23:53.440 --> 23:54.261
is under attack.

23:56.542 --> 24:00.904
At what point do we say enough is enough?

24:04.426 --> 24:07.208
Now is the time for the American people to wake up

24:08.794 --> 24:15.777
I feel like it's even really weird that they use that video from those apartments in Colorado.

24:15.857 --> 24:19.059
As if, you know, like that would be okay.

24:19.199 --> 24:21.340
Like they have to be really up to date with this.

24:21.420 --> 24:25.282
So up to date that they use a video from Colorado.

24:25.362 --> 24:26.022
It's strange.

24:26.363 --> 24:28.464
Robert Malone from like 2021 or 2022.

24:28.544 --> 24:29.284
And Pierre Cory.

24:39.198 --> 24:47.624
The censorship and propaganda was used to elevate Corey and used to elevate the voice of Corey and Malone.

24:47.644 --> 25:00.332
And all of the censorship that was applied to them ended up with more publicity, including appearances on everybody's podcast and even Tucker Carlson's.

25:01.273 --> 25:04.055
If they replay it for a third time, we're not going to listen to it.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.402
now and enough is enough.

25:07.502 --> 25:11.369
Can the bubble break our addiction to war?

25:11.509 --> 25:18.862
The nuclear threat is an emergency of the highest order and we are all in the crosshairs of this emergency.

25:20.171 --> 25:21.051
Wow, it's just so awful.

25:41.044 --> 25:51.346
And the fact that they're replaying it again isn't doing themselves any favors because the more times you watch this, the more evident it becomes that this can't be real.

25:55.907 --> 26:04.129
Every single principle on which the weapon is based is under simultaneous threat.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.710
All of these people are liars.

26:09.628 --> 26:11.229
All of these people are liars.

26:18.013 --> 26:26.138
He's behind glass.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.180
Hey.

26:32.381 --> 26:33.462
Alright, that's great.

26:34.102 --> 26:34.723
That's okay.

26:36.070 --> 26:39.511
I don't need no stinking bulletproof glass because I'm a midget.

26:42.652 --> 26:43.112
All right.

26:44.473 --> 26:47.914
It's great to see such a wonderful sea of people out here.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.175
A great mix of people.

26:51.615 --> 26:53.136
Medical freedom fighters.

26:55.297 --> 26:57.037
Champions of free speech.

26:59.278 --> 27:00.298
MAGA people.

27:02.459 --> 27:05.080
Make America healthy again people.

27:08.789 --> 27:12.031
It's great to see Joe Biden walking by in his pajamas.

27:14.452 --> 27:24.038
And of course, also mingling amongst us in the crowd today, FBI agents dressed up as white supremacist neo-Nazi Trump voting anti-vaxxers.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.481
Always great to have you here, gentlemen.

27:30.762 --> 27:32.402
Wearing the same khaki pants.

27:35.064 --> 27:38.126
The anniversary of January 6th is fast approaching.

27:39.161 --> 27:59.655
January 6th is, as Kamala Harris and the Democrats called it, the worst attack on our democracy since 9-11 or Pearl Harbor, or as any rational observer might refer to it, January 6th, the FBI guided tour and costume party at the Capitol building.

28:06.960 --> 28:27.698
Now the woke Democrats want to attack us, confuse us, call us systematically racist because of the color of our skin, flood our cities with migrants to drain our resources, and try to bully us into repeating robotically repeated phrases like trans women are women.

28:29.599 --> 28:32.101
You can call yourself a trans woman all you want.

28:32.930 --> 28:37.956
It doesn't matter, because when you turn 50, someone is still going to have to check your prostate.

28:37.976 --> 28:42.481
It gets a little crispy when I do that, but that's what I can do for you.

28:42.501 --> 28:45.244
50-year-old trans woman, you're still going to get the finger.

28:48.628 --> 28:52.092
Children cannot consent to puberty blockers.

28:59.360 --> 29:04.384
Do you remember how awful those gay conversion therapy sessions were?

29:04.764 --> 29:05.545
Bad, right?

29:06.426 --> 29:08.508
Trying to talk someone out of being gay.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.749
Well, do you know what's way worse?

29:11.830 --> 29:20.117
Cutting off the breasts of young girls and mutilating young boys and poisoning them with castration puberty blockers.

29:21.118 --> 29:24.501
This is being embraced by the LBGTQ plus community.

29:25.598 --> 29:39.864
Now in our society, 14-year-old girls aren't allowed to drive, vote, get a tattoo, buy a gun, see an R-rated movie, or join the army because they aren't mature enough to make decisions like those.

29:40.705 --> 29:46.628
Yet in democratic states, they can choose to make decisions that can make them permanently infertile.

29:47.628 --> 29:50.889
In America, you can't even rent a car until you're 25 years old.

29:53.220 --> 30:00.584
What does Avis, Hertz, Alamo, and Enterprise know that the Democrats and the medical establishment seem so ignorant about?

30:06.726 --> 30:16.051
Now, whether Republican or Democrat wins this November, it'll mean nothing if we don't get Americans healthy again.

30:20.660 --> 30:24.021
But I must admit, if you're going to be fat, be fat in America.

30:25.581 --> 30:29.603
Because in America, no matter how fat you are, you can always feel good about yourself.

30:31.183 --> 30:39.966
Because in America, if you're fat, all you have to do is wait four minutes, five tops, before you see somebody that's way fatter than you are.

30:39.986 --> 30:45.007
It's like, man, I feel terrible, but look at that piece of crap.

30:46.848 --> 30:48.028
How is that even standing?

30:49.960 --> 31:14.083
We are here today because we love our country, and we see it sliding into perilous waters, where the hurricane of tyranny threatens to drown our cherished liberties, where in a country that, in its current system of elections, only allows two political parties, and one of those parties, the Democratic Party, has disguised itself as the party of the people.

31:17.990 --> 31:29.115
As the party of decency and truth, of protecting democracy, of peace, of being the savior of women's rights, of being the party of the worker, nothing could be further from the truth.

31:32.497 --> 31:35.539
Democrats are no longer the party of the people.

31:37.332 --> 31:47.596
They no longer represent the working class, they represent the moneyed class, the new aristocracy, the expert class with the three letters next to their names, PhD.

31:48.656 --> 31:56.059
They collude with tech companies and use censorship to silence those that dare disagree with the authoritarian policies.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.961
They use lawfare to attack and imprison their political enemies.

32:02.062 --> 32:04.583
They close small businesses, churches,

32:05.481 --> 32:11.384
Well, they leave open big businesses, liquor stores, and strip clubs, which I'm grateful for.

32:14.045 --> 32:20.288
They fire soldiers, frontline doctors, and nurses for refusing to take a universal gene therapy.

32:21.129 --> 32:24.230
And they no longer use the term, my body, my choice, do they?

32:25.711 --> 32:26.491
Because it isn't.

32:26.551 --> 32:29.933
They consider it, your body is their choice.

32:31.533 --> 32:40.840
They allow 10 to 20 million people to illegally cross over our border, bus and fly them to places where nobody in those communities voted for them to come.

32:41.880 --> 32:49.025
Instead of protecting women, they allow narcissistic men to invade their safe spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons.

32:49.486 --> 32:59.173
They deplete our nation's treasure by continuing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on forever wars that push the world closer to World War III.

33:01.314 --> 33:05.775
It's the closest to World War III since we've been, since John F. Kennedy was president.

33:06.695 --> 33:11.296
The average American now has to choose between buying groceries or buying gas.

33:12.556 --> 33:23.218
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do not believe that free speech is our most basic right guaranteed under our First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, our Bill of Rights.

33:24.418 --> 33:28.499
They mistakenly call free speech a privilege.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.551
They are in error.

33:31.571 --> 33:44.580
To quote my friend, thank you, to quote my friend Andrew Doyle, free speech is the marrow of democracy.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.922
Without it, no other liberties exist.

33:49.063 --> 33:54.267
It is detested by tyrants because it empowers their captive subjects.

33:55.413 --> 34:00.017
It is mistrusted by Puritans because it is the wellspring of subversion.

34:00.898 --> 34:06.422
Unless we are able to speak our minds, we cannot innovate or even begin to make sense of the world.

34:10.105 --> 34:16.811
It is important that we reach out to people beyond our political affiliation to save our country.

34:16.831 --> 34:17.852
It is not about party.

34:17.892 --> 34:18.732
It is about nation.

34:19.053 --> 34:20.334
And I will leave you with this story.

34:21.288 --> 34:25.489
For people who want to divide us into Democrat and Republican, it's one snake with two heads.

34:25.509 --> 34:27.410
My audio, I just turned it off, sorry.

34:27.970 --> 34:40.354
Now, all you need to know about America and the character of America is when you see disasters like just happened this week in Florida.

34:41.214 --> 34:50.817
During the floods, when people are standing on top of their roofs to be rescued, and the people in boats are coming by to rescue those people standing on their roofs.

34:51.636 --> 34:54.037
here's what the people in the boats are not saying.

34:56.598 --> 34:58.859
Are you a democrat or republican up there?

34:58.879 --> 35:01.481
A republican?

35:01.501 --> 35:07.243
Oh, well this, well a democrat, well this is, this is a republican boat.

35:08.084 --> 35:11.385
Yeah, the democrat boat should be coming pretty quickly.

35:11.625 --> 35:14.647
Good luck with that, it's a kayak, it's better for the environment.

35:18.556 --> 35:20.179
Alright, thank you for being here.

35:20.199 --> 35:22.162
Ladies and gentlemen, let's keep this going now.

35:22.202 --> 35:24.065
I'm honored to be with you.

35:24.085 --> 35:26.349
Now, let us welcome to the stage a first responder.

35:34.051 --> 35:39.375
Steve Slepcevic, he is CEO of SRP24 and Saber Security.

35:39.395 --> 35:44.659
35 years of responding to some of America's greatest disasters.

35:45.179 --> 35:55.707
As a matter of fact, he just got back this morning from Florida, where his first responders and security teams are working tirelessly to help those in need and keeping us here safe today.

35:55.967 --> 35:58.889
Please welcome Steve Slepcevic.

36:07.423 --> 36:08.324
Oh, I've met that guy before.

36:08.344 --> 36:08.704
He's a cool dude.

36:08.724 --> 36:09.825
I have his card somewhere.

36:09.845 --> 36:09.905
Hmm.

36:09.925 --> 36:11.347
Millions watching online, I don't think so.

36:11.367 --> 36:12.208
I do have his card somewhere.

36:12.228 --> 36:15.631
I would have a hard time finding it right now.

36:34.013 --> 36:38.535
My name is Steve Slepcevic, and it's a great honor for me to stand here beside you today.

36:38.875 --> 36:39.636
They're all reading.

36:40.176 --> 36:41.877
Each of you is not just a spectator.

36:42.998 --> 36:46.159
You're a defender that has taken a committed stand for something much greater than ourselves.

36:46.179 --> 36:47.740
I guess there's no teleprompters available.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.762
Today we gather to ignite a fire of unity and rescue our republic.

36:53.403 --> 36:55.604
To secure a brighter future for our children.

36:57.093 --> 37:04.275
to restore our land, our food, and our values that made this country a beacon of light and freedom in a very dark world.

37:08.236 --> 37:12.477
Before we begin, I want to draw your attention to the distant perimeter.

37:14.378 --> 37:23.500
Out there, you will hear a powerful sound of pipes and drums that are going to be cutting through the air as they move their way towards the stage.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.171
Tell you a little bit about what this represents.

37:28.451 --> 37:31.472
These are the firefighters from every corner of our great republic.

37:38.615 --> 37:44.318
Some have come from the streets of Los Angeles, other from the city that never sleeps, New York.

37:46.619 --> 37:50.860
From Kentucky to North Carolina, from Florida to Maryland.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.581
Doesn't look like it's raining.

37:51.641 --> 37:54.842
And yes, some from right here in our nation's capital.

37:57.637 --> 38:04.101
They've traveled here at their own expense, but more importantly, they're here to remind us of something we seem to have forgotten.

38:04.381 --> 38:08.663
Because Bret Weinstein and Rescue the Republic wouldn't pay for them to come, I guess.

38:09.323 --> 38:11.785
They paid for themselves to come, I guarantee it.

38:15.227 --> 38:22.871
Among these ranks, firefighters, doctors, parents, advocates, and many Americans who've lost almost everything.

38:25.202 --> 38:37.685
careers, medical licenses, life savings, friends and family because they refused to submit to mandates that violated their principles and their bodily autonomy.

38:40.306 --> 38:52.648
Some even carrying the flag that were pressured into taking a failed government experiment that has left them severely injured, forced into medical retirement.

38:53.969 --> 38:54.589
They are you.

38:55.950 --> 39:04.116
These courageous men and women stood on the front lines during the pandemic, risking their lives to save others, and yet were cast aside when they defended their freedoms.

39:05.137 --> 39:08.219
Folks, silence is compliance.

39:11.962 --> 39:15.905
They were not silent, and they never will be.

39:16.706 --> 39:20.689
They continue to fight, standing before you as living testaments,

39:23.168 --> 39:26.370
to the resilience and an unbreakable spirit.

39:34.534 --> 39:35.195
So did he say?

39:35.215 --> 39:45.000
To those among us who serve as firefighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, law enforcement, military, and our amazing veterans, please raise your hands and be

39:49.426 --> 39:53.228
So it's weird because the way I understand this, and I've met him a couple times.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.389
I met him at a CHD conference.

39:55.469 --> 39:58.271
I also met him at the event for the announcement of Bobby's candidacy.

39:58.351 --> 39:59.531
And I may have met him one other place before.

39:59.551 --> 40:02.093
I'd have to, oh yeah, he was at the Red Pill conference, I believe.

40:17.109 --> 40:18.410
I met him somewhere else.

40:18.430 --> 40:18.990
It doesn't matter.

40:19.010 --> 40:20.031
I've met him multiple times.

40:20.091 --> 40:20.711
I have his card.

40:20.772 --> 40:21.232
It's black.

40:21.272 --> 40:21.712
It's really thick.

40:21.732 --> 40:23.333
And what he told me was is that he had organized...

40:32.924 --> 40:49.250
A bunch of people, a bunch of firefighters from maybe 9-11 or from New York or something like this to go to January 6th and then all of those people that worked for him had FBI agents come to their house after January 6th.

40:49.290 --> 40:52.772
Some of them had FBI agents come to their house multiple times.

40:54.780 --> 41:10.496
That was the story that he told me that got him going and that motivated him that he had this group of, that's what it was, it's a group of firefighters and EMTs and people who were fired because of the mandates.

41:11.096 --> 41:20.359
And then he built a company, a rescue company, or some kind of thing like that, and hired all those people in New York.

41:20.399 --> 41:23.040
And then they went to January 6th.

41:23.300 --> 41:26.701
And after January 6th, they got a bunch of visits from the FBI.

41:26.721 --> 41:29.882
Those are the things that I heard from him, if I recall correctly.

41:30.462 --> 41:39.765
And I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to, I'm just trying to recall correctly, right now, live, what I remember about this guy.

41:40.987 --> 41:42.627
But for sure, I've met him more than once.

41:42.827 --> 41:46.508
For sure, every time I've met him has been around CHD or Bobby.

41:46.788 --> 41:56.391
And what he told me was is that he organized people who were fired for the mandates in New York into a rescue company of some kind.

41:56.411 --> 42:00.092
And they went to January 6th and had FBI come to their houses.

42:00.692 --> 42:04.573
Those are the, that's the two stories that I remember.

42:05.433 --> 42:08.114
Oh boy, here we go.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.314
Robert Malone with the,

42:10.675 --> 42:11.678
I guess universal.

42:25.382 --> 42:26.002
Interesting.

42:27.923 --> 42:29.163
I want to go back and see it again.

42:29.183 --> 42:32.225
I'm going to bring your attention back towards the firefighters this moment.

42:32.525 --> 42:36.226
The massive flag you see before you has flown over many battles for liberty.

42:36.246 --> 42:41.568
Today it resembles and symbolizes the reason we are gathered here to rescue a republic.

42:42.028 --> 42:49.111
Each of us, no matter how small our actions may seem, creates a ripple that builds into a wave of change.

42:50.131 --> 42:54.233
Today we are that tsunami, moving as one heartbeat, one breath.

42:55.379 --> 42:58.421
Now there's a second flag, smaller but no less significant.

42:58.881 --> 43:01.903
It bears the signature of every firefighter who's traveled here today.

43:02.524 --> 43:13.451
Leading this flag is a fire axe, a custom piece dedicated to the memory of fallen Fire Chief Cory Compatero of Pennsylvania.

43:13.511 --> 43:20.595
Chief Compatero gave his life protecting his family during the failed assassination attempt on President Donald J. Trump on July 13th, 2024.

43:25.652 --> 43:34.835
Today we honor him not just as a fire chief, but as a father, a brother, a son, and a true patriot who laid down his life for this country.

43:35.575 --> 43:43.977
This flag along with the memorial acts will soon be presented to his family and we are privileged to witness the first steps of this solemn journey here today.

43:45.238 --> 43:45.758
Patriot,

43:46.627 --> 43:50.890
Patriots, our republic is under attack, but not from external enemies.

43:51.331 --> 43:57.856
The greatest dangers lie within, by those who seek to divide us, control us, and silence us.

43:59.617 --> 44:00.238
We are one.

44:01.038 --> 44:02.059
We are God's children.

44:09.885 --> 44:15.590
Make no mistake, this republic was forged in the fires of defiance, and today we stand as heirs to that legacy.

44:16.670 --> 44:17.830
We will not surrender.

44:17.850 --> 44:19.931
We will not back down.

44:20.491 --> 44:25.273
We are rising up using our voices to speak truth and do good in the world.

44:27.213 --> 44:33.916
Just as these brave firefighters posing for a photo op, they're taking a stand to restore nation to its founding principles.

44:34.876 --> 44:37.917
One nation who's that under God with liberty

44:39.694 --> 44:43.977
Indivisible, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

44:44.177 --> 44:46.478
Wow, he barely knew what to say and he has a script.

44:47.299 --> 44:49.000
If not now, when?

44:49.740 --> 44:52.002
If not here, where?

44:52.482 --> 44:54.704
If not us, who?

44:56.405 --> 45:00.767
Now's the time to act, not tomorrow, not next week, today.

45:01.708 --> 45:07.492
Each of you carries a spiritual flame within you all to re-member.

45:08.427 --> 45:11.388
You are that powerful flame that lights the way for others.

45:12.049 --> 45:19.412
That flame is power, truth, love, divine wisdom, and compassion.

45:19.732 --> 45:22.333
Together we are a firestorm of freedom.

45:22.373 --> 45:28.776
No government, no tyrant, no global force of evil can extinguish.

45:30.556 --> 45:36.779
It is time to step into the unknown, trusting the process, because God's leading this army.

45:40.254 --> 45:43.596
We are the 8 billion united.

45:44.357 --> 45:46.038
There are but a few thousand.

45:47.659 --> 46:00.508
If you're committed to declaring your independence and ready to move forward and rescue our republic, please signify your commitment by simply standing, raising your hands, and let your voices be heard.

46:06.572 --> 46:07.512
That's America.

46:08.873 --> 46:09.894
We are the 8 billion.

46:12.674 --> 46:16.376
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

46:23.379 --> 46:32.364
At this moment, I would like to take a moment of silence for Fire Chief Corey Compter.

46:52.989 --> 46:56.091
Did they just make everybody pray for a particular dude who's dead?

46:57.673 --> 46:58.514
Some fire chief?

46:59.514 --> 47:00.495
Had none of them know?

47:00.636 --> 47:01.817
Did they really just do that?

47:03.658 --> 47:04.019
Wow.

47:07.182 --> 47:07.522
Wow.

47:11.175 --> 47:13.116
Are they having technical problems now?

47:13.596 --> 47:19.079
Please, ladies and gentlemen, for the national anthem, please welcome Caitlin Curtis and Deepak.

47:37.990 --> 47:38.310
Audio.

47:44.480 --> 47:44.940
audio.

47:48.082 --> 47:53.644
Who were all of those people that they brought up on stage and didn't say anything?

48:05.307 --> 48:09.711
One of the things I'm going to interrupt this right now because I think it's really important to understand this.

48:09.912 --> 48:14.256
Okay, let me let me just make sure that you understand why I'm interrupting it.

48:17.098 --> 48:21.222
And you may not have seen this, but I've seen this since I was a little kid.

48:22.583 --> 48:24.185
And I've always asked the question.

48:25.871 --> 48:32.638
Why do you think they have all these celebrities sing different versions of the national anthem?

48:34.400 --> 48:42.629
It's so that you don't sing it anymore, so that we don't sing it anymore, so that it is uncommon to think of singing along.

48:43.890 --> 48:45.011
That's why they did it.

48:45.131 --> 48:48.295
When I was a kid, I remember singing along.

48:49.346 --> 48:55.231
I remember it not really being cool not to sing along at a football game when it was played.

48:55.251 --> 49:01.095
This is part of the controlled demolition of America, and now what?

49:01.155 --> 49:07.300
We've got yet another rendition that we're not supposed to sing along with because we're supposed to hear the harmonies.

49:08.101 --> 49:15.707
We're supposed to hear the special vocal inflection that they do on one particular word of it instead of singing it together.

49:17.779 --> 49:18.541
I'm sorry, man.

49:18.882 --> 49:19.624
That's my take.

49:45.134 --> 49:47.375
to christen this historic moment in prayer.

49:48.216 --> 49:51.738
Please welcome Bishop Carlos Mendez.

49:54.359 --> 49:58.102
Mark, they have a Catholic bishop.

49:58.482 --> 50:03.265
All of you that are standing here today are going to go to heaven.

50:07.127 --> 50:11.630
Because we're standing up for God and we're standing up for country.

50:12.386 --> 50:15.047
Did he just say that all the people here were going to go to heaven?

50:15.428 --> 50:16.148
He can't say that.

50:16.368 --> 50:24.233
Is he really standing there in the same hat that Robert Malone wore in a documentary in Spain with Gerard Van Den Bosch?

50:36.485 --> 50:43.670
but the hearts of the guards that were bribed into bringing illegals into their country.

50:44.791 --> 50:48.514
We ask you that you guard us from those leaders who have betrayed our country.

50:49.494 --> 50:54.458
Help us to stand on truth, that we may always stand firm in righteousness.

50:55.592 --> 50:59.695
We confess, Lord, that the labor without you cannot prosper.

51:00.416 --> 51:03.438
And any effort without you will surely fail.

51:03.478 --> 51:04.840
What time are we booked for basketball?

51:04.860 --> 51:05.120
Do you know?

51:05.140 --> 51:10.264
If it's your will, we will continue to fight and rescue this republic.

51:11.225 --> 51:18.210
Guide our steps, Father, and let every plan of the enemy be destroyed in Jesus' name.

51:19.591 --> 51:23.955
Father, we remember the words that your son said, apart from me, you can do nothing.

51:24.736 --> 51:29.099
We acknowledge this truth and invite you to be the center of all that we do.

51:30.059 --> 51:36.103
May this republic not rely on our own understanding, but on divine wisdom and guidance.

51:36.904 --> 51:44.228
We pray for unity among all Americans, for healing where there is division, and for peace where there is conflict.

51:45.769 --> 51:51.213
I ask you, Lord, for our veterans, past and present, that you will help them.

51:52.182 --> 52:01.446
Help us, Lord, with our homeless crisis that was created by this administration, the fentanyl that's rampant in our cities.

52:02.567 --> 52:11.551
Father, we remember the words that you said, do not be anxious about anything but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving presented to God.

52:12.452 --> 52:17.274
And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard our hearts and minds.

52:18.519 --> 52:19.419
in Christ Jesus.

52:19.900 --> 52:23.261
We choose to lay down our anxieties and trust.

52:23.761 --> 52:25.362
You guide us through every challenge.

52:25.902 --> 52:27.042
We lift up this prayer.

52:27.663 --> 52:31.624
Rescue the Republic, trusting in your power, sovereignty.

52:32.044 --> 52:35.986
May you continue to bless and guide the United States of America.

52:36.446 --> 52:40.588
And may we as people always seek your face and follow your ways.

52:40.968 --> 52:42.288
In your holy name we pray.

52:42.308 --> 52:42.388
Amen.

52:47.844 --> 52:48.725
Thank you, Bishop.

52:49.465 --> 52:50.546
I've never met a bishop.

52:50.586 --> 52:51.586
That was quite an honor.

52:53.288 --> 52:56.250
Academia, as we know now, has been captured.

52:57.831 --> 53:04.195
They are no longer teaching our young adults how to think critically.

53:05.576 --> 53:11.840
They are simply churning out advocates for a partisan ideology that is illiberal.

53:14.361 --> 53:16.283
If you have kids in college at this point,

53:17.133 --> 53:36.996
Take them out Take the money that you were going to spend on their education and buy stupid shit And when they come home because their credit cards sorry, yeah, I agree about the uh The iran trying to kill orange man narrative.

53:37.056 --> 53:46.338
It's actually uh, pretty hilarious now coming to the stage now a man who an academic who they tried to cancel

53:48.291 --> 53:57.314
But unfortunately, for the woke, which is nothing more than Marxism dressed up as manners, this man could not be canceled.

53:58.834 --> 54:12.598
He's a man whose wit, yes, he is a man whose wit, intellectual brilliance, courage, and most importantly, his love of country would not allow him to be canceled.

54:13.798 --> 54:15.559
He is a champion of freedom,

54:16.636 --> 54:28.880
Please welcome the sexiest biologist alive, Brett Weinstein!

54:29.500 --> 54:31.041
Stop lying!

54:31.801 --> 54:32.562
Stop lying!

54:32.602 --> 54:33.122
Thanks.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.241
Wow.

54:56.023 --> 54:56.965
Holy moly.

55:34.932 --> 55:35.252
All right.

55:36.553 --> 55:41.016
If it's OK with you guys, I'm going to claim I had the crowd on its feet from the beginning.

55:44.799 --> 55:46.540
So the time has arrived.

55:46.900 --> 55:49.122
Welcome to Rescue the Republic.

55:57.256 --> 56:06.621
Over the course of the next six hours or so, you're going to hear from some of the clearest minds on Earth, brilliant thinkers, clever comics, and insightful musicians.

56:07.681 --> 56:13.004
But the attributes that unite us in this historic time and place live not in the mind, but in the heart.

56:14.105 --> 56:21.369
What has caused us to converge is a powerful force, a product that blooms when courage and love are combined.

56:22.949 --> 56:23.770
Courage and love

56:24.932 --> 56:32.680
Courage and love are potent forces in their own right, of course, but neither on its own is sufficient to put you on this stage or in this crowd.

56:33.141 --> 56:43.392
A person can have courage and confront danger with no higher purpose in mind, and a person can love something and, paralyzed by fear, watch it perish before their eyes.

56:44.701 --> 56:53.345
When courage and love come together, however, when people face their fears for something they truly love, the force they become shapes history for the better.

56:53.985 --> 56:56.186
And that is what fuels our rescue mission.

57:00.287 --> 57:03.149
He's got a laptop, not just words, you know, on a page.

57:03.189 --> 57:04.029
He's got a laptop.

57:05.680 --> 57:08.062
This is not a political exercise.

57:08.242 --> 57:20.012
We are nonpartisan and brought together across ideological lines to right the ship of state and put her back on course toward an objective spelled out, but not fully achieved by the American founders.

57:29.380 --> 57:34.064
Patriotism is what brings us together in this moment of profound peril.

57:35.066 --> 57:35.927
Patriotism.

57:36.727 --> 57:52.399
Though I suspect some watching from afar will find my use of the term in 2024 bizarre or even grotesque, it has become fashionable, especially amongst those born into privilege, to regard patriotism as unenlightened, primal, and dangerous.

57:53.239 --> 57:54.961
But their educations have failed them.

57:55.481 --> 58:03.127
In a state of selfish confusion, they mistake nationalism for patriotism and toss the precious baby out with the dirty bathwater.

58:04.656 --> 58:18.199
President Kennedy, though he mentioned neither term, drew the distinction between nationalism and patriotism perfectly, not quite 64 years ago and not quite 3,000 meters directly to our east.

58:19.940 --> 58:26.941
Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country, Kennedy instructed two years before his untimely death.

58:29.002 --> 58:29.762
Some will ask,

58:30.658 --> 58:36.302
why it takes courage or love to deliver or witness a speech here in the shadow of the Washington Monument.

58:37.122 --> 58:38.683
Obviously, it shouldn't.

58:39.464 --> 58:46.848
But I doubt there are many here today who did not seriously consider whether they were putting their freedom or perhaps even their lives in danger.

58:46.948 --> 58:50.150
And as we planned the event, many people shared their concerns.

58:50.891 --> 58:55.614
I've lost count of the number of times I was warned not to do it by someone who then wished us luck.

58:56.658 --> 59:01.220
But the more I listened to people's trepidations, the simpler the calculus became.

59:02.681 --> 59:13.287
If millions of Americans are afraid to exercise their most fundamental right in their own capital, that implies the capital is held by a force that is hostile to the Republic and her people.

59:26.001 --> 59:27.262
This is some crazy stuff here.

59:27.302 --> 59:31.465
I have to get ready for basketball, so I'm gonna be in and out of camera, but I'm listening.

59:31.485 --> 59:34.107
I got it on the monitors in the room.

59:47.205 --> 59:52.708
I say the calculus is clear because the targeting of our civil liberties tells us where we are headed.

59:53.389 --> 01:00:03.895
If we don't stand up now, the slight relief we feel in the present will be replaced in short order by the suffering and horror experienced by those who face a historic atrocity.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.517
We must stare down this threat.

01:00:08.097 --> 01:00:09.298
We have no choice.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:24.292
we must speak out loud about our doubts and fears, as that old song would have it.

01:00:25.113 --> 01:00:28.955
Now, as long as we're on the topic of fears, let's confront one directly.

01:00:29.775 --> 01:00:41.982
If, as the event proceeds, you find yourself faced with someone displaying Nazi symbols, inciting violence or lawlessness, or you encounter a group of people dressed in paramilitary garb, those are assuredly federal agents.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:45.124
Thank them for their service and move on.

01:00:57.369 --> 01:01:03.492
Now, some of you are no doubt thinking there's something odd about a mission to rescue the Republic that includes many speakers from abroad.

01:01:04.232 --> 01:01:07.613
But this is actually a testament to the achievements of the founding generation.

01:01:08.674 --> 01:01:12.616
Our founding fathers almost accidentally invented the modern West.

01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:18.778
They did it because they had to balance the tensions between the various colonies in order to persuade them to confederate.

01:01:19.559 --> 01:01:26.602
The careful job that they did balancing the various concerns created a prototype for a world that was not rigged in anybody's direction.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.561
Obviously, they didn't complete the job.

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:33.082
The three-fifths compromise stands as a black mark on our record.

01:01:33.462 --> 01:01:41.625
But they did articulate the objective and create a process that, as long as the fundamentals are left intact, corrects itself over time.

01:01:42.845 --> 01:01:56.910
The founders innovated a system that was effectively a commitment to a level playing field, a complete departure from the world that preceded it, a world dominated by lineage against lineage conflict, navigated by threats and force.

01:01:58.308 --> 01:02:04.250
Commitment to a level playing field, even if the objective remains distant, turns out to be lightning in a bottle.

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:07.652
And the closer you get to that goal, the greater the returns.

01:02:09.032 --> 01:02:14.894
The world the West emerged from was dominated by considerations of race, ethnicity, and religion.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:19.236
Those parameters dominated the question of who you could collaborate with.

01:02:20.259 --> 01:02:25.683
Under such rules, people can only be so productive because the most potential collaborators are out of bounds.

01:02:26.584 --> 01:02:34.650
On a level playing field, where the entire society is bound by rules that favor no population over any other, productivity skyrockets.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:42.876
If everyone is free to collaborate across demographic lines, more wealth is created because more innovation happens and more productive work gets done.

01:02:43.896 --> 01:02:45.818
Teamwork is everything.

01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:00.896
The more choices you have when assembling your team, the greater the heights you can achieve.

01:03:01.557 --> 01:03:07.039
It is also true that it's simply a more meaningful and rewarding life when you abandon bigotry.

01:03:07.439 --> 01:03:12.421
It's like giving your entire civilization a massive raise in the currency of brotherhood.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.061
Oh my gosh.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:17.822
I mean, these are some of the worst lines ever.

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:23.764
He thinks he's like Shakespeare or something, and it's just... Now, am I saying that the United States is a level playing field?

01:03:24.205 --> 01:03:24.785
Of course not.

01:03:25.492 --> 01:03:29.896
and it was especially unfair to black Americans and Native Americans from its inception.

01:03:30.596 --> 01:03:47.269
But I am saying that the founders envisioned a republic of free people based on the idea that all men were created equal, a nation in which the legitimacy of governance was based on the consent of the governed, and every person was entitled to equal protection under the law.

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.211
I am also saying

01:03:52.202 --> 01:04:00.251
I am also saying that we have moved rapidly in the direction of that vision over time and prospered mightily with every step we have taken toward it.

01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:09.902
And the obvious productivity and dynamism of our nation that aims to liberate individuals by distributing opportunity as evenly as possible is contagious.

01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:20.035
What succeeded in America caught on, and it spread across the world, because those who saw what it could do wished to duplicate that magic.

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:24.637
People want to live in the West, no matter where they reside.

01:04:25.777 --> 01:04:27.338
The West is not a list of nations.

01:04:27.918 --> 01:04:29.499
It's not a geographic description.

01:04:29.759 --> 01:04:34.301
It's an ideal, the level playing field, and a set of agreements that point toward it.

01:04:34.601 --> 01:04:36.082
And therein lies the rub.

01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:38.783
The agreements are fragile.

01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:46.882
There is progress and backsliding in every society that has joined the experiment, and the West is, at this moment, in grave danger.

01:04:48.003 --> 01:04:55.735
Some force that wishes to rig the world has clearly taken hold and targeted these agreements everywhere they have been embraced.

01:05:04.949 --> 01:05:09.271
In societies with weak constitutions, civil liberties have already given way.

01:05:10.432 --> 01:05:18.415
In the United States, we have one of the strongest constitutions anywhere, and so our descent into tyranny is slower, but there is no time to lose.

01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:26.179
We have to regain control of our system and return to the founders' vision, or we will soon find the opportunity has slipped away.

01:05:26.979 --> 01:05:30.101
We must rescue the republic to save the West.

01:05:43.953 --> 01:05:45.214
But why is this happening?

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:50.196
How has the system of checks and balances that is supposed to protect us been compromised?

01:05:51.276 --> 01:05:53.497
The answer is to be found in biology.

01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:57.259
Our constitutional republic has become senile.

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:06.162
The immunities it once had are gone and it has lost sight of its purpose, all of which has opened it to capture by parasitic and predatory forces.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:11.745
That may seem like an extreme claim, but I believe this is much more than an analogy.

01:06:12.759 --> 01:06:21.987
Creatures get old because evolution has favored numerous characteristics that make them strong when they are young at almost any price so long as it is delayed.

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:27.231
So we grow old and die because all of the delayed costs eventually catch up to us.

01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:32.695
Unfortunately, civilizations have exactly the same defect.

01:06:33.216 --> 01:06:39.581
And those based on free markets in which leaders are elected are likely to be particularly susceptible.

01:06:40.774 --> 01:06:48.557
Politicians and profiteers benefit from thinking on short time horizons, and they generally lose when they think over too long a term.

01:06:49.537 --> 01:06:55.399
All of this short-term problem-solving and kicking the cost can down the road has produced an inevitable crisis.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:01.762
The most powerful society the world has ever known is angry and hopelessly confused.

01:07:02.442 --> 01:07:04.643
It is, in short, demented.

01:07:05.908 --> 01:07:11.532
We are facing the destruction of the West and we cannot afford to return to the dark world that would certainly replace it.

01:07:12.713 --> 01:07:14.375
So how does nature address senility?

01:07:15.475 --> 01:07:16.016
Beautifully.

01:07:17.377 --> 01:07:19.859
It has the perfect remedy at its disposal.

01:07:20.779 --> 01:07:23.281
As we begin to age, we produce offspring.

01:07:23.982 --> 01:07:28.846
Our kids learn that fraction of what we know that still has some use and they abandon the rest.

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:33.962
That pattern of never-ending renewal is the essence of what it means to be human.

01:07:34.562 --> 01:07:41.963
And at first, it leaves us little reason for hope with respect to the failure of the West, because the West is not a creature and it cannot nurture a child.

01:07:42.644 --> 01:07:43.524
So what are we to do?

01:07:45.484 --> 01:07:50.085
When children absorb the content of their culture, it isn't just facts and skills.

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:54.086
The most important things we pass between generations are myths.

01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:59.779
Stories that are so powerfully important, they are encoded in a special, sacred layer.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:10.589
And in our case, the myth we need comes to us from the Greeks, the founders of the ancient West, the one from which the modern West ultimately emerged.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:20.058
It is the story of the phoenix, a mystical bird that instead of making chicks, lights its nest ablaze and raises anew from the ashes.

01:08:21.516 --> 01:08:31.526
Watching the modern West burn, I believe it is no accident that this story points us to a hidden solution, a remedy for which we just so happen to have the ingredients.

01:08:33.268 --> 01:08:40.855
One of our explicit purposes in this gathering was to galvanize the unity movement, bringing representatives together from across the global West.

01:08:41.656 --> 01:08:45.400
And if you will allow me to draw on another myth, I believe our mission will become clear.

01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:50.942
I call the thing that has captured our system Goliath.

01:08:51.642 --> 01:08:54.763
It is the force that prevents all meaningful change.

01:08:55.943 --> 01:09:02.025
In the biblical story, Goliath is a giant, a man, a large man, but a man all the same.

01:09:02.885 --> 01:09:06.866
In our time, Goliath, like everything else, has scaled way up.

01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:14.408
The force that wants us to be terrified to exercise our First Amendment rights in our own capital, that's Goliath.

01:09:15.849 --> 01:09:16.569
Now look around you.

01:09:18.268 --> 01:09:19.369
Do you all see what I see?

01:09:21.009 --> 01:09:22.971
David has scaled up.

01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:24.311
We are David.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.113
We are mighty and our time has come.

01:09:39.983 --> 01:09:42.284
This is straight-up paganism on a Sunday.

01:09:42.324 --> 01:09:43.884
It definitely is led by pagans.

01:09:43.904 --> 01:09:45.205
Now let's put the two myths together.

01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:47.786
Or led by atheists, or led by whatever they are.

01:09:47.826 --> 01:09:49.846
Goliath made a terrible strategic error.

01:09:50.466 --> 01:09:53.627
He is ungodly powerful, but he's dumb as a box of rocks.

01:09:55.008 --> 01:09:56.088
His error was this.

01:09:56.648 --> 01:10:01.970
He terrorized all the competent, courageous people and set about driving them from the institutions.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:07.612
Now they gather in a post-political unity movement and come to know their power.

01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:24.735
We have every single person you could possibly want on our side.

01:10:25.396 --> 01:10:29.422
We have all the courage, all the integrity, and all the know-how.

01:10:35.225 --> 01:10:42.910
OK, I'm going to try and watch Brett till the end, and then I'm going to go off, because I do have to take a voice to the gym.

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:48.793
Then most likely, I'll probably come back and find this stuff still going, and probably put it back on again.

01:10:49.013 --> 01:10:53.876
In 1787, Ben Franklin was asked if the Constitutional Convention had produced a monarchy or a republic.

01:10:53.936 --> 01:10:57.959
And Franklin famously replied, a republic, if you can keep it.

01:10:59.119 --> 01:11:03.002
Today, David and the unity movement face a similar question.

01:11:04.733 --> 01:11:08.256
What we must deliver is a republic, if we can phoenix it.

01:11:09.697 --> 01:11:17.283
I have learned from decades of study of human nature that important concepts emerge independently again and again.

01:11:17.624 --> 01:11:29.914
And so, in closing, I ask you to think about the job we must do to phoenix our republic, the daunting obstacle in our path, Goliath, and the unity movement we bring to the battle, David.

01:11:30.979 --> 01:11:36.441
It is for such moments that the Hopi elders tell us, we are the ones we've been waiting for.

01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:39.601
It could easily be a couple thousand.

01:11:39.621 --> 01:11:41.542
I mean, it's not small, but it's right there.

01:11:41.622 --> 01:11:43.222
That's the whole depth of it.

01:11:43.242 --> 01:11:48.324
I think that's the best shot they can create right now.

01:11:48.384 --> 01:11:51.485
So, you know, it's more than a few hundred, that's for sure.

01:11:51.545 --> 01:11:56.046
It could even be a few thousand for all I can tell, but a couple thousand at most.

01:11:58.074 --> 01:11:59.995
It's not a college football game or something like that.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:02.395
We have to win because we got bread on our side.

01:12:02.415 --> 01:12:05.336
We got bread on our side.

01:12:05.356 --> 01:12:06.797
And we have all you people.

01:12:06.817 --> 01:12:08.097
This is being broadcast all over the world.

01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:09.397
Okay, I think this is where I'm going to cut it.

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:11.078
Thank you very much for seeing me today.

01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:12.718
I'll probably be back again this afternoon.

01:12:12.758 --> 01:12:14.739
Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage is a very funny comedian.

01:12:14.799 --> 01:12:20.500
I don't want to give them too much attention, but I do like to spend time keeping this momentum going.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.762
I will see you again on Monday and the schedule that I'm posting.

01:12:26.762 --> 01:12:34.326
on my website and that's available on stream.gigahome.bio slash home.

01:12:35.406 --> 01:12:37.247
That schedule, we're going to try and stick to it.

01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:45.951
So I hope that will make everybody a little bit easier to follow me and a little bit easier to follow along with the course on Tuesday and Thursday.

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.532
And thanks to everybody scrolling on the screen here.

01:12:47.552 --> 01:12:50.493
If your name is not there and you think it should be, please forgive me and just send me an email.

01:12:56.056 --> 01:13:01.479
and I'm trying to update it regularly to have people that should be there and drop in and drop out.

01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:03.600
But anyway, thanks very much for joining me.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.520
Thanks for being here.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.861
I wish you a great Sunday.

01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:10.323
I hope it's not raining here where you live unless that's what you need.

01:13:10.403 --> 01:13:12.304
And I'll see you guys maybe on a later Sunday.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:12.444
Oops.

01:13:12.464 --> 01:13:12.924
That's where I am.

01:13:12.944 --> 01:13:13.024
And...

01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:24.149
for Donald Trump, which I think is a good thing.

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:30.092
Maybe a round of applause as something.

01:13:30.112 --> 01:13:31.613
I have the article right here.

01:13:32.634 --> 01:13:35.115
Joe Biden has vowed to give every secret service.

01:13:37.176 --> 01:13:39.758
And the books that you can download are all there.

01:13:39.818 --> 01:13:40.918
Those are not my links.

01:13:40.978 --> 01:13:45.641
These are all links that are, you know, privately maintained, but they're good links and I'll replace them if they're not.

01:13:46.601 --> 01:13:53.725
Even Synergetics is there, the Buckminster Fuller book, which is way over our heads, but we're gonna try and do what we can with it.

01:13:53.745 --> 01:14:00.268
There's an archive there and Housatonic Live has a archive on PeerTube as well.

01:14:00.829 --> 01:14:03.850
So this is starting to get a lot of views and that's okay with me.

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:13.335
If it stalls out occasionally, understand that we're trying to troubleshoot that and figure out whether we need to move up to a better machine or whether we need

01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:21.261
Some other tweak to to the current server that we're using So more views the better don't don't worry about it.

01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:21.622
We'll get it.

01:14:21.722 --> 01:14:38.476
We'll get it running smooth if it's not running smooth now Thanks very much again for being here Sorry, I muted him and sorry not sorry And let me see if I can first mute him

01:14:40.183 --> 01:14:43.709
and then say see you later.

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:48.256
Thanks for being here and I'll see you after basketball.

01:15:16.226 --> 01:15:19.397
See you this afternoon again, but just in case, I don't.

01:16:27.857 --> 01:16:49.080
Oops there I go screwing it up Let's see get my cursor up here Exit the screen look over here on peer tube channels I think I put it in the bat cave

01:16:50.788 --> 01:16:53.153
It's there the cartoon elevator pitch.

01:16:53.995 --> 01:16:55.017
That's what you're looking for.

01:16:55.037 --> 01:17:01.271
I think they're a sooth spider thanks very much again guys and See you

01:17:29.341 --> 01:17:30.142
Stop lying!

01:17:31.463 --> 01:17:34.586
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.
