WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.820
Those ordered

00:33.820 --> 00:44.520
ideas that

00:44.520 --> 00:48.220
that's okay should be all right and that was pretty loud, turn my headphones down and a little bit

00:48.220 --> 00:49.660
should be a ride

00:49.660 --> 00:51.660
You

01:19.660 --> 01:21.660
I

01:26.620 --> 01:32.220
Didn't manage to get my date right today. It should say the 12th and it says the 8th. Oh well

01:33.260 --> 01:35.260
one man band

01:36.180 --> 01:39.740
Hello Pamela. Hello everyone. Fletch you are number one on my screen

01:40.980 --> 01:45.980
Congratulations on that number one position. I know it's very coveted. I guess there's thousands of dollars that get

01:46.460 --> 01:52.900
Exchange behind the scenes over who makes it and who doesn't make it as first. So well done

02:07.420 --> 02:12.860
Despite remodeling his studio mark the use of tonic live is still producing videos

02:12.900 --> 02:17.020
Make sure you look at his alternative channels on bit shoot and elsewhere to find these things

02:17.620 --> 02:19.780
Also follow his Twitter if you need some help

02:19.780 --> 02:23.860
But make sure you're not not watching mark because he's still working

02:43.860 --> 02:50.940
The rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish. Let's do it

02:52.100 --> 02:54.540
Sweaty bombs. This is so crazy

02:55.380 --> 03:01.940
Like these bumps. This is so crazy. I feel so nervous like what in the world man

03:13.740 --> 03:15.740
Yeah

03:21.180 --> 03:26.180
Yeah, I'm working on trying to shift off of twitch, so just stay tuned

03:26.180 --> 03:30.620
I don't want to just jump ship because I know a lot of people have

03:31.220 --> 03:36.340
Paid the price of subscribing here, but I do want to announce the fact that I'm probably gonna move

03:36.340 --> 03:40.580
I mean eventually we got to move off of this. It's a pretty bad platform

03:40.580 --> 03:44.580
I mean, I'm completely okay with admitting that

03:45.900 --> 03:51.100
You have been joining us for a while you're here at the top of the wave where we stay focused on the biology

03:51.100 --> 03:55.060
We don't take the bait on TV and in social media and we love our neighbors

03:55.540 --> 03:59.180
Naval if you watch the Super Bowl last name neighbor

04:01.020 --> 04:06.340
And this is how it works there are people that support this stream and they do it by going to giga-home

04:06.660 --> 04:09.580
biological.com and scrolling down to where you can subscribe

04:10.660 --> 04:14.860
and the people that are subscribing are right here and

04:16.660 --> 04:21.740
It's important to see that this is not an updated list because I'm a punk

04:22.980 --> 04:28.660
My wife is doing this stuff and has sent me the email will update it on the evening show or on the morning show tomorrow

04:29.740 --> 04:35.460
As you can see we are trying to shift now to multiple shows during the week during the day

04:36.420 --> 04:41.940
I'm not suggesting by any stretch of the imagination. I'm sorry that it's a little stuttery here. There it goes

04:41.940 --> 04:47.100
I'm not sure that I'm promising a show in the morning and in the evening every day

04:47.100 --> 04:49.100
but what I'm trying to do is

04:49.140 --> 04:52.700
be there more often and more often during the day because

04:53.300 --> 04:55.300
Although I work during the day

04:55.620 --> 05:00.420
It's also a better time for me to stream from the perspective of being available and flexible

05:00.740 --> 05:02.740
and being able to do it regularly

05:03.060 --> 05:05.660
And that's the goal is regular student now

05:06.420 --> 05:13.100
Because we want to establish an independent bright web of sort a place where people can go and find you know

05:13.620 --> 05:17.460
An objective take on things rather than something that's sponsored

05:17.940 --> 05:24.980
Rather than that's something that's influenced by who my sponsors are who I wear my loyalties lie

05:24.980 --> 05:28.620
I mean that could have already been even distorted from the perspective of

05:29.340 --> 05:31.340
Let's say

05:31.740 --> 05:37.580
Let's say that could have even been distorted from the perspective of me working for for a CHD

05:37.580 --> 05:39.580
And so we're really trying to

05:40.100 --> 05:48.460
to emphasize the fact that giga-owned biological is indeed as independent as we get flying on on fumes basically and

05:49.060 --> 05:52.260
That's part of the reason why I haven't been able to be on daily daily daily

05:52.260 --> 05:58.220
is because I still need to shuffle around in the background until we get a certain number of subscribers and and

05:58.860 --> 06:05.340
That means sometimes consulting and sometimes helping out with letter writing or anything where I can get an extra and extra

06:05.340 --> 06:06.540
A few bucks

06:06.540 --> 06:09.500
And so I did do a lot of that work over the weekend

06:09.500 --> 06:16.380
But it is Monday the 12th and we're right back here trying to fight this idea that that those

06:16.940 --> 06:24.540
Who are manipulating us have this unseen mechanism. It's an unseen mechanism that has actually you know the idea

06:24.540 --> 06:32.540
The idea is to convince the young people of the world that this is something that's just recently become

06:33.180 --> 06:34.700
available to them

06:34.700 --> 06:40.540
It's something that's just recently a technique that's being applied and they still have a chance to escape it

06:40.540 --> 06:45.500
And I think it's very important to to emphasize the fact that

06:46.140 --> 06:50.140
This is indeed not the case that actually the

06:50.780 --> 06:57.260
Unseen manipulation of our habits and our opinions has been going on for decades and it's only become

06:58.060 --> 07:04.700
Weaponized in a new level militarized in a new level because it has been prioritized

07:05.260 --> 07:07.500
as a national security priority the

07:08.540 --> 07:15.740
Organized control of our habits and our opinions is an is a national security priority at this stage

07:16.620 --> 07:20.860
They need us to believe what they want us to believe and the

07:21.820 --> 07:27.740
The bureaucracy became convinced of this quite some time ago that it was better for the american public

07:27.820 --> 07:32.140
Not to really know the truth about much of anything and that way they would be the most easy to govern

07:32.700 --> 07:36.620
This is a principle that although has been

07:38.940 --> 07:44.620
Widely applied for decades. It's not something that has become so blatantly obvious as during the pandemic

07:44.620 --> 07:48.220
And that's where this whole narrative is tumbled out of control for them

07:48.860 --> 07:55.340
That's where this whole narrative is tumbled out of control and where I think your own biological finds we find ourselves

07:55.900 --> 07:58.780
is fighting this this concept that

07:59.340 --> 08:07.340
We have any more informed consent that anyone is looking out for our informed consent our rights and anyone is protecting our sovereignty

08:07.340 --> 08:09.340
This is an illusion

08:09.340 --> 08:13.420
And it wasn't illusion already before the pandemic, but it was a much more subtle illusion

08:13.500 --> 08:15.020
It wasn't something

08:15.020 --> 08:17.020
That they stood upon

08:17.020 --> 08:20.220
It was something that everybody knew in the background, but often didn't act on

08:21.340 --> 08:28.220
And now we're seeing the overt application of this governance system on every front and on every angle

08:28.620 --> 08:30.140
And this pivot

08:30.140 --> 08:35.100
Because they didn't get us all on board with the fear uncertainty and doubt of worst case scenario

08:35.100 --> 08:38.620
This pivot is awkward and this pivot is off balance

08:39.100 --> 08:40.620
And so now we have

08:40.620 --> 08:46.460
A western civilization with multiple factions inside of it with different understandings of what's going on

08:46.940 --> 08:52.140
And while this could still be very useful to the people who want to fragment western civilization and

08:52.620 --> 08:56.060
Replace it with a totalitarian global governance system

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
It's only useful from the

09:00.140 --> 09:02.860
From the outside perspective on the inside it's already done

09:03.740 --> 09:05.740
The financial system is already in place

09:05.820 --> 09:08.540
The the legislation is already in place

09:09.180 --> 09:11.180
The people are already in place

09:11.660 --> 09:17.740
And so it's just a matter of time all this stuff in my humble opinion that's going on with the farmers in europe is just gassing

09:17.820 --> 09:18.780
It's just

09:18.780 --> 09:23.340
Exhaust, you know, it's it's let them get their energy out let them burn all their money

09:23.980 --> 09:30.700
Let them spend all of their money on on running those those tractors and and not being at home during the winter

09:30.780 --> 09:32.140
That's fine

09:32.140 --> 09:35.900
We can let them do that and the the controllers of this don't mind

09:36.460 --> 09:38.460
I know it's important

09:38.620 --> 09:43.020
But I need us to start to realize that if we're going to do this realistically

09:43.500 --> 09:47.580
Whatever we're seeing on the internet and whatever is happening on the internet is not enough

09:48.220 --> 09:50.220
And in fact, we are being shown it

09:50.940 --> 09:54.940
Give us a false sense that there are a number of people acting and maybe we ourselves

09:55.500 --> 09:58.540
Don't have to step away from our toaster ovens and do anything about it

09:58.540 --> 10:02.540
Maybe we can just hope that there will be enough people that stand up for us

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
And that's all this is about

10:05.180 --> 10:09.900
Because the standing up of farmers in the EU is irrelevant the EU is gone

10:10.460 --> 10:16.780
The legislation is already in place. The control is already there. They can't do anything by parking a bunch of

10:18.060 --> 10:20.540
Of tractors in different places or spraying

10:21.260 --> 10:22.220
Um

10:22.220 --> 10:26.940
Manure in different they're not going to change anything with that they need to elect people

10:27.740 --> 10:31.340
And those people need to change things and if they're not going to elect people

10:31.660 --> 10:36.860
But they're just going to park tractors all over the place then they're wasting an enormous amount of energy

10:36.940 --> 10:38.940
They should be better off at home

10:39.260 --> 10:45.260
Having regular meetings to make sure that all of the people that they want in office are in office next time and instead

10:45.260 --> 10:51.180
What are they doing with this money and these resources? I'm afraid this is a great big disaster over there

10:52.060 --> 10:54.060
But I don't know because I live in america

10:54.860 --> 11:01.180
Where we have been victimized by what i'm characterizing is a team worst case scenario people that have been recruited

11:01.740 --> 11:03.740
People that are unwitting participants

11:04.300 --> 11:10.860
People that are actually actors for the national security exercise or national security live exercise

11:11.420 --> 11:13.420
That is the pandemic

11:13.420 --> 11:19.100
And whether or not it's been officially declared over it doesn't matter because behind the scenes is operating this

11:19.740 --> 11:26.780
Other sort of governance system that is very difficult to characterize but is often mischaracterized as the department of defense

11:27.580 --> 11:32.460
And the department of defense is doing all of this is a horrible mischaracterization of what's going on here

11:32.940 --> 11:36.140
Because it is actually health and human services in the executive branch

11:36.540 --> 11:41.500
And if there is any dod participation it is because of the oversight on the dod

11:42.060 --> 11:43.580
That these other

11:44.140 --> 11:47.180
I'm sorry executive branch organizations have

11:47.740 --> 11:52.860
And the control that they have over the dod as a result of being part of the executive branch

11:53.820 --> 11:58.300
And this this is a careful careful distortion that actually again

11:59.180 --> 12:04.140
Allows the facilitation of the repeating of the worst case scenario narrative but without an accurate

12:04.940 --> 12:09.020
depiction of how the worst case scenario would have been enacted on us and it would have been in

12:09.500 --> 12:13.900
Health and human services centered executive branch centered operation

12:14.380 --> 12:17.420
Even if the dod was used and that needs to be

12:18.060 --> 12:23.500
Firmly understood because the dod is not an organization that operates on its own. It's just not

12:25.020 --> 12:30.140
And we need that to be understood from a patriotic perspective so that we aren't out there

12:30.780 --> 12:38.780
Saying things that in essence undermine the real hierarchy and the real potential patriotic foundation of our america

12:39.180 --> 12:45.740
Which is the the armed forces which are all these people who have dedicated their lives to the service of our country

12:47.100 --> 12:53.420
So be very careful about this the way that this narrative is being told and i'm not suggesting to you at all the darpa and barta

12:53.420 --> 12:58.780
And all these other organizations ditra are not involved of course they are but they're all under the auspicious

12:59.340 --> 13:04.380
Of health and human services and under the executive branch and the the actual

13:05.020 --> 13:08.060
Authority lies there not in some dod office

13:09.820 --> 13:11.340
And

13:11.340 --> 13:15.420
In reality the buck always stops with the executive branch as far as the dod goes

13:15.420 --> 13:17.420
So that argument doesn't hold water

13:17.500 --> 13:21.580
Especially in light of the trump administration and the biden administration and all of the

13:22.060 --> 13:26.300
The shenanigans that we know that went on with both of those and the transition. So here we are

13:27.740 --> 13:33.100
With a group of people that i think is aptly characterized as team worst case scenario still leading

13:33.500 --> 13:39.980
A dissonant narrative that's causing an illusion of consensus that has most of the people on the planet convinced that they

13:40.540 --> 13:45.420
Are starting to understand what happened and that they finally solved the mystery for themselves

13:45.420 --> 13:48.060
They've even learned a little virology and it feels great

13:49.980 --> 13:56.460
And now they have this righteous anger for the arrogance of the united states and for the arrogance of

13:57.020 --> 14:02.620
Of the out of control nature of the american enterprise and it's just

14:03.100 --> 14:06.780
It's just a absolutely ludicrous mythology that is based on

14:07.340 --> 14:09.660
You being tricked into solving a mystery

14:10.700 --> 14:16.940
And feeling like you've unmasked the bad guys or watched it happen with these intrepid reporters and these people who were being

14:17.260 --> 14:22.540
Whistle blowers and none of them none of them none of them have ever gotten to the stage where they are willing to say

14:22.940 --> 14:28.620
That intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

14:29.660 --> 14:31.660
Because this whole

14:31.660 --> 14:37.980
Charade is designed to permanently preserve this mythology to make sure that we

14:38.620 --> 14:43.020
Wittingly or unwittingly pass this mythology of vaccination and

14:43.660 --> 14:47.900
Pandemic potential onto our children so that they can be governed by it forever

14:48.620 --> 14:54.220
So that they will surrender the sovereignty of their their bodies over to the state as part of this

14:55.660 --> 14:59.260
Weird neo-communistic idea that we should all give up our

14:59.820 --> 15:01.820
Biology so that we can figure it out

15:03.180 --> 15:06.860
That the sacred can be dismissed that there is no sacred

15:08.940 --> 15:13.660
And I think there's a lot of waking up to be done here in america a lot of waking up that

15:14.460 --> 15:18.380
I'm still hesitating on when to drop some of these nuclear bombs these

15:19.180 --> 15:22.460
Cognitive nuclear bombs that's what they are if you start to really

15:23.260 --> 15:29.020
See the system for what it is see the patterns for what they are and look backwards in history and see everything line up

15:29.020 --> 15:31.020
The way that it does

15:33.260 --> 15:39.660
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent in any of the people that we're working in a molecular biology space or an academic

15:40.460 --> 15:42.000
Biology space where they were using

15:42.000 --> 15:48.540
Transfection regularly in any of their animal models or any of their their their disease models should have done known better

15:48.620 --> 15:50.620
That's absolutely certain

15:52.540 --> 15:55.820
And that's the one sort of thing that I got right from the very beginning

15:55.900 --> 15:59.500
Absolutely right from the very beginning as soon as I saw that they were going to use

15:59.740 --> 16:03.660
Transfection and we're calling it an investigational vaccine. I stood on the roof

16:05.580 --> 16:12.700
Whether or not I got the gain of function mythology right off the bat is a whole nother story and i'm totally ashamed of that but

16:14.140 --> 16:20.220
Transfection I knew from the very beginning and I spoke out from the very beginning and that's what originally got my tires flat

16:22.060 --> 16:25.260
But now we're four years into this and my

16:26.060 --> 16:27.500
Professional

16:27.500 --> 16:28.620
Whatever

16:28.620 --> 16:36.140
Independence and and my independent existence during the pandemic has has evolved from being an advisor to Robert F

16:36.140 --> 16:39.580
Kennedy jr. On a book called the Wuhan cover-up where I put a lot of the

16:40.140 --> 16:44.620
Biology of RNA viruses in there that is not in every other book

16:45.340 --> 16:48.380
And I even got a paper in there from 2019

16:48.540 --> 16:50.060
um

16:50.060 --> 16:57.500
Where a postdoc of Ralph Barrick and cena bivari talk about a pandemic from a coronavirus from a bat cave that needs room

16:57.660 --> 16:59.660
Dezavir and it's coming soon

17:00.940 --> 17:02.300
And so

17:02.300 --> 17:09.900
After that I got hired by chd for six short months before I was let go again because of some amorphous thing that I said on my podcast

17:09.900 --> 17:12.780
That was unacceptable that interfered with the

17:13.580 --> 17:18.220
How show how did they say it the interfered with chd and their partners

17:19.420 --> 17:26.140
Um, so who knows maybe I was not selling enough of the Wuhan cover-up or I was damaging the sales of

17:27.100 --> 17:30.380
Robert Malone's book that's also sold by children's health defense

17:31.660 --> 17:33.660
And their book moniker with with

17:34.540 --> 17:36.540
Skyhorse I don't know what happened

17:36.540 --> 17:41.660
But I do know that the spread of bad ideas is much scarier than the spread of any RNA molecule

17:42.140 --> 17:46.460
And me teaching this seems to annoy everyone and it doesn't matter on what side you're on

17:47.500 --> 17:53.260
If you're on the side of a of no virus, you don't like me if you're on the side of children's health

17:53.820 --> 17:55.340
defense

17:55.340 --> 17:59.260
Book sales committee or on their management apparently you don't like me

18:00.460 --> 18:04.860
As far as I know brian hooker thought I was fantastic and a great colleague as far as I know

18:04.860 --> 18:08.620
Most of the people that I worked with at chd were just absolutely thrilled

18:09.180 --> 18:12.060
That I got the job there, but somehow or another in

18:13.660 --> 18:15.660
In less than an hour

18:15.660 --> 18:18.860
Um, I went from being that to being out

18:20.140 --> 18:22.780
Um, and I don't think that the way it went

18:23.500 --> 18:29.100
Suggests that very many people were involved because again, how many times do I need to say it? How hard is it to sabotage?

18:29.900 --> 18:35.180
A fair tug of war with 20 against 20 only one or two people need to fake it

18:35.260 --> 18:41.020
And that will be a sabotage to tug of war and so in chd you only have to have one or two

18:41.660 --> 18:45.980
Saboteurs you only have to have one or two people with ulterior motives that occasionally

18:46.620 --> 18:50.300
Just keep chd from doing any major

18:51.500 --> 18:54.140
You know good from completing any major

18:54.940 --> 18:59.660
Goals or wasting a tremendous amount of money and not doing as much as they could with it

19:00.220 --> 19:01.900
That's all you need

19:01.980 --> 19:09.340
And so I almost guarantee you that chd has always had people like that trying to infiltrate that organization in order to bring it down

19:10.940 --> 19:16.780
I wonder if this is the first time that they've had to throw somebody out because they were going to be too effective or they were

19:16.780 --> 19:22.140
Going to have too much influence on the total organization for them to be controllable

19:23.820 --> 19:27.180
Because um, you know, this is where we are

19:28.140 --> 19:31.580
We are fighting against an organized group of

19:33.020 --> 19:35.020
mismedlers that I

19:35.020 --> 19:39.900
I know that some of the people that follow this dream don't like me to say it, but they are committed to lying

19:40.540 --> 19:42.700
And it's that simple

19:42.700 --> 19:47.100
And it's just hard for people to get their head around the spectacular commitment that

19:47.820 --> 19:51.100
That got us here. It's just a spectacular commitment to lying

19:51.580 --> 19:53.580
And

19:53.580 --> 19:57.660
It doesn't need to be any more than that. It doesn't need to be elaborate

19:58.300 --> 20:03.340
Biotechnology, it doesn't need to be elaborate schemes. It doesn't need to be elaborate cover-ups

20:04.380 --> 20:07.660
It just needs to be a spectacular commitment to lying about it

20:09.180 --> 20:15.260
And that alone will be enough to propel the uncertainty and doubt the actual fear of this

20:15.980 --> 20:17.980
The

20:17.980 --> 20:22.060
The fear of the the gain of function virus, right? This

20:22.700 --> 20:30.540
This thing that now Charles rixie and kevin mccurnan apparently gagrion is that bioweapons don't aim for mortality. They aim to maim

20:31.260 --> 20:34.940
And to far more economic destruction than rapid death

20:35.260 --> 20:41.660
And he even cites charles rixie as a guy who knows all about this this incapacitating agent, right?

20:42.220 --> 20:49.420
And he also cites curiously enough the the federation of american scientists one of the absolute biggest jokes

20:49.980 --> 20:53.580
Of an organization that has ever been created in recent memory

20:54.700 --> 21:03.020
That was all on board for the entire duration of 2020 and 2021 on every major nonsensical thing including masks

21:03.100 --> 21:08.460
Lockdowns and the vaccines and and oh we better be careful the vaccine hesitancy the whole thing

21:09.260 --> 21:11.260
And

21:11.260 --> 21:14.620
This is very extraordinary because this is a guy that has talked to

21:15.820 --> 21:17.820
Jessica hawkett and

21:17.820 --> 21:19.340
and

21:19.340 --> 21:25.260
And jonathan angler about some of the data in new york city and in italy and had a hard time processing that there may not have been

21:25.260 --> 21:30.780
The pandemic that he thought he used to work for the cdc. He's a very interestingly open-minded fella

21:31.580 --> 21:37.180
Here he is questioning who's charles rixie and why should he be credible and he's being responded to by kevin mccurnan

21:37.260 --> 21:42.780
Who is citing charles rixie the guy who used to work with me had chd before he got fired

21:43.580 --> 21:47.740
By chd for not talking to bobby on the phone and for having

21:49.340 --> 21:51.340
a laptop with a

21:51.340 --> 21:57.580
A a confidential document open with kevin mccaren in the room in a in a hotel room

21:59.580 --> 22:01.580
While he was in the states

22:02.140 --> 22:04.140
randomly

22:04.220 --> 22:10.620
And that's what he got fired for and it's just crazy to think that that guy is now being cited by that guy

22:14.140 --> 22:17.900
And and what where what does this really mean? What does it mean if the guy who?

22:18.460 --> 22:25.260
Took drastic that's that's an organization of anonymous foreigners and gave them the diffuse proposal that was leaked to him

22:25.820 --> 22:32.700
Gave the diffuse proposal to a bunch of anonymous foreigners instead of i don't know turning it into the state department or to

22:33.020 --> 22:35.820
the government or to how about senator ron johnson

22:38.220 --> 22:41.900
How about anyone besides a bunch of people on twitter

22:43.260 --> 22:49.980
He's connected to kevin mccaren who's connected to paul katrel to the very beginning of the pandemic who's connected to adi ads

22:49.980 --> 22:58.220
Who's connected to george web george web says paul katrel is a hero and millions were killed by a bio weapon is what bio is what rixie sells

22:59.020 --> 23:00.540
on

23:00.540 --> 23:06.540
The other hand on the other side of this little coin we have kevin mccurnan who you know is just thinks that i'm a clown because i've

23:06.540 --> 23:11.100
Been talking about infectious clones as if they might be an important methodology and he doesn't think so

23:12.300 --> 23:15.740
Whose dad was in to micro RNAs at the very very start

23:16.220 --> 23:23.580
Who who cut his teeth in the human genome project and then went in at all in on a company afterward with his brothers at the ha at the helm

23:24.540 --> 23:28.700
And his father and and even eric lander to do

23:29.740 --> 23:34.540
PCR and to do dna production for hiv testing

23:36.220 --> 23:39.260
And now he's currently defending virology as a whole

23:40.060 --> 23:47.340
There's nothing wrong with it. The sequence has proved the pandemic and he's citing the biggest joke of scientific organizations ever

23:48.140 --> 23:55.500
Not the american academy of science is not not science magazine or anything, you know, I don't know what you would cite but but

23:56.300 --> 24:02.700
Really the fas check that organization out and tell me you think that that's a real a real

24:03.660 --> 24:05.500
think tank

24:05.500 --> 24:08.060
Think tank with a small t that's for sure

24:09.500 --> 24:13.020
So this is where we are the show is going on. This is a guy with

24:13.660 --> 24:17.660
30,000 followers or so that's a guy with lots of followers and they're just

24:18.780 --> 24:22.460
Performing the worst case scenario. Just keep acting it out

24:24.460 --> 24:32.140
That it was a bioweapon that they meant to do it that it spread everywhere because it's so contagious because that fear and cleavage site makes it magical

24:33.580 --> 24:40.380
That there's proofreading in coronavirus is therefore five years from a point makes sense and it's just absurd

24:41.340 --> 24:45.580
You can argue about the swarm and whether the swarm is as deep as we thought it was or not

24:45.580 --> 24:48.380
It doesn't matter. RNA doesn't copy like DNA done

24:50.940 --> 24:57.580
There's a million things wrong with with with the assumption that an RNA molecule that started in a puddle in Wuhan

24:57.580 --> 25:03.020
Is spreader all around the world even if it started a little earlier. There's a million things wrong with that and they all know it

25:04.140 --> 25:07.420
Because there's just this is just a spectacular commitment to lies

25:10.380 --> 25:12.380
I

25:13.500 --> 25:16.940
Should really say lies instead of bad ideas, you know

25:17.340 --> 25:22.780
The spread of lies is much scarier than and dangerous than the spread of any RNA molecule. That's really what this is

25:22.860 --> 25:24.860
It's the spread of lies

25:24.860 --> 25:26.860
Because if you don't know that these things

25:27.260 --> 25:30.300
Aren't real then you're spreading things. You shouldn't be spreading anyway

25:31.020 --> 25:34.940
And that's what teamwork case scenario is all about. So I've been promising for a while

25:35.900 --> 25:39.420
um to try and tap into this originally and I think

25:40.220 --> 25:42.220
I'm saying that I'm going to go to

25:42.700 --> 25:48.140
Farewell to virology and and and this other stuff. I think I need to go back back farther

25:48.220 --> 25:52.300
And so today I wanted to take the time to go back far enough so that we're really

25:53.100 --> 25:55.580
um way before the pandemic way before

25:56.540 --> 25:58.540
Flew all this stuff. We need to go

25:58.780 --> 26:04.380
Really back to what I think where the the heart of this all starts where the heart of all this lying starts

26:04.860 --> 26:08.780
Where all of these people happen to be in the same place at the same time

26:09.660 --> 26:13.340
Where Robert Malone was kind of working in the background and a lot of these other

26:13.820 --> 26:19.820
Virologists and immunologists and vaccinologists were cutting their teeth in the background at this time that are now

26:20.300 --> 26:22.700
Between 50 and 70 years old these people

26:24.940 --> 26:31.260
We need to go all the way back to the the original the original debate and that original debate is hiv

26:32.620 --> 26:34.620
So let's do that

26:39.420 --> 26:41.420
You

26:41.420 --> 26:43.420
You

26:43.420 --> 26:45.420
You

26:45.420 --> 26:47.420
You

27:08.780 --> 27:12.300
You speak of this out of the case in in australia

27:12.540 --> 27:18.220
Yeah, well in australia, there was a man who it's claimed infected three women

27:18.780 --> 27:21.660
And I think one woman died in the defense of the man

27:22.380 --> 27:25.580
I don't know if I don't know the details if he did it delivered if he knew

27:26.140 --> 27:28.700
I don't want to get into that and what the punishment should be

27:29.340 --> 27:30.620
Interesting

27:30.620 --> 27:37.660
I find it interesting that very much like tony fauci he has a wall of pictures of his own accomplishments and his own things

27:38.540 --> 27:44.140
I like a selfie like everybody else does, but this is a little different because this is camera days

27:44.220 --> 27:46.220
You know, there's a little more work involved

27:47.740 --> 27:51.900
You know and they're all framed. It's not on his phone or something like that. So this is a very much

27:53.020 --> 27:56.860
You know proud of himself kind of wall and it's okay to have one of those walls

27:56.940 --> 27:58.940
I guess but I don't have one of those walls

27:59.500 --> 28:01.500
I got my kids on the wall

28:01.580 --> 28:03.580
But uh, I don't have anything

28:04.460 --> 28:08.780
The only thing I have on my wall actually in this room that has anything to do with me is my phd

28:09.500 --> 28:12.780
Um diploma and it's right next to my wife's phd diploma

28:12.780 --> 28:17.500
It's not like I have them up there specifically because we met in amsterdam and it reminds me of her not because

28:17.980 --> 28:22.140
And I don't have them back there, you know, so you can see them. I have them there's actually so I can see them

28:22.780 --> 28:25.260
so that I can remember where this all started when we just

28:26.460 --> 28:28.460
were two innocent kids

28:28.460 --> 28:31.740
meeting on the street in amsterdam at at 20 something

28:31.900 --> 28:33.340
um

28:33.340 --> 28:37.820
When amsterdam was still the coolest city in the world. So it to me, it's very striking. Sorry

28:37.820 --> 28:41.340
I'm interrupting already, but I just think it's really it is striking to me that

28:41.980 --> 28:48.780
It doesn't it's not surprising. It's just noticeable. But the question is is his defense was an absurdity

28:49.340 --> 28:51.340
but uh the virus

28:52.140 --> 28:53.820
didn't exist

28:53.820 --> 28:56.940
The biggest problem with the HIV theory of AIDS is HIV

28:57.740 --> 29:03.980
There is a group of AIDS denialists that say that HIV does not exist and has never been isolated

29:04.540 --> 29:06.860
Which is as bizarre as it gets

29:07.340 --> 29:11.180
You and your colleagues not only state that HIV does not cause AIDS

29:11.260 --> 29:15.820
But you take an even greater leap and say HIV does not exist. Is that correct?

29:16.540 --> 29:18.540
Oh, it is partly correct

29:18.620 --> 29:21.660
We do not say that HIV doesn't exist

29:22.300 --> 29:27.180
It may exist but the presently available data does not prove its existence

29:27.660 --> 29:29.500
But how can you say that

29:29.500 --> 29:34.220
When world-renowned scientists like dr. Gallo and dr. Fauci say HIV does exist

29:34.700 --> 29:37.100
Are you telling me in the world that they're all wrong?

29:38.460 --> 29:45.340
What I what we're saying is there is the evidence there that data in the scientific literature which is published

29:46.060 --> 29:52.540
Scientists interpreted data differently and who interpreted evidence one way and they interpreted in a different way

29:53.340 --> 29:58.460
So in our view the evidence does not prove the existence of HIV

30:16.300 --> 30:20.300
We've all seen pictures. We've seen electron micrographs of HIV

30:20.940 --> 30:23.980
How can you say something that we see isn't there?

30:24.140 --> 30:26.860
You didn't see electron micrograph of HIV

30:27.420 --> 30:33.180
What we see is electron micrograph of particles which look like retroviruses

30:33.740 --> 30:37.740
But uh, it's one thing to look like and another thing is to be a virus

30:38.620 --> 30:44.060
The one thing I don't understand is how can you question the existence of a virus when there was an international lawsuit

30:44.700 --> 30:48.860
Against the united states government and robert gallo for stealing the french virus

30:49.660 --> 30:53.340
I mean, it seems to me there must be a virus there if somebody stole it

30:54.380 --> 30:57.100
That's the problem and then no circumstances

30:58.380 --> 31:00.380
robert gallo who have stolen

31:01.020 --> 31:07.420
Monterneas virus even if there was such a virus because what montanea sent to gallo was

31:08.220 --> 31:10.780
Um supernatives from his cultures

31:11.500 --> 31:16.380
And in the supernate and the virus says don't last for too long

31:17.100 --> 31:19.100
and in fact the

31:20.060 --> 31:22.060
The particles have to have

31:22.540 --> 31:27.660
Knobs on their or spikes on their surface to be infectious

31:28.380 --> 31:31.660
And these knobs are lost and in fact

31:32.060 --> 31:37.020
Nobody has proven that they exist but even if they exist on HIV or the particles

31:37.260 --> 31:41.260
They're lost very rapidly. So it is impossible for montaneaes

31:41.900 --> 31:43.900
for uh to have

31:44.060 --> 31:46.940
For gallo to have stolen a virus from montanea

31:47.980 --> 31:54.620
And so I would say that right here we're already at sort of a first sort of inkling into what i'm

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
Suggesting is happening here

31:58.300 --> 32:04.060
So hiv hasn't been proven to exist the lawsuit equals virus exists is what the guy asks her

32:04.060 --> 32:06.060
But of course we know that that's wrong

32:06.300 --> 32:08.300
um, but that's the sort of

32:08.300 --> 32:11.100
the sort of way that that he approaches the question but

32:11.740 --> 32:18.380
They couldn't steal the virus because in the supernatant viruses don't last they lose their knobs. I apologize. I'm writing with this

32:18.940 --> 32:20.060
this

32:20.060 --> 32:24.460
This pen I can't correct that but they lose their knobs, which is I can't think it's kind of funny

32:24.540 --> 32:28.860
They lose their spike proteins is what she means. They lose their knobs. It's funny though because

32:29.500 --> 32:32.300
What she's suggesting is is that they're not culturable

32:33.100 --> 32:38.940
That they they can't sustain whatever they pass along in the supernatant can't be sustained

32:39.340 --> 32:41.900
The viruses don't last now. I don't know why it is

32:42.700 --> 32:44.940
If it's because they lose their knobs or what it is

32:45.420 --> 32:47.420
The point is is that

32:47.420 --> 32:51.180
Just like with corona viruses the same problem exists here

32:51.660 --> 32:58.780
Back with hiv and that problem is is that when you pass these viruses along in the way that you're supposed to do it

32:59.740 --> 33:04.460
Which is the supernatant right if the cells that are stuck to the dish

33:05.100 --> 33:08.460
Are producing viruses and they're being released like the cartoons

33:09.020 --> 33:15.580
Then the viruses that they release should be in the supernatant in the in the solution above the cell culture

33:16.780 --> 33:21.740
But she's making the argument right here that they've always known that they don't have really good

33:22.700 --> 33:26.540
replication competent viruses in that supernatant interesting, isn't it?

33:27.500 --> 33:29.580
Very very interesting, isn't it?

33:30.220 --> 33:34.540
So they have exosomes they can find exosomes they can find signals

33:35.500 --> 33:39.020
Of the RNA being packaged into the exosomes, but they can't find

33:39.740 --> 33:44.780
The knobs meaning that and also meaning that this they can't infect other cells. They can't

33:45.420 --> 33:47.420
Move on. They're not infectious

33:48.220 --> 33:54.700
And so this is still the primitive understanding of what the spike proteins do or don't do in these exosomes or in these particles

33:55.420 --> 33:58.300
But it's very curious already that the establishment of

33:58.940 --> 34:06.460
If you do it like the cartoons and take the supernatant off you are left with almost an entirely incompetent fraction of particles

34:08.620 --> 34:13.900
And so it's not just with coronaviruses, but it's with many of these RNA viruses

34:13.900 --> 34:17.260
So just keep that in mind as we move forward

34:19.500 --> 34:21.900
So can you prove to me that HIV doesn't exist

34:22.140 --> 34:24.140
I

34:24.140 --> 34:30.700
Can I can show you what the evidence shows what what montanea for example presented

34:31.180 --> 34:34.700
Because everybody except that montanea is the discover of HIV

34:35.260 --> 34:42.140
And I can show you the evidence which montanea presented and claims to have proven the existence of HIV

34:42.380 --> 34:49.020
And I will explain to you why montanea evidence does not prove the existence of HIV

34:49.660 --> 34:53.420
Let's do it. I'm ready

34:57.500 --> 35:02.540
And so what do we mean by virus isolation or virus pure in my humble opinion

35:02.540 --> 35:09.180
This is the most revealing video that you will ever see that tells you exactly how much commitment how much

35:09.820 --> 35:18.380
Spectacular commitment to lying is going on these next 15 minutes if you've never seen them are going to actually blow your mind

35:19.980 --> 35:21.980
Okay

35:27.740 --> 35:31.580
What do we mean by virus isolation or virus purification

35:33.340 --> 35:39.660
These are jargon words in virology and they're not very precise

35:39.660 --> 35:42.220
They mean different things to different people

35:42.860 --> 35:46.060
Now dr. Gallo and dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification

35:46.540 --> 35:48.460
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

35:49.740 --> 35:59.020
Understand this is the man who figured out how to make infectious clones and he made infectious clone of the poliovirus with vincent rants rack and yellow

35:59.980 --> 36:04.940
Understand that this is the man who got the Nobel Prize for reverse transcriptase

36:08.140 --> 36:15.260
Understand that this is the man who formulated the entire our entire understanding of how genomes

36:16.140 --> 36:18.620
Of viruses are organized

36:19.500 --> 36:23.660
Based on the way that you get to messenger RNA

36:25.260 --> 36:32.620
That whole concept of there being all these viruses with all these different kinds of genomes requiring all these different kinds of infectious cycles

36:33.100 --> 36:35.100
and and with or with not

36:35.260 --> 36:36.300
uh

36:36.300 --> 36:41.260
RNA dependent RNA polymerases etc. This all scheme was designed by this guy

36:41.740 --> 36:45.580
Who who is credited for discovering reverse transcriptase

36:46.220 --> 36:53.500
And who's responsible for the methodology of clones which we're supposed to believe are just the same as regular viruses

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
It's just you know, you do it a different way

36:56.700 --> 37:02.220
According to the according to the guy who worked for the human genome project before he finished grad school

37:02.620 --> 37:08.220
And then started a company with his brothers and his father and eric lander on testing hiv

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
When he was like 20 something

37:14.540 --> 37:19.580
And now after all of this success decades of working with the department of energy

37:20.220 --> 37:28.060
And and with with biotech companies and and working on ip and being able to afford a house on the atlantic ocean in boston

37:28.460 --> 37:33.580
That guy wastes his time tweeting about me and calling me a monkey

37:34.860 --> 37:40.940
On twitter instead of just ignoring me instead of just moving on and alerting the united states to the

37:41.340 --> 37:46.780
double-stranded dna contamination in the shots and starting a nationwide campaign to stop

37:47.260 --> 37:51.500
Transfection he spends more time telling people not to pay attention to me

37:51.900 --> 37:56.940
Then he does campaigning for the double-stranded dna contamination that he's supposedly found

37:59.180 --> 38:06.140
And he spends no time at all clarifying that he spoke out against the pcr and he spoke out against the RNA purity and he spoke out against

38:06.140 --> 38:08.140
All these other things for three years

38:08.700 --> 38:13.260
He's got more time for me than he does for

38:15.020 --> 38:21.900
Saving the planet he does a few podcasts where he repeats that there's double this is the key right here listen

38:23.660 --> 38:26.380
Because this guy has been there since the very beginning

38:26.860 --> 38:34.380
People like robert malone look up to this guy people like kevin mccurnan look up to this guy people like eric lander look up to this guy

38:38.220 --> 38:41.900
And if this guy is spectacularly committed to a lie, then what do we have?

38:43.260 --> 38:45.260
What do we have here?

38:45.260 --> 38:47.260
unwitting participants

38:50.940 --> 38:52.940
People that are just fooled

38:55.180 --> 38:58.620
Or do we have people that are participating in the way that we are governed

38:59.660 --> 39:01.180
Through these lies

39:01.180 --> 39:03.180
That's what you need to ask yourself now

39:03.340 --> 39:09.340
And you need to ask this seriously if you're really trying to save your kids and your grandkids because it might not help us

39:11.420 --> 39:15.340
We might have to pay a pretty harsh price as we try to

39:16.460 --> 39:22.700
Save our kids from this mythology that these people are responsible for listen carefully to this man speak

39:23.260 --> 39:25.580
And see if you think he is being genuine

39:26.060 --> 39:29.180
Do you think that he is genuine about his love of biology?

39:29.180 --> 39:34.700
Do you think he's genuine about his fascination for the molecular world that underpins

39:35.580 --> 39:37.580
Biology do you think?

39:37.580 --> 39:42.540
Let me tell me what you think after you see this video. There's isolation or virus purification

39:43.260 --> 39:44.300
um

39:44.300 --> 39:50.620
These are jargon words in virology and they're not very precise

39:50.620 --> 39:53.180
They mean different things to different people

39:53.740 --> 39:59.340
Now dr. Gallo and dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification. Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

40:01.180 --> 40:03.180
Isolate what was it?

40:05.100 --> 40:07.100
Of the virus? Yes

40:07.420 --> 40:09.420
Well you isolate a virus by

40:12.460 --> 40:14.460
Um

40:16.060 --> 40:18.460
Finding the virus which causes a disease

40:19.100 --> 40:24.060
You purify a virus by making a lot of I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus

40:24.540 --> 40:26.540
Okay, I don't understand what the

40:27.340 --> 40:32.460
They interchange the two and I wasn't I see it was the same thing or that was too totally different

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
No, it depends on how they use

40:36.140 --> 40:39.020
Can can you explain the process of hw isolation?

40:41.420 --> 40:45.820
Well, I didn't dr. Gallo do that. I mean he actually isolated it so

40:46.460 --> 40:47.980
I

40:47.980 --> 40:51.660
Mean why should I do all of this? This is all textbook stuff. You're asking me

40:54.460 --> 40:59.420
I'm not quite sure what's behind your question about isolation. I don't want to be your textbook

41:00.140 --> 41:02.140
You know, I cut other things to do

41:04.700 --> 41:12.380
Isolation is essentially that's not the reaction of somebody who feels like he's been asked a question that's below him

41:12.540 --> 41:16.700
That is someone who has who realizes that he's just been cornered

41:18.140 --> 41:22.620
And the only way for him to get out of that corner was to say that come on man. This is beneath me

41:26.060 --> 41:28.060
That's extraordinary

41:28.540 --> 41:33.260
And they're not going to find anybody that they can put on video that's going to give you an adequate explanation of this

41:33.660 --> 41:38.940
In general maybe but not in specific and certainly not with reference to the hiv virus

41:38.940 --> 41:43.260
Which is what he just asked him about. I just want to play that a little bit again because it's nice

41:43.340 --> 41:45.340
It's just it's beautiful

41:47.340 --> 41:53.820
I see it was the same thing or if it was too totally different. Oh, it depends on how they use it. Okay

41:55.020 --> 41:57.500
Can you explain the process of hw isolation?

41:59.900 --> 42:04.300
Well, I didn't dr. Gallo do that. I mean he actually isolated it so

42:04.940 --> 42:06.460
I

42:06.460 --> 42:10.220
Mean why should I do all of this? This is all textbook stuff. You're asking me

42:12.940 --> 42:17.980
I'm not quite sure what's behind your question about isolation. I don't want to be your textbook

42:18.620 --> 42:20.620
You know, I cut other things to do

42:23.180 --> 42:25.180
Isolation is essentially

42:27.420 --> 42:29.020
Getting the the virus

42:29.980 --> 42:34.300
From the patient and being able to transmit this virus

42:34.940 --> 42:36.460
to another cell

42:36.460 --> 42:39.580
To reproduce the infection and to have a continual

42:40.380 --> 42:44.220
Supply of the virus and that's called isolation

42:44.860 --> 42:51.020
See and that's very tricky. You can't just isolate virus and then have a continuous supply of it. That's the problem

42:51.980 --> 42:53.980
with RNA virology

42:55.580 --> 42:57.580
It doesn't work

42:57.660 --> 43:01.580
That's the objection that these these isolation and purification

43:02.300 --> 43:04.860
Focused people have and it is a legitimate

43:05.580 --> 43:07.580
It is a legitimate explanation

43:07.740 --> 43:09.740
objection

43:11.500 --> 43:18.540
And this is exactly where they were with the hiv virus ladies and gentlemen think about this history

43:19.020 --> 43:21.020
I was going around the mall

43:22.380 --> 43:24.620
Getting in fights with people from Chippewa falls

43:25.580 --> 43:27.740
I wasn't paying attention to this back then

43:29.340 --> 43:35.180
In the 80s, I was living my best life trying to see every movie that came out at the mall and like, you know

43:36.540 --> 43:40.380
Using my driver's license to do don'ties in a in a parking lot

43:40.460 --> 43:43.900
I wasn't paying attention to whether AIDS was real

43:44.540 --> 43:50.060
Are you kidding? I had an aquarium to clean. I had snakes to feed. I had a paper route

43:50.220 --> 43:52.220
I

43:53.660 --> 43:55.660
And I had to play cyber ball

43:56.300 --> 44:02.940
That was the best video game ever if you never played cyber ball with like two people against two people in the in the late 80s

44:03.100 --> 44:08.060
Or beginning maybe very like 88 or 89 you missed it. You totally missed it

44:08.540 --> 44:13.900
My point is is that we need our college kids to understand that this history is here

44:14.860 --> 44:20.940
It's it's an it's a much more in need of disambiguation than any of them realized

44:20.940 --> 44:23.420
Then any of them will ever be told in their history classes

44:23.420 --> 44:28.860
There is no history of biology class at the university level. Did you ever think about that?

44:30.460 --> 44:36.220
That there is no history of science biology at the at the university level and why that would be

44:38.060 --> 44:40.060
And why these philosophy of science

44:40.860 --> 44:46.940
Histories go back so far as to go all the way back to like astronomy because they don't want you to think

44:48.060 --> 44:50.060
Rather they don't want you to realize

44:51.500 --> 44:57.500
That the same kinds of bad models of the universe the same kinds of bad models of complexity

44:59.340 --> 45:03.180
Can result in decades of of misadventures

45:05.020 --> 45:07.980
Decades of being governed by a mythology

45:08.780 --> 45:11.980
And whether she's a winning or unwitting participant

45:11.980 --> 45:19.020
We are being fooled because people like like David Baltimore are spectacularly committed to the original lie

45:19.980 --> 45:23.500
Upon which all of these other observations are distorted

45:27.980 --> 45:33.420
And so if the foundational observation is distorted then everything that comes after it is necessarily on a

45:34.140 --> 45:36.140
On a lean as well

45:36.380 --> 45:39.580
You don't necessarily notice it if you grew up in that leaning tower

45:41.180 --> 45:49.260
If you cut your teeth learning how to walk in that leaning tower and not have the the lean bother you then you're you're this lady right here

45:49.820 --> 45:51.820
or if you work on

45:51.820 --> 45:58.060
Signals in this size space that are real and aren't being distorted other than the aids virus other than coronavirus

45:58.140 --> 46:03.260
Maybe there are some signals that are real like bacteriophages or giant viruses

46:04.460 --> 46:06.620
And it's these intermediates that are actually

46:07.820 --> 46:13.260
Exosomic signaling and endosomes and this kind of thing these are all being distorted as pathogenic as well

46:14.460 --> 46:20.380
But whatever the illusion is ladies and gentlemen, please let us tell our high school kids

46:20.860 --> 46:27.580
Let us tell our college kids that this debate and illusion and exaggeration about what is possible

46:27.980 --> 46:29.180
in this

46:29.180 --> 46:36.940
Biological space has been going on since AIDS and before it's important purification is just obtaining the virus

46:38.060 --> 46:46.140
Free of solar contaminants or other contaminations, but it doesn't mean necessarily that the virus is infectious

46:46.140 --> 46:55.900
Virus isolation I would take to mean that

46:56.780 --> 47:00.940
You take some infected material like a blood sample

47:01.820 --> 47:09.020
From someone who you think or or believe may have HIV infection may already have symptoms of AIDS

47:09.740 --> 47:12.300
And you try and grow the virus

47:12.940 --> 47:14.940
From that blood sample

47:15.020 --> 47:20.380
So you would put the blood sample into culture you would stimulate the lymphocytes

47:20.860 --> 47:27.500
To proliferate with various growth factors or cytokines and you would harvest the virus

47:28.060 --> 47:34.220
From the the culture medium. You're growing it in for eight virus on the who station

47:34.460 --> 47:39.100
So let's listen to carefully to what he explains here and then let's analyze what he says

47:39.900 --> 47:42.380
I would take to mean that

47:43.340 --> 47:47.500
You take some infected material like a blood sample

47:48.380 --> 47:55.500
From someone who you think or or believe may have HIV infection may already have symptoms of AIDS

47:56.300 --> 47:58.860
And you try and grow the virus

47:59.580 --> 48:01.580
From that blood sample

48:01.580 --> 48:06.940
So you would put the blood sample into culture you would stimulate the lymphocytes

48:07.420 --> 48:13.980
To proliferate with various growth factors or cytokines and you would harvest the virus

48:14.540 --> 48:18.300
From the the culture medium. You're growing it in

48:19.420 --> 48:21.420
You would spin out the cells

48:22.220 --> 48:26.700
Separate the cells and the supernatants and you would look for the virus

48:27.580 --> 48:29.100
in the

48:29.100 --> 48:35.340
In the culture medium that needn't be a pure medium because you can use markers of the virus that tell you it's there

48:35.820 --> 48:38.540
Such as the reverse transcriptase enzyme

48:39.100 --> 48:46.860
So you can see evidence the virus without actually purifying particles in that very first paper

48:47.500 --> 48:52.140
Okay, so there you can probably hear it coming already, right? You can definitely hear it coming

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
so um

48:55.500 --> 49:03.060
Infected material and this is a lot of what what people like mark bailey have talked about for a long time with regard to the isolation of sars

49:03.540 --> 49:08.580
CoV-2 infected material is put on a cell culture for AIDS. It would be a lymphocyte cell culture

49:09.060 --> 49:11.780
The cell culture is stimulated to divide

49:12.740 --> 49:14.740
Or it is stimulated or it is

49:15.460 --> 49:18.340
In this case they give it growth factors and cytokines

49:19.140 --> 49:21.620
And so they stimulate the cells to divide

49:22.340 --> 49:25.220
In the presence of this infectious material, whatever it is

49:25.540 --> 49:30.500
They harvest the supernatant and then they look for markers that include reverse transcriptase

49:31.460 --> 49:36.660
Now if reverse transcriptase expression or more importantly reverse transcriptase activity

49:39.300 --> 49:43.860
Is identified in that in that culture there better darn well be a

49:44.980 --> 49:49.460
Control where they do everything but they don't put infected material in there

49:49.460 --> 49:51.460
But they put healthy material in there

49:51.860 --> 49:58.500
And there isn't but there needs to be because otherwise we don't know if what they did to stimulate the lymphocytes cell culture

49:59.060 --> 50:00.660
upon

50:00.660 --> 50:07.940
Upon exposing it to the infected material is not responsible for these markers coming up markers coming up

50:09.460 --> 50:11.460
And again, here's a virologist very

50:13.300 --> 50:19.780
What appears to be wittingly going along with the idea that markers and and surrogates of

50:20.900 --> 50:22.900
of presence are okay

50:23.460 --> 50:26.900
That the the actual presence of the virus is already

50:27.460 --> 50:31.620
Understood with high enough fidelity so that we can use these markers instead

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
And this is still at a time

50:34.020 --> 50:40.980
When people are objecting to whether or not the virus was actually found and who it was found by think about how spectacular that is

50:46.180 --> 50:49.060
Oops, that's supposed to be star wars. There we go. That's better

50:49.700 --> 50:51.220
I

50:51.220 --> 50:58.580
Like the star wars wipe. Okay. Go go go gadgets from the french group published in may 1983

50:59.140 --> 51:01.460
uh, they were two things that

51:02.580 --> 51:04.580
appeared to

51:04.580 --> 51:06.740
Class it amongst the retrovirus

51:07.860 --> 51:12.420
family one was reverse transcriptase activity and

51:13.140 --> 51:18.340
One was actually looking at virus particles with the electron microscope

51:18.820 --> 51:24.580
So they had pictures and they had enzymatic activity, but they didn't do the controls necessary to know

51:25.060 --> 51:30.660
That the enzymatic activity that they detected wasn't a result of their manipulation in the experiment

51:30.660 --> 51:32.660
They don't have that control. Isn't that weird?

51:33.940 --> 51:38.660
Isn't it weird that they would have already jumped so far to assume the existence of the virus

51:39.780 --> 51:44.660
And that reverse transcriptase would be a sufficient signal to indicate its presence. Isn't that weird

51:45.620 --> 51:49.300
And this is at a time when PCR didn't you know, it wasn't quite

51:50.980 --> 51:52.980
weaponized yet

51:54.340 --> 51:56.980
But when it would be when it would it when it would be

51:58.500 --> 52:00.980
Adjunct court would be right there ready to go

52:01.860 --> 52:04.980
um ready to help out with uh hiv testing

52:06.340 --> 52:08.340
Gosh, I can't believe what a hero he is

52:09.060 --> 52:11.860
The title of the

52:11.860 --> 52:15.700
1983 paper by Montagnier and his colleague is isolation

52:16.260 --> 52:22.660
Of a teleprotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids

52:24.020 --> 52:26.020
Now the word isolation

52:27.460 --> 52:28.660
means

52:28.660 --> 52:35.620
To obtain something or to place something apart or to obtain a sepsum separate from everything else

52:38.980 --> 52:43.620
Apparently mutagnier by isolation that laptop is a 17 inch macbook

52:43.780 --> 52:45.780
They only made it between

52:45.860 --> 52:48.820
2010 and 2012. It is a beast

52:49.220 --> 52:51.220
Uh a real relic that thing is cool

52:51.300 --> 52:55.060
It's it's the one that came right before the one that I have which is a 15 inch

52:55.700 --> 53:01.700
2012 macbook, which I think is the greatest laptop ever made did not mean this but something totally different

53:02.900 --> 53:07.220
And I'll explain to what he meant by by isolation

53:08.020 --> 53:10.500
He did three main experiments

53:11.220 --> 53:16.740
The first experiment he took liver sites from a patient now is known as brew

53:17.540 --> 53:21.060
And he cultured them who is many

53:21.940 --> 53:26.580
Substances including pha and other growth factors. What are growth factors?

53:28.180 --> 53:31.140
The substances which make cell to multiply

53:31.860 --> 53:33.220
Okay

53:33.300 --> 53:34.740
Or to live

53:34.740 --> 53:37.380
into to to stay alive in the culture

53:38.500 --> 53:43.380
And after 15 days, he discovered their reverse transcriptase activity

53:44.100 --> 53:49.380
And they claim that this proves the existence of retrovirus

53:50.100 --> 53:51.460
in

53:51.460 --> 53:53.060
their patient

53:53.060 --> 53:55.060
In their patient cells

53:55.060 --> 53:57.220
Every two days we were taking the supernatant

53:58.180 --> 54:04.580
Looking for the presence of the enzyme that transform RNA to DNA the reverse most FDA's

54:05.140 --> 54:08.580
Because we know that this enzyme is associated to virus particle

54:09.300 --> 54:13.380
So we were testing for this enzyme activity in the supernatant

54:13.940 --> 54:15.940
What's so special about reverse transcription

54:19.940 --> 54:23.300
Anytime you're searching for a new agent

54:24.180 --> 54:28.180
You want to have some simple measurement of the presence of that agent

54:31.620 --> 54:40.420
In times past you would put it on cells cell culture in the laboratory and suddenly these beautiful cells will all start turning into dead cells

54:40.420 --> 54:42.020
He says oh something's there

54:42.020 --> 54:46.500
And then you put that into an electron microscope and look and you can find it

54:47.060 --> 54:49.220
All those are rather difficult things to use

54:50.180 --> 54:52.180
If there's something that the virus

54:52.180 --> 54:56.500
Think about the concept that you put stuff on a cell culture the cell culture dies

54:56.500 --> 55:01.220
And then you think you can use a very very very high resolution camera to find the cause

55:03.380 --> 55:05.380
Just think about how crazy that is

55:06.020 --> 55:08.660
For example, there's a huge car accident

55:10.260 --> 55:13.140
On on Washington avenue down the street here

55:13.460 --> 55:19.140
And we use as many cell phone and drone photography pictures as possible of the accident to figure

55:19.140 --> 55:20.420
out why it happened

55:20.420 --> 55:22.500
But the guy who caused the accident was drunk

55:23.940 --> 55:26.740
How many photographs would we need to take before we'd figure that out?

55:28.180 --> 55:33.700
And what he's suggesting is is that after mixing and a patient sample in a cell culture and seeing these

55:34.900 --> 55:37.300
Beautiful cells start to deteriorate

55:37.460 --> 55:43.300
There's a sign of something there and then you can put that under an electron microscope and take a picture of it

55:43.940 --> 55:47.060
I want you to hear how spectacular that is

55:48.020 --> 55:52.180
Because this is the essence of farewell to virology from mark bailey

55:52.180 --> 55:57.780
He focuses exclusively on this absurdity and he really tears it apart very well

55:58.420 --> 56:03.140
With regard to sars and with regard some of the other older papers and the way that they've been interpreted

56:03.140 --> 56:09.460
So in a lot of ways and i'm going to focus exclusively on coronaviruses and sars too in particular

56:10.420 --> 56:12.260
We are dealing with an illusion

56:12.260 --> 56:14.980
We are dealing with a spectacular commitment to these

56:15.700 --> 56:22.820
Proxy signals which these people all know don't indicate pandemic potential. They might not even indicate existence

56:25.220 --> 56:30.740
Depending on how far you believe this lie goes how committed you believe some of these people are

56:32.020 --> 56:38.100
But keep in mind this is a historic video and we are still not really that far from here

56:38.980 --> 56:40.980
Just focused on a different

56:41.860 --> 56:43.620
A different virus

56:43.700 --> 56:45.700
It's really spectacular

56:45.860 --> 56:51.700
Producers in this culture you don't necessarily have to see all the dead stuff you just can have

56:52.340 --> 56:55.060
Take off some of the liquid. It's growing in and tested

56:56.180 --> 56:59.540
And one thing you can test for a retrovirus is reverse transcriptase

57:00.180 --> 57:02.820
And it just happens to be that's a laboratory test available for it

57:02.820 --> 57:06.820
So you just take a little bit off put it into a chemical assay and you can do it very very simply

57:06.900 --> 57:12.020
So it's a matter of something that you can put a lot of specimens through and something that's simple to do so you can really

57:12.980 --> 57:14.660
get a

57:14.660 --> 57:20.180
Maybe not a direct picture of the virus. You can't see it, but you can get evidence that is there like fingerprints

57:20.980 --> 57:22.980
Like fingerprints

57:22.980 --> 57:24.980
The lymphocytes

57:24.980 --> 57:28.020
Which are originated from blue lymph nodes

57:28.580 --> 57:34.580
He took these lymphocytes and cultured them who is the lymphocytes of a healthy blood donor

57:34.980 --> 57:39.380
And there again he detected a reverse transcriptase activity

57:39.700 --> 57:43.060
So mutinya that found reversed transcriptase activity

57:43.540 --> 57:47.540
And according to him this proof that the retrovirus was there

57:48.500 --> 57:55.060
So Pete is right Pete in the chat says that uh telemerases are reverse transcriptases and they are present in every cell

57:55.060 --> 57:59.380
And that's correct actually telomeres are maintained by the reverse transcription of them

57:59.860 --> 58:03.780
They get restored. Um, they are maintained by this uh telemerase

58:03.780 --> 58:10.580
So that's totally right and it's not clear whether telemerase activity could be confounded with reverse transcriptase activity

58:10.580 --> 58:12.580
But you know, we're we're

58:12.580 --> 58:16.180
Through the looking glass at this stage here because we need to now really figure out

58:16.740 --> 58:24.180
Who what of these people have been sabotaging this tug of war and for how long they've been sabotaging it because that's really that's the reality

58:25.140 --> 58:30.500
And we need to take stock. We need to really take stock that this is the reality and anybody

58:30.980 --> 58:32.980
That can trace their

58:32.980 --> 58:37.700
Intellectual roots back to when this illusion was actively being constructed

58:38.100 --> 58:43.540
Who those people need to be as far away from the the levers of

58:44.900 --> 58:47.380
Of whatever that they can be

58:48.020 --> 58:54.820
They have to be far far away from influencing what we are thinking and far far away from influencing what our children are thinking

58:55.300 --> 58:58.980
Anybody that participated in this illusion in the 80s

58:59.540 --> 59:04.420
In any way shape or form and hasn't come out and said as a result of the pandemic that wow

59:04.500 --> 59:11.060
I can't believe how long this illusion has been going on. He's definitely almost certainly involved in it now

59:13.380 --> 59:16.820
Because they already proved their worth 20 years ago

59:18.740 --> 59:24.660
They already proved that they either would unwittingly participate because of ego or other reasons greed

59:25.540 --> 59:27.380
prestige

59:27.380 --> 59:28.900
status

59:29.300 --> 59:37.540
Or unwittingly because they weren't sophisticated enough in their appreciation of the sacred biology to see how this was being distorted and being used against us

59:38.580 --> 59:40.740
Too lost in their own little question to care

59:41.380 --> 59:44.660
Too lost in their grand proposals to care too lost in life

59:45.460 --> 59:47.460
And the busyness of it

59:47.460 --> 59:49.860
But now is our chance to teach our children something

59:51.460 --> 59:57.060
Once this is our once in a in a millennium chance to teach our children the truth or at least put our

59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.020
Put our children on the trail of the truth

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:06.900
Put our children on a a genuine pursuit of the truth. I may never know it

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.860
But maybe my sons will

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:16.820
Wouldn't that be isn't that a much more optimistic and hopeful appraisal of the situation than then uh

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.980
bioweapons

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:26.500
And and dominance of of bioterrorism and and incapacitating agents that have killed millions of people

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.060
And

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.500
I'm not just arguing that those are sad

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.820
outlooks

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.660
They're unrealistic biologically implausible outlooks

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.620
And given who we are fighting and what we are fighting it is very very unlikely that they are real

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.260
But rather a mythology that has been

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.140
carefully installed over decades starting with the hiv

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.420
fiasco

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:04.580
And going on from there over decades and actually installed by the same people. That's why fauci runs so far deep

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.860
He might be the most important

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:14.260
Whitting participant that there is and he may be unwitting about some of the the

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:21.060
The implications of his work because he may not be sophisticated enough to know but it's almost impossible to believe

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.340
Um that he is not part of this intimately part of this charade that is

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.860
uh public health and governance by it

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.260
It's just been many many years ladies and gentlemen and we have to teach our college kids this but

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:46.180
The only way to say that the existence of reversed as cryptic so the detection of reversed as cryptic activity proves the retrovirus was there

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.100
is only

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.860
If reversed transcription was specific to retroviruses

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.820
Which is not the case in fact?

01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:03.460
Then today nearly everybody accepts that reversed transcription or a western script activity is

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.820
non-specific to retroviruses

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:15.060
In fact a present everybody accepts that reversed transcript transcription is present in all normal cells

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.420
in fact

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.020
a sub biggest

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.020
at the beginning of the 1970s

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.700
Garro himself has shown that

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.700
normal

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.220
cells

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:33.860
When putting culture in the stimulator to their cartridge which be with pha till start

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.420
um

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.820
Heaven reversed the script is activity

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.380
So

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:08.500
Motenie put the bruce cells in a culture into culture here the different growth factors including pha

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.540
And after 15 days he detected reversed transcript activity

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.140
however

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:23.060
Pha by itself in normal cell and this was known by barrisin you see the principal author and galloprooted at the beginning of the

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.660
1970s that

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.700
Pha itself causes a reversed transcription

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:35.300
In normal cells so he put something in the cell which was causing

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.860
reversed transcription and yet he said that this proves the existence of a

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.020
Offered rovirus there

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020
So you're saying that

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:49.140
What they found might just be the actual substance they put in the culture and not a virus definitely

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.500
That is that is that is is there evidence. Why would they do that?

01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:01.860
But as you see knew that in 1973 galloprooted at the beginning in 1972. I think was his paper. I don't know

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.940
Now everybody accepts that reversed transcriptase activity is

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:13.300
A characteristic of retroviruses, but it's not specific to retroviruses

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:18.820
But in all my interviews with scientists they all say that reverse transcription is unique to retroviruses

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.020
And that's how they knew that there was a virus in their culture

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.940
Once you um have produced, you know, you produce something in the extracellular medium

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.420
You can do actually several things

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.540
One thing is that if we expect or suspect is a retrovirus

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.420
Like h t l v one the leukemia virus

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:46.180
What we can do is look for what we call reverse transcriptase activity the enzyme, which is unique to these viruses

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.940
Yeah, the scientific procedure was multifaceted

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.740
I mean, I have a good size lab

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.460
And so we had divided people up into different primary goals

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.340
and that would meet daily

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.980
uh, and the first goal was

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.940
If a patient

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.940
Has fully developed AIDS

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.900
Forget risk groups at the time. We didn't want to get into the risk group, you know

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.380
They had they had AIDS

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.900
Documented AIDS

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.900
Could we take their blood?

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.500
Get their T cells like we would do with any

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.420
It was like the leukemias like we did with the leukemias the same protocols. We did with leukemia

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.620
Take those T cells

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.100
Clean them up from other cells

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.580
Grow them with interleukin 2 our old friend

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:38.180
And see if we could find any evidence of release of virus particles

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.620
And if we were right that they would be retroviruses and how to do that was with a surrogate marker

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.180
You don't use electron microscopy in those days except maybe one or two pictures just to confirm

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:53.380
Or to see the structure of this particular retrovirus the assay was reverse transcriptase

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.420
Well, I don't know whom you interviewed

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.020
But if you don't believe me go in as baltimore or vermos

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:06.340
And i'm sure they will confirm that reverse transcriptase activity is a characteristic

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.780
Of retroviruses, but it's not specific to them

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:14.500
What do you mean when you say reverse transcription is a characteristic of retroviruses, but not specific?

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.260
Oh

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:21.620
Let me give you an example. Here is a characteristic of humans

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.300
You know black white or yellow we all have hair

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:30.580
But it's not specific because there are many animals for example cats dogs

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:38.020
Which also have hair and finding a hair in a room. It doesn't mean that a human being was there or

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.140
a cat or a dog

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.220
Are retroviruses

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.220
The only ones that can be rich transfer?

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.140
No

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.220
There are other forms of reverse transcription that are used in various

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.300
Various ways inside the cell for instance the ends of chromosomes

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:03.620
Are made by a reverse transcription process. That's how they're maintained stable the

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.780
There is reverse transcription in the inheritance of all of our cells

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.580
Which comes about from

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:17.220
endogenous genetic elements in the cells or in the cells of our

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:23.940
Ancestors because once that information gets into our into our cells into our genomes it stays there forever

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.220
So it could be that we've inherited

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.260
information from monkeys or from

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.180
Other animals that are that are in our

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.140
lineage

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.660
And so no reverse transcription is actually very widespread something like 50 percent

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:47.460
Of the DNA in our cells comes about by reverse transcription

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.900
Yes

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.020
Going back to I thought it was 1.5 to 2 percent

01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:03.220
The 50 percent the retroviral DNA or retroviral genes in our DNA what biological function did you serve?

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.700
Now we got to make a distinction

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:10.820
When I said 50 percent, I'm saying 50 percent of the DNA came about by reverse transcription

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.060
But it's not all retroviruses. Lots of it is just

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:20.820
Repeated elements that are there as what we generally considered to be

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.500
Parasitic DNA

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.540
DNA which is other people call it selfish DNA

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:34.420
DNA which is in there because it's able to copy itself and reintegrate itself in other places

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.900
And this is something that's going on all the time

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:42.740
So he actually believes in this idea that there is parasitic DNA

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.860
That's recopying itself into our genome all the time

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:53.380
And it has no deleterious consequences at all. It's not knocking out genes by inserting in the wrong place

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.780
it's not

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:02.500
Eliminating an enhancer sequence or changing the the it is extraordinary what he is saying here right now

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:07.700
He's basically saying that most of our genome is made up of repeated elements that are just junk

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.620
And of course, that's what they used to think back in the 80s in the 90s that there was this

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.820
Entrons and there were these extras and the extra exons were were

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.980
Stuff that got made into proteins and the introns were just stuff in between that was mostly junk DNA

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:27.300
You

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:33.860
Need to see how spectacularly simple their model of the genome is that it just works perfectly

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.260
in in millennia after millennia of perfect children

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:44.180
But it's got a bunch of crap in it a bunch of stuff that just copies itself because it's selfish

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.620
But this same guy in this same interview couldn't take the time to explain how

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.820
HIV was isolated or purified and he couldn't

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.140
Take the time

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:02.580
To give us a textbook differentiation between those two terms or whether they're interchangeable or not and what it really means

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.740
This is where we are you can see it clearly now

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:14.420
These people have no respect for the sacredness of our of our biology no respect for the

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.060
The irreducible complexity that at some point you must acknowledge no

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.700
He's already talking about the genome like it's all but done

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.740
Talking to the genome like it's all but understood

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:34.100
That kevin mccurnan and the whitehead institute and and eric lander have sequenced it and now we're we're off to the races

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.060
We just have to learn to ignore all this parasitic DNA that's all selfish

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.180
This is a Nobel prize winner here

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:53.140
This is a Nobel prize winner right here some guy that we're supposed to look up to is one of the thought leaders of the

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.580
Of people who are currently alive

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.260
Would you take a one a one-on-one biology class with this monster

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:12.100
I am absolutely I'm sorry that I called you a monster

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.340
uh

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.340
Dr. Baltimore I shouldn't have

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.300
But I think that you're guilty of misleading the young I think that you are actively misleading everyone

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.980
on earth

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.860
And part of a group of people that has been misleading everyone on earth for decades

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.780
And so i'm not sure what other term to use to describe you

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:40.500
But that's what I that's the only conclusion that I can come to when I see this spectacular commitment to lies

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.060
It's a whole movie

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.700
Talking to the guy who invented infectious clones and we're not going to talk about it

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:55.380
Infectious clones that helped them overcome the problem of you know the knobs going away

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.100
I can't take that call right now, but I would really like to take that call right now

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:03.380
um

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.380
It's just I'm just shocked

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.780
that how

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:12.340
Obvious the irreverence is it's it's it's just it's mind-blowing

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.300
I'm saying 50 percent of the dna came about by our first transcription

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:21.540
But it's not all retroviruses. Lots of it is just

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:27.300
Repeated elements that are there as what we generally considered to be

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.220
um

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.980
parasitic dna

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.020
DNA, which is other people call it selfish dna

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:40.980
DNA, which is in there because it's able to copy itself and reintegrate itself in other places

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.380
And this is something that's going on all the time

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.700
um

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.700
And it builds up

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:54.020
Why do you think that you and so part of the reason why our genome is so big is because we've got all this parasitic dna in it

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:03.780
Even though every time you do a recombination or an insertion or something like that if it's done erroneously

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.980
It ends up in a deletion

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.260
So somehow or another

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.860
Their explanation

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:22.020
For why our genome is the way it is as simple as parasitic dna that copies itself all the time and stuff

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.140
That's their sophisticated understanding. That's the level of fidelity

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.900
That they started with with regard to understanding the genome. That's it. That's it. Nothing else

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500
I

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.860
Is reverse transcription

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:47.380
To prove the existence of a virus if they knew that it wasn't specific to viruses. I don't know

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:54.900
It's as simple as this. I don't know in fact they went one step further in the second experiment

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.180
They have

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:05.380
Taken the cells from their patient and mixed them which sells from a normal blood donor

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.020
And in that culture again, they put pha another

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.900
growth factors substances which make the cell to survive and grow

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.740
And again, they found reverse transcriptase activity

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:26.820
And this time they claim that they're finding what reverse transcriptase activity in the second culture

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.980
Proves that the virus was transmitted

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700
from the patient cells

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.820
to the

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.980
normal donor cells

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:41.300
And in fact, they say that this proves isolation of HIV

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.180
But they must have used some other criteria

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:50.900
To state that they had a new virus. There was no other criteria in the first they had a third experiment

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.700
But in the first a second experiment, that's how they're described

01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.340
In in their paper

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500
It was the first experiment

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:04.020
Revestants could replace activity the second experiment

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.740
Revestants could replace activity. They are the only evidence they have published

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:15.540
So in the first and the second experiment. So in both experiments, they fed the culture substances

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.620
Which artificially caused reverse transcription? Yes

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.300
Sorry about the volume just one of them pha

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.300
By itself, it will cause reverse transcription

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.020
in the normal cells

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.580
In non-infected cells

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.660
What are your problems with the third experiment?

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.780
Well, the problems first of all again, they took the supernatant

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.820
And it's it is from their second expect

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:43.860
It is

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.780
Tazik cube or whatever that is

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.260
I don't know how to say your name tazik's cube

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.260
the the mind trick of surrogate markers is an important topic and

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:58.260
And I I think it is the topic because essentially that's what is being defended

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.660
And what was being defended from the very beginning by

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.020
people who worked for the human genome project

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.020
People who have worked on AIDS their entire life

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:17.620
What what kind of list would you like to have? It's Birx. It's Fauci. It's Redfield. It's Wollinski. It's Murthy

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.940
It's they've all done AIDS

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.100
And even in the background

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.180
We have Robert Malone who worked in Murray Gardner's lab Murray Gardner

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:32.180
Supposed to be the guy who took the supernatant from France and brought it back to gallows lab that we're talking about right now

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:43.620
I mean, where are we if every single person on the on the tv and every single person on social media on the alternative social media

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.500
Has cut their teeth in hiv

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.140
I

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.140
Where are we if everybody

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:57.620
That is a dissident on our side is not arguing against the vaccine schedule isn't even questioning

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.980
What happened during hiv isn't even questioning the flu vaccine and is not questioning

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.540
The spread of a novel virus. What does that really mean to you?

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.940
That every meaningful

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.940
doubter

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.940
That is being amplified by the

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:27.700
Peter teal and elon musk network every doubter believes in the virus believes in AIDS believes in the vaccine schedule

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:34.660
Doesn't speak out about flu shots believes in the 1918 pandemic

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.420
Don't you see it yet?

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.500
The fact that this is still fringe

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:49.380
To all the people we're supposed to be following should be a giant red flag

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:56.260
The fact that that anything to do with with with the vaccine schedule is pretty much

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.620
uh

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.220
Not talked about

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:02.980
Is something that you've got to just acknowledge as being a problem, okay?

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:08.180
And the fact of the matter is these people who are on team worst case scenario

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.980
Will not go here. They won't tell you why?

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:16.740
Transfection was bad from the beginning and why it will be bad for any healthy human going forward

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.420
They won't tell you why the vaccine schedule has been

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.820
Holy exaggerated in its purpose and its effectiveness

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.820
They're never going to discuss the role of

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:36.340
Sanitation and sewer treatment and and water treatment and chlorine and swimming pools. They're never going to talk about all that stuff

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.580
They're never going to talk about the ever increasing

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.140
success rate

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.140
of western medicine

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:53.060
That is also overlaid on the effects of these diseases before we fixed all of the things we didn't know we needed to fix

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.260
Before we stopped using DDT

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.820
This

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.180
Illusion

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.420
That we are trapped under can be

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:11.540
Some of summarize by the biology that underpins that statement and that statement alone if you understand your immune system

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.700
As a complex pattern integrity organized around a barrier

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.900
And you understand even a little bit about how it's organized this will make perfect sense and this will be

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.140
acid to any other discussion or extemporaneous

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.100
Question

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:34.340
And anybody that's really on our side or more importantly anybody that's on our grandkids side

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.980
Should be making this argument at this stage

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.300
And at least be open to making that argument if it's provoked even if they have

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.380
Something else they're really focused on like ivermectin it should be okay

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.180
If you mention this that they're like oh, I totally agree with that. Wow

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:54.020
The vaccine schedule in america is a parent that would be wonderful wouldn't it if somebody said that abhorrent

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.540
But they won't only giga-ohm biological and a few other people are doing this

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:06.020
I want you to just see what is potentially possible with the worst case scenario narrative being distorted

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.260
here's a video on the internet that I found

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.460
that is

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.460
actively accusing

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.060
Ryan Cole

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:19.220
Of selling natto kinase and this being evidence of him being a creep

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.180
Now I don't want to debate about the effectiveness of natto kinase

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:29.620
I want to debate about the potential dangers of natto kinase when used in concert with other drugs

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.420
I don't want to debate about whether or not a particular supplier of natto kinase is good or bad

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:41.780
What I want to debate about is the idea that ryan cole was a very successful pathologist before the covid

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.900
Ryan cole came out very early about t cell immunity

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.500
very very early about natural immunity

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.140
And

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.780
Now he's having his life ruined

01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.580
By a suit that allows him not to talk anymore not to be active anymore

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:11.140
And I want you to think about the possibility that some of these organizations that are supporting some of these these

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:17.780
These people are being discredited to discredit the people that they are supporting rather than the organization itself

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.140
And if peter mccull is a good guy

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:29.300
And the only way he's able to put money on our food on the table or keep thing and keep making ends meet is to take money from

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.460
Something like the wellness company is it possible

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:36.020
That attacking the wellness company is a wonderful way to pretend like you're not attacking

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.340
Peter mcculler who's actually one of the few people who spoke out when it wasn't cool

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:45.540
Is it possible that you're going to come out against somebody like like

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:47.140
Uh

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.140
Dr. Jim Thorpe

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:56.340
Who might not be sophisticated enough to understand the subtleties of what the cloned methodology means for this

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:04.180
Bamboozlement that we are under, but he's surely in touch with the sacred biology of the pregnant woman and of the newborn baby

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:11.860
And so him speaking out about transfection being wholly inappropriate for them his his his role in this

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:18.100
And so attacking the wellness company because they support somebody like Jim Thorpe. Is that really what we want to do?

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.100
I don't know. I don't know

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:26.580
But I want to show you this example of how if if Ryan Cole is a good guy like I think he might be

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:31.300
Maybe Ryan Cole is being attacked now simply because he had no choice

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.620
But to take money from places where he could take it

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.100
Just like I had no choice

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:43.540
But to accept a pretty well-paying job with chd because it also had insurance and it drives my wife nuts that we don't have insurance

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:54.420
And so we can't judge people all the time based on how they're putting money on the table, but we better darn well know how they're doing it

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.540
And understand the implications of it

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.740
But should that take away from the fact that

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:05.140
Ryan Cole is one of the first people to speak out about t-cell immunity in relation to

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:10.100
Coronavirus is in general. Is that a reason to take him out? It sure seems like a good one to me

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:16.820
The first guy to speak out about the enabling of cancers because of the interference of teat with t-cells and the

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.780
Lymphocyte opinion. I think that's a good reason to take him out

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.300
And so let's put him in a financial situation where he can't make ends meet anymore

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.820
Whereas business is failing and where he's got to pay massive legal fees

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:32.100
Then let's make him have a source of money that we're going to then attack

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.740
As a proxy for attacking him and everybody else that gets supported by them

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.940
And so we've got to be careful ladies and gentlemen

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.820
We've got to be careful

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:50.420
Because there are plenty of people who are trying their best and the machine is working actively against them

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.420
So just watch this video so I can show you the possibilities that are coming

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.980
I

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.500
Think it's playing yeah

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.700
And so he says that Ryan Cole is a gatekeeper

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.420
There's no, you know, nano chips and wires and all this crazy stuff you share on the internet

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.820
I think that he's a gatekeeper because he says there's no nano chips and wires in these things

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.340
And so think about this distortion where he is

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.300
Bringing to the table

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:35.060
The fact that secret bhakti was correct that michael eden was correct that that it looks like

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:43.140
The the complement system is being activated by the antibody response to the expression of these proteins on endothelial cells

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:51.940
And that these microclots are forming because of the degradation of endothelial cells the production of fibrinogen

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.540
Or fibrin whichever one it is. I think it's fibrin

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.140
So fibrinogen gets

01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:02.980
Degridated to degrated to fibrin and fibrin forms these microclots with the help of

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.140
With the help of these antibodies and with the complement system with platelets

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.420
That's my stomach. Sorry

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.620
And so

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:18.980
Ryan Cole the guy who came out against natural uh came out for natural immunity and really came out for t cell immunity before

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.780
Any other person I heard no one else but him

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.180
And is now facing giant legal problems

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:33.060
Is the guy that they're saying is a gatekeeper because he says there was no nano

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:39.220
Particles in the shot even though there could have been in spain or somewhere like that. There probably weren't any in america

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.020
I want you to think about how how diabolical it is

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260
Is

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.260
That that's the way we are being played

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.580
By by a by a platform like twitter

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.940
Who we're supposed to believe is now a free space, but it's actually not it was being used to control

01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:03.540
the masses opinions and and and

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:10.260
And instincts before the pandemic and it's being controlled now. It's just a question of who owns it

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.300
Or who purports to own it

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:21.700
And so we are still seeing a distorted picture and the distorted picture is now going to fold in on itself

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.660
as all of the the

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.300
The desired

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.180
narrative curators get ever elevated

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.180
as we see

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:38.660
Brett Weinstein being on the tucker carlson podcast over and over and over again

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:44.660
And then we see the left make fun of tucker carlson and his coverage of the

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:49.140
Immigrant crisis and other things with Brett Weinstein over and over and over again

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.860
And in the background is this

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:59.060
Dissident community that is being ever fractured not by people like me who are questioning things

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:04.580
But by people who were there to make sure that the worst case scenario was never dismissed

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.220
And so now the worst case scenario is not even that they

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:17.620
Transfected us and transfection causes these microclots due to an auto immune reaction and over stimulation of the of the complement system

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.620
Now they want you to believe that they lied to you about what they put in the shots even worse even more magical

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:29.300
Because then a guy like this with a very plausible biological

01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:32.100
Explanation for what's going on gets dismissed

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:38.660
And people chase down what nano particles and and nano wires and and

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220
nano bots

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:50.980
And so later on in this video he mentions nano kinase. I don't need to do that. That's not necessary

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.300
I just wanted you to see that is the problem. Oh, I didn't mean to dismiss that though

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:59.060
So i'm gonna go quick past this sorry

01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:07.300
And so we have been fooled by this this this worst case scenario idea and they are still pushing it and as I showed you

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.460
There's now we have

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:13.380
cooperative activity between a former human genome project

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.060
patent holder and hiv tester

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.260
entrepreneur

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.300
and

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:26.660
Charles rixie who took the diffuse proposal leak and gave it to a bunch of foreigners on twitter as his

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.300
active patriotism to save our grandkids

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:34.900
And those two agree that this was a laboratory weapon that was leased on the world. It's probably a two-part weapon

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.620
According to rixie

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:46.500
Early, but I want his high morbidity. I want people to complain and rixie and mccain and mccernan and everybody ignore this talk

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:54.340
They ignore this guy they ignore the plausibility of his explanation and they ignore the possibility that the lies extend

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.820
into the biosecurity space

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.020
That everything about coronavirus is real

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.980
Everything about the sequences are real

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:11.300
We can trust everything that they say except for where it came from that we we should be very skeptical of and they're most certainly lying about it

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:19.060
That's the extent of their intellectual depth with regard to trying to interpret what really happened over the last four years. That's it

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.420
Just take take nih and cdc's word for it something spread

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:37.380
Killed millions of people but millions more were saved from it. I mean look at all those sequences gain a function must be real and certainly it's going to come again

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:49.300
And so this mystery is not going to be solved by a lot of these people because their job was to make sure it didn't get solved in the way

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:55.620
That it needed to be solved. It was supposed to be solved in the lab leak or natural virus thing. That's it. That's where we are

01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.780
That's why Robert Malone is doubling and tripling down on this

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:03.300
That's why they're all doubling and tripling down on it

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:09.060
They want us to move on now to solve the problems in the middle east or solve the problems somewhere. What was that?

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.740
I felt like something just flew in that was weird

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.300
um

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.540
And so they won't do the math that jessica hocket and and

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:24.180
Jonathan engler are doing they won't do the math of madassolam and remdesivir and

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.860
No one talks about the opioid deaths except for marqulak

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:29.540
um

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.820
Death certificate fraud, uh, you know, financial incentives to do that death certificate fraud track and trace

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:38.820
PCR lateral flow test flawed all the fraud all of this stuff

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:44.740
We're really starting to peel back the narrative with regard to pcr because that's really something that we know now

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:49.700
from from this the whole investigation into the clones that

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.420
That this is a wholly exaggerated fidelity that they claim to have and the pcr

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:59.620
Is this proxy for the presence of infectious virus, which is wholly inadequate?

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:05.140
It's very similar to using reverse transcriptase and pha stimulated cells, but now we're using

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:11.700
nucleic acids or the or amplicons of nucleic acids to indicate replicating virus and that's just absurd

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.420
But it keeps us trapped in this limited spectrum of debate and makes it very lively if you have

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:21.060
People like kevin mccaren and charles rixie and kevin mccernan calling people names and

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:25.940
Saying how dumb people are to think that infectious clones mean anything reasonable

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:34.500
And so we were on our kids are on this road still and our kids are looking for some truth looking for some understanding

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.580
Looking for some adults who have a grip on reality and that's who we need to be

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:44.980
And the way that we are that that adult that those kids need is to get out of this car

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:51.940
Get out of the car that we've been in for four years that we got into with people like, you know

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:57.540
erictopl and and tony fauci and and woolinski and burks

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:05.380
Where this novel virus was real, but it's not just one novel virus. It's one of many

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:13.380
And another and yet another example of pandemic potential realized these these mythologies need to be dismissed

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:20.500
And we need to understand why it is that despite having all of these really smart people on it. We haven't cracked this case yet

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.780
We need to understand that

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:32.420
Why is it that only a few people are where giga ohm biological is right now in this stream a few people on this screen are here just a few

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:37.860
quite a few of them are actually convinced that i'm one of the worst players

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:40.660
in the whole narrative which is

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.740
In my mind quite comical coming from the back of my garage. I think it's great

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:50.580
It tells me that we are over the target with regard to what these people are doing and that many more of them

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.620
Then are willing to admit actually know that they've been maintaining this pandemic confusion on purpose

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:59.860
And that's why they won't talk about zero epidemiological spread

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:03.140
They won't talk about strict liability for all pharmaceutical products

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:06.900
They won't talk about the vicp and the cicp these two

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:11.140
Vaccine kangaroo courts is being a seventh amendment violation. No

01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.860
Lawyers talking about that right now. No

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.940
Dissident is talking about that right now. There's no sub stacks about

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:24.980
Strict liability on roberm alone sub stack or no strict liability can be found on maryll nassas sub stack

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:29.540
No discussion of the seventh amendment violation can be found on either of those sub stacks either

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.660
And they're never going to discuss about the

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.820
Ponderance of iatrogenic death hyatrogenic murder

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:41.940
They're never going to talk about it because that goes against the narrative of the novel virus that killed millions of people

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.300
That doesn't participate in this pantomime

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:49.940
Where these people have been getting us to argue about the wrong things

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:55.060
Getting us to ask the wrong questions by pretending that there is a pandemic

01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:00.900
And pretending that they are doing something useful like this guy is pretending to usefully stop the train

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.460
And then chalk his hands up and usefully help to start the train

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:11.380
We have been fooled by people who are doing just what this guy is doing

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:15.220
But in the context of the pandemic pretending to fight it

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:19.940
Pretending to argue about it pretending to discuss relevant biology

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.460
When the relevant biology wasn't being discussed

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:27.700
And when it was it was being discussed by people like conuit with koski

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.420
or ryan cole

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.300
or

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.300
peter mcculler

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.340
Or michael eden

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.140
Or on my little tiny channel in 2020

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.340
And not on and not with any of these people that are currently leading this

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:48.660
This way out of the cave telling us that they know the way out of the cave

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:51.220
These are the people who are telling us that the people that say

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:56.260
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were a real real useful with this novel

01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.380
Novel pathogen

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:05.780
The same people who are telling us that the double stranded dna contamination is a real big deal

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.500
But not telling us the transfection was a really bad idea

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.780
And once you see that glaring omission

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:21.620
And the focus on the double stranded dna contamination as a contamination

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:25.300
You will see the game that they're playing they're doing what this guy's doing

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:28.340
They're pretending to meaningfully oppose something

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.940
They're pretending to meaningfully represent a dissidence that

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:36.180
An opposition to authority that you can

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.060
naively feel

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:41.060
as being meaningful

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.700
And that's not any different than the diffuse proposal being discussed as real by all these people

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:50.660
Who say now a foyer request has shown that they actually ordered the enzymes. Oh my gosh. We were right

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.300
They did do the experiments. They had enough funding. They did it

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.060
It's the same thing. It's the same

01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:01.300
Scooby-Doo narrative being solved right before our eyes by people who

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:07.460
For the most part i'm probably unwitting participants that were offered a chance at fame and comfort

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:13.300
If they just went with their instincts which were that this is a lab leak and i've done this little paper

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.460
This little analysis or i sent in this foyer and the foyer seems to indicate that

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:23.060
It's so weird that people don't understand that foyer requests are known

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:29.300
So people don't write emails very often under the pretense that they don't think it'll get foyer

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:32.740
They write emails under the pretense that it could be foyer

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.780
Doesn't anybody understand that?

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.500
And

01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:46.660
So we are here where they have over decades created the illusion of pandemic potential in the literature

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.940
They have for decades created the illusion in secret meetings

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:58.500
Of pandemic potential and gain of function risk and then they seeded a narrative with mass casualty events and stayed committed to a lie

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.700
This was a national security event

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:08.820
And this live exercise continued with the implementation of a team worst case scenario or several teams

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:14.580
that were sent out into the world with the message of confusion fear uncertainty

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:18.580
And the idea that the worst case scenario is billions of people dead

01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:22.500
And because it was a real real

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:29.380
National security exercise there are people that are participating that have said that they wouldn't tell that would be killed if they do

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.500
Or smeared and slandered and thrown out if they do

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:38.260
They got in over their heads. They didn't know what they were signing up for but they are now in it

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:45.140
And they are responsible for the toxicity of the virus being confounded with the toxicity of transfection

01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:53.860
So that the average tv skilled tv watching public and believes that there wasn't a novel virus that was released in the world

01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:58.500
And that we rushed out a transfection that had some negative consequences

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.980
But overall could have been worse

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:12.900
And this all goes back to the original illusion of antibodies being a useful proxy for immunity to

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:19.860
A respiratory infection the idea that a novel virus requires new antibodies

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.620
And the idea that vaccine antibodies are more durable and universal

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:29.460
Than antibodies produced from infection and that

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:37.940
Horribly simple and absolutely inverted understanding of the immune response and the role of antibodies in it

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.220
Is how they have permanently removed

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.860
The

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:50.180
Ability for young parents to in to give informed consent for their children and informed consent for themselves

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.700
Young people cannot give informed consent to any vaccination

01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.900
Because they are told that the biology that underpins vaccination is this and this is a lie

01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:06.580
This is not a um a misleading diagram. This is not a hey oversimplified diagram. This is a lie

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.660
This is a lie designed to enslave us under the pretense that vaccines work

01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:17.700
This is how they work and this is why they must be universally accepted by our children

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:24.020
And we cannot let our children grow up with this mythology. We simply can't because that is the trap

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.820
Batcave viruses the new world order. This is where they want our kids

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:34.340
They want this lie to become the truth and they want us to do it for them

01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:38.740
And so the only choice is to make sure we never forget

01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:43.940
We never forget what they did. We never forget who these people are. We never forget where they worked

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:47.220
We never forget their history so that we can see them clearly for who they are

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:54.900
They are people who have have formulated and and and perpetuated the concept of worst-case scenario

01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.340
And they have done it for all of these reasons and to be part of the governing structure that's to come

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.060
To be part of team

01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.060
Whatever elite

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.220
Make no mistake about it. That's what this is about. That's the only reason why somebody with a house

01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:11.780
In marble head

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:18.580
In boston is going to be spending more time tweeting about me than he is trying to get the word out about double-stranded dna

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.980
in the transfections

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:28.900
The mythology of pandemic viruses cannot be passed on to our college kids the

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:35.620
The mythology of of masks and social distancing and lockdowns cannot be passed on to our college kids

01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.100
The fidelity illusion of pcr testing cannot be passed down

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:43.620
To our medical students ladies and gentlemen, we have a huge

01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:50.900
Huge huge window here that is closing extremely rapidly where we can break this illusion about

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.980
About where this is going and what they really want, which is our children

01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:04.660
And we have this once in a millennia chance once in several generations chance to prevent our children from getting on the train that we were put on

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:08.580
The train that we were put on

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.860
The train where where vaccinations are just they just work

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.900
And the more you have the better

01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:24.340
That the evolution of the vaccine schedule in america is perfectly logical and not criminal

01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:30.180
Where novel coronaviruses have pandemic potential and can jump from laboratories or bat caves

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.620
Where every symptomatic spread of many different things is real

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:41.780
And where we have this huge data bank of 15 million sequences that are evidence of the pandemic

01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.820
Gain a function one

01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:50.420
Can't let our kids on this train ladies and gentlemen, and we will lose them forever and we will lose our grandchildren forever

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:56.660
And they know that that's why they're committed to this. That's why they they are committed to this because on the other side

01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:03.060
In 10 years or 15 years they will be and their families will be in the ruling elite

01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:10.260
Exempt from or outside of the mythology of the average

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:15.140
TV watching individual who believes that a pandemic happened in 2020

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:19.060
And that we're at the tail end of it five years in

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.100
It's a faith in a novel virus ladies and gentlemen

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:28.500
It's a faith that all of these people are being paid comfort and fame in order to maintain

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:33.460
And the only way to break it is to point out to our children that this is not possible

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:39.940
That RNA can't start in 2019 and faithfully circulate around the globe for five years straight and a trackable

01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:42.740
And branching phylogeny. That's not how this works

01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.140
There's no evidence for it in the previous literature and there's no real evidence for it now

01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.100
It's a lie

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:56.420
It's got to be because they have never bothered to try to differentiate from a completed background signal

01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:01.620
Although there's plenty of evidence in the literature that they've been looking to characterize this background for decades

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:07.780
They know what signals are there because nathan wolf has been working on it for decades. So I mean really

01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:15.460
In this scenario, we should be asking for a pause on all childhood vaccines in america full stop

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:19.700
strict liability for all pharmaceutical products including vaccines full stop

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:24.660
We should investigate the apparent mass casualty events that are being misconstrued

01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:28.500
You misconstrued as spread and we should investigate the possibility that

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:33.140
Transfection to a spike protein or transfection to a toxin or

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:40.020
Transfection to a genome sequence or sequences could be used to create the illusion of the pandemic including

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:45.780
The symptomologies and the molecular biological signatures that were purported to indicate spread

01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.780
We need to teach these possibilities to our children so that we can regain the sovereignty

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.900
Over their lives over their minds

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:59.620
And we need to get out of the who in the un entirely and we need to elect people to congress who are willing to do that

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:04.340
That's pretty simple and you can see the medlers because they don't like these ideas

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.380
They don't want to talk about transfection and use the word

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:12.180
They don't want to talk about clones as being anything other than just another way of getting viruses

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.380
And they definitely don't want to summarize across the whole show

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:21.620
Never mind across their whole real career or their whole real career during 2020

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:24.180
2021 when they weren't speaking out like they should have

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.140
So we are going to spend the next few weeks learning this biology one by one

01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:36.820
We started all the way at the end now all the way at the beginning of this illusion

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:43.700
Which I think really honing in on the the AIDS epidemic and it and the illusion created by it is a really good place to start

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:50.660
Now we're going to move forward to steffin lanka's work on measles and that objection in 2015 in the coming show

01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:53.060
And then

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:55.540
We're going to try and outline what I think is the

01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:00.420
the sort of illusion that these people are trying and how they're trying to maintain it and

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:05.460
Getting you to argue about two things that aren't related and once you see that these two things aren't related

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.340
Then you'll see why the infectious clone idea is the answer to this problem

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.380
They are lying to us about AI

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:17.940
And I've been hammering on this for a while and I've got a few clips that I've been harvesting

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:23.140
That really hit this home one from daniel dennett one from from hey podcast with

01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:24.740
with

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:25.540
Jordan peterson

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:32.020
It's just extraordinary how jordan peterson in that particular podcast just he actually states the truth out loud

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:35.220
And then it goes right over his head like an airplane. It's really amazing

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:42.900
So we're going to revisit ai and the distortion of ai and the dangers of coming ai versus whatever they're using on us right now

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:49.620
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop transfection in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.660
Thank you for joining me in the middle of the day

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:55.620
103 people watching is fabulous

01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.020
I'm not sure if i'm going to make it on again in the after in the evening

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:04.020
But there's a possibility that for sure i'm going to be on as many days as possible now

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.540
And during the week monday through friday, there's always going to be

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.500
At least one show during the day

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:15.460
I'm thinking about trying to do a show in the early morning called the second cup of coffee

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:22.900
Which will be a little more improvisational and then in the afternoon will be more of a real real study all and

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:29.540
I'm actually thinking about doing the briefs every once in a while now separately too. So we'll do

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:34.260
We're just going to try and more and more more more content

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.420
That's more and more of the truth out there as often as possible

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:40.820
We don't have to

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:47.060
Don't have to get too fancy with it yet. Um, we just want to win and we want to win by sharing these truths

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.220
Um, we want to win by sharing this stream and the work of mark kulak

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:55.460
You can also win by sharing the podcast of almond bollock

01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:00.660
Who I think is is really out there to get the truth out and fighting for our grandchildren as well

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:06.980
Um, please if you can afford it to go giggo in biological.com scroll down to the bottom

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:14.100
And subscribe you can also support one time there. I support giggo and put in any amount of money you want to and all

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:22.020
Contributions are appreciated and right now. This is the not quite updated list of the subscribers and supporters

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:27.780
I apologize to the people who've joined in the last week or so I'll update this before tomorrow. Thanks very much. I'll see you again

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.460
I

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:43.300
Yeah, I'm not sure why malik put me behind a paywall. Maybe you should send him a message about that because I feel a little bad about poking him

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:49.940
Um, but yes, technically i'm behind a paywall, but you know, everybody's got to earn their living. Um, he also put

01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:56.100
Mike eden behind a paywall after asking if that was okay. So I'm not going to judge

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.100
Uh

01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:00.580
Malik on that he didn't put me behind a paywall right away

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:06.740
And so maybe he just sees it as a podcast that is enough of the truth that he can

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:10.260
You know get people to commit for it. So i'm not going to hold it against him

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.660
And uh, i'm going to be on his podcast in like a week and a half or something again

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:16.580
So, you know, we're buddies and it's all good. So

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:21.860
We all got families and we all got people to feed so we got to do it. However, we can and uh

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:24.740
Right now

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:29.060
There aren't very many of us fighting for what we need to fight for. So, um, everybody that

01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:34.660
That um is fighting for our grandchildren. I'm on team. So let's uh, let's be here tomorrow

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.860
Same time same channel like 1313. I'll see you
