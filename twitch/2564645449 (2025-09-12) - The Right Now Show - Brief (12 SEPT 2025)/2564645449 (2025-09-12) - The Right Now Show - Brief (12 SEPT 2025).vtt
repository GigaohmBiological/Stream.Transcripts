WEBVTT

03:25.120 --> 03:25.360
Test 1, 2.

03:25.981 --> 03:26.221
Test 1, 2.

03:26.822 --> 03:27.242
Testing 1, 2.

03:27.923 --> 03:29.124
All by myself here.

03:30.266 --> 03:31.207
Good to see everybody.

03:40.677 --> 03:42.178
But you can tell if someone's lying.

03:42.819 --> 03:44.561
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:46.374 --> 03:47.095
And I have lied.

03:47.115 --> 03:48.156
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:48.176 --> 03:49.117
I don't want to lie.

03:49.578 --> 03:50.959
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:51.039 --> 03:52.081
I try not to be a liar.

03:52.101 --> 03:52.962
I don't want to be a liar.

03:53.522 --> 03:56.245
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:31.741 --> 04:33.462
Infection fatality rate.

04:33.702 --> 04:35.483
Totalitarian protocols, right?

04:35.783 --> 04:37.364
I mean, narcissists, essentially.

04:37.784 --> 04:39.885
Anti-vaxxers have any grounds in this topic.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.786
You're pure ends are your job.

04:42.066 --> 04:43.607
Because the Amish aren't vaccinated.

04:44.107 --> 04:46.028
They're not trained doctors, right?

04:49.175 --> 04:49.675
What are we doing?

04:50.516 --> 04:53.057
That the hospitals are being paid to give, right?

04:53.097 --> 04:54.197
They're getting bonuses.

04:54.237 --> 04:57.398
You can't find an autistic kid who is unvaccinated.

04:57.579 --> 04:58.539
Very, very rare.

04:58.779 --> 05:00.580
In the Amish community, very, very rare.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.702
People really fall for it, especially if it has that anti-establishment bite to it.

05:05.022 --> 05:05.742
Well, here we are.

05:06.002 --> 05:08.083
It's 2025 and it still needs to be said.

05:08.543 --> 05:10.184
Vaccines do not cause autism.

06:18.413 --> 06:31.664
Now Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

06:31.704 --> 06:37.969
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

06:48.698 --> 06:50.720
isolation, what was it?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.263
Of the virus?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.587
Well, you isolate a virus by

07:03.388 --> 07:05.890
finding the virus which causes a disease.

07:06.550 --> 07:11.414
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

07:12.215 --> 07:14.536
I don't understand what the issue.

07:14.756 --> 07:19.800
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

07:20.901 --> 07:22.042
No, it depends on how they used it.

07:22.482 --> 07:23.783
Okay.

07:23.923 --> 07:25.745
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

07:28.868 --> 07:30.831
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

07:30.891 --> 07:36.920
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.083
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

07:41.447 --> 07:42.368
What time is it?

07:42.428 --> 07:43.149
Game time!

07:49.113 --> 07:52.715
Good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

07:52.775 --> 07:53.556
Welcome to the show.

07:53.616 --> 07:55.057
This is GigaOM Biological.

07:55.857 --> 08:00.661
It is a high-resistance, low-noise information stream brought to you by a biologist.

08:01.221 --> 08:03.643
We try to say it as succinctly as possible here.

08:04.423 --> 08:07.708
We don't like to waste our time with a bunch of words that don't mean anything.

08:08.729 --> 08:10.572
Biology is definitely the way.

08:10.612 --> 08:14.417
We are part of a new independent bright web that's still forming.

08:15.298 --> 08:19.103
If you want to be a part of it, please sign up at GigaOMBiological.com.

08:19.784 --> 08:21.165
I don't know why that's making noise.

08:21.865 --> 08:24.667
We need to get ourselves off of social media, ladies and gentlemen.

08:24.687 --> 08:26.889
That's the only non-compliance that matters.

08:26.929 --> 08:34.914
We need to get our kids off of social media because it is a national security theater and it is a Lollapalooza of liars.

08:34.954 --> 08:39.017
There's no stage that you can attend where the music will tell you the truth.

08:40.057 --> 08:48.640
It is a huge, huge theater, and I am very convinced that the only way we win is if we stop watching.

08:49.180 --> 08:56.102
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

08:56.663 --> 09:00.904
Virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

09:01.484 --> 09:06.686
They have done the same thing with the pandemic and with gain-of-function viruses as a mythology.

09:07.426 --> 09:10.850
Make no mistake about it, it is one contiguous narrative.

09:11.511 --> 09:21.782
It goes all the way back to HIV and chronic fatigue syndrome and 9-11 and anthrax and DNA vaccines and transfection and RNA vaccines.

09:22.503 --> 09:35.936
It's all about the Human Genome Project and a gross exaggeration about what was accomplished and what is able to be accomplished with whole genome sequencing, what we can know and what we definitely don't know.

09:36.497 --> 09:41.001
The Cheese is free on social media for one reason and one reason only, ladies and gentlemen.

09:41.021 --> 09:42.263
They need you to participate.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.945
They need you to admit who you are.

09:45.746 --> 10:04.113
to answer every questionnaire every day so that they can keep track and figure out who the people are thinking are and what they're exactly thinking and what they think about and then when they crash the system and reset it they'll already have your background programmed in and they'll already know what to expect from you

10:05.193 --> 10:14.098
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want me to look at something, read something, help you out with something, please send a large cash-filled envelope to Dr. J at P.O.

10:14.138 --> 10:23.283
Box 802 Pebble Park, Pennsylvania 15102 along with a facsimile of that which you would like me to read and I will get right on it.

10:24.283 --> 10:26.985
Ladies and gentlemen, I really am happy to be here today.

10:27.045 --> 10:28.706
It's been a long week.

10:29.807 --> 10:33.796
Lots of pressures in the house of all different kinds and sorts.

10:36.169 --> 10:51.540
I won't belabor you with the details, but suffice it to say it's not an easy way for a family of five to make their way in the world with a father trapped where I am with a message that I have been given.

10:51.560 --> 10:57.365
I don't know if that's the right word, but I find myself kind of alone with this understanding.

10:57.405 --> 11:02.208
Not very many people are able to see what I see, which I think is really

11:03.189 --> 11:04.090
The Right Now Show.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.951
I love this name.

11:07.011 --> 11:11.973
I think I'm going to start calling my Friday show The Right Now Show all the time.

11:13.174 --> 11:22.098
Because we just need to kind of realize that social media tries very hard to convince you and your children to focus on right now.

11:22.478 --> 11:23.659
Because that's all that matters.

11:23.779 --> 11:24.139
Right now.

11:26.852 --> 11:49.169
And ironically, what really matters in my humble opinion is whether or not you and your family, whether you and your kids, whether your grandparents and your parents and you are all on the same page about what kind of world and what kind of America you want for your children and what you want to pass on to their children.

11:50.270 --> 12:01.580
And the fact of the matter is they have used social media to make our grandparents and our parents and our kids all on different pages, all focused on different parts of the narrative.

12:02.180 --> 12:14.251
And I think one way that America can get out of it is to stay focused on what we can know, not take the bait on social media by getting off of it and starting to reacquaint ourselves with the idea of loving our neighbor.

12:14.271 --> 12:15.232
You almost missed it there.

12:16.132 --> 12:17.413
Stay focused on the biology.

12:18.194 --> 12:24.758
because the fifth generation warfare is not focused on the biology, it's focused on getting you to argue about things that don't matter.

12:25.859 --> 12:27.100
I think that's really the trick.

12:28.501 --> 12:37.386
I really feel confident that the health freedom movement has been a trap for about 15 years and they may be quite off script right now.

12:37.446 --> 12:42.109
I think they may be very vulnerable and the recent events

12:43.337 --> 12:51.221
may in fact be an elaborate script change, an augmentation, a series of mistakes, or maybe even a full-on loss of control.

12:51.982 --> 12:57.464
Remember, they are weaponizing social media in a way that is not completely in their control.

12:58.585 --> 13:03.808
And one of the ways that you can at least pull yourself out is to download the PeerTube app.

13:04.868 --> 13:18.556
and enter in the URL stream.gigaohm.bio and start watching this stream and Mark Hucytonic's work on the PeerTube app without giving any of your data away, without sharing, without needing to log in.

13:19.676 --> 13:26.940
This is a big deal because if all content creators that you respected and that you wanted to listen to were using a

13:28.261 --> 13:31.403
the PeerTube app, maintaining their own PeerTube website.

13:32.163 --> 13:42.889
Essentially, we could put an end to the relevance of YouTube and streaming on X and any of this other nonsense by simply maintaining our own websites.

13:43.189 --> 13:47.071
It's almost like going back to MySpace, but then just one step back.

13:47.111 --> 13:48.072
You know, you're gonna take some

13:49.076 --> 13:55.700
publicly available open source software and create your own sort of generic version of what I'm doing.

13:55.760 --> 14:02.204
Upload your own little logo, change the color to what you want to change it to, and presto change-o, Bob's your uncle.

14:03.546 --> 14:17.736
I think that Housatonic, I think that the Liberty Perspective, I think that even Uncaptured Media should be on Peertube, and I think we should start a non-profit with this as one of their primary aims.

14:18.356 --> 14:19.537
And that's what I intend to do.

14:21.058 --> 14:24.040
I also intend to keep up this search for the truth.

14:26.222 --> 14:28.003
This search for the truth together.

14:29.124 --> 14:31.746
Let me pop myself over here.

14:33.157 --> 14:33.797
Oh, that didn't work.

14:35.758 --> 14:36.819
That's small.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.099
There we go.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.021
I'm gonna get rid of this music.

14:42.761 --> 14:43.742
It's good to be here.

14:43.782 --> 14:45.703
Thank you very much for joining me today.

14:45.763 --> 14:47.703
I apologize for not being here all week.

14:48.324 --> 14:51.105
I'm still trying to get all my ducks in a row and figure out

14:52.907 --> 15:01.559
from a day-to-day perspective, how I can dip into this filth and try to bring you a message of hope as often as possible.

15:01.599 --> 15:07.968
And quite frankly, I'm no longer willing to come online unless I feel okay.

15:09.109 --> 15:26.068
And it's not to say that I don't think those other messages are important, but I think I have about exhausted my ability to point out my own personal insight into this based on my own personal interaction with so many of these frauds.

15:26.128 --> 15:29.572
And I think it's to be left for the book.

15:30.604 --> 15:35.111
And I will finish that book, and it will be published, and it might even be free.

15:35.832 --> 15:40.178
I just want all this information to be available for our children and their children.

15:40.658 --> 15:47.027
So that if nothing else, they can seek the truth together, as that phrase up there suggests.

15:48.368 --> 16:01.213
It has been about six years now since I thought I was awake when I wasn't and was rudely awakened by the shitshow that is the COVID-19 pandemic.

16:02.153 --> 16:10.896
This was an elaborate national security theater that had been set up decades ago with 60 Minutes episodes and SARS and

16:11.636 --> 16:13.717
and mares and all of this stuff.

16:13.837 --> 16:21.021
It's all one malevolent show going all the way back to HIV, chronic fatigue syndrome, the whole nine yards.

16:21.801 --> 16:32.567
And 9-11 was likely supposed to be a version of the COVID-19 pandemic, a version of 9-11, but with a biological spin to it.

16:33.607 --> 16:50.799
And it's hard to really figure out why President, then only Senator Joe Biden, the day before 9-11 was talking very aggressively about the possibilities of all kinds of biological attacks, including an airplane full of anthrax.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.841
And so I don't, I don't,

16:55.734 --> 16:58.576
I don't purport to know what happened on 9-11.

16:58.657 --> 17:04.401
I do suggest that not only were the buildings demolished, but they were demolished for a reason.

17:05.783 --> 17:12.248
And that maybe even they were demolished and then we were told a different reason than what they were originally intended to be used for.

17:13.229 --> 17:14.310
I'm not really sure.

17:14.590 --> 17:15.611
I don't really care.

17:17.560 --> 17:25.406
I think that the bottom line is that what we have right now is an elaborate illusion that we consider American history.

17:26.507 --> 17:33.292
And for my personal and professional profile, for me, it is most important to

17:34.733 --> 17:47.665
reassess what it is that I would consider to be fundamental biology, because that's where I found myself as a professional and a catamagician, a wannabe tenured professor in neurobiology and study the brain for the rest of my life.

17:48.726 --> 17:58.014
And at the heart of that pursuit was this bad biology that, you know, we could learn a lot just based on the idea that evolution happened.

17:58.857 --> 18:01.900
because we know it happened, because we found DNA.

18:01.960 --> 18:06.245
That was at the heart of my understanding at the start of the pandemic in 2020.

18:07.766 --> 18:21.301
I was so focused on neurobiology and the small pigeonhole set of questions that I was interested in, framed in the methodology that I was an expert in, that I hadn't really considered

18:22.580 --> 18:33.035
Darwinian biology beyond the biology 101 explanation that I'd come to understand very well as a high school, you know, sophomore already.

18:34.637 --> 18:35.959
So it's a magnificent thing.

18:37.156 --> 18:51.926
in my own experience to have happened to myself and to my outlook on the world, given that I consider myself a biologist from birth almost, you know, since I was a little kid, I haven't been afraid of many things, except I was afraid of June bugs for a long time.

18:52.766 --> 19:00.832
I just, I marvel and I am very humble.

19:02.411 --> 19:06.313
when I say that it's taken me a whole lifetime to get where I am.

19:06.934 --> 19:20.161
And if it wasn't for that lifetime of commitment to that lifetime of love of biology, I wouldn't have found myself where I am now, where I can humbly admit I have no idea what I was talking about.

19:21.297 --> 19:24.499
from many perspectives before 2020.

19:24.679 --> 19:34.426
And that I feel as though I have a great deal more respect and insight into what fundamental biology really is now after these six years of work.

19:34.546 --> 19:35.947
And I'm very proud of that.

19:37.308 --> 19:46.955
And so moving forward, I wanna try and build on that with regards to trying to provide for my family and also try to give back to those people who,

19:47.575 --> 19:51.517
wittingly or unwittingly got me as far as they have gotten me up until now.

19:52.057 --> 20:05.264
And so I think America is in a very terrifying place, quite frankly, and I think everybody who's been paying even remote attention would probably agree with that.

20:06.965 --> 20:11.628
I'm pretty unnerved at the kind of rhetoric that I see.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.869
I don't hear that kind of rhetoric on the street.

20:15.267 --> 20:27.557
But social media leads me to believe that a lot of people are either on one side and believe that Donald Trump is part of a movement that's going to save America and we can't tolerate the left, we should put them in jail.

20:28.017 --> 20:28.698
And then there's the

20:29.767 --> 20:44.794
The other side, you know, that kind of thinks the opposite, that Donald Trump is the worst thing to ever happen on earth and that he's a bad guy and a rapist and a criminal and he's ruining America with his bad judges or something like that.

20:44.914 --> 20:52.497
And Charlie Kirk was just one of these dudes who was a part of this, you know, movement that's destroying America.

20:53.537 --> 20:56.779
And that dichotomy is not to be

20:58.365 --> 21:01.288
is not to be disrespected, but it is to be mocked.

21:02.869 --> 21:08.495
And the reason why it should be mocked is because that's not a 50-50 divide in America.

21:08.515 --> 21:10.857
And I want everybody really to wake up to that fact.

21:11.017 --> 21:16.923
It's really important to understand that unlike the elections that seem to be very close, 50-50, 51-49,

21:20.595 --> 21:25.899
The split in America on Donald Trump and on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:26.559 --> 21:30.522
and on COVID and on the vaccines is not 50-50.

21:30.802 --> 21:34.364
The truth is not getting out.

21:35.785 --> 21:46.272
And we are not at the verge of canceling a vaccine schedule and starting to retrospectively think about how it is that we got where we are.

21:46.332 --> 21:47.933
We're not anywhere near that.

21:49.247 --> 22:05.642
At best, we are in a situation where we are gonna admit that we took it a little too far, especially because all vaccines can't be good for all people, but mRNA has the methodological potential to be used for all people, to be personalized for all people.

22:06.022 --> 22:12.228
Transfection and transformation by DNA and RNA represents the next generation of medicines.

22:12.768 --> 22:35.116
And all of these people are scripted to kind of sort of aimlessly like sort of a drunken Kung Fu kind of wander there and then fall face first into personalized medicine that includes nucleic acid transfection and transformation, replacing the traditional vaccine schedule that over the next few years will be admitted to have some flaws.

22:36.476 --> 22:41.858
Maybe even by the same people who are arguing about whether it has flaws or not right now.

22:42.912 --> 23:00.357
And that wouldn't be very surprising because the same people have been in front of us for 20 years, arguing about the same things and promising us the same endpoints where we would have all the keys to the church and we would know exactly how to augment humans and fix genetic defects and this kind of thing.

23:01.177 --> 23:07.559
And this is all based on the idea that we found DNA, therefore evolution explains everything.

23:08.820 --> 23:12.041
We can understand why we are here because of evolution.

23:12.081 --> 23:14.742
And of course, this is also the basis for their morality.

23:15.983 --> 23:27.687
The idea that if this is the process that's occurring right now across generations, then as soon as we understand it, we are as a species kind of obligated to act on that knowledge.

23:28.672 --> 23:31.314
And that would mean directed evolution.

23:31.355 --> 23:32.696
That would mean selection.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.117
That would mean eugenics.

23:34.177 --> 23:40.383
That would mean making sure that we don't wander into a genetic space that isn't that great.

23:43.686 --> 23:51.313
You know, we wouldn't want to find ourselves a thousand years from now in the Stone Age again, because we, I don't know, bred the wrong people.

23:54.008 --> 23:55.490
That's where this is.

23:55.610 --> 24:00.174
That's exactly what these people have been thinking for a couple generations.

24:00.234 --> 24:02.296
That's what they tell each other at the dinner table.

24:02.717 --> 24:10.445
And the people who are still focused from grandparent to parent to child think like this.

24:11.932 --> 24:15.515
They believe that ultimately we should be thinking across generations.

24:15.575 --> 24:19.358
We should be harvesting all of this data as much as we possibly can.

24:19.798 --> 24:32.308
And they're already thinking about building the data infrastructure and the computing infrastructure necessary to apply a very brute force machine learning algorithm to the data that they know they need to collect.

24:33.186 --> 24:42.535
They don't know what's going to come out the other side, but they are convinced it'll be a number greater than zero useful ideas and useful pieces of information.

24:43.036 --> 24:48.722
And since the whole idea is, are we going to take control of the evolution of the species or not?

24:51.084 --> 24:52.786
Then the answer is clearly yes.

24:57.304 --> 25:08.966
And so once you're sitting at a table of people discussing this kind of premise and this kind of impetus for governance, then you're on a whole different page and a whole different timescale.

25:09.006 --> 25:12.467
Now, is lying about history any big deal anymore?

25:12.907 --> 25:21.069
Is telling little fibs about recent arguments between world leaders or what's going on in banks?

25:21.889 --> 25:29.994
harmful at all if the end goal is to take control of the evolution of the species across generational time frames?

25:32.396 --> 25:46.044
It's these kinds of time horizons that have almost been lost in our culture, where we're not really thinking about the world that we want to give to our kids, never mind the world that we want to work together with our children to build for their children.

25:47.990 --> 25:54.221
That's why over the past couple days, I haven't had my parents from Wisconsin come here to help me.

25:54.241 --> 26:01.734
I had some one random viewer from Switzerland come to my house and leave chocolate and a small bag of cash.

26:04.724 --> 26:16.169
because social media has fractured us across generations so that my own parents don't want to help me build a better world for my kids so that when my kids have grandkids, it's a better place.

26:16.689 --> 26:18.670
They're too concerned about themselves.

26:21.191 --> 26:27.894
And I'm afraid that my family is not a weird anecdotal example of what has happened across America.

26:29.693 --> 26:35.798
The weaponization of social media has made that occur across the Western world.

26:37.439 --> 26:47.547
And we spend more time trying to kindle relationships with people on social media than we do trying to kindle relationships with living, breathing people that live right next door to us.

26:51.390 --> 26:59.016
And now many, many people around the world are spending an enormous amount of their attention talking about one human.

26:59.858 --> 27:03.680
shot by one other human caught on video.

27:05.862 --> 27:11.145
When three million people die in America every year, just in America.

27:15.063 --> 27:16.865
This biology must be unlearned.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.026
That's how they trapped us.

27:18.966 --> 27:30.717
We need to understand the biology behind the pandemic, why the numbers were available and what was necessary in order to game those numbers to make it seem like on all sides that this was possible.

27:30.797 --> 27:34.260
Please, ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.

27:38.729 --> 27:48.834
I implore you, my fellow Americans, please consider the possibility that we were not brought to this point in our country's history by chance.

27:51.235 --> 28:06.963
That the disagreement that you may or may not have with your next door neighbor or the one across the street where one of us believes in the blue hat and one of us believes in the red hat and all of these narratives are completely incompatible cannot be by accident.

28:08.191 --> 28:13.774
It is not just because Donald Trump got elected twice and it's really screwed things up.

28:14.354 --> 28:23.439
It's not just because Donald Trump appointed a couple judges and because a couple more judges are fake and because they lie about it.

28:23.499 --> 28:25.861
No, it's by design.

28:28.922 --> 28:30.623
America is being euthanized.

28:32.364 --> 28:35.286
Maybe we have been being euthanized since the nineties.

28:37.352 --> 28:39.173
And we need to wake up right now.

28:40.054 --> 28:41.535
There is no civil war.

28:41.615 --> 28:43.076
There's no civil disagreement.

28:43.116 --> 28:46.278
There is only social media that is ripping us apart.

28:47.579 --> 28:51.642
If all of us got off of social media right now, all of this would end.

28:52.883 --> 28:54.524
Because it's for all the marbles.

28:54.584 --> 28:56.166
It's for the grandchildren of Earth.

28:56.226 --> 29:03.311
And the only thing they need is for us to allow grandchildren, our grandchildren, to use corporate social media.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.212
And it will be, without a doubt,

29:08.780 --> 29:09.700
Game over.

29:16.984 --> 29:23.727
And so that's why I think the substack of Peter McCullough is talking about what was written on the bullets.

29:31.751 --> 29:34.632
That's why I think they're debating about all these other shootings.

29:37.230 --> 29:40.113
That's why I think we're not having any intelligent debate about this.

29:40.173 --> 29:43.136
They may have already lost control, ladies and gentlemen.

29:46.259 --> 29:55.349
And if they haven't lost control, then I think you need to think about what that really means in terms of the theater, in terms of what's at stake, and in terms of what they are willing to do.

29:57.543 --> 30:07.751
I'm not saying anybody killed Kobe Bryant, but boy, Nike is sure selling a lot of Kobe clothing and a lot of Kobe shoes and a lot of his daughter's named shoes.

30:10.172 --> 30:10.933
Shamelessly.

30:14.836 --> 30:16.017
And I wonder how much.

30:16.892 --> 30:31.357
You know, like if an actor has read all of his lines, if it's not just as easy or even easier for the theater, not to bring him on stage anymore, but just kind of, you know, take him off stage and just refer to the previous acts.

30:34.518 --> 30:44.902
And if the National Security Theater is at that level, requiring that level of participation, well, then I don't know what to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, but these substacks are bullshit.

30:46.328 --> 30:49.229
And these people with substacks are full of shit.

30:49.829 --> 30:52.390
Because you don't need to write a substack to get here.

30:55.112 --> 31:03.695
You don't need to write pages and pages of substacks six days a week like any of these people have done for the last five years to get here.

31:03.735 --> 31:08.537
You don't need to study vaccines for 25 years to get right there.

31:09.637 --> 31:10.778
It took me about three.

31:12.742 --> 31:24.694
And I had people actively trying to prevent me from getting there, where intramuscular injection's actually a dumb idea from the late 1800s, and I've got the actual physical books to prove it.

31:26.576 --> 31:32.382
Transfection of healthy humans was always a crime, and I have the professional background to prove it.

31:33.510 --> 31:36.092
And I would be willing to testify to it in a court of law.

31:36.752 --> 31:38.033
RNA cannot pandemic.

31:38.073 --> 31:42.436
And I have the professional and molecular background to argue that.

31:42.496 --> 31:50.021
And I would argue it against anybody, including Kevin McKernan, who curiously enough, in 2023, I already did argue with him.

31:50.882 --> 31:54.284
And I already did wipe the floor with him like a dirty mop.

31:59.348 --> 32:02.190
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

32:02.987 --> 32:10.951
and arguing about its causes is like arguing about the causes of car crashes and not being any more specific than that.

32:11.391 --> 32:12.892
Car crashes are terrible.

32:13.292 --> 32:17.514
They usually involve more than one car and can often kill people.

32:17.894 --> 32:22.496
Car crashes are caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.421
It's exactly that stupid.

32:26.561 --> 32:29.183
And it's exactly that stupid by design.

32:29.263 --> 32:37.328
Exactly as stupid as calling somebody who is a man who wants to be a woman because that's how he feels a trans woman.

32:37.388 --> 32:38.649
That's ridiculous.

32:40.490 --> 32:41.391
And it's by design.

32:42.472 --> 32:45.974
That's why the bad biology is the easy way out, right?

32:46.074 --> 32:48.335
The bad biology is so easy to expose.

32:48.395 --> 32:49.816
I only need one slide.

32:50.297 --> 32:53.819
And anybody, if my head wasn't in the way, could read it in less than a minute.

32:56.414 --> 32:58.395
Jessica Rose has never gotten here.

32:59.595 --> 33:01.316
Robert Malone's never gotten here.

33:02.136 --> 33:05.977
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, none of them have ever gotten here.

33:06.077 --> 33:08.158
And Peter Hotez has never gotten here.

33:08.238 --> 33:15.741
Tony Fauci has never been able to get here and explain to you any of these things and why they would be wrong.

33:17.358 --> 33:26.882
In fact, I would go so far as to say Debunk the Funk, Dan Wilson, and Professor Dave, and anybody else on that side will never touch this slide.

33:27.782 --> 33:31.484
We'll never tell you why autism isn't a meaningless word.

33:33.268 --> 33:38.850
We'll never tell you exactly how is it that RNA can pandemic over years and decades.

33:39.231 --> 33:43.993
How is it that transfection of healthy humans isn't what we just did?

33:44.133 --> 33:47.694
And why wouldn't that be old technology that all of you have lied about?

33:49.835 --> 33:57.239
Explain to me how it is that intramuscular injection isn't just a dumb idea from the late 1800s, but it's actually great.

33:59.219 --> 34:00.200
They won't do it.

34:01.277 --> 34:03.878
Because they can't, because this is the end.

34:06.260 --> 34:10.742
Just like when you say 9-11 wasn't about Muslim terrorists, it's the end.

34:12.183 --> 34:15.345
Unless you're gonna say it's space lasers, it's the end.

34:17.826 --> 34:24.550
Because what they want you to do is blame the Jews at the end of the rainbow with the big pot of gold.

34:28.621 --> 34:41.511
instead of blaming a puppeteered military state that has been governing us by a theater for a very, very, very long time that may have even involved remote control airplanes for the love of goodness.

34:45.414 --> 34:49.257
It's all one malevolent show.

34:51.399 --> 34:54.361
It's all one malevolent show.

34:54.421 --> 34:57.544
That's why Tony Fauci was on stage for so long.

35:00.316 --> 35:04.302
That's why Peter Daszak was on 60 Minutes across years.

35:05.744 --> 35:09.189
That's why George Webb was on 60 Minutes in February.

35:09.229 --> 35:12.854
And that's why Robert Malone provided the link in his substack in 2022.

35:15.523 --> 35:31.228
That's why Robert Malone has three books with children's health defense and Skyhorse Publishing, and that's why Skyhorse Publishing has a book in 2008 where they project that the presidential candidate would take independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:31.288 --> 35:36.810
as his vice president, and that Republican president would get shot, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.211
would become president of the United States and save the world.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.513
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been had.

35:47.315 --> 35:49.157
We have been had, ladies and gentlemen.

35:49.417 --> 35:51.039
Oh my goodness, we have been had.

36:11.889 --> 36:14.551
This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org.

36:14.611 --> 36:31.145
Yesterday, I took the time to show you that Democracy Now!, a largely internet thingy thing with an Indian co-host, has been on for a long time, and they have been pushing this anti-vax narrative chorus for a long time.

36:31.805 --> 36:40.152
And in fact, as back as far as 2015, Mary Holland and Rand Paul and Paul Offit were doing the thing.

36:41.670 --> 36:48.393
And 10 years later, it's funny because Rand Paul and Mary Holland and Paul Offit are still doing the thing.

36:49.393 --> 36:50.634
And so it's pretty curious.

36:52.175 --> 36:55.356
I think it's really important for everybody to be able to see this.

36:55.456 --> 37:01.118
And I'm going to skip through that one because that's just the next video with Mary and then another video with Paul.

37:03.759 --> 37:04.680
It's remarkable.

37:05.522 --> 37:31.281
With grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah okay, so what I would like to do is listen to this statement without making too many comments because I will I will become very dark very fast But I just want to play this whole statement in you know without taking it out of context and then we're gonna watch democracy now and watch them cover a

37:32.700 --> 37:47.237
Charlie Kirk thing yesterday and a little bit of this statement, but not the whole thing So that's why I thought I'd play it first the whole thing and I apologize ahead of time if I do stop it to make a comment But I don't think I will I don't I hope he doesn't say anything too dumb here

37:48.462 --> 37:55.446
Charlie inspired millions and tonight all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.848
Sorry, I had to interrupt him already, but I forgot.

37:57.948 --> 38:06.813
I wanted to interject at the beginning and say that Robert Malone did a substack yesterday where he said that Charlie Kirk was his spiritual advisor.

38:09.151 --> 38:12.414
And I don't think the studio audience heard that.

38:12.935 --> 38:20.862
Robert Malone did a substack yesterday where he said that Charlie Kirk was his spiritual advisor.

38:22.684 --> 38:23.684
There, there they heard it.

38:25.506 --> 38:28.008
So it's pretty important, right?

38:28.048 --> 38:29.470
Don't forget that Donald Trump

38:31.257 --> 38:35.879
Don't forget that Donald Trump is the answer to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

38:35.839 --> 38:37.159
's 20 years of prayer.

38:37.359 --> 38:39.580
Apparently, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:39.620 --> 38:48.563
has been praying every morning for 30 minutes on his knees that God would put him in a position to cure the chronic disease epidemic in America.

38:48.623 --> 38:51.024
And Donald Trump is the answer to those prayers.

38:51.744 --> 39:09.579
And Donald Trump has put him at the head of NIHHS, and now he has been busy doing this thing that God put him in a position to do, although I'm not really sure that that's a genuine portrayal of who he is, where he is, how he got there, or what he's doing.

39:10.339 --> 39:15.203
And I don't want to be the guy who says that that's fraud, but I'm not buying it.

39:15.343 --> 39:20.587
I'm not buying it any more than I'm buying Sherry Tenpenny saying that she actually heard the voice of God.

39:21.638 --> 39:28.821
And that's why she works on vaccines and I don't know, goes on beach vacations and reads.

39:29.142 --> 39:40.087
I mean, these people and their associates, the people that encourage them, the people that fund them, they are all part of an elaborate con.

39:42.728 --> 39:46.190
And I think we need to wake up quick as an America.

39:46.690 --> 39:52.933
And the rest of the world needs to wake up, that they don't understand what's happening to America, what's being done to Americans.

39:53.533 --> 40:06.139
And so while you're over in your other countries in Europe or around the world judging what you think's happening in America, rest assured, whatever you see through the window of your social media is not what's happening in America.

40:06.159 --> 40:10.361
It's exactly what the oligarchs in America would like you to see.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.722
The ones that have,

40:12.222 --> 40:18.726
been busy euthanizing the American experiment for the last 50 years or so.

40:43.396 --> 40:52.625
Charlie was also a man of deep, deep faith, and we take comfort in the knowledge that he is now at peace with God in heaven.

40:53.565 --> 41:03.474
Our prayers are with his wife, Erica, the two young, beloved children, and his entire family, who he loved more than anything in the world.

41:04.015 --> 41:08.759
We ask God to watch over them in this terrible hour of heartache and pain.

41:09.704 --> 41:12.807
This is a dark moment for America.

41:13.468 --> 41:20.515
Charlie Kirk traveled the nation, joyfully engaging with everyone interested in good faith debate.

41:21.295 --> 41:32.226
Now, there's a choice to be made here, in my humble opinion, as to whether to say that this is a symptom of the divide in America and that there are

41:32.930 --> 41:59.656
you know, the actions of the shooter represent the desires of an entire side of America versus, you know, what has been done in the past, as far as I can remember, and always accentuating the fact that this person who did what they did doesn't represent the morals and ideals of American society, and that, you know, we want to make sure that we all acknowledge that, whereas now,

42:00.592 --> 42:15.696
For the first time really in American history, it does really appear on social media as though all of our leaders and influencers are going all in on the idea that this is intolerable and that anybody who speaks like this might even need to go in jail.

42:15.756 --> 42:16.956
Maybe we need some camps.

42:17.396 --> 42:21.097
And so remember, it's a very quick flip of the switch here.

42:21.517 --> 42:28.159
You know, these are the free speech people that got into office because, you know, COVID was censorship and censorship shouldn't be allowed.

42:29.773 --> 42:40.025
But now they're already firing people for saying that Charlie Kirk had it coming, or he might have asked for it, or F around and find out.

42:40.085 --> 42:47.874
All of these people are getting fired from their jobs now for simply saying that it's a dangerous life that he chose.

42:48.877 --> 42:58.623
going from university to university and humiliating a few people at every university because there are people who stepped to him and lost.

43:01.741 --> 43:11.667
And so amplifying those things on social media and social media being militarized against us, obviously is not anything that he's talking about.

43:12.047 --> 43:14.329
And it's nothing that anyone else is talking about.

43:14.469 --> 43:19.152
No one is going to tell you that without social media, that wouldn't have happened.

43:20.032 --> 43:37.060
They want you to believe that there are lots of Americans out there that are motivated enough to plan ahead enough to scout out a building, to get keys to a door, to prop a door open, to get a rifle, to carve some shit into some bullets, carry it up on there, to make one good shot, and then to try and get away.

43:38.761 --> 43:42.783
Even though most Americans can't even motivate themselves for a week of exercise.

43:44.298 --> 43:59.484
The only way that happens is social media, just like the only way that a kid from my kid's high school would have been on a roof in Butler, Pennsylvania in 2024 taking a shot at Donald Trump is because of social media.

44:01.869 --> 44:10.394
It's not because people are crazy, it's not because people on the left are the party of murder, and it's not because the people on the right are nationalist Christians.

44:10.974 --> 44:20.320
It's because of social media, and none of the scripted actors who are on social media and using it against us are ever gonna tell you that.

44:23.502 --> 44:30.306
His mission was to bring young people into the political process, which he did better than anybody ever.

44:31.257 --> 44:36.661
to share his love of country and to spread the simple words of common sense.

44:37.602 --> 44:43.566
On campuses nationwide, he championed his ideas with courage, logic, humor, and grace.

44:44.607 --> 44:58.878
It's a long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year,

44:59.642 --> 45:02.363
in the most hateful and despicable way possible.

45:03.063 --> 45:13.586
For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals.

45:14.286 --> 45:24.409
This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.

45:25.768 --> 45:46.244
My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.

45:46.745 --> 45:50.168
From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania last year,

45:50.768 --> 46:04.076
which killed a husband and father to the attacks on ICE agents, to the vicious murder of a health care executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and three others.

46:05.020 --> 46:11.143
Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.

46:11.704 --> 46:27.172
Tonight, I ask all Americans to commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died, the values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, and the patriotic devotion and love of God.

46:28.012 --> 46:34.057
Charlie was the best of America and the monster who attacked him was attacking our whole country.

46:34.698 --> 46:46.968
An assassin tried to silence him with a bullet, but he failed because together we will ensure that his voice, his message and his legacy will live on for countless generations to come.

46:47.769 --> 46:54.575
Today, because of this heinous act, Charlie's voice has become bigger and grander than ever before.

46:55.677 --> 46:56.998
and it's not even close.

46:57.698 --> 47:05.262
May God bless his memory, may God watch over his family, and may God bless the United States of America.

47:05.362 --> 47:05.863
Thank you.

47:06.803 --> 47:08.164
I mean, by design, right?

47:09.685 --> 47:15.588
Nobody in the greater Western world is gonna take that guy seriously.

47:16.889 --> 47:20.611
Everyone in the greater Western world is gonna be shown the worst clips

47:21.744 --> 47:30.811
where Charlie Kirk is talking about black people not having the intelligence to get where they are, so they had to fill the spot of white people.

47:32.612 --> 47:46.163
And again, remember, one of the things that Charlie Kirk does very poorly, in my humble opinion, is talk about white and black as if that's a real thing, which of course, from a biological perspective, it most certainly is not.

47:48.306 --> 47:53.789
And yet in America, one of the things that apparently everybody agrees on is that white and black is a real thing.

47:55.829 --> 47:56.850
And we should fight about it.

47:57.630 --> 47:58.791
And we should choose a team.

48:00.091 --> 48:01.112
And that's the mistake.

48:02.132 --> 48:07.074
That's the mistake that they always trick us into, you know, like the natural virus or the lab leak trick.

48:08.955 --> 48:15.078
Or, you know, the gender spectrum trick, or no, it's just XY and XX.

48:16.590 --> 48:20.393
It's all a presupposition that you accept.

48:20.793 --> 48:24.816
And that presupposition that you accept is always the slavery.

48:24.876 --> 48:26.097
It's always the trap.

48:26.177 --> 48:28.118
It's always the mental servitude.

48:29.519 --> 48:34.462
And so this guy's not going to tell you it's social media because he wants you on social media.

48:34.863 --> 48:39.466
He just wants truth social to be more influential than, than X is.

48:43.749 --> 48:55.512
There is a, of course, a version called Mastodon on which you could, you know, run your own platform like a soapbox and then everybody could just follow you and it would be just kind of a federated decentralized version of this.

48:56.272 --> 48:59.633
It actually exists because Blue Sky is that.

48:59.713 --> 49:01.014
Truth Social is that.

49:01.154 --> 49:04.075
Soapbox of Gigaohm Biological is that.

49:04.935 --> 49:06.195
It's all equivalent.

49:07.356 --> 49:12.177
There is a de-federated social media that we could use.

49:13.171 --> 49:15.356
and that in fact Donald Trump is using.

49:20.222 --> 49:21.483
Let's do it, ladies and gentlemen.

49:21.523 --> 49:22.323
I think we can do it.

49:22.503 --> 49:23.263
I think we can.

49:23.323 --> 49:24.144
I think we can do it.

49:24.224 --> 49:25.925
I think we can dispel this theater.

49:26.045 --> 49:27.045
I think we can.

49:27.125 --> 49:43.473
But it's very scary because, again, what we are supposed to believe is that in a world where adults cannot motivate themselves to regularly exercise, we are supposed to believe that someone with strong feelings woke up one day and decided to plan to shoot somebody at a public event.

49:44.173 --> 49:46.834
and followed through to full success.

49:46.874 --> 49:53.997
You know, like people who make New Year's resolutions that they're going to exercise three days a week and can't even make it to February.

49:58.839 --> 50:01.760
People that schedule dates and then cancel them.

50:06.072 --> 50:14.894
People that sign up for ballies and then, you know, get into long lawsuits with them because they don't want to follow through with even a year.

50:17.495 --> 50:19.215
Ladies and gentlemen, it's just absurd.

50:19.275 --> 50:22.076
The only way that it could have happened is with social media.

50:22.116 --> 50:26.056
And if it wasn't social media, then it was a professional killer and all bets are off.

50:26.096 --> 50:26.757
Who cares?

50:27.677 --> 50:28.577
It's just dumb then.

50:30.595 --> 50:37.400
Because all the people on social media are trying to tell us it was some kind of spontaneous action that reflects the way that people think in America.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.081
And it's not.

50:39.742 --> 50:40.463
It's just not.

50:49.210 --> 50:53.213

51:06.725 --> 51:07.825
Are they laughing?

51:10.866 --> 51:18.669
Are these two national security state actors just laughing as they come into this segment?

51:19.109 --> 51:21.410
Look very carefully and tell me they're not laughing.

51:30.649 --> 51:33.811
Welcome to our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.

51:35.052 --> 51:48.041
A manhunt is underway in Utah after the prominent far-right activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday as he spoke before a large outdoor crowd at Utah Valley University on the first stop of his fall campus tour.

51:48.701 --> 51:50.102
Kirk was 31 years old.

51:50.663 --> 51:58.108
He founded Turning Point USA when he was just 18, which grew into the largest right-wing youth movement in the country.

51:58.735 --> 52:04.197
He was a close ally of President Trump and one of the most influential young voices in the MAGA movement.

52:04.937 --> 52:09.879
Police believe Kirk was killed by a single shot, possibly fired from a nearby roof.

52:10.559 --> 52:18.282
Kirk was shot as he was responding to a question by an audience member about how many transgender individuals have been mass shooters.

52:18.302 --> 52:20.463
There's a lot, right?

52:20.543 --> 52:21.843
I'm going to give you some credit.

52:21.943 --> 52:26.065
Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?

52:26.733 --> 52:28.774
So he wasn't asked about trans shooters.

52:28.814 --> 52:32.776
He was asked about how many mass shooters have there been in America.

52:32.836 --> 52:36.719
And then Charlie will respond with, are you including gang violence?

52:36.759 --> 52:44.923
So it's very curious that our scripted shithead says specifically that he was being asked about trans people.

52:47.244 --> 52:50.866
But clearly the context that she shows has nothing to do with trans people.

52:50.926 --> 52:55.409
It is bewildering unless you understand that we are being played.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.381
counting or not counting gang violence.

52:58.621 --> 53:00.342
Great.

53:01.763 --> 53:08.926
Police have not yet identified transgender individuals have been single shot, possibly fired from a nearby roof.

53:09.627 --> 53:17.291
Kirk was shot as he was responding to a question by an audience member about how many transgender individuals have been mass shooters.

53:19.159 --> 53:20.581
I'm going to give you some credit.

53:20.621 --> 53:25.165
Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?

53:25.666 --> 53:27.247
Counting or not counting gang violence.

53:27.487 --> 53:27.768
Great.

53:30.651 --> 53:41.762
Police have not yet identified the shooter, but on Wednesday night, President Trump blamed the shooting on, well, what he called the radical left.

53:42.637 --> 54:00.331
It's long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible.

54:01.011 --> 54:09.137
For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst

54:10.018 --> 54:11.540
mass murderers and criminals.

54:12.240 --> 54:19.387
This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today.

54:20.228 --> 54:22.370
And it must stop right now.

54:23.720 --> 54:43.810
My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.

54:44.881 --> 54:56.046
During his address, Trump referenced several other attacks on public figures, including attempts on his own life, but made no mention of any Democratic politicians who've been the target of political violence.

54:56.626 --> 55:03.029
The shooting of Charlie Kirk— And so there they are, showing the video of Butler, PA, and him touching his ear.

55:03.049 --> 55:12.933
And I don't really know what to say, other than I think you're going to have to accept that the worst-case scenario is very bad.

55:13.837 --> 55:19.367
I don't think Trump knew that that was going to be staged, but I do think that it was staged.

55:19.447 --> 55:25.016
And I do think that he was told that if you hear gunshots, you put your hand to your ear and get down.

55:25.958 --> 55:27.701
And he didn't need to know any more than that.

55:28.638 --> 55:34.319
All he had to do was have one or two security agents that were aware of what else needed to be done.

55:34.739 --> 55:35.839
And the rest is history.

55:35.939 --> 55:37.500
Pose for the photograph.

55:38.220 --> 55:40.860
And now we're even going to make a painting of the photograph.

55:40.940 --> 55:47.941
And so when we have the leaders of the EU over, we're going to refer to the photograph and say, that wasn't a very good day.

55:50.062 --> 55:53.122
Is that really what people do when they get shot at?

55:53.182 --> 55:56.763
That they put a picture of it up on the wall?

55:56.783 --> 55:57.783
A great big one?

55:58.991 --> 56:00.032
Is that really what you do?

56:00.052 --> 56:02.914
Is that the class act kind of thing?

56:04.234 --> 56:05.395
I don't know, ladies and gentlemen.

56:05.435 --> 56:06.316
I just don't buy it.

56:07.216 --> 56:09.278
And I'm not saying Charlie Kirk wasn't shot.

56:09.338 --> 56:24.387
I'm saying that the same people who were willing to fake that shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania and blame it on a high school kid that nobody even talks about anymore, but lives like supposedly four blocks from my house and goes to the same fricking high school as my kid does.

56:25.508 --> 56:26.709
This is just absurd.

56:28.405 --> 56:31.207
It is absolutely positively absurd.

56:31.267 --> 56:37.931
They have lost control of the big narrative and they never expected to lose control of it like they've lost it.

56:38.112 --> 56:44.136
And the people that have lost control of the narrative are exactly the people that they needed to be the focus of it.

56:44.216 --> 56:49.779
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Robert Malone, all of these people are absolute frauds.

56:50.180 --> 56:57.785
And the only reason why people know is because of me and Mark Kulak and just a couple other people, because there's a whole chorus

56:58.625 --> 57:15.949
and a whole symphony of social media and a whole bunch of highly paid actors that are out there pretending that real events are happening and, and you know, we just are, this is the consequences of having a crazy president and a crazy HHS secretary and a crazy populace.

57:17.329 --> 57:23.471
It has nothing to do with the militarization of social media and the scrambling of people's brains by it.

57:23.591 --> 57:24.271
Nothing at all.

57:25.968 --> 57:33.897
comes less than three months after a Trump supporter assassinated Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home.

57:34.597 --> 57:40.103
Meanwhile, a number of prominent right-wing figures are already calling for Trump to target left-wing groups.

57:40.744 --> 57:45.189
Elon Musk wrote on X, quote, the left is the party of murder.

57:45.569 --> 57:48.010
The left is the party of murder.

57:48.070 --> 58:00.455
That's exactly the opposite of saying that, you know, people like this guy don't represent the morals and principles of the United States and that all American citizens are united in opposing this kind of violence.

58:02.256 --> 58:04.157
Isn't that what adults are supposed to say?

58:04.197 --> 58:06.097
And yet we don't have a president that will say it.

58:06.137 --> 58:07.938
We don't have a billionaire that will say it.

58:07.998 --> 58:10.099
We don't have anyone that will say it.

58:13.450 --> 58:17.913
In fact, the left is only going to say, I told you so, that he had it coming.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.076
This is not by accident.

58:22.116 --> 58:23.157
This is by design.

58:23.217 --> 58:31.103
And America needs to understand that the only way out is to disengage from social media and to re-engage with your neighbors.

58:32.564 --> 58:37.588
They want us to have a civil war so that they can have every reason to turn off the internet

58:38.376 --> 58:41.838
Turn on martial law and turn on digital ID.

58:42.038 --> 58:43.299
I guarantee it.

58:44.680 --> 58:47.602
All we got to do is rise to the occasion and start fighting.

58:49.623 --> 58:52.946
All they need to do is pretend that we've already started fighting.

58:53.006 --> 58:59.410
Maybe even they'll release a bunch of people and encourage a bunch of people to pretend there's fighting and then show it on the television.

59:02.079 --> 59:05.341
We need to be ready, ladies and gentlemen, because it's not going to get better.

59:05.401 --> 59:08.663
It's going to get worse because the narrative is breaking.

59:08.723 --> 59:15.087
The control that social media has over the world is starting to shake and shatter.

59:16.368 --> 59:18.169
The illusion is starting to break.

59:18.209 --> 59:19.570
And so now they're doubling down.

59:19.610 --> 59:20.830
They need more sirens.

59:20.910 --> 59:22.031
They need more smoke.

59:22.511 --> 59:23.632
They need more panic.

59:25.533 --> 59:31.557
And everybody that's locked in, they need to make sure they stay locked in because everybody that gets out stays out.

59:34.588 --> 59:35.869
Welcome to the real battle.

59:38.650 --> 59:49.736
The Manhattan Institute's Christopher Rufo wrote on X, the last time the radical left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J. Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years.

59:50.356 --> 59:58.781
It's time within the confines of the law to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.

59:58.921 --> 01:00:02.403
Are we really supposed to believe that they couldn't just simply

01:00:03.373 --> 01:00:12.319
you know, program a few things into social media and we wouldn't know who all these people are instantly, including having IP addresses and addresses and everything.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.784
Are we really supposed to believe that that's not even, that's a joke, right?

01:00:19.765 --> 01:00:20.625
This is a joke.

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:32.754
Anybody that's posting violent messages on social media is already well-known, already on a list, just like anybody that doubts the Trump shooting is already on a list with me.

01:00:34.073 --> 01:00:40.361
just like anybody who questions the no virus narrative as well as they question the COVID narrative is on a list just like me.

01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:47.851
And there ain't very many people that are on these really important lists, you know, like the list that doesn't believe in space lasers and 9-11.

01:00:49.315 --> 01:01:01.248
the list that knows about the DNA anthrax vaccine, the list that knows about Estes' keep offer, the list that knows that Les Weinstein, the father of Eric and Brent Weinstein, worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:01:01.228 --> 01:01:01.568
's dad.

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:04.591
That list is very frickin' tiny.

01:01:06.994 --> 01:01:07.795
But it is a list.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:35.369
Meanwhile, the far-right influencer Laura Loomer also wrote on X, quote, the best way President Trump— So these people are saying that X is important, that X is a kind of place to pay attention to, that Substack is a kind of place to pay attention to, and the colleague of Sasha Latupova's daughter Soph, Laura Loomer, is somebody to pay attention to.

01:01:37.742 --> 01:01:40.703
And that's how you can see that it's all one malevolent show.

01:01:41.463 --> 01:01:44.104
These people, in theory, could cover anything they wanted to.

01:01:46.005 --> 01:01:54.569
They don't have to give national and worldwide attention on their platform to Laura Loomer, but they do because they're scripted.

01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:58.010
Because they're scripted.

01:02:03.663 --> 01:02:08.869
can reinforce Charlie's legacy is by cracking down on the left with the full force of the government.

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:12.953
Jail every single leftist who makes a threat of political violence.

01:02:13.113 --> 01:02:13.914
Think about that.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.437
Now suddenly free speech is out the window, right?

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.363
Think about how absurd it is that they're talking like that.

01:02:22.443 --> 01:02:23.364
That's not American.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:28.825
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

01:02:29.305 --> 01:02:30.966
It's absurdity at its best.

01:02:31.026 --> 01:02:34.006
And that's the reason why I think now's the time to head for the exits.

01:02:34.086 --> 01:02:46.009
Now's the time to grab your kids and show them that you made a mistake, apologize to them and start explaining to them while the vast majority of adults in America and the rest of the Western world are confused.

01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:51.450
They are confused because they are using social media in an incredibly naive way.

01:02:54.926 --> 01:02:58.447
We can't allow for these people to live among us in society.

01:02:59.087 --> 01:03:07.809
These comments come despite evidence the vast majority of political violence in the United States is committed by the far right.

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:14.471
Last year, a unit of the Department of Justice published a major study on domestic terrorism.

01:03:15.171 --> 01:03:28.736
It found, quote, "...since 1990, far-right extremists have committed far more ideologically motivated homicides than far-left or radical Islamist extremists, including 227 events that took more than 520 lives," unquote.

01:03:33.078 --> 01:03:38.543
We're joined now by Jeff Charlotte, who's written extensively about political violence.

01:03:38.964 --> 01:03:44.589
He's journalist, author and professor of English and creative writing at Dartmouth College.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:50.715
His latest book is The Undertow, Scenes from a Slow Civil War.

01:03:51.156 --> 01:03:55.300
His most recent post on Substack is The Struggle is Long.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:56.973
Thank you.

01:03:57.073 --> 01:04:25.531
Substack and X, Substack and X, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, Substack and X, exactly like PBS NewsHour, exactly like Meet the Press, exactly like all of these shows because it is one malevolent show that is trying to increase the relevance of social media platforms around the world and their ability to inform the public or misinform them.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.482
which is one of the central ways that people are governed.

01:04:33.343 --> 01:04:45.047
Once you see it, you'll know why you need to download the PeerTube app and why you need to encourage the people that you trust to make their own website and provide their content on a PeerTube server.

01:04:46.587 --> 01:04:51.268
No more apps, no more algorithms, no more YouTube, no more Rumble.

01:04:51.448 --> 01:04:52.669
All of this shit goes.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:56.730
Thank you so much for joining us, Professor Jeff Charlotte.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:09.593
First, if you can respond to this horrific moment yesterday, as he was taking questions from the crowd.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:15.152
The assassination, one bullet to the neck.

01:05:15.793 --> 01:05:17.134
Talk about your response.

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:21.759
I talk about your response.

01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:23.481
I mean, this is just so gross.

01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:27.465
I think I think we're in a moment of great peril.

01:05:28.486 --> 01:05:34.752
The minute I heard this, spending the time that I do amongst

01:05:35.392 --> 01:05:56.207
right-wingers and reading right-wing media and fascist media and understanding their imagination of the moment, which is—look, I'm not going to take away that they've lost one of their own, and I don't doubt some of them mourn him, but you also see a certain amount of

01:05:56.887 --> 01:05:59.369
glee rippling through that world.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.550
The language that I keep seeing is the gloves are off.

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.571
Everything's on the table.

01:06:05.552 --> 01:06:06.232
It's on.

01:06:06.432 --> 01:06:07.893
Now it's time to do it, right?

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:18.759
So there's a... And again, that's him using social media to try and understand what he thinks is a part of the American population.

01:06:23.241 --> 01:06:28.630
And that is either just buffoonery or it is scripted bullshittery.

01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:30.833
But it's something wrong.

01:06:32.276 --> 01:06:36.462
Because there is no left and there is no right except for on social media.

01:06:37.383 --> 01:06:42.427
There is no MAGA movement, there is no MAHA movement, except for on social media.

01:06:42.467 --> 01:06:45.329
There is no resistance, except for on social media.

01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:51.073
There is no vaccine skepticism and anti-vax movement, except for on social media.

01:06:51.113 --> 01:06:54.215
There's no intellectual dark web, except for on social media.

01:06:56.377 --> 01:07:01.581
And there's no independent bright web, except for on PeerTube at stream.gigaohm.bio at the moment.

01:07:05.034 --> 01:07:16.263
a sense in which, rather than mourning their fallen comrade, they're seeing it as some— —fallen comrade, even though the left is the commies?

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.604
Like, see what they're doing here?

01:07:17.844 --> 01:07:18.985
See how stupid it is?

01:07:19.005 --> 01:07:25.630
—are seeing it as a license to further escalate political violence.

01:07:26.493 --> 01:07:31.777
Well, Jeff Charlotte, if you could just provide some broader context, explain who Charlie Kirk was.

01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:36.160
Oh, she has her Claire Craig glasses on, her Whitney Webb glasses, her, you know.

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:42.785
Was, and the kind of extremely broad influence that he had.

01:07:42.845 --> 01:07:47.768
I mean, some have commented that in fact- Is that an Amish dress with that stupid collar?

01:07:47.808 --> 01:07:49.129
What is going on here?

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.393
He was more important for Trump than some of his cabinet secretaries.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:08:03.347
Yeah, I really think this is he's one of the great underestimated figures outside right wing organizing circles.

01:08:03.367 --> 01:08:08.392
And that's because he had a three hour daily, three hour talk show.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:14.076
He had a bigger presence on TikTok than most political figures.

01:08:15.298 --> 01:08:17.860
And so there he is with Steve Bannon, of course.

01:08:19.639 --> 01:08:23.181
He was misunderstood as an influencer, and he was that.

01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:31.407
But primarily and fundamentally, what he was, was an organizer and a very, very effective one.

01:08:32.467 --> 01:08:40.613
You know, political analysts quibble over how essential he was to swinging so much of the youth vote to Trump.

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:43.935
But there's no question that he was a huge, huge part of it.

01:08:44.235 --> 01:08:45.216
And he did that by

01:08:46.016 --> 01:08:49.878
transforming far-right youth politics in America.

01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:53.800
The previous organizations had always been built around ideology.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:58.502
Rather, it was kind of a William F. Buckley conservatism or libertarianism.

01:08:59.322 --> 01:09:02.544
And Kirk's insight was that

01:09:03.164 --> 01:09:09.689
absolute devotion to the great leader, cult of personality, a central tenet of fascism.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:11.990
His politics would change.

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:16.994
His enemies were Trump's enemies, whoever that was that day.

01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:24.799
He was in so many ways—and I think Trump viewed him, this, as the son he really wanted to have.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.821
a figure of tremendous influence.

01:09:30.782 --> 01:09:39.124
And I think that's important for us to understand, because the scale of the right-wing reaction is going to be—is going to correlate with that.

01:09:40.485 --> 01:09:43.706
Professor Charlotte, talk about Turning Point USA.

01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:49.848
What is the significance of this organization and his role in building it?

01:09:51.434 --> 01:09:56.435
So he founded it in 2012, and at the time, he was kind of a Tea Party Republican.

01:09:56.455 --> 01:09:58.115
18 years old, right?

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:00.616
Yes, he was a young guy.

01:10:00.676 --> 01:10:02.456
He decided to drop out of college.

01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:07.097
I think a lot of people make a lot of that, and he couldn't even go to college.

01:10:07.397 --> 01:10:14.878
What the guy could do was organize and charm a rich old white man and raise money, and he did it.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:17.339
And he grew and grew it.

01:10:18.059 --> 01:10:21.961
and then took a turn toward Christian nationalism.

01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:24.201
It had originally been largely secular.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:30.024
It had originally been somewhat indifferent to or agnostic on LGBTQ plus rights.

01:10:30.104 --> 01:10:31.244
But he would see the moment.

01:10:31.264 --> 01:10:40.107
He was very good at, like his, you know, his hero, Trump, at sort of tacking ever rightward, wherever the current would take him.

01:10:40.387 --> 01:10:41.768
He built it to this behemoth.

01:10:44.571 --> 01:10:58.946
And so, again, what he's telling is a story of a guy who single-handedly built a network based on rich white men giving him money and going from campus to campus.

01:10:59.847 --> 01:11:06.411
And it's very similar story to how, you know, despite everybody's best efforts, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:06.491 --> 01:11:15.617
and CHD have been able to grift for like 10 years to the tune of multi-million dollars for over these years, even though they're just telling lies.

01:11:16.377 --> 01:11:28.531
And even though apparently this guy's just peddling a weak form of Christian nationalism as it suits him and never really was a Christian nationalist from the beginning, he's just some guy who gets away with grifting.

01:11:28.611 --> 01:11:37.221
It's such a weird, you know, how does somebody just have the knack to build a network of millions of people without any help?

01:11:38.442 --> 01:11:45.666
without, despite the best efforts of all the people that don't want him to succeed, Donald Trump has become president of the United States.

01:11:49.028 --> 01:11:55.191
Despite Paul Offit and all these people fighting for the truth against the anti-vax movement, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:55.211 --> 01:12:07.138
has gotten paid a half a million dollars a year for almost 10 years, and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker have both gotten paid more than a quarter million dollars a year for the last 10 years, despite the fact that they're just peddling lies.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:17.992
I'm sorry, but what I see here is just scripted actors reacting to the changes in the script, the parts that aren't in their little script.

01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:19.853
They just have to kind of play it by ear.

01:12:20.313 --> 01:12:31.282
They know the third rails, they know what they're supposed to say, and what they're supposed to say is something that leads to or evokes the premise of a civil war, which is ridiculous.

01:12:32.082 --> 01:12:36.626
Because if we have one, it will only be because of and on social media.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:45.921
I think it's worth noting because you're seeing some people saying, well, I disagree with what he said, but he was a champion of free speech.

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.001
He died debating.

01:12:47.482 --> 01:12:57.327
Look, the fact that he was murdered doesn't change the fact that he was an opponent of free speech.

01:12:57.347 --> 01:13:05.931
There's no other way to cut it for a man who created something called professor watch list, school board watch list to name and frighten

01:13:06.671 --> 01:13:29.979
uh people from teaching so you see why that's a problem right because he he did advocate for free speech it's on his website they just showed his website it's definitely there limited government the whole thing but then also at the same time seemingly his script is contradictory to that we could put up hours of videos that would really be kind of

01:13:32.265 --> 01:13:44.653
odd if we then regularly interspersed his testimony about Jesus and his testimony about Christ or his speaking about the Bible and Scripture.

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:51.077
It would seem very odd, you know, some of these comments about black people and their intelligence.

01:13:51.797 --> 01:14:00.623
It would seem very odd with some of these, you know, again, professor watch lists and trying to, you know, expose people in that way where

01:14:01.795 --> 01:14:04.879
And I'm not saying that this guy's right about Charlie.

01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:07.342
I'm not saying that Charlie's a good guy or a bad guy.

01:14:07.482 --> 01:14:11.327
I'm saying that the script allows for this level of confusion.

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:17.935
So that the only thing that can really happen to me if I try to get in here is to be a part of that confusion.

01:14:18.803 --> 01:14:29.312
And that's why it is obvious to me now in my heart, in my head, and in my very soul, that getting off of social media is the only thing that we can do to save ourselves.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:34.055
Because this is a theater and it does not matter how real it is.

01:14:34.776 --> 01:14:36.798
It does not matter how fake it is.

01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:41.862
It is a theater that combines actors and scripts and myths.

01:14:44.474 --> 01:14:50.727
And it's only feasible because we buy the ticket and we fricking open our phone and we start scrolling.

01:14:51.764 --> 01:15:05.068
advocated restrictions on what school teachers could teach, who called for, and there's a clip you can see online, who called for the televised public executions.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:12.951
And he had a pretty broad category in mind, but what was really chilling was he wanted this to be required viewing for children.

01:15:13.771 --> 01:15:19.113
And you can look at this clip and you can see his- And so does that sound like a guy, you know, who's

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:21.814
who's a follower of Jesus Christ.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:33.701
And you know, Donald Trump didn't say that Donald Trump said God, and that he was a man of faith, but actually Jay Bhattacharya tweeted today that this was a man of Christ.

01:15:34.142 --> 01:15:44.308
Jay Bhattacharya, NIH secretary tweeted, NIH director, that this was a man of Christ and he knew him.

01:15:49.122 --> 01:15:59.807
I don't want to be as dark as I feel, but it's very dark, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a malevolent script full of lies, and even lies about Jesus Christ.

01:16:01.207 --> 01:16:02.028
And that sucks.

01:16:04.348 --> 01:16:11.672
And so all the advice I can give you is that if you are a person of faith, I suggest that you pray.

01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:16.734
Because I don't have the answers.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.714
And I know social media does not have the answers.

01:16:22.216 --> 01:16:24.359
I know that old books might have the answers.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.085
I know that our heart has a lot more answers than social media does.

01:16:29.145 --> 01:16:33.711
And so you need to learn to think again.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:35.658
We need to learn to see again.

01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:41.485
His colleagues, they're sort of trolling, but Kirk again and again pulls it back to seriousness.

01:16:41.525 --> 01:16:43.167
And he says, no, no, no, this isn't a joke.

01:16:43.607 --> 01:16:50.956
This has to be a holy experience, a teaching experience for children watching enemies be killed.

01:16:52.037 --> 01:16:53.659
That is not a champion of free speech.

01:16:54.239 --> 01:17:03.342
Jeff Charlotte, his main issues, immigration, women's rights, abortion, gun control, a major one, as you talked about.

01:17:03.382 --> 01:17:05.362
He repeatedly praised the Second Amendment.

01:17:05.422 --> 01:17:07.283
This is going back to April 2023.

01:17:07.763 --> 01:17:13.164
Never live in a society where you have an armed citizenry and you won't have a single gun death.

01:17:13.745 --> 01:17:14.545
That is nonsense.

01:17:14.605 --> 01:17:15.105
It's drivel.

01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:17.646
But I think it's worth it.

01:17:19.284 --> 01:17:28.626
I think it's worth to have a cost of unfortunately some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God given rights.

01:17:29.566 --> 01:17:35.027
And this is Charlie Kirk speaking on his podcast in June discussing mass.

01:17:35.107 --> 01:17:39.968
So is it possible that somebody would shoot him for that opinion?

01:17:40.548 --> 01:17:48.469
See the level of insight that these people have is very, very skewed in a way that can only be explained by a script.

01:17:52.225 --> 01:18:01.034
deportation, what he called Project 10 Million, which would launch a soft civil war, he said, in the United States.

01:18:02.222 --> 01:18:04.303
I'm telling you, everybody, we need to do Project 10 Million.

01:18:04.343 --> 01:18:09.506
Project 10 Million is removing the 10 million alien invaders in this country.

01:18:09.586 --> 01:18:10.566
We have 25, 30 million.

01:18:11.267 --> 01:18:16.249
10 million is going to be a big number in four years, which is basically going to launch a soft civil war in the major cities.

01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:19.651
That's why what's happening in New York is so important, which we'll talk about later in the show.

01:18:20.191 --> 01:18:21.372
That's why what's happening in L.A.

01:18:21.432 --> 01:18:22.052
is so important.

01:18:23.293 --> 01:18:24.954
So that was Charlie Kirk.

01:18:25.554 --> 01:18:27.095
Chef Charlotte, your response?

01:18:29.065 --> 01:18:31.406
Yeah, you know, you said his big issues and you gave a list.

01:18:31.486 --> 01:18:33.287
I would say his big issue was singular.

01:18:33.367 --> 01:18:34.107
It was whiteness.

01:18:35.427 --> 01:18:39.689
And he would express it in any number of different kinds of ways.

01:18:40.069 --> 01:18:45.831
When he spoke of immigration, he was a subscriber to the conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement Theory.

01:18:46.331 --> 01:18:56.995
And he was explicit in his very old school anti-Semitic ideas that mysterious Jewish donors were funding an effort to de-whiten

01:18:59.096 --> 01:18:59.717
America.

01:19:00.918 --> 01:19:05.642
He was radicalizing even further rightward before his eyes.

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:08.544
Until 2023, he would praise MLK.

01:19:09.084 --> 01:19:16.270
Afterwards, he started calling the Civil Rights Act one of the great wrongs of American life.

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:30.514
And he would engage in openly racist talk, saying that, I don't even like to give a voice, but saying that black women didn't have the mental processing power to hold these positions.

01:19:30.715 --> 01:19:39.717
And so now he's misrepresenting those words, because he was referring to specific black men and specific black women when he said that, even though I'm not defending the statement.

01:19:40.138 --> 01:19:44.259
I'm just showing you how even these reporters can't seem to get it right.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:49.529
It is the lack of precision combined with the seeming certainty.

01:19:51.049 --> 01:19:54.010
that shows you it's a national security theater.

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.930
These people aren't trying to be measured with their words.

01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:59.090
They aren't trying to be humble.

01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:10.052
They are certain, just like Donald Trump was certain, just like Elon Musk on X, appears to be certain that there is a right, that there is a left, and that they're about to fight.

01:20:10.192 --> 01:20:19.174
And it's just stupid because there are only confused Americans that have skillfully used social media with a great deal of naivety.

01:20:20.154 --> 01:20:21.495
It's a military operation.

01:20:21.995 --> 01:20:22.816
Responsibility.

01:20:22.836 --> 01:20:27.278
And if you saw one in such a place, she had stolen that job.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:29.959
Again and again, it came into whiteness.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:37.624
And he closed it in a Christianity that was unrecognizable to so many Christians of real faith.

01:20:38.624 --> 01:20:41.346
It was an extreme language.

01:20:41.986 --> 01:20:47.049
And as with Trumpism in general, it was

01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:52.755
mutating and moving ever rightward right before our eyes.

01:20:52.775 --> 01:20:55.479
Mutating and ever moving rightward.

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:01.371
Back to Claire Craig from India.

01:21:01.931 --> 01:21:11.178
After the shooting, soon after the shooting yesterday, Wednesday, you warned people not to celebrate.

01:21:11.218 --> 01:21:20.263
You wrote, if I have any credibility with you from 20 years of reporting on right wing and fascist movements, please listen when I beg you not to celebrate Charlie Kirk getting shot.

01:21:20.624 --> 01:21:21.464
Don't celebrate it.

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:22.985
Don't mock it.

01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:26.688
On the one hand, you saw quotes.

01:21:27.068 --> 01:21:28.429
Why would anybody do that?

01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:35.263
Why would he have the preconception that people would be inclined to do that?

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:42.755
It's remarkable, ladies and gentlemen, because nobody will admit it's just social media.

01:21:42.816 --> 01:21:46.719
Nobody will even entertain the option that it's just social media.

01:21:47.119 --> 01:21:50.022
… people on social media doing that.

01:21:50.582 --> 01:22:01.372
On the other hand, this morning, you've commented on this piece—and I'd just like to read an excerpt—New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein writing this morning, quote,

01:22:01.972 --> 01:22:06.956
You can dislike much of what Kirk believed, and the following statement is still true.

01:22:07.317 --> 01:22:10.299
Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way.

01:22:10.619 --> 01:22:14.302
He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him.

01:22:14.623 --> 01:22:18.186
He was one of the era's most effective practitioners of persuasion.

01:22:18.546 --> 01:22:26.052
When the left thought its hold on the hearts and minds of college students was nearly absolute, Kirk showed up again and again to break it.

01:22:26.513 --> 01:22:28.214
Slowly, then all at once, he did.

01:22:28.514 --> 01:22:28.815
He did.

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:37.366
College-age voters shifted sharply right in the 2024 election," Ezra Klein wrote again this morning in The New York Times.

01:22:37.807 --> 01:22:40.050
So, if you could comment on that.

01:22:42.896 --> 01:22:46.458
Yeah, I mean, here's a really, to me, very simple fact.

01:22:46.898 --> 01:22:48.279
Murder is murder.

01:22:48.699 --> 01:22:50.040
You don't celebrate it.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.621
You don't need to mock it.

01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:54.622
But you also don't euphemize.

01:22:54.822 --> 01:22:58.084
You don't whitewash the dead.

01:22:58.464 --> 01:23:01.165
Kirk did not practice politics in the right way.

01:23:01.225 --> 01:23:04.787
He boasted of fomenting the J6 insurrection.

01:23:05.227 --> 01:23:08.209
As I said, he called for televised

01:23:08.809 --> 01:23:09.649
executions.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.471
He used the most vile language.

01:23:13.851 --> 01:23:16.152
He practiced a McCarthyism on campuses.

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:18.153
This is not free speech.

01:23:18.233 --> 01:23:20.774
There is no need in speaking.

01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:23.875
We can speak against political violence.

01:23:24.275 --> 01:23:26.756
Now, again, this is not a real argument.

01:23:27.856 --> 01:23:30.498
The New York Times reporter is scripted.

01:23:30.558 --> 01:23:31.538
This guy is scripted.

01:23:31.558 --> 01:23:33.679
They don't need to know they're being played.

01:23:35.179 --> 01:23:36.600
They just need to be this naive.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:24:03.979
His social feed is social media feed is weaponized against him The social media feed of Ezra Klein is weaponized against him and these people only see who they're meant to see These people probably don't even know who Robert Malone was until three months ago Ladies and gentlemen, we can break out America can be free of this and it is very simple you get your kids off of social media and

01:24:04.398 --> 01:24:10.461
without somehow twisting ourselves around to defend others who spoke for it.

01:24:10.901 --> 01:24:19.725
We don't have to imitate Kirk's violent rhetoric, nor do we have to cover it up.

01:24:19.985 --> 01:24:21.665
We have to name it accurately.

01:24:22.166 --> 01:24:23.446
Accurately is what it was.

01:24:23.666 --> 01:24:24.787
We have to name the murder

01:24:25.367 --> 01:24:29.830
of Kirk accurately as what it was, an assassination, a murder.

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:39.056
And, you know, I said, if I have—if my, whatever, 20 years of reporting gives me any credibility, a whole lot of people told me it doesn't.

01:24:39.957 --> 01:24:48.122
We're in a moment where I understand the anger of—people want to celebrate it.

01:24:48.142 --> 01:24:51.625
They think—I hear people saying, you know, what more can fascism

01:24:56.650 --> 01:25:03.054
Let me be clear, only in a world where adults cannot motivate themselves to exercise, social media can do it.

01:25:03.634 --> 01:25:09.457
Social media could make a person with strong feelings wake up one day and decide to plan to shoot somebody at a public event.

01:25:09.998 --> 01:25:10.578
But that's it.

01:25:11.158 --> 01:25:17.282
That's the only way that somebody by the name of Matt Crooks from my kid's high school could have been on a roof in 2024.

01:25:17.802 --> 01:25:20.543
That's the only way that some random might have done this.

01:25:20.684 --> 01:25:22.905
And I don't think, in this case, a random did it.

01:25:23.405 --> 01:25:39.043
But I want you to understand why social media is the culprit here because even if Even if it is a professional shooter social media is used and being used to confuse you about it and that is

01:25:39.944 --> 01:25:40.965
the power.

01:25:41.545 --> 01:25:45.568
That is the power we don't want our kids to be enslaved by.

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:55.094
Ladies and gentlemen, if your or your family fell for the fake health freedom movement, please send an email to GigaOMBiological.com.

01:25:55.134 --> 01:25:55.634
Let us know.

01:25:55.714 --> 01:25:58.116
Getting off of social media is what you really need to do.

01:25:59.376 --> 01:26:01.157
This is fifth generation warfare.

01:26:01.197 --> 01:26:02.358
Make no doubt about it.

01:26:03.599 --> 01:26:07.782
We are in a trap and it is closing quite rapidly.

01:26:09.283 --> 01:26:13.586
And let me find this music here and see if I can get this working.

01:26:15.608 --> 01:26:17.590
Thank you very much to all of our donors.

01:26:18.911 --> 01:26:21.113
Joanna, we got your letter today.

01:26:21.133 --> 01:26:21.973
Thank you very much.

01:26:22.634 --> 01:26:23.715
Not very much in the P.O.

01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:24.435
box lately.

01:26:26.297 --> 01:26:26.497
P.O.

01:26:26.537 --> 01:26:28.399
Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, 15102.

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.882
This is the Independent Bright Web.

01:26:32.242 --> 01:26:33.983
Thank you very much for being here, everybody.

01:26:34.003 --> 01:26:36.645
I will see you again in a few minutes.

01:26:36.665 --> 01:26:41.129
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:43.311
We want everybody to feel good.

01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:45.553
That's not the way life is.

01:26:47.757 --> 01:26:48.477
Let me see.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:49.377
What do we got here?

01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:50.278
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.278
I was gonna show you this.

01:26:51.318 --> 01:27:12.262
So I want to watch this later There's a very nice interview with my friend Dan Cohen He nails it hits it out of the park pretty well I just wanted to make sure you understand second thoughts about your mitigation recommendations considering the evidence that despite in 2022 senator Rand Paul was arguing and talking with

01:27:12.822 --> 01:27:17.504
Tony Fauci, less developed world that is unable to do any of the things that you've been promoting.

01:27:17.884 --> 01:27:19.405
Do you have any second thoughts?

01:27:19.565 --> 01:27:25.468
Are you willing to look at the data that countries that did very little actually have a lower death rate to the United States?

01:27:26.148 --> 01:27:26.668
Hopefully.

01:27:26.888 --> 01:27:32.171
And I am, and my colleagues are humble enough and modest enough to realize that it's not any different than this.

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:40.362
In that hearing today, Secretary Kennedy made a number of questionable or misleading claims about vaccines, COVID, and the health of Americans.

01:27:40.782 --> 01:27:43.803
Joining us now to unpack some of those is Dr. Richard Besser.

01:27:43.983 --> 01:27:51.226
He's former acting director of the CDC in the Obama administration, now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

01:27:51.386 --> 01:27:54.687
And, for the record, we should note the foundation is a funder of the NewsHour.

01:27:54.707 --> 01:27:56.028
Dr. Besser, welcome back to the show.

01:27:56.048 --> 01:27:56.788
Thanks for joining us.

01:27:57.677 --> 01:27:58.257
Great to be here.

01:27:58.277 --> 01:27:58.738
Thank you.

01:27:58.778 --> 01:28:02.220
So, Secretary Kennedy made a big claim in the hearing I want to ask you about.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.462
He said that America is the sickest country in the world.

01:28:05.763 --> 01:28:06.823
Take a listen to how he put it.

01:28:07.484 --> 01:28:12.047
If we don't end this chronic disease, we are the sickest country in the world.

01:28:12.648 --> 01:28:14.949
That's why we have to fire people at the CDC.

01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:17.131
They did not do their job.

01:28:18.071 --> 01:28:20.113
This was their job to keep us healthy.

01:28:20.693 --> 01:28:21.574
Dr. Besser, the U.S.

01:28:22.247 --> 01:28:25.792
In a way, you could see that as being part of the illusion right there.

01:28:26.513 --> 01:28:29.457
The CDC is responsible for keeping us healthy?

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.501
Why would that be?

01:28:32.802 --> 01:28:33.803
Don't we have doctors?

01:28:34.725 --> 01:28:37.969
What does the CDC do between me and my doctor?

01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:42.497
Why is the CDC supposed to keep everybody healthy?

01:28:42.577 --> 01:28:48.903
That's a weird assertion as to what the CDC has providence over.

01:28:49.143 --> 01:28:50.385
It's strange in a way, right?

01:28:50.445 --> 01:28:52.807
Please, we need a good CDC.

01:28:52.867 --> 01:28:54.989
We need a CDC who does the job.

01:28:56.730 --> 01:28:59.433
Fends more than any other nation on healthcare.

01:28:59.513 --> 01:29:02.436
Is it accurate to say we are the sickest country in the world?

01:29:03.476 --> 01:29:11.160
Well, I don't think I would say we're the sickest country in the world, but I would agree with the Secretary that we're not getting the return on the investment.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:14.842
And a lot of that has to do with where we're spending our money.

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:21.745
We're spending our money on healthcare services rather than on public health and other approaches to prevention.

01:29:22.526 --> 01:29:26.728
He cites as part of the argument there what he says is a huge spike with chronic disease.

01:29:26.768 --> 01:29:34.532
That number caught a lot of... And see what he's... I think if it's an area where nothing could be done to make sure... I'm hearing the secretary... About chronic diseases.

01:29:35.339 --> 01:29:37.180
Well, I don't know what he's talking about there.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:46.027
When the secretary was being confirmed, one of the things he said is that he's not a scientist and you shouldn't look to him for scientific information.

01:29:46.167 --> 01:29:51.610
This is one of those situations where I would need to fact check that statistic.

01:29:51.951 --> 01:30:02.018
But I wouldn't argue that we have real issues in America with chronic disease, and it's something where if you pull together the best and the brightest around science, we could make real progress.

01:30:02.824 --> 01:30:15.583
There's another heated moment you heard Lisa report on there in the tape when Democratic Senator Mark Warner asked Secretary Kennedy about how many people died from COVID, and Kennedy answered, I don't think anybody knows that.

01:30:16.304 --> 01:30:18.126
Do we know the answer to that, Dr. Besser?

01:30:18.823 --> 01:30:19.163
We do.

01:30:19.183 --> 01:30:27.388
When it comes to public health and data, you use all kinds of different tools to try and estimate what those numbers are.

01:30:27.948 --> 01:30:33.591
And we know that in the United States, over a million lives were saved due to the COVID vaccines.

01:30:33.651 --> 01:30:36.432
And we know around the world, millions of lives were saved.

01:30:36.832 --> 01:30:41.675
So for him to say we don't know, well, you may not know an exact number, but when you're

01:30:41.755 --> 01:30:48.838
That's funny because he actually missed it because we were talking about how many people die from COVID and he's talking about how many people were saved by the vaccine.

01:30:48.998 --> 01:30:51.480
Talking about millions, that's pretty incredible.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:58.463
And it's one of the big accomplishments of the first Trump administration was how quickly we got so many safe.

01:30:58.803 --> 01:31:01.304
I mean, he deserves a Nobel Prize for it, right?

01:31:01.424 --> 01:31:02.665
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:02.725 --> 01:31:03.105
agrees.

01:31:03.165 --> 01:31:06.787
They all agree that they deserve a Nobel Prize for warp speed.

01:31:07.387 --> 01:31:08.609
It's remarkable.

01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:12.415
It's exactly where I said they were taking us in 2021.

01:31:12.736 --> 01:31:22.190
Highly effective vaccines to the people here in the United States, as well as due to the research from the National Institutes of Health for people around the globe.

01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:30.880
Just to underscore that point on the efficacy of the vaccines, because the secretary was asked repeatedly about whether or not the COVID vaccine saved lives.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:35.545
He wouldn't say definitively, and he said he wanted to see the data and take a look at the data.

01:31:35.866 --> 01:31:39.510
What do we know about the efficacy of the COVID vaccine?

01:31:40.202 --> 01:31:46.608
We know that the COVID vaccine is extremely safe and extremely effective.

01:31:47.008 --> 01:31:54.715
You saw differences in effectiveness based on which vaccines, the mRNA vaccines, the technology that the secretary is putting in.

01:32:13.467 --> 01:32:18.621
Oh, once upon a midnight dreary I woke with something in my head

01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:47.702
I couldn't escape the memory of a phone call and of what you said Like a game show contestant with a parting gift I could not believe my eyes When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend Who needs to humor me and tell me lies Yeah, humor me and tell me lies And I'll lie to you and say I don't mind And as we sit so shall we find

01:32:49.923 --> 01:32:49.990
you

01:33:20.683 --> 01:33:40.742
many things but up in there I can see it how a lot of nervous magician waiting in the wings of a bad play where the heroes are right nobody thinks or expects too much hollywood's calling for the movie right singing hey baby let's keep in touch

01:33:41.523 --> 01:33:44.264
Hey, baby, let's keep in touch.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.645
But I want more than a touch.

01:33:46.665 --> 01:33:51.126
I want you to reach me and show me all the things no one else can see.

01:33:51.486 --> 01:33:54.227
So watch, I feel, we combine as well.

01:33:54.267 --> 01:33:59.129
And soon, if we're lucky, we'll be unable to tell what's yours and mine.

01:33:59.389 --> 01:34:02.790
The fishing's fine, and I'm diving at the run, so don't you fear.

01:34:10.419 --> 01:34:11.560
when all it does is

01:34:41.598 --> 01:35:07.795
And I've got some news for you It's in my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can get I'm sure the battery's torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress rules I should drink it and always be full Yeah, I will drink it and always be full Alright!

01:35:14.423 --> 01:35:16.383
This dream that you just can't shake.

01:35:16.523 --> 01:35:19.484
I love you to the point you can't no longer take.

01:35:19.624 --> 01:35:20.324
Well, all right.

01:35:20.884 --> 01:35:22.705
OK, so be that way.

01:35:22.745 --> 01:35:27.946
I hope and pray that next Sunday that you say, buddy, yeah.

01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:32.327
Why do you want to give me a run around?

01:35:32.347 --> 01:35:38.248
Is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down?

01:35:38.408 --> 01:35:39.348
Oh, yeah.

01:35:44.907 --> 01:35:51.614
It's your fireway to beat things up When all it does is slow heartbeat

01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:29.131
Gotta love good music, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:33.035
If there's one thing that can save us, it's listening to good music whenever needed.

01:36:34.516 --> 01:36:35.297
I'm going to reverse.

01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:36.699
I'm going to put this at the start again.

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:38.901
And then we'll listen.

01:36:39.813 --> 01:36:47.016
I think you're going to really love what they're trying to hide is the fact that these operations go on all over the world all the time.

01:36:47.196 --> 01:36:51.818
And if this one gets laid out for all of us to see, we're going to be able to find others.

01:36:52.398 --> 01:36:58.761
And it compromises some very serious intelligence operations that have been going on for decades all over the place.

01:37:00.161 --> 01:37:00.601
It might.

01:37:00.942 --> 01:37:08.725
I'm not even I mean, of course, honeypot is like a real, you know, a real intelligence tool, you know, sending like

01:37:11.724 --> 01:37:12.865
He's talking, excuse me.

01:37:16.808 --> 01:37:25.855
The host is talking about Epstein and about how the list and the revealing of the list would expose all kinds of other intelligence operations.

01:37:25.916 --> 01:37:29.819
And so I just want to remind you, I apologize.

01:37:29.859 --> 01:37:31.280
I have to eat lunch before I go to the gym.

01:37:32.881 --> 01:37:37.365
I want to remind you that I'm making the assertion

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:53.041
that this cannot possibly be, the US government and governments around the world cannot possibly be run by a combination of drugs, sex, and blackmail.

01:37:53.101 --> 01:37:54.263
That's impossible.

01:37:55.256 --> 01:38:12.165
And while some characters in the show may be controlled that way, or manipulated that way, or may have agreed to participate because of sex, drugs, or blackmail, that doesn't mean that the entire aircraft carrier works that way.

01:38:13.745 --> 01:38:16.847
The vast majority of people have to believe in what they're doing.

01:38:16.887 --> 01:38:23.690
They can't all be controlled by negative enforcement.

01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:24.911
That's not possible.

01:38:25.922 --> 01:38:29.243
And so it's absurd to pursue it that way.

01:38:30.163 --> 01:38:36.685
It has to be something that people are along with, and that's why what I said in the beginning of the stream is so important.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:47.648
If you believe that DNA has provided evidence that evolution happens, then you believe that we basically have the multi-generational

01:38:48.621 --> 01:38:56.103
incentive, responsibility to take control of the evolution of the species so that we don't end up all being troglodytes.

01:38:58.544 --> 01:39:03.685
And that would be enough to motivate people to participate in a theater like this.

01:39:03.865 --> 01:39:11.447
Not these guys, but in general, what we are trying to fight, what I hope Dan and myself and Mark are trying to fight together.

01:39:12.786 --> 01:39:19.828
getting politicians or, or celebrities or who it is in compromising positions and using that as blackmail is a real thing.

01:39:22.049 --> 01:39:31.852
I, I don't know how, you know, without like seeing evidence, I don't know how prevalent or common or it is.

01:39:32.293 --> 01:39:33.113
And I feel like

01:39:34.241 --> 01:39:41.143
The Epstein thing is on the front page of the New York Times, I think, yesterday or I don't know if it was today or yesterday.

01:39:41.163 --> 01:39:50.526
I'm like, the New York Times won't even say the word Israel's committed, you know, won't say that Israel's committing a genocide, but they're like pushing the Epstein thing.

01:39:50.926 --> 01:39:52.627
I'm like, I don't know.

01:39:52.667 --> 01:39:56.648
The New York Times is, you know, has done all kinds of crazy propaganda to cover for this.

01:39:57.529 --> 01:39:58.329
I just feel like

01:39:59.964 --> 01:40:06.974
the, I feel like it's just a little bit, like I said, too on the nose, like it's being like we're being baited in a way with it.

01:40:07.414 --> 01:40:16.907
And there's something and there's something much deeper that I mean, and also like when you think about what is more

01:40:18.362 --> 01:40:27.830
like, perfect for, like, low-grade Twitter slop than, like, some, like, crazy Jew running a pedophile blackmail rank.

01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:28.471
You know what I mean?

01:40:28.571 --> 01:40:35.977
It's, like, it's so easy that, like, yeah, I feel like we're kind of being, like, led around by the nose with it.

01:40:36.317 --> 01:40:44.745
You know, again, I'm not denying the true stuff that's out there, but I feel like it's being overblown in order to distract

01:40:46.325 --> 01:40:48.806
from from other things that are happening.

01:40:50.026 --> 01:41:04.689
And like, you know, the more I mean, the way that that Trump and Vance and Kash Patel and like, the Trump administration blew this up to be this huge thing, and we're going to take them down.

01:41:04.769 --> 01:41:06.750
And, oh, actually, they're in on it.

01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:12.831
And, you know, it's like, it's like, it's, I think they just the same way, you know,

01:41:13.723 --> 01:41:19.645
Like Democrats used Russiagate, oh, we're getting this big conspiracy and their base ate it up.

01:41:20.105 --> 01:41:27.848
It's kind of, there's, I mean, except there's more truth with the Epstein thing in the sense that, yes, Epstein actually did commit crimes.

01:41:29.168 --> 01:41:46.692
But like, those kernels of truth are being extrapolated into something much greater that it's like, this is the conspiracy that really, if we understand this is like a proxy for understanding why our system works the way it is, why we don't have accountability for this, that and the next thing.

01:41:46.732 --> 01:41:50.193
And so I don't know, again, hey, put

01:41:50.653 --> 01:41:51.774
Maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong.

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:59.080
Maybe you're totally right that it's like there that this, you know, we'll end up This one will be uncovered and that will uncover others.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:41:59.581
I don't know.

01:41:59.821 --> 01:42:06.186
I'm just saying That's my my sense and to be I mean

01:42:07.981 --> 01:42:08.281
I don't know.

01:42:08.301 --> 01:42:08.582
I don't know.

01:42:08.602 --> 01:42:09.242
We want to get into this.

01:42:09.262 --> 01:42:21.734
But like my the reason the reason a big reason I think that is because I have some mostly unreleased work on on COVID.

01:42:22.374 --> 01:42:29.321
And it took my my belief on COVID.

01:42:31.222 --> 01:42:32.424
Now, and it I

01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:53.562
I feel extremely confident saying this is that there was no pandemic at all there never was a virus like going around and getting people sick and There was so the same way that I was talking about earlier a a

01:42:57.279 --> 01:43:01.101
you know, like different sides to a psyop.

01:43:01.562 --> 01:43:03.783
There's the the natural origin side.

01:43:04.163 --> 01:43:05.744
And then there's the lab leak side.

01:43:06.104 --> 01:43:12.828
And as long and those both are on the assumption that there was a pandemic.

01:43:13.028 --> 01:43:15.189
It's just did it come from nature or a lab?

01:43:15.249 --> 01:43:17.551
Or was it a bioweapon or an accident or whatever?

01:43:19.592 --> 01:43:31.257
that's one of the main COVID psyops, and it assumes that it's even possible for a virus to travel around the world and not mutate.

01:43:32.157 --> 01:43:40.821
And so one of the things I did that I was doing until October 7th, when I got pushed into that, is

01:43:43.292 --> 01:43:52.336
I was documenting how the COVID origin debate unfolded since, you know, January 2020, even.

01:43:54.627 --> 01:44:20.587
And it became so clear to me like Painfully clear like I was like I was beating myself, you know with like over-the-head clear That the whole thing was totally crafted by intelligence agencies and cutouts and the whole narrative and I and it actually when I I got to a point where I was like, I'm about 99

01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:28.955
0.5% sure based on examining the propaganda that there was no pandemic.

01:44:29.836 --> 01:44:36.342
But like, I can't evaluate from a scientific scientific perspective, I'm starting to suspect that like, maybe it's not even possible.

01:44:36.822 --> 01:44:41.807
You know, maybe it's not just that there was no pandemic that, you know, this time, but the whole thing is just science fiction.

01:44:43.529 --> 01:44:48.355
And I got in touch with this guy named J.J.

01:44:48.435 --> 01:44:52.119
Cooey, who is one of the most really remarkable

01:44:54.346 --> 01:45:19.248
thinkers that I know he's he's a he was an academic biologist who got fired from the University of Pittsburgh where he was teaching he's in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh now and he has a channel called giga ohm biological and he's not very active on social media and like he's mostly like just kind of he just kind of mostly comments on on He doesn't do a lot on like X. He's very active on his channel does long streams and like I reached out to him and

01:45:20.862 --> 01:45:31.509
I was recommended to talk to him and he explained from a biology perspective a scientific perspective why I was right that yes, my suspicion was correct and

01:45:32.444 --> 01:45:35.286
He was actually RFK Jr.'

01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:36.627
's top advisor.

01:45:37.868 --> 01:45:42.391
One of his top advisor, I don't know, he's listed in RFK Jr.'

01:45:42.351 --> 01:45:52.238
's book, the Wuhan cover up, as he's the first name under the acknowledgement without whom this book would not have been possible.

01:45:52.919 --> 01:45:53.059
So

01:45:54.522 --> 01:45:56.704
I like the fact that he's being very accurate.

01:45:56.864 --> 01:46:02.128
At first he said I was his chief or head advisor, and then he said, well, he doesn't know about that, but he's listed first in the book.

01:46:02.868 --> 01:46:05.850
I like the fact that he said gigaohm biological out loud.

01:46:06.811 --> 01:46:14.697
I like the fact that he isn't afraid to say what he learned from me.

01:46:14.777 --> 01:46:15.738
I like this a lot.

01:46:16.238 --> 01:46:17.639
This was already a couple of weeks ago.

01:46:19.045 --> 01:46:23.489
I don't know why I didn't show it other than so many other things were happening behind the scenes.

01:46:23.969 --> 01:46:26.251
But this made me very happy.

01:46:26.831 --> 01:46:31.915
The article that he wrote with Housatonic about Li Min Yan made me very happy.

01:46:31.955 --> 01:46:34.097
And I think there will be more to come.

01:46:34.817 --> 01:46:35.038
I do.

01:46:35.118 --> 01:46:46.967
And when he basically came to RFK in the middle of research and was like, I realized, he realized that a pandemic is not a real thing.

01:46:47.998 --> 01:46:51.459
RFK basically fired him showed him politely showed him the door.

01:46:53.740 --> 01:47:04.023
And so there's so my so I firmly believe and I'm looking forward to the day when I can get this piece out, but there was no pandemic.

01:47:04.383 --> 01:47:07.304
And so that model that I saw of how

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.382
the pandemic narrative unfolded, and there's kind of different sides to it.

01:47:13.943 --> 01:47:33.131
And it was a cover for something much more insidious, all of the measures, everything that was implemented, under the guise of a pandemic, I recognize that same, or a very similar pattern with the Epstein story, that I feel like we're being like, it's too on the nose, and we're just being like, led around with it.

01:47:34.366 --> 01:47:35.147
Damn it, Dan.

01:47:35.647 --> 01:47:38.970
I wish you didn't open that up with only like five minutes to go.

01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:41.792
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.

01:47:42.392 --> 01:47:45.054
Please don't forget that this is for all the marbles.

01:47:45.074 --> 01:47:46.495
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:47:46.535 --> 01:47:51.079
That's why we are fighting with this fake movement of populist movement that's actually not real.

01:47:51.699 --> 01:47:52.519
There is no right.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.700
There is no left.

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.381
There's only social media confusion.

01:47:57.301 --> 01:48:00.702
Don't think that you can't step out of the hamster wheel, though.

01:48:00.782 --> 01:48:03.583
You are trapped in the wheel only because you scroll.

01:48:04.124 --> 01:48:05.944
It doesn't matter which wheel you're trapped in.

01:48:05.984 --> 01:48:09.886
It doesn't matter which stage you've been listening to at the Lollapalooza of liars.

01:48:10.386 --> 01:48:18.069
All you need to do is realize that that armband is the problem, and you need to find the exit and leave.

01:48:18.729 --> 01:48:26.634
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:48:27.114 --> 01:48:32.198
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal because it's an old technology they're renaming.

01:48:32.838 --> 01:48:35.520
RNA cannot pandemic because it can't.

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:42.204
It has none of the chemical attributes that DNA has, and even DNA doesn't prove evolution.

01:48:42.664 --> 01:48:43.545
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:48:44.205 --> 01:48:46.326
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:48:46.346 --> 01:48:47.146
Thanks for being here.

01:48:47.986 --> 01:48:49.587
I hope to see you guys again soon.

01:48:49.627 --> 01:48:53.348
It is Friday, but you never know with the weekend.

01:48:53.388 --> 01:48:57.109
We might be doing weekend shows now, depending on just how it works with the family.

01:48:57.629 --> 01:49:03.751
I'm trying to figure out a way to get on here as much as possible as we transition to the regular teaching.

01:49:03.811 --> 01:49:07.052
But again, I'm not going to start teaching until I have the first course done.

01:49:07.973 --> 01:49:09.093
So it might be a little while yet.

01:49:09.113 --> 01:49:10.193
You're going to have to be patient.

01:49:10.634 --> 01:49:11.374
So in the meantime,

01:49:12.597 --> 01:49:20.630
Download the PeerTube app, get troubleshooting it, and see if you can get Gigaohm on your phone and get Housatonic.

01:49:21.552 --> 01:49:23.515
And get Housatonic live on your phone.

01:49:23.535 --> 01:49:24.597
Thanks very much for being here.

01:49:24.637 --> 01:49:25.398
See you again soon.

01:50:34.399 --> 01:50:35.919
I will see you guys again tomorrow.

01:50:35.939 --> 01:50:37.100
I'm going to hit the hardwood now.

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.281
We're going to start filming pretty soon.

01:50:39.321 --> 01:50:41.043
I think you're going to be very excited.

01:50:41.083 --> 01:50:42.203
I've made a lot of progress.

01:50:42.243 --> 01:50:43.764
I'm almost back in shape again.

01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:44.745
See you guys again soon.
