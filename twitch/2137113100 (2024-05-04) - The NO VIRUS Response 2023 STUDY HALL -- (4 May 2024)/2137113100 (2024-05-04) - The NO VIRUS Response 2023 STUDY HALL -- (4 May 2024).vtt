00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.400 --> 00:34.400
Peer tube is really not working, but you can hear me

00:35.680 --> 00:37.680
Can you hear me at all?

00:38.400 --> 00:46.560
Because peer tube is not working and I don't know I'm having all kinds of problems if you can hear me I'm gonna go

00:50.800 --> 00:56.760
Yeah, I don't I'm not on camera yet. That's fine. All right. I'm going gee whiz. That's annoying

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I

01:22.280 --> 01:28.360
Mean everything's going wrong this morning. I don't know why I couldn't I couldn't even get it online. I couldn't get

01:29.120 --> 01:35.080
Peer tube wouldn't start twitch wouldn't start here to didn't start so that's

01:35.800 --> 01:42.520
That's kind of annoying. I think it's because I hit peer tube so many times. It's got these little videos. It's trying to

01:43.600 --> 01:45.760
Transcode or some nonsense because it's not

01:48.680 --> 01:53.400
It wasn't happy with that multiple start at the beginning so I apologize I'm really

01:54.400 --> 01:57.200
I'm just trying to be here every day in the morning and

01:59.320 --> 02:03.760
And yeah, it's Saturday and 10 10 came up on me very quick

02:04.840 --> 02:11.560
My wife teaches in the morning and so I have the kids all morning and so 10 10 came on very fast

02:12.200 --> 02:14.200
And I apologize

02:15.560 --> 02:20.720
So we're here again. We're going forward. We got a little more study hall to do

02:23.040 --> 02:25.040
Thanks for joining me

02:28.360 --> 02:30.360
I

02:58.360 --> 03:01.360
I'm afraid

03:28.360 --> 03:45.400
I like that analogy, the Ghostbusters Chaos energy, I like that a lot.

03:45.400 --> 03:52.440
Did you see that Bobby Malone was on, Bobby Malone was on Alex Jones a couple days ago

03:52.440 --> 04:02.360
so we really jumped the shark for sure nowadays, called Alex Jones a hero, a guy who can see

04:02.360 --> 04:11.480
around corners, ha ha. Oh boy, I don't know what to say about that.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.520
I think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more

04:16.520 --> 04:21.800
in society. We want everybody to feel good. That's not, that's not the way life is.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.880
What video is unavailable? You can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in

04:27.880 --> 04:33.880
people. And then I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again, I don't want to lie, you know, I don't

04:33.880 --> 04:38.040
think I'm a liar, I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like

04:38.040 --> 04:42.760
really important. I'm only streaming on Twitch right now in case you're trying to find me

04:42.760 --> 04:48.760
somewhere else. Everything else crashed down. I got to do some, I got to do some IT

04:48.760 --> 04:54.440
juggling in the background to figure out what's wrong with my screen keys or whatever is going on.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.280
So I apologize for that. I'm not sure exactly who he is. His name is J.J. Cooey and I believe he's

05:02.280 --> 05:11.480
a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I

05:11.480 --> 05:17.080
understand. You're still there, Christie, and can tell me what video you're talking about.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.720
I hope it's not on Twitch. I hope Twitch is at least solid if anybody else can confirm that

05:21.720 --> 05:27.720
one more time. That would be wonderful. Thank you very much for being here. Hello, Pamela.

05:29.560 --> 05:37.800
Hello, everyone.

05:41.480 --> 06:10.600
I'm afraid you're right. I'm afraid info wars has finally transitioned to being part of the

06:10.600 --> 06:17.800
CNN in this new world. Just like they're trying to transition Brett Weinstein and Joe Rogan into

06:17.800 --> 06:23.720
being more what we would be considered mainstream sources of information. But of course,

06:23.720 --> 06:32.520
they're no better than any other pre-purchased performer. And once you realize that we're talking

06:32.520 --> 06:37.240
about weaponized piles of money behind these people, you start to get the feeling that there's

06:37.320 --> 06:42.760
just a team that we haven't been aware of you can play for. And if you were offered a spot on

06:42.760 --> 06:48.680
that team, you might take it too. That's really, you know, four years ago, it might have been

06:48.680 --> 06:55.960
different than now, too. And you can't back out of that team. And because your consciousness is the

06:55.960 --> 07:04.120
prime real estate that they are all competing for, yeah, you've got to be well aware of the fact

07:04.120 --> 07:16.040
that they are happy. Mike Vandenberg, next day, they are happy, happy to have us attribute bad

07:16.040 --> 07:21.640
motives to the people that we disagree with, because the people that we disagree with are taking

07:21.640 --> 07:29.480
positions that they themselves have curated, that they themselves have set up as straw men that we

07:29.480 --> 07:35.320
feel compelled to defend, because there's an illusion of consensus on TV and social media

07:35.320 --> 07:41.000
that these are the relevant topics and the relevant questions to ask. And that people who don't want

07:41.000 --> 07:45.480
to ask these questions just have bad motives. That's why they don't want to answer to these

07:45.480 --> 07:52.280
questions. And that is why they don't want you talking about how fractional reserve banking works.

07:52.280 --> 07:57.000
That's why they don't teach you in high school. They never taught us in high school where a

07:57.000 --> 08:06.280
mortgage comes from. And there are just some people also, unfortunately, who are never going

08:06.280 --> 08:14.040
to see even when they are shown. And that part of the debate may be what what Matthias Desmond's

08:14.040 --> 08:19.800
Desmond is talking about with regard to mass psychosis, the people who can't see and will never see.

08:20.120 --> 08:30.040
But for me, it's very clear that in history, they only have one chance to pull off the heist,

08:30.920 --> 08:35.000
one chance to collect the data, and they've been talking about it for a while. They've been

08:35.000 --> 08:42.920
doing presentations for each other in private meetings about how there's an opportunity here

08:43.000 --> 08:49.880
that in addition to, you know, the smart thing of reducing population on earth to a more sustainable

08:49.880 --> 08:56.520
level so that we can all be rich and we can all have all the amenities of modern life.

08:57.800 --> 09:04.200
It would be wise to reduce population, but let's not ignore the opportunity here that 10 billion

09:04.200 --> 09:08.200
people on the planet, if we have our way, will never exist again. And so we better dang well,

09:08.760 --> 09:15.240
collect that data now. And I think you can find evidence for this impetus in this motivation

09:15.240 --> 09:19.800
in history. And I think one of the best people to follow with regard to just, you know,

09:21.240 --> 09:26.840
looking at this history from different angles and through different from different perspectives

09:26.840 --> 09:33.480
from the perspective of the people involved in it. I think Mark Huzatonic is Mark. Huzatonic ITS,

09:33.480 --> 09:39.000
Mark Kulak is actually a really great person to follow. He's one of those people fighting to

09:39.000 --> 09:47.960
take the power back from these charlatans right here. Pamela in the chat has been trying to take

09:47.960 --> 09:52.680
back the power from these charlatans for a long time has been trying to make gentle the life of

09:52.680 --> 10:03.240
this world for a long time. And I feel quite honored actually to have her in my corner. I've never met

10:04.120 --> 10:12.200
her, but I've put a PI on her once. And I know that she's not a liar. And I don't like liars,

10:12.200 --> 10:17.320
ladies and gentlemen. I think the reason why we have had so much trouble surfing this wave is

10:17.320 --> 10:23.800
because of the tremendous number of liars. And once we've we've found the truth now, we have to

10:23.800 --> 10:29.400
pass it on to other humanoids. We have to pass it on to our children, to our neighbors, to our

10:29.400 --> 10:36.760
friends, to the teachers union, to the to the coffee, the coffee break people. I don't know what

10:36.760 --> 10:41.720
I was going to say there, but we've got to start passing this truth on so that more people can

10:41.720 --> 10:48.680
surf their way out of this. And yeah, if you've been here for a while, you know exactly what I'm

10:48.680 --> 10:52.840
talking about when I say we have to stay focused on biology. We don't want to take the bait on

10:52.840 --> 10:56.440
TV and social media and we need to love our neighbors before we're going to get out of this.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.960
Thank you very much for sharing the word. Thank you very much for supporting the work. That's

11:01.960 --> 11:07.640
how this works. We need more and more people to learn this biology and wake the up.

11:18.600 --> 11:23.160
Yes, we need to wake up, ladies and gentlemen, we need to wake up and we need to we need to

11:23.240 --> 11:28.200
identify the people who have been lying to us for a while. And you can some people are not

11:28.200 --> 11:32.600
comfortable with the word lie. But then what do you want me to say that there's classified

11:32.600 --> 11:37.560
information that they've not told us in order that that that they could govern us and that some of

11:37.560 --> 11:43.400
that classified information when they don't tell it to us is the is effectively a lie. If they know

11:43.400 --> 11:51.720
things about like, for example, that gain a function virology and RNA viruses is a myth and they're

11:52.280 --> 11:57.720
but it's a classified myth, then they have to lie about it. Don't you understand? Even if you

11:57.720 --> 12:02.760
don't want to think about that as a lie, that's how you are participating in this. You're keeping

12:02.760 --> 12:09.480
your hand over your eyes and ignoring the fact that we are governed by lies and by liars.

12:10.440 --> 12:15.080
That's just that's just the way it is. It's always been that way. They don't always tell us the truth.

12:15.080 --> 12:22.040
Now the question becomes, what if they've been lying to us about our biology? What if they've

12:22.040 --> 12:28.120
been lying to us about public health? What if they have been lying to us about all the threats that

12:28.120 --> 12:35.240
exist out there in the world, especially with regard to biological threats in order to be able

12:35.240 --> 12:40.920
to govern us by a mythology that we have absolutely no control over. Ladies and gentlemen, may the

12:40.920 --> 12:47.400
fourth be with you. This is one of those days when people make lots of jokes about Star Wars,

12:47.400 --> 12:56.840
and so I thought I would too. Again, good morning. This is Giga Ohm Biological.

13:11.800 --> 13:24.200
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is May the fourth 2024. This is Giga Ohm Biological,

13:24.200 --> 13:28.440
a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist. I'm coming to you

13:28.440 --> 13:35.720
live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's Saturday. It's 1058. It's almost 11 in the morning. My two

13:35.720 --> 13:40.840
boys have just gone to the gym with their mom and they're going to do another hour of ball handling

13:40.920 --> 13:49.800
drills and shooting. And this week, actually my boys, both at one day apart, managed to hit the

13:49.800 --> 13:57.800
milestone at this gym faster than anyone has ever hit it before. They made 10,000 shots. They both

13:57.800 --> 14:06.280
taken over 16,000 shots in the last two months over March and April, and they crossed the threshold

14:06.280 --> 14:14.840
of making 10,000 shots on the machine, which kind of blows my mind. But when I play King of the

14:14.840 --> 14:22.920
Court with them now, and if I don't cheat and block their shot because I'm a giant and let them shoot

14:22.920 --> 14:30.440
over my head, I can I can meet some pretty decent competition in my little boy has quite the step.

14:30.440 --> 14:37.640
And so if he gets my legs twisted up, the kid can get a layup. And he was not able to do that

14:37.640 --> 14:45.000
last year. So what I'm really excited to share that personal thing is that I really, I think one

14:45.000 --> 14:51.080
of the best things that we can we can impart on our children is the lesson that, you know,

14:51.080 --> 14:57.080
the time that you put in and how hard you try at anything over time will pay off. And it's very

14:57.080 --> 15:03.960
hard nowadays to get children to engage in something long enough so that they can see that

15:03.960 --> 15:12.360
engaging in it is producing results. And on the flip side of that, there are there are things

15:12.360 --> 15:17.240
that my kids do that are not growing well enough so that they're starting to lose interest in it.

15:17.240 --> 15:22.520
One of the best examples is my 12 year old plays trombone. And at first, he didn't want to do

15:22.520 --> 15:28.280
an instrument and then he played trombone a few months and he realized, wow, this is a really

15:28.280 --> 15:33.560
powerful instrument and it's it's freaking fun. And then he got good at it and then they had a

15:33.560 --> 15:40.920
concert and now the challenge of it is not increasing. The music isn't getting that much harder because

15:40.920 --> 15:45.560
there's it's still a pretty big band and he's still pretty young. And so he's starting to think

15:45.560 --> 15:50.760
like maybe I don't want to do it anymore because you know, I don't really have to have to try very

15:50.760 --> 15:55.400
hard and I don't really like, you know, being the best trombone player among people that

15:55.400 --> 16:00.520
don't really like to play either. And if my friend wouldn't acquit last year, you know, that whole

16:00.520 --> 16:06.200
thing. And I was just really worried for him, especially because the other one had played football

16:06.200 --> 16:12.200
and played basketball and played soccer one time or another, you know. And so I just was worried

16:12.200 --> 16:17.080
that the kid wouldn't find something where this where he would learn this lesson that, you know,

16:17.560 --> 16:24.360
how much you can get out of daily dedication to a skill, daily dedication to exercise is also

16:24.360 --> 16:30.440
there. But daily dedication to skill is something so so amazing. I mean, the only reason why I can't

16:30.440 --> 16:33.960
do more on the panel that's in front of me is because it's a half size keyboard and I have

16:33.960 --> 16:40.920
giant hands. So learning to play jump on the on the keyboard I had it said the wrong thing.

16:41.880 --> 16:46.440
Down here is really hard to panel upstairs of the keyboard that my daughter has upstairs is much

16:46.520 --> 16:53.640
easier because it's bigger. But the skills that I learned, you know, those are from years and years

16:53.640 --> 16:59.640
ago, and they're still there because for a little while I practiced piano pretty seriously, I thought

16:59.640 --> 17:04.200
it was pretty cool. And I learned to play Star Wars on it and a bunch of other stuff that motivated

17:04.200 --> 17:09.480
me. And then at some point I went on to the saxophone and other things, but music's always been a thing.

17:09.480 --> 17:15.480
And I just wanted my kids to find something and then they found basketball. And I thought we would

17:15.480 --> 17:21.960
go like three times a week and I'm I I crap you not. We have only missed two days the Saturday and

17:21.960 --> 17:28.440
the Sunday of Easter Sunday. That's it. That weekend we took two days off because they went to stay

17:28.440 --> 17:34.360
overnight at somebody's house or whatever. And other than that they've also had me in the gym

17:34.360 --> 17:39.560
shooting and moving around every day which has been extraordinary because I'm spending

17:40.520 --> 17:45.320
almost two hours a day with my sons that I wasn't spending with them before doing something that I

17:45.400 --> 17:50.360
myself wanted to do, but never really wanted to be so selfish as to force on them. And now they're

17:51.080 --> 17:56.440
pretty obsessed with it. And so maybe the the first kind of hopeful message,

17:57.800 --> 18:02.040
at least from my own perspective, is that I can honestly say that

18:03.720 --> 18:10.520
the change in my life from dedicating so much time and energy to trying to perform

18:11.400 --> 18:17.480
well as a professor in a university setting and get a grant or get the data that I didn't get

18:17.480 --> 18:26.440
yesterday or submit that you know whatever has been amazing. And you know after four years of

18:26.440 --> 18:33.480
trying to figure out how to get my head on straight, really the best thing about the pandemic for me

18:33.480 --> 18:38.360
and maybe the best thing about the pandemic for you that you haven't reflected on is that it has

18:39.320 --> 18:45.640
made you realize what really is important, who really is important. And perhaps some of you have

18:45.640 --> 18:50.360
been lucky enough to reorient your lives in such a way so that some of those things that should have

18:50.360 --> 18:57.000
had more time and priority now do. And so if you can look at it that way, try to think about okay

18:57.000 --> 19:02.280
well how can I make this even better? How can I how can I even double down on this before? And

19:02.280 --> 19:08.040
I'm kind of circling back to a talk that I did. I've done a few times a little secret talk

19:08.760 --> 19:14.360
that I've sometimes inserted at the end of shows. I don't know what the next slide is. Let me just

19:14.360 --> 19:20.280
make sure I know what I'm expecting here because I'm improvising right now. This is not what I plan

19:20.280 --> 19:26.760
to talk about. Oh yeah, I'll just start with that first. Intramuscular injection of any

19:26.760 --> 19:30.360
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

19:30.360 --> 19:36.360
transfection. Healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic. If you ever need me to

19:36.360 --> 19:45.800
do a zoom presentation, a 30,000 foot level survey course with some citations, maybe some

19:45.800 --> 19:52.040
basic hints on where to start reading and some cartoons. And you want me to do it for your

19:52.040 --> 19:58.840
teachers union or for your family group or or whatever. Please just send me an email

20:00.440 --> 20:05.480
and and and we'll work something out because I think this main message needs to be challenged.

20:05.480 --> 20:11.160
I want somebody to take me to task on it. I want somebody to tell me why I shouldn't be saying

20:11.160 --> 20:18.520
these words so that I can correct them because I do think if this is not as sharp as the knife

20:18.520 --> 20:23.800
can get, then I want it to become sharper. And so that's first and foremost the message. The next

20:23.800 --> 20:32.680
message that I wanted to send out was one that comes from the patch clamp perspective. So yesterday

20:32.760 --> 20:38.200
I kind of got off on a tangent about the work that I did with regard to small conductance

20:38.200 --> 20:45.640
calcium activated potassium channels, SK channels, and all the work that I did with inside outside

20:45.640 --> 20:51.960
inside out and outside out patches, and how the conductance of these channels has been

20:51.960 --> 21:02.760
studied in so many and vitro preparations that to doubt them is is is silly to to say that they

21:02.760 --> 21:08.680
are the sum total of what we are, of course, would also be silly. But it would be like saying that we

21:10.680 --> 21:15.320
we understand how a light bulb works, but we don't understand how the whole power grid works,

21:15.320 --> 21:19.000
and then having somebody say you don't know anything about light bulbs. Well, yeah, I do.

21:19.080 --> 21:23.640
I don't know how the power is generated and how it's distributed to my house and everybody

21:23.640 --> 21:30.600
else's house with no interruption, but I can tell you how a light bulb works. And in this case,

21:30.600 --> 21:35.160
I think we can say how ion channels work. At least we have a good idea. We might be wrong

21:35.160 --> 21:40.120
about some of the very subtle details of the how the physics sorts out at the gating mechanism

21:40.120 --> 21:47.080
or something like that. But we we we have a pretty good idea. We've tested those very, very rigorously

21:47.720 --> 21:53.960
relative to, for example, how the psychopathic effect in in a zero six cell culture has been

21:53.960 --> 22:01.560
rigorously tested to see that the cartoon version of it somewhat reflects the the nature of reality,

22:01.560 --> 22:07.240
and that that's not they've not they've not tested that at all. Since the 40s or the 50s,

22:07.240 --> 22:14.200
when this became kind of the norm or the standard, if you will, that standard has never been challenged

22:14.200 --> 22:20.680
or tried to be increased in fidelity, they're still using plaque assays as the primary way to

22:20.680 --> 22:26.200
sort this stuff out, even though we are supposedly have nanopore sequencing. And this guy from Harvard

22:26.200 --> 22:33.320
was sharing some kind of nanoparticle reading chips with the with the Chinese back before the

22:33.320 --> 22:39.560
the pandemic started for $55,000 a year, but we still have to do plaque essays to understand

22:39.560 --> 22:49.000
what's going on in a viral culture. I mean, that's just crazy. And so the good message that I wanted

22:49.000 --> 22:56.200
to bring is that I woke up the other day and realized that I had a revelation in the Netherlands

22:56.840 --> 23:03.880
that I still hadn't applied to my life here. And that reality that that revelation was in the

23:03.880 --> 23:13.560
Netherlands that I had was that I had been I had been obsessed with optimizing my experimental

23:13.560 --> 23:19.800
protocol and my procedure in terms of getting through the day how I spent my time so that I

23:19.800 --> 23:27.400
could get home on time so that I could get work done at the lab, not short change the mouse because

23:27.400 --> 23:35.320
if you kill a mouse and you could you could record let's just say you could record 20 hours

23:35.320 --> 23:39.560
and you don't that's pretty late now you can't record 20 hours but you can record eight

23:40.920 --> 23:47.160
if it's good. And so you want to kind of set yourself up so that if you have it and you you're

23:47.160 --> 23:53.320
getting great data and all the tissue is healthy and the recordings are stable and you know there's

23:53.400 --> 23:58.360
no wind and the you know whatever voodoo happens in these things because it is voodoo when you're

23:58.360 --> 24:03.800
making a stack of cards every day. That's what really hard experiments are. The mouse has to

24:03.800 --> 24:11.240
cooperate. You can't run out of carbogen too early. You know the ice should be the right you know

24:12.280 --> 24:17.640
whatever the you have to make sure you tighten the razor right and if the razor's loose you might

24:17.640 --> 24:25.720
have a bad slice. There's lots of random things that could happen in the course of the three-hour

24:25.720 --> 24:32.360
preparation before you start this potentially eight hours of recording that the more optimized

24:32.360 --> 24:38.840
the preparation was the more likely you were to get to the best place possible to start experiments

24:38.840 --> 24:46.280
with the most consistent outcome. And what I've been explaining to my boys with regard to basketball

24:46.280 --> 24:55.720
is it's pretty hard to play a sport or an athletic thing half speed. You either kind of have to

24:55.720 --> 25:04.520
try and replicate 95 or 90 percent as hard as you can and and try to hit that repeatedly because

25:04.520 --> 25:08.840
that you can kind of reach because you know what it's like when you're trying as hard as you can.

25:09.480 --> 25:16.760
But it's pretty hard to do it half speed or with half jump or with half follow through

25:16.760 --> 25:21.880
in order to practice or relax. You're much better off going full speed and then resting

25:21.880 --> 25:26.840
than you are trying to go half speed for a whole game and in fact that's a terrible habit to get

25:26.840 --> 25:32.840
into because then you're practicing somewhere between 40 and 60 percent instead of practicing

25:32.840 --> 25:39.560
at 95 percent all the time. And so with regard to science there are a lot of scientists who think

25:39.560 --> 25:45.240
that well that the slices are okay today so I'll do the recordings and then they create this

25:46.200 --> 25:54.360
this data set which is essentially contaminated with imperfect experimental settings that weren't

25:54.360 --> 25:59.720
so rigorously controlled that you got to the same place at the starting point every time.

25:59.800 --> 26:07.000
And if you're not hyper anal about that if you're not sensitive to exactly what it is that indicates

26:07.000 --> 26:14.280
that you're at that acceptably perfect starting point then you're also open to the possibility

26:14.280 --> 26:20.840
that your whole data set will have this noise in it that's created by your inability to keep

26:20.840 --> 26:26.120
your experimental starting point at the same place. And so this is one of the most beautiful

26:26.120 --> 26:34.440
reasons why infectious clones for RNA viruses are so important because there would be no other way

26:35.320 --> 26:41.800
for any of these experiments to start in the same place. My experiments would start in the same

26:41.800 --> 26:47.320
place because I would start with the same mouse line which are genetically inbred so identical

26:47.320 --> 26:53.160
to one another. I would start with them in the same age week so I would never use an animal that

26:53.160 --> 27:00.840
was older than 36 days or younger than 27 so I was technically adult but young enough so that I

27:00.840 --> 27:05.640
could still make my prep and most of the time I tried to keep that window even lower and I

27:05.640 --> 27:09.800
definitely kept track of that window so that I could analyze whether there was a difference

27:09.800 --> 27:20.280
between the ages. And so the amount of cognitive energy that you would need I would need to spend

27:20.280 --> 27:26.040
every day just to keep this this dance in order so that I showed up and I didn't get

27:26.040 --> 27:30.600
so distracted by email and I didn't get distracted by a student and I knew where I needed to be at

27:30.600 --> 27:38.760
11 o'clock so that at 12.15 I was done eating and I could I could start on the rig. And all this

27:38.760 --> 27:47.160
energy I spent optimizing my day at work I never spent a dime of my brain trying to optimize my

27:47.160 --> 27:56.200
Saturday. I've never I never spent a dime trying to optimize my Sunday and why? Because I didn't

27:56.200 --> 28:01.320
have a motivation to optimize it. What was my motivation? I was done with work. All I wanted was

28:01.320 --> 28:11.240
Saturday. All I wanted was Sunday for me and to be free. But a strategy that comes from a patch

28:11.240 --> 28:16.280
clamber where you're trying to optimize your day at work can be applied to optimizing your

28:16.280 --> 28:21.560
Saturday and optimizing your Sunday so that you hit all the marks and there's absolutely

28:21.560 --> 28:28.280
nothing wrong. In fact there is a good way that's a good way to keep the news and social media

28:28.840 --> 28:34.760
and all of this distraction machinery from actually taking hold of your brain having a plan

28:34.760 --> 28:41.800
and optimizing it or every day not in a in a in a in a in a robotic way but in just kind of like

28:41.800 --> 28:46.120
how'd that go today? Did I did I manage to check that box and today I want to just

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
shout out to the fact that my sons and their dedication to basketball has reminded me again

28:53.000 --> 28:57.160
that there is an optimizing to be done which is actually happening right now when we're starting

28:57.160 --> 29:02.440
at 10 10 and trying to come on every day and trying to do the studying in the afternoon so that I

29:02.440 --> 29:06.760
can think about it after dinner and be ready to do what I want to do in the morning without

29:06.760 --> 29:14.280
hesitating about which one I should pick and so it's it's it's really a wonderful thing to think

29:14.280 --> 29:21.720
about the pandemic shake up which is going to be and and remains in the future inevitable you

29:21.720 --> 29:25.720
know they're going to do it you know that that Ghostbusters energy that we were talking about

29:25.720 --> 29:30.680
the beginning is not it's not something we're imagining so we know that the ground is going

29:30.760 --> 29:38.200
to become unstable and so I think we should plan to take advantage of it you know if you know

29:38.920 --> 29:44.200
that there's going to be a flood and you can buy a little robo right now or or something like that

29:44.200 --> 29:48.440
then why wouldn't you and if you know that there's going to be a little bit of a shake up right

29:48.440 --> 29:54.360
now let's start to think about trying to identify what it is that when that shake up happens or when

29:54.440 --> 30:02.120
we start to feel it ourselves that those priorities we already know what they are and and the things

30:02.120 --> 30:06.520
that we want to optimize our activity around we already know what they are maybe we're already busy

30:06.520 --> 30:16.440
with it and so for me um I am really focused constantly on trying to optimize my contribution

30:16.440 --> 30:25.240
to my family and to my marriage um with the absolute drive that I have to be here every day

30:25.240 --> 30:29.480
and I think it's it's starting to work I think it's really starting to work and so I'm really

30:29.480 --> 30:35.720
excited about it and I think there's something there for everybody I don't know really how else

30:35.720 --> 30:41.400
to say it but I used to optimize my day at work every day and obsessed about it 24-7 and

30:42.120 --> 30:47.400
I think I want to try to encourage everybody to try and optimize their own day but in a way

30:47.400 --> 30:54.520
that's oriented around you and your family and those priorities not around work even though work

30:54.520 --> 30:59.720
obviously at one point in time in this in this universe it was okay for work to be something

30:59.720 --> 31:04.920
that took that priority I think for a lot of us if not for almost all of us now work is really a

31:04.920 --> 31:10.760
means to an end to nothing more and that's part of the scary part of the future coming forward

31:10.760 --> 31:15.400
those of us who are still blessed to feel like we're doing what we're supposed to be doing which

31:15.960 --> 31:23.240
you know I humbly say it's me um I definitely feel like I'm doing what I'm doing and I'm blessed

31:23.240 --> 31:28.760
to be able to do it um but it's because I have the wife I have because I have the kids I have

31:28.760 --> 31:33.800
because I've had the neighbors I have and the friends I have it's not the family unfortunately

31:33.800 --> 31:39.240
for me like some of us you know the family was was fractured on this idea

31:40.360 --> 31:46.360
um and so I've got a lot to fight for too I actually found out that my parents are

31:46.360 --> 31:49.960
thinking about coming to visit in Pittsburgh in two weeks so that could be an interesting

31:51.080 --> 31:57.000
interesting wrench in the works we'll see if we can we can figure out some amends there

31:57.400 --> 32:03.880
um I already said this again if you need any help or you want me to try and explain this

32:03.880 --> 32:08.120
every once in a while I'm going to do a a show about these three things it's been a while since

32:08.120 --> 32:15.960
I've done that but I haven't I won't do it right now um today I want to again take this video or

32:15.960 --> 32:21.080
take this time to watch this video that was made sometime last year that was supposed to respond

32:21.800 --> 32:29.400
to my email um which I was asked to write to Christine Massey and Tom Cowan and

32:30.200 --> 32:37.080
Handy Kaufman and I don't know who else was on the email but Mary Holland of Children's Health

32:37.080 --> 32:43.560
Defense that I think at the time may have still been working with the Kennedy campaign um because

32:43.560 --> 32:49.160
she came back from the Kennedy campaign a month after I started working at CHD and before that

32:49.640 --> 32:58.280
she was actually you know some kind of pretty pretty significant player in in RFK's campaign

32:58.280 --> 33:09.480
and then she came back to CHD a month after I started um and anyway um Mary Holland before I

33:09.480 --> 33:15.240
started at CHD while I was still working for as a consultant for the Wuhan cover-up book

33:16.120 --> 33:21.480
um she asked me to write a letter uh an email on behalf and try to explain to them

33:22.520 --> 33:29.160
why no virus wasn't a very good position and I I wrote an email which I guess I could try to

33:29.160 --> 33:33.560
find right now I think I tried to find it once and I had some kind of problem finding it it's

33:33.560 --> 33:38.280
not that I don't have it it's that I don't have access to all the email I used to since they

33:38.280 --> 33:44.920
fired me um or laid me off or ended my position whenever they called it um I want to look for

33:47.800 --> 33:51.800
that one maybe no

34:02.200 --> 34:03.320
oh yeah here maybe this one

34:03.880 --> 34:07.640
yes this is the one so uh

34:15.320 --> 34:16.680
I said um

34:24.680 --> 34:29.480
so this I just read this one to you maybe I'll put it up on the screen too am I out of focus again

34:29.480 --> 34:37.960
gee whiz awesome fan uh I just I don't want to get maybe I can copy this

34:39.560 --> 34:45.000
I'm going to copy this text and then I'm going to put it in a slide here so so you can see it I

34:45.000 --> 34:52.840
don't want to put the email up because there's all kinds of pictures in it and um and stuff so I

34:52.840 --> 34:56.440
let me just I can do this quick

35:06.920 --> 35:18.600
okay so I I wrote this on request of Mary Holland as an email to the um people who I don't

35:18.680 --> 35:23.240
sorry I don't have this set up I didn't think I was going to do this again I'm I improvise a

35:23.240 --> 35:28.360
lot you just might not know that um but I do um here we go

35:31.880 --> 35:36.920
so this was the email text that I wrote when Mary Holland asked me to write a response to Christine

35:36.920 --> 35:44.040
Massey and these others who were trying to get them to to admit or CHD to get them to admit that

35:44.120 --> 35:50.520
there's no virus and why does CHD keep saying there's a virus when there's no virus okay so

35:50.520 --> 35:58.040
when I wrote this I was still not where I am now I was still not where I am now that's about

35:58.040 --> 36:02.520
the best I can say so just I'll read this and then you can you can you can hear it so

36:02.520 --> 36:06.760
there's no question that the coronavirus biology and virology in general are amongst the most

36:06.760 --> 36:11.880
tenuous fields in biology in a world where viruses exist but everyone involved has both

36:11.880 --> 36:16.280
exaggerated their ability to identify and study viruses and underplay the danger

36:16.280 --> 36:20.680
of synthetic infectious RNA clones the most important thing is to move slowly

36:20.680 --> 36:25.560
it is in virologist's best interest that we never figure out the extent of their exaggerations

36:25.560 --> 36:30.120
infectious clones are at best poor approximations of coronaviruses and our synthetic infectious

36:30.120 --> 36:36.840
constructs that allow controlled experiments to be conducted coronaviruses exist as semi-stable

36:36.840 --> 36:47.800
quasi-species which could be wrong that could be wrong man synthetic infectious constructs which

36:47.800 --> 36:55.960
allow controlled experiments to be conducted coronaviruses exist as semi-stable quasi-species

36:55.960 --> 37:03.480
in nature and are largely benign genetic noise especially in healthy mammalian populations

37:06.840 --> 37:22.440
and sorry I had to fix that camera that should be all right and our largely benign genetic

37:22.440 --> 37:28.280
noise so that's good especially in healthy mammal populations and so you can see I'm still not

37:28.840 --> 37:33.880
saying that they're just exosomes but I'm trying to express the idea that the story that we've

37:33.880 --> 37:47.240
been told is greatly exaggerated and that the story that we were told is greatly exaggerated

37:48.600 --> 37:56.840
and and that might be sufficient that might be sufficient I don't know why I'm so pixelated

37:56.920 --> 38:01.480
it's kind of annoying to me what's going on here this whole business is is goofy

38:04.920 --> 38:10.280
and so benign genetic noise especially in healthy mammal populations at worst infectious clones

38:10.280 --> 38:14.520
found in laboratories all over the world represent a purity level of a biological agent that would

38:14.520 --> 38:19.720
otherwise never exist and have manufactured to quantity represent a significant potential

38:19.720 --> 38:25.960
danger with untold potential possible consequences but this danger is obviously man-made an absent

38:25.960 --> 38:31.320
in nature and gain a function as a boogie man is distracting us from this fact can you hear this

38:31.320 --> 38:37.560
how good it is furthermore synthetic biology allows for the directed selection of optimized

38:37.560 --> 38:43.320
molecules and even short immunogenic sequences that when inserted into a synthetic infectious RNA

38:43.320 --> 38:48.440
could create a new and as yet undescribed danger however even then it would only be in a pure

38:48.440 --> 38:52.680
quantity that any such agent would pose a potential threat to many thousands of people

38:53.560 --> 38:59.640
the idea of a natural yet novel coronavirus posing a threat to millions of people is a myth

38:59.640 --> 39:06.200
because of the dynamic nature of RNA viruses and on this we agree however a pure infectious clone

39:06.200 --> 39:12.760
of even an endemic human coronavirus OC43 made to a quantity of thousands of leaders might pose a

39:12.760 --> 39:18.040
threat such an event intentional or accidental would result in a situation where even a non-specific

39:18.120 --> 39:24.360
PCR diagnostic could appear to be rather accurate for a time while we agree that there have been

39:24.360 --> 39:29.400
many many lies during covid we believe that the situation is complicated and that the no virus

39:29.400 --> 39:37.160
stands lacks sufficient nuance to be the most viable position i'm not sure that's such a bad

39:37.720 --> 39:42.840
statement especially at the time that it was made well this is driving me nuts

39:43.160 --> 39:54.840
but i really feel like this is not in focus so i am going to put it in focus one more time sorry

39:54.840 --> 40:10.360
about that guys so weird so many glitches today so many glitches um and there i'm out of focus again

40:11.160 --> 40:19.160
just don't know what's up with OBS is something is wrong with my my business here we'll figure it

40:19.160 --> 40:25.880
out though it's no problem i just i look pixelated do i look pixelated to youtube because that's not

40:25.880 --> 40:33.240
how i should look and i bet i don't look and then it goes away on this screen see shoot something

40:33.240 --> 40:38.840
as goofy with this GoPro sometimes i think or no wait it should have been on the other one not on

40:38.920 --> 40:47.960
this one oh that's bad news bears is what that is i don't get that at all okay i'll figure that

40:47.960 --> 40:53.160
outlated look fine to me not pixelated all right um so anyway the point is is that this video that

40:53.160 --> 40:58.040
we're going to watch wow are we going to watch it anytime soon 38 minutes in the video that we're

40:58.040 --> 41:04.760
going to watch is a response to this okay that's the thing this is the video is a response to this

41:05.560 --> 41:11.800
email and so that's uh that's pretty it should be pretty revealing then okay

41:23.480 --> 41:29.720
might be loud at the beginning so i apologize i'll put it down right now actually they're just a

41:29.720 --> 41:31.400
second to make sure it's not too loud

41:34.200 --> 41:40.440
hey everyone the purpose of this video is to address a few recent statements made by jj kui

41:41.080 --> 41:45.960
the clips will play during this video come from a recent twitch stream put on by jj

41:45.960 --> 41:51.720
as well as a recent podcast that jj appeared in as a guest according to jj's linkedin he is a

41:51.720 --> 41:57.960
teacher a biologist and the founder of giga ohm biological given that jj is frequently promoted

41:58.280 --> 42:04.600
that's nice because actually very few people Brett Weinstein has never said giga ohm biological

42:04.600 --> 42:12.040
out loud so already at least Alex is not a complete creep um very few people have said giga ohm

42:12.040 --> 42:18.680
biological out loud maybe it's a a big couple of words but um it's surprising actually it's a

42:18.680 --> 42:23.400
fairly nice shout out so that's okay with me by leading voices in the health freedom movement

42:23.400 --> 42:27.960
you felt it is necessary to respond to jj statements regarding how can somebody with 3,000

42:27.960 --> 42:33.640
followers on twitch and at the time less than 10,000 followers on twitter be a significant

42:33.640 --> 42:40.600
person in the what in the hell kind of stupid statement is that wow that is bad you know come

42:40.600 --> 42:46.680
from a recent twitch stream put on by jj as well as a recent podcast that jj appeared in as a guest

42:47.240 --> 42:53.880
according to jj's linkedin he is a teacher a biologist and the founder of giga ohm biological

42:53.880 --> 42:57.960
given that jj is frequently promoted by leading voices in the health freedom movement we felt

42:57.960 --> 43:03.240
that it was necessary to respond to jj statements regarding the no virus position his mischaracterization

43:03.240 --> 43:07.720
of prominent voices in the no virus camp and his questioning of the motives of those who are

43:07.720 --> 43:13.400
communicating the lack of true scientific validation for virology this video we put together is also

43:13.480 --> 43:18.760
perfect opportunity to address some common misconceptions for those who are still undecided

43:18.760 --> 43:23.960
about the validity of virology or lack thereof we look forward to hearing from jj and having

43:23.960 --> 43:28.520
further discussions on this issue i didn't enjoy the video this is just downloaded from

43:28.520 --> 43:33.720
right thanks everybody for joining us i think you can see all the

43:34.360 --> 43:41.800
panelists that we've amassed today and before we get started because what we're going to do is

43:41.800 --> 43:51.640
look at some of the comments that a i'm not sure exactly who he is his name is jj kui

43:51.640 --> 44:00.440
and i believe he's a consultant for chd and i believe he has a phd and some sort of scientific

44:00.440 --> 44:07.320
discipline from what i understand so that's uh that's what i get it i that's what i'm using in the

44:07.480 --> 44:10.840
beginning all the time i'm going to put this just a little faster because this is

44:11.960 --> 44:18.200
it's pretty slow

44:20.840 --> 44:28.040
but i really wanted to preface uh this event with is this has been uh i think for all of us i'll

44:28.040 --> 44:34.040
speak for myself but i may be able to speak for the rest of us a kind of bizarre and frustrating

44:34.040 --> 44:43.080
few years and i've often asked myself why has this been so frustrating and so difficult to have

44:43.640 --> 44:51.400
a conversation that resolves the questions around virology why has it been so difficult to come to

44:51.400 --> 44:58.360
any agreements between quote both sides and i think there's actually a very simple answer to that

44:58.920 --> 45:06.040
and that is when you look at the the central issue which is what we talk about which is

45:06.600 --> 45:14.840
is there evidence or proof that these so-called pathogenic viruses actually exist now the

45:14.840 --> 45:18.520
interesting thing and i know we've talked about this a lot but i'm not sure if people

45:19.080 --> 45:25.720
completely appreciate this is that the way to answer that question is extremely clear

45:26.680 --> 45:34.520
the way you you should do it is you make a essentially a definition of what you're looking for

45:34.520 --> 45:40.920
which we have you know a replication competent protein coat genetic interior that you know

45:40.920 --> 45:47.880
replicates in living cells and you go look for that in various quote infected animal plant or

45:47.880 --> 45:54.760
human tissue that's the way we look for most things now we all know and we all agreed that

45:54.840 --> 46:00.920
and christine knows this better than anybody because we have hundreds now of of answers from

46:00.920 --> 46:07.080
institutions saying using that simple method none of these particles have ever been found

46:07.720 --> 46:13.640
and again it's very clear that nobody disputes that i mean think of it another way right

46:14.520 --> 46:20.360
supposedly he amassed these five experts and is wasting their collective

46:20.840 --> 46:27.480
hour like five human hours are being wasted to respond to someone that he didn't even bother

46:27.480 --> 46:33.800
to look up on PubMed that's what we're really dealing with here Alex actually bothered to look

46:33.800 --> 46:40.360
on my LinkedIn but Tom Cowan makes a show of saying that he didn't even bother

46:42.600 --> 46:48.360
and and it's a it's a hit piece you can clearly see that this isn't meant to acknowledge what i

46:48.360 --> 46:55.080
just read to you it's not meant to acknowledge that i just admitted that we there you could see

46:55.080 --> 47:02.440
that even if i wasn't even if in that text i'm wrong about things even if the quasi species is

47:02.440 --> 47:10.760
a complete illusion even if it's only synthetic signals and that's it PCR works DNA is something

47:10.760 --> 47:16.840
RNA is something and PCR can amplify it because we in control conditions that happens

47:19.800 --> 47:25.880
and so maybe that's not that has not obviously that has not unlocked all the keys to understanding

47:25.880 --> 47:31.000
all of our biology but that's the same thing as saying you don't understand how the grid works

47:31.000 --> 47:35.400
but you understand how a light bulb works there are lots of examples of light bulbs that we

47:35.400 --> 47:37.880
understand without understanding how the grid works

47:41.160 --> 47:44.920
you can understand how a fan with an electric motor works right when you plug it into the

47:44.920 --> 47:47.320
wall even though you don't understand how the grid is maintained

47:51.160 --> 47:56.120
you can understand how you send an email even if you don't know how packets of information

47:56.120 --> 47:58.360
move on the internet or how multicasting works

47:58.360 --> 48:08.760
and so it's very frustrating because again you can only see this as part of the show

48:09.640 --> 48:15.240
remember that there is a picture of Andy Kaufman shaking hands with Andrew Cuomo at a

48:15.880 --> 48:22.520
grant award poster presentation in 2019 where his company or his group or whatever has been

48:22.520 --> 48:30.280
awarded a not tiny sum of money I don't think it was millions of dollars to develop a prototype

48:31.160 --> 48:33.160
biosensor for prisoners

48:36.280 --> 48:42.920
this is not just some guy who's been campaigning against the falsehoods of psychiatry for his whole

48:42.920 --> 48:51.640
life like Dr. Bragan has been an outspoken critic of things his whole life like Dr. Bragan has been

48:53.480 --> 48:59.560
but now the psychiatrist that everybody knows is speaking out against psychiatry is Andy Kaufman

48:59.560 --> 49:06.520
and one of the first people to announce him as relevant for anything in my life happened in

49:06.520 --> 49:15.640
2020 in March and in April and the name came out of the same mouth five weeks in a row over and

49:15.640 --> 49:22.040
over again we have to oppose the no virus people we have to stop people like Andy Kaufman we have

49:22.040 --> 49:32.040
to oppose the 5g people and that was not a mistake ladies and gentlemen they are or some of

49:32.040 --> 49:38.760
these people or some of the people behind them are part of the narrative curation machine

49:40.840 --> 49:48.520
lab leak natural virus no virus three wrong answers three sets of dumb questions

49:49.320 --> 49:57.320
and a spectacular commitment to those three lists of questions has gotten us where we are today

49:59.000 --> 50:04.440
where there are basically three camps the camp that thinks it's just the way it is the camp that

50:04.440 --> 50:10.200
thinks that we did it and the camp that thinks that there's none of this and the camp that thinks

50:10.280 --> 50:19.160
there's none of this is not tuned in to the idea of of what we know and don't know about biology

50:19.160 --> 50:26.680
but actually being encouraged to discard everything we have learned in biology to discard all of the

50:26.680 --> 50:34.600
knowledge that we have rather than just the contaminated parts like virology and public health to reexamine

50:34.600 --> 50:38.920
what we know and we don't want to do that we just want to burn the whole library down instead of

50:39.000 --> 50:45.320
getting the books that have been plagiarized out to get the books that are actually not supposed

50:45.320 --> 50:51.240
to be in the nonfiction section out of the nonfiction section they are encouraging us essentially

50:51.240 --> 50:57.960
you heard Tom Cowan yesterday say that there are no ion channels no ion currents no no action

50:57.960 --> 51:06.200
potentials none of these these phenomenon are real and so he's suggesting we should just burn

51:06.200 --> 51:11.560
down the entire nonfiction section instead of getting rid of this books that are full of lies

51:11.560 --> 51:18.200
the fiction part and you're seeing it in real time right here i actually think Mark Bailey is an

51:18.200 --> 51:26.280
unwilling participant at this point he hasn't smiled on camera in in ages because he doesn't

51:26.280 --> 51:32.360
feel comfortable i don't think walking this exact line all the time where we're gonna talk about

51:32.360 --> 51:36.760
isolation and purification and nothing else and we're gonna pretend that there's no other

51:36.760 --> 51:41.160
argument to be made and more importantly we're gonna pretend that nobody was murdered to make

51:41.160 --> 51:48.200
up this shit because that's the part that the no virus people never have said in three years is

51:48.200 --> 51:54.120
that if there was no virus then what happened that means that people were murdered in the United

51:54.120 --> 51:59.400
States why aren't they saying that they either murdered them or they lied that they died in either

51:59.400 --> 52:07.560
way it's part of there's no virus isn't it isn't it and yet for some reason in this hour you're

52:07.560 --> 52:15.080
not going to hear one peep about the people that have been been killed because our border was opened

52:15.080 --> 52:22.040
and opiates flooded our streets you're not going to hear one mention of the fact that American

52:22.040 --> 52:26.520
authorities are lying about what happened in America to make sure that we believe there was a virus

52:26.520 --> 52:32.600
when there was no virus no they're just going to keep harping on foyas and they're going to keep

52:32.600 --> 52:39.960
harping on the experimental protocols that they say they're calling out that's fine i get it but

52:39.960 --> 52:46.200
they called those protocols out for AIDS too so it's a song that's been sung you can you can cover it

52:46.200 --> 52:55.560
but then let's let's let's make new music here let's move on but they won't and i can't stress

52:55.560 --> 53:01.400
how important it is for everybody watching this to try and really grasp that that if their goal

53:01.400 --> 53:08.120
was to score a touchdown on there is no virus then talking about the murders in america and in europe

53:08.120 --> 53:13.720
and in anywhere else where they occurred in order to create the illusion of spread would be a central

53:13.720 --> 53:24.280
part of their presentation every night so let's do it

53:27.000 --> 53:33.320
the virologists and people on other people have reasons why that can't why you can't find them like

53:33.320 --> 53:40.680
that and so okay so that's that's that so then you go to the next step which is the what they call

53:40.680 --> 53:48.840
the viral culture and again to be very clear and i would say there's no disagreement about this

53:48.840 --> 53:56.840
with anybody that can anyone not see that can anyone not understand that that if you don't say

53:57.720 --> 54:04.840
there was no sars covi too spreading and therefore they murdered people then you're not you're not

54:04.840 --> 54:14.040
you're not doing it they have had four years to say it four years they've been standing on the

54:14.040 --> 54:20.520
PCR is dumb and there's no virus but they haven't been able to say therefore people were murdered

54:20.520 --> 54:27.080
therefore people lied about how many people died they're not saying that they're not saying that

54:27.080 --> 54:32.120
wow they what how did these people get killed then is it because we treated them all poorly why

54:32.120 --> 54:37.480
why don't they want to explain that so that people can see the full malevolence

54:40.040 --> 54:45.960
and the reason why is because it is a slow role to the truth ladies and gentlemen and it is a

54:45.960 --> 54:51.320
slow role to the truth all the pigs are not in the cage so you cannot spring the trap yet

54:52.920 --> 54:56.600
a lot of the pigs have been in the cage for a long time and are wondering what the hell we're

54:56.600 --> 55:06.360
doing out here yet but ladies and gentlemen see this for what it is i just read to you what

55:06.360 --> 55:13.000
they are responding to they're going to tell you that they're responding to a a uh a live stream

55:13.000 --> 55:18.600
that i did but there that it's nonsense this is a week after i sent that email and the emails that

55:18.600 --> 55:24.840
follow it are are extraordinary i mean i challenged them i'm like and you don't need me to give you

55:24.840 --> 55:31.880
a paper on infectious clones go to PubMed insert those two words hit search and just start reading

55:32.600 --> 55:35.480
and you will see infectious clones are the way it's done

55:41.240 --> 55:46.440
and they just you know they say that that means that i ignored their request for papers that i

55:46.440 --> 55:53.320
couldn't provide any papers that's that's what they'll say here the virology community since 1954

55:53.320 --> 55:59.800
has said that the way you find a virus the way you isolate a virus the way you identify

55:59.800 --> 56:06.920
and show that a virus exists is you put a sample on a cell culture and if there is a

56:06.920 --> 56:12.600
psychopathic effect i it's so much easier to say virology is a lie and they murdered people to hide

56:12.600 --> 56:18.200
that the vaccine schedule is criminal and they murdered people to hide that isn't it so much

56:18.200 --> 56:24.360
easier to say that than this bullshit and once you see it once you hear it you realize what they've

56:24.360 --> 56:33.160
done cpe that proves the existence of the virus everybody agrees that that is virology's central

56:33.160 --> 56:40.200
claim and that is the foundation of virology and every other claim about antibodies about sequences

56:40.200 --> 56:47.400
about anything else to do with virology rests on that isolation they say because if you've

56:47.400 --> 56:53.720
haven't isolated i.e. have a pure sample of the virus you obviously can't find the sequence you

56:53.720 --> 57:00.760
can't show that the antibodies are against it and on and on and on now we're saying i got some emails

57:00.760 --> 57:05.160
from christine massy that i've become convinced weren't even written by her because the language

57:05.160 --> 57:12.440
is just too harsh there's no way that this lady that i've seen i've watched a few podcasts of her

57:12.520 --> 57:18.200
just to try to figure out how is it that this lady can write emails like this i just have

57:18.200 --> 57:22.600
become convinced that she hasn't written those emails that they're that they're written by somebody

57:22.600 --> 57:30.840
else that the so-called viral culture is not a scientifically valid procedure because there are

57:30.840 --> 57:37.960
no independent variables i.e. the presence of a virus and so they never do a sample that they say

57:37.960 --> 57:44.920
has the virus and then take the virus out and then see if they get the same psychopathic effect

57:44.920 --> 57:51.400
which is the only way that that experiment would be valid and so we say that the foundation of

57:51.400 --> 57:58.360
virology is not valid it's not a scientific oh they got my email because i i wrote an email on behalf

57:58.360 --> 58:05.240
of chd at that time so i i was i was i was genuinely thinking that that text was going to make a

58:05.240 --> 58:11.720
breakthrough that we were actually going to come on and do a show maybe bobby would even do a podcast

58:11.720 --> 58:17.000
where i would explain infectious clones to one of these people and we could agree about the fact

58:17.000 --> 58:23.560
that the molecular biology could have been seeded and misconstrued and we could move on together

58:23.560 --> 58:30.360
and it just freaking exploded into this email attacking back and forth you suck give us this

58:30.360 --> 58:37.800
you liar blah blah blah it was unbelievable i spent like three hours writing that thinking i

58:37.800 --> 58:42.200
got to say it right i got to say it right i got to give them enough compliments i got to admit

58:42.200 --> 58:48.760
what we don't know i got to say what chd is letting me say i got i got to use this one opportunity

58:49.320 --> 58:54.200
to to actually bridge this gap and it freaking exploded it was so sad

58:54.360 --> 59:02.600
and this was the only result besides i think mary meeting christine massy on a chd or sorry

59:03.400 --> 59:09.800
a doctors for covid ethics meeting on maybe two weeks or three weeks later where i was not told

59:09.800 --> 59:13.240
that meeting was happening and i didn't see it live and there's only clips left of it

59:13.240 --> 59:20.280
big procedure and so there you cannot use that procedure in the way they use it to claim the

59:20.360 --> 59:26.600
existence of a virus now i would think and i think everybody out there would think

59:26.600 --> 59:31.720
that the entire argument of the people who are arguing against us would be to say

59:32.280 --> 59:37.880
but tom and andy and mark and christine and allak the viral culture is the gold standard it is the

59:37.880 --> 59:43.880
foundation of virology it is a hundred percent accurate we are going to show you that this viral

59:43.880 --> 59:50.600
culture is a is a scientifically validated way to prove the existence of a virus

59:51.720 --> 59:56.600
but you know how many times somebody like dr cooey or the others who

59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.800
quote try to debunk us or argue with it have ever gone over the papers and the procedures

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:10.840
of a viral culture never that's technically not true but i know that he shouldn't he shouldn't

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.640
necessarily know that right i mean it's fine not everybody watches my streams i get it

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.760
but that's not true i have i actually explained it in big words over there in that email i

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.320
tried to imply that i understood it and if he had looked at the streams that i was doing then

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.560
he would have heard me say it as i explained the infectious cycle is best we understood it

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.600
and hinted at that that might not even be right if it's exesomes i was still working through it

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.600
because we're all still working through it and they are absolutely certain there's nothing to

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.840
work through there's just nothing here all of these signals all of these observations

01:00:51.800 --> 01:01:00.040
are false are lies or are something and so rather than being there an illusion of consensus about

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:09.960
some aspect of these observations and a a misappropriation of these observations to support

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.440
something they don't support these guys just want you to burn the whole library down

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.320
and that's a very dangerous position to take because we actually know quite a bit and we could

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:33.320
be helpful in turning the ship around this this dr kui as far as i saw his comments never

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:40.840
mentioned the viral culture or tried to validate or explain to the world or to us that the methods

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:47.480
that the viral culture use are a scientifically validated way to prove the existence of a virus

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:54.360
and yet that's the whole argument and you know i came up with an analogy i would say that the

01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:01.400
whole argument is is that they lied and they murdered people the whole argument is not that

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.160
virology as it stands right now is is uh crappy science

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:17.320
that's not that's not going to solve the problem that that requires people to to

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.320
rather than accept lying they have to accept something about the world they have to accept

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.440
something about something they've already been told they can't possibly understand so

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.560
he's kind of putting everybody that listens to him in a weird position because you're supposed

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:43.320
to accept his interpretation that all of it is nonsense rather than all the other illusion of

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:52.200
consensus around the world that says it's not all nonsense and that's pretty extraordinary ask

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:59.800
of anyone and in fact i've come to realize or come to believe that that ask is extraordinary

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.760
because it is one that isn't necessary it's one that doesn't save you it's one that doesn't save

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.160
your kids and it's one that doesn't save your grandkids because you're not left with a question

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.880
there you're not left with the question of what are these signals what is respiratory illness what

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.480
is our immune system doing what are antibodies then you're not left with any of those questions

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.040
instead you're told not to ask any more questions about those things because they're all dumb

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:37.400
and so it's very important for me to emphasize that the goal of this is for you to understand why

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:46.040
the no virus position has always been weirdly curated and weirdly weaponized in a way that has

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:53.960
never looked to score a touchdown but just to keep everybody scrambling in different directions if

01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:02.440
they wanted to score a touchdown all the pieces are there they've even had the floor at CHD with

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.480
other people on the other side of the camera and they haven't managed to score a touchdown and the

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:14.360
reason why is because one or more of these people or one or more of the people behind them advising

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:22.600
them is making sure they don't score that touchdown because that's not the plan and whoever is involved

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:30.440
in the meddling is part of the plan I assure you because the plan is for all the marbles they left

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:40.280
nothing to chance and wherever there was something they didn't expect they co-opted it or they got

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:46.040
rid of it and with me they tried many many people to co-opt me many many people tried to

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:55.080
lie to me and I bought it many many times and four years later we're finally here where I feel like

01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:02.840
you know more or less I know who lied to me and fortunately for my grandchildren it's a lot of

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.520
these people it's a lot of the people who say that they're saving us that they have the answer that

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.240
they're certain that they're right those are the people who were lying to me and they lied to my

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:18.840
face they lied to me on zoom they lied to me in sms they lied to me on signal and that experience

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.720
is what keeps me coming back every day and so I'm putting this up because I really need you to

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.000
understand that I didn't ignore this video for any other reason than it didn't need amplifying at

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.800
the time that people weren't ready to hear it at the time because I hadn't figured it all out at

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:44.280
that time I still didn't know who was all meddling with me and I was still working for

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.520
Bobby's book and so it just didn't seem like the right thing to do as far as publicity and end and

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.560
but this was there in 2023 they did this in 2023 in response to an email that I wrote that I had

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:05.320
every hope in my being was going to be a breakthrough moment for this no-virus group that they would

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:11.960
finally be able to add a level of nuance to their messaging that would that would kick them up a

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:18.760
level and instead they rejected me like you cannot believe and here it is because I like to do that

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:25.160
so that everybody will understand it's like we're having an argument of our discussion or a debate

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:32.600
of whether these three dots are in a straight line and so people look at it and they say well

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.000
it looks straight to me or my Aunt Bessie said it was straight or we thought it was straight for 40

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.840
years or we vaporized the paper and we got a bunch of chemicals and so that proves that this

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:48.920
was straight or well you could draw a line from the ceiling and it goes through different ways

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:54.040
and everybody would say why don't you just take a ruler and go like that and they're not in a

01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:01.080
straight line why do we have to argue about this just get a ruler and measure it and if it's straight

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:06.280
with straight and if it isn't it isn't and so if you want to say that the cell culture

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.040
the viral culture is the way to prove the existence of a virus which everybody agrees on

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:19.560
let's have the entire debate about the viral culture let's have the entire debate about the

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.840
viral culture has been their strategy since the very beginning and I would argue that sticking

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:31.720
to that strategy cannot be something that they they just have accidentally stuck to

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:40.680
and when they break free of that strategy finally this year if they do it will be because that was

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:47.320
the plan all along that was the plan all along and I don't know which of these people were brought

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:54.280
along which of these people are are unwitting participants but it's unfortunate because this

01:07:54.520 --> 01:08:00.440
really set us very far back said a lot of people very far back because I can tell everybody out

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.040
there I don't know if I have any disagreement from any of our other panelists the viral culture

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:13.000
has is not a valid way to show the existence of a virus the foundation of virology is simply

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
incorrect and no matter how much you vaporize the paper it doesn't show whether it's a straight line

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:24.040
so all we're asking is let's talk about the science of a viral culture

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:31.400
if you do that you'll see it's not a valid they don't do it they don't do appropriate control

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:37.640
what what about in a world where viruses exist but everyone involved has both

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.040
exaggerated their ability to identify and study viruses and underplay the danger of synthetic

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:48.360
infectious clones the most important thing is to move slowly you see I'm trying to help them to

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:55.560
understand that even if there are no significant RNA signals in the wild like coronaviruses

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:02.760
they can make this RNA they can make lots of it they can make the corresponding DNA

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:11.160
and that alone would be enough to seed the molecular signal that they have misconstrued

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:17.000
as a spreading pathogen that is the crucial piece of the puzzle to understand

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:25.320
that the entire illusion that Kevin McCurnan and Charles Rixi and these other people who are

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:31.480
insistent that there was a novel virus that started spreading in October of 2019 in China

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.920
and has spread all around the world including zoo animal population and white-tailed deer in

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:44.760
North America because of the fear and cleavage site because of the staphylcocan and tyratoxin

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:51.640
bee homologies because of the HIV inserts because of the pre-onagenic sequences because

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.160
of the amyloidagenic sequences whatever story they told you from the very beginning

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.000
I lost my train of thought there because I'm just very frustrated I didn't I didn't remember

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.200
this being so annoying but I I do remember being incredibly disappointed by their responses

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.200
because I thought I really put it out on the line there and I really thought it was a significant

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:27.240
moment that Bobby and Mary asked me to write this email I thought it was a very significant moment

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.880
and in retrospect I still think it might have been I wonder what they would have done if these

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.720
people would have come back and said oh wow let's have a discussion about this let's hear this

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.040
rather than came back with their angry response and their snotty response and their shove it in

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:50.680
your scientific advisor's response what if they just said could we have a zoom meeting and discuss

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:57.000
this with him maybe a private zoom meeting with you and Mary and they didn't ask for anything like

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.240
that they didn't suggest anything like that they didn't say thank you very much for your thoughtful

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.320
email it was nothing like that

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:13.480
it was immediately back to viral isolation I can look at it and tell you without showing

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:22.360
you what it was I think dear Robert and Mary I'm following up one last time hoping you will

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:27.080
provide answers Mary if you are we're expecting Jay Kui to answer the questions on behalf of you

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.960
Robert and CHD please let me know he offered to share a hypothesis with me but didn't address

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:40.040
any of my questions hmm so that's really it right thanks for getting back to me this is great

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.280
although I don't see any citations or answers to my questions and to be honest I now have a few

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:52.680
more questions um coronaviruses exist they want me to prove the same the stable uh quasi species

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.360
idea and infectious clones found in laboratories all over the world if it's a synthetic virus

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.320
was ever made was suggested why is it unfindable in the human body why is it impossible to purify

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:13.560
it so again they tried very hard to go back to the purification and and and isolation even though

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.440
in general terms I had already said and admitted that I think a lot of these things are wrong

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.360
and so it seems very strange to me that that this is the direction that it went

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:33.320
and it's just unfortunate because I I've reached out to the Bailey's in 2020 then um I had contact

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:42.360
with Andy Kaufman in 2021 through the um Piper Stover lady who helped me or co-authored or kind

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.800
of helped me with that review that I put out and then I haven't had contact with in a very long time now

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:55.320
um and she apparently could call Andy Kaufman so all these people are connected somehow weird way

01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:04.360
and all of them have tried to hide it from me and so it is really without without reservation

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.360
now that I just throw it all out on the line there I think almost all of these people are

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:15.880
connected in some way through a common handler or a common coordinated table of handlers um

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:23.480
and that's why their narrative is so tight I mean look I can't even give a presentation

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.520
without going off on a tangent every five minutes but these guys they're tight they stick right

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:38.040
on cue like uh right on list it's impressive because they say you can't take the virus out of

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.560
the sample so you can't do a mock infection because that's what it means and yet they say they do

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:52.360
so when you hear him talking everything is downstream never does he address here's the

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.600
reasons why a viral culture proves the existence of a virus period you guys are wrong and so there

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.720
and that time I think basically he's right I never said that and I probably wasn't quite

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:11.240
prepared to say it the way that I can say it now a viral culture is just a transfection most

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:18.200
of virology is done by making this synthetic RNA or the synthetic DNA and then transfecting or

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:23.800
transforming a cell culture and then having that cell culture do whatever it does and whatever it

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:31.320
does there it's most likely some kind of vesicle uh release or or or exosomes or you can say that

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:36.840
it's just making copies of the RNA or sub genomic copies and then and spitting them out I don't know

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.200
what it is I agree they haven't really analyzed that but whatever it is that happens in that cell

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.440
culture that supernatant can be taken and that supernatant can be put in other preparations that

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:57.560
will cause semi predictable things to happen and that's the extent to which we get it we don't have

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:03.800
any equivalent from nature in other words we can't do that experiment with the sample from a bat

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.320
because if you put the sample from a bat in 96 well preparation and only two of those wells

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.120
show any signal like they did when they isolated the virus in Wuhan and then you use metagenomic

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.560
sequencing to claim that something's in there that's already pretty sketch

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:29.240
and since metagenomic sequencing is essentially proprietary technology that was invented by Nathan

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:35.800
wolf and friends it just feels very bad metabioda is nothing that we want in our narrative of reality

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.600
and so again they are right about all these things they were right about these things from the beginning

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.360
and so again if they really wanted to score a touchdown I'm going to say it one more time

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.320
than they would say there was no virus and they murdered people to lie about it they were willing

01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.440
to murder people to make sure that this illusion of no virus was preserved and that we would pass

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.480
this illusion on to our children and they they don't seem to be able to say that they just want

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:14.840
you to say over and over again Dr. Cooley won't debate the viral preparation Dr. Cooley won't

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:23.720
debate viral culture it's it's an important thing to see on that never happens that's why we never

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:31.160
get anywhere with these debates and there you go so that's a little long-winded but I thought

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.720
we could put that in context and anybody else has anything comment on what I just said I'd

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:42.360
love to hear well Tom I actually um you know I agree that no one really ever wants to debate

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.720
this but I actually got the sense from some others that they kind of concede that the viral

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.520
culture really doesn't prove it but they want to point to all this other indirect evidence

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:58.680
and say that the totality of it adds up to the proof or you know or have the appeal to authority

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:04.280
kind of fallacy where you know virologists have been you know discovering and studying viruses for

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.880
you know 60 years and they couldn't have just wasted all their efforts oh oh so that's addressing

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.680
another point they couldn't have just wasted all their efforts is that a nuanced way of saying

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:21.000
because he's about to say they're all wrong the observations were real their interpretation was

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.960
wrong they couldn't have all been wrong in that book from the 80s those gels are real those

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.760
preps are real those guys are trying to figure it out at the time they didn't have any better tools

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:43.880
this is what they saw I think we're gonna find that it is much more subtle than virology as a whole

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:53.480
is fake that there are no viruses is to say that there are no signals at this size scale and we

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:59.640
know that there are there have been biologists all around the world for three decades working on

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.800
what's called exosomal communication and all of these researchers and research lines have been

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:15.560
absorbed via funding schemes into cancer biology and exosomal communication is exclusively studied

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:22.680
under the rubric that it is a way of finding and diagnosing cancer rather than an aberrant signal

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:31.080
produced by cancer which has its own natural homologue in exosomal communication that's there

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:37.880
and pleasant in the plasma all the time that the immune system might communicate with retroviruses

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.640
and that the contamination of our plasma with other retroviruses from other animals might be

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:50.040
devastating to our immune system is probably the story behind AIDS which doesn't say that there's

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.600
no AIDS it doesn't say that there's no retroviruses it doesn't say that some people were not hurt

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.480
because their immune system was compromised but how it is being compromised the mechanism by

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.760
which it's being compromised and the possible solutions for it have been distorted by a mythology

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:14.440
and so I would suggest that respiratory disease as it stands in a big umbrella term has been

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:24.280
distorted to be caused by a signal which may only be roughly correlated with it sometimes

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:31.240
and that is exosomal signaling exosomal signaling where an RNA dependent RNA polymerase is present

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:38.440
because the one theme of RNA virology is an RNA dependent RNA polymerase which they would like

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:45.160
you to believe is a virology exclusive enzyme but it's not and I think that's probably one of the

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:51.960
bigger lies they're protecting is if you understood that all virology that supposedly this Baltimore

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.480
scheme describes all these special enzymes that only viruses have you're just buying into

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:04.360
their nonsense they have taken that that endogenous biology that's most likely hours and misconstrued

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:12.200
it as exclusively virology it's not it's exosomal communication and maybe there are rare examples

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.960
where exosomal communication can go wrong and maybe one rare example is measles or maybe one rare

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:29.480
example is a herpes virus maybe I don't know I'm not a virologist but I can say with a pretty

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.920
reasonable amount of confidence that I'm willing to risk my family's future on the idea that RNA

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.880
cannot pandemic I'm willing to risk my family's future on the idea that intramuscular injection

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:44.200
of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:49.720
and I'm willing to risk my family's future that somewhere in this group of people or somewhere

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:57.880
behind it is a group of people that was using this argument and this set of questions to

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:09.800
dis-capacitate the d d i don't remember what his word was but to to remove our ability to

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:15.480
exercise informed consent to set another cognitive trap where people would get stuck in a hamster

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:20.520
wheel and that hamster wheel would feel like they were doing something right just like I was in a

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:26.920
hamster wheel in 2020 and early 2021 thinking that a lab leak was part of the story I needed to

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:32.520
tell in order for people to understand what was going on and that arguing about a lab leak or

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.480
and not a natural virus and pointing out that it was a cover-up was part of waking people up

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.760
and that's uh that was a hamster wheel that people tricked me into jumping into and then

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:51.080
sprinting on and I would suggest that this is another hamster wheel that a lot of people were

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.280
were encouraged to get on and run fast like her

01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:04.200
and her campaign for fluoride is over now or or what now it's just foyer foyer foyer

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:11.160
I don't I don't get it other than I feel like this was curated and I'm I'm pretty sure I'm right

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:18.600
you know but but it seems like sometimes that it's there is no real argument that you decapableize

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.680
that's to show that the viral culture is a proper scientific experiment because as you

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:27.160
pointed out there's no independent variable so right there you can kind of toss it aside

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.160
you don't even have to say that there's no valid control because first you have to have the

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.800
independent variable to begin with which means you actually have to discover a virus in nature

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.200
because that is the independent variable you can't use an indirect experiment to prove something

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:46.440
exists without having the thing in the first place unless the thing like an RNA dependent RNA

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.960
polymerase already exists in the background as a as a rare signal that can be found because that's

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:58.280
how coronavirus was found in the early 2000s and again I suggested that they go back to those

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.160
literature and just read it because I agree with them wholeheartedly they were looking for an enzyme

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:09.480
and actually an only a small 300 base pair amplicon part of that enzyme most conserved

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.400
and then use that as the basis for saying okay we have a signal in this tube and so now we're

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:24.280
going to use nathan wolf and metagenomics uh metobiodas excuse me metagenomic sequencing algorithms

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:29.880
to pull up all the signals in this tube because we found this one amplicon of an RNA dependent

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:36.840
RNA polymerase and that's an indicator of a coronavirus that's exactly the wording in these

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.720
papers from the WIV and from barracks lab that collaborated together that supposedly represents

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:50.920
the foundation of gain of function coronavirus research it's just indirect measurement of RNA

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:57.320
ghosts and I've been saying that for about three years now two years really hard one year

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:06.520
hardened a paint and they're ignoring them and they continue to ignore it quite frankly which

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.360
is really extraordinary so you know that's that's the whole point of it and by arguing about oh you

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:18.600
know the cause of of this illness or about a phenomenon that you see in the laboratory or about

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.800
genetic sequences reported in a database all that really is completely irrelevant when you

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.960
haven't started with actually discovering the organism and nature first right

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:38.520
I just add to Tom with regards to virology and the agreed-upon way in which they isolated quite

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:44.520
virus and we know that the cell culture is one of the things they've held up since the

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:50.520
1950s is perhaps they're quite gold standard but we should also be careful too because they

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.720
incredibly loose within virology when they use the term isolation and in fact I truly believe

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:04.520
we need to address this too what my suggestion to you is is that if they wanted to have pushed

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:11.880
this ball farther than they did in 2020 2021 or 2022 they could have

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:18.200
by explicitly saying that if there is no virus the only conclusion we can come to

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.720
is that if anybody is dying they are dying for no reason they are dying because they are being

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:31.400
manslaughter murdered and for three years for whatever reason this group of geniuses was never

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.520
able to get past the isolation purification virology cultures are fake

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:44.760
but if they murdered people and lied on television in order to preserve this mythology

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:49.400
you'd think that would be a pretty powerful part of the story for them to regularly hammer

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:56.600
hey America we're we're too cute little New Zealanders down here in New Zealand having our

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.920
own little farm and living all naturally and we just wanted to let you know that one of the

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.920
reasons why we know they're lying about virology is because they probably just murdered people in

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:11.240
America but Sam Bailey's never been able to come to that conclusion never been able to do that

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:20.200
math where wait if the PCR was fake which she was talking about in 2020 then they treat people

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:26.920
differently remember these people are both doctors both Bailey's are MDs and yet somehow

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.280
or another they never said that well if the PCR is fake and then they start treating people

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.560
for pneumonia differently like you know not using antibiotics or or not using um

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:47.720
or using something like remdesivir or medazalam where is all the summary over how obvious it is

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.360
that there's no virus because they murdered people with medazalam because they lied about

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.760
the cause of death because they use respirators and ventilators when they shouldn't have

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.480
because they use drugs that kill people because they flooded the streets with opiates because of

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:08.440
this long list of things there is no virus instead it is purification isolation culture

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:14.680
purification isolation culture three dots on a page and arguing about whether they connect or not

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:24.200
and they did it for going on for years now there's just something wrong with it

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:34.200
and I think that's what's wrong with it it's not meant to score a touchdown just like Robert Malone's

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:42.520
objection to the vaccine on June 20 June and 2021 on Brett Weinstein's podcast with Steve

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.880
Kirst wasn't meant to score a touchdown just like the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:57.080
isn't meant to score a touchdown they're meant to be hamster wheels that delay our progress

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:05.080
that make us feel productive by asking the wrong questions over and over and over again

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:12.040
if they haven't even standardized it so if you read what most virology textbooks you cannot find

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.160
in the glossary it will not specifically say what it is and we all know from listening to

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.760
virologists that it can mean anything from taking a sample from a person it can mean the cell

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.920
culture result it can mean plaque assades it can mean simply detecting genetic sequences so all of

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:35.400
these methodologies have been used to declare isolation absolutely no argument with Mark Bailey

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.080
most of the things that he says are so focused and spot on I like the farewell to virology document

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.120
it's pretty solid as well he complements and builds on things that people did before him

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:53.480
Mark Bailey may be the reason why all these other people exist and maybe why a lot of people try

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.960
to focus on Sam Bailey all the time instead of Mark because Mark is really not down with it

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.080
the game that we're being that's being played here Mark is not really down with it he he was not a

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.920
impressive interview on Mark Coolak show for example and when Mark Coolak asked him about

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:19.560
exosomes it was just kind of a big mirror it's unfortunate you know they have as much certainty

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:28.280
as the liars do about virology that they're right but they have no they have no nuanced explanation

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:33.080
for where we are just nowhere and I think the reason this is important and we'll see in some of the

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.160
I'm not talking about Mark though I'm talking mostly about Andy Kaufman and Tom Cole

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:42.280
yes we're about to analyze is that and I've addressed this criticism of Christine's work before as well

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:48.600
and in fact I dedicated a whole section to it in my essay farewell to virology and people

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:54.600
allege that Christine is wording it in some particular semantic trick so that there's no

01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:00.760
possible way that they could know what we're what we're trying to argue is is that there are a

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:06.760
number of reasons why foyas don't work as definitive evidence of anything especially if you start

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:15.560
foying random police departments and then it doesn't matter what language you use or or how you do it

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.560
this is another one of those hamster wheels and then to emphasize this hamster wheel as

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:29.080
gold standard evidence see we told you so anybody that works in government anybody that works in

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.560
the press for any length of time anyone that's tried to get information from the government

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.600
using a foyer request especially the American government understands that even if you have all

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.880
the nuances correct they can still avoid you they can still delay it they can still give you a

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:51.320
non-answer never mind the fact that if this is as I've posited for several years now and national

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:56.120
security priority they can just lie come on

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.880
you know isolated and quote a virus but Christine's work is super important because

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.600
thousands of times around the world and it's not just SARS-CoV-2 it's with all sorts of

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:15.080
quote viruses they say they've isolated they actually say in the titles of these papers that

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.440
they have isolated the virus and we know that they have it and I think that that's what

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:26.920
Dr. Kui and others are missing is it is very important the way we actually define what I think

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:34.040
he says it very nicely and I really appreciate that he respects that that you know he says it in

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:39.080
a way or you're missing it and I think that what they're missing is is that the other half of the

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:43.720
story is then that means they murdered people and you guys have missed it for four years where you

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:48.440
it would have been an easy slam dunk for you to say on every single appearance you were ever on

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.520
Andy Kaufman doesn't care about the people that were murdered in his state of new home state of

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:59.880
New York isn't that where he lives or is he live in Vermont I mean it's crazy

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:07.720
the mass casualty event in New York City that could be used as the shining beacon of lie and

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:15.880
deception and murder by these people for as long as the pandemic has existed as not on the radar

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:23.880
at all at all like just you know here's an easy dunk no oh sorry I can't see that isolation

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:29.320
what'd you say again? Flation is so if Christine's proved that you can go around the world

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.720
hundreds of different institutions and when you find out what they actually mean by isolation

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:38.040
we can see it doesn't have anything to do with the physical isolation of the particle and it can

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:44.040
mean just about anything they want and if you haven't isolated it you cannot study it and find out

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:50.680
what it's made of that's just the rule of nature okay now we're going to pull up some clips from

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:56.920
JJ a monologue that he gave in a video he produced referencing some of Christine's work and all

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.880
it's not a monologue I always do a monologue this is a monologue too so you know I don't need to

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:06.120
interview people all the time because I'm a teacher so if I don't have anything to teach I

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:12.440
guess go subscribe to somebody else Alex also loosely referencing some other what he calls virus

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:18.040
deniers and discuss some various points in the clips I'm interested now how is this a gotcha

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:24.440
well I'll tell you how because for the last five or eight or ten years it has always been

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.280
that in order to isolate a virus you start with a cell culture you start with something else

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:37.160
or you sequence it and then you make your best guess cDNA version of it and you use an infectious

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.840
clone proxy for it which is what I'm talking about with regard to the Scooby-Doo they are trying to

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.480
make you believe that natural viruses or combinations of natural genes are capable of generating a

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:53.400
viral product that can generate a pandemic and I believe the biology of coronaviruses does not

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.600
support that idea but they really want you to believe it does and actually the only way to weaponize

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.600
a coronavirus would be to make a large quantity of an RNA infectious clone which would allow some

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:12.280
degree of legitimate PCR positivity some legitimate sequences and the other way that you can get

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:17.800
legitimate PCR positivity and legitimate sequences is to have SARS related viruses already in the

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:25.000
background for 20 years that's the most parsimonious explanation in my humble opinion yeah so so Jay

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.800
he's talking about clones and coronaviruses he's talking about methodologies that

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.360
can't actually demonstrate the existence of a virus because he's talking about cell

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.960
culture he's talking about sequencing something making the best guess cDNA version of something

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:45.880
and so he's not even discussing methods that could show the existence of a virus but he's still

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:51.000
talking about viruses which is confusing and I would just love for him to just cite a paper if

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.400
he's insisting that these exist why doesn't he just cite one for us also he talks about the

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:04.120
possibility of legit PCR PCR for a virus and yet we know that even under the best case scenario

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:10.200
even if a virus was shown to exist and a PCR test was done in the optimal manner it would still only

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.600
give you some evidence of a of a little sequence being present it wouldn't show you you wouldn't

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.800
be able to confirm a virus and so you're not an infection or disease so I hope you can yeah

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.600
that's what I wanted to say about that just I hope you can hear that it just it really seems

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.480
as though they are pretending they don't understand very much like Kevin McCurnan pretended he didn't

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.040
understand and had to come up with all these little ways are you saying that they took the

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:40.280
DNA and sprayed it around are you saying that the DNA is what they used are you saying that they

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.240
sprayed the RNA around or what are you saying exactly I don't get it what do you mean

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.000
and so they're acting like they don't understand what I've said or they haven't watched more than

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.360
this clip and they don't get it that what I'm I'm saying that RNA virology is exaggerated I'm saying

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:02.200
that there's probably a signal there and then what they're gonna hammer on is that I'm still

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.760
unfortunately using the terminology that I was given at that time and still stuck with because

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.640
I was working on the book with SARS viruses in the background and I wasn't quite nuanced enough

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:18.840
to say that a background signal could be misconstrued as coronavirus is spreading could be

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.480
misconstrued as viruses in the background and that background signal could be anything

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:29.400
it could be noise it could be bacteriophages it can be any combination of bacteriophages noise

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:35.000
exosomes everything and from not just us but our environment and all the living beings in it

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and I wasn't there yet I wasn't quite as practiced as I am now but I believe wholeheartedly that you

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.920
can already see that they're ignoring what I'm saying to try and simplify what I'm saying

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:59.320
to defending virology and I'm not I just shredded it right there as best as I could in 2023 and they

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.920
pretend as though I'm just defending virology as it stands and I would like to see some evidence

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:12.840
for these coronaviruses that he keeps talking about and you go ahead yeah I just want to pick up on a

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.680
quote we do have a transcript of these clips so I didn't memorize it that quickly but he said you

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.560
know it has always been that in order to isolate a virus you start with a cell culture you start

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.600
with something else now why would you start with something else besides what you're trying to

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.440
discover that that's just a very strange thing why would you start with a cell culture well I

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:37.800
wouldn't you start with the source of the virus in nature and then he goes on to say that when you

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:43.000
sequence it you make your best guess version of it now why would you have to guess if something

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.440
is real and in nature we've shown that we have the sequencing technology to take a known organism

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:54.120
and you know sequence it in its entirety and you know we can talk about the significance of the

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:58.520
genetic sequence in a separate discussion but certainly there's no reason to guess and then he

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:05.080
goes on to say further that that you use an infectious clone proxy for it in order to study

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.640
now if the real thing exists why would you have to use a proxy why couldn't you use the real

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:17.560
nice so here you go you see how close we were in 2020 but they still want to pretend that this

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:25.400
is an idiot they are portraying to their listeners that I am as foolish as anybody has ever been

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:34.120
foolish look look at this please oh sorry you can't see it what do I have to do escape yeah look at

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:41.800
this look at this oh this is in the player I'm sorry so I got to look it up on on on rumble to show you

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:48.840
this uh hold on one second please just be you know you're here for the for the long haul so you

01:38:48.840 --> 01:39:00.200
know just hang on I'll find it um and I need to look for uh it's like

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.080
no um

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:30.840
uh maybe that'll do it oh what the hell do I can I look at my history maybe darn it

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:32.760
um

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:39.640
um I just had it I did I swear I just had it darn it

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.080
um

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:49.880
but what it says on the bottom of the the rumble video version of this is or or one of them it

01:39:49.880 --> 01:40:00.200
says that um that uh another another something something is uh you know destroyed by these people

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:07.000
or or or you know made a fool of whatever corrected um it's a it's a hit piece um

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:13.400
anyway it's not meant to be nice and they're not meant they're they're overlooking what I just

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:19.640
said which is really frustrating in retrospect how much they did not thing in fact play fair

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:25.800
an infectious clone proxy requires significant effort and technology whereas if you already have

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.880
found this um organism or particle in nature uh then you could simply study it further you don't

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:36.760
wow so what is the point here then are they not going to admit then that an infectious clone

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.520
could be lied about because there are no viruses don't you see how I handed it to him

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.440
I handed it to him on a civil or platter and then the guy who was shaking hands with Andrew

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:54.920
Kromo in 2019 after winning a small grant to produce a bio bio sensor for prisoners

01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:01.480
tells you to ignore the infectious clone comment if a if an infectious clone is a proxy then why

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.160
do you need to use a proxy he doesn't understand what I just said in my email and what I've said

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:12.680
there that it's a purity level that doesn't exist in nature and that's the lie that's the danger

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:19.080
he doesn't see it he can't after three years of working hard on this question can't see

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.640
what Dr. Kui is almost there but not quite

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.800
come on guys if you don't see this for what it is I don't know if I can help you anymore because

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.480
this is really wonderful you need to go to the expense and the effort and time to make a synthetic

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.640
version of it it just doesn't make sense that you would you would do it if you wanted to lie

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:44.120
you would go through all the expense of making leaders of the same sequence so that you could

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.720
put it in places and make sure that the molecular biology was solid to make sure that the Suhomish

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:59.000
man could be cultured from don't you see Andy I'm trying to teach you I was trying to teach you

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
for two or three years already just like I've been trying to teach everybody else RNA can't

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:12.680
pandemic but they can make it DNA they can make it PCR works

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.320
it's the fidelity they've lied about it's the signal background that they've lied about it's the

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:28.200
it's the it's the absolutely it is the isolation of viruses from the wild that they've lied about

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:34.760
it is absolutely the cardinal primary weakness of this biological field is that there is no

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.080
laboratory model of a cultured virus that grows and and evolves in the in the laboratory that

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:47.080
doesn't happen the only way they can pretend that happens is if they start with an infectious

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:54.120
clone and then lie about their experimental results or or hand wave over them and that's why the

01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:00.120
plaque assay and the cell culture for psychopathic effects are still standard methodologies

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:08.920
and I totally agree with them but that bearded genius over there could say infectious clones

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:15.720
three times in a row and for some reason not realize that I was trying to give it to them I was trying

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:21.400
to unite us on this idea that there was a collective agreement to lie about the fidelity of RNA

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:27.880
virology and then infectious clones was the opposite side of that coin and then explaining

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:33.000
to people that RNA doesn't have the fidelity that suggests pandemic that could even support an

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.960
epidemic that that anytime they ever been able to trace it they got 27 kids in the Netherlands

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.920
I would have been on their team I would have been full full bore on I would have bought the shirt

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:50.840
and everything but instead what happened this study something else in order to learn about

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:56.920
a different thing. Tom go ahead. Yeah and I forgot to say this in the beginning but I did

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:03.640
I did take the opportunity to ask Dr. Cooley to appear with us on this little program and

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:08.680
apparently he declined because I didn't hear from him and I asked him because he's talking

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:14.600
about coronaviruses and he's talking about infectious clones but let's focus on coronaviruses and

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:20.840
the issue that he's we're having here is Duke. Let's focus on coronaviruses right because we

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:27.080
don't want to understand what Dr. Cooley is saying we want to obfuscate it and we want to stay focused

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:34.200
on the definition of coronaviruses and isolation and purification of them even though I'm telling

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:41.880
them in the video that they can't do that that the way they skirt that small problem is that they

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:46.680
make an infectious clone a DNA copy of it then they can make enough RNA so that they get a regular

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:52.440
repeatable sideopathic effect they get a regular repeatable RNA sequence signal that they can find

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:59.720
and they can hand wave over and say see there's viruses never mind that we started with a cDNA

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:05.320
clone and a pure quantity of RNA that doesn't and can't exist in the wild never mind that

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:13.800
I was given it to them I was begging them to take it and run and they instead shoved it in my face

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:19.240
as if they couldn't understand Mark Bailey didn't get it Andrew Kaufman didn't get it

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.000
Zach doesn't get it Massey doesn't get it common Cowan doesn't get it they all what did times say

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.120
let's not think about infectious clones let's stay focused on coronaviruses this little program

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:36.200
and apparently you declined because I you don't need to go to the expense and the effort and time

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:41.320
to make a synthetic version of it it just doesn't make sense that you would study something else

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:47.720
in order to learn about a different thing Tom go ahead yeah and I forgot to say this in the

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:54.520
beginning but I did I did take the opportunity to ask Dr. Cooley to appear with us on this little

01:45:54.520 --> 01:46:00.280
program and apparently he declined because I didn't hear from him and I asked him because he's

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.040
talking about coronaviruses and he's talking about infectious clones but let's focus on coronaviruses

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:13.800
and the issue that he's we're having here is do coronaviruses exist so I asked for a paper

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:19.480
that demonstrated that the these coronaviruses exist and then we could look at the methodology

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:26.920
and that is what I was talking about the frustration part and what Andy was of course my answer was

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.880
no but I can encourage you to look up infectious clones so you can understand how they've lied about

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:39.640
it it's the same thing that that uh that that character Eric Capilino did to me earlier in the

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:45.560
same year okay well after we get off the show can you provide me with papers I'm like I don't

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.160
need to give you any papers just put infectious clones into PubMed and read

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.960
which one do you want to start with wouldn't it be more important and more

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.400
impressive to you if it was that simple that you could just put the words infectious clones into

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:04.280
PubMed and start reading the free papers you could figure out that they always have known this

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.600
and the people that aren't aware of it are just too naive to know

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.880
and there is no way in hell that Andy Kaufman just said infectious clones like three times and

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:21.000
and they all all said it and they don't understand that I was giving it to him that I was agreeing

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.920
with them that I was trying to show them how all of us could be right referring to let's first go

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:34.120
very systematically they say that they proved a corrupt any lab that made the mRNA vaccine could

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:40.440
make infectious clones any lab that makes proteins like antibodies could make the infectious

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:45.640
clone because in order to make proteins you use process two which is a recombinant

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:55.160
E. coli culture that's replicating a DNA plasmid of your own design all protein biologics are made

01:47:55.160 --> 01:48:00.120
this way therefore all of these pharmaceutical companies that were already making these these

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:06.600
antibodies could have easily shifted their equipment over to making RNA and DNA absolutely

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.640
and Mark put it in the chat already Inovio was doing it on BBC in January and they were growing

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.960
the DNA of the spike it's just it's just bigger plasmids and remember when I say infectious clones

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:24.280
what I'm really saying is a very broad thing I'm not suggesting to you that the only solution to

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:29.960
this issue in the only answer to the question of what how to was the crime done is that they

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:37.080
made a five segmented uh infectious clone and then they released it on the world and then the

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:44.120
infectious clone went around the world by itself they only needed to make the RNA or the DNA that

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.000
they were going to test for in any particular place let me just give you a hypothetical example

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.040
so that you can see how wicked and benevolent this lyset could have been if in the United States

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.000
they decided to emphasize PCR testing to the spike and to the end protein then they could have

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:08.200
used small small RNAs they could have used spike protein and end protein RNAs to transfect a few

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:15.800
people so that that signal would show up they could have also already characterized the background

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:22.120
signals of spike proteins and end proteins or whatever those amplicons are actually because

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:28.600
again with regard to this these people could be right maybe there are no uh exogenous viruses

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:33.720
maybe there are only endogenous ones and so they're identifying conserved pieces of exosomes

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.600
that all of our our bodies emit and they've misconstrued that as a real signal but the one

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:47.960
problem here is to assume that it's only overcycling of a PCR tester it's only bad primers of a PCR

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:54.200
test because one of the mysteries that needs to be unraveled and one of the the illusions that

01:49:54.200 --> 01:50:00.200
needs to be broken is that PCR is all the same level of fidelity and it's not it takes skill it takes

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:08.520
it takes um it takes a good degree of troubleshooting before you have a PCR test that is adequate enough

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:13.800
and foolproof enough to prove something in an academic setting if you want to show that a

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.360
particular protein is present in a particular subset of neurons in the brain you're going to

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.520
need a whole hell of a lot than a couple pair of primers for a couple pair of the subunits

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.040
that's not going to cut it you're also going to have to demonstrate with high fidelity that this

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:34.680
these tools are specific and that the signal is specific and that the negative controls and

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:40.840
positive controls that you have done are sufficiently valid and none of those were none of those

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:46.840
things were done if you look at any EUA for any PCR test that was ever rolled out in the United

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:56.600
States or in Canada or anywhere else none of the standard levels of of standard levels of quality

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:01.800
control or let's say just standard levels of fidelity were used everybody at the academic bench

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:10.680
assumes that there were at least nested primers used and so it's amazing to me that

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:17.240
still none of these people have gotten sophisticated enough to at least address this issue that

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:21.800
molecular biology isn't all fake everything that Kevin McCurnan does isn't fake

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.240
and so you've got to have a more nuanced position than they're just lying about all this stuff and I

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:34.920
think that's where when you give them the story of infectious clones when you tell them that look

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.560
there's thousands of papers out there they all are admissions that the only way this works the

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.720
easiest way this works the replicable way that's works the way that they can repeat it and share

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:50.360
it is if they start with a copy and because we've had the technology to make lots of copies of DNA

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:58.440
and RNA for a while then it seems really weird that in all their focus on isolation and and

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:04.840
purification they they haven't gone so far as to say so to overcome these incredible shortcomings

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.960
they've lied to you about virology by using basic recombinant methods and transfecting

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:16.040
cell cultures and telling you that's evidence of a virus all of the tools all of the language

01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:22.680
all of the previous products all of the previous experiments all of the anecdotal evidence from

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.920
other fields is all there they could tie it all together and then top it off with the cherry

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.720
so in order for you to buy this lie they murdered people in New York City but instead

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:35.800
we're still talking about coronavirus isolation in culture.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:42.200
Coronavirus exists because of electron microscope pictures and I know Mark is a real expert on this

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:48.360
and through a psychopathic effect in a cell culture and we're saying neither of those actually

01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:55.640
demonstrate the existence of a coronavirus therefore if there's no coronavirus then all this stuff about

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:59.160
weaponizing and cloning and all this is based on nothing.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:08.120
I have a quick little side there just for clarification on another video he talked about how his

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.960
thoughts are that the creation of this RNA infectious clone of SARS-CoV-2 and of other viruses

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:26.600
is the more likely culprit for what may have either accidentally or purposefully been released

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:32.120
from a lab that's that's his idea is that is that an RNA infectious clone? No it's so that's

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.760
that's unfortunate we were to make a call. That's unfortunate because that's not what I was saying

01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:41.480
and I think it's a it's a purposeful distortion I was already saying that the only way they could

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:48.200
do it is with quantity. You saw it in the email the email also said it very clearly that furthermore

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.760
synthetic of biology however even then it would only be in a pure quantity that any such agent

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.000
would pose a potential threat to thousands of people so they needed to make a pure quantity

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.400
in leaders. I said it in that our in that email they have transcripts of my shows so don't tell

01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.280
me they don't know that I don't believe that as infectious clone could go around the world like

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:14.200
Charles Rixi and Kevin McCarran think it can like Kevin McCernan also thinks it can.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:25.160
Phone of you we would have to start with you right. We know you exist and you're not a clone

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.600
at present right you're the original. I have a belly button so I'd say so that's a little joke

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.880
but yes here it comes. Right so if if there are clones of this thing then where where's the original

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.880
so we can see it and compare the clone to the original. Oh is that the shittiest argument

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:43.560
you've ever heard? Where's the original? How does that prove that clones couldn't be used?

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.200
How's that prove that clones couldn't be used to sequence to see the sequence? How does that

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:53.880
prove that that clones couldn't be used to lie about virology to create the reproducible

01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:01.400
the reproducible cytopathic effects the reproducible RNA signal how is it possible that you can't

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:07.320
possibly believe he doesn't get it and you can't possibly believe that he believes this is a valid

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.400
argument there would if they can make infectious clones then where's the original one?

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:16.440
The original one doesn't matter if they can make infectious clones and lie about it Andy Kaufman

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.520
holy crap you can't be that dumb. See that they're the same. Well and then to build off of that too

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.200
right that would imply that the clone is what has proliferated amongst the human population and

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.480
again where is the evidence for that clone existing inside the human population the same applies for

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:39.080
finding the alleged pathogenic particle and no it is not the argument I'm making I'm making that

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:45.160
all they had to do is put that clone in the Sohomish County man and have those those duped

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:53.240
people on the PBS news hours swab his his thing and find that sequence when they sent it away and

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.040
how would we know they sent the sequence away to Ditra they didn't even do it on site

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:08.200
so Ditra told them that he was positive we could have been allies for a year already we could have

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:14.120
been shredding for a year already alongside CHD and we could have all been working together to

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:22.360
dispel this myth of virology fidelity and of vaccine effectiveness and we're still not look how close

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:31.560
we were look how close we were inside of a human being or inside of a human being's fluid

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:38.680
or tissue right exactly like it I asked him to show us a paper proving the existence demonstrating

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:45.080
the existence of this SARS-CoV-2 whatever it is infectious clone natural particle lab created

01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:51.400
I asked the same question of everybody who's claiming lab created virus show me the virus

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:58.520
show me the methodology in the paper which has to be a cell culture because that's how they say

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:04.600
you isolate the virus and they it's also how they produce viruses see that's the problem they're

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:11.480
just dropping that ball I said it just go google it just PubMed it then look at those papers and see

01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:16.920
that they put a cDNA on a cell culture then they take the supernatant off and they say they have

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.120
viruses that's what an infectious clone is and you could have you could have dunked on it

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.160
don't have it or if you look at the cell culture they don't have an independent variable they don't

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.040
do it with the virus or without because they say they can't find the virus so there's no science

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.400
there yeah the important point here is that they'll come up with a bunch of excuses for why they

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:44.920
have to use the cell culture to isolate viruses so setting aside the discussion on the scientific

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.040
method which it's very clear in order to begin experimentation you need to have your thing you

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.320
think is the cause the presumed cause the independent variable it has to exist you have to show it

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.400
it has to be natural observation there can't be any manipulation of the investigator you have

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.400
to have the thing you think is the cause existing before you can even proceed with the experiment

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:06.520
if this is the worst case scenario that they were releasing a clone or clones they might have

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:14.200
released a very different one in Iran that they either expected to do more damage but if you

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:21.480
realize that a clone is not going to spread but could cause inflammation or whatever else their

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:29.400
designer protein does like if they transfected people with an aerosolized RNA that encoded a

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:35.480
staphylococcan and teratoxin B protein and some people inhaled that RNA and some people's

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:42.760
endothelial cells started expressing staphylococcan and teratoxin B you could have some very serious

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:47.000
shit happen but it wouldn't be that they would start coughing it out and then it would spread

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:53.080
all around the world and RNA virologists know that because it doesn't also spread around their

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:57.480
whole laboratory when they start with clones they can't start with clones and now they have a

01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:02.680
sustainable culture that's not how it works they always have to go back to the clones to start

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.360
that's what i've been trying to share

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:14.200
there is no perpetual baking in virology you either need to go back and swab another animal for a

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:20.120
few experiments or you need to go back to the DNA replicate in order for a few more experiments to

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:25.960
happen and there is no way in hell you can lead me to believe or convince me that these people

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:30.520
don't understand that's the point i was making in that email and in the streams that i was already

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:37.320
doing at this time it's just it's just absurd they are defending their own viewers from

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:42.360
understanding the subtleties of how shitty their argument is but they'll come up with a bunch of

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:48.840
excuses for why they cannot follow or strictly adhere to the scientific method and again in terms

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.520
of logic those are all reification policies they assign characteristics to viruses they say that

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.480
a virus is too weak to isolate or purify directly from the fluids they say that there's not enough

01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:00.840
of it present inside the fluids they're assigning characteristics to something a real virologists

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:07.240
are not me i have accepted all those lies and interpreted it as they are lying about infectious

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:12.680
clones as the evidence that the other stuff is real and they're pretending that they don't

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:18.200
understand purification fallacy uh that is abstract that has not been proven to actually exist in

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:25.800
nature can i um add um electust on top of the comment so far with regard to what dr coe said

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.920
there as well along with the problem of the fact that why don't you just um yeah get the virus

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:36.280
directly and deal with that but he said that they create infectious cDNA clones of these

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:41.880
alleged viruses now Sam and i together with Tom we actually addressed this in a recent video

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.760
and went over a Ralph Barrick paper that alleged to have created one of these infectious clones and

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.240
the word infectious should not be used in there at all because at no stage did they demonstrate

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.760
that what they had created i totally agree i totally agree but we have to use the terminology

02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:02.840
that's there and so for now if you want to identify the methodology that is misconstrued has been

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:08.760
misconstrued as representing high fidelity RNA virology the words are infectious clones that's

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:15.000
what you should search for you want to argue that infectious clones is a stupid name for a dna clone

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:22.040
i totally agree mark and the cell culture bro had any capacity to infect anything or cause

02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:26.360
disease essentially they were doing the usual track what we should call them is transfection

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.600
clones that's what we should call them because that's what they're doing they're

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.800
transfecting the cell culture with the dna or an RNA that they've made and then they're either

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:41.720
driving it in with electroporation or they're driving it in with with uh some lip effectamine

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:47.000
or something like that and then the result that comes out whatever those cells do with it whatever

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.520
they secrete is considered viruses and they don't do any more analysis than that and i totally agree

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.520
with him but what i'm trying to point out is that every time they use that cell culture to generate

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:05.000
viruses they start with a cDNA clone in any of these papers and that cDNA clone is then termed

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.800
an infectious clone because they like that word and i totally agree infectious doesn't belong in

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:15.320
there but look how far we could have been if they would have just cooperated instead of tried to

02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:23.160
dunk and slam and and slander me chd and the no virus people could have been one collective

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:30.680
anti public health anti vaccine movement in 2000 the beginning of 2023 but instead

02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:38.280
it's still completely fractured and chd is still talking about gain of function and still talking

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:44.120
about lab leak and still talking about ibermectin and still hasn't changed their understanding

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:54.520
because they're still there and these people are still no virus isolation purification hamster

02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:00.600
wheel and can't come up with any way to get farther you know like saying they lied about viruses

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:06.920
isolation and purification is nonsense and it's such an important mythology to protect they were

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:13.240
willing to kill people in new york city and kill people in bergamole and kill people in iran and

02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:19.960
lie about why they died and they were even willing to put in a signal using rna and dna and the sewers

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.520
and stuff to make us really convinced and dr cooley has found this really interesting

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:32.360
uh glitch in rna virology and it appears to be that there are some very basic molecular biology

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:38.040
that they techniques that they could have used to plant the signal and so whether it's a background

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.400
signal that exists or not whether it's viruses or exosomes or not they have the means to have

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:48.360
contaminated the background they have the means to have seeded the narrative of a contaminated

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:53.320
background they have the means of how seeding a narrative of a mass casualty event in new york

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:59.560
city and then misconstruing that has spread and so there's so much evidence that there was no virus

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:05.400
that it would seem almost illogical to spend years exclusively focused on isolation and

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:12.280
purification wouldn't it? So proxy techniques of just detecting sequences which they put in

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:15.960
and then detected them again later and claimed that they had something that was replicating and

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:20.600
virus like in nature so again it's problematic and i agree with the others that um

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.840
when dr cooley is talking about these things he slips in the word coronavirus

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.840
as though these things have been shown to exist and all of the investigations that i've done

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:36.120
dating back to alleged infectious bronchitis virus which was the supposed first coronavirus

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:41.640
to be isolated back in the 1930s at no stage did any of these researchers demonstrate that they

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:46.600
had a particle that fulfilled the description of a virus and i think this is we have mentioned

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:51.640
this and i'll say it again and i think dr cooley is missing this we point out that the methodology

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:57.160
that has been used for over 100 years and the virology is not sufficient to make the claim

02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:05.000
and i'm not missing it and i wasn't missing it then i was trying to put out a message

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:10.280
that the most people could understand even academic biologists could understand

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:18.920
that that would be a bridge to their skilled tv watching and skilled social media understanding

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:25.080
to a place where they could question the right things question the right assumptions

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:33.960
and it is really disappointing to to realize that you know we could have been in such a different

02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:41.640
place more than a year ago had had anybody reached out in a normal way had anyone been able to say

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:51.480
hey you're almost there but what about this just insults and and and more insults no respect

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:58.680
no nod of wow he's almost there that's the part that i just find so sad is that they could have

02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:04.920
they could have seen that i was almost there and instead they tried to push me as far

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:11.800
as they could that they've made and the other problem was that the hypothesis of viruses

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:16.760
was it was put forward before they found them and of course we know now they can't find them

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:24.120
and since that time every every observation they make whether it be a PCR and genomic sequence

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.800
uh electron microscopy appearances is now just used to try and fit this model which has been

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:35.800
you know proven false over and over again the other thing he talks about there is he says the word

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:40.440
legitimate sequence and i'm not quite sure what he means by legitimate sequence because

02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:46.440
again we're not saying that biological material doesn't have various genetic sequences and proteins

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:51.800
etc what we're saying problem is is that they're being attributed to viruses when there's no proof

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:56.200
that this is where they've come from so it's a provenance issue so i agree with that too and it's

02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:04.440
weird because when mark talks it's fine when mark speaks it's totally on point when mark debated

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:10.520
kevin mccaren on tim's truth's podcast the only thing kevin mccaren could do was yell and scream

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:18.040
um he made a right fool of himself those few years ago and i do think that mark bailey might be

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:24.680
the one that needed the most control the the one message that needed to be have somebody else

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:31.480
standing in front of him and so they amplified his wife they amplified um Andy Kaufmann and tom

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:40.280
kawen and it it it will never leave the front of my mind that in march of 2020 the first time i heard

02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:46.200
Andy Kaufmann's name was when it was repeated over and over weekend after weekend by kevin

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:52.680
mccaren on the streams that i was doing with him and paul katrel and adi ads in march in april of

02:07:52.680 --> 02:08:00.920
2020 um these people were put in place ladies and gentlemen they were put in a place to occupy

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:07.800
space and to help curate a limited spectrum of debate within which within which most of us are

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:16.680
still trapped and we could hear from tom kawen's interview yesterday or from his q&a stream yesterday

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:27.480
that we watched that while he's very capable in 2024 of enunciating how uh malevolently the idea of

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:34.120
early treatment was used as a way of manipulating people's understanding and making people accept

02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:41.240
that there was a novel virus but then in the exact same 20 minutes was able to say that there are no

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:46.520
ion channels there are there nothing about what we understand about membrane physiology is true

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:52.280
then in another minute he was able to say that we are electrochemical beings that vibrate or something

02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:01.880
and so i have identified these people over and over again as people who who take good ideas like

02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.280
what mark bailey has spent a lot of time writing up in farewell to virology and distorting them and

02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:18.200
and and obfuscating those rather clear ideas behind things like water memory and you know

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:26.040
whatever magic karma fields replace our understanding of memory and physiology and tom kawen's mind

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:33.080
you know water memory where it freezes pictures of emotions these things are all taken very

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:38.600
seriously but virology boy i can tell you all the stuff that's wrong with virology but this

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:44.360
rest of this stuff i'll far be it from me to question any of that stuff and that stance just

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:51.560
doesn't cut it with me that stance belies i don't know what else to say but somebody on this team

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:58.040
or somebody behind them is a consistent liar spectacularly committed to it too and we get this

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.920
argument all the time saying people will say well i've looked at g said and they've found this virus

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:08.600
sequence 14 million times and the problem is is that they're using the same technique or similar

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.840
techniques around the world and it's the technique that is the problem okay so if it's the technique

02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:18.040
that's the problem mark i just want you to imagine where they took this imperfect technique and they

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:24.680
tested it out for about a year so that they knew what this perfect imperfect technique would produce

02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:31.320
and after they had a pretty consistent signal with this imperfect technique then they rolled it out

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:37.400
as a test in the context of a novel virus spreading they created a mass casualty event in a few places

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:43.320
in the world and then they lied about it for consistently for three years and there are

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:49.400
methodological ways that they could have seeded the the molecular data to make it really hard to

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:57.800
disbelieve it's just very frustrating that they don't seem to be able to get there to show

02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.080
and we get this argument all the time saying people will say well i've looked at g said and

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:09.800
they've found this virus sequence 14 million times imagine the scenario where that is the background

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:17.800
mark whatever that is whatever they've exaggerated there there is a background signal and on that

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:24.200
background noise they have already characterized the results of these bullshit tests and whatever

02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:34.840
that characterized result is has been misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen i wanted to be on

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:41.240
your team man years ago that's why i reached out to your wife before your last kid was born

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:48.040
don't tell me you don't know that and don't tell me you don't know that i was trying to bridge

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:54.120
this gap trying to give subtle nuance to this argument and don't tell me you don't understand

02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.080
it because i know one or more of these people definitely does the problem is is that they're

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.920
using the same technique or similar techniques around the world and it's the technique that is

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:08.440
the problem not the results i mean we know that virology generates in an ordinary amount of data

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:11.960
it's a huge amount of data and some people think because there's a lot of data

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:16.040
it means that it must be real again what we're saying is yes they have a lot of data but i've

02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:22.840
interpreted it completely and correctly yes so mark bailey can say it now all you have to do is

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:29.080
jump to the conclusion that so in order to bamboozle us about messing around with self-replicating

02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.440
RNAs they just told us this story about pandemic viruses and they're making these infectious clones

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:41.400
and testing this transfection shit in laboratories for years and lying to us about it yes yes mark

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:45.320
holy cow yes you we could have been there three years ago

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:55.160
it wasn't for kevin mccairn and and richard flemming and charles rixie and and james lion's

02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:01.160
weiler and the whole group of drastic and all andi koffman could talk about was isolation and

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:08.040
purification all tom kowin could talk about was isolation and that's why we're here and why we

02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:15.640
didn't get here in 2021 or even earlier because of people like bret weinstein and robert melone

02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:22.120
and steve kirsch and all of them sticking to their own little part of the train the illusion that

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:28.760
we're stopping it and it does not support the hypothesis that viruses exist

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:35.400
okay we're gonna move on our kevin mccairn and kevin mccairn on the same page sort of

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:42.040
well that's a funny ask question to ask in the chat they're not on the same page sort of they're

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:51.080
on the same page actually um and that would be uh where is it

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:58.200
i have it here somewhere i put it in my list um

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:08.680
where did i put it in my list but uh there is a there's a life site news article where a video

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:16.360
of kevin mccairn is featured right alongside quotes from kevin mccairn and actually that life

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:23.400
science life site news article was also reposted by none other than murkola

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:31.160
yes they are on the same page absolutely they are um and i just i really thought i had that link

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.200
but i guess i'm not seeing it with my eyeballs here but i know i've got it somewhere

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:47.800
why don't i see it here i'm sure i kept it it's just a really long list of stuff to work on here

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:55.320
guys so i apologize for that um yeah but anyway they were definitely on the same page um they were

02:14:55.320 --> 02:15:01.240
promoted by uh joe murkola the other day like a video from kevin mccairn

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:09.720
um and a quote from kevin mccairn and all about prions and and and double-stranded dna

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:15.320
contamination the exact you know scooby-doo narrative that was seated already at the beginning of the

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:21.160
pandemic by by kevin mccairn himself and i don't know if he knew what he was doing but when he said

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:27.560
that a billion people could die in march of 2020 um i don't think that was just him you know waxing

02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.360
intellectual i think he was encouraged to say those things just like uh paul cotrell was

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:39.000
encouraged to do what he did and i don't know exactly what their role was but uh i think it was all

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:46.120
one giant performance and remains so um there's no way that somebody says worst-case scenario for

02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:52.360
so long with so much certainty that a spike protein is this and a spike protein is that um and those

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:57.080
terms haven't changed in four years there's been no change in the team worst-case scenario

02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:02.360
outlook on things since the beginning of the pandemic and there's been no change in the no

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:08.360
virus people's outlook since the beginning of the pandemic no additional arguments to be made no

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.880
no bigger pictures or better elevator pitches no improvement just worst-case scenario we're

02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:18.600
gonna have a prion disease and amyloidosis everywhere and it's already evident because it

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:23.160
was a gain of function virus that was released from a laboratory it is the most infectious virus

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:30.120
we've ever had or there are just no viruses no viruses no viruses no viruses no viruses and

02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:36.520
he's mistaken and infectious clones i don't it doesn't really matter just like kevin mccain

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:41.000
and charles rixie said that infectious clones didn't matter for about three quarters of a year

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.880
before they decided that they did and that the original release was a clone of course it was

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.480
and clones spread great because you know when you put fear and cleavage sites in them they do

02:16:49.480 --> 02:17:04.360
wonderful things into this next clip from jj what's not possible is that all these people were

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:07.320
were finding infectious RNA and lying about it

02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:15.560
that's not possible i'm sorry to break your bubble but that's not possible they could be

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:18.600
misinterpreting the data they could be misinterpreting what they were observing they could be

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:26.440
misunderstanding what was replicating there's lots of possibilities but what's not possible is that

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:33.000
all this biology can just be dismissed and and is not in need of an alternative explanation christine

02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:39.160
and that's the problem with stopping at freedom of information request responses that say we

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:45.960
didn't isolate or purify the virus and then saying we win la la la i can't hear you write it down and

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:53.320
maybe i'll read it while her response is well i just asked them and they said no so you have to

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.200
prove that there are viruses i don't need to prove anything there's 40 years of molecular

02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.960
biological data which indicates that RNA can be infectious can replicate itself seems to move

02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:08.440
around maybe it's an endogenous signal maybe it's an immune response maybe it's something else

02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:13.640
that we haven't characterized yet correctly but it's not nothing these sequences that people

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:20.760
are finding are not nothing okay response can i just jump in there Alec because it actually followed

02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:26.200
from what i was just saying yeah it's yeah as i was pointing out in my previous comment it's

02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:31.160
not the problem that virology hasn't generated a lot of data and Dr kiwi's holding up a book i

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:36.200
probably from the 1980s i think based on the rest of his interview there and yes i have

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:41.960
looked back even further back with regards to quote coronaviruses um now in the 1980s that was

02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.840
when they said they first sequenced again it was infectious bronchitis virus and quotes that they

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:52.040
said was the first coronavirus to have the bull genetic sequence what part of what i just said

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:58.840
is not agreeing with him what part of i just said is not fully on board with what they're saying

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:03.240
it's somehow or another they are struggling to make a difference between what i said and what

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:09.400
they're saying it's extraordinary that's bad the problem again is is not that there wasn't a lot

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:14.600
of papers because it is likewise but um salmon i did an extensive investigation into the common

02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:20.920
cold unit which operated i believe from 1946 through to about 1989 and they generated over a

02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:26.680
thousand papers scientific papers uh allegedly regarding human human coronaviruses and

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.800
rhinoviruses etc so yeah we've looked and so again i'm suggesting that those observations

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:37.000
need to be revisited i'm not just saying they're all nonsense and yet somehow or another he doesn't

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.360
seem to hear it through many many of these papers and as i say by the time they got to the 80s when

02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:47.640
they were doing more sequencing they said that hey this is the the genome of these illid viruses but

02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.400
i went back and very carefully went through those papers to see what they actually did and

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:59.880
there's some pivotal papers around 1984 through the 1987 where they claimed that they had purified

02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:04.520
variants and then they said that they sequenced the genetic sequence from these purified variants

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:09.640
but there was nowhere in those papers where they showed that they purified anything they simply

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:14.840
had chick embryo cultures and were introducing foreign material and on the basis that they were

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:19.880
seeing tissue damage in the form of sideopathic effects and plaques they said that there must

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.600
be a viral agent prison but they didn't purify anything and they certainly didn't show that

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:30.040
the genetic material was coming from inside any quite virus particles so we're still talking about

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:35.560
the methodologies that i've already agreed in email and on multiple videos are not high fidelity

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:41.080
they are not real they are nonsense and infectious clones is the way that they fake it works i've

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:47.080
said it i've already said it i wrote it down and they seem to ignore it they play the clips where

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:51.720
i say it and then they i guess they're they're trying to convince their viewers that i didn't

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:57.400
say what i just said the other thing which we've pointed out over and over again is that not once

02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:03.160
did they do a control experiment to see whether they could find the sequences in other samples or

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:10.360
other cultures so again i think um yep we agree with dr kui that there's a huge amount of information

02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:16.360
data etc and he he even said himself maybe the whole thing's been misinterpreted and i'd say

02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:22.440
yes it has there are other explanations for these findings and uh that's uh it's it's pretty

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:27.160
straightforward really it's pretty straightforward really so then why were you being dicks for four

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:35.000
hours why for four weeks it's pretty straightforward why would we need to make an infectious clone if

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.440
the original thing exists and then they can't dunk on me with that one they can't say oh wow there

02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:46.280
you go no they had to completely obfuscate it and now they're still obfuscating it how easy would it

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:55.560
have been i was asking them to to come on board and use what i know uh uh against me another important

02:21:55.560 --> 02:22:01.160
point there too is that what he's implying is that we're all of us in the so-called no virus

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:06.600
camper saying that all of the virologists epidemiologists immunologist whatever

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:11.000
ologist you want to throw it in there are all lying that's not what we're saying i don't think

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.320
any of us are saying that we're saying exactly what he said is that they're likely misinterpreting

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:21.240
it or there's something else at play we don't think that there is this and maybe i'm speaking for

02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:25.000
myself here feel free to correct me if any one of you disagrees but we don't think that there is

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.200
this you know dark occult group that comprises all virologists in the world and all experts in

02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:33.240
the world that secretly meets and they're all keeping the true information from us

02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:39.240
overwhelmingly they're just misinterpreting the results of the experiments that they've been taught

02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:44.760
they're using infectious clones and they don't understand

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:53.800
i explained it and you and your friends are purposefully ignoring that i gave you the touchdown

02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:59.240
yeah and you know with all these admissions that Professor Cooley is making

02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.680
he's basically admitting that they haven't used scientific method because if they had then there

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:14.600
wouldn't be room he's basically admitting he's basically admitting still trying to misconstrue

02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:20.680
me as someone who's obfuscating the truth or trying to mislead people this is just shitty

02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:27.000
i'm sorry but this is just this is just sad and don't forget that she's a Canadian she's not an

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:33.640
American so as far as i'm concerned if you're Canadian and you're you're meddling in America

02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:39.720
then it's already weird because you guys have your shit in in a bundle right now you have almost

02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:45.400
no human rights left it seems to me that you better focus more on your own shit and pull your own

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:50.920
head out then worry about some American down here working for CHD for all this misinterpretation

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:55.560
so it's it's like on the one hand he's agreeing with us and then at the same time he's upset with

02:23:55.560 --> 02:24:00.840
us because we're i guess he thinks we're misleading people we're jumping to conclusions yes you are

02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:05.720
misleading people because you're not talking about the murder you're misleading people because you're

02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:12.040
not talking about there is a way for them to lie about it so that potentially thousands of academic

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:17.160
biologists can have a light bulb go on in their head but instead every one of these people is

02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:23.720
essentially responsible for that not happening um so i just find that a little it's a little

02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.880
confusing again and it would have been nice if he had agreed to come on and talk to us because

02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:32.120
then maybe we could have sorted all these things out and perhaps one day in the future he will agree

02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:38.120
to some sort of a discussion with us also um he's implying i might have said this earlier but um

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.640
uh forgive me if i did already but he's he's implying that all we have is the freedom of

02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:50.600
information responses and they're very powerful and they show that they don't have um an independent

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:55.560
variable and so they're not using scientific method um but at the same time there's like this

02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:01.400
huge other body of work that um Andy and Tom and Alec and the bellies and other people as well

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.240
have done and there's this last amount of work Mike Stone many others

02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:11.880
Medler um it's just unfortunate if people are being misled if they're not that familiar with

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:16.840
no virus movement just a medler getting this impression from just a medler that um all we

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:23.320
have is the FOIs also i'd mention to that with regard to the FOIs most of them do focus on

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:29.480
the purification issue but we have quite a few others on um the issue of the so-called mop

02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:35.000
controls that are done in some studies we have um FOIs where we've just asked do you have any

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:41.800
records showing that scientific method was applied and SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exist we have um FOIs

02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:47.400
asking from different angles we also have um emails that some colleagues have done where they

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:51.720
write directly to study authors and they ask them questions for example there's been a lot of work

02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:58.760
done asking study authors if they used the type of controls where you um we know we know they never

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:02.600
fully control because they don't have purified particles but did you at least do the same

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:08.280
procedures for example the sequencing so many words that aren't infectious clones are a proxy

02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:15.000
so many words are infectious cl- are not infectious clones are a proxy which they played the clip

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:23.240
they heard me say it and they're still hammering thing did you do it but running the same procedure

02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.560
but with the sample from a healthy person or from someone with another disease and they they have

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:34.200
all said no so there's just this huge body of work that's been done and um so I hope

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:38.280
professor kui will come to understand that we're not just relying on FOIs but they are they are

02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:48.120
powerful on their own unbelievable tom go ahead yeah it seems to me the problem is um we're

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:55.480
actually asking the question is there evidence the virus exists and what you hear is going off

02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:01.480
into all kinds of tangents about well they misinterpret the data and and they've got 40 years

02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:08.360
of of information and it could be a you know an antibody response or something else but what

02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:13.240
happened to the i didn't say antibody response tom just to be sure we're clear the clips you

02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:17.960
played i don't say antibodies i've called out antibodies is bullshit from the beginning another

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:25.080
completely bad misrepresentation of my stance question is that in that book is there the methodology

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.680
that demonstrates the existence of the virus and if there is why didn't you read that section

02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:36.120
and say this is how it's scientifically valid and there should be no misinterpretation

02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:43.160
and i stand behind that as a scientist because that is the question we're dealing with no i just

02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.400
said it that they they've collected data that they don't understand that they misinterpret it maybe

02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:52.200
it's immune signal maybe it's an endogenous signal they don't know and they may have misinterpreted

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:57.640
and infectious clones may be the way that a couple generations of people have misinterpreted it

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:03.240
and i handed them the ball and all they had to do was take a step across the goal line and instead

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:07.400
like Lucy they picked up the ball and fumbled it they oh sorry

02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:17.560
and they're using this whole hour or hour and a half to explain to their viewers why they

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:24.680
shouldn't listen to me but could keep listening to them how incredible is that when i had every

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:32.360
intention of finally uniting chd and these people under the common rubric that they lied can you imagine

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:40.360
the kinds of malevolent forces that could potentially be involved that we got this close that email

02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:47.320
that Bobby Kennedy and and Mary asked me to write an email and i was allowed to write it and that

02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:56.920
was the email that i sent and this was what happened not how they misinterpreted it all this stuff

02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:02.040
that's got nothing to do with it stick with the question is are the points in a straight line or

02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:09.320
not don't go into what the paper is made of at all it's the exact scia don't ask any other questions

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:14.760
just ask the question that Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman want you to ask and they've been pulling

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:21.560
this shit for four years that's why when Andy Kaufman first started his work in 2020 he was

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.840
still able to use the word exosomes and why in this talk they haven't used the word once

02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:36.760
we've been played ladies and gentlemen and much more thoroughly than anyone wants to admit anyone

02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:44.840
wants to see oh but we have been played all the rest just stick with the question show us in that book

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:48.520
the methodology how they prove the virus it's not there

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:58.360
okay and now we will play the second to last clip from JJ here we go second to last

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:05.320
and decades of research are built on this proxy relationship between a DNA produced RNA infectious

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.120
clone of a coronavirus and the sequence is found in the wild

02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:13.960
and if he's not going to take the time to explain this subtlety and why that's significant in terms

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:18.600
of understanding what we know and not know about viruses and how we can learn from the new sequencing

02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:23.160
technology technologies that are out there then he's not really being he's talking about things

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:28.440
that were out there a long time ago technologies that have been used for decades on the bench okay

02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:32.280
there aren't technologies that have been used for decades on the bench in virology that are

02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:36.920
applicable to these problems that he's trying to address because for the last 20 years

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:40.440
the virology has been an indirect study of things that we can't really prove are there

02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:46.440
well i'll just point out that at the very end there jay agree with us on the last 20 years of

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:51.960
virology saying that it's all going oh and it's so cute as if you don't realize like i'm they're

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:57.960
making fun of me as though i'm unaware that i admitted it i'm unaware oh it's so cute at the

02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:04.120
last clip there he admits that he agrees with us i want to give you some kind of gesture at this

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:11.160
point because it's just so disingenuous to say that you didn't know that i agreed with you from the

02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:20.440
email that i wrote and i need people to understand that we have been played by these liars and they

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:25.080
are going to continue to agree that they didn't get it they're going to continue to agree that they

02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:31.000
didn't understand what i was trying to do even chd some members of that crew are going to keep

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:36.280
agreeing that they didn't understand what i was offering them that i didn't that i wasn't clear

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:41.880
enough as to what infectious clones meant for understanding what really goes on i explained

02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:50.040
this to the people that wrote the wuhan cover up book and it didn't change the book because the

02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:54.600
book was supposed to be a historical document about what people claimed and what people said and so

02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:58.360
i was allowed to add a quote which said they didn't even need a virus to do this

02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:03.400
i was allowed to add papers that showed it i was allowed to explain what infectious clones were

02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:07.640
and how they are a proxy for something they can't otherwise do with any methodologies that are

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:17.800
reproducible and it's all in the book too and so they're pretending and they keep pretending

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:21.960
that i either don't exist or that what i'm saying is not what i'm saying which is that they were

02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:28.360
right about virology they were right about specifically RNA virology of which the HIV is also

02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:38.440
an RNA virus and instead they spent this entire hour trying to obfuscate the fact that i wanted

02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:43.240
to agree with them that i was giving them the ball all they had to do was take the infectious

02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:47.960
clones and say see they can fake it and go across the finish line and then say hey and they probably

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:53.720
murdered people in america and that's further evidence that there's no virus but instead hamster

02:32:53.720 --> 02:33:00.760
wheel hamster wheel and based on indirect methods and on things that we can't even show exist so

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:06.520
again it's a little confusing because he's frustrated with us for throwing away all of virology but he's

02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:12.520
throwing away the last 20 years um and he goes on quite a bit in the rest of the video he talks about

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:16.840
how there's newer technologies and we're not sophisticated enough and we need to address all

02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:24.280
these new technologies and i would think if i use the new technologies to attack the infectious

02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:32.040
cycle and they're being disingenuous by not saying it here's another brilliant that talk that i gave

02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:37.320
there includes a part about clones and what they do for the infectious cycle they overcome this

02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:43.720
ridiculous inability to to culture things so listen again to what she just said about how there's

02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:49.240
newer technologies and the newer technologies are nanopore sequencing which they don't need to

02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:54.280
amplify anything they can just dump stuff through the pore and start sequencing it and so this would

02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:59.800
have been a great way for them to segue into saying that jonathan cooey has also demonstrated that

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:06.040
despite all of these new technologies virology hasn't bothered to adopt them

02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:15.080
virology is sticking with with with uh plaque assays and and and cell culture

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:21.080
psychopathic assays instead of moving on to these new things that's the point i'm making in that

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.800
video and they cut it really short so that i wouldn't clarify that point so that they wouldn't

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:29.560
you wouldn't hear it and they could just make a little cute statement about see he admits it

02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.800
that's how wicked and malevolent this little game is that they played for three years or four years

02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.360
and still playing now some of them are their handlers

02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:46.600
and they've almost ruined the lives of people you know lots of people in the world have lost

02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:54.040
time and energy in their hamster wheel and have never been told and shown that in order for this

02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:59.400
hamster wheel of virology to exist that people needed to be murdered that in fact they may be

02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:03.880
murdering people with the vaccine schedule since before the pandemic and lying about it

02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:09.720
for exactly the same reason to preserve this mythology but somehow or another map bailey and

02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:15.560
andie coughman and none of these people get there they never get there

02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:25.320
and so understand if you can't see this as a lie of omission over many years then i don't know how

02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:30.520
to help you we're not sophisticated enough and we need to address all these new technologies

02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:37.800
and i would think these new technologies are way for you to edify your own stance you bonehead

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.040
don't pretend like you didn't know that i was trying to help if we have all these wonderful

02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:48.120
new technologies that if anything the last 20 years would be the superior part of virology but

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:54.040
that's the part that he's throwing away so again it's a little a little confusing and i would argue

02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.920
there's no need to go into any complex details i mean regarding the sequencing techniques

02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.480
for sure it's interesting to some people and that's fine but when you realize that they never

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.960
purify particle and make sure that their genetic materials coming from that specific

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:12.120
particle instead they have a soup of millions of my voices that they detect in it i don't think

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:16.920
i'm losing my voice if i am i just yell too loud i apologize for the assembly on a computer they

02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:22.040
don't actually sequence something and then in some cases the way they do the the detection of the

02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:25.880
sequences they didn't even do it in a reliable manner because sometimes it involves PCR with

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:32.520
many cycles so like to me that's tells you everything you need to know it's there or just

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.480
the fact that they never purify tells you everything you need to know so disagree that we need to be

02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.400
super sophisticated and go into all sorts of extra details again it's fine for people who

02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.200
are interested in who have that knowledge but it's not necessary and yeah that's it

02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:55.080
no one else has another edit well i mean you know if we want to get into the thing about

02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:59.480
you know sequencing technology is also a it's just immaterial because whether it's

02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:03.960
sanger sequencing micro pore or next generation they they all give you a sequence of whatever

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.920
genetic material that you start with but that's not the problem the problem is that as mark always

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:12.360
points out you know we don't know the origin of any of those little genetic fragments that

02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.920
were sequencing so whether we know the sequence or not or what technology we use doesn't tell us

02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.880
the answer to that question is where do those sequences come no one's arguing with this no one's

02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:26.840
arguing i was never arguing with it they played clips where you can see it you've watched shows

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:33.160
for more than a year now where you can see it i'm arguing with the idea that they have they have

02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:39.880
bamboozled people into thinking there's no way that this could have been done there's no way that

02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.280
it could be more sophisticated than just what lying then they didn't murder anybody

02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:53.240
i'm from and if we can't demonstrate that they come from a novel virus then essentially then we

02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:57.240
have to do some more work to interpret if they have any meaningful interpretation at all

02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:03.480
yeah i would add to i think um like taunts suggested before dr kleen needs to specify

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:08.280
which part we've got wrong and i'm not sure that he's aware of the body of work that um

02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:14.680
the entire no virus um group had put together it's absolutely pathetic i'm sorry if if

02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:22.680
i'm gonna i'm just i think that this is just nonsense um it's a it's an act it's a pretend act

02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:27.320
mark may not know because these people may kept him out of the loop or encouraged him not to watch

02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:33.400
or something maybe he's too busy but if he'd have just done an objective look into who i was mark

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:37.720
would have reached out to me i think and said wow dude you're so close or wow interesting

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:44.120
but they don't want you to understand that pcr could be faked they don't want you to understand

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.200
that a background signal could be misconstrued as spread they don't want you to understand

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:53.320
all the different ways that they could be lying simultaneously what they want you to do is focus

02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:59.400
on one so that you never use the word murder they want you to focus on one so that you never

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:05.480
use the word lies have they ever said that they're lying about virology if they ever use the word

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:15.720
liar not just in the last two or three years but this is the states back to the 1990s with the

02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:23.160
Perth group etc and has really built up momentum perhaps in this COVID-19 era but yeah it's not a

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:27.240
it's not a technological issue different link has been really good at this too it's just pointing

02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:34.200
out that since the invention of the virus model it's refuted itself on its own terms so many times

02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:39.960
that it's amazing that it's still alive and so when you get better sequencing technologies and

02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:44.440
then virology doesn't use them isn't that kind of suspicious isn't that yet another

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.960
aspect of your story that i was handing to you on a silver platter that you're just

02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:56.040
misconstruing as something that i got wrong or don't understand that is just sad to me it's

02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:04.440
pathetic it's really it's really disturbing to see how insistent that they are somehow convinced

02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:10.600
that whatever words come out of my mouth i don't get it and even when i say it she makes cute like

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:18.920
i said it but i didn't get it on it's it's really impressive so i mean this dates back to experiments

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:23.160
with the veg tobacco mosaic virus you can see that they never established that anything was

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.760
capable of passing between the plants in the late 1800s um right through to to recently with

02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:34.520
the technology they're using today but the the issue is yeah like we say is is not whether you

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.880
can detect proteins and detect genetic sequences that that's all fine the issue is what it actually

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.640
means what's the relevance um and showing that it relates to so i'm saying that they can detect

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.840
sequences just like Mark Bailey and i'm suggesting that they have more than enough technology to put

02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:59.000
those sequences where they intended to find them and then a spectacular commitment to lying about

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:05.320
that would be a real good way to start a pandemic but you'd still need to kill people people still

02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:14.920
need to die and more than normal and so why do they spend so little time talking about that crucial

02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:20.280
aspect of this illusion you can't just lie to people about viruses if people also don't die

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:29.000
and yet somehow or another in three years they've never been able to just muster

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:35.320
up the courage to say this is how they did it it's not just faking methodologies they also have to

02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:45.400
fake results fake the results of lockdown fake the fidelity of of lockdown the signal was missing

02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:51.080
in australia until until their borders opened again is all part of the orchestration and there's

02:41:51.080 --> 02:42:02.280
lots of ways they could have done that but they could not have faked dying people i think they

02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.640
needed to do some pretty amazing magic tricks to fake dying people and so that's why they probably

02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:12.520
didn't fake dying all fake dying people there were probably a lot of people that were murdered in

02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:17.640
new york city and around the world murdered by ignorance murdered by unwilling part on

02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:22.760
winning participants that that that followed protocols because they were told

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:33.480
and so we don't need to discuss any of the the other aspects of the crime we just need to discuss

02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.680
the one aspect of the crime that is drunk driving doesn't exist

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:46.840
there's no way i know that doesn't exist there's no other way that this could have been perpetrated

02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:52.760
on us there's no other way that this could have been done it's just simply they they're all wrong

02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:58.360
all the way back to the 1800s whatever they were looking at is wrong okay so what's the explanation

02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:05.000
then and that's what we're doing and i think we're nailing it and that's why they had to ignore us

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.760
because it's not time for the truth to come out yet maybe the time to come out will be when

02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:16.520
robert f Kennedy jr is in his second term in my books out and then he hires me as some kind of

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:22.280
advisor and america has already divided into 50 separate states and our constitution has been dissolved

02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:28.840
maybe it's only after my family and i are forced to move to the netherlands and then when i'm over

02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:34.200
there somehow somebody finally acknowledges that oh it's probably just infectious clones

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.800
and then they lied about it probably just a background signal that they characterize before

02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:47.160
the pandemic and then released all the the phylogenetic stuff from ditro databases and said that they

02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:51.960
were sequencing stuff and then once the phylogeny was present then they can let everybody sequence

02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:53.800
the background and just drop it in who cares

02:43:53.800 --> 02:44:07.880
these alleged viruses i think you know the biggest problems for virology is that it's not even

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:12.600
consistent on its own terms and we've demonstrated this over and over again is that they can't

02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:18.680
demonstrate validity because they don't use the scientific method and as Andy pointed out before

02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:23.080
you need to do control experiments where you have independent variables and it's

02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:27.720
it's not just one thing like cell cultures where they're not doing controlled experiments it's

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:32.920
it's in everything and i mean some of the stuff that christine and her colleagues have got

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:38.520
directly from these researchers is just incredible and they basically admit that they don't do control

02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:43.560
experiments and some of them sort of on reflection say there's been a couple of really interesting

02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.200
ones where they've said well maybe we should have a good point so yeah i'm in the entire thing i'm

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:54.440
not um i think again someone like dr coe has to specify exactly which bit we've got wrong look

02:44:54.440 --> 02:45:01.000
at the smile on Andy Kaufman's face what is that smile being generated by what did he read or what

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:09.080
is he seeing here because in my mind mark bailey right now is engaging in in something like a lie

02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:16.280
because they played the clips multiple clips where i said that maybe it's an endogenous signal maybe

02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:19.160
it's an immune signal maybe they don't know what they're talking about maybe it's just

02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:24.200
misinterpreted data i don't even think they can isolate viruses i said it all and instead of saying

02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.320
wow he seems to agree with us on most of this stuff they make it seem to their they represent

02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:33.960
it to their viewers as though i don't get it and the caption of this video said that i didn't get

02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:42.680
it and that these guys have cleaned another clock i hope i'm not belaboring the point that

02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:47.880
we have been bamboozled by liars and i don't know where they are in this picture or if they're behind

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:54.760
it but i assure you that this insistence that the only thing we need to talk about is this one little

02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:01.480
hamster wheel we've been on for this entire hour without acknowledging the actual words in the

02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:07.240
clips that i that they played of me it's extraordinary instead of alleging that we don't have any material

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.440
or that we're relying completely on for our documentation etc because that's that's not where

02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:18.600
things are the worst thing my argument was is that that this person right here christine massy seems

02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:27.080
to go around flouting the foyas as enough and that it frustrates me that somebody like she was being

02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:31.560
interviewed with that was uh that's the guy who does global

02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:39.560
um his last name is like chif michael chafkowski or something like that he's a dude who's got like

02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:45.560
a global news website of some kind or another and so she was being interviewed by him and for an

02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:50.200
hour they're talking about the significance of foyas never talking about murder and lying about

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:55.720
protocols and and all this other stuff but just hyper focused on this the same thing that they've

02:46:55.720 --> 02:47:00.840
been focused on for this hour and so that's what i was doing in that stream was trying to say that

02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:07.400
they're missing this opportunity to take a step over the goal line um where they would be able to

02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:12.360
make an argument that's a lot stronger that even more virologists would be potentially

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:19.880
persuaded by more academic biologists would be potentially persuaded by to demonstrate they

02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:26.040
understand the nuances of PCR they understand the nuances of of sequencing reactions and that

02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:32.600
signal could be seeded and explain to some of these people who again they admit they the foyas seem

02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.320
to reveal they don't understand their own experiments so then why not approach them about it and open

02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:41.960
that opening and say hey have you ever thought about the possibility that infectious clones don't

02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:46.360
do what you thought they did have you ever thought about the possibility that what you're detecting

02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:51.400
doesn't seem to replicate like you pretended it does and then maybe some of these methodologies

02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:58.920
should be understood in a different way nope i see and we see this with um some of the prominent

02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:03.080
so-called health freedom people is that they try and trick the audience into saying that we don't

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:08.200
have any material or that um there's there's nothing to what we're saying now i mean i i write an essay

02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:14.200
that was almost 30 000 words specifically addressing all of these problems with virology but of all

02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.600
these critics that we've had the ones i've been in contact with and i've asked them did you read

02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:23.320
my paper not one of them has they they don't even um pretend that they've read it and they

02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:27.880
basically say that they don't need to and then go back to citing all of the biological nonsense

02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:33.320
that we've um or clearly that's not me right but uh you know they're trying to put me in that same

02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:38.440
bucket they want very much their viewers to not take Jonathan Cooley seriously as an alternative

02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:44.280
view they don't want to take Jonathan Cooley seriously as a nuanced understanding that is

02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:51.720
worth considering they are putting me in the bucket of every other person like Kevin McCairn

02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:56.840
Charles Ricksy Kevin McCurnan everybody else maryll nast that says there was a novel

02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.720
virus that they treated multiple times that early treatment worked for that millions of people

02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:06.600
died from that probably was leaked from a by from a laboratory and maybe uh according to very

02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.760
recently maybe it was even a clone and it spread around because we put a fear and cleavage site in

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:17.320
it I'm not saying any of that anymore and yet they are doing this entire hour to make sure

02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:23.320
that all of their viewers believe that I have believe that that's me and misconstruing the

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:27.560
arguments that they've even played as though they represent a guy who thinks like that

02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:35.320
keep the bite okay so now we'll move on to the final clip this is the best one just to comment

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:40.040
on the no virus thing I mean um some some listeners right now are gonna get angry with me but it's

02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:45.400
fine I get pooped on from all uh directions but I just and I found that no virus people are the

02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:49.720
most zealous zealous almost cult-like because you don't get it from the people who say oh it's a

02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:55.160
bi-weapon or a different series and but the thing that gets me I can believe that I mean

02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:59.800
COVID was not a virus and it was all manufactured okay I can go with that but they have further

02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:03.640
gone and they throw the baby out with the bathwater sort of as you say and they say infectious

02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:10.360
disease never existed pestilence plague contagion doesn't exist when I know from my very well

02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.920
experience you know um infectious disease exists and that's the thing where it gets me where

02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:20.760
guys I mean you've gone too too far you know any thought on that yeah I think you summarize

02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:25.560
it perfectly I think it's it is a and I've been trying to say this on my stream it is a bit of a

02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:32.360
trap and for some reason um I don't know if they're they're they're part of this or not I don't know

02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:37.080
how to really think about it but some of the level of disingenuousness that exists on that side

02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.840
in particular is extraordinary because as I tried to say earlier although I guess I probably didn't

02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.640
say it very well but they're very meticulous when it comes to looking at viral papers and pointing

02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:52.840
out the incongruencies between the control group and the experimental group and but more than a few

02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:59.880
of these people have pointed to a woman by the name of Veda Austin who takes water from people's

02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.440
bottles and freezes it and then it gives them messages in the form of an image that she can

02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:07.560
you know show you pictures of and say that water has all this emotional memory

02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:14.040
the same people who want you to take their scrutiny of virology seriously seem to not apply any

02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:20.360
scrutiny to some of the other people that they that they co-promote which is so bizarre to me um and

02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:27.160
so obviously fabricated I I don't even know how to say it any other way but but if you if you can

02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:31.720
dedicate a whole hour to giving a meticulous presentation about how coronavirus 2 was never

02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:38.280
isolated and that they're missing the proper controls but then pivot almost in a slide to

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:43.080
water memory and then not mention that Luke Montagnier was working on water memory in a very

02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:48.920
specific form with reference to DNA delusions but focus exclusively on this you know pictures

02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:55.160
and images of emotions it seems so so patently obvious that there's a game happening here

02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:03.400
there wasn't any presentation of any scientific evidence to support germ theory that was mostly

02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:11.160
just an holy shit so they're not going to address the fact that Tom colon and Andy

02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:15.960
Colin have promoted this New Zealand lady who can freeze water and see wedding rings in it when

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:23.560
you think of wedding or love they're just going to completely ignore the fact that that I have

02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:27.560
specifically said that the problem is is that they're right that's what I was saying they're

02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:33.640
they're right about virology but then they're wrong about all this other shit so they cut that clip

02:52:33.640 --> 02:52:39.160
as best their clever ass could cut it and it still reveals their little game because in the end

02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:45.640
controller Andy Kaufman decides to completely ignore the clip they just played

02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:52.760
that is freaking amazing watch it again because that's really amazing isolated and that they're

02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:59.560
missing the proper controls but then pivot almost in a slide to water memory and then not

02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:03.720
mentioned that Luke Montenier was working on water memory in a very specific form with reference

02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:10.360
to DNA delusions but focus exclusively on this you know pictures and images of emotions it seems

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:19.240
so so patently obvious that there's a game happening here um there wasn't any presentation of any

02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:26.120
scientific evidence to support germ theory that was mostly just an ad hominem kind of attack

02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:32.120
and you know the the only thing really that contributes to germ theory who said germ theory

02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:42.760
and I had hominem attack this is just extraordinary to me I never watched this video to the end because

02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:47.480
I didn't have enough time in my life to waste and now I do because I do think it's an important

02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:51.320
point to make because next month I might be on the same stage as this guy

02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:57.160
there's a good chance I think that after this show that could be a problem we'll see

02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:05.560
but I noticed that at the red pill conference that Andy Kaufman's not talking about this biology

02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:13.000
at all even though for all of 2020 that was his job that was what he talked about and before 2020

02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:19.800
he was working on prison bio surveillance this discussion is okay well if if you know

02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:23.880
pestilence in the plague really exist and just point us to the evidence that shows

02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:29.560
the you know agent that of causation and how that was determined and we would be happy to

02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:34.840
you know discuss it whatever we think about anything else is you know just not relevant to

02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:39.080
the issue and you know water science which you know I think we've all talked about

02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:43.720
or at least Tom and I have talked about much in his experiments and others who have done

02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:48.920
work in that area and many other areas. Tom has also talked about the chick that I mentioned

02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:53.640
who freezes water and can read the emotions in it so don't obfuscate that that's what I said

02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:58.200
it's related to water science so it's not a fair representation but it's still completely

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:03.080
irrelevant you know to the discussion about if germ has caused disease. It's not irrelevant

02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:08.360
because if they have a valid position about whether germs cause disease or not but then they

02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:13.720
regularly undermine themselves by saying stupid shit like there's no ion channels there are no

02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:19.320
action potentials there's no electrical chemical conductance gradients across lipid

02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:24.440
lipid bilayers like Tom Cowan said on March 1st of this year

02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:31.480
and so even though in that video you we watched yesterday he nails the ivermectin explanation

02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:35.800
and how they trick people into believing there was a novel virus by getting them to argue about

02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:40.920
whether ivermectin worked he then pivots to saying that there's nothing going on in the brain that

02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.960
we understand and none of this these biochemical and biophysical measurements that have done over

02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:51.640
the course of 40 years just like the observations of these traveling RNAs it's just all nonsense

02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:56.840
all these observations should just be ignored and there's we know nothing about ion channels says

02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:05.560
Tom Cowan they want you to burn the whole library because virology is a lie they want you to burn

02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:12.600
all of the sacred biology that that that we may have started to understand is there they want

02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:19.880
you to burn all of that and they want you to go back to mythologies and and and witchcraft and

02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:25.720
and all this other nonsense as the word nutrition been used at all in this

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:33.560
have they pointed out that americans are extremely unhealthy so it would be a real easy way to

02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:40.840
pull off a mass casualty event or two to elevate all cause mortality with a combination of clever

02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:46.680
numbers and also really bad protocols in order to convince the world that this that this illusion

02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:54.760
of virology is true why not have a preface in the farewell to virology document that says this

02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:59.080
the illusion in this book is so important for them to maintain that we

02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:03.880
posit that they probably lied about murdering people all around the world in order to make

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:09.320
sure that this illusion of RNA high fidelity virology would be something that we would pass

02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:13.480
on to our children how long have I been saying that and how long have they been ignoring it

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:23.880
because this video was meant to make sure that all of their viewers ignored me just like Kevin

02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:31.320
McCairn makes videos to make sure that all of his viewers ignore me because the illusion was

02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:37.000
created by these people the illusion is being sustained by some of these people and the illusion

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.560
is designed to trap us all and we're not all in the cage yet that's why we couldn't have got here

02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:49.400
in 2020 that's why so many people were focused on making sure I didn't get here in 2020 even

02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:54.200
though I was damn close that's the reason why people made sure that CHD and these people didn't

02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:59.720
come together in one understanding in 2023 because we're not supposed to get there yet but we will

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:07.240
I assure you we will because the truth cannot be hidden forever because the criminal vaccine

02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:12.600
schedule in America cannot be hidden forever because the lies that these people have told

02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:26.200
will not be hidden forever ladies and gentlemen they definitely will not be hidden forever

02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:38.280
ladies and gentlemen this has been GIGO and biological high resistance low noise information

02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:45.000
brief bought to you by a pissed off biologist you can help support this stream by sharing

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:53.640
this video as widely as it can go email anyone you want by name including the people involved in

02:58:53.640 --> 02:59:01.160
this charade and if you have the means and the desire please go to GIGO and biological and help

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:06.440
support this work thank you very much for joining me I'm sorry I started late and I'm sorry I went

02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:10.440
long I hope some of it was useful and I will see you again tomorrow at 10.10

02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:50.840
so

03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:08.440
You
