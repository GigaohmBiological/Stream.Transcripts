WEBVTT

01:20.036 --> 01:21.598
I think truth is good for kids.

01:22.019 --> 01:25.883
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:26.324 --> 01:27.966
We want everybody to feel good.

01:27.986 --> 01:30.289
That's not the way life is.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.031
I don't care how you get there.

02:04.051 --> 02:06.734
I don't care what you do to get there.

02:06.754 --> 02:09.397
The goal is to win.

02:23.976 --> 02:26.258
I still didn't have my mouse in the right place.

02:26.378 --> 02:27.779
Suddenly, I, oh, man.

02:28.479 --> 02:28.820
I know.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.561
What you talking about, Willis?

02:31.262 --> 02:36.826
Yeah, so we are still needing to stay focused on the biology.

02:36.886 --> 02:40.609
We still need to focus on not taking the bait.

02:41.349 --> 02:47.594
on social media, and we still need to figure out who our neighbors are and start to build relationships with them.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.075
Good morning from Northern California.

02:50.115 --> 02:54.218
Good morning to the first in the chat from Boston, Mark Kulak.

02:55.199 --> 02:59.802
This is the usual warning to get off of social media.

02:59.882 --> 03:01.864
These people are not serious people.

03:01.924 --> 03:06.928
They are paid influencers being employed to govern social media users' very attention.

03:08.188 --> 03:13.692
The only non-compliance that matters is getting our children off of social media.

03:14.273 --> 03:35.368
And if you want to drop a real bomb in the room at the next dinner party or at the next bar you're in, make sure you remind everybody that autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

03:36.946 --> 03:42.828
And please understand that they've done the same thing with the pandemic myth, with gain-of-function, with the lab leak.

03:43.328 --> 03:52.372
They're making sure that these things are never questioned, that they are never questioned as methodologies, as science, as reasons, as answers.

03:53.635 --> 04:03.322
We must wake our children up, ladies and gentlemen, and explain to our children why the cheese is free on social media, why Snapchat is free.

04:03.822 --> 04:08.585
We need our kids to understand it, and I think we need our kids to learn biology.

04:08.645 --> 04:09.946
That's at least the plan here.

04:10.407 --> 04:11.107
Welcome to the show.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.488
This is GigaOM Biological.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.790
You can hear the air conditioner blowing in the background.

04:14.830 --> 04:20.233
It's an odd combination of humid and rainy, and it just gets hot in this back room.

04:21.574 --> 04:30.462
If you notice here, this is Jonathan Cooey, JC in the Woods, Birdsong and Coffee on Sunday, the 19th of July, 2020.

04:30.942 --> 04:35.706
That is nearly six years ago.

04:35.726 --> 04:45.234
And at that time, I had a current hypothesis where I was suggesting that this likely originated from a laboratory source, but it doesn't really matter when.

04:45.874 --> 04:54.042
because they've been leaking all the time and they have been putting this signal in the background all the time as they've been making these pure constructs.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.524
And these signals are endemic.

04:56.684 --> 04:57.965
Now, did I have that right?

04:59.787 --> 05:00.167
I don't know.

05:00.187 --> 05:01.949
Oh, the green screen.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.429
Oh shit.

05:02.450 --> 05:03.350
Why did I look up there?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.591
The green screen is busted.

05:04.632 --> 05:05.432
Hold on one second.

05:07.774 --> 05:11.318
This will not in any way help with the noise of the air conditioner, but

05:11.932 --> 05:14.834
It will help with the appearance of the green screen.

05:14.874 --> 05:15.654
There we go.

05:16.294 --> 05:24.779
So this video is from a July 2020 video where I was trying to explain my current hypothesis.

05:25.319 --> 05:37.246
And at that time, I had already distilled it down to the idea that there's no way, that they have no feasible way of differentiating the current signal they're claiming.

05:38.306 --> 05:47.781
from an irreducibly complex background that included, in my mind at the time, these other viruses that have been reported in the literature for decades.

05:48.826 --> 06:00.029
And so I was pretty close to dead on balls accurate with the exception of not quite being at the stage where I could explain that RNA can't really do what they're saying they're doing.

06:00.529 --> 06:01.809
But I was close already by 2020.

06:03.530 --> 06:14.613
So by 2021, I had already pretty much learned enough, read enough to understand that even the concept of an RNA based pandemic was a ridiculous exaggeration.

06:15.544 --> 06:17.626
So I started to really see it as a script.

06:18.186 --> 06:39.745
I started to see it as something that everybody was being encouraged to not only solve themselves or learn themselves or teach themselves, but it was a mystery that we were supposed to advocate for a particular set of solutions for, that we had to ban gain-of-function, that these people had to go to jail, and that we had to admit that we were responsible for it.

06:41.912 --> 06:51.359
There are very few people on the internet that I can point to with any reasonable amount of certainty and say that I think they're okay.

06:52.259 --> 06:55.181
One of them would be Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS.

06:56.062 --> 06:57.383
One of them would be Joe Marshall.

06:58.784 --> 07:05.349
And one of them would be this substack in Scotland called Biology Phenomena on substack.com.

07:06.169 --> 07:09.632
I think there are a few reasonably good players on Earth right now.

07:09.652 --> 07:10.953
The rest, I don't really know.

07:12.170 --> 07:15.952
And I got to be really honest with you, I'm not very optimistic.

07:16.252 --> 07:20.615
The truth will set us free, but unfortunately, most of us are going to have to do this work on our own.

07:20.655 --> 07:22.916
There's not going to be any cliff notes anytime soon.

07:23.897 --> 07:31.681
And even if I get my book done or when I get my book done, it's not going to be a shortcut to understanding the reality that we're in.

07:32.262 --> 07:38.145
It's going to be a sort of, you know, handbook of a list of exercises that you can do to reach the endpoint.

07:39.269 --> 07:47.656
But we're not going to be able to put it into a tome where people will be able to just, you know, like a lonely planet guide to real earth or something.

07:47.696 --> 07:49.597
That's actually a really interesting idea.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.758
I shouldn't have said that out loud.

07:51.259 --> 07:54.401
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a stream coming from the United States of America.

07:54.421 --> 07:56.963
If you've been here for a while, you might be here at the top of the wave.

07:57.904 --> 08:03.248
If not, you might be a skilled TV watcher and in need of understanding that you got to stay focused on the biology.

08:03.288 --> 08:05.110
You can't take the bait on social media.

08:05.570 --> 08:06.611
You might just want to leave.

08:07.131 --> 08:10.714
And you got to learn who your neighbors are and start building a relationship with them.

08:11.254 --> 08:15.718
Because in the coming years it's going to be necessary to really be friends with those people.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.219
Especially should the internet go out.

08:18.280 --> 08:23.063
You're going to want to have friendships and relationships with all of those people in your immediate vicinity.

08:23.103 --> 08:29.048
Because if you don't, building those relationships when the internet goes out is going to be a very big challenge.

08:29.968 --> 08:34.449
Whereas people who already have those relationships may already have commitments to other people.

08:35.009 --> 08:40.951
And so I can't stress enough how important it is to know who your neighbors are, to take care of them, to make a relationship with them.

08:41.471 --> 08:46.172
Bring yourself back to reality that's in your own neighborhood on your own street next door.

08:47.272 --> 08:49.153
And the way that this works is very simple.

08:49.233 --> 08:56.215
People like Simon and people like Jeff and people like William, they give

08:57.435 --> 09:01.357
quite substantial sums of money every month that add up close to rent.

09:02.937 --> 09:15.223
And then around 100 and now three, we've been losing subscribers lately, 103 other people give me around $10 a month or the equivalent thereof on an annual basis.

09:15.683 --> 09:18.384
And that makes us able to get by.

09:18.424 --> 09:19.605
It's not anything magic.

09:20.805 --> 09:22.526
But with the way this is gonna win,

09:23.507 --> 09:25.208
is that more people need to find it.

09:25.248 --> 09:28.369
We need more people to wake up to the reality of things.

09:28.409 --> 09:31.631
And that's not, that doesn't mean I need more money.

09:31.831 --> 09:35.693
It means that I need this shared, this work shared.

09:35.853 --> 09:39.515
I need this, I need people to advocate for people to watch this.

09:40.215 --> 09:41.616
I need kids to watch this.

09:41.696 --> 09:51.281
I need college kids that are interested in biology and in the pandemic to watch this and to reconsider what possibly happened to them over the last four years.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.352
and the fact that a lot of the adults in their life have something to apologize for.

09:57.563 --> 10:05.347
Now, if you want to share it, the best way to share it is to share gigaohmbiological.com because all the links are there to all the different places that this is hosted.

10:05.907 --> 10:13.971
So if they like Rumble, if they like YouTube, if they like to want to try PeerTube, if they like Twitch, and also the link to the stuff is there.

10:14.011 --> 10:18.253
And the stuff is something that anybody can use to find, you know, their way.

10:18.793 --> 10:24.656
One of the things that's in the stuff folder is a PDF of this book, which I can't stress enough is so important to read.

10:25.336 --> 10:28.578
if you're serious about wanting to understand the history of these ideas.

10:31.461 --> 10:38.106
I don't know how annoying that air conditioner is, but I just thought I'd do that without some music.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.547
Welcome to the show.

10:39.587 --> 10:43.870
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:44.450 --> 10:46.191
I am very happy to be here this morning.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.814
We've got a lot of work to do, though, because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:49.874 --> 10:50.535
was on

10:51.195 --> 11:07.822
Tucker Carlson and that basically obliges me to listen and I think take notes and try to do some degree of actual work in terms of critiquing him in a semi-serious way as insofar as I can do on a stream on Twitch.

11:09.502 --> 11:09.942
Anyway, this

11:12.904 --> 11:27.203
Stream for the last couple weeks has really been focused on trying to expose to people how impossible it is that these three clowns have so many podcasts together and the content of those podcasts is so absurd.

11:28.266 --> 11:35.351
over the last five years for these two of three to land big time jobs in the FDA.

11:35.451 --> 11:38.694
It's just impossible that this is by accident.

11:38.934 --> 11:51.563
Instead, what I would suggest is that they were on a script of bullshit from the very beginning, that they were encouraged to develop their ability to shoot the shit together on podcasts.

11:52.742 --> 11:57.385
and encouraged by book sales and by other things that they were peddling.

11:57.445 --> 12:12.775
These people are part of an elaborate hoax, a long con that ultimately has its roots in the Human Genome Project, the Manhattan Project, and the idea of a multi-generational plan to take over the evolution of the species.

12:12.995 --> 12:13.736
I shit you not.

12:15.540 --> 12:16.782
That's how serious this is.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.126
It's not a conspiracy theory.

12:19.347 --> 12:26.178
It is just the idea that there is a longer term plan than the four year Trump administration.

12:26.218 --> 12:27.641
There's a longer term plan.

12:28.317 --> 12:33.720
than the 20-year charter plan of the CHD, whatever the hell that would be.

12:34.861 --> 12:40.064
There's a real long-term plan behind all of this, and it's not China taking over America.

12:40.564 --> 12:45.127
It's not Russia using its bots to thwart the next election.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.308
It's none of that.

12:46.388 --> 12:52.892
It's not the inheritor of Epstein Island and that network controlling America.

12:52.952 --> 12:53.492
It's not.

12:54.252 --> 12:54.973
It's just not.

12:57.335 --> 13:01.759
There are so many bigger ideas at stake.

13:01.799 --> 13:13.648
There are so many, there are so many more forward thinking ideas at stake here.

13:14.619 --> 13:22.426
that all of the nonsense that's on social media can only be seen as nonsense if you're processing it correctly.

13:23.127 --> 13:37.280
All of the substacks that somebody like Jessica Hockett Faber puts out can only be seen as nonsense, AI augmented nonsense that's designed to waste people's time.

13:39.079 --> 13:47.307
instead of teaching them things that are very easy to teach because they are very succinct ideas that can be taught in such a way that now it's up to you.

13:48.448 --> 13:49.489
And that's really the trick.

13:50.430 --> 13:55.895
Funny how even the trick with Christianity has been, here it is, now it's up to you.

13:58.038 --> 14:26.994
and only now recently in 2020 through 2025 do we have all these people who are wearing their Christianity around their necks and on their on their shirts and sweatshirts and all this other stuff talking about it openly when there's nothing in the Bible about t-shirts there's nothing in the Bible about telling everybody as far as I understand from the New Testament I've read

14:28.127 --> 14:30.349
It's supposed to be kind of a personal relationship.

14:30.369 --> 14:36.234
You're supposed to do it, you know, doing your praying and all that out of the eyes of the public.

14:37.174 --> 14:38.435
It's a private relationship.

14:39.656 --> 14:51.806
And it should be through your deeds, through your words, through your actions, through your behavior, through the patterns you set over time that people see the Christian in you.

14:54.509 --> 14:59.034
And it's really here it is and now it's up to you.

15:00.795 --> 15:02.137
That's how it was given to me.

15:02.197 --> 15:03.638
That's how it's been taught to me.

15:04.079 --> 15:06.101
And that's how I see it.

15:07.202 --> 15:09.444
It's not anybody's job.

15:13.969 --> 15:15.750
I just think it's everybody's job.

15:15.890 --> 15:17.973
It's your responsibility to figure it out.

15:18.772 --> 15:23.154
It's your responsibility to ask that adult question of what the hell am I doing here?

15:23.715 --> 15:31.939
And it's your adult responsibility to come up with a good answer because if you can't come up with a good answer, then think about what that means for you as an adult.

15:32.339 --> 15:34.960
Think about what that means for you and your offspring.

15:35.041 --> 15:39.503
Think about what that means for all the time you've had on earth up until now.

15:39.563 --> 15:45.126
If you don't know what you want to do, if you don't know what you're here for by now,

15:47.458 --> 15:57.501
and you think you're gonna find it by scrolling, I got nothing for you, because what you're gonna find is this, elaborate hoax, scripted bullshit.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.441
That's what you will find.

15:59.722 --> 16:01.502
And this is also scripted bullshit.

16:02.282 --> 16:05.523
There's no way to see this any other way.

16:05.543 --> 16:09.725
The price of synthesizing virus genomes get down to about five cents a base.

16:09.945 --> 16:11.485
It's gonna cost $1,500 to synthesize a coronavirus genome.

16:17.310 --> 16:25.696
It may scare the hell out of some of us, but it does allow us to ask those questions in an affordable manner.

16:26.257 --> 16:40.708
The other way to do it, even more cheaply, is to actually clone out the spike genes and make, in essence, recombinants where you drop the spike gene of different bat coronaviruses that you think may have appropriate properties that could be pre-emergent strains.

16:41.465 --> 16:46.467
and characterize their ability to replicate in human cells, both primary cells and other cells in culture.

16:46.527 --> 16:49.089
So those types of questions are doable.

16:49.829 --> 16:57.373
The spike, even the spike genome, for example, is only about 4 kb, so at 10 cents a base, it's a $400 experiment.

16:59.914 --> 17:02.775
Now, maybe dual use experiments are a concern.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.716
That's another issue.

17:06.001 --> 17:18.366
There's Ralph Baric in 2013, jibber-jabbering away about how you can make synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA, and you can transform and transfect cell culture and see what happens.

17:19.847 --> 17:33.472
And their claim is, is that the sequences that they find in the bat anus, if they are made synthetically in pure quantities, that that is roughly recapitulating whatever phenomenon is represented by the sequence that they found.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.673
Stop lying!

17:36.280 --> 17:38.261
And that's completely wrong.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.383
That's completely absurd.

17:42.944 --> 17:44.285
And yet that's what they are doing.

17:45.265 --> 17:50.428
That is absolutely positively at the heart of all virology today.

17:51.308 --> 17:53.530
They find a sequence in the wild.

17:54.434 --> 18:14.364
and it could even be a sequence that is templated in a AI type machine learning program and it sorts through this huge irreducibly complex noise and tries to put together a puzzle that reasonably represents the canonical puzzle that the machine learning algorithm is trying to match.

18:16.485 --> 18:22.848
In other words, going into a junkyard and assembling what looks like a pile of parts that belong to the same car.

18:24.628 --> 18:32.953
And then taking all those parts and manufacturing them and making a lot of those cars and then saying, now you're doing, you know, auto design.

18:34.554 --> 18:43.840
And it doesn't matter if none of those cars actually drive or if they fit together or anything like that, because you will still have something that will roll.

18:44.901 --> 18:51.245
You'll still have something that will probably start and make noise and smoke, and maybe even can explode.

18:53.114 --> 19:00.681
And so then you can make the argument that, you know, what I found in the junkyard is a sign that there might be some really dangerous cars out there in the wild.

19:01.202 --> 19:10.110
Because when I reassembled these parts, this frickin' thing went like 150 miles an hour on those tiny tires, and then it exploded when it hit a tree.

19:12.864 --> 19:19.651
And that's exactly what he's talking about here when he talks about taking a spike protein and putting it with something else and blah, blah, blah.

19:20.051 --> 19:26.418
And so they have no concept of what these signals do in the wild, how they exist in the wild.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.439
They have theories.

19:27.619 --> 19:28.560
They have models.

19:29.381 --> 19:44.698
And then they don't test any of those theories or any of those models because instead of trying to reproduce what they think is happening in the wild with regard to like a genetic swarm or something like that, they make a synthetic pure quantity.

19:45.138 --> 20:06.423
that could never exist in the wild, could never exist under the biology of RNA replication, could never exist in any context other than the synthetic generation of DNA or RNA using standard pharmaceutical methodologies that are used to make protein and stopping short of the protein.

20:07.343 --> 20:07.783
That's it!

20:09.622 --> 20:11.103
And that's all they've had since 2013.

20:12.384 --> 20:15.327
So how do they get you to accept that there's more than that?

20:16.048 --> 20:31.901
They get a fat guy like this, and a fat guy like Dezak, and a short guy like Hotez, and a short guy like Malone, and a short guy like Fauci, and they tell all those guys that you guys are going to be the most important dudes for like a decade.

20:32.302 --> 20:32.902
Are you ready?

20:33.202 --> 20:34.343
Are you ready for this?

20:35.004 --> 20:37.246
This is going to be the best ever.

20:38.786 --> 20:39.789
Welcome to DITRA.

20:39.909 --> 20:40.851
Welcome to DOD.

20:44.158 --> 20:55.761
And that's what we have here, scripted bullshit from the DOD, scripted bullshit from the NIAID, scripted bullshit from USAID, scripted bullshit maybe from DARPA, I don't care.

20:56.141 --> 21:04.042
But it's all scripted bullshit because it's not based in biology, and the only thing they don't tell you is that this is all they have.

21:04.082 --> 21:04.983
He just told you.

21:05.383 --> 21:07.523
The only thing they've got is it's getting cheaper.

21:07.963 --> 21:11.264
And that's the same story that the Human Genome Project has told us.

21:11.664 --> 21:18.230
It used to be expensive, now it's cheap, and so we were gonna save the world, and now we're gonna do it cheaply.

21:18.751 --> 21:21.634
Now we could destroy the world, now we can do it cheaply.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.697
It's the same scripted bullshit lie.

21:29.659 --> 21:31.179
It's a lie about endemicity.

21:31.860 --> 21:50.305
It's a lie about the idea that something in a mud puddle, if it has the right furin cleavage site, the right homologies, the right HIV inserts, we could be dealing with the most contagious virus ever, like Charles Rixey explains in his substack, and collected over 3,000 articles that purport to say the same thing.

21:50.845 --> 21:51.786
What a hero!

21:54.386 --> 21:58.148
And this endemicity is a myth thing took me like five years to get to.

21:58.228 --> 21:59.028
I didn't have this

22:00.546 --> 22:04.307
kind of understanding five years ago, not even two years ago was I here.

22:05.087 --> 22:13.168
Did I understand how we could get out of it by starting to decide whether any of these big terms, these big concepts were real or not?

22:13.268 --> 22:17.429
You know, like a pandemic or like the process of going endemic.

22:18.029 --> 22:25.030
These are concepts that when you learn them as a student, they are taught to you as a concept.

22:25.490 --> 22:29.111
And if they're taught to you as a concept, it is kind of a given.

22:30.526 --> 22:32.728
And that is an assumption that cannot be made.

22:32.808 --> 22:38.332
That is an assumption that if it is made, you can be enslaved by it, especially if it's completely wrong.

22:44.249 --> 23:04.821
And so the same assumption is being made now by everybody in the medical community when they assume that these PCR tests that they are using, like Mary Talley Bowden described, where you can find up to 17 different antigens for 17 different viruses in one test kit, and they're just using them because this is now diagnostic standard.

23:05.282 --> 23:12.426
Understand that using their ghosts to find their ghosts doesn't make them, sorry, using their tests to find their ghosts doesn't make their ghosts real.

23:12.486 --> 23:13.487
But more importantly,

23:14.187 --> 23:16.389
It's not just the ghost of COVID anymore.

23:17.589 --> 23:27.496
They are using this to track all them ghosts and make all those ghosts real for all of those healthcare workers, all of those doctors, all of those patients.

23:27.997 --> 23:42.086
And so people are being brainwashed every day, bamboozled every day, and probably with supplementary, supplemented by taxpayer dollars, Medicaid and Medicare money is being used to test old people for 17 different

23:45.199 --> 23:45.839
It's bad.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.320
It's really bad.

23:50.081 --> 23:56.164
And the worst part is, is this story is very easy to tell because there are two main blips you need to understand.

23:56.404 --> 24:01.306
One is that there were a half a million people killed by opioids in 2020, 21, 22, 23, I think 24 together.

24:01.326 --> 24:01.726
Half a million.

24:10.598 --> 24:15.024
And those age groups were enough to reduce the life expectancy in America.

24:15.424 --> 24:16.986
That's all that needed.

24:17.367 --> 24:24.556
There was no other signal required for the age of expected, you know, life expectancy in America to go down.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.300
That was more than enough.

24:28.740 --> 24:43.228
On top of that, what you need to really recognize is that there's a reason why no one, from the start of the pandemic on, has ever shown you the population of a country in the form of a population pyramid.

24:43.268 --> 24:46.350
And the reason why is because a population pyramid can show you

24:47.372 --> 24:54.834
how healthy a population is, it can show you expected signals that are to come in the future, like when these people die.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.576
It will be more than when these people are dying.

24:58.656 --> 25:06.718
It will be necessarily more of a burden on the healthcare system than was previously present, and they've known this was coming.

25:07.098 --> 25:12.300
And so an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, sculpted with murder and lies,

25:12.800 --> 25:25.147
like the opioid crisis, but also like using supplementary oxygen and not treating a viral syndrome with antibiotics, can result in kind of mitigating this problem.

25:27.688 --> 25:36.393
And so this was, and it remains for all the marbles, it remains for the grandchildren of Earth, they need us to teach this shit to our kids instead of saving them from it.

25:37.321 --> 25:43.144
Instead of pulling our kids out of social media, they need us to acquiesce to it.

25:44.264 --> 25:59.071
And so I can't stress enough, one of the best ways to see it is to realize, come to the realization yourself, in your own heart, and understand how malevolent it is that there has been a fake, anti-vax, health freedom movement in America since around 2018.

26:02.190 --> 26:13.219
And that health, fake health, anti-vax movement is probably responsible for killing at least two very good Americans, Brandy Vaughn and Dr. Tony Bark.

26:16.902 --> 26:25.049
And so when I say sculpted with murder and lies, not only can you see it in the graph, but of course, we have this unmistakably

26:26.184 --> 26:36.944
robust list and what's unmistakably robust about it is that there is an extraordinary paucity of the discussion of really any of these things.

26:37.904 --> 26:40.267
Remdesivir is kind of okay to talk about.

26:40.847 --> 26:48.115
But the poor use of steroids, the only one who jokes about that is Robert Malone when he's on Paul Cottrell's podcast in 2021.

26:48.336 --> 26:49.957
He certainly won't joke about it now.

26:50.538 --> 26:56.364
The lack of antibiotic use seems to have missed the radar of every one of these

26:57.145 --> 27:17.501
Eminent doctors Pierre Corey's never said it McCullough's never said it the five, you know postdoctoral degrees Jessica Rose has never said it the math genius Matt Crawford's never said it none of these Super geniuses have been able to come up with a list like this None of them have ever bothered to try

27:19.278 --> 27:24.881
And that's because they are all on Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's malevolent shit script.

27:25.801 --> 27:28.022
And they are on X spreading it.

27:28.122 --> 27:29.783
They are on Local spreading it.

27:29.963 --> 27:31.324
On Rumble spreading it.

27:31.444 --> 27:33.165
And on Substack spreading it.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.447
And the spread of these shitty ideas has always been the danger.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.628
It was never the spreading of an RNA molecule.

27:41.289 --> 27:46.051
And once you come to understand that all of these people have been working together to confuse us,

27:46.670 --> 27:51.574
We found spike in somebody 2.5 years after mRNA vaccination.

27:52.355 --> 27:53.916
So we have some of these coming out.

27:53.956 --> 28:03.124
Then you'll understand why we have Kermit the Frog and Dr. Drew telling us that we're finding spike in these people, but they're still not able to say transfection.

28:05.162 --> 28:08.164
They're still not able to say murder or manslaughter.

28:08.204 --> 28:14.147
They're still not able to explain why not treating with antibiotics for a viral syndrome might be a problem.

28:14.467 --> 28:19.510
They're still not able to explain all these very basic ways that manslaughter occurred in America.

28:20.871 --> 28:28.138
And all of these people seem to be woefully unaware of the half a million Americans killed over the last five and a half years by opioids.

28:28.158 --> 28:33.903
So Kermit the Frog is really concerned about the spike protein, but he's full of shit.

28:34.423 --> 28:38.047
He's on the same script that Ralph Baric was on.

28:39.548 --> 28:41.870
It's a long con, you have to see it.

28:42.070 --> 28:44.953
It's a long con, one continuous script.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.787
Some excess mortality papers coming out.

28:49.828 --> 28:54.830
We identified large increases in deaths after vaccination.

28:54.870 --> 28:58.652
So a lot up the pipeline at the McCullough Foundation here.

28:59.252 --> 29:02.874
We're now over our 20th study looking at the harms of these shots.

29:03.214 --> 29:08.937
And we will continue to do so until the government finally does something about it.

29:08.957 --> 29:14.700
Because unfortunately, our government did not look for any treatments for the vaccine injured.

29:14.740 --> 29:15.681
They have been ignored.

29:16.101 --> 29:17.962
There are millions of them.

29:18.443 --> 29:20.344
Millions of vaccine-injured Americans.

29:20.684 --> 29:23.266
And so we have to start helping these people out.

29:23.586 --> 29:31.791
I don't know how many people, if you go ask any of your friends or family, usually somebody knows somebody that has either died or been permanently disabled.

29:31.811 --> 29:32.632
I've got patience.

29:33.132 --> 29:33.893
I've got patience.

29:33.953 --> 29:35.994
And it's really very striking when you see it.

29:36.154 --> 29:37.435
It's not a rare thing.

29:37.915 --> 29:40.077
It's very striking when you see it.

29:40.137 --> 29:41.598
It's not a rare thing.

29:43.399 --> 29:44.440
These people are fake.

29:45.629 --> 29:47.010
Their sympathy is fake.

29:47.050 --> 29:50.152
Their crusade is fake.

29:50.472 --> 29:52.494
They're some of the worst Americans alive.

29:53.574 --> 30:02.520
And they have fooled our family and friends with this fake conservative health freedom movement that doesn't exist except on X. These people are terrible.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.702
And they have a 501c3.

30:05.362 --> 30:10.546
They can get great big donations and pay each other very big salaries with their 501c3.

30:10.986 --> 30:13.548
And I can't seem to get a lawyer to help me do it.

30:14.736 --> 30:20.759
Every time I freaking make an appointment with a lawyer in Pittsburgh, they tell me, okay, next week we're gonna do it.

30:20.819 --> 30:25.421
I'm gonna send you an email, and we're gonna get to work on this, and then nothing happens.

30:25.461 --> 30:27.281
And this is the third time it's happened.

30:28.242 --> 30:31.923
It's almost like every time I make a phone call, someone else makes a phone call.

30:32.724 --> 30:34.204
And I'm not fucking around here.

30:34.645 --> 30:35.385
This is real.

30:36.621 --> 30:47.284
I can't make a 501c3 without a little help, or at least I should have some help, and I can't even find any in Pittsburgh, because every time I call somebody, they don't want to help anymore.

30:50.365 --> 30:51.385
But we will get there.

30:52.246 --> 30:53.706
We will get there, I assure you.

30:53.766 --> 30:59.808
It's just annoying, because every time I think I finally met somebody who's cool, it doesn't work out.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.349
So what I want to do is watch this.

31:03.489 --> 31:05.670
I'm not sure we should watch it here.

31:06.944 --> 31:30.409
um let's just see first let's watch the beginning and then i'm gonna put it at a higher speed and get this slide off well here's the story you probably haven't heard a lot about the chinese mafia is exploiting rural america to create a drug empire this is not the chinese mafia is creating a drug empire okay first i don't know if anybody knows but those aren't very healthy pot plants uh available

31:30.589 --> 31:31.409
on cable news.

31:31.429 --> 31:32.050
Those aren't either.

31:32.450 --> 31:32.850
Oh wow.

31:32.870 --> 31:34.811
The network's not telling you about this but it's totally real.

31:35.051 --> 31:51.099
Communist affiliated drug gangs destroying parts of the United States, the parts that Washington ignores, to sell drugs, laundering money and building a black market network inside this country's most beautiful but least served areas.

31:51.139 --> 31:52.760
We've got a brand new documentary on this.

31:53.200 --> 31:57.082
It's called High Crimes, the Chinese Mafia Takeover of Rural America.

31:57.742 --> 31:59.883
It's available now on TuckerCarlson.com.

32:00.143 --> 32:04.665
Now, I don't doubt that there are probably Chinese bad guys that are trying to make money in rural America.

32:04.705 --> 32:05.565
That's fine with me.

32:06.185 --> 32:11.067
But I bet it's a relatively insignificant, I don't even know what we're talking about there.

32:11.527 --> 32:15.849
But it's remarkable that we're not talking about all the foreign passports in the American government.

32:15.869 --> 32:17.830
We're not talking about all the Indians.

32:18.650 --> 32:23.873
And we're not talking, I don't know what, we're not talking about anything relevant if we're gonna say China, China, Russia, Russia.

32:23.913 --> 32:24.813
It's pretty amazing.

32:25.474 --> 32:25.834
Anyway.

32:26.294 --> 32:26.774
Excellent.

32:27.335 --> 32:36.460
The purchase of churches and schools to aid the operation, the jerry-rigging of power boxes to steal electricity, foreign pesticides, collusion with the Mexican cartels.

32:36.840 --> 32:37.960
It's unbelievable.

32:38.261 --> 32:41.002
By the way, one of the drug houses is like walking distance from my house.

32:41.602 --> 32:42.303
I didn't know that.

32:42.463 --> 32:44.384
It's a layered and fascinating story.

32:44.764 --> 32:47.045
Head to TuckerCarlson.com to watch now.

32:47.446 --> 32:48.126
We think you'll love it.

32:57.890 --> 33:00.656
Okay, I'm gonna escape out of here, I'm gonna put it on here.

33:01.958 --> 33:03.601
Because we can put it on faster here.

33:04.704 --> 33:06.305
Well, here's the story you probably haven't heard a lot about.

33:06.325 --> 33:11.888
The Chinese mafia is exploiting rural America to create a drug empire.

33:12.148 --> 33:14.869
This is not available on cable news.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.251
The network's not telling you about this, but it's totally real.

33:17.491 --> 33:31.138
Communist affiliated drug gangs destroying parts of the United States, the parts that Washington ignores, laundering money and building work inside this country's most beautiful but least served areas.

33:31.158 --> 33:32.379
We've got a brand new documentary on this.

33:52.742 --> 33:53.983
Mr. Secretary, thank you for doing this.

33:54.503 --> 34:03.510
I remember the night that Trump won, talking to people in Washington and their doomsday scenario, the thing that they feared more than North Korea getting the bomb was you becoming Secretary of Health and Human Services.

34:03.530 --> 34:08.514
They really were afraid because they felt it was a threat, not just to them, but to the whole business of the city.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.956
And I think a lot, I mean, there's a reason they felt that way and they probably still do.

34:11.996 --> 34:13.057
So what's that been like?

34:13.077 --> 34:15.539
What's the opposition been like, the organized opposition to your program?

34:16.021 --> 34:20.126
Well, you know, the irony is I'm not really getting opposition directly from the industry.

34:20.166 --> 34:24.090
Most of the industry wants things from this department.

34:25.171 --> 34:27.453
And we want to, you know, we want American industry to profit.

34:27.694 --> 34:29.536
The pharmaceutical companies, everything else.

34:30.437 --> 34:34.381
And so and I think they know that and they know that we're working with them.

34:34.441 --> 34:34.741
We're not.

34:35.922 --> 34:40.686
They also know they've been getting away with stuff up till now and that era is over.

34:40.706 --> 34:44.909
I get opposition from proxies to the industry.

34:45.670 --> 34:58.520
And I think the major opposition that I feel is from the mainstream media and from Democrats, which is really, that is an interesting phenomenon because these were people I was friends with my whole life.

34:59.861 --> 35:04.845
So he says that, let me see if I can do this, just set this up right here.

35:07.626 --> 35:11.610
And then there should be a screen over here.

35:13.131 --> 35:16.815
So he says he wants American industry to prosper.

35:17.956 --> 35:21.239
And so I guess that's a generally speaking safe statement to make.

35:21.279 --> 35:24.322
But of course, it's also a very imprecise statement to make.

35:25.003 --> 35:26.684
Not surprising that he starts here.

35:27.685 --> 35:28.126
But again,

35:29.563 --> 35:41.529
if you thought that this was a good guy, if you thought that he had an elevator pitch that he was gonna throw out once he got the nomination, you were wrong, right?

35:42.269 --> 35:54.936
And I think that's what everybody assumed, that there was a pretty short list of things because apparently, according to the tweet that's promoting this video, he's been thinking about this for 20 years.

35:56.536 --> 36:07.078
So you think after 20 years, if you finally got somewhere where you could do something, you'd have a pretty succinct way of explaining your vision and arguing for your stance.

36:07.658 --> 36:09.539
But that's not what we've seen, of course.

36:10.659 --> 36:15.160
We've seen a guy who instead acts like he's just been reading a script.

36:16.280 --> 36:20.061
You know, he's been anti-vax because that's what they've been telling him to be.

36:22.335 --> 36:24.355
He's not actually any of these things.

36:24.415 --> 36:29.196
He may not even be that, that staunch of an environmental advocate.

36:29.216 --> 36:32.377
It may just be what he was coached to stand up.

36:33.477 --> 36:36.077
That's how pessimistic I am about this guy right now.

36:37.178 --> 36:43.459
This is scary to me because what I imagined he was as a man, he is definitely not.

36:43.579 --> 36:50.380
And instead he might just be an addict with a terrible family history and that's about it.

36:52.130 --> 36:59.740
I mean, what about him would really, really beg you to think that, wow, this guy's an exceptional man?

37:00.201 --> 37:06.148
Was it the swinging with no shirt on, on chains on the beach?

37:06.829 --> 37:09.112
Or was it the shirtless pushups that he did?

37:10.066 --> 37:18.971
What part of this guy's background would really make us think that, you know, I guess it's because he's been working at Children's Health Defense, right?

37:19.011 --> 37:30.297
Because Children's Health Defense has accomplished, yeah, conference and a conference and they sell books.

37:30.437 --> 37:32.558
They're fricking awesome with selling books.

37:35.259 --> 37:45.889
And yet somehow or another, we got bamboozled into believing that there was a health freedom movement and that this guy was the leader of it and that we were going somewhere with him.

37:48.051 --> 37:58.241
And so we need to wake up and apologize to our children, wake up and apologize to the people on the left for falling for such a bullshit show.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.891
We really do, that's where we are right now.

38:01.951 --> 38:17.116
We need to apologize for having fallen for Donald Trump, having fallen for this health freedom bullshit, for falling for Steve Bannon and his three pens in my shirt, I'm a working man bullshit stick.

38:17.956 --> 38:20.217
He is one of the worst Americans alive.

38:20.277 --> 38:24.979
We are talking about an absolute travesty, what has occurred here.

38:26.239 --> 38:27.740
Just script readers,

38:30.751 --> 38:35.472
America is about to collapse because we are being run by script-reading fools.

38:36.292 --> 38:42.894
And at any point in time, should the rug be pulled out from underneath this clown, he won't have an answer.

38:43.574 --> 38:46.495
He won't have been coached to what to say next.

38:47.355 --> 38:48.916
And he will fall apart.

38:49.436 --> 38:51.516
The HHS will fall apart.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.197
The Trump administration will lose all clout.

38:55.939 --> 39:00.483
And no matter what you cling to, no matter what you believe, it ain't gonna matter.

39:00.863 --> 39:06.428
The rest of the United States is gonna turn on us and they're gonna turn very quick.

39:06.608 --> 39:09.651
They haven't yet understand that now.

39:10.071 --> 39:14.115
They haven't yet because of that magic theater that's happening in the Middle East.

39:14.535 --> 39:18.098
And they're so broken up about what actually happened.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.880
Did he actually achieve something or not?

39:20.521 --> 39:21.822
They can't figure it out.

39:22.967 --> 39:42.381
And so there is an opening right now for us on the, whatever this is, the people that think that they still want to save America the right way by taking it back, us third party people, us party of the biology.

39:42.441 --> 39:49.786
I don't know what this is, but this is our chance because right now both sides are absolutely confused.

39:51.155 --> 39:52.757
they're confused about the same things.

39:53.277 --> 39:54.858
They're confused about the pandemic.

39:54.898 --> 39:56.480
They're confused about transfection.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.941
They're confused about the Middle East.

39:57.961 --> 39:59.302
They're confused about nukes.

39:59.843 --> 40:01.404
They're confused about energy.

40:01.444 --> 40:03.086
They're confused about climate change.

40:03.546 --> 40:08.210
And believe it or not, these people's script is just as shitty as theirs.

40:08.631 --> 40:12.214
So it's our opportunity to offer the alternative

40:13.536 --> 40:36.244
Interpretation of American history interpret an alternative interpretation of the experience of the pandemic so that everybody can see through both the Trump administration and the Biden administration and See it as one continuous Illusion because that's what it is The first Trump administration the Biden administration.

40:36.284 --> 40:42.786
The second Trump administration is one continuous illusion It's not like Trump was good back then but now he's a shithead

40:46.291 --> 41:00.521
The way to understand it is he's always been on the same script, which was designed to do exactly what it did, which is cause half of the country to have, half of the world to have such a crazy opinion that they couldn't process his presence.

41:01.682 --> 41:04.324
Not that dissimilar to how they've done it with Palestine.

41:04.744 --> 41:08.446
Not that dissimilar to how they will do it with future issues to come.

41:10.568 --> 41:11.248
Holy shit.

41:12.049 --> 41:13.230
Are we gonna let this play or what?

41:16.939 --> 41:18.540
Oops, I got to get my mouse up here.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.103
And, you know, I have not changed and my values have not changed.

41:22.264 --> 41:26.227
And the policies that I've been advocating have not changed.

41:27.128 --> 41:30.511
But the party has just a knee jerk reaction against anything that is Trump.

41:31.392 --> 41:35.575
And you know that that, you know, President Trump's in this kind of are really paradoxical.

41:36.616 --> 41:45.544
position where he not only has completely taken over the Republican Party and dictates its platform, but he's also dictating the platform for the Democratic Party.

41:45.564 --> 41:46.165
I've noticed.

41:46.425 --> 41:51.649
Oh, if, you know, if I remember, I saw this for the first time on NAFTA.

41:52.630 --> 41:54.172
Democrats traditionally were against NAFTA.

41:54.192 --> 41:58.355
And as soon as President Trump came out against NAFTA, all the Democrats were now for NAFTA.

41:59.396 --> 42:00.978
The Democrats were the anti-war party.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.440
But as soon as he expressed his opposition to the Ukraine war,

42:04.082 --> 42:09.207
Now I would argue that this is already obvious admission that he's a traitor.

42:10.369 --> 42:21.160
I would say that because anybody that starts out an interview in 2025 with an explanation for why they used to be a Democrat but now they're not has to be a liar.

42:22.601 --> 42:24.063
Because that's hamster wheeling.

42:25.284 --> 42:25.744
Nobody

42:26.784 --> 42:34.667
as an adult needs to be reminded that the Democratic Party has been changing and going farther and farther left and lots of people have been leaving the Democratic Party.

42:34.687 --> 42:36.428
Nobody needs to be reminded of that.

42:36.848 --> 42:38.869
He doesn't need to recount that story.

42:39.329 --> 42:50.194
And as Health and Human Services Secretary, as a guy who's apparently been fighting this, whatever this is, for 20 years, he ought to be farther along in his elevator pitch

42:50.694 --> 42:57.025
than to start out with, I used to be a Democrat, because we've heard that like a thousand frickin' times already.

43:00.070 --> 43:00.871
What a fraud.

43:01.692 --> 43:03.916
They became the war party on the Democrats.

43:04.974 --> 43:18.424
traditionally were the biggest critics of the CIA and the intelligence agencies and as soon as President Trump started complaining about the power of the intelligence agencies in Washington, they became... Think about how imprecise that is.

43:18.985 --> 43:29.573
There are at least 18 intelligence agencies that are generally listed and yet all of them, all of them, all of them, Del Bigtree, Robert Malone,

43:31.730 --> 43:33.011
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:33.251 --> 43:37.432
All of them, all of them, all of them can only say three letters.

43:37.592 --> 43:39.213
C-I-A.

43:41.093 --> 43:44.115
They can only say C-I-A.

43:44.275 --> 43:45.235
Why is that?

43:46.736 --> 43:47.876
Because they're out of script.

43:48.456 --> 43:52.878
It's a really shitty script, but it's the same script that even Whitney Webb is on.

43:53.878 --> 43:55.319
CIA and stuff.

43:56.499 --> 43:57.740
Epstein and stuff.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.400
China and Russia and stuff.

44:00.441 --> 44:01.281
Holy shit.

44:02.264 --> 44:13.291
bonded with the intelligence agencies to the extent where they had, for the first time in history, a former CIA director speaking at their convention immediately before Kamala Harris.

44:14.371 --> 44:30.581
They were the party of free speech, and they became, you know, when President Trump started advocating for free speech and his ability to talk, you know, the shutdowns of him on Twitter and these other really crazy efforts to suppress the speech of a former president.

44:32.353 --> 44:38.334
He became a major advocate of free speech and the Democrats are now openly for censorship.

44:38.714 --> 44:41.915
The Democratic Party was the party of women's sports.

44:42.035 --> 44:50.576
My uncle wrote Title IX, making sure that women had the right to and had the equal access to the resources that they could play sports.

44:51.557 --> 44:58.998
And the Democratic Party has become the party that is now the enemy of women's sports.

44:59.958 --> 45:05.640
And you can go on and on with those examples, but President Trump is literally dictating them.

45:05.880 --> 45:22.925
I love the fact that he said this because again, Title IX and the whole XXXY thing is designed specifically to get you and me and everybody on both sides of the equation to argue that sex is genetic.

45:24.224 --> 45:27.045
Now you don't have to go, well, but it is, because it is, that's fine.

45:27.445 --> 45:35.206
But they want you to argue that sex is genetic in order to teach your children that the genes and the chromosomes are who you are.

45:38.147 --> 45:45.648
Because that's the way, that's the reason why they are pushing this trans women thing so far and so incorrectly.

45:46.088 --> 45:49.549
And I covered this yesterday on my show, but a very simple semantic

45:51.218 --> 46:12.438
Enchantment has taken place over the last five or eight years where they have instead of calling men Biological men who would like to be women and want to transition to being a woman instead of calling them transsexual men They're now calling them transsexual women and saying they're real women, too

46:13.539 --> 46:14.580
That's the enchantment.

46:15.161 --> 46:21.646
And you can dispel it in one fell swoop by just saying, no, I'm not going to call them trans women.

46:21.666 --> 46:22.567
They're trans men.

46:22.707 --> 46:24.069
And I'm not going to call them a woman.

46:24.509 --> 46:25.430
That's a trans man.

46:26.371 --> 46:27.111
That's what they are.

46:27.352 --> 46:30.294
It's a transitioning or a transitioned man.

46:30.554 --> 46:30.895
That's it.

46:33.496 --> 46:48.863
And once you realize that that's what it is, that's how English language works, then you realize that this debate about it is getting people to argue about one absurdity and one certainty, and eventually the absurdity will be accepted as absurd.

46:49.103 --> 46:50.984
Oh wow, I guess we went too far with that.

46:51.744 --> 46:59.748
Oh wow, I guess all these Hollywood people that are transing their kids when they're young, I guess that was too far, holy shit.

47:00.408 --> 47:01.309
And that's coming.

47:01.929 --> 47:03.389
Because that's how they govern you.

47:03.789 --> 47:11.431
They're swinging you back and forth between ridiculous possibilities so that you eventually all decide to choose the one.

47:11.451 --> 47:17.132
You know, like, swinging you between ridiculous possibilities where there's a lab leak or it was a natural virus.

47:17.532 --> 47:19.752
It's a gain of function, or it's a lab leak.

47:20.152 --> 47:22.073
Gain of function, or it's a lab leak.

47:22.093 --> 47:26.113
And by the end, oh my gosh, I guess it was a lab leak, or at least enough people think that.

47:28.314 --> 47:29.874
And so the same thing will happen here.

47:32.068 --> 47:34.349
Trans women, no they're not.

47:34.870 --> 47:36.731
Trans women, no they're not.

47:36.891 --> 47:40.954
And eventually, enough people will accept that everything is genetic.

47:40.994 --> 47:42.675
Genetic is the most important thing.

47:42.755 --> 47:43.755
Genes are everything.

47:44.256 --> 47:45.977
You need to surrender to your genes.

47:46.717 --> 47:49.399
And if enough people think that, then they've got the next step.

47:49.819 --> 47:50.680
That's what's coming.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.060
That's what this is about.

47:52.561 --> 47:53.401
That's the script.

47:53.761 --> 47:59.165
You have to be able to see far enough ahead in order for you to recognize that that's where they're taking us.

47:59.855 --> 48:04.697
but it's all about the Human Genome Project, so you can see that that would be the direction you would go.

48:05.397 --> 48:07.998
You're not gonna go to where it's a feeling.

48:08.338 --> 48:10.639
You're not gonna go to where it's up to you.

48:11.059 --> 48:22.363
It's up to your lived experience when the whole frickin' world is bent on teaching children that it all comes down to genes and the race and the phenotype.

48:23.844 --> 48:25.284
Come on, you can see it.

48:25.404 --> 48:26.465
I'm sure you can see it.

48:27.543 --> 48:30.705
platform of the Democratic Party, anything that he says they're going to be against.

48:31.626 --> 48:34.447
And, you know, that is also a departure from tradition.

48:34.487 --> 48:37.469
My father was very critical of partisanship.

48:38.390 --> 48:41.772
I remember him telling us when we were kids, I don't vote for the Democratic Republic.

48:41.812 --> 48:44.153
I vote for the person whoever is supposed to be best in the job.

48:47.055 --> 48:52.478
And that partisanship by its nature is dishonest and it is the enemy of democracy.

48:53.178 --> 48:55.980
And that in Washington, George Washington's farewell speech, he said that.

48:56.040 --> 49:04.184
He said he was very frightened about the rise of the political party because they would become self-interested rather than patriotic.

49:04.284 --> 49:06.586
They would become interested in promoting their own agendas.

49:07.907 --> 49:09.130
rather than the agenda of the country.

49:09.230 --> 49:16.547
And he thought that that was a real threat to American democracy and to this great experiment that we have in democracy.

49:18.968 --> 49:26.573
I remember your first break with the Democratic Party, and with personal friends, even members of your family, was a Rolling Stone piece that you wrote about autism, asking, why have autism rates risen?

49:26.593 --> 49:29.314
And you were kind of written out of police society for doing that.

49:29.334 --> 49:34.097
One of the first things you did as secretary, I think, tell me if I'm misstating it, is commissioned a kind of study of autism.

49:34.117 --> 49:35.158
Can you tell us what that is?

49:35.478 --> 49:37.600
What are you seeking to do with that?

49:37.960 --> 49:44.064
I think it's really important here to state once again that I have a slide that I didn't make until this year.

49:44.764 --> 49:48.287
that states that I think that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

49:48.407 --> 50:00.737
Now, I understand this in a very special way because I'm a neuroscientist, or used to be, and as an academic neuroscientist, you have to figure out what you want to study in order to figure out how you're going to write your grants to get money.

50:01.297 --> 50:03.098
You got to come up with a story on your own.

50:03.138 --> 50:08.180
You got to come up with a line of investigation or a series of investigations on your own.

50:08.900 --> 50:21.065
And you have to figure out a topic that not you are interested in so much as selecting from a list of topics that the NIH is interested in or that the EU Science Foundation is interested in.

50:22.543 --> 50:27.146
And so in doing that, every academic biologist has to find their way.

50:27.186 --> 50:40.435
And one of the ways that you can find your way in brain science is start to work on genetic disorders that result in living children, even if they have short lives,

50:41.394 --> 51:02.388
that it can generally blamed on a single gene because those genes are likely candidates for knockout mice or genetically modified mice, which can be claimed to be genetic models of that same genetic disorder, that rare disease in kids, which is often referred to as a rare disease, but it's not a rare disease.

51:02.568 --> 51:04.150
It is a genetic anomaly

51:04.890 --> 51:07.076
that manifests in a living human.

51:07.618 --> 51:11.949
And so this genetic anomaly has a set of phenotypes, it will have a set of

51:14.890 --> 51:19.811
metabolic pathways that are adjusted in some way to compensate for the loss of that gene.

51:20.232 --> 51:29.154
And so there's a tremendous amount of potential gain to be had understanding that little piece of the otherwise irreducibly complex biology of a human.

51:29.634 --> 51:34.456
And these rare disorders are the lowest hanging fruit of the

51:35.376 --> 51:38.602
the Human Genome Project, there is no lower hanging fruit.

51:39.043 --> 51:44.793
And in fact, for the last 10 years in neuroscience, those have been the low hanging fruit of

51:46.516 --> 51:51.440
genetic mice, of genetic knockout mice, of mouse models of human disease.

51:51.480 --> 52:06.552
You take, for example, Angelman syndrome, which is based solely on one genetic modification, you make that modification in mice, and then you study their behavior and do physiology on those mice, and you can argue that you're doing brain physiology on a

52:07.252 --> 52:23.560
model of a human disease which has some phenotypes which are similar to autism spectrum disorder because autism spectrum disorder is just a wide list of behavioral anomalies.

52:25.201 --> 52:34.285
And autism spectrum disorder is a giant classification umbrella under which a whole host of behavioral anomalies falls.

52:36.517 --> 52:54.062
And to then say so nonchalantly that this entire umbrella term of anomalies can be explained by vaccine damage is such an awful and malevolent trap for us to have fallen into because that's of course not the case.

52:54.222 --> 53:02.025
Most of what's grouped under current autism spectrum disorder cannot be vaccine injury.

53:03.165 --> 53:05.226
It's by definition, it's not possible.

53:06.212 --> 53:13.779
And that's why 2013 Brian Hooker didn't like the idea of causing, calling his son's condition autism.

53:13.819 --> 53:15.240
He didn't like the word autism.

53:15.641 --> 53:17.262
His son was vaccine damaged.

53:17.302 --> 53:31.455
He was neurologically damaged and he doesn't call it autism because that doesn't make sense with the irreducibly complex biology of humans and this, you know, huge

53:32.657 --> 53:56.576
collection of childhood anomalies, of, of, of, of odd forms of intelligence, of odd forms of social development, of maladaptive forms of development, of what we used to call retardation, cannot all be explained by intramuscular injection of a combination of substances, or there would be many more.

53:57.036 --> 53:57.917
Has it risen?

53:58.017 --> 53:58.337
Yes.

53:58.798 --> 54:00.959
Have we classified more people under it?

54:01.079 --> 54:01.380
Yes.

54:04.329 --> 54:11.315
But the trick here is to realize that if you call it autism, then they can call it autism.

54:11.395 --> 54:23.826
If they call it autism, then you're going to be ultimately wrong because most of the autism that we classify as autism is not caused by vaccines.

54:23.906 --> 54:25.327
It sucks, but it's true.

54:26.828 --> 54:29.531
Most of the damage done by vaccines is not autism.

54:29.571 --> 54:30.832
It's all kinds of other shit.

54:31.860 --> 54:35.223
It's a nearly endless bouquet of things.

54:36.924 --> 54:52.498
And that's why it's so easy to deny vaccine injury because doctors think they have to defend only one small little corner because autism spectrum disorder to them is obviously not explainable exclusively by vaccines.

54:52.878 --> 54:57.482
It's an absurd certainty and it's absurd generalization.

54:58.786 --> 55:00.067
And yet here he is making it.

55:00.167 --> 55:07.370
I think it's an absurd generalization that, that quite frankly, Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were probably not making.

55:10.851 --> 55:17.294
Again, we need to be very specific when we say that we don't see any autism in the Amish.

55:19.895 --> 55:25.738
We need to be very, very specific when we say that, because again, that's one of these simplifications that can become a trap.

55:29.440 --> 55:34.007
And if it's true, then why isn't this man...

55:36.821 --> 55:37.922
selling this book.

55:38.082 --> 55:43.766
I mean, after 20 years, you would think, okay, look, here's first and foremost, I've been doing this for 20 years.

55:44.646 --> 55:54.993
And Brian Hooker and I have published a book that clearly demonstrates that unvaxxed kids are so much more healthy than vaxxed kids, that we shouldn't even be having this stupid conversation anymore.

55:55.434 --> 55:58.616
But is that the argument that Bobby Kennedy is making?

55:58.676 --> 56:06.561
Or is he making the argument that there is autism, that autism is caused by vaccines, and they're just not doing the studies to show it?

56:08.422 --> 56:13.444
This is the most malevolent trap I could have ever imagined.

56:13.684 --> 56:22.248
And I really, really, really thought I was, I was, I really thought everything was going to change when he called me.

56:22.888 --> 56:28.951
And I definitely thought I was going to be able to do all kinds of great shit when I got hired at CHD.

56:31.712 --> 56:32.552
That's not what happened.

56:33.633 --> 56:34.433
We're here instead.

56:37.618 --> 56:42.941
Studies, there are a handful of studies that CDC has generated on autism.

56:42.961 --> 56:44.442
They were all epidemiological studies.

56:45.262 --> 56:48.624
And they all say what the CDC wanted them to say is they couldn't find a link.

56:49.444 --> 56:59.490
The problem is that the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, had said in 2001 that the link between autism vaccine is biologically plausible.

57:00.615 --> 57:17.281
And they were highly critical of the way that CDC was making the decisions about the vaccine schedule, that it was, you know, this group ACIP, which is an external panel, which has a responsibility of deciding which new vaccines will be added to the schedule.

57:17.882 --> 57:21.763
Now, keep in mind, essentially been captured by industry, the people who serve on that panel almost all

57:21.983 --> 57:30.527
Keep in mind that ASIP, what we watched and what we learned from ASIP, one of the things you should keep in mind is that ASIP is part of the legislation.

57:31.287 --> 57:38.791
And so the parliamentary procedure that goes on in the ASIP meeting essentially is the living law.

57:40.752 --> 57:43.953
And that's why they had to be very parliamentary about it.

57:44.033 --> 57:47.155
I second the motion, all in favor, you know, whatever.

57:48.590 --> 57:52.873
And so be precise with this, understand what we're dealing with.

57:52.953 --> 58:13.846
By putting Robert Malone and those people on that committee, and then having them basically pro forma approve all of the things that the CDC wanted to do, we now have everything we thought we were gonna get with the hero, Robert Malone, and with the hero, Retsef Levy, and with the hero, Robert F. Kennedy, and we have gotten nothing.

58:14.892 --> 58:19.476
They added a shot to the first six months of a kid's life.

58:19.536 --> 58:25.120
They added potentially monoclonal antibodies to the first eight months of a kid's life.

58:25.620 --> 58:27.121
They did nothing.

58:30.024 --> 58:35.728
And now he's talking with, with no specificity about what they're going to do next.

58:35.868 --> 58:42.994
And certainly not speaking like somebody who's been trying to sharpen this blade for 20 years now.

58:43.534 --> 58:44.555
I mean, this is a joke.

58:45.885 --> 58:46.905
It's a hamster wheel.

58:48.626 --> 58:52.487
They have financial entanglements with the industry.

58:53.447 --> 59:06.510
And the Institute of Medicine recommended a litany, a retinue of studies, including animal models, observational studies, bench studies, and epidemiological studies.

59:07.350 --> 59:10.031
They said, you need this whole retinue to answer this question.

59:10.051 --> 59:11.031
The CDC never did those.

59:11.892 --> 59:12.872
Instead, it commissioned

59:13.972 --> 59:34.635
the creation of these six epidemiological studies and none of them does what all of them are they use fraudulent techniques you know they say statistics don't lie but statisticians do and epidemiological studies are very easy to manipulate none of those studies did what you would want what you would do if you wanted to find the answer which is to compare outcomes in a fully vaccinated group to health outcomes in an unvaccinated group

59:35.977 --> 59:39.199
And CDC did that study in 1999.

59:40.040 --> 59:46.245
They brought in a team of scientists under a Belgian researcher named Thomas Verstratten.

59:47.256 --> 59:48.536
And they looked at the data.

59:48.556 --> 59:58.198
They looked at children who had received the hepatitis vaccine within the first 30 days of life and compared those children to children who had received the vaccine later or not at all.

59:59.099 --> 01:00:04.420
And they found an 11, 135% elevated risk of autism among the vaccinated children.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.280
And it shocked them.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.181
They kept the study secret and they manipulated it through five different iterations.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.021
to try to bury the link.

01:00:12.101 --> 01:00:13.422
And, you know, we know how they did it.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:17.904
They got rid of all the older children, essentially, and just had younger children who were too young to be diagnosed.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:21.925
And they stratified the data and they did a lot of other tricks.

01:00:22.925 --> 01:00:26.307
And all of those studies were the subject of that kind of trickery.

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:34.570
And so what we're going to do now, and meanwhile, the external literature is showing, you know, over 100 studies that show that there, indicate that there is a link.

01:00:36.313 --> 01:01:01.010
So what we're gonna do now is we're going to so it doesn't really make sense to me that that they have had a publishing company for at least 10 years Because in 2008 we were Skyhorse publishing is publishing about How he's gonna run independent and then he's gonna get Jesse Ventura in the White House and then Jesse Ventura is gonna get shot and Robert F Kennedy jr.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.852
Is gonna become president so a strange

01:01:04.753 --> 01:01:20.442
bookseller named Skyhorse Publishing that is now basically the publishing arm of CHD and the guy who runs Skyhorse is also the guy who like ran Bobby's campaign and also a genius and best friend of of Steve Bannon.

01:01:23.228 --> 01:01:28.230
And so they've had a book publishing company for more than 10 years at their disposal.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:33.212
And apparently there are a hundred papers that demonstrate there's a connection with autism.

01:01:33.692 --> 01:01:38.014
Apparently unvaccinated kids are really, really healthy.

01:01:38.354 --> 01:01:39.815
And when did they publish that book?

01:01:40.895 --> 01:01:40.996
In 2023.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.443
And are they selling it or are they selling Robert Malone's books?

01:01:48.463 --> 01:01:50.604
Or are they selling the Wuhan cover-up book?

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.486
Or are they selling the Anthony Fauci book more?

01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:56.788
Of course they're selling all of those more than this one.

01:02:00.441 --> 01:02:01.421
This is remarkable.

01:02:01.982 --> 01:02:06.163
I hope he recovers out of this nosedive, and I don't need to go further into this.

01:02:06.963 --> 01:02:08.584
The lies my gnome told me.

01:02:08.864 --> 01:02:11.365
All the kind of studies that the Institute of Medicine originally recommended.

01:02:12.265 --> 01:02:16.307
And we're going to do observational studies, retrospective studies, and epidemiological studies.

01:02:17.027 --> 01:02:18.267
We're going to do real science.

01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:22.229
And the way that we're going to do that is we're going to make the databases public for the first time.

01:02:23.394 --> 01:02:27.238
We've gone into CDC, we've gotten the data from CMS, which is Medicaid and Medicare.

01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:33.645
We're getting the data from the Vaccine Safety Data Link, which is the biggest repository for HMO health records.

01:02:33.686 --> 01:02:38.671
So those records would have all the records of vaccination and then the subsequent health claims.

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:41.694
And you can do a cluster analysis and look at, see if there's an association.

01:02:43.136 --> 01:02:50.062
And we're going to do some in-house studies ourselves, but more importantly, we're going to make this data available for independent scientists so everybody can look at it.

01:02:50.202 --> 01:02:56.387
And then we have already put out... So what's bizarre about this is that they've been in now for how many months?

01:02:58.049 --> 01:03:00.431
And he said he was going to have an answer by September.

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:07.999
So he had no, for 20 years he's been fighting this.

01:03:08.019 --> 01:03:11.401
Mary Holland's been at it for more than a decade and a half.

01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:41.024
Pauly Tommy's been been changing votes since 2000 or something like that and yet none of them have a real succinct way of testing this

01:03:43.072 --> 01:03:50.361
I thought CHD just figured out that sudden infant death syndrome has gone down drastically since the pandemic because of vaccine skepticism.

01:03:50.981 --> 01:04:02.755
So SIDS is supposedly due to vaccines because on the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation podcast of Steve Kirsch, none other than Pierre Kory was on there busting the lid on SIDS.

01:04:03.567 --> 01:04:13.849
Like a week after Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn shared the stream together to elucidate the fine biology of amyloidosis and clots.

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.131
It's all one malevolent script written by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone.

01:04:22.251 --> 01:04:23.832
And he can barely keep it straight.

01:04:25.332 --> 01:04:29.413
And so more and more he's just gonna look like a clown and sound like a clown.

01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:32.674
Because he's just a script reader.

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:36.597
He's not that sophisticated of a scholar.

01:04:40.139 --> 01:04:41.600
And we're in big trouble because of it.

01:04:42.861 --> 01:04:47.183
Take over the next six months, these large studies by independent scientists all over the world.

01:04:47.223 --> 01:04:51.685
We anticipate there'll probably be about 15 different major teams who are all trying to answer.

01:04:51.705 --> 01:04:52.846
15 teams are needed.

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:56.257
that are all gonna try to answer these big questions.

01:04:56.297 --> 01:05:00.939
This is the biggest joke of the pandemic so far.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:13.262
thousands.

01:05:13.282 --> 01:05:15.084
They will.

01:05:15.124 --> 01:05:16.085
Gotta sell stuff.

01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:18.426
My opinion, I always tell people, is irrelevant.

01:05:20.007 --> 01:05:22.830
We, you know, people, we need to stop.

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:29.935
Think about the fact that he's selling stuff between breaks of the Health and Human Services Secretary of America.

01:05:30.455 --> 01:05:33.397
Think about how serious that makes him about this, right?

01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:39.062
He's so serious that he's selling masa chips to you before you listen to more.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:06:07.354
trusting the experts right we were told at the beginning of covid don't look at any data yourself don't do any investigation yourself just trust the experts and trusting the experts is not oh is he gonna do the jimmy door bit about uh buying a used car now are we serious are you serious here come on come on robert like do better than this because this is now sad this is pathetic hamster wheeling

01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:10.984
It's not a feature of science.

01:06:11.285 --> 01:06:12.627
It's not a feature of democracy.

01:06:12.647 --> 01:06:16.655
It's a feature of religion and it's a feature of totalitarianism.

01:06:17.466 --> 01:06:25.169
In democracies, we have the obligation, and it's one of the burdens of citizenship, to do our own research and make our own determinations about things.

01:06:25.229 --> 01:06:28.591
Mothers, when they go shopping, they don't trust the advertising.

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:30.512
A good mother does not trust the advertising.

01:06:30.552 --> 01:06:32.372
They don't trust what they hear.

01:06:32.412 --> 01:06:34.553
They do their own research, and it's a much harder way to live.

01:06:34.613 --> 01:06:38.535
But, you know, that is one of the burdens of living in a democracy is that we, you know, we do.

01:06:38.635 --> 01:06:42.897
And so what he is suggesting, but not saying, is that we can't trust our government.

01:06:44.437 --> 01:06:51.812
See, not trusting advertisers is one thing, but not trusting your government is another thing, and he doesn't seem to be able to differentiate that.

01:06:53.137 --> 01:06:55.638
He doesn't seem to be able to differentiate that.

01:06:56.158 --> 01:07:10.323
And that's a very big problem because if our side is trapped in an illusion where we can't differentiate between those two very different things, then we also have a problem that's easily exploitable by the shitheads on the other side.

01:07:10.783 --> 01:07:19.746
And I guarantee you on their portions of social media, on their portions of the mainstream media, they are lambasting us for this ridiculousness.

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:22.838
It is absolutely happening right now.

01:07:23.678 --> 01:07:28.059
We are being made fools of, and you can't see it because you're skillfully using social media.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.521
Our own research, we make up our own minds, and that's the way it should be done.

01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:43.865
And we're going to give people gold standard science, we're going to publish our protocols in advance, we're going to tell people what we're doing, and then we're going to use data and we're going to publish

01:07:44.965 --> 01:08:14.204
The peer reviews which is never published by CDC studies We're gonna publish any time that we can The raw data and the worst part about this gold standard science idea is that make no mistake about it the FDA by not regulating as individual medical devices all of the PCR diagnostics in America and instead allowing them to go on under a continuation of approval from the original EU a's and

01:08:15.706 --> 01:08:17.627
We are being lost.

01:08:17.987 --> 01:08:25.709
We are losing that opportunity to show that PCR is not a gold standard diagnostic.

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:32.411
But he's using these words to describe something right now that he's going to deliver.

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:36.813
And in no way, shape, or form will he or the FDA ever question

01:08:38.516 --> 01:08:44.300
the foundation of that mythology, that this diagnostic standard is not a standard at all.

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.021
We have been bamboozled.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:09:00.190
And that's because he's on the script that's written by these people who want us to be bamboozled specifically about the PCR testing, about sequencing, about genetics, and about the ability of RNA to pandemic.

01:09:02.131 --> 01:09:07.852
And then we're going to require replication of every study, which never happens in NIH now.

01:09:07.912 --> 01:09:09.313
That's something new that we're bringing in.

01:09:09.873 --> 01:09:11.913
No, he's going to bring in replication.

01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:18.315
So that's... That's a pretty hilarious joke.

01:09:20.075 --> 01:09:21.776
Because it is...

01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:26.852
It's not as big a problem as you think.

01:09:26.892 --> 01:09:28.854
We'll probably have to do a whole other show about that.

01:09:28.914 --> 01:09:30.375
I won't belabor that point.

01:09:31.156 --> 01:09:32.937
Is that every study will be replicated?

01:09:33.177 --> 01:09:34.938
I thought that was like a basic precept of science.

01:09:34.978 --> 01:09:37.921
We can't know something unless the experiment showing it can be replicated.

01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:39.262
Script warning!

01:09:39.362 --> 01:09:40.182
Script warning!

01:09:40.202 --> 01:09:41.403
It's a precept of science.

01:09:41.543 --> 01:09:46.787
And unfortunately, it has the kind of science that was done by NIH.

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:49.509
You know, NIH was the gold standard agency when I was a kid.

01:09:50.630 --> 01:10:08.096
But they stopped doing that and it incentivized a lot of cheating and the reason it incentivizes cheating is that If you're a son again, it's this a specificity it inspires cheating and for an academic scientist to cheat does it really hurt that much does you know if

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:12.541
There's some fake nutrition data out there that makes a fake news program.

01:10:12.581 --> 01:10:13.602
Is that really that bad?

01:10:13.803 --> 01:10:14.263
I don't know.

01:10:14.704 --> 01:10:25.898
But what if the national security state decided to fake a bunch of science and make believe that RNA could pandemic, that gain-of-function viruses were a danger, and that people were making them?

01:10:27.008 --> 01:10:30.109
Now that would be a very different kind of fake science, wouldn't it, Bobby?

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:45.936
But just like he's been scripted, he's gonna try and get all the kids to think that what we need to do is burn down all the scientists and take down all the labs because all these lab people are liars, all these biologists are liars, all these doctors are liars.

01:10:48.137 --> 01:10:52.419
And then it starts to become not even about the profit of pharmaceutical companies, right?

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:56.261
Because the academicians are willing to lie about their science.

01:10:57.717 --> 01:11:11.361
And all the while, we're not going to talk about how, by perverting the university incentive system, it made it very easy for incentives to be put in place for specific lies to be laid down.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:19.803
Specific lies that were useful to the Human Genome Project into inverting our sovereignty into experimental animal status.

01:11:22.148 --> 01:11:24.491
This is how malevolent this script is.

01:11:24.631 --> 01:11:31.039
And if this guy doesn't get it, which I'm sure he doesn't, he's just going to keep reading the script and he's going to read it very well.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:35.806
Scientists, your career depends on how much you publish.

01:11:36.986 --> 01:11:52.978
And so if you have a hypothesis and you say, this is my hypothesis, this is the study that I want to do, and you get a grant from NIH, and the hypothesis turns out to be wrong, you know, the science does not support it, a lot of times you cannot get that study published.

01:11:53.638 --> 01:11:54.219
That's science.

01:11:54.599 --> 01:12:01.084
It's science when you, you know, a null hypothesis is science and it ought to be published, but the journals won't do it.

01:12:01.224 --> 01:12:03.706
And also the journals won't publish anything that is,

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:18.450
Well, that's also very inaccurate because null hypothesis testing is the shitty part of science because, again, as I've explained and somebody like Matt Briggs explains better than me, the null hypothesis is usually stupid to begin with.

01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:23.492
And that's the problem with a lot of these studies.

01:12:23.732 --> 01:12:29.254
The null hypothesis of vaccines is that they work great and some vaccines might work better.

01:12:31.294 --> 01:12:36.738
This imprecision is unacceptable after 20 years of being a crusader.

01:12:37.159 --> 01:12:48.608
This lack of precision after being 20 years supposedly running for, you know, wanting to be president, this lack of precision is evidence of a scripted fraud.

01:12:49.488 --> 01:12:51.790
It's critical of vaccines.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.252
They won't do it because there's so much pressure on them.

01:12:55.493 --> 01:13:03.038
They're funded by the pharmaceutical companies and they'll lose advertising, they'll lose revenue from reprints if they don't do that.

01:13:03.058 --> 01:13:11.282
So even Marsha Engel, who was a long time, I think 25 years at the New England Journal of Medicine, she said, you can't believe anything that's in the scientific journals anymore.

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:14.664
Richard Horton, who's the longtime editor of The Lancet, is the same thing.

01:13:14.684 --> 01:13:17.186
He says, we've become propaganda vessels for the pharmaceutical companies.

01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:34.976
I think with regard to the transgender thing, another thing to consider is what are the relative abundance of these two genotypes?

01:13:37.017 --> 01:13:40.759
Because these two genotypes are essentially hidden in our populations.

01:13:42.159 --> 01:13:43.320
This is a super male.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.521
This is a Kleinfelter.

01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:54.135
Like, where are these people if most people are not sequenced?

01:13:57.717 --> 01:13:58.878
Because these are the real

01:14:00.279 --> 01:14:14.247
what I would have called transgender intersex kind of people that actually might want to have some kind of surgery because they're sterile and because their genitals don't function like they're supposed to function.

01:14:15.587 --> 01:14:27.834
This is the biology that gets confused away by the argument of man or woman and a gender spectrum completely ignores the fact that there is genetic intersex.

01:14:29.195 --> 01:14:37.180
and that there are people alive right now, a certain percentage of our population alive right now, it doesn't even know that they're intersex.

01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:43.463
And that part of the biology is completely absent from the discussion.

01:14:44.544 --> 01:14:46.345
Because of course, that's coming, right?

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:52.228
Oh, oh, by the way, we should sequence everybody and figure out.

01:14:53.509 --> 01:14:57.171
Now, I understand that a lot of times people are karyotyped

01:14:58.416 --> 01:15:00.557
And karyotyping will also find this.

01:15:00.657 --> 01:15:06.698
You will also find the triple X girls as well with karyotyping.

01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:11.539
But this is missing from the discussion.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.821
It's missing from the reality that those people are out there because they are.

01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:23.464
The pharmaceutical company, now you have to pay to get something published in these journals.

01:15:24.265 --> 01:15:26.186
And so the pharmaceutical companies pay for something.

01:15:26.326 --> 01:15:38.931
They give a, you know, they hire these, you know, these mercenary scientists, we call them biostitutes, to do a study that will validate their product and, you know, say that this statin drug works against heart attacks and they'll mess with the data because they want it published.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.692
They're being paid by the pharmaceutical companies.

01:15:41.758 --> 01:15:47.025
And then once it's published, the journal will make available preprints.

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:51.792
The preprint is a little, like a little magazine with the logo of the Lancet on the front.

01:15:52.693 --> 01:15:56.518
And it has that one article that says the statin drug works or this SSRI works.

01:15:57.435 --> 01:16:06.302
And then they have tens of thousands of pharmaceutical reps who will take those journal articles and go to every doctor's office in the country and say, you know, and they're usually, let me put it this way.

01:16:06.322 --> 01:16:10.045
And so he could stop right here and say, you know, you heard of Vioxx before, right?

01:16:10.485 --> 01:16:17.451
There's this friend of mine who's dead now named Brandy Vaughn and her, one of her main, you know, sort of, she was a whistleblower about that.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:21.153
And the way that she would explain it is X, Y, and Z, but he's not going to say that.

01:16:22.735 --> 01:16:25.097
He's not going to say that because he's not a good man.

01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:27.687
He's a scripted performer.

01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:31.189
And he's performing with Tucker Carlson.

01:16:31.289 --> 01:16:35.750
Hot looking women or, you know, and they'll go take the doctor out to lunch.

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.951
They'll say, you know, why don't you start prescribing this drug?

01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:41.632
And they'll incentivize the doctor in all kinds of ways to do that.

01:16:41.832 --> 01:16:46.153
And so the doctors also have their own incentives, you know, perverse incentives.

01:16:47.533 --> 01:16:55.096
There's a published article out there now that says that 50% of revenues to most pediatricians come from vaccines.

01:16:56.296 --> 01:17:08.443
And then there's a whole structure where Blue Cross and the other insurance companies pay bonuses to the pediatrician to make sure if, for example, 95% of their, if their clients are fully vaccinated, they get a huge bonus.

01:17:08.503 --> 01:17:09.864
It could be tens of thousands of dollars.

01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:21.070
And that's why your pediatrician, if you say, I want to go slow on the vaccines, or I want to have a little different schedule, your pediatrician will throw you out of his practice because you're now jeopardizing that bonus structure.

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.712
And these are all perverse incentives that stop doctors from acting

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.723
It's a strange thing to not say in front of Congress when you're confronted with this stuff.

01:17:30.823 --> 01:17:38.086
When you have a three hour session where you're asked questions about this stuff and you don't bring this up.

01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:48.671
It's kind of like, I don't know, going on the Joe Rogan podcast and being asked about smallpox and not giving an answer very succinctly like you did maybe five years before.

01:17:50.812 --> 01:17:51.953
Like Susan Humphreys did.

01:17:56.246 --> 01:18:00.029
The fact of the matter is, is that the old videos of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:00.049 --> 01:18:09.876
are being weaponized against us on social media because on social media they can be shown to us and help to form an illusion that this guy is doing something good.

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:16.901
But if you listen to his words and his performance in the current act, currently on stage,

01:18:17.737 --> 01:18:22.779
you will see that he can only be interpreted as on script.

01:18:23.159 --> 01:18:26.660
At any moment, he could say that there is no safe vaccine.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.021
At any moment, he could say, I've never believed in vaccines.

01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:31.722
I've been saying that to get here.

01:18:35.063 --> 01:18:40.604
And plant trees under whose shade he will never shelter, but our grandchildren could.

01:18:41.004 --> 01:18:42.285
But he's not gonna say that.

01:18:43.882 --> 01:18:47.905
that I've been toeing the line, that I've been playing 5D chess, but you know what?

01:18:47.965 --> 01:18:50.627
The reality is, I don't think there is a safe vaccine.

01:18:51.307 --> 01:19:00.073
And that's the same omission that the traitor to our grandchildren, Suzanne Humphreys, made when she went on Rogan this year.

01:19:00.233 --> 01:19:02.795
For two and a half hours, she couldn't frickin' say it.

01:19:04.133 --> 01:19:24.382
She is a traitor and a fraud who only said it on stage and on camera when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive because she and Robert Kennedy and Judy Mikovits and fricking Mary Holland were put in place to step in front of those women.

01:19:25.202 --> 01:19:29.544
And those women were killed at the beginning of the pandemic to make sure that they wouldn't screw it up.

01:19:31.724 --> 01:19:35.668
Just suck it up and realize that's where we are in American history right now.

01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:39.552
You want to talk about JFK Jr.

01:19:39.612 --> 01:19:51.484
coming back, you better first accept that Brandi and Tony were killed by this fake health freedom movement, very specifically on the chance that Bobby Kennedy might even be the vice president of Donald Trump.

01:19:53.619 --> 01:19:59.383
practicing medicine and caring for the client because they're looking at the bottom line.

01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:03.567
20 years ago, 20% of the doctors in this country worked for corporations.

01:20:04.547 --> 01:20:05.108
Today, 80% do.

01:20:06.048 --> 01:20:10.071
And that corporation is telling you, you know, we don't care what happens to your patient.

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:13.094
You know, we care about how much revenue you're generating.

01:20:14.194 --> 01:20:21.460
And, you know, these doctors are coming out of medical schools with ginormous bills that will bankrupt them if they don't have a job.

01:20:22.566 --> 01:20:26.829
And so they're under tremendous pressure just to keep generating those funds.

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:35.473
And the whole system, as you know, it's just a bundle of perverse incentives where everybody is making money by keeping us sick.

01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:42.157
And I'm not saying that's deliberate or purposeful or planned in any way.

01:20:42.317 --> 01:20:44.579
It's just the incentive system that everybody makes money.

01:20:45.599 --> 01:20:47.020
Insurance companies make money if you're sick.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.982
Ironically, they make more money if the population

01:20:50.777 --> 01:20:57.062
According to Wikipedia, intersex is a general term for organisms that have sex characteristics between male and female.

01:20:57.082 --> 01:21:05.388
It typically applies to a minority of members of gonocoric animal species, such as mammals, as opposed to hermaphroditic species.

01:21:05.969 --> 01:21:09.731
So gonocoric species apparently are species that have defined sexes.

01:21:11.253 --> 01:21:13.676
And such organisms are usually sterile.

01:21:14.877 --> 01:21:22.806
Intersex has occurred from both genetic and environmental factors and has been reported in mammals, fish, nematodes and crustaceans.

01:21:23.487 --> 01:21:27.892
There are intersex pigs that are known up to 1.4% of pigs can be intersex.

01:21:31.034 --> 01:21:37.557
In Venatu, Navarug pigs are sacred intersex pigs found on Mahalo Island.

01:21:38.758 --> 01:21:45.800
The analysis of Navari pig mitochondrial DNA found that they are descended from East Southeast Asian pigs.

01:21:46.481 --> 01:21:51.703
Female spotted hyenas have a pseudopenis which has led to the myth that they are hermaphroditic.

01:21:55.024 --> 01:22:07.688
So they're describing a couple different intersex things, but they're not talking about the actual XY chromosomes.

01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:08.868
So that's interesting.

01:22:12.869 --> 01:22:17.411
In cattle, a free martin is the infertile female twin of a bull.

01:22:19.039 --> 01:22:26.805
Freemartins have both XX and XY chromosomes, non-functional ovaries, and exhibit masculine behavior.

01:22:26.845 --> 01:22:29.847
So apparently in cows there are some.

01:22:29.887 --> 01:22:33.750
I apologize for not being more up on the ability to answer that question.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.051
Here's the link that I'm reading right now.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:42.796
Don't take Wikipedia for anything serious, but you know, I mean, there's some truth on Wikipedia.

01:22:42.836 --> 01:22:43.517
They got to do that.

01:22:45.225 --> 01:22:47.646
is sick, and you know, that may seem counterintuitive to people.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:23:02.515
And a guy said to me once who worked for AIG, one of the big insurance companies, he said, I said, I want to go with some data to AIG and show them that, you know, what they're doing is actually, I can show them on paper, what they're doing is actually making their people sicker.

01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:06.777
And they're the one group that you would think would want healthy people because they'd have to pay out less.

01:23:07.658 --> 01:23:13.281
And this guy said to me, think of it this way, if you're Lloyd's of London, and you insure all the shipping in the world,

01:23:14.369 --> 01:23:17.611
Is it better for you if one ship sinks a year or if 500 sink a year?

01:23:18.132 --> 01:23:21.214
And I said to him, it's better if only one sinks.

01:23:21.975 --> 01:23:25.057
And he said, no, it's better if 500 sink because then everybody has to get insurance.

01:23:25.197 --> 01:23:27.999
And what the insurance companies are collecting money at is friction.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.242
Oh, they're taking a cut of the revenues that come through them.

01:23:31.282 --> 01:23:34.324
The more people that buy insurance, it doesn't matter what the claims are.

01:23:34.364 --> 01:23:36.085
If the claims are high, they just raise their premiums.

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:40.027
And it's the amount of money that flows in the system that gives them money.

01:23:40.067 --> 01:23:41.128
So they're making money that way.

01:23:41.168 --> 01:23:42.908
The doctors are making money from keeping us sick.

01:23:43.969 --> 01:23:45.890
The hospitals are making money from keeping us sick.

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:57.174
The pharmaceutical companies are making money from... Now, there's no doubt that everybody's making money, but the question is, is why is the system set up to facilitate these people making money in such a disingenuous way?

01:23:57.734 --> 01:24:04.557
And the reason why is because we are in the process of having our sovereignty inverted into experimental animal status.

01:24:05.549 --> 01:24:08.311
And in order to do that, they need to do it like boiling a frog.

01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:09.451
They need to do it slow.

01:24:10.332 --> 01:24:12.233
And this is part of it.

01:24:12.734 --> 01:24:18.217
The Trump administration has always been part of it, just like the Biden administration was part of it.

01:24:18.357 --> 01:24:20.919
This is all one malevolent show.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:32.442
run by the Human Genome Project, maybe by who could be better characterized as Democrats and communists and globalists than anything else.

01:24:33.223 --> 01:24:35.264
They're not Democrats or Republicans.

01:24:35.344 --> 01:24:37.565
There's something outside of that.

01:24:38.906 --> 01:24:41.447
The Democrat-Republican thing is the show they do.

01:24:43.228 --> 01:24:49.631
So every level of the system is incentivized financially, no matter what your intention is as a doctor.

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:51.352
If you're a doctor, of course you don't want sick patients.

01:24:52.606 --> 01:24:57.869
There's tremendous pressure from every angle of the system to actually, you know, to keep us all sick.

01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:01.271
And we're now the sickest nation in the world.

01:25:01.732 --> 01:25:04.113
Last year, we did an interview with a woman called Casey Means.

01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:05.914
She's a surgeon educated at Stanford.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:06.715
She's a huge food.

01:25:07.775 --> 01:25:12.178
Best thing you levels membership to this show's listeners.

01:25:12.778 --> 01:25:14.800
So he's advertising for levels.

01:25:15.686 --> 01:25:19.807
which is the same thing that they were discussing on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

01:25:19.827 --> 01:25:26.649
So Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying basically promoting levels and the means twins.

01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:30.511
And then now they're doing the same thing here as an advertisement.

01:25:30.531 --> 01:25:32.871
They're fricking sponsoring Tucker Carlson.

01:25:32.931 --> 01:25:33.852
Are you shitting me?

01:25:33.872 --> 01:25:38.033
Well, you're New York Times president ban you from Rolling Stone, et cetera, attack you as a Nazi.

01:25:39.295 --> 01:25:47.082
You made the point years later that the reason that happened was because pharmaceutical companies are the single biggest source of revenue for a lot of media companies and they're buying the protection with that money.

01:25:47.102 --> 01:25:48.664
That's another perverse incentive, right?

01:25:49.124 --> 01:25:49.565
Absolutely.

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:52.107
I think we're one of only two countries in the world that allow that.

01:25:52.407 --> 01:25:53.068
Can that be stopped?

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.003
That's a question that we are looking at right now.

01:25:59.163 --> 01:26:09.934
You know, and there's a bad Supreme Court case from a couple of years ago that gave essentially anointed pharmaceutical advertising with First Amendment protection.

01:26:11.343 --> 01:26:13.465
The First Amendment protects political speech.

01:26:13.665 --> 01:26:21.712
So if you're saying something political, you should have absolute protection under the First Amendment.

01:26:22.033 --> 01:26:24.315
Commercial speech has a lower level of protection.

01:26:25.593 --> 01:26:36.879
And the pharmaceutical advertising was regulated as commercial speech and it was until 1990, really around 1992, you didn't see pharmaceutical adverts.

01:26:36.899 --> 01:26:39.401
There was no direct-to-consumer advertising on TV.

01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:46.625
And after that and then there were more changes made in 1997, that's when it became, you know, it exploded.

01:26:47.642 --> 01:26:56.551
Today, Roger Ailes, who both you and I knew, you know, I had this very, Roger Ailes for your audience who doesn't know him, which I think most of them do, was the founder of Fox News.

01:26:57.112 --> 01:27:05.780
And I had this odd relationship with him because politically we were at loggerheads, but I had spent, when I was 19 years old, I spent three months with him in a tent in Africa.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.984
And I, and we developed a friendship then.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:15.006
I had originally said that that was Jeffrey Sachs, so I apologize, but now he's telling you it was Ailes.

01:27:15.266 --> 01:27:17.989
And as you know, he was very, you know, he was a very engaging guy.

01:27:18.389 --> 01:27:20.591
He was very witty, really fun to be with.

01:27:21.647 --> 01:27:23.727
I'm very paranoid, but at the same time, brilliant.

01:27:24.868 --> 01:27:28.589
And so he was very kind to me.

01:27:28.609 --> 01:27:30.129
He was a very loyal friend to me.

01:27:30.309 --> 01:27:41.211
And he would make Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and Neil Cavuto and all of the other hosts, your former colleagues, put me on TV to talk about the environment, even though he didn't agree with me on it, he made them put me on.

01:27:42.192 --> 01:27:46.252
So during the 80s and 90s, I was the only environmentalist who was going on Fox News.

01:27:47.293 --> 01:27:48.633
But I brought him one time this

01:27:49.463 --> 01:27:53.265
So does that sound like okay?

01:27:53.525 --> 01:27:58.789
That he's the only environmentalist that was allowed on Fox News by his very good friend Ailes?

01:27:58.849 --> 01:28:02.851
Or does that sound like he's already being set up to be put where he is now?

01:28:03.431 --> 01:28:05.132
You see, he's naive.

01:28:06.193 --> 01:28:11.256
He's actually so unsophisticated that he doesn't understand that he's been played for his whole life.

01:28:12.096 --> 01:28:15.018
He actually can't see the Truman Show that he's a victim of.

01:28:15.118 --> 01:28:16.239
I'm pretty convinced of it.

01:28:17.236 --> 01:28:26.303
I mean, the other thing that it could be is that he's an amazing actor and that he knows he's selling our grandchildren to the slavers.

01:28:26.403 --> 01:28:27.304
It's one or the other.

01:28:27.484 --> 01:28:29.806
And I think it's more likely that he's just a dope.

01:28:32.548 --> 01:28:39.031
around, I think it was like 2014, I brought him a documentary that we had done about mercury and vaccines.

01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:45.094
And he had, he watched it, he was completely sold on it.

01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:48.055
He had a family member who had been affected, he felt.

01:28:48.855 --> 01:28:51.817
And he said, I can't put you on because if I did,

01:28:53.102 --> 01:28:56.484
If any of my hosts allowed you on to talk about this issue, I would have to fire them.

01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:59.125
And if I didn't, I would get a call from Rupert within 10 minutes.

01:29:00.166 --> 01:29:05.249
And he said, for the evening news division, about 75% of the advertising revenues are coming from pharma.

01:29:05.309 --> 01:29:18.196
And then he told me something that, if I remember it correctly, he... So he would have saved millions of children from the shitty vaccine schedule had the pharmaceutical companies not kept him off of Fox News.

01:29:19.376 --> 01:29:20.377
It's something like that.

01:29:21.613 --> 01:29:31.603
Otherwise, we would have been here a long time ago, because him and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker had the goods already 10 years ago, but they've just been censored for 10 years.

01:29:31.703 --> 01:29:35.827
So effectively, they've effectively saved no children.

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:43.024
That's right, that's the story he's telling in 2025, because he is a fraud and a traitor on a script.

01:29:43.184 --> 01:29:49.930
He said that on a typical evening news show, there are 22 ads, and 17 of those are pharmaceutical ads.

01:29:51.071 --> 01:29:52.772
And so this was the principal source of revenue.

01:29:52.812 --> 01:29:55.014
And for a lot of these television networks, it's keeping them alive.

01:29:55.054 --> 01:29:57.356
As you know, they're all kind of collapsing financially.

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:59.758
Collapsing due to lack of popular demand for their presence.

01:29:59.778 --> 01:29:59.918
Right.

01:30:00.619 --> 01:30:01.480
So could you end that?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.463
Do you have the authority as the Secretary of Health and Human Services to say no more pharma ads on television?

01:30:05.723 --> 01:30:12.424
Well, a lot of the pharmaceutical ads are misleading.

01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:13.684
Yeah.

01:30:14.385 --> 01:30:21.026
And even the music and the... Do you have the authority, Bobby?

01:30:21.086 --> 01:30:21.866
It's a question.

01:30:21.906 --> 01:30:27.627
You know, like when Joe Rogan asked Suzanne Humphreys, were there any good vaccines and she didn't answer?

01:30:27.967 --> 01:30:33.608
He's not answering the question now because he's a traitor on a script and he doesn't want you to figure it out.

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.410
The video, the photos that they show the scene.

01:30:36.471 --> 01:30:45.179
Have you seen the video of AOC asking him questions about the investigation into UnitedHealthcare and the Medicare fraud that they're guilty of?

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.542
Have you seen that video?

01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:53.588
Because on the other side of America, that's going around like wildfire and everybody's watching him choke.

01:30:54.733 --> 01:31:11.256
As she said, do you realize that like the largest source of waste, fraud, and abuse in the American government is Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and that the Department of Justice is investigating the largest healthcare provider in America, United Healthcare, for Medicare fraud?

01:31:11.676 --> 01:31:14.077
And he said, no, I'm not aware of that.

01:31:15.597 --> 01:31:17.938
And she was able to say, but that's your jurisdiction.

01:31:17.978 --> 01:31:19.958
Those people are, that's your job.

01:31:19.978 --> 01:31:20.938
You're not aware of that?

01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.599
He said again, no, I'm not aware of that.

01:31:24.608 --> 01:31:54.085
then later on in the discussion she says that it's about 81 billion dollars and he says 81 million or 81 billion and she's allowed to say no it's 81 billion a year with a b and you're not aware of it and so while we're watching tucker carlson thinking that the word is getting out he's getting trounced and they are making fools of the trump administration right now on every front

01:31:55.205 --> 01:31:59.585
and we're blissfully unaware of it because on X, it looks like everybody's kicking ass.

01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:07.114
that they show are, that's kind of speech, and it's misleading.

01:32:07.174 --> 01:32:07.954
It's sending a message.

01:32:08.895 --> 01:32:15.221
And if you take this drug, you're going to be riding jet skis and playing volleyball and water skiing.

01:32:15.322 --> 01:32:17.904
Have a great looking spouse, happy kids.

01:32:18.645 --> 01:32:23.029
The side effects, meanwhile, are rolling at 80 miles an hour, and that's misleading.

01:32:23.409 --> 01:32:28.494
And so one of the things that we're looking at is making them

01:32:29.955 --> 01:32:33.598
You know the other thing that's wrong with this shithead argument?

01:32:33.618 --> 01:32:35.619
How many people are watching network news?

01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:36.920
How many people are watching network anything anymore?

01:32:58.342 --> 01:32:59.703
Like, this is ridiculous.

01:32:59.803 --> 01:33:06.285
The only people who are still watching TV with advertisements and commercials are boomers.

01:33:08.186 --> 01:33:15.269
My children don't even know how to get the TV to accept the airwaves and what channels are available.

01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:22.312
They don't know that there's channel 11, channel 4, and channel 2, and channel 52 in Pittsburgh.

01:33:23.237 --> 01:33:23.878
They don't know?

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:29.643
They don't know what channel Fox is or what channel NBC is or what channel ABC News is?

01:33:30.103 --> 01:33:38.130
Do you know how long it took them to find ABC for the NBA Finals in my living room when we have a TV that can just do it out of the air?

01:33:38.731 --> 01:33:40.092
It took them like two hours!

01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:56.152
So who is he saving from pharmaceutical ads when our children are watching YouTube and are sharing videos on fricking Snapchat?

01:33:56.413 --> 01:33:58.174
What kind of bullshit is this?

01:33:58.854 --> 01:33:59.555
Guys, it's nothing.

01:34:00.816 --> 01:34:04.898
People who come over here from England or Europe and watch our TV are shocked by what they're seeing on it.

01:34:05.078 --> 01:34:06.459
And it's insidious because of this.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.102
The pharmaceutical advertisers are advertising the most expensive version of every drug.

01:34:12.183 --> 01:34:14.385
They're not going to advertise the generics because they're not making any money.

01:34:14.445 --> 01:34:17.348
So they're advertising the ones that are the highest profit margins for them.

01:34:18.409 --> 01:34:26.436
And normally if you see an advertisement on TV, like for Coca-Cola, you then have a choice to go get that and then you're paying out of your pocket for it.

01:34:27.417 --> 01:34:31.241
When somebody buys a pharmaceutical drug, it's Medicaid.

01:34:33.683 --> 01:34:35.725
You have 11 minutes with each patient and go away.

01:34:37.585 --> 01:34:38.567
This is good for public health.

01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:41.291
It is hurting us and it's distorting the markets.

01:34:41.632 --> 01:34:47.321
And it is not it's not a you can't even call it a free market because everything's paid for by the federal government.

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:49.204
So here's a company where important.

01:34:49.865 --> 01:34:51.407
So I like that argument that he's raised.

01:34:53.052 --> 01:34:55.332
that all pharmaceutical ads do is.

01:34:55.372 --> 01:34:57.153
Now show they were injured by this product.

01:34:57.913 --> 01:34:58.593
How were they made whole?

01:34:58.633 --> 01:34:59.233
What happens to them?

01:35:00.433 --> 01:35:01.334
If it becomes clear that.

01:35:01.954 --> 01:35:03.834
Tucker 76 for 15% off your first order.

01:35:04.114 --> 01:35:05.714
That's merryweatherfarms.com.

01:35:05.814 --> 01:35:12.816
So I like that idea that he says that pharmaceutical advertising just drives people to go to their doctor and ask for shit.

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:19.157
And since it's all paid for by insurance anyway, and a lot of that's the federal government because of Obamacare,

01:35:19.677 --> 01:35:27.260
then in the end the pharmaceutical advertising is just driving up the cost of and stealing money from Medicare and that's absolutely true.

01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:38.285
But he's not going to tell you that Medicare has been under such high pressure because of a population pyramid and because of an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that we've been worrying about for the last 20 years.

01:35:38.865 --> 01:35:42.667
That is for sure something that these two frauds are not going to tell you.

01:35:42.707 --> 01:35:47.509
So now let's not talk about 2020 and let's talk about the COVID shots being bad.

01:35:48.689 --> 01:36:01.998
So if, starting in September, when we start to see the results of the analysis of these massive data sets that you're putting out there in public, and if it becomes clear that there is a connection between autism and vaccines, vaccines the government promoted, in some cases, effectively required,

01:36:02.844 --> 01:36:03.324
That's a tort.

01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:07.587
I mean, that means there are a lot of injured people who can now show they were injured by this product.

01:36:08.347 --> 01:36:09.028
How were they made whole?

01:36:09.068 --> 01:36:09.688
What happens to them?

01:36:10.209 --> 01:36:20.115
Well, that's going to be complicated because in 1986, Congress passed an act, the Vaccine Act, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and they gave the

01:36:22.822 --> 01:36:24.606
vaccine companies immunity from liability.

01:36:24.646 --> 01:36:33.403
So no matter how reckless that company is, no matter how toxic the product, no matter how egregious your injury, you cannot sue them.

01:36:34.631 --> 01:36:36.152
And that's one of the problems.

01:36:36.592 --> 01:36:42.116
And that actually is why we, one of the reasons we had this explosion in the vaccination program.

01:36:42.476 --> 01:36:44.358
When I was a kid, we only had three vaccines.

01:36:45.058 --> 01:36:52.883
And by 1986, the year the act was passed, there were 11 doses of, I think, five vaccines.

01:36:53.944 --> 01:36:56.266
And today there are a child,

01:36:57.352 --> 01:37:11.059
to go to school in states like California and New York and many other states where you have mandates, an American child now has to receive between 69 and 92 vaccines between conception.

01:37:11.119 --> 01:37:14.781
So some of those are given to the mom during pregnancy and age 18.

01:37:15.802 --> 01:37:22.666
And the reason it's 69 to 82 is some of the vaccines have, the different brands have different dose requirements.

01:37:22.706 --> 01:37:26.368
So some will require three doses, some will require one dose, some will require four doses.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.829
But that's a lot of vaccines for a kid.

01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:34.614
And each one of those is calculated, is designed to permanently alter your immune system.

01:37:35.214 --> 01:37:44.801
And so we have now this epidemic of immune dysregulation in our country, you know, and there's no way to rule out vaccines as one of the key culprits.

01:37:44.961 --> 01:37:47.123
And if you look at all of these diseases that have become

01:37:47.452 --> 01:37:49.033
There's no way to rule it out.

01:37:49.133 --> 01:38:06.859
Now, the two people that were killed in 2020, Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn, would have said that there's a great way to assume it, because intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is so much more egregious in terms of a violation of everything that is us.

01:38:07.779 --> 01:38:21.986
that you could imagine that applying anything to a skin, inhaling it, snorting it, or even swallowing it, is orders of magnitude less dangerous than injecting something via a needle directly into the muscle.

01:38:22.546 --> 01:38:36.873
And yet this master manipulator and ridiculous script reader, after working with me for a year and then employing me at his non-profit for another half a year, was still not able to learn that very simple statement from me.

01:38:38.439 --> 01:38:40.860
that intramuscular injection is antithetical.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:51.984
You know what's really weird is that there's a video of somebody like Brandy Vaughn, Tony Bark, and Suzanne Humphreys all saying the same thing.

01:38:52.444 --> 01:38:57.106
That it doesn't make any sense that the whole concept of injecting something with a needle

01:38:57.626 --> 01:39:00.890
is antithetical to everything that I understand about biology.

01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:08.998
Now, I came to that all by myself, only to realize that people like Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark had been there 10 years before.

01:39:09.519 --> 01:39:15.345
And I find it very disturbing that while they're dead, Suzanne Humphreys isn't.

01:39:15.885 --> 01:39:19.930
And she got all the way to Joe Rogan and she couldn't frickin' say it.

01:39:21.345 --> 01:39:23.367
That makes her a traitor to our grandkids.

01:39:23.768 --> 01:39:28.693
He's gotten all the way to Tucker Carlson and he doesn't seem to be able to say it.

01:39:31.036 --> 01:39:39.325
And that's because these people were put in place in front of Tony and in front of Brandy until they ended up deciding to kill them.

01:39:41.138 --> 01:39:54.547
And that's why all of these people, after lauding me with praise and telling me I'm the guy that they learned the most from and that they love the work that I do, all of these mother effer liars are gone.

01:39:57.368 --> 01:40:06.694
And my family is living on a shoestring budget on fumes, paying our rent one day before it's due because that's when we were able to get it.

01:40:09.356 --> 01:40:10.457
This is not a joke.

01:40:11.616 --> 01:40:17.180
This is the destruction of America by liars, by performing liars on social media.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.643
And I'm one of the few people who's privileged enough to know exactly how malevolent these people are.

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.985
And I feel it's my duty to share it with everybody.

01:40:25.485 --> 01:40:39.815
Epidemic, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, all of these seizure disorders, the neurological disorders like ADD, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism, all the diseases.

01:40:40.919 --> 01:40:51.273
you and i never saw when we were kids and suddenly they're oh and so now you can see that in the right part of the script you can hear him list a whole bunch of shit

01:40:52.355 --> 01:40:54.518
that is more prevalent than autism.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:41:10.656
A whole bunch of shit that added together is 10 or 100 times as prevalent as autism, especially if you figure in the fact that autism spectrum disorder is one of the shittiest possible realms of diagnosis that you could ask a doctor to go into.

01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:23.999
And so now you can really see why making all this fuss for the first 45 minutes about how they're going to do an autism study and about how there's all this evidence that autism is caused by it.

01:41:24.519 --> 01:41:31.485
Don't you see why it's so easy to make a study, to design a study where they don't find a correlation?

01:41:31.525 --> 01:41:33.267
Because autism is the myth.

01:41:34.107 --> 01:41:35.729
ADHD is not a myth.

01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:38.892
Allergies aren't a myth.

01:41:39.652 --> 01:41:41.594
Iterative bowel syndrome is not a myth.

01:41:48.547 --> 01:41:51.572
Degenerative bone disease in teenagers isn't a myth.

01:41:52.294 --> 01:41:54.417
Heart attacks in teenagers isn't a myth.

01:41:57.263 --> 01:41:59.607
But autism is, and that's why they argue about it.

01:42:02.045 --> 01:42:04.966
This generation is damaged, is incredibly damaged by all these diseases.

01:42:05.807 --> 01:42:13.310
The autoimmune diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, the allergic disease like peanut allergies, anaphylaxis, eczema.

01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:14.471
Did you ever know anybody with eczema?

01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:14.891
No.

01:42:15.211 --> 01:42:15.431
Right.

01:42:15.471 --> 01:42:17.992
So and now it's ubiquitous in every classroom.

01:42:18.993 --> 01:42:23.595
And all of those injuries are listed as side effects on the manufacturer's inserts of those products.

01:42:24.955 --> 01:42:28.157
Oh, we would be have to be blind

01:42:29.264 --> 01:42:32.427
And I say, we have to look at this as a potential culprit.

01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:38.133
We have to do the studies that the Institute of Medicine has been telling the CDC to do for 25 years.

01:42:38.173 --> 01:42:46.521
The Institute of Medicine told CDC in 2013, there are 158 injuries that aren't suspected to be vaccine injuries.

01:42:47.362 --> 01:42:48.743
Only 38 of those have been studied.

01:42:48.843 --> 01:42:51.085
And almost most of those, it was positive.

01:42:51.145 --> 01:42:52.507
It was, yeah, this is a vaccine injury.

01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:58.602
The other 120, whatever, and I'm not doing the math in my head, but the others have never been studied.

01:42:59.343 --> 01:43:04.587
And so think about this because this is the message.

01:43:05.207 --> 01:43:15.154
It's not very well presented, but this is the real message that also admits that autism spectrum disorder and its connection to vaccines

01:43:15.734 --> 01:43:36.682
that was first put forward by Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy, then recycled and amplified by Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense, is all part of the same bullshit show because autism is not the only thing that comes from fucking vaccines, you liars!

01:43:38.886 --> 01:43:59.504
cdc's job is to study them and yet it never studied them and that was purposeful and i'm not saying that out of speculation i'm saying that because i've seen the emails and cdc deliberately um derailed any study on that and then if somebody and children's health defense and mary holland and brian hooker and robert f kennedy jr

01:44:00.385 --> 01:44:11.152
have single-handedly sabotaged all and any progress that could have been made from saving any reasonable number of Americans from the vaccine schedule.

01:44:11.553 --> 01:44:19.698
Because so far in this video, he's not been able to say, he's only been able to say that when I was a kid, we only had three vaccines.

01:44:20.278 --> 01:44:23.941
What about the vaccines they have in Norway right now, asshole?

01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:29.925
What about the vaccine schedule that's enforced or not enforced in the rest of the Western world, asshole?

01:44:30.145 --> 01:44:30.213
you

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:39.111
It does, independent scientists does do a study that can't get published.

01:44:39.151 --> 01:44:42.351
The scientific publishers will not publish a study that is critical of vaccines.

01:44:42.371 --> 01:44:45.092
So we need to change that taboo.

01:44:45.132 --> 01:44:50.853
And that's one of the things Jay Bhattacharya is doing at NIH, is we're going to remove the taboo about talking about this issue.

01:44:51.073 --> 01:44:52.613
And we're going to be honest with the American public.

01:44:52.653 --> 01:45:01.274
It's pretty clear from the VAERS, the self-reporting vaccine injury system, federal system, that vaccine injuries with the COVID vax jumped to multiples of what had been reported before.

01:45:01.775 --> 01:45:03.935
Do you- There were more injuries reported

01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:11.998
from theirs by the COVID vaccine than all other vaccines put together for the past 36 years.

01:45:12.559 --> 01:45:19.367
And the person that's been delivering that message succinctly since the beginning of the pandemic is named Jessica Rose.

01:45:20.461 --> 01:45:25.804
She is an Israeli-Canadian who did a lot of her post-doctoral work with NATO funding.

01:45:26.264 --> 01:45:37.469
She has toured the world for six years with the International COVID Summit, including Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Jill Glasspool Malone, and Pierre Kory, and Peter McCullough, and Ryan Cole.

01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:43.292
She is a malevolent traitor, a fraud of the highest order,

01:45:44.673 --> 01:45:52.380
And she should be getting vegetables thrown at her when anybody recognizes her or her twin from now until the day she dies.

01:45:53.201 --> 01:45:55.883
She's one of the worst Canadian Israelis alive.

01:45:57.044 --> 01:46:04.851
And him spouting this out would only be completed if he were to cite Jessica Rose, which I'm sure he won't.

01:46:06.192 --> 01:46:07.713
And I'll tell you something else.

01:46:08.533 --> 01:46:15.735
There's a lot of people out there who say, you know, this is part of the consensus.

01:46:15.956 --> 01:46:25.279
You'll see this on every mainstream, Anderson Cooper, Jake Tapper, all of these guys, again and again, that the link between autism vaccines has been debunked, right?

01:46:25.399 --> 01:46:26.099
It's been studied.

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:33.582
But those studies that I was talking about earlier, the epidemiological studies, they only looked at one vaccine, the MMR, and one ingredient, thimerosal.

01:46:34.361 --> 01:46:35.121
Weird, right?

01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:39.442
Because that's exactly the script that they've been on for the last 10 years.

01:46:40.183 --> 01:46:45.164
Mary Holland said it was a component of the MMR vaccine that caused her son to have autism.

01:46:45.604 --> 01:46:47.264
Polly Tommy said the same thing.

01:46:47.444 --> 01:47:01.008
Andrew Wakefield did the famous study, and they bamboozled my friend, Paula Aitken, and included her in that study when her son didn't fit any of the criteria and didn't fit any of the stories.

01:47:03.382 --> 01:47:10.267
And these people are promoting the same fraud at the same time, slow rolling us to the truth that intramuscular injection is just shit.

01:47:10.668 --> 01:47:19.214
And they'll tell us that in a few hundred years after we've all been transfected a hundred times and our children are all slaves.

01:47:19.675 --> 01:47:22.097
This is the worst ever.

01:47:25.519 --> 01:47:26.080
This is it.

01:47:27.659 --> 01:47:30.221
This person is not an American patriot.

01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:32.163
This person is not a real man.

01:47:32.183 --> 01:47:34.324
And neither is Tucker Carlson.

01:47:34.364 --> 01:47:40.830
These are fake, fake Americans, fake men, fake adults on a script.

01:47:42.071 --> 01:47:43.232
And they're shitty at it.

01:47:45.307 --> 01:47:52.655
None of the vaccines that are administered to children during the first six months of life have ever been studied for autism.

01:47:52.695 --> 01:47:57.299
In fact, the Institute of Medicine said that they looked at this issue, you know, has it been debunked?

01:47:57.359 --> 01:48:03.285
And they said, no, these studies have never been done on the vaccines that are the most likely culprit, which is, you know, DTaP, AbbB.

01:48:05.107 --> 01:48:08.011
pneumococcal, the vaccines were given for six months, none of them.

01:48:08.831 --> 01:48:14.338
He said the only one that has ever been studied is DTAP, which is diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

01:48:15.719 --> 01:48:21.526
And they said that the one study that was done showed that, yeah, there was a link with autism, but we're not going to count that study.

01:48:22.859 --> 01:48:24.660
So that's been going on since 2016.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:32.622
When Barbara Lowe Fisher put out the book, it's the P and the DTP.

01:48:32.722 --> 01:48:35.783
So it's the pertussis that's causing the autism.

01:48:36.424 --> 01:48:37.164
The pertussis.

01:48:38.064 --> 01:48:40.105
No, it's the MMR and the thimerosal.

01:48:41.165 --> 01:48:43.986
Oh, but we took the thimerosal out of all the vaccines now.

01:48:44.426 --> 01:48:47.087
Oh yeah, but Paul Offit says they've always been out of the vaccines.

01:48:47.147 --> 01:48:48.828
It's only been in some flu shots.

01:48:49.761 --> 01:48:55.842
These people are on the same shitty script together with Paul Offit and you can see it in spades.

01:48:56.603 --> 01:48:57.523
This is a joke.

01:48:59.063 --> 01:49:05.305
You need to start paying attention to the other side and what the other side is seeing because we are being destroyed on the other side.

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:15.727
On all platforms, on all social media websites, the Trump administration and the health freedom movement is being made to look like shitheads.

01:49:17.202 --> 01:49:21.831
while we're watching two hour interviews with Tucker Carlson and we can't see it.

01:49:22.732 --> 01:49:23.915
We've got to wake up quick.

01:49:26.792 --> 01:49:30.433
because it was based on the VAERS system, which is CDC's only surveillance system.

01:49:30.993 --> 01:49:32.773
And they said that system is too unreliable.

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:44.736
So what they were saying, the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the only system that CDC has to study vaccine injury is so bad that any study done on it were not going to count.

01:49:46.056 --> 01:49:46.956
I'll tell you something else.

01:49:48.396 --> 01:49:55.638
David Kessler, who was a very famous Surgeon General, who you remember, and many, many, many other people have said the VAERS system does not work.

01:49:56.872 --> 01:49:57.812
and you need a new system.

01:49:57.992 --> 01:50:01.874
So in 2010, CDC designed a new system, and it was a machine counting system.

01:50:01.894 --> 01:50:06.255
The problem with VAERS, with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, is that it's voluntary.

01:50:06.456 --> 01:50:13.118
And so the doctor has to, if he sees a vaccine injury, he's required to report it to VAERS.

01:50:13.478 --> 01:50:15.639
But there's no penalty if he doesn't.

01:50:16.039 --> 01:50:18.080
It takes him a half an hour to fill out the paperwork.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.980
So there's a big incentive for him not to do it.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:20.941
There's another incentive, though.

01:50:22.031 --> 01:50:24.212
He doesn't know if something is vaccine injury.

01:50:24.992 --> 01:50:30.235
If you get a vaccine and then four years later, you come in with a food allergy, how do you know?

01:50:30.715 --> 01:50:35.037
Will any doctor in the world say that's a vaccine injury or seizure disorder?

01:50:35.357 --> 01:50:38.039
And the other thing, so they don't know what to look for.

01:50:38.119 --> 01:50:39.620
They've never been taught that at medical school.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:50.525
And so one very easy thing to say here is that intramuscular injection in particular is what allows the temporal smearing of these injuries.

01:50:51.698 --> 01:51:02.990
And Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn would have definitely explained that the whole advantage of intramuscular injection is that temporally speaking, the toxicity will be spread out over longer time periods.

01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:10.358
The onset of the symptoms and the changes in your physiology will be spread over longer time periods, which will make it very easy

01:51:10.818 --> 01:51:13.720
for both patient and doctor to dismiss the connection.

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:27.768
And this guy, who's been fighting for this biology for 20 years, who's been advocating, apparently, for 20 years, while standing in front of two dead women who could say it better, is a traitor to our grandchildren.

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:32.231
There's no course on vaccine injury in medical school, in any medical school in this country.

01:51:33.231 --> 01:51:36.053
And then... A course on vaccine injury?

01:51:36.193 --> 01:51:37.214
Are you shitting me?

01:51:38.919 --> 01:51:44.422
How about a course teaching why intramuscular injection is such a wonderful frickin' invention?

01:51:45.822 --> 01:51:59.169
How about teaching all the advantages of intramuscular injection over traditional methods of exposing people to toxins, you know, like injection or inhalation or spreading it on their skin or eating it?

01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:05.452
There's no course in vaccine injury at medical school.

01:52:06.313 --> 01:52:07.513
Holy shit.

01:52:11.508 --> 01:52:16.651
The other thing is he has a big emotional incentive because he told that mom to give that child that vaccine.

01:52:17.511 --> 01:52:25.535
And if the child has a seizure three weeks later and she comes back and she says, I think it might be the vaccine, a lot of doctors will say, no, that's normal for that age.

01:52:25.695 --> 01:52:26.915
And they're not going to call it into bears.

01:52:27.916 --> 01:52:33.058
So CDC designed a machine counting system that would do essentially cluster analysis.

01:52:33.098 --> 01:52:38.001
They would look at the vaccine and then they would look at clusters of injuries that were unique or anomalous to that vaccine.

01:52:39.173 --> 01:52:47.155
Okay, so I'm gonna fast-forward a little bit because I want to get to the lab part of the virus part and what they talk about with the virus and then I'm gonna move on.

01:52:47.656 --> 01:52:49.396
I didn't think this was gonna be so long.

01:52:49.856 --> 01:52:50.577
I apologize.

01:52:52.737 --> 01:52:55.038
I know everybody hates long shows.

01:52:55.358 --> 01:52:55.778
Here we go.

01:52:55.878 --> 01:52:59.939
And they don't seem to be getting any help.

01:53:00.319 --> 01:53:01.120
Will that change?

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.480
Yeah, that's gonna change.

01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.601
I mean, as I said, the big impediment is

01:53:06.431 --> 01:53:07.211
1986 Vaccine Act.

01:53:07.872 --> 01:53:23.616
So now they're going back to whether or not the people got the COVID shot are going to be able to claim any injuries, and they're going to argue that the COVID shot should be taken out from under the PrEP Act and put under the national vaccine, whatever, the 1986 law.

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:36.902
And that's what Aaron Siri is arguing for, because then he can use the administrative kangaroo court of the VICP, and he can get all of his fees paid ahead of time.

01:53:36.942 --> 01:53:44.744
Because right now, the VICP at the PrEP Act doesn't pay interim fees like the CICP does.

01:53:44.824 --> 01:53:52.546
So the only grift in law in America where you can get paid before, and even if you lose your case,

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:54.447
is the CICP.

01:53:54.527 --> 01:54:01.471
That is the kangaroo court under which any vaccine injuries are litigated or decided.

01:54:02.191 --> 01:54:10.136
And that kangaroo court is where Aaron Seery of Goldman Sachs makes all of his money.

01:54:11.577 --> 01:54:15.559
Probably used to be office buddies with Steve Bannon.

01:54:16.972 --> 01:54:23.319
And so it's complicated about how we fix this, you know, so that we can get compensation to those people.

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:31.628
We just brought a guy in this week who's going to be revolutionizing the vaccine injury compensation program.

01:54:32.881 --> 01:54:34.142
Keep checking me on that.

01:54:34.202 --> 01:54:39.046
Thank you for advocating for empathy, even for the worst players in this, because it's true.

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:41.648
I should have empathy for even the worst players in this.

01:54:41.688 --> 01:54:44.630
They all think they know a noble lie.

01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:48.634
They all think somehow or another they've been convinced that they're doing the right thing.

01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:54.818
And I do think that even this clown with his limited understanding thinks he's doing the right thing.

01:54:55.979 --> 01:54:57.781
And so thank you for pointing that out.

01:54:58.106 --> 01:55:16.650
which is a program that when Congress passed the Vaccine Act and gave immunity from liability vaccine companies, it recognized that vaccines were in the description, the characterization of the American Academy of Pediatrics were unavoidably unsafe.

01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:20.831
And some people, like for every medicine, some people are gonna be injured and killed.

01:55:21.231 --> 01:55:25.012
And so it set up a program that's in the federal government

01:55:26.058 --> 01:55:28.100
of the vaccine courts and they have a trust fund.

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.142
The trust fund is endowed by a 75%.

01:55:31.823 --> 01:55:33.404
So maybe I got those two mixed up.

01:55:33.464 --> 01:55:39.609
Maybe the one from the original that he's talking about that Aaron Seery works under is the VICP.

01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:45.373
And then the one that covers the countermeasures under the PrEP Act is the CICP.

01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:46.574
I think that's right.

01:55:46.714 --> 01:55:49.237
So I got those two mixed up, but you can figure that out.

01:55:49.777 --> 01:55:50.898
Surcharge on every vaccine.

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:57.447
And that program is supposed to, there's supposed to be a vaccine court that's supposed to be generous and fast and give the tie to the runner.

01:55:57.467 --> 01:56:04.050
In other words, if there's doubts about, you know, whether somebody's injury came from a vaccine or not, you're going to assume they got it and compensate them.

01:56:05.231 --> 01:56:08.272
And it's paid out over $5 billion to about 12,000 people.

01:56:11.158 --> 01:56:16.445
And we're looking at ways to enlarge that program so that COVID vaccine injured people can be compensated.

01:56:17.266 --> 01:56:22.654
And we're changing the program so that, you know, we're looking at ways to enlarge the statute of limitations.

01:56:22.674 --> 01:56:23.455
It's only three years.

01:56:23.515 --> 01:56:25.557
A lot of people don't discover their injuries after that.

01:56:27.066 --> 01:56:29.947
Whoa, Aaron Seery's going to make a killing.

01:56:30.067 --> 01:56:31.747
There's no discovery in that program.

01:56:31.767 --> 01:56:33.047
There's no rules of evidence.

01:56:33.427 --> 01:56:37.688
The program has devolved into lawyers from the justice.

01:56:37.708 --> 01:56:39.349
You're not suing the vaccine company.

01:56:39.469 --> 01:56:41.509
You're petitioning my agency.

01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:44.209
And it's represented traditionally by the Department of Justice.

01:56:45.490 --> 01:56:49.331
And the lawyers in the Department of Justice, the leaders of it, were corrupt.

01:56:49.351 --> 01:56:56.072
And they saw their job as protecting the trust fund rather than taking care of people who made this national sacrifice.

01:56:57.287 --> 01:56:58.788
and we're gonna change that.

01:56:58.868 --> 01:57:02.269
Oh, so vaccine injury is a national sacrifice now.

01:57:02.329 --> 01:57:04.190
What an interesting choice of words.

01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.790
Change all that.

01:57:05.150 --> 01:57:08.552
And I've brought in a team this week that is starting to work on that this week.

01:57:08.692 --> 01:57:11.193
So, you know, that's one of the things we're doing, but we're looking at everything.

01:57:11.213 --> 01:57:12.393
What's the status of the COVID vaccine now?

01:57:12.453 --> 01:57:12.834
Who gets it?

01:57:12.854 --> 01:57:14.914
What are the recommendations and why?

01:57:16.555 --> 01:57:20.337
The recommendations now are... We'll skip this.

01:57:22.758 --> 01:57:24.198
...that everybody who takes it will be back.

01:57:24.518 --> 01:57:25.219
People died in the blitz.

01:57:27.944 --> 01:57:29.966
And there was one person who died from COVID in the vaccine group.

01:57:30.006 --> 01:57:31.927
And that's the whole data set they were with.

01:57:31.987 --> 01:57:32.668
It was 100% effective.

01:57:32.688 --> 01:57:34.830
And when people heard that, they got the vaccine or not.

01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:43.176
And what they really should have been telling people is that in order to prevent one death from COVID, you had to give 19,999 vaccines.

01:57:46.308 --> 01:57:50.752
If any of those vaccines were killing people, you would cancel out the effect of, you know, the beneficial effect.

01:57:50.772 --> 01:57:52.894
Do you think the COVID, I mean, net, net.

01:57:53.194 --> 01:58:03.924
And we are still calling it a COVID vaccine because these people are on a trade or a script where they're never going to tell you it was an old shitty technology because then every academic biologist

01:58:04.725 --> 01:58:16.427
in America and around the Western world would be obligated to accept that they should have known that this wasn't a vaccine or a new vaccine or untested technology that had never been tried before.

01:58:16.967 --> 01:58:23.549
This is, as Mary Holland said not even six months ago, it's this new technology that had never been tried before.

01:58:24.089 --> 01:58:29.090
No, it is an old technology that had been used for decades on the academic bench.

01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:34.992
And to call it a vaccine still in 2025 is traitorous to our kids.

01:58:35.592 --> 01:58:40.974
It's traitorous to every frickin' college kid who got bamboozled into taking it.

01:58:41.134 --> 01:58:58.060
Every person that was bullied into taking it deserves to know that it was a shitty old technology and that Robert Malone and Peter Cullis and Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and Mary Holland and all of them were scripted to make sure you wouldn't figure that out.

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.041
still sticking to it now.

01:59:00.322 --> 01:59:00.842
Wow, what a cop-out.

01:59:21.929 --> 01:59:24.871
The only reason why you couldn't know is because you're a liar.

01:59:25.632 --> 01:59:25.892
Wow.

01:59:25.912 --> 01:59:32.677
Because the studies that were done by my agency were substandard and they were not designed to answer that question.

01:59:32.957 --> 01:59:43.245
And there's been a lot of obfuscation about covering up, as you know, about suppressing any kind of discussion of vaccine injuries.

01:59:43.285 --> 01:59:45.707
I mean, Mark Zuckerberg publicly

01:59:46.963 --> 01:59:54.971
said that he was ordered by the White House to suppress anybody on his platform on Facebook or Instagram who mentioned vaccine injuries.

01:59:55.672 --> 02:00:01.057
He was ordered by the Biden administration to, and he said, you know, and we know.

02:00:02.193 --> 02:00:03.474
I can't do that shit.

02:00:03.894 --> 02:00:06.675
They were telling Facebook to take me off of Instagram, which Facebook did.

02:00:07.715 --> 02:00:10.956
I had almost a million followers and there was no vaccine misinformation on there.

02:00:11.757 --> 02:00:18.779
I asked Facebook again and again, invent a new word, which is because Facebook was saying to the White House, this isn't misinformation.

02:00:18.839 --> 02:00:19.580
It's actually true.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:24.201
And the White House said, well, it's malinformation, malinformation.

02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:25.842
This is an Orwellian kind of construct.

02:00:26.082 --> 02:00:26.562
You know, they just.

02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:31.840
Are you satisfied that mRNA technology is safe for people?

02:00:32.181 --> 02:00:32.961
I'm not satisfied.

02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:49.024
Again, my opinion about that is... mRNA technology is not only safe for people, but the current CDC director, who will soon be approved, believes that the whole platform has proven safe.

02:00:50.764 --> 02:00:52.505
There's a video out there of it right now.

02:00:52.725 --> 02:00:57.806
She was in her confirmation hearing asked and she said, yes, it is the new way forward.

02:00:59.895 --> 02:01:03.677
And what he will be used to do is to prove it was safe.

02:01:03.737 --> 02:01:07.278
What Robert Malone will be used to do is to certify it's safe.

02:01:07.779 --> 02:01:18.984
Maybe not the old stuff that was contaminated with DNA, like the hero Kevin McKernan says, but the new stuff that we're making now with personalized printing methods, yes, that's working fine.

02:01:20.103 --> 02:01:22.104
relevant, but we will be doing those studies.

02:01:22.184 --> 02:01:30.606
And I would say there's a lot of skepticism in this agency about mRNA vaccines, you know, about mRNA technology, about the status of it now.

02:01:32.227 --> 02:01:32.407
Yes.

02:01:32.547 --> 02:01:32.807
Yes.

02:01:32.907 --> 02:01:33.447
Menares.

02:01:33.547 --> 02:01:33.767
Yes.

02:01:33.827 --> 02:01:35.328
There is a, there is a clip of it.

02:01:35.348 --> 02:01:36.188
It's safe.

02:01:36.308 --> 02:01:47.171
And we do not, you know, the safety studies simply have not been done, but there is enough anecdotal reports of people getting profound injuries that may or may not be associated with it.

02:01:47.271 --> 02:01:48.732
And we're going to answer those questions.

02:01:49.628 --> 02:01:50.849
What happened with the vaccine board?

02:01:51.029 --> 02:01:54.572
I keep reading you fired all these eminent scientists on the vaccine board.

02:01:54.612 --> 02:01:55.773
Yeah, I fired all these what?

02:01:56.433 --> 02:01:58.495
All these important, highly credentialed scientists.

02:01:59.316 --> 02:02:04.039
Yeah, well, we fired that board because they were, it was utterly, it was just an instrument.

02:02:04.059 --> 02:02:08.163
It was a sock puppet for the industry that it was supposed to regulate.

02:02:08.263 --> 02:02:13.987
So, you know, they, in fact, you know, and this was a long time coming Tucker, in 2002,

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:23.604
the Government Oversight Committee and the United States Congress held hearings about that board, which is called ASAP, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:30.007
And they said that 97% of the people on that board had undisclosed conflicts.

02:02:31.608 --> 02:02:33.249
Many of them had disclosed conflicts as well.

02:02:33.969 --> 02:02:42.534
But they said that, Congress said that, it gave an example, it said the rotavirus vaccine was approved by that board

02:02:43.524 --> 02:02:50.009
And there were five members of that board at that time, and four of them had direct financial interests in the rotavirus vaccine.

02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:56.353
They were working for the companies that made the vaccine, or they were receiving grants to do clinical trials on that vaccine.

02:02:56.373 --> 02:02:59.075
They all had overwhelming financial interests.

02:03:00.036 --> 02:03:06.180
One of the people on that board was a guy called Paul Offit, who is one of the big voices for vaccines.

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.662
CNN goes to him all the time when it wants to know about vaccines.

02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:14.690
He voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to the schedule when he had a rotavirus vaccine in development.

02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:19.551
Because it's now on the schedule, his developing vaccine is virtually guaranteed to get on the schedule.

02:03:19.571 --> 02:03:25.813
It's a competitive product, but once you say rotavirus vaccine has to be vaccinated for, his vaccine is now guaranteed to get on the schedule.

02:03:25.853 --> 02:03:36.275
The one they voted on, that he voted on, within a year it had to be withdrawn because it was causing this really disastrous disease in kids that is often lethal, called insusception, agonizingly painful when you're

02:03:37.364 --> 02:03:41.787
Intestines kind of tie up against each other and it kills children on occasion.

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:46.371
That vaccine was pulled the following year and his vaccine then replaced him.

02:03:46.391 --> 02:03:47.212
He was still on the committee.

02:03:47.632 --> 02:03:49.453
He didn't vote on that, but he was still on the committee.

02:03:49.473 --> 02:03:52.255
But he voted to make rotavirus vaccine mandatory.

02:03:52.275 --> 02:03:55.498
And he then, he and his business partners.

02:03:56.118 --> 02:04:05.966
But what about the addition to the RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibodies for those people that didn't get the RSV vaccine during pregnancy?

02:04:08.223 --> 02:04:33.915
It's hard for me to imagine that somebody who has been on this case for more than 20 years doesn't understand that the earlier in development a baby or fetus is exposed to these random toxins, these random immunological adjustments, the potential for interrupting the trajectory of this pattern integrity is

02:04:35.499 --> 02:04:44.590
it increases exponentially and yet he doesn't seem to be aware that his new ACIP approved a essentially

02:04:45.916 --> 02:05:08.223
advocating for RSV vaccine for all pregnant women or the application of a monoclonal antibody to the baby in order to take the place of that vaccine, which will essentially be very easy for most doctors and obstetricians to make the argument that, you know, we can put a needle in your newborn baby after a couple months, if he gets sick,

02:05:09.023 --> 02:05:12.465
or you could just take this vaccine now and then we won't have to do that.

02:05:13.045 --> 02:05:16.747
This monster has permitted that to happen.

02:05:17.187 --> 02:05:26.151
And in fact, put Robert Malone and Retsef Levy and Martin Kulldorff in a position to do that very thing.

02:05:26.251 --> 02:05:37.376
These people that we were supposed to rally behind for five years because they were heroes on X. Stanley Plotkin and a couple of other people sold that vaccine to Merck for $186 million.

02:05:39.722 --> 02:05:41.224
He told Newsweek that he won the lottery.

02:05:42.405 --> 02:05:44.588
Oh, you know, it's been said of him that he voted himself rich.

02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:47.832
So that and that kind of conflict was typical on that committee.

02:05:47.852 --> 02:05:50.595
But the most did people know this was going on?

02:05:50.695 --> 02:05:57.263
That's such an obvious, you know, the Office of Inspector General in this department investigated and they said, this is a disaster.

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:57.944
You've got to change it.

02:05:59.025 --> 02:06:01.507
Congress investigated and said you got to change it and they did nothing.

02:06:01.527 --> 02:06:14.236
That's the most most sort of glaring example of medical malpractice by this by this group is that they approved all these vaccines we went from 11 remember to 69 to 92.

02:06:14.276 --> 02:06:18.880
11 vaccines in 86 and not one of them had except for COVID.

02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:19.841
COVID is the only one

02:06:21.129 --> 02:06:25.172
and had a pre-licensing safety trial that involved a placebo, a true placebo.

02:06:25.932 --> 02:06:29.595
And so all of those other vaccines were ushered in without safety studies.

02:06:30.075 --> 02:06:32.937
And that means nobody understands the risk profile of those products.

02:06:33.343 --> 02:06:51.692
and so still on the same script where they don't get a placebo trial and Paul Offit can argue on the left that that's ridiculous because vaccines save lives so you can't do a placebo trial and so the same hamster wheel for the last 15 years they're still peddling it

02:06:52.192 --> 02:06:53.532
He's still confused.

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:55.013
He doesn't understand why.

02:06:55.453 --> 02:07:12.816
And the reason why is because you don't need a long-term placebo-controlled trial to show that SIDS and these other acute onset disorders that come after vaccination, albeit rare, when they show up, they show up in a few days or less, sometimes even in hours.

02:07:13.316 --> 02:07:16.597
And so there's no reason to do a long-term placebo-controlled trial

02:07:17.077 --> 02:07:32.047
when a 35 day or 45 day placebo-controlled trial could be run by every doctor in every office in America and put nobody at risk for any of these diseases because they'll all get their shots in 45 days.

02:07:32.467 --> 02:07:41.974
And they could have come up with that argument 10 years ago opposite Paul Offit when Paul Offit was saying that placebo-controlled trials are really unethical.

02:07:42.394 --> 02:07:46.637
He could have said, yeah, but we don't need to do a long-term one to show you that some kids get screwed up.

02:07:48.834 --> 02:07:50.134
and they've never come up with it.

02:07:51.375 --> 02:07:54.196
Andrew Wakefield in 25 years can't come up with it.

02:07:54.236 --> 02:07:56.956
Polly Tommy in all her reading can't come up with it.

02:07:57.117 --> 02:08:02.898
Meryl Nass after solving the mystery of Ebola has never been able to come up with it.

02:08:03.398 --> 02:08:12.821
Solving the mystery of anthrax has never been able to come up with a simple experiment to show that SIDS is really just caused by intramuscular injection going wrong.

02:08:13.401 --> 02:08:15.022
All of these people have failed.

02:08:16.257 --> 02:08:20.359
And it's because they're on a shitty script, because they don't even understand it.

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:22.380
They're just dumb.

02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.241
How can you do that?

02:08:24.301 --> 02:08:24.661
They did it.

02:08:24.801 --> 02:08:25.362
It's corruption.

02:08:25.942 --> 02:08:27.483
And it's because of agency capture.

02:08:28.704 --> 02:08:36.606
It's because the companies that were making these products said, if you can get your vaccine on the schedule, it's generally, typically about a billion.

02:08:36.686 --> 02:08:40.808
This incentive structure was set up by the Human Genome Project.

02:08:40.848 --> 02:08:55.772
This incentive structure was set up to fail by the Human Genome Project that knew that they needed to make the entire American public beg to be experimental animals, beg to be allowed to participate.

02:08:57.128 --> 02:09:01.593
Give me a vaccine to save me from this gain-of-function virus, please.

02:09:18.491 --> 02:09:22.274
It runs it first through FDA, then through ASAP, and gets it recommended.

02:09:22.314 --> 02:09:26.697
If you can get that recommendation, you now got a billion dollars in leased revenues by the end of the year.

02:09:26.937 --> 02:09:29.639
Okay, I think we're gonna have to cover the lab leak part tomorrow.

02:09:29.699 --> 02:09:33.402
I'll just start the stream again tomorrow, right here first.

02:09:34.923 --> 02:09:40.266
And we only have 28 minutes left, or no, we have our, well, yeah, 28 minutes left.

02:09:40.286 --> 02:09:42.088
So we watched an hour together, that was pretty good.

02:09:43.088 --> 02:09:44.269
Thank you very much for being here.

02:09:44.289 --> 02:09:45.810
I'm just going to end it kind of abruptly.

02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:49.771
I want to get ready, eat some lunch, get to the gym.

02:09:50.332 --> 02:09:52.893
My back is recovering very slowly, so I'm very excited.

02:09:52.933 --> 02:09:58.716
Yesterday I could do some full power jump shots and I could still feel the ache, but we're getting there.

02:10:00.137 --> 02:10:06.322
I'm really excited because I know that I have work to do and I know what work needs to be done and I'm doing it.

02:10:06.522 --> 02:10:08.844
So we're just going to keep producing a show.

02:10:08.864 --> 02:10:15.469
We're going to keep putting this out until the basketball is ready to go and then we'll move on to that.

02:10:16.290 --> 02:10:17.511
Thank you very much for being here.

02:10:17.591 --> 02:10:18.592
Got some mail here.

02:10:19.413 --> 02:10:24.297
I'll open up quick while we're seeing and saying goodbye.

02:10:25.638 --> 02:10:26.378
Thank you very much.

02:10:28.866 --> 02:10:29.427
Oh, wow.

02:10:29.907 --> 02:10:30.587
Oh, wow.

02:10:31.568 --> 02:10:37.513
Um... Christy... I don't know what to say to you people.

02:10:38.173 --> 02:10:42.977
Um... Sorry we can't make it to the beach house this year, Christy.

02:10:43.797 --> 02:10:44.858
Uh... Wow.

02:10:45.859 --> 02:10:46.299
Wow.

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.542
Um... I needed that.

02:10:50.002 --> 02:10:50.742
We needed that.

02:10:51.403 --> 02:10:52.604
Holy shit, we needed that.

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:53.545
I can almost cry.

02:10:54.405 --> 02:10:55.086
Thanks, Christy.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:29.393

This one's from Lynchburg, Virginia, from Bob.

02:11:59.226 --> 02:12:00.347
What do you got in here, Bob?

02:12:00.527 --> 02:12:03.130
Oh my gosh, it's got another silver dollar in here.

02:12:03.210 --> 02:12:04.031
Bob, you're nuts.

02:12:04.992 --> 02:12:07.074
I gotta do something with Bob here.

02:12:07.114 --> 02:12:08.335
He sent me another letter.

02:12:08.355 --> 02:12:14.001
Wow, you're welcome, Bob.

02:12:14.081 --> 02:12:15.663
Thank you very much.

02:12:15.743 --> 02:12:16.504
See you guys soon.

02:12:16.904 --> 02:12:17.385
See you tomorrow.
