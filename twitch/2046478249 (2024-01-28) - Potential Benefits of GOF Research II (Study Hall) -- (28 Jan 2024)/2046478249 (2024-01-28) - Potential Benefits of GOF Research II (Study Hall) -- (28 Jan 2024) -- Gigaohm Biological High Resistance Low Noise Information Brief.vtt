WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.680
I want people to complain.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.760
So what do I do?

00:13.760 --> 00:15.280
I go to Des Moines.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.600
Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines, I live

00:17.600 --> 00:18.600
there for four years.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.800
I go to Des Moines, I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.400
I go to Seattle, I infect a couple of cases there.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.360
I go to North Carolina, I go to Wisconsin.

00:30.360 --> 00:35.040
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a

00:35.040 --> 00:37.560
highly morbid condition.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.560
These individuals complain.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.320
Again, this is a central nervous system condition, so they're complaining of whatever the bug

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
may do.

00:43.320 --> 00:49.000
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.480
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.880
I take attribution for that.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.920
Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.840
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms

01:00.840 --> 01:03.640
of lethality are X, Y, and Z.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.600
These people are really sick with this.

01:05.600 --> 01:12.240
But then I say, others who are also infected will show subdramal, predramal signs of lethality

01:12.240 --> 01:17.880
and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.480
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've

01:22.520 --> 01:26.360
got every individual who's worried well, flooding the public health system, banging

01:26.360 --> 01:27.600
on the door.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.560
The CDC comes back and says, nonsense, that's not real.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.160
I come back and say, that's fake news.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.320
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis

01:39.320 --> 01:41.200
and the public health system.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.080
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.800
January 28, 2024.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.600
Welcome to Giga Own Biological.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.200
Glad all of you can join me.

02:13.200 --> 02:19.360
I'm trying to do a little early one and then maybe I can also do one later with a little

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
more meat on it.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
I don't know.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.360
This one might be already a couple hours.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.360
We'll see what we do.

02:24.360 --> 02:29.200
I've got a basketball game this afternoon, I need to attend, and so I'll let you know

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
what's up.

02:30.200 --> 02:35.200
We might have to stop this one a little early, but I think we're going to be able to make

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
a good point here.

02:36.200 --> 02:44.840
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worse case

02:44.840 --> 02:45.840
scenario.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.440
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worse case

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
scenario.

03:06.200 --> 03:23.920
The schedule for 16 minutes next is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.120
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.120
It's embarrassing.

03:28.120 --> 03:38.400
The rules, protect yourself at all times, follow my instructions, keep it clean, touch

03:38.400 --> 03:41.400
gloves if you wish, let's do it.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.400
20 pounds.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
This is so crazy.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Like these bumps.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
This is so crazy.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
I feel so nervous.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Like what in the world, man?

03:47.400 --> 03:54.400
We have been challenged lately in the public square that is Twitter X, to be able to see

04:17.400 --> 04:24.040
you try and more formalize our challenge to virology and I think we would be wise to

04:24.040 --> 04:29.400
move forward with caution because lots of people have tread this water before and so

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
I'm pretty excited.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
Wow.

04:32.400 --> 04:44.200
Somebody lost a 42 year old friend to a brain and you're just, well, there's a downer.

04:44.200 --> 04:52.080
I'm not really sure what to say about that other than we're going to keep this fight

04:52.080 --> 04:57.440
up for everybody who's lost a friend and obviously it's still happening.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.440
I'm afraid Colin, I'm afraid it's going to get worse, not better.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.080
That's the issue here.

05:04.080 --> 05:13.280
That's the issue I feel is that that's where we are.

05:13.280 --> 05:20.160
They have manipulated us and we need to be the people that can hold the light to the

05:20.160 --> 05:21.640
truth.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
It's about the history.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.480
It's also about what's happening right now.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.360
It's about our recent history and our deep history and about things that some people just

05:30.360 --> 05:37.200
will not, will refuse to see.

05:37.200 --> 05:44.240
It's all about their God, AI and solving humanity's futuristic problems and they feel

05:44.240 --> 05:46.240
like they only have one chance in history.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.120
They've been bamboozled by themselves.

05:48.120 --> 05:57.680
They've been, they're bamboozling each other about this stuff.

05:57.680 --> 06:02.000
I got, I got called out on Twitter the other day because I don't call anybody out in big

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
pharma.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.840
I don't call anybody out in the who or anywhere else.

06:05.840 --> 06:14.480
My goodness, the kind of thing that passes for debate on that platform is absolutely

06:14.480 --> 06:15.480
laughable.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.040
If you can't see the brick wall right now, I think we're in big trouble.

06:20.040 --> 06:26.440
Hopefully everybody here can see the brick wall of course, but that's 46 of you, 47 counting

06:26.440 --> 06:27.440
me.

06:27.440 --> 06:35.680
That's not a lot and we need to share this just a little bit more if you don't mind.

06:35.680 --> 06:52.960
This is a stream brought to you by a patch clamp physiologist.

06:52.960 --> 06:59.520
GigaOM is a resistance measurement, a value of resistance that you want to achieve when

06:59.520 --> 07:04.920
you're making these recordings and so I named this stream GigaOM biological and you can

07:04.920 --> 07:11.280
find that at dot com, you can also find us at GigaOM dot bio, which is a area placed

07:11.280 --> 07:12.280
in chat.

07:12.280 --> 07:17.320
You can support me with one time donation at the support GigaOM and then there's also

07:17.320 --> 07:24.800
a way to subscribe and I would really strongly encourage anybody who's been sitting on their

07:24.800 --> 07:29.840
hands about this to get on board right now because this, we've got about two months to

07:29.840 --> 07:35.720
see if we can push this boat out or if we're going to have to make some drastic changes

07:35.720 --> 07:37.800
to how we move forward.

07:37.800 --> 07:46.040
Right now the people that are helping us, helping my family try to push this boat out

07:46.040 --> 07:49.000
are listed here and it's not the only people.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.080
There's also some people who've made some single donations that I haven't been able

07:52.080 --> 07:57.280
to get onto the board yet and so you've got to apologize to me or I got to apologize

07:57.280 --> 07:59.880
to you for that.

07:59.880 --> 08:05.720
My wife and I, my wife has started to actually work for GigaOM biological in that respect

08:05.720 --> 08:20.520
and so communication should get a little better and so hopefully that's the case.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.520
So where are we?

08:22.520 --> 08:27.840
We are pushing back pretty hard now against the traditional idea of a pandemic, the idea

08:27.840 --> 08:33.600
that either a laboratory leak or a bat cave virus started somewhere in late 2019 and then

08:33.600 --> 08:38.240
circulated around the globe with pretty high fidelity, changing color as it went and that

08:38.240 --> 08:39.480
we're in the fifth year of it.

08:39.480 --> 08:45.720
We're pushing very hard against this faith in a novel virus but we can't stop now.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.080
We've got to clean up the mess.

08:47.080 --> 08:53.640
We've got to clean up the recent history mess before it becomes a lie that becomes

08:53.640 --> 08:57.400
the truth because they don't understand that it could have been a background signal, they

08:57.400 --> 09:00.360
don't understand that it could have been clones, they don't understand that it could have been

09:00.360 --> 09:04.360
a combination of many of these things.

09:04.360 --> 09:11.680
And I think it's really important that these ideas are always at the front because they're

09:11.680 --> 09:15.280
going to try and make it seem like, you know, the details of the story.

09:15.280 --> 09:20.400
Taking home gets all the details wrong, he doesn't know all the details.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.000
While they ignore the big messages and the big messages are the ones that we need to

09:24.000 --> 09:29.800
get to our kids, the big messages about this being an illusion, about this being a mythology

09:29.800 --> 09:36.200
that all of these people have somehow or another collectively agreed not to challenge and that

09:36.200 --> 09:40.320
they don't talk about there being no spread in New York City infectious clones, placebo

09:40.320 --> 09:44.840
batches or transfection, they don't talk about the protocols or gain a function being

09:44.840 --> 09:49.400
a mythology and they don't talk about us being fooled in dissolving this mystery because

09:49.400 --> 09:56.680
they are committed to this and they have a spectacular commitment to this lie.

09:56.680 --> 10:01.040
That's what I'm talking about, congratulations on Substack, thank you very much.

10:01.040 --> 10:08.720
It's taken me a little while to get that rolling and now I figured it out in Premiere and so

10:08.720 --> 10:16.000
making the transcript and the subtitles is not a ridiculous task anymore and so that's

10:16.000 --> 10:17.560
pretty fun.

10:17.560 --> 10:24.640
I'm really, really happy about that so thanks very much for noticing that I got that rolling.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.960
Hold on a second, let me get over here.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.240
Thank you very much for joining me, it is 2:40 in the afternoon here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

10:34.240 --> 10:35.240
USA.

10:35.240 --> 10:40.160
I'm coming to you from the back of my garage, this is Gigoland Biological, hey, high resistance

10:40.160 --> 10:42.560
low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:42.560 --> 10:49.280
My name is Jonathan Couey and as I said, it's the 28th of January and I don't know, I guess

10:49.280 --> 10:55.840
you can steal my identity now that you know that this is my birthday and I'm 52 but anyway,

10:55.840 --> 11:02.800
this is your 52 year old biologist who's put four hard years of his life into this, it's

11:02.800 --> 11:04.800
pretty crazy.

11:04.800 --> 11:10.240
I have a little plan here and I want to stick to it, oh, there's the secret, I didn't want

11:10.240 --> 11:16.920
that to show up yet, anyway, we will save that, that's fine.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.720
And then I'm going to pull up a new slide deck, it's a quick one and then we're going

11:19.720 --> 11:24.920
to get right to this movie which is actually session five of a gain of function research

11:24.920 --> 11:31.480
meeting from 2016 and I just wanted to do a brief introduction to it to make sure that

11:31.480 --> 11:34.720
we're all on the same page, especially of those of you who might be lucky enough to

11:34.720 --> 11:37.640
join us for the first time.

11:37.640 --> 11:43.040
We are trying to do the honorable thing and tell the truth to the young.

11:43.040 --> 11:49.720
In so doing, we need to dispel this idea which was first most adequately summarized by Edward

11:49.720 --> 11:54.480
Bernays in the early 20th century that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of

11:54.480 --> 12:00.640
the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element of democratic society.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.840
And now I want you to think about the fact that this guy came up with this idea in the

12:03.840 --> 12:12.720
20s when there were just newspapers and town criers and bulletins and things like that.

12:12.720 --> 12:19.040
And maybe soon after radio and telegram, but now we're talking about social media and think

12:19.040 --> 12:24.480
about what this statement means in the context of social media, in the context of algorithms

12:24.480 --> 12:32.400
in the context of amplification and whatever they call it, throttling or think about all

12:32.400 --> 12:40.720
of these things which are definitely real, definitely at play so that we get a very distorted

12:40.720 --> 12:41.960
view of the world.

12:41.960 --> 12:48.960
If we look through this particular window, we're going to have a very distorted view of

12:48.960 --> 12:51.960
the world and yet most of us are looking through that window.

12:51.960 --> 12:57.580
Some of us are looking at me through that window right now.

12:57.580 --> 13:07.320
And so in effect, right, in effect, the principal of informed consent has been ignored for the

13:07.320 --> 13:11.440
duration of the pandemic because we've been, you know, scrolling up and down and following

13:11.440 --> 13:15.840
all these people on Twitter and trying to figure out the truth by getting involved in

13:15.840 --> 13:20.560
different DM groups on Twitter and different signal chats and different telegram groups

13:20.560 --> 13:25.760
and different GAB and following locals videos that no one else pays to watch so you have

13:25.760 --> 13:27.200
the inside story.

13:27.200 --> 13:35.760
This is all the same surrendering basically of your informed consent just by overwhelming,

13:35.760 --> 13:39.120
overwhelming you, overwhelming your family and then isolating you as well.

13:39.120 --> 13:47.560
Look at that little girl on the couch.

13:47.560 --> 13:54.440
And so I firmly believe that this is the best American version of the deception that

13:54.440 --> 13:55.440
occurred.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.880
I'm sure it occurred everywhere around the world that they tricked the average TV watching

13:59.880 --> 14:07.600
social media surfing person to think that they were witnessing a sort of bad coverup

14:07.600 --> 14:13.280
of what turns out to be with a result of whistleblowers and leaks.

14:13.280 --> 14:18.160
More or less, a US funded gain of function program in Wuhan that ended up causing this

14:18.160 --> 14:22.400
calamity and we have been led to believe that we solved this problem.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.520
And I've given you this list of things to help you think about how the pandemic was

14:27.520 --> 14:32.320
created, which starts with seeding the gain of function narrative with scientific programs

14:32.320 --> 14:36.520
and peer reviewed publications for years before the pandemic.

14:36.520 --> 14:42.160
And then also remember that there were regular upper level exercises in the government, international

14:42.240 --> 14:48.840
exercises in the government, which drilled these, the response to such a pandemic potential

14:48.840 --> 14:51.960
actually emerging.

14:51.960 --> 14:58.760
And then we seeded mass casualty events with expected outcomes of transfection, at least

14:58.760 --> 15:02.960
let's just say that we didn't do anything to stop that.

15:02.960 --> 15:08.440
And more importantly, what we did was we had a bunch of actors in all different levels

15:08.440 --> 15:15.000
of social media and on mainstream media that we're prepared to, that were set up to were

15:15.000 --> 15:23.760
directed to, were encouraged to seed the narrative of the gain of function, the lab leak and

15:23.760 --> 15:28.640
attributes of the infection, the bad parts of the attributes that go all the way from

15:28.640 --> 15:34.040
heart attacks and myocarditis all the way up to amyloidosis and prion disease as a

15:34.040 --> 15:42.440
way of putting forth ideas which could then be confounded at the time when some of these

15:42.440 --> 15:47.040
symptomologies would emerge as a result of the transfection.

15:47.040 --> 15:53.160
And I believe that these people knew that some of these expected outcomes of mass transfecting

15:53.160 --> 16:00.200
the population could have been known and then could have been purposefully seeded into the

16:00.240 --> 16:07.000
virus narrative early on as the worst case scenario was being pushed behind the scenes

16:07.000 --> 16:10.920
and and off camera.

16:10.920 --> 16:15.320
And you could have participants that were involved in this, that were involved in a national

16:15.320 --> 16:22.680
security priority response, even like people at news, like producers at news programs,

16:22.680 --> 16:29.120
for example, could be could have been briefed secretly to say, Hey, you know, we have to

16:29.120 --> 16:35.480
talk these talking points and the entire news program and the entire all the newscasters

16:35.480 --> 16:39.880
would be clueless as to why their lines were the way that they were there.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.720
It's not a whole, you know, the whole channel 11 is not in on it.

16:44.720 --> 16:49.720
It only has to be one person at the top or near the top for this to have been flawlessly

16:49.720 --> 16:54.800
executed at every level of media.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.800
And so in the end, we have this virus and this transfection and it's their effects

16:58.800 --> 17:03.480
confounded and so that we're still arguing about whether it and they added to it.

17:03.480 --> 17:08.920
Of course, they've added this, this contamination and I believe they added this contamination

17:08.920 --> 17:13.200
because the spike protein toxicity narrative didn't take hold.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.440
It wasn't powerful enough.

17:15.440 --> 17:23.840
Maybe the dissident movement didn't bite it as hard as they wanted them to bite it.

17:23.840 --> 17:28.040
And so I have been putting up pictures of all kinds of people that I follow on Twitter

17:28.040 --> 17:32.800
and making the argument that it's the spread of these worst case scenario bad ideas that

17:32.800 --> 17:37.400
allowed this narrative to tumble forward out of control and allowed them to steer it right

17:37.400 --> 17:40.120
toward the need for transfection.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.760
And so a lot of people were just on board.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.280
They're just unwitting.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.800
They didn't know.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.320
And so we've talked about these guys before.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.800
We've talked about these guys before, you know, these guys are the ones who are arguing

17:52.800 --> 17:53.800
now.

17:53.800 --> 18:00.000
I've talked, I've found something very interesting with regard to Sasha Latypova.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.920
I've always wondered, I've been wondering about her, I've had her on my stream before

18:03.920 --> 18:09.800
with regard to the, to the shots and their, and their different batches.

18:09.800 --> 18:15.080
And then since then, she was on stage with Robert Malone and, and Meryl Nast and it's

18:15.080 --> 18:17.640
just been kind of a hands off situation at this stage.

18:17.640 --> 18:22.320
I don't need, I don't think a lot of us need to cooperate and have phone calls and,

18:22.320 --> 18:26.600
and, and have secret meetings all the time if we are all fighting the same thing that

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
it's going to be fine.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.240
And I think what I see here is evidence of that.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.040
Now, I don't know, but it sure seems kind of cool.

18:33.040 --> 18:39.320
I didn't notice it until now, but this is January 17th, 2024, how to fake pandemics

18:39.320 --> 18:44.760
in four easy steps, due diligence and art is Sasha Latypova's SubStack.

18:44.760 --> 18:50.000
And here she said, she gives a shout out to, to, uh, John Beaudoin, who I consider to

18:50.000 --> 18:54.760
be a really hard working guy who's got a great signal with regard to where the mortality

18:54.760 --> 18:57.120
came from and didn't come from during the entire pandemic.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.840
And he's got a lot of good information about the fact that the protocols were likely murder.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.840
And I love that.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.440
And I love John's work.

19:04.440 --> 19:09.600
And so her, um, saying that that's the case is, uh, is also really cool.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.120
Then down here, she's saying that the Spanish flu is also a fake pandemic.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.080
So that's something that I know my friend, Mark Kulacz would agree with wholeheartedly.

19:17.080 --> 19:25.400
So I mean, two, two, whoops, so so far, she's digging all the bells.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.040
I mean, this is great.

19:27.040 --> 19:31.120
Pandemics are also not possible via science in what is called gain of function research,

19:31.120 --> 19:36.520
which amounts to mostly ridiculous attempts at software enabled sorcery, making soups

19:36.520 --> 19:40.440
of chemical mix with literally shit.

19:40.440 --> 19:44.320
As I discussed you in my previous article, yes, toxic chemicals and shit cause poisoning,

19:44.320 --> 19:46.040
but this does not spread itself.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.760
Of course, these labs should be shut down a waste of money and hazard thanks to Merrill

19:49.760 --> 19:55.560
Nass for this new, um, bulletin of atomic scientists where they talk about lab leaks

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
and stuff like that.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.120
So here we go again.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.680
One way to look at this is that, that lab leaks mean that we're in trouble and there's

20:02.680 --> 20:07.800
going to be another, uh, pandemic or another way to look at it is is that the background

20:07.800 --> 20:10.120
is much richer.

20:10.120 --> 20:15.760
The background is much hotter in terms of PCR and in terms of coronavirus sequences and

20:15.760 --> 20:20.760
coronavirus diversity than any of these people want to admit, especially because our actual

20:20.760 --> 20:26.320
surveillance of the nine billion people on the planet is ridiculously low and has always

20:26.320 --> 20:31.920
been except for these last two or three years from 2020 onward.

20:31.920 --> 20:32.920
And so this is cool.

20:32.920 --> 20:38.600
This is a shout out to Merrill Nass, Merrill Nass being, um, a woman who has her own new

20:38.600 --> 20:41.920
nonprofit called doors to freedom or something like that.

20:41.920 --> 20:48.200
And also was a longtime advisor to CHD, uh, an organization that you and I both know

20:48.200 --> 20:50.440
that I really, really admire.

20:50.440 --> 20:56.600
So this is still, I mean, now we're on page two and we're, we're still just, you know,

20:56.600 --> 21:00.360
so hey, I mean, work hard, die rich, I guess is working out for her.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.400
And all pandemics to date have been faked by the military industrial globalist cabal,

21:04.400 --> 21:09.760
which sounds kind of like what we've come to the conclusion of over the last year or

21:09.760 --> 21:10.760
so.

21:10.760 --> 21:17.680
Um, sorry, JFK, RFK, despite your desire to appear middle ground, um, by including a

21:17.680 --> 21:23.400
lie with a majorly true majority truthful statement, COVID pandemic was also faked using

21:23.400 --> 21:25.640
the same basic script actors and funding.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
So that's interesting.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.640
I wonder what that video is.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.880
I won't play that now.

21:28.880 --> 21:34.200
But again, here she is kind of criticizing, uh, Bobby Kennedy for not going far enough,

21:34.200 --> 21:41.000
um, to say that the pandemic is fake, which is very, very interesting because again, remember,

21:41.000 --> 21:48.040
if they used enough clones, then from a molecular biological perspective, the pandemic doesn't

21:48.040 --> 21:51.800
need to be faked.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.640
And I think what we're dealing with here now is just realizing that there is a way to apply

21:56.640 --> 22:02.280
these techniques with the proper investment, the proper, the proper, whatever.

22:02.280 --> 22:06.920
I mean, you can call it Keystone cop if you want to, but moving viruses around is quite

22:06.920 --> 22:12.120
a bit easier than moving WMDs or, or missiles or things like that.

22:12.120 --> 22:16.360
I mean, we're talking about very small quantities being able to do in theory, very big things,

22:16.360 --> 22:23.640
especially if the only thing you want to do is have a PCR or a sequencing signal.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.960
Because the DNA could be put on people's clothes.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.920
It could be contaminated on swabs.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.000
It could be put purposefully in tests.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.760
There are a million ways to make enough DNA for this signal to go all around the world

22:34.760 --> 22:39.480
for sure, not by itself.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.440
And that's the point.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.680
That's the argument we're making.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.680
So this is okay.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.320
I mean, that's not bad.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.640
And then whoa, hey, look, what is the pandemic script?

22:48.640 --> 22:49.960
Let's hear it from the horse's mouth.

22:49.960 --> 22:57.120
And she shows James Giordano and the actual video that I've been using for almost three

22:57.120 --> 22:58.960
years now.

22:58.960 --> 23:04.600
It's hard to believe that she didn't see it on our work.

23:04.600 --> 23:10.320
And it's, you know, okay, I don't care because these ideas are getting out.

23:10.320 --> 23:18.600
If she never attributes this to me, but more people through her Substack come to realize

23:18.600 --> 23:20.240
that the pandemic could have been.

23:20.240 --> 23:27.680
And it's a really good possibility that it was almost exclusively a lie, a coordinated

23:27.680 --> 23:31.240
spectacular commitment to lies.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.880
And that lie being the worst case scenario, then this is great.

23:35.880 --> 23:46.000
You have to see if this is worst case scenario, this is imitation, which is flattery, right?

23:46.000 --> 23:50.840
This case scenario, it's just, I guess, great minds think alike or something like that.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
But this is good.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
This is good.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.200
I consider it kind of, I don't know, I didn't see it until now, so I can call it a little

23:57.200 --> 23:58.200
birthday present.

23:58.200 --> 24:04.760
Anyway, I think the most important thing to see is that as everybody makes and fans the

24:04.760 --> 24:11.720
flames of hatred and frustration over Cooey being a divider or Cooey being out of his

24:11.720 --> 24:16.920
lane or whatever Cooey is doing six hour Scooby-Doo's instead of doing sequence searches

24:16.920 --> 24:23.180
on NCBI, we don't talk about these messages, which I think are the most important ones.

24:23.180 --> 24:29.480
If we can pass on to our children the immunology and general biology and appreciation for the

24:29.480 --> 24:34.840
sacred to understand that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent

24:34.840 --> 24:40.000
of augmenting the immune system is dumb, then our children and more importantly, our grandchildren

24:40.000 --> 24:42.360
will be fine.

24:42.360 --> 24:46.920
If we can teach our college age kids the transfection and healthy humans should be considered

24:46.920 --> 24:53.400
criminally negligent, we can turn those college age kids on their college faculty.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.120
Because it is their college faculty and I would go so far as to say specifically their

24:57.120 --> 25:03.040
natural sciences faculty, their chemistry faculty, their biochemistry faculty, their

25:03.040 --> 25:09.200
biology faculty, their medical school faculties, they should all be turned on.

25:09.200 --> 25:14.160
They should not necessarily be forced to kneel in the hallway or something like that,

25:14.160 --> 25:18.760
but every one of them should be forced to collectively admit as a faculty that they

25:18.760 --> 25:24.720
made a huge mistake by not stepping in front of this train.

25:24.720 --> 25:29.000
Everybody at the University of Pittsburgh should be sending me a card saying sorry dude

25:29.000 --> 25:32.560
were you right, I know they won't.

25:32.560 --> 25:38.720
But I'm saying that if we teach our college kids these truths, then that possibility becomes

25:38.720 --> 25:43.400
closer to reality, we're not going to make that happen, we can't make that happen because

25:43.400 --> 25:49.920
we aren't the ones this battle is about, we aren't the conscious that they're fighting

25:49.920 --> 25:55.160
for, they're fighting for our kids consciousness.

25:55.160 --> 26:00.240
And so in order to help for this, I think that I went back to that list, oh no I guess

26:00.240 --> 26:05.620
I didn't, I thought I did, and this is the first thing on the list, seeding the gain

26:05.620 --> 26:09.820
of function narrative with scientific programs and peer reviewed publications for years before

26:09.820 --> 26:11.340
the pandemic.

26:11.340 --> 26:20.780
Yesterday we watched a video from 2007, which was a bad video lecture of Ralph Baric,

26:20.780 --> 26:25.820
which again I was, I'm still, I still assume it's a sketchy video because it was put up

26:25.820 --> 26:30.820
too late is put up by a weird account that I think is kind of associated maybe possibly

26:30.820 --> 26:32.780
with George Webb.

26:32.780 --> 26:35.340
And it had audio that was edited.

26:35.340 --> 26:36.900
The video was really poor.

26:36.900 --> 26:40.340
And so I'm not sure whether the video is just poor and then people thought you wouldn't

26:40.340 --> 26:42.060
be able to get anything from it.

26:42.060 --> 26:45.660
And they needed to edit those two parts out early because they said something crucial

26:45.660 --> 26:48.540
about his understanding of the infectious cycle.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.100
I'm not really sure.

26:50.100 --> 26:55.460
But I'm assuming that that video in some way or another was make meant to make us Scooby-Doo,

26:55.460 --> 26:58.060
remove the mask of Barrick and say, wow, it's really true.

26:58.060 --> 27:01.660
Now that you remind me, I forgot how incriminating these videos were.

27:01.660 --> 27:06.740
And I think this could be actually an instructive way to push that farther because last night

27:06.740 --> 27:11.340
I think our conclusion was is that Barrick had a number of ideas on how to attenuate

27:11.340 --> 27:18.740
viruses to make vaccines, how to prevent de-attentuation in coronaviruses was big on his radar.

27:18.740 --> 27:25.620
And he was looking to harness what I think he saw as a more ubiquitous signal in nature

27:25.620 --> 27:28.740
and use it as a biotechnology.

27:28.740 --> 27:33.300
And I proposed this three years ago already when I was starting to kind of understand

27:33.300 --> 27:37.100
what was going on with coronavirus and had listened to a lot of what he said and had

27:37.100 --> 27:39.060
listened to this particular symposium.

27:39.060 --> 27:43.540
But now I would like to revisit it because I think it's a really important symposium

27:43.540 --> 27:52.780
and I noticed that my friend Mark Kulacz at Housatonic ITS had built a webpage around

27:52.780 --> 27:53.780
it.

27:54.780 --> 28:00.180
Here, let me clip that out and send it to you on the chat so that everybody can find

28:00.180 --> 28:01.180
it.

28:01.180 --> 28:08.940
If you're not familiar, his website and show are one of the only advertisements that

28:08.940 --> 28:14.380
I have in the beginning of my stream.

28:14.380 --> 28:18.620
And this website has all of the videos there.

28:18.620 --> 28:20.420
It has some of the brochures.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.500
That's where I got this little thing from.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.980
And I didn't peruse the whole thing.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.340
I just queued this thing up.

28:25.340 --> 28:28.260
So this is actually queued up on YouTube.

28:28.260 --> 28:33.180
It's not, I queued it up directly on YouTube, but it's also, the link is also available

28:33.180 --> 28:34.860
on Mark's website.

28:34.860 --> 28:41.020
And I can't stress enough how important it is, this work that Mark does, all this archiving

28:41.020 --> 28:46.100
and all of this, you know, putting everything in one place is so important in light of the

28:46.100 --> 28:50.300
fact that a lot of times I think some of this stuff is just not really archived on purpose.

28:50.300 --> 28:54.220
It's not that it's not out there, but nobody's making an extra effort to be sure that it's

28:54.220 --> 28:55.220
available.

28:55.220 --> 28:59.980
And I think Mark has done just a absolutely breathtaking job of collating some of this

28:59.980 --> 29:06.060
stuff together so that when you follow people through their career or you follow people

29:06.060 --> 29:11.820
through their education or through the development of their ideas, you can really, you know,

29:11.820 --> 29:13.860
link to link to link all on one site.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.940
I mean, it's really a master work.

29:15.940 --> 29:16.940
So kudos to Mark.

29:16.940 --> 29:17.940
Here we go.

29:18.940 --> 29:22.460
Um, an excellent session on the potential.

29:22.460 --> 29:28.020
I do have it at normal speed because they have, they're speaking a lot.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.740
They say a mouthful.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.500
So we'll see how far we can get before I have to go to the game.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.740
I got at least an hour.

29:34.740 --> 29:40.220
So let me ask the four panelists to come up now and we can so get settled in and get

29:40.220 --> 29:50.540
comfortable.

29:50.540 --> 29:55.460
There is King clone.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.220
And that's a dort murder, Dortmer.

29:58.220 --> 30:03.820
He's the guy from Norvartis that makes synthetic flu viruses for vaccines.

30:03.820 --> 30:09.140
And then the third guy is, um, who's that dude?

30:09.140 --> 30:10.340
And then this is denizen.

30:10.340 --> 30:17.300
This is the remdesivir guy and this is, um, the coronavirus editing guy speaking for

30:17.300 --> 30:20.060
for about five minutes and then we'll have a little crush discussion.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.820
So this is going to be kind of cool.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.700
These two dudes are like hardcore.

30:23.700 --> 30:27.140
This guy makes flu virus every year for the vaccine.

30:27.140 --> 30:29.460
So he's like, he knows all about clones.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.460
Trust me.

30:30.460 --> 30:31.460
I'll make this quick.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.620
Um, maybe the next slide, please.

30:33.620 --> 30:38.700
So I'm going to basically present just a little vignette on how gain of function research

30:38.700 --> 30:47.060
and the regulation around research affects a real world case of trying to apply some

30:47.060 --> 30:48.060
virology to Jeffrey.

30:48.060 --> 30:49.060
How are you?

30:49.060 --> 30:50.060
Good to see you, man.

30:50.060 --> 30:54.180
So just a historical reminder that I think most of you are well aware of.

30:54.180 --> 31:01.500
And that is that in 2009, we had the fastest vaccine response in history, but the vaccine

31:01.500 --> 31:04.540
came to market and substantial quantities after the disease peak.

31:04.540 --> 31:09.780
You can see in the brown curve, a peak occurring about October, no substantial quantity

31:09.780 --> 31:13.260
of vaccine was really in the market until probably getting towards December.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.060
So that's not what you want.

31:15.060 --> 31:22.020
In fact, there is an estimate from Boris et al published in EID emerging infectious diseases

31:22.020 --> 31:27.580
that for every week of acceleration vaccine supply in the US, and this is US centric because

31:27.580 --> 31:33.580
that's where the statistics are, would have been an additional 300,000 to 430,000 US cases.

31:33.580 --> 31:37.540
So while in research, you may think in terms of years, in terms of outbreak and pandemic

31:37.540 --> 31:40.060
response, you have to think in terms of days.

31:40.060 --> 31:47.020
And so here, I think it's important to point out that they really are talking in what I

31:47.020 --> 31:50.300
considered to be at least an honest broker way.

31:50.300 --> 31:54.500
What they're arguing is is that if they don't get the vaccine done till here and the peak

31:54.500 --> 31:59.220
of the epidemic is here, then they're not really saving very many people with this vaccine.

31:59.220 --> 32:04.700
And so ideally, we'd be able to make the vaccine back here and then avoid this peak.

32:04.700 --> 32:09.780
So the assumption is, is that if they had gotten this vaccine into these people that

32:09.780 --> 32:14.140
died or whatever, I guess number of cases per week.

32:14.140 --> 32:19.180
So these cases could have been prevented if they'd gotten the vaccine here earlier.

32:19.180 --> 32:23.060
And that's a, that's a pretty bold statement.

32:23.060 --> 32:27.260
But it's an easy statement to make because according to the scheme that they currently

32:27.260 --> 32:30.220
run, they never have the vaccine ready for the peak.

32:30.220 --> 32:33.140
And so there's no peak to avoid.

32:33.140 --> 32:36.420
And they can just say, well, yeah, look, there's no more flu anymore.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.260
Do you see what I'm saying?

32:38.260 --> 32:43.820
It's a little, it's nice to make this argument, but in making this argument, what they are

32:43.820 --> 32:48.260
admitting is that what they do is worthless.

32:48.260 --> 32:51.540
And in fact, no matter how often they do it, they're always behind.

32:51.540 --> 32:53.020
And so it can't really help.

32:53.020 --> 32:56.060
It might, it might as well leave it.

32:56.060 --> 32:57.660
But then you're not going to make these products.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.660
You're not going to make any money.

32:58.660 --> 33:02.820
You're not going to have this warm base of manufacturing as Robert Malone described it

33:02.820 --> 33:06.580
ready and waiting for when the really big one comes, which is what the argument is.

33:06.580 --> 33:12.920
That also Robert F Kennedy Jr. so eloquently explained on his own podcast when I was there.

33:12.920 --> 33:17.460
So they all have this idea that there is a worst case scenario and we do need to be

33:17.460 --> 33:18.460
prepared for it.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.660
And that's legitimate.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.660
Robert Malone has been saying that for many years now.

33:23.660 --> 33:31.100
Robert F Kennedy Jr. will say that Tony Fauci has said that David Holness said that

33:31.100 --> 33:39.180
Sina Bavari said that they all say that and they all say that vaccines come too late.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.020
And so this is the exact same story.

33:42.020 --> 33:51.180
Now what I want you to make note of is that the same blog that put out the video that

33:51.180 --> 33:56.060
we watched last night that I said was, well, it's okay, it's a little, it's nice.

33:56.060 --> 34:01.180
But what it showed to me was that Berwick was really in earnest working on the biological

34:01.180 --> 34:08.740
potential for good that this coronavirus signal represented to him rather than working on

34:08.740 --> 34:12.220
gain a function dual research kind of crap.

34:12.220 --> 34:14.340
That wasn't even in that story.

34:14.340 --> 34:19.660
Now interestingly, that was from 2007 and now that will blog, the same blog that's written

34:19.660 --> 34:26.740
with, is his name, Leak, and then also with Dr. McCulloch has put up a more recent video

34:26.740 --> 34:32.940
from 2018, which we've watched before, which is Ralph Baric giving another talk about

34:32.940 --> 34:40.700
chimeric coronavirus, but very, very dubiously starting with a 10 minute or 15 minute lecture

34:40.700 --> 34:47.180
about planet wide catastrophes and how often they occur, everything from Carrington events

34:47.180 --> 34:50.940
to tidal waves and super volcanoes.

34:50.940 --> 35:00.620
And then of course he's trying to put pandemics into that category of super cataclysmic events

35:00.620 --> 35:11.500
equivalent to a meteor strike or a solar windstorm, a pole reversal or a pandemic.

35:11.500 --> 35:18.020
So that's a pretty huge change in sales pitch from the 2007, which was, you know,

35:18.020 --> 35:23.300
I work on SARS viruses, SARS went around last year and we're working on trying to understand

35:23.300 --> 35:24.300
it.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.300
Here we go.

35:25.300 --> 35:30.900
Instead, he had this 10 or 15 minute pitch about all the worst case scenarios on the planet

35:30.900 --> 35:39.460
in order to frame his research has aimed precisely at one of these worst case scenario targets.

35:39.460 --> 35:42.860
It's extraordinary.

35:42.860 --> 35:49.660
And so this is 2016 and I would go so far as to say, I don't hear it here yet either.

35:49.660 --> 35:53.100
But that we haven't watched the whole six hours of videos or anything like that.

35:53.100 --> 35:56.260
So this is really about responding to a pandemic.

35:56.260 --> 35:57.260
So I'll let it run again.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.260
I apologize.

35:58.260 --> 36:01.460
I just thought I would point that out that that that video is also there, but I chose

36:01.460 --> 36:07.780
not to watch it because I'm not, I'm not convinced that that's the real Ralph Baric.

36:07.780 --> 36:15.580
I'm not convinced that the real Ralph Baric would open his talk with a 15 minute introduction

36:15.580 --> 36:24.420
into, you know, really, he was kind of, he was kind of speculating about some of these

36:24.420 --> 36:25.420
things.

36:25.420 --> 36:30.420
You know, he doesn't know how how devastating a meteor would be or how the geotechnics works

36:30.420 --> 36:31.420
after a meteor strike.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.660
I mean, what's he talking about?

36:33.660 --> 36:34.660
But he did.

36:35.340 --> 36:38.540
I mean, if I was a neuroscientist, I would never start with that.

36:38.540 --> 36:42.060
Even if I worked on pre-on disease and thought that pre-on disease could wipe out the planet

36:42.060 --> 36:47.860
like some people do, I wouldn't start my talk with, well, there are Carington events and

36:47.860 --> 36:55.420
big meteors and pole reversals and tidal waves and, and, and then my stuff, pre-ons.

36:55.420 --> 36:57.780
I mean, that's just crazy anyway.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.780
Here we go.

36:58.780 --> 36:59.780
Next slide.

36:59.780 --> 37:06.580
All in response to that in 2009 event, we worked with the synthetic genomics vaccines

37:06.580 --> 37:07.580
Inc.

37:07.580 --> 37:10.860
One of Craig Viner's organizations and BARDA, part of the U.S. government.

37:10.860 --> 37:16.900
BARDA and the synthetic vaccine or synthetic genome, what did he say?

37:16.900 --> 37:22.020
So they're basically synthesizing, look, they're assembling oligos into flu gene segments

37:22.020 --> 37:26.620
enzymatically, rescuing flu viruses, they're designing and synthesizing.

37:26.620 --> 37:32.500
So they're doing, what I'm talking about, they're manufacturing viruses and they're

37:32.500 --> 37:39.380
making viral stocks using recombinant DNA and RNA technology in order to create viral

37:39.380 --> 37:45.020
stocks that are more homogenous than can be made with traditional culturing methods.

37:45.020 --> 37:47.620
That's my argument.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.740
It's not that I know the fine details.

37:50.740 --> 37:54.420
It's just that I know this is fundamental.

37:54.420 --> 37:58.220
It is a fundamental mythology of all RNA virology.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.380
That's what it is.

38:01.380 --> 38:08.340
And so here you hear him kind of talking around the fact that they are making synthetic clones

38:08.340 --> 38:09.340
of flu viruses.

38:09.340 --> 38:11.700
I'm going to back it up for a couple.

38:11.700 --> 38:16.020
Come up with the scenes, so while in research you may think in terms of years, in terms

38:16.020 --> 38:20.020
of outbreak and pandemic response, you have to think in terms of days.

38:20.020 --> 38:21.020
Next slide.

38:21.020 --> 38:27.860
In response to that in 2009 event, we worked with the Synthetic Genomics Vaccines Inc.,

38:27.860 --> 38:33.020
one of Craig Vintner's organizations, and Bardev, I'm sorry, who Craig Vintner?

38:33.020 --> 38:34.020
Craig Vintner's organizations?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.020
I didn't hear that.

38:35.020 --> 38:36.020
Did I hear that correctly?

38:36.020 --> 38:37.020
Is that what he said?

38:37.020 --> 38:38.020
Hold on.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.020
Whoa.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
Whoa.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.020
Ah.

38:41.020 --> 38:46.820
In response to that in 2009 event, we worked with the Synthetic Genomics Vaccines Inc.,

38:46.820 --> 38:50.860
one of Craig Vintner's organizations, and Bardev, part of the U.S. government, to come

38:50.860 --> 38:56.940
up with the Citizen Inc. 2009 event, we worked with the Synthetic Genomics Vaccines Inc.,

38:56.940 --> 39:01.060
one of Craig Vintner's organizations, and Bardev, part of the U.S. government, to come

39:01.060 --> 39:04.660
up with the system to make vaccine viruses much faster.

39:04.660 --> 39:11.900
We synthesize the genes based on sequence available, the synthetic Genomics Vaccines

39:11.900 --> 39:16.460
Inc., one of Craig Vintner's organizations, and Bardev, the U.S. government, to come up

39:16.460 --> 39:19.940
with a system to make vaccine viruses much faster.

39:19.940 --> 39:25.340
We synthesize the genes based on sequence available, basically, on the web, and we use

39:25.340 --> 39:30.100
those to generate the viruses that we would use to make a vaccine.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.460
Did you hear what he just said?

39:33.460 --> 39:40.460
The system was based on genes that were synthesized from sequences found on the web.

39:40.460 --> 39:48.500
I mean, we synthesize the genes based on sequence available, basically, on the web,

39:48.500 --> 39:52.340
and we use those to generate the viruses that we would use to make a vaccine.

39:52.340 --> 39:57.500
We use those to generate the viruses.

39:57.500 --> 40:03.380
We use those to generate the viruses.

40:03.380 --> 40:08.980
So I think what you're missing here, and I think this is what Kevin and everybody on

40:08.980 --> 40:15.420
that side wants us to miss, is that packaging viruses is just transfecting things.

40:15.420 --> 40:20.580
That's what they do when they are transfected with these genomes.

40:20.580 --> 40:21.580
They make exosomes.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.180
They package stuff up.

40:23.180 --> 40:28.420
Sometimes the whole genome gets out, sometimes some garbage RNA from these subgenomic gets

40:28.420 --> 40:29.420
packaged.

40:29.420 --> 40:34.180
It doesn't matter because in the end, they're looking for a collective signal.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.180
If you...

40:35.180 --> 40:37.740
Do I have that on?

40:37.740 --> 40:38.740
Yeah.

40:38.740 --> 40:44.100
If you look at how they sequence something and you see, okay, here's the whole genome.

40:44.100 --> 40:48.220
And then when they do a sequencing reaction, and you'll see this in any paper that you

40:48.220 --> 40:53.100
look at, including the one where they sequence the first SARS genome, they'll have all kinds

40:53.100 --> 40:54.660
of fragments.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.660
And I get it.

40:55.660 --> 40:56.660
They overlap.

40:56.660 --> 41:01.020
And so when they overlap, then you can have all these sequences.

41:01.020 --> 41:05.100
In some places, they'll have lots of coverage, like here, when the end protein, they'll have

41:05.100 --> 41:09.860
lots of coverage of the end, very small coverage here, and maybe there's more coverage

41:09.860 --> 41:14.500
on this end of the genome, something like that, but they're all little tiny fragments.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.420
And then what they're doing is they're taking an average here.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.620
So here, they get this base a lot, right?

41:19.620 --> 41:23.020
So then they assume that this is a really good read.

41:23.020 --> 41:25.340
And then over here, this would be a really low read.

41:25.340 --> 41:29.620
And so they might have also a graph over here that looks like a confidence interval, and

41:29.620 --> 41:31.420
it'll get lower over here.

41:31.420 --> 41:34.820
And then they'll say that they're really sure about this part of the genome, and not

41:34.820 --> 41:36.380
so sure about this part of the genome.

41:36.380 --> 41:42.820
But then they'll still tell you that this is the sequence of the virus.

41:42.820 --> 41:46.900
They'll still tell you that this is the sequence of the virus, and this is the clone RNA that

41:46.900 --> 41:49.820
they will make with a coronavirus.

41:49.820 --> 41:54.900
And with flu, it's a bit more difficult because with flu, I believe there are eight segments

41:54.900 --> 42:01.180
of the genome that are thought to be circular and need to be regulated and copied separately.

42:01.180 --> 42:04.500
And so with flu virus, it's a little more complicated.

42:04.500 --> 42:10.820
And they're also flu viruses, um, bring their RNA into the nucleus, which is also really

42:10.820 --> 42:14.940
interesting because I don't think the coronaviruses do anything with the nucleus.

42:14.940 --> 42:19.540
So that's also a big difference between coronavirus and flu virus, but it's important to understand

42:19.540 --> 42:24.700
that what Dortmer at Mercer, or whatever his name is saying here, is that they worked

42:24.700 --> 42:30.580
with a company called Synthetic Genomics Vaccines, Incorporated.

42:30.580 --> 42:31.580
And that's with Venner.

42:31.580 --> 42:35.980
I might know if I'm spelling his name right, Craig Venner is the guy who wanted to build

42:35.980 --> 42:41.340
a whole database of full human genomes and then sell it back to the pharmaceutical companies.

42:41.340 --> 42:46.140
And so you could give him your, or he would sequence your whole genome for like $3,000

42:46.140 --> 42:52.420
and then also use that as data that he could then, as a database sell back to, he's a really

42:52.420 --> 42:53.420
creepy dude.

42:53.420 --> 42:59.100
And he has been in really a trans human activist for a very, very long time.

42:59.100 --> 43:02.860
I have no doubt in my mind that anybody that worked on the Human Genome Project would have

43:02.860 --> 43:05.380
met Craig Venner at some point.

43:05.380 --> 43:14.620
Anyway, the BARDA partnered up with Novartis and with this company from Venner to synthesize

43:14.620 --> 43:20.660
the genes and make the viruses that they were going to make in the vaccines.

43:20.660 --> 43:26.780
And so, yeah, let's go back and see if we can keep this going.

43:26.780 --> 43:29.340
In theory, it would take about four and a half days.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.420
In fact, we had a test in which we did.

43:31.420 --> 43:36.340
In four and a half days, we went from genes being transmitted to us to a vaccine virus.

43:36.340 --> 43:37.700
Next slide.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.620
And we had a chance to be in three and a half days.

43:39.620 --> 43:42.340
In fact, make a vaccine is much faster.

43:42.340 --> 43:47.460
We synthesize the genes based on sequence available, basically on the web.

43:47.460 --> 43:52.340
And we use those to generate the viruses that we would use to make a vaccine.

43:52.340 --> 43:54.900
In theory, it would take about four and a half days.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.380
In fact, we went from four and a half days.

43:57.380 --> 44:01.940
In four and a half days, we went from genes being transmitted to us to a vaccine virus.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.300
Next slide.

44:03.300 --> 44:06.220
And we had a chance to actually implement that.

44:06.220 --> 44:10.460
In 2013, we went on April 1, Easter.

44:10.460 --> 44:16.020
We got a call saying that, in fact, there was this new H7N9 strain out in China, had

44:16.020 --> 44:17.460
caused fatalities.

44:17.460 --> 44:23.700
The Chinese CDC in a very far-thinking move put the sequence out on the web.

44:23.700 --> 44:28.580
By Monday, the genes were being synthesized, the gene synthesis in California completed

44:28.580 --> 44:30.140
by Tuesday.

44:30.140 --> 44:35.180
The genes synthesized, received in California for viral rescue on Wednesday and sent to

44:35.180 --> 44:38.260
the Centers for Disease Control for their response as well.

44:38.260 --> 44:43.540
By Saturday, we had the vaccine virus confirmed at any by the start of the next week.

44:43.540 --> 44:45.980
It was really fast.

44:45.980 --> 44:47.580
And then the next part starts.

44:47.580 --> 44:48.780
Next slide.

44:48.780 --> 44:53.260
All that activity is at the very beginning of that timeline you see there.

44:53.260 --> 44:57.100
This is the timeline from that same starting point when the sequences were posted on the

44:57.100 --> 45:02.380
web to where we started inoculating our first large-scale fermenter to make clinical trial

45:02.380 --> 45:03.380
material.

45:03.380 --> 45:04.380
It took months.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.220
It was not the science.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.980
It was, predominantly, the regulation.

45:08.980 --> 45:10.780
We couldn't do the work in the United States.

45:10.780 --> 45:11.780
Why?

45:11.780 --> 45:15.180
We couldn't get a USDA permit out of concerns at this virus, which actually doesn't cause

45:15.180 --> 45:19.380
disease and chickens might infect chickens.

45:19.380 --> 45:20.940
We had a lot of other issues as well.

45:20.940 --> 45:25.820
So we actually ended up doing this work primarily in Germany and then taking the vaccine back

45:25.820 --> 45:30.820
to the United States so that we could actually do the clinical trial.

45:30.820 --> 45:36.380
Germany is an interesting place to do it now, isn't it?

45:36.380 --> 45:41.300
Germany has not been on the sidelines of this pandemic narrative, not on the sidelines of

45:41.300 --> 45:46.060
the Western world's pandemic response in pandemic theater.

45:46.060 --> 45:52.860
Germany has been very high up there with regard to the games.

45:52.860 --> 45:55.140
Very high up there, sitting at the table very early.

45:55.140 --> 46:01.060
I find that very curious looking back from this perspective.

46:01.060 --> 46:02.220
Next slide.

46:02.220 --> 46:05.820
So why am I bringing all this stuff up and what's the relationship to gain a function

46:05.820 --> 46:06.820
research?

46:06.820 --> 46:10.100
In fact, there are little lessons scattered throughout this story.

46:10.180 --> 46:15.060
First, in those initial days when we got the sequence, did we use sequence motif data

46:15.060 --> 46:18.020
to guide what we were going to do to actually make a vaccine?

46:18.020 --> 46:19.540
The answer is yes.

46:19.540 --> 46:25.420
Now we certainly didn't use the transmissibility data because there is non-forage 7 and 9

46:25.420 --> 46:28.820
and those data are complicated and at this point difficult to apply.

46:28.820 --> 46:32.740
But we did certainly look for a polybasic cleavage site and had there been one, we would have

46:32.740 --> 46:34.060
gotten rid of it.

46:34.060 --> 46:41.260
So there's a mention of a polybasic cleavage site and I do believe it is this actual talk

46:41.260 --> 46:48.820
oftentimes that is referenced by Charles Rixey as them admitting that fear and cleavage

46:48.820 --> 46:52.580
site is dangerous and that if they have it in a vaccine they remove it and this is some

46:52.580 --> 46:55.820
kind of big deal.

46:55.820 --> 46:59.580
I don't really think it is.

46:59.580 --> 47:06.140
It might make some for some reason or another, it might make the vaccine virus more toxic

47:06.140 --> 47:13.540
or more infectious or more difficult to attenuate or it might make it too immunogenic.

47:13.540 --> 47:19.100
I don't know but I don't think that it's some kind of up fear and cleavage site.

47:19.100 --> 47:24.500
Now it's a pandemic like a Carrington event.

47:24.500 --> 47:28.740
So be careful with that but it is here and he's going to say it again in a second.

47:28.740 --> 47:33.780
We also looked in the neuraminidase gene for markers of oseltamivir resistance and some

47:33.780 --> 47:39.220
of them we found them and we either did not synthesize those strains or we mutated those

47:39.220 --> 47:45.020
genes to eliminate the oseltamivir resistance in the vaccine strains that we made.

47:45.020 --> 47:51.660
So we did use genetic markers for phenotypic traits to affect what we actually made as

47:51.660 --> 47:54.300
the vaccine.

47:54.300 --> 48:03.660
Now the fact that in this case we're really slowed by very well intentioned regulations

48:03.660 --> 48:06.860
to protect basically the food supply in the United States.

48:06.860 --> 48:10.100
However that really meant that we could not in a timely way make the vaccine in the United

48:10.100 --> 48:11.100
States.

48:11.100 --> 48:15.540
Now no one who passed those regulations and forced them had the intention we're going

48:15.540 --> 48:21.260
to slow down human vaccine development however that was the effect.

48:21.260 --> 48:26.100
Had that been a high pathogenetic avian influenza strain we couldn't have done any

48:26.100 --> 48:27.820
of this work.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.580
Why?

48:30.580 --> 48:33.180
Regulations passed for the very good reasons they want to prevent people who have ill

48:33.180 --> 48:38.340
intention from doing bad things with the viruses basically select agent or regulations.

48:38.340 --> 48:41.580
What it meant we couldn't have synthesized this virus.

48:41.580 --> 48:48.300
Now you can't really put an entire manufacturing facility under select agent conditions and

48:48.300 --> 48:53.620
still have a factory that can produce seasonal vaccines in an economically competitive way.

48:53.620 --> 48:58.620
As a result we would have had to wait probably months to start the work, at least a month

48:58.620 --> 48:59.900
maybe more to start the work.

48:59.900 --> 49:04.500
Had it been a more severe strain had that poly basic cleavage site actually been present

49:04.500 --> 49:05.900
instead of absent.

49:05.900 --> 49:12.100
Again nobody who passed the select agent regulations that my goal is to endanger Americans and

49:12.100 --> 49:14.780
prevent the vaccines coming forward in a timely way.

49:14.780 --> 49:15.780
Is that the effect?

49:16.100 --> 49:20.540
Well we haven't had one of those yet but I can tell you from my company I couldn't do

49:20.540 --> 49:28.660
any of this technology if it were a high pathogenetic avian strain clearly counterproductive.

49:28.660 --> 49:31.460
If it were a high pathogen that would be solid.

49:31.460 --> 49:33.580
Thank you very much.

49:33.580 --> 49:35.100
Hey.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.500
Thank you.

49:38.500 --> 49:41.900
Thank you baby.

49:41.900 --> 49:45.260
Alright I got a little warm brownie and some coffee here.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.180
I wanted to say something about this.

49:47.180 --> 49:48.980
What did I want to say?

49:48.980 --> 49:58.060
What he's what he's explaining here is that the flu vaccine if it were to be aimed or

49:58.060 --> 50:06.220
be required to be aimed at a flu that had a poly basic cleavage site in it they would

50:06.220 --> 50:14.780
not be able to engineer that poly basic cleavage site into the vaccine strain because it wouldn't

50:14.780 --> 50:15.780
be allowed.

50:15.780 --> 50:20.300
So isn't that a strange isn't I really think we're hearing that correctly and I find that

50:20.300 --> 50:27.540
a very strange attitude because I thought that having a the poly basic cleavage site there

50:27.540 --> 50:31.180
would be terrible and that's why they would take it out.

50:31.180 --> 50:38.380
But what he's saying is that if they needed to put it in because a vaccine against a strain

50:38.380 --> 50:43.580
with a poly basic cleavage site was needed they wouldn't be able to do it and that would

50:43.580 --> 50:50.020
be a severe handicap to responding to a particularly virulent flu.

50:50.020 --> 50:54.220
I really think that's what we're hearing here which is really very very interesting.

50:54.220 --> 51:03.420
It's exactly wow that's that's funny 300,000 who pass the select agent regulations that

51:03.420 --> 51:07.700
my goal is to endanger Americans and prevent the vaccines coming forward in a timely way.

51:07.700 --> 51:08.700
Is that the effect?

51:08.700 --> 51:13.460
Well we haven't had one of those yet but I can tell you from my company I couldn't do

51:13.460 --> 51:19.020
any I couldn't apply any of this technology if it were a high pathogenicity, avian strain

51:19.020 --> 51:21.620
clearly counterproductive.

51:21.620 --> 51:26.780
If we were a high path even outbreak you saw there was 300,000 to 430,000 infections per

51:26.780 --> 51:33.500
week are prevented by every week of acceleration of vaccine supply if you got a 10 percent.

51:33.500 --> 51:37.700
Now that's a model right he's modeled if we got the vaccine out earlier than we could

51:37.700 --> 51:43.100
project that we would save this many lives that assumes probably a 100 percent of activity

51:43.100 --> 51:48.100
I mean it's our effectiveness of the vaccine it's really scary how he's talking right here

51:48.100 --> 51:53.260
because it's it's in a room full of virologists that are all buying into this as being pretty

51:53.260 --> 51:59.620
much okay when it's really just a lot of it's a lot of big talk that's it oh it's warm

51:59.620 --> 52:00.620
sweet.

52:00.620 --> 52:05.100
And to 50 percent mortality rate you can project that to the number of US deaths that would

52:05.100 --> 52:08.580
occur and you can extrapolate that to the rest of the world.

52:08.580 --> 52:14.100
So when I look at the gain of function debate I have a lot of sympathy for the notion that

52:14.100 --> 52:17.980
we there are certain experiments that are very very dangerous to do.

52:17.980 --> 52:22.980
I also know from a really practical pragmatic experience of trying to get vaccines out in

52:22.980 --> 52:30.060
real time that very well intentioned regulation has unintended consequences that can be quite

52:30.060 --> 52:31.700
severe.

52:31.700 --> 52:36.700
So if adaptation of vaccine viruses to increase growth in HA yield or the more modern synthetic

52:36.700 --> 52:42.660
equivalents of doing that in manufacturing when it captured by gain of function regulations

52:42.660 --> 52:47.140
or other precautions additional unintended impediments to the timely vaccine supply could

52:47.140 --> 52:48.140
be created.

52:48.140 --> 52:50.220
And I'll stop there.

52:50.220 --> 52:52.700
Okay thank you.

52:52.700 --> 52:59.380
Our next speaker is Ralph Baric from University of North Carolina kind of the first slide.

52:59.380 --> 53:03.740
I'd like to start off by saying that no approved vaccines are therapeutics for SARS or MERS

53:03.740 --> 53:09.260
Coronavirus and we are currently in midst of an ongoing outbreak with about 950 cases

53:09.260 --> 53:11.660
and a 40 percent mortality rate.

53:11.660 --> 53:12.660
Next slide.

53:12.660 --> 53:17.060
I really want to focus on two stories one is how restrictions are reduced public health

53:17.060 --> 53:21.940
preparedness to respond to future SARS outbreaks and then I want to talk about how restrictions

53:21.940 --> 53:29.660
in animal model development will influence vaccine outcomes specifically noting the example

53:29.660 --> 53:34.340
of the vaccine it is to immune pathology associated with the SARS vaccine.

53:34.340 --> 53:39.260
And in the process I want to sort of debunk the idea that there are safe and alternative

53:39.260 --> 53:44.700
experiment approaches sometimes they give the wrong answers next slide.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.460
Whoa.

53:46.460 --> 53:49.180
Two stories.

53:49.180 --> 53:52.100
Restrictions will reduce public health preparedness.

53:52.100 --> 53:55.900
This is restrictions on gain of function.

53:55.900 --> 54:02.340
Functions on animal model development increases risk of vaccine induced immune pathology

54:02.340 --> 54:06.540
and mortality in human populations.

54:06.540 --> 54:12.620
So he thinks that he can save vaccine injuries by first using animal models to develop them.

54:12.620 --> 54:19.300
And finally he wants to debunk the concept that ethical and safe alternative experimental

54:19.300 --> 54:24.500
approaches exist that provide equivalent information is gain of function studies.

54:24.500 --> 54:25.500
That's cool.

54:25.500 --> 54:27.260
Everyone's here.

54:27.260 --> 54:33.540
So during the SARS outbreak of 2002, 2004 there are 8,000 cases and a 10 percent mortality

54:33.540 --> 54:39.140
rate and the original vaccine target included CIVIT and human strains that are about 99 percent

54:39.140 --> 54:42.500
identical and they're shown here on this sort of phylogenetic tree.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
Next slide.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.980
Since 2004 there's been no cases of SARS.

54:46.980 --> 54:50.980
Most of them think the viruses extinct in the wild.

54:50.980 --> 54:58.420
But as metagenomic sequencing has been applied, it's fairly clear that there are a large

54:58.420 --> 55:02.700
pool of related bad coronaviruses with 5 to 30 percent sequence difference in the spike

55:02.700 --> 55:05.220
like a protein which are shown right here.

55:05.220 --> 55:09.860
And there's been recognition in the field that vaccines and therapeutics not only need

55:09.860 --> 55:15.820
to target the epidemic strains, but they also have to be prepared to deal with pre-pandemic

55:15.820 --> 55:17.660
strains that might emerge in the future.

55:17.660 --> 55:22.580
And so the central question is are there other SARS-like strains that have pre-pandemic

55:22.580 --> 55:23.580
potential?

55:23.580 --> 55:25.980
And if so, we'll have vaccines and drugs.

55:25.980 --> 55:31.580
Here it's called pre-pandemic potential and it sounds like they dropped that P at some

55:31.580 --> 55:32.580
point.

55:32.580 --> 55:33.580
Let's work.

55:33.580 --> 55:34.580
Next slide.

55:34.580 --> 55:39.660
So we and others have synthesized the spikes of these genes shown here with the red arrows

55:39.660 --> 55:44.220
and then applied two different assays to ask questions about the pre-pandemic potential.

55:44.220 --> 55:45.780
Next slide.

55:45.780 --> 55:50.700
The first is using pseudotypes and so this is a safe ethical alternative approach that

55:50.700 --> 55:54.500
basically coats the virus and the spike and then you can ask whether any of these bad

55:54.500 --> 55:58.420
coronaviruses can use the humanase-2 receptor for entry.

55:58.420 --> 56:03.940
And if you look at the top part of that panel, you can see that the WIV-1 and the SARS coronavirus.

56:03.940 --> 56:07.980
I like how ethical alternative up there is in quotes, that's pretty funny.

56:07.980 --> 56:12.780
So you make a pseudovirus, I think they actually make pseudoviruses of the HIV virus or something

56:12.780 --> 56:15.900
which is comically ethical.

56:15.900 --> 56:17.300
I don't think that that's dangerous.

56:17.300 --> 56:21.460
I'm just saying how it appears to the lay person, it doesn't read better, that's for

56:21.460 --> 56:22.460
sure.

56:22.460 --> 56:25.660
Our strains both can use the humanase-2 receptor.

56:25.660 --> 56:27.700
WIV-1 is a bad coronavirus.

56:27.700 --> 56:33.020
It encodes three of the five contact interface sites that engage the ACE receptor so the

56:33.020 --> 56:35.140
data makes perfect sense.

56:35.140 --> 56:39.020
The other bad strains have much more variation and so it makes sense that they can't use

56:39.020 --> 56:40.860
the ACE-2 receptor.

56:40.860 --> 56:44.820
When you make chimeric viruses that encode these spike like a protein, this is part of

56:44.820 --> 56:50.860
the virus particle, notice that the SHCO-1-4 strain can now replicate efficiently in cells

56:50.860 --> 56:54.340
expressing the humanase-2 receptor.

56:54.340 --> 56:59.500
These data clearly indicate that pseudotypes and structure guided predictions, in which

56:59.500 --> 57:05.020
this case SHCO-1-4 contains the SHCO-1-4 strain can now...

57:05.020 --> 57:19.620
So this is the strain that he supposedly engineered to be lethal in mice.

57:19.620 --> 57:21.180
This is the lethal mouse strain.

57:21.180 --> 57:30.860
I think there's a paper about him doing this in B-L-B, bulb in a B-A-L-B mice and this

57:30.860 --> 57:32.940
is the strain here.

57:32.940 --> 57:43.660
And I believe that after that they took this and they...

57:43.660 --> 57:47.300
Yeah I can't remember anymore but this is definitely one of those that they played around

57:47.300 --> 57:51.780
with, that they got the idea, they got the spike from Wuhan and then they put it.

57:51.780 --> 57:53.140
They only had the spike.

57:53.140 --> 58:00.020
See is the chimeric virus recombinant virus and remember that a lot of these are incomplete

58:00.020 --> 58:01.020
sequences.

58:01.020 --> 58:03.860
So here's where it becomes very interesting.

58:03.860 --> 58:09.500
Let me just give you this little tidbit to think about.

58:09.500 --> 58:13.740
And we're just going to keep doing our work, we're not paying attention to these other

58:13.740 --> 58:22.060
clown cars behind us, we're in the cave all by ourselves here, because we're caverns

58:22.060 --> 58:24.500
ahead of these people.

58:24.500 --> 58:29.060
If you realize that when they sequence a virus in cell culture, they sequence a virus

58:29.060 --> 58:36.500
from a bronchial lavage that they get amplicons that sort like this hundreds and hundreds

58:36.500 --> 58:43.940
of them that are short amplicons over the 30,000 foot genome, 30,000 nucleotide genome.

58:43.940 --> 58:44.940
And so they never...

58:44.940 --> 58:47.340
They don't get full reads by any stretch of the imagination.

58:47.340 --> 58:51.220
When you're doing Sanger sequencing it could be between 300 and 1,000, maybe Kevin can

58:51.220 --> 58:54.140
correct me but it's not thousands.

58:54.140 --> 58:58.900
And indeed they need overlap on these amplicons so that they get multiple reads.

58:58.900 --> 59:04.900
And so these are amplified by PCR and the reason why they get more copies of some than

59:04.900 --> 59:09.620
the other ones is because these are more abundant and therefore they start amplifying earlier.

59:09.620 --> 59:14.700
That's the assumption that these people make and I don't think it's a terrible assumption.

59:14.700 --> 59:20.260
But then when they get a partial sequence, now this is the trick, if they get a partial

59:20.260 --> 59:30.540
sequence in the wild, the normal hot signal that you see here has just cut off at some

59:30.540 --> 59:35.580
arbitrary number where they don't have any coverage at these places.

59:35.580 --> 59:41.740
And so where you don't have coverage like here and from here to here and from here to

59:41.740 --> 59:45.100
here, then you're just missing those genomes.

59:45.100 --> 59:47.660
You're just missing that part of the genome.

59:47.660 --> 59:57.700
And with respect to the paper that he's talking about with this SHCO14S, he is assuming that

59:57.700 --> 01:00:06.540
because he has found in the wild a new coronavirus spike protein sequence, that that means that

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.860
the entire coronavirus is a new one.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:15.420
It doesn't mean that it's part of a swarm, some of which have this spike protein.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:21.740
But he's assuming is that it's a whole new instance of this signal.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:27.220
And that's where they get all of these, these family trees and phylogenies from is that

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:35.140
every time they find a new unique RNA signal for any of these 31 genes, it is very easy

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.060
for them to say, wow, we found a new one.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.580
And assume again that just because it's so hard to find these, so hard to find these

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:48.140
signals very robustly in nature and it's very hard to culture them because often time

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.660
you only get a sample right here.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:56.220
You don't get any of these full genomes, they're rare.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.860
And so you can see what would happen if you started by transfecting or by losing or by

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:08.900
creating your virus stock from a genomic RNA that was pure.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:18.300
Because then all of the clouds of incomplete genomes and subgenomic RNAs will start from

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.060
a common ancestor.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:26.860
That's a very different scenario than a viral swarm that you would get from mother nature

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.580
and a very much more infectious one.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:36.100
You can even imagine where it would decay exponentially from the first clone in clone

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:42.420
transfection to maybe even a couple family members as that person shed self replicating

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:47.180
full transcript RNAs.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.020
But the point to remember here is that when what they're talking about with regard to

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:57.420
this paper is a sequence that the Wuhan lab found that was actually just a partial sequence

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.780
that they found in the wild and they guessed that it looks like it's related, it looks

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.380
like it's a SARS virus.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:10.300
And so with his technology, they were able to resurrect a laboratory version of it using

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.580
a consensus coronavirus genome plus that spike.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:19.460
And that's where they got crazy with it.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:26.900
And that's where everybody went bananas in that 2015 paper.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.900
So here we go.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.660
They replicate efficiently in cells expressing the human ACE2 receptor.

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.820
These data clearly indicate that pseudotypes and structure guided predictions in which

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:44.820
this case, SHCl1.4 contains no conserved residues at the interface with any other known strain

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.500
would have actually predicted the potential threat.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.420
It was actually a chimeric gain-of-function virus that did.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:57.700
And the SHCl1.4 and the WIV viruses grow equivalently to SARS and human airway epithelial cells.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.300
So there's no real gain of function in that phenotype.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.660
Next slide.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:07.220
If you look at virulence, these two bat SARS-like coronaviruses are attenuated.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.460
So you lose function.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:15.900
Vaccines, especially in the age models, do not protect against infection with these viruses.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.620
And there are four broadly cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that have been

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.980
identified that neutralize all SARS and CIVIT strains.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:27.620
And none of them actually work against the SHCl1.4 virus.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:35.500
So what I hear here, and I hope you hear it here, is that he's making the argument that

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.340
some of these viruses have no solution.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:46.020
And a live attenuated virus vaccine does not protect the animals.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:53.340
And a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, like he described in 2007, very clear competitor

01:03:53.340 --> 01:04:02.340
intellectually, if you will, for the Z map product that was in Plumber's lab in Canada

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.740
with that Chinese lady whose name I can't remember, but I'm sure Mark Koolack knows

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.700
right off the top of his head.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.100
The point being here now, again, we're discussing the worst case scenario without actually saying

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.100
it out loud.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.220
Because, again, we have something that vaccines won't work for, and a monoclonal antibody

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.820
cocktail won't work for.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:20.820
And it's lethal.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.860
So human monoclonal antibodies that exist on a shelf will fail.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.860
We have no information on the transmissibility of these isolates.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.500
Next slide.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.380
So if you look at this phylogenetic tree, they fall into two clusters, that cluster with

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:40.100
high risk strains, some of which, WIV1 and SHCl1.4, which actually are representative of about

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.180
12 to 15 viruses, different viruses each.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.100
Yes, that lady, Jeff.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.980
There are no vaccines at therapeutics that will really work well against them, and so we're vulnerable.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.980
And I also want to mention that many of the chimeric viruses here, the definition implied

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:58.220
in gain of function, is much too broad and must be redefined.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.260
Next slide.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.780
There are some public health implications to this research.

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.980
On equivalently, it establishes that there are SARS-like viruses that are pre-positioned

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:15.300
to jump and use human receptors and normal targets for infection, and so they have pre-pandemic

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.300
potential.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.900
The results are generalizable to other coronaviruses and other zoonotic viruses, and there's a

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:25.260
platform framework that you can use to tease those associations apart.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:30.380
And you can inform policymakers in terms of SARS-like outbreaks are possible and likely

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.940
in the future, and that existing therapeutics and vaccines most likely will fail, and so

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:36.940
we're unprepared.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:41.620
And advantage is that we have reagents now to derive effective interventions.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.860
Next slide.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:47.260
The second part I want to mention is the importance of animal model development in

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.020
vaccine design.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.580
SARS replicates very poorly in mice.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:56.340
There's no weight loss or clinical disease and very little pathology.

01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:00.260
This is because the virus poorly engages the mouse ACE2 receptor.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.540
It doesn't use it very well.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.860
Every vaccine that I know of that's been tested in this replication model works.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.140
And then Kanta and her group at NIH developed some mouse-adapted strains, which have six

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.100
to ten mutations that enhance the usage of the mouse ACE2 receptor.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.020
Next slide.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.980
This results in models that capture most of the human disease phenotypes, which are shown

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.300
in yellow.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:30.900
And so I can't stress how it important it is to see what they are doing here is by establishing

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:41.020
animal models, then they are going directly against that old adage that Robert Malone

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:46.620
introduced us to or reminded us of way back when, which is mice lie, monkeys deceive

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.380
and the only way to know the truth is humans.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:59.500
And in this scenario, what we are doing is setting ourselves up for a disaster by funding

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.780
grant calls or rather writing grant calls and funding research proposals that look for

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.220
development of animal models of disease.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:15.740
Animal models of disease being wholly inappropriate for studying viral replication, viral disease

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.100
in humans.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:24.060
Because of the way that they do it, they use clones, they start with pure stocks and they

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.940
apply it in crazy ways.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.660
Like really high concentrations in the nose or even worse, they inject it in the brain

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:39.140
or somewhere in the heart muscle or in the interperitoneal cavity.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:45.020
And so these animal models are part of the voodoo part of the enchantment that has been

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:55.820
cast on academia because he just said it in the previous slide that that unequivocally

01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:02.580
established that some natural SARS-like coronavirus strains are pre-pandemic potential.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.140
Unequivocally established.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:10.980
Now how is that any different than what I was saying right here with this early, but

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:17.620
I want is that we're seeding the gain of function narrative with scientific programs

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:24.540
in peer reviewed publications for years before the pandemic that what unequivocally, unequivocally

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:31.540
established that some natural SARS-like coronavirus bad strains represent pre-pandemic potential.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:35.900
It's done, case closed.

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.620
And now we need this warm base of manufacturing forever.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.620
Now we need to fund these programs forever.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.580
Now you can't argue anymore.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:47.860
You see what his job was?

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:51.460
That's why they're throwing him under the bus now because that's what his job was.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:57.740
His job was established the worst case scenario and do your own thing alongside.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:01.460
And so he argued for what he thought was the legitimate best way.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:07.380
Had live attenuated viruses working on molecular solutions to de attenuation.

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:11.340
These are all laudable pursuits.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.300
This is not the Scooby-Doo villain that we're looking for.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300
Was he involved?

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.860
Does he know who they are?

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:22.660
I'm with almost without a doubt, he does.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:30.660
But the relentless focus on this man by people on social media, by people on the intellectual

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:38.180
dark web, by people writing books is a mistake.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:44.900
It's a mistake because he's not JS Bach of coronaviruses because he used restriction

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.900
enzymes to build a long DNA molecule.

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.540
I mean, building a long DNA molecule with restriction enzymes was something that had

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.860
already been done.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:00.820
Maybe not as long as a coronavirus genome, maybe.

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:06.980
But it's not some kind of, you know, it's like adding a trailer to a semi-truck, you

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:10.340
know, hey, you know what, you could hook up another trailer to the back of that.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340
Really?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.340
I never thought about that.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.340
Holy cow.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340
Does it work?

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.420
You can hook another one up.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.420
Oh, wow.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.940
They call that a train.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:28.180
And so for this guy to be held up as some, you know, virtuoso, because he came up with

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:38.660
the idea of using restriction enzymes to make a long DNA molecule, it's just ridiculous.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.380
But that's what they want, right?

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.380
That's where we are.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:42.380
That's what they want.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.380
Rob's capyptor.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.580
It doesn't use it very well.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.900
Every vaccine that I know of that's been tested in this replication model works.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:54.180
And then Kanta and her group at NIH developed some mouse-adapted strains, which have six

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.220
to ten mutations that enhance the usage of the mouse ACE2 receptor.

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.220
Next slide.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:05.940
This results in models that capture most of the human disease phenotypes, which are shown

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.940
in yellow.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.940
And a continual theme from these studies in terms of vaccines is that the Envivo core

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.940
list of protection vary depending on the model.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940
Next slide.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.940
Corillis of protection.

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.460
The immediate vaccine was developed, purchased by NIH early in the epidemic.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.660
It protected mice and primates in a replication model.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.100
So what happens, although they did notice low levels of eosinophils in the animals, what

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.140
happens after the lethal challenge strain is used?

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.180
The vaccine fails to protect in the elderly, and it induces a TH2 immune pathology with

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.620
a large number of eosinophils shown here by the column sort of in the middle, with all

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.860
the blue cells surrounding the airways and the vesicles.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.420
And you can see that the number of eosinophils increased tenfold as a consequence of challenge.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.420
This is not a good thing.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.420
But it is an inbred model.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.420
What about outbred models?

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.420
Next slide.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.980
So that's very similar to the paper that we looked at on the bike, actually, already

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:56.500
in 2020, where they inoculated macaque monkeys and then exposed them to the virus, and they

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.900
had a much more severe reaction to the virus, destroyed their lungs.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.780
This is exactly what he's describing here.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:09.020
It's very difficult to vaccinate against a coronavirus because inevitably what you've

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:16.380
done is screw up the memory to the coronavirus and make your immune system prone to overreact

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.780
to what it actually tries to ignore.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.140
It's actually pretty spectacular.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:26.140
So we use the collaborative cross mouse resource, which encodes the three substrains of mice.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:30.460
We took the eight founder lines and made 64 F1 dialyol combinations.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.460
We aged them for a year, vaccinated half of them, and then challenged the virus.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.660
This is about 2,400 mice total in this experiment.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.660
Next slide.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.260
When you look at the results in yellow, it means that the vaccine protected from lethal

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.260
infection.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.860
Green is the vaccine protected either from lethal infection or pathology or disease.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.700
Black means that the vaccine really had little impact, and red means that the vaccine resulted

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.460
in increased immune pathology and mortality in the animals.

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:55.020
So in this case, in an outbred population, the prediction would be that that vaccine would

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.860
have caused increased mortality in some individuals.

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.940
This is seen with other vaccine formulations for SARS, this TH2 immune pathology.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:07.140
It demonstrates quite clearly the importance of animal model development in evaluating

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.420
vaccine and drug performance.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420
Last slide.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.420
Now in that sense, I agree with them.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:18.700
If the mice can already uncover massive failure of the vaccine product, then that's great.

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.980
But if they would have survived, it wouldn't necessarily prove that it's going to work

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.380
in humans.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.900
The pathology could have still developed in humans, or it could have been less obvious

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.700
in the mice, et cetera.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.500
Remember, these mouse studies are always going to be ended early because they need to sacrifice

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.420
the mouse in order to look at the tissue that they show those pictures of.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:45.100
So if the mouse model at six weeks would have shown no problems after re-infection or challenge,

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.820
that wouldn't necessarily have proved definitively there wasn't going to be autoimmunity in the

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820
future.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.700
So that's another key thing to keep in mind.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.940
But where are we with MERS?

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:57.220
MERS was not replicated mice or in any small animals, and vivo passage has failed in multiple

01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.220
laboratories.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.100
We'll talk about the reason for that tomorrow.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.100
Transgenic mice have been developed, expressing the human DPP4 receptor.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.980
This results in a replication model without serious disease.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.300
Passage of virus has been done in two laboratories, both of which, to our surprise, was halted

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.260
in the midst of an ongoing epidemic.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.540
And so in our opinion, the public health vaccine development has been compromised by this decision.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.180
Without a robust small animal models, the testings of vaccines and drugs have been delayed

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.180
and there's a backlog.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.820
So I think it's critical that MERS coronavirus restrictions be lifted immediately, at least

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.380
in terms of animal model development.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.380
Last slide.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.340
So I'd just like to summarize where in dangerous times, there's four highly pathogenic viruses

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.940
sort of sampling the human population.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.420
International travel allows for instantaneous, almost worldwide dissemination, and it's only

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.420
going to get faster.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:36.860
And the response times, which are so critical for treating human disease, are being compressed.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.140
And being a function represents one of those approaches that is a crucial tool for public

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.740
health preparedness and response.

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:50.940
So that's an interesting place for Ralph Baric to be when, again, and I think this is really

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.460
important to see, where is it here?

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.460
Is it here?

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.460
Come on now.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.460
What the heck?

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.460
I had it all queued up now.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.460
I don't see it tonight.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460
Oh, yeah, here.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.460
Sorry, got it.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.460
Got it.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460
Got it.

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.460
Let's just watch this one really quick.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.460
Okay.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:15.100
And then I'm only going to watch the beginning and then I'm going to hang out because I got

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.220
to go to my son's basketball game.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.220
Check this out.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.620
Thank you, Andy.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.260
Just listen to the beginning of this because the beginning is hysterical.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.260
That was really nice.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.660
As an now person, I really admire at the school.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:28.660
Ralph Baric.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.260
He's the most accomplished and prolific scientist anywhere and he's really brought tremendous

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.260
creativity, persistence, and innovation to the study of viruses.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.820
I've had the opportunity to tour his lab.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:47.060
So we watched the 2007 video yesterday and then we just watched the 2016 video and now

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.980
we're going to watch him talk two years later.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.980
Okay.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.980
And microbiology and immunology.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.980
Two years later.

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.980
No.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.980
The NIN.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.620
How bad could the next pandemic be?

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.620
What might it look like?

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.620
And will we be ready?

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:08.620
Well, I have to admit, I'm a little worried about giving this talk partially because as

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.460
Yogi Barris said, it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.540
So there's a good chance I could be wrong.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:19.100
I study coronaviruses, noroviruses, flaviviruses, and do some influenza virus research just to

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.940
give you some background of what I do.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:25.820
The other reason that I'm a little bit worried is being labeled as a harbinger of doom.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:26.820
This is not me.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.500
I'm not one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.060
So he's choosing to do this, right?

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:38.020
Or is he implying that someone else is making him give this talk from this perspective as

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:42.100
one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the plague?

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:48.100
It's a very curious talk to me because it is not a typical scientific talk.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:55.060
The typical lecture from a biologist has a 30,000 foot view directly over the target

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.500
and then you zoom in.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:04.780
You don't start from the, you know, wow, I mean, from worst case scenario.

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:10.180
Even if you think that Alzheimer's disease is really important or you think that autism

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:17.580
is a really devastating disease, you don't start with worst case scenario.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.260
And yet here he is, and it's extraordinary.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.980
And I want you to let you know that I'm really kind of a nice guy.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.340
So please come talk to me after this talk.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:30.820
I will mention that viruses are certainly in the pockets of all of the four horsemen and

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.340
they can be used in all of these scenarios.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:36.820
So I'd like to start off by taking a step back and talk about how infectious diseases

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:41.900
ranks or stacks up against other natural disasters that in terms of frequency and relative risk.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.140
So if you step back and every three to 400 million years or so, there's a danger of

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.660
a gamma radiation burst.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.340
These occur when black holes and neutron stars collide.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.980
It shoots out this burst of gamma radiation which can strip away the ozone layer.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.660
It's acid rain, resulting high UV radiation levels to plant an animal life on the planet

01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.180
and will result in global warming.

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.420
And this can occur as far as 6,500 light years away.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.980
Fortunately, it doesn't happen so often.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.100
So I'm not, don't really lose sleep about this at night.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:11.500
A little bit more likely to cause an issue as an asteroid strike.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:15.340
The earth runs into about 3,700 to about 7,800 tons of debris.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.140
As it flows through space, occasionally some of these are big rocks.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:21.940
When a really big rock hits the planet, this can result in an extinction level event like

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.220
what happened to the dinosaurs.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.820
The good news is that mammals became dominant and so we are here today.

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:29.980
Otherwise we'd probably be lunch.

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:33.700
The U.S. takes this threat fairly seriously so NASA has a near earth object program that

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.980
tracks satellites that are large enough to cause damage to the planet.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.540
One problem that they face is they can only track them for about 100 years and the accuracy

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.540
falls off.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:43.180
But fortunately Bruce Willis, our mom, get it in here.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.380
I just want to point out that he is also a Pensberg boy.

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.380
We actually went to school together.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.340
It's a little town in New Jersey, 3,500 of us.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.460
A clear epicenter of planetary defense, so remember that, please.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.660
Anyway, moving up on the list, we have supervolcanoes.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.660
I do like Bruce Willis.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.220
We went there about every million years.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.540
We watched Die Harder the other day with my boys.

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.700
That was pretty funny.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.620
These are volcanoes that are large enough to co-continent with about a half an inch of

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.300
ash or more.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:10.060
Supervolcanoes, which was in Indonesia, resulted in ice age and knocked the...

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.780
And look at that, that's Yellowstone right there.

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.660
About 20 of these of concern on the planet, and this is ours, this is Yellowstone, obviously.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:19.020
Please go to the caldera and spend some time at that hotel.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.020
It's quite a treat.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:23.180
Finally, we have Carrington-level events, which probably some of you may have heard

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.180
of.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.180
Most people, not these are geomagnetic storms.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:31.420
When solar flares throw off a lot of coronal mass, they can hit our electromagnetic waves

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.700
that are around the earth and this can result in magnetic storms.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.460
The biggest one occurred in 1859.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.980
It wasn't much electronics at the time, but it caused fires and telegraph offices.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:42.700
It shocked our electrocuted telegraph workers.

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:46.580
Much smaller ones occurred in the 60s and 70s at knockout power grids in the U.S. and

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.580
Canada.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.100
Lloyd's of London says that they can cause about $23 million in damage and potentially

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.620
knock out the power grid for one to five years.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:54.260
So this is not insignificant.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.460
And what's a little bit scary is that much larger flares are possible.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.020
So NASA has taken this pretty seriously, and if the first solar probe is going to go around

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.700
the sun, it's going to be launched in the summer, and they are going to take a look

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.700
at this.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.620
But this can certainly knock out GPS, cell phone, internet, and power grid for several years.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.300
Okay, so now we're back into infectious diseases.

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.300
Here we are.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.300
From my perspective, though, since I've been on the planet, there's been an epidemic

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.580
virus every decade starting with Asian flu in 1960.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.900
So do you see Asian flu?

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.900
And then...

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.300
In Hong Kong in 1967 or 1968, H1N1 came back in the 70s, followed by HIV, followed by

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.540
West Nile, and then we got to the 21st century.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.540
And thanks, Spada.

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.260
SARS was the first epidemic virus of the 20...

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:40.700
Now here he doesn't actually mention the Spanish flu, but he did mention it in the talk

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.860
from 2007, and said how many people had killed.

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:50.780
So here we again are starting with this idea of worst case scenario, we're starting with

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:56.220
the idea of pandemic potential, but extraordinarily, he is doing something that I think a lot of

01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.220
these gain-of-function people have done, especially since the start of the pandemic,

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:06.940
and start to make equivalences with very, very planet-wide devastating events, rather

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:12.940
than bring it down to a nuclear weapon, or bring it down to a few thousand people, we

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:20.740
have to bring it up into orders of magnitude more impactual, like a meteor, or a Carrington

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:27.260
event that would knock out the entire power grid of the Northern Hemisphere for five years.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:33.940
And so I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to see that this slide, describing

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:38.140
what we are witnessing here, is so real.

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.740
They definitely seeded the gain-of-function narrative with scientific programs.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:46.660
They knew what they were doing, and they co-opted people like Ralph Baric with lots and lots

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:53.380
of funding to do whatever the heck he wanted with translation regulatory sequences and trying

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:57.460
to make attenuated viruses that couldn't de-attenduate.

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:03.260
They let him do everything he wanted with that, as long as they also got the stitching

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.260
thing to go.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:11.660
Got synthetic viruses and coronaviruses to go, and in fact, it's even possible that these

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:17.460
things are just, they're just testing self-replicating RNA on us and calling them coronaviruses and

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:21.820
normal viruses and flavoviruses and all this other stuff.

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:27.560
None of these have perhaps have a significant natural signature, but the signature that

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.620
we are told to pay attention to, the signature that they wave around all the time, could actually

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:43.020
be always generated from a laboratory-created manufactured clone RNA.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.020
That's the reality.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.900
It could be.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.060
The reality is not that it could be that there are millions of viruses out there in

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:55.260
the wild and that there are pandemics happening and avoided all the time.

01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.780
That's at least the idea that we are using clones all the time and making clones and

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.660
that that's the only danger is at least as equally likely as the opposite.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:10.100
This worst-case scenario narrative, which I'm sure in my heart of hearts, it really feels

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.900
like it doesn't have a firm foundation in biology.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:21.460
Again, you can find the entire gain of function symposium on usatonicits.com's website under

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.500
the gain of function symposium 2016.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:29.380
All of those are also hosted on a YouTube channel, and then the individual video that

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:34.660
we watched is also right there.

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660
So we have been...

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.860
What I want is time morbidity.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.100
I want people to complain.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.300
By these people.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.020
And I think it is the best.

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:48.500
It's really fabulous that Sacha Latopova has found James Giordano and realizes how pivotal

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.500
this lecture is.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:54.780
I'm so happy that she's also trying to call out Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to make sure that

01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:00.540
we try to keep pushing him forward, to keep retrospectively looking at the pandemic

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:07.020
for evidence from other fields and evidence from other data sets to prove or disprove

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.340
the spread of a risk-additive pathogen in 2020.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:15.860
And I think we can get him over the edge to understand that infectious RNA clones is

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:20.380
the only real threat in modern RNA virology.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:26.180
And again, that's because infectious material is very hard to come by by any other means.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:32.980
And we have been bamboozled by a spectacular commitment to this lie.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.580
Some people have been coerced, some people have been wittingly and unwittingly...

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:38.620
Oh yeah, I wanted to show you that.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.300
I mean, isn't that crazy?

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:47.820
Have you ever heard this language before, anywhere else, besides...

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.820
Let me see if it's here.

01:24:48.820 --> 01:25:07.100
Did I copy it or did I wittingly or unwittingly?

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.420
Here it is right here at the top.

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:15.060
All pandemics to date have been faked by the military industrial globalist cabal with numerous

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:20.260
witting and unwitting participants.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.660
I mean, I'm not...

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.740
I don't care.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.860
I really don't.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:31.060
But I'm just wondering if anybody else that's watching the show right now sees any striking

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:37.700
resemblance to the message that I've been sending for the last year, year and a half or so.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.340
Four ways to fake the...

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:45.420
Easy ways to fake the pandemic, Spanish-fluous fake, John Beaudoin's good, Meryl Nasse and

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:50.740
Lab Leaks, then witting and unwitting participants.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.780
RFK doesn't have it quite right yet.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.100
I actually have that in his book.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.380
And then also James Giordano.

01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.460
It's really interesting to me.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.180
But witting and unwitting participants is...

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.060
I guess it's a pretty common phrase in English.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.220
I guess that's possible.

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.220
I don't know.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:11.660
Anyway, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:17.420
It's been a fun, fun, fun time and it is only just starting.

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:24.900
My 52nd year, the entire year is probably going to be spent trying to make sure that

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.140
your kids and mine do not get on this train.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:34.380
The your kids and mine learned the truth that Alex Berenson said live on Joe Rogan that,

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:39.540
you know, if you had to invest in one thing, it would be in sewage and in water treatment

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.820
in sanitation because that's where we got the most gains.

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.260
He's not going to go so far as to say that we didn't need vaccines, that we wouldn't

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.340
have needed vaccines to have that huge reduction in polio and measles and other transmissible

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:58.540
disease when we got nutrition up and we got water treatment up and we got sewage treatment

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.620
up and we got water purity up.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:05.700
Hello.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:12.940
And they definitely don't want us to understand the extent of the coronavirus illusion.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:19.260
How little fidelity that they really have, how over exaggerated this signal has been

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.860
and how unmonitored it was before the pandemic.

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.980
So we can free our college kids.

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:29.380
We can free our children and prevent our grandchildren from ever getting on this train in the first

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.380
place.

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.460
We have to teach our children the way out.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:37.340
We have to teach them the biology that will free them to make sure that this lie never

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.700
becomes the truth.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:42.900
They must learn the biology because then it can't happen.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:46.180
And that biology describes this as a Scooby-Doo.

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:51.380
We were fooled into believing that something leaked in 2009 by all the lies and the redacted

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.460
emails and the arguing in front of the Senate.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.220
And for five years, we've been fooled by this illusion of consensus that people think

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.420
that this is the right question to ask, that it's either a lab leak or a natural virus

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.300
and getting mad about it and this faith that there was a virus, this faith that millions

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.820
of people died, this is the danger, this is the mythology.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:13.980
We cannot pass on to our children or they will be lost forever and more importantly,

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.580
our grandchildren will be.

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.340
This faith is a lie.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.940
It was a background.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.260
It was an amplified noise.

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:24.020
It was a signal that was planted there.

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:31.540
It was not a natural occurrence.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:37.060
It was not a natural occurrence, like the spilling of a signal in one place and spreading from

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.060
a point.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.020
That's not how it happened.

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.420
And yet that's what we are told.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.860
That's what every one of these people believes.

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:50.060
That's what every one of these people is defending, including Kevin McKernan.

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:55.980
Because the clone chemtrail hypothesis is, it's chemtrail retarded.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:01.980
The biology is the way out cause first call for a stop to the childhood vaccine schedule

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:07.620
in America by simply advocating for it to be compared to other Western countries and

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:14.220
acknowledge that it's too early and too many and therefore it has to be criminal advocate

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:18.820
for strict liability for these products because that's the way that we fix this problem.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.380
Investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:28.820
That's Jessica Hockett, that's Jonathan Engler, that's Martin Neil.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:32.340
Investigate the use of mass casualty events and transfection to create the illusion of

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.180
a pandemic.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:39.500
And that we can talk to Pierre Corey and Nurse Aaron and all these other people that were

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:44.740
supposedly there during the worst time but actually weren't and we're not really sure

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.340
what they were doing.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.780
So we need to claim sovereignty over our children's bodies again, we need to get out

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:54.620
of the who, we need to get out of the UN, we need to close our CDC.

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:57.420
And you can see these people because they won't say these things.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.140
Pierre Corey said that all childhood vaccinations were bad at some point on Jimmy Dorr.

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:05.620
So I think we should watch that video to see what else he says.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:07.540
But they won't advocate for strict liability.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:14.380
You won't hear any of these lawyers at ICANN like, like Siri say, we should just advocate

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.460
for strict liability.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:20.660
You won't hear Siri say that we should go against this from the Seventh Amendment perspective

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.540
and try to get it struck in federal court.

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.940
You won't hear them say that because it's maybe not the right time or something.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:27.740
I don't know.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:30.220
You're not going to hear them talk about the deadly protocols.

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.060
They're always going to now going forward.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.420
They're always going to focus on the vaccine.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.100
And that's what you saw when they co-opted Denis Rancourt's data.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:41.340
They exclusively focused on the 17 million number.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:46.100
Now you have people calling out Brett Weinstein is saying that 17 million number, the 17

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.620
million number is dumb.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:50.500
And you have Brett Weinstein say, well, I didn't say 17 million.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.380
I was just quoting somebody else.

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:58.380
And all the while everybody ignores the John Beaudoin and Denis Rancourt and Jessica Hockett

01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:03.620
and Jonathan Engler all have data from all around the world that shows there was no spreading

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.620
pathogen.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:10.820
They don't use the word clone because it's going to reveal the fact that RNA virology

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:17.820
in and of itself is foundationally dependent on this methodology and therefore is overextended

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.900
is exaggerated and likely most are all of the objections laid out by Stefan Lanka and the

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:28.220
Bailey's and all these people are likely true.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:32.100
And so you're damn right I was taken.

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.900
And so as I admit this, they make fun of it as I admit this people are coming on.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.820
Well, why didn't you just vaccinate your kids?

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.820
Yeah, I did.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:39.820
I admitted it.

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.900
I lied about it and I'll do it again.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.180
Cry about it, that is.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.540
It's these other people who say I just made honest mistakes.

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:54.460
I don't have anything to apologize for just because I advocated for masks for two years,

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:58.340
just because I advocated for lockdown for two years, just because I said it was a gain

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.700
a function virus for two years.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:04.500
I don't have any obligation to learn virology for myself so that I don't make a mistake

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:08.620
to my hundreds of thousands of viewers.

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.260
That's what these people think.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.580
That's not what we're doing here though.

01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:16.460
We're teaching this biology now and we're going to keep teaching it as we try to do study

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.540
halls to figure it out together.

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:23.060
We're going to try and summarize across the entire show and we're going to attack ideas

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.180
instead of people.

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:28.560
That's how we're going to get out of this because they are trying to reduce the population

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.140
and they are going to do it by just not letting our kids think it's a cool thing to

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:40.780
have have kids to show you commercials on YouTube about being a single woman with

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:48.140
no kids and how great it is or on rumble because they don't want us to have kids.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.380
They want the population to go down.

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:55.820
They really do but as it goes down, they also want you to surrender.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.620
They want our kids to surrender.

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:02.380
More importantly, more importantly, the way to say it is they want us to surrender our

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:07.900
children because they think that the artificial general intelligence is just right around

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.900
the corner.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.460
So they got to collect this data so that they can feed it and so that it can figure

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:13.660
out how the genome works.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:19.420
It can figure out all the irreducible complexity that we've never been able to penetrate.

01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:24.060
Ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:30.620
the control group by any means necessary intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.340
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:37.620
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:07.620
Thank you very much guys, thank you very much for joining me and thanks for the birthday

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:08.620
wishes.

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.620
I will have a good time.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.060
I'm going to watch this game.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:17.740
I coached already this morning early and came back and I did the stream and I got the eighth

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.260
graders, the eighth grade boy he plays but I'm not his coach.

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.740
If you would like to support the stream, please go to gigglehomebiological.com.

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:30.980
If you'd like to communicate with me there, you can find a telephone number, you can

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:38.340
also find an email, you can find me at gigglehome.bio which is kind of like a Twitter alternative.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:42.660
You can support Gigglehome there at the green, you can find this link at the watch and then

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:47.900
of course there's a schedule and then down at the bottom there's places to subscribe.

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:50.740
I can't thank everybody enough for jumping on board.

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:53.380
I will not let you down this year.

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.940
These subscribers are contributing to what I think is going to be the most important

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.740
or one of the most important independent news streams on the internet in the coming year

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:09.660
and I think Mark Housatonic.Live and myself and a few other people are starting

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:17.460
to form what is a loose, you know, intellectual bright web on the internet and I'm really

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.220
excited and I really have these people and more to thank for that.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:27.620
So thank you very much for joining me and if you have the means and the opportunity

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.740
I have a drink for me, please, 52 years old, see you tomorrow.
