00:32.356 --> 00:33.026
BEEP

01:26.281 --> 01:34.185
Tonight, MERS, SARS, bird flu, mutating superbugs are threatening to wipe out mankind.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.766
Do we think we rule the planet?

01:36.086 --> 01:36.246
No.

01:36.586 --> 01:37.347
They rule the planet.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.928
Their attack is always vicious.

01:40.128 --> 01:42.509
The majority of the exposed people will die.

01:42.909 --> 01:46.951
It could lead to a viral armageddon, a bio-pocalypse.

01:47.331 --> 01:53.414
If you've got the lab, if you've got the scientists necessary, effectively, you could come up with a zombie-type virus.

01:54.475 --> 01:54.635
Whoa.

01:55.563 --> 01:58.506
And it could be your next-door neighbor who starts it all.

01:58.526 --> 02:02.010
You need a table and a sink, and that's a laboratory.

02:02.390 --> 02:06.434
Once the biopocalypse strikes, we may not know what hit us.

02:06.635 --> 02:08.176
What the hell is that?

02:08.557 --> 02:09.998
Until it's too late.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.701
You're gonna have a huge death toll before you ever catch up with it.

02:37.954 --> 02:41.138
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:41.178 --> 02:42.659
This is GigaOM Biological.

02:44.281 --> 02:46.704
coming to you live every once in a while.

02:46.724 --> 02:49.167
I'm going to try and make it better and better.

02:49.187 --> 02:58.379
I don't want to apologize too much, but I am apologizing right now for not being here as often as I would like to be.

02:58.399 --> 02:59.801
We're going to fix that.

02:59.841 --> 03:00.962
Good morning, everyone.

03:01.883 --> 03:04.584
from Northern California and elsewhere.

03:04.644 --> 03:05.645
Good to see everyone.

03:05.665 --> 03:09.826
This is GigaOM Biological, part of the Independent Bright Web.

03:09.846 --> 03:16.770
You've got to get yourself and your family off of social media because social media is a national security theater.

03:18.270 --> 03:20.431
and you can't change the script there.

03:21.191 --> 03:25.792
And so interacting with those actors is not a way forward.

03:25.892 --> 03:30.113
In fact, that is the way to be forever trapped.

03:30.693 --> 03:32.133
And we don't want that for our kids.

03:32.693 --> 03:34.094
And let's start with the basics.

03:34.234 --> 03:40.055
Autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

03:40.535 --> 03:44.976
Virology is never questioned as a science and public health is never questioned as a reason.

03:46.277 --> 03:51.702
Pandemics and gain of function are also myths used to make sure that these things are not questioned.

03:52.462 --> 04:02.371
And the people that do not question them, but instead stand in opposition to them or promote them, are there with a script.

04:02.411 --> 04:04.733
And that's why they never seem to make any progress.

04:05.373 --> 04:10.397
That's why GigaOM Biological is making so much progress, because

04:11.278 --> 04:15.503
The only people that we can compare ourselves to haven't made progress in 20 years.

04:15.583 --> 04:21.389
Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't understand the trap, you're not gonna understand why the cheese is free.

04:21.409 --> 04:27.636
Um, Housatonic's latest streams, that's plural, have been absolutely spectacular.

04:28.577 --> 04:36.605
He also seems to understand that biology is the way out and the biology that they ignore is probably the biology that's most important.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.968
That's where you find the irreducible complexity.

04:40.028 --> 04:53.059
That's where you find the scientists and the mentors that have appreciated the irreducible complexity before we got to the stage where the Human Genome Project had ever been enacted or envisioned and its limitations realized.

04:54.240 --> 05:04.024
Yes, all of this stuff is about the truth with a small t. We're just trying to get to know the biology a little better in a way that makes a lot more sense.

05:05.004 --> 05:05.864
Thanks for being here.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.425
Thanks for being a part of this.

05:08.505 --> 05:12.127
Yes, definitely we need to get our children off of social media.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.907
I guess I'm going to transition over here.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.389
Good morning, everybody.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.331
Welcome to the show.

05:18.851 --> 05:25.300
I do think you have to explain to your children regularly why social media is so potentially dangerous.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.203
And it has nothing to do with the algorithms.

05:29.024 --> 05:34.672
In fact, I think we should stop using the word algorithm to describe anything because it is programming.

05:35.635 --> 05:46.306
whether it is machine learning that has programmed it, or whether it's humans that have programmed it, or a combination of both, we are not talking about something abstract.

05:46.326 --> 05:52.072
We're talking about something very understandable and very under their control.

05:53.041 --> 06:07.132
And anytime people evoke an algorithm or an AI, one of the things that you should immediately be listening for is what kinds of responsibilities are being denied the human characters in the story because of the AI?

06:07.673 --> 06:12.597
What kinds of inevitabilities are being attributed to the AI?

06:13.137 --> 06:16.920
These are the illusions that we cannot allow our children to fall under.

06:17.020 --> 06:21.985
We cannot allow these spells to be successfully cast on our children.

06:22.825 --> 06:24.546
and the main one is social media.

06:24.626 --> 06:43.433
It is remarkable to me at this point in the last few weeks where my message has really in my heart changed to being imperative to teaching my children how vulnerable the adult population is to social media.

06:43.553 --> 06:50.676
I don't even know if our children in high school and middle school are even that vulnerable

06:51.980 --> 07:07.609
to social media in the way that adults that have, you know, potentially grown up through their developmental, socially developmental time with a cell phone with social media on it.

07:07.669 --> 07:13.092
And I can say very comfortably that all throughout my PhD,

07:15.572 --> 07:29.561
My wife and I were still communicating with cell phones that were about this big and did not have social media on them and had to text with three letter, you know, you had to push a button sometimes three times to get the right letter to write the text.

07:30.642 --> 07:32.883
And these phones lasted for a couple of days.

07:32.943 --> 07:33.463
Yada yada.

07:33.543 --> 07:38.987
Everybody knows this story, but this transition didn't happen that long ago.

07:41.067 --> 07:50.729
And we're supposed to imagine that this, you know, progress and technology and whatever is something that we should be proud of and excited and it's made us forever, you know, more free.

07:50.789 --> 08:04.213
But in reality, I think especially younger people, they are under the impression that this progress is not dangerous or that this progress is not something that, you know,

08:05.140 --> 08:07.882
can be denied or it can possibly be bad.

08:07.982 --> 08:24.471
And in retrospect, for me, it's becoming more and more obvious that what has happened is kind of an overwhelming over a couple decades, an overwhelming of the adult population with this massive availability of information.

08:24.511 --> 08:31.675
And you don't, you, many people cannot remember, although I do know a significant number of my viewers are of my age or older,

08:33.035 --> 08:36.376
A lot of cat ladies out there, apparently, according to Sasha Latapova.

08:38.657 --> 08:47.280
I really think that this transition needs to be shared with the younger generation so that they can become more readily aware

08:48.460 --> 08:53.486
of the fact that it wasn't that long ago where people were growing up without any of this stuff.

08:53.546 --> 09:03.816
And as a result, their set of cognitive tools, their set of creative tools, their set of imaginative tools, and their set of social tools is incredibly different

09:04.537 --> 09:11.847
and had developed to an indifferent state than what potentially could be happening to the worst examples in our society right now.

09:12.408 --> 09:20.178
And the kind of mental stability that can only be generated by a collective group of people

09:21.620 --> 09:30.809
is not being generated by the imaginary group of people that some of our children are experiencing as this group of people around them as they grow up.

09:30.869 --> 09:35.714
And this is very, very dangerous and in a way that I don't think can be understated.

09:35.974 --> 09:37.035
And quite frankly,

09:37.956 --> 09:47.180
Although I do think it is very important for us to get going forward with the biology, it's never going to stop being my message.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.722
It's never going to stop being my message that we have to get off of social media.

09:52.742 --> 09:53.582
It has never become

09:54.840 --> 10:12.651
As a parent as it is to me now that this is damaged all of the adults around me all of the parents that I meet all of the You know people that I meet at the gym the people that I meet on the street the conversation inevitably comes to this kind of

10:13.752 --> 10:20.413
unwitting acceptance that social media represents something and that movements on social media represent something.

10:20.473 --> 10:26.895
And so there are communities on social media like the brown community and the black community and the gay community.

10:27.355 --> 10:39.457
And these communities on social media have come to represent ghosts in our mind that we have to respond to and take into account as we maneuver in our daily lives.

10:39.517 --> 10:42.098
And this absurdity must not

10:43.118 --> 10:45.880
must not be given to our children.

10:46.180 --> 10:54.964
We cannot allow them to kind of, you know, take our place in the chair and put on the goggles and start to fight the empire.

10:55.104 --> 10:55.684
We can't.

10:56.425 --> 11:04.749
We can't allow them to think that texting, you know, and Twittering and whatever with these people, whoever they are, has any meaning.

11:05.569 --> 11:07.830
or they will never create anything.

11:07.890 --> 11:13.192
And we will never have children that are planting trees under whose shade they will not shelter.

11:13.773 --> 11:24.257
We won't have the kind of long-term vision of what we want to build as a people if we don't start to see how manipulated we've been by social media.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.559
Social media is absolutely the worst thing on earth.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.720
And I say that bar none.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.781
Otherwise, Donald Trump would be no one.

11:35.683 --> 11:37.384
Kamala Harris would be no one.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.866
Joe Biden could have never been president.

11:40.467 --> 11:53.537
All of these things would not have been possible except we've all acquiesced to social media being some kind of window through which we can look and hope to see something that's valuably, you know, related to the truth.

11:53.597 --> 11:54.958
This is just absurdity.

11:55.798 --> 12:05.066
It would be the same as watching Dukes of Hazzard and hoping that the bad guys are going to get caught and then thinking that that has something to do with how safe you are when you go out on the street at night.

12:06.007 --> 12:08.149
It's just not connected to reality.

12:09.150 --> 12:10.551
Wow, that was a pretty good analogy.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.913
So you have to show your children the truth.

12:12.953 --> 12:16.996
You have to first accept it, learn it, see it yourself.

12:17.776 --> 12:23.501
And once you start to be able to see it yourself, you'll be able to show your children, protect your children from it.

12:23.561 --> 12:34.650
Maybe we can raise a group of children and generation of children in America that just reject social media and kind of have pity on us as old adults for having fallen for it.

12:35.717 --> 12:37.179
But realize that that's okay.

12:37.219 --> 12:38.861
It's something we can apologize for.

12:38.901 --> 12:49.152
It was a military level, a military scale operation that was aimed at the adult population of the Western world.

12:49.432 --> 12:50.193
Understand that.

12:51.775 --> 12:54.917
It was fifth generation warfare for a very, very long time.

12:55.377 --> 12:59.120
And I think that message should resonate with a lot of people.

12:59.701 --> 13:07.947
I think it can bring families back together, because nobody's got to apologize if we were undermined to that extent.

13:08.027 --> 13:09.889
Because remember, the left is not any

13:10.589 --> 13:18.657
any better off because they still seem to be under the spell that Donald Trump is somehow running things, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:18.677 --> 13:32.331
is single-handedly appointing people that are, you know, about to undermine everything that America stands for or something like that, and that, you know, hundreds of thousands of children could be dead in five years if we don't get rid of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:32.371 --> 13:32.692
right now.

13:32.752 --> 13:33.753
That's a real thing.

13:37.496 --> 13:39.959
Don't forget to download the PeerTube app.

13:40.079 --> 13:42.341
I'm going to switch over here to the other side.

13:42.401 --> 13:43.362
Just give me a second here.

13:44.564 --> 13:48.047
Don't forget to switch over to the PeerTube app.

13:48.127 --> 13:53.633
If you have any trouble with it, just send me or Vee an email and we'll try to respond.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.975
Some people have too old a phone, but really that's

13:56.596 --> 14:08.710
that's the very rare case and unfortunately that I don't have much for you but if you're already somebody that has like an iPhone I don't know what 6 SE or something like that I mean maybe even earlier it'll work

14:11.593 --> 14:15.217
And the PeerTube app is special because it doesn't require you to log in.

14:15.277 --> 14:17.420
So that'll be a little confusing, actually.

14:17.460 --> 14:25.369
When you download the app and you start using it, you'll be very confused by the fact that it seems to set up this weird account named Sepia the Cuttlefish.

14:26.109 --> 14:27.951
And it's you, but it's not you.

14:28.012 --> 14:29.673
And when you try to log in, there's no login.

14:31.255 --> 14:33.196
That's because there isn't any login.

14:33.216 --> 14:34.297
There's no algorithm.

14:34.357 --> 14:36.358
It's not really collecting any data.

14:36.418 --> 14:44.023
Yes, your IP address will be shared because it's some of the way that the video is shared, but there's no collecting of this.

14:44.323 --> 14:54.530
And so the only list you're on is the list of people that actually watches PeerTube, and watches my website, stream.gingholm.bio.

14:54.570 --> 14:57.672
So I'm sure that if you've already watched it, you're already on that list anyway.

14:57.712 --> 15:00.194
You came to my Twitch channel, you're already on that list anyway.

15:00.794 --> 15:03.255
The great thing about this is that it's on your phone.

15:03.756 --> 15:07.217
You just have to open the app and the latest video is there.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.919
It could be a clip cut by Jeff from Earth.

15:10.219 --> 15:14.841
It could be the video that Mark just did.

15:14.921 --> 15:16.482
Or it could be the stream that I did.

15:17.622 --> 15:19.583
And you can always load more videos.

15:19.623 --> 15:21.023
You can find the recent ones.

15:21.043 --> 15:24.284
You can find trending ones, which are usually the ones that are watched the most.

15:24.364 --> 15:30.266
And so there are ways to use what's there in that app to find exactly what you want.

15:30.486 --> 15:38.629
And more importantly, with no algorithms, you're not also gonna be offered Joe Rogan or offered, I don't know, a bunch of other crap.

15:38.649 --> 15:42.790
There's not gonna be any advertisements and it runs really well.

15:44.272 --> 15:46.616
On my phone and many many many others phones.

15:46.676 --> 15:49.762
It's a remarkably small app I don't know.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.186
I don't have any I just really like it.

15:52.206 --> 15:55.713
I'm very proud that it works It is September 9th

15:57.681 --> 16:02.646
2025 and it's been six years since this thing started.

16:02.706 --> 16:12.996
And so I always want to put everything in perspective and make sure that we keep this calendar in mind because it's the calendar that will allow you to see the long con and the long con

16:13.897 --> 16:16.998
Just to remind everybody, do I have this camera on?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.198
I don't think I have this camera on.

16:18.298 --> 16:31.362
The long con is the idea or the idea that there are people who are put in place with a scripted narrative and that scripted narrative is by definition, it doesn't progress.

16:31.462 --> 16:35.083
And if it does progress, it progresses on a scripted timeline.

16:36.423 --> 16:42.265
And that progression then allows all of the people that follow that narrative or its

16:43.914 --> 16:50.599
antithesis to be kind of funneled into the same cognitive place over many, many years.

16:50.679 --> 17:07.752
And what I'm arguing is, is that the COVID pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 thing was kind of the crescendo of a operation that whose foundation can be found, you know, almost 10 years earlier.

17:09.364 --> 17:23.790
in the recruitment of the identification of key sort of people that might be a part of a anti-vaccine, anti-public health skeptical movement.

17:24.250 --> 17:36.476
And the military operation represented by COVID-19 around the world understood very well because military operations are planned on different timescales.

17:37.136 --> 17:43.781
They're not going to tell you that on TV on a regular basis, that the military plans 10 years in advance or 20 years in advance.

17:44.342 --> 17:54.730
But of course they do, especially when it's a military of a country of 350 million people with a budget of $7 trillion or some nutshit stuff like that.

17:55.851 --> 18:02.236
We're talking about a military that has like 11 aircraft carriers, for goodness sakes, and 700 military bases.

18:03.109 --> 18:05.552
They are planning on longer timescales.

18:05.632 --> 18:20.189
And so before the pandemic ever happened, any possible civilian, independent, cognitive opposition

18:21.448 --> 18:26.671
to the story that was going to be rolled out, had to be controlled.

18:26.811 --> 18:30.533
And make no mistake about it, I still believe it wholeheartedly.

18:30.553 --> 18:42.080
This is about the Human Genome Project, and it is about allowing or making transfection and transformation of people a normal thing.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.242
Because the only way we can hope

18:47.915 --> 18:52.137
To learn anything about people is to make people the experimental animal.

18:53.017 --> 18:58.800
And so you, if you are on the Donald Trump team and on the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:58.840 --> 19:08.424
team, you might think that the truth about the COVID-19 shot is getting out and that the truth about turbo cancers is getting out, but you would be mistaken.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.366
What's actually happening is the trap around you is closing.

19:16.440 --> 19:28.511
You think that Donald Trump isn't involved in the elite pedophile scam that runs most of the planet, that controls Bill Gates, you know, that controls all these people that have been to the island.

19:29.712 --> 19:40.902
You're kind of vaguely aware that it's about the grandchildren of Earth, but you think that it's about saving the grandchildren of Earth, I don't know, from the AI that's about to become generally awake and decide that humans are useless.

19:41.789 --> 19:48.374
You also might think the gain of function is real, and that this was definitely a lab leak, and that's why Fauci needs to be in jail.

19:49.014 --> 19:49.815
But you'd be wrong.

19:50.995 --> 20:02.103
Just like if you think this came from Mother Nature, and that it's not Fauci's fault, and that humans are actually a plague, there's too many of us anyway, you know, like maybe, I don't know, Jane Goodall thinks.

20:03.164 --> 20:05.685
She also thinks this is about the grandchildren of Earth.

20:05.765 --> 20:09.428
It'd just be a lot better if there were only a half a million grandchildren on Earth.

20:11.331 --> 20:18.137
So humans are the culmination with everything wrong with the world, at least materialistic humans like are found in America.

20:18.578 --> 20:26.365
And since Trump is an elite pedophile, who's now trying to actively deny and cover it up, COVID was real and vaccines work.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.806
And so Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:27.846 --> 20:30.188
is a nutcase that's about to kill a lot of kids.

20:31.889 --> 20:36.714
It's a pretty bad place that America and the West has been taken to all under the pretense

20:38.767 --> 20:47.291
that we should accept transfection as having worked, as having saved millions of people from a natural phenomenon that's undeniably going to come in the future again.

20:47.311 --> 21:08.182
And that, you know, for the most part, vulnerability to a virus or vulnerability to maybe a vaccine excipient or maybe vulnerability to a vaccine adjuvant or vulnerability to any other form of disease is always going to be ultimately genetic because evolution occurred because there's DNA.

21:09.807 --> 21:16.912
That's the whole basis of the biology that is sort of the blinders in front of our eyes.

21:17.392 --> 21:22.996
But the other blinders in front of our eyes are the actors on stage that cannot be denied.

21:23.036 --> 21:25.998
And that's one of the things that I'm probably going to end up

21:27.318 --> 21:28.879
Yeah, losing my voice over.

21:28.979 --> 21:35.005
And so again, it's murder and lies, it's manslaughter and lies, because it is for all the marbles.

21:35.105 --> 21:41.390
It's for the brains of our grandchildren, the minds of our grandchildren, the ideas in their heads.

21:41.670 --> 21:46.775
They want to replace the idea of sovereignty, the responsibility of sovereignty.

21:47.435 --> 21:49.156
the independence of sovereignty.

21:49.176 --> 22:05.505
They want to replace that with some kind of, you know, you owe it to the rest of the people and to your, you know, the ancestors to come to be an experimental animal so that we can take control of the evolution of the species and not leave that to chance anymore.

22:07.895 --> 22:22.718
That's what this ultimately this trap is all about is trying to convince us on both sides to kind of accept that responsibility that we need to come together as a species and accept the fact that maybe not everybody should be making kids.

22:23.238 --> 22:25.959
Maybe we should edit the genome.

22:26.019 --> 22:28.759
Maybe we should try to learn how to edit the genome.

22:29.219 --> 22:31.960
That's why Israel and Gaza are so ridiculous.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.780
That's why we have Elon Musk.

22:34.460 --> 22:37.041
That's why we have Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel.

22:38.812 --> 22:41.654
All of these people, Alex Jones, right?

22:43.135 --> 22:46.238
I mean, all of these people are ridiculous.

22:52.542 --> 22:58.727
I mean, think about Mark Zuckerberg and what things he's not said on camera that are amazing.

22:59.608 --> 23:03.551
I'm sure you've seen the video with Mark Zuckerberg talking about grilling meat.

23:05.607 --> 23:11.472
I can't find any videos about Elon Musk featuring Elon Musk where he says anything profound.

23:11.913 --> 23:15.576
I can't find any videos where Jeff Bezos says anything profound.

23:19.028 --> 23:27.891
And the reason why is because these people are just scripted actors that are in front of us that also the other scripted actors are scripted to argue about.

23:28.651 --> 23:35.633
You know, like those people on The View or the people on all the podcasts that have any more than 10,000 viewers.

23:37.574 --> 23:52.712
that are artificially supported, artificially promoted, and programmed to be in front of more people than anyone from the grassroots perspective, like myself, or Mark Hulak, or even Joe Marshall, for example.

23:54.491 --> 24:04.721
It's unfortunate, ladies and gentlemen, but GigaOM Biological is the only channel, the only broadcast on the internet that can succinctly say anything remotely impressive like this.

24:05.542 --> 24:08.525
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

24:08.565 --> 24:12.689
Mark Kulak has helped a lot with assembling a group of PDF

24:13.891 --> 24:17.698
documents taken directly from books, historical books.

24:18.640 --> 24:23.108
One of the most important books that he has recently made a copy of.

24:26.740 --> 24:32.083
PDF of is this hypodermic injections by A. Rupiner.

24:32.123 --> 24:33.684
He's actually a Swiss guy.

24:35.946 --> 24:38.688
This hypodermic, can I switch over to here?

24:38.748 --> 24:40.389
Let me see if I can do that quick.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.091
Yes, this one here.

24:43.291 --> 24:47.934
I think Mark has this one up on his website and he's got a few more.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.756
And the thing that comes

24:53.098 --> 24:57.042
that is most remarkable about this is that these books are admissions.

24:58.703 --> 25:04.829
I would only have to turn a few pages into this book and read it out loud and you would see that it's admissions.

25:05.850 --> 25:15.340
It is absolutely positively admissions that they never had any clue that intramuscular injection was any different than any other kind of injection.

25:16.718 --> 25:21.619
that injection was just really neat because it didn't hurt people and it didn't leave any scars.

25:21.719 --> 25:27.980
And so it meant that you could put anything you wanted into somebody with an exact concentration and exact volume.

25:30.200 --> 25:41.282
And so these people started almost exclusively by administering opioids this way, morphine and some strychnine and some atropine.

25:42.222 --> 25:44.883
But you can see what I'm saying, the injection of

25:45.883 --> 26:07.969
water-based, saline-based chemicals like morphine or opium into places in the body and then transferring that seemingly effective medicine to the idea that, wow, we could also vaccinate people, we could expose people, we could cure people of all sorts of things if we just put the right stuff in there.

26:09.010 --> 26:13.031
Why put medicine in your mouth if the medicine needs to get in there?

26:14.622 --> 26:38.037
And there are actually books in multiple languages around the same time, between 1860 and 1880, where all of these doctors are coming under the agreement that the hypodermic needle will revolutionize medicine because it allows the precise placement of medicine, substances, whatever you want.

26:38.238 --> 26:43.321
Irritants, for example, were used as a way of treating certain diseases like rheumatoid.

26:44.222 --> 26:52.729
It was thought that you could irritate the side of the body opposite where the rheumatoid was and that that would send some kind of balance to the nervous system.

26:53.190 --> 26:56.793
And these kinds of ideas are all detailed in these books.

26:57.493 --> 27:10.165
And it is not to be underestimated how many combinations of substances were tried and attributed to curing all these different things that can even include things like, you know, exposure to cold wind.

27:11.118 --> 27:15.082
and numbness in the face cured by 11 days of opioid injections.

27:15.162 --> 27:17.704
Like there are real accounts of this.

27:18.945 --> 27:29.274
And this is not centuries ago, ladies and gentlemen, this is a century ago, a century and a half ago.

27:30.875 --> 27:33.818
It is not centuries ago.

27:34.419 --> 27:37.962
We have not been vaccinating for centuries.

27:38.945 --> 27:54.932
We have not been using a hypodermic needle for centuries, and we certainly have not understood the subtleties of the immune system or even the subtleties of the basics of how genetics might encode something to do with proteins.

27:54.972 --> 27:56.953
We haven't understood that for very long.

27:58.334 --> 28:00.815
So this insistence

28:02.455 --> 28:10.358
that this is some kind of proven thing is part of a scripted public health narrative.

28:12.879 --> 28:27.084
It may have been that in the 1950s and 1960s, these people thought that they were gonna solve this problem, that they would get a combination of substances that could be injected intramuscularly, and it would be able to augment the immune system or augment the health of a human.

28:27.684 --> 28:29.985
They just knew it was gonna be genetic.

28:33.564 --> 28:45.415
But of course, all the way back then, when you're just finding genes, or you're just finding DNA, you're just finding RNA, it's pretty hard to get to the stage where you can say, okay, that's what we're going to do.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.177
But of course, that's what they thought.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.340
Of course, that's what they thought.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.361
We've read the books.

28:52.884 --> 29:14.654
We know what Hilary Koprowski and Julian Huxley and Herman Muller and Joshua Lederberg were all thinking as the discovery of DNA and the apparent acknowledgement of what it might be was starting to get around in everybody's head.

29:15.174 --> 29:22.317
The idea was that we might be 10 years away from some serious, serious issues because we might have the keys to the kingdom.

29:24.676 --> 29:36.180
And of course, that was grossly overestimating the problem, grossly overestimating the irreducible complexity that even a bacteria and its phages represented.

29:37.304 --> 30:05.178
And after 10 years of the best minds trying to take DNA in its most simple system, the bacteria and the bacteriophage, and trying to understand how that whole thing works to produce heredity and produce sort of the recurring pattern integrity that is a bacteria and its phages, they did not manage to score that goal.

30:08.004 --> 30:20.411
And so we're still working under the same assumptions that they were working under back then, that at some point we're going to figure out the reason why there's DNA all over the place in all of our things and all of the world.

30:20.952 --> 30:33.279
And it's going to be something to do with why we're all here or something to do with why we all might be part of one whole, but it's not going to tell you how evolution worked.

30:34.753 --> 30:41.455
There's never going to be any story there that unlocks the chemical mystery of how the watch appeared from nowhere.

30:42.555 --> 30:47.556
Because you can't land on any other planet in the galaxy and find a Swiss watch.

30:48.176 --> 30:56.458
And if you did, the conclusion would not be that, holy cow, the evolution on this planet went in a really interesting direction.

30:59.568 --> 31:15.113
And it is very hard for me as a biologist to express how profound it is for me to have had the privilege and the opportunity over the course of the pandemic to pull myself out.

31:15.753 --> 31:27.337
Because I, at one point, would have argued very vigorously for the idea that evolution is an idea bigger than anything divine.

31:29.369 --> 31:32.971
And the idea is so enticing because of that.

31:33.172 --> 31:39.436
And the idea is only enticing if you accept the fact as evolution because DNA.

31:39.496 --> 31:43.879
And that is something that the Human Genome Project really exposes as a lie.

31:45.911 --> 31:50.514
And that, again, is something that in academia that is not going to be allowed to happen.

31:50.534 --> 31:59.279
That's the reason why transfection, the word, can't be used right now because all the Academicians that still have a job know this word.

32:00.160 --> 32:06.504
Many of them had to explain this word during their oral examination 10 years ago when they got their PhD.

32:08.805 --> 32:13.108
Many of them cut their teeth as PhD students using lipofectomy.

32:14.625 --> 32:21.067
And so they understand that in principle, this methodology is so old, this idea is so old.

32:21.147 --> 32:38.833
And the only thing that's happened over the last 20 years, it's become cheaper, because the technology that originates in the Human Genome Project has made it cheaper to make pure quantities of DNA, and pure quantities of DNA that could never and don't exist in nature.

32:41.195 --> 32:52.560
And so that's why I think it's important to say that RNA cannot pandemic, because that will challenge a lot of academicians to rethink what a pandemic really is and what phenomenon is at the heart of it.

32:53.080 --> 33:07.307
And the phenomenon at the heart of the pandemic, whether you think it's a natural virus or a lab leak, is the idea that a small, maybe even tiny, single quantity of an RNA molecule, because it has an HIV insert and a couple of fear and cleavage sites,

33:08.027 --> 33:20.215
could find itself going around the world continuously for decades, infecting everything from zoo animals to white-tailed deer to every human on the planet, and that is simply absurd.

33:21.872 --> 33:25.213
There's no biology to support that idea.

33:25.253 --> 33:38.118
And certainly the idea that evolution occurred because DNA is very, very contradictory to this idea because RNA has none of the chemical characteristics that DNA is purported to have.

33:38.298 --> 33:44.601
None of the stability, none of the reproducibility, none of the redundancy.

33:46.862 --> 33:49.983
And so it's impossible for this to have happened.

33:51.255 --> 33:53.417
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

33:53.857 --> 34:13.090
And I think neuroscientists and neurobiologists around the world, if they were honest with themselves and searched inside of their heart, and they've probably known this for 10 years because they write grants based on the idea that, you know, autism spectrum disorder is this wide range of things and we can make animal models that represent it.

34:13.999 --> 34:33.028
not that dissimilar to the animal models for Alzheimer's disease that only recapitulate a cellular phenomenon or only recapitulate a behavioral phenomenon, but don't really purport to or accomplish the kinds of sort of experimental things that can be done.

34:33.808 --> 34:35.709
They are blowing it with autism.

34:36.889 --> 34:48.092
Autism Spectrum Disorder, by definition, in any video that you find, is the broadest definition of developmental neurodisorder you can possibly imagine.

34:48.952 --> 34:53.293
Almost anything, in theory, could fall under the spectrum of autism.

34:54.853 --> 34:56.194
And that's by design.

34:57.654 --> 35:01.235
That's by design because it is part and parcel for this trap

35:02.239 --> 35:09.783
that lured us into believing that transfection was a new technology that hadn't really been tested before or never used widely.

35:10.964 --> 35:12.265
And that's just ridiculous.

35:13.866 --> 35:17.848
Finally, I just want to point this out one more time because I do think it's really important.

35:17.888 --> 35:22.971
The idea of a trans man and a trans woman is very simply a semantic game that they played with us.

35:23.031 --> 35:24.792
And I don't really know when it happened.

35:24.832 --> 35:29.034
I don't know if you can go on the internet and figure it out, but it's very simple to explain.

35:31.926 --> 35:45.913
If you are a man or a woman and you believe you should be the opposite, or you believe that you are genuinely a man trapped in a woman's body, then that's generally speaking not normal and that's totally okay.

35:46.714 --> 35:49.715
Just like somebody with Down syndrome is not normal.

35:50.356 --> 35:54.318
Just like somebody that would be born with only one eye is not normal.

35:55.955 --> 36:06.879
Somebody who's born and is convinced, I mean convinced, and this is the definition, this is very difficult, that they are a man and they are not, or they are and they aren't.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.560
It comes down to one thing, ladies and gentlemen.

36:10.860 --> 36:14.781
Do you want the parts of your body that you have or you do not?

36:14.921 --> 36:22.684
Because the moment that you start saying that you do not want the parts of the body that you have, you're not a normal person.

36:24.226 --> 36:29.790
And that's fine to treat that person with dignity and respect, but that's not normal.

36:30.371 --> 36:50.087
And we shouldn't be organizing anything in society around people that have a noticeable, and we should not be thinking about this in the way that they want you to think, which is that in order to treat those people with the respect that they deserve, they have to be able to become the thing they believe they are.

36:50.822 --> 36:54.084
And we have to call them the thing that they believe they are.

36:54.164 --> 36:57.726
And once you start to say it in those general terms, you see that it's ridiculous.

36:57.806 --> 37:07.572
And so in this sense, because there's medical terms and medical terminology, if you want to argue with a doctor that doesn't seem to understand it, just say it like this.

37:07.752 --> 37:13.375
If you are a man and you need to change to a woman, then you are a transitioning man.

37:15.416 --> 37:26.043
Any doctor should agree that there's no way you can ever fully transition to a woman because there are certain limitations to modern medicine that make that pretty impossible.

37:26.103 --> 37:29.225
And so as a result, you'll be transitioning for the rest of your life.

37:29.285 --> 37:34.709
It's kind of like a journey that starts on the surgery table and ends in your coffin.

37:36.147 --> 37:45.661
And so if we just call them what they are, which is trans men, and then trans men don't have to go into the ladies room, the trans men don't have to, I mean, it's all very simple.

37:46.783 --> 37:52.331
But because this game is being played, we are calling transfections vaccines.

37:53.703 --> 38:06.634
Because this kind of semantic game is being played, we are not differentiating in our vaccines, whether they are subcutaneous, or whether they are cutaneous, or whether they are oral, or whether they are intramuscular, they're all the same.

38:08.772 --> 38:27.697
Because in the same way that we can make an inverted, you know, have an inverted game with trans woman and trans man, we can also have a obfuscation game or a dilution game with the idea of autism spectrum disorder being some kind of real term that means something.

38:28.857 --> 38:31.998
Vaccine being a real term that means something.

38:34.659 --> 38:46.144
Whereas nobody in this movement has ever been able to progress to differentiate between intramuscular injection and subcutaneous injection or anything like that.

38:46.645 --> 38:53.168
No one's ever been able to explore the idea that which vaccines are given which way and does that correlate?

38:53.368 --> 39:02.692
None of these issues have ever become a part of our discussion because these people are following a script and America is trapped by this script.

39:06.653 --> 39:09.295
Wow, I really didn't want that introduction to be so long.

39:09.395 --> 39:10.016
My goodness.

39:10.977 --> 39:11.657
Sorry about that.

39:11.677 --> 39:12.018
Here we go.

39:13.300 --> 39:17.401
This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

39:17.741 --> 39:18.421
I'm Amy Goodman.

39:19.181 --> 39:28.803
In Washington, Democratic and Republican senators, two of them doctors, grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

39:28.843 --> 39:34.705
about his attacks on vaccines and ongoing turmoil at the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control.

39:35.205 --> 39:41.586
The hearing came a week after RFK fired the head of the CDC, Susan Menendez.

39:41.866 --> 39:44.892
I will agree that the trans thing is very ancient.

39:46.155 --> 39:47.598
That is true.

39:47.618 --> 39:47.878
However,

39:52.774 --> 39:56.957
It's modern manifestation in society.

39:57.698 --> 40:03.062
The vast majority of the young people are experiencing something that is not that.

40:03.122 --> 40:10.587
It is not this mystical, biological thing that occurs every once in a while and has a basis in biology.

40:10.767 --> 40:14.390
It is a purely social media inflicted

40:15.393 --> 40:25.501
probably nutrition-inflicted, probably environmental toxin-inflicted, but most likely it is social media-inflicted confusion.

40:28.644 --> 40:35.550
Social media-inflicted confusion that could also have to do with the availability of porn.

40:36.550 --> 40:44.017
It could have to do with the changing landscape of media that's available to these young kids that was never available to us.

40:45.247 --> 40:51.908
When I was growing up, the crazy thing was to go up into somebody's tree house and find out that they had a playboy up there.

40:53.548 --> 41:03.010
I mean, this kind of idea that kids are growing up in a completely normal and safe childhood with social media in their pocket is absurd.

41:06.811 --> 41:12.692
And so it is definitely, definitely, it's an old thing, but it is being,

41:15.006 --> 41:24.541
It is, and as like many other things being distorted and being used against us essentially as a mythology instead of as a truth.

41:25.613 --> 41:31.978
Um, this is very interesting to watch and, and we'll, we'll put it in context as we see how it rolls.

41:32.458 --> 41:33.939
Of course, this was last week.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.302
Um, and I need you to see it if you can.

41:37.962 --> 41:39.143
Um, this is democracy.

41:39.203 --> 41:42.486
Now it's equivalent to like the YouTube PBS news.

41:43.266 --> 41:54.635
Um, you might not think that very many people watch it, but listen to this very carefully by my best estimation, the Maha movement, best estimation,

41:56.840 --> 42:00.265
It's less than 20% of the American population.

42:02.207 --> 42:03.108
At best, you get 25.

42:03.389 --> 42:07.654
Now, why did I use reverb there?

42:07.714 --> 42:11.619
Because if you don't understand that this is not a 50-50 divide,

42:14.341 --> 42:25.804
that seven or eight out of 10 Americans that you meet on the street is going to think you're ridiculous for ever having supported RFK Jr, especially after these performances.

42:28.745 --> 42:31.786
I think you're underestimating the trouble that America is in.

42:31.846 --> 42:38.688
And I think you're underestimating where we are as a society because of social media and our use of it.

42:40.250 --> 42:43.632
We've got to pull our family and friends out of this mess.

42:44.433 --> 42:46.815
I don't want to leave anybody behind if I don't have to.

42:48.156 --> 42:51.738
Just over a month after she was confirmed to the position.

42:52.619 --> 43:06.169
On Thursday, two former top officials at the National Institutes of Health filed whistleblower complaints saying they were forced out of their leadership positions after they criticized the Trump administration for canceling grants and spreading vaccine skepticism.

43:06.889 --> 43:13.356
In June, Kennedy fired all 17 expert members of a CDC vaccine advisory panel.

43:13.837 --> 43:18.902
Health officials inside and outside the government are increasingly warning about Kennedy's actions.

43:19.022 --> 43:22.706
Three senior CDC officials resigned in protest last week.

43:23.207 --> 43:24.849
This week, more than 1,000 current and

43:25.930 --> 43:34.673
And former HHS workers sent a letter to Congress demanding Kennedy's resignation over his pseudoscientific claims and his attacks on public health.

43:35.233 --> 43:42.376
Nine former CDC directors recently wrote in The New York Times, Kennedy's endangering the health of every American.

43:42.876 --> 43:49.338
At Thursday's hearing, both Republicans and Democrats grilled Kennedy, with some calling for his resignation.

43:49.918 --> 43:58.124
This is Republican Senator Dr. John Barrasso, majority whip in the Senate, a close ally of President Trump.

43:58.644 --> 44:00.806
He's an orthopedic surgeon.

44:02.107 --> 44:08.472
So, over the last 50 years, vaccines are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide.

44:08.712 --> 44:09.672
I support vaccines.

44:09.732 --> 44:10.353
I'm a doctor.

44:10.393 --> 44:11.154
Vaccines work.

44:12.375 --> 44:17.719
Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines.

44:18.559 --> 44:20.360
Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.

44:20.801 --> 44:31.648
The public has seen measles outbreaks, leadership in the National Institute of Health questioning the use of mRNA vaccines, the recently confirmed director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fired.

44:32.448 --> 44:34.830
Americans don't know who to rely on.

44:36.164 --> 44:40.265
That was Republican Senator Dr. John Barrasso of Wyoming.

44:40.465 --> 44:45.987
He's number two in the Senate, speaking to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy.

44:46.487 --> 44:50.008
And this is Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.

44:51.068 --> 44:54.489
Do you accept the fact that a million Americans died from COVID?

44:55.790 --> 44:56.850
I don't know how many died.

44:58.294 --> 45:00.255
You're the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

45:01.115 --> 45:04.316
You don't have any idea how many Americans died from COVID?

45:04.916 --> 45:13.499
I don't think anybody knows that because the, there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC and there was so many perverse incentives.

45:13.539 --> 45:16.060
And these are models that you should know.

45:16.080 --> 45:19.581
You don't know the answer of how many Americans died from COVID.

45:19.881 --> 45:22.101
This is the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

45:22.402 --> 45:23.782
Do you think the vaccine?

45:24.762 --> 45:26.663
So this is important to see.

45:28.120 --> 45:42.154
because he has had eight months in the office to hire somebody like me or anybody else and he knows to try and come up with an answer to this question because obviously it's a pretty important answer.

45:43.815 --> 45:46.158
And it would have been great for him to throw back, well,

45:47.836 --> 45:53.200
At least a half a million Americans died of opioid overdose in the last five years.

45:53.400 --> 45:59.984
And so I'm not sure that a lot of those haven't been attributed, unfortunately, to COVID.

46:01.986 --> 46:10.932
And to go further into the ideas of why a million people weren't killed by COVID.

46:12.373 --> 46:15.035
But instead, he's so imprecise

46:16.980 --> 46:35.206
so lack of substance it almost it's almost like it's shocking until you realize that this is the same kind of scripted bullshit that ran paul and tony fauci pulled from 2020 all the way to 2022 yelling at each other getting all out of hand

46:36.874 --> 46:38.095
This is a script.

46:38.175 --> 46:40.295
That's why so many people have seen it.

46:40.376 --> 46:51.860
That's why the PBS news hour and democracy now, and all these people are all going to cover it where all the podcasts are covering it because it is the narrative.

46:51.900 --> 46:58.763
It is the theater and they're using social media to make sure that everybody sees it as reality.

46:59.103 --> 47:00.224
It's not reality.

47:03.143 --> 47:04.364
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:04.404 --> 47:07.045
was a trap, just like Alex Jones is a trap.

47:07.845 --> 47:09.926
Just like Donald Trump was just a trap.

47:12.807 --> 47:16.629
You can't possibly believe that Donald Trump is driving the car right now.

47:16.689 --> 47:19.330
And you can't believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:19.410 --> 47:25.132
is driving the back of the pivoting, you know, great big long fire truck.

47:25.793 --> 47:29.454
And they're coming to the rescue to save the democracy of America.

47:29.474 --> 47:30.675
You can't believe that.

47:32.375 --> 47:58.715
not after what's happened in Israel, what these people have said about it, what little is available on social media about Russia and Ukraine, and what little is available about the history of Ukraine and our presence there, what's little available about all of these stories in Libya, what's little available about the history of America suggests that we have been watching a show for a very long time.

47:59.235 --> 48:08.383
And once you start to accept that idea and see this as a theater, the stress that it is designed to create doesn't exist anymore in your life.

48:11.465 --> 48:24.596
And the desire to choose a team that the less, you know, wrong side or the side that has more people that you like on it, even though both sides have clowns.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.959
So either way, you're picking a circus.

48:29.437 --> 48:31.298
instead of a group of serious people.

48:33.660 --> 48:43.906
And if you've allowed podcasters to help you decide, then you're really, really lost, because that is the heart of the weaponization, the militarization of social media.

48:44.307 --> 48:52.172
That's why our Health and Human Services Secretary and our NIH Director have been on more podcasts than any previous directors ever.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.675
did anything to prevent additional deaths?

48:56.975 --> 49:01.559
Again, I would like to see the data and talk about the data.

49:01.579 --> 49:07.584
You've had this job for eight months and you don't know the data about whether the vaccine saved lives?

49:07.624 --> 49:10.807
The problem is that they didn't have the data.

49:11.868 --> 49:15.030
What has he been doing for eight months?

49:15.110 --> 49:17.132
Who did he hire and what are they doing?

49:18.888 --> 49:22.409
How is it possible that they are able to get dunked on like this?

49:22.489 --> 49:36.692
If this guy's been praying for more than 20 years for God to put him in a position to end the chronic health crisis in America, and it culminated with the pandemic and with Donald Trump picking him to be HHS secretary.

49:37.072 --> 49:42.254
And then he didn't even bother to even hire like a college intern to on this project.

49:42.914 --> 49:45.975
He didn't bother to put, I don't know, Jessica Rose on it.

49:46.715 --> 49:47.615
Are you kidding me?

49:50.401 --> 49:54.262
Biden administration, absolutely dismal.

49:54.522 --> 49:55.462
Who is politicizing?

49:55.482 --> 49:58.443
You're saying the Biden administration politicized all the data?

49:58.783 --> 50:00.923
Go back to West Lerner Cantwell just then.

50:00.963 --> 50:03.564
Go to the Trump Surgeon General.

50:03.884 --> 50:05.264
They fired Dr. Grubb.

50:05.305 --> 50:08.145
They fired all the people who questioned the orthodoxy.

50:08.165 --> 50:10.606
They fired Dr. Gruber, Dr. Kautz.

50:10.726 --> 50:15.267
Mr. Chairman, the Secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't know how many Americans died from COVID.

50:16.207 --> 50:20.391
I don't know if the vaccine helped prevent any deaths.

50:20.931 --> 50:23.793
And you are sitting as Secretary of Health and Human Services?

50:24.494 --> 50:26.075
How can you be that ignorant?

50:26.936 --> 50:34.962
That was Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia questioning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:35.723 --> 50:40.667
And this is Republican Senator Dr. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

50:42.406 --> 50:47.740
I said yesterday, I believe it, that President Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed.

50:48.911 --> 50:50.671
If he had been President Obama, he would have gotten it.

50:51.292 --> 51:01.874
But because of Operation Warp Speed, forcing the federal government to come to a vaccine development within 10 months when others said it couldn't be done, we saved millions of lives globally, trillions of dollars.

51:01.894 --> 51:05.075
We reopened economies, an incredible accomplishment.

51:06.215 --> 51:12.316
Mr. Secretary, do you agree with me that the president deserves a Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed?

51:12.816 --> 51:13.776
Absolutely, Senator.

51:13.856 --> 51:14.877
It's phenomenal.

51:14.917 --> 51:15.477
Let me ask you.

51:16.597 --> 51:23.066
But you just told Senator Bennett that the COVID vaccine killed more people than COVID.

51:24.324 --> 51:26.606
Wait, I did not say that.

51:27.106 --> 51:29.908
Okay, let me ask because you also the senator.

51:29.928 --> 51:31.149
I just want to make clear.

51:31.169 --> 51:33.210
I cannot say we'll check the record.

51:33.250 --> 51:34.211
That's a question of fact.

51:34.991 --> 51:39.975
You also said that you were also as lead attorney for the Children's Health Defense.

51:40.575 --> 51:45.878
You engaged in multiple lawsuits attempting to restrict access to the COVID vaccine.

51:46.619 --> 51:53.864
Again, it surprises me that you think so highly of Operation Warp Speed when as an attorney, you attempted to restrict access.

51:54.484 --> 51:55.605
Let me ask.

51:55.785 --> 51:56.965
I'm happy to explain why.

51:56.985 --> 52:01.287
I have three minutes and 30 seconds left.

52:02.328 --> 52:18.135
It also surprises me because you've canceled, or HHA's did, but apparently under your direction, $500 million in contracts using the mRNA vaccine platform that was critical to Operation Warp Speed.

52:18.195 --> 52:22.457
Again, an accomplishment that I think President Trump should get a Nobel Prize for.

52:23.397 --> 52:25.919
You canceled $500 million in contracts.

52:27.019 --> 52:32.042
That's Republican Senator Dr. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

52:32.202 --> 52:34.124
Was it also Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:34.184 --> 52:35.564
breathing into the microphone?

52:35.605 --> 52:37.446
Like, holy cow, that was awful.

52:38.666 --> 52:42.128
This is either a U.S.

52:42.208 --> 52:49.233
government being driven into the ground like a cruise ship into a harbor at full speed, or it's a theater.

52:49.994 --> 53:04.421
Do you actually believe that all of the rich, powerful people that run the banks and the investment firms and companies that are worth much more than Apple or Google, you know, like companies like, I don't know, ExxonMobil and that.

53:04.841 --> 53:12.385
Do you think those people are allowing the United States government to just kind of be driven by a guy like Donald Trump?

53:13.166 --> 53:19.473
They're allowing HHS to be run by a guy like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:19.533 --> 53:21.596
And you know, if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:21.636 --> 53:24.879
would have just hired me, then I would be on TV.

53:24.899 --> 53:26.722
Do you really believe that?

53:28.220 --> 53:48.328
Do you really think that they chose Jay Bhattacharya because from the long list of very intelligent, competent American scientists and academicians and people at all of these, you know, deans of this and deans of that, that he couldn't find anybody but Jay Bhattacharya?

53:49.328 --> 53:52.529
Are you trying to tell me that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:52.609 --> 53:53.830
is the best we've got?

53:55.649 --> 54:02.156
And you think that Donald Trump is the best, that he won by a narrow margin.

54:02.196 --> 54:06.181
And that same narrow margin is where this debate is occurring right now.

54:06.581 --> 54:08.143
And it's not a narrow margin.

54:08.223 --> 54:12.107
Most of America thinks that this is wrong.

54:12.287 --> 54:13.028
It's bad.

54:13.949 --> 54:21.013
Most of America likes and accepts vaccines and vaccination, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:21.453 --> 54:25.275
and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland have said from the very beginning.

54:25.315 --> 54:28.997
They don't, they're not anti-vaccine, they want safe vaccines.

54:29.417 --> 54:40.303
And of course, the script is that the safest vaccine ever is the one that we rolled out and saved millions of people from the novel virus with, the COVID vaccine.

54:41.892 --> 54:52.219
And so you might think that the truth about turbo cancer is getting out, or the truth about SB40 is getting out, or the truth about the spike protein is getting out, but it's not.

54:53.079 --> 54:53.880
It's not.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.562
And it's never going to get out because it's not in the script.

54:57.622 --> 54:58.683
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:58.703 --> 55:00.524
is not gonna say that in four months.

55:00.684 --> 55:02.325
No, no, no, ladies and gentlemen.

55:02.865 --> 55:04.747
The cage is closing right now.

55:05.638 --> 55:18.983
If you do not disavow these people and your support for them by calling them the frauds that they are and pivot now, I don't know where this is going to lead.

55:20.723 --> 55:24.805
Questioning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:25.345 --> 55:28.646
during a highly contentious hearing Thursday.

55:29.026 --> 55:31.327
This is more of Senator Cassidy.

55:32.705 --> 55:40.089
I also told Senator Wyden at the outset that you didn't want to take vaccines away from people.

55:40.549 --> 55:47.832
And as I conclude, I would like to say this, because of the conflicting recommendations made about COVID.

55:48.273 --> 55:52.535
This is from Eric Erickson, good conservative out of Atlanta, Georgia, occasionally gives me help.

55:53.455 --> 55:55.398
My wife has stage four lung cancer.

55:55.418 --> 55:58.060
She is one of the people that COVID vaccine actually helps.

55:58.781 --> 56:02.866
Thanks to the current mess at HHS, CVS is unable to get her vaccine.

56:03.666 --> 56:07.631
Secondly, an email from a physician friend of mine.

56:08.231 --> 56:10.434
Hey Bill, I'm not even sure what I'm asking you.

56:10.894 --> 56:13.856
But we're all confused and concerned about who can get the COVID vaccine.

56:14.417 --> 56:16.718
We are having our attorney try and render an opinion.

56:17.219 --> 56:23.443
But there's no firm guidance and concern about liability if vaccines are given to a patient requested but not on the current CDC list.

56:23.983 --> 56:28.867
Pharmacists are requiring a prescription now even for patients over 65, creating a huge headache.

56:29.327 --> 56:30.288
I submit these for the record.

56:30.728 --> 56:31.409
Without objection.

56:31.449 --> 56:33.610
I would say effectively we're denying people vaccine.

56:34.311 --> 56:35.111
Senator Cantwell.

56:35.411 --> 56:35.972
I hate it wrong.

56:36.460 --> 56:42.444
Again, Dr. Cassidy, Louisiana senator, at Thursday's hearing.

56:43.385 --> 56:45.166
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

56:45.126 --> 56:48.568
's record as HHS is what we're looking at.

56:48.748 --> 56:56.453
We're joined by Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

56:56.993 --> 56:58.074
He was just blocked

56:58.114 --> 57:01.839
from participating on the FDA Advisory Committee on Vaccines.

57:02.420 --> 57:09.270
Dr. Offit is co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine recommended for universal use in infants by the CDC.

57:09.690 --> 57:11.633
Dr. Offit, welcome back to Democracy Now!

57:14.396 --> 57:15.737
Both of them Republican.

57:16.757 --> 57:29.082
One of them, Dr. Barrasso, is number two Republican leader in the Senate, severely questioning Kennedy, R.F.K., Jr., along, of course, with the Democrats.

57:30.343 --> 57:36.608
Can you address overall what happened yesterday, what you think was most important that came out of it?

57:37.149 --> 57:43.995
And we want to really focus on what his position means for access to vaccines in this country.

57:45.947 --> 57:47.748
Well, so Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:47.908 --> 57:54.534
has a 20-year history of being an anti-vaccine propagandist, science denialist, and conspiracy theorist.

57:55.034 --> 58:02.560
Since 2016, he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group, to represent them.

58:03.160 --> 58:09.345
Now, I want you to imagine for a second what this requires you to accept if you are on the left.

58:10.416 --> 58:25.307
It requires you to accept that despite everyone's best efforts and all the knowledge and science out there, for nearly 20 years, according to Paul Offit, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:25.347 --> 58:29.030
has been able to enrich himself by pushing lies.

58:29.290 --> 58:35.895
And in fact, since 2016, he's been getting hundreds of thousands of dollars to push lies.

58:36.035 --> 58:39.238
And despite Paul Offit's best efforts,

58:39.918 --> 58:51.409
despite Peter Hotez's best efforts, Tony Fauci's best, all this funding and all this teaching and all this stuff, Robert F. Kennedy still is able to get away with it.

58:51.889 --> 58:53.511
Isn't that unbelievable?

58:54.091 --> 58:59.917
It's almost as if this guy is a very ineffective sort of, you know, advocate.

59:00.017 --> 59:03.700
He's almost like a very, all the people, how is it possible?

59:04.681 --> 59:05.702
How is it possible?

59:07.011 --> 59:09.193
He gets into Rolling Stone.

59:09.774 --> 59:17.961
He can influence the uptake of measles vaccine around the earth despite their best efforts.

59:19.943 --> 59:21.044
It's just ridiculous.

59:21.104 --> 59:23.706
It's an absolutely preposterous story.

59:23.746 --> 59:32.354
And the old man in the picture here who has the angry face is just angry because he never thought he was gonna have to play this character for so damn long.

59:32.827 --> 59:34.928
to represent their anti-vaccine point of view.

59:35.768 --> 59:37.009
He's not paid by them anymore.

59:37.209 --> 59:44.052
He's paid by us to be the number one public health officer in this country to represent the public's health, but he doesn't.

59:44.232 --> 59:48.754
He continues to be the anti-vaccine activist and propagandist that he always was.

59:48.774 --> 59:52.075
I mean, he has said that he thinks no vaccine is beneficial.

59:52.475 --> 59:56.137
He has said he thinks the COVID vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made.

59:56.497 --> 01:00:00.659
He said that if he could go back in time, he would pay anything not to vaccinate his own children.

01:00:01.019 --> 01:00:09.411
And I think probably the best example of this, and the reason he should have been fired on the spot, was when during... For example, autism's false prophets.

01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:17.102
So again, the argument is framed under these false pretenses that autism is something that you can diagnose very specifically.

01:00:17.603 --> 01:00:23.745
And so therefore, finding a cause or causes of it is something that can very specifically be done.

01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:43.650
But of course, that's exactly the opposite of the reality of autism spectrum disorder, both on the side of the neurobiology and the neuroscience side that I was a part of and how ridiculously imprecise they are, and also on the anti-back side, how they are very ridiculously imprecise and more importantly, have not made any progress.

01:00:45.203 --> 01:01:05.136
if you were really going to legitimately take an anti-vax position your understanding of it and your ability to explain the nuances of your objection would have evolved over two decades but instead it hasn't evolved at all and the same people are making the same arguments for decades and that can't be

01:01:06.056 --> 01:01:09.217
a real human interaction.

01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:13.738
That is a scripted military bullshit operation.

01:01:13.858 --> 01:01:16.179
And he's a part of it, whether he knows it or not.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:25.462
The crazy part is, is that this guy trained with Hilary Koprowski and Stanley Plotkin, so the odds are pretty good that he knows.

01:01:26.322 --> 01:01:28.423
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., no way he knows.

01:01:29.025 --> 01:01:29.425
No way.

01:01:29.765 --> 01:01:43.210
This measles epidemic, when we've had an epidemic that has involved probably about 5000 people in this country, the biggest epidemic we've had in 33 years, we've had two children die to healthy little girls in West Texas, six and eight year old die.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.570
That's the first measles death since 2003.

01:01:46.071 --> 01:01:47.031
During this epidemic.

01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:52.793
Now, if I'm right, and this was a setup, it should be very easy to demonstrate that it was a setup.

01:01:52.913 --> 01:01:54.613
Well, let's do it for two children.

01:01:55.774 --> 01:01:56.274
Let's do it.

01:02:14.887 --> 01:02:16.328
Stay focused on the biology.

01:02:17.388 --> 01:02:18.749
Don't take the bait on TV.

01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:22.571
This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:23.571
I'm Amy Goodman.

01:02:24.051 --> 01:02:25.152
And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.

01:02:25.252 --> 01:02:28.714
Welcome to our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world.

01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:29.734
Here we are in 2015.

01:02:32.492 --> 01:02:34.734
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's 10 years ago.

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:39.018
The video that you see playing in black and white is the video we just watched.

01:02:39.539 --> 01:02:42.301
And behind me, you see all cause mortality in America.

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:43.862
Yes, this line is not level.

01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:49.908
And you see the pneumonia being lost of control in 2020.

01:02:49.968 --> 01:02:53.972
You see the murder and lies depicted graphically here.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:03:13.459
And if we go back to 2015 to the same lady, same ladies, wouldn't it be really weird if the same argument was happening 10 years ago and the argument still hadn't been resolved by either side, despite either side being sure they're right?

01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:18.702
Take it away.

01:03:20.725 --> 01:03:26.508
The federal government has confirmed over 100 people across 14 states have now developed measles.

01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:41.517
Public health officials suspect the outbreak, which is concentrated in California, began when an infected person visited Disneyland in Anaheim in December.

01:03:42.298 --> 01:03:48.942
On Wednesday, Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, Los Angeles County's interim health officer, updated reporters on the outbreak.

01:03:49.656 --> 01:03:56.957
The outbreak of measles that we're currently experiencing is the largest that we've had in this county and in this state in 15 years.

01:03:57.877 --> 01:04:05.719
Public health is doing all we can to identify cases and to isolate contacts so as to prevent spread.

01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:11.120
However, to end this outbreak, we need to do more and we need help.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.521
I encourage everyone to review their vaccination status and if needed, to get the vaccine now.

01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:22.961
Fifteen years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention proclaimed victory over measles.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:32.408
But in recent years, there's been an increase in outbreaks, as a growing number of parents have opted not to have their children vaccinated, claiming a link between vaccines and autism.

01:04:33.028 --> 01:04:41.675
The prestigious medical journal Lancet published a study in 1998 showing such a link, but the study was later retracted and has been widely discredited.

01:04:42.395 --> 01:04:48.539
According to the CDC, one in 12 children born in the United States is not being vaccinated as recommended.

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:58.185
On Wednesday, two California lawmakers announced a bill to eliminate, quote, personal belief exemptions that allow parents to refuse to vaccinate their children.

01:04:58.805 --> 01:05:06.891
The state has allowed such exemptions since 1961, when it first required all public school teachers and students to be inoculated against polio.

01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:13.934
But since 2000, the rate of parents seeking exemptions has tripled to about one in every 40 children.

01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:22.478
Meanwhile, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer asked state health officials to go further and eliminate, quote, religious exemptions.

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:28.221
Several potential Republican presidential candidates have also weighed in on the debate.

01:05:28.861 --> 01:05:36.525
On Monday, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, said he'd heard of instances where vaccines caused mental disorders.

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:40.491
The hepatitis B vaccine is now given to newborns.

01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:44.174
We sometimes give five and six vaccines all at one time.

01:05:44.675 --> 01:05:54.982
Is it impossible to believe that the hepatitis vaccine being given at birth and we sometimes give up to five vaccines at once?

01:05:55.102 --> 01:06:01.627
Is it possible that in 2015, this guy is saying exactly what they're saying right now?

01:06:02.408 --> 01:06:03.349
Is it possible?

01:06:04.872 --> 01:06:06.433
that that's just accident?

01:06:07.153 --> 01:06:12.915
Or can you possibly consider and see that this is one continuous script?

01:06:14.716 --> 01:06:19.757
And in fact, if you do the requisite research, you will see that this script goes back farther than 2015.

01:06:20.778 --> 01:06:26.340
It's just that these people and this narrative first tested and adopted in the UK,

01:06:28.228 --> 01:06:46.053
was actually imported, including some of those people, to the United States and a collective group of fakers was recruited and headed by, at least as a figurehead, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:46.093 --> 01:06:49.814
But behind him were people like Brian Hooker and Mary Holland,

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:58.136
and Judy Mikobitz and James Lyons Weiler and Mary Holland and Robert Malone.

01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:04.420
And all of those people have been behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.540
for these 10 years.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.803
And so it's not by accident that he's saying this on television 10 years ago.

01:07:10.843 --> 01:07:14.124
It's not by accident that Paul Offit is gonna be on this show.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:21.988
And it's not by accident that Mary Holland is gonna be on this show because they're all still on the same show right now.

01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:38.738
playing the same characters, with the same stupid script, with the same stupid motivations, that haven't progressed in understanding, sharpened in their ability to communicate it, and neither has their goal been refined or even remotely defined.

01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:41.040
It's remarkable.

01:07:42.515 --> 01:07:44.116
I chose to have mine delayed.

01:07:44.156 --> 01:07:53.602
I don't want the government telling me that I have to give my newborn hepatitis B vaccine, which is transmitted by sexually transmitted disease and or blood transfusions.

01:07:53.962 --> 01:07:55.543
Do I think it's ultimately a good idea?

01:07:55.563 --> 01:07:55.743
Yeah.

01:07:55.763 --> 01:07:58.084
And so I had mine staggered over several months.

01:07:58.545 --> 01:08:02.847
I've heard of many tragic- That sounds a lot like the Paul Thomas argument, right?

01:08:02.887 --> 01:08:07.550
The Paul Thomas that in 2017 was already talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.251
maybe being a presidential candidate.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:16.275
You know, the presidential candidate that they're talking about in the 2008 Skyhorse publishing book?

01:08:17.436 --> 01:08:19.557
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you can see it.

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:20.698
We've been set up.

01:08:21.238 --> 01:08:26.241
And it's okay to admit that you fell for it if we were set up over a decade.

01:08:27.241 --> 01:08:29.423
Falling for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:34.486
means that you fell for something that was executed over a decade.

01:08:34.846 --> 01:08:36.467
You don't need to be ashamed of it.

01:08:40.632 --> 01:08:47.920
cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.162
I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea.

01:08:50.182 --> 01:08:51.304
I think they're a good thing.

01:08:51.704 --> 01:08:53.706
But I think the parents should have some input.

01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:55.868
The state doesn't own your children.

01:08:56.289 --> 01:08:57.470
Parents own the children.

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:58.952
And it is an issue of freedom.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:08:59.612
if fifth

01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:16.791
Paul has deep ties to vaccine skeptics.

01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:24.217
For 20 years, he was a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which has backed a moratorium on vaccine mandates.

01:09:24.737 --> 01:09:33.664
Meanwhile, another possible Republican presidential candidate, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was questioned about vaccines during his trip to England.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.402
Do you think Americans should vaccinate their kids?

01:09:36.522 --> 01:09:37.623
Is the measles vaccine safe?

01:09:37.843 --> 01:09:40.245
All I can say is that we vaccinate ours.

01:09:40.726 --> 01:09:45.029
And so, you know, that's the best expression I can give you my opinion.

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:50.034
You know, it's much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official.

01:09:50.054 --> 01:09:51.495
What I said was that there has to be a balance.

01:09:51.815 --> 01:09:57.458
And so if you're gonna believe that this is all spontaneous, you also have to accept that this happened on the same day in the same program.

01:09:57.478 --> 01:10:02.760
A regressive autism, very different than profound autism, which is what they call it now, but I think it's actually the same thing.

01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:24.049
Holland is a research scholar at NYU School of Law and advisor to Health Choice.

01:10:24.689 --> 01:10:26.611
She's a research scholar?

01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:34.338
Wow, that's starting to sound like an adjunct professor or some bullshit like that.

01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:38.943
Wow, oh my gosh, don't forget she also spent a lot of time in Russia.

01:10:38.963 --> 01:10:43.867
Oh, Mary Holland, Mary Holland, Mary Holland.

01:10:44.853 --> 01:10:56.619
also contributed to the blog, Age of Autism, and the co-editor of the book, Vaccine Epidemic, How Corporate Greed, Bias Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.401
Mary Holland, welcome to Democracy Now.

01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:13.749
Could you talk about- So we're supposed to believe that she's believed that this is dangerous for so long that she had a book already in 2015, but somehow or another, she's been so ineffectual at making any progress

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:22.375
that essentially they're in the same place making the same dumb arguments about freedom or anti-mandates 10 years later.

01:11:23.336 --> 01:11:30.001
Think about that, how much of a failure that is unless she's doing her job extremely well.

01:11:33.328 --> 01:11:35.669
your position on vaccinations?

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:36.409
Yes, absolutely.

01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.791
So, all vaccines, like prescription drugs, are considered unavoidably unsafe.

01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:42.952
They carry known risks and unknown risks.

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:50.715
There's no question—and I don't believe Professor Rice or Dr. Offit would disagree—that death is caused by some vaccines to some children.

01:11:51.035 --> 01:11:54.697
And severe injury, brain damage in particular, that's indisputable.

01:11:55.077 --> 01:12:02.220
And for that reason, industry and the medical profession were given by Congress virtually blanket liability protection.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.663
So we have now an industry with high profits and exceedingly low litigation risks.

01:12:08.043 --> 01:12:11.745
I think that should set off some alarm bells for us, as it is.

01:12:12.445 --> 01:12:19.549
I also think that the global standard for ethical medicine today is prior, free, and informed consent.

01:12:19.949 --> 01:12:27.473
And what Dr. Offit and Professor Reese are suggesting is that there should be no free consent for vaccination.

01:12:27.813 --> 01:12:29.654
I think that's a very serious

01:12:30.214 --> 01:12:33.478
departure from medical ethics, and we have to look at it for what it is.

01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:35.200
This is not just about tort liability.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.522
It's about informed consent.

01:12:37.163 --> 01:12:47.456
What about the issue of when a child goes to school who might be infected because they have not had a vaccine, that they then will infect other kids?

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:50.157
I think infectious disease is real, Amy.

01:12:50.257 --> 01:12:52.399
Infectious disease is a serious problem.

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:56.201
I think what you do when a kid is sick is the kid stays home from school.

01:12:56.241 --> 01:12:58.482
You make sure that you have medical leave for parents.

01:12:58.522 --> 01:12:59.843
You make sure that there's healthcare.

01:12:59.883 --> 01:13:10.809
So think about how quickly it went from being about the biology, which was either her kid was injured or vaccines are unavoidably unsafe, but then never defining why.

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:16.533
She says that every year vaccines kill kids, but why?

01:13:17.543 --> 01:13:17.923
How?

01:13:19.064 --> 01:13:20.225
What is the mechanism?

01:13:20.305 --> 01:13:22.986
Because that would be progress, right?

01:13:23.367 --> 01:13:27.609
In 10 years, they should have gotten better at saying exactly why and how.

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:37.316
But again, we've got video of people like, I don't know, Del Bigtree talking about how every year a certain number of kids are getting killed by vaccines every year.

01:13:37.336 --> 01:13:40.998
And it's just an acceptable risk that we don't even quantify.

01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:44.120
And so I just want to know what that acceptable risk is.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.701
And it's so crazy to ask.

01:13:47.932 --> 01:14:05.623
And so think about how incompetent it would be if your goal was to save kids from injected poisons, but you were so incompetent that somebody like Brandy Vaughn could make you look like such an idiot that you'd have to kill him.

01:14:06.684 --> 01:14:10.266
That Tony Bark would make you look so foolish that you'd have to kill her.

01:14:11.544 --> 01:14:12.945
Because that's what we have here.

01:14:13.326 --> 01:14:32.104
We have a scenario where these people that were put in place were put in place specifically to rise above and stand in front of people who could make progress and could accurately articulate the ridiculousness of trying to augment the healthy immune system of a child with intramuscular injection.

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:39.787
And anybody that got close enough to enunciating that simple question was killed before 2020.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:56.770
And all of the people that are in front of us now descend from groups and organizations that are infiltrated by, moderated by, seen over by people like Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you know, Del Bigtree.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:59.291
These people are all part of a show.

01:15:00.711 --> 01:15:13.234
that is also probably responsible for the murder of Brandy Vaughn, the murder of Tony Bark, and for the coordinated sort of Truman Show victim that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:13.274 --> 01:15:15.154
I don't think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:15.735 --> 01:15:26.157
is smart enough or clever enough to know how he's being used because he has been following the advice of the same people for more than a decade, all the way back to this time.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:29.552
And these people are now trusted.

01:15:29.812 --> 01:15:36.678
It's impossible for him to accept that there are 10 people around him who have loyalties to people other than him.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:38.900
But it's definitely true.

01:15:42.223 --> 01:15:44.265
Otherwise, they'd just use somebody else.

01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:50.651
But this guy's very convenient and very useful because he's not smart enough to see through it.

01:15:53.197 --> 01:15:54.898
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:16:06.123
If they are smart enough to see through it, they're also smart enough to know that it's probably a better idea for them to stay on their script because otherwise we'll put somebody else there and it won't be good for them.

01:16:07.784 --> 01:16:11.185
And once you sign up for this mess, you're in for the long haul.

01:16:11.245 --> 01:16:12.346
That's what you see here.

01:16:12.406 --> 01:16:16.708
This is not somebody who's struggled with her life over the last 10 years.

01:16:16.748 --> 01:16:21.750
This is a person who makes more than a quarter million dollars a year, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:25.465
for children.

01:16:26.205 --> 01:16:27.426
And I believe in quarantine.

01:16:27.627 --> 01:16:34.893
I have no problem with the government, in certain circumstances that warrant it, saying people must stay home, or they even must go to other places.

01:16:35.253 --> 01:16:47.124
But I absolutely have a problem with the idea that the state can force, through criminal and civil sanctions or failure to educate children, that they have to take compulsory medical interventions.

01:16:47.264 --> 01:16:49.105
Talk about your own personal story, Mary.

01:16:49.165 --> 01:16:55.068
Just very briefly, my interest in this as a lawyer and as an advocate stems from my personal experience.

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:57.649
I watched a child reverse in their development.

01:16:57.909 --> 01:17:01.891
That's one of the most horrible things any adult or parent can see.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:10.635
You don't want to see, and it is not normal to see a child lose all speech, lose all sleep, lose all bowel function, lose all eating function.

01:17:10.695 --> 01:17:11.836
And that's what I lived through.

01:17:11.856 --> 01:17:12.656
With your child?

01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:13.396
With my own son.

01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:25.091
fortunate that my son has substantially recovered over the years, but through painful efforts, great expense, and his injury is not categorized anywhere.

01:17:25.151 --> 01:17:31.860
Doctors don't generally perceive things as vaccine injury, but there is no other plausible explanation for what happened to my child.

01:17:32.401 --> 01:17:34.222
So there was a temporal association.

01:17:34.302 --> 01:17:38.943
He had received his standard vaccines, most of which contained thimerosal.

01:17:39.303 --> 01:17:41.624
So that's mercury, ethylmercury.

01:17:41.704 --> 01:17:46.445
There's no question that that can compromise the immune system.

01:17:47.025 --> 01:17:51.346
And so can you see how the script plays out then in 2025?

01:17:51.707 --> 01:17:53.707
There are no vaccines with thimerosal.

01:17:53.727 --> 01:17:56.628
There was only one flu vaccine and that's off the market too.

01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:09.985
And so the script is flawless because these people don't make progress, because their message doesn't make progress, because the script doesn't make progress.

01:18:10.105 --> 01:18:12.386
It's designed to collect people.

01:18:13.226 --> 01:18:22.590
It's designed to trap people in this false dichotomy of Mary Holland and Paul Offit, of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:28.372
and Tony Fauci, of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:31.774
or Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

01:18:33.034 --> 01:18:40.157
It's two ridiculous clowns with two ridiculous positions that are rooted in mythology.

01:18:41.598 --> 01:18:51.121
And the only, most ridiculous thing is that these people are really people that are making decisions and influencing the people around them.

01:18:51.181 --> 01:18:52.182
They are puppets.

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:57.584
They are actors, part of a national security apparatus show.

01:18:58.464 --> 01:19:02.507
And then he received the MMR vaccine, which is three live viruses simultaneously.

01:19:02.547 --> 01:19:05.709
And he, within a very short period, regressed precipitously.

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:07.250
Precipitous regression.

01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:08.431
At the age of?

01:19:08.491 --> 01:19:09.052
Two and a half.

01:19:09.972 --> 01:19:12.514
He got his vaccine slightly before that juncture.

01:19:13.235 --> 01:19:15.896
It's the only plausible explanation for what happened to him.

01:19:16.677 --> 01:19:19.319
He had EEGs that were abnormal.

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:21.040
He had epileptiform brain waves.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.602
This was all in very close temporal association.

01:19:23.662 --> 01:19:25.283
So then when I studied what do

01:19:25.663 --> 01:19:27.044
what does brain injury look like?

01:19:27.104 --> 01:19:30.846
And I've studied the federally funded vaccine injury compensation program.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:38.950
Lo and behold, encephalopathy, brain swelling, brain damage is a common side effect among side effects from vaccines, as is autism.

01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.130
That is covered up.

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.771
The federal government doesn't track it.

01:19:41.891 --> 01:19:43.452
So see where that pivoted?

01:19:44.716 --> 01:19:54.383
So actually she just admitted that she could have pursued compensation under the Vaccine Injury Safety Act, whatever it is called.

01:19:54.844 --> 01:20:03.470
She could have pursued it because encephalitis or brain swelling and inflammation is included in there.

01:20:05.132 --> 01:20:06.853
But then she went to autism.

01:20:08.494 --> 01:20:10.456
Did she say that her son had autism?

01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:13.043
She called it regressive autism.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:13.584
What did she call it?

01:20:13.604 --> 01:20:14.424
Do you see what I mean?

01:20:14.545 --> 01:20:24.072
Do you see how this, this is a, a script that they must to a certain extent, improvise through her son is pretty okay.

01:20:24.133 --> 01:20:36.603
Now he's made a larger cover, you know, like Pauly Tommy's son was cured by secretin so much so that she was on, she was in a newspaper saying that her son was cured by injections of secretin, that he was a new boy.

01:20:38.789 --> 01:20:52.527
And yet Polly Tommy owns land in America and land in the UK and has an autism home in the UK and has lots of, you know, it's pretty good, pretty good life.

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.884
They would say that there's no association.

01:21:01.244 --> 01:21:08.890
If you look at compensated cases of brain injury in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, you will see autism left, right and center.

01:21:09.371 --> 01:21:13.174
So I think what happened to my son is what I've heard happened to thousands of parents.

01:21:13.234 --> 01:21:14.435
I work in this area.

01:21:14.855 --> 01:21:16.397
It's not an atypical story.

01:21:16.537 --> 01:21:17.638
One story is an anecdote.

01:21:17.918 --> 01:21:20.400
What then should happen is there should be rigorous science.

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.202
That science hasn't been done.

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:24.391
Why do you think that science hasn't been done?

01:21:24.411 --> 01:21:25.972
I think that's a great question.

01:21:26.012 --> 01:21:28.934
I think that's a question I'd love to hear you put to Dr. Offit.

01:21:29.334 --> 01:21:30.935
He would say that that science has been done.

01:21:31.075 --> 01:21:35.078
One of the key scientists in the autism vaccine science is Paul Thorson.

01:21:35.298 --> 01:21:36.459
He's an indicted felon.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:37.560
He's in Denmark.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.622
The Department of Justice has done nothing to bring that man back.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:47.086
Another key question about the corruption is Dr. William Thompson in the CDC has come forward.

01:21:47.546 --> 01:21:54.970
Dr. William Thompson is the whistleblower for whom Brian Hooker supposedly drove across the United States in order to take his testimony.

01:21:55.511 --> 01:22:00.594
William Thompson is the guy who says that the vaccine schedule particularly hurts black boys.

01:22:01.674 --> 01:22:09.799
And it still could be something that they use as a, see, we told you so, or here's the truth or something like that to come.

01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:13.615
And so these cards have already been laid out.

01:22:13.655 --> 01:22:15.656
We've already seen them that they are in the deck.

01:22:16.076 --> 01:22:23.579
And they more importantly, they've been shuffled in repeatedly over the next 10 years from 2015 to where we are now.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.841
And it cannot be by accident that neither side has won the argument.

01:22:28.001 --> 01:22:30.182
It can't be, it's not possible.

01:22:30.302 --> 01:22:34.484
In fact, the evidence for the fact that they are both scripted

01:22:36.316 --> 01:22:58.787
actors, and that this is a script that these people are wittingly or unwittingly following as part of a national security operation, is the fact that the COVID vaccine is actually a transfection whose technology descends directly from the Human Genome Project, whose technology was made possible by it, and the only reason to ramp up

01:22:59.347 --> 01:23:06.033
the vaccine schedule in America, the way they have over the last 20 years, is part of this ridiculousness.

01:23:06.133 --> 01:23:21.565
That's the same reason why she is unable to say in 2015 or in 2025 that the vaccine schedule in America is unique in its quantity and frequency.

01:23:22.466 --> 01:23:27.390
Unique in a very disturbing way, especially in the first year of life.

01:23:28.444 --> 01:23:30.805
And she's not able to say that at all.

01:23:32.887 --> 01:23:54.460
Even though Rand Paul is able to say it in the video I showed you earlier from the same day, where he says that he delayed some of his vaccines, which is inevitably a biological truth that we know that if you're, if you're injecting things at day one through days, you know, 400, it's very different than injecting things at year 20.

01:23:57.383 --> 01:24:00.127
That's not a disputable biological fact.

01:24:00.187 --> 01:24:12.282
The only question is, is how is it possible that she's not, wasn't already there in 2015 and able to say it with enough precision to make her not look like a person who doesn't really know?

01:24:12.722 --> 01:24:15.065
She just wants somebody to find out.

01:24:16.949 --> 01:24:27.597
and said that he colluded with other key scientists to mask a signal that vaccines and autism are linked in African-American boys who got the MMR before age three, before age five.

01:24:28.017 --> 01:24:33.081
He's now been granted, according to one report, immunity and can testify in Congress.

01:24:33.261 --> 01:24:35.163
I hope to God we have that hearing.

01:24:35.483 --> 01:24:36.243
This is critical.

01:24:36.384 --> 01:24:38.205
One in 68 kids has autism.

01:24:38.485 --> 01:24:40.887
There's plausible science that there's a link.

01:24:41.047 --> 01:24:43.289
It needs to be followed up, not suppressed.

01:24:43.809 --> 01:24:48.551
Okay, so one in 68 in 2015, and now it's supposedly one in 30.

01:24:53.974 --> 01:24:56.855
And so again, you know, it's, this is the problem.

01:24:56.915 --> 01:25:09.682
It's a script and it's a script with built-in traps, built-in numerical and statistical traps, built-in diagnostics and precision language traps.

01:25:10.142 --> 01:25:10.982
And also, um,

01:25:13.052 --> 01:25:14.733
arguments that don't make any sense.

01:25:14.813 --> 01:25:18.135
Like, you know, the way to save kids from being poisoned.

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:22.577
Although now I guess, I don't know how much her son was really poisoned.

01:25:22.637 --> 01:25:24.178
Cause he's largely recovered.

01:25:24.258 --> 01:25:32.222
I don't get, I don't know, is to argue that everybody should have a choice or something like that.

01:25:32.522 --> 01:25:37.405
Instead of saying that, you know, baseball bat to the head in the first two months of the life is not that great.

01:25:40.288 --> 01:25:42.690
scientific study to you that makes a link.

01:25:53.619 --> 01:25:57.041
Uh, one is Ray Palmer's work showing environmental mercury.

01:25:57.302 --> 01:26:01.124
The closer somebody lives to the environmental source, the higher the rates of autism.

01:26:01.444 --> 01:26:02.405
Another is related.

01:26:02.565 --> 01:26:09.430
Oh, but environmental mercury is not intramuscular injection of thimerosal, but she just said a minute ago, it's thimerosal.

01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.432
So wait, it can also be mercury from the environment.

01:26:12.452 --> 01:26:23.219
So you're not really sure if it's thimerosal or not funny because that's exactly what Paul Offit's going to say that the mercury and thimerosal is very different than the mercury found in fish.

01:26:23.459 --> 01:26:23.641
Bye!

01:26:27.068 --> 01:26:28.088
It's just a joke.

01:26:28.908 --> 01:26:56.173
If you can't see that we were fooled by a more than one decade long bullshit show that includes Paul Offit, that includes Peter Hotez, that includes Peter Daszak, that includes all of Drastic, that includes all these podcasters like Joe Rogan and the Intellectual Dark Web, that includes all of these people like ICANN and CHD, and includes all of these people.

01:26:57.318 --> 01:27:05.926
that say that they are patriots, but actually joined up with this show during the pandemic, that America is truly lost.

01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:09.415
Correlation, correlation, correlation, correlation, she says.

01:27:09.435 --> 01:27:12.336
There's so many, there's just so many correlations.

01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:36.892
We need to look at the crash reports, the people in the vaccine injury compensation program.

01:27:37.232 --> 01:27:43.574
Just last year, in 2014, a child was compensated $500,000 because she died after getting the MMR.

01:27:43.794 --> 01:27:45.095
This is not controversial.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:50.916
So what should happen with the crisis of measles outbreak right now in this country?

01:27:51.036 --> 01:27:53.457
Are you opposed to children getting the MMR?

01:27:54.777 --> 01:27:55.878
I'm pro-choice, Amy.

01:27:55.918 --> 01:27:57.199
I'm not anti-vaccine.

01:27:57.459 --> 01:28:00.340
That label's thrown around as a way to marginalize people like me.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.981
I'm not anti-vaccine in the slightest.

01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:02.941
I'm pro-choice.

01:28:03.341 --> 01:28:05.582
I think parents have to make informed choices.

01:28:05.622 --> 01:28:07.623
That's the standard of ethical medicine.

01:28:07.903 --> 01:28:09.004
So what should happen right now?

01:28:09.424 --> 01:28:10.585
Well, look at your titers.

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:13.546
See if you need a measles vaccine if you think you should.

01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:14.346
I think in it.

01:28:14.486 --> 01:28:16.147
Look at your titers.

01:28:16.407 --> 01:28:24.732
She's such an expert on, on vaccination and an expert on, uh, immunology that she already knows that you need to look at your titers.

01:28:29.254 --> 01:28:30.055
It's a script.

01:28:31.235 --> 01:28:35.838
She doesn't need to know why the script was what it was back then.

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:40.260
She doesn't need to know what the planners of the script knew.

01:28:41.479 --> 01:28:48.082
But I guarantee you the people who scripted her, the people who scripted Paul Offit, they're all related to the same mentors.

01:28:48.822 --> 01:28:53.384
They're all related to the same mentors that are found in the book called

01:28:53.954 --> 01:28:55.576
man and his future.

01:28:55.636 --> 01:29:03.602
They're all related to the same mentors that read this book by Erwin Schrodinger, What is Life, Mind and Matter.

01:29:04.103 --> 01:29:15.813
They are all part of the same group of people that understands all of this from a multi-generational, we need to take control of the evolution of the species kind of narrative.

01:29:16.213 --> 01:29:21.018
And this woman is a willing participant in the governance of America like this.

01:29:21.798 --> 01:29:22.582
I guarantee it.

01:29:28.018 --> 01:29:29.739
I won't waste too much more time on that.

01:29:29.779 --> 01:29:31.480
Just let you know that this is also here.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.281
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:34.482
Hold on one second.

01:29:34.522 --> 01:29:36.243
That didn't work the way it was supposed to work.

01:29:36.443 --> 01:29:37.003
Here we go.

01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:37.644
What is this?

01:29:38.004 --> 01:29:38.984
Oh, it's not in there yet.

01:29:39.024 --> 01:29:39.765
Hold on one second.

01:29:39.785 --> 01:29:41.446
Give me a second, please.

01:29:42.326 --> 01:29:44.247
One second, please.

01:29:44.388 --> 01:29:46.349
We're just going to slap this in here really quick.

01:29:46.369 --> 01:29:48.430
We're going to change its orientation.

01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:49.671
Get this over here like this.

01:29:50.331 --> 01:29:50.731
Stop it.

01:29:51.472 --> 01:29:52.032
Stop it.

01:29:53.813 --> 01:29:54.994
Put this up like that.

01:29:55.234 --> 01:29:56.675
Put this down over here.

01:29:59.055 --> 01:30:01.637
Send it backward like this.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:02.777
There we go.

01:30:02.938 --> 01:30:04.038
Backwards some more.

01:30:04.118 --> 01:30:04.659
Where is it?

01:30:04.779 --> 01:30:06.460
And then we'll put this up here.

01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.680
Bring to the front.

01:30:09.962 --> 01:30:16.365
And playback should be automatically, but we've got to put that with this one and then remove that one.

01:30:16.505 --> 01:30:18.607
And then we go slideshow, current slide.

01:30:18.627 --> 01:30:18.847
Here we go.

01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:23.730
Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:34.974
I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, as we go to Philadelphia, where we're joined by Dr. Paul Offit, professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

01:30:35.374 --> 01:30:42.537
Dr. Offit is also professor of vaccinology and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

01:30:42.737 --> 01:31:00.532
also the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotatech, recommended for universal use in infants by the CDC, author of numerous books, including Autism's False Prophets, Bad Science, Risky Medicine and the Search for a Cure, and Deadly Choices, How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All.

01:31:00.992 --> 01:31:03.634
Well, Dr. Offit, you have heard our show today.

01:31:04.275 --> 01:31:07.518
Can you talk about why you feel vaccines are so important?

01:31:10.967 --> 01:31:12.888
Well, because they saved our lives.

01:31:13.069 --> 01:31:20.594
If you look at how long we lived, say 100 years ago, we lived 30 years less long then than we do today.

01:31:20.715 --> 01:31:23.437
So the reason, the main reason for that is vaccines.

01:31:23.837 --> 01:31:27.780
We no longer have to see 50,000 children hospitalized and 500 died.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:34.305
So it's funny that she didn't mention this book that he also wrote, Vaccinated, From Cowpox to mRNA.

01:31:35.766 --> 01:31:38.728
The Remarkable Story of Vaccines.

01:31:38.808 --> 01:31:46.253
So she didn't actually mention this book, even though this book was written in two, the hardcover edition was published in 2007.

01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:53.438
Paul Offit published a book in 2007, one year before, hold on, in 2007 called Vaccinated

01:32:01.704 --> 01:32:06.169
From cowpox to mRNA, the remarkable story of the vaccines.

01:32:06.249 --> 01:32:06.769
Look at this.

01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:12.976
And this is in 2015, and they didn't cite this book.

01:32:13.056 --> 01:32:14.578
Did they cite this book?

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:15.819
Did I make a mistake there?

01:32:15.859 --> 01:32:16.740
Did they cite this book?

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.401
die from measles every year as we did before the vaccine.

01:32:19.421 --> 01:32:23.083
We no longer have to see diphtheria as a common killer of teenagers.

01:32:23.103 --> 01:32:40.933
Today, can you talk about the rotavirus vaccine, Rotatech, recommended for universal use in infants by the CDC, author of numerous books, including Autism's False Prophets, Bad Science, Risky Medicine in the Search for a Cure, and Deadly Choices, How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All.

01:32:41.373 --> 01:32:42.174
Well, Dr. Offit,

01:32:42.574 --> 01:32:47.236
What in the Sam hell is this book doing in 2007 already?

01:32:47.856 --> 01:32:49.056
Written by Paul Offit.

01:32:51.697 --> 01:32:54.699
Is that even possible?

01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:55.259
2007 is what?

01:32:55.319 --> 01:33:00.221
A couple of years after the second time they announced that the Human Genome Project had been completed?

01:33:01.061 --> 01:33:03.622
The second time they celebrated it with a time cover?

01:33:05.419 --> 01:33:10.723
And now he's writing a book called Vaccinated, From Cowpox to mRNA, The Remarkable Stories of Vaccines.

01:33:11.163 --> 01:33:15.066
And now he's opposite Mary Holland, but they don't mention this one, they mention these two.

01:33:16.687 --> 01:33:19.089
Just curious, just gets curious.

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:24.132
The rotavirus vaccine is oral, of course it is.

01:33:24.953 --> 01:33:27.735
Of course it is, Mark, of course it is.

01:33:27.755 --> 01:33:29.196
You have heard our show today.

01:33:29.836 --> 01:33:33.099
Can you talk about why you feel vaccines are so important?

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.452
Well, because they saved our lives.

01:33:38.652 --> 01:33:46.158
If you look at how long we lived, say, 100 years ago, we lived 30 years less long then than we do today.

01:33:46.278 --> 01:33:48.700
So the main reason for that is vaccines.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.141
I got to say, I want to put my fingers in that hair.

01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:52.783
Look at how much body it has.

01:33:52.863 --> 01:33:53.844
Like, you just want to go.

01:33:55.905 --> 01:33:58.606
Wow, that's a beautiful head of hair.

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:05.348
We no longer have to see 50,000 children hospitalized and 500 die from measles every year as we did before the vaccine.

01:34:05.368 --> 01:34:09.029
We no longer have to see diphtheria as a common killer of teenagers.

01:34:09.089 --> 01:34:16.492
We no longer have to see 20,000 children suffer severe and permanent defects caused by rubella virus, so-called German measles virus.

01:34:16.532 --> 01:34:17.712
We no longer have to see

01:34:18.232 --> 01:34:30.961
children die or suffer permanent disability from bacterial meningitis from diseases like meningococcus, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae type A. Vaccines, I think, are the single best preventive measure that we've ever had.

01:34:30.981 --> 01:34:42.210
That's interesting that he mentions Hib there, because Hib was a nasty vaccine, which was actually a ditheriotoxin antigen tied to a very tiny part of the Hib

01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:45.851
Hib bacteria cell wall or some shit like that.

01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:48.691
So it was a nasty vaccine that was pulled from the market.

01:34:50.572 --> 01:34:52.612
And so it's an interesting thing for him to mention here.

01:34:52.652 --> 01:34:56.533
It's too much for this show, but anyway, just to let you know that I'm not completely off.

01:34:57.293 --> 01:35:03.274
The problem as clearly reflected by your previous caller is that we don't appreciate them.

01:35:03.334 --> 01:35:07.735
I think vaccines are a victim of their own success and they're obviously being blamed for things that they don't cause.

01:35:08.223 --> 01:35:14.486
Well, what about the issue of the connection between MMR and problems in children?

01:35:14.506 --> 01:35:24.270
Our last guest, Mary Holland, talked about her own son, who ended up with autism, and she feels there was a direct connection between MMR and autism.

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:42.172
Now, don't forget that in 2013, Brian Hooker, Mary Holland's colleague at Children's Health Defense currently, did not use the word autism to describe what happened to his son after vaccination, didn't like the word autism.

01:35:42.252 --> 01:35:46.356
His son was vaccine damaged, neurologically injured by toxicity.

01:35:46.916 --> 01:35:50.219
So it's interesting that Mary Holland here is very much

01:35:50.879 --> 01:36:01.991
represented as and accepting the idea that her son has some kind of regressive autism, which in 2025, apparently according to the Maha movement is now profound autism.

01:36:02.052 --> 01:36:02.832
Go ahead, Paul.

01:36:03.983 --> 01:36:09.566
I think it's perfectly reasonable for a parent to ask the question, my child was fine, they got a vaccine, then they weren't fine anymore.

01:36:09.686 --> 01:36:10.667
Could the vaccine have done it?

01:36:10.687 --> 01:36:11.107
And as Ms.

01:36:11.127 --> 01:36:15.690
Hollins argued, it is a temporal connection, but it's not a causal connection.

01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:26.316
I mean, there have now been 14 studies done looking at hundreds of thousands of children who either did or did not receive the MMR vaccine, and the results have been clear and consistent and reproducible.

01:36:26.876 --> 01:36:29.457
MMR vaccine does not increase your risk of autism.

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:35.539
All you do by choosing not to get an MMR vaccine is increase your risk of getting measles, mumps, or rubella.

01:36:35.799 --> 01:36:53.845
You know, what is upsetting to me about this, and I honestly think the last 10 minutes of your program set a new record for consecutive statements that were incorrect, is that when you do the science, when you do these excellent, retrospective, huge studies that answer the question that people don't believe them,

01:36:54.085 --> 01:36:54.865
And the reason Ms.

01:36:54.905 --> 01:36:57.167
Holla doesn't believe him is she's a conspiracy theorist.

01:36:57.427 --> 01:36:58.587
I mean, listen to what she says.

01:36:58.648 --> 01:37:02.730
There's this guy who was a fraud and then there's this whistleblower at the CDC.

01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:08.033
I mean, there are 14 studies on three continents involving hundreds of thousands of children.

01:37:08.453 --> 01:37:09.333
Is she claiming that?

01:37:09.553 --> 01:37:17.718
It is possible that there was a whistleblower at the CDC that instigated the whole, you know, promotion of Paul Offit and the promotion of Mary Holland.

01:37:18.198 --> 01:37:19.559
And all of that is possible.

01:37:19.639 --> 01:37:23.620
It's possible because Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism in 2013.

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:29.342
And Brian Hooker is the one who talked to this William Thompson guy.

01:37:29.723 --> 01:37:38.046
So it is remotely possible that at some point, a 16-year geneticist and transforming and transfecting plants to make medicines

01:37:38.706 --> 01:37:57.855
Brian Hooker actually had a vaccine-injured kid, didn't use the word autism, was trying to fight for truth, and got recruited into this two years later under the auspices of Mary Holland, and started using the word autism because he thought that he would accept this as this is the way forward.

01:37:57.875 --> 01:38:05.259
I mean, after all, she's gotten on TV, she's gotten on Democracy Now!, she's from Columbia Law University.

01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:07.960
Maybe she's got a better idea of how to do this than I do.

01:38:12.592 --> 01:38:19.374
It could very well easily be, ladies and gentlemen, that at one point in time Brian Hooker was a legit good guy.

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:26.105
If there is a massive international conspiracy to hide the truth, I think she is.

01:38:26.165 --> 01:38:29.887
And that's what makes her, to me, a classic anti-vaccine person.

01:38:30.067 --> 01:38:40.794
Well, what about the issue, for example, of the combined vaccine, the MMR, measles, mumps, rubella, the argument for separating them?

01:38:40.934 --> 01:38:43.215
And what was the—why were they put together?

01:38:43.355 --> 01:38:50.360
Talk about how vaccines came to be what they are and why they are mandated or not mandated in this country.

01:38:52.813 --> 01:39:02.264
Right, so the measles vaccine was developed in 1963, the mumps vaccine in 67, there was a second measles vaccine, the last best vaccine in 60... Notice that's not centuries ago.

01:39:03.955 --> 01:39:06.398
68, and then we had the rubella vaccine in 69.

01:39:06.518 --> 01:39:09.961
In 1971, those three vaccines were put together because you could.

01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:21.291
Because you could do it safely, as was proven, that when you combine those vaccines, that you didn't interfere with or change the safety profile or immunogenicity profile of those vaccines when they were given separately.

01:39:21.551 --> 01:39:23.894
So now you had to give one shot instead of three.

01:39:24.214 --> 01:39:25.395
Now we have a two-dose vaccine.

01:39:25.495 --> 01:39:31.178
interesting that at this time, it's pretty much one of the only subcutaneous vaccines on the list.

01:39:31.678 --> 01:39:39.283
Although it is allowed to give it intramuscularly, it is recommended or described primarily as a subcutaneous vaccine.

01:39:39.303 --> 01:39:45.826
And so again, the imprecision is found on both sides of the script by design.

01:39:45.906 --> 01:39:47.687
That's how you can see it's a script.

01:39:48.167 --> 01:39:52.410
If he wanted to win, his precision would progress across this decade.

01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.630
But

01:39:54.122 --> 01:39:54.663
It hasn't.

01:39:55.304 --> 01:40:04.356
If Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense or any of these people were on a legit path to victory, they would have progressed by now, but they haven't.

01:40:05.277 --> 01:40:07.761
And that's why you know it is not real.

01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:12.141
So that means you give two doses instead of six.

01:40:12.502 --> 01:40:21.230
There's no reason to separate those vaccines out because all you do by separating them out is increase the number of shots without in any way changing the safety profile.

01:40:21.630 --> 01:40:26.795
In terms of mandates, your question about mandates, I think you're starting to see why it is that mandates are so important.

01:40:27.535 --> 01:40:30.498
There is no good reason to choose not to get a vaccine.

01:40:30.698 --> 01:40:36.479
If you're choosing not to get a vaccine, then you're basing it on a misperception or a series of false beliefs, as Ms.

01:40:36.539 --> 01:40:37.939
Holland has about vaccines.

01:40:38.259 --> 01:40:41.920
She says, for example, that vaccines are never tested together.

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.320
Of course they're tested together.

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:52.302
You cannot put a new vaccine on the schedule without proving that your vaccine doesn't interfere with the safety and immunogenicity profile of existing vaccines and vice versa.

01:40:52.522 --> 01:40:54.162
Those are called concomitant use studies.

01:40:54.442 --> 01:40:54.642
Ms.

01:40:54.662 --> 01:40:58.723
Holland says that there have been no studies looking at sort of relatively

01:40:59.043 --> 01:41:00.404
Oh, what a great idea.

01:41:00.464 --> 01:41:01.704
We should have a gong.

01:41:01.784 --> 01:41:03.205
That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

01:41:03.245 --> 01:41:04.106
It would be wonderful.

01:41:04.186 --> 01:41:09.888
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I'm gonna play out the show right now so I can make it to the gym on time.

01:41:10.368 --> 01:41:11.889
It wasn't exactly what I had planned.

01:41:11.909 --> 01:41:17.192
I have like 30 more slides and two more videos, but I guess I'm getting out of touch with what it takes to do two hours.

01:41:17.712 --> 01:41:25.916
I apologize for being absent, but please understand that as I try to develop and progress in the sort of,

01:41:26.616 --> 01:41:34.924
the broadcasts that I do and pivot away from, you know, trying to save very many more people from this trap because the trap is basically closing now.

01:41:36.065 --> 01:41:44.994
And I move on to teaching the biology and the virology in a way that I think is more genuine and, and acknowledges the irreducible complexity in the background.

01:41:47.518 --> 01:41:49.100
It's going to take me some time to do it.

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.586
I'm doing a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of work behind the scenes.

01:41:53.666 --> 01:42:03.098
And so if you are at all, sort of, you know, want to know what we're doing here, this book was recently sent to me.

01:42:03.158 --> 01:42:04.900
It's an absolutely fabulous book.

01:42:05.821 --> 01:42:08.962
called A Symposium on the Chemical Basis of Heredity.

01:42:09.982 --> 01:42:17.224
Most importantly in the index, there are just some spectacular citations in the index of this book.

01:42:19.765 --> 01:42:21.945
And let me see if that's gonna do it.

01:42:22.005 --> 01:42:32.008
And then if I do this, and then if I do this, the index of this book is crazy because Julian Huxley's here,

01:42:33.148 --> 01:42:38.450
Francis Crick is here and, of course, Joshua Lederberg represented on many, many pages.

01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:47.013
And so you can imagine that this book, not being very thin, is quite a challenge to try and digest.

01:42:48.113 --> 01:42:49.553
And so it's slow progress.

01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:50.614
Whoops, wrong camera.

01:42:50.954 --> 01:43:00.597
It's slow progress, especially because I have amazing supporters and viewers who occasionally send some crazy

01:43:01.357 --> 01:43:02.358
books my way.

01:43:02.438 --> 01:43:11.105
This is called A Symposium on the Chemical Basis of Heredity, edited by William McElroy and Bentley Glass.

01:43:11.225 --> 01:43:13.446
I'll just try and do a quick cut over here.

01:43:13.486 --> 01:43:14.427
I don't know if that'll work.

01:43:14.787 --> 01:43:15.848
I might have to blank it out.

01:43:17.309 --> 01:43:19.131
That might help you a little bit there, Christy.

01:43:21.332 --> 01:43:22.853
And yeah, it's a neat book.

01:43:23.514 --> 01:43:24.555
I'm very happy about it.

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:36.054
I'm also going to start taking some of these PDFs that Mark is producing and also mirroring them on my website, including this book, Hypodermic Injections.

01:43:36.154 --> 01:43:37.075
It's a wonderful book.

01:43:37.115 --> 01:43:42.262
I'm going to start reading it, I think, this week as part of Biology 101 because it's really just shocking.

01:43:43.122 --> 01:43:44.824
You can really hear it.

01:43:44.884 --> 01:43:50.568
And incidentally, I also have a German version of this book, which also kind of puts forward the idea.

01:43:50.588 --> 01:43:53.990
Let me see how I cut over here really quick.

01:43:56.612 --> 01:43:58.633
And cut, yes.

01:43:58.673 --> 01:44:11.803
Puts forward the idea that really, we didn't have the requisite knowledge to understand how preposterous it was that we were gonna start putting stuff in us using hypodermic needles all under the pretense that it didn't seem to hurt.

01:44:12.803 --> 01:44:17.387
And you might think that I'm going short through the corner there, but I'm really actually not.

01:44:18.388 --> 01:44:21.771
Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Offit is a meddler.

01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:24.233
That's the best that I can characterize him.

01:44:25.194 --> 01:44:28.917
He is a meddler, and I'm going to try and play you out with one of the songs.

01:44:28.977 --> 01:44:30.858
I discovered this song, I didn't know it.

01:44:31.559 --> 01:44:42.202
I'd never heard it before, and I was watching a BBC special of Joni, and the BBC special ended with this show, and it's a song, and it's just a spectacular song.

01:44:42.783 --> 01:44:44.263
So I want to leave you with this song.

01:44:44.303 --> 01:44:47.144
If you're already familiar with it, of course, you're like, oh yeah, dodgy.

01:44:47.784 --> 01:44:49.085
But for me, it's new.

01:44:50.045 --> 01:44:55.667
And since it's new, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and do.

01:44:56.827 --> 01:44:58.708
Thanks for being here, and I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:45:10.573 --> 01:45:27.959
Rows and flows of angel hair And ice cream castles in the air And feather canyons everywhere I've looked at clouds that weep

01:45:34.502 --> 01:45:47.415
They rain and snow on everyone So many things I would have done But clouds got in my way

01:45:50.037 --> 01:46:02.422
I've looked at clouds from both sides now and up and down and still somehow it's cloud illusions.

01:46:02.702 --> 01:46:09.404
I recall I really don't know clouds at all.

01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:56.247
feel as every fairy tale comes real i've looked at love that way but now it's just another show you leave them laughing when you go and if you care don't let them know don't give

01:47:01.244 --> 01:47:19.909
I've looked at love from both sides now, from give and take And still somehow it's love's illusions I recall I really don't know love at all

01:47:33.205 --> 01:47:48.818
Tears and fears and feeling proud Just say I love you right out loud Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I've looked at life that way

01:47:52.509 --> 01:48:06.822
but now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads they say i've changed well something's lost but something's gained

01:48:12.501 --> 01:48:26.191
I've looked at life from both sides now, then win and lose, and still somehow it's life's illusions I recall.

01:48:26.691 --> 01:48:29.833
I really don't know life.

01:48:44.287 --> 01:48:59.198
I've looked at life from both sides now, from up and down And still somehow it's life's illusions I recall I really don't know life at all

01:49:27.813 --> 01:49:28.523
you
