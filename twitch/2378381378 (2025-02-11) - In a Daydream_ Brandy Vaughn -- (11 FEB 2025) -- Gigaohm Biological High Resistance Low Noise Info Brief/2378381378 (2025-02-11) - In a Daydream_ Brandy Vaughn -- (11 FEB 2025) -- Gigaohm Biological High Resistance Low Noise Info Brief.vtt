00:45.031 --> 00:45.131
Beep.

01:02.725 --> 01:03.805
Hello, everybody.

01:03.945 --> 01:04.606
Hello.

01:05.026 --> 01:07.527
Atari Mama is number one today at 1015.

01:08.127 --> 01:09.548
I'm a little tiny bit late.

01:09.568 --> 01:12.309
Howard the Duck, garden variety human.

01:12.509 --> 01:16.250
Arthur, I am Katniss.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.691
Good to see you guys this morning.

01:19.692 --> 01:25.494
The basketball season has ended, and the offseason has started.

01:25.514 --> 01:29.216
And I'm very, very excited to be here on the 11th of February, 2025.

01:29.256 --> 01:29.976
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

01:33.061 --> 01:40.907
I am a recovering academic biologist, trying to find my way in this weird world like you are.

01:41.127 --> 01:43.989
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

01:44.009 --> 01:54.776
If you want to see the stain of my work as an academic and as an academagician, you can search my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, and my initials J-N-J.

01:55.477 --> 01:56.678
Thank you very much for being here.

01:57.438 --> 01:58.979
I'll see you in a few minutes.

02:21.170 --> 02:31.319
By about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.643
the greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

02:37.584 --> 02:40.767
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:41.247 --> 02:43.028
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:45.050 --> 02:45.811
Isolation, what was it?

02:45.951 --> 02:47.172
Isolation and purification.

02:48.893 --> 02:49.633
Of the virus?

02:49.713 --> 02:49.914
Yes.

02:51.175 --> 02:52.936
Well, you isolate a virus by

02:59.736 --> 03:02.198
finding the virus which causes a disease.

03:02.859 --> 03:07.743
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

03:08.524 --> 03:10.866
I don't understand what the issue is.

03:11.066 --> 03:18.352
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

03:18.813 --> 03:20.074
Okay.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.656
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

03:25.182 --> 03:27.143
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

03:27.203 --> 03:33.227
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:33.327 --> 03:35.388
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:39.651 --> 03:42.052
Just, it's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

03:42.072 --> 03:44.954
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.375
It's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

03:46.395 --> 03:49.437
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:49.457 --> 03:50.938
It's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

03:52.529 --> 03:54.030
But you can tell if someone's lying.

03:54.691 --> 03:56.452
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:58.253 --> 03:58.973
And I have lied.

03:59.153 --> 04:00.034
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:00.054 --> 04:00.975
I don't want to lie.

04:01.455 --> 04:02.796
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:02.916 --> 04:03.957
I try not to be a liar.

04:03.977 --> 04:04.817
I don't want to be a liar.

04:05.398 --> 04:08.159
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

04:10.861 --> 04:12.422
I think truth is good for kids.

04:12.842 --> 04:16.625
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:17.145 --> 04:18.786
We want everybody to feel good.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.868
That's not the way life is.

04:24.838 --> 04:33.542
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

04:34.623 --> 04:37.825
It's measles plus.

04:37.945 --> 04:43.447
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

04:43.748 --> 04:45.709
It's just a big hassle in the end.

04:48.854 --> 05:02.062
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

05:02.122 --> 05:04.663
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

05:05.264 --> 05:10.227
And this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another.

05:15.322 --> 05:18.403
But I don't think it's obvious that what you're doing is wrong.

05:18.824 --> 05:20.885
It's obvious that it's really complicated.

05:21.625 --> 05:40.874
And so my response to this is to suspend judgment for six months from now, fearing as I do the loss of civil liberties and being wary as I am about what it means for how we're going to handle infectious disease in the future.

05:46.627 --> 05:48.728
I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to.

05:50.229 --> 05:53.930
So that's the best I can do with that.

05:54.030 --> 05:57.992
I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic.

05:58.792 --> 06:03.114
It affected me and my family in the same way it affects everyone else.

06:03.614 --> 06:10.716
It throws us into psychological disarray in all the same ways and brings up all the same moral questions.

06:10.776 --> 06:13.097
And I wish I had a better answer, but I don't.

06:15.410 --> 06:16.730
I mean, I've got the vaccine.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.071
So that's a partial answer on my part.

06:21.211 --> 06:26.192
But I understand the position of those who don't want to take it.

06:26.933 --> 06:32.694
And I would be unwilling to compel them by force, that's for sure, because that's not the right approach.

06:33.174 --> 06:37.855
Although I would encourage people to get the damn vaccine and let's get the hell over this.

06:38.395 --> 06:39.115
But I did that.

06:39.175 --> 06:40.916
I put my body on the line to do it.

06:41.809 --> 06:42.731
That's my decision.

06:42.891 --> 06:43.933
I'm not saying it's right.

06:44.073 --> 06:45.395
It's what I decided to do.

06:48.981 --> 06:50.724
So give yourself a break.

06:50.764 --> 06:54.510
Of course, you have moral qualms, and you should, and so should all of us.

06:55.353 --> 07:00.595
You know, I guess I would close that by saying, but let's not forget we did a pretty damn good job of dealing with this so far.

07:00.635 --> 07:03.536
I mean, it looks like a mess on the ground, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.076
And I'm really amazed that it wasn't.

07:05.876 --> 07:08.597
I know the cards haven't all fallen into play yet.

07:09.617 --> 07:14.279
And who knows, maybe one thing it could do is alert us to the presence of our real enemy.

07:15.216 --> 07:21.379
You know, because we have lots of proximal enemies, and they tend to be other people, but we have a real enemy, and that tends to be infectious disease.

07:21.840 --> 07:27.163
And AIDS didn't quite teach us that, and the pandemic probably wouldn't either, but it would be a good thing to learn.

07:27.583 --> 07:35.367
You know, maybe we could aim our future selves at an increasingly disease-free society for everyone in the world.

07:35.407 --> 07:37.708
And that's the other thing, it has to be for everyone, right?

07:37.888 --> 07:41.130
Because we're all the same body, as it turns out.

07:44.013 --> 07:53.084
getting a handle on infectious disease around the world, that's an unwarranted good, and it might have extremely beneficial effects politically too, especially if Randy Thornhill is right.

07:54.246 --> 08:01.074
The worst of tyrannical authoritarianism is driven by concerns that arise as a consequence of infectious disease prevalence.

08:01.335 --> 08:02.757
It's a radical hypothesis.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.038
Maybe it's true.

08:04.178 --> 08:17.847
And so if we got rid of infectious disease to the degree that we could, if we made that public enemy number one, we might simultaneously be doing the best possible thing to limit the attractiveness of totalitarian ideology.

08:17.867 --> 08:25.072
I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked.

08:25.392 --> 08:32.377
And I should point out that actually we are, in an interesting sense, a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar.

08:33.109 --> 08:36.470
So if I'm correct, you, Robert, have had COVID.

08:36.690 --> 08:39.551
I've had COVID, and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna.

08:39.771 --> 08:40.111
All right.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.792
Steve, you have been vaccinated.

08:42.812 --> 08:44.052
Stop lying!

08:44.112 --> 08:45.433
Fully vaccinated with Moderna.

08:45.733 --> 08:46.053
All right.

08:46.173 --> 08:46.533
Stop lying!

08:46.613 --> 08:49.334
I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin.

08:49.734 --> 09:00.443
And the data actually, shocking as this will be to some people, the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting COVID-19.

09:02.065 --> 09:12.073
So aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't real, and I have every reason to think it was, it certainly appears to be the genuine article,

09:12.937 --> 09:25.727
I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity, where through three different routes, COVID, vaccine, and ivermectin, we are protected, and you are doubly protected.

09:25.767 --> 09:40.178
So I would just say that for anybody who's enthusiastic about the vaccines, if you're unconvinced by what we have to say about the hazard of them, one thing to consider is that the way to get society to herd immunity and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction, which ought to be our goal,

09:40.678 --> 09:49.883
The way to do it is to get people into this category one way or the other, whether that's through prophylaxis, whether it's through a vaccine, or whether it's because they've had COVID already.

09:51.344 --> 09:55.266
One could argue that if everybody just took ivermectin for a month,

09:56.781 --> 09:57.361
worldwide.

09:58.042 --> 09:59.002
We need to end the pandemic.

09:59.902 --> 10:03.784
Some will find the title that I have given this episode perplexing.

10:04.484 --> 10:10.547
I would ask them to stick with the episode through the end and I will explain why I titled it as I did.

10:10.567 --> 10:23.093
I really believe that actually we have the capacity at any moment we decide to utilize it to end the pandemic and that it is well within reach should we choose to see what is in front of us.

10:26.533 --> 10:45.056
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

10:45.076 --> 10:54.638
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

10:57.875 --> 11:12.941
And I also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooey, who some of you will know from his lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a Bike, Journal Club on a Bike, that he also has advanced a version of this hypothesis.

11:12.981 --> 11:14.322
So I don't claim it to be unique.

11:14.482 --> 11:16.343
I do think I arrived at it independently.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.282
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

11:23.362 --> 11:28.664
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

11:29.524 --> 11:36.267
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

11:39.042 --> 11:40.943
vaccine, if you think about it.

11:40.963 --> 11:45.945
You know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

11:46.365 --> 11:49.406
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

11:49.486 --> 11:58.930
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

11:58.950 --> 12:05.553
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

12:08.210 --> 12:10.131
I don't care how you get there.

12:10.231 --> 12:13.313
I don't care what you do to get there.

12:13.593 --> 12:16.014
The goal is to win.

12:40.362 --> 12:41.263
What time is it?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.124
Game time!

12:42.184 --> 12:42.345
Woo!

17:39.750 --> 17:54.189
yes you remember that correctly i did do a show with mackis mackis was on my show actually i interviewed him with a wall of skulls behind him ladies and gentlemen intramuscular injection is dumb transfection was always a crime and rna cannot pandemic

17:55.143 --> 17:58.226
And basically that algebra adds up to the U.S.

17:58.427 --> 18:01.570
vaccine schedule being a criminal enterprise.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.092
Thank you very much for being here.

18:03.112 --> 18:06.836
I really appreciate everybody having the patience.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.479
This is GigaOM Biologically.

18:09.559 --> 18:12.962
High resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:13.803 --> 18:16.044
That biologist is Jonathan Cooey.

18:16.064 --> 18:16.525
That's me.

18:16.565 --> 18:16.945
Hello.

18:17.025 --> 18:18.206
I hope I'm in focus here.

18:18.226 --> 18:19.526
Let me push this button once.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.048
It's great to see everybody.

18:22.068 --> 18:25.310
It is the 11th of February.

18:25.370 --> 18:25.970
Is that right?

18:26.030 --> 18:26.290
Yeah.

18:26.330 --> 18:26.690
Wow.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.211
Gee whiz.

18:28.331 --> 18:29.192
Time is flying.

18:29.772 --> 18:31.253
Basketball season is over.

18:31.833 --> 18:38.077
I wanted to share a very brief story just because it's kind of fun to start with a little story.

18:39.937 --> 18:47.120
The basketball season that I envisioned that I would have as a 7b coach did not manifest.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.782
We lost a lot of games, in fact all of our games.

18:52.562 --> 18:58.164
We had a couple games that were close for a few quarters and then in the fourth quarter we kind of lost it.

19:00.765 --> 19:06.928
It's a 7b team so technically everybody has to play at least six minutes a game and so

19:08.925 --> 19:12.747
Because we have varied skill levels or had varied skill levels on our team, it was tough.

19:13.327 --> 19:18.710
But the boys really started to come together at the end of the season, and it was really exciting.

19:20.231 --> 19:26.714
One of the local rival schools here, we put up a really good game, our second to the last of the season.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.956
We were ahead at halftime.

19:30.116 --> 19:31.697
We were tied at the third quarter.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.477
at the end of the third quarter, and then we just lost it.

19:35.278 --> 19:36.359
And it's great.

19:36.399 --> 19:37.200
It was a good game.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.343
The kids were extremely disappointed, of course.

19:40.464 --> 19:48.332
But the last week of the season, we were supposed to play the worst team in our league that we didn't play yet.

19:49.373 --> 19:53.235
So we had been, you know, getting beat handily by everybody except for a couple teams.

19:54.595 --> 19:57.717
And we didn't get a shot, two shots at a couple of those teams.

19:57.777 --> 20:11.983
And one of them, the worst team in our division besides ourselves, who up until the eighth game had only, had not won any games and was putting up the same amount of points as us, giving up the same amount of points as us.

20:12.683 --> 20:16.204
Their pattern kind of changed and they beat somebody that beat us pretty bad.

20:16.224 --> 20:17.385
And we were like, well, what happened?

20:18.846 --> 20:46.254
And so we got close to this past weekend and I got a phone call from their coach or a coach from that same township and Just an absolutely awful story The coach of that 7b team passed away died or killed in a car accident or I wasn't given very many details but I know that he was a three-sport coach and him dying was not in the plan and

20:47.755 --> 20:55.440
And so probably what happened was they took some kids from the 7A and brought them down to 7B because some of the kids didn't play.

20:56.781 --> 21:03.547
I don't know what happened, but anyway, they shuffled the teams around a little bit because the 7A team from that township was also O-ing something.

21:04.227 --> 21:13.431
And so with 7A and 7B both 0 and something and then this tragedy happening, I think they shuffled some kids around and the B team started to win.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.913
And he was the B team coach, as I understand it.

21:16.953 --> 21:21.775
So we didn't really understand all of this had happened until after the game.

21:22.475 --> 21:27.638
We went into this game thinking that it was going to be a game against the one team that we had a chance to beat.

21:28.258 --> 21:34.541
We were pretty hopeful and we knew that they were going to do some kind of ceremony beforehand, you know, like a moment of silence or something.

21:35.302 --> 21:42.285
Well, being the extremely naive coach that I am, we just kind of went and I told the kids, you know, there's gonna be a moment of silence.

21:42.305 --> 21:42.806
Don't worry about it.

21:42.826 --> 21:43.506
And then we'll just play.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.226
And it was a gym full of people wearing matching t-shirts.

21:49.727 --> 21:51.610
It was like a Hoosiers game.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.814
You know, the movie Hoosiers, but we were the visiting team.

21:55.652 --> 22:04.695
And so our seven or eight parents that made the drive there sat up in the corner, and the rest of the gym was full of people that were there.

22:04.795 --> 22:10.877
Some of them were watching the game, some of them that weren't, which means that there was this general roar of talking.

22:11.637 --> 22:22.061
Plus, on top of that, the people that were watching the game were all cheering against my boys, who, again, are the worst team by record, at least in the whole,

22:23.061 --> 22:23.722
arrangement.

22:23.762 --> 22:26.124
And so it was really hard for my boys.

22:26.164 --> 22:36.134
I mean, at times when we would make turnovers, some of the crowd would laugh and it was very, well, it was just very hard for me to do as a coach.

22:36.274 --> 22:39.658
I got in an argument with the ref, which I never do.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.902
But I got in an argument with him because I was commenting about

22:44.614 --> 22:53.018
about what was happening in the game and asking him to make calls and his response to me was something like, I'm not surprised you don't understand the rules.

22:55.919 --> 23:00.942
Which anyway, it was just an awful experience and I understand what

23:01.798 --> 23:02.458
happened there.

23:02.498 --> 23:03.818
I understand that somebody died.

23:03.858 --> 23:05.359
I'm not complaining or anything like that.

23:05.399 --> 23:08.339
But my boys really walked into a woodchipper.

23:08.379 --> 23:16.101
They had no idea that it was going to be this thing where, you know, every single point was going to be cheered like it was a championship point.

23:17.922 --> 23:26.483
And then to top that all off, a couple, three of the boys that we were playing against were probably as good as anybody we had come against all season.

23:26.503 --> 23:28.284
And so it really didn't make sense.

23:29.682 --> 23:32.663
And so it was a tough way to end the season, I'll be really honest with you.

23:32.683 --> 23:43.467
For me, because I had been keeping up hope that, you know, at the end of the season we were going to play this team that seemed to be the one team that kind of had our same problem, you know, lots of new kids or whatever.

23:44.808 --> 23:50.190
So anyway, the season's over with and my first season as a basketball coach is 0-12.

23:50.230 --> 23:50.530
So, you know,

23:53.237 --> 23:54.338
For what it's worth.

23:54.598 --> 24:13.433
I guess I'm probably a better biologist, but we'll see I'm working really hard to get myself into better shape for JC on the hardwood because I think that's a great way for me to move forward on YouTube And in the meantime, we're just gonna keep doing this because I still think this works needs to be done Anyway, so thanks for joining me.

24:13.993 --> 24:20.578
Let me move myself down here in the corner and then

24:22.780 --> 24:25.301
We can get started with this little lecture here.

24:25.341 --> 24:29.422
So it is the 11th of February 2025.

24:30.843 --> 24:32.103
Which one am I using here?

24:32.123 --> 24:33.084
Am I using that one?

24:33.444 --> 24:34.644
Is this one also on?

24:35.504 --> 24:37.765
Just let me make sure that this is all set up correct.

24:38.385 --> 24:42.087
I apologize for the technical aspects of the show.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.387
That must be better.

24:43.487 --> 24:45.048
I should have that one at A though.

24:45.988 --> 24:46.608
There we go.

24:46.788 --> 24:48.469
And then I'll put myself there.

24:49.608 --> 24:51.069
Yeah, so welcome to the show, let's get going.

24:51.089 --> 24:54.933
Biological high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

24:54.973 --> 24:56.534
That's me, Jonathan Cooey.

24:57.615 --> 25:03.200
We are here in what appears to be a continual sort of

25:04.523 --> 25:06.825
slow roll to the truth.

25:06.865 --> 25:18.136
That's the reason why you've never seen a chart like this for the American data with all the years and all of the deaths and so that you could put the pandemic into context.

25:18.176 --> 25:19.338
No one's ever shown you this.

25:20.441 --> 25:24.264
Jessica Rose doesn't show you this to try and explain to you what's going on.

25:24.605 --> 25:38.938
Robert Malone or Brett Weinstein don't use graphs to teach you or show you what's going on to try and coach you into understanding a little bit more the nuance of this extraordinary myth that they've told us.

25:39.994 --> 25:55.720
And of course, that's the reason, because when the data is displayed correctly, and I move my head out of the way, you can see, for example, in red, if you can see my mouse here, you can see that in red, we've had pneumonia under control for quite some time.

25:55.760 --> 26:00.542
And then in 2020, we seem to have lost control of pneumonia for about two years.

26:01.022 --> 26:03.263
And then we got it right back under control again.

26:03.323 --> 26:04.083
Isn't that weird?

26:05.143 --> 26:07.645
Isn't it weird that nobody's really shown you that?

26:07.725 --> 26:14.530
Not one doctor has said it's really odd that we've had pneumonia in red under control for decades.

26:14.690 --> 26:25.719
And then at the start of the pandemic, it seems like we pretty much lost control of pneumonia, which is traditionally attributed to bacterial causes.

26:28.961 --> 26:30.943
And so these are the kinds of things that with

26:32.017 --> 26:40.462
just the data and just the right time horizon, you can make quite a statement about what in the hell happened there.

26:41.423 --> 26:42.043
What is that?

26:43.204 --> 26:53.670
But of course, nobody that's doing this kind of stuff from the biology perspective is ever going to show you the graph as it stands with CDC's own numbers.

26:54.471 --> 26:54.971
Why would they?

26:59.116 --> 27:01.278
It's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.120
They would never show you everything.

27:03.161 --> 27:04.882
The truth is not available on TV.

27:04.943 --> 27:06.304
It hasn't been for decades.

27:06.364 --> 27:12.010
Ladies and gentlemen, just a very quick, short through the corner explanation for what I think happened.

27:12.631 --> 27:17.717
A very hot background of RNA and DNA from every source imaginable.

27:18.823 --> 27:23.166
was misconstrued as evidence of spread using nonspecific PCR tests.

27:24.027 --> 27:40.739
If they wanted to find the particular spike protein that this story is based upon, the easiest way to explain its finding would be to make a lot of it in the form of a DNA and then put that DNA somewhere and claim to have found it.

27:40.819 --> 27:47.404
Now, that's the easiest way to do it, because remember, the spike protein cannot be found by PCR.

27:48.430 --> 27:53.235
we are finding spike protein RNA or spike protein DNA.

27:53.715 --> 28:03.065
And the only reason why you might think it's RNA is because they use a reverse transcriptase step before they start the PCR reaction, which can only work on DNA.

28:04.587 --> 28:11.714
And so one of the huge assumptions that everybody makes is that that reverse transcriptase step is even needed.

28:13.117 --> 28:20.501
There's no step where they do a DNA only and then a DNA plus the reverse transcriptase product.

28:21.361 --> 28:31.347
And so you will never ever could have ever known if it's a DNA signal or an RNA signal when they use the proprietary tests that they used.

28:32.099 --> 28:46.526
And more importantly, if they put the DNA signal there, wherever they wanted to find it, they would have found it, especially if their agent in Wuhan paid by USAID and Peter Daszak and NIAID was told to find it.

28:47.509 --> 29:04.537
Very easy story that converts a infinite background into a specific signal with proprietary tests that none of us can investigate because anyone that's ever tried to take one of these testing firms to trial in any way is not able to get past the proprietary excuse.

29:05.618 --> 29:12.501
That's the reason why you can't see their protocols, you can't find them, and why the stuff that they submitted to the FDA is so pathetic.

29:13.663 --> 29:20.170
And that's why all the people that are saying that COVID shots are bad don't want to talk about 2020 and 2021.

29:20.230 --> 29:26.797
Because if you go back to the picture, 2020, 2021 is where the murder happened.

29:27.798 --> 29:30.261
The murder is basically over by the start of 2022.

29:32.639 --> 29:44.162
And that is a key element to understand how this game is being played, why the clock needed to be run out, and why these people don't want to talk about 2020 and 2021, because that's where all the murder happened.

29:48.063 --> 29:53.324
And so using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

29:53.344 --> 30:02.046
And the way they took this countermeasure thing under their control was to make sure they rolled out enough placebos so that they had plenty of doses.

30:07.526 --> 30:10.147
and the safety signal would never be seen.

30:11.128 --> 30:22.533
Now we've got to come to some realization here, ladies and gentlemen, in 2025, that the overclass places highly trained acolytes on social media to manipulate our habits and opinions.

30:22.573 --> 30:23.294
They place them.

30:24.174 --> 30:36.180
They place them as newscasters, as MSNBC nightly show havers, as late night talk show hosts, as podcasters, like Joe Rogan.

30:36.846 --> 30:40.911
and the intellectual dark web that I illustrated in the introduction.

30:42.172 --> 30:54.066
Those people were put in place to control our habits and opinions and to manipulate the questions that we were interested in and the answers that we considered in order to trick us into believing things.

30:55.891 --> 31:03.259
Some of them are innocuous, like buying pasta from Italy or submitting your genetic material to 23andMe.

31:03.299 --> 31:08.965
But others of them, like mythologies about how RNA can pandemic, are much more malevolent.

31:11.688 --> 31:17.595
And so they've gotten us to believe in a novel virus by using PCR as a diagnostic tool, and that's a fraud.

31:18.626 --> 31:30.709
They've gotten us to believe in a novel virus by two years of murder that included using pure oxygen in an irresponsible way to generate symptoms that were misconstrued as COVID, A-R-D-S.

31:31.530 --> 31:42.693
And any emergency room and ICU physician worth their salt would know that already because there's a huge number of papers studying this since the late 90s.

31:46.021 --> 32:10.957
Maybe that's one of the reasons why Paul Merrick and Pierre Cory were so important to get together and to get focused on ivermectin and vitamin C and stuff like that, because, oh my goodness, if these two outspoken ICU doctors were to tell you the truth about what oxygen did in 2020 and 2021 in hospitals where all the deaths occurred, according to Denny Rancourt and many others,

32:13.186 --> 32:22.271
then not using antibiotics for pneumonia is a crime because if you give these people ARDS, if they develop pneumonia and then you call it a viral pneumonia and don't give them antibiotics, that's murder.

32:25.552 --> 32:40.400
If they develop a urinary tract infection, if they starve, if they die of thirst, if they die of kidney failure from a combination of mishandling and also, you know, just neglect, it's all murder.

32:42.196 --> 32:48.961
because it's done under the pretense of a novel virus panic that was created by coordinated liars, then it becomes murder.

32:50.743 --> 32:56.627
And because the people behind this are competent physicians, irrespective of what they are told.

32:58.329 --> 33:02.892
If the CDC gives them an inappropriate protocol for their patients,

33:05.546 --> 33:11.111
I think it's safe to say that they should notice that it's not safe for their patients and not follow the protocol.

33:11.151 --> 33:14.574
And if they don't, then it's on them.

33:15.835 --> 33:20.159
And I don't care how young they are or how old they are or how inexperienced they are.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.342
They had an obligation to know.

33:26.345 --> 33:29.108
Stupid Nazi soldiers are still stupid.

33:30.233 --> 33:38.153
And at some point in time, we're going to have to come around to the fact that so many of our doctors are complicit and therefore essentially guilty.

33:41.294 --> 33:48.502
And they need to realize this so that they start to introspectively try to figure out how it is that they got there.

33:49.182 --> 33:50.724
Who didn't point out to them?

33:51.084 --> 33:52.606
Who else on their team?

33:52.926 --> 33:54.188
Who else on their staff?

33:54.528 --> 33:57.511
Who in their administration told them to use pure oxygen?

33:57.571 --> 33:59.173
Who told them to use ventilators?

33:59.193 --> 34:00.734
Who told them to isolate people?

34:01.155 --> 34:03.637
Who told them to do these things that kill people?

34:04.278 --> 34:15.566
If they realize that they should have known better, then they will start to think who else in their lives should have known better, in their professional lives should have known better, and the illusion will start to break.

34:16.046 --> 34:25.613
Mary Talley Bowden, who was on my show in 2021, needs to realize this, that ARDS created in hospitals is not COVID, it's murder.

34:27.628 --> 34:31.010
And she is a respiratory physiologist, should have figured this out by now.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.331
Pierre Corey should have figured this out by now.

34:33.411 --> 34:38.493
Robert Malone has never treated a patient in his life, so maybe he has an excuse for not figuring this out right now.

34:38.873 --> 34:44.436
But every doctor that's involved in this should have figured it out by now because we've been saying it for more than a year.

34:46.537 --> 34:51.219
Actually, thanks to Jessica Hockett who burnt the bridge between us because of it, I think.

34:54.264 --> 35:12.417
And so this was all accomplished, this steady stream of PCR remnants, these PCR products that detect 17 viruses or 18 targets that's being deployed in all of our corporate hospitals to create a remnant stream that they can get genetic data from.

35:12.997 --> 35:23.645
This remnant stream that pillaged our universities for two and a half years to the detriment of all of our young people's privacy and sovereignty,

35:25.080 --> 35:42.305
This was all provided to you by Team Worst Case Scenario because none of these people, Malone, NAS, CHD, ICANN, have usefully questioned the foundation of the pandemic, which is the COVID, the strange thing, the new virus, the thing we're all vulnerable to.

35:42.365 --> 35:43.165
That was my stomach.

35:44.704 --> 35:51.026
That's really what we're dealing with here because that is also the false narrative of the no virus people.

35:51.127 --> 35:53.928
It'll just be over if you realize that there's no virus.

35:55.048 --> 35:56.629
No, that's not how this works.

36:00.710 --> 36:12.455
This is a terrible trap, ladies and gentlemen, and Team Worst Case Scenario is the best way, in my humble opinion, to think about it because they're a coordinated chorus that harmonizes

36:13.681 --> 36:21.528
Even the no virus people were very, very, very good at working with these people on team Robert Malone.

36:22.069 --> 36:26.693
Otherwise, how is it possible that the videos I showed you in the introduction even exist?

36:27.794 --> 36:37.803
The only time that those five people have gotten together to address the ideas of someone is for me, both times.

36:39.235 --> 36:54.185
with CHD, with Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Tess Laurie, and Jessica Rose, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the soon-to-be Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America, got together on a Zoom meeting to discuss my ideas in 2022.

36:54.786 --> 37:06.614
And in that same year, the five no-virus people, without me, got together to discuss my ideas, to dismiss them, to ridicule me,

37:09.019 --> 37:10.740
It's not happened for Jessica Rose.

37:11.821 --> 37:21.028
They haven't done a dedicated stream to Robert Malone, even though they have hundreds of thousands more followers than I do, hundreds of thousands more views.

37:21.088 --> 37:30.216
They've done tens of hundreds of more podcasts than me and are really much more responsible for spreading the idea of a lab leak.

37:30.756 --> 37:38.102
And yet the no virus people have never bothered to get together all five together and say, Robert Malone is definitely a bad guy.

37:39.153 --> 37:42.436
In fact, neither have any of the anonymous people on Twitter.

37:44.818 --> 37:50.243
And once you start to see it as the enchantment that it is, it almost seems too simple.

37:51.465 --> 37:55.546
that Elon Musk and his buddy wanted to buy Twitter.

37:56.126 --> 38:00.467
And so they paid a bunch of people to go on Twitter and do this act.

38:01.208 --> 38:09.070
And then when they got censored, then they pretended like Elon Musk rescued them by buying the platform.

38:09.130 --> 38:14.791
And all of these people at Team Worst Case Scenario agree that Elon Musk has saved free speech in America.

38:16.952 --> 38:18.332
It's not even that complicated.

38:19.588 --> 38:27.152
He bought the platform for billions of dollars, supposedly, and none of the people in Team Worst Case Scenario need more than a couple hundred thousand a year.

38:28.412 --> 38:29.533
So it's chump change.

38:31.414 --> 38:35.496
All to make a platform relevant to the populist right?

38:36.416 --> 38:40.879
All to complement the work that Steve Bannon is doing?

38:41.633 --> 38:53.580
But then specifically with one platform, or maybe a couple if you think of Locals being also part of this little network and Rumble being also part of this little network that Team Worst Case Scenario agrees is also a great platform.

38:56.342 --> 38:57.763
Can't you see how easy it is?

38:59.804 --> 39:04.467
It is the vying for the control of more cats.

39:07.244 --> 39:08.585
because that's how we are governed.

39:08.625 --> 39:10.967
We are governed by this kind of illusion.

39:11.027 --> 39:14.970
And I'm absolutely willing to call this team worst case scenario.

39:15.030 --> 39:18.033
I'm absolutely willing to put these names on the screen.

39:18.573 --> 39:21.616
I am not afraid because I know I'm right.

39:23.878 --> 39:27.321
I know that this is what I have to do for my children and for yours.

39:28.464 --> 39:32.448
If you don't like what I'm doing, I would suggest just going to a different stream.

39:33.629 --> 39:40.275
But this is the way out for everyone in America to understand what was done to us and who did it to us.

39:42.668 --> 39:45.609
And I don't think it's very complicated.

39:45.649 --> 39:54.972
You just have to figure out what weaponized piles of money have interest and what weaponized piles of money these people promote.

39:55.332 --> 39:59.034
All of these people agree that Elon Musk saved Twitter.

39:59.274 --> 40:04.076
All of these people agree that the DNA in the shot is unfortunate.

40:05.196 --> 40:06.176
Otherwise it might've worked.

40:06.616 --> 40:10.818
All of these people agree that the spike protein is toxic and we're very early on that.

40:12.008 --> 40:20.500
And all of these people failed to do jack until in the earliest, the middle of 2021, when all the college kids were lost.

40:24.710 --> 40:32.893
And I think you can see them because Team Worst Case Scenario, a few months earlier than that picture, were also on stage together in Romania, of all places.

40:32.953 --> 40:36.914
Because, you know, it's a great place to save North America if you go to Romania.

40:36.954 --> 40:39.395
You can save a lot of Europe, too.

40:39.415 --> 40:41.556
You know, it's a great place to get seen in Europe.

40:43.447 --> 40:46.269
I think it's probably a great place to interact with intelligence.

40:46.349 --> 40:49.511
It's probably a great place to meet secretly.

40:50.131 --> 40:54.294
It's probably, it's just ridiculous that Denny Rancourt went there of all places.

40:54.815 --> 40:57.696
It's just ridiculous that Nick Hudson went there of all places.

40:57.736 --> 41:08.944
And it's just ridiculous that Steven Hatfield is on stage with all these people and nobody seems to see that as the absolute base admission of guilt.

41:11.468 --> 41:19.655
That guy, Stephen Hatfield, at the beginning of the pandemic was telling people that Barney should be wearing a mask so the kids start to understand how serious this is.

41:20.196 --> 41:21.757
These people are criminals.

41:22.738 --> 41:25.821
They are criminals because they are traitors to our grandkids.

41:25.881 --> 41:27.242
They sold us out.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.229
And so I'm not stopping.

41:35.249 --> 41:38.232
I'm just gonna get it a little more professional.

41:39.008 --> 41:42.390
Because I do really think, objectively speaking, these people are guilty.

41:43.511 --> 41:49.676
And the ones that are not guilty need to be pushed and pressured to tell us exactly what happened.

41:50.836 --> 41:58.942
Because exactly what happened is that they were recruited somehow, or they volunteered, or they knew this was coming much earlier than any of us want to know.

41:58.982 --> 42:00.783
Because again, this is how it's done.

42:01.424 --> 42:05.827
Edward Bernays told us how it was done when they only had newspapers and radio.

42:08.160 --> 42:14.601
Noam Chomsky told us how it was done when they only had newspapers and TV and radio and magazines.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.342
And now we have scrolling on social media.

42:22.343 --> 42:24.923
And that's why none of these ideas will be discussed.

42:26.043 --> 42:31.584
Make sure you don't fall victim to the argument that these are pretty bold statements.

42:31.644 --> 42:33.865
Jonathan's gotta have a lot of evidence for this.

42:34.345 --> 42:36.005
Otherwise, I don't even know where to start.

42:37.850 --> 42:38.971
No, see, that's wrong.

42:39.772 --> 42:44.276
Intramuscular injection being dumb is a challenge.

42:45.697 --> 42:51.342
And the antithesis to that is that intramuscular injection is a great way to administer medicine.

42:51.482 --> 42:55.886
That is the statement that needs a mountain of medicine and a mountain of evidence.

42:57.087 --> 42:58.809
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

42:59.793 --> 43:10.929
This should be very easy to disprove with a long list, a short list, a complete list, or a partial list of examples where intramuscular injection isn't so dumb.

43:13.899 --> 43:20.585
And you're going to find that that list is pretty short, especially with reference to augmenting the immune system.

43:21.026 --> 43:22.287
So I don't need evidence.

43:22.427 --> 43:33.957
The people who argue that it's very simple, intramuscular injection's a great way to modify the immune system, those people need a mountain of evidence that they do not have.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.242
Transfection in healthy humans.

43:40.188 --> 43:40.788
Was criminal?

43:40.828 --> 43:41.709
Well, that's easy.

43:42.069 --> 43:43.490
What is transfection?

43:44.010 --> 43:46.872
The definition of transfection is easy to find.

43:47.653 --> 43:49.574
You don't need me.

43:49.834 --> 43:51.975
You need to do the exercises yourself.

43:52.075 --> 43:52.676
Figure it out.

43:52.716 --> 43:54.257
What were they calling transfection?

43:54.317 --> 43:56.638
How many different things did they call transfection?

43:57.118 --> 43:58.900
How big of an umbrella was it?

44:00.441 --> 44:04.123
That's just the start of your biology exercises there.

44:04.163 --> 44:05.804
And finally, RNA cannot pandemic.

44:05.824 --> 44:06.945
It's not a bold statement.

44:07.385 --> 44:08.726
The idea that a chemical

44:09.574 --> 44:11.736
with the right combination of bases.

44:12.576 --> 44:15.519
Can pandemic, now that one needs some evidence.

44:21.912 --> 44:47.868
And so my argument is quite succinctly that there wouldn't be no reason for Kevin McKernan, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project and acolyte apprentice of Mark Lander and Francis Collins, there would have been no need for him to be on podcast after podcast from the beginning of the pandemic talking about the

44:49.309 --> 44:56.157
nuances of PCR as a diagnostic, there would have been no reason for him to be out there.

44:56.617 --> 45:04.086
He would have been no reason to do podcasts with Naomi Wolf, no reason to be writing papers with Claire Craig.

45:04.686 --> 45:07.710
None of those things would have happened spontaneously.

45:10.578 --> 45:30.629
He is there for a reason, and that's why in 2024, at the end of the year, he went on Danny Jones' podcast, the one that has all these guys that whisper Satan into the mic, and smoke weed, and talk about the devil, and talk about the lies of the Bible.

45:31.009 --> 45:35.732
The same podcast, a couple weeks earlier, has this guy on.

45:37.247 --> 45:43.053
And he tells a whole series of incorrect statements, a whole series of incorrect statements about a book that I worked on.

45:44.554 --> 45:55.085
And this is the brightest light in my mind in terms of their illusion and the level of malevolence that these people have come to.

45:56.710 --> 46:12.205
where my interaction with this guy over the last five years reveals nothing but malevolence and likely a very, very crucial role that this guy plays in crafting this narrative and giving green lights to new things for people to say.

46:13.005 --> 46:14.747
There's no other explanation.

46:16.869 --> 46:18.751
He's going to be a main character in my book.

46:24.195 --> 46:28.657
And so we move on now with the idea that social media, we just have to get off.

46:28.777 --> 46:32.638
We have to start establishing our own soap boxes and link them together.

46:33.139 --> 46:38.901
We have to have our own federalized, decentralized social media that we all hook up together.

46:38.921 --> 46:44.103
You know, peer tubes need to be hooked up to other peer tubes, this kind of thing.

46:45.387 --> 46:56.247
Because if you keep scrolling on their apps to try and figure out what's going on, you're either giving them all your thoughts or you're allowing them to give you your thoughts.

46:56.527 --> 46:57.670
And either way you lose.

46:59.662 --> 47:00.783
Nobody else is saying this.

47:00.843 --> 47:02.644
CHD is not saying the U.S.

47:02.684 --> 47:05.186
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

47:05.326 --> 47:16.293
The lawyers of ICANN are not saying that we need to hold the government to strict scrutiny when they suspend fundamental rights, even in an emergency, because if they did, this would start to break down.

47:16.653 --> 47:22.677
And instead, they establish a big top tent of health freedom and they hide the murderer with lies.

47:22.737 --> 47:23.938
These people are traitors.

47:24.078 --> 47:28.400
And they are perpetuating a myth about virology that has been

47:30.626 --> 47:36.410
you know, the source of fear, uncertainty, and doubt since AIDS and before.

47:40.072 --> 47:45.656
And the way that social media works, if you saw that graphic change, is that it kind of distorts your time horizons.

47:46.656 --> 47:50.759
And they really want you to forget 2020 and 2021, where all the murder happened.

47:50.779 --> 47:52.140
They want that to kind of fade in.

47:52.780 --> 47:54.822
I can't even remember 2020 anymore.

47:54.862 --> 47:56.563
It's just all a big blur to me.

47:58.243 --> 48:02.885
There's not going to be any blurs on GigaOM Biological about 2020 and 2021.

48:03.246 --> 48:18.133
We're still trying to archive by the day what happened and what people said in those years because I believe that history will end up to be the most important part of American history that I've ever lived through.

48:21.806 --> 48:45.100
And so let me remind you again that the main biological phenomenon that underlies this in Europe and in America, in any Western nation, any modern Western nation, is that for a brief period of time after World War II, the extreme prosperity led to very large families, large families in Germany, large families in Holland, large families in England, large families in America.

48:46.049 --> 48:52.751
But that phenomenon did not last, partially because our rulers didn't really want it to last.

48:54.792 --> 48:57.393
Mainly because our rulers didn't want it to last.

48:57.673 --> 49:06.336
All governments around the world since World War II have been trying to take down the population growth rate.

49:07.526 --> 49:15.389
If we just go back to this previous slide just one more time to make sure that I can play it for you, you can see this bump coming, right?

49:15.429 --> 49:20.712
You can see that there was a known rise in the number of people that would be retiring here.

49:21.432 --> 49:24.633
And this is females, this is males, and the ages go up.

49:24.713 --> 49:29.475
And so anytime you pause this graph, if I can just do that for you, like in 2006, where we have

49:32.625 --> 49:35.406
297.8 million people in America.

49:35.446 --> 49:48.671
You can distribute the population along this graph and kind of get an understanding of what the population looks like and how many people are above 90 versus how many people are below age 4.

49:49.891 --> 49:51.872
How many people are about to come into college?

49:52.912 --> 49:54.533
How many people are about to retire?

49:58.201 --> 50:12.417
And I would argue that people like Ted Turner and the Club of Rome and whoever else you want to say has been in charge definitely monitors this in every country because that's why they decide with regard to immigration and stuff like that.

50:12.437 --> 50:13.538
They have to balance this out.

50:13.578 --> 50:18.904
We can't have a bunch of old people and no tax base underneath them following them up.

50:20.273 --> 50:30.320
And so the Netherlands encouraged immigration from Turkey and from Morocco several different times during their history to make sure that this population pyramid didn't get too top heavy.

50:32.661 --> 50:37.004
And I would argue that a lot of the current thing with immigration is to do with this.

50:37.224 --> 50:47.911
It is to do with this, to hide this extreme problem that might even not be adequately represented here because again, this is government data too.

50:49.181 --> 50:52.148
If this problem is more severe, they would just hide it, right?

50:52.548 --> 50:55.335
That's my default assumption.

50:57.799 --> 51:07.503
And so if we let this thing continue, you can see, if you just watch the top of the graph here, we have a pretty consistent number of people that don't make it past, let's say 80.

51:08.383 --> 51:19.228
But that's changing now, and very rapidly by the multiple millions, which means we need more beds, we need more nursing homes, we're going to need more social security money, we're going to need more Medicare money.

51:20.796 --> 51:22.898
And so that needed to be managed.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.820
And again, here you go to Fortune Magazine.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.922
You can see that they already know this is population growth.

51:28.483 --> 51:29.784
These are tiny numbers.

51:31.446 --> 51:33.988
And they think that population is gonna become negative.

51:34.028 --> 51:35.349
It's probably already negative.

51:35.389 --> 51:38.432
Look, the only reason why it's not is because of immigration.

51:41.240 --> 52:01.737
And so there are big truths out there about the biology of our population that are just being wholly dismissed, not talked about and obfuscated so that you don't understand that the biggest sources of these signals is not a novel virus, is not, you know, transfection.

52:02.698 --> 52:07.262
The biggest source of these numbers is just the natural biology of our population.

52:07.322 --> 52:09.063
And the worse the lie is,

52:10.094 --> 52:14.556
about this, the worse our problem is.

52:15.576 --> 52:24.640
If they're not telling us the truth about the population pyramid and the base of our population pyramid is even narrower than they say,

52:25.834 --> 52:28.555
then they have an even bigger problem to manage.

52:28.655 --> 52:40.038
And if you look at some of the population pyramids in Europe, I think you might be surprised to see that their population pyramids look a little more unstable than the one that we're shown about ours.

52:41.178 --> 52:43.119
Could it be that immigration has fixed this problem?

52:43.159 --> 52:43.739
It's possible.

52:43.899 --> 52:47.240
That's what this graph seems to indicate, but I'm doubtful.

52:49.249 --> 52:54.313
And I tend to err on the side of, you know, they're probably not telling us the extent of the problem.

52:54.333 --> 52:59.316
They're probably not giving us the right numbers or they're rounding them off in a very clever way.

53:00.577 --> 53:03.539
And it's all just one gigantic show.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.101
There is a show on TV.

53:06.161 --> 53:13.626
There's a show on social media, but that show has different layers and it's all one cake.

53:16.297 --> 53:24.984
And so I've started to kind of think about this as a group of people that some of the people might not know as much as other people do.

53:25.644 --> 53:35.512
Some of the people sit up here at the top of the diagram more in need of control or shepherding in order to make sure they don't say anything too dangerous.

53:36.721 --> 53:43.208
I am now suggesting on this show that some of these people are likely the ones that are shepherding the others.

53:43.989 --> 53:51.797
I don't think that everybody on this level is sophisticated enough to know how badly they've been used, but all of them are aware they are part of it.

53:52.705 --> 54:03.518
All of them are aware that they are telling a lie or agreeing not to say something or agreeing to emphasize something that doesn't need emphasis and have agreed to it.

54:03.619 --> 54:07.844
The question is, how many of these people still really enjoy what they're doing?

54:07.904 --> 54:10.968
How many of these people still really enjoy being on this team?

54:12.093 --> 54:14.414
because I don't think all of them enjoy it anymore.

54:14.494 --> 54:18.696
For example, Jessica Hockett has gone off of X completely.

54:18.756 --> 54:23.057
She used to have two or three accounts on X. Now she's not on X at all.

54:23.117 --> 54:26.879
And given that she had many more followers than me, it's curious that she's gone.

54:28.388 --> 54:33.553
And that's just one observation, but I assure you this graph isn't very off.

54:33.673 --> 54:36.416
This isn't very far away from where we need to be.

54:36.436 --> 54:47.166
I think most of these organizations are either from the very beginning the idea of being saboteurs and cat wranglers or

54:48.587 --> 54:54.570
Very soon after their establishment, they were sabotaged by the people that gained control of them.

54:54.650 --> 54:59.332
So Children's Health Defense was most likely sabotaged by Mary Holland.

55:00.092 --> 55:03.713
But it's hard for me to say that it could be just her.

55:04.534 --> 55:09.176
I think there are several other people that are also actively sabotaging that organization.

55:09.196 --> 55:13.758
And that's the reason why the founder retired and nobody said anything.

55:13.818 --> 55:14.518
When Laura Bono

55:15.138 --> 55:27.842
Retired nobody at CHD dedicated anything or said thank you or did anything because Mary Holland wants to be and her job is to be The the face of CHD and Polly's job is to do that.

55:27.882 --> 55:41.627
They're supposed to forget that Laura Bono did anything And and and it's I think all of these organizations to some extent represent Conflicts of interest they represent

55:43.126 --> 55:44.267
sort of fake resistance.

55:44.567 --> 55:46.609
They're not really accomplishing anything.

55:46.649 --> 56:00.402
That's why Brett Weinstein is responsible for the Hope Accord, and also writes for Brownstone, and also organized the Rescue of the Republic, and also promotes the World Council for Health, and also, it's just all very obnoxious and gross.

56:02.008 --> 56:08.831
But you even have things like the International COVID Summit, you know, and the FLCCC changed their name to the Independent Medical Alliance.

56:08.871 --> 56:09.972
It doesn't change anything.

56:10.052 --> 56:17.115
It's still the same, it's still the same limited spectrum of debate.

56:18.476 --> 56:29.603
where they don't discuss the total number of deaths per week compared to the COVID deaths, compared to the pneumonia deaths, because if they did, they would have to admit that we've had pneumonia under control.

56:30.164 --> 56:38.069
We've had pneumonia under control for decades and then lost control of it just for about two years and then we got control of it again.

56:39.350 --> 56:40.831
And that doesn't really make any sense.

56:42.312 --> 56:46.835
It doesn't really make any sense unless there was a coordinated effort to have that happen.

56:47.762 --> 56:50.546
That's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

56:52.929 --> 56:54.711
I apologize for the heater in the background.

56:54.731 --> 56:55.713
I hope it's not too loud.

56:55.753 --> 57:03.162
And so the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, the anticipated rise in expected deaths can be seen in this graph.

57:03.182 --> 57:04.504
Here you can see the line.

57:05.561 --> 57:08.423
of 50,000 just kind of disappears.

57:09.143 --> 57:15.566
And instead of the dip being at 50,000, the dip is at 60,000 over here in our last five years.

57:15.626 --> 57:21.389
You see, these are the summer dips here in all cause mortality in America.

57:21.429 --> 57:27.973
And those dips are now below 60,000 instead of dipping below 50,000 where they did a decade ago.

57:28.653 --> 57:28.793
Hmm.

57:29.659 --> 57:32.119
So you can actually see the slope right here in this graph.

57:32.159 --> 57:41.601
And all they had to do then was kind of sculpt them together using murder so that they get those sharp peaks and they could go on the news and say, look, everybody's dying.

57:45.402 --> 57:48.442
And of course, this creates a multi-generational myth.

57:48.582 --> 57:53.543
This could enslave our grandkids if we willingly go along with teaching them this.

57:53.643 --> 57:57.924
Just the same as if we teach our grandchildren to believe in Santa Claus, they will.

57:58.956 --> 58:06.077
But this is much worse because this is on TV and on the news and in the military and in the bureaucracy and in the elites.

58:06.197 --> 58:07.178
They all believe in it.

58:08.178 --> 58:10.438
So this is a very, very malevolent place.

58:10.918 --> 58:14.219
And it is a real worry to me that they have eliminated the control group.

58:14.279 --> 58:23.481
Effectively, in the older adults, effectively in the younger adults, even if there's people in the middle ground that haven't taken it,

58:24.301 --> 58:26.883
I don't know if there's a useful control group anymore.

58:26.923 --> 58:35.409
I don't know if there's a useful number of people that won't inevitably have bad side effects from their continuing to transfect themselves.

58:35.849 --> 58:37.690
And that's why this is about the children of Earth.

58:37.731 --> 58:44.055
We have to stop the vaccination and transfection of all the children of Earth.

58:47.321 --> 58:48.801
And so don't forget how they did this.

58:48.861 --> 58:51.422
They did this by tricking us into solving a mystery.

58:52.002 --> 59:10.027
And I do really think it's worthwhile to keep reminding you of that, that it's comical, that we are teenagers in a play where we think we have solved the mystery that Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci were covering up.

59:11.168 --> 59:15.149
And it is that part of this that makes us so certain.

59:16.064 --> 59:18.546
It is that part of this that makes us so certain.

59:18.646 --> 59:26.251
That's what made me so certain about a lab leak that I threw away a 20-year career in academia.

59:27.318 --> 59:29.880
because I was so sure that I had figured it out.

59:30.020 --> 59:33.622
And that is a wonderfully powerful way to learn.

59:34.222 --> 59:42.447
If a kid figures out a story problem in math, they really do learn the math a little better than if they just do the equation.

59:42.487 --> 59:47.470
Because again, they are solving a puzzle, and it makes more of an impression on their brain, if you will.

59:48.248 --> 59:50.570
It is a much more effective way to learn.

59:51.711 --> 59:54.294
And I don't know why that was edited so funny.

59:54.334 --> 59:55.695
And so it is really now.

59:55.895 --> 59:56.776
It is really now.

59:56.976 --> 01:00:05.444
The population of Earth, if we had the real population data, I am sure the population of Earth is about to collapse.

01:00:05.504 --> 01:00:07.726
That's the reason why they keep telling us it is.

01:00:08.527 --> 01:00:19.230
It's just that they can't tell you how badly it's gonna collapse, because if they knew, for example, that in 20 years, half the houses in America were gonna be empty, well, that would be a pretty big problem now, wouldn't it?

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.391
Housing might go, the market might crash, you know?

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:30.833
If they've suddenly found out that nobody was gonna be buying diamonds anymore because nobody's getting married anymore, then, you know, yeah.

01:00:33.322 --> 01:00:36.703
And so we have a problem because they have a problem.

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:38.404
They've set themselves up for this.

01:00:38.484 --> 01:00:39.344
They already know.

01:00:39.384 --> 01:00:40.625
They've already had the meetings.

01:00:40.725 --> 01:00:50.709
Part of the mythology that they've told each other in these meetings over the last 20 and 30 years is that world population is pretty much under control.

01:00:50.729 --> 01:00:52.730
We're going to have this peak and that's going to go away.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:59.993
And so we've got to take advantage of this peak and collect all of this data because we're never going to have this many experimental animals again.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:08.640
And if anything was learned through the Human Genome Project, it's that they need every genome they can get their hands on.

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:17.446
And they need to be able to store that data in a way that they can eventually dump it through a heretofore non-existent AI that will solve the pattern.

01:01:17.867 --> 01:01:19.408
Because otherwise, it's not gonna work.

01:01:19.488 --> 01:01:21.830
That's really the only hope they have.

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:25.312
And they are Ray Kurzweilers about it.

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:27.794
They're telling us that in 20 years, it's gonna be there.

01:01:28.743 --> 01:01:42.109
Again, without talking honestly about the biology of what occurred, without talking honestly about an anticipated rise in expected deaths that could have easily been used to create this illusion.

01:01:43.297 --> 01:01:44.878
because they're all in on it.

01:01:45.259 --> 01:02:00.411
In one way or another, they are all in on it, even if they are only fooled by the people who are in the middle of my diagram, even if they're only just going along with the flattery and the continued rise of their prominence on Rumble.

01:02:01.712 --> 01:02:09.039
They are ignoring this, that Mark Kulak and myself and just a few other people, if there are any, I don't know,

01:02:09.963 --> 01:02:17.738
who have been saying that supplementary oxygen ventilators, a lack of antibiotic use and opioid deaths in America would be enough to create this phenomenon.

01:02:18.479 --> 01:02:21.205
Nevermind all these other things that are definitely in play.

01:02:22.443 --> 01:02:24.785
It is murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:25.226 --> 01:02:27.628
And you have to see the time horizon as it is.

01:02:27.668 --> 01:02:36.277
You have to look at all these years and you have to put them all into perspective to see that we had pneumonia under control for years.

01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:37.979
And I'm going to point it out one more time.

01:02:38.419 --> 01:02:45.927
And then we lost control just for two years, just for two years, just long enough for us to probably manage that problem.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:03:01.719
So you can see that rise, it's just predicted, and all they had to do was take that and tell us a story about a novel virus that changed colors for five years, circulated among the white-tailed deer, and here we are.

01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:06.685
Look at it very carefully, ladies and gentlemen, the murder ends.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:13.964
and it's before anybody usefully speaks out.

01:03:14.084 --> 01:03:25.626
It's a whole year before Robert Malone, Meryl Ness, Sasha Latupova, Malhotra and Palmer are on stage in Sweden, a whole year.

01:03:28.827 --> 01:03:35.308
After the murder stopped in America, they were still just getting started with their COVID summits.

01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:37.555
Look at it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:37.575 --> 01:03:41.298
Look at it very, very carefully because this is really crucial to see.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:48.583
We had pneumonia under control and then we got control of it again over there.

01:03:49.104 --> 01:03:52.466
Something happened and it was just murder and lies.

01:03:52.607 --> 01:03:56.770
I'm sorry, but it's an anticipated rise and expected death sculpted using murder.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.911
And they created that illusion.

01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:00.032
That's what, this is it.

01:04:02.414 --> 01:04:03.255
And it's their fault.

01:04:04.486 --> 01:04:05.067
you.

01:04:15.976 --> 01:04:30.869
And so just a reminder, if you really like what's happening here, you think that you need more of this or you want to support this work as I transition into JC on the hardwood and teaching biology 101, go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support the work.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:31.169
Thanks.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.052
So again, here we are, all the marbles.

01:04:34.953 --> 01:04:37.835
I just want to do a couple points on this timeline.

01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:40.978
First of all, remember... If you want to move from...

01:04:41.238 --> 01:04:47.400
Yesterday, or like last week, we were discussing how Mary Holland, right after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:04:47.360 --> 01:05:04.224
's hearings, was on the war room with Steve Bannon, and that was pretty crazy because Mark Kulak, a friend of mine, has been working on really putting into context what Steve Bannon was doing and saying before the pandemic and during the pandemic, and it hits remarkable.

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:24.410
And the most remarkable thing is that it feels very much like he and Elon Musk and Peter Thiel could all be in on the creation of this, you know, new populist right movement, which ultimately kind of helped Trump get into the White House and may now be essentially hijacking the

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.551
the Trump administration somehow.

01:05:27.571 --> 01:05:29.652
I mean, I don't purport to know what's going on.

01:05:30.072 --> 01:05:32.653
I just know that these people are all performing together.

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:38.055
And the reason why I can say that with confidence is because they've all talked to me except for him.

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:40.576
I mean, I've been in a Zoom meeting with him, but I never talked to him.

01:05:41.477 --> 01:05:46.679
But Mary Holland's been in countless Zoom meetings with me and countless in-person meetings with me.

01:05:47.399 --> 01:05:51.362
and she knows exactly how I feel and exactly what I think of her.

01:05:52.422 --> 01:06:04.010
So the point being here again that I think this is one of the primary saboteurs in CHD and my best evidence is that in 2015 she was actually on a

01:06:08.553 --> 01:06:15.676
She was on Democracy Now, arguing with Paul Offit and kind of being supported by Rand Paul.

01:06:16.116 --> 01:06:26.761
And so actually 10 years ago, this performance started with the same characters now opposing each other 10 years later.

01:06:26.801 --> 01:06:29.162
And so there is no other way to see it.

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:34.304
That's why I think Steve Bannon is probably a lot more important than Ralph Baric up there in the corner.

01:06:35.004 --> 01:06:45.749
And I think we have people like Mark Kulak to thank for that, that you can really see, maybe even Steve Bannon is the guy who was paying George Webb and these people before the pandemic.

01:06:46.289 --> 01:06:56.714
Maybe Steve Bannon is the guy who finds the money on the stock exchange that pays for the stuff that these people are doing.

01:06:56.754 --> 01:06:57.434
I don't know.

01:06:57.935 --> 01:06:58.535
I really don't.

01:06:58.555 --> 01:07:00.636
Let's just listen.

01:07:01.286 --> 01:07:07.109
And as far as news goes, well, everyone knows there's a lot of news swirling around these days.

01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:17.214
We have two articles about the freeze, the Trump freeze on meetings, science meetings, travel, communications, hiring.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:22.596
This is all having to do with HHS.

01:07:27.728 --> 01:07:32.050
See, the problem with that link that you just dropped into the chat is this.

01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:34.951
I'm gonna escape out of here for a second.

01:07:36.132 --> 01:07:37.012
I appreciate the link.

01:07:40.174 --> 01:07:41.774
Look, here's the problem with that link.

01:07:43.335 --> 01:07:48.417
And I don't know how to say it any other way than just straight up, right in your face, I'm just gonna say it.

01:07:51.179 --> 01:07:52.639
Where the hell are my pictures here?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.420
I had pictures of them.

01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:55.881
Where did they go?

01:07:57.113 --> 01:07:57.553
That's weird.

01:07:57.633 --> 01:07:58.234
Oh yeah, right here.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:05.418
So I think I already showed it to you, but I'm sure I did.

01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:09.240
But look, Kristoff is this guy right here.

01:08:12.162 --> 01:08:15.704
And unfortunately, Kristoff was also in Romania.

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:18.045
Right here in the middle.

01:08:19.206 --> 01:08:20.687
Kristoff also went to Japan.

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:27.507
And Kristoff also, let's see, here we go.

01:08:28.547 --> 01:08:29.648
I got some more stuff for you.

01:08:30.928 --> 01:08:35.711
La da da da.

01:08:35.731 --> 01:08:37.011
Da da da da da.

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:39.153
Hold on one second, I'll find it.

01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:41.674
This is the APS stuff here.

01:08:42.154 --> 01:08:42.454
Shit.

01:08:43.535 --> 01:08:44.755
I got to get on the floor for a second.

01:08:45.176 --> 01:08:48.617
Because I moved a new, where did it go?

01:08:49.818 --> 01:08:51.979
I moved a new table in here.

01:08:57.912 --> 01:09:12.717
So here's for example, you can also see this if we if we look at Jason Kristoff's Jason Kristoff's mail from January 27.

01:09:12.897 --> 01:09:19.319
He's just sending stuff out here and he's promoting David Ike and

01:09:22.128 --> 01:09:42.542
He's promoting Brett Weinstein on on on Tucker Is that I thought I had one also with oh, yeah here Here's Jason Kristoff also sending a mail about Meryl Nass describes our biggest threat and

01:09:43.857 --> 01:09:58.823
And so what I find a problem with Jason Kristof, of course, is that he really appears to be playing the exact game that I'm accusing these people of playing, which is that they only promote each other and they only promote a very limited spectrum of debate.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:03.105
And so you can, these are just emails right here where he's promoting Meryl Nass.

01:10:03.925 --> 01:10:07.967
Here's an email where he's promoting David Icke and Brett Weinstein.

01:10:08.007 --> 01:10:10.288
I mean, this is not a real person.

01:10:11.454 --> 01:10:27.143
Even if he's saying some things that are very smart, he is promoting the people that promote the novel virus, the lab leak, the RNA transfection being a vaccine that didn't work quite right, that the contamination is a significant thing.

01:10:27.963 --> 01:10:32.006
And like I said, him being in front of my Senate doesn't make me happy.

01:10:33.346 --> 01:10:34.547
He's not even an American.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.082
So that's a problem.

01:10:37.302 --> 01:10:38.964
That's very much a problem for me.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:43.129
I'm sorry, but I don't see Christoph as being possible.

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:44.952
He's been on too many trips with them.

01:10:44.992 --> 01:10:49.297
They've spent thousands of dollars flying that guy around the world.

01:10:49.357 --> 01:10:51.720
There's probably no way that he's a good guy.

01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:55.786
So let's listen to Twib for a second.

01:10:56.446 --> 01:11:02.308
And as far as news goes, well, everyone knows there's a lot of news swirling around these days.

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:12.391
We have two articles about the freeze, the Trump freeze on meetings, science meetings, travel, communications, hiring.

01:11:13.512 --> 01:11:17.773
This is all having to do with HHS.

01:11:21.331 --> 01:11:24.374
So it includes NIH, CDC, FDA.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.316
It's almost like he's getting really slow.

01:11:27.557 --> 01:11:28.058
It's nuts.

01:11:28.238 --> 01:11:31.821
It's become slower and slower.

01:11:33.503 --> 01:11:43.392
And so the excuse is so that they can determine what it is you're going to hear.

01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:45.394
Sounds ominous, doesn't it?

01:11:45.574 --> 01:11:45.855
Yes.

01:11:47.062 --> 01:11:49.683
and want to censor it and say, no, you're not gonna hear this.

01:11:50.244 --> 01:11:53.545
You're not gonna hear about the goodness of HPV vaccine.

01:11:53.565 --> 01:11:55.446
You're gonna, no, you're not gonna hear.

01:11:55.466 --> 01:11:57.467
That's what I'm afraid of, frankly.

01:11:57.507 --> 01:12:08.413
I mean, but that's, so we have a science article called, the Trump hit NIH with devastating freezes on meetings, travel, communications, and hiring.

01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:10.534
So everybody's freaking out.

01:12:10.554 --> 01:12:11.735
This is by Jocelyn.

01:12:12.836 --> 01:12:18.941
So, of course, they're talking about the fact that Trump has suspended some things in NIH, and all this stuff is just theater.

01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:23.124
It's all theater.

01:12:23.144 --> 01:12:31.952
The scary part is that we have people who believe that USAID only gives out food, and then we have other people who believe that USAID only pays for propaganda.

01:12:32.532 --> 01:12:38.315
And so we have a very big chasm between the different camps in America.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:40.956
It's a dangerous situation that was created on purpose.

01:12:41.517 --> 01:12:47.620
And these guys are terrifying if you see them as a window into the most

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.721
you know, disturbed portion of that site.

01:12:51.002 --> 01:12:57.885
Host conferences, basically the whole operation of HHS is jammed right now.

01:12:58.486 --> 01:13:06.050
And when Vincent said impacted, I'm not sure whether you meant impact as in effect or impacted like a colon, but I was thinking like a colon.

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.671
I was thinking like a colon, yeah.

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.231
Yeah, so the whole system is just jammed.

01:13:13.532 --> 01:13:20.196
And this is government dysfunction, this is chaos, this is what people voted for, so here you all go.

01:13:20.216 --> 01:13:30.702
Yeah, I don't know that people, most people have any idea what's going on because most people don't pay attention to the news, right?

01:13:30.862 --> 01:13:35.465
I think it's pretty hard to avoid, but people will notice when it starts having an impact on their day-to-day lives.

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:45.215
We have another science article entitled, Is Your Research on Trump's Spending Hit List?

01:13:46.816 --> 01:13:52.821
How the White House's pause in federal spending could affect academic science.

01:13:54.582 --> 01:13:55.783
I don't know who this is by.

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:57.124
Jeffrey Mervis.

01:13:59.125 --> 01:13:59.866
Just a couple minutes here.

01:13:59.886 --> 01:14:03.729
It's also about the spending freeze and the idea being that

01:14:05.652 --> 01:14:08.135
when it starts up again, it may not be everything.

01:14:08.175 --> 01:14:11.640
There may be some cuts to things that they don't like.

01:14:16.407 --> 01:14:16.687
Whoops.

01:14:17.648 --> 01:14:20.772
I'm going to let it keep going because there's an interesting little part here.

01:14:21.233 --> 01:14:23.316
So this is bad.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.244
You know, for a computer analogy, I know we have a lot of of IT folks in the audience.

01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:38.990
It's like if a new user on a Linux system found a list of running processes and just went through killing any that they didn't recognize.

01:14:39.751 --> 01:14:40.031
Yeah.

01:14:40.211 --> 01:14:42.073
Imagine what impact that would have.

01:14:42.233 --> 01:14:42.453
Just.

01:14:42.653 --> 01:14:43.534
Yeah, that's good.

01:14:44.034 --> 01:14:44.555
I like that.

01:14:46.796 --> 01:14:52.040
So if I were still in the NIH game, boy, I'd be freaking out.

01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:52.581
Oh, yeah.

01:14:54.392 --> 01:15:01.016
So I have sympathy for our colleagues who are stuck in this.

01:15:01.656 --> 01:15:13.282
In fact, we have a pic that relates to it, a way that you can contact your congressperson about this coming up, because you should write and complain, even though

01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:17.051
Everything's on a partisan line now.

01:15:17.372 --> 01:15:19.193
Anything happened with RFK Jr.?

01:15:19.273 --> 01:15:19.794
Did they vote?

01:15:20.034 --> 01:15:29.002
They were... I am not really... If the news has like a Trump headline in it, I don't... because I'm not going to visit that.

01:15:30.663 --> 01:15:35.668
But last headlines I saw, they were still grilling him, so I don't know.

01:15:37.463 --> 01:15:37.983
Let's see.

01:15:38.824 --> 01:15:46.446
I mean, if he doesn't make it, then some other idiot who's who's probably just as bad is going to get put up in his place, because that's the whole point is to wreck the system.

01:15:48.247 --> 01:15:49.768
Yeah, he's they haven't voted yet.

01:15:49.988 --> 01:15:50.168
Yeah.

01:15:52.389 --> 01:15:54.670
The controlled demolition of America is still on the books.

01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:56.410
His nomination is in trouble.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:57.991
I hope so.

01:15:59.371 --> 01:16:02.473
The thing is that the numbers go like this.

01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:04.433
Party line vote.

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.034
And then.

01:16:07.722 --> 01:16:09.483
There are like three people who might.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.304
Murkowski.

01:16:10.324 --> 01:16:10.524
Yeah.

01:16:11.445 --> 01:16:12.105
Who's the other?

01:16:12.145 --> 01:16:12.686
Collins.

01:16:13.006 --> 01:16:13.206
Right.

01:16:13.627 --> 01:16:16.689
And in this case, McConnell doesn't want to vote for him.

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.071
That makes it 50-50.

01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:32.902
And then... Either he's exhausted from some kind of all-nighter like he flew from New Zealand last night, or this guy is rapidly deteriorating.

01:16:33.943 --> 01:16:36.184
Muck cast the deciding vote.

01:16:36.204 --> 01:16:36.324
Yeah.

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:38.318
And I mean schmuck.

01:16:38.398 --> 01:16:40.339
I've just never seen such a schmuck in my life.

01:16:43.781 --> 01:16:50.924
There's one some pull off is that there's one doc in Congress who might vote against RFK.

01:16:53.672 --> 01:17:04.102
I have not been watching the hearings, but people have been telling me, and he's just totally out of his league, and the Democrats are ripping it.

01:17:04.142 --> 01:17:08.186
Of course, he's completely unqualified for any government post, let alone this one.

01:17:08.986 --> 01:17:11.549
Bernie Sanders brought out this onesie.

01:17:14.549 --> 01:17:17.852
It's just some kind of a thing that you wear, like a baby would wear.

01:17:19.514 --> 01:17:22.156
Some kind of thing that you wear that a baby would wear?

01:17:22.316 --> 01:17:23.477
Did he not have kids?

01:17:23.537 --> 01:17:24.558
Wouldn't that be weird?

01:17:24.779 --> 01:17:25.760
I think he probably what?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.361
Basically, don't vaccinate me.

01:17:27.782 --> 01:17:29.043
Sold by his company.

01:17:30.304 --> 01:17:31.065
His company?

01:17:32.867 --> 01:17:35.768
It's almost like they have a bad script on purpose, right?

01:17:35.808 --> 01:17:40.931
So that people like you and me who want to believe in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., it's not a company.

01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:42.171
He didn't work for that.

01:17:42.211 --> 01:17:45.393
They got out of, oh, hey, hey.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:49.174
And Saunders said, do you endorse this?

01:17:49.194 --> 01:17:51.576
And he said, I don't have anything to do with that company anymore.

01:17:52.496 --> 01:17:53.076
And just lie.

01:17:53.476 --> 01:17:53.677
Yeah.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:18:01.020
He also would not agree not to take litigation money

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:05.310
Like his company is suing Merck over the HPV vaccine.

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.710
He'll still take it.

01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:08.532
He says, no, I'm not going to agree not to take it.

01:18:08.592 --> 01:18:10.713
I mean, in the old days, that was a killer.

01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:11.113
Yep.

01:18:13.275 --> 01:18:13.875
But no more.

01:18:15.056 --> 01:18:22.660
So by the next time we record, I'm sure this will be resolved and hopefully get your kids.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.921
Probably in some horrible way.

01:18:24.461 --> 01:18:26.803
Get your kids vaccinated.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:27.303
Yes.

01:18:28.284 --> 01:18:31.126
Do it as soon as you can, because who knows?

01:18:32.076 --> 01:18:34.759
What's going to happen to vaccine access?

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.280
Oh my gosh.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.082
We're going to get all your vaccines quick.

01:18:38.202 --> 01:18:39.424
Very sad situation.

01:18:44.369 --> 01:18:45.510
Very sad situation.

01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:46.111
Um,

01:18:47.503 --> 01:18:51.027
And you have to say, OK, well, we will have H1N1 deaths.

01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:53.009
Of course, that would be unavoidable.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:19:04.381
I used there Sir Donaldson's quote, where he said that in the UK, by the peak of the epidemic, 40 people would die per day at the end of the summer.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:08.766
So 62 at that time, million people in UK, 40 deaths a day.

01:19:08.806 --> 01:19:10.047
I worked it out for Belgium.

01:19:10.368 --> 01:19:13.031
That would be seven deaths a day at the peak of the epidemic.

01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:14.553
I used that in the media.

01:19:14.853 --> 01:19:20.059
Seven Belgian flu deaths per day at the peak of the epidemic would be realistic.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.701
That is true in every year, even inter-pandemically.

01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:26.422
That is very, very conservative.

01:19:26.782 --> 01:19:32.264
However, talking about fatalities is important, because when you say that, people say, wow, what do you mean?

01:19:32.324 --> 01:19:34.125
People die because of influenza?

01:19:34.485 --> 01:19:37.246
And that was a necessary step to take.

01:19:37.546 --> 01:19:42.748
And then, of course, a couple of days later, you had the first H1N1 death in the country.

01:19:43.268 --> 01:19:45.689
And the scene was set, and it was already talked about.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:49.671
And then you had to pick who is going to be vaccinated first.

01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:52.952
And then, well, women and children first, whatever.

01:19:52.972 --> 01:19:55.113
I mean, risk groups, they were important.

01:19:55.633 --> 01:20:05.917
And then I misused the fact that the top football soccer clubs in Belgium, he actually used the word I misused.

01:20:07.078 --> 01:20:13.681
He is now admitting that he misconstrued the vaccination of pro

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:18.764
football teams as being unfair or selfish.

01:20:19.704 --> 01:20:22.585
The debate about who should get the vaccine first.

01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:31.488
All of these things have been tried out and rehearsed and all of the people in this room are laughing because they participate in these theaters.

01:20:32.768 --> 01:20:36.390
Because these theaters sell millions of doses of their products.

01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:44.012
Millions of instances of their patented therapeutics, diagnostics,

01:20:47.774 --> 01:21:00.143
which is the circle of people that Robert Malone was running around in for 20 years before the pandemic and claims to have found himself semi-retired from, I guess, or no, really, because he was working for DITRA at the start.

01:21:01.344 --> 01:21:05.827
These people are willing to lie about the causes of death.

01:21:06.348 --> 01:21:09.550
They are willing to lie about how many people die every week.

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:11.031
He just told you that too.

01:21:11.812 --> 01:21:13.633
That's a conservative number.

01:21:13.673 --> 01:21:14.654
That's not any different.

01:21:14.674 --> 01:21:15.815
That would be true any year.

01:21:18.723 --> 01:21:33.992
Just like I'm trying to tell you, any year they've had the deaths by pneumonia under control, and then they lost control, and they are telling you a story about what happened to make them lose control.

01:21:35.733 --> 01:21:36.813
They didn't lose control.

01:21:37.033 --> 01:21:37.974
They murdered people.

01:21:43.487 --> 01:21:51.254
inappropriately and against all agreements, vaccinated their, they made their soccer players priority people.

01:21:51.894 --> 01:21:52.975
So I said, I can use that.

01:21:53.596 --> 01:22:04.965
Because if the population really believes that this vaccine is so desirable that even the soccer players would be dishonest to get their vaccine, I said, okay, I can play with that.

01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:06.366
So I made a big fuss about this.

01:22:06.726 --> 01:22:09.128
This is Van Ranst, he's raving mad.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:19.043
But of course you can remember that Tom Cruise was publicly lauded for insisting that everybody get vaccinated to be on set.

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:22.048
That's how they made Top Gun.

01:22:22.889 --> 01:22:23.390
Maverick.

01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:40.783
You can remember that they vaccinated all the pro teams, and there was a big to-do about whether or not Brett Favre was vaccinated, whether or not Kyrie Irving could play in the Madison Square Garden or not.

01:22:42.244 --> 01:22:54.610
It's the same thing, but on a much larger scale, with the benefit of social media, that in this same talk in 2019, Marc Van Raan says, yeah, in 2009, we didn't have no social media like you do now.

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:55.551
Boy, I wish we did.

01:22:58.789 --> 01:22:59.509
But it worked.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:08.233
The Chatham House organization is also funded by all major corporations of the elite, the Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations.

01:23:10.174 --> 01:23:11.775
So you can find out all about that.

01:23:12.475 --> 01:23:15.236
So Mark Van Ronst gave his talk in October 2019.

01:23:15.276 --> 01:23:16.477
In 2015, Mary Holland was on Democracy Now!

01:23:16.497 --> 01:23:17.337
arguing with

01:23:24.879 --> 01:23:27.522
Paul Offit and on the same team as Rand Paul.

01:23:27.562 --> 01:23:27.983
So that's in 2015.

01:23:28.043 --> 01:23:28.984
In 2016 there is the movie Vaxxed.

01:23:29.024 --> 01:23:30.386
And in 2016 there's also Brandy Vaughn.

01:23:43.598 --> 01:23:44.798
Sorry about the late start, everybody.

01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:49.640
I think probably everybody in here faced the same traffic and parking issues that I did.

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:56.801
It's been a while since I've lived in San Francisco, and I must have forgot how close this zoo was to this area.

01:23:58.102 --> 01:24:02.063
If we could have the microphone turned up a little bit louder, who's that?

01:24:03.003 --> 01:24:05.084
I have no idea who I'm speaking to, sorry.

01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:08.164
And I don't know if anyone's even listening about that.

01:24:11.573 --> 01:24:14.974
I guess I'll just try to hold it as close as possible to my face.

01:24:18.015 --> 01:24:25.658
So first I want to thank everybody for coming out on such an amazing day and I hope that you find it helpful.

01:24:25.698 --> 01:24:26.358
I think you will.

01:24:27.038 --> 01:24:35.561
I know that everybody comes from a different background in terms of like what they consider health and what they consider health care in the U.S.

01:24:36.441 --> 01:24:38.102
and I'm pretty sure that

01:24:40.006 --> 01:24:46.988
There are people in here who probably know almost everything in all my slides, and I guarantee I'll blow your socks off with at least one of them.

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:53.871
And there are probably people in here who think I'm crazy, but they had nothing else to do, and it was too hot outside to do anything else.

01:24:55.451 --> 01:25:00.993
And I get called crazy a lot, and I'm going to tell you, in some ways I am.

01:25:02.287 --> 01:25:05.168
because I'm actually crazy enough to think that I can change the world.

01:25:06.128 --> 01:25:11.671
And I'm actually crazy enough to speak out against an industry that's larger than most small countries.

01:25:12.811 --> 01:25:19.413
And sometimes I go to sleep at night and I cry myself to sleep and I say, Jesus, what the heck am I doing?

01:25:19.453 --> 01:25:20.214
They don't make it easy.

01:25:21.094 --> 01:25:21.954
But I keep doing it.

01:25:22.275 --> 01:25:31.258
So I am clearly crazy enough to think that I can make some kind of difference in this world and that each one of us in here can make some kind of difference in this world.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.722
because we are not healthy as a society.

01:25:35.102 --> 01:25:40.326
I've been told for five years that thinking that you can change the world is a pretty dumb idea.

01:25:41.486 --> 01:25:43.248
I've been told that by a lot of people.

01:25:45.789 --> 01:25:46.410
I like her.

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:52.233
I like the cut of her jib, so to speak, here, where she thinks that she can change the world.

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:52.974
I like that.

01:25:54.488 --> 01:26:02.471
Because I do think it is true that people who stand up and dance when it's appropriate, even when no one else will, will eventually, can eventually get the whole crowd dancing.

01:26:04.172 --> 01:26:13.896
And I think that the truth, if presented at the right time, in the right circumstances, can run free in a way that none of these people could have ever known.

01:26:15.076 --> 01:26:21.959
And the memory of this now dead woman might end up being, you know, something worthwhile.

01:26:23.393 --> 01:26:28.395
Because remember, Mary Holland and Brandy Vaughn never became allies.

01:26:31.077 --> 01:26:34.779
CHD didn't have Brandy Vaughn in their vaxxed movie.

01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:41.242
I hate to tell you that, but we are not.

01:26:42.062 --> 01:26:43.883
And a lot of other countries are far healthier.

01:26:44.523 --> 01:26:47.565
So we're not doing things entirely right here.

01:26:48.373 --> 01:26:51.095
And we need to examine that, because our health is at stake.

01:26:51.496 --> 01:26:54.859
And if we don't have our health, what do we have, really?

01:26:55.079 --> 01:26:55.619
We have nothing.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:01.184
So I'm crazy to think I could change the world in some way, some small way.

01:27:01.745 --> 01:27:02.826
And I'm crazy for this one.

01:27:03.246 --> 01:27:04.948
And this is why I am here today.

01:27:05.628 --> 01:27:07.270
Because this is my five-year-old son.

01:27:08.111 --> 01:27:12.815
And he is surrounded by sick children.

01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:19.610
And not only sick children, but I'm surrounded by my friends that are getting sicker by the day.

01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:22.170
Autoimmune issues, neurological issues.

01:27:23.211 --> 01:27:27.872
I came back from Europe where things are done very differently, and I said, there's something wrong here.

01:27:29.633 --> 01:27:31.053
I want a better world for him.

01:27:31.653 --> 01:27:33.013
I want a healthier world.

01:27:33.714 --> 01:27:35.274
Not just for him, for all of us.

01:27:35.854 --> 01:27:37.735
For humanity, right?

01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:42.016
Because ultimately, on a bigger scale, we're talking about some big things in here.

01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:50.801
I'm gonna get into details, but this is a broader scale fight for humanity, for our rights in humanity, for our world, for the environment.

01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:52.142
All of it is connected.

01:27:53.783 --> 01:27:56.024
So I am, I'm crazy for this one too.

01:27:56.044 --> 01:27:58.405
So it's okay if you call me crazy.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:28:00.526
Just don't throw tomatoes at me because we're recording this.

01:28:00.566 --> 01:28:03.548
So if you could wait until after the Q&A session, that'd be awesome.

01:28:05.427 --> 01:28:07.208
So, how did I get here?

01:28:07.928 --> 01:28:14.551
Well, as you can imagine, not many people work in pharma and think, oh my gosh, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life speaking out against them.

01:28:15.272 --> 01:28:16.572
Yeah, it's not that fun.

01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:18.253
But I had a wake-up call.

01:28:19.414 --> 01:28:20.234
I sold Vioxx.

01:28:20.314 --> 01:28:21.575
Does anyone remember Vioxx?

01:28:23.476 --> 01:28:29.479
Yeah, well, a lot of people do because it became the largest drug recall in the U.S.

01:28:30.199 --> 01:28:31.400
I sold Vioxx for Merck.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.861
It was a pain reliever in arthritis medicine.

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.201
It was a blockbuster.

01:28:36.942 --> 01:28:39.163
It was very, very powerful.

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:42.205
So powerful that it killed people.

01:28:43.386 --> 01:28:46.888
And what came out was that Mark knew about that.

01:28:47.589 --> 01:28:59.977
My awakening came when we had materials on a study that was being conducted, and we were in doctor's offices, and we were talking about this study, and all of a sudden, we no longer talked about that study.

01:29:00.837 --> 01:29:03.039
All of a sudden, it was hush-hush.

01:29:03.803 --> 01:29:11.888
and our materials were confiscated, we had emergency trainings, and we were told not to ask questions, but if people asked us questions, this is what you say.

01:29:11.908 --> 01:29:18.152
Oh, no, that study was stopped because it was getting really expensive and all of these other things.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:22.275
No, the New York Times article that said it was killing people.

01:29:22.335 --> 01:29:26.157
No, no, no, that Pfizer rep is just blowing smoke in your face, right?

01:29:26.177 --> 01:29:32.161
I didn't fall for that, though, because I asked questions.

01:29:32.844 --> 01:29:38.046
And I said, wait a minute, this, you know, this seems a little shady.

01:29:38.767 --> 01:29:41.008
And at that time, I wasn't even selling drugs anymore.

01:29:41.028 --> 01:29:43.549
I was launching a stat for Merck.

01:29:44.549 --> 01:29:49.732
But I heard what was going on, and I saw it, and I heard it in the doctor's offices, and it scared me.

01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:59.896
Because I was brainwashed, just like most people in the US, just like most doctors, just like most people who are working in the pharmaceutical industry, to think that we're actually doing something good.

01:30:02.304 --> 01:30:08.189
When things like Vioxx happen, you realize that pharmaceutical companies, it's a business.

01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:16.676
In fact, well now it's a sell business, but it used to be a buy business for investors because it made money all the time.

01:30:17.797 --> 01:30:23.061
It was a consistently good investment because they profit off keeping us sick.

01:30:25.203 --> 01:30:29.427
So, Vioxx, three to four times increase in heart attack and stroke risk and death

01:30:29.898 --> 01:30:33.359
seen in the trials before it was even on the market.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:40.942
So during the discovery process of the lawsuits against Merck, it showed that Merck knew what was going on.

01:30:40.962 --> 01:30:51.867
They saw that, they filtered the data, you know, and they put it to the FDA and said, oh no, this, you know, it's great, it's powerful, and it decreases stomach ulcers.

01:30:52.207 --> 01:30:54.408
We're just not gonna mention all of this other stuff, right?

01:30:56.068 --> 01:30:57.589
It was on the market for five years.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:02.864
Hundreds of thousands of people died because of this drug.

01:31:03.445 --> 01:31:07.548
Now, interestingly, that would solve the population pyramid problem a little bit, right?

01:31:08.609 --> 01:31:09.891
You see where I'm going with this?

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:12.453
You see where people like Mark Hulak are going with this?

01:31:13.014 --> 01:31:23.824
That population pyramid problem is a problem that can be solved over many years with many different convenient myths, with many different convenient profit sources.

01:31:25.825 --> 01:31:28.186
I suspect that there's a lot of this going on.

01:31:28.266 --> 01:31:34.030
I suspect that that's the whole reason why the opioid crisis ever happened in the first place, and it's still happening now.

01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.672
And Merck paid out $6 billion in fines.

01:31:38.212 --> 01:31:41.394
They still made tens of billions off the drug.

01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:43.255
It was still a good investment.

01:31:43.795 --> 01:31:45.596
Nobody went to jail.

01:31:45.616 --> 01:31:52.980
500,000 dead, some say, if you look at the census records.

01:31:53.775 --> 01:31:55.996
It was clear to me that they were putting profit over people.

01:31:56.856 --> 01:32:04.879
And I thought, wow, everything I've been told, everything I've been taught to believe since I was little, to trust everybody in a white coat, right?

01:32:05.139 --> 01:32:06.079
Don't question them.

01:32:06.119 --> 01:32:07.359
They're far smarter than you.

01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:09.080
They know far more than you.

01:32:11.161 --> 01:32:15.202
Everything crashed because I finally realized that's not true.

01:32:15.682 --> 01:32:16.662
It's just not true.

01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:19.283
And we are not being told everything.

01:32:19.303 --> 01:32:22.044
We're not being told most of the stories.

01:32:23.723 --> 01:32:30.949
So, biggest thing I learned was that pharma makes money to bring us sick and not making us healthy.

01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:35.013
We don't have a health care system in this country.

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:40.718
We have a sick care system, which is focused on treating symptoms with drugs.

01:32:41.499 --> 01:32:45.282
And drugs are chemicals, toxic chemicals.

01:32:45.962 --> 01:32:48.665
So when we look at the health in the United States,

01:32:49.045 --> 01:32:53.488
We are seeing epidemic rates, skyrocketing rates of autoimmune issues.

01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:56.129
We're seeing skyrocketing rates of chronic illness.

01:32:56.349 --> 01:32:59.912
We're seeing skyrocketing rates of things that are degenerative.

01:33:00.012 --> 01:33:07.476
Now make sure that you hear what I hear is that she's not going to be the one who would argue for repurposed drugs for a novel virus.

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:16.662
She's not the one that would argue for a combination of silicoxib and ivermectin for a novel virus because those are also chemicals.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:34.969
chemicals that for sure in combination we can't know what they do, yet all these doctors that are pushing all these repurposed drugs now from 2021 on or whenever it really started in earnest, are always pushing combinations.

01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:44.134
As if they understand what these combinations do or whether any of the components are responsible for any of the outcomes.

01:33:45.316 --> 01:34:11.309
Certainly they've never offered any mechanistic explanations for why these combinations are so interesting So she's already saying things that are completely antithetical to the standard approach that Brett Weinstein and Meryl Nass and and Pierre Cory and and Steve Kirsch and and Robert Malone have all been

01:34:12.369 --> 01:34:17.913
pushing from the beginning, which is that there's this whole catalog of stuff on our, on our shelves.

01:34:17.953 --> 01:34:21.615
And we should start trying stuff for this novel thing.

01:34:26.399 --> 01:34:28.500
Diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus.

01:34:29.461 --> 01:34:31.322
Now we're seeing them in children.

01:34:32.883 --> 01:34:34.264
This is not okay.

01:34:35.025 --> 01:34:36.426
Clearly we're doing something wrong.

01:34:37.787 --> 01:34:40.909
And I know it's a harder pill to swallow,

01:34:42.436 --> 01:34:45.658
But Pharma makes money keeping us sick.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.663
And the doctors are part of that system, most of the time unknowingly.

01:34:52.723 --> 01:34:57.306
But if they question, their entire life crashes down on them.

01:34:59.448 --> 01:35:00.609
So, don't believe me.

01:35:01.009 --> 01:35:02.750
Actually, hear it from the horse's mouth, right?

01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:09.135
So, Pharma CEO, Valiant Pharmaceuticals, J. Michael Pearson says,

01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:11.071
He's caught speaking the truth.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:15.373
We're in the business of shareholder profit, not helping the sick.

01:35:16.754 --> 01:35:17.714
Guess where he is now?

01:35:19.295 --> 01:35:21.556
He's no longer heading that company, I'll tell you that.

01:35:21.616 --> 01:35:22.976
Probably retired in Mexico.

01:35:25.738 --> 01:35:28.499
So how are they doing on their quest to keep us sick?

01:35:29.899 --> 01:35:30.560
Pretty scary.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:38.443
We are one of the sickest developed countries in the world, and this is not healthcare, or lack of access to medical care, oh no.

01:35:39.517 --> 01:35:40.457
That's not what's happening.

01:35:41.718 --> 01:35:45.259
Cancer, one in every three men will die of cancer, one in every four women.

01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.361
One in 12 women now have an autoimmune issue.

01:35:48.881 --> 01:35:58.205
Lupus, chronic fatigue, arthritis, fibromyalgia, gut issues, asthma, food allergies, all of these things are autoimmune issues.

01:35:58.565 --> 01:36:02.627
Leukemia, type 1 diabetes, 60 million have allergies.

01:36:03.602 --> 01:36:04.662
30 million have asthma.

01:36:05.202 --> 01:36:09.663
Do you know that in Europe, they think it's kind of crazy that we're allergic to the food we eat?

01:36:10.543 --> 01:36:13.344
They think it's a little bit crazy that we're allergic to the air we breathe.

01:36:13.864 --> 01:36:15.804
You know, hay fever, seasonal allergies.

01:36:16.964 --> 01:36:21.305
These things didn't used to happen 30, 40 years ago, not like it is now.

01:36:21.665 --> 01:36:30.727
This is a new normal in the US, and it's not normal, and it should never be considered normal, because it's a sign of immune damage, immune system damage.

01:36:31.584 --> 01:36:37.687
Dementia, Alzheimer's, MS, diabetes, lupus, ALS, all skyrocketing.

01:36:38.807 --> 01:36:42.009
And cancer is now the leading cause of death in children.

01:36:42.549 --> 01:36:46.851
Okay, cancer used to be one of those diseases which, you know, older people get, right?

01:36:46.931 --> 01:36:53.694
As things, you know, we've been under a huge exposure of toxins throughout our lifetime, things would just start slowing down.

01:36:54.114 --> 01:36:55.494
No, not anymore.

01:36:55.855 --> 01:36:56.755
Not in our country.

01:36:57.775 --> 01:36:59.216
And this has to change.

01:36:59.896 --> 01:37:01.157
And the system's not gonna change it.

01:37:02.853 --> 01:37:03.453
It's up to us.

01:37:04.054 --> 01:37:04.254
The U.S.

01:37:04.294 --> 01:37:07.916
has some of the highest rates of chronic illness and disorders in the developed world.

01:37:08.076 --> 01:37:10.478
One in three people now have a chronic issue.

01:37:10.498 --> 01:37:11.839
A chronic issue.

01:37:12.279 --> 01:37:13.380
We are sick.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.841
We are really sick.

01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:17.442
And it's not just the food we eat.

01:37:17.522 --> 01:37:18.843
It's not just the air we breathe.

01:37:19.424 --> 01:37:21.485
It's everything that we are exposed to.

01:37:21.785 --> 01:37:27.829
Now make sure that you understand that at this time, when Vaxxed comes out, that's not the message of Vaxxed.

01:37:29.619 --> 01:37:40.521
The message of Vaxxed is specifically that a component of the MMR vaccine might be responsible for some of the autism that's shown in the movie.

01:37:43.922 --> 01:37:55.824
The message is the HPV vaccine really hurts teenagers in the second movie, but we're not addressing the gigantic, you know, the totality of it all.

01:37:56.865 --> 01:37:58.425
The poisoning of society,

01:37:59.656 --> 01:38:02.358
the corruption of our healthcare.

01:38:02.378 --> 01:38:14.025
It's a very, actually quite tight focus, despite the name Children's Health Defense, despite the name, the Informed Consent Action Network.

01:38:19.288 --> 01:38:21.130
She's telling you that it's all broken.

01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.111
She's telling you that these are all poisons.

01:38:24.192 --> 01:38:26.293
She's telling you that everything is wrong.

01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:38.576
And they got around to saying it 10 years later, kind of, sorta, with Cali means and with some other newly inserted performers.

01:38:39.277 --> 01:38:40.357
This lady's dead.

01:38:42.258 --> 01:38:43.619
She was probably murdered.

01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:57.106
Everything we put into our body, everything we put on our body as well, body care products, all of that, the chemicals that we use to clean our pans in our house,

01:38:58.242 --> 01:39:05.527
The new car smell, you know, the leather seats, you know, those smells, perfume, it's all chemicals.

01:39:06.287 --> 01:39:09.469
And we are under too much toxic chemical exposure.

01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:12.431
And a lot of it is the meds as well.

01:39:13.992 --> 01:39:22.658
So, we're far sicker than most developed countries, yet we spend more per capita on healthcare than any other country in the world.

01:39:24.659 --> 01:39:31.144
Washington Post article, once again, the US has the most expensive healthcare system, but least effective.

01:39:31.984 --> 01:39:34.826
We are dead last in the developed world, despite spending more.

01:39:36.047 --> 01:39:36.908
Something's wrong here.

01:39:37.968 --> 01:39:39.109
We're not being told everything.

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:47.535
So, what we need to understand is that the system is focused on treating symptoms with drugs and medical interventions.

01:39:47.675 --> 01:39:49.897
Don't even get me started on unnecessary surgeries.

01:39:51.607 --> 01:39:54.569
We ignore the cause of the problem.

01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:59.233
We ignore the cause and the root of the issue.

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:07.099
So how are we ever gonna become healthy or healthier if all we're doing is touching the tip of the iceberg?

01:40:07.699 --> 01:40:12.443
And then a lot of times when we're treating the symptoms with certain drugs, there's side effects to those drugs.

01:40:12.783 --> 01:40:14.724
So they just write you another pill, right?

01:40:15.385 --> 01:40:20.809
And then we end up, as we are now, the most drugged up country in the world.

01:40:22.423 --> 01:40:26.864
So if we continue to ignore the root of the problem, we're never going to be healthy.

01:40:28.784 --> 01:40:33.045
Now, if you take one thing away from this talk, it's this.

01:40:33.285 --> 01:40:36.046
The pharmaceutical industry does not create cures.

01:40:36.946 --> 01:40:38.166
They create customers.

01:40:39.307 --> 01:40:49.769
So when you're doing your annual donations at the end of the year, understand that we need to be funding prevention services and groups that are not

01:40:50.339 --> 01:40:52.260
funneling all that money into a laboratory.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.702
Because the pharmaceutical industry is never going to allow cures for these diseases.

01:40:58.302 --> 01:40:59.403
They would go out of business.

01:41:01.104 --> 01:41:01.984
It's a business.

01:41:02.224 --> 01:41:03.444
They create customers.

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:09.327
This was my favorite Huffington Post article from last year.

01:41:09.347 --> 01:41:13.949
Drugs you don't need for disorders you don't have, right?

01:41:14.707 --> 01:41:19.148
We're trained, when there's one small thing wrong in our body, we're trained to go to the doctor.

01:41:19.468 --> 01:41:27.950
And the doctor doesn't wanna just sit there and be like, mm, I don't know what's going on, and I can't help you, you're here, you're paying him money, right?

01:41:28.190 --> 01:41:29.490
He wants to tell you something.

01:41:30.091 --> 01:41:33.251
So he thinks, okay, let's see, maybe you have this.

01:41:33.711 --> 01:41:36.692
So let's just, we'll write you a prescription.

01:41:37.192 --> 01:41:38.833
Oh, your heart was beating a little fast.

01:41:38.933 --> 01:41:39.833
Oh, you have anxiety.

01:41:39.873 --> 01:41:42.674
Here's two different medications you can try.

01:41:43.314 --> 01:41:44.234
They are trained.

01:41:44.608 --> 01:41:49.811
to give the patient something that they think might help.

01:41:50.251 --> 01:41:52.992
Well, what does the pharmaceutical company tell the doctors is gonna help?

01:41:53.492 --> 01:41:54.993
It's these drugs, right?

01:41:57.554 --> 01:41:58.495
America on drugs.

01:41:58.795 --> 01:42:06.839
This is what happens when the pharmaceutical industries are so infiltrated into what we consider healthcare when it's really sick care.

01:42:06.859 --> 01:42:08.960
60% of Americans are on prescription drugs.

01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:10.520
15% are on five or more.

01:42:12.076 --> 01:42:17.599
The average American fills 12 prescription meds per year, per year, 12.

01:42:17.759 --> 01:42:19.040
That's one a month.

01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.801
So what happens?

01:42:22.381 --> 01:42:38.890
Well, prescription drugs legally written correctly taken are now the fourth leading cause of death in the U S fourth leading cause of death in the U S prescription drugs, not heroin, not Coke prescription drugs correctly taken.

01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:41.131
That's pretty remarkable.

01:42:42.543 --> 01:42:43.883
That's pretty remarkable.

01:42:45.744 --> 01:42:57.506
I mean, do you know what the third cause of death is in the U S anyone medical malpractice, medical errors, medical errors.

01:42:58.307 --> 01:43:03.748
We have a healthcare system that's literally killing us, literally killing us.

01:43:05.723 --> 01:43:07.224
And they're laughing all the way to the bank.

01:43:07.704 --> 01:43:09.586
You can see why she needed to be offed.

01:43:10.126 --> 01:43:11.447
She couldn't be around for this.

01:43:11.507 --> 01:43:14.930
She couldn't be part of the dissidents for the pandemic.

01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:16.971
Otherwise, she would be a leader.

01:43:17.451 --> 01:43:20.113
She has the track record to be a leader.

01:43:20.213 --> 01:43:23.756
So she could not be allowed to be a leader at the start of the pandemic.

01:43:23.816 --> 01:43:24.657
Of course not.

01:43:26.118 --> 01:43:27.579
Mary Holland is the leader.

01:43:28.099 --> 01:43:29.260
RFK is the leader.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:31.141
Meryl Nass is the leader.

01:43:31.942 --> 01:43:33.423
Kevin McKernan is the leader.

01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:37.392
And a year and a half later, Robert Malone would be the leader.

01:43:39.814 --> 01:43:41.255
She could have been the leader.

01:43:41.295 --> 01:43:42.676
That's why they had to get rid of her.

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:45.738
The indoctrination starts early.

01:43:46.358 --> 01:43:52.582
So doctors, most have completely good intentions.

01:43:52.642 --> 01:43:56.065
They want to get into it because they think that they can change the world.

01:43:56.085 --> 01:43:57.826
They think they can make people healthier.

01:43:58.567 --> 01:44:00.488
But when they start medical school,

01:44:00.993 --> 01:44:05.577
What most doctors don't understand is medical schools are now controlled by pharma.

01:44:05.617 --> 01:44:08.880
In fact, they should be renamed pharma schools because that's what they are.

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:15.145
200 Harvard medical students demanded pharma out of their administration, out of their school.

01:44:15.185 --> 01:44:18.888
They went to the administration at Harvard and said, get the industry out.

01:44:19.768 --> 01:44:20.489
Do you know what happened?

01:44:22.291 --> 01:44:23.251
Absolutely nothing.

01:44:24.392 --> 01:44:25.613
Absolutely nothing.

01:44:26.214 --> 01:44:28.736
The New York Times wrote an article on it, but it went nowhere.

01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:34.205
And in fact, in the Ivy League schools, there is more pharma money than other universities.

01:44:36.847 --> 01:44:37.888
Big money in research.

01:44:38.508 --> 01:44:44.613
But Brandy, you know, the medical research, scientific research says that these drugs are good for us.

01:44:45.013 --> 01:44:46.094
Who's doing those studies?

01:44:46.114 --> 01:44:48.375
Pharma.

01:44:49.096 --> 01:44:50.517
A lot of people don't understand.

01:44:50.537 --> 01:44:52.759
FDA does not do studies.

01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:56.982
The Food and Drug Administration, that is our regulatory agency, they don't do studies.

01:44:57.765 --> 01:45:01.510
They review studies done by pharmacies.

01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:03.672
She's way too far ahead of the narrative, right?

01:45:03.712 --> 01:45:07.256
They weren't supposed to stay this and complain about the FDA until 2024.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.665
She's like eight years ahead of this controlled demolition of America.

01:45:14.745 --> 01:45:16.567
She was really going to screw it up.

01:45:17.489 --> 01:45:28.472
It was up to Kevin McKernan to go on in 2020 and say that the FDA is in the way and we could have ended the pandemic if they weren't making us fill out 10 pages of forms for our EUAs.

01:45:30.052 --> 01:45:31.212
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

01:45:32.373 --> 01:45:35.293
You can see it very clearly if you hear it from the right person.

01:45:36.754 --> 01:45:41.035
They often, they're so understaffed, they don't go visit the test sites.

01:45:41.115 --> 01:45:43.895
They don't go visit the sites where the drugs are being tested.

01:45:44.415 --> 01:45:46.756
They rely on pharmaceutical companies, to be honest,

01:45:47.742 --> 01:45:49.503
But are pharmaceutical companies honest?

01:45:50.784 --> 01:45:51.344
They are not.

01:45:51.744 --> 01:45:54.766
From my experience, they are anything but honest.

01:45:55.246 --> 01:45:57.387
But they do have a darn good marketing spin.

01:45:59.048 --> 01:46:08.393
So nearly 75% of all scientific studies on safety and efficacy of pharma drugs are at least partially funded, most fully funded, by the company that benefits.

01:46:08.933 --> 01:46:09.573
And guess what?

01:46:10.133 --> 01:46:14.936
If there's a study that's underway and it's not showing positive results,

01:46:15.994 --> 01:46:18.935
Or maybe there are some doctors that are pushing back.

01:46:19.856 --> 01:46:20.376
Guess what?

01:46:20.856 --> 01:46:24.277
They can stop it without alerting the FDA.

01:46:25.558 --> 01:46:29.659
They can stop it completely, and there's no regulations that they have to tell the FDA that.

01:46:29.999 --> 01:46:30.960
Merck did it with BIOPS.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:37.062
So, it's a really skewed system.

01:46:38.562 --> 01:46:39.263
Studies that are,

01:46:41.354 --> 01:46:46.536
meta-analysis studies, the big thing in science, and everybody's like, oh, the science supports this.

01:46:47.016 --> 01:46:49.036
We have to look where that science is coming from.

01:46:49.557 --> 01:46:53.278
Because there are some independent researchers that will buff the system, but guess what?

01:46:53.678 --> 01:46:59.160
They run out of grant funding very quickly, unfortunately, when they go up against the system.

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.460
Sometimes it's career suicide.

01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:04.901
So we aren't seeing a lot, but we are seeing some.

01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:09.823
We are seeing some amazing researchers and scientists come out, and doctors come out and say,

01:47:10.253 --> 01:47:11.674
Things are definitely wrong.

01:47:12.914 --> 01:47:24.361
Meta-analysis as well, 80% of meta-analysis studies, which are the studies that take a broad range, maybe hundreds of studies, and they try to find correlations, and they say, oh, they're more independent because it's a broad range of studies.

01:47:24.381 --> 01:47:32.845
80% of meta-analysis studies for the antidepressant industry, the antidepressant sector, had industry ties.

01:47:33.325 --> 01:47:34.866
Some of them were not even disclosed.

01:47:36.767 --> 01:47:38.268
But again, don't listen to me.

01:47:38.648 --> 01:47:39.829
I'm just the messenger, right?

01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:43.852
There are some amazing people doing a lot of work behind the scenes to expose this.

01:47:44.493 --> 01:47:47.955
And Dr. Richard Horton is the current editor-in-chief of The Lancet.

01:47:48.035 --> 01:47:50.857
It is one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.

01:47:51.457 --> 01:47:52.137
Current editor.

01:47:52.518 --> 01:47:58.061
And he wrote in 2015 of Editor's Letters saying, the case against science is straightforward.

01:47:58.401 --> 01:48:02.103
Much of scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.

01:48:02.544 --> 01:48:02.824
Why?

01:48:03.264 --> 01:48:07.707
Because of flagrant conflicts of interest and bias in the study results.

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:18.196
What about the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration that's supposed to be regulating, that we pay with our tax dollars to regulate the system, right?

01:48:18.596 --> 01:48:19.757
Regulate the industries.

01:48:21.319 --> 01:48:23.120
They are severely underfunded.

01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:28.664
The FDA, this is a nominee, but he's now running the FDA.

01:48:28.804 --> 01:48:29.965
It's Dr. Califf.

01:48:30.466 --> 01:48:38.472
He was Obama's selection, and unfortunately, even though the Congress did not want to approve him, it went through.

01:48:39.076 --> 01:48:47.462
He ran Duke's medical research at the Duke University, multimillion dollar clinical research center.

01:48:48.542 --> 01:48:51.865
It took 60% of its funding from the industry.

01:48:52.365 --> 01:49:01.551
So this is medical research center taking 60% of its funding from the industry that it's supposed to be independently studying and researching on.

01:49:02.392 --> 01:49:04.493
He himself had a conflict of interest section

01:49:05.617 --> 01:49:11.460
stating that he has worked as a consultant and taken consulting fees from more than 20 pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

01:49:12.261 --> 01:49:18.424
He is the ultimate industry insider, and he is now heading up our regulatory agency that we pay for with our tax dollars.

01:49:19.404 --> 01:49:24.627
He's famous for a quote that says, regulation provides a barrier to disruptive innovation.

01:49:26.068 --> 01:49:28.549
He doesn't believe in regulation, and he's now heading up

01:49:30.069 --> 01:49:42.278
Now remember that Mary Holland was on the Bannon show just a few days ago talking about how RFK would allow innovation in health care and included AI in that innovation.

01:49:42.779 --> 01:49:55.089
Here is Brandy Vaughn, 10 years ago, warning us that the word innovation was being used to describe all of the nasty plans that they have.

01:49:56.490 --> 01:49:57.591
Government regulatory agency.

01:49:58.837 --> 01:49:59.598
This scares me.

01:50:00.038 --> 01:50:03.562
This really scares me because I don't see this as a sign that things are getting better.

01:50:04.102 --> 01:50:05.884
We cannot trust the system to change.

01:50:07.485 --> 01:50:10.488
There's a revolving door between the FDA and Big Pharma.

01:50:10.969 --> 01:50:13.111
It's severely underfunded, it's understaffed.

01:50:13.571 --> 01:50:22.000
If you behave and do well in FDA, and by behave it means don't cause any too much trouble, don't, you know, talk about

01:50:23.038 --> 01:50:30.520
you know, bad safety or actually don't regulate anything at all, then you're going to get a great job in pharma or academia afterwards.

01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:32.881
If you speak out, your career is over.

01:50:33.081 --> 01:50:33.901
You're blacklisted.

01:50:35.542 --> 01:50:44.144
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control, which is responsible for things like our vaccine schedule, it is just as bad.

01:50:44.184 --> 01:50:47.385
In fact, Julie Gerberdinger, Julie Gerberdinger,

01:50:49.008 --> 01:51:00.252
She ran the CDC for seven years and in the last decade, and she doubled the childhood vaccine schedule under her tenure.

01:51:00.732 --> 01:51:05.354
There were also some really shady studies that came out while she was there at the CDC.

01:51:05.494 --> 01:51:09.735
There's CDC Whistleblower, which was the subject of the documentary Vax.

01:51:09.855 --> 01:51:16.418
I would be willing to bet that my friend Housatonic Live has a very nice page on Julie Gerberding.

01:51:16.618 --> 01:51:17.518
I bet that's true.

01:51:19.025 --> 01:51:23.367
who is a senior scientist there, saying that there is fraud going on.

01:51:23.887 --> 01:51:28.130
There is fraud going on with the studies that are being done at the CDC.

01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:32.872
He is now silenced through federal whistleblower status.

01:51:32.912 --> 01:51:34.153
Congress has not interviewed him.

01:51:35.213 --> 01:51:38.575
There is serious fraud going on here.

01:51:39.235 --> 01:51:41.716
And people are part of the problem.

01:51:41.756 --> 01:51:42.897
The CDC is part of the problem.

01:51:45.687 --> 01:51:51.633
I think she might actually be talking about the whistleblower that eventually spoke to Brian Hooker, but I'm not for sure about that.

01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:58.824
There are two Merck scientists also suing Merck right now for fraud.

01:51:59.044 --> 01:52:00.865
There is a lot of fraud going on.

01:52:00.966 --> 01:52:09.433
Don't forget that Vincent Rancinello's wife, Rancinello's wife, worked for Merck on Ivermectin for 20 years before the pandemic.

01:52:09.453 --> 01:52:10.394
That's an interesting thing.

01:52:10.634 --> 01:52:20.142
In this industry and with the government agencies that are supposed to be regulating it, that are supposed to be independent, that are supposed to be paid by our tax dollars.

01:52:20.462 --> 01:52:22.644
And yet, industry money is getting in there.

01:52:24.366 --> 01:52:27.727
So, this is interesting.

01:52:27.747 --> 01:52:32.488
Pharma spends more on marketing its products than it does on research and development.

01:52:33.148 --> 01:52:45.932
So, you know, if it was really focused, if it was an industry focused on keeping us healthy and really finding the root of the problem and really addressing things, their research and development budget would be the highest priority.

01:52:46.718 --> 01:52:59.208
They're spending six to ten times more marketing their products, putting it on television, convincing you you have a disorder you probably don't have, so that you'll go to the doctor and ask for a pill you don't need.

01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:03.652
They spend more on marketing than research and development.

01:53:04.453 --> 01:53:06.434
Six times, according to the Huffington Post.

01:53:07.635 --> 01:53:08.936
It's all about the money.

01:53:09.417 --> 01:53:10.638
Why don't you hear about this on TV?

01:53:11.738 --> 01:53:22.306
Well, the US is one of the few countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to consumers in newspapers and magazines, on television.

01:53:22.727 --> 01:53:26.029
They're the second largest advertiser on television.

01:53:26.249 --> 01:53:31.954
$5.2 billion in 2015 on direct advertising to consumers.

01:53:31.974 --> 01:53:35.276
40% of advertising dollars are controlled by pharma.

01:53:35.917 --> 01:53:40.000
So this allows pharmaceutical companies to control what we're hearing.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:45.801
The advertising in the media, they're not going to bite the hand that feeds them, right?

01:53:46.421 --> 01:53:53.823
So they just get these ghost-written articles and studies from pharma, and that's the latest headline on the news.

01:53:54.263 --> 01:53:58.584
Oh, new promising cancer research into this area, colon cancer.

01:53:58.804 --> 01:54:00.765
You know, studies are underway, right?

01:54:01.225 --> 01:54:02.025
It's marketing.

01:54:02.565 --> 01:54:04.666
It's a press release that they're reading from.

01:54:05.188 --> 01:54:08.250
It is not independent journalism anymore in this country, unfortunately.

01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:14.513
There are some independent journalists that have left that system and said, uh-uh, this is not right.

01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:16.054
This is not independent.

01:54:16.154 --> 01:54:21.317
We are doing a disservice to journalism because this is really marketing for corporations.

01:54:21.777 --> 01:54:29.902
Cheryl Atkinson is one of the, is someone you should all follow because she's amazing and she stepped outside of that system and she lost her career.

01:54:30.302 --> 01:54:31.523
John Rappaport is another one.

01:54:32.463 --> 01:54:33.063
Interesting, wow.

01:54:33.083 --> 01:54:33.804
But you know what?

01:54:34.753 --> 01:54:36.614
Listen, honey, you're not fooling anyone.

01:54:37.354 --> 01:54:47.918
We're gonna wake up, right, with events like this, as soon as this information gets out there, and with all of these people that I've mentioned that are working behind the scenes to expose this kind of corruption, right?

01:54:48.599 --> 01:54:50.239
They're not gonna fool us for long, right?

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:54.261
They're not gonna fool us for long, is what she said in 2016.

01:54:54.301 --> 01:54:54.681
You can see how

01:54:58.288 --> 01:55:07.294
As much as she knows and as much as she can see, she too underestimates how committed these people are to doing it.

01:55:07.354 --> 01:55:13.619
She can't see that Twitter and Gab and Telegram and Locals and Rumble

01:55:15.307 --> 01:55:16.628
are gonna show up on the scene.

01:55:16.688 --> 01:55:20.150
She can't see that podcasters are gonna show up on the scene.

01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:31.436
She might not even be able to see that CHD is coming, and ICANN is coming, and Vaxxed is coming, and what they will do to dilute this, you know, we're all gonna eventually see it thing.

01:55:32.297 --> 01:55:33.157
Holy cow.

01:55:35.799 --> 01:55:41.142
And medical science has made such tremendous progress, there's hardly a healthy human left.

01:55:42.805 --> 01:55:44.105
I love this.

01:55:44.125 --> 01:55:45.906
This was foreseen, right?

01:55:46.466 --> 01:55:55.008
Medical science looks very, very different than what we're told when we're children, than what it looked like 30 years ago.

01:55:56.088 --> 01:55:57.949
I wish it wasn't that way.

01:55:58.449 --> 01:56:00.249
I wish I didn't have to do events like this.

01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:05.470
I wish I didn't have to, you know, spend my life traveling the road getting this information out there.

01:56:06.291 --> 01:56:08.851
I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.

01:56:12.551 --> 01:56:14.973
there to be healthy humans left, and I want us to have a choice.

01:56:16.033 --> 01:56:19.576
And a lot of people ask me, Brady, how did you end up speaking out?

01:56:20.116 --> 01:56:24.920
I started speaking out when I saw that they were trying to take that choice away from us.

01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:33.986
Take away that choice to say no, and to keep our health, and decide what health looks like to us, and to step outside of that system.

01:56:34.647 --> 01:56:40.471
And once they take that choice away, again, there will be hardly a healthy human left.

01:56:42.014 --> 01:56:47.159
So we're now one of the most drugged up countries in the world and one of the sickest.

01:56:48.139 --> 01:56:51.843
But the prescription drug market is saturated, right?

01:56:52.303 --> 01:56:54.285
They're having a really hard time creating

01:56:55.077 --> 01:56:59.458
new drugs because they're having a hard time creating new diseases, right?

01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:03.479
They already have labels for almost everything you can walk into a doctor's office with, right?

01:57:03.599 --> 01:57:05.419
Oh, I broke my hair here.

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.279
Something may be wrong, you know?

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.200
Oh, well, maybe, well, it could be lupus.

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.760
Oh, that's one of the symptoms of lupus.

01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:15.221
You know, not all doctors are like this, okay?

01:57:15.401 --> 01:57:17.902
But unfortunately, too many are.

01:57:18.562 --> 01:57:18.802
And it's

01:57:20.558 --> 01:57:22.940
They're having a hard time creating new diseases and disorders.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.683
And the pharmaceutical industry, it's very competitive.

01:57:28.043 --> 01:57:33.427
They have to spend 5.2 billion a year marketing because there are a lot of drugs in each category state.

01:57:34.448 --> 01:57:35.729
And there's high liability.

01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:38.511
Look at, Vioxx was pulled off the market.

01:57:38.791 --> 01:57:40.472
There were class action lawsuits.

01:57:41.093 --> 01:57:43.194
The US government sued them for fraud.

01:57:43.514 --> 01:57:44.675
There's high liability.

01:57:45.155 --> 01:57:46.536
And it takes high investment.

01:57:46.576 --> 01:57:51.780
You have to be able to invest in the drug trials when you're not even sure that it's gonna be on market, right?

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:57.283
So there are a lot of high barriers to coming on market and to getting new drugs on the market.

01:57:57.923 --> 01:58:03.127
But vaccines are a whole new category.

01:58:03.863 --> 01:58:06.685
of money and market to be made.

01:58:07.566 --> 01:58:13.490
So I have to talk about this because this is where they're going next.

01:58:14.931 --> 01:58:23.077
Because for all of those diseases and all of those disorders they've created, there's already six, seven pills on the market for it, right?

01:58:23.097 --> 01:58:25.199
And your patent expires in 10 years.

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:26.680
But

01:58:27.512 --> 01:58:29.253
What if we created vaccines for them?

01:58:29.874 --> 01:58:30.174
Right?

01:58:30.454 --> 01:58:32.996
It's such a weird quote for Aldous Huxley.

01:58:33.477 --> 01:58:39.141
Medical science has made such tremendous progress that there is hardly a healthy human left.

01:58:42.083 --> 01:58:44.745
His son, Julian Huxley, or is that his brother?

01:58:44.765 --> 01:58:46.847
Is it his brother or his son?

01:58:47.668 --> 01:58:54.453
Julian Huxley wrote one of the articles and the introduction to Man and His Future, a great book that everybody should find.

01:58:55.562 --> 01:58:57.323
purchased by the Siba Foundation.

01:58:57.343 --> 01:59:03.828
There's a great article in here from Herman Muller and also a great article in here from a guy by the name of Hilary Koprowski.

01:59:03.848 --> 01:59:06.069
There's just a lot of really good stuff in here.

01:59:06.089 --> 01:59:10.412
I think also maybe... who else wrote in this book?

01:59:10.752 --> 01:59:11.813
Interesting book it is.

01:59:11.873 --> 01:59:13.074
It's just a great book.

01:59:13.834 --> 01:59:21.859
I think I have like six copies of it because I think it's so important for the future to preserve these things.

01:59:24.642 --> 01:59:26.344
Hilary Koprowski's in here.

01:59:27.806 --> 01:59:29.528
Sir Julian Huxley is in here.

01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:31.471
Herman Muller is in here.

01:59:31.591 --> 01:59:34.975
Joshua Lederberg, I've heard of that guy before, he's also in here.

01:59:37.538 --> 01:59:42.445
Quite frankly, I think this is one of the most extraordinary books that nobody talks about except for Mark and I.

01:59:43.411 --> 01:59:47.772
and Uwe Altschner from Germany, who introduced me to this book, actually.

01:59:47.792 --> 01:59:48.452
Thank you very much.

01:59:48.512 --> 02:00:00.075
Shout out to Uwe, whose interview on Substack and on German radio just went out last week on the 30th or the 29th or whatever the Friday was of January.

02:00:00.095 --> 02:00:02.816
If you haven't seen it, check that out, because it's really, really good.

02:00:03.076 --> 02:00:05.576
And called it preventative healthcare.

02:00:06.577 --> 02:00:08.277
That is where they're gonna make their money next.

02:00:10.118 --> 02:00:11.378
It's his brother, okay, thanks.

02:00:13.735 --> 02:00:19.634
So I always get, well, so when I started studying vaccines after my son was born,

02:00:21.025 --> 02:00:24.007
What I found was even worse than what I found with Vioxx.

02:00:24.707 --> 02:00:26.528
And I saw that all go down from the inside.

02:00:27.309 --> 02:00:30.590
How did I get to starting studying vaccines?

02:00:31.171 --> 02:00:32.451
Because I had my son in Europe.

02:00:32.752 --> 02:00:37.154
So after I worked for Merck, I left before Vioxx was even pulled off the market.

02:00:38.235 --> 02:00:40.316
And I ended up moving to Europe.

02:00:40.856 --> 02:00:44.738
And I saw how healthcare was done totally differently over there.

02:00:45.058 --> 02:00:47.720
Okay, so I'm getting a little chills right now because

02:00:56.772 --> 02:01:00.933
Because we had our kids in Norway, our two boys.

02:01:03.613 --> 02:01:06.294
And when we had our daughter in America, we should have known better.

02:01:09.775 --> 02:01:13.475
We could have known better because I was on this train.

02:01:13.555 --> 02:01:15.036
I was solving this mystery.

02:01:15.116 --> 02:01:20.097
I was about to figure it all out, but I didn't know then because in 2022, in 2021, in 2020,

02:01:29.193 --> 02:01:34.016
In 2019, in 2018, in 2017, I didn't know who CHD was.

02:01:34.097 --> 02:01:36.398
I didn't know that the vaccine schedule was weird.

02:01:38.439 --> 02:01:49.146
It wasn't until my daughter was actually born and I watched them inject her twice and wondered, what in the hell is going on here?

02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.721
And I'm going to be ashamed for the rest of my life.

02:02:02.342 --> 02:02:09.085
So she's not a person who's come to this fight because she has a damaged kid.

02:02:11.686 --> 02:02:16.188
She's a person that came to this fight because she was paying attention as a responsible adult.

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:19.769
And when she moved to Europe, she found exactly the same thing that I did.

02:02:27.429 --> 02:02:28.130
It's remarkable.

02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:32.652
And I know this is going to sound like a crazy story, but I swear this is a true story.

02:02:33.493 --> 02:02:34.674
I have hay fever, right?

02:02:35.254 --> 02:02:38.516
I was vaccinated and I've had vaccine damage done.

02:02:38.616 --> 02:02:40.618
I got IBS from a hep B vaccine when I was 24.

02:02:42.919 --> 02:02:45.421
I am allergic to pollen in the air, right?

02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:47.542
It's better now that I've done a lot of detox.

02:02:48.103 --> 02:02:56.008
We'll go into that a little bit later, but I went into a doctor's office in Amsterdam when I moved over there and I said, can I get a prescription for Allegra?

02:02:56.866 --> 02:02:58.547
She moved over to Amsterdam.

02:02:58.587 --> 02:02:59.287
That's so cool.

02:02:59.327 --> 02:03:01.288
That's the first place that I moved to too.

02:03:01.348 --> 02:03:01.549
Wow.

02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:06.151
That's, that is, this is such a weird video.

02:03:06.711 --> 02:03:08.913
And they, he said, what's that?

02:03:08.933 --> 02:03:10.113
And I'm like, well, I have hay fever.

02:03:10.433 --> 02:03:12.294
And he said, hay fever.

02:03:12.655 --> 02:03:14.375
I'm like, yeah, I'm allergic to pollen in the air.

02:03:14.476 --> 02:03:16.517
He's like, you're allergic to plants.

02:03:17.857 --> 02:03:18.198
Okay.

02:03:18.778 --> 02:03:19.078
Right.

02:03:19.678 --> 02:03:23.781
If you think about it from an outside perspective, seems a little odd, doesn't it?

02:03:24.681 --> 02:03:26.222
So he's like, you're allergic to

02:03:26.909 --> 02:03:30.773
Plants in the air that we breathe that we need to breathe to survive.

02:03:31.453 --> 02:03:35.637
I'm like Yeah, and he says hmm.

02:03:35.997 --> 02:03:38.580
Are you sure you're not allergic to oil and gas?

02:03:39.521 --> 02:03:45.366
fumes Because that's toxic plants are natural right, so

02:03:47.768 --> 02:03:59.617
How do we end up thinking that all of these autoimmune conditions, like allergies, hay fever, food allergies, asthma, all of these autoimmune issues are due to damaged immune systems?

02:03:59.997 --> 02:04:01.178
Isn't that weird?

02:04:01.899 --> 02:04:09.364
I haven't heard the Health Freedom Movement in 2024 or 2025 saying that auto emissions are a problem.

02:04:10.865 --> 02:04:11.986
That's weird, isn't it?

02:04:13.307 --> 02:04:13.868
Wow.

02:04:14.448 --> 02:04:14.728
Right?

02:04:15.289 --> 02:04:16.910
And the toxins we're overloaded with.

02:04:17.918 --> 02:04:19.619
but we're considering it normal.

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:23.260
We're being trained by- Heavy metals are in auto emissions.

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.720
That's interesting, isn't it?

02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:31.362
By the medical industry and pharmaceutical industry to believe that this is normal.

02:04:32.182 --> 02:04:34.763
It's not normal in a lot of other countries.

02:04:36.204 --> 02:04:40.405
So, I started, I had my son over there in Europe.

02:04:40.765 --> 02:04:46.887
I was in Holland and I had my son at homework, natural birth in Holland with a midwife.

02:04:47.844 --> 02:04:50.225
They don't do vaccines on the first day of birth.

02:04:50.245 --> 02:04:53.787
They don't do vaccines in pregnancy, which used to be contraindicated.

02:04:54.467 --> 02:04:57.869
There are no studies showing that that is that, that it's safe.

02:04:58.629 --> 02:05:02.471
And that's a whole nother story, but they don't push vaccines.

02:05:02.571 --> 02:05:03.611
I came back to Sam.

02:05:03.671 --> 02:05:13.776
Now remember this is 2016 where the idea of vaccinating pregnant women is now being tossed around and being made slowly into normal.

02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:32.504
This is one of the things that the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project never talks about with regard to the mRNA vaccines, never talks about the idea that we should have never been transfecting pregnant women.

02:05:33.104 --> 02:05:34.766
I worked for the Human Genome Project.

02:05:34.966 --> 02:05:36.527
I've been doing transfection since 1998 with Sabatini.

02:05:42.173 --> 02:05:44.294
I would never have transfected my wife.

02:05:44.354 --> 02:05:45.674
This would be ridiculous.

02:05:46.194 --> 02:05:50.395
But Kevin McKernan didn't say that from 2020 until right now.

02:05:52.736 --> 02:05:56.057
Children's Health Defense didn't say that from 2020 until right now.

02:05:56.557 --> 02:06:00.698
I worked for them for more than a year trying to get them to say it and they didn't say it.

02:06:02.999 --> 02:06:06.040
This lady was saying it in 2016 and I bet before.

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:11.421
Francisco with my six month old son, completely vaccine free and I went to a well baby visit.

02:06:11.923 --> 02:06:18.425
By the way, do you know we're one of the few countries in the world that actually takes healthy children to the doctor, right?

02:06:19.545 --> 02:06:20.525
What is that for?

02:06:21.506 --> 02:06:23.546
Why do we take healthy children to the doctor?

02:06:23.686 --> 02:06:25.207
To get them weighed and hyped.

02:06:25.267 --> 02:06:26.207
We can do that at home.

02:06:26.907 --> 02:06:27.748
It's training.

02:06:29.168 --> 02:06:32.769
Because every well visit lines up with the vaccine schedule.

02:06:33.968 --> 02:06:38.612
Pediatricians make 60, 70% of their money from baby well visits.

02:06:38.812 --> 02:06:44.276
This is very bad because she was revealing something that nobody wanted anybody to know right now.

02:06:47.498 --> 02:06:58.547
I think if you went back and watched the Vaxxed movies, I wonder to what extent they would be exposing all the things that Brandy's exposing here and to what extent they were doing it succinctly and clearly.

02:06:58.567 --> 02:06:59.828
It's vaccine visits.

02:07:01.707 --> 02:07:03.488
So I went to one, right?

02:07:03.528 --> 02:07:05.449
Because I didn't know any better.

02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.869
Okay.

02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:15.615
I went to one on post street here in San Francisco and the pediatrician said, Oh wow, he needs like a 12, 15 vaccines to catch him up because he doesn't have any.

02:07:15.855 --> 02:07:16.475
And I'm like, you know what?

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.316
He's really healthy.

02:07:17.776 --> 02:07:19.237
So, and I'm breastfeeding.

02:07:19.297 --> 02:07:25.160
So, you know, I, he needs 12 to 15 vaccines in order to catch up.

02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:26.821
That's awesome.

02:07:27.021 --> 02:07:28.342
I think I'm going to do my research.

02:07:28.422 --> 02:07:28.802
And he's like,

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:36.602
And then I saw him turn, and I've seen this with doctors, because we trained them to do it, to put the pressure on.

02:07:37.202 --> 02:07:39.782
And he's like, oh, but I'm a doctor, trust me.

02:07:40.483 --> 02:07:44.484
And I said, oh, I used to work for Merck and actually called on pediatricians.

02:07:44.904 --> 02:07:46.824
I know exactly where you get your information.

02:07:46.844 --> 02:07:49.005
So I'm going to do my own research.

02:07:49.465 --> 02:07:50.245
Yeah.

02:07:50.265 --> 02:07:51.345
And I see product inserts.

02:07:51.405 --> 02:07:52.405
He stormed out of the room.

02:07:54.846 --> 02:07:55.466
Nurse comes in.

02:07:55.486 --> 02:07:56.946
OK, we'll see you in two months.

02:07:57.007 --> 02:07:58.847
And I said, you will never see me again.

02:07:59.935 --> 02:08:03.157
And that was the day, it was five years ago, that I started my research.

02:08:04.678 --> 02:08:08.840
And- Five years ago, look at that.

02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:09.801
2011, she started this.

02:08:12.543 --> 02:08:28.312
And you don't think that Mary Holland was put in place in 2015, one year before this, when Brandy was already five years into her research, already had her organization, already had all of her credentials and had sacrificed everything.

02:08:30.765 --> 02:08:43.082
has this story down pat, has all these stats, and you don't think that Mary Holland was put on Democracy Now with Paul Offit and ran Paul on purpose?

02:08:44.718 --> 02:08:55.420
Well, then you're just keeping your head in the sand because this lady's dead because she said it right and was saying it right without permission in 2016 and before.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:14.464
What I found was even worse than anything I'd seen in the pharmaceutical prescription drug industry because the safety testing done on vaccines is far less rigorous than even prescription drugs because they are not classified as a prescription drug.

02:09:15.089 --> 02:09:30.913
So, basically... How powerful would it be if Mary Holland said that it's not just me, you know, it's people like Brandy Vaughn, the shoulders of giants that I stand on, like Laura Bono.

02:09:31.714 --> 02:09:32.934
I'm just one person.

02:09:34.172 --> 02:09:37.353
There were lots of people before me, and some of them are dead.

02:09:37.774 --> 02:09:39.654
Why don't any of these people say that?

02:09:39.694 --> 02:09:42.396
Why doesn't Jessica Rose know about any of these people?

02:09:42.456 --> 02:09:45.377
Why doesn't Meryl Nass know about any of these people?

02:09:45.417 --> 02:09:49.619
Why didn't Mary Holland give every once in a while a reminder to Brandy Vaughn?

02:09:49.659 --> 02:09:56.622
Why isn't Brandy Vaughn's birthday celebrated by anti-vaxx groups or something like that just to say, hey, don't forget about her?

02:09:58.682 --> 02:10:01.844
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, it's right here for the taking now.

02:10:02.762 --> 02:10:05.084
If vaccines are a pharmaceutical product, right?

02:10:05.284 --> 02:10:08.928
Every pharmaceutical product has side effects.

02:10:09.748 --> 02:10:18.276
But vaccines are classified as a biological product versus a prescription drug, so they don't undergo the same rigorous safety testing.

02:10:18.556 --> 02:10:27.143
When I was in pharmaceutical, working for Merck, double-blind, placebo-based, gold standard safety testing was done, long-term safety testing.

02:10:27.744 --> 02:10:29.906
That is not done on vaccines.

02:10:30.563 --> 02:10:43.792
So the placebo they use is either another vaccine, which has the same toxic ingredients, which I'm gonna show you in a minute, in it, or a shot of those toxic ingredients, like with Gardasil.

02:10:44.093 --> 02:10:47.035
I mean, I invite everybody to fact check me.

02:10:47.335 --> 02:10:50.877
Go grab the Gardasil insert off the Merck website.

02:10:51.298 --> 02:10:51.758
Look at that.

02:10:51.998 --> 02:10:54.500
I am gonna state it right here, plain and simple.

02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:58.263
I think Brandy Vaughn's message was absorbed

02:10:59.463 --> 02:11:02.524
and sabotaged by ICANN and CHD.

02:11:04.064 --> 02:11:20.149
I think they absorbed every little piece of her narrative that they thought would be safe to absorb and they put it into Vax and Vax 2 and then they went forward with this big top tent of health freedom and said that we should have vaccine choice.

02:11:24.315 --> 02:11:27.257
This lady's not arguing for vaccine choice.

02:11:27.317 --> 02:11:30.039
Do you see the big problem here, the big difference?

02:11:30.079 --> 02:11:40.466
It's maybe subtle, but for me, it is the essential difference between me and them is the same difference between them and Brandy.

02:11:42.248 --> 02:11:46.130
She's not saying she wants the freedom to say this shit.

02:11:46.611 --> 02:11:48.892
She wants the freedom to stop it.

02:11:49.773 --> 02:11:53.636
She wants to change the world, not give everybody a voice.

02:11:56.923 --> 02:11:57.403
placebo.

02:11:57.623 --> 02:12:03.024
There were only 300 people in a real saline placebo group, and then the rest were given straight aluminum.

02:12:03.545 --> 02:12:14.667
And then all of the results, they combined the saline group, 300 people, with the 9,000 people on the aluminum shot versus the 9,000 with Gardasil, with the virus plus aluminum.

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:16.588
And it's one of the most toxic ingredients.

02:12:16.628 --> 02:12:18.528
There's many more in them, but that's one of them.

02:12:19.368 --> 02:12:22.089
This is, I mean, we're being lied to.

02:12:22.819 --> 02:12:24.820
They were never, that is not a safety test.

02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:26.681
That is not a valid safety test.

02:12:26.781 --> 02:12:31.083
And it's being done by the company again, that company.

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:33.944
Now keep in mind that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:12:34.044 --> 02:12:40.808
and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland will say that these have not been double blind placebo tested.

02:12:40.848 --> 02:12:41.808
They will say that.

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:48.812
But they will not say that that makes safety testing a lie.

02:12:50.733 --> 02:12:51.453
Brandy said it.

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.040
We're being lied to.

02:12:55.081 --> 02:12:55.902
I say that too.

02:12:55.942 --> 02:12:57.124
We're being lied to.

02:12:57.485 --> 02:13:02.051
And for five years, people have been asking me not to use such violent language.

02:13:02.512 --> 02:13:06.017
Don't use those words because that just pushes everybody away.

02:13:06.498 --> 02:13:07.880
Like the word traitor does.

02:13:11.328 --> 02:13:14.129
I think Brandy would be very proud of what I'm doing right now.

02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:30.972
I think Brandy might even be some of the reason why I feel confident that I'm doing the right thing, because every video I've ever seen of this woman makes me believe that she was onto the same thing that I was onto, am onto now, only 10 years before I was.

02:13:32.292 --> 02:13:40.374
And if I had met or seen or stumbled upon Brandy's work then, I would have probably discounted her as a nutcase too.

02:13:43.587 --> 02:13:49.811
because everybody around her would have made me, encouraged me, but probably would have found other people instead.

02:13:49.871 --> 02:13:53.854
You see, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is available.

02:13:54.314 --> 02:13:55.935
We just have to be willing to look for it.

02:13:56.416 --> 02:13:57.196
Profits off of it.

02:13:58.677 --> 02:14:01.419
So they have never been proven safe.

02:14:02.159 --> 02:14:07.023
And so our children have become this experimental test group, right?

02:14:08.091 --> 02:14:11.472
Our children have become experimental test animals.

02:14:11.552 --> 02:14:12.973
Well, holy shit!

02:14:13.273 --> 02:14:17.234
There's another thing that nobody else will say in the last five years but us.

02:14:17.894 --> 02:14:19.054
Ho ho ho ho!

02:14:19.555 --> 02:14:20.195
Wow!

02:14:20.535 --> 02:14:24.276
And I showed you stats on how sick we are as a population.

02:14:24.596 --> 02:14:27.277
Our children are even far sicker.

02:14:28.035 --> 02:14:30.096
Cancer is now the leading cause of death in children.

02:14:30.336 --> 02:14:41.079
Leukemia, which is an autoimmune cancer, which if you're injecting... If you're interested in archiving any of our videos, it's good to go for Brandy Vaughn on BitChute.

02:14:41.119 --> 02:14:43.999
There are quite a few there that need to be downloaded and archived.

02:14:44.499 --> 02:14:51.962
...a whole bunch of stuff into the arm and you're bypassing the immune system, you're raising antibodies, yes, but that's not immunity.

02:14:51.982 --> 02:14:53.682
And we have no detox process.

02:14:54.162 --> 02:14:57.203
So, our children are suffering.

02:14:57.634 --> 02:15:04.897
their immune systems are being damaged at skyrocketing rates, and so that's why we're seeing all of these things in our childhood population.

02:15:05.257 --> 02:15:16.541
The real epidemics, type 1 diabetes, leukemia, cancer, brain and head and neck cancer, this is exactly where all of those toxic ingredients that are in the vaccines are going.

02:15:17.221 --> 02:15:19.142
These are the real epidemics in our country.

02:15:20.782 --> 02:15:25.664
The Institute of Medicine said, sorry it's a little bit blurry, I'll read it to you,

02:15:26.593 --> 02:15:27.514
It's highlighted here.

02:15:28.154 --> 02:15:42.042
Key elements of the entire vaccine schedule, the number, the frequency, the timing, the order of administration, the combination, toxicity effects, none of this has been systemically examined in research studies.

02:15:42.862 --> 02:15:49.246
So if anyone tells me science is settled, I mean, there has been- Did you see the flash?

02:15:49.586 --> 02:15:50.687
Somebody's taking a picture.

02:15:50.707 --> 02:15:53.729
They're trying to get this slide and make sure that it's awesome.

02:15:54.445 --> 02:15:56.767
But there is no science proving that they're safe.

02:15:57.947 --> 02:16:00.449
There is no science.

02:16:02.291 --> 02:16:06.614
And there is a lot of science, a lot of independent science, showing the toxicity of the additives.

02:16:08.955 --> 02:16:10.356
And they're never going to be proven safe.

02:16:10.656 --> 02:16:10.997
Why?

02:16:11.477 --> 02:16:22.405
Because remember how I talked about Vioxx liability and how prescription drug market, if there is, if side effects do outweigh the benefits, which are rarely

02:16:23.191 --> 02:16:24.632
Real, to be honest.

02:16:25.873 --> 02:16:26.913
People can be sued, right?

02:16:26.953 --> 02:16:30.695
You can sue pharmaceutical companies and they have to expose things.

02:16:31.876 --> 02:16:32.817
Not with vaccines.

02:16:33.637 --> 02:16:40.921
Vaccine makers, which are pharmaceutical companies, get a complete free pass when it comes to vaccines.

02:16:41.381 --> 02:16:44.483
You cannot sue them for damages that the vaccines are doing.

02:16:44.923 --> 02:16:46.424
So they will never be proven safe.

02:16:46.684 --> 02:16:50.787
They have absolutely no incentive to make vaccines safer.

02:16:51.462 --> 02:16:55.746
They have no incentive to do the safety testing because there's no liability.

02:16:56.406 --> 02:16:58.848
It's a complete moneymaker with no liability.

02:16:59.729 --> 02:17:10.678
This is the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Act that declared vaccine makers completely protected, federally protected from lawsuits for injuries.

02:17:11.138 --> 02:17:17.664
So if your child is injured or dies, which does happen, it's listed on vaccine inserts, by the way,

02:17:18.998 --> 02:17:22.479
You should check the real side effects that are listed on there because you will never see that.

02:17:22.499 --> 02:17:28.401
The doctor will never give that to you unless you beg and plead and, I don't know, sneak it out of the nurse's office.

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.502
But you can download it online.

02:17:31.942 --> 02:17:32.942
Check these inserts out.

02:17:33.683 --> 02:17:38.664
A lot of these things that we're seeing in our population are listed as side effects of the vaccines.

02:17:39.564 --> 02:17:40.665
But they don't want you to know that.

02:17:42.665 --> 02:17:43.686
And there's no liability.

02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:49.063
What happened to the vaccine schedule after 1986?

02:17:50.344 --> 02:17:57.930
Anyone who tells you that they're fully vaccinated and they're fine, if they're over five, it doesn't even apply.

02:17:57.950 --> 02:18:03.054
Because in the 60s, there were five doses of vaccines.

02:18:03.674 --> 02:18:06.837
In the 1980s, what I got, I maybe got 10, 12.

02:18:07.137 --> 02:18:09.338
And you know what?

02:18:10.639 --> 02:18:13.081
Parents didn't always take children in for the boosters.

02:18:14.438 --> 02:18:15.799
so pushed and pressured.

02:18:15.819 --> 02:18:18.060
There wasn't that pressure that there is nowadays.

02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.421
So I probably didn't even get the 24 doses.

02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:33.306
Now, for my son to go to school in California because of a law that was passed last year, he would have to have 35 doses by age 5 in California.

02:18:33.326 --> 02:18:36.227
49 is the schedule from the CDC.

02:18:36.247 --> 02:18:43.870
72 is the schedule now for children up to 18 years of age with boosters and HPV and all of these vaccines included.

02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:49.611
72.

02:18:45.329 --> 02:18:49.611
I mean, does anyone in here have 72 vaccines?

02:18:50.531 --> 02:18:51.872
But we're all still alive.

02:18:52.452 --> 02:18:53.913
How is that possible?

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:56.974
Right?

02:18:57.374 --> 02:18:58.295
How is that possible?

02:18:59.035 --> 02:19:06.558
And I guarantee you, the entire population, very few people in Europe have 72 vaccines.

02:19:07.378 --> 02:19:09.859
In fact, their schedules look very, very, very different.

02:19:09.919 --> 02:19:12.220
In fact, they look like that 1960s schedule.

02:19:13.721 --> 02:19:13.861
And

02:19:14.926 --> 02:19:16.587
They're all alive as well, right?

02:19:17.887 --> 02:19:20.008
But pharma would lead us to believe that we would all be dead.

02:19:20.028 --> 02:19:21.609
I'll get into that in a minute.

02:19:23.269 --> 02:19:23.750
So the U.S.

02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:30.132
vaccine program, we recommend 53 doses of vaccines by six years of age, more vaccines than any other country.

02:19:30.653 --> 02:19:32.553
No other country gives vaccines in Uruguay.

02:19:32.953 --> 02:19:35.655
This is toxic chemicals going into a developing fetus.

02:19:35.835 --> 02:19:38.696
Now I want you to understand how precise she's being.

02:19:39.994 --> 02:19:46.698
how wonderfully precise she's being and how wonderfully imprecise the same people at CHD are not.

02:19:47.478 --> 02:19:49.760
The same people at ICANN are not.

02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:54.643
The same doctors at CHD are not this precise.

02:19:55.183 --> 02:19:58.005
The same doctors at ICANN are not this precise.

02:19:58.885 --> 02:20:07.030
And in 2016, Brandy Vaughn, a former Merck executive, is being very precise about ending something.

02:20:09.045 --> 02:20:19.103
not health freedom, not free speech, not freedom of choice, but ending the poisoning and murdering of our children.

02:20:20.606 --> 02:20:38.076
the criminal vaccine schedule in America, which can be most easily shown to someone naive to the phenomenon by just comparing the US vaccine schedule to any other vaccine schedule in the West, which is what she just suggested these people do.

02:20:38.536 --> 02:20:43.879
And the only person that's ever suggested that in the last five years that I know of is me.

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:46.201
CHD never does it.

02:20:47.261 --> 02:20:51.482
There's no book about the comparing or there's no chapter.

02:20:54.403 --> 02:20:56.204
There's no chapter in the green book.

02:20:57.144 --> 02:21:03.926
There's no chapter in this green book comparing the vaccine schedule in America to the vaccine schedule all across Europe.

02:21:04.506 --> 02:21:10.568
Even though that would have been a pretty easy dunk for Brian Hooker and for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:10.608 --> 02:21:13.069
to add into the beginning of this book, wouldn't it?

02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:16.330
But it's not in there.

02:21:18.396 --> 02:21:30.200
It's not in the beginning of James Lyons Wyler's 2016 book either about the genetic and environmental causes of autism.

02:21:32.121 --> 02:21:36.062
She's not saying there are any genetic causes to this toxicity.

02:21:36.542 --> 02:21:37.583
It's just poisoning.

02:21:37.983 --> 02:21:40.084
He says there's a pretty big genetic cause.

02:21:43.005 --> 02:21:45.726
This guy's still promoted on stage by CHD.

02:21:45.806 --> 02:21:46.646
That chick's dead.

02:21:50.208 --> 02:21:59.197
It's contraindicated, it was contraindicated on the vaccine inserts until the FDA made a rule change a few years ago.

02:22:00.458 --> 02:22:02.060
Animal studies show birth defects.

02:22:03.441 --> 02:22:04.722
And we're being pushed this.

02:22:04.962 --> 02:22:07.665
There are promotional campaigns to give pregnant women vaccines.

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:10.568
This was unheard of 20, 10, 20 years ago.

02:22:14.005 --> 02:22:17.366
then no other country gives the amount of vaccines that we do as well.

02:22:17.687 --> 02:22:22.328
Six to nine doses for children, on average, when they go into that doctor's office.

02:22:22.569 --> 02:22:29.612
She's repeating the same thing that I'm repeating that nobody repeats by comparing what they do in other countries.

02:22:29.652 --> 02:22:32.653
You can see how malevolent our own schedule is.

02:22:33.473 --> 02:22:42.337
And CHD has been so inept at doing that, ICANN has been so inept at doing that, that it can only be seen as malevolence.

02:22:44.397 --> 02:22:45.618
And you know what, the crazy thing?

02:22:46.979 --> 02:22:50.321
Children don't even have a developed immune system.

02:22:50.981 --> 02:22:52.082
It's still developing.

02:22:52.582 --> 02:23:00.047
They can't even initiate the proper response, even if you wanted to argue that vaccines create the right immunity response, which they don't.

02:23:00.127 --> 02:23:03.789
Immunity is very complicated, and there are many layers to it.

02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:07.532
And it begins here in the nose, eyes, mouth, and ears.

02:23:08.192 --> 02:23:09.013
It doesn't begin here.

02:23:09.073 --> 02:23:10.434
There's no pathway from the arm.

02:23:12.062 --> 02:23:14.843
Oh, there's no pathway from the arm.

02:23:16.124 --> 02:23:18.865
She just said it without even really wanting to say it.

02:23:18.945 --> 02:23:27.810
Intramuscular injection with any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is so dumb, it's gotta be evil.

02:23:29.431 --> 02:23:31.272
I really like Brandy Vaughn, don't you?

02:23:34.946 --> 02:23:38.568
Yeah, that doesn't confer immunity, not real immunity.

02:23:39.189 --> 02:23:40.950
So, we're giving six to nine.

02:23:40.970 --> 02:23:42.431
There's no combination studies.

02:23:42.891 --> 02:23:47.254
So all the vaccine safety studies are studied individually, right?

02:23:47.394 --> 02:23:50.516
They find children that haven't been vaccinated again and they test one vaccine.

02:23:50.896 --> 02:23:53.017
We're giving them 72 by age 18.

02:23:53.998 --> 02:24:03.144
You know, and I think that it's easy for people to understand that when you combine toxic chemicals, you have no idea what kind of reactions are gonna happen.

02:24:03.923 --> 02:24:09.105
A COMBINATION OF SUBSTANCES WITH THE INTENT OF AUGMENTING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS DUMB?

02:24:10.145 --> 02:24:11.346
SAY IT AIN'T SO!

02:24:12.466 --> 02:24:12.746
Right?

02:24:13.166 --> 02:24:14.627
It increases the toxicity.

02:24:15.687 --> 02:24:20.089
And, we have four times, four more times, ah, four times more vaccines than in the 80s.

02:24:20.969 --> 02:24:22.589
So, another thing about the children.

02:24:23.170 --> 02:24:24.650
We give 26 vaccines by age one year.

02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:25.530
We, um, clearly,

02:24:30.942 --> 02:24:34.705
If that was healthy, we would have the healthiest infant population, right?

02:24:35.345 --> 02:24:38.088
So we give more infant vaccines than any other country, 26.

02:24:38.128 --> 02:24:43.492
Two in utero, so that would be 28 if the pregnant mother gets the two that are recommended.

02:24:45.934 --> 02:24:50.918
So we would clearly have the healthiest infants, right?

02:24:52.118 --> 02:24:54.100
Well, we don't.

02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:56.482
We actually have the highest.

02:24:56.882 --> 02:24:58.804
There's a lot of crying babies in the audience.

02:25:00.071 --> 02:25:03.015
SIDS rate, and the highest infant mortality.

02:25:04.136 --> 02:25:06.078
So, of the developed world.

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.282
Clearly, something's wrong.

02:25:09.643 --> 02:25:15.650
So if vaccines are so healthy, and they're keeping us alive, why do we have the highest infant mortality rate?

02:25:16.687 --> 02:25:16.927
Right?

02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:19.930
What a weird question not to ask, CHD.

02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:24.214
What a weird question not to ask in the beginning of every book you publish.

02:25:24.274 --> 02:25:27.516
What a weird question not to have at the front of every website.

02:25:28.117 --> 02:25:29.138
Wow, it's so strange.

02:25:29.178 --> 02:25:32.100
It's almost like you don't really want to change the world at all, right?

02:25:33.041 --> 02:25:44.091
And you can, if you can, if you look at different countries, these countries that have the lowest infant death rate, they have the lowest infant vaccine schedule.

02:25:45.146 --> 02:25:54.054
Is she still comparing the outcomes of vaccine schedules in our country versus the outcomes and vaccine schedules in other countries?

02:25:54.654 --> 02:25:55.535
Oh my gosh.

02:25:55.955 --> 02:25:58.017
Imagine if CHD did that.

02:26:00.479 --> 02:26:07.866
Imagine if Brian Hooker would have put that in this stupid book and then CHD actually tried to sell this book instead of the black book or the red book.

02:26:13.868 --> 02:26:15.190
This is not a coincidence.

02:26:16.452 --> 02:26:18.815
SIDS is not a disease.

02:26:19.756 --> 02:26:22.180
SIDS is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

02:26:22.561 --> 02:26:23.642
It is a label.

02:26:24.904 --> 02:26:30.191
A label saying we don't know why this healthy baby just died, right?

02:26:32.265 --> 02:26:39.852
What's interesting also is that CHD doesn't really fight for justice for the people who lost kids to SIDS.

02:26:40.152 --> 02:26:48.941
Even though if Brandy's right and I'm right, then actually SIDS is just vaccine toxicity killing kids.

02:26:50.683 --> 02:26:55.207
So it seems to me there's a lot of lawsuits waiting to happen, a lot of justice that's unserved.

02:26:56.001 --> 02:26:57.521
and they're focused on autism.

02:26:58.021 --> 02:27:05.143
Not that autism isn't bad, but there's a lot of death that could be added to this list of things, right?

02:27:05.703 --> 02:27:11.144
Does vaccine schedule cause autism or does the vaccine schedule also cause SIDS?

02:27:14.344 --> 02:27:21.466
Because Brandy Vaughn in 2016 was saying that not only does it cause all these toxicities and she hasn't even said autism yet.

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:22.786
Isn't that weird?

02:27:23.777 --> 02:27:25.818
She hasn't even said autism yet!

02:27:25.838 --> 02:27:30.321
She hasn't even said autism yet.

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:32.503
Do you hear it yet?

02:27:53.894 --> 02:27:54.634
I get a lot of time.

02:27:54.734 --> 02:27:56.215
Oh, that's just a coincidence, Brandy.

02:27:56.355 --> 02:27:56.655
Is it?

02:27:56.675 --> 02:28:07.421
Then if that's such a coincidence, then why did Save the Children do a report saying that the US has the highest first day death rate in the developed world?

02:28:07.881 --> 02:28:11.383
What a weird statistic never to say, CHD.

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:17.066
What a weird statistic not to have in Vaxxed or Vaxxed 2.

02:28:19.587 --> 02:28:20.808
The number one

02:28:22.119 --> 02:28:27.623
highest first day newborn death rate in the world.

02:28:30.245 --> 02:28:31.425
Holy shit.

02:28:34.548 --> 02:28:44.714
And we are one of the only countries that gives hepatitis B, which is a sexually transmitted or intravenous drug transmitted illness like HIV.

02:28:45.035 --> 02:28:48.117
We give that vaccine within 12 hours of birth in hospitals.

02:28:48.757 --> 02:28:51.119
It is protocol in the US, right?

02:28:52.216 --> 02:28:54.217
We have the highest first-day death rate.

02:28:55.017 --> 02:28:57.277
It is not that we have lack of medical care, right?

02:28:57.318 --> 02:29:02.079
We spend more per country on health care than any other country, developed country.

02:29:02.419 --> 02:29:05.780
So clearly, you know, it is not a coincidence.

02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:11.342
So the immune system is not mature, as I said, there's no brain-blood barrier for babies.

02:29:13.522 --> 02:29:15.623
And again, if you hear I'm vaccinated, then I'm fine.

02:29:16.084 --> 02:29:19.226
There's no developed blood-brain barrier in babies?

02:29:19.406 --> 02:29:20.186
Holy shit.

02:29:20.466 --> 02:29:21.247
I didn't know that.

02:29:21.387 --> 02:29:23.248
If that's true, holy shit.

02:29:23.328 --> 02:29:24.809
Why doesn't CHD say that?

02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:30.352
Why isn't that the foundation of the introduction of this book, right?

02:29:38.197 --> 02:29:40.658
If you don't see the malevolence yet, I'm not sure I can help you.

02:29:41.159 --> 02:29:42.239
It doesn't even apply anymore.

02:29:43.618 --> 02:29:44.959
It's someone under five years of age.

02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:51.066
All right, so big money in vaccines.

02:29:51.306 --> 02:29:57.773
A lot of people are saying, but Brandy, you know, vaccines aren't profitable.

02:29:58.434 --> 02:29:59.755
That couldn't be further from the truth.

02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:03.902
So again, like I said, there's a low barrier to entry, right?

02:30:03.922 --> 02:30:06.904
Low subpar safety testing.

02:30:07.325 --> 02:30:08.586
No gold standard testing.

02:30:08.626 --> 02:30:13.369
So lower safety testing levels, less money, less investment.

02:30:14.189 --> 02:30:15.630
High profit margin, right?

02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:17.131
I'm gonna show you these slides in a minute.

02:30:17.512 --> 02:30:18.733
There's lack of competition.

02:30:18.793 --> 02:30:21.134
It's a near monopoly in most vaccine categories.

02:30:21.835 --> 02:30:24.216
And then there's no need to market, right?

02:30:24.657 --> 02:30:29.360
Because it's a near monopoly and vaccines are patented formulas.

02:30:29.995 --> 02:30:37.421
So, you know, usually there's only one or two companies in each disease state, like with the NMR vaccine.

02:30:38.522 --> 02:30:39.543
There's no liability.

02:30:40.918 --> 02:30:57.285
It's also important to realize that once you get a vaccine approved, in order for a new vaccine to replace your vaccine, you have to somehow show a higher effectivity, and that's a pretty hard thing to manage, given how these things are established in the first place.

02:30:57.345 --> 02:31:06.449
So, I'm not saying she's missing this, I'm saying that she's hitting so many things, you can't hit everything in a two-hour talk, but that's an additional layer to this as well.

02:31:07.250 --> 02:31:09.891
There's nearly 300 vaccines in development.

02:31:10.529 --> 02:31:10.949
right now.

02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:15.733
Nearly 300, and more are being added every day.

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:19.156
I'm missing a slide in here.

02:31:19.816 --> 02:31:21.658
All right.

02:31:22.718 --> 02:31:38.571
Well, the World Health Organization has estimated that in vaccines, there's twice as much profit margin with vaccines as there are in prescription drugs because it's such a saturated market.

02:31:39.619 --> 02:31:50.129
Vaccines are where pharmaceutical companies are going for their next big money-making activity.

02:31:50.409 --> 02:31:58.497
So she's warning us that there is a move from pharmaceutical products to vaccines and it's happening in 2016 and she can see it.

02:31:58.577 --> 02:31:59.718
Interesting observation.

02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:03.289
What about immunity?

02:32:03.609 --> 02:32:04.830
We'd all be dead, right?

02:32:05.050 --> 02:32:05.870
Without vaccines.

02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:07.071
That's what they want us to believe.

02:32:07.091 --> 02:32:08.451
That's what they train us to believe.

02:32:08.511 --> 02:32:18.054
In fact, they are now teaching science teachers to teach children in public school the actual, you will get cancer if you don't get vaccinated.

02:32:18.834 --> 02:32:27.377
That is the line that now they are teaching, well, teachers are being enlisted into certain programs to tell children.

02:32:27.477 --> 02:32:27.517
So,

02:32:30.583 --> 02:32:33.945
I always hear, but we would all be dead, vaccines saved us, right?

02:32:35.225 --> 02:32:36.126
What about immunity?

02:32:36.486 --> 02:32:38.447
So I have to cover this, right?

02:32:38.587 --> 02:32:39.967
Did vaccines really save us?

02:32:39.987 --> 02:32:46.050
90% of diseases were on decline well before vaccine programs were introduced.

02:32:46.470 --> 02:32:49.452
And I'm going to show you a slide that will blow your mind in a minute.

02:32:50.572 --> 02:32:51.853
But let's take a step back.

02:32:51.953 --> 02:32:53.233
What is immunity, right?

02:32:55.478 --> 02:32:58.559
The immune system is really, really complicated.

02:32:58.999 --> 02:33:02.921
Thousands and thousands of years to biologically become what it is today.

02:33:02.941 --> 02:33:04.821
We have been fighting viruses.

02:33:04.861 --> 02:33:06.142
We've been fighting illnesses.

02:33:06.522 --> 02:33:11.684
Our species has survived without vaccines for thousands and thousands of years.

02:33:12.624 --> 02:33:19.767
And if you want to step back even further, we are far sicker now on a chronic basis than we were back in those days.

02:33:20.567 --> 02:33:22.428
Yes, there were two world wars in the early 1900s.

02:33:23.530 --> 02:33:32.532
We had an industrial revolution, there wasn't sanitation, there wasn't clean water, there wasn't food resources in cities, yet cities were, people were flocking to cities.

02:33:34.232 --> 02:33:39.573
So we had some epidemics outbreaks, including tuberculosis and cholera.

02:33:40.573 --> 02:33:41.534
They were two of the largest.

02:33:42.934 --> 02:33:48.355
Are you aware that in the Palace of Versailles, there are no bathrooms?

02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:56.782
Are you aware that when people were walking around and visiting that palace back in the day, that people were just shitting in the stairwells?

02:33:59.523 --> 02:34:01.184
That the dogs shit inside too?

02:34:03.504 --> 02:34:06.505
And that that's one of the reasons why these ladies wore these big dresses?

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.127
Are you aware of that at all?

02:34:10.167 --> 02:34:14.188
That there was shit and piss in the corridors of the Palace of Versailles?

02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:27.096
She is telling the story of Susan Humphreys and that other guy, Roman something something book.

02:34:28.677 --> 02:34:32.860
And I'm just going to get up for a second and get that book so I can see when that book was published.

02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:47.071
Where is that book?

02:34:49.770 --> 02:34:52.871
Sorry, I'm going to find it in a second.

02:34:52.891 --> 02:34:52.871
2013.

02:35:00.834 --> 02:35:02.495
So maybe she's going to cite this book.

02:35:03.875 --> 02:35:07.096
Maybe she's even going to pull a figure out of this book.

02:35:07.176 --> 02:35:07.416
But in 2013,

02:35:10.967 --> 02:35:14.930
In 2013, Susan Humphreys and Roman Bestantic, who I don't trust.

02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:19.813
I don't trust the Roman guy because they tried to get me to do podcasts with Roman recently.

02:35:20.453 --> 02:35:23.855
And Roman has kind of sort of discounted me on Twitter a little bit.

02:35:23.895 --> 02:35:25.877
He's on Twitter, so he's employed too.

02:35:26.537 --> 02:35:29.579
And they, of course, put him in front of Suzanne.

02:35:30.079 --> 02:35:32.461
And Suzanne is actually a really bright woman.

02:35:34.562 --> 02:35:36.223
prominently featured in Vax 2.

02:35:37.544 --> 02:35:41.446
Sometimes she's on stage at CHD, but never as the feature lady.

02:35:42.346 --> 02:35:48.170
I think Susan Humphries is a good guy and maybe Roman Biansky is probably working for them or something like that.

02:35:48.210 --> 02:35:49.510
Or maybe they're both good, I don't know.

02:35:50.091 --> 02:36:01.737
But in this book is really where they demonstrate that sanitation and, you know, washing hands and taking care of the water and better food are all part of it.

02:36:01.757 --> 02:36:02.618
So let's see what she says.

02:36:03.533 --> 02:36:05.454
are just killers in the early 1900s.

02:36:07.016 --> 02:36:10.999
Do we have tuberculosis and cholera much anymore these days?

02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:17.964
Because pharmaceutical companies would love you to believe that vaccines are what saved us.

02:36:18.744 --> 02:36:21.066
TB and cholera never had a vaccine program.

02:36:21.747 --> 02:36:24.188
So why are we not dying in droves on the street?

02:36:25.369 --> 02:36:30.073
If vaccines saved us, we should all be dead of TB and cholera, right?

02:36:31.144 --> 02:36:32.565
It is just not true.

02:36:32.985 --> 02:36:35.326
It is all marketing, right?

02:36:35.907 --> 02:36:38.168
So the University of Virginia did a study.

02:36:38.608 --> 02:36:42.050
Antibodies do not equal immunity.

02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:45.532
Antibodies do not equal immunity.

02:36:45.612 --> 02:36:49.474
Boy, Brandy Vaughn was way too far ahead.

02:36:50.054 --> 02:36:52.456
I mean, really way too far ahead.

02:36:53.396 --> 02:36:56.798
That rewrote immunology textbooks in 2014.

02:36:57.538 --> 02:37:00.340
They finally found the connection between the brain

02:37:00.885 --> 02:37:02.826
and the gut through the lymphatic system.

02:37:03.166 --> 02:37:10.550
Before that study was published, two years ago, immunology textbooks said the brain and the gut are not connected.

02:37:11.550 --> 02:37:14.032
There's no system that's connected.

02:37:14.332 --> 02:37:17.834
Except there's also the vagus nerve, so there's a lot, that's awesome.

02:37:18.214 --> 02:37:18.574
Right?

02:37:19.194 --> 02:37:29.860
So, they're saying the science is settled, vaccines cause immunity, and we know all about the immune system, and don't ask questions, and if you do, you're crazy, right?

02:37:30.765 --> 02:37:33.047
They just rewrote immunology textbooks two years ago.

02:37:33.447 --> 02:37:35.169
And guess who writes the textbooks for medical school?

02:37:35.189 --> 02:37:38.111
By the way, a lot of my work goes for it by pharmaceutical companies.

02:37:39.472 --> 02:37:42.955
They wrote, rewrote the immunology textbooks in 2014.

02:37:43.675 --> 02:37:52.502
She says, interesting antibodies, a temporary price and antibodies due to toxic additives in the vaccines does not equate immunity.

02:37:52.522 --> 02:37:56.966
You know what I realized I missed one of these slides right here.

02:37:57.947 --> 02:37:59.048
Do you know what's in that needle?

02:38:00.814 --> 02:38:04.877
because everybody should know what's going in their body, right?

02:38:05.577 --> 02:38:08.019
Aluminum is a known neurotoxin.

02:38:08.319 --> 02:38:13.082
It is one of the major, it's the immune activator in vaccines.

02:38:13.162 --> 02:38:13.963
Let's call it that.

02:38:14.003 --> 02:38:15.684
It's an adjunct, technical terms.

02:38:16.044 --> 02:38:17.205
It is a known neurotoxin.

02:38:17.265 --> 02:38:18.686
It's linked to breast cancer.

02:38:18.746 --> 02:38:19.967
It's linked to autoimmune issues.

02:38:20.027 --> 02:38:22.609
It's linked to Alzheimer's, dementia.

02:38:23.970 --> 02:38:25.871
Aluminum is in most vaccines.

02:38:26.271 --> 02:38:29.353
And the ones that don't have aluminum have squalene,

02:38:30.421 --> 02:38:33.162
you know, results in Gulf War syndrome, or they have mercury.

02:38:34.063 --> 02:38:40.305
Every flu shot in California this past... Did she just explain Gulf War syndrome as squalene exposure?

02:38:40.385 --> 02:38:41.706
Wow, that's extraordinary.

02:38:41.726 --> 02:38:45.207
I wonder if there was any squalene in the anthrax vaccine, Mark.

02:38:47.188 --> 02:38:47.928
...had mercury in it.

02:38:48.288 --> 02:38:50.189
Even children's flu shots.

02:38:50.729 --> 02:38:51.810
Down to six months of age.

02:38:52.662 --> 02:38:54.884
Mercury is one of the most dangerous toxins known to man.

02:38:55.224 --> 02:38:55.524
In St.

02:38:55.564 --> 02:39:01.729
Louis, there was a high school recently, a month ago, that someone broke a thermometer, right?

02:39:01.789 --> 02:39:02.830
It was all over the news.

02:39:02.850 --> 02:39:03.971
Hazmat was called.

02:39:04.051 --> 02:39:06.693
A thermometer was broken in a high school lab in St.

02:39:06.733 --> 02:39:07.033
Louis.

02:39:07.453 --> 02:39:08.674
The school was evacuated.

02:39:08.694 --> 02:39:10.656
Hazmat teams go in, all covered in gear.

02:39:11.156 --> 02:39:12.297
That's mercury.

02:39:13.278 --> 02:39:14.659
It's in vaccines.

02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:18.282
And don't let anybody tell you it is a safer form.

02:39:18.922 --> 02:39:19.683
It is not.

02:39:20.646 --> 02:39:30.654
And interestingly, the safe form or not safe form of mercury is the argument that Paul Offit and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:39:30.754 --> 02:39:35.678
regularly enacted over the last 10 years or five years of their show.

02:39:37.239 --> 02:39:45.405
It's really remarkable that this woman is hitting all the home runs and all the home runs and all the home runs.

02:39:45.665 --> 02:39:46.646
It's really impressive.

02:39:46.986 --> 02:39:50.249
Even small doses of poison are still poison.

02:39:52.139 --> 02:39:53.841
It's not gonna kill you automatically.

02:39:54.141 --> 02:39:58.104
Some people it does, depends on how much exposure, previous exposure you've had.

02:39:58.544 --> 02:40:03.709
But- Intramuscular injection prevents the temporal association with the damage, right?

02:40:03.749 --> 02:40:05.370
It makes the damage more subtle.

02:40:05.410 --> 02:40:07.052
It makes the damage more progressive.

02:40:07.092 --> 02:40:09.133
It makes the damage slower over time.

02:40:11.435 --> 02:40:14.538
That's why intramuscular injection's so diabolically dumb.

02:40:15.078 --> 02:40:15.919
It's a slow death.

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.202
Even a small dose of poison is poison.

02:40:20.981 --> 02:40:23.223
Formaldehyde is an industrial pesticide.

02:40:23.743 --> 02:40:31.410
It's a known human carcinogen labeled by the EPA and hundreds of other scientific agencies around the world.

02:40:31.851 --> 02:40:33.392
Formaldehyde causes cancer.

02:40:33.692 --> 02:40:34.373
That's pretty much

02:40:35.262 --> 02:40:36.442
Known science, right?

02:40:37.102 --> 02:40:46.785
So there are all of these articles coming out about Chinese wood floors, lumber liquidators, getting in trouble for the off-gassing of formaldehyde.

02:40:47.425 --> 02:40:49.486
Because when you inhale it, it causes cancer.

02:40:50.186 --> 02:40:51.506
Guess what they don't want you to know?

02:40:52.566 --> 02:40:53.747
It's in vaccines.

02:40:54.787 --> 02:40:58.748
And when you inject something into your arm, it goes straight to your vital organs.

02:40:58.808 --> 02:41:03.549
It bypasses the natural detox, I'm sorry, the natural defenses of the body.

02:41:04.454 --> 02:41:07.217
So this is going into all of these vital organs all over your body.

02:41:07.237 --> 02:41:10.300
It's like free reign and it causes cancer.

02:41:10.981 --> 02:41:12.762
It's unknown human carcinogen.

02:41:13.723 --> 02:41:22.272
And I'm sure it's the SB 40 and do not let anybody tell you that, Oh, well that pair contains more formaldehyde than vaccines.

02:41:23.055 --> 02:41:24.797
Yeah, because it's a pesticide, right?

02:41:25.558 --> 02:41:28.140
So it is in the pear, and you shouldn't be eating that pear either.

02:41:28.501 --> 02:41:33.606
But that pear goes through your body's defense system, your detox pathway.

02:41:33.967 --> 02:41:37.911
So when you inhale something, when you eat something, when you drink something,

02:41:40.187 --> 02:41:44.270
60% of those toxins, on average, are filtered out through your body.

02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:45.731
They just go right out.

02:41:45.891 --> 02:41:51.355
Because the organization of the immune system is organized around the barriers.

02:41:51.455 --> 02:41:55.438
And so if you eat something, it's very different than intramuscularly injecting it.

02:41:55.478 --> 02:41:56.178
Right, Brandy?

02:41:56.198 --> 02:42:02.383
And it goes through the kidney, the liver, all of the mutations.

02:42:02.423 --> 02:42:03.083
Holy shit.

02:42:03.684 --> 02:42:05.785
These things are neutralized, right?

02:42:05.825 --> 02:42:08.167
We have a process to neutralize those toxins.

02:42:08.689 --> 02:42:11.531
when we inhale, drink, or eat something.

02:42:11.792 --> 02:42:15.975
When we inject it into the arm, there is no process to deal with that.

02:42:16.215 --> 02:42:16.475
Yeah!

02:42:16.555 --> 02:42:17.856
Come on!

02:42:20.885 --> 02:42:35.491
Do you understand how important this day is to realize that there are people like Brandi in 2016 are saying everything that I'm saying now, 10 years ago, and all of these heroes stepped in front of them.

02:42:35.511 --> 02:42:39.133
That's why I didn't know who Brandi was when I had my daughter in America.

02:42:39.153 --> 02:42:48.977
That's why I never seen a video of hers before, because CHD didn't have the humility to say that, well, somebody was doing it better than us.

02:42:51.932 --> 02:42:56.295
Somebody like Susan Humphries or Brandy Vaughn was doing it better than us.

02:42:56.355 --> 02:43:00.399
They don't have the humility to say that because that's exactly what they're not supposed to do.

02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:03.401
Well, I'm doing it right now.

02:43:03.801 --> 02:43:10.887
Go on Bitchute, watch any video you can find of this woman, archive it, and share it with your friends if you don't want to share me.

02:43:13.188 --> 02:43:14.690
She had it right 10 years ago.

02:43:17.592 --> 02:43:21.475
Whatever is injected is far more potent than ingested.

02:43:22.873 --> 02:43:26.355
So we have to talk about vaccines when we talk about chemical toxicity.

02:43:27.156 --> 02:43:28.697
Monosodium glutamate.

02:43:28.877 --> 02:43:30.458
Don't eat it in Chinese food, people.

02:43:30.959 --> 02:43:34.201
But don't ask questions when it's on that vaccine label, right?

02:43:35.502 --> 02:43:41.046
All these supermarkets pulling all MSG-containing products off of their shelves in the next three years.

02:43:42.647 --> 02:43:43.687
But it's in vaccines.

02:43:44.128 --> 02:43:46.009
And again, far more potent when injected.

02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:47.430
Formaldehyde, by the way.

02:43:47.730 --> 02:43:48.731
Walmart is

02:43:49.554 --> 02:43:53.378
taking off all formaldehyde products, because it can be in beauty care products as well.

02:43:53.758 --> 02:43:58.422
And they are now taking formaldehyde-based products off the shelves.

02:43:59.223 --> 02:44:00.644
But we're still injecting it.

02:44:01.165 --> 02:44:07.871
So really, does it matter if it's in the body products if we're just saying yes to that flu shot and injecting it in the arm?

02:44:08.552 --> 02:44:09.472
Polysorbate 80.

02:44:10.033 --> 02:44:13.436
What is one of the biggest money makers in the medical field right now?

02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:19.001
Yeah, a lot of autoimmune issues, right?

02:44:19.722 --> 02:44:23.644
A lot of these toxins cause autoimmune issues.

02:44:23.664 --> 02:44:24.624
I'm gonna get to that in a minute.

02:44:25.405 --> 02:44:27.486
Polysorbate 80 is linked to infertility.

02:44:29.347 --> 02:44:32.588
That is a booming business.

02:44:32.909 --> 02:44:37.311
There's now infertility clinics on almost every mile, right?

02:44:38.011 --> 02:44:40.733
Why are we having such a hard time conceiving?

02:44:41.246 --> 02:44:43.807
It's because our bodies can't handle the toxins.

02:44:44.468 --> 02:44:48.090
So it can't grow another body and another child.

02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:49.890
That's the recording, sorry.

02:44:49.930 --> 02:44:52.972
When it's under attack from all of these toxins.

02:44:54.013 --> 02:44:57.995
So polysorbate 80, linked to infertility and neurological issues.

02:44:58.135 --> 02:45:00.516
It also opens the brain blood barrier.

02:45:01.136 --> 02:45:06.119
So we have a brain blood barrier, which is a defense mechanism in our body so that toxins don't enter our brain.

02:45:06.579 --> 02:45:07.259
Polysorbate 80,

02:45:09.855 --> 02:45:11.076
actually opens it up.

02:45:11.696 --> 02:45:17.319
So when it's combined... Maybe they screwed up the sound on this part of the video because they don't want you to hear this part.

02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:22.623
In vaccines, it's allowing these toxins to go straight into our brain.

02:45:23.183 --> 02:45:25.624
That is why we have so many neurological issues.

02:45:25.884 --> 02:45:30.127
Why Alzheimer's, there was an article just written a month ago on early onset Alzheimer's.

02:45:30.187 --> 02:45:31.728
It's happening now in 30 year olds.

02:45:32.978 --> 02:45:51.010
dementia, neurological issues affect behavior, ADHD, tics, seizures, epilepsy, autism, brain damage, all of these things, inflammation of the brain, and we're destroying our brain cells when we add these toxins into our body.

02:45:52.090 --> 02:45:56.873
So, there's also foreign, human, and animal DNA in vaccines.

02:45:57.314 --> 02:45:59.395
There is aborted fetal tissue.

02:46:00.176 --> 02:46:00.596
A lot of

02:46:01.570 --> 02:46:05.151
People who are very pro-life are very disturbed by this.

02:46:05.351 --> 02:46:07.192
Wow, it's not the right slide right now.

02:46:07.272 --> 02:46:10.213
I think they really did screw this presentation up.

02:46:10.874 --> 02:46:11.454
But it's true.

02:46:12.034 --> 02:46:12.874
It's the reality.

02:46:15.015 --> 02:46:16.216
Wow.

02:46:16.236 --> 02:46:21.838
The method of introduction, again, injection is far more potent.

02:46:23.518 --> 02:46:26.780
So what does the CDC say?

02:46:27.751 --> 02:46:30.773
What do they credit for the decline in infectious disease?

02:46:30.873 --> 02:46:45.601
Look, I'm not trying to be a paranoid person, but the sound suddenly became only one-sided, and this slide is not showing her, and it's not the slide she's talking about, and this was a slide that was up quite a while ago in the talk.

02:46:45.761 --> 02:46:48.723
I think that this talk was sabotaged, and I'm not even shitting.

02:46:51.225 --> 02:46:51.745
In the U.S.

02:46:52.205 --> 02:46:54.747
This is directly from the Center for Disease Control.

02:46:55.767 --> 02:46:56.668
Historical data.

02:46:57.737 --> 02:47:01.719
shows chlorinated water and sanitation and these things.

02:47:02.119 --> 02:47:04.681
I'm not, this is, this is old slides.

02:47:04.761 --> 02:47:10.524
They have manipulated this video, ruined the audio so that you might stop watching it here.

02:47:10.724 --> 02:47:12.225
I believe it wholeheartedly.

02:47:14.166 --> 02:47:16.988
Was responsible for the reduction in infectious disease.

02:47:17.388 --> 02:47:19.309
It was not vaccines.

02:47:20.109 --> 02:47:23.991
So this is when we had a flu pandemic.

02:47:24.552 --> 02:47:26.933
This is when chlorinated water came into play.

02:47:28.854 --> 02:47:29.955
These are the videos.

02:47:30.035 --> 02:47:36.317
This is the big picture that she was supposed to show you where these are the pandemics.

02:47:36.397 --> 02:47:39.838
This is where, this is where sanitation was brought in.

02:47:39.898 --> 02:47:48.041
This is where she's looking at a different, probably something that was out of this book or the original that's not in this book, or I don't know what.

02:47:49.962 --> 02:47:50.602
Wow.

02:47:50.742 --> 02:47:52.223
This is, boy, this is awesome.

02:47:53.603 --> 02:47:54.944
Death rate for infectious disease.

02:47:56.546 --> 02:47:57.386
1900 to 1996.

02:47:58.727 --> 02:47:59.948
Please take a picture of this slide.

02:47:59.968 --> 02:48:01.329
It might not be online very long.

02:48:02.770 --> 02:48:07.173
This is when the plague, the last transmission of the plague.

02:48:07.653 --> 02:48:08.633
This is penicillin.

02:48:09.354 --> 02:48:12.216
This is when the polio vaccine was introduced.

02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:18.160
This is when vaccination, five vaccines started.

02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:20.461
This is when vaccinations happened.

02:48:20.481 --> 02:48:23.263
Maybe this is the right slide, I don't know, but you can't see where she's pointing.

02:48:23.283 --> 02:48:24.244
This is not what they want you to see.

02:48:25.290 --> 02:48:26.650
But this is the reality.

02:48:27.871 --> 02:48:36.633
Again, there was no vaccine program for tuberculosis or cholera, which were two of the major killers in the early 1900s.

02:48:38.753 --> 02:48:45.235
Feel free to find the non-corrupted video and forward it to me by email and I'll upload it to the Batcave for sure.

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:46.195
This is awesome.

02:48:47.996 --> 02:48:49.356
Vaccines are what's saving us.

02:48:54.315 --> 02:49:08.028
We cannot expect to create immunity, particularly herd immunity, which has never been seen in synthetic situations.

02:49:08.048 --> 02:49:10.571
So herd immunity does not come from vaccines.

02:49:11.031 --> 02:49:16.677
It comes from natural exposure through the natural immune pathway, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the mouth.

02:49:17.992 --> 02:49:28.635
It takes the body to actually, you have to get that disease, even if you don't show symptoms, you have to be exposed and get that disease through the natural process before herd immunity can be created.

02:49:29.055 --> 02:49:29.556
Interesting.

02:49:30.036 --> 02:49:31.776
It cannot be created through vaccines.

02:49:31.976 --> 02:49:33.117
It cannot be created through the arm.

02:49:33.157 --> 02:49:34.817
It cannot be created through synthetic versions.

02:49:36.838 --> 02:49:37.138
All right.

02:49:37.638 --> 02:49:39.639
She is saying things that she cannot say.

02:49:39.739 --> 02:49:43.500
This is way, way, way, way, way past the pale here.

02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:47.962
Um, she would definitely need to be killed.

02:49:49.803 --> 02:49:56.548
And I suspect that she was just in case you didn't get what the other slide meant.

02:49:56.668 --> 02:49:58.750
I thought I'd throw this one out.

02:49:58.790 --> 02:50:00.111
This is United States mortality rate.

02:50:00.191 --> 02:50:04.754
There's the slide that they had covering the slide that she wanted you to take a picture of.

02:50:04.834 --> 02:50:07.076
Cause she wasn't sure how long it would be available.

02:50:07.116 --> 02:50:08.457
That's extraordinary to me.

02:50:09.887 --> 02:50:11.789
historically from 1900 to 1963.

02:50:13.511 --> 02:50:17.976
Again, 1963 is when the passage of the Vaccine Act.

02:50:18.537 --> 02:50:21.500
There was no widespread vaccination until the 1960s.

02:50:22.101 --> 02:50:29.109
So, this graph includes measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, whooping cough, and diphtheria.

02:50:29.813 --> 02:50:32.694
Yeah, we had some issues in the early 1900s.

02:50:33.194 --> 02:50:35.094
We had two massive world wars.

02:50:35.594 --> 02:50:37.815
All of our resources were being sent overseas.

02:50:37.875 --> 02:50:42.536
People had to have stamps and line up at the, you know, hour line waits for milk.

02:50:43.416 --> 02:50:47.037
We had no, we didn't have clean water systems, we didn't have sanitation systems.

02:50:47.497 --> 02:50:49.798
Hand washing, penicillin, all of these things.

02:50:50.058 --> 02:50:50.778
We didn't have that.

02:50:51.704 --> 02:50:56.566
And included in these death rates are all the soldiers that were sent overseas, right?

02:50:56.946 --> 02:50:59.407
And the one- Without antibiotics.

02:51:00.028 --> 02:51:00.828
Think about that.

02:51:02.589 --> 02:51:06.770
Getting epidemics because they didn't have food, nutrition, clean water in the trenches.

02:51:07.811 --> 02:51:09.091
We also had the great depression.

02:51:10.172 --> 02:51:11.792
We also had the industrial revolution.

02:51:12.433 --> 02:51:15.074
That is what was happening early on.

02:51:15.734 --> 02:51:19.936
And again, without the vaccines for cholera, TB, scarlet fever,

02:51:20.987 --> 02:51:22.007
We don't have them today.

02:51:22.027 --> 02:51:24.928
It wasn't the vaccines that saved us.

02:51:26.408 --> 02:51:26.928
But guess what?

02:51:27.169 --> 02:51:28.969
People are starting to figure this out, right?

02:51:29.229 --> 02:51:32.810
Because you can't spell pharma without the word harm.

02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:34.190
Do you see that?

02:51:35.250 --> 02:51:36.111
True story.

02:51:38.311 --> 02:51:44.313
Maybe that's, if you take one thing away from this today, pharma spells harm, right?

02:51:45.113 --> 02:51:49.374
Alright, pharma has to mandate vaccines because people are starting to like, hmm,

02:51:50.703 --> 02:51:51.943
Not so sure about vaccines.

02:51:52.023 --> 02:51:53.484
Some of this information is getting out there.

02:51:53.524 --> 02:51:57.284
Again, we have a lot of amazing doctors and scientists that are coming out.

02:51:57.705 --> 02:52:04.226
The information is getting out there in 2016 and then CHD and ICANN took over and.

02:52:09.767 --> 02:52:11.908
And saying, Hey, something is going wrong here.

02:52:12.128 --> 02:52:17.749
They lose their licenses usually and they lose their careers unfortunately, but they are leading the way.

02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:21.021
to getting this information out to the public and this knowledge.

02:52:21.141 --> 02:52:22.062
Knowledge is power.

02:52:23.963 --> 02:52:24.944
But, guess what?

02:52:25.444 --> 02:52:33.048
Pharmaceutical companies, they're starting to mandate vaccines for children because parents are used to going to the doctor, right?

02:52:33.188 --> 02:52:36.370
We've been indoctrinated that we have to take our healthy babies to the doctor, right?

02:52:36.971 --> 02:52:39.932
So it's easier to train parents and to get the vaccines into children.

02:52:40.272 --> 02:52:46.896
And if everybody thinks that vaccines are normal in a childhood population, then maybe we'll think they're more normal for adults, right?

02:52:49.093 --> 02:52:51.115
Adults don't really like vaccines, right?

02:52:51.335 --> 02:52:52.936
We kind of are like, uh, that needle.

02:52:53.617 --> 02:52:56.480
Uh, yeah, you know, I think I'm going to, I'm going to hold my own.

02:52:56.520 --> 02:52:57.441
You know, I'm an adult now.

02:52:57.541 --> 02:52:58.481
I got this, right?

02:52:58.702 --> 02:53:05.568
According to the CDC, 85% of adults are not up to date on their vaccines.

02:53:05.588 --> 02:53:09.251
85% of adults are not up to date on their flu vaccines in America in 2016.

02:53:10.012 --> 02:53:11.974
It sounds like they have a problem.

02:53:12.014 --> 02:53:13.095
They need to rectify.

02:53:14.127 --> 02:53:21.949
Because otherwise, the population pyramid problem won't be easy to manage if these people won't take intramuscular injection when they tell them to.

02:53:22.829 --> 02:53:34.031
Maybe we should put a bunch of people on social media to replace people like Brandy, and then we should stage a RNA pandemic narrative that convinces adults to take shingle shots.

02:53:36.792 --> 02:53:38.992
That is where we are.

02:53:42.208 --> 02:53:45.129
Brandy saw it coming, and Brandy's dead.

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:51.151
There are over 120 vaccines on the CDC adult schedule.

02:53:51.171 --> 02:53:55.553
85% of us adults are resisting, right?

02:53:55.693 --> 02:53:59.674
It's changing in years now with all of the pressure and free money to get flu shots.

02:53:59.695 --> 02:54:02.516
Do you ever wonder why they have to pay you to get a flu shot?

02:54:04.056 --> 02:54:06.217
Yeah, that should be a trigger right there.

02:54:06.817 --> 02:54:08.778
If someone has to pay you to buy their car,

02:54:10.202 --> 02:54:13.524
Is that a car you want?

02:54:13.964 --> 02:54:15.005
They're coming after adults.

02:54:15.325 --> 02:54:17.065
That's where the real money is to be made.

02:54:17.806 --> 02:54:20.527
It's in the 85% of adults that are no longer up to date.

02:54:21.087 --> 02:54:29.331
And they're passing mandatory vaccine laws for children first and then for different subsets of adults so that not all of us stand up and fight at once.

02:54:29.911 --> 02:54:31.212
Do you not hear it?

02:54:31.812 --> 02:54:34.053
Oh my gosh, it's hilarious, isn't it?

02:54:34.113 --> 02:54:35.334
It's like, what, wait, what?

02:54:35.794 --> 02:54:37.455
There was this lady, she was real?

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:39.861
2016, DTAP and stuff wasn't required?

02:54:39.881 --> 02:54:43.244
Do you see where we are, ladies and gentlemen?

02:54:43.264 --> 02:54:46.907
If you don't understand your history, you will lose.

02:54:46.927 --> 02:54:51.730
If you don't understand the history of these people, you will lose.

02:55:08.390 --> 02:55:11.411
Their history reveals their traitorous behavior.

02:55:13.432 --> 02:55:18.613
Different sections of the adult community until all of us are going to be vaccinated.

02:55:18.793 --> 02:55:19.113
Really?

02:55:19.253 --> 02:55:22.474
If we want healthcare, because guess what?

02:55:23.815 --> 02:55:26.395
How are they going to push it through on a federal level?

02:55:27.156 --> 02:55:27.396
Right?

02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:31.697
When you mandate universal healthcare, you can mandate almost anything within it.

02:55:32.233 --> 02:55:36.977
So I have a lot of people that are like, Brandy, they're never gonna get me, they're not gonna get me to roll up my sleeve.

02:55:36.997 --> 02:55:38.158
And I'm like, oh, do you have healthcare?

02:55:38.498 --> 02:55:41.701
Well, of course, I'm on three different medications every day.

02:55:42.181 --> 02:55:44.743
Well, then they're gonna get you.

02:55:45.364 --> 02:55:51.008
Because health insurance companies, they're beholden to pharmaceutical companies.

02:55:51.409 --> 02:56:01.797
Pharmaceutical companies have a stranglehold on health insurance companies because they give them discounts and kickbacks on very expensive drugs, very expensive EpiPens, all of these things.

02:56:02.424 --> 02:56:04.064
if they follow their rules.

02:56:04.425 --> 02:56:05.485
Well, what are pharma's rules?

02:56:05.865 --> 02:56:12.766
They want everybody vaccinated, including mostly our 85%, which is going to be worth trillions of dollars.

02:56:12.866 --> 02:56:19.428
She is telling you right now that there's trillions of dollars to be made to vaccinate adults in America in 2016.

02:56:19.528 --> 02:56:20.368
Was CHD saying that?

02:56:25.205 --> 02:56:27.066
Was CHD even thinking that?

02:56:27.946 --> 02:56:31.567
Did CHD say that we have to end the vaccine schedule?

02:56:32.267 --> 02:56:33.968
No, they just want health freedom.

02:56:34.008 --> 02:56:35.268
They want freedom to choose.

02:56:38.029 --> 02:56:42.550
They want a big top tent of health freedom where everybody can say what they want to, where everybody has a voice.

02:56:43.711 --> 02:56:51.833
Brandy Vaughn and I would like to change the world all by ourselves if we have to, to make sure that every child in the future is safe from this mythology.

02:56:52.713 --> 02:56:54.354
Very different objectives.

02:56:56.965 --> 02:56:59.347
85% of adults in the U.S.

02:56:59.367 --> 02:57:00.348
300 vaccines in the works.

02:57:01.208 --> 02:57:06.051
All types of companies are getting in the vaccine game now because that's where the money's to be made.

02:57:06.532 --> 02:57:13.697
Chemical companies are now, Monsanto actually, right before Bayer bought them, it was going into vaccines.

02:57:13.977 --> 02:57:16.078
This is where people are going now for money.

02:57:17.559 --> 02:57:19.100
So, what can we do?

02:57:20.601 --> 02:57:21.802
What can we do about this?

02:57:22.683 --> 02:57:26.085
The biggest thing is we have to understand

02:57:26.906 --> 02:57:27.847
The bigger picture.

02:57:28.727 --> 02:57:30.008
The Mayo Clinic website.

02:57:30.348 --> 02:57:33.831
Cancer is a mutation of genes after birth.

02:57:34.511 --> 02:57:35.752
This is not genetic.

02:57:36.173 --> 02:57:40.015
Do not fall for the, oh, you have bad genetics line.

02:57:40.456 --> 02:57:41.296
Do not fall for it.

02:57:42.457 --> 02:57:47.861
Cancer is a mutation of genes after birth, due most often to environmental toxins.

02:57:48.493 --> 02:57:51.074
Smoking, radiation, toxic chemicals, pollution.

02:57:51.394 --> 02:57:53.234
She's telling you everything that I'm telling you.

02:57:53.354 --> 02:57:58.576
It's absolutely remarkable that cancer is usually not due to some genetic cause.

02:57:59.116 --> 02:58:03.477
That vulnerabilities to vaccines is not a genetic cause.

02:58:06.698 --> 02:58:08.539
Ignore the genetic causes.

02:58:11.351 --> 02:58:13.732
Brandy Vaughn was killed because she's got it right.

02:58:14.453 --> 02:58:35.323
And with my own work and my own due diligence and my own stupidity and wandering through this narrative, I too have arrived finally in the end at the place where Brandy is that injection, intramuscular injection of a combination of substances and calling that medicine is so stupid.

02:58:38.939 --> 02:58:40.881
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a three hour show.

02:58:40.921 --> 02:58:42.142
I think I'm gonna end it right here.

02:58:42.182 --> 02:58:45.565
There's still, half of her talk is still going on.

02:58:45.585 --> 02:58:47.367
I think it's because she answers questions.

02:58:48.288 --> 02:58:55.354
She's ending the talk right here, right now, with why is nobody talking about the fact that injection versus ingestion.

02:58:55.815 --> 02:58:59.118
She's actually saying what I'm saying in a different way.

02:58:59.558 --> 02:59:02.101
Intramuscular injection is just plain dumb.

02:59:06.388 --> 02:59:07.690
I love it, ladies and gentlemen.

02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:08.271
I love it.

02:59:08.371 --> 02:59:13.339
I love the fact that you were here to witness this, to be a part of this exploratory thing.

02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:15.203
We are in 2025, and I think there's a lot of reason for hope.

02:59:17.978 --> 02:59:21.700
There's a lot of reason for hope because PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud.

02:59:22.161 --> 02:59:31.587
The only thing they have is synthetic recombinant genetics that has allowed them to make protein biologics for the last 20 years, including monoclonal antibodies.

02:59:31.627 --> 02:59:34.469
And that means that they can make a lot of pure DNA.

02:59:34.509 --> 02:59:37.651
And that means that they can put it somewhere and they could find it.

02:59:37.691 --> 02:59:47.358
And that would be enough for them to turn a loud background into evidence of spread, especially if they were allowed to use their own PCR diagnostics.

02:59:48.203 --> 02:59:51.486
The reason why they would do this is because transfection is a crime.

02:59:52.206 --> 02:59:56.570
He would never do this to a healthy person, but they intend to do it to all of us.

02:59:57.150 --> 03:00:04.196
And so they rolled out placebo to make sure that the vast majority of people would be unaware that these transfections are toxic.

03:00:05.317 --> 03:00:16.947
And they will slowly roll away the placebos and roll in the hot shots for all the shingles and pneumonia and everything the adults need, just like Brandy warned us about 10 years ago.

03:00:18.658 --> 03:00:26.620
One of the foundational myths of this immunomythology is the idea that an RNA molecule leaked in a mud puddle can go endemic after five years.

03:00:27.481 --> 03:00:28.861
Stop lying!

03:00:31.382 --> 03:00:34.963
Ladies and gentlemen, they use non-specific PCR tests to lie about it.

03:00:36.141 --> 03:00:37.383
RNA cannot pandemic.

03:00:37.923 --> 03:00:51.659
And the only person on the internet right now that's saying RNA cannot pandemic, that intramuscular injection is dumb, like Brandy Vaughn said before she was dead, transfecting healthy humans is always a crime and the population pyramids problem exists.

03:00:52.665 --> 03:00:53.145
is me.

03:00:53.785 --> 03:00:54.946
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

03:00:54.986 --> 03:00:56.766
I come to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

03:00:56.806 --> 03:01:04.768
This has been GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief that indicates very clearly the team worst case scenario.

03:01:05.308 --> 03:01:07.228
These guys are the criminals.

03:01:07.648 --> 03:01:12.909
These guys are the ones that are responsible for the limited spectrum of debate that we are currently trapped in.

03:01:17.390 --> 03:01:18.631
Thank you very much for joining me.

03:01:19.231 --> 03:01:20.191
I'll see you again tomorrow.

03:01:21.212 --> 03:01:21.614
Yee-haw.

03:01:21.634 --> 03:01:22.740
Yee-haw.
