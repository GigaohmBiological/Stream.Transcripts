00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
This was some updating and some updating, but you know that takes a little while, I apologize.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It's embarrassing.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh, come on, you're kidding me.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Why isn't it playing?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I got no music.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It's like something happened over here.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Crash monkey.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Let's try it again.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
There it goes.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Had to crank it up a little bit or something.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I don't know what happened there.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
This is Gigo on Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Brought to you by a biologist.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
We're still waiting for the Zoom meeting to start in the background.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I got to assume that it's going to start because my friend has been reliable in the past

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
and hopefully we will get this all set up.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Exciting times, ladies and gentlemen.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
We're getting lots of views on our recent discussion with Law Alexander.

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
There was also a rumble stream that happened yesterday with Jessica Rose, John Bodwin, among others.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
And that went off really well on rumble, which was exciting.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
The Zoom meeting is scheduled for 12 o'clock, so I hope that we're just warming up the engines

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and getting that going.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'll pull that link up.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Does the title not say who I'm zooming with?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Hopefully that's going to come true.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
This is Gigo on Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Stream.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Brought to you by a biologist, Jonathan Cooley.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Hello, that's me.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Thank you very much for joining me.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
I have a meeting scheduled with Juan Michael Eden and Paul Elias Alexander at noon today.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And I'm hoping that we can stream that together.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And we'll have a brief conversation with Michael about what he's seen and where his mind is.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
And then we'll try to run the infectious clones idea past him and see what he thinks about it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So this is quite exciting.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
But like I said, if the Zoom meeting over here doesn't start, then we're not going to have the show.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
That's why I didn't really schedule it because I wasn't absolutely sure that's what happened.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I think Michael is somewhere on the other side of the planet.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
But we're waiting for the host to start the meeting and we'll see where we are.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Hopefully this all goes well.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
How is everyone?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
49 viewers already.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Let's take a minute here.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
See if we, I guess that's always going to go off.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
So I'm just going to put that off now.

04:10.000 --> 04:19.000
Maybe I'll set on some other music that will hopefully set the stage for what we're trying to do here.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
And then we will take a look at this rumble stream.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
See if we can get that up right now because that's a great place to default to if this meeting doesn't come through.

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
Keep in mind that as this has been spreading around, ladies and gentlemen, there's good reason to believe that

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
it's good reason to believe that people will start to intervene now to try and stop this information from getting any further than it's already gotten.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
And so if you think for one second that suddenly there's going to be a flood and everything's going to be fine.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
If we're right about this, the resistance to this idea is going to quadruple right now.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I think we came.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Hello.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I hear one.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm very excited.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Looks like Alexander's got his, Dr. Alexander has his IT person with him, so it's fine.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Excellent.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
He's so good.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
It's a terrible thing that technology crap.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
That technology crap is terrible, Paul.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Don't let it frustrate you.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Hey, Jake, can you hear me?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I can.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Did you see me?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I can.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Okay, so I'm on.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Excellent.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
So what's going to happen is that, um, Twitter, I mean Zoom does like 35 minutes, so I'm not recording yet.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Zoom does like, um.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
35 minutes and then locks off.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
So I have two streams.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
So when that locks off, then I will, um, could read then I'll remind you if you could then reconnect to zoom again for the second.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Um, link, please.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Um, did you the one in my email or?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, you have link one and then you have link two.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:28.000
The reason for this is Jay is I, and I want you to give me your stream to to amplify, but I have a huge following to one rumble and I've found that your, um, our interview did really well.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So we have a huge following there and on sub stack.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
So I want to take it quickly and put it into rumble, blah, blah, blah.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
But anyway, I'm glad we become good friends too, because there are a lot of IT stuff.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
I'll be blunt that I am not an IT person and we try and bumble our way.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And, uh, like I know nothing in IT.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I use it, but I don't know it.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And I'd like to learn things from you.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm just letting you know in the future.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
One thing that's really great is that I have basically not fired any of those cannons yet.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I can edit videos.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
I can post them all over the place, but right now I only live stream and I've been saving that as the next step.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:22.000
So once we're ready and once we've got the content that we need, we're, we're going to be able to edit and make as many videos as you want.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
So you have other people on right now.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I do not just you.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
That's it.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Me and you.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, I'm, I'm streaming already.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
There's 48 people watching, but these are the same people who are already already always here.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Dr. Eden.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Dr. Eden just texts me and said he's running about eight minutes late.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh my gosh.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
This is the most exciting day of my recent adult life.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I can't tell you how excited I am.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Holy cow.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I feel like there's more music.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
We need like, you know, if we were really to do this right, we would need to do something like this.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, you know, if Michael Eden is coming on the show, we should do something like this.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
And now the starting lineup for your world champion.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You know what this is?

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
This is when the Chicago Bulls would announce the starting lineup with Michael Jordan.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
This is the music they used.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
This is the music that Michael you should have on when he comes out.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
That's awesome.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That makes that makes me happy.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I'll just leave that back there.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
If you could do it.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I've also gotten a lot of very good response.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
My typical video on Twitch after 24 hours when I'm.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You got it.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
When I'm really lucky has about 20.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
About 2,200 views.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
And your interview has 9,000 so far just on Twitch.

08:55.000 --> 09:04.000
It has another 1,000 on Rumble, another 1,000 on Vimeo and another 600 on BitShoot and like 200 on Odyssey.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So it's way over 10 grand.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And I've never had a video go over 10 grand in less than three days.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So that's we're crushing it, man.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
We're crushing it.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm telling you.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
And it's only just started.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Today that video is shooting.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Like it's doing about 1,000 every four hours.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So that's really fast.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And that's just on Twitch which nobody watches.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Like people hate that thing.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's the only reason why I'm allowed to stay there.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So we're going to promote this.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Put it everywhere.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
And it'll go just as fast.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
And I think what is this interesting about with you is people like in my substock.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
All of the responses are that they're so grateful.

09:44.000 --> 09:57.000
That first of all, I would interview with you and that people are giving you the space to try and unravel and unpack your theory, et cetera.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And what you're thinking because the reality is we don't want censorship and all of that.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
And more importantly, you have very valuable things to see.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
You're not just anywhere in the individual.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It's a lot of things.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Like I was speaking to Dr. Amalynn recently.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Richard Amalynn.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
And he's he, you know, because we do some stuff with the wellness company.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
First of all, sons company with their with their.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What do you call that?

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
The online healthcare and the supplements, et cetera.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
And what Amalynn told me, you know, when we touch base on you and your work is the time.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
He learned so much listening to you.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's the key.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
He said there are things that.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
And he thought he's an expert that he didn't think about and he didn't understand, realize until some things that you had said.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
So, which is a very good thing to me.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And so on.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
You know, look, we, we, we in a space J where there's a lot of competition for airtime.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
And somehow the others created me a song.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
Some people have decided, you know, like animal, animal farm, that book.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Some pigs are more special than other pigs.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Right?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh, man, I forgot to push the cut.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
There we go.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yes, I get it.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
So that's how they do it. And depending on what I'm saying.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
They move that way to with somebody like me is not that they don't want to hear what I'm saying.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
But depending on how hard I'm pushing back and what the topic is.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
So it's just very interesting that even within the freedom movement.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Their censorship.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
As crazy as what I just said, I'm telling you, I am, I was involved with the, I know you're not taping on every just talking, even if people are listening.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It doesn't matter.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I was involved three years ago with Dr. McCullough.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Dr Zalenko, et cetera.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
It's like live though, just so you're very, very aware of it.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's like live live.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm not editing this.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
People are listening.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Okay.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah, but we just talking.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Right.

12:21.000 --> 12:40.000
And when we, when this started on, you know, Zalenko and McCullough, they were talking about, you know, we pushing out the early treatment and, you know, I became part of that group to write the papers and to sort out the algorithm, et cetera.

12:41.000 --> 12:53.000
So we were involved from the beginning to start the freedom movement in the United States, the COVID-19 freedom movement. And then I was involved in starting in Canada, et cetera.

12:53.000 --> 13:05.000
I have found, which is the most remarkable thing to me is that as it has grown within it, it has its own, its life.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
It's so funny that people group develop alliances and groups within the group.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
And who they find is their favorite person and who they like and don't like.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm mortified by these people on outrage because we all fight enough fighting trying to slay one dragon.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
And we have lives to save.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
You have to set personalities on that bullshit aside.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You have no time for games.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
But a lot of these people play games.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
You know, YJ?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It's about money.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
It's about donor money.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And trying to get money out of each other's pockets.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
And they have to come up with the most creative ways of doing that.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
And somewhere in there, a lot of these people, I call them today, grifters.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
They have lost sight of what this was about.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's not about you.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
This is about informing people, sharing information, you know what I mean?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And et cetera.

14:03.000 --> 14:14.000
So I found myself in interviews where the interviewer, who is interviewing me after five minutes,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I realized, but wait, this is more about them than me.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I couldn't even get to speak.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
You know what I mean?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
It's like they advertising themselves.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
So you two have to be very careful because, because as you emerge properly, and I think

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
rightfully, you're going to find out that depending on your brand and the attractiveness

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
to it.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Yes.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Let's go stop.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Hello, Michael.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Hello there.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Hello there.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
How are you?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I couldn't, I couldn't be happier right now.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I've been waiting for this for, it seems like three years.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh, wow.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, I'm probably going to disappoint you because I'm not the, I'm not the scientist.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You are.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I mean, you read lots of papers.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm not an academic and I'm usually mild off the pace, but I might come up occasionally

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
with a, with a gem of a deduction, but that's probably the best I can do these days.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
You were the one that held a lantern up and made me brave enough to read these papers, my

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
book.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Well, there you go.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I always say to people it wasn't, wasn't really encouraged.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
And that's because in a, in a heartbeat, almost when I realized when I, when, when basically

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
when lockdown happened, I knew at that point, I could outline why I knew it.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
I knew this meant totalitarianity and depopulation, but I'm good at that.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Making deductions from very little data.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I was certain.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
That's what it meant.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
And it's because 60 countries at once did something that made no sense that did not match their own

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
pandemic preparedness plans and was counted to common sense, you know, I was destructive.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
And that meant since it wouldn't help anyone, but we've damaged business.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
That meant the people who own money and capital must have approved the operation.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And since that means they're not doing it for monetary reasons, since they sit, describe

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
the money creation process must be another reason.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
And very quickly, we knew they were talking about vaccine passports with that ghastly,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
heavy glare and other people.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And I just put it all together.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Digital ID everywhere will be a restricted threshold.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
And I knew vaccines made no sense.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
You can't, you can't vaccinate against.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
You can't vaccinate using an injected vaccine against an inhaled pathogen.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
If you believe they exist at all, which I certainly did at the time.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
But they can't work with, you know, because you generate a best detail memory.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And at worst, circulating antibodies that don't penetrate the airway.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
I also knew that the Cochrane reviews are through the vaccines, but they actually don't work.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Probably this is a thought, speculatively.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
But because the older, the frailer people have less responsive immune systems.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
So we've got an overlap problem here with the people who are most likely to die,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
the ones who are least capable of benefiting from a vaccine.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I think that's true.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
And the people who could respond well to a vaccine, if it was properly designed,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
don't need it because they're able to throw it off.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
And so, you know, and then also I've worked on.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
MRNA and SIRNA technologies just on the side.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I had a postdoc doing some work on the side.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
And that was 12 years early before I'd left Pfizer.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And we agreed it was hopelessly distant from grind time.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
We could not get the materials to penetrate cells in vivo,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
except when we injected them and then they went to the liver.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
And if we inhaled them, they would either break down or simply not penetrate epithelial cells.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
We were using the SIF rays, you know, just to see if we could get a marker in and we couldn't do it.

18:09.000 --> 18:18.000
So when I heard a decade later that my former employer and others were rushing a vaccine using this technology to people,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I knew it couldn't have been fixed.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
And I did several literature surveys to look for the, what was the magic bullet that had arrived in the 10 years that I'd missed and there wasn't one.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
So I thought this is going to be dangerous.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
So, yeah, so that's that I came in very early, but I say I worked it out.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I didn't really work it out on March 23.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
I will say when I allowed myself to put the bits together in the SIR,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
I could then retroface it to the lockdown.

18:49.000 --> 19:02.000
I realized it didn't need any new information beyond lockdown in the context of it being unprecedented and going on in multiple countries at the same time, which, as I say,

19:02.000 --> 19:12.000
it needs to be a conspiracy theorist to say, well, that's evidence of a super national action in the only way it could possibly happen.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah. And so things got more and more confirmed as the year went on.

19:17.000 --> 19:31.000
And you'll remember that Dr. Wolfgang Bodag and I wrote a public petition before any injection had emergency use authorization warning them of several toxicities.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
We missed several important months.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
We're not perfect, but the ones we pointed out have come true.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
So I've been warning people not to take these things since before they arrived.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
And of course, not have one myself.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
So, yeah, I wish I wish we could wait more people up.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
So, you know, gentlemen and ladies listening.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
I always think that's my mission because I can't save me.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You know, I can't save anyone.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
I can't save myself because having this information doesn't give you.

20:04.000 --> 20:12.000
It's an unusual occasion where you can have a very good idea what the stress is and not be able to protect yourself very well against it.

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
So it's ever so clever the way these, I call them the perpetrators, by the way, because I don't know who they are, but roughly, I call them the perpetrators.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
And also it doesn't have any suggestion of any particular religious group because I know people get in trouble when they say globalists.

20:28.000 --> 20:40.000
So the perpetrators, they, on one hand in Britain, they're talking about introducing digital ID for everybody who files their own taxes.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
So that's from this year. And it's, it's also with like one gut.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
It's called one dot gavel something's like your central database thing.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You know what this is going to be.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
So it'll be the world's first common format interoperable,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
database, and it'll start with just new, you know, some basic information.

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
But, you know, sure as it is, it will soon have your financial information, your health information, including quits vaccine status.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And, you know, that's all that's needed.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
And then the last bit of slapping the.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Payings together is coming up with a pretext to it to introduce central bank digital currencies.

21:23.000 --> 21:33.000
And at the same time, gliding cash off the table or making it so difficult to use practically that you'll be forced to use electronic money and that.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
There's one.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm still hanging my hat on something, but I know it's very.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It's a very weak thing to do.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I heard a couple of people talking about CBDCs and AI.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Now, I didn't know anything about AI, but there were two gentlemen that were interviewed by a good person.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I can't remember who it is now.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Jane, Jane's selling part.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
So two of them said they'd worked in AI.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
One was in finance.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
And they said they thought that the perpetrators were.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
We're running a long way ahead of the actual capabilities.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
So, you know, I don't know.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't know anything about computers, but what I do know is whenever you phone up your lecture to your gas company and you get a computer.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Right.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
The bloody thing is hopeless.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
How many you're not filling up to buy a piece, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Or you're not you're not filling up to get psychoanalysis.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
You're probably filling up about your meter reading or you're moving.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
You know, whatever.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
Given there are very constrained set of things you could possibly want to fill up your utility company about.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
My experience is they always fail.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I mean, hopeless, almost amusingly bad.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Whether you're typing on a keyboard or trying your best to speak.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Code of O, code of a speak.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
The thing goes.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
It literally just comes out of its bedroom all over with its panther and examples.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
So that's the shape of things to come.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
I feel a bit more optimistic about their inability to control us with AI.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But that's probably helpful.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
So anyway, that's.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
You've brought up so many things that I want to pick at because I think there's a couple really nice pivots here and I want to keep you talking.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
So first, you mentioned, and this is good to get us to where we need to go.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Don't worry, Paul.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I got it.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
Michael, you mentioned that you talked with and agreed with early on with Wolfgang Woda.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
He and you, I believe you could correct me if I'm wrong.

23:35.000 --> 23:45.000
Are two people that very early on suggested that there were before the pandemic, hundreds of different causes for respiratory disease that we never bothered to identify.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And now suddenly we're identifying them.

23:48.000 --> 24:00.000
This one key piece of biology stuck with me for three years and it's still a crucial part of what I want to say today. Can you expand on that and fill that in.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Well, just.

24:04.000 --> 24:23.000
I think having worked in the field of respiratory for a long time, I think that the signs and symptoms that people present with are as much or more a consequence of their own status when challenged as, as opposed to a characteristic

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
consequence of the thing that's made the meal.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
So it's put it another way.

24:28.000 --> 24:42.000
Again, I'm going to have to put the camera accepting for the moment the viral model of transmission because I'm having serious problems about this, but regardless of what I think that stick with the model of your common colds and.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Oh, we're going to have such a good conversation today.

24:47.000 --> 25:00.000
I know I don't know what I know anymore. That's the most, that's the humble point, whereas I used to be really sure, but when I examined it, I was only sure because someone had told me and it seemed to fit.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
But when you actually examine it, it's not, it doesn't seem so sound.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Luckily, I don't just for the record. I don't believe there was.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
I don't think there was a novel respiratory pathogen respiratory infection myself that calls this.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
What if I told you that I think I have a biological explanation for.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, that'd be great.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I've wrote it down beforehand that why do we even think there's a novel virus.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I've asked people this because they get crossed when I when I question whether it exists or not.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
I said, well, what's the evidence that there is what they think for a long time and they go.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
We've been told the was, I said, yeah, so the perpetrators, the people who have lied about everything else.

25:43.000 --> 25:51.000
Lockdowns, masks, mass testing, border controls, business closures, those people and the vaccines, you know, those people.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
I told you it was a virus. So, how much confidence did you ascribe to the information came largely from a bunch of proven criminal lives.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
That's one thing.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
The other one is dodgy methods and publications.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
So, I know there's papers that claim to have identified from, you know, a person who was allegedly ill with COVID.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
How the hell when it was COVID is nothing characteristic about this disease.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
There really isn't. So, but so dodgy methods and publications with the other arm.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And then the other one people go, well, obviously there was the vaccine.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Lots of people were ill. I said lots of people it all the time.

26:29.000 --> 26:38.000
About 1% of people die every year and probably 10% have an illness bad enough to remark about every year.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
So, I think simply bad testing, misattribution and confirmation bias explains the rest.

26:45.000 --> 26:55.000
But in practice, there's three reasons why I don't think there was a new pathogen laws that the epidemiology does not is not consistent with it.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And that's I have to blame Dennis Langport here.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
But the epidemiology just looks wrong.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
The leaders behavior. Remember, we need to treat this like a crime scene and not a scientific experiment only.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
It's a crime scene because it is a crime scene.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
So, on leaders behavior, they're skipping around, hugging each other, having parties, remember.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
That meant they have no fear.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
And I think they have no fear because they knew there was no new public health risk.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.000
And then finally, I go back to our good friends, the perpetrators.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
Imagine, I mean, this couldn't fall out of the back of a white van one afternoon.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Someone thought about this and discussed it with senior colleagues.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
However, they relate to each other as it's bulk and mind control.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
They asked have met and have chats.

27:49.000 --> 27:58.000
And we know that there's 25 years worth of tabletop simulation of either bio warfare or infectious disease pandemic.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
So they were going to do something like this, whether it's, you know, however they were going to do it.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And I came up a couple of weeks ago.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
I thought the inherent variability of outcomes.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
We got our heads together and used the best technology.

28:14.000 --> 28:21.000
We were able to cook up a gain of function material that was capable of being transmitted and replicated itself.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I don't know whether that's possible. I have friends who are not sure it is. I don't know.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
But let's say that's what we decided to do.

28:29.000 --> 28:38.000
Then we would need to find some way of getting it out into the public so we could scare the pants off them to steal the words of one of our British ministers.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
But think of the inherent variability.

28:41.000 --> 28:48.000
Let's say you're presenting to the senior perpetrators in these shadowy figures.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
And they ask you if no conflict are you, this won't fade out in the first few days or weeks.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
And you go, well, I'm not 100% confident.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
It might do that.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Okay.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
So make a little note.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
You know, say, in terms of the least hours, you've tested it.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
Have you been in Ukraine or perhaps we as in China?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
We haven't done that.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Okay.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
So how, what's the least hours that you're expecting to have?

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
And they'll say green what point one and one percent.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And they go, that seems a huge variation to me.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
The top end could perhaps civilization, couldn't it?

29:24.000 --> 29:33.000
If it, if it's quickly in sort of population center that was important, you could disable the world's oil supply or chip factories or something.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And then the perfect, you know, the scientists would go, yeah, that's probably true.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So I'm summarizing now as a perpetrator.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Oh, no, I get it.

29:41.000 --> 29:53.000
You've just told me that you could release this material and it might fade out in a couple of weeks, or it might go wealthy, like the goldilocks scenario, but it might be more lethal than we would hope.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
And there's an outside chance at all crash civilization.

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
I think I've turned to the people on my left and right and say, in ladies and gentlemen, we're not doing that.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
So come back with something that's much more controllable.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
And I think what they came back with was exactly the same plan, except they didn't release anything.

30:10.000 --> 30:22.000
They just told us they did and use doggy tests, papers with thoughty methods and bad publications and the misattribution confirmation bias and fear did the rest.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
That's why I think I think you're so exactly on the money with about 95% of what I think.

30:30.000 --> 30:38.000
And if I just teach it, just tell you this one story or point this one thing out about virology that you may not be aware of.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
I think everything else will fall right into place and you'll it'll be like a light bulb because it did it for me.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That's exactly how it happened for me.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Okay.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
I wonder, do you think Paul should I just show him now or is that appropriate?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
How should we do this?

30:54.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah, and I just wanted to say, you know, we skipped introductions because Dr. Eden Mike, Mike is the guest star today.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And we're so grateful.

31:05.000 --> 31:15.000
I just wanted to add one thing that he said, so you can go ahead, Jake, is that that table top exercises over 25 years that Eden mentioned, they all ended one way.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
They funneled us towards vaccine, all of them.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Yeah.

31:19.000 --> 31:28.000
And when you said Jay about the not being novel and Dr. Eden, I will, I will then remind the listeners this.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
We had in February, 2020, a ship outside on the city diamond princess.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
3,700 people, which the virus burnt out at 19%.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Only 90% of the close ship got infected.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
What we found only seven died.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Only seven.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
The median age was around 81 on that ship of the dead people.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
Number one, but key is this we had instances where husband and wife was recruited in a cabin.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
The husband had hot COVID and he died in that cabin.

32:04.000 --> 32:13.000
And the wife didn't even get infected. You need to ask yourself why that diamond princess pretty much told us this was not a novel virus.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
We, our immune system saw this virus in some capacity before.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And that's what I want.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah, no, I agree with you.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
I, you know, to the extent that the infectious, whatever you call it.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
To not to rain. Anyway, yeah, the infectious principle.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
If that is what happens, then, yeah, you can't draw the conclusion other than that.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
It was pre existing in unity of some substantial amount.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
So, yeah, and then we might be getting into semantics.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
So.

32:46.000 --> 32:55.000
If you, if you had a modified pathogen that was by definition novel, but had a lot in common, you know, 80% similar.

32:55.000 --> 33:06.000
Then your immune system would see that as the same. You would have no difficulty in recognizing you've been infected by its brother as I see described it. So, yeah, I've got to be careful with the words.

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
I know people get upset sometimes that something can be novel and yet, and yet have immune memory.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
The reason that's explained.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Jay, we have, you know, so much you want to say and you are the star.

33:19.000 --> 33:28.000
So, not a star. This is just, this is just the biology. I just have always wanted to show it to Michael. So I'm very excited to be able to do it.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
I believe Michael that there's a trick that the virology field has been hiding.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
And I think most virologists are unaware of the implications of it.

33:37.000 --> 33:49.000
But I think people like David Baltimore, Vincent Rancin yellow, the people that were at there at the beginning of retroviruses and at the beginning of cancer and viruses like like Robert Gallo.

33:49.000 --> 33:57.000
These people all know that over time, the model of viruses as a pathogen should have changed and it didn't.

33:57.000 --> 34:08.000
The main thing that I want to teach or not teach, I don't want to sound like I'm teaching anybody anything, but I want to reveal to you is I can get my my mouse to be in the right place.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh, yeah, sorry. It's this computer. I forgot.

34:11.000 --> 34:23.000
Is that I think what they did was they tricked us into believing that if you can't see because your head is in the way, I guess.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm in the way.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
I have to do this. I'm just going to I'm just going to move it a little bit.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, I felt you.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
No, no, don't please don't do that. I want you to stay there. It doesn't matter. We'll just leave it like this for now because this doesn't really matter.

34:39.000 --> 34:52.000
The point of the point that I want to make with this slide is that I think that they have taken a long time to elaborate on the idea that gain a function research is real, and that even bat cave viruses are capable of causing a pandemic.

34:52.000 --> 35:09.000
But even more important, they've spent about 20 years convincing us that if you passage viruses in a cell culture using a particular selection method, or you passage them through animals and select for the really sick ones, you can make it make a pandemic virus on the other side.

35:10.000 --> 35:30.000
Then more recently, they've spent the last three years trying to convince us that a darn it that a virus can also be stitched together so that if you put the right combinations, you just described it like five minutes ago if I put the right combinations of things together that I might create something that could pandemic.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
I believe that all of this is mythology.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
And the reason why I think it's mythology is because there's real good evidence for it in the literature.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
And the foundation of it is the cartoon of how viruses really work.

35:44.000 --> 35:56.000
What they tell you is that you get a virus and it goes into your lungs and it makes perfect copies of itself, or let's say nearly perfect copies, and then you cough those on other people and very slowly over thousands of infections.

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
It changes, but virologists have always known that's not true.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
And the reason why is because darn it.

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
I'm going to try and move you over here is because if you see this, I'm getting you out of the way here that you've never been able to culture them.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
That rhymes.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
So culture.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
They never been able to culture.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Well, they are able to every once in a while.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
You know that every once in a while they get them to grow for like five passages long enough for them to sequence and then reassemble a genome.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
But they can't, I can't send you a virus and you can grow more.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
It's not like a breeding pair of mice.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
I can make knock out mice and send them to you.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
You can make as many as you want.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
That's interesting.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I knew it was difficult, but I didn't know.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
I didn't know that it was never.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Never.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
They cannot.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
You can't buy a cultureable freeze-dried virus or whatever you can't.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
And then the reproducibly.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Here's the trick.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
You can't even believe it.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
It's in every paper since 1981 when David Baltimore and Vincent Ranson Yellow first did it with polio.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
RNA doesn't copy itself perfectly.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
It makes really crappy copies of itself.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
That's why it's almost impossible to culture.

37:09.000 --> 37:22.000
And in fact, if you go back to the virology of the eighties and nineties, you will find them reminiscing about how difficult it is because so many of the particles are replication incompetent.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
So here's their trick.

37:25.000 --> 37:34.000
They have decided and they figured this out in the eighties that they could just convert a consensus RNA genome to a DNA copy.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And they can make many, many, many perfect copies of that in bacteria.

37:38.000 --> 37:48.000
And then they can transfect that back into a cell culture that will produce exosomes with the RNA that they want to make an animal sick with or to send to their friends.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
And it's replicable because the DNA is always it's always high fidelity.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 38:05.000
And so the trick that I think is revealed here, this is just a few of papers from these are just papers from one year, all infectious clones of all different viruses.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
That's from 2010.

38:06.000 --> 38:16.000
So what they've done is if you think about an RNA virus as a mix tape, like you used to be able to make lots of different songs on the same cassette tape.

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
And then they would all come from the same different albums and they would be of a certain fidelity, but you couldn't make copies of the copy because it would get crappier and crappier.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
That's what happens with, as you're talking about respiratory disease, never can sustain for thousands and thousands of cases.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
It only really does for a few hundred if you're lucky.

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
And that's because respiratory viruses can't copy themselves at high fidelity like is portrayed on television.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
So I've been trying to teach people with the idea of comparing it to a cassette tape versus a CD.

38:50.000 --> 38:59.000
But the point is if you can make CD copies of something that is not normally high fidelity copying and then you made enough copies of it.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
That might be a real easy way to distribute a molecular signal around the world to make it look like something was spreading extremely fast.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Okay.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, that's possible.

39:10.000 --> 39:24.000
So you're saying, I think where this is a laboratory technique or trick they've learnt to get rounds are really serious, you know, a timely difficult problem of low fidelity replication of RNA.

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
And think about what you just said a minute ago about run by me a scenario where we have more control.

39:30.000 --> 39:40.000
If you release a high purity clone that can't replicate itself at high purity, then it would decay exponentially and only really be a problem wherever you released it.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
Yeah, that's true. We'd still have to.

39:44.000 --> 39:54.000
Yeah, so yes, it addresses one of the three objections to there being a novel virus, the other two being the epidemiology doesn't.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Are you familiar with Dennis Rancourt?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Absolutely.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I've interviewed him twice already.

39:59.000 --> 40:20.000
Sure, no, he is good. He's a very open minded, but also, he's very, he says, I need a, I need a good explanation for why it is that something that you could inhale and would make you ill would not kill the most vulnerable people who tend to be the oldest and already sick.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
And that's not, that's not the pattern of all cause mortality that we see.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
So they were very sharp.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
They were very sharp spikes in a lot of places.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Really.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
But what they weren't doing was killing the.

40:36.000 --> 40:46.000
85, 95 year olds over the 65 year olds. In fact, if I remember it correctly, I think Dennis Dennis team found that the peak.

40:46.000 --> 40:54.000
Age bands that saw the biggest increase in all cause mortality was I think the 65 to 70.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
So only a little bit older than me. And I, I don't feel like I'm likely to die by catch one of these things.

41:00.000 --> 41:06.000
It's normally the people who are so close to death or almost any challenge that made them quite ill.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
They've got very little.

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
Formerly reserve cardiovascular reserve, you know, pancreas reserve and so on.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
It doesn't take much.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It's like a machine that's nearly failing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It just doesn't take much.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
If you've got a week ignition system and a low compression on two cylinders and one of your two carburette is leaking.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
It only takes a small plug in a bypass.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
In one in the remaining car rest and the dampening will just stop.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
Whereas it would have just been an annoyance on a brand new vehicle.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Just think, why is it running rough?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
It will keep going.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
So that's why, and I think that's why fundamentally.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Regardless of the challenge, if it is something that makes you here acutely.

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
The people who died, since we're the ones who already most vulnerable to an early death, but is by virtue of age and.

41:53.000 --> 42:01.000
You hit on another good idea earlier to where you said that it's not so much what you're infected with, but it's your own personal response to it.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
A lot of these respiratory diseases present very similarly across these co morbid people.

42:07.000 --> 42:14.000
So the next thing I would like to share with you just to kind of follow up with this.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
I wonder, are you familiar with nanopore sequencing at all?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
No.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
So usually when they do Sanger sequencing or anything using PCR, they are limited by the range of amplicon size.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
And so they have to make lots of different pieces and then reassemble the whole puzzle.

42:29.000 --> 42:40.000
And then nanopore sequencing is cool because they use a protein ion channel and they can let really, really, really long strings of DNA go through it.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
In fact, two million base pairs can go through and they can get a read from it.

42:45.000 --> 42:54.000
So this is a paper that was done in 2019 right before the pandemic, where they used an infectious clone of human coronavirus 229E.

42:54.000 --> 43:03.000
They transfected some, I believe it's H U H seven cells and then they took the super name, supernatant off.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
And they looked at what kind of RNA was produced by the cell culture.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
And you'll find this really curious because you would think that in doing this, right, they would find.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
You know that there are sub genomic RNAs that they can find.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
And so there's all these different genomic, different sizes of RNAs that they predict will be there from previous experiments.

43:21.000 --> 43:28.000
But the point is, is that when they looked at in the infectious cycle, which you just said you were suspicious of, and I am too,

43:28.000 --> 43:36.000
that, that when they look for whole genomes, you would think if they did this with a clone in a, in a culture dish,

43:36.000 --> 43:46.000
there would be hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of thousands of full genomes that they could look at and look at the variation in and see why this is cool.

43:46.000 --> 43:56.000
Right. Well, guess I would think so. Yes, if there was anything, you know, if the model would have, as you say, replication, then it would surely need to be complete.

43:56.000 --> 44:08.000
Right. So which, this is really cool because you know what they found? They found the largest genome they found are the largest sea, full sequence they found was 26,000 base pairs, which is pretty close to full size.

44:08.000 --> 44:19.000
But listen to this. And it's really funny. They found 400,000 copies of the end protein. They have found more than 100,000 copies of SM and N.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
And they found only two copies of the full genome. Wow.

44:23.000 --> 44:38.000
Okay. So you can imagine a scenario where if you were shedding N protein exosomes, S and M protein exosomes, you might make your fellow family members show signs and symptoms that were milder than yours.

44:38.000 --> 44:46.000
That's not a sign of, that's not a sign of infectiousness and a clone would be really good at doing this is what they did. This is from a clone.

44:46.000 --> 44:55.000
This should have been the purest copies of the genome that they could make in a laboratory. They only got two reads.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
And they've done this with coronavirus three times since the start of the pandemic and the most full reads they ever got was 111.

45:04.000 --> 45:16.000
So that shows you that the infectious cycle is essentially something that they've, I think, that they've misled us about. They must have misled. Wait. Oh yeah. Sorry. The zoom ended. I'm going to go to the next one.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
Going right away. Here we go. I'm already in. Check it out.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
Okay. Join Bing. Don't worry. We're getting them right back. We're almost there.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
Don't worry. Here we come. Is this going okay? Are we doing all right? Are we doing all right? I think we're doing all right.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
We got him. I think we got him. All right. Good, good, good, good, good. Thank you guys for being here. This is so exciting.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
My coffee's still warm.

45:49.000 --> 46:02.000
I'm not sponsored by Yeti. I just happened to have a lot of these because my brother was crazy about them and he gave me all the garbage. And this one I actually found on the street in Pittsburgh while I was on my bike. And I had to buy a lid for it.

46:03.000 --> 46:20.000
Come on guys. Come on back. You can do it. Whoa. Oh man. We got him. We got him on the clones. We got him on the clones, which means all I got to do is just show him how it all ties together with the PCR and then he'll get it.

46:20.000 --> 46:49.000
He'll get it. He'll get why we can bring all the molecular biologists on side, all the people that think the testing works on side, bring a lot of health care workers on side, bring people who are confused on side. Nobody has to be right. Oh my gosh. Come on dude. Link too. I'm on link too. I gotta be. This is gotta be right. He's just slower than me. It looked like his wife and his wife and his wife.

46:50.000 --> 47:14.000
His wife was helping him with the IT. So he might not be. Come on. I'm getting pumped. This is sweet. We are doing it. And we're doing it because of you all because you guys shared because you guys stayed because you guys didn't buy the BS. It's awesome. It's awesome.

47:15.000 --> 47:38.000
Come on, dudes. All right. All right. All right. We're back. Look at that. How quick is that? You guys are fancy. It's like you guys used you before or something back again. Nice. Yeah. So they didn't find any copies and not the copies that you would expect if they're model of the infectious cycle means anything real.

47:39.000 --> 47:54.000
So I'm wondering whether the sequences that code isolated proteins, are they? Why would they make you ill? And if so, what would be the mechanism for that?

47:54.000 --> 48:03.000
They might just irritate or something. I mean, I'm thinking only of just mild respiratory annoyance. I'm not thinking about necessarily a response.

48:04.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah, it would also make sense because one of the first proteins that that cohabitant people that don't show symptoms, one of the first proteins they build immunity to is the end.

48:14.000 --> 48:28.000
And a lot of these. I mean, I even have a paper from the 80s where they have the gel and the gel even has just a tiny shadow where the full genome should be in the giant over expressed piles of garbage way down the gel for these small things.

48:29.000 --> 48:40.000
Very interesting. I think it's a major. I think it's a major insight into into why virology can be so easily hacked apart in terms of isolation, purification.

48:40.000 --> 48:54.000
It means that a lot of people have solid grounded stand on, including people who say there isn't SARS-CoV-2. It's really impressive if you if you think about the fact that they cultured this virus only in three places.

48:55.000 --> 49:13.000
I think Italy, Washington State and Wuhan. And so in theory, you would have only had to make had to make the clone competent in those three places long enough to put the sequence up and then provided there was a background of coronaviruses that the PCR could over overlap on.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
It's game over.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
So, can I ask something, Jay? Yeah, sure.

49:20.000 --> 49:34.000
So, so at this stage, what we what what the model the theory is is indicating is that we are put it. So looking at it from a clone release then but from potentially multiple sources.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Multiple points. I don't know.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Multiple points could have been the same source. Yeah.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah, same source, but multiple points globally.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
To try to understand the epidemiology we saw initially.

49:47.000 --> 49:58.000
Yeah, I think that's the only way you can you can get a molecular signal that was so high fidelity. I mean, otherwise, there would have been much more variation early on. And if you look at the first SARS, there was variation between patients.

49:58.000 --> 50:08.000
You didn't you didn't need to follow an immunocompromised patient. It was patient after patient had a different sequence. And that didn't happen this time. So that was also weird.

50:08.000 --> 50:18.000
There was also a military control over that sequencing. I'm sure you're aware that DARPA and DITRA are the ones that run that that's not an open source database that scientists are contributing to.

50:18.000 --> 50:35.000
Yes. I mean, I'm I'm I'm quite a fan of minimalism and I'm not sure from the I'm not sure from the epidemiology that that we even need to posit the presence of a of a new material of any kind.

50:36.000 --> 50:50.000
Well, I may be wrong, but I'm not convinced there's any evidence that that we have more people sick than normal. And the reason we have more deaths is they were murdered in hospitals and care homes.

50:50.000 --> 51:04.000
That that for sure. That for sure is absolutely true, but that's definitely true. But imagine I'm for me, Michael. I'm just trying to think that that there are a handful of doctors in these places who saw something that didn't last very long,

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
but was pretty consistent for the week that it did. And those people I want to offer an explanation to.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
No, I can't. I mean, I can't count. I can't count it because I wasn't there.

51:17.000 --> 51:33.000
But it is a medical friend of mine said, if you think, if you think, you know, if you're expecting something, then you may interpret what you see in a way that you would have done if you'd not been primed to expect something.

51:33.000 --> 51:44.000
You know, that's, and certainly, I mean, I know lots of people who, who say, I'm really certain that COVID exists because I had it. And I said, look, it's really interesting. How do you know you had it?

51:44.000 --> 51:51.000
And they said, well, I had a positive test. I said, OK, what else? Oh, well, I had symptoms I've never had before.

51:51.000 --> 52:00.000
And I said, how old are you? They've said 60. I said, see, you know, how many times have you had an acute respiratory infection, they think for a moment and they can't remember.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
And it's like maybe 20, 40. I don't know. I don't get told very often anymore.

52:06.000 --> 52:19.000
But so if I get one a year, and there are multiple causes, it's not unlikely, probabilistically, that some people will have their worst, their worst events ever.

52:20.000 --> 52:28.000
But that doesn't mean that's not evidence that is a new pathogen. And people say, it is. And I say, no, it isn't.

52:28.000 --> 52:35.000
I'm not saying it is. And I'm just saying, I don't read the information as we're requiring it.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
Jay, can I ask something? Of course you can. Initially, right? And the doctor, you know, I'm going to ask him here.

52:42.000 --> 52:54.000
That schematic you were putting up where you were showing the infection initially in the lung and the fact that most of the virus is probably broken and improper.

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
That initial, I think that's important for us to go to the listener again. But doctor, what you are seeing is what I've been arguing.

53:02.000 --> 53:13.000
And even Jenny had a discussion is that if you look at the observed and you expected deaths, what we're doing is those two lines would have stayed on top of each other mostly all the time.

53:13.000 --> 53:23.000
Had it not been what you're saying, either the delay treatment, when corporate bears and how we sedated people with my dazzle hours.

53:23.000 --> 53:34.000
And you're right on both fronts. Yes, because people are genuinely ill. I'm not denying people were ill or died. That would be observed. They were ill. Some people were ill and some of those died.

53:34.000 --> 53:42.000
And all the people who were ill, some could have had their life saved. I mean, that's not for me. I'm a PhD in automatic.

53:42.000 --> 53:51.000
But if you gave over time a hundred such patients to a physician, some would be saved by appropriate intervention.

53:51.000 --> 54:00.000
So that's definitely true. Some people died who didn't need to. And a lot of people, I think, were killed directly by ventilation, remdesivir.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Yes.

54:01.000 --> 54:11.000
My dazzle morphine, things like that. So, in both ways, there were deaths that could have been avoided and deaths that were manufactured in people who definitely wouldn't have died.

54:11.000 --> 54:22.000
And there'll be some who would have died, whatever they did. It's a combination. What I've not found it necessary to hypothesize a novel virus.

54:22.000 --> 54:30.000
And I've asked myself, why is it that we're even having the conversation? It's because, well, we were told it was one. Yeah, we were told it was one.

54:30.000 --> 54:41.000
There were a few publications, but I've been informed by people who understand virology in a way I don't, that the methods themselves are imperfect.

54:41.000 --> 54:55.000
We say that they would be surprising to someone who's payment is fresh from from the scientific method in other fields, you know, absence of certain controls, for example, apparently is is is absolutely characteristic.

54:55.000 --> 55:05.000
You know, you give them good excuses for why it's done that way, but it's still an absence of a control. They can't really draw conclusions that people stay.

55:05.000 --> 55:15.000
And, you know, but that really, that really Michael, that really stems from the fact that they don't behave as the cartoon of a virus.

55:15.000 --> 55:28.000
Very to almost impossible to culture. They really are only genetic signatures that are found in the wild and the only way that they can make them tractable in the laboratories to make a CD and a copy of them.

55:28.000 --> 55:43.000
Amazing. And so it's really ubiquitous. This is the only way that they've ever been reliably and repeatedly studied and everything else is it taking a genetic signature from the wild and claiming that it is representative of something that exists.

55:43.000 --> 55:52.000
But it's very interesting what you just said, because I haven't thought it all the way through, but the end game always has been control and injection.

55:52.000 --> 56:02.000
Yeah, and injection, and they've used fear and incentives, both both punishments and as it were rewards for doing what they want.

56:02.000 --> 56:19.000
But the injection consisted of some materials that are, they bear surprising, still allerically with some of the stuff you've just been describing that, you know, that there's an encapsulated incomplete sequence capable of being expressed, but not

56:19.000 --> 56:37.000
doing, not capable of in going on to infect in versus another person. But nevertheless, there'll be a number of copies of this lipid nanopascal encapsulated RNA encoding, I think, for them, spike protein, whatever that is.

56:38.000 --> 56:54.000
And when you do that, again, as a biologist and immunologist, when I look at it, I think what that will do is it could harm you through over expression of a of a biologically active protein or spike protein.

56:55.000 --> 57:09.000
That homologous proteins from other, you know, biological settings were able to hurt mammals and injure human cells and feature and so on. So there's no excuse for not for not being well aware of that.

57:09.000 --> 57:30.000
And in terms of formulation that the lipid nanoparticles didn't take you long to fall across papers that from the formulation folks, people who do pharmacy what's called pharmaceutical R&D and formulation of active drugs to make a medicine that lipid nanoparticles tend to distribute very

57:30.000 --> 57:42.000
unevenly to all this or a bit in particular to over itself or certainly mac rats and mice and so on. And then what was the third concern? Yes, that is that if you

57:43.000 --> 57:58.000
this is an immunological concern, I remember this occurred to me very early and I must have felt sensitive because if you express it in your body a protein that is non-self, your immune system is so clever, it will recognize that as non-self.

57:58.000 --> 58:13.000
It will recognize it, which is a miracle of recombination of your T cell receptors and film, but that it will know that it's non-self because of the absence of certain co-stimulatory signals and it will then your immune system will then attack.

58:14.000 --> 58:26.000
The cell is bearing that non-self flag. And I remember thinking, well, if you inject people with this stuff, when they end up with, you know, auto attack or some immune attack, I remember thinking, well, it must have resolved that, right?

58:26.000 --> 58:36.000
Because you can't go along and inject millions of people up, but this is, you know, and I do think that's a contribution to the adverse events.

58:37.000 --> 58:47.000
So it doesn't, you don't even need spike proteins into people. Any non-self protein is expressed sufficiently high copy number that your immune system is under.

58:47.000 --> 58:56.000
No, no, no doubt that it will, it will interpret it as infection or potential cancer attack.

58:57.000 --> 59:15.000
So, and then you may listen, I should know that certainly my government in the UK, and I think American too, lots of other places have announced because the pharma companies wanted to announce it because it's price sensitive information that they can arrive.

59:15.000 --> 59:31.000
Governments had arrived at business terms with the drug companies to acquire a number of injections of new so-called mRNA vaccines that will allow them to inject each citizen 10 times, each citizen 10 times.

59:32.000 --> 59:47.000
So then if you, if you inject each person, you know, every three months packs with the sequence that will induce some degree of autoimmunity, my guesses are not very good gambler is that you wouldn't not many people would survive that.

59:48.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And I can't see if a nine reason I keep, I've said this for three years, there isn't a benign reason for injecting you with an mRNA encoding a non-self protein, and especially grab it in lipid nanoparticles, which they do.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So when I heard that, I thought that, that I think that's going to be, that's the depopulation to what else is it for.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's not, it's not, it's not for producing immunity because it doesn't do it.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I would just like to give you a little anecdote there just to put us in the same place.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I don't want to be the guy who's talking, but so when I spoke up at the University of Pittsburgh in 2020,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I was a guy who worked only on mice, and my thing was to use optogenetics to change the way that neurons fire with light.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So you have to express these proteins in particular neurons, and then you make slices of the brain and you use a laser in a, in a, in a, in a, under a microscope.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So it's all in vitro stuff.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But it's tissue selective, either tissue selective deposition or expression.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah, it is. We're driving, we were using a dendovirus that had particular promoters that were specific for particular neurons.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And so you could really isolate and, and dissect a circuit.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But what was interesting about it is, is that I came to the University of Pittsburgh as an expert on doing that.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And, and the monkey people at the University of Pittsburgh wanted to use optogenetics in their monkeys.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And I had done, I had done healing slices in, in, in the Netherlands before from patients that had glioma removed.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And so I had expertise in cutting bigger pieces of tissue and, and they thought that I could do this.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And I told them that you have to do it in a monkey that you want to get rid of.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And they're like, why? And I said, well, because you can't put these things in their brain and then let it go for another.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Because it'll just be a lesion. Like the immune, the reason why it works in my mice is because I wait four weeks, the optimal expression.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And then I kill the mouse, take the tissue and use it. But I don't, I don't put it in there and then let the mouse live for two years because the, the brain would just get attacked by the immune system.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And they didn't believe me.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So we sacrificed the monkey 18 weeks after the experiment and the entire place that we had put the tissue was a lesion.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And they were mad at me because they said, I didn't prepare the tissue slices correctly.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And Michael, if I hadn't cut extra tissue, I wouldn't have been able to say, look, I went past the anatomical ejection site and it's fine now.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's a lesion. I told you this.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
No, good. And that's why, but that's why I spoke out.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah, that's why I spoke out, though, because these are exactly what they were planning on doing.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The J&J is a identify respect scene. I couldn't believe it. I was like, you use this every day.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
How can you not understand this is not fit for purpose?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Quite. No, absolutely. Yeah, I think I'm often depressed at how my colleagues who are regarded as pretty clever people.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I'm sure they are, but we all know so little and we think we know a lot, but the vulnerabilities don't know very much.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:25.000
So I know personally, for some varying degree, three of the executive vice presidents or senior vice presidents running the vaccine programs in three of the four main companies.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And I thought, they're either, they're either, they either don't understand what they're doing and they're not as clever as I remember them.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Or they do know what they're doing, and they're not the good people that I thought they were.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So I thought, I don't like either of these options. I don't think I've missed just something.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But basically, I took to accusing them on the record of crimes against humanity.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You either don't know what you're doing, in which case you should get them out of your deal.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Or you didn't know what you're doing, in which case, you know, you should turn yourself in in Egypt where your conscience gets you.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
One of them resigned, whether that was the reason, but they did.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
But nobody contacted me nor their lawyers. So that seemed quite surprising to me.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I thought I would receive a writ or something.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Because it's a pretty big claim to make against a named individual.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Absolutely.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But I did it anyway, because I've been wrong in lots of ways.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.000
But what I'm not wrong about is that this whole thing is a malign, you know, cutie-tat of the world. That's what it is.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That's not, that's, there's no possible, you know, whatever.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
A group of very clever people who've worked for a long time for their own reasons have taken over.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And I keep looking into the camera and saying, if you, if you're listening, thank you for listening,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I'm going to lay on you, the audience, some of the responsibility that you have to persuade your network that we are under the most extraordinary chance ever.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And the reason is that they're not listening to me, your network's not on this coin you are.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
They're not, they're not looking for me or, or 100 other people like me trying to, trying to warn you.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
But you are, and you're in touch with those people.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But the main media is not going to tell them the truth either. So if you don't do it, we will lose.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It's simple as that, believe it. The crime is it goes the other way.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:40.000
If the listeners do persuade, you do your best persuade everyone in your network, you know, friends, neighbors, relatives, workmates, whatever.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You'll probably get shouted out, you know, I know all about that. I've been going for three years, bro, don't know.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So if you can, if you can wake some of them up, we will win.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I just, we can't lose if enough people know that we're under attack as well.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We will detect the moves they make as a line instead of thinking, Oh, well, yeah.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So, for example, I mentioned earlier, Britain's introducing digital ID for people filing their own taxes.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I've seen that in other countries, different reasons.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I saw today announcement that several more countries are filing central bank digital currencies.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know, those, those together, they're so, if you're not looking for them and realizing how they can be misused, you will not see them as threatening.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's why these people should know they are threatening.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000
But then you'll take care of yourself, use cash, for example, staying known to digital ID as long as you can, like indefinitely.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You know, that's because we basically, if we don't walk into the cage ourselves, we can stay free.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But I'm worried that so few people know that something bad is happening.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000
That a lot of people will, will be cajoled into going along with something because they'll think, well, how big is he lazy?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
If I have a digital ID, well, I've got a passport.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's convenient. It's so convenient, Mike.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, so convenient. It's so convenient.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You're right.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
My wife often says, she says, you know, joking aside, they're right.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It's convenient. It's all small, but they can be misused.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Yeah, that's the problem. So.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
But Jay, go ahead.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
So, you know, I know we're going to have the opportunity to have multiple discussions because a lot of this is very important because I find like the U.S.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
and the Congress are having hearings that are like going around in circles.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's like a game.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
We are having discussions yet for society and the world.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So let me ask you a question because we have Mike Eden here.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Yes, please.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Let's try and say if you, if we want to train and we have five minutes, we have to explain to Mike what you're called the court thesis here based on this research.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And how in terms of the court thesis is regarding a clone release principally with.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And the idea of how this plays with early treatment, meaning that we support early treatment.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
We, this is, we have been part of the early treatment model.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And it is a very critical part, but, but how, how, what are we trying to say in terms of most of the severity on the initial release of clone, etc.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Can you just explain that in, in a simple to sort of my 50,000 understand.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And I think, I think I can. So the, the main thing that I, that I think will help you understand why I'm a little bit enticed by this idea is because there are doctors that think that these early treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin worked for a while and then their effectiveness decayed.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And I don't, I don't know. So for example, would you, would you.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I would at least say that are the idea that you're putting forth, which there was, it was a complete 100% drill with little or no novel virus because they just changed protocols and people got very sick and I totally agree with that.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What I'm trying to do is make a few more people right, the molecular biologists right, maybe some of the people that work on PCR can be right because PCR with nested primers works pretty well.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So what, what other alternatives are there and the best one is this background from which the, from which the real virus could never be drawn in the first place.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But the other one is this clusters of severe cases. So I'm thinking that somewhere in here, there is an actually admission.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I just want to just play a one minute video of somebody who gave a presentation in 2017 because I think what he says is really important.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:21.000
What he's describing is how to use a pathogen to create a rift between the citizens and their government. And it's really insightful because, again, it's from 2017 and now imagine you use a clone, which only a few people get sick from,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
a few people need to be cultured from and a few people need to be sequenced from in order to start the theater.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And that's what I think is required because you couldn't not start the theater. That's what I'm all I'm guessing.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What I want is high morbidity. Can you hear that?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I want people to complain.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
So what do I do? I go to Des Moines. Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines. I go to Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I go to North Carolina. I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000
These individuals complain. Again, this is a central nervous system condition. So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet. I take attribution for that. Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:40.000
These people are really sick with this. But then I say others who are also infected will show subdromal, pre-dromal signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Sleeplessness. Or just asymptomatic transmission and PCR positivity, right? That would also be enough to drive the hysteria. So listen, he keeps going on.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Agitation. What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've got every individual who's worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The CDC comes back and says they could even set up drive-through so that's real convenient for them to do the testing and to fall into this hysteria, right?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That's what they did all around the United States. That's not real. I come back and say, that's fake news.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And of course, I'll be able to then incur a ripple effect. And if you want to see what this looks like.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And so then he describes to go on to describe how for a while after the 9-11 attacks and the anthrax things that there was all kinds of white powder scares all over the United States where sugar would get spilled and then people would call the police.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Right.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Some of them are changing in accidents where people thought it was a terrorist attack.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And it's possible some of them were bad acts of dropping powders to frightened people, even though they weren't anthrax.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And so I can see how that would go.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Yes, if people are, you know, we see this with, I don't know if there's an incident with an aeroplane, a certain kind of aeroplane that was a difficulty with one of the engines.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:31.000
You know, then you hear three or four cases over the next fortnight and you say, Oh, my word, those engines must be unreliable, but there's over reporting things that really weren't even problems that they just sounded similar.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And they were salient. So they got reported.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah, that happens all the time. And that's why misattribution and confirmation bias is it's a real problem. It doesn't matter how clever you are.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:53.000
You're, you're just like for example, it's just that's what humans alike. You warned about a world. And then anything that looks vaguely of all time.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You know, you, you're overreacting. Oh, it's just a cat magnified or whatever it is.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Exactly. But yeah, or a funny smell in the kitchen has there been a wolf in here. It's like, no, it's, you know, you've left your pet food to go off. You know, people will.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:19.000
People put things together in the most peculiar way. They're not always wrong, by the way. Yeah, but especially, especially if they're coerced like they were, though, and they were coerced.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And that's a good point about, as you say, the people who are prone to be very frightened of illness. And that's not always, it doesn't always track with, with the rationality.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You know, I've met young healthy people who are very frightened of this virus. And I've met older people who say, come and give me a half.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Yeah, I've got to 80. I'm probably not going to die this long. Right. So, yeah, if you had, and they had to write me wrong.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You didn't sense it. I remember, I remember thinking how remarkable it was that if people are so ill and so worried that they might have it, but they might have to drive for an hour to go to, you know, to go to Australia.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And yet people did turn up in their hundreds. Absolutely. Yeah, that is probably a, that's definitely a selection of some kind.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah, interesting. So, you know, it is, it is possible. And I always say that I don't have a copy of the script. Right. So I don't really know what's going on me.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So the thing that really gets me excited is the possibility that the no virus idea was seeded because it's inherently wrong. Yeah. And so, if this really is as elaborate of an op as we think it is, there's, there's people around everywhere.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:47.000
So we got to make sure that we realize that I've been trying very hard to understand what is possible biologically and what is it. And I think they've lied to us about so much.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:02.000
A wonderful anecdotal story. I don't want to keep you longer than you need to. I found a video where Robert Malone is talking about how when he was a PhD student, he was thinking that within 10 years, there would be a geneticist at every hospital using retroviruses to kill childhood

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:13.000
to cure childhood diseases. And of course, he was way wrong. We're nowhere near that. We're not even close to that. We haven't even hardly made any progress. It's extraordinary.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Yeah, it's funny. All of my professional life, I would, people would come up with really interesting ideas. And I was often fairly sure they wouldn't work. I mean, it's not, it's not a fun job.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I said, I'm an enthusiastic skeptic. I really want breakthrough ideas, right? Yeah, yeah.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:41.000
But on the other hand, if we can kick it in the head for five minutes, we've got to be our own best critics because you go up in front of management review, they'll kick you in there.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Yes.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You know, and often you can, but that's the thing. If you, if you find the weakness and then see the sometimes still the essence of an interesting idea there.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And that's what I think that that's the last I think if we go to the hundred thousand foot level, I wanted to piggyback on your idea before we let you go if that's the plan.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Imagine the AI of go or chess and how they fed it. They had defeated games, many, many, many, many games.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000
If they want an AI to figure out how the human genome works, they need to feed it many genomes with many, many lifetimes of data.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And so they need to get our children, not you and me. They need to get our children under the impression that sharing their genetic data and their medical data is something that they're doing for the greater good so that the AI can get us into this trans human future.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
That's what I think they're doing to those, those college.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I mean, I think they're probably doing a variety of things. So, again, I remember the finance lady Catherine Austin fits. She said, I've been around people who think this way long enough that whenever you think you've worked it out, you think it's one thing.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:06.000
She said, it's always three, four, five things, always. And she said, partly it's because there are opportunists that say, what else can we do when we make this move? What else can we accomplish?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And in addition, there are, it isn't a monolithic group and the perpetrators isn't necessarily a single group. It isn't, there isn't one person stroking a white cat and hollowed out volcano. I don't think so.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But there are stakeholders that basically are in charge of the money and they have the power and they intend to maintain that.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And they probably trade off with each other the way you do in business.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Absolutely.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:46.000
One way to make your idea flies to say, you know, I want to accomplish A and B, but to get stallion George on the side, I've introduced C and D, which will also be accomplished.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And, you know, why not?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
They're complete nutcases and they're not normal. That's for sure.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But we are, we are the, we are the organisms upon which they've been experimenting.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Well, Jay, let me just say something quick. You know, I, I, I like you in a sense of, I'm like you.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You know, you want, we want people to entertain other ideas and to peer behind the curtain, so to speak, look below the rock, because we didn't have all of the answers and we've been trying to make sense for this last three years.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:26.000
As we push back on a lot of the wrongs and the debts that came from the lockdowns and now this vaccine and then how we were treated in any hospitals.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:40.000
But how do you think then, because we are all proponents of early, even you have spoken highly of it. How do you think this theory fits or drives the treatment model in the sense of where does it optimally fit.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Because I can see the role and the continual role for repurposed off label therapeutics properly well prescribed and handled it for serious illness, et cetera.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
But where do you see it fitting.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Can we cue him in? I mean, Michael, I think I remember you mentioning or somebody mentioning that you mentioned that we have to reevaluate what other drugs were given in compliments so that we know whether hydroxychlorine,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
whether hydroxychloroquine did something or that.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yeah, that's right. And also that we've talked a bit about a variety of respiratory illnesses that they present, and they're classified. I didn't know this until the pandemic, but they're classified as influenza like illnesses.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:46.000
They're not really called flu. They're called live. And it's because they're influenza like they're not the person giving that patient that diagnosis is not saying you're real because you have an influenza virus replicate in your area you might have.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:58.000
All we can say is that your breathlessness, your temperature, you know, whatever, this near all of these things, cough, are reminiscent of influenza.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And so that's what we'll call it, but it could be 20 diseases.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And some people might benefit, as Paul says, if we have, as it were, the road effects of carefully selected medicines, you know, we've made me that we've never really bothered to take care of of patients because there's the old joke, isn't that?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:25.000
If you go home, you'll get better in two weeks, but if you take this treatment, you'll be better in 14 days.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And it's quite hard. It's very difficult for family practitioners because someone turns up and they've got a cough and they say, it's got worse in the last few days.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And I feel feverish and they think, well, this poor person might have incipient bacterial pneumonia.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You better send them home and it's Friday. You know, send them out. You'll be dead on Sunday.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So, as a precautionary principle, they'll give them whatever whatever is appropriate.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And so you end up with a huge amount of prescriptions of antibiotics for acute acute test infections or acute upper airway infections where it's not necessary.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But I think what we've learned through the pandemic is that they weren't all wrong.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You know, a lot of people said, oh, you shouldn't prescribe antibiotics in this setting.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But according to Dennis Reinhoep's data, the peak in depth occurred in the people in whom normally large numbers of prescriptions for chest infection would be given.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And they reduced by between a quarter and a half. And these people were dying.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
So genuinely we were getting better.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And we probably don't know that's the difficulty is that they don't know who to give it to.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And so some doctors will err on the side of therapeutic caution and prescribe widely in other people.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And maybe some of the lattice patients end up in emergency room at the weekend.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I don't know. It's not easy. There isn't a right answer.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
That's why good doctors are worth their weight and gold. You know, the ones that.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Puts and snare to feel the patients and think very hard.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Unfortunately, there aren't that many of them anymore.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
They're mostly prescribed according to a pleasure.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Right. Yes. I think it's a really, I think it's just, I don't know what to say other than thank you. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I just feel like.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I don't want to overstay my welcome and instead just say that you ever have time to talk again.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I think we should continue the conversation because I think you like me and other people went full circle from, from being pretty sure that this was nothing to doubting ourselves for a while then going back again.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
That's how effective the whole campaign was.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And I know for sure that I've learned more about immunology in the last three years that I ever intended to learn.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And I still very much am convinced that this is a very elaborate theater that we've been put through.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And so I feel like hammering away at the biology was the way that I brought myself to the light.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And like I said, you were one of the only people holding a lantern up that gave me the courage to do it.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I mean, I literally mean you and Wolfgang Woda for the two guys.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Thank you. Yeah.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:26.000
No, I always say to people that I'm not, I'm not doing anything different than I used to when I was being paid to do it, which is to try and make a synthesis of all of the information and try and work out what the decades is going on.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And what should I do to try and make it better?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
That's what the drug discovery is like this.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It kept normally there isn't there isn't a self-appointed lease trying to murder you.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's it.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It didn't normally happen in my company anyway.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:47.000
But so basically I say I'm doing what I used to do in under extraordinary circumstances.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:00.000
But part of the reason I spoke out and continue to speak out is I say to people, if you're frightened of the embarrassment and consequences of speaking out, think of the consequences if you don't speak out and I am right.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So it's not the risk of not the medical.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I know some people who think, well, I heard you might, but I'm going to carry on believing in government.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I just point this out.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
If you believe the government and I'm right, you'll lose your freedom and probably your life.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
If you've followed me and others like me and I'm wrong, the worst that happens is you'll get laughed at.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So it's not symmetrical, is it?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
It's just based on probabilistic outcome.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
You should pay attention to the outliers like us.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Because as I say, if there is the plot and you allow it to continue, you're going to come across.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You're going to lose your freedom.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Whereas these crazies, that's what I'm now classified as, even though I had an entirely normal and boring life.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
That's 20.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
You know, I'm not making this stuff up.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
It's that nothing we've been told, as you said, we've been lied to about almost everything and it didn't just start in 2020, unfortunately.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And what's happening now is people must know it was in stage, for example, to rush a new technology pharmaceutical product, you know, a genetic vaccine at people.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And then inject, I think they've injected 6 billion people on the planet.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I mean, that makes me shiver.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yeah, 13, 13 billion doses, they brag.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Exactly.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So, yeah, you're right.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So there's enough for everybody to about two roughly.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
But I think six out of the 8 billion people have rolled out their sleeve.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You're about to get cut off.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So I'm just going to say bye.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
It goes away.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Thank you so much.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Thanks, Paul, for setting this up.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I hope we talk again soon and I'll talk to you later this afternoon, Paul.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Thank you, everybody.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Thank you.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Work hard.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Stay up, Ryan.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Thanks a lot.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Stay upright. Thank you.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Wow. Wow.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Are you kidding me?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Yes.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
We just had a stream with Michael Eden and I'm a little freaking out.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I'm sorry.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I'm not having a real good reaction to it, but it's something that had to happen for so freaking long.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And I'm so happy that it happened.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And now I'm going to go spend the rest of the day with my kids and play some basketball.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And maybe even drink a beer after my wife gets home.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Oh, man.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I really needed that.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Oh, I really, really needed that.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
That was really good.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I'm just, I need to process that and then I'm going to edit it and put it up elsewhere.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Thank you very much to Paul Elias Alexander for giving me a 15 minute phone call that led to this.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Thank you very much to Michael Eden for taking the time to talk to me and sharing his ideas with us.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And thank you to everybody that supports my stream, including Greg and Rodney and Eddie and Canada and Jeff in Canada and everybody.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
We're doing this together.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Huge shout out to my brother from another mother, Mark, who's the time to climb.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
One of the heroes in my pantheon for sure.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Thank you very much.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You better start sharing that.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
You better start sharing that.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I see 143 of you out there.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You better start sharing that.
