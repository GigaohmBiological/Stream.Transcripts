WEBVTT

00:19.411 --> 00:20.212
Trust me.

00:20.692 --> 00:23.555
It's real.

00:23.695 --> 00:26.057
It's real.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.058
Full speed, Kevin.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.061
Into the wall.

00:31.902 --> 00:32.843
The tunnel, I mean.

00:42.989 --> 01:01.483
uh six years back i asked one question i never got an answer from anyone do you know anyone that died from kovid it's the fog of antibodies war and a procrastination of the fall of the dollar you're getting fuked up the arse i don't know what that means dude um let's just look from where i'm sitting there's a whole bunch of kovid brain going around um

01:01.957 --> 01:04.178
Do I know anyone that died from a heart attack?

01:04.198 --> 01:07.621
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:07.694 --> 03:11.897
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, morning.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.859
Hello, hello, good morning ladies and gentlemen.

03:14.899 --> 03:15.720
Welcome to the show.

03:15.760 --> 03:22.464
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by biologist CQCQ.

03:22.524 --> 03:25.947
This is W3JJW, Whiskey Juliet.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.451
Sorry, I said that wrong.

03:28.531 --> 03:30.392
Whiskey 3 Juliet Juliet Whiskey.

03:31.052 --> 03:34.273
Whiskey 3 Juliet Juliet Whiskey.

03:34.293 --> 03:41.337
This is W3JJW calling CQDX, trying to get out to the rest of the world.

03:42.512 --> 03:46.156
trying to alert the world that America is being undermined from within.

03:46.957 --> 04:01.332
We need some help getting this word out about RNA not being able to pandemic, about intramuscular injection just being dumb, not medicine, and transfection and transformation being crimes in healthy humans, especially if they don't understand it.

04:02.613 --> 04:06.335
And the population pyramid being a real problem that's in need of management.

04:06.355 --> 04:10.497
Thank you very much for joining me this morning It's actually this afternoon.

04:10.557 --> 04:20.402
It's 1220 shame on me for being late 26 people watching I guess that's because I'm late this first video is a video which will

04:21.983 --> 04:25.504
try to put into perspective where we are.

04:25.524 --> 04:29.266
I'm just going to bring myself on screen for a second if you don't mind.

04:30.406 --> 04:33.948
Let me get over here and see if I can do this correctly.

04:35.868 --> 04:36.769
Good morning, everybody.

04:36.829 --> 04:37.450
Welcome to the show.

04:37.470 --> 04:41.534
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

04:41.574 --> 04:42.555
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

04:43.135 --> 04:46.238
I'm coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:46.519 --> 04:50.623
And yeah, we're just doing another show, trying to get things done.

04:50.843 --> 04:58.431
If you're trying to get books to me, for example, like these coming via Norway and Teo, thank you very much.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.912
Just arrived today at P.O.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.272
Box 802.

05:02.713 --> 05:04.493
Weatherman skills failing.

05:04.994 --> 05:05.394
At P.O.

05:05.414 --> 05:09.275
Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.317
You can also email this email address.

05:12.557 --> 05:13.917
Gosh, I'm not very good at this.

05:14.678 --> 05:21.601
You can email this email address and get out a mailing list, which kind of gives you a little bit of a heads up of whether I'm going to do a show.

05:22.361 --> 05:30.668
But unless I get hit by a train, I think I'm going to be doing a show Monday through Friday somewhere before noon and after 10 a.m.

05:30.768 --> 05:31.609
So between 10 and 12.

05:32.610 --> 05:39.776
I'll try to go on at 10 10 but that doesn't happen very often because I'm always making adjustments and then get interrupted and then I need another cup of coffee and

05:40.456 --> 05:50.180
I like to start at 10-10, 11-11, or 12-12, and today I started at 12-20, so I guess this is quite appropriate.

05:51.360 --> 05:57.123
Anyway, let me stop this music here and see if we can get on to some more serious things.

05:58.663 --> 06:04.966
I really would like to first start with a little video, so I'm gonna see if I can pop myself down here at the bottom

06:05.606 --> 06:09.347
and then slide myself over here seamlessly in the cut.

06:10.427 --> 06:11.347
Hello down here.

06:11.367 --> 06:19.809
Again, this is the email, the address that I need or would love if you want to send anything to the house, send it via the PO box.

06:20.669 --> 06:23.109
It's funny, sometimes if we don't check this, there's nothing there.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.430
Other times, if we don't check it for a couple of days, there's like five extra boxes.

06:27.010 --> 06:30.331
So thanks to everybody that sends things, they usually end up on the back,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.400
if I do this just cheating wise.

06:34.440 --> 06:41.025
They usually end up back there and so you can't always see them because that's always overexposed, especially when the back lights are on.

06:41.045 --> 06:41.906
Hold on one second.

06:43.147 --> 06:46.550
I am a photographer, just not a very good one all the time.

06:47.570 --> 06:50.673
But if I get rid of those lights, see, that'll help a little bit.

06:53.356 --> 06:54.076
There we go.

06:54.116 --> 06:54.837
That's a little better.

06:54.857 --> 06:57.918
So there you can see, um, back there is usually where the mail comes in.

06:58.598 --> 07:08.362
Um, sometimes I have some mail here, like the card I got from, um, uh, the, the Ellen Watts, Melissa Watts, uh, hook up there.

07:08.822 --> 07:10.843
Very excited about that coming in June.

07:11.323 --> 07:17.226
Um, and then I also just put some books here that I get sometimes when they arrive or books that I'm reading.

07:17.246 --> 07:20.187
Um, I got a whole pile of, uh,

07:21.517 --> 07:27.482
of autism, old autism magazines, and I'm trying to understand the narrative.

07:29.400 --> 07:42.249
I'm trying to understand the narrative that was laid out even before somebody as courageous as Brian Hooker in 2013 came out and said that he doesn't do that kind of stuff.

07:42.349 --> 07:47.252
He doesn't use the word autism because that's not a word for him.

07:47.332 --> 07:52.196
His son was vaccine damaged or vaccine injured or neurologically injured by a vaccine.

07:53.497 --> 07:55.859
Anyway, welcome to the show.

07:55.979 --> 08:02.585
I wanted to start with a video about Kevin McKernan, or made by Kevin McKernan's company, Cortinae or Cortinois.

08:02.625 --> 08:03.606
You'll hear it in a minute.

08:04.307 --> 08:04.927
It's a video from 2017.

08:06.008 --> 08:15.237
I want you to listen carefully to Kevin and his brother explain how medicine is about to change in the next 10 years.

08:15.357 --> 08:17.018
Please listen carefully.

08:17.793 --> 08:27.064
for how Kevin McKernan explains how medicine is gonna change in the next 10 years and understand that this script did not start at COVID.

08:27.565 --> 08:36.176
It just became a little more in our face during COVID, but this script has been going on behind the scenes for decades.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.738
And of that, I am sure.

08:47.466 --> 08:59.348
Cortigen Life Sciences, with headquarters in Warburn, Massachusetts, which is just outside of Boston, is transforming the field of genetic testing and creating new ways to unlock the secrets that are hidden deep in our DNA.

08:59.988 --> 09:15.211
They're actually finding new methods to transform genetic sequencing information into meaningful test results to better understand why people have epilepsy and seizure disorders, mitochondrial disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders, and what treatments may or may not work with an individual.

09:16.923 --> 09:22.304
So we decided to take a trip to Cortogen to meet the team and to find out what's going on in their laboratory.

09:29.238 --> 09:29.598
It is a child.

09:29.658 --> 09:35.983
Hi everyone, and today we're in Louisville, Massachusetts at Cortigen Life Sciences to meet the team and to find more about what they do.

09:36.403 --> 09:40.626
Cortigen was started by three brothers, Brian, Brendan, and Kevin McKernan.

09:41.206 --> 09:50.912
I had a chance to sit down and talk to Brendan and Kevin about their cutting-edge company and how they're changing the way patients with neurological disorders are diagnosed and treated.

09:50.932 --> 09:54.355
I learned that they had previously started two other companies.

09:55.256 --> 09:59.060
One of which developed a way to sequence DNA much faster and for less money.

09:59.942 --> 10:02.285
It was the basis of where Cortigen is today.

10:05.329 --> 10:09.534
It was a very big transformation to have sequencing technology change in that time frame.

10:09.614 --> 10:13.379
It went from costing maybe 300 million dollars to sequencing a human genome.

10:13.698 --> 10:29.686
now for me this is really familiar territory because they've been singing this song for 25 years now singing the song about how sequencing has become cheaper producing dna in pure large quantities has become cheaper

10:32.768 --> 10:36.271
And therefore transformation and transfection has become cheaper.

10:36.351 --> 10:36.851
That's it.

10:36.931 --> 10:38.413
That's what we need to hear here.

10:38.673 --> 10:48.081
And everyone from Kurtzweiler all the way to McKernan has been selling this as evidence of their amazing contribution to the progression of technology.

10:48.121 --> 10:56.728
This does not mean because they can copy books in a language they don't understand that they understand that language any better because they can copy the books cheaper.

10:57.540 --> 11:03.545
And we don't even know, because we don't understand the language, if we are copying those books with high fidelity or low fidelity.

11:04.205 --> 11:16.455
And that is one of the most remarkable assumptions that underlies this narrative, is that the fidelity of this process is intact, is real, when we can't even really verify it.

11:18.363 --> 11:22.948
And if we can now verify it, it is not a technology that we've had for that long.

11:23.348 --> 11:32.898
And it is still based on the modeling and approximation and probability models that all sequencing is based on.

11:34.585 --> 11:39.930
genome down to maybe $3,000 in a matter of like three to four years.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.092
So real dramatic change.

11:42.892 --> 11:57.345
And we started to see people apply this to patients and find out the underlying cause of their disease and make changes that... I would instead ask the question, what if autism is just a consequence of their program?

11:58.945 --> 12:00.145
It's just a consequence.

12:00.225 --> 12:02.206
It might be an unintended consequence.

12:02.246 --> 12:13.610
It might be something that they would rather have not happened because it would be better if they didn't have to have this elaborate fake anti-vax movement in order to deal with the problem.

12:13.810 --> 12:17.832
Absolutely, but I think you should see it more as just a consequence of their program.

12:19.592 --> 12:21.053
It's nothing they could have foreseen.

12:21.701 --> 12:29.328
immediately benefited the patients, which was remarkable and that made us think we need to do this at a much grander scale.

12:30.249 --> 12:36.596
We've been hearing from many of the physicians that this is really invaluable data in understanding and managing patient care.

12:37.076 --> 12:44.283
We've been hearing from physicians that genetic data is valuable to provide care.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.444
Stop lying!

12:48.228 --> 12:53.272
That is frickin' crazy remarkable to me that he even said that.

12:53.832 --> 12:56.995
We just gotta go back, because this whole thing is so thick.

12:57.535 --> 12:59.256
He lays it on so thick here.

12:59.296 --> 13:07.963
It is so perfect on Francis Collins, on Mark Lander, on Ventner, on everybody.

13:08.183 --> 13:13.067
This is just rock solid, dead on balls narrative.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.349
And I mean big time, bad biology,

13:17.412 --> 13:19.377
narrative like this is ridiculous

13:20.525 --> 13:26.828
We could envision having a collaborative ecosystem to bring patients and doctors together to start sharing these anecdotal cases.

13:26.948 --> 13:39.053
Benefit of the patients, which was to buy this to patients and find out the underlying cause of their disease and make changes that immediately benefited the patients, which was remarkable.

13:39.073 --> 13:46.876
$300 million to sequencing the human genome down to maybe $3,000 in a matter of like three to four years.

13:48.016 --> 13:49.056
real dramatic change.

13:49.877 --> 14:01.180
And we started to see people apply this to patients and find out the underlying cause of their disease and make changes that immediately benefited the patients, which was remarkable.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.801
And that made us think we need to do this at a much grander scale.

14:05.522 --> 14:13.144
That is a bold fricking claim that we have heard from doctors

14:14.667 --> 14:19.149
who have made changes based on the data that we've provided.

14:19.970 --> 14:21.591
Is the data a whole genome?

14:21.631 --> 14:22.771
Like they just give them a book.

14:22.811 --> 14:23.692
Here you go, doc.

14:24.292 --> 14:31.175
You know, it's color-coded for all the different genotypes and, you know, just flip through it and let us know what you find.

14:31.215 --> 14:43.702
We highlighted some of the most important parts, but other than that, you know, it's a couple of genetic polymorphisms, a few, you know, single polyphenucleotide morphins, you know, just a bunch of stuff like that.

14:45.339 --> 14:46.679
What is he talking about?

14:46.739 --> 14:48.040
Listen carefully now.

14:50.220 --> 14:56.602
We've been hearing from many of the physicians that this is really invaluable data in understanding and managing patient care.

14:57.542 --> 15:04.084
We can envision having a collaborative ecosystem to bring patients and doctors together and to start sharing these anecdotal cases.

15:04.564 --> 15:06.125
This is not a joke.

15:06.185 --> 15:13.087
The anecdotal cases they believe are these weird genetic susceptibilities.

15:15.649 --> 15:16.810
Sometimes it's autism.

15:16.870 --> 15:19.233
Sometimes it's an allergy.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.794
Sometimes they get CFS.

15:20.835 --> 15:25.079
It's all just genetic, just predispositions.

15:25.139 --> 15:28.282
And we just have to sequence people and find the predispositions.

15:28.743 --> 15:31.486
And then we can design a vaccine program for you.

15:34.005 --> 15:36.846
and try to change medicine a lot faster than it has been done in the past.

15:37.166 --> 15:51.290
We believe the clinical trials are gonna change dramatically in the next 10 years, that they will begin to use DNA sequencing as almost a trial requirement so that they- They will begin to use DNA sequencing.

15:51.490 --> 15:59.893
They will begin to use DNA sequencing as a primary trial tool.

16:02.099 --> 16:03.099
Listen carefully.

16:03.719 --> 16:04.640
Listen carefully.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.820
Sorry for the double there.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.642
Oh, I got to start it again first.

16:11.882 --> 16:13.062
Oh, get out of the way, mouse.

16:13.322 --> 16:25.626
We can begin to focus their drugs in the next 10 years that they will begin to use DNA sequencing as almost a trial requirement so that they can begin to... A trial requirement.

16:25.686 --> 16:26.306
That's what he said.

16:27.313 --> 16:31.054
Focus their drugs at the right patient populations.

16:31.354 --> 16:39.415
Right now, medicine is very much a law of averages game where they look to see if a drug works across the entire population and see how well it works.

16:40.115 --> 16:41.695
And those days might be over.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.516
Those days are probably going to change.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.356
We need to sequence everyone.

16:46.436 --> 16:49.117
Otherwise, we don't even know if drugs work for you.

16:51.197 --> 16:52.997
We need to sequence everyone.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.098
Or maybe just the really sick anecdotal people.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.041
It doesn't really matter.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.985
If you're advocating for this, you are advocating for the bad biology.

17:03.045 --> 17:11.353
You are imagining that the vast majority of what we call disease in health is something connected to genes.

17:11.993 --> 17:18.699
And if we just knew what those genes were, then we could get a suite of medicines that would be best for those.

17:18.779 --> 17:22.663
Sounds so much like the domain server, doesn't it?

17:22.723 --> 17:23.784
But in a different spin.

17:28.989 --> 17:36.655
to the point where the pharmaceutical companies recognize that, well, we need to first figure out which patients the drugs are good for.

17:36.875 --> 17:42.580
So the pharmaceutical companies also recognize that we have to figure out who the drugs are good for.

17:42.640 --> 17:57.692
So the pharmaceutical companies also recognize that the genetic background of all these people would be useful, or could be useful, or might be useful data to hide behind, or might be a useful argument to make so that we never have to test drugs again.

18:01.078 --> 18:07.514
so that we never have to, you know, we can just use vaccines and we'll just use mRNA and we'll just design it for you and so then screw it.

18:07.975 --> 18:10.582
The FDA is corrupt anyway, we might as well get rid of it.

18:15.049 --> 18:20.111
and then get much better yield and efficacy by placing the right drugs to the right patients.

18:20.471 --> 18:35.976
Eventually we could work with- This is actually a lot of what Sasha Latupova worked on with her company, which was trying to screen people with, you know, weird heart arrhythmia so that when you gave a drug that would change the heart arrhythmia, it would, you know, be more likely to not, you know, catch that person.

18:36.016 --> 18:42.898
We don't want to use any people where they are vulnerable to a heart medication or heart side effects, so we'll screen them.

18:43.698 --> 18:45.218
and keep them out of those trials.

18:45.278 --> 18:46.819
It's the same bullshit.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.520
Working for the same slavers.

18:49.900 --> 18:55.101
The pharmaceutical companies say, hey, this is an interesting target for a child that might have chronic fatigue.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.522
Perhaps we should have a- Chronic fatigue?

18:57.782 --> 18:59.422
What's that, Judy Mikovits?

19:00.502 --> 19:02.383
Joint development to bring another drug to market.

19:03.163 --> 19:10.505
So we're very hopeful that this process of finding drugs is going to speed up and accelerate based on genetics.

19:12.054 --> 19:17.899
We hope the process of finding drugs is going to speed up thanks to genetics.

19:21.663 --> 19:23.725
Actually, that's probably an incorrect sound.

19:23.765 --> 19:24.906
I mean, I should have probably gone.

19:26.007 --> 19:28.629
That's absolutely right on dead on balls narrative.

19:28.689 --> 19:34.634
He's been, he's been dead on balls narrative from the very beginning because in 2017 he was dead on balls narrative.

19:38.177 --> 19:46.142
working toward this goal of sequencing first, I guess we'll start with all the interesting kids and all the all the screwed up anecdotal cases.

19:46.182 --> 19:50.245
And then we'll combine that with the with the genome data that we're already collecting.

19:50.305 --> 19:57.489
And once we get there, you know, we'll establish this new stream of remnants in 2020, where everybody will just be swabbing.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.032
I wonder what kind of samples they use.

20:02.660 --> 20:12.525
Then I spoke with Holly Hornung, a genetic counselor, and she described how doctors work with parents to order the tests for their children and what happens after they receive the results.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.187
Order the tests for their children?

20:15.647 --> 20:16.807
Why would they need to do that?

20:16.847 --> 20:18.388
It's the Human Genome Project.

20:18.448 --> 20:22.250
It's only like $3,000 to sequence the whole genome.

20:22.290 --> 20:23.511
So what are the tests?

20:26.172 --> 20:27.693
What are the tests that they're running?

20:28.433 --> 20:32.635
Why is it described like that when it's just a genome sequence, right?

20:33.175 --> 20:35.376
Or maybe it's not, huh?

20:36.137 --> 20:37.477
Maybe it's not.

20:38.918 --> 20:40.259
Do you see the illusion?

20:41.039 --> 20:43.120
They're not sequencing these kids.

20:44.320 --> 20:49.583
They're looking for markers, which is a very, very easy thing to do with PCR.

20:52.807 --> 21:01.829
They're not sequencing these kids and looking at the whole genome and deciding what's useful unless they're giving that information to the government or storing it somewhere.

21:02.389 --> 21:03.470
Where are they storing it?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.590
You see the problem that that creates?

21:07.131 --> 21:08.311
This is an illusion.

21:08.371 --> 21:16.253
And if you assume that it's all sequencing, it's all magic because they invented the machines, then you assume that they're really doing what they say they're doing.

21:17.281 --> 21:25.363
when they could just be making restriction enzyme maps of everybody and sequencing the useful areas that they have some handhold on what's going on there.

21:26.323 --> 21:30.024
And the rest is just, holy cow, billions of bases.

21:30.064 --> 21:31.625
We have no, we don't play with those.

21:33.985 --> 21:41.827
They tell you a few stories about cystic fibrosis and a few stories about autism and a few stories about, you know, personalized medicine.

21:41.887 --> 21:45.568
And it just round and round and round it goes for decades.

21:50.379 --> 21:56.705
So my primary role here is to review all the genetic data that comes from our patients and write reports.

21:57.266 --> 22:06.415
And I really just try to look to see if we can find an answer for why patients are having symptoms, be it epilepsy or developmental delay, and just so we can give families answers.

22:06.876 --> 22:12.541
So the testing needs to be ordered by a physician, so either a pediatrician, a neurologist, a geneticist.

22:12.561 --> 22:14.023
It doesn't really matter what specialty.

22:14.443 --> 22:22.889
So essentially what they do is they sequence a bunch of markers that have known connections to some symptomologies, you know, like correlation.

22:23.770 --> 22:31.735
And then they take your genome and they look at those things and they try to tell you a story that might explain why you have chronic fatigue.

22:34.837 --> 22:38.760
Or maybe why you developed, why you developed, stop.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.181
I have no responsibility.

22:40.941 --> 22:42.643
Why you developed epilepsy, right?

22:43.561 --> 22:44.081
That's all.

22:44.862 --> 22:52.746
And then the doctors find it really useful if we tell them this information, because then they can make changes to their treatments.

22:54.226 --> 22:55.407
This is just an illusion.

22:55.447 --> 22:57.968
You can see that this woman is like, what, huh?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.429
I kind of just do stuff.

22:59.469 --> 23:00.970
I don't really figure anything out.

23:01.570 --> 23:05.312
I just put some stuff in an Excel sheet, and then I look at the useful ones.

23:05.372 --> 23:10.635
And maybe I Google PubMed a couple genes, and then I make up a story.

23:12.031 --> 23:14.933
It's like, it is so much like Theranos.

23:15.013 --> 23:15.954
It's kind of frightening.

23:17.115 --> 23:28.883
And if you realize that their dad was connected to microarray data and microarray technology back when, you know, sequencing pathogens and sequencing, sequencing was already interesting.

23:28.923 --> 23:32.285
And that's how this brothers, these brothers got their start.

23:34.007 --> 23:34.927
Come on guys.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.871
This is like a Jeff Bezos or an Elon Musk.

23:42.748 --> 23:46.151
He's been given technology that other people invented.

23:46.171 --> 24:00.023
He probably contributed something clever to it, but it's just, he is the forward facing face of a whole huge project of people that I guess none of those other people have anything to say.

24:00.083 --> 24:09.851
Just Kevin McKernan's got stuff to say for the last five years about the pandemic and about PCR and about DNA contamination and methyl pseudouridine.

24:11.109 --> 24:35.456
Nobody else that worked on the Human Genome Project anywhere on earth has anything to say but Kevin McKernan, this guy, who has an oddly interestingly parallel interest to Claire Craig of the 100,000 Genomes Project, a clinical pathologist in the UK who was assembling 100,000 genomes to look at some chronic diseases and stuff like that before the pandemic.

24:38.257 --> 24:49.410
You know, Claire Craig, the one that Kevin McKernan wrote the Drorsten report with, where they kind of objected to the primers of the WHO PCR test and said that that guy from Germany is bad.

24:52.982 --> 25:11.984
It's all one big show and there are only a few key liars that are necessary to sustain it and everybody else can just have interest in in popularity or in sponsorships or in their rising view count in hopes that they're gonna get on Joe Rogan and then I guess they're gonna retire somewhere.

25:12.024 --> 25:12.384
I don't know.

25:13.065 --> 25:13.725
It's gross.

25:16.927 --> 25:20.009
And then cortisone just provides a saliva tube.

25:20.049 --> 25:21.409
So all you have to do is spit in a tube.

25:21.489 --> 25:23.130
You don't have to get a blood draw or anything.

25:23.830 --> 25:25.411
A saliva tube.

25:25.871 --> 25:26.032
Oh.

25:26.852 --> 25:27.092
Huh.

25:27.892 --> 25:37.817
So maybe I'm right about the fact that the use of PCR as a diagnostic in all of our hospitals is actually just a remnant stream for whole genome sequencing.

25:37.857 --> 25:39.278
Maybe I'm not so crazy after.

25:39.678 --> 25:40.198
Wow.

25:40.298 --> 25:41.319
Isn't that interesting?

25:41.799 --> 25:42.019
Huh.

25:42.980 --> 25:43.200
Huh.

25:43.922 --> 25:45.703
Those remnants aren't worth anything.

25:46.183 --> 25:48.344
Nobody would ever want those swabs.

25:49.885 --> 25:52.467
We can send it to your house if your doctor doesn't have one in their office.

25:53.807 --> 25:55.208
They can send it to your house.

25:55.368 --> 25:55.728
Wow.

25:55.848 --> 25:56.349
Interesting.

25:56.409 --> 25:58.310
I guess that they could scale that up.

25:58.370 --> 25:58.790
Couldn't they?

25:58.870 --> 25:59.750
Oh, wait, they did.

25:59.771 --> 26:00.491
Uh-huh.

26:01.428 --> 26:02.369
Cool, that's about it.

26:02.770 --> 26:15.770
So they'll get a genetic test result, which is essentially just a few pieces of paper, and it'll show them what genetic variants or what changes in their genes that we looked at were identified and if anything we think is associated with it.

26:16.314 --> 26:21.018
And so they can only look at patterns that are consistent across many genomes.

26:21.078 --> 26:23.099
They can only look at patterns that remain.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.681
And those patterns don't cover everything.

26:26.102 --> 26:29.324
Those patterns have nothing to do with the trajectory across time.

26:29.705 --> 26:38.872
Those patterns have nothing to do with the assembly of proteins or their temporal expression patterns or their folding patterns in different, nothing to do with that.

26:39.693 --> 26:43.636
And since ribosomes are the most important machine in our body,

26:45.626 --> 26:48.668
And they're also encoded in DNA and they never talk about those.

26:49.288 --> 26:50.569
It's just kind of weird.

26:51.309 --> 26:52.730
You know, it's just kind of weird.

26:52.830 --> 26:56.752
Ribosomes are actually RNA protein, riboprotein machines.

26:56.772 --> 27:00.734
You know, they're made of RNA and protein subunits, which is pretty cool.

27:01.255 --> 27:01.555
I don't know.

27:02.235 --> 27:02.795
I think it's cool.

27:07.631 --> 27:09.572
I also got to take a tour of the lab.

27:10.032 --> 27:16.214
Christine Stanley, the chief lab director, told me about the entire process and how the technology works.

27:18.014 --> 27:20.795
So we'll get individual patient samples.

27:20.815 --> 27:24.317
We'll come in and get them by FedEx and other methods.

27:24.837 --> 27:31.199
Most of our samples come in through saliva, saliva tubes at room temperature, or we also accept blood.

27:32.019 --> 27:33.700
And the first step is to

27:35.200 --> 27:46.968
take that patient information, enter it into our system, remove the sample, make sure everything looks okay, make sure there's good identifiers so that we're not mixing up different patient samples with one another.

27:46.988 --> 27:52.212
So we keep good tracking of all that patient information as soon as it comes in the door.

27:53.233 --> 27:57.136
Once we have that saliva sample ready, then we need to go to extraction.

27:58.036 --> 28:10.333
and we will extract the DNA from the saliva or the blood sample and then we'll need to take the sample and we do like a barcoding to the sample so that we know

28:12.324 --> 28:14.185
It's a weird question that you put in the chat.

28:14.206 --> 28:22.492
I don't know if you saw what I held up before, but I see Taxicube has a question about the Marvel Universe, boys, etc.

28:22.572 --> 28:25.694
Autism movement, genetic testing, and vaccination have to do with each other.

28:26.255 --> 28:30.098
There was a comic book that was put out in

28:32.180 --> 28:33.441
This is cool.

28:33.501 --> 28:34.281
Check it out, baby.

28:36.183 --> 28:37.183
Let's go over here.

28:37.984 --> 28:38.664
Did that not work?

28:39.064 --> 28:39.525
What the hell?

28:39.945 --> 28:40.925
I didn't have the camera on?

28:41.065 --> 28:41.466
Of course!

28:42.466 --> 28:46.749
You know, I'm gonna really, seriously, my technical staff is just falling apart.

28:46.809 --> 28:52.732
So I got this comic, number one, never touched, probably should put gloves on if I was a real comic book guy.

28:52.772 --> 28:53.573
Come on GoPro, do your thing.

28:57.635 --> 29:02.526
In case you want, one of my secrets is that the best GoPro is GoPro 7 Black.

29:02.666 --> 29:03.748
Everything else is crap.

29:04.229 --> 29:06.414
GoPro 7 Black allows you to do two things.

29:06.634 --> 29:08.438
One, you can get a live feed.

29:09.815 --> 29:16.680
like this, and that live feed can also be powered by USB-C, so you can do it forever.

29:17.301 --> 29:19.122
And that's the only GoPro that does that.

29:19.222 --> 29:21.244
Any other GoPro, they've screwed that part up.

29:21.844 --> 29:34.454
So you can't buy a 7 Black anymore, except for secondhand, but if you find one or you see one on Craigslist, buy it, send it to 802-PO-BOX, 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, 15102, and I'll put it to work.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.035
And this is my GoPro 7 here.

29:38.636 --> 29:42.376
And this is the first fantastic issue of Face Value Comics.

29:43.276 --> 29:44.837
Now this thing is dope!

29:47.597 --> 29:48.417
Why is it dope?

29:50.758 --> 29:56.079
Autism and face values studies facial expressions as one way to improve communication.

29:56.639 --> 30:01.060
Now I can't show you all this right now because I'm afraid I just want to preface it first.

30:03.382 --> 30:04.983
and why I'm so excited about it.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.344
I don't know why that's flaring.

30:06.664 --> 30:08.325
Let's see if I can fix that flare.

30:09.446 --> 30:10.486
I can't fix that flare.

30:10.526 --> 30:11.947
It's just how I have it set up.

30:12.007 --> 30:14.209
That's also how I get some light back on my face.

30:15.629 --> 30:20.813
So anyway, the reason why I think this is cool is because neuroscience, that

30:23.151 --> 30:24.953
that field I used to work in a long time ago.

30:24.973 --> 30:35.923
Neuroscience has this whole subfield of facial recognition cells in monkeys where they record from grandmother's cells and Bill Gates' cells and they have

30:37.748 --> 30:45.350
created this mythology about the possibility that individual neurons encode faces.

30:46.410 --> 30:56.713
And they have pursued these ideas under the pretense that autistic kids cannot recognize facial expressions and emotion.

30:56.953 --> 30:59.914
And so we need to study that part of the brain.

31:00.334 --> 31:03.835
And then we can maybe compare the autistic brain to the,

31:05.676 --> 31:06.696
the normal brain.

31:06.716 --> 31:15.603
Now, obviously, I think that that's silly, but that's what this comic book is essentially supposed to be reinforcing.

31:17.345 --> 31:19.386
That's what this money was spent to do.

31:19.467 --> 31:24.430
Now, if this artist has no idea that that whole concept is dumb,

31:25.233 --> 31:35.056
that that's not a way of thinking about autism when it's just neurological damage after repeated intramuscular injection as 2013 Brian Hooker would say.

31:35.996 --> 31:43.838
But instead, they want you to believe it's a very complex disorder with a complex bouquet of environmental and genetic causes.

31:44.838 --> 31:49.439
And one of the things that can happen is a lot of these kids don't recognize facial expressions.

31:49.839 --> 31:52.120
And so we should understand them better.

31:53.677 --> 31:59.858
We should try to understand autistic kids and we should have our kids understand other autistic kids that they don't get faces.

32:00.558 --> 32:01.658
And this is a big thing.

32:01.698 --> 32:03.219
They put this in place.

32:04.739 --> 32:05.779
Sorry, I can't read.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.760
2013, this one's coming from.

32:09.380 --> 32:22.642
So 2013, coincidentally, the same year that Brian Hooker was recorded as saying that he doesn't use the word autism because his kid was neurologically damaged due to intramuscular injection or, you know, vaccination.

32:24.215 --> 32:25.115
So that's pretty cool.

32:25.235 --> 32:29.096
You just mentioned that, so I thought I would show you that.

32:29.156 --> 32:33.317
We might read that later, because it's actually a really cool comic about a future world.

32:34.257 --> 32:37.138
Let me just do it a little bit, because it's just awesome.

32:38.878 --> 32:40.158
Welcome to the future!

32:40.178 --> 32:43.799
I am Tess, your guide for this adventure.

32:44.019 --> 32:49.040
Whenever you see my face inside the gears, look for more information about characters in our story.

32:50.371 --> 32:53.752
In 2072, aliens attacked Earth.

32:53.812 --> 32:57.394
Our peaceful society seemed to be unprepared, but not the Zephyr.

32:58.874 --> 33:03.035
Most people think he is just a blue costume crime fighter, but he's been a surprising help.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.317
Eel men are breaking through our defenses.

33:06.397 --> 33:09.158
Let the shimmer fly for the airborne resistance.

33:09.878 --> 33:13.319
Sergeant Stumpy, get your wasp ready, your wasp cannon.

33:14.279 --> 33:15.920
Fall back and protect the robot.

33:17.341 --> 33:19.222
Sometimes the world may seem confusing.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.783
Let me help you understand.

33:20.883 --> 33:23.264
First, listen to the Zephyr and be safe.

33:23.324 --> 33:26.786
I'll tell you the story about our story so far, so it's really bizarre.

33:27.827 --> 33:29.748
We didn't always live this way.

33:29.828 --> 33:30.968
Don't worry about the Zephyr.

33:30.988 --> 33:33.650
He's a strong fighter who knows and sees a lot.

33:33.690 --> 33:35.050
He just wants us to be safe.

33:37.331 --> 33:39.212
Why are you reading a comic book?

33:39.232 --> 33:39.933
We're at war.

33:41.727 --> 33:46.815
Space birds, the shimmer, don't, didn't always live amongst the clouds.

33:46.835 --> 33:47.836
Okay.

33:48.718 --> 33:52.564
Mankind didn't always fly steam powered gyrocopters either.

33:54.141 --> 33:54.641
Here it goes.

33:54.802 --> 33:58.585
A hundred years after atomic bombings, world leaders met in Japan.

33:58.805 --> 34:02.108
Mankind admitted and learned from its shared mistakes.

34:02.708 --> 34:10.294
Now I've been saying for a while that they're eventually going to admit that the old vaccine schedule was less than optimal.

34:10.334 --> 34:15.258
And one of the ways that they will admit it is what Kevin McKernan is talking about in this video.

34:15.979 --> 34:27.085
where he says that, you know, he wants to see in the next 10 years that the use of drugs in medicine and production of drugs in medicine will become based on or require genetic screening.

34:29.027 --> 34:34.650
And so here, talking about admitting mistakes, that's how they're going to get you to accept it.

34:35.450 --> 34:39.713
They're going to tell you what James Lyons Weiler agrees with

34:41.171 --> 34:42.252
Paul Offit about it.

34:42.292 --> 34:46.175
It's a complex interplay of environmental and genetic causes.

34:46.895 --> 34:52.940
And so, since the environmental causes are irreducibly complex, we might as well focus on the genetic causes.

34:56.690 --> 35:07.758
And I really believe that although this comic book has nothing to do with that directly, it is a thematically related story because they are planning to admit something.

35:07.838 --> 35:14.303
Even if it's just that the first round of the COVID vaccines weren't very good because we used the gain-of-function spike protein.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.185
I mean, that's where this is going.

35:18.486 --> 35:24.270
And so governments made peace agreements, scientists found fuels, new fuels and medicines

35:25.427 --> 35:27.731
Humanity saw an end to much suffering.

35:28.872 --> 35:30.014
Look at the phoenix there.

35:30.054 --> 35:31.517
That's a phoenix in that picture.

35:31.557 --> 35:31.897
See that?

35:31.957 --> 35:32.458
The phoenix?

35:32.518 --> 35:33.480
Do you see the phoenix?

35:33.560 --> 35:34.621
Do you see the phoenix?

35:39.364 --> 35:44.865
Union that the Scald Union ensured steam-powered technologies became available to the masses.

35:44.906 --> 35:48.466
You see so the masses get to use shitty technology.

35:48.726 --> 35:49.847
I don't trust Scald.

35:50.987 --> 35:54.568
Vegetarian diets reduced world hunger.

35:55.148 --> 35:55.968
Listen to this.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.349
This is a comic book.

35:59.929 --> 36:01.290
And over the next generation

36:02.435 --> 36:06.798
Over the next generation, Earth welcomed extraterrestrial visitors, too.

36:06.858 --> 36:18.924
Several peace-loving aliens sought safety in our utopian society where vegetarians eat and where everybody uses steam power.

36:19.024 --> 36:21.106
Of course, there's walking trees.

36:22.352 --> 36:26.676
There's animals called Chilaxin that use sunlight for food.

36:27.636 --> 36:30.739
And there are bio droids with fiber optic vines.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.462
And not all the robots on Earth are good, though.

36:36.284 --> 36:38.125
They live beneath the oceans.

36:38.205 --> 36:39.987
And these guys are bad guys, apparently.

36:40.447 --> 36:42.429
And they live beneath the polluted water.

36:43.890 --> 36:45.071
And yada, yada, yada.

36:46.690 --> 36:52.609
Curious of our surface world, the Jachari shared unique literature, music, and almost magical science.

36:54.309 --> 36:56.350
Anyway, it goes on and on and on, right?

36:56.430 --> 36:57.531
That's what we're doing.

36:57.591 --> 37:11.298
And if there's ever any confusion or if you're supposed to feel confused with the main character, who's of course a superhero, who's just an autistic kid who has anxiety, then they turn the page upside down and you have to read it upside down.

37:11.338 --> 37:15.440
And that's supposed to make you, you know, empathize with the guy in the character.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.141
So we might look at this.

37:17.261 --> 37:18.261
I haven't finished reading.

37:18.281 --> 37:19.442
I haven't even started reading it.

37:19.482 --> 37:21.023
That was actually the first time I read it.

37:21.903 --> 37:32.170
so it's a little sharp it's a little crispy um it was meant to be another show and i didn't have anything else to do so i probably wasted a little time there but because somebody asked that in the chat

37:34.642 --> 37:38.286
I just thought that notepad is the perfect notebook form.

37:38.306 --> 37:39.066
That is correct.

37:40.388 --> 37:43.531
In case you're wondering, this is a Rhodia notebook.

37:43.571 --> 37:45.753
But yes, that is absolutely correct.

37:46.313 --> 37:49.857
I would agree with that 100% with Garden Variety Human.

37:51.158 --> 37:53.540
So let me flash back over here, get this started again.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.902
Shoot, we're still on the same video.

37:55.242 --> 37:57.606
processing that belongs to that patient.

37:58.187 --> 38:05.638
So when we mix the samples in the next steps, we can take all that back out and we can separate all the patients with one of those.

38:05.819 --> 38:10.025
Each sample gets a unique code to it that's actually embedded in the sample itself.

38:10.836 --> 38:17.762
So it sounds like, to me, what they've really done is mastered the ability to screen lots of people or do lots of tests, you see.

38:18.282 --> 38:23.146
It's not so much the insight that they're providing, it's the data they're generating.

38:23.306 --> 38:23.967
Oh, the data.

38:24.227 --> 38:28.370
Once we have the sample extracted, then we have to prep it for sequencing.

38:28.610 --> 38:32.494
And once we then prep the samples, we'll run those through our MiSeqs.

38:33.254 --> 38:39.259
and they will obtain the DNA sequence of the samples.

38:39.579 --> 38:59.356
But what we'll do then is we'll take the information from the patient, what's the clinical presentation of the patient, and then we look at the variation that we identified in that patient's DNA sequence, and we'll look at the genes where we find the variation, and we say what clinical presentation

38:59.781 --> 39:02.142
I wonder what the variation is from, right?

39:02.182 --> 39:06.105
What do they start as a baseline for the variation that they identify?

39:06.585 --> 39:08.026
That's all the wizardry here.

39:08.066 --> 39:12.749
This is no different than 23andMe or Theranos or any of these other things.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.229
Theranos was doing it with blood.

39:14.289 --> 39:19.793
These guys are doing it with sick kids who are fine with giving a sample of their saliva.

39:19.893 --> 39:22.574
And so this is remarkable.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.255
2017, Kevin McKernan.

39:26.195 --> 39:30.178
is associated with individuals who have variation in those genes.

39:30.939 --> 39:48.192
Our field is expanding so quickly and the information that we're getting is just so immense that we're rapidly starting to collaborate with other laboratories and form large collaborative databases where we all put our information in there from the patients that we've sequenced.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.335
Large collaborative databases, what could go wrong?

39:52.075 --> 39:55.418
And we use each other's information to help figure out

39:55.913 --> 40:02.616
when we get those uncertain variants or uncertain variations in the sequence, what that means.

40:05.138 --> 40:10.020
Finally, I talked to Doug Kennedy, Director of Nonprofit and Volunteer Outreach.

40:10.820 --> 40:15.863
I was thrilled to learn that at the center of the Corningian culture is the spirit of giving back.

40:16.638 --> 40:20.719
I think there's a true compassion and genuineness behind Cordington's leadership and their staff.

40:21.320 --> 40:25.041
I think that in itself gives us a platform to really touch a lot of lives.

40:25.321 --> 40:40.886
We sponsor events, either putting on walks or dinner parties or things to really benefit the lives of the people, you know, families like your own and to give them a brighter future and a community to learn from.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.167
I think it's more motivating than being able to

40:44.088 --> 40:52.512
uh, discover the underlying cause of the disease and see outcomes, see patients that are affected by this and perhaps cured by this.

40:52.872 --> 40:57.474
Nothing is more rewarding than finding the underlying causes and curing kids.

40:57.554 --> 40:59.075
This guy is amazing.

40:59.095 --> 41:01.736
Yeah.

41:01.796 --> 41:05.018
So murder and lies for what I would argue the human genome project.

41:05.058 --> 41:09.200
That's the reason why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

41:11.621 --> 41:15.045
It's a pretty bold statement to make, I think, but I'm going to make that statement.

41:18.488 --> 41:33.645
So just taking it one step further, if the body starts reusing those pseudouridines in large quantities and other proteins, then you could be seeing mutations of important proteins in your body, at least in certain areas.

41:34.369 --> 41:35.890
hasn't been really tracked down.

41:36.411 --> 41:46.399
They're leveraging an important pathway in biology to evade some of the RNases without really taking a close look at what does that do to the RNA biology in the cell.

41:46.799 --> 41:54.266
So he's just complicating things with bullshit because we actually use pseudouridine in our cells, it's there.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.788
It's not like it can't be degraded.

41:57.248 --> 42:01.572
And so he's pretending, the guy just asked him if it could mutate genes.

42:03.834 --> 42:11.337
This is the methyl pseudouridine in the RNA transfection is not going to mutate any genes, but it's going to screw up a lot of stuff.

42:11.818 --> 42:15.099
But if he gets you to chase that one down, that's just great.

42:15.179 --> 42:16.360
This is last year.

42:18.041 --> 42:22.943
The reason why I'm showing you this video is because at the very end of the video, he addresses this list.

42:24.212 --> 42:37.560
This list where RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injection is dumb, transfection in healthy humans was always a crime, and the population pyramid is a problem being actively managed by his bosses.

42:38.180 --> 42:42.923
He will say a response to this list at the end of this video.

42:42.963 --> 42:44.004
This video is from mid 24.

42:46.926 --> 42:51.509
Okay, can you go back to the melting point idea that you mentioned?

42:52.050 --> 42:54.932
How would that affect the RNA, if at all?

42:55.952 --> 42:58.494
It changes the secondary structure, meaning it folds differently.

42:58.634 --> 43:05.739
And a lot of the enzymes in your body and a lot of the toll receptors key in on single versus double-stranded RNA.

43:05.879 --> 43:11.704
And I think most of the vaccine RNA, it's gonna look like double-stranded RNA just because it folds and hairpins.

43:11.804 --> 43:15.827
There's a paper that I put out with Peter McCullough on this, where if you take,

43:16.607 --> 43:30.029
the codon-optimized sequences, which are a lot more GC enriched and also have these N1-methylsutadiuridines and put them into a program called RNA Fold, you'll see a completely different secondary structure for the vaccines than you'll see for the virus.

43:30.590 --> 43:44.012
And so he's arguing that they'll be degraded because of the secondary structure or they won't be degraded because of the secondary structure, never mind the fact that the, sorry, the tertiary structure, but the tertiary structure is what it's selected on then.

43:45.097 --> 43:47.018
The tertiary structure could give it function.

43:47.078 --> 43:52.121
The tertiary structure could make it avoid or attract these toll-like receptors.

43:52.601 --> 43:58.864
But instead, he talks in big terms like it'll look double-stranded, it'll look single-stranded.

43:58.984 --> 44:03.767
No, he's just overcomplicating something that's very simple.

44:04.167 --> 44:07.909
Transfection in healthy humans is a crime.

44:08.709 --> 44:34.498
because the injection of RNA with the intention of expressing a protein in random places and getting the body to usefully respond to the biological consequences of that hypothetical protein is so many layers of dumb, it actually makes the old vaccine schedule look somewhat intelligent in certain contexts and in certain manifestations.

44:37.765 --> 44:39.086
That's how remarkable it is.

44:39.266 --> 44:47.533
Transfection is actually dumber than previous vaccines, because previous vaccines, if they were applied to the skin, almost make sense.

44:48.313 --> 44:51.075
Some of them do, depending on how they're produced.

44:51.516 --> 45:03.184
Most of them don't, because they have all kinds of other shit in them, and because they're not put in a place where you could, in theory, augment the cartoon of the immune system as best we understand it.

45:03.985 --> 45:06.327
Intramuscular injection is the opposite of that.

45:07.932 --> 45:10.873
And his job is to make sure that you never get to that point.

45:10.933 --> 45:16.915
But you're considering an endless list of potential possibilities, one of which is changing genes.

45:17.275 --> 45:17.795
Come on.

45:18.835 --> 45:19.356
Come on.

45:20.316 --> 45:26.018
What that tells you is that the toll receptors that are typically looking for these things are going to be confused by it.

45:26.138 --> 45:27.878
The enzymes that like to destroy these things.

45:27.978 --> 45:28.939
Confused?

45:29.299 --> 45:32.540
Is that really the word that you should use as a biologist?

45:33.430 --> 45:36.892
Confused, the toll-like receptors are gonna be confused.

45:37.432 --> 45:38.153
Stop lying!

45:38.653 --> 45:41.014
This is just, it's just so much bullshit.

45:41.355 --> 45:42.595
Things are gonna be confused by it.

45:43.776 --> 45:47.618
The RIG-1 is one and MD5 is another one that look for these things to try to destroy them.

45:48.078 --> 45:51.420
List a couple things that don't matter to confuse the guy even more.

45:51.460 --> 46:01.066
You're still not really explaining the biology and you're still not really being honest because if you were being honest, of course, it's just murder and lies and you're in charge of it.

46:02.324 --> 46:07.650
It's certainly going to present a different response to how your immune system looks at this.

46:07.730 --> 46:09.752
It might be one reason why it's evading everything.

46:10.293 --> 46:16.280
Some of the papers suggest that the toll receptor activity changes when you throw in this N1 methyl pseudouridine.

46:16.440 --> 46:23.327
And we are seeing all these papers that imply that our immune system has somewhat been silenced after vaccination.

46:24.348 --> 46:33.831
And it makes me wonder if that's because as long as this mRNA is floating around, that some of your immune cells are being trained to think that's nothing to worry about.

46:34.411 --> 46:42.054
We've also- So now the immune system is responding to the mRNA that's just hanging around apparently intracellularly or extracellularly?

46:42.094 --> 46:43.494
Where is the mRNA hanging out?

46:43.954 --> 46:47.195
Is it inside of the lipid nanoparticles still or it already came out?

46:48.375 --> 46:49.856
The hell is he talking about?

46:52.415 --> 46:57.866
Again, he's just adding layer after layer after layer of complexity and it's mostly bullshit.

47:00.003 --> 47:15.594
seen this with this IGG4 class shift that goes on where if you keep repeating- The IGG4 class shift is something that so many of these clowns parroted at the time and repeated and then now it's coming back again in his presentation.

47:15.694 --> 47:15.974
Why?

47:16.034 --> 47:17.515
Because it's all his script.

47:17.915 --> 47:25.801
Him and Robert Malone are the only two guys that have enough requisite knowledge to have created this elaborate bullshit script that all these people are on.

47:26.461 --> 47:34.027
exposing someone to the same antigen, your body just starts to think, all right, maybe that's an allergen or that's something that I have to tone my immune system down.

47:34.047 --> 47:36.349
So the next time the virus gets in, it goes rampant on you.

47:37.069 --> 47:40.472
And the people end up having worse results over time if they do, if they repeat this.

47:40.552 --> 47:47.697
I don't have a firm answer on what it does other than I read enough of the literature to know that the monkeying was something somewhat haphazardly here.

47:48.157 --> 47:51.340
I'm sorry, but on Twitter, he has repeatedly

47:52.280 --> 47:54.922
lambasted me for using the word transfection.

47:54.942 --> 48:02.186
He even posted a post with another anonymous account saying, he's so special for using the word transfection.

48:02.606 --> 48:03.907
I was doing transfection.

48:05.568 --> 48:12.612
I was doing transfection in 1998 with Sabatini, says Mr. Kevin McKernan.

48:13.544 --> 48:28.328
but he's calling it a vaccine now in 2024 and still calling it a vaccine in 2025, even though he knows it's a transfection and most of this crap was expected outcomes, likely outcomes in the human population.

48:28.488 --> 48:32.209
Duh, we've been doing it in mice and monkeys for decades.

48:34.768 --> 48:38.171
There's a lot of biology tied in around these methylated bases.

48:38.491 --> 48:45.697
And just flooding the cells with 100% swap of these things, we're in uncharted territory there.

48:45.717 --> 48:47.158
100% swap of these things?

48:47.218 --> 48:48.939
It's only a few RNAs.

48:50.300 --> 48:51.241
You see the magic?

48:51.501 --> 48:53.643
Your cells are full of RNA.

48:54.023 --> 49:00.529
They're doing all kinds of things, maintaining things, all things that we don't understand in irreducible complexity.

49:01.365 --> 49:09.188
And part of that symphony is an ever-ending regulation of RNA transcripts being made, being degraded, la, la, la, la, la.

49:09.528 --> 49:15.450
And then we put a little nanoparticle in there, and all of a sudden, all that RNA's messed up.

49:15.490 --> 49:17.451
Now we got all this pseudo-uridine here.

49:17.491 --> 49:19.011
We're never gonna make anything again.

49:19.911 --> 49:20.632
Stop lying!

49:20.992 --> 49:23.273
It's just so absurd.

49:24.813 --> 49:26.073
It's so absurd.

49:26.093 --> 49:26.133
It...

49:28.044 --> 49:31.145
It borders on really like, you know, come on guys.

49:31.825 --> 49:35.866
I kind of feel like, you know, somebody else should be able to see this besides me.

49:36.867 --> 49:44.669
The only way it's not possible is if every single person on social media that has any reach at all is there by design.

49:47.247 --> 50:02.332
So can, could it, the DNA plasmids, I guess their fraction, or like pieces of them, either those or the mRNA, could they be taken up by bacteria in the body, and could those bacteria, pump out spike protein, more easily.

50:02.793 --> 50:07.474
Could there be a retro integration or whatever event, more easily in the bacteria versus in our own cells.

50:07.894 --> 50:08.495
Just talk about that.

50:09.575 --> 50:12.857
If they were fully intact, perhaps that's a risk.

50:12.897 --> 50:16.199
I don't know that they'll actually express spike protein, but let me walk you through this.

50:16.239 --> 50:20.141
So the lots that we sequence are not notorious lots.

50:20.181 --> 50:24.103
We've looked them up in like how bad is my lot, and they don't seem to have a tremendous number of adverse events.

50:24.123 --> 50:26.364
With the exception of the monovalence, I think Sasha

50:26.584 --> 50:33.226
How bad is our lot is, of course, Sasha Latupova and this Craig Partacoper from the UK.

50:33.266 --> 50:37.807
And now he's going to cite Sasha as having said that these are pretty normal batches.

50:38.247 --> 50:40.568
You know, according to her data, she's pretty smart.

50:40.628 --> 50:44.349
They had found some data in California that suggested they had some elevated adverse response.

50:44.389 --> 50:51.571
But if there are vaccine lots out there that have a bigger DNAase problem, then we don't seem to have a tremendous number of adverse events.

50:51.591 --> 50:55.392
With the exception of the monovalence, I think Sasha had found some data in California that

50:55.452 --> 50:57.533
So Sasha's kind of like JJ, I guess.

50:57.553 --> 50:59.374
You don't even have to say her last name anymore.

50:59.394 --> 51:03.017
You just say JJ, you just say Sasha, and everybody knows who you're talking about.

51:03.437 --> 51:04.177
That's kind of cool.

51:04.338 --> 51:06.479
Suggested they had some elevated adverse response.

51:06.519 --> 51:16.865
But if there are vaccine lots out there that have a bigger DNAase problem than we've seen, and less fragmented, and there's some full-length plasmids in there, those could get into bacteria.

51:17.045 --> 51:20.568
E. coli prefers having circular DNA to heat shock it.

51:21.368 --> 51:22.148
You don't need much heat.

51:22.209 --> 51:25.010
You can get these plasmids into E. coli at 37C.

51:25.530 --> 51:29.613
If you have a slight fever at 38 or 39, that will heat shock into bacteria.

51:30.073 --> 51:42.380
And so what he's saying is that the plasmid, if it was just loose and running around, if it's the circular plasmid and you had a fever, then it could go into the bacteria really easy.

51:44.841 --> 51:45.741
Heat shock it in.

51:46.282 --> 51:48.042
That's how we put it into the bacteria.

51:48.062 --> 51:48.803
We just heat shock.

51:48.823 --> 51:53.765
So if your gut's hot enough, then it'll just go into your gut bacteria because that's the way it works.

51:55.686 --> 51:57.427
That's how transfection would work then.

51:57.487 --> 51:59.268
That's how transformation would work then.

51:59.328 --> 52:00.988
That's how a phage would get through.

52:01.829 --> 52:06.771
And since phages are really good at moving through mucus, then it would be pretty easy for them to do it.

52:09.192 --> 52:37.769
And so all of this story about viruses that infect you, all this story about gain of function viruses being made and released and spilled and traveling around the world just has to absolutely positively ignore all the bacteria and all the phages that are actually the foundation of that genetic background that supposedly these geniuses are pulling a high fidelity signal called SARS-CoV-2 from the background with

52:39.290 --> 52:40.251
99 primer pairs.

52:44.675 --> 52:51.981
Or 106, depending on which test you use, which sequencing set you use.

52:52.101 --> 52:56.225
106 primer pairs to sequence the whole SARS-CoV-2.

52:56.645 --> 53:05.713
And it just pulls this signal away from a background that's irreducibly complex, built of bacterial DNA and RNA and bacterial

53:06.448 --> 53:08.509
phages, DNA and RNA.

53:09.810 --> 53:10.130
Yeah.

53:10.370 --> 53:10.750
Okay.

53:11.030 --> 53:11.770
So here we go.

53:12.091 --> 53:16.593
There's an origin of replication for bacteria on the plasmid that would copy it in a, in a, in a bacteria.

53:17.453 --> 53:19.694
Again, we're talking about very rare events here, but.

53:20.094 --> 53:20.975
SV40.

53:21.055 --> 53:25.797
So he's seeding that narrative right now in the middle of 2024 so that he's ready to do it.

53:25.837 --> 53:30.259
He already started in January of that year, right in front of the Senate talking about this shit.

53:30.339 --> 53:33.780
Let's say there's billions of these molecules around and one of them can do this.

53:33.961 --> 53:42.984
Once it gets into an E. coli cell, if that patient is on antibiotics, that E. coli cell is going to win because it has the selective advantage of staying alive in the presence of antibiotics.

53:43.365 --> 53:50.388
And so now it's an added selected method because not only do you have to get transfected, but then the DNA has to get down in your gut.

53:50.428 --> 53:52.028
Then you have to have a fever.

53:52.408 --> 53:55.370
Then it's going to go into the DNA, the bacteria, and then

53:56.030 --> 54:07.274
And then the presence of antibiotics is going to select for that bacteria because it got the plasmid and the plasmid gives it resistance to antibiotics.

54:07.354 --> 54:13.376
And then magically, your entire microbiome will be transformed into antibiotic-resistant bacteria, I guess.

54:13.876 --> 54:16.037
So you need a couple of lightning strikes for this to happen, right?

54:16.077 --> 54:18.578
You have to have a plasmid around that's fully intact.

54:18.718 --> 54:20.018
You have to get it into a coli.

54:20.038 --> 54:21.579
Just take the one.

54:22.219 --> 54:22.760
Just one.

54:23.380 --> 54:28.706
And if you're patients on antibiotics, like anything that's just one, it's a lot like the prion, right?

54:29.207 --> 54:32.971
Right, Kevin McCarron, just one molecule, it's all it takes and you're done.

54:34.278 --> 54:38.079
an aminoglycoside, then that bacteria is gonna probably take off.

54:38.159 --> 54:52.081
Now, it turns out the vaccine plasmid that's in there doesn't have a COSAC, or I should say, it has a COSAC consensus sequence, which is what is needed for ribosomes to turn this thing into protease in mammalian cells.

54:52.181 --> 54:53.841
It doesn't have the one that bacteria have.

54:53.861 --> 55:01.683
So I think the bacteria would make the RNA, but the RNA wouldn't get turned into protein because it's lacking the right translational signals for that.

55:03.184 --> 55:11.450
Additionally, there is a pathway known as bactofection, where mammalian cells engulf bacteria and eat them, and all of their guts spill out.

55:11.510 --> 55:16.374
And, well, OK, then the third lightning strike, maybe you could get something, a spike protein made.

55:16.414 --> 55:21.117
But we're in this series of three lightning strike events for that to actually happen.

55:21.137 --> 55:24.620
So I think that's probably unlikely and very rare, although

55:26.212 --> 55:30.553
that we're dealing with big numbers, billions of people with billions of these molecules as contaminants.

55:31.114 --> 55:33.494
So could it be happening in one of them?

55:33.735 --> 55:36.656
Billions of people with billions of contaminants.

55:36.996 --> 55:38.716
And so no placebo at all.

55:39.296 --> 55:51.100
The how's your batch data monitored by Sasha is perfectly legit shit, according to the human genome project director, our research and development director.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.401
It's really remarkable.

55:53.061 --> 55:56.402
He is promoting Sasha Latupova, the mother of Soph.

55:58.483 --> 56:02.265
Of the people out there, I don't know.

56:02.285 --> 56:08.507
I know that got a lot of fanfare early on, because when we first sequenced these, we didn't respect how fragmented they were.

56:08.547 --> 56:11.048
We got a full assembly of a plasmid.

56:11.868 --> 56:16.230
And we looked in the sequencing to see paradigm reads that went around the whole circle.

56:16.270 --> 56:19.071
So we assumed that it was full length and intact.

56:19.591 --> 56:23.436
And then the more and more work we did chipping away at this, we realized, now wait a minute, they are in fact fragmented.

56:24.097 --> 56:29.584
And that means there's less likely for the, there's less likely that the full plasmid is going to remain intact.

56:29.704 --> 56:33.489
Wait, you had to work hard to figure out it wasn't just one big plasmid?

56:34.875 --> 56:41.399
That seems pretty remarkable coming from the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project in 2024.

56:42.339 --> 56:46.682
You had to work hard to figure out that there wasn't just one contiguous molecule.

56:47.102 --> 56:55.867
I thought you could just put this shit through a microarray or through a microfluidics or a nanopore sequencing and you get the whole thing right done.

56:58.271 --> 57:01.513
all these stories about how easy it is to do this shit.

57:01.553 --> 57:02.534
And then they did it.

57:02.574 --> 57:05.696
And at first they thought it would, they just assumed that it was the whole plasmid.

57:06.016 --> 57:08.618
But after a lot more work, we figured out that it wasn't.

57:11.079 --> 57:12.000
It's such a joke.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.082
Are you going to sequence some bad batches?

57:16.022 --> 57:17.283
If people can get them to us, we'll do it.

57:17.383 --> 57:17.823
I don't know.

57:17.884 --> 57:18.804
That's the biggest challenge.

57:18.864 --> 57:22.286
Are you going to sequence some of those bad batches that Sasha Latupova found?

57:23.931 --> 57:27.573
which is people having them still maintained and sending them to us.

57:27.613 --> 57:37.257
And right now we've been focusing more on getting other people the capacity to replicate this because enough eggs have been thrown at us thinking that we're like manufacturing all this.

57:38.558 --> 57:45.221
So what we did, and after we sequenced this, we realized this probably won't get reproduced for some time because sequencing these things is more expensive.

57:45.761 --> 57:50.923
So we designed- I thought sequencing was getting so cheap you could do a whole genome for $3,000.

57:52.924 --> 57:56.806
We're talking about what is going, what is he talking about?

57:57.947 --> 58:03.550
How expensive could it be to sequence a pure sample of an RNA in a vial?

58:03.570 --> 58:10.094
Monetated PCR assays and then put those assays public because that can be done for 10 bucks in an hour.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.355
It's very fast and easy.

58:11.375 --> 58:18.819
And there's PCR machines all over the world right now for the COVID PCR pipeline that's been in place and is now a lot of them are actually quite idle.

58:19.662 --> 58:23.123
But by doing that, it enabled a lot of other labs to pick this up and test it.

58:23.143 --> 58:29.164
We had a lab yesterday report some results down in South Carolina where they had access, they got access to a thousand vials from their clinic.

58:29.845 --> 58:34.006
And they just started the process of quantitative PCR using the primers we sent them.

58:34.306 --> 58:35.986
So they send you the primers.

58:36.826 --> 58:39.507
You have to trust that those primers are the primers they get.

58:39.947 --> 58:42.388
They don't let you order the primers?

58:50.183 --> 58:52.184
and they're getting similar CT scores across.

58:52.204 --> 58:53.245
These are CT scores.

58:53.305 --> 58:54.125
Well, no shit.

58:54.425 --> 58:57.947
If you send them all the reagents, no kidding.

58:58.287 --> 58:58.608
Really?

58:58.908 --> 59:03.530
If you send them the microwave popcorn and they follow the directions, they also get popcorn?

59:03.970 --> 59:04.451
Wow.

59:08.021 --> 59:09.522
in the 18 range.

59:10.202 --> 59:18.067
For those not familiar with PCR, during the pandemic, they would probably quarantine you for a CT score of maybe 38.

59:18.467 --> 59:22.189
A CT score of 38 on what protein, Kevin?

59:23.890 --> 59:25.631
Using what controls, Kevin?

59:29.354 --> 59:31.595
And what was the actual amplicon, Kevin?

59:33.629 --> 59:35.470
You know, let's just make sure that's clear.

59:35.490 --> 59:39.232
If you wanted to find this book right here, this is a really weird book, right?

59:40.172 --> 59:45.635
You wanted to find this book and you use primers to find it to say that this book is on my bookshelf.

59:45.695 --> 59:46.635
Look, let's do that.

59:46.695 --> 59:47.236
Let's do that.

59:47.336 --> 59:48.136
Let's go over here.

59:48.156 --> 59:50.237
Oops, not over there.

59:50.677 --> 59:51.338
Let's go over here.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.999
So this book on my bookshelf.

59:55.039 --> 59:56.000
So we'll put it in like this.

59:58.223 --> 01:00:00.144
Now we can screen for two things here, right?

01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:03.526
We could screen for the phrase once upon a time.

01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:10.730
And if we find it and it amplifies rather quickly, then we can say, well, then for sure it's in there.

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:20.375
Or we could screen for some, something like a,

01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:28.652
In 2072, aliens attacked Earth.

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:29.053
Oh, no.

01:00:29.153 --> 01:00:32.154
Our peaceful society seemed unprepared, but not the Zephyr.

01:00:33.795 --> 01:00:38.537
That's one of the first sentences in the beginning of this target.

01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:41.278
And the amplicon would just be page one.

01:00:42.499 --> 01:00:49.622
And if we find page one, then we can reasonably assume that this comic book is on my bookshelf.

01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:55.345
Now, would it be better to use welcome to the future, the very first words on this thing?

01:00:56.907 --> 01:01:07.850
Um, would it be very, would it be look for more information about characters in our story or, um, our peaceful society seemed unprepared, but not the Zephyr.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.431
Most people think he's just a blue costume crime fighter, but he's a been a surprising help.

01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:22.033
If we use primers to find that sentence, I'm pretty confident that those primers would not find any of those books on the shelf.

01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:31.713
But if we used the primers that would find the sentence, welcome to the future, the primers would be welcome and future.

01:01:31.773 --> 01:01:35.741
And there might be lots of sentences over here that would give you a false positive.

01:01:39.409 --> 01:01:55.354
If I wanted to select another paragraph from here, I could select paragraphs that would, you know, be good and paragraphs that wouldn't be very good because they would be specific for this book because they would use terms and combinations of words that were very specific to this story.

01:01:56.095 --> 01:01:59.516
Or I could choose sentences that didn't do that.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.857
Like, they reduced water pollution.

01:02:04.673 --> 01:02:11.359
If I chose that, then you could imagine they reduced water pollution as a sentence that could resemble a sentence in a lot of those books.

01:02:14.882 --> 01:02:18.746
But not if I use a sentence where Jotifari have always lived beneath our oceans.

01:02:18.786 --> 01:02:23.730
They can slowly breathe oxygen, but they have wet gills, webbed feet, and a gracefully strong tail.

01:02:26.393 --> 01:02:28.534
And so when he says that people were

01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:32.295
Oops, I probably have to do that again and then that again.

01:02:32.475 --> 01:02:50.029
If he says that people are, are 38, cycle 38 positive, but doesn't tell you what, what proteins he's talking about, then he's absolutely positively admitting what I've been arguing for the last four years.

01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:57.855
The PCR test is just misconstruing an irreducibly complex background into a high fidelity signal, which it is not.

01:02:58.703 --> 01:03:10.019
And one of his primary jobs over the course of the pandemic was to make sure that that narrative about PCR being a useful diagnostic was never usefully questioned.

01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:15.186
And make no mistake about it, usefully questioning it is not challenging the cycle count.

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:18.598
That's a bullshit hamster wheel.

01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:41.129
Neither live nor dead is a narrative that he told me in my live stream a couple weeks before Rixie came to my house.

01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:52.731
That there are viral technologies called live dead technologies that could be combined with PCR so that we wouldn't be, you know, getting a bunch of false positives with people that don't have any live virus.

01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:57.592
And in 2024, three years later, he's going to say the same bullshit line again.

01:03:59.173 --> 01:04:00.893
is that's outside your mucosal barrier.

01:04:00.914 --> 01:04:01.634
That's not a big deal.

01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:02.694
It could be dead virus.

01:04:02.934 --> 01:04:07.615
But now we're talking about a DNA contaminant that shouldn't be there, but it's being directly injected to you.

01:04:07.715 --> 01:04:12.417
And it's a million fold higher concentration than what they're quarantining you for the virus.

01:04:12.857 --> 01:04:16.158
There's a huge difference here in terms of the scale of what's going on.

01:04:16.258 --> 01:04:21.159
There's a tremendous amount, a million, one to two million molecules per microliter probably.

01:04:21.499 --> 01:04:27.201
So there's so much more in an injection than there is when you're infected by the virus.

01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:28.241
Imagine that.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.212
That's no big deal to him.

01:04:31.232 --> 01:04:32.413
It's okay.

01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:34.394
It must be crazy then, right?

01:04:34.434 --> 01:04:43.340
Because if the virus can kill people with a fraction of, you know, orders of magnitude less signal, it can kill people.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:52.225
And it's the most contagious virus ever because of four amino acids called a fear and cleavage site or 19.

01:04:54.767 --> 01:04:55.548
in these vaccines.

01:04:56.068 --> 01:04:59.031
Now, could that vary another hundredfold, another lot?

01:04:59.051 --> 01:04:59.832
Yeah, it probably can.

01:04:59.872 --> 01:05:11.904
The lowest CT score we saw was when I think Simon Godek and Dr. Randall Baugh came to our- Simon Godek is a paid ex-account.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.165
that works with these guys and has worked with them so long that he blocked me last year.

01:05:18.365 --> 01:05:20.787
Simon Godek, the guy with the beer glass.

01:05:21.328 --> 01:05:23.330
That guy is faker than a box of rocks.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.093
He's just like the vigilant fox.

01:05:26.793 --> 01:05:29.196
It's the same malevolent show.

01:05:30.856 --> 01:05:34.137
lab and I had them set up the PCR and the vaccine vials.

01:05:34.157 --> 01:05:39.559
We picked one of the vials out of a pack that we have and they were getting numbers in the 15 to 16 range.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.620
So there are some vials out there that vary.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.002
Another, what is that, two to three CTs, it's almost tenfold more in some of the vials.

01:05:48.062 --> 01:05:51.183
We do need to survey other lots, particularly the lots that have adverse events.

01:05:51.263 --> 01:05:55.345
Maybe this is because they have either more endotoxin or more plasma DNA and

01:05:55.905 --> 01:05:58.006
they're resulting in more anaphylaxis.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:07.052
More and more complicated, more and more complicated when it's intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a healthy human is dumb.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:09.214
Dumb as a box of rocks.

01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:10.875
Another thrombolytic type of activity.

01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:16.683
Okay, I have hopefully one more kind of like question slash subject.

01:06:16.903 --> 01:06:18.084
Listen carefully.

01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:28.189
And I would actually love to have somebody really well versed in this debate, somebody else who's on the other side of this, which is do viruses exist?

01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:29.650
So I think viruses exist.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:34.433
It just seems to make sense from my lived experience that this is a story that makes sense.

01:06:34.493 --> 01:06:36.854
And I studied a little bit about viruses in med school.

01:06:37.274 --> 01:06:38.035
All that being said,

01:06:38.835 --> 01:06:48.563
I still don't know enough to like if I go down the rabbit or start going down the rabbit hole of all these blogs and stuff and people writing about all the reasons why they think viruses don't exist.

01:06:49.163 --> 01:06:54.847
I'm not really equipped to argue against them I like I don't understand the flaws in their reasoning or the holes in their arguments right.

01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:57.249
Could you maybe give a

01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:02.998
Steel man, the viruses don't exist argument, if possible.

01:07:03.058 --> 01:07:04.278
Yeah, I'll do my best.

01:07:04.918 --> 01:07:07.318
They may critique me as not doing them fair justice.

01:07:08.479 --> 01:07:10.979
So I think there's a couple of different themes here.

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:14.480
There's the folks who say coronavirus pandemic didn't exist.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.081
And that doesn't mean that there isn't an RNA that's traveling the globe causing some sickness.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:22.741
A lot of people will point to Denny's work and be like, look, no virus was here.

01:07:22.782 --> 01:07:24.682
It was all government-made death.

01:07:25.882 --> 01:07:32.405
But I think as a physician and myself having actually been sick with this and seen it go through my household, there is some kind of RNA that can hop person to person.

01:07:34.066 --> 01:07:38.227
And that we can sequence in every person and it tracks with some level of disease.

01:07:39.428 --> 01:07:46.971
I think there's really fair debates on the side that some of the terrain and no virus folks will bring up that not everyone gets sick with this thing.

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:53.614
You have people out there that don't get sick from this RNA being around, therefore you have not fulfilled Koch's postulate because you should have everyone get sick.

01:07:54.674 --> 01:08:02.261
I can see that being a some people are better vitamin D, whatever, they're younger, they're not as at risk, so they manage the virus and get rid of it without any concern.

01:08:02.301 --> 01:08:10.769
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:08:16.255 --> 01:08:24.319
And just like that, just like that, Kevin McKernan addressed everything that I've been saying for the last three years in one little statement.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:25.460
There is an RNA.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.922
You can sequence it and you can put it places and it does stuff.

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:44.380
All of these people were put in place to make sure that any damage from transfection could be blamed on the virus and the spike protein because this is a continuation of the Human Genome Project.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.423
It is the next phase of the Human Genome Project where a

01:08:49.324 --> 01:08:56.552
A remnant stream of PCR testing is used to sample from everyone and anyone they can as often as possible.

01:08:57.092 --> 01:09:07.123
One of the best things they did in 2020 and 21 was sample repeatedly from all the young college kids in America that we didn't have the wherewithal to keep home for a couple years.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:09.779
And that was by design.

01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:27.726
That was one of the main reasons why these people had to be out there to make sure that there was enough confusion and frustration and doubt that those kids would go back to college and be at the willy nilly, you know, at the mercy of those horrible places and test repeatedly.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:34.649
And Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone did shit all about it.

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:36.390
They made it happen.

01:09:39.434 --> 01:09:43.075
That's the reason why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:09:43.175 --> 01:09:47.016
It is a recycling of a fake anti-vax movement in the UK.

01:09:48.136 --> 01:09:52.297
It is a recycling of a fake anti-vax movement in the UK.

01:09:53.197 --> 01:09:57.398
And they stood in front of Brandy Vaughn the same way they're standing in front of me now.

01:09:58.118 --> 01:10:05.460
The only question is, I guess, and it's going to be in 9-11-2025 when I finally put a shotgun in my mouth, according to Kevin McCarran.

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:09.474
This history is real, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:09.974 --> 01:10:14.378
That's the reason why Suzanne Humphreys is in front of us and on Joe Rogan in the last month.

01:10:15.759 --> 01:10:29.751
Because our consciousness is their prime real estate and they put these liars in place of people like Brandy Vaughn and myself, in place of people like Mark Kulak who are trying to characterize and cover this.

01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:31.212
Yeah, very much so.

01:10:31.873 --> 01:10:32.213
I see.

01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:33.715
So yeah, so let's just jump right in.

01:10:34.588 --> 01:10:38.190
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.

01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:54.420
I wanted to start with an episode of interview you did a couple of weeks ago on The High Wire with Del Bigtree, in which you gave, you used science and facts to make a strong case that the coronavirus was lab created, not a naturally occurring organic permutation of a prior virus.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.663
But your stance and position seems to have changed a little bit after that.

01:11:00.063 --> 01:11:02.625
Can you just explain, you know, what new facts have you learned?

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.733
what has changed since then?

01:11:05.654 --> 01:11:05.894
Sure.

01:11:05.974 --> 01:11:10.016
So the public needs to understand the difference between laboratory origin and man-made, right?

01:11:10.097 --> 01:11:23.785
So the question of where this virus came from was supposed to be answerable by looking at the sequences, the genetic sequences.

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:32.651
And in the original publication, there was a missing, there was a segment of the genome that

01:11:32.932 --> 01:11:36.435
that the original authors couldn't seem to place.

01:11:37.055 --> 01:11:37.695
They didn't know.

01:11:37.816 --> 01:11:39.056
Did he say genome?

01:11:40.758 --> 01:11:42.359
Did he really say genome?

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:45.601
Like these people are actors.

01:11:45.921 --> 01:11:46.622
Where it came from.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:54.628
And a second peer review publication also could not find a match to any known sequences.

01:11:55.588 --> 01:11:56.629
And this was strange.

01:11:59.271 --> 01:12:01.853
So they called it the middle fragment.

01:12:03.428 --> 01:12:12.910
So my analysis of the middle fragment was a careful analysis and it led to the discovery that this middle fragment matched what was called P-shuttle SN.

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:21.892
P-shuttle SN is a vector technology, it turns out, that was derived from a P-shuttle vector that was created in 1998.

01:12:22.413 --> 01:12:30.834
The P-shuttle SN was the only match that I could find this to, along with some spike proteins, but it was 67% or so similar.

01:12:34.278 --> 01:12:59.500
given all the data that we had at the time, it seemed like we had found something of a match between a vector technology and the... A vector technology, meaning it was a commercially derived sequence, which I guess could be used in bacterial culture and the manufacture of biologics.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.062
The novel coronavirus, you know,

01:13:02.734 --> 01:13:03.134
fragment.

01:13:03.514 --> 01:13:08.035
It seemed almost as if there was a leftover piece of the vector technology.

01:13:08.935 --> 01:13:16.077
So moving forward then, as science does, the question is, how do we test this hypothesis?

01:13:17.077 --> 01:13:29.820
And the way you test a hypothesis is to try to design a critical test that if the critical test fails, then we can falsify

01:13:30.436 --> 01:13:34.339
hypothesis and say that we have not corroborated the hypothesis.

01:13:34.679 --> 01:13:41.985
So to take this approach to science then, I had to think about the best way that we could really truly critically test this.

01:13:42.065 --> 01:13:47.289
And phylogenetics is a useful tool that I can make the prediction.

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:58.557
If given all the coronavirus spike proteins that we have data for in the database, if P shuttle is most closely related to

01:13:59.724 --> 01:14:02.866
the SARS-CoV-19 coronavirus.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:08.568
SARS-CoV-19, COVID, you know, the way that Robert Malone pronounced it.

01:14:08.588 --> 01:14:10.069
This is all a script.

01:14:10.829 --> 01:14:18.573
This guy was scripted at the beginning of the pandemic because he is part of this fake anti-vax movement and was part of it back when Brandy Vaughn was still alive.

01:14:20.554 --> 01:14:25.977
And here he is on a Chinese, American-based Chinese podcast

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:33.070
Yeah, talking about his recent interview with Del Bigtree in February of 2020.

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:41.732
Then we can say, yes, there seems to be a strong link.

01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:55.756
Or if this P Shuttle SN clusters with other kinds of coronaviruses more strongly, then that would tell us, well, this is probably not related.

01:14:56.505 --> 01:15:03.209
And so to the person first time in the chat, Jay, why would they create the pandemic to get lots of genetic samples from college kids?

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.730
Why not just offer them $50 a week for nose swabs?

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.791
Many of them would take them up on that.

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:09.112
That is absolutely true.

01:15:09.752 --> 01:15:12.554
But this is a many layered plan.

01:15:12.594 --> 01:15:15.896
It's a, you know, how many birds with this stone can we get?

01:15:16.576 --> 01:15:21.480
And I haven't even dropped the biggest bomb yet that I think I kind of, I think it's real.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.443
I think it's actually, it's just been one malevolent show since Obama.

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:31.847
It's just been one malevolent show since H.W.

01:15:31.907 --> 01:15:38.932
Bush, since George Bush, since Bill Clinton, since Barack Obama, since Trump, since Biden, since Trump.

01:15:39.052 --> 01:15:39.973
It's all the same show.

01:15:41.488 --> 01:15:49.274
And the engagement in the idea that Trump is an outsider is exactly the trap that they have put conservative America in.

01:15:52.457 --> 01:15:54.399
Because they don't like conservative America.

01:15:54.459 --> 01:15:58.002
Conservative America has higher powers that they answer to.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:13.799
Conservatives all over the world have higher powers that they answer to, higher moral standards that they hold themselves to, a higher level of responsibility for their own actions and their own lives are taken by people on the conservative side.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:17.480
So all of these people of our ruling class hate us.

01:16:20.282 --> 01:16:27.746
And so they have put in place a fake anti-vax movement that is part of a left-wing democratic

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.721
Nonsense movement.

01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:33.723
It's not a real conservative movement.

01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:36.306
And they're all laughing because they're all on the same team.

01:16:38.168 --> 01:16:45.196
Bill and Hillary Clinton are on the same team as Donald Trump, as Obama and Biden, as Bannon.

01:16:46.497 --> 01:16:47.258
They're all the same.

01:16:48.527 --> 01:17:00.737
And they think that it's really funny that we engage in this elaborate theater, that we really think that Donald Trump is coming to our rescue as he does nothing, nothing that would signal that.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:13.067
And it's, if you see it as one contiguous track record, it's really almost remarkable what they've been able to accomplish from Biden to Trump.

01:17:13.747 --> 01:17:15.589
I mean, sorry, from Obama to Trump.

01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:17.010
It's remarkable.

01:17:19.187 --> 01:17:34.353
I undertook that analysis and I found that the P-Shuttle SN actually clustered with the SARS coronavirus cluster that was related to a genomics project, I think at Guangdong, as well as a cancer center project.

01:17:35.334 --> 01:17:41.396
And it seems as though it was either used there or it was derived from them.

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:48.799
And so we can rule out that P-Shuttle SN was involved in the development of

01:17:49.804 --> 01:17:51.485
SARS-CoV-19.

01:17:52.986 --> 01:17:57.808
But it doesn't rule out other vectors as potentially being used.

01:17:58.208 --> 01:18:01.169
And so I made sure to include all the other artifacts.

01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:08.393
I mean, I don't even know if I answered your question, to be honest, because I think the reason why they didn't pay college kids is because this is about their kids.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:14.814
So the idea is that the kids that went to college during the coronavirus are going to have kids.

01:18:15.395 --> 01:18:18.257
If they went to college during the pandemic, they're going to have kids.

01:18:18.317 --> 01:18:20.780
And the ones that do have kids have to be 100%

01:18:23.643 --> 01:18:31.905
for this idea that medicine needs to genetic screening like what Kevin McKernan said in that video in 2017.

01:18:32.386 --> 01:18:47.190
The future of medicine is requiring on a trial by trial basis that everybody be genetically screened and that you only look at a genetically homogenous subset of people so that you at least understand a little more about how your drug works.

01:18:49.131 --> 01:18:50.671
Official spike proteins.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:19:06.966
that I had the data for, and none of them clustered with SARS-CoV-19, which means that none of the data that we have right now supports a vector origin of the virus.

01:19:10.129 --> 01:19:12.471
Okay.

01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:18.336
Now, something happened along the way that I think is a very lucky

01:19:19.894 --> 01:19:29.500
set of circumstances, because this analysis exonerates any of the published sequences as being a source that were in the lab.

01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:34.464
It doesn't mean that it didn't come from an accidental laboratory release of a natural virus.

01:19:34.524 --> 01:19:35.824
It doesn't mean that it did.

01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:42.529
What it means is that we can say that there doesn't seem to be a fingerprint of mankind on this virus at this time.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.752
Then we undertook a further analysis to see, okay,

01:19:48.766 --> 01:20:01.630
Is there a characteristic signature in the functional motifs of the protein, the spike protein, in SARS coronavirus 19?

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:17.335
And if there is a difference in the functional motif patterns in SARS coronavirus 19, are there any other sequences in the databases that we have that have that functional motif pattern?

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:21.921
And that functional motif pattern may well be a signature of pathogenicity.

01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:38.066
And so having noticed that the SARS-CoV-19 motif pattern at the protein analysis level was different than SARS, it gave us what could be a signature of pathogenicity.

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:45.608
And so we downloaded all of the protein sequences for a spike protein to try to see

01:20:46.252 --> 01:20:48.052
if in fact there was any kind of a match.

01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:55.034
Now this work is under peer review and I have permission from the journal that's reviewing it to publish the paper.

01:20:55.054 --> 01:21:00.595
I've submitted the paper to an archive to see if they'll publish it ahead of peer review.

01:21:05.476 --> 01:21:11.838
What we found was really exciting because some Chinese scientists way back in 2005

01:21:13.695 --> 01:21:17.837
actually published a study of three sequences from coronavirus.

01:21:19.038 --> 01:21:24.561
And scientists at North Carolina University in the United States downloaded

01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:28.633
those sequences along with a fourth sequence.

01:21:28.713 --> 01:21:29.694
So really weird, right?

01:21:29.734 --> 01:21:30.835
Then they can build it.

01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:39.481
And now you see the James Lyons Weiler is seeding in the early 2020, the narrative that the United States is responsible for it.

01:21:39.521 --> 01:21:41.923
And lo and behold, in 2025, here we are.

01:21:42.403 --> 01:21:44.125
China says it's us.

01:21:44.645 --> 01:21:46.246
China says it was Fort Detrick.

01:21:47.427 --> 01:21:50.449
Kim Iverson is doing coverage of a Fort Detrick leak.

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:52.091
I guess it could be America.

01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:54.853
Maybe we'll have to burn the whole place down after all.

01:21:55.333 --> 01:22:06.725
Maybe the rest of the world should just consider America a lost cause after all, and we can reorganize it under a global governance system where we share all the data across borders.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:13.812
And you don't believe me, I'm sure.

01:22:14.914 --> 01:22:16.856
Most people don't, but it's the truth.

01:22:18.155 --> 01:22:25.499
And if you like what you see and you think this needs to be supported, please go to gigahomebiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:29.441
We really do need help right now.

01:22:29.521 --> 01:22:31.943
We have the lowest number of subscribers we've ever had.

01:22:33.264 --> 01:22:39.727
And some people can't, the people that have been supporting the stream can't support us forever the way they have.

01:22:40.368 --> 01:22:42.269
And so we either need new people to step up

01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:46.531
and start, you know, supporting in a pretty significant way.

01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:50.654
Or we need a lot more little subscribers, which I would much rather have.

01:22:50.734 --> 01:22:54.497
So if you're not there yet, please go to GigaOM Biological and find a way.

01:22:54.517 --> 01:23:06.425
I just got word that my gym is going to be open today, that they have power.

01:23:07.392 --> 01:23:10.494
and the owner of the gym just shared with me that.

01:23:11.715 --> 01:23:16.739
I think I'm going to cut it short here, although I have a whole nother video coming.

01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:19.241
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

01:23:19.281 --> 01:23:21.162
I'm the chief biologist at Gingo Home Biological.

01:23:21.182 --> 01:23:25.065
I come to you live every day, Monday through Friday, somewhere between 10 a.m.

01:23:25.105 --> 01:23:25.565
Eastern and 12 p.m.

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:25.906
Eastern.

01:23:28.327 --> 01:23:30.428
That's a two hour window, although it doesn't sound like it.

01:23:31.628 --> 01:23:33.388
And I hope you'll join me tomorrow.

01:23:34.469 --> 01:23:45.531
I presented to Panda before, but actually most of my work is now being misrepresented and diluted on a sub stack called, let me blank that out, Woodhouse 76.

01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:46.831
You can see that up there.

01:23:47.292 --> 01:23:53.313
Actually, Jessica Hockett and Mike Eden just collaborated on a vaccine related project.

01:23:53.893 --> 01:24:01.317
Don't know article that can't really say it as succinctly as we say it here, but that's okay because that's their job They're supposed to argue with Claire Craig.

01:24:01.337 --> 01:24:18.307
They're supposed to argue with Pierre Corey They're supposed to absorb my ideas and dilute them and then make it seem like it's their own they're even supposed to absorb my friendships, you know, and she pretends like Jay Bhattacharya is blocking me and I should be having a conversation with him because I'm a really important wife of a restaurateur in Chicago

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:25.393
Anyway, Jay Bhattacharya is my buddy and he's not talking to me because he's on script.

01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:32.237
Robert Malone was a former, sorry, I said Robert Malone because Robert Malone is standing behind that guy.

01:24:32.258 --> 01:24:36.681
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:36.741 --> 01:24:38.222
used to be my boss for like a year.

01:24:38.682 --> 01:24:54.086
Right after that, it was Brian Hooker and Mary Holland at the CHD, Children's Health Defense, that I now consider just to be a sabotaged organization, a fake anti-vax movement that perpetuated the mythology of autism long enough to get

01:24:54.566 --> 01:24:55.787
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:55.867 --> 01:25:01.249
somewhere close to power so that he could just be a part of this ridiculous show.

01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:13.795
That's the reason why this DNC former Obama administration employee and this DNC and the guy that went to the Clinton wedding

01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:17.769
is the president because it's all one show.

01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:19.750
Thank you very much for being here.

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:24.292
This is the High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:25:24.732 --> 01:25:30.095
I'm gonna play this out and I'm just gonna save what I had for tomorrow.

01:25:30.135 --> 01:25:31.655
I think that's the best way to do it.

01:25:32.496 --> 01:25:33.436
Don't be disappointed.

01:25:34.517 --> 01:25:38.378
I gotta go answer the mail and find Beaterhead.

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:40.199
There's Beaterhead.

01:25:40.339 --> 01:25:41.480
Thank you very much, guys.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.100
See you soon.

01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:49.073
I will be here tomorrow.

01:25:49.173 --> 01:25:50.093
I will be here all week.

01:25:50.633 --> 01:25:52.134
We're going to keep this streak going.

01:25:52.654 --> 01:25:54.696
I might not do all the weekends are hard.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.397
The weekends are hard.

01:25:57.517 --> 01:25:58.478
I don't know how to say it.

01:25:58.498 --> 01:26:02.400
I want to do weekends, but it's always it requires everybody in the house.

01:26:03.829 --> 01:26:15.092
It requires everybody in the house and mostly my wife to make a lot of sacrifices that when the kids are at school, or at least two of the three kids are at school, it's a little easier to make those adjustments, but on the weekend it's hard.

01:26:16.592 --> 01:26:23.994
We got three very active kids, two very active dogs, six very active chickens, and so the weekends are busy.

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:26.875
But thank you very much for being here.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:33.299
Again, I don't like begging, but if you can support the stream, please try and do it.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.721
There's going to be a lot more output.

01:26:35.761 --> 01:26:38.543
There's going to be a lot more deliverables coming very soon.

01:26:40.484 --> 01:26:47.589
It's just a question of time and trying to keep up with this flood of information and still try to expose it while it's visible.

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:50.972
I think that's really important to expose it while it's visible.

01:26:51.012 --> 01:26:54.074
Kevin McKernan is not always going to be dancing.

01:26:54.134 --> 01:27:08.024
If you search on PubMed, I'm sorry, on the internet right now, you just go on the internet and you go to YouTube and you search for Kevin McKernan, it is

01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:12.728
It is remarkable.

01:27:13.539 --> 01:27:13.899
Okay?

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:14.940
Remarkable.

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:19.764
Kevin McKernan is everywhere on the internet right now.

01:27:20.264 --> 01:27:21.605
And it's really, really bad.

01:27:22.245 --> 01:27:22.586
Okay?

01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:23.606
It's really, really bad.

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:30.211
Because him and Robert Malone are essentially the narrative curators behind all of these people.

01:27:30.992 --> 01:27:35.014
And it is the reason why Jay Bhattacharya is where he is.

01:27:35.074 --> 01:27:37.476
It's the reason why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:37.516 --> 01:27:38.117
is the way he is.

01:27:38.157 --> 01:27:40.258
And it's the reason why we're still injecting kids.

01:27:40.578 --> 01:27:41.219
Thank you very much.
