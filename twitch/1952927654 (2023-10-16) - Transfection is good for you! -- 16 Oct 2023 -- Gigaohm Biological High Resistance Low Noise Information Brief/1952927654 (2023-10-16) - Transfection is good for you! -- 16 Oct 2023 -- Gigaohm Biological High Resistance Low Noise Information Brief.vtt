Italian, Japanese television.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's embarrassing.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, I can't thank you kids enough.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Shaggy should get most of the credit.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Where is Shaggy?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, no, not again.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
It looks like Shaggy wants to try for the eight-man role in the picture.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Surprise!

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
But there's Scooby-Doo in the other chair.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Surprise!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
It's the Scooby hat the eight-man was wearing.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Now, there's real talent.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
We sure fooled him, Scooby.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
We ought to be in the movies.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Thank you.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
Good evening, good afternoon, good morning, good evening, good night.

From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, this is Giga on biological.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Ironically, it doesn't feel that much better today.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
It might sound a little better, but it's not really any better.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
The brick wall is a little more visible today than it was yesterday, though.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
That I know for sure.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
I hope another fish introduction is not too annoying for everybody.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
There was no spread in New York City that we can see.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Infectious clones are the only real dangerous form of RNA.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
placebo badges were distributed and transferred to healthy mammals as dope.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Protocols were murdered, gained in functions and mythology.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
The Scooby-Doo is real and you've been fooled to solving it because the players are committed to the lies.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Music

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
The question is whether Zappa was trying to save us or just doing what his dad's boss wanted him to do, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
That's the question.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I don't know, it's tough to say.

06:07.000 --> 06:19.000

Anyway, welcome. This is Giga on biological eye resistance.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Low noise information brief brought to you by a sore throat biologist.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
It's the 16th of October, 2023.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And it dawned on me.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
We had on the clips a couple days ago.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And I thought it would be kind of appropriate to discuss that

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
as a model of the Scooby-Doo.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
The bait on TV and social media is not that different than any clips, actually.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Really not that different at all because it involves so much.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Stop lying!

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
That's what it involves. It involves lying.

07:26.000 --> 07:44.000
Equipses and equinoxes and knowledge of where the sun would be when and where the moon would be when have been used to create mythologies to control people.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
People have been governed by these mythologies for millennia.

07:49.000 --> 08:01.000
And so it's not that strange for us to be in a situation where we are being governed by mythologies, by lies, by stories.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
We are inherently a storytelling species. It's how we communicate.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
And they have used this against us to tell us a story about a possible cover-up of a lab leak.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
And yet another book is coming out that talks about the cover-up of a lab leak.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
It's actually called the Great COVID cover-up.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
The author of it is one of the two primary performers in 2020.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Performing with Tony Fauci on Capitol Hill repeatedly.

08:36.000 --> 08:46.000
And I would argue that this was part of an elaborate hoax to get you to think that it was not only a mystery to be solved, but that you could see through it.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
That we could all see through the cover-up and we figured it out.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Obviously.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
And I think they did this with all of these people.

08:59.000 --> 09:11.000
Some of them were wittingly involved, none of them were unwittingly involved, misled by trusted sources who were involved.

09:11.000 --> 09:28.000
And that's why I thought it was really important to track down, I don't think I have this set up again, I had to track down all of the people that have been involved in this because most or all of them

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
seem to have some kind of conflict of interest.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
And that's a big problem.

09:38.000 --> 09:54.000
Just one second please, just let me get this in focus.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
That's why we've been working on this people map because we want to find out who's telling the truth and who isn't it, who's been recruited and who hasn't and how can we tell them apart.

10:04.000 --> 10:21.000
And I've come to the conclusion that we can tell them apart by this illusion of consensus about a novel virus, for which we had to do something which might have included repurposed drugs, it might have included Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, it might not have.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
It might have included lockdowns and masks depending on whose story you heard.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
But the illusion of consensus about a novel virus is unshakable.

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
The illusion of consensus that the world was in danger and that the world had to do something is unshakable.

10:42.000 --> 10:55.000
And for the most part, the idea that one of the things we had to do was come up with a vaccine and we did the best that we could with the mRNA's, not so much with the adenoviruses.

10:55.000 --> 11:06.000
And that after three years it's become obvious that America has been covering up their involvement in the likely lab leak that occurred in Wuhan of a gain of function virus.

11:06.000 --> 11:20.000
And that through this bamboo summit, through these people, we have been, we have fooled ourselves into believing that gain of function is the source of this pandemic and even if it wasn't, it will be the source of the next one.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
And solving that mystery has been characterized by me as a Scooby-Doo.

11:26.000 --> 11:40.000
Essentially because the Scooby-Doo cartoon involves teenagers solving a mystery where all they have to do is get up the courage to take the mask off of the monster and they will find an average guy who's a liar.

11:40.000 --> 11:50.000
An average guy who was in the case of the cartoon lying about being a monster in order to scare people away from his scam.

11:50.000 --> 11:58.000
And in this case we are being led to believe that if we unmask the monsters, we will solve this mystery.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
If we unmask the criminals, if we pursue putting people in jail, the right people to be put in jail will be put in jail.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
And so all we got to do is push and let these people are the greatest pushers over here.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
Boy, they're so good. They're such good fighters. All we got to do is send money to them.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Why would I do anything when I could just send my money to Steve Kirsch and let him fight?

12:21.000 --> 12:30.000
Why would I do anything myself when I could just subscribe as a paid subscriber to Robert Malone, along with his million other subscribers and hope that he can do it?

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
I mean, if Robert Malone, the inventor of RNA can't save us who can then, right?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
That's the illusion of consensus.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
There's nothing you can do. All the jobs are filled.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
The argument is taking place and the argument is taking place between people who know much more than you, so why even bother trying to contribute?

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
Grab a seat, grab a box of popcorn, and enjoy the ride.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
And so I've been trying to be as critical as possible as I move these pieces around the board.

13:04.000 --> 13:14.000
I also have myself my role in the assembly of this cluster. You know what?

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
On Thursday, I'm going to have Joseph Lee MD on my show again for the second time.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
That show will take place at 5 p.m. Eastern. It's a little earlier than normal right at the end of the work day.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
I hope you'll join us. I think it'll be a very vigorous conversation about the true biology that has been ignored.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
For the duration of the pandemic and a pretty good summary of what I think will be things that we can use.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
I had the Thanksgiving dinner table, et cetera.

13:46.000 --> 14:02.000
So in case you aren't aware, transfection is not immunization and any combination of substances injected intramuscularly with the intent of augmenting the immune system is also pretty crazy at this stage.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
So it's not a matter of what's true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And we have been victims of a spectacular commitment to lies.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
And what I'm suggesting to you is this show that has been going on for a very long time.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Much longer than the pandemic.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
This show is almost exclusively produced by lying.

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
You don't need a whole lot of real things and actually the less real things you have involved in the show.

14:34.000 --> 14:43.000
The harder it will be for the audience to see through it and to spot the scenery.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
Because the consistency will remain the same and it will be the consensus that that dupes them.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
The collective commitment of the cast is what makes a play successful.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
It's not the lights or the stage or even the scenery.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
Because in the end you walked in, you paid the ticket, you sat down in the chairs when the lights were still on and the curtain was still closed.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Then the light went off and the curtain opened.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
So if you are able to suspend your disbelief despite the fact that you know it's vague,

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
then the only conclusion to come to it is the commitment of the cast of the play.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
That's why actors get Tony's.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
That's why stage acting is such an art.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Because it is real communication.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
It's real reenactment of situations, of emotions that are real.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
This art has been developed over thousands of years.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Don't think for one second that everybody who appears to be authentic on television is indeed authentic.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Please.

15:53.000 --> 16:04.000
Don't fool yourself into believing that every influencer, every podcaster, because they seem authentic is authentic.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
There are tricks.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
So you may not remember this movie, you may not have seen it.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It's Apokolipto.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
It's not a lot of dialogue in the movie, so a lot of people didn't like it.

16:19.000 --> 16:33.000
What I found so interesting about this was, is that in Apokolipto, there's a scene where his tribe has been captured and they're being sacrificed serially from the top of a Mayan or Aztec pyramid.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I think it's a Mayan pyramid, but I don't know.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I apologize if I get it wrong.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
It's Mel Gibson movie, so it's probably culturally incorrect anyway, right?

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
So the point is, is an indigenous population in Central or Mexico, Central America or Mexico.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
And there are step pyramids, so it's supposed to be South America.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
And it's one tribe that was captured by a much larger tribe brought back to their city.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And they've been walked to the top of a pyramid to be sacrificed.

17:00.000 --> 17:13.000
But what happens is there is an eclipse happening, and the king and the queen and the witch doctors all know that the eclipse is coming today.

17:13.000 --> 17:29.000
And that's why they're sacrificing all these people today, until the start of the eclipse, and then they will scream to the god, come back, come back if we have sacrificed enough, come back, and then the sun will come back, and all the people will rejoice.

17:29.000 --> 17:40.000
And there will be a huge consensus made that everybody understands what just happened.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
We were all here.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
We saw it.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
We heard him say it.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Just like the consensus at the beginning of the pandemic, where we all heard it.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
We all saw it on TV.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
We all experienced the lockdown.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
We were all wearing masks.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I remember it too.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Don't you?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Everybody remembers it.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
So obviously there was a lot. I mean, obviously there was a virus circulating.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Otherwise, why in the world would we have stopped flying?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I flew.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
The planes were empty.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
It was crazy.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Watch carefully, because it's no different.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
So empty winded.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
So good.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
He took the seal.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Who bought the helmet?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Come on, get out of here.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Come on, get out of here.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Come on, get out of here.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Come on, get out of here.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Come on, get out of here.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Excited you, buddy.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Excited you, buddy.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
He checks again to see if the eclipse has started, and he notices that it has.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
And so he looks at the king, and he tells the king that they're about to do it.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
See this one? Yes.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Now this guy's going to go nuts.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
A little bit of shamanistic theater.

19:56.000 --> 20:26.000

20:26.000 --> 20:56.000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

20:56.000 --> 21:14.280
natural phenomenon go to waste never let a natural phenomenon go to waste perfect

21:14.280 --> 21:20.400
natural phenomenon is an eclipse if you can convince people that you know how

21:20.400 --> 21:27.760
to dispel an eclipse by sacrificing people all day and that the sun will

21:27.760 --> 21:36.600
come back and answer you you can create the illusion of consensus that's

21:36.600 --> 21:48.120
impossible to break and rule an entire civilization knowing one simple date

21:50.400 --> 22:02.720
one date that no one else knows how you know even the king doesn't know how he

22:02.720 --> 22:13.760
knew but it doesn't matter because the king rules based on his show is it any

22:13.760 --> 22:19.280
different for the rest of the rulers in the world if somebody came and told you

22:19.280 --> 22:28.360
that you're gonna be able to use a natural signal we're gonna use a natural

22:28.360 --> 22:37.000
signal to do this to the world and if you don't go along with it you'll be down

22:37.000 --> 22:41.680
there at the bottom instead of up here at the top with us you don't think that's

22:41.680 --> 22:53.080
possible I'm sure that's how it happened and it was with this an illusion of

22:53.080 --> 22:57.960
pandemic potential that could come out of laboratories an illusion of pandemic

22:57.960 --> 23:02.520
potential that could be accessed through cell culture animal passage and genetic

23:02.520 --> 23:13.320
manipulation and this modern form of an eclipse has been used to bamboozled

23:13.320 --> 23:18.800
governments and bureaucracies around the world as well as the citizens that they

23:18.800 --> 23:25.560
govern into believing this pandemic potential is real however rare it is in

23:25.560 --> 23:33.240
badcaves it's a lot less rarer in laboratories and therefore they are

23:33.240 --> 23:38.680
going to invert the way that our kids think about sovereignty

23:41.480 --> 23:48.080
if you were going on a winter road trip you'd pack warm clothes charge your phone

23:48.080 --> 23:53.400
and ensure your car had the right tires being prepared can protect you from

23:53.400 --> 23:59.680
troubles ahead so you can be safe your health deserves the same attention this

23:59.680 --> 24:05.840
winter it's likely that influenza COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses will be

24:05.840 --> 24:11.400
circulating at the same time but you can protect yourself if you're offered an

24:11.400 --> 24:17.160
influenza vaccine and a COVID vaccine or booster you should take it especially

24:17.160 --> 24:21.560
if you're an older person a pregnant woman or having underlying health

24:21.560 --> 24:26.920
conditions or if you're a health worker vaccines remain your best

24:26.920 --> 24:33.360
defense they can help prevent severe illness and save your life in addition

24:33.360 --> 24:37.880
you can protect yourself and your loved ones by constantly assessing your risk

24:37.880 --> 24:42.640
of being exposed to viruses and practicing measures such as hand washing

24:42.640 --> 24:48.280
sons by constantly assessing your risk of being exposed to viruses seeing your

24:48.280 --> 24:52.920
risk of being ex constantly assessing your ones by constantly assessing your

24:52.920 --> 24:56.920
risk of being exposed to viruses

24:56.920 --> 25:04.040
vaccines are that's extraordinary don't you think by constantly assessing your

25:04.040 --> 25:10.040
risks to viruses in addition you can protect yourself and your loved ones by

25:10.040 --> 25:14.960
constantly assessing your risk of being exposed to viruses and practicing

25:14.960 --> 25:19.760
measures such as hand washing sneezing into your elbow ventilating in

25:19.760 --> 25:23.960
clothes this is the European commercial distancing or wearing a mask sent to me

25:23.960 --> 25:30.840
by someone in all good preparation is key to prevention so get vaccinated now

25:30.840 --> 25:36.480
and continue to protect yourself and others for a healthier winter and enjoy

25:36.480 --> 25:39.640
life's adventures

25:40.400 --> 25:52.600
it's not stopping sorry try this one this is a really nice one I think vaccines

25:52.600 --> 26:00.880
are about to change the world vaccines are about to change the world again for

26:00.880 --> 26:05.600
generations vaccines have helped us live longer safer lives protecting us from

26:05.600 --> 26:12.160
smallpox, polio, measles, and other devastating diseases now a new type of

26:12.160 --> 26:17.640
vaccine can make even more diseases from HIV to coronaviruses a thing of the

26:17.640 --> 26:19.600
past

26:19.600 --> 26:24.800
mRNA is gonna get rid of age two vaccines usually work like this a tiny part of a

26:24.800 --> 26:29.600
virus called an antigen is injected into your body it's not enough to make you

26:29.600 --> 26:34.800
sick but it's just enough to make your immune system notice your immune system

26:34.800 --> 26:39.280
then creates antibodies, soldier cells that are trained to fight a particular

26:39.280 --> 26:44.520
antigen once this happens your body will remember how to quickly produce more

26:44.520 --> 26:49.800
antibodies if so if you're ever exposed to the real virus your body will already

26:49.800 --> 26:55.320
know exactly how to defend itself but what if you could skip that part and just

26:55.320 --> 26:59.600
train your immune system to make antibodies for specific diseases that's

26:59.600 --> 27:06.480
what mRNA vaccines do mRNA stands for messenger how did it skip any genetic

27:06.480 --> 27:11.480
code that tells ourselves what to do like make new proteins or repair damage

27:11.480 --> 27:19.240
mRNA is naturally found in all of ourselves but in 2005 so mRNA tells cells

27:19.240 --> 27:24.840
to make proteins and to repair damage and so we can use mRNA to make proteins

27:24.840 --> 27:31.320
and repair damage this is University of Penn where they came from these two

27:31.320 --> 27:37.760
careco and and Wiseman and this is the kind of cartoon crap that they've been

27:37.760 --> 27:41.600
shoving down my parents neck for three years and my brother's neck for three

27:41.600 --> 27:47.640
years and all of the teachers at the school that my kids go to for the last

27:48.640 --> 27:58.240
three years complete BS biology made dumb simple and they just said that it

27:58.240 --> 28:05.320
was gonna kill or cure HIV and coronavirus they did devastating diseases all

28:05.320 --> 28:10.680
around the world are cured by vaccines every year

28:10.760 --> 28:18.000
that's what mRNA vaccines do mRNA stands for messenger RNA it's a piece of

28:18.000 --> 28:23.040
genetic code that tells ourselves what to do like make new proteins or repair

28:23.040 --> 28:29.300
damage mRNA is naturally found in all of ourselves but in 2005 infectious

28:29.300 --> 28:34.120
disease experts at Penn Medicine discovered how to modify mRNA to safely

28:34.120 --> 28:39.360
make ourselves create protein similar to those found in some viruses once those

28:39.360 --> 28:44.040
proteins are made our immune systems can then create antibodies for that virus

28:44.040 --> 28:49.720
today the same technology is being used by scientists around the world to

28:49.720 --> 28:54.560
develop vaccines for all kinds of diseases including coronaviruses that

28:54.560 --> 29:01.120
can cause future pandemics researchers at Penn Medicine are developing mRNA

29:01.120 --> 29:07.080
vaccines for diseases like herpes HIV sickle cell anemia and even cancer and

29:07.080 --> 29:11.960
as we continue to push for new breakthroughs in mRNA technology we're

29:11.960 --> 29:18.000
paving the way for a safer healthier future for all of us

29:19.640 --> 29:24.840
why should you find that scary well one of the things that I haven't talked

29:24.840 --> 29:28.400
about yet that people have been testing me about for a while that they're right

29:28.400 --> 29:36.600
about but it gets more complicated comes back to the objection and observation

29:36.600 --> 29:43.800
that doctor sorry not doctor but Kevin McKernan made on my stream a couple times

29:43.800 --> 29:49.960
in 2021 or 2022 when he came on my stream both of the times he came on my

29:49.960 --> 29:55.240
stream to talk about how the RNA itself it was supposedly packaged in the shot

29:55.240 --> 30:03.840
was impure and that actually the RNA was full of fragments and rather than a

30:03.840 --> 30:09.200
nice tight band at a certain weight of the spike protein RNA was a smear all

30:09.200 --> 30:14.680
the way up so are all the way down so lots of tiny fragments of mRNA from the

30:14.680 --> 30:20.200
spike apparently but they didn't sequence them all because they couldn't do that

30:20.200 --> 30:26.520
there's a trouble with small RNA molecules small RNA molecules can

30:26.520 --> 30:33.280
interfere with other RNA molecules because if they have a mology they can

30:33.280 --> 30:39.360
bind to one another not so dissimilar to how two strands of DNA can get a

30:39.360 --> 30:43.760
needle two strands of RNA with overlapping reflective sequences can

30:43.760 --> 30:48.280
and kneel together and that can cause their degradation because double

30:48.280 --> 30:53.920
stranded RNA is intolerated so one of the ways that neuroscientists and

30:53.920 --> 31:00.560
physiologists around the world have found to perturb systems on the bench is to

31:00.600 --> 31:09.400
inject small interfering RNAs with the intention of creating short strands of

31:09.400 --> 31:14.360
double stranded RNA related to a protein that they would like to knock down and

31:14.360 --> 31:19.040
then the mRNA for that proteins expression will be degraded because the

31:19.040 --> 31:23.080
double stranded RNA will be degraded and therefore the messenger RNA will be

31:23.080 --> 31:29.360
destroyed so in these shots which Kevin McCurnan came on my stream two years ago

31:29.360 --> 31:36.240
to show us with the mRNA was impure any endogenous transcripts which are

31:36.240 --> 31:44.560
expressing mRNA which have some overlap or homology with the RNA

31:44.560 --> 31:51.240
fragments which are found in the LNP's could have the effect of being a short

31:51.240 --> 31:56.800
interference RNA binding to endogenous RNAs and causing their premature

31:56.800 --> 32:02.560
degradation changing the way that they would be expressed and their

32:02.560 --> 32:08.000
regulation who knows how long this would last who knows how long it would occur

32:08.000 --> 32:11.480
who knows how often it would occur with all the pseudo uridine substitutions

32:11.480 --> 32:17.360
that are in there so this is something that I haven't talked about but I've been

32:17.360 --> 32:20.360
asked to talk about a couple times it's definitely something to be concerned

32:20.360 --> 32:25.600
about but it's one of these things that it's a compounding set of variables that

32:25.640 --> 32:30.680
doesn't just add another few possibilities it adds a whole another layer of

32:30.680 --> 32:37.960
complexity to the problem but small interfering RNAs are real and the RNA

32:37.960 --> 32:44.480
contamination in the mRNA shots which as I said was discussed multiple times on

32:44.480 --> 32:51.600
my stream by myself and particular on my stream with Kevin McCurnan as

32:51.680 --> 32:56.640
potential for interference with endogenous RNAs and that potential can't

32:56.640 --> 33:01.080
really be adequately assessed without sequencing all those small RNAs and

33:01.080 --> 33:05.160
finding out what they are should they be derived from the spike then we're

33:05.160 --> 33:11.360
still looking for short homologies in the spike sequence with endogenous

33:11.360 --> 33:17.280
transcripts which we know already from Dolores Cahill and others analysis that

33:17.280 --> 33:22.520
there's a lot of mimicry there with regard to proteins so the only question

33:22.520 --> 33:27.920
is whether there's mRNA overlap there from the codon optimizing and from the

33:27.920 --> 33:32.960
pseudo uridine chemical substitutions that would lead to that hybridization

33:32.960 --> 33:39.200
and destruction of endogenous transcripts I'll explain that in some in some

33:39.200 --> 33:47.280
coming stream hi everyone it's Mandy Cohen CDC Director and I am here at Morris

33:47.280 --> 33:52.080
Brown College I'm here with the president Dr. James and I'm here with a great

33:52.080 --> 33:56.560
partner of ours from the conference of national black churches this is Jackie

33:56.560 --> 34:02.000
Burton and she's amazing and they have been working with the CDC on vaccinations

34:02.000 --> 34:06.600
throughout the pandemic they've done more than a million COVID vaccines and I

34:06.600 --> 34:10.200
can't tell you how important a partnership with our historically black

34:10.200 --> 34:14.200
colleges and partnerships with our black churches around the country has been I

34:14.200 --> 34:17.400
just wanted you guys to get a chance to meet them so why didn't I turn it over

34:17.400 --> 34:21.420
to Dr. James first and then I'd love to hear from Jackie as well sure my name is

34:21.420 --> 34:25.600
Kevin James I'm honored to serve as a president of Morris Brown College HBCU

34:25.600 --> 34:30.840
founded in 1881 142 years ago we are related to partner with you all today

34:30.840 --> 34:34.280
to provide this service to our community continue to watch Morris Brown

34:34.280 --> 34:37.480
College as we continue to expand what we're doing here that will be called

34:37.480 --> 34:41.960
the hard reset welcome thank you all right and Dr. Burton tell us about your

34:41.960 --> 34:46.440
just a legend so did you say the hard reset tell me about the work tell us

34:46.440 --> 34:50.680
about your just there will be called the hard reset welcome thank you all right

34:50.680 --> 34:56.120
and Dr. Burton tell us about your just a legend so first thank you all but tell

34:56.120 --> 35:00.200
me about the work that you've been doing vaccinating the community great the

35:00.200 --> 35:06.680
CDC contacted us at at the CNBC the conference of national black churches

35:06.680 --> 35:11.160
when the pandemic first started and said can you help us get the word into the

35:11.160 --> 35:15.560
african-american community well of course we can black churches or the center of

35:15.560 --> 35:18.280
our communities this is from yesterday and it is

35:18.280 --> 35:22.520
work they have I won't give you the number but multi millions of dollars

35:22.520 --> 35:28.280
since 2020 and we are delighted we're a third year of funding and looking

35:28.280 --> 35:32.520
toward the fourth year but it is a made made a difference our churches

35:32.520 --> 35:35.800
through our sixth largest historically black denominations

35:35.800 --> 35:39.800
have worked very hard and that's how we ended up with this

35:39.800 --> 35:43.880
over a million vaccines through our churches through community centers

35:43.880 --> 35:48.040
nursing homes even some hospitals but it has made a difference

35:48.040 --> 35:53.240
we could not have done this unless CDC believed in us well we love that

35:53.240 --> 35:57.080
partnership and we've been talking a lot about building trust and so

35:57.080 --> 36:00.840
making sure that we have access points for folks can get the vaccine close to

36:00.840 --> 36:04.280
their community as well as from people that they trust

36:04.280 --> 36:08.840
and hear from folks that they trust so we are grateful again to be here

36:08.840 --> 36:12.680
at historically black universities and to partner with

36:12.680 --> 36:16.280
our black churches make sure you're going out and protecting yourself get

36:16.280 --> 36:23.320
vaccinated today covid flu and RSV covid flu and RSV

36:23.320 --> 36:30.440
holy crap going through the black churches

36:31.240 --> 36:34.760
giving them millions of dollars

36:38.280 --> 36:41.640
i feel an obligation to get in touch with those people and try to change their

36:41.640 --> 36:47.000
minds but i don't got millions of dollars

36:47.000 --> 36:56.120
i'm speechless this is from today this is

36:56.120 --> 37:00.680
christian jorston the guy who came up with the pcr test at the beginning of the

37:00.680 --> 37:06.520
pandemic for the who and it got reviewed and published in less than 24 hours

37:06.520 --> 37:09.720
and then about two weeks later kevin mccurnan and

37:09.720 --> 37:13.080
peter mcculler and a couple other people came out

37:13.080 --> 37:18.200
mike eden maybe or maybe not peter mcculler maybe it was mike eden

37:18.200 --> 37:22.520
who came out against the pcr test but not against the pcr as a diagnostic

37:22.520 --> 37:29.000
against the primers that the who used so kevin mccurnan has been

37:29.000 --> 37:31.720
an operator since the very beginning of the pandemic

37:31.720 --> 37:35.160
and i don't mean that in necessarily a great way

37:35.160 --> 37:38.760
he has been helping to control the narrative and control

37:38.840 --> 37:42.760
dissident people for quite some time

37:42.760 --> 37:48.200
and linking him so early with a couple people like mike eden is really

37:48.200 --> 37:53.560
unfortunate but it also shows the consistency of his presence

37:53.560 --> 37:57.720
listen to what christians got to say here and then the other issue as

37:57.720 --> 38:02.200
as we are with the virus is communication and disinformation

38:02.200 --> 38:05.960
and this is such a complex issue there are many media people here who exactly

38:05.960 --> 38:09.160
know what i'm speaking about

38:09.160 --> 38:13.080
this is really the intervention in the beginning of a pandemic

38:13.080 --> 38:16.520
so there are two interventions that are really efficient before we have

38:16.520 --> 38:20.440
a drug or vaccine this is diagnostic testing

38:20.440 --> 38:25.080
and then it's political decision making and once this political decision making

38:25.080 --> 38:29.400
is influenced and contorted by disinformation and propaganda

38:29.400 --> 38:34.920
we are lost and there are rules that are not being fulfilled

38:34.920 --> 38:39.160
by the media themselves they really have to look in the mirror

38:39.160 --> 38:43.080
and there is another role that some sometimes

38:43.080 --> 38:46.840
ignored a little bit which is the role of science itself

38:46.840 --> 38:51.320
so we shouldn't have anybody who has some academic degree

38:51.320 --> 38:56.040
talking about the heart of the issue in the middle of a pandemic we

38:56.040 --> 38:59.560
have to address the institutions of science to make

38:59.560 --> 39:03.560
some selection to set up panels of experts who are really experts

39:03.560 --> 39:07.160
and who wouldn't push into the media but who are

39:07.160 --> 39:12.760
somehow qualified to summarize the state of knowledge

39:12.760 --> 39:16.840
and this can only happen via the institutions of science these

39:16.840 --> 39:21.480
institutions have to offer this function to society

39:21.480 --> 39:27.480
and these institutions of science they are actually consisting of scientists

39:27.480 --> 39:32.920
of top scientists and it's really about being a little bit less

39:32.920 --> 39:36.840
opportunistic as a scientist being a little bit

39:36.840 --> 39:42.840
more of service to society that's my wow

39:42.840 --> 39:46.040
that is amazing

39:47.560 --> 39:51.960
he's just said that we can't just have everybody with a little bit of

39:51.960 --> 39:57.400
expertise talking about the pandemic during a pandemic

39:57.400 --> 40:01.640
and that academic institutions have to play a role in controlling this

40:01.640 --> 40:08.200
in the selection he's describing a technocracy

40:08.200 --> 40:13.320
he's describing an ivory tower wherein the the priests of the ivory tower choose

40:13.320 --> 40:18.600
their representatives who go to the top of the pyramid and

40:18.600 --> 40:25.000
tell us when the eclipse is going to come and what the eclipse means

40:25.160 --> 40:30.600
and whose heads are going to roll down the stairs of the pyramid

40:30.600 --> 40:35.800
because misinformation and disinformation once they get a hold

40:35.800 --> 40:41.160
then everything is lost and so the most important thing at the beginning of

40:41.160 --> 40:47.240
the pandemic is to control the information says the German

40:47.240 --> 40:50.360
the German liar

40:50.920 --> 41:01.720
this is about the use of an eclipse to control the world

41:01.720 --> 41:10.680
we have been told that an RNA molecule can circle the globe like a brush fire

41:10.680 --> 41:19.400
and endanger economies and cultures and generations of people

41:20.360 --> 41:24.280
that's no different than being led to believe that a a morning of human

41:24.280 --> 41:28.200
sacrifice can make sure that an eclipse only

41:28.200 --> 41:32.440
lasts six minutes instead of 60 years

41:34.680 --> 41:39.400
this is precisely what has happened to us

41:39.400 --> 41:44.680
and this what you see here is spectacular commitment to that lie

41:44.680 --> 41:49.000
spectacular commitment to what the eclipse means

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
and spectacular commitment to why the eclipse went away and it's all lies

41:55.000 --> 41:59.880
it's all lies

42:19.000 --> 42:21.080
you

42:49.000 --> 42:51.080
you

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
you

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
you

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
you

44:49.880 --> 44:51.880
you

45:02.280 --> 45:07.320
it just makes it seem like it's just different sides fighting all the time

45:07.320 --> 45:11.800
but at certain moment it stopped being that right it kind of became something

45:11.800 --> 45:18.280
different and i don't know really what it is i don't know i don't

45:18.280 --> 45:22.280
i don't tend to want to care too much either because

45:22.280 --> 45:26.520
there are so many more people with skin in the game than me

45:26.520 --> 45:29.800
and gaza has a border with egypt

45:29.800 --> 45:35.640
and it's just way too complicated for me to wade into a history

45:35.640 --> 45:41.160
that even with a phd level of study i probably couldn't still claim to be an

45:41.160 --> 45:43.560
expert

45:44.120 --> 45:50.440
and this video kind of belittles the more recent history of the land

45:50.440 --> 45:55.720
by equating it with the ancient history of the land

45:55.720 --> 46:01.160
as if it's just always been fighting and it's always been kind of fair

46:01.160 --> 46:04.360
because everybody can kill everybody

46:04.360 --> 46:08.440
and i i'm not really sure that it's always been fair and i i've heard a lot of

46:08.440 --> 46:11.080
people argue otherwise a lot of smart people argue

46:11.080 --> 46:16.040
otherwise from presidents to diplomats to

46:16.040 --> 46:19.080
academic thinkers

46:19.640 --> 46:23.720
and yet suddenly the whole theater has started again and it's a theater just

46:23.720 --> 46:27.240
like any other of this theater where

46:27.240 --> 46:31.640
extreme views that can't possibly be correct

46:31.640 --> 46:34.760
are the only ones that are really offered up

46:34.760 --> 46:39.720
as alternatives to choose from

46:39.720 --> 46:42.520
so i'm going to let it play out but i just want you to know that i'm not playing

46:42.520 --> 46:45.000
it because i think it's a great video like that

46:45.000 --> 46:49.240
adequately describes the history i'm going to play a second video after this

46:49.240 --> 46:54.360
that i think is more important to hear because it's a message from someone with

46:54.360 --> 46:57.800
more skin in the game than me

46:57.800 --> 47:03.240
um i'm going to escape this here i'm going to find that video for you now

47:03.240 --> 47:08.440
because it didn't want to play in powerpoint which was kind of annoying

47:08.440 --> 47:24.360
i think it'll play when i just play it outside of powerpoint

47:31.960 --> 47:34.280
what

47:34.360 --> 47:38.440
oh man it's not translating so i got to go get it off of youtube sorry about

47:38.440 --> 47:42.920
this i apologize this is me not having a team

47:42.920 --> 47:46.680
this is me not having a team

47:48.040 --> 47:53.480
let's see i want to

47:54.120 --> 47:57.720
come on joker joker

48:02.680 --> 48:04.200
yes here we go

48:11.800 --> 48:15.000
i'm taking my self off screen because i really this is about gabor

48:18.600 --> 48:23.000
this is one of the issues that's closest to my heart and it has been for a long

48:23.000 --> 48:28.360
time so you know my history i don't know to repeat it but i'm a i'm personally a

48:28.360 --> 48:34.200
holocaust survivor as an infant um i barely survived

48:34.200 --> 48:38.040
my my grandparents were killed in Auschwitz

48:38.040 --> 48:43.560
and most of my extended family was killed um that's my personal background

48:43.560 --> 48:49.160
i grew up ashamed of my Jewishness in uh in Hungary

48:49.160 --> 48:52.600
after the war i was still bullied for being Jewish

48:52.600 --> 48:56.520
and i remember one of my friends coming to my rescue once

48:56.520 --> 49:00.120
saying leave him alone is not his fault that he's Jewish

49:00.120 --> 49:04.440
it's a fault but it's not his fault this was the defense

49:04.440 --> 49:10.280
so i grew up with that in my teenage years in canada i became a Zionist

49:10.280 --> 49:15.800
this dream of the Jewish people resurrected in their

49:15.800 --> 49:21.320
historical homeland and the barbed wire of Auschwitz being replaced by the

49:21.320 --> 49:26.120
boundaries of a of a Jewish state with a powerful army

49:26.120 --> 49:32.840
i i funded liberating it was exhilarating to believe in that dream

49:32.840 --> 49:37.240
and i absorbed all the all that perspective all that point of view and

49:37.240 --> 49:43.320
i really believed in it and then i found out that it wasn't exactly like that

49:43.320 --> 49:47.960
that in order to make this Jewish dream a reality we had to visit a nightmare

49:47.960 --> 49:54.840
on the local population you couldn't there was a Zionist slogan called

49:56.040 --> 50:00.040
a land without a people for a people without a land

50:00.040 --> 50:04.040
but there was no people but there was no land without a people

50:04.040 --> 50:07.560
there was people living there who'd been living there

50:07.560 --> 50:14.520
for hundreds and years or even longer as a matter of fact

50:14.520 --> 50:18.440
do you want to hear something really interesting and david bongoyon was the

50:18.440 --> 50:23.000
first prime minister of isro actually subscribed to this he said this

50:23.000 --> 50:29.080
who are the Palestinians because the jews

50:29.080 --> 50:32.840
in uh roman times never all all of them never left

50:32.840 --> 50:37.960
Palestine many of them stayed there and some of them hundreds of

50:37.960 --> 50:43.320
leaders converted to islam so guess what the Palestinians are

50:43.320 --> 50:47.800
in some way there might be descendants of ancient jews

50:47.800 --> 50:52.120
there are cousins to say the least no matter you look at it

50:52.120 --> 50:55.560
and you know in there's no way you could have ever created

50:55.640 --> 51:04.840
a Jewish state without oppressing and expelling the local

51:04.840 --> 51:11.240
population which is what they did in 1947 beginning in 1947

51:11.240 --> 51:15.640
and first of all the british empire protection

51:15.640 --> 51:19.240
you know but they did this and then in 1948

51:19.240 --> 51:24.120
Israeli historians Israeli historians Jewish Israeli historians

51:24.120 --> 51:28.120
have shown without a doubt that the explosion of the Palestinians was

51:28.120 --> 51:32.040
persistent it was pervasive it was cruel

51:32.040 --> 51:37.560
it was murderous and with deliberate attempt

51:37.560 --> 51:44.280
so that's what's called the nakpa in arabic the disaster or the catastrophe

51:44.280 --> 51:50.360
now in isro now in canada there's a law that you cannot deny the holocaust

51:50.360 --> 51:55.160
i don't believe in such laws by the way but in isro you're not allowed to mention

51:55.160 --> 51:58.680
the nakpa even though it was at the very basis of the

51:58.680 --> 52:05.240
foundation of the state so once i became aware of all this

52:05.240 --> 52:11.320
i was okay well yeah we created this beautiful dream

52:11.320 --> 52:14.840
but we imposed a nightmare on somebody else

52:14.840 --> 52:17.800
and then i visited the occupied territories

52:17.800 --> 52:22.120
russell during the first end of fire

52:22.600 --> 52:25.880
i cried every day for two weeks and what i saw

52:25.880 --> 52:31.080
the brutality the occupation the petty harassment

52:31.080 --> 52:38.200
the murderousness of it the burning down of al-

52:38.200 --> 52:43.240
the palestinian or cutting down of palestina all of groves

52:43.240 --> 52:49.000
the denial of water rights the humiliations

52:49.240 --> 52:53.720
and this went on and it's much worse now than it was then

52:53.720 --> 53:00.200
so this is the background and it couldn't have been in any other way

53:00.200 --> 53:04.760
because again you couldn't have created that exclusive jewish state

53:04.760 --> 53:07.720
without oppressing or explaining the local population

53:07.720 --> 53:12.360
it's the longest ethnic cleansing operation

53:12.360 --> 53:16.840
in the 20th and 21st centuries it's still going on

53:16.840 --> 53:19.880
and who are these people in gaza now you have to go to gaza

53:19.880 --> 53:24.040
you have to go there to really appreciate it it's a small area

53:24.040 --> 53:27.480
where there are these multiple hundreds of thousands of people

53:27.480 --> 53:32.520
who are those people the direct children or grandchildren of the people

53:32.520 --> 53:37.240
that are expressed from isro or what is not isro now here's the outrage

53:37.240 --> 53:41.160
and i'd like to use iron's friend in the states to tell me this

53:41.160 --> 53:44.040
i as a jew

53:44.760 --> 53:49.800
i could land in Tel Aviv tomorrow and demand citizenship

53:49.800 --> 53:53.320
under the right law of the writer return

53:53.320 --> 53:56.840
but my palestinian friend in Vancouver, Panakawas,

53:56.840 --> 54:00.360
who was born in jewish so on can't even visit

54:00.360 --> 54:04.440
so what stands as a note so who is gaza this desperate

54:04.440 --> 54:10.040
blockaded uh let me stop again am i talking too

54:10.040 --> 54:13.720
long about this i'm sorry i just this is so important to me and i know so much

54:13.720 --> 54:16.360
about it that i i don't even know where to stop

54:16.360 --> 54:20.040
so then you have these miserable people packed into this horrible

54:20.040 --> 54:24.680
people call it the world's largest outdoor prison which is what it is

54:24.680 --> 54:29.320
incredible poverty 50 unemployment

54:29.320 --> 54:34.920
from us is an islamic organization that was originally

54:34.920 --> 54:38.600
encouraged by isro and supported by isro is a

54:38.600 --> 54:43.960
counterweight to the secular palestinian liberation organization

54:43.960 --> 54:47.560
which is what i didn't want to deal with

54:48.520 --> 54:54.040
and given those conditions of course people will go for extremist leadership

54:54.040 --> 54:57.080
that's what people do when they're miserable and hopeless

54:57.080 --> 55:02.920
deprived of any possibly whatsoever you don't have to support hamas policies

55:02.920 --> 55:06.360
to stand up for palestinian rights but that's a complete

55:06.360 --> 55:10.840
falsity but there were free elections in gaza

55:10.840 --> 55:16.040
monitored by international community they were declared to be the

55:16.040 --> 55:19.560
freest elections ever held in the in the air world

55:19.560 --> 55:25.160
and hamas happened to win and when happened hamas won that election

55:25.160 --> 55:28.840
israel united states immediately organized their military coup against

55:28.840 --> 55:34.520
them which hamas defeated for which the punishment was

55:34.520 --> 55:39.640
this blockade that deprives hamas of not hamas but gaza

55:39.640 --> 55:45.240
of food of medical supplies of sufficient water

55:45.240 --> 55:51.960
i could go on and on and on and then you have this conflict

55:51.960 --> 55:56.120
and then every time there's a conflict israel

55:56.120 --> 55:59.160
moves the lawn that's the expression they use you know what they call it

55:59.160 --> 56:02.040
they call it mowing the lawn by which they mean

56:02.040 --> 56:05.320
the mass murder of palestinian civilians

56:05.320 --> 56:10.040
now is it true that that doesn't shoot rockets into israel

56:10.040 --> 56:15.320
killing innocent civilians yes it is do i support that

56:15.320 --> 56:20.200
no i don't but when it comes to the death of innocent

56:20.200 --> 56:24.280
civilians israel killed 20 000 lebanese civilians

56:24.280 --> 56:28.440
in 1982 using illegal weapons like cluster bombs

56:28.440 --> 56:32.360
in the war that ignores justification whatsoever

56:32.360 --> 56:37.000
i could go on and on and on and on except i'll say that

56:37.000 --> 56:41.560
the disproportionate power and responsibility and oppression

56:41.560 --> 56:46.520
is so markedly on one side that you think the worst thing you can say about

56:46.520 --> 56:51.000
hamas multiplied by a thousand times

56:51.000 --> 56:55.480
and it still will not meet the israeli repression and killing

56:55.480 --> 57:00.360
and this possession of palestinians if we can

57:00.360 --> 57:04.680
if after two thousand years we can look for liberation and freedom

57:04.680 --> 57:10.920
why can't the palestinians if you look at the western press

57:10.920 --> 57:16.040
when hong kong demonstrators throw stones at the police in hong kong

57:16.040 --> 57:20.280
that's considered to be heroism in the american press

57:20.280 --> 57:24.360
when in me and mar the demonstrators throw

57:24.360 --> 57:27.800
slingshots at the army at the oppressive army

57:27.800 --> 57:30.600
they considered to be heroes in the western press

57:30.600 --> 57:34.840
when palestinian kids throw stones at the israel soldiers

57:34.840 --> 57:40.040
they're called terrorists and israel gets away with a lot more without

57:40.040 --> 57:43.640
much less criticism in the western press than any other

57:43.640 --> 57:48.600
country um i'll say one more thing i was recently

57:48.600 --> 57:52.520
contacted by a palestinian woman from jergal

57:52.520 --> 57:56.600
she runs a program for palestinian children who spend time in israeli

57:56.600 --> 58:02.040
jails 14 15 16 years or jail for months or years

58:02.040 --> 58:05.080
sometimes they can't see their families for months

58:05.080 --> 58:07.720
and she runs a program for them you know she does

58:07.720 --> 58:12.760
she meditates with them she does sufis or sufi dura she dancing with them

58:12.760 --> 58:17.800
swirling dancing to bring them out of their stress day she says we don't have

58:17.800 --> 58:22.440
post-traumatic stress disorder here because the trauma is never post

58:22.440 --> 58:27.880
but traumas daily she said i just wish your Zionist friend

58:27.880 --> 58:32.680
would visit the occupied territories and Gaza like i have

58:32.680 --> 58:37.960
and let him speak the way he speaks now he's got any ounce of humanity left

58:37.960 --> 58:40.840
he would cry like i did for two weeks when i was there

58:40.840 --> 58:45.160
now we're not living in anti-jurmani anybody can go on youtube

58:45.160 --> 58:49.080
and listen to illan papi an israeli historian

58:49.080 --> 58:53.720
told the eloquent on israeli history who's living living in england now

58:53.720 --> 58:57.000
because life became in israel too difficult for him

58:57.000 --> 59:00.920
anybody can listen to normal fickenstein a jewish professor

59:00.920 --> 59:07.720
world expert on gaza who was denied ten tenure at his university

59:07.720 --> 59:11.960
because of his public speaking against israeli policy

59:11.960 --> 59:16.680
you can listen to any number of in uh israeli defense forces soldiers

59:16.680 --> 59:21.160
who talk about the brutality that they now regret having committed

59:21.160 --> 59:24.920
you can listen to israeli pilots who talk about

59:24.920 --> 59:32.360
why they refuse to fly over gaza because of the atrocities they're made to commit

59:32.440 --> 59:37.240
you can get all the information you want

59:37.240 --> 59:41.240
so if anybody these days doesn't know it's not because the information is not

59:41.240 --> 59:44.280
available it's not what you know it's what you

59:44.280 --> 59:49.640
could know if you wanted to find out there are no two sides

59:49.640 --> 59:55.560
i mean it's always a complex question but in terms of power and control and

59:55.560 --> 59:59.480
it's pretty straightforward there was a land with the people living there

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.760
and other people wanted it they took it over

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.360
and they continue to take it over and they continue to do

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:13.240
to discriminate against or press and dispossessed that other people

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:22.760
that's what happened and that's what's happening

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:36.600
thank you for watching you can get my book the myth of normal

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:43.160
in heart cover of course like always we're selling a book there

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:48.280
um but the reason why i play that video is because i really want

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:55.080
to make the impression that what i said yesterday still remains true

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.600
i don't really think that i know what happened

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.480
i am just absolutely exquisitely sure that we've been lied to for much longer

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.000
than since 2020

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.400
but i think that if we focus on the biology and the lies about biology that

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.960
we've been told specifically about RNA fidelity

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:23.880
about infectious clones about the swarm about replication and

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:29.000
competent variants about all cause mortality

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
about T cell immunity about linked recognition

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
about the differences between infection at a barrier

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.040
and transfection

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:50.520
and i think that focusing on this can help us to unite the world

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.880
in a way because we were all lied to in one specific way you know the

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.640
the jewish people are being lied to in a certain way about what happened to

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.160
them americans are being lied to in a certain way

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.080
about what happened here the EU countries are lying to their

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.440
respective citizens about what happened there

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:16.920
but there are red threads that run through all of those lies

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.680
which could allow everybody in israel and everybody in america and everybody

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.200
in the EU to see that wow they lied to us about a novel virus

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.560
about the vulnerability that everybody would have to it

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.760
about the need to do something about it

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.480
about the effectiveness of vaccines in the past and the present

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.280
and about the dangers of gain of function research research as a source

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:49.160
of the pandemic and a potential source of a future one

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.560
and they had every intention of doing this because they started with a lie

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.400
about a novel virus that we were all vulnerable to

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.760
and they started with a lie about a series of tests that could find it

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.000
and they started with a lie about those for the fidelity of those tests and

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.520
they've formed a consensus in hospital administrations

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.560
school boards state health boards through a combination of financial

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:24.360
incentives and coercion it is possible that these sequences

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.480
were real at the early part of the pandemic and that they were seated

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.760
using an infectious clone that's the way that they would do it

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.920
it's also possible that no virus ever escaped from anywhere

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.120
and that it all was an elaborate media hoax

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.960
that is possible although i don't really see how they could fool all the

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:50.040
molecular biologists and all the the people that went

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.840
along with it and tried to do their best

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.760
still had to be fooled by the diagnostics and still had to be fooled by some of

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.320
the biology and that's why i think by using an infectious clone

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.240
to create the illusion of natural spread

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.240
would be the way that they could do that where

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:16.120
biologists themselves who might realize how ridiculous

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.920
the concept of a pandemic is would still be fooled by the apparent evidence of

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.960
a pandemic happening

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.040
and that's this illusion of consensus about the biology is going to be used to

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.840
invert our kids rights from sovereignty to permissions

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.000
this illusion of consensus was created by people on purpose

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.040
and i'm hot on their trail i believe and so are you

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.400
by watching this stream

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.600
they have roped us into believing that there's a mystery to solve

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.840
and in solving that mystery we've also accepted its premises which include

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.440
this novel virus and that we don't understand anything about it in that

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.120
vaccination is a great way to save ourselves from such a novel virus

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.560
but in the meantime we've had a ventilate to prevent spread

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.040
remdesivir medazolab are better than nothing

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.480
etc etc

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.280
where i forgot to take that out i apologize so

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960
it is a consensus that there's a mystery to solve and these are the answers and

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.440
we don't need

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.800
to go through this too much but people have asked me to read this

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.200
so one time i'm just going to do that tonight

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.040
so in this scenario we've defeated with disease and epidemics in the past

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.000
using vaccination novel coronaviruses can jump from other species and can

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.720
pandemic pcr false positives are rare

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:47.240
asymptomatic spread is real and there's only some over counting

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.440
variants are evidence of both spread and continuing evolution of a single

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.880
SARS virus and we spend money studying viruses

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.520
including gaining function research those are all

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.120
parts of this part of the illusion

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.880
but if you understand that it's a conflated background signals a natural

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.640
phenomenon like an eclipse that was going to happen anyway

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.040
like a bunch of RNA that's in the background anyway

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.600
and now we're going to use pcr to find it

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.200
and we're going to tell you that that pcr is evidence of spread of a novel

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.880
virus instead of just something that was always there

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.520
now you understand why the eclipse analogy is so good

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:33.640
this afternoon the gods have demanded that we start sacrificing because that's

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.240
why it's so drowdy around here

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.520
so let's get some prisoners and we're going to take them up on top the temple

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.720
and start rolling them down

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.400
and when the eclipse comes we'll ask god to come back

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.000
if we've done what he pleased to please him and then he'll come back

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.880
so let's just use a novel background signal that we'll test really vigorously

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.560
for in the first year and then slowly but surely dial up the specificity of

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.280
the test and slowly dial up the stringent use of it

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.440
so that essentially with a predictive

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:20.520
cycle of the sun we can make a disease appear and disappear again

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.920
and we can blame it on whatever we want to from lockdowns and masks

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.240
to the rollout of a highly effective vaccine that saved 19 million people in

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.680
the first year of its rollout

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.840
it's nothing more than an eclipse taking advantage of a pre-existing

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:45.320
natural phenomenon to tell a story that you can govern people by

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.760
it's a little trickier than any eclipse because

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.560
we know more nowadays we're smarter as we think we are

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.600
and so the hoax needs to be a little bit more elaborate than predicting a

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.400
natural event

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.880
but it doesn't really matter whether it's endemic coronaviruses and they're

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.600
lying about them protocols were murder and

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.520
transfection is not medicine if it's an infectious clone that they released

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.480
in different places and then sequenced it cultured it claimed wow look at this

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.800
need on it the PCR tests are not specific for a

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.920
particular virus the PCR tests have sources of false positive

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.800
besides high cycle count respiratory disease that leads to secondary

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.400
ammonia is a regular cause of death that now went skyrocketing because they

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.320
decided not to use antibiotics

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.280
and that's what changing the protocol does

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.960
additional arms were also caused by the lockdown and specific agents like

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.720
medazlam and rendezivir but early treatment must be

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.040
considered protocol by protocol and we've spent money making sure

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.760
dangers pandemic pand dangerous zoonotic pandemics are

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:00.200
taken seriously but we haven't spent money to show that they're real

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.880
we've just spent money to make sure that they're dangerous taken seriously

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:12.520
that's what this these scenarios of a conflated background signal really mean

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.840
and this is not a viable scenario because they just don't acknowledge any molecular

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.480
biology then and that there are no signals anywhere and there's no

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.120
diseases or nothing that's just not possible

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.320
the worst part is is that i've said it last night and i'll say it again they're

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.120
more concerned about you pledging and promising that you

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.560
don't believe in viruses before they'll talk to you

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.680
and then when they talk to you they want to talk to you about foyer requests and

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.920
what those mean

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.520
rather than talking about transfection not being medicine

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.040
and the protocols being murdered

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.120
it's a conflated background signal ladies and gentlemen and the players who are

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:58.840
covering this background signal use up this eclipse

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.920
they won't address PCR as a fraud they won't address variants and sequence as

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.520
a fraud they won't address death certificate fraud

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.760
they won't address the RNA purity fraud the possibility of small interfering

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.520
RNAs they won't address the protein folding

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.120
problem and the idea that some epitopes are not just

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.760
the sequence of the protein but how the protein folds in three dimensions and

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.280
epitopes that are created by the folding

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.040
and so if the codon optimization and the pseudo uradines have caused the

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.800
protein to fold differently then we're having different epitopes than the

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.080
natural viral protein they're not talking about

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.200
transfection in general and since the very beginning unlike me they haven't

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.280
talked about natural immunity they're still not doing it

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.640
and the reason why is because they want to continue to bamboozle your children

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.520
with stupid stupid stupid biology really dumb simple

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.200
or stupid complicated so that they surrender so that they go limp

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.720
and turn over their medical data and their genetic data of themselves and

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.840
their kids before this beautiful packed planet of

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.400
diverse genomes is gone forever

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.880
Immunization is not transfection ladies and gentlemen

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:22.680
and yeah any combination of substances injected

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.320
the intention of augmenting your immune system is pretty dumb

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.640
please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.160
the control group i apologize if they're getting a

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.360
little redundant ladies and gentlemen i've got to kind of

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.800
keep my wits about me here i can produce a show like this in about an

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.440
hour and a half and then it takes me another hour to give it

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.480
if i want to teach a journal club or i want to do a immunology course it's

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.360
quite a bit more work so it's not that i'm not going to

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.720
do that again and we're not going to start with that stuff again

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.520
but i feel like this illusion needs so much breaking

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.120
and it is an illusion of the consensus that people are

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.840
agreeing on stuff and so i don't know what we gain by

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.840
muddying the water with new science or muddying the water with new neuroscience

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:23.800
right now because this we're at a crucial moment

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.720
i don't know if we're going to get another chance at

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:31.080
2023 and 2024 but after that i think all bets are off

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.240
if we don't get this out there and it become common knowledge before the

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.920
election i don't really know how it ever gets out

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.440
so there is going to be more stuff coming but i'm

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.560
probably going to keep this kind of pace until

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.800
halloween and then we're going to make a a choice on schedule and a choice on

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.240
place including going back to youtube as well

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.040
lots of plans lots of things in the works don't worry

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.800
we're far from done we've shifted up like one level but we've got many more

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.880
years to go you know biological is a

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.040
is a jog or not that hasn't even woken up

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.080
can't wait for halloween
