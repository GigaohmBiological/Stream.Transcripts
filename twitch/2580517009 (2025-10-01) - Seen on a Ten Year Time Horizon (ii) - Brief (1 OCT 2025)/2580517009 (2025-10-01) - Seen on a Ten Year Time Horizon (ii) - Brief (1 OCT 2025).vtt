WEBVTT

01:10.080 --> 01:10.180
so

01:52.137 --> 01:53.038
Good morning, everybody.

01:53.078 --> 01:53.778
Welcome to the show.

01:53.838 --> 01:58.241
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:58.921 --> 01:59.961
It's a one man show.

02:00.001 --> 02:06.425
I'm still trying to, I thought I would, at least I didn't start out the show by saying I think I got it because I don't still got it yet.

02:06.465 --> 02:09.847
But I know exactly the transition I'm trying to accomplish, but I keep

02:10.726 --> 02:13.508
forgetting that there's three buttons in that one move.

02:13.628 --> 02:29.440
Usually there's only two buttons because of my setup, but now because of the extra trick I'm trying to do with this overlay, and now I can't switch back, and non-overlay, and I have to do this transition again, sorry about that.

02:30.932 --> 02:36.339
The logo on the hat is actually Bethel Park High School, the Bethel Park Blackhawks.

02:37.200 --> 02:42.506
The high school where Matthew Crooks went to high school and the high school where my son goes to high school now.

02:42.647 --> 02:44.689
Yes, that's the hat.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.432
This is Giga Home Biological, where we stay focused on the biology.

02:49.452 --> 02:53.414
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

02:53.554 --> 02:54.394
We know their names.

02:54.434 --> 02:55.115
We talk to them.

02:56.195 --> 02:58.396
Today just happens to be the day during the week.

02:58.476 --> 03:10.162
It's not always Tuesday or Wednesday or whatever, but today's the day that I've decided to do the Right Now Show, because the Right Now Show really is about right now, like what's happening now and how can we really process it.

03:10.902 --> 03:26.107
The social media military operation under whose spell we have fallen, under whose enchantment we are operating, has actually bamboozled us into thinking on very short time horizons.

03:26.267 --> 03:38.891
And that means that we can't see the bigger picture for what it is, especially with regard to the history of these actors for whom this performance is their lives, for whom this performance is their livelihood.

03:39.631 --> 04:01.072
and for whom for rather for our governance is what their their whole theater is for so today I just wanted to bring to your attention the fact that Dana White had been on and I said white like whip because it's a family guy joke but Dana White was just on 60 Minutes yesterday

04:02.233 --> 04:08.775
And Bobby, Donnie, Albert, Marty, and Mohamed gave a press conference yesterday.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.755
And so the Right Now show is usually about today or yesterday.

04:11.775 --> 04:24.118
And it's just because things are moving so fast and the fire hose is on so strong that it's really hard to pay attention to anything else but the fire hose.

04:24.818 --> 04:29.899
But of course, the way to not pay attention to the fire hose is just take your head out of the way of it.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.140
And that is social media.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.720
You've got to get off of it.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.341
Otherwise, you're going to drown.

04:34.801 --> 04:36.721
You're waterboarding yourself mentally.

04:38.242 --> 04:40.282
You're really waterboarding yourself mentally.

04:40.722 --> 04:50.665
And then if I have the time, which I intend to have, then we will get all the way to the second half of that front line from 2015 that we left off with on Monday, which I think is a vital

04:52.589 --> 05:00.096
sneak peek, if you will, or retrospective into how we got here and what actors are in front of us now versus then.

05:00.136 --> 05:10.665
And most importantly, and I can't stress this enough, you have to evaluate these actors on the basis of their ability or lack of progress.

05:10.865 --> 05:12.387
If they cannot progress,

05:13.413 --> 05:17.236
both in their understanding and in their ability to message.

05:17.296 --> 05:33.369
In other words, if you meet somebody with a good idea that doesn't have an elevator pitch 10 years ago and then you meet them 10 years later and they have the exact same crappy elevator pitch with no

05:34.651 --> 05:36.011
advancing whatsoever.

05:36.071 --> 05:42.713
You know, basically if you met somebody that was selling shoes back in the nineties and they said that my idea is just do it.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.653
And that's how I'm going to say it all the time.

05:45.693 --> 05:52.835
And then in, in, you met him in 2025 and they were like, yeah, I'm just, I'm just trying to get that just do it thing to catch on.

05:53.295 --> 06:00.837
They have not, they have not, they have not, they have not progressed.

06:01.117 --> 06:02.497
So yeah.

06:03.784 --> 06:15.274
This channel is about the biology that underlies the, let's say, the intellectual basis for the trap that we are in.

06:15.715 --> 06:25.863
It's not that we are just in a trap about biology, but much of the mythology that traps modern society's citizens

06:26.941 --> 06:46.626
in an illusion of consensus about the dangers that they face on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and from a lifetime perspective, is solely controlled by what I would best think, best characterized as a military social control program suite

06:48.891 --> 07:02.459
So just like if you buy the Adobe Creative Suite and you get Illustrator and Photoshop and I don't know, Media Encoder and InDesign and I can't name them all because I don't use them all.

07:02.959 --> 07:11.865
But I do have the suite and so I know what I'm talking about when I say you get all these possible programs because they all come together as one collective creative package.

07:12.365 --> 07:17.008
And I would suggest to you that social media is nothing more than the same thing

07:17.808 --> 07:20.970
but from a military social control perspective.

07:21.631 --> 07:47.248
And it is your own acquiescence to subscribing to each one of these platforms that allows them to extract behavioral data and data about what you're curious about, what you search for, your habits, when you're online, how often, what you buy, all of these things, including what will distract you based on, you know, the random things that they throw in front of you and then you click on.

07:48.088 --> 07:54.533
Like it or not, years of participation in that system has already made all of us very vulnerable to it.

07:55.874 --> 07:57.795
And that's how they pulled off the pandemic.

07:58.576 --> 08:03.759
They fractured us intellectually and made it seem like there were only really two camps in America.

08:03.799 --> 08:06.521
But in reality, there were lots more than that.

08:08.703 --> 08:14.827
And those individual islands of intellectual isolation, we were numb to it.

08:16.869 --> 08:30.460
But now that we're in these little isolated bubbles of intellectual isolation that just because by they are designed militarily, each of these little narrative bubbles has a lot of overlap.

08:31.240 --> 08:42.890
And so even when we talk to people who aren't in our specific bubble, there's a lot of overlap and the illusion of consensus that there's really two basic groups in America is sustained, even though

08:43.490 --> 09:03.811
within the conservative movement and within the left movement or whatever you want to name these two things that don't exist, there are probably nearly, you know, hard to quantify how many groups of people they've created on the internet and can maintain and more importantly monitor how you move between them.

09:06.266 --> 09:27.092
And as long as you're interacting with people on social media, there is no other way to conceive your experience on social media other than you are moving between invisible groups of narrative controllers, the bots that support them and the algorithmic programming that supports them.

09:27.652 --> 09:35.314
And you can probably move between these virtual attractor states so that if you end up following, I don't know,

09:35.954 --> 09:45.381
Ryan Cole and Dr. Drew, and I'm just trying to come up with some random combination of people.

09:46.102 --> 10:02.294
It can be an intellectual attractor state that's just fine until you figure out that Brett Weinstein doesn't agree with those people, and then you can move into another group of people who essentially add up to an attractor state that will reinforce one another and argue with each other and keep you there.

10:03.399 --> 10:15.283
And all the while, it's sustained this illusion that this is the conservative populist side that generally agrees to support Trump, and this is the liberal democratic side.

10:15.883 --> 10:22.306
But every single topic, as Jason just tweeted, has a managed attractor.

10:23.211 --> 10:23.491
Right?

10:24.131 --> 10:29.434
It has a number of pivot points that intellectually are managed by these people.

10:29.474 --> 10:46.142
And if you, like me, didn't see it in the beginning and couldn't conceive of the idea that there would be this whole symphonic chorus of people that would be on a script that would be so well-written that you could just bounce around within it.

10:47.542 --> 10:48.403
But that's what I did.

10:49.813 --> 11:13.482
So naive was I, and so good at penetrating these groups of people with, you know, good biological questions, that they ended up as a group of people juggling me over the last six years and exposing themselves as one more or less coordinated scripted unit that ultimately is behind Skyhorse Publishing, the

11:15.171 --> 11:27.798
populist movement that Steve Bannon claims to be one of the architects of CHD and ICANN and the anti-vax movement that has morphed into this health freedom or Maha movement.

11:27.858 --> 11:41.906
It's all one malevolent show that probably could be best characterized as a bunch of people that are Democrats at heart that decided to sell out their country for whatever the Democratic Party is.

11:43.058 --> 11:47.421
I don't think the Democratic Party is just one half of something or other.

11:47.481 --> 11:51.625
It's been taken over by something, but I don't wanna, I'm not that guy.

11:51.705 --> 11:53.846
I'm just, it ain't Epstein.

11:54.347 --> 12:11.320
It ain't the Epstein Island story and people being controlled by blackmail because like an aircraft carrier, the United States government is too complicated of a human operation to be controlled by dirty pictures and drugs and that kind of thing.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.581
more complicated than that.

12:13.661 --> 12:28.489
So we've got a group of people that have collectively worked together to create the illusion, to create the illusion that there's a Democratic and Republican party vying for power, yada yada yada, when in reality it's probably all a bunch of sellouts.

12:30.706 --> 12:44.797
And if the sellout started out with their hive in the Democratic Party and then spread to the Republican Party, does it really matter at this point whether it's Republican or Democrat that started it?

12:44.857 --> 12:45.538
Not really.

12:45.558 --> 12:47.639
I mean, it's American history.

12:48.120 --> 13:00.189
But if you want the brass tacks of how to get out of this, you have to understand that at some moment in time, there became a national security initiative and priority and incentive

13:01.943 --> 13:11.226
to control the politics of America so that irrespective of who was elected, the main objectives of the national security state would remain the same.

13:11.706 --> 13:25.170
And more importantly, anything that was of a national security priority high enough to keep secret would mean that you definitely wouldn't want to have it, let's say, put in jeopardy by getting the wrong guy elected.

13:26.650 --> 13:31.971
And so you kind of just have to do the math in your head and realize that you've always suspected that something wasn't right.

13:32.472 --> 13:49.296
And now you just have to walk all the way to the end of that, to the logical conclusion that there is a real, a real multi-generational national security initiative and priority, which supersedes the need for free elections at this point.

13:49.356 --> 13:55.018
And they decided that after World War II and after the dropping of the atomic bomb,

13:56.021 --> 14:19.277
Now, irrespective of whether you agree with Mark Kulak and Eddie Bravo that actually nuclear weapons aren't real, but just an elaborate illusion, it doesn't change the fact that at that point there was this impetus in American history and a story is being reinforced even now with movies that Mark has shown us that this idea is being used to motivate people.

14:20.526 --> 14:31.939
This idea is being used as a foundational motivation for people's ideas of how they conceive the world and therefore how they excuse the behavior of actors in the world as well.

14:33.157 --> 14:41.544
And so not that dissimilar to pandemics and the idea of gain-of-function viruses or the idea of natural pandemic viruses that are waiting in bat caves.

14:42.085 --> 14:55.737
It is a foundational idea that allows people to justify behavior, justify decisions, justify lying to people who aren't sophisticated enough to understand.

14:56.317 --> 15:07.366
their motives, which go back to the 50s again and the 60s, where they described it very well, that it's time that we take the control of the evolution of the species.

15:07.406 --> 15:13.691
We've got to realize that, you know, God has given us this knowledge and we need to act on it.

15:15.242 --> 15:33.767
And from their perspective, acting on it means taking control of the evolution of the species by any means necessary, including genetic engineering and eugenics and the prevention of interbreeding or whatever other concepts these people have had in the background and been fighting about and discussing.

15:35.168 --> 15:41.870
There's a lot of human history here, a lot of human history tied up in this, and it's all been sort of hidden.

15:44.042 --> 16:03.037
hidden by stories about, I don't know, space lasers that can destroy buildings and scary countries that are in the desert and can control the world with, again, a web of spies and blackmail and, I guess, naked pictures and stuff.

16:04.525 --> 16:13.412
So it's crazy because I don't think that the world works as it works because there are a few rich guys who like young girls.

16:13.512 --> 16:14.473
I just don't think that.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.675
It's not that explanation at all.

16:17.735 --> 16:19.137
It's much different than that.

16:19.217 --> 16:30.906
This is a orchestrated show because there are national security priorities that cannot be disturbed because somebody gets elected.

16:32.119 --> 16:36.642
And therefore, the election of these people is no longer left to chance.

16:36.742 --> 16:42.346
The people that rise there and are allowed to get there are already past muster.

16:42.386 --> 16:45.168
They've already shown that they're in the project.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.309
And what's the project?

16:46.349 --> 16:47.309
That's the trick.

16:47.389 --> 16:48.310
That's the question.

16:49.431 --> 16:53.733
What project could possibly be prioritized in this way?

16:54.274 --> 17:00.178
And what biological working parts would it have?

17:01.152 --> 17:02.192
Cause it ain't nukes.

17:04.694 --> 17:06.034
I don't know, we'll get there someday.

17:06.094 --> 17:09.716
I'll be able to start this show really short someday.

17:10.176 --> 17:11.317
I don't even know what happened there.

17:11.337 --> 17:12.857
What did I just talk for 12 minutes?

17:12.957 --> 17:15.098
Gee whiz, monkey boy.

17:15.779 --> 17:17.219
All right, I'll be back in a second.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:37.104 --> 17:40.948
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.651
We want everybody to feel good.

17:43.971 --> 17:45.433
That's not the way life is.

17:50.338 --> 17:55.663
I should have played this yesterday, of course, but I'm going to pause this for a minute.

17:57.898 --> 18:01.647
The trick here is to realize that b3's b3 cubed which happened at the cubby bear

18:08.978 --> 18:12.800
In Chicago, I think B cubed was on Wednesday nights.

18:12.980 --> 18:31.068
And so I really feel like although This Freddie Jones band song has a as a lyric very clear, you know Tuesday morning It's actually a song that Nathan and I would have heard at the cubby bear live by this band on a Wednesday night and so

18:32.771 --> 18:38.820
That's my excuse for not being here yesterday and playing it yesterday and instead playing it today.

18:38.860 --> 18:46.170
But anyway, this is just a brief, you know, it's a it's a song that takes a little while to play.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.773
So obviously it is a

18:49.295 --> 18:50.256
Where is this slide?

18:50.316 --> 18:50.976
Oh, yeah, right there.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.819
It's a song that'll take five minutes and then we'll start the show.

18:56.420 --> 19:01.323
And I believe I'm starting with the first video right away before I go to the intro.

19:01.343 --> 19:03.425
So I've already done the intro twice.

19:03.485 --> 19:05.586
So I don't know what the heck I'm talking about.

19:05.806 --> 19:06.447
Anyway, here we go.

19:07.487 --> 19:08.688
Play it, play it, play it.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.100
Thank you

19:59.022 --> 20:00.484
Did they mute me already?

20:00.664 --> 20:01.926
See, that's annoying.

20:02.207 --> 20:02.547
Whatever.

20:02.808 --> 20:04.070
I'm not going to play that now.

20:04.130 --> 20:06.333
Nathan will understand why I'm not playing it now.

20:07.154 --> 20:11.160
I just want to get started and get out of here on time.

20:12.631 --> 20:14.592
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

20:15.393 --> 20:22.721
It is, again, you know, you can ask me how I know that these people are scripted actors, but it's because I chased them around for five years.

20:22.801 --> 20:23.802
I trusted a lot of them.

20:23.882 --> 20:34.452
I had personal relationships with them where I really feel like at this point the best way to characterize what these people did very willingly is they

20:35.473 --> 20:36.634
They lied to me.

20:38.736 --> 20:47.643
I was even lucky enough to be lied to by Robert Malone in concert with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Meryl Ness, Jessica Rose, and Tess Laurie.

20:48.603 --> 20:51.246
They're all scripted actors on a need-to-know basis.

20:52.046 --> 21:11.456
And that's why there's a movie where we actually have Robert Malone in the same movie as the Nobel Prize winners and Tony Fauci, as if he's just some dude, when in fact he is exactly as important as the rest of them, because he's one half.

21:12.436 --> 21:14.177
of the kind of crew.

21:15.417 --> 21:19.038
I'm absolutely certain that Robert Malone is a traitor to my grandkids.

21:19.338 --> 21:23.319
I'm absolutely certain that Kevin McKernan is a traitor to my grandkids.

21:23.659 --> 21:29.701
I'm absolutely certain that Meryl Nass is a traitor to my grandchildren and that Brian Hooker is a fraud.

21:30.422 --> 21:38.084
And unfortunately, I'm very sure that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., best case scenario, is a scripted actor who doesn't know any better

21:38.784 --> 21:46.849
and just knows that he's part of a national security state operation and therefore sees whatever he's doing as paramount.

21:46.909 --> 21:48.430
That's all I got for you, friends.

21:49.531 --> 21:50.572
It's that bad.

21:50.672 --> 22:02.980
America is under the control of actors and if you want to help and you're not in America, stop thinking that Robert Malone, I'm sorry, stop thinking that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.323
and Jay Bhattacharya and Donald Trump are changing things because they are actors.

22:08.396 --> 22:12.581
Just like these people are actors and they don't have to know.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.683
They just have to be.

22:16.175 --> 22:19.438
They just have to be willing to go along with the script.

22:19.738 --> 22:24.643
Especially the people that don't understand the biology, they don't need to know.

22:24.663 --> 22:25.003
He knows.

22:25.083 --> 22:25.363
He knows.

22:25.403 --> 22:26.044
That guy knows.

22:26.064 --> 22:26.865
That guy knows.

22:26.885 --> 22:28.526
She doesn't know.

22:42.158 --> 22:46.381
She can't possibly know, otherwise she wouldn't have accepted the Nobel Prize.

22:46.401 --> 22:47.881
I didn't think it would work.

22:49.982 --> 22:54.605
They take that technology, tweak it a little bit to make it work in the COVID vaccines.

22:54.905 --> 22:56.806
It's absolutely absurd, of course.

22:57.587 --> 23:02.889
And that's the reason why I know that these people are national security actors.

23:02.949 --> 23:03.670
That's how I know.

23:05.130 --> 23:06.631
They've all tried to lie to me.

23:06.671 --> 23:08.112
They've all tried to fool me.

23:08.292 --> 23:14.816
Even Jimmy Dore is just a scripted actor, and he knows for sure that I know.

23:15.557 --> 23:18.558
Look at that photograph with me and him and my wife.

23:18.839 --> 23:20.219
Like, this is not a joke.

23:21.120 --> 23:25.202
I am accusing these people of selling out America.

23:25.423 --> 23:29.325
Jimmy Dore is selling out America.

23:29.445 --> 23:31.086
Whitney Webb is a fraud.

23:31.106 --> 23:33.447
Jay Bhattacharya, the NIH,

23:34.730 --> 23:35.451
director.

23:37.492 --> 23:54.504
I, as a father of three and a long-time academic biologist living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, specifically in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, no I'm not afraid to say it, just a few blocks away where supposedly Matthew Crooks lived,

23:57.523 --> 24:04.747
I am coming out publicly and trying to get a hold of any newspaper that will listen that these people are frauds.

24:04.847 --> 24:05.688
They have to be.

24:06.088 --> 24:08.489
And more importantly, that means they're treasonous.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.310
They're guilty.

24:09.450 --> 24:10.250
They're traitors.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.512
They're not working for the American public.

24:16.534 --> 24:20.376
They are infiltrators of sorts because they are not who they say they are.

24:20.456 --> 24:25.479
These frauds tricked me long enough to get my name in their fricking book.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.535
And I'm ashamed of it.

24:29.096 --> 24:41.359
I would be interested in pursuing any legal recourse to the amount of tarnishment that this has done to my professional and personal reputation now that I understand the extent to which these people are frauds.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.140
And I can tell you exactly how they defrauded me.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.762
At some point during the writing of the book, I told the whole staff of the book that Robert Malone was a fraud.

24:52.961 --> 25:06.909
And they went so far as to take him off the reading list of the edited, the editing, the live document in a, I guess, an attempt to make it seem like I had some effect on them.

25:08.130 --> 25:12.353
But then Robert Malone is still on the back of that book as saying that it was great.

25:12.433 --> 25:18.897
Robert Malone was one of the final readers of the book during the final phases, along with Merrill Nass.

25:19.697 --> 25:20.858
And so they lied to me.

25:22.056 --> 25:38.621
They lied to me to get my name in that book, they paid me long enough that I'm in that book, and they made me sign something, I guess, to make sure that my name would be in that book, but they also tried to get me to sign something when I left CHD and accept $8,000 to do it, and I did not.

25:40.862 --> 25:54.018
Which means I'm very happy to tell you that CHD is also a very fraudulent organization and therefore taking money from Americans via donation as a non-profit and they are guilty of fraud.

25:54.827 --> 25:58.908
They are paying their salaries out, and they are very high salaries.

25:58.948 --> 26:02.408
They're not like, you know, volunteers that are giving up everything.

26:02.868 --> 26:08.710
These people get a quarter million dollars a year to do a Zoom meeting or two a week, and they're all happy to do it.

26:08.790 --> 26:10.750
They know they haven't accomplished anything.

26:10.790 --> 26:20.952
They know that they were essentially some kind of Trojan horse organization to get some kind of grassroots support for that clown over there, who's definitely just a fraud.

26:21.332 --> 26:22.112
He's an actor.

26:23.251 --> 26:27.795
who somebody whispered in his ear a long time ago and has been whispering in his ear ever since.

26:29.516 --> 26:31.117
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

26:31.177 --> 26:34.340
I don't want to be this person, but I believed all of them.

26:34.460 --> 26:41.025
I tried hard to believe in all of them, to give them all the benefit of the doubt.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.288
And that's why I have all these selfies.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.155
Because I worked hard over the last six years.

26:50.335 --> 26:54.098
I mean hard, and thereby making them work even harder.

26:55.079 --> 27:06.947
Maybe even to a certain small, tiny extent, something about what we talk about or something about what we argue about would have never been part of the allowable discourse had it not been for my work.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.730
I can never tell you what that would be.

27:10.717 --> 27:30.280
But I can assure you one of the reasons why no one still to this day uses the word transfection, which is on like so many of his papers in his CV, and so many of the papers upon which the supposed patents that he has up on the wall are based, their titles say transfection.

27:34.659 --> 27:40.655
And so the United States has been bamboozled under the pretense of intellectual property reset.

27:40.836 --> 27:43.382
One of the cheapest things you can say about it.

27:47.006 --> 28:10.250
But it's really about patent reset and idea reset about a technology that's only now become sort of feasible in the sense of cheap, feasible in the sense of, you know, small scale personalized batches, achievable in the sense of the Human Genome Project has finally, you know, made us able to make RNA and DNA cheaply enough.

28:12.557 --> 28:21.533
They're ready to make the transition to transfecting people to see if we can learn anything about our genomes, to see if we can, that we can, I don't know, make any progress.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.000
It's really bad, ladies and gentlemen.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.821
These people are not real people.

28:31.062 --> 28:39.190
It is a very orchestrated set of scripted actors, which essentially now perform on podcasts and late night talk shows.

28:39.350 --> 28:43.734
And late night talk shows are also podcasts, so it's kind of like, whatever.

28:45.977 --> 28:48.980
And they're all part of the show, from the low level all the way up.

28:49.813 --> 28:52.775
And these people are all just auditioning to climb the ladder.

28:53.395 --> 28:59.159
You don't think Kim Iverson would really, really, really, really, really like to be Jimmy Kimmel?

29:00.379 --> 29:04.682
You don't think Dr. Drew would really, really, really, really, really like to be Jimmy Kimmel?

29:05.863 --> 29:10.506
You don't think somebody like, I don't know, let's pick one over here.

29:11.866 --> 29:15.889
Ryan Cole, you don't think Ryan Cole would like to be, I don't know, governor of Idaho?

29:17.574 --> 29:23.560
Kevin McKernan, you don't think Kevin McKernan wants to make another hundred million dollars from cancer research and weed?

29:24.361 --> 29:25.662
Personalized weed?

29:26.663 --> 29:31.147
I don't know, cannabinoids that are personalized and designer cannabinoids?

29:33.329 --> 29:35.391
What about the head of the wellness company?

29:35.431 --> 29:36.893
What's he want for his future?

29:45.307 --> 29:46.427
Don't take Tylenol.

29:46.948 --> 29:47.588
Don't take it.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.248
With Tylenol, don't take it.

29:49.869 --> 29:50.549
Don't take it.

29:50.809 --> 29:52.429
Don't use Tylenol.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.531
You gotta ask yourself, why do we have Donald Trump?

29:55.751 --> 30:11.336
Why do we have these videos available for, and these clips available for Jimmy Kimmel to just stomp him the day after, the day after he was supposedly suspended, he's able to stomp on him with this video?

30:12.056 --> 30:13.938
Don't give Tylenol to the baby.

30:14.178 --> 30:15.819
Don't give your baby Tylenol.

30:15.879 --> 30:17.480
That's by design.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.642
Don't take Tylenol.

30:19.662 --> 30:21.963
That's fifth generation warfare, ladies and gentlemen.

30:21.983 --> 30:22.664
Don't take Tylenol.

30:22.984 --> 30:23.644
Don't take it.

30:23.865 --> 30:24.545
Don't take it.

30:25.246 --> 30:27.407
So that's it.

30:28.128 --> 30:29.489
There's nothing much to say.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.390
Don't take Tylenol.

30:31.410 --> 30:32.190
Just don't take it.

30:32.691 --> 30:34.512
And I just say it again.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.254
Don't take Tylenol.

30:37.674 --> 30:38.235
Don't take it.

31:08.021 --> 31:15.645
He holds no championship belt, but Dana White is the most prominent and pugnacious figure in the UFC, the ultimate fighting championship.

31:16.305 --> 31:27.350
The CEO slash hype man is the embodiment of the league itself, long on unapologetic force, short on precious formality, intoxicating to some and acquired taste to others.

31:28.031 --> 31:31.192
And much like the UFC, White has penetrated the defense of.

31:31.532 --> 31:35.695
I think it's important to watch 60 minutes because 60 minutes gave us

31:37.475 --> 32:02.912
George Webb and Peter Daszak and the Wuhan games in February because Robert Malone also gave us George Webb in his sub stack sharing the link to the CBS original show Because 60 minutes minutes gave us gave us Peter Daszak years ago because 60 minutes gave us Nathan Wolfe and

32:04.329 --> 32:10.231
because 60 Minutes gave us SARS, because 60 Minutes gave us the swine flu.

32:12.252 --> 32:21.795
60 Minutes is important because this is kind of the government brochure for a lot of these things.

32:23.813 --> 32:25.494
60 Minutes gave us Alex Karp.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.877
60 Minutes gave us that guy from Endereel.

32:28.917 --> 32:29.497
What's his name?

32:29.577 --> 32:32.539
Lucky Palmer or some bullshit like that.

32:33.740 --> 32:41.245
60 Minutes introduces us to a lot of the characters that are in the American comic book modern history.

32:41.905 --> 32:50.370
And I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you might want to view a lot of these people

32:51.580 --> 33:14.457
as comic book characters in a scripted American history, where the numbers are crazy, and the women are crazy, and the drugs are flowing, and the cars are lavish, you know, kind of like a Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous thing.

33:15.219 --> 33:21.523
And then it's a comic book about modern American history, and everybody would be in there.

33:21.563 --> 33:22.904
And you can imagine it, right?

33:22.944 --> 33:35.391
Because that's essentially where we are now, where all of these people agree that Donald Trump is a once in a millennium leader, similar to Genghis Khan or Aristotle.

33:36.532 --> 33:39.874
And around him are all kinds of people who are just like that.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.893
You know, a bunch of mini Jesuses.

33:44.654 --> 33:54.463
Like if you listen to Peter or Hegseth and what he said and what he says he prays every day, he's the D.O.D.

33:54.543 --> 33:54.983
Jesus.

33:55.244 --> 33:58.887
It's kind of remarkable how

33:59.568 --> 34:03.529
Willy nilly, these people are able to invoke God in their faith.

34:03.889 --> 34:15.152
You know, it's kind of like putting on a Cubs hat and saying that I've always been a fan of the Wrigley Field Bombers, you know, and pretending like you know what you're talking about, even though no one ever calls them that.

34:16.872 --> 34:21.773
It's really scary right now where we are, because you got to start to be honest with yourself.

34:23.274 --> 34:25.394
And the more faith in God,

34:29.266 --> 34:39.533
and in the sacred that you have, irrespective of the form that it takes, you must see through their fake faith.

34:40.254 --> 34:50.701
And that's the only way that I can say it, and I really feel sort of an urge to say it, because you have to be able to see that some people do not have faith.

34:52.585 --> 34:59.630
They have conviction in something, and they have so much conviction in something that they are willing to lie about the Lord.

35:01.091 --> 35:02.953
They are willing to lie about Jesus.

35:04.694 --> 35:10.198
And I'm afraid that right now we are in a time in human history where we need to take that very seriously.

35:12.500 --> 35:19.725
We need to take it very seriously for the simple fact that the other side is able to, somehow or another, the left,

35:21.340 --> 35:32.071
is able to not take the faith of the conservative side as performed on stage, is unable to take that faith seriously.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.613
But we aren't.

35:33.953 --> 35:41.341
And that's the part of this malevolent trap, is that on the left, they're very respectful of faith.

35:43.066 --> 35:57.893
But they are very okay with their ability to see that there's a huge contradiction with the idea that Donald Trump is supposedly a guy of faith, but then he behaves and says the things that he says.

35:59.153 --> 36:01.934
With the track record that he has, with the people that he hung out with.

36:01.974 --> 36:02.995
Now, I'm nuts.

36:04.392 --> 36:07.714
Everybody's Doesn't have their history right right now.

36:07.754 --> 36:19.960
They're all distorted So I get that but once you're arguing that Trump is not as bad as these people think it is you're already trapped Because that's the game It's all one theater.

36:20.020 --> 36:24.723
And as long as you're arguing about the actors on stage, it doesn't matter what your opinion is.

36:24.743 --> 36:24.763
I

36:26.601 --> 36:37.970
And so if you can get into the mental discipline of not defending the people on stage, but just watching them and evaluating the contradictions that they represent, you'll be able to painlessly watch.

36:39.471 --> 36:50.700
That's what I wanna try and teach people to do with regard to social media is painlessly watch it as a distorted window, but a very predictably distorted window.

36:51.633 --> 36:59.357
because it's distorted in a way that reflects human biology and human behavior and human psychology.

37:00.660 --> 37:13.645
And so once you understand it as a military social control suite that is specifically designed to provoke people, motivate people in particular directions, then you will look at it with that filter.

37:13.745 --> 37:21.528
So as we watch 60 Minutes and look at it with that filter, what do we see from 60 Minutes just a day ago?

37:22.228 --> 37:23.169
Mainstream culture.

37:23.809 --> 37:29.511
moving in from the fringes to join the ultra-rich, serve on the board of META, and befriend the current president.

37:30.211 --> 37:31.151
A small disclosure.

37:31.211 --> 37:34.712
We've been speaking with White for years about his appearing on this broadcast.

37:35.252 --> 37:36.453
A heavyweight disclosure.

37:36.593 --> 37:44.655
This was before Paramount Skydance, parent company of CBS, recently paid almost $8 billion for the UFC's media rights.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.616
Yes, cage fighting on network television.

37:47.896 --> 37:53.318
Perhaps the ultimate sign of how far this sport and its no-holds-barred leader have come.

37:55.290 --> 37:57.553
The story will continue in a moment.

37:59.975 --> 38:05.441
In this story, Arthur, they will say that the UFC sold for $4 billion.

38:05.461 --> 38:05.722
Two.

38:05.822 --> 38:06.803
Ha ha ha.

38:06.923 --> 38:07.123
Oh!

38:07.163 --> 38:07.644
Do you see?

38:07.704 --> 38:11.708
Baron Yevsky!

38:11.768 --> 38:13.770
Wow.

38:14.471 --> 38:14.832
Whoa.

38:15.212 --> 38:16.594
Are you serious?

38:17.366 --> 38:19.147
Tuesday night's all right for fighting.

38:19.527 --> 38:26.770
We sat outside the Octagon for Dana White's Contender Series, a streaming show that doubles as the UFC's farm system.

38:27.031 --> 38:28.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:29.052 --> 38:35.515
If the fighters entertain White, like this first-round knockout artist, he rewards them with a UFC contract.

38:35.795 --> 38:36.295
Good fight.

38:36.335 --> 38:36.835
Thank you very much.

38:36.855 --> 38:37.335
Incredible.

38:37.936 --> 38:40.357
An invitation by the big boss to the big show.

38:42.850 --> 38:47.471
White is chief author of the greatest sports business story of this century, maybe ever.

38:48.811 --> 38:50.872
And so just think about those words again.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.292
I'm not accusing Dana White of being fake.

38:54.132 --> 39:07.875
I just want you to think about what those words mean, because those are very similar words that Alex Karp and Peter Thiel just had this idea to start this company with some vague, vague, vague, vague word, vague word, vague word and vague word.

39:08.826 --> 39:13.707
about how people know things or about how people can see their databases or some shit like that.

39:14.788 --> 39:20.169
And now these guys are billionaires and have all the secret meetings and stuff and stuff.

39:20.929 --> 39:33.513
And something just doesn't compute with a 15 minute presentation about how some goofy dipshit like Alex Karp is where he is, or how some gay guy like Peter Thiel is where he is.

39:34.193 --> 39:37.814
And they never do a 60 minute story about the Gawker thing where

39:38.314 --> 39:48.426
You know, Peter Thiel funded the lawyers that were behind Hulk Hogan and ultimately put a put an internet company out of business just because they outed him as gay.

39:49.847 --> 39:54.373
They're going to do a story about how great he is or how smart he is, or maybe how he's the Antichrist.

39:56.010 --> 40:01.915
So 60 Minutes is now doing a story about the greatest sports story ever told.

40:02.495 --> 40:09.121
And that's financially, or from a capitalist perspective, or from an economic perspective, it's pretty remarkable.

40:09.141 --> 40:14.465
He bought the UFC for $2 million and turned it into a $4 billion sale.

40:14.966 --> 40:24.854
And we're supposed to believe, which is possible, but we are supposed to swallow entirely the idea that that is possible for anyone.

40:26.135 --> 40:33.658
You know, anyone that went to high school with two guys that inherited, I don't know, a fortune from casinos, I guess, it's possible.

40:33.938 --> 40:36.599
I don't know exactly the narrative, but let's just watch.

40:36.619 --> 40:38.540
Oh, that looks good.

40:39.280 --> 40:44.563
In his 30s, he helped buy the UFC, then a renegade cage fighting operation for $2 million.

40:44.723 --> 40:45.023
UFC!

40:47.024 --> 40:53.226
Now 56, he runs a global league valued at more than $15 billion, 675 fighters under contract.

41:00.860 --> 41:04.501
A brutal mashup that includes kickboxing, wrestling, and jujitsu.

41:05.741 --> 41:06.241
Fire away.

41:06.261 --> 41:06.921
You know me, man.

41:06.961 --> 41:08.082
You've known me for a long time.

41:08.382 --> 41:08.882
Fire away.

41:08.922 --> 41:10.282
I don't give a ****.

41:10.322 --> 41:12.143
You've known me for a long time?

41:12.203 --> 41:13.123
What does that mean?

41:14.703 --> 41:21.065
Now, if you didn't hear the start of this because it was playing too fast, he's on the board of meta.

41:28.494 --> 41:33.499
business is built more on White's force of personality than on a traditional playbook.

41:33.939 --> 41:36.481
We met him at UFC headquarters in Las Vegas.

41:36.801 --> 41:45.189
Whenever I read stories about the business of UFC, I literally laugh and say nobody knows anything about the business.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.291
It's probably totally true.

41:48.766 --> 41:51.287
Nobody knows where the funding came from.

41:51.368 --> 41:53.389
Nobody probably knows how he spent it.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.830
Nobody probably knows whether he bribed anybody.

41:56.290 --> 42:04.615
And again, I'm not accusing him of anything in particular, but what I want you to see is that that statement alone could mean a lot of shit.

42:06.104 --> 42:08.285
and including a lot of gangster shit.

42:08.445 --> 42:12.266
And this guy really projects a gangster vibe.

42:12.346 --> 42:29.633
And so it's not crazy to think that within the nature of masculinity that Dana White is supposed to represent, there's also a, you know, no holds barred, all's fair in love and war, and war is life, you know, kind of thing.

42:30.888 --> 42:32.149
What is everyone missing?

42:32.730 --> 42:36.713
For 25 years, people have been trying to figure it out and people have been trying to do it.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.055
Someone told me it all starts with Dana's gut.

42:39.775 --> 42:40.636
That's absolutely true.

42:40.656 --> 42:42.758
I don't know who told you that, but that's right.

42:43.258 --> 42:45.720
We got a sellout crowd here, 5,000 people.

42:46.180 --> 42:46.781
It was his gut.

42:46.801 --> 42:51.144
See, so I don't think that he always was in place, right?

42:51.184 --> 42:54.487
I mean, I don't think, but at some point he may have been recruited.

42:56.949 --> 42:57.209
Right?

42:57.350 --> 43:00.333
At some point, Pierre Corey was recruited.

43:00.433 --> 43:03.597
At some point, Peter McCullough was recruited.

43:03.677 --> 43:07.362
At some point, Jessica Rose was recruited.

43:07.402 --> 43:09.865
Because at some point, Jessica Rose was a teenager.

43:10.882 --> 43:12.103
And she wasn't doing this.

43:12.664 --> 43:16.087
At some point in time, all of these people were recruited.

43:16.167 --> 43:22.654
So you don't have to go all the way back to, you know, when people were in high school to find out that they went to the Dalton school.

43:22.694 --> 43:26.418
Although it is pretty funny that Mark found out that Jennifer Grey went to the Dalton school.

43:26.458 --> 43:29.801
And then that's the reason why Charlie Sheen got into Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

43:29.881 --> 43:31.142
But I digress.

43:32.023 --> 43:32.423
Sorry.

43:32.904 --> 43:34.344
But that got him into the game.

43:34.744 --> 43:40.768
He managed boxers in Boston, then fighters in Vegas in the fledgling sport of MMA, mixed martial arts.

43:41.368 --> 43:50.553
When White caught wind UFC's owners were out of money, his first call went to two high school buddies, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, Las Vegas casino heirs.

43:51.073 --> 43:56.276
I said, hey Frankie, hey Lorenzo, I got a great idea, come over here.

43:57.256 --> 43:58.477
I think they're going out of business.

43:58.977 --> 44:00.638
We could probably buy this thing and we should.

44:01.707 --> 44:03.107
The Fertittas put up the money.

44:03.488 --> 44:05.688
Oh, I needed to do a Boston accent.

44:05.708 --> 44:06.709
I totally blew that.

44:06.729 --> 44:07.329
Sorry about that.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.690
Got 10%, but he had to run the damn thing.

44:11.270 --> 44:13.391
The UFC wasn't just unprofitable.

44:13.451 --> 44:18.012
There's no mob, and there's no mob in Las Vegas.

44:18.052 --> 44:19.012
That's ridiculous.

44:19.072 --> 44:20.313
But I mean, in Boston?

44:20.873 --> 44:21.893
That's crazy talk.

44:22.733 --> 44:24.814
Boy, it was largely unsanctioned.

44:27.071 --> 44:31.713
In February 2001, White needed a home for the first fight of his regime.

44:32.633 --> 44:33.894
None of the venues wanted this.

44:34.414 --> 44:35.194
They didn't believe in it.

44:35.234 --> 44:35.915
They didn't like it.

44:36.375 --> 44:40.176
And they were worried about the type of crowd that would show up for this type of event.

44:42.477 --> 44:48.860
He found hospitality at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, then owned by a familiar fight fan, Donald Trump.

44:49.707 --> 44:59.994
When the Trump brand was here and the UFC brand was down there, he saw it and said, I'd love to have this at my... So what are we talking about with old friends again?

45:01.395 --> 45:02.996
What do we say with old friends?

45:03.056 --> 45:09.441
That they're able to pull things off that, you know, people that don't have that level of trust could pull off.

45:09.541 --> 45:16.346
You know, you could get in an argument, you could speak out against one another and no trusting that we're still, you know, buddies.

45:18.618 --> 45:22.263
And the bigger the stage, the more show business there is.

45:22.423 --> 45:30.833
Can you imagine the idea that Dana White and Donald Trump got together and came up with some ideas about how to inflate both of their images?

45:30.873 --> 45:35.779
You can't imagine that these two guys might not, I mean, he produces a, a,

45:38.058 --> 45:44.944
a series of fights where they, you know, everybody comes in with rock music and fireworks and a video behind them.

45:44.964 --> 45:47.486
And you don't think he's thinking about marketing.

45:47.526 --> 45:50.369
You don't think Donald Trump is thinking about, see what I mean?

45:51.170 --> 45:54.052
And it goes all the way back to the Trump Taj Mahal.

45:54.393 --> 45:54.953
Beautiful.

45:55.554 --> 45:59.277
You know, he showed up the first prelim fight of the night.

46:00.444 --> 46:02.085
and stayed till the main event was over.

46:02.165 --> 46:03.006
He watched the whole card?

46:03.026 --> 46:03.826
Watched the whole card.

46:04.307 --> 46:07.208
What did the balance sheets look like back in those early days?

46:07.228 --> 46:12.552
I mean, it was so bad that at one point, Lorenzo called me and said, Dana, I can't keep doing this, man.

46:12.592 --> 46:16.014
I'm literally blowing all my family's money.

46:16.554 --> 46:18.656
And obviously that night, I'm thinking, we're done.

46:18.756 --> 46:19.236
It's a wrap.

46:19.396 --> 46:20.297
This is over.

46:20.377 --> 46:24.800
And he calls me the next day, and literally this is what he said to me.

46:26.510 --> 46:27.150
Let's keep going.

46:27.631 --> 46:28.251
So they did.

46:28.811 --> 46:29.372
It's weird.

46:29.632 --> 46:30.012
I don't know.

46:30.112 --> 46:33.154
Sometimes I have the feeling that literally is a giveaway.

46:33.774 --> 46:39.478
The more you use that word, the more likely it is that you're telling a story that isn't true.

46:39.678 --> 46:43.040
I don't know how to say it any more succinctly than that.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.541
I think that's a giveaway word.

46:45.722 --> 46:46.802
Do you want to be a fighter?

46:47.242 --> 46:51.145
A reality series and its storylines help draw in millions of fans.

46:51.889 --> 47:13.306
obviously a massive massive accomplishment electric matchups and joe rogan on the mic kept it rolling oh he's done he's done from the beginning white imposed his will just asked the guys in the live tv production truck that didn't follow his door now of course it also involves joe rogan and we're all well aware of that but it's an interesting additional layer to the

47:13.846 --> 47:16.128
to the pastrami sandwich that we're building here.

47:16.168 --> 47:27.297
I'm not suggesting that this is the, you know, the piece of the puzzle that makes everything else fit together, but it's definitely somewhere on the table and it does fit together.

47:28.484 --> 47:36.425
And unfortunately, because of so many other connections that we've found, this starts to become quite significant in my humble opinion.

47:36.465 --> 47:48.848
And again, it doesn't mean that Dana White is in on it from a human genome perspective and that he's smoking cigars with Kevin McKernan looking at, you know, data or something like that.

47:49.648 --> 47:56.489
I just mean that, you know, it's a network of friends, a network of oligarchs, a network of, of, of.

48:00.214 --> 48:10.139
financially able people that have the financial means to have a public image that is managed and can be leveraged.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.161
It's not to say that these people aren't smart.

48:15.342 --> 48:26.310
I don't think that if Donald Trump and you or Donald Trump and I could sit in a room that we would be mystified by his idiocy within an hour.

48:26.370 --> 48:27.611
I don't think that's true.

48:27.711 --> 48:38.440
I bet you we would have a very fascinating conversation with the guy because I don't think it's possible that any of the people that are playing us like this are idiots.

48:39.884 --> 48:52.389
I just think they are so thoroughly trained and so thoroughly a part of something that it would be hard for them to see it.

48:53.129 --> 48:57.871
They've been participating for so long, and more importantly, we can't be right about everything.

48:59.338 --> 49:12.004
We're making a educated guess after years of trying to understand what it is that these people are doing and after years of slowly figuring it out that they're not doing what they say they were doing and who's they?

49:12.444 --> 49:18.647
It's all of these people that are loosely associated with Donald Trump and including him.

49:19.867 --> 49:23.209
It just seems like a bunch of very disingenuous actors.

49:24.309 --> 49:27.452
that whenever they need to, they invoke God or the Lord.

49:28.093 --> 49:32.057
And it's weird, because they're wrong about so much stuff.

49:32.497 --> 49:36.842
And they've talked smack about so much stuff, but they're not right about it.

49:40.114 --> 49:43.518
And so could we just be a bunch of lemmings being controlled?

49:43.538 --> 49:44.899
I think it's possible.

49:45.159 --> 49:45.520
Reaction.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.243
I literally got up from my seat, went back there and kicked the door open to the truck.

49:49.324 --> 49:50.164
They just obeyed the boss.

49:50.204 --> 49:50.405
Yeah.

49:50.985 --> 49:52.327
Kicked the door open to the truck.

49:52.887 --> 49:57.112
You know, I was basically like, you ever do this again, I'm firing every one of you.

49:58.004 --> 49:59.844
Long story short, we ended up firing everybody.

49:59.904 --> 50:02.225
I mean, see, we're not learning anything about him at all.

50:02.265 --> 50:03.705
I don't even know what that means.

50:03.805 --> 50:05.085
It's not even significant.

50:05.125 --> 50:15.647
At least when Alex Karp was interviewed on 60 Minutes all those years ago, he said that he went and studied how people know things, you know, like, and that already tells you what he means.

50:15.667 --> 50:19.148
He wants to know how people know things so that he can make them know something else.

50:21.208 --> 50:22.889
It's been an honor calling your fight, sir.

50:23.129 --> 50:24.069
Thank you very much.

50:24.089 --> 50:24.649
You're welcome.

50:25.066 --> 50:27.990
By 2016, the sport sanctioned in every state.

50:28.250 --> 50:30.813
Isn't that guy running for president of Ireland?

50:30.874 --> 50:32.135
I mean, come on.

50:32.716 --> 50:37.943
The UFC sold for $4 billion on the condition White stay on as CEO.

50:41.493 --> 50:47.656
President Trump still routinely shows up at UFC fights, but now makes a grand entrance.

50:48.396 --> 50:54.619
The relationship that he and I have, and when we get together and I have dinner with him, we don't talk politics.

50:55.240 --> 50:55.980
What do you talk about?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.021
We talk about goofy guy stuff that all guys talk about.

50:58.301 --> 50:58.881
You know what I mean?

50:59.102 --> 50:59.502
Like what?

51:00.022 --> 51:01.303
We talk about Rocky movies.

51:01.363 --> 51:03.204
We talk about different fights that have happened.

51:03.744 --> 51:04.804
That's a real samurai.

51:05.505 --> 51:10.007
White's office is a shrine to guy stuff, the mother of all man caves.

51:10.728 --> 51:13.109
This is a piece of art that represents war.

51:13.369 --> 51:14.449
War is all about money.

51:14.990 --> 51:17.290
You once used a term with me that I quoted you on.

51:17.390 --> 51:19.591
This is a piece of art.

51:19.971 --> 51:30.575
I mean... I'm pretty sure that's kind of a... It's kind of a... I mean... The wussification of America.

51:30.595 --> 51:33.436
I think I said... But, yeah, I get it.

51:33.576 --> 51:34.796
We're on 60 minutes, yeah.

51:35.197 --> 51:36.477
Has the pendulum swung the other way?

51:37.157 --> 51:38.878
I feel like it's starting to.

51:40.799 --> 51:43.821
Cage fighting has always celebrated male bravado.

51:46.502 --> 51:49.704
But White is intent that more women than ever follow the sport.

51:50.345 --> 51:54.767
He bristles at the suggestion that UFC fandom is taking on new edge.

51:55.388 --> 51:57.949
You don't think there's this cultural movement.

51:58.370 --> 52:01.972
It's a lot of guys, call it the manosphere, you're one of the leaders.

52:02.672 --> 52:03.413
You don't talk about

52:04.309 --> 52:05.472
knowing your fan base.

52:05.572 --> 52:07.196
Again, this is enchantment.

52:07.356 --> 52:12.027
This is actually casting a spell right now that there is some kind of movement.

52:13.081 --> 52:23.463
of young men that follows him, that follows, I don't know, maybe they read Jordan Peterson's book and now they're putting their big boy pants on and taking responsibility, making their bed.

52:23.923 --> 52:31.584
But the idea, again, is that there is such a movement and that is the enchantment.

52:31.764 --> 52:41.426
Any movement that they're talking about that has anything to do with him being a leader is because of social media and the collective effort to make it so.

52:45.546 --> 52:46.326
Knowing who they are.

52:46.806 --> 52:48.387
Who are they?

52:48.407 --> 52:50.988
18 to 34-year-old males and growing global.

52:51.528 --> 52:56.950
We are definitely unapologetically masculine.

52:57.270 --> 52:59.071
Can this bubble over to too much?

52:59.111 --> 53:01.732
When you hear toxic masculinity, what do you mean?

53:01.772 --> 53:02.392
What's that mean?

53:02.732 --> 53:03.272
You tell me.

53:03.352 --> 53:03.532
No.

53:04.133 --> 53:04.873
You just said it.

53:04.913 --> 53:06.413
What's the definition of toxic?

53:06.513 --> 53:08.054
How can somebody be too masculine?

53:08.484 --> 53:18.367
I wonder if, I don't know, whipping yourself in the street with large groups of men, is that too much, is that too masculine?

53:19.787 --> 53:22.908
Would raping and pillaging a village be too masculine?

53:24.569 --> 53:32.211
Would taking slaves of different races because you find them sexually enticing and want some concubines, would that be too masculine?

53:33.342 --> 53:38.046
I don't know, would sleeping with children be too masculine?

53:38.066 --> 53:41.749
I mean, how do we define what they're talking about here?

53:42.050 --> 53:43.571
Because there is nothing here.

53:44.052 --> 53:49.336
You're supposed to fill that in with whatever your definition of masculinity is.

53:49.737 --> 53:53.180
So if your definition of masculinity extends all the way to,

53:53.720 --> 54:00.085
you know, raping a village, then I guess there is too much and there can be toxic masculinity, or maybe not.

54:00.545 --> 54:06.089
Maybe this guy thinks that's just on the spectrum of masculinity and society can't have too much.

54:06.129 --> 54:08.571
Do you see how screwed up that question is?

54:09.091 --> 54:10.612
Nevermind how that answered.

54:11.933 --> 54:12.414
Wow.

54:13.494 --> 54:14.435
Is that a possibility?

54:14.475 --> 54:15.436
Can you be too masculine?

54:15.456 --> 54:15.916
Do you tell me?

54:15.936 --> 54:15.976
No.

54:16.476 --> 54:17.057
Do you think so?

54:17.217 --> 54:18.258
The answer is hell no.

54:20.495 --> 54:25.518
Hang out with Dana White in Vegas, and odds are good you'll end up here at the Bellagio.

54:25.698 --> 54:26.639
Hi, how are you guys?

54:26.659 --> 54:28.440
Good to see you.

54:28.540 --> 54:29.241
Thank you.

54:29.321 --> 54:34.624
I mean, any intelligent conversation about masculinity would start by defining it.

54:37.486 --> 54:45.432
And that's the reason why you can see this is bullshit, why it's really exquisite fifth-generation warfare.

54:46.243 --> 54:47.884
because it fits everybody.

54:48.584 --> 54:51.706
It's like a hat that anybody can put on.

54:51.766 --> 54:57.530
And if you like, I don't know, if you like the brill here, and then you can put it in the front.

54:57.570 --> 55:00.011
If you like the brill in the back, you can also do it that way.

55:00.451 --> 55:08.136
And so if you think masculinity, if you think masculinity means this or that or the other, and so it's totally a magic spell.

55:10.643 --> 55:25.252
that ends up with the vast majority of people who are watching think that that's a valid discussion, a valid concept, and that everybody kind of more or less agrees about what masculinity is, and therefore it's only a question of whether too much of it is toxic.

55:31.556 --> 55:36.419
Regular, he's plied with whiskey and a cigar before heading to a private Baccarat table.

55:36.679 --> 55:38.320
In this city, nothing is off limits.

55:40.282 --> 55:41.843
How much are we betting here?

55:41.983 --> 55:44.304
In this city, nothing is off limits.

55:44.364 --> 55:45.545
I mean, why does he say that?

55:45.605 --> 55:57.570
Because, again, he's laying down a little bit of a narrative here that, you know, the rich people can do whatever they want, almost anything they want, because they can't bet more than $400,000 a hand on Baccarat.

55:57.590 --> 55:58.011
The $400,000 hand?

55:58.111 --> 55:58.671
Mm-hmm.

55:59.291 --> 56:04.474
Because these sissies won't give me a million a hand.

56:06.015 --> 56:08.696
A few hands in, fortune was not in his corner.

56:11.940 --> 56:12.460
No bueno.

56:12.801 --> 56:17.303
So they bleeped out pussification, but they didn't bleep out goddammit?

56:18.504 --> 56:21.386
That's actually what just happened on 60 Minutes in 2025.

56:22.406 --> 56:28.010
They bleeped out pussification, but they didn't bleep out goddammit.

56:30.111 --> 56:30.891
Did you catch that?

56:35.134 --> 56:35.854
We're down a million, 240.

56:37.967 --> 56:38.567
You heard right.

56:38.727 --> 56:40.548
He was down $1.2 million.

56:41.308 --> 56:42.189
What's this feeding in you?

56:42.829 --> 56:43.969
I'm a sick, sick guy.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.851
That's the only explanation I can give you.

56:48.531 --> 56:49.692
Not 10 minutes later.

56:49.712 --> 56:51.112
Boom, let's go.

56:51.132 --> 56:53.833
Come on, where's the steaks?

56:56.614 --> 56:58.495
He was cashing out up $700,000.

57:01.215 --> 57:08.421
Wait, so he won $700,000 and then the way it works is that they give you $700,000 in cash?

57:08.901 --> 57:10.262
Are you freaking shitting me?

57:10.302 --> 57:13.244
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen on television.

57:13.284 --> 57:15.586
And this is actually in 2025.

57:16.227 --> 57:23.012
Is he gonna put it in his little gay backpack here and carry it out?

57:24.213 --> 57:25.133
Are you shitting me?

57:25.934 --> 57:28.036
This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

57:30.882 --> 57:31.642
What's he gonna do?

57:31.722 --> 57:33.143
Go pay for the taxi now?

57:33.603 --> 57:34.843
He's gonna hand these out?

57:34.883 --> 57:36.144
He's gonna keep it off book?

57:36.584 --> 57:40.465
What is implied here other than something really obviously dumb?

57:40.945 --> 57:42.646
Holy shit is that dumb.

57:43.926 --> 57:47.507
This is how we do it.

57:47.567 --> 57:48.207
It's not.

57:48.647 --> 57:51.248
It's definitely not how you do it.

57:51.308 --> 57:52.469
That is so dumb.

57:52.489 --> 57:54.229
Oh my gosh.

57:55.049 --> 57:59.691
His gut proved golden once again in August when Paramount Skydance outbid others

58:01.471 --> 58:06.315
and offered the UFC $7.7 billion over seven years for U.S.

58:06.415 --> 58:10.679
media rights, putting the UFC right up there with other major sports leagues.

58:11.179 --> 58:12.681
You still have 10% of this enterprise?

58:14.562 --> 58:20.087
I have a deal here that would make Roger Goodell and every other guy go, holy s**t.

58:21.075 --> 58:21.555
Meaning what?

58:22.135 --> 58:23.056
I got a damn good deal.

58:23.516 --> 58:26.197
Listen man, this business has worked just fine.

58:26.597 --> 58:27.697
The model isn't broken.

58:27.717 --> 58:32.279
You know, I love when people who have no idea what they're talking about.

58:32.639 --> 58:34.200
One question that hounds white.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.320
Here we go round two.

58:35.540 --> 58:38.981
Does enough of the UFC's big money see its way to the fighters?

58:40.962 --> 58:42.923
The big stars can make millions per fight.

58:44.623 --> 58:47.565
But so called bottom of the card fighters are paid as little as $12,000.

58:50.086 --> 58:54.692
Earlier this year, the UFC settled a class action antitrust lawsuit with fighters.

58:54.853 --> 58:56.134
To me, that doesn't bother me.

58:56.215 --> 58:57.356
It's completely irrelevant.

58:57.416 --> 59:06.168
Thinking about it as a one-on-one basketball league where the top of the card, one-on-one basketball games, the winner gets, I don't know,

59:07.209 --> 59:27.500
a million dollars and there's a best best game of the night thing where you get a $25,000 bonus then getting $12,000 to train as a one-on-one basketball player with you know that's not that bad I mean you know you could imagine bartending and training on the side for a while until everything works out where you make your big break but

59:28.921 --> 59:32.725
To me, this part of the thing is irrelevant.

59:32.825 --> 59:39.573
It's just a question of what have they allowed to become worth a billion dollars?

59:39.653 --> 59:45.639
Because I don't think that things become worth a billion dollars very often by chance.

59:45.839 --> 59:47.021
It takes a

59:47.841 --> 59:54.987
a confluence of government and non-government interests in order for something to become this big.

59:55.167 --> 59:57.869
It's just, I believe that wholeheartedly.

59:58.009 --> 01:00:06.636
Otherwise, the idea of having really good school lunches that all the kids in American schools want to eat wouldn't be a crazy one.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:12.159
You know, and it would catch fire and go places because you know, that's how good ideas work.

01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:16.800
But there is no actual impetus in the system for that to happen.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.101
Therefore it doesn't happen.

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:25.884
Whereas for some reason there was an impetus in the system for this to become a multi-billion dollar industry.

01:00:27.567 --> 01:00:29.751
for 375 million dollars.

01:00:30.372 --> 01:00:32.635
Your media rights deal basically doubled.

01:00:33.116 --> 01:00:35.980
Is fighter pay going to increase proportionally?

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:42.169
I can't sit here right now and tell you, you know, it's double, it's one and a half, it's triple, but fighter pay is

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:43.859
It's gonna be good.

01:00:44.299 --> 01:00:45.760
Do you pay fighters a fair wage?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.000
Absolutely.

01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:50.242
People don't know how much a lot of these guys make.

01:00:50.582 --> 01:00:54.604
If you want to know what LeBron James makes, it's two keystrokes away.

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.084
We're different in a lot of ways.

01:00:56.164 --> 01:00:58.425
We're different than most major sports.

01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:03.707
And this is the only sport where the athletes get to say whatever they want.

01:01:03.987 --> 01:01:04.748
Wow!

01:01:04.868 --> 01:01:10.970
So 60 Minutes is promoting the UFC as the only sport with free speech.

01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:17.547
I have no response.

01:01:17.987 --> 01:01:18.748
Stop lying.

01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:25.570
I don't know why that thing will play through all of the tracks at some point.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.210
It's just like a goofy little cheap thing.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.371
I might have to fix that.

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:39.114
I have this de-juiced Serato Hercules kind of toy DJ thing that I don't think any serious DJ would consider this equipment.

01:01:39.874 --> 01:01:41.895
Um, and so sometimes it just doesn't work perfect.

01:01:41.955 --> 01:01:42.155
And I,

01:01:43.243 --> 01:01:46.267
I hit the buzzer, but then it'll play through the whole soundtrack anyway.

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:46.807
Sorry about that.

01:01:47.728 --> 01:01:48.389
Another difference.

01:01:48.689 --> 01:01:52.574
In most sports, offensive speech by athletes can result in suspension.

01:01:53.014 --> 01:01:54.516
Not so the UFC.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:55.777
We don't have to agree with it.

01:01:56.638 --> 01:01:57.499
We don't have to like it.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:03.947
That's very simple if all of your broadcasts are rated for adults only because of the violence and blood, right?

01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:13.903
That's a pretty simple thing, whereas if you're on network television and you're supposed to be on network television when families are watching, there's like a restriction on that.

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:20.949
So it's an interesting way of portraying them as, you know, they're the leaders of free speech or something like that.

01:02:20.989 --> 01:02:22.551
They're making the choice to do it.

01:02:22.611 --> 01:02:23.252
I mean, I don't know.

01:02:23.852 --> 01:02:26.194
So is there anything a fighter can say, tweet, do?

01:02:28.086 --> 01:02:31.488
that you say, you know... Is there a lot of betting on these matches?

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:33.148
What a great question, Catherine.

01:02:33.188 --> 01:02:35.950
Of course there is.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.471
You know what?

01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:39.791
There got to be consequences.

01:02:40.652 --> 01:02:47.475
I'm a big believer in free speech, and unfortunately, probably the most important speech to protect is hate speech.

01:02:48.134 --> 01:02:49.435
You're not a fan of cancel culture.

01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:50.735
No, I hate it.

01:02:51.536 --> 01:02:52.176
On both sides.

01:02:52.276 --> 01:02:55.537
It's like all the stuff that's going on with Charlie right now.

01:02:56.938 --> 01:03:02.340
You know, these people are going out and saying stuff, and you're seeing people getting fired or kicked out of school.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.341
You don't think they should be fired?

01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:08.243
I think you're a disgusting human being if you're celebrating the death of another human being.

01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:12.225
But people make mistakes, and people are going to do dumb things.

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.907
I don't like trying to destroy people's lives.

01:03:17.207 --> 01:03:19.269
over doing something dumb.

01:03:20.951 --> 01:03:23.333
So we're going to be here on the White House lawn.

01:03:24.013 --> 01:03:26.575
Top of mind for White, a fight card next summer.

01:03:27.016 --> 01:03:30.078
So the fighters will walk out of the Oval Office to come to the Octagon.

01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:34.222
The same man who once... I mean, it's almost like the penultimate

01:03:35.703 --> 01:03:51.103
sort of act you know right before the entire system collapses right before everything is revealed to have been a shit show for the last 25 years they have this next summer i mean it's

01:03:53.146 --> 01:03:56.487
It's scripted terrifying is what it is in my imagination.

01:03:56.807 --> 01:04:01.509
Offered white a casino for staging the UFC now has offered his backyard.

01:04:01.949 --> 01:04:03.129
What can you tell me about the card?

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.430
Everybody wants to fight on the card.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:10.392
There's going to be a fight on the South Lawn of the White House way ends at the Lincoln Memorial.

01:04:11.332 --> 01:04:12.973
I still can't believe I'm saying those words.

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.655
Even an optimist like you... I can't believe I'm hearing them.

01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:21.499
Inspiring the awe... This will hardly mark White's first trip to the halls of power.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.143
At President Trump's inauguration, he got the equivalent of a cage-side seat.

01:04:26.603 --> 01:04:30.566
What do you say to the fans who say, I feel like the UFC is taken aside?

01:04:31.186 --> 01:04:33.227
And that's just because, why?

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:34.368
Because he's rich?

01:04:35.509 --> 01:04:37.310
Because they all like UFC?

01:04:38.755 --> 01:04:41.816
because they like to eat at that casino's restaurant?

01:04:42.977 --> 01:05:05.648
How can you explain him being there unless you, again, recall what they said at the very beginning of the show, he's on the board of META, one of the military social control programs of the military social program suite that we have come accustomed to calling social media, which is exactly the opposite.

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:08.840
That's why he's sitting there.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.702
Not because of UFC's fantastic success.

01:05:15.682 --> 01:05:23.945
You need to see the fantastic success of part of the reason why he's on Meadows' board and why he's sitting there.

01:05:24.805 --> 01:05:26.386
It's manufactured.

01:05:28.606 --> 01:05:29.787
I am an American citizen.

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:31.888
Biden was my president.

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:34.188
Trump is my president.

01:05:34.709 --> 01:05:35.829
I was at the inauguration.

01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:39.504
And I was sitting behind all the ex-presidents.

01:05:40.084 --> 01:05:44.588
And there was this stuff going around like, Dana's mad dogging President Obama.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:52.854
President Obama turned around, the only president that did, and shook my hand and said, congratulations on all your success.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.024
And I said, thank you very much, Mr. President.

01:05:56.044 --> 01:05:57.665
People wondered what you guys were talking about.

01:05:57.705 --> 01:05:58.365
That's what happened.

01:05:58.385 --> 01:05:59.786
I've never talked about that publicly.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:06.588
And maybe the other thing that he did was press his thumb on his knuckle to make sure that he understood that they're all in the same club.

01:06:06.688 --> 01:06:13.051
Or maybe he did something else, which he didn't reveal here, so that they know that they're all in the same club.

01:06:13.111 --> 01:06:15.072
It's something like that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:21.735
It's something very terrifying and right in front of your face, most of the time on 60 Minutes.

01:06:23.228 --> 01:06:29.753
If President Obama called and said, hey, I'd like to come see a fight, we'd be like, yeah, buy some tickets and good luck here, whatever.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:37.178
No, the sitting president or an ex-president of the United States wants to come to your event, you treat them with respect.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.461
Meanwhile, White's tent is expanding.

01:06:41.882 --> 01:06:45.765
Two weeks ago, he promoted championship boxing under the UFC umbrella.

01:06:46.621 --> 01:06:51.345
almost 71,000 people, and it was the third biggest fight ever in the history of boxing.

01:06:51.825 --> 01:06:52.506
You're saying it went well?

01:06:53.147 --> 01:06:53.827
It didn't suck.

01:06:55.188 --> 01:06:56.950
Enjoy yourself tonight and have a good time.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.230
Thank you.

01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:01.534
After a big fight weekend, most execs might give their staff a pat on the back.

01:07:01.994 --> 01:07:04.156
Relax, drink, and smoke some cigars.

01:07:04.216 --> 01:07:04.936
Have a good night.

01:07:05.837 --> 01:07:09.961
Now, understand, one of the things that these people create are believers, you know?

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:14.504
Like, if you are enchanted by him because he's a real guy,

01:07:15.475 --> 01:07:23.040
And he has had success, but I'm suggesting that the success is on a galactic proportion by design.

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:28.964
Nobody is making $4 billion deals by accident.

01:07:29.604 --> 01:07:36.628
Nobody is selling a franchise for $150 million because they tweeted the wrong thing.

01:07:37.129 --> 01:07:38.510
That is by design.

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:53.598
That is by orchestrated design, where people are ready to go, where groups of people are ready to go, and then something happens, and then they agree that, oh, we're gonna all just tell the same story, that, I don't know, I just saw a bargain and I bought it.

01:07:54.939 --> 01:07:58.600
I just tweeted this, and then everybody got mad, and so I sold it.

01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:00.962
It's just that kind of bullshit.

01:08:01.837 --> 01:08:10.421
You know, I bought it for $6 billion because I wanted to restore free speech to the virtual town square.

01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:17.085
I just wanted to have a bookstore that everybody got the books right at their house and now I own Amazon.

01:08:17.465 --> 01:08:18.786
It's all bullshit.

01:08:19.026 --> 01:08:27.590
These people are on a bullshit script because they know they could never be where they are without the help of the national security state.

01:08:29.771 --> 01:08:30.892
Understand that.

01:08:32.307 --> 01:08:33.128
That that.

01:08:34.489 --> 01:08:36.210
Absolutely foundational truth.

01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:42.975
These people understand that they would not be where they are if it wasn't for the help of the national security state.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:48.259
At some point in time, they stopped asking questions about how am I getting so freaking lucky?

01:08:51.682 --> 01:08:56.045
The bluntest instrument in all sports through his staff a weeknight bash.

01:08:57.486 --> 01:08:58.787
We asked around about you.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.209
One word came up again and again.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.910
You know what it was?

01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:02.911
Loyal.

01:09:03.992 --> 01:09:04.192
Boom.

01:09:04.212 --> 01:09:04.953
Yeah.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.875
Got some detractors, too.

01:09:06.895 --> 01:09:08.516
You want to guess this one?

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:09.157
What?

01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:10.378
Bully.

01:09:10.858 --> 01:09:11.139
Bully?

01:09:11.619 --> 01:09:12.280
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.701
You don't seem so bothered by that.

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:15.142
Yeah, I love it.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:19.166
Listen, if you want to be my friend, I'm the best friend you'll ever have.

01:09:19.566 --> 01:09:20.427
You want to be my enemy?

01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:22.069
I'm really good at being that, too.

01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:27.773
What a season premiere for 60 Minutes.

01:09:28.094 --> 01:09:28.374
Right?

01:09:28.615 --> 01:09:29.778
What a season premiere.

01:09:33.246 --> 01:09:39.168
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:46.610
Intramuscular ejection is dumb, RNA cannot pandemic, transfection is a crime, and autism is a myth.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:51.091
I'm part of a small movement called the Independent Bright Web.

01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:54.592
This is Rocktober on the Independent Bright Web.

01:09:54.612 --> 01:09:56.253
We're gonna do a little rockin' later on.

01:09:57.054 --> 01:09:59.696
And hopefully we're going to rock the whole month.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:01.437
Get off social media.

01:10:01.478 --> 01:10:03.059
This is a warning for you and your kids.

01:10:03.079 --> 01:10:03.800
You gotta get off.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.725
These myths are only possible, these movements are only possible through the use of social media.

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.287
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being here.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.349
Thanks for your support.

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:17.732
I got a lot of shoutouts today that I can't really all list them all.

01:10:18.893 --> 01:10:34.323
Joe Marshall and Stephanie Marshall gave this month and I can't thank them enough because Joe is doing fantastic work as well and puts a lot of time into what he does on Rumble and the Liberty perspective and so a big shout out to them.

01:10:34.403 --> 01:10:35.444
Thank you very much for

01:10:36.244 --> 01:10:40.147
You know, the last time he donated to the stream, he actually sent bushmeat.

01:10:41.128 --> 01:10:47.394
So I do appreciate the fact that although we do like bushmeat, this one was a little better.

01:10:48.534 --> 01:10:53.359
Ladies and gentlemen, why the cheese is free on social media is the question of the day.

01:10:53.939 --> 01:10:55.861
And the way out is the biology.

01:10:56.081 --> 01:10:58.083
Answer is all tied on basic.

01:10:58.903 --> 01:11:05.030
Um, the Antwoord, Antwoord, Antwoord, the Antwoord is all tied on VASIC, so it's something you're gonna hear a little later.

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:09.175
Um, and it's, it's, the answer is always available.

01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:10.016
Um...

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:12.007
It's one big cast.

01:11:12.528 --> 01:11:13.668
They all trust the script.

01:11:14.068 --> 01:11:32.137
And if we want to make America real again, we need an independent bright web, a bunch of people that are just not employed to disseminate a narrative, not confused, but actually clear with clarity, can say things like autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make intramuscular injection.

01:11:32.717 --> 01:11:41.103
make sure intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, to make sure virology is never questioned as a science, to make sure public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:11:41.123 --> 01:11:43.825
And they've done the same thing with pandemics and gain-of-function.

01:11:44.586 --> 01:11:56.414
And they will continue to do so until you stop using social media to learn biology and start coming to GigaOM Biological, start relearning the history of these mentors on Housatonic Live.

01:11:56.935 --> 01:11:59.317
Once you see that these ideas aren't, you know,

01:12:00.373 --> 01:12:09.079
proven truths, but are actually just assumptions that students of students have been following, you will see it for what it is.

01:12:09.099 --> 01:12:10.900
And I'm really excited.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:17.384
I'm really, really excited because I think we're making more progress than we've ever made before because we've got the right message.

01:12:18.004 --> 01:12:20.046
We're trying to show our children the truth.

01:12:20.896 --> 01:12:24.401
We're trying to teach our children why the cheese is free on social media.

01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:26.663
Because the truth isn't available there.

01:12:26.703 --> 01:12:27.845
That's the reality of it.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:33.152
Social media is a military social control software suite.

01:12:34.353 --> 01:12:37.517
And if you stay focused on that truth, America, we can pull our heads out.

01:12:38.539 --> 01:12:46.710
If you stay focused on that truth, you can see past Trump and the Democrats and the show that's being played, the game, the long con.

01:12:47.451 --> 01:12:50.976
But you got to stay focused and you can't take the bait that's on social media.

01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:51.697
You just can't.

01:12:53.539 --> 01:13:06.628
I'm one of the few people in America that can explain to you in detail, for hours, why Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, Meryl Nass, Brian Hooker, Mary Holland, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:06.688 --> 01:13:09.030
and Jay Bhattacharya are all scripted actors.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.032
And I would be happy to do it, it just doesn't seem like any...

01:13:14.634 --> 01:13:21.440
any publications are interested in that, so I do this, and I write it down, and hopefully the book will be done soon.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:34.591
There's actually two books in preparation right now, one for high school seniors, a letter to the children of Earth, and then also a more grown-up Biology 101, but a new one.

01:13:35.632 --> 01:13:40.275
And as we seek the truth over the last six years, it's been pretty easy for me to formulate that over time.

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:41.977
Taken a lot of notes.

01:13:42.637 --> 01:13:48.421
This stuff doesn't exist anywhere on... It doesn't exist anywhere on electronic medium.

01:13:48.861 --> 01:13:53.304
None of these... None of these notebooks are anywhere on the internet.

01:13:53.344 --> 01:14:03.930
So as slow and time-consuming as it is, it is impossible that anyone is going to steal any of the really good ideas I have because I haven't shared them with anybody yet.

01:14:04.671 --> 01:14:09.214
A lot of those ideas have only been explained to my wife while we're on the dog walk not carrying phones.

01:14:10.394 --> 01:14:16.258
And any of the ideas that have been explained, that they've been recorded, they definitely know that there's more to come.

01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:19.479
So, I'm not talking smack here.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.482
I'm just finally coming into my stride after six years.

01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:28.305
And after six years of being repeatedly kicked out of moving trucks.

01:14:29.505 --> 01:14:35.669
I feel like I can finally tell you without a doubt that social media is a military operation.

01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:38.891
It's an elaborate theater and you can't change their script.

01:14:39.211 --> 01:14:53.759
And in fact, they can't change their script because they don't have the expertise to know what they're talking about when they're the science officer on Star Trek or when they're the captain on the Star Trek Enterprise.

01:14:53.779 --> 01:14:54.340
They don't know

01:14:55.523 --> 01:14:58.004
And that's how you need to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:58.044 --> 01:15:00.364
That's even how you need to see Donald Trump.

01:15:02.545 --> 01:15:04.085
They're just very good improvisers.

01:15:04.285 --> 01:15:07.866
They've given a script and they're very good at improvising within it.

01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:14.068
And they've been improvising within that script for so long because they've been scripted actors for so long.

01:15:14.568 --> 01:15:20.990
This time scale of six or seven years, it doesn't work, okay?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:25.236
That timescale is irrelevant.

01:15:25.316 --> 01:15:26.237
It does not work.

01:15:27.559 --> 01:15:28.941
This timescale is too short.

01:15:30.162 --> 01:15:33.646
It's okay for trying to understand what happened with regard to

01:15:34.778 --> 01:15:42.227
the pandemic, but it is absolutely inadequate to understand what happened with regard to the health freedom movement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:15:42.207 --> 01:15:55.042
's rise to prominence and the rise to prominence of those scripted actors who were scripted to oppose him for the last decade and scripted to make no intellectual progress on the argument.

01:15:58.206 --> 01:16:15.901
That's the primary reason why I know, for example, that the story here on the screen about elite pedophiles that released a gain-of-function research generated virus in order to, I don't know, kill people or give everybody flying aids is most certainly incorrect.

01:16:16.622 --> 01:16:23.568
Of course, the Mother Nature virus and the humans are a plague and Trump is everything wrong with the world is also

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:25.994
Incorrect.

01:16:26.514 --> 01:16:49.991
The only real answer to this is that this is for all the marbles that they've seen this coming and the people that believe that, you know, the vast majority of people simply aren't smart enough to govern themselves, deserve to be governed, are motivated by ideas that stem all the way back to the Manhattan Project when we thought we were gonna crack the code of life within a decade.

01:16:50.912 --> 01:16:51.733
And did that happen?

01:16:53.015 --> 01:16:53.776
No, it did not.

01:16:53.956 --> 01:16:58.498
That's the reason why Elon, Jeff, Peter, Alex, Mark, Bobby and Donnie are so ridiculous.

01:16:59.379 --> 01:17:03.361
We don't have a bunch of titans of technocracy in front of us.

01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:05.823
We have a bunch of clowns.

01:17:08.365 --> 01:17:16.069
And they are proof to our rulers, the real people in charge of the weaponized piles of money that run our world.

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:19.732
It's proof to our rulers that we are incapable

01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:24.858
of getting out of the intellectual trap that is social media, i.e.

01:17:24.918 --> 01:17:28.282
a military social control program suite.

01:17:33.469 --> 01:17:34.110
I think it's right.

01:17:35.412 --> 01:17:36.634
I think it's absolutely right.

01:17:39.127 --> 01:17:42.472
And so this bad biology evolution because DNA must be unlearned.

01:17:43.072 --> 01:17:54.167
I would really encourage you to download the PeerTube app because it's working like hell and we're on the way towards setting up a new PeerTube instance for Mark so that we can have two platforms working

01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:59.929
independently, but promoting one another in a very obviously independent way.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:06.331
Chief Wuhan says that the the PeerTube is the antidote to the internet, and I'm very excited about that.

01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:11.093
We've also been able to succinctly say these words better than anybody else.

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.653
I'm just going to leave them up on the screen for a second.

01:18:13.673 --> 01:18:14.714
I have no responsibility.

01:18:14.754 --> 01:18:15.694
And then I'll move on.

01:18:16.614 --> 01:18:18.135
Stop lying!

01:18:18.475 --> 01:18:19.275
And yeah,

01:18:19.955 --> 01:18:21.896
I think this is fifth generation warfare.

01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:29.079
I think you can see it in the way that they are using this fire hose of information to overwhelm us.

01:18:30.119 --> 01:18:31.600
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.600
You definitely can.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.020
You can sort of feel it in people.

01:18:34.801 --> 01:18:35.681
You definitely can.

01:18:35.821 --> 01:18:36.521
And I have lied.

01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:37.582
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:18:37.602 --> 01:18:38.542
I don't want to lie.

01:18:39.563 --> 01:18:40.363
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:41.503
I try not to be a liar.

01:18:41.543 --> 01:18:42.384
I don't want to be a liar.

01:18:42.964 --> 01:18:45.665
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:51.528
And so again, I would encourage you to understand that this is a long script.

01:18:52.169 --> 01:18:58.310
And so a lot of these people have been working together behind the scenes for a long time just as script readers.

01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:00.691
And so they don't need to care anymore.

01:19:01.031 --> 01:19:02.711
They know that they are on stage.

01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:05.372
And so that's why they just read the script that they are given.

01:19:05.932 --> 01:19:08.033
And that script has never included

01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:11.067
That's never included murder and lies.

01:19:11.148 --> 01:19:18.709
It's never included talking about the brief two and a half year period where we just seem to forget how to treat pneumonia.

01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:26.971
The two and a half to five year period where we just didn't do shit about people dying from opioids on the street.

01:19:27.372 --> 01:19:28.952
These illusions

01:19:30.029 --> 01:19:38.978
were created on purpose by a army of theater people on social media that transitioned seamlessly to it.

01:19:39.899 --> 01:19:40.980
Podcast actors.

01:19:42.061 --> 01:19:47.967
And they create a notion that real things are happening there, but there's nothing happening there other than a theater.

01:19:49.028 --> 01:19:50.630
It's a Lollapalooza of liars.

01:19:53.015 --> 01:19:54.596
That's why this line is in level.

01:19:55.117 --> 01:20:01.963
That's why in the population pyramid that any actuary involved in this could have shown you, it's very clear that there's a signal coming.

01:20:02.023 --> 01:20:04.966
Just watch the top of the pyramid and you will see that it doesn't move.

01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.081
Pyramid's not moving.

01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:07.722
Do you see that?

01:20:08.402 --> 01:20:09.102
It's not moving.

01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:15.664
The top of the pyramid doesn't move at all because it's stable over many decades, but they saw this coming.

01:20:16.204 --> 01:20:17.685
Now the pyramid's starting to move.

01:20:18.225 --> 01:20:19.526
See the pyramid starting to move.

01:20:19.686 --> 01:20:26.128
Oh, now the top lines are starting to move just around the time when they anticipated the pandemic.

01:20:29.809 --> 01:20:30.449
Watch it again.

01:20:30.469 --> 01:20:31.430
The top of the pyramid.

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:32.350
Is it moving right now?

01:20:33.123 --> 01:20:34.063
when I was in high school?

01:20:34.383 --> 01:20:35.864
What about when I was in college?

01:20:36.204 --> 01:20:38.224
What about after I graduated from college?

01:20:38.264 --> 01:20:40.145
What about when I was working as a teacher?

01:20:40.185 --> 01:20:42.285
What about when I moved to the Netherlands?

01:20:42.325 --> 01:20:43.845
What about after I met my wife?

01:20:43.885 --> 01:20:45.286
What about when we moved to Norway?

01:20:45.326 --> 01:20:46.086
Is it moving yet?

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:46.966
Do you see it?

01:20:48.967 --> 01:20:51.387
The top of the pyramid doesn't start moving until around 2015.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:55.848
It doesn't start really expanding and doubling until around 2020.

01:20:56.728 --> 01:20:58.889
It was a signal that they saw coming.

01:21:03.154 --> 01:21:22.149
And so it is very significant that these ridiculous organizations full of ridiculous actors that have not made any intellectual progress in more than a decade were formed around the time that the population pyramid bump was starting to manifest itself in real numbers and have real consequences.

01:21:27.158 --> 01:21:37.723
2017 was when at Georgetown University, Tony Fauci said that there would definitely be a pandemic challenge in the Trump administration.

01:21:38.103 --> 01:21:40.384
This is all one malevolent show.

01:21:40.424 --> 01:21:42.305
It is a military operation

01:21:44.406 --> 01:22:03.642
that spans decades that has priorities that supersede free election that supersede free election that's why donald trump is not a real man making real decisions but an actor following a descript that's the reason why robert f kennedy jr is not a real man

01:22:04.062 --> 01:22:14.734
who's been acting for decades to try and save the kids and praying for 30 minutes every day for 20 years until finally God answered his prayers with Donald Trump.

01:22:15.175 --> 01:22:15.936
Stop lying!

01:22:16.597 --> 01:22:17.578
It's not true.

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:30.171
Howard Luddick, great.

01:22:30.551 --> 01:22:32.332
Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

01:22:32.352 --> 01:22:34.034
CMS Administrator.

01:22:34.514 --> 01:22:36.956
Mehmet Oz, Medicare Administrator.

01:22:37.376 --> 01:22:41.019
Chris Klomp and the FDA Commissioner, Marnie McCary.

01:22:41.079 --> 01:22:42.100
And I just want to thank them.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.421
Well, they've been working hard on many, many things.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:54.149
I think this is one of the biggest medical announcements that this office has ever made, because we're talking about price reductions, as you'll see in a couple of minutes, that are incredible.

01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:58.512
For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices anywhere in the world for

01:22:58.919 --> 01:22:59.880
prescription drugs.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:00.941
They paid far more.

01:23:00.961 --> 01:23:03.064
Ten times, 13 times, 15 times more.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.403
And so here we go, this is the script, right?

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:14.048
We're now going to make some kind of deal, $70 billion for Pfizer to make more mRNA stuff.

01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:22.556
Plus we're making some kind of deal where a lot of the drugs that Pfizer makes and other companies make that sell to Medicare are gonna be cheaper.

01:23:23.076 --> 01:23:28.240
And so the cuts to Medicaid and Medicare aren't gonna matter because the drug prices are gonna come down.

01:23:28.701 --> 01:23:30.923
And I was the only one who was ever able to do it.

01:23:34.454 --> 01:23:41.678
And you watch very carefully because the head of Pfizer is standing right next to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:41.778 --> 01:23:47.461
And when they greet one another and shake hands and do whatever, it's not antagonistic.

01:23:47.561 --> 01:23:58.366
It's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's, it's... What you hear, what you see here is not courage.

01:23:59.487 --> 01:24:01.088
And you'll hear it and it's painful.

01:24:01.448 --> 01:24:03.529
Then other countries for the exact same product.

01:24:04.221 --> 01:24:10.024
A major reason is that the American consumers have been subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet.

01:24:11.205 --> 01:24:14.566
They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries, too.

01:24:14.586 --> 01:24:16.828
So it's being changed as of today.

01:24:17.788 --> 01:24:22.130
The United States had just 4 percent of the world's population in consumers.

01:24:22.651 --> 01:24:30.255
Only 13 percent of all prescription drugs yet pharmaceutical companies make 75 percent of their profits from the United States.

01:24:30.275 --> 01:24:30.875
So think of that.

01:24:30.935 --> 01:24:32.276
We have 4 percent of the market.

01:24:33.984 --> 01:24:38.050
13% of prescription drugs, and yet, Albert, I didn't know you were that violent.

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:40.653
I'm surprised you're agreeing to this.

01:24:40.673 --> 01:24:41.354
I'm getting better.

01:24:41.374 --> 01:24:42.175
No, he's doing the right thing.

01:24:42.275 --> 01:24:42.475
Thank you.

01:24:42.535 --> 01:24:44.278
And yet they make 75% of their profits from the American...

01:24:51.184 --> 01:24:57.090
So the head of CMS over here, this guy used to be in the Turkish military.

01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:58.271
He's a Turkish citizen.

01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:08.501
This guy over here is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former heroin addict and placer of dead bear and bike in Central Park as a joke dude.

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:14.273
known testosterone user and muscle head.

01:25:15.654 --> 01:25:21.819
And then of course, Marty McCary is there, who is a Egyptian origin and UK citizen.

01:25:23.261 --> 01:25:34.011
And so there's a lot of weird, you know, Donald Trump, make America great again, has a lot of foreigners in his cabinet, which is interesting, or behind him, which is really interesting.

01:25:34.659 --> 01:25:35.980
customers something.

01:25:36.661 --> 01:25:43.666
That's why I signed an executive order combating this practice, and we signed it very happily a little while ago.

01:25:43.747 --> 01:25:54.575
Today, Pfizer is committing, as will other drug companies as we go through the weeks, but Pfizer is truly one of the biggest in the world and one of the greatest in the world.

01:25:55.136 --> 01:25:59.700
Today, Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid.

01:26:00.802 --> 01:26:02.803
It will be at the most favored nation's prices.

01:26:02.823 --> 01:26:07.926
It's going to have a huge impact on bringing Medicaid costs down like nothing else.

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:14.989
I told you that in my first term, I was so proud of the fact that for the first time in 28 years, drug prices came down.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:18.951
And I had a news conference that explained it was one-tenth of 1%.

01:26:20.052 --> 01:26:20.572
But it was that.

01:26:20.632 --> 01:26:24.474
Make no mistake about it, Bobby never looks healthy or well.

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:25.214
He never does.

01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:26.075
I mean, never.

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:34.933
Even when you see him in the pictures with me where he's smiling, he doesn't look well.

01:26:34.973 --> 01:26:41.315
That's why they need him to have his shirt off and swing from chains or do push-ups because his face doesn't sell it.

01:26:46.499 --> 01:26:55.246
This is a critical step forward to our work and to improve healthcare and hardworking low-income Americans, especially low-income Americans, will be helped so greatly.

01:26:55.306 --> 01:27:05.213
In addition, Pfizer has agreed to provide some of their most popular current medications to all consumers at heavily discounted prices of anywhere between 50 and even 100 percent.

01:27:06.718 --> 01:27:08.599
And that's off, that's off the price.

01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:17.064
And in some cases, even more than that, these drugs will be available for direct purchase online at a website operated by the federal government.

01:27:17.164 --> 01:27:27.349
We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation costs.

01:27:27.389 --> 01:27:30.631
So we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying.

01:27:30.971 --> 01:27:39.619
the Turkish former Turkish soldier is nodding um on cue behind him it's really just it's it's absurd who have been uh

01:27:40.583 --> 01:28:09.131
much lower much much lower for many many years furthermore Pfizer will invest 70 billion dollars to reshore domestic manufacturing facilities in other words they're gonna bring a lot of their uh facilities to make their drugs and make what they make the product look at oh sorry oh my gosh look at this clown look at this clown over here oh my gosh you gotta be kidding me

01:28:12.758 --> 01:28:15.240
Oh my gosh, that is just a joke.

01:28:15.601 --> 01:28:16.501
It's just a joke.

01:28:16.701 --> 01:28:17.742
It's really just a joke.

01:28:18.503 --> 01:28:19.584
Howard Ludnick, great.

01:28:19.984 --> 01:28:23.587
Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CMS Administrator.

01:28:23.687 --> 01:28:26.389
Mehmet Oz, Medicare Administrator.

01:28:26.789 --> 01:28:31.733
Chris, it is that the American consumers have 13% of prescription drugs.

01:28:31.793 --> 01:28:34.756
Truly one of the biggest in the world and one of the greatest in the world.

01:28:35.316 --> 01:28:39.820
Today, Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medic- Uh, what?

01:28:41.474 --> 01:28:41.994
Sorry about that.

01:28:42.814 --> 01:28:43.354
This should be okay.

01:28:43.374 --> 01:28:48.996
Medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most favored nation's prices.

01:28:49.016 --> 01:28:54.117
It's going to have a huge impact on bringing Medicaid costs down like nothing else.

01:28:54.137 --> 01:29:01.138
I told you that in my first term, I was so proud of the fact that, for the first time in 28 years, drug prices came down.

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:06.840
And I had a news conference that I explained it was one-tenth of 1 percent, but it was down.

01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.460
And here we're talking about

01:29:09.743 --> 01:29:11.665
In one case, over 1,000 percent.

01:29:12.586 --> 01:29:21.333
This is a critical step forward to our work and to improve health care in hardworking, low-income Americans, especially low-income Americans, who will be helped so greatly.

01:29:21.373 --> 01:29:31.302
In addition, Pfizer has agreed to provide some of their most popular current medications to all consumers at heavily discounted prices of anywhere between 50 and even 100 percent.

01:29:32.794 --> 01:29:33.535
And that's off.

01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:34.675
That's off the price.

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:43.160
And in some cases, even more than that, these drugs will be available for direct purchase online at a website operated by the federal government.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:53.326
We're also announcing that, moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most-favored-nation cost.

01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:54.987
So we're paying essentially what other countries are paying.

01:29:55.007 --> 01:29:56.788
The Press Sorry, it took me so long to get it back to the spot.

01:29:57.388 --> 01:29:58.909
I didn't want it to goof up, so I shouldn't have.

01:29:58.929 --> 01:29:59.870
The President Much lower.

01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.591
Much, much lower for many, many years.

01:30:02.071 --> 01:30:06.976
Furthermore, Pfizer will invest $70 billion to reshore domestic manufacturing facilities.

01:30:07.077 --> 01:30:14.184
In other words, they're going to bring a lot of their facilities to make their drugs and make what they make their product.

01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:15.706
They're going to make it in the United States.

01:30:15.746 --> 01:30:21.873
I appreciate that $70 billion investment and fund research and development right here in America.

01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:26.396
We're working with other major pharmaceutical companies to secure similar.

01:30:26.496 --> 01:30:29.141
I mean, look at Marty standing there.

01:30:29.301 --> 01:30:32.887
Can I be so bold as to say he looks like he has hips?

01:30:36.032 --> 01:30:36.293
I mean.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.542
It's kind of a goofy profile there.

01:30:40.962 --> 01:30:44.684
I don't want to be, you know, but since this is the man show.

01:30:45.065 --> 01:30:58.773
Agreements, everyone understands that the status quo where Americans pay more for drugs, prescription drugs, and they pay more than foreign countries who take advantage of us in many other ways, although not so many anymore.

01:30:58.814 --> 01:30:59.774
What is he staring at?

01:30:59.794 --> 01:31:01.956
We pretty well got that stopped, right?

01:31:01.976 --> 01:31:02.496
I think so.

01:31:03.076 --> 01:31:06.819
We've stopped that, but they took advantage of a lot of other presidents that I can tell you.

01:31:07.777 --> 01:31:12.865
We're making this pay to be very unacceptable, what they've done in the past.

01:31:12.905 --> 01:31:19.154
That's why my administration is also taking a sort of... It's almost like you really can see it.

01:31:19.314 --> 01:31:21.197
It's a developed schtick.

01:31:22.318 --> 01:31:24.038
The right word is shtick.

01:31:24.459 --> 01:31:25.919
He has perfected this.

01:31:26.339 --> 01:31:32.560
He has a script in front of him and he's improvising through the script and he's really good at it.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:45.304
That's why they have that clip that Jimmy Kimmel used where don't take Tylenol, don't give the baby Tylenol, don't take it, just don't take it, don't take Tylenol, don't take Tylenol, don't give the baby Tylenol.

01:31:45.724 --> 01:31:48.704
That's why they have it because that's his shtick.

01:31:49.064 --> 01:31:51.005
He's very, very good at it.

01:31:51.865 --> 01:31:59.173
And the people who believe it see somebody improvising and thinking on the fly, and a smart guy who never reads a script.

01:32:00.635 --> 01:32:08.744
And the people who can see through it, the gigolo and biological, can see just an improvisational actor at his finest.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:20.764
action to investigate the unfair and discriminatory trade practices of other countries that extort our pharmaceutical makers to shift costs onto the American consumer.

01:32:21.385 --> 01:32:27.487
They say, no, give us a price, a very low price, and just charge the American consumer, charge it to the U.S.

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:31.689
The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world.

01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:33.070
It's a big thing.

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:34.850
I can't tell you how big this is.

01:32:36.522 --> 01:32:40.646
I was all set to go on a first term, but then you had the COVID and we had to focus on that.

01:32:41.406 --> 01:32:43.428
But I said, I want to get back here.

01:32:43.468 --> 01:32:46.671
So because this is you're talking about 14, 15, 1600 percent reductions in some cases.

01:32:49.841 --> 01:33:00.550
But by taking this bold step, we're ending the era of global price gouging at the expense of American families, and we're making America healthy again, which is our little theme for the people behind me.

01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:08.096
And I want to just ask Secretary Kennedy to come up, and we'll start, and we'll go through it with Oz and Klopp and Borla and McCary.

01:33:08.736 --> 01:33:10.818
And we'll go through it, and if you have any questions.

01:33:10.898 --> 01:33:13.580
But this is a really big announcement.

01:33:13.861 --> 01:33:16.363
This is something that most people said was not doable.

01:33:17.265 --> 01:33:26.573
And other countries are going along because we told them that... Don't forget, from this actor's perspective, they've already solved the autism epidemic.

01:33:26.633 --> 01:33:28.835
They already announced the cure.

01:33:29.315 --> 01:33:41.405
In fact, remember that Donald Trump, at the crowd of the Charlie Kirk Memorial, announced that the following day we're going to be announcing the cure or the cause of autism.

01:33:41.465 --> 01:33:42.146
Stay tuned.

01:33:43.322 --> 01:33:45.344
And then they did, and now we're here.

01:33:45.925 --> 01:33:49.028
And it's as if nothing ever happened because it's just a script.

01:33:49.769 --> 01:34:01.921
It's just a script, just like Marty McCary doing a podcast, the FDA podcast with Vinay Prasad and talking about the farmer's market that they have.

01:34:02.081 --> 01:34:06.346
It's all one malevolent shit show.

01:34:07.728 --> 01:34:08.429
Don't go along.

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.130
You know, they didn't have to go along.

01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:19.137
But if they didn't go along, we were going to put extra tariffs on those countries, and we were going to charge them the amount of money that they should be paying for the reduction in costs.

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:23.441
So I think we had a pretty good negotiating position.

01:34:24.181 --> 01:34:25.943
So, Bobby, I'd like you to speak about this.

01:34:26.023 --> 01:34:26.924
And what a great job.

01:34:26.984 --> 01:34:27.744
And thank you very much.

01:34:35.342 --> 01:34:50.575
By thanking a couple of people who aren't up here, Theo Merkel, Dr. Heidi Overton, who played key roles in this negotiation and helped make this happen, and also Inma Hernandez, who's not up here, but John Brooke and Chris Klomp, who were

01:34:51.873 --> 01:34:58.996
people who are negotiating, in some case, I think including last night, 24 hours without any sleep.

01:35:00.516 --> 01:35:03.077
This would not have happened without President Trump's leadership.

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:13.441
I told my son last, we're all under secrecy about this, but I told my son late last night, my 27 year old son, Conor, who's a very liberal Democrat.

01:35:13.861 --> 01:35:18.463
Is Conor the one that went to the Ukraine to be a machine gunner for a while?

01:35:19.975 --> 01:35:30.079
Ask yourself that question, because when he was running for president, he told everybody that Conor, without permission, went to the Ukraine and volunteered to be a machine gunner.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:41.543
Please do not forget that, because that is a very, very significant... Of course they're under secrecy, because of course there could be all kinds of stock trades made and stuff.

01:35:44.255 --> 01:35:50.479
I told him this was happening and he just paused for a minute and he said, thank you, dad.

01:35:50.539 --> 01:35:51.459
I'm so proud of you.

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.961
Because this is something Democrats have wanted for 20 years.

01:35:55.642 --> 01:35:57.563
Republicans have wanted for 20 years.

01:35:58.583 --> 01:36:00.104
Everybody said they were going to do it.

01:36:00.384 --> 01:36:02.846
Nobody has even taken a step towards doing it.

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:06.541
And the reason was because it was such a daunting task.

01:36:07.621 --> 01:36:12.122
And, you know, even all the negotiators, you see, you also want to thank Howard Lutton.

01:36:12.262 --> 01:36:15.863
I mean, you might also make the argument that it's because God didn't want it yet.

01:36:16.263 --> 01:36:18.504
He'd been praying for this for, like, 20 years.

01:36:18.704 --> 01:36:21.584
Sherry Tenpenny's been praying for it for, like, 20 years.

01:36:22.045 --> 01:36:24.185
But God only answered their prayers this year.

01:36:24.205 --> 01:36:25.465
Maybe it was just God's will.

01:36:25.505 --> 01:36:27.146
You could also spin it that way, right?

01:36:28.406 --> 01:36:29.907
This would not have happened without him.

01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:43.457
But even all of the negotiators here and all the people at HHS and at the White House team, all we could see was all the reasons that this couldn't happen.

01:36:44.617 --> 01:36:45.738
Everybody had tried.

01:36:46.118 --> 01:36:47.299
Nobody could make it happen.

01:36:48.286 --> 01:37:04.954
And it was President Trump alone who, with his doggedness, his persistence, he saw this clearly in a way that none of us either, in its most simplest terms, why are we spending more on this country than any other country?

01:37:05.014 --> 01:37:07.695
Why are we spending 75% of the revenues?

01:37:07.875 --> 01:37:11.977
So maybe that's the reason, you know, no one else could figure it out but Donald Trump.

01:37:12.757 --> 01:37:41.888
just like none of these jackasses are ever able to get to the point to just say you know it's funny because in America we give our kids a lot more vaccines and the CDC recommends a lot more vaccines than are on a lot of other schedules in the western world the most advanced countries in the world like Denmark and Norway are not giving as many shots as us and that simple fact could be leveraged to point out that there's something wrong with the American vaccine schedule something inherently wrong with it

01:37:42.799 --> 01:37:44.643
And it might just be greed.

01:37:45.204 --> 01:37:49.992
It might just be, you know, these innocent human motivations.

01:37:50.193 --> 01:37:54.481
I don't know, but it could have been said a long time ago, but they don't do it.

01:37:55.816 --> 01:38:05.566
Steve Kirsch is happy to say that the Amish don't have any autism, but Steve Kirsch is so ridiculously scripted that he's never been able to get there.

01:38:06.106 --> 01:38:08.128
Robert Kennedy's never been able to get there.

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.891
Brian Hooker's never been able to get there.

01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:13.253
Meryl Nass has never been able to get there.

01:38:13.313 --> 01:38:15.095
Mary Holland has never been able to get there.

01:38:15.135 --> 01:38:18.599
It's just a big top tent above health freedom that's against mandates.

01:38:19.039 --> 01:38:45.881
and can't seem to figure out that one of the best trump cards you could play is that the rest of the freaking world does not have a vaccine schedule as ridiculous and as early and as often as the united states of freaking america but he's happy to tell you that they pay for more and pay cheaper drug prices over there and it's been there for a long time but only donald trump could figure out the solution by summarizing it so simply

01:38:48.911 --> 01:38:50.632
come to the pharmaceutical industry.

01:38:51.493 --> 01:38:56.716
We're doing all the research and everybody else is riding on our slipstream.

01:38:57.996 --> 01:39:02.219
And president Trump, um, I would say harangued.

01:39:02.499 --> 01:39:10.724
And even if that's true for the people that still believe Donald Trump is an independent actor, it's scripted.

01:39:11.886 --> 01:39:18.467
Even if that's true, this is a low-hanging fruit that is scripted for now.

01:39:19.008 --> 01:39:19.648
That's all.

01:39:20.008 --> 01:39:26.169
And if this guy's too unsophisticated to understand it, I guess that's possible, then he's really an idiot.

01:39:26.249 --> 01:39:27.749
But I don't think it's that simple.

01:39:28.309 --> 01:39:29.490
I think it's much worse.

01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:40.372
These people understand there are many curtains behind which things are happening that they're not supposed to ask questions about because they are part of a governance infrastructure.

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:43.912
They are part of a ruling theater.

01:39:44.452 --> 01:39:49.576
They are employed in real life to play a character.

01:39:52.599 --> 01:39:56.282
They are our Truman Show.

01:39:58.503 --> 01:40:00.265
They are, do you hear it?

01:40:01.185 --> 01:40:02.707
They are, what the hell?

01:40:03.027 --> 01:40:03.767
Oh, I don't have that up.

01:40:04.408 --> 01:40:08.071
They are, they are, there it is.

01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:10.653
They are our Truman Show.

01:40:12.557 --> 01:40:16.538
The podcast actors are our Truman Show.

01:40:17.859 --> 01:40:22.280
These people are the actors that form our Truman Show.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.662
Understand it, because America's trapped in a very bad movie.

01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:34.352
and harassed us to make this happen.

01:40:35.713 --> 01:40:40.617
I was getting calls at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night.

01:40:41.518 --> 01:40:42.498
Oh, are you asleep?

01:40:43.639 --> 01:40:45.581
And you've got to get MFN done.

01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:51.566
And at one point, Dr. Oz told me, I can't take the president's calls anymore.

01:40:52.747 --> 01:40:53.628
I have a lot of reasons.

01:40:53.648 --> 01:40:54.889
My wife has a lot of reasons.

01:40:55.996 --> 01:41:05.818
Say to me about different things that happen in my life and doesn't that make give you anxiety and I say I don't get anxiety Is it possible that Donald Trump was calling them?

01:41:06.238 --> 01:41:06.838
Absolutely.

01:41:06.878 --> 01:41:12.239
It is Is it possible that Donald Trump works really hard and doesn't sleep and can have lots of meetings?

01:41:12.319 --> 01:41:12.839
Absolutely.

01:41:12.879 --> 01:41:13.099
It is.

01:41:13.139 --> 01:41:16.600
I'm sure it is It doesn't make him any less scripted.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.340
It makes him even more likely to be scripted.

01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:22.441
It even means more likely the smarter he is

01:41:23.717 --> 01:41:25.338
the more likely he is an actor.

01:41:25.458 --> 01:41:26.800
Why is that the truth?

01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:37.208
Because the highest form of intelligence is the ability to deceive, like it or not.

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:49.638
It takes the most amount of intelligence because you need to be able to effectively put yourself in the position and put yourself into the perspective of the people to which you are lying.

01:41:50.478 --> 01:41:59.661
And the longer you want to sustain the lie, the more complicated or powerful the lie is, the more intelligent you need to be to cast the spell and sustain it.

01:42:01.702 --> 01:42:05.723
So do never, ever mistake me for saying that these people are dumb.

01:42:07.924 --> 01:42:15.807
I just want you to see that what they are scripted to say belies them as national security actors.

01:42:15.867 --> 01:42:17.007
It reveals the truth.

01:42:20.185 --> 01:42:21.406
This gave me anxiety.

01:42:22.406 --> 01:42:24.227
Oh, thank you, President Trump.

01:42:24.287 --> 01:42:26.047
It would not have happened without you.

01:42:26.127 --> 01:42:27.588
This is real leadership.

01:42:28.468 --> 01:42:33.630
It's somebody, a president who has a vision and makes that vision happen.

01:42:33.931 --> 01:42:42.294
So the president has a vision and he makes that happen and the other half of the country believes that he has a vision of destroying America and he's making that happen.

01:42:43.573 --> 01:42:44.714
It's an enchantment.

01:42:45.175 --> 01:42:51.000
It's one malevolent military social control operation.

01:42:52.302 --> 01:42:56.946
America is being undermined by actors that have agreed to sell out our grandchildren.

01:42:57.747 --> 01:43:03.172
And I can't think of any other president of the United States who could have done this in our history.

01:43:04.406 --> 01:43:05.566
I'm very grateful to you.

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:07.327
This is an extraordinary benefit.

01:43:08.247 --> 01:43:11.108
The American people thank you for your vision, President Trump.

01:43:11.909 --> 01:43:16.791
Your bold action, your unwavering commitment to health and well-being of the American people.

01:43:17.611 --> 01:43:22.973
Never has a president stood up so bravely for the American people with respect to healthcare.

01:43:23.413 --> 01:43:27.715
Okay, I'm just gonna stop it right here because I think I can just, I'm gonna do something else here.

01:43:27.755 --> 01:43:29.075
Just look, okay, just look.

01:43:30.156 --> 01:43:31.176
Just, what did he just say?

01:43:32.659 --> 01:43:34.261
What is he saying about Donald Trump?

01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:37.083
By the way, I forgot to thank Albert Burwell.

01:43:37.264 --> 01:43:42.208
Albert and I have had a long history of antipathy and antagonism toward each other.

01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:47.874
But I have to say, his leadership in this took tremendous courage.

01:43:48.395 --> 01:43:51.938
And he really created a template.

01:43:52.399 --> 01:43:54.841
President Trump, it would not have happened without you.

01:43:54.941 --> 01:43:56.362
This is real leadership.

01:43:57.265 --> 01:44:02.428
It's somebody, a president who has a vision and makes that vision happen.

01:44:02.969 --> 01:44:08.492
And I can't think of any other president of the United States who could have done this in our history.

01:44:09.633 --> 01:44:10.813
I'm very grateful to you.

01:44:10.833 --> 01:44:12.594
This is an extraordinary benefit.

01:44:13.495 --> 01:44:16.317
The American people, thank you for your vision, President Trump.

01:44:17.156 --> 01:44:28.203
your bold action your unwavering commitment to health and well-being of the American people never has a president set up so bravely for the American people with respect to health care.

01:44:29.456 --> 01:44:32.740
And I, by the way, I forgot to thank Albert Burleigh.

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:37.885
Albert and I have had a long history of antipathy and antagonism toward each other.

01:44:38.946 --> 01:44:43.551
But I have to say his leadership in this took tremendous courage.

01:44:44.072 --> 01:44:49.277
And he really created a template for corporate responsibility.

01:44:49.317 --> 01:44:51.460
Now, do you want me to prove to you why he's a liar?

01:44:52.557 --> 01:44:57.765
He's gotta be a liar because of what he said about Donald Trump, because of what he said about Albert.

01:44:58.265 --> 01:45:07.819
So he says a little bit about Donnie, he says a little bit about Albert, and I can prove to you that he's a liar by showing you what he said about me.

01:45:09.895 --> 01:45:20.597
And so I'm very willing to accept the fact that he's a liar and very willing to accept the fact that he lies on a script because I have evidence for it.

01:45:21.337 --> 01:45:22.578
I have evidence right here.

01:45:23.258 --> 01:45:25.078
Listen to what he said about me.

01:45:25.098 --> 01:45:32.980
He introduced

01:45:34.042 --> 01:45:52.598
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:45:53.719 --> 01:45:57.042
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

01:45:58.226 --> 01:46:03.790
that we have each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

01:46:04.050 --> 01:46:10.195
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

01:46:10.235 --> 01:46:15.799
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:24.786
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

01:46:26.308 --> 01:46:39.169
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

01:46:40.505 --> 01:46:59.856
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

01:47:02.717 --> 01:47:03.498
He's a fraud.

01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:07.760
He's very clearly a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.321
I'm going to go to the gym.

01:47:10.676 --> 01:47:11.997
Thank you very much for being here.

01:47:12.017 --> 01:47:17.839
I'm very excited that this week is finally here, that the beginning of October is here.

01:47:18.479 --> 01:47:22.320
Because Rocktober means it is time for basketball.

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.182
And so very quickly, basketball season is about to start.

01:47:27.202 --> 01:47:28.502
I'm very excited about it.

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:30.023
My kids are very excited about it.

01:47:31.103 --> 01:47:34.467
There's lots of stuff going on right now that makes me very, very excited.

01:47:35.107 --> 01:47:41.133
So, I'm just going to kind of improvise through the end here and not do everything as fancy as I always do all the time.

01:47:41.894 --> 01:47:44.556
Intramuscular injection, of course, is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:47:46.218 --> 01:47:47.659
Nice sandwich here to get to the gym.

01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:54.464
October 2025 is Rocktober on the intellectual dark, the independent bright web.

01:47:55.205 --> 01:47:58.167
And that means we're going to be here very often in Rocktober.

01:47:58.227 --> 01:48:02.751
I don't know if it's going to be twice a day all the time, but there's going to be a few days or it'll be twice a day.

01:48:03.311 --> 01:48:04.452
And there might be every day.

01:48:04.512 --> 01:48:04.812
I don't know.

01:48:04.832 --> 01:48:06.353
We'll see how we do with Rocktober.

01:48:06.373 --> 01:48:11.878
I don't want to make any promises that I can't keep, but I can tell you that that PeerTube app works pretty damn well.

01:48:12.778 --> 01:48:14.839
And I can tell you that I'm very happy to be here.

01:48:14.879 --> 01:48:19.021
I'm very proud of the place that we are Thank you very much for all of your support.

01:48:19.081 --> 01:48:32.048
Shout out to Joe and Stephanie shout out to Jeff and Kara shout out to William and to Stefan and to Maurice and all the people that are Really?

01:48:32.068 --> 01:48:33.949
I mean you're making it happen.

01:48:34.009 --> 01:48:36.610
This is the first time where we've had rent I

01:48:39.702 --> 01:48:43.003
ready to go at the end of the month in a while.

01:48:43.723 --> 01:48:49.064
It has been actually terrifying over the last couple months because we haven't had rent until like the fourth.

01:48:50.265 --> 01:48:54.346
And so I cannot thank you enough for your faith in what we're doing.

01:48:55.966 --> 01:49:02.888
I hope that you will keep following and sharing and supporting because there's so much good stuff to come.

01:49:02.928 --> 01:49:06.849
It's hard to really say it all in one breath.

01:49:06.889 --> 01:49:07.609
Thanks for being here.

01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:08.429
See you soon.
