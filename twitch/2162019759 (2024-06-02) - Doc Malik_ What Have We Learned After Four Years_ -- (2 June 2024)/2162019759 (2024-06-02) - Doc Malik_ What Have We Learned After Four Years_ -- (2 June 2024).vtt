WEBVTT

02:24.164 --> 02:24.225
you

04:28.655 --> 04:31.257
I would be curious to hear how that space went.

04:33.362 --> 04:35.023
I wasn't really told about it.

04:35.144 --> 04:42.530
So I didn't, I, I guess I kind of knew there was something I saw something, but nobody ever invites me to these things.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.653
And I don't pay attention enough on Twitter for that to happen.

04:46.033 --> 04:49.916
Um, I go on Twitter, I tweet for one cup of coffee and then I get off.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.799
I don't, I don't read Twitter anymore.

04:52.899 --> 04:57.583
It's just a way of me trying to attract attention to the work that we do here.

04:57.903 --> 04:58.704
Um, nothing more.

04:59.264 --> 05:00.145
Uh, Twitter's terrible.

05:01.479 --> 05:03.219
But there are a lot of people trying to use it.

05:03.519 --> 05:06.080
And so I'm trying to throw a lifeline every day.

05:07.460 --> 05:14.021
And anybody that finds themselves here, I think will find themselves in a place where a lot more will make sense.

05:15.321 --> 05:19.282
And I'm afraid that this data tells us that we're dealing as we move forward.

05:19.302 --> 05:22.763
I think a lot of these people are just going to run out of room.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.403
You know, it's kind of like truth is good for kids.

05:25.823 --> 05:26.904
We're so busy lying.

05:26.924 --> 05:29.604
We don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

05:30.117 --> 05:32.358
We want everybody to feel good.

05:32.678 --> 05:34.039
That's not the way life is.

05:34.179 --> 05:36.660
If you mean crypto, yes, they have crypto and they're using it.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.660
But you can tell if someone's lying.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.402
Crypto is one of the ways that all this is happening.

05:40.862 --> 05:46.484
It's one of the ways all these people are being taken care of behind the scenes that we can't really see and follow.

05:46.604 --> 05:48.545
You can make no mistake about it.

05:48.605 --> 05:51.486
That's how things are being laundered right now.

05:52.707 --> 05:55.348
And all of these people are likely involved in it already.

05:55.428 --> 05:56.849
So you just have to be aware of it.

05:58.089 --> 06:02.411
It is absolutely, positively all about maintaining this lie.

06:03.032 --> 06:11.456
This lie right here is the lie that they are all protecting, and they will burn themselves protecting it, I assure you.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.877
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

06:13.997 --> 06:19.020
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

06:20.140 --> 06:26.886
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

06:26.906 --> 06:27.967
Yeah, sorry I'm late, Kim.

06:29.608 --> 06:32.351
Mark, Mark, Mark, you're so funny.

06:33.007 --> 06:36.189
As a surgeon, you should be speaking out on this.

06:36.950 --> 06:38.170
You could save lives.

06:38.711 --> 06:39.511
Dude, what the fuck?

06:39.551 --> 06:40.712
I didn't know anything about this.

06:40.752 --> 06:41.933
How am I meant to know about this?

06:42.833 --> 06:43.234
You know what?

06:43.794 --> 06:44.795
I don't know about everything.

06:44.815 --> 06:54.381
Like, um, you shouldn't, you shouldn't think that just because you're on to something that someone else should be doing it too, buddy.

06:54.961 --> 06:56.562
We've all got our own jobs to do.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.363
I don't tell you what to do.

06:59.744 --> 07:00.205
What the fuck?

07:01.005 --> 07:11.500
anyway i mean the reason why i try to get through to you to get your number call you and you're busy last time and i'm not busy is um look i went back through the podcast and i'm afraid

07:13.226 --> 07:16.369
I think it wasn't good enough mate.

07:17.710 --> 07:32.825
I don't know how to explain this to you but you know it was about, it was just over an hour but the thing is what was relevant was like literally just 15 minutes and it was just dragged out and there was not enough substance, not enough facts, not enough details.

07:33.946 --> 07:48.341
um i would also say try and work on your presentation you you drag things out and speak very slowly and it's just you need to be a bit more punchy a bit more punchy a bit more animated

07:51.458 --> 07:53.059
I don't know.

08:21.525 --> 08:21.565
So,

08:47.116 --> 08:53.679
Well, we're here doing some more work trying to dispel the enchantment and those casting it.

08:54.260 --> 09:02.784
And unfortunately, we've got some painful work to do tonight because a lot of people don't want to accept the fact that Doc Malek is probably not playing for America.

09:03.784 --> 09:05.306
He might be playing for the UK.

09:05.527 --> 09:07.189
I mean, he could be playing for the UK.

09:07.209 --> 09:07.890
That's possible.

09:08.470 --> 09:09.792
But he's not playing for America.

09:09.832 --> 09:11.254
He's not playing for Americans.

09:12.095 --> 09:18.042
And I think he's part of the team that Robert Malone and Meryl Nass are all a part of.

09:19.504 --> 09:22.007
And this team is a team of traders.

09:22.848 --> 09:34.192
And your consciousness is the prime real estate that they've been competing for for many years now, because it is not a matter of what is true that counts, but it's a matter of what is perceived to be true.

09:34.793 --> 09:41.195
And these people have been running us rampant with confusion, fear, uncertainty and doubt.

09:42.556 --> 09:44.676
And that's why we have come to perceive.

09:47.389 --> 10:02.302
come to perceive goldfish as sharks and we've come to not realize the vast majority of us are completely unaware that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread in New York City or anywhere else, despite all these epidemiologists coming to our rescue.

10:03.587 --> 10:30.379
and infectious clones are the only real threat with regard to whatever these RNA entities are and nobody even uses these terms except for to make fun of them or to dismiss them placebo batches can't be on anybody's radar except for ours transfection in healthy humans has always been dumb but people won't still won't say it sometimes they use the word transfection now but it's four and a half years too late

10:31.613 --> 10:38.718
The protocols were murder and there's some very specific ways that they're allowed to say that, but they're not allowed to go into any details.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.540
They're not allowed to tell you what's happening in Oklahoma.

10:42.682 --> 10:52.329
Gain of Function is a mythology that none of these people are going to be articulate enough to explain to you in a meaningful way, because they want you to continue working on the Scooby-Doo mystery.

10:53.050 --> 11:02.236
And they are spectacularly committed to the lies that edify that Scooby-Doo mystery being the question that needs answering.

11:02.917 --> 11:09.982
And in the meantime, they're going to attribute bad motives to me and to others who are just trying to figure this out.

11:12.947 --> 11:17.611
And again, it's because they have means of laundering money.

11:18.451 --> 11:20.253
They have excess cash.

11:20.353 --> 11:30.200
They have influence of weaponized piles of money and control over the programmed results of social media.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.503
And so, yes, they can control what is perceived.

11:34.123 --> 11:41.209
And even those people, when they are shown, they sometimes can't see because the illusion of social media and television is so strong.

11:42.375 --> 11:58.959
And the enticing idea that AI with enough data can solve all of humanity's problems is the pipe dream that all of these people have been chasing since the early 50s, 40s, I don't know when it started.

11:59.679 --> 12:10.862
But we've got a lot of books that indicates that a lot of these people like Hilary Koprowski and Stanley Plotkin and Baltimore and Gallo, these people were all in on creating this illusion

12:12.889 --> 12:17.832
And we inherited the power over us.

12:18.293 --> 12:19.814
We inherited from our parents.

12:19.874 --> 12:22.696
Our parents bequeathed it to us.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.497
Is that the right word?

12:24.438 --> 12:32.004
And once we are given power over, it's hard to get it back, especially if they've had power over us since we were children.

12:32.364 --> 12:33.145
And that's the case.

12:34.105 --> 12:41.011
And so we're going to have to do something pretty magical if we're going to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of this mythology

12:42.585 --> 13:01.307
If we're going to teach our children to be able to see the mythology in America for what it is, the public health state, the military-industrial complex, the way that our Congress is captured by lobbying money, the way that our banks are captured, if we're going to teach our kids to start to be able to see this and surf this wave safely to shore,

13:02.609 --> 13:05.152
We're going to have to start telling the truth in some very big ways.

13:05.192 --> 13:14.183
And there are lots of people right now that are artificially risen on social media that have no business being there because their job is to make sure our kids cannot see this way.

13:14.243 --> 13:18.748
Their job is to make sure that our kids are misled for another generation or two.

13:19.813 --> 13:22.114
So if you're here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.596
And if not, you might need to be taught how to stay focused on the biology.

13:25.616 --> 13:32.799
You might need to be shaken loose of the bait on social media, and you might need to relearn what it means to love your neighbor.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.501
The way this works is people support the stream.

13:36.521 --> 13:43.325
We got a couple of crazy donations over the last couple of days that, quite frankly, are absolutely mind-boggling.

13:44.383 --> 13:48.067
coming from someone who has given very little on the internet to anyone.

13:48.908 --> 13:52.031
Shout out to a couple of the donors from the last couple days.

13:52.972 --> 14:00.560
I'm not sure whether I'm going to pull the trigger on first names all the time or not, so I'm kind of hesitating right now, but suffice to say that...

14:03.638 --> 14:06.639
Some pretty big bullseyes are hit when people donate.

14:07.600 --> 14:15.123
And it really makes a huge difference because my family is supported by viewers like you.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.905
This work is supported by viewers like you, and that's it.

14:20.585 --> 14:21.186
Nobody else.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.166
And so that's really important.

14:24.527 --> 14:26.268
We don't have the Skoll Foundation.

14:26.308 --> 14:28.349
We don't have a 501c3 yet.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.769
We don't have anything like that.

14:29.809 --> 14:31.010
We just have people that are

14:32.290 --> 14:40.939
are see and believe in what they see and think that our message of informed noncompliance of learning the biology is a good one.

14:41.559 --> 14:43.221
And so again, thanks to all those donors.

14:43.241 --> 14:44.723
This is GigaOM Biological.

14:49.740 --> 14:49.800
do

15:17.818 --> 15:18.939
Good afternoon.

15:18.959 --> 15:23.022
It is 436 in the afternoon here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

15:23.062 --> 15:25.284
It's a bit cloudy day, a little muggy, but cool.

15:25.304 --> 15:29.427
It is the 2nd of June, 2024, and I wanted to do some more work with regard to getting us out of this

15:35.251 --> 15:36.272
I'm a human just like you.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.193
I'm going to make mistakes.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.194
I have made mistakes.

15:38.294 --> 15:58.435
One of the things that is characterized, cataloged on my website is at the link Scooby, where you can find what I was thinking in early 2021, late 2020, about the immunology and the transfection and what would work and what wouldn't and the biology of the virus and this kind of thing.

15:58.995 --> 16:15.496
And I've come a long way since then, but seeing how effectively trapped I was at the beginning of 2021 and the mystery of the Scooby-Doo is really illustrative of how all of us, no matter how hard we worked, were likely to be trapped because we were being lied to by a chorus.

16:16.377 --> 16:19.240
of liars that were agreeing on certain topics.

16:19.940 --> 16:30.429
And those people were put in front of us by, not by random algorithms, but by careful programming of social media so that only certain voices were heard and seen by the right people.

16:30.509 --> 16:37.195
And so that two sides or three sides of a story were created wherein nobody would ever solve the mystery.

16:37.215 --> 16:41.839
And instead, by arguing vigorously within these limited spectrums of debate, nobody would escape.

16:42.359 --> 16:47.382
And everybody would assume at some point that this was a lab leak and that it was released upon us.

16:50.084 --> 16:55.207
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

16:55.608 --> 16:59.850
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

17:00.591 --> 17:03.373
And we're going to spend this summer really, really

17:04.594 --> 17:12.058
learning the biology that edifies these ideas and once and for all end this debate about no viruses, viruses, whatever.

17:13.079 --> 17:25.526
Not end the debate, but kind of bring a level of clarity and nuance so that the vast majority of people who are captured in

17:27.130 --> 17:28.691
the TV narrative can escape.

17:29.752 --> 17:41.401
At some point in time, the no virus idea and what they did or didn't do is going to have to be investigated by someone, cataloged by someone, so that we can show exactly what they did when they did it.

17:42.422 --> 17:45.303
and that they never really said, hey, this is a lie.

17:45.523 --> 17:49.863
And they murdered people to achieve acceptance of the lie.

17:50.404 --> 17:57.445
The no-virus people were never able to say it so succinctly in the first, let's say, two and a half or three years of the pandemic.

17:57.905 --> 18:05.106
And this can't be a happenstance failing because of their extreme focus on virology.

18:05.206 --> 18:07.947
Rather, this is a probably scripted failing

18:08.567 --> 18:17.731
And that's why if they get their way or the way of the controllers, most likely some of these no virus people are going to step forward and say, hey, we said it all along.

18:18.351 --> 18:24.374
And what's going to be unfortunate is that I'm going to be the one person in the wilderness who's going to say, no, they didn't.

18:25.094 --> 18:27.756
And if they did, they said it very well at the beginning of 2020.

18:27.796 --> 18:38.485
And then their narratives changed and sculpted around these few ideas and these few semantic arguments that had to be accepted in order to debate.

18:38.525 --> 18:44.571
And the only things, they were very, very, very strange for three years and not really

18:45.251 --> 18:47.653
seemingly to move this ball forward.

18:47.714 --> 18:54.200
And so anybody that wants to agree with these three statements, but argue about something in the details, I'm totally down with it.

18:54.600 --> 19:01.027
But you're going to see that nobody will actually even state these or admit that these statements are available.

19:01.627 --> 19:12.820
Instead, they're usually going to start with our hypothesis about a dangerous novel virus being declared by the WHO and that maybe clones were used to seed the molecular signal that was confounded as a pandemic.

19:13.180 --> 19:21.270
But they're never going to start here because these are the ideas that that whole lab leak and natural virus debate is supposed to hide and protect.

19:23.971 --> 19:26.953
And so that's why they have been busy spreading bad ideas.

19:27.033 --> 19:38.860
And I guess the more accurate way to say it would be they've been spreading bad questions and arguing about the answers to these bad questions for four years in order for us not to escape from this trap.

19:39.461 --> 19:41.262
And so these people are really traitors.

19:41.902 --> 19:45.465
And I would argue that there are some... What the hell?

19:50.228 --> 19:51.589
Did I do something wrong there?

19:51.909 --> 19:52.209
Darn it.

19:54.338 --> 19:54.658
I did.

19:56.259 --> 19:58.299
Okay, so I got to get out of here.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.380
You demon.

20:01.740 --> 20:02.480
I mean, it's fine.

20:02.540 --> 20:03.540
It's not that big a deal.

20:03.861 --> 20:06.001
I just, I just like that thing to be in there.

20:11.643 --> 20:12.563
You know, I like this.

20:12.963 --> 20:13.263
Sorry.

20:15.764 --> 20:17.944
So spread of dangerous ideas.

20:18.024 --> 20:19.925
Today we are going to look at

20:21.710 --> 20:26.456
Doc Malek, and he was on a podcast in January or February or March.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.237
I don't know when it was.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.959
It was the first few months of the year.

20:28.979 --> 20:37.089
I had it saved in my January folder, I think, but I don't think it was January, and that should have been an automatic transition there.

20:37.149 --> 20:38.410
Why isn't it transitioning?

20:39.051 --> 20:39.492
There we go.

20:42.085 --> 20:43.867
And so it might have just been at the beginning of 2024.

20:44.307 --> 21:02.002
And I'm not going to hold anybody's hand here, but if you figure out that this podcast was, let's say, in January of 2024, maybe February, you can go to Doc Malek's list on Rumble or go to his list on his website, wherever that is.

21:02.822 --> 21:13.107
And you can look at who had been on his podcast before he did this guest spot on Politics at Empire, a podcast that I've also been on.

21:14.047 --> 21:21.570
And so it's interesting because both of these guys have talked to me and both of these guys have talked to, in fact, a lot of these people that are pretending to be

21:23.700 --> 21:26.721
part of a group of people actually trying to figure this out.

21:26.761 --> 21:38.186
Like I am, instead of actually trying to figure it out though, these people are trying to actively meddle with everyone who is trying to figure it out to make sure that number one, we don't come together.

21:38.246 --> 21:46.029
That's one of the reasons why Jessica Hockett was busy with a bunch of other people and I was busy with a bunch of other people to make sure that we would never come together.

21:46.049 --> 21:46.889
Now we're together.

21:46.910 --> 21:48.810
Now Mark and I and her are together.

21:49.310 --> 21:52.632
Now Nick and Jonathan and these people are all coming together.

21:53.193 --> 21:54.565
under the under the

21:55.706 --> 22:06.875
a more nuanced way of arguing that there was no pandemic, that isn't so easily dismissed as the, there's no virus position, and not so easily dismissed as, oh, it can't be.

22:06.915 --> 22:08.476
It's just viruses are viruses.

22:09.097 --> 22:17.384
Because we know that all of these positions are pretty ridiculous now, unless we are absolutely skilled, skillfully using television and social media.

22:18.104 --> 22:22.388
So the curious thing is, of course, is that Doc Malek came to the scene

22:25.590 --> 22:26.251
Can I do that?

22:26.471 --> 22:27.272
And then this?

22:27.612 --> 22:28.313
And then this?

22:29.995 --> 22:31.536
Doc Malek came to the scene.

22:34.133 --> 22:41.400
I guess in 2022 or the beginning of 2023 or I don't know when it was, but it's certainly not in 2020.

22:42.181 --> 22:46.605
He didn't start a podcast in 2019 or a YouTube channel or nothing.

22:47.606 --> 22:57.757
He didn't really start to do anything until 21 or 22 and it wasn't really clear if he lost his job completely or just kinda or when that all happened.

22:58.697 --> 23:00.439
And then he transitioned into this.

23:00.459 --> 23:07.624
When he first started podcasting, I do not believe, although I could be wrong, his fans can correct me, that he had already lost his position.

23:07.664 --> 23:09.726
That happened after he started the podcast.

23:09.766 --> 23:13.869
And in fact, maybe even because of his podcast, he lost his job.

23:15.042 --> 23:29.939
So what I'm getting at here is that we want to be very careful because of course if we're going to give attention and we're going to give financial support and other people are going to give their attention and their time to Doc Malik,

23:30.339 --> 23:32.880
There should be some contribution by this guy, right?

23:32.920 --> 23:34.760
He's supposedly an orthopedic surgeon.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.381
He was skilled enough to cut people open while they were under anesthesia.

23:38.741 --> 23:43.042
So he should know some basics as an MD and some basics as a surgeon.

23:43.482 --> 23:50.924
And so after speaking to all the people that he spoke to before, whenever this podcast was, he should have built up some understanding.

23:50.964 --> 23:56.606
Now, even if his understanding doesn't incorporate what I told him when I was on his podcast, that doesn't matter.

23:57.892 --> 24:25.910
My argument would be essentially that he, if he's doing what he calls his job, when he's complaining about Mark, it would be to kind of learn from the people that he's podcasting and so slowly build a sort of synthesis understanding of what happened based on what Mike Eden told him and what Robert Malone, what he learned from Robert Malone and what he learned from Meryl Nass, what he learned from Sasha Latupova.

24:26.750 --> 24:43.718
And so somewhere in there, there must be some synthesis after all those hours of hard work, podcasting and all that editing and whatever, all that time and effort, he must have developed some more sophisticated understanding of what happened or didn't happen since he started his podcast.

24:44.419 --> 24:53.443
And what I think you're going to find extraordinary is in this podcast where he's interviewed by someone else, you're not going to find any understanding at all.

24:55.327 --> 25:00.028
And he avoids in fact, committing to any understanding, especially in the beginning of the interview.

25:00.048 --> 25:03.389
And that's really remarkable because what is he doing then?

25:04.289 --> 25:05.929
What contribution is he making?

25:06.609 --> 25:18.992
I would argue that I have made a earnest and I've made a genuine attempt to understand everything that's happening since about

25:20.458 --> 25:21.558
the end of January 2020.

25:22.259 --> 25:27.981
And I've made lots of mistakes, especially in that first year, because I was meddled with by a lot of these liars.

25:28.021 --> 25:32.702
And that's why I have a particularly personal problem with some of them.

25:33.042 --> 25:45.747
Some of them have visited me in Pittsburgh, stayed overnight at my house, been on signal chats with me and all this other stuff, manipulating the way that I think, trying to influence what I say or don't say or delay what I do or don't do.

25:48.427 --> 26:02.721
And so I find it very extraordinary that coming to the scene rather late, Doc Malek has risen like a meteorite, because I guess his unique style is very charming or something.

26:04.332 --> 26:05.553
And actually, I don't believe that.

26:06.054 --> 26:23.133
I actually believe that like Robert Malone's fake censorship and Alex Berenson's fake censorship, and Pierre Khoury's fake testimony at the beginning of the pandemic, these are all things that were orchestrated by whatever entity or entities

26:25.393 --> 26:27.475
have executed this pandemic on us.

26:27.555 --> 26:30.577
If they took advantage of the DOD, they took advantage of HHS.

26:30.597 --> 26:32.619
There are traitors inside of those organizations.

26:32.679 --> 26:33.860
I don't have the explanation.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.802
All I know is that nobody talks about the State Department.

26:36.842 --> 26:38.423
Nobody ever says the FBI.

26:39.324 --> 26:42.887
And everybody always says the DOD without saying DITRA very often.

26:43.547 --> 26:47.070
And so it's just strange how all of these people have it figured all out.

26:47.951 --> 26:52.254
And one of the commonalities between all these people is that I'm not really worth listening to.

26:52.314 --> 26:53.415
I'm kind of crazy.

26:55.259 --> 26:56.819
Or worse, I'm a bad guy.

26:58.540 --> 27:04.641
And so Doc Malik has been on a signal chat with a hundred other people.

27:05.262 --> 27:10.603
It's titled something like a Bitcoin signal chat that I was a part of in 2021, maybe 2022.

27:10.643 --> 27:12.444
I don't remember when I was in there.

27:16.164 --> 27:30.372
And that signal chat, he has been happy to make fun of me, happy to, I guess, say that somehow I'm being disingenuous with my critiques of Robert Malone or Meryl Nass or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:30.533 --> 27:31.633
or Mary Holland.

27:32.734 --> 27:40.759
But all I am doing is telling the truth about my experience with them, what they've said to me in person and in private, because I feel like it's vital

27:41.792 --> 27:46.875
to saving what I think is worth saving, which is America, the thing that we all share.

27:48.356 --> 27:57.321
Unfortunately, I think a lot of people in a lot of other countries are not involved in saving America, and in fact, are involved in meddling with America to make sure that we don't save ourselves.

27:58.462 --> 28:08.608
And that's why so many of these people are actually foreigners, from the UK or Canada or they're dual citizens, or from New Zealand.

28:08.628 --> 28:09.729
I mean, come on.

28:11.772 --> 28:15.733
What do these people know about our legal predicament versus their own legal predicament?

28:15.773 --> 28:21.615
What can Viva Frye actually know about the legal system in America if he's a lawyer from Canada?

28:22.736 --> 28:30.859
These aren't similar systems with similar precedents being set by their judicial records.

28:30.899 --> 28:31.759
This is ridiculous.

28:34.790 --> 28:44.876
And so something is happening and it is very malevolent and we are being misled by many more people than we've ever imagined possible because people are co-opted.

28:46.817 --> 28:59.804
They are offered comfort and fame and Bitcoin and day trading and shady businesses with baseball cards and gold in America airport lockers and stupid stuff like that.

29:00.504 --> 29:01.725
Schemes and scams.

29:03.971 --> 29:11.236
The wellness company doesn't have to be all bad to be used in a bad way to great effect.

29:11.757 --> 29:16.020
And confusion and frustration and doubt is the big effects they look for.

29:18.206 --> 29:26.995
Doc Malek was introduced to us because Robert Malone and his team, or whoever is running Robert Malone's group, decided to choose him.

29:27.195 --> 29:31.079
And that's why all of them, all of them, all of them have been on his show.

29:31.579 --> 29:35.223
Maybe he was a good guy at some point, but I highly doubt it.

29:36.462 --> 29:50.551
That's why when you see that email, he didn't deny where he's asking for more than $100,000 a year, plus a $50,000 signing bonus to be the chief surgical and medical officer of the wellness company, Europe.

29:55.936 --> 30:12.887
If you don't see that as somebody who came out exactly when it was good to come out, exactly when it was profitable to come out, lucrative to come out, best for him, nothing to do with finally realizing that there was some truth to be told, nothing to do.

30:14.093 --> 30:17.876
with saving America or any of our children, nothing at all.

30:17.936 --> 30:24.763
And in fact, the odds of him being a part of the active controlled demolition of America, I think are almost 100%.

30:26.304 --> 30:26.925
Listen to this.

30:32.429 --> 30:38.475
People are going to say I'm crazy, but you just listen to his words and let him answer the questions for you.

30:41.189 --> 30:46.730
I'm going to speed it up a little bit because I think it's probably going to be a little intolerable if we don't.

30:48.351 --> 30:52.312
How about 125 is always usually pretty good.

30:57.293 --> 31:04.795
I'm going to try and be objective as possible, ladies and gentlemen, but as I recall, he says some pretty amazing stuff.

31:06.239 --> 31:21.383
Given the fact remember he's had Mike Eden on he's had I mean Nick Hudson on he's had all these people have been on there So if he's not got some kind of synthesis of what he thinks the most likely thing that's happened.

31:21.443 --> 31:33.966
It's just gonna be like Let's see, let's see if he's punchy I was gonna be on the Viva Frye show, but Let's see if I can show that on screen here.

31:33.986 --> 31:34.006
I

31:42.080 --> 31:43.161
Hey, I'm in.

31:43.822 --> 31:46.303
This was on Thursday, May 23rd.

31:47.204 --> 31:50.426
Today is June 6th, 6th, 2nd of June.

31:51.507 --> 31:52.308
May 23rd.

31:52.348 --> 31:55.850
Hey, I'm in Eastern Standard Time, Pittsburgh, East Coast Time.

31:55.890 --> 31:58.332
I can make myself available whenever is necessary.

31:58.492 --> 31:58.912
Excellent.

31:59.493 --> 32:01.714
Next week, this week is basically over.

32:02.682 --> 32:05.143
So that next week was this past week.

32:05.243 --> 32:05.643
You bet.

32:05.683 --> 32:09.084
I'm open for whatever works almost any time, although maybe not 2am.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.084
And he said, don't worry.

32:10.524 --> 32:11.684
I'm a daylight person.

32:12.024 --> 32:12.704
Laugh out loud.

32:12.764 --> 32:13.325
So we'll see.

32:14.445 --> 32:16.225
This week apparently didn't work out for him.

32:16.265 --> 32:19.606
Maybe I'm supposed to ping him and beg him to be on his show.

32:20.126 --> 32:22.367
But somehow I have a feeling that's not going to work out.

32:24.096 --> 32:29.340
Maybe you guys should ping him and maybe that would work out better, but I don't think it's gonna work out.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.241
I kind of knew it wouldn't.

32:30.621 --> 32:34.705
Let's listen to this and see if you can pick up the same vibe that I'm picking up here.

32:34.725 --> 32:46.014
Are we gonna see a humble doctor who ran into the big monster and is now trying to humbly join the fight against that big monster?

32:46.114 --> 32:50.497
Or what does he see that makes his podcast unique?

32:51.518 --> 32:54.579
what's interesting about his take on things.

32:54.939 --> 32:56.000
It'll be interesting to hear it.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.001
Geopolitics and Empire is joined by Doc Malek, the canceled surgeon.

33:00.021 --> 33:07.783
You can no longer find him in any operating room, but you can find him in the metaverse at docmalek.substack.com where he's working on people's brains to brainwash them.

33:07.983 --> 33:09.484
Welcome to Geopolitics and Empire, Doc.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.939
God, man, I wish I was as slick as you when it came to intros.

33:13.219 --> 33:14.920
You got this gravelly, sexy voice.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.162
You got this really interesting accent that you can't place.

33:17.683 --> 33:20.145
And yeah, I don't really do nice intros like that.

33:20.845 --> 33:21.806
Well, you can start.

33:21.826 --> 33:22.326
You can start.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.629
And I was just a guest on your awesome podcast program.

33:25.649 --> 33:26.970
I don't know how you do it, how you sleep.

33:26.990 --> 33:30.653
You're just churning out a million amazing podcast guests every week.

33:30.733 --> 33:35.197
But to start, I guess my question for you would be and then we'll get to what happened to you.

33:35.997 --> 33:47.842
COVID-19-84, as I like to call it, you know, or COVID-9-11, you know, I started using that in like March 2020 and someone actually sent me 20 bucks via PayPal when I was still on, allowed to use PayPal.

33:47.862 --> 33:51.023
They said, you're the first person I heard use that phrase COVID-19-84.

33:51.543 --> 33:52.083
What was it?

33:52.263 --> 33:56.765
You know, from looking back from your, you know, you've been your doctor or health expert.

33:57.665 --> 34:01.527
I view it as some sort of totalitarian technocratic military operation, COVID.

34:02.567 --> 34:04.168
What was this whole thing?

34:04.308 --> 34:06.729
And that is because it's still ongoing and they might try it again.

34:07.909 --> 34:09.790
Yeah, that's a million dollar question, buddy.

34:10.110 --> 34:10.450
Seriously.

34:10.470 --> 34:14.351
I love that, COVID 1984 or 9-11.

34:14.431 --> 34:20.213
It's funny, Richard Gage, you might know him, the guy who set up the architects and engineers, you know, for 9-11 truth.

34:20.634 --> 34:24.175
He actually had to leave his association because he said, look, this whole COVID thing, just like 9-11.

34:25.103 --> 34:27.404
And they're like, well, you can't do that.

34:28.665 --> 34:30.486
You have to leave and then do his own thing.

34:30.506 --> 34:31.806
So you're 100 percent on the money there.

34:32.167 --> 34:33.267
You know, and what was 9-11?

34:33.287 --> 34:34.528
9-11 was a false flag.

34:35.108 --> 34:35.468
What was 9-11?

34:35.869 --> 34:38.110
It was the grandest of conspiracy realities.

34:38.750 --> 34:39.831
There was misinformation.

34:40.351 --> 34:42.632
There was complete mind warfare going on.

34:43.092 --> 34:52.197
There was financial shenanigans and justification to go on, you know, splurge money and go on this all out war campaign, forever war, forever war.

34:52.937 --> 34:56.399
And then introduction of the biosecurity state, the Patriot X, everything.

34:56.439 --> 35:02.021
So when you think about it, yeah, COVID is 9-11, 100%, because what has it done?

35:02.041 --> 35:06.003
This is forever war, forever war against these nasty germs and pandemics.

35:06.663 --> 35:08.924
The enemy is out there and it's invisible.

35:09.325 --> 35:10.285
We need to be prepared.

35:10.845 --> 35:14.227
Preparedness, you know, industry is there, the pandemic preparedness industry.

35:14.967 --> 35:19.791
And we can touch upon this, you know, with the WHO and the IHR amendments, which are specifically targeting that.

35:20.291 --> 35:32.120
And then, you know, you had further infringement on our liberties, just like the Patriot Act and the biosecurity state, the Covid passports, vaccine passports, you name it, the testing, trace and trace testing, track and testing, whatever you want to call it.

35:32.540 --> 35:33.861
And a lot of money was made, a lot of money.

35:34.402 --> 35:36.683
So I think the parallels are huge, huge.

35:37.124 --> 35:40.766
And, you know, when I talk about, you know, I used to talk about the military, military industrial complex.

35:41.787 --> 35:44.510
And the medical-industrial complex, actually, I think they're the same thing.

35:44.650 --> 35:58.162
The medical-military-industrial complex is this massive behemoth machinery trying to exploit the wealth, the talent, and the hard labor of just normal human beings to feed this beast.

35:59.016 --> 36:11.346
And so it's not clear to me when exactly he came to this awareness, because he said the words, when I used to talk about the medical industrial complex or the military industrial, it's not really clear to me what he's referring to.

36:11.426 --> 36:23.656
Is this when he was still a surgeon or it's like earlier in season one, he's acting as though he's always been speaking out, always been fighting.

36:23.676 --> 36:24.697
And that's just a lie.

36:27.099 --> 36:33.044
I mean, everybody in the UK that was killed was killed while he was working and he didn't do shit.

36:33.864 --> 36:34.845
Excuse my language.

36:35.546 --> 36:38.348
But when the murder happened in the UK, he wasn't speaking out.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.609
He wasn't saying anything.

36:42.231 --> 36:48.776
Now, if the murder continued into 2022 or 2023, then maybe he said something at some point, but I haven't heard him.

36:51.598 --> 36:57.204
And so this is already pretty rich because he mentioned the WHO and the IHR amendments.

36:57.244 --> 36:58.985
That was one of the first things that popped out.

36:59.386 --> 37:03.410
And then the first guy that he gives a plug is Richard Gage on 9-11.

37:04.951 --> 37:06.052
Boy, is that sketchy.

37:07.153 --> 37:15.181
Not that I think Richard Gage is necessarily a bad guy, but he is definitely a limited hangout because he won't speak about things that he doesn't understand.

37:16.181 --> 37:24.183
So he focuses very specifically on stuff that he's an expert on and curiously enough, he can't speak about anything else.

37:25.363 --> 37:43.087
And that's a interesting flaw of a lot of the people that I've interacted with regard to the pandemic because Jay Bhattacharya says that he can't understand the stuff that's on my stream because he's not a biologist, he's an economist and epidemiologist.

37:44.022 --> 37:51.089
And I've heard so many people say they just can't evaluate the biology that I talk about on my stream because it's not their thing.

37:52.550 --> 37:54.532
And I just, I find that laughable.

37:58.976 --> 38:08.846
And it's because I don't think if you can't explain your understanding sufficiently for someone else to grasp your understanding, then you don't understand anything.

38:09.710 --> 38:19.160
And the idea that someone can't grasp my explanations of what I think happened in the pandemic is, especially with regard to people like Doc Malik, this is just liars.

38:23.945 --> 38:31.213
The idea that Brett Weinstein said that he didn't think 30 minutes in a Zoom meeting would help him understand my text message is just a liar.

38:35.905 --> 38:38.707
So let's listen, see if we catch him on anything else.

38:38.827 --> 38:41.509
I, I, when I used to talk, let's hear it.

38:41.529 --> 38:42.710
Huge, huge.

38:43.150 --> 38:46.732
And you know, when I talk about, you know, I used to talk about the military, military industrial complex.

38:46.772 --> 38:49.354
I used to talk and the medical industrial complex.

38:49.554 --> 38:55.638
Actually, I think that the same thing, the medical military industrial complex is this massive behemoth machinery.

38:56.819 --> 38:59.221
Trying to explain that he worked for, right.

38:59.301 --> 39:05.705
That he worked for, for his whole life until like a year ago when he finally woke up to the, I guess it being a monster.

39:07.195 --> 39:08.687
It's not really ringing true to me.

39:09.775 --> 39:19.920
the wealth, the talent, and the hard labor of just, you know, normal human beings to feed this beast, this evil parasite that's sucking the life force of humanity.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.642
So if you want to know what I think it is roughly, yeah, it's exactly what you just said.

39:23.662 --> 39:28.084
If you go into the details, Aurovi, it's a bit, it's not clear.

39:28.304 --> 39:28.924
And I'll tell you why.

39:28.944 --> 39:29.584
It's deliberate.

39:30.205 --> 39:35.047
It's the fog of war, misdirection, misinformation, confusion.

39:35.347 --> 39:36.068
You know, it's deliberate.

39:36.088 --> 39:36.848
These are tactics.

39:38.048 --> 39:39.269
You know, leave the enemy confused.

39:40.149 --> 39:44.071
Create a bank of a fog, you know, all around you.

39:44.391 --> 39:45.032
Smoke screen.

39:45.732 --> 39:46.332
Is the enemy in front?

39:46.373 --> 39:46.893
Is it behind?

39:47.213 --> 39:47.753
Is it to your left?

39:47.773 --> 39:48.374
Is it to your right?

39:49.014 --> 39:49.994
What are they throwing at you?

39:50.355 --> 39:51.395
Like, where's upside down?

39:51.415 --> 39:52.576
You know, you just don't know.

39:52.596 --> 39:53.296
You're spinning around, around.

39:53.316 --> 39:53.996
You're just confused.

39:54.037 --> 39:57.278
And in that confused state, you lose sense of reality.

39:57.298 --> 39:58.579
You're no longer grounded.

39:58.799 --> 40:03.662
How can you fight the enemy when you don't even know who the enemy is, where the enemy is coming from, and what they're attacking for?

40:03.682 --> 40:04.502
How can you defend yourself from that?

40:04.662 --> 40:06.764
So he's pretty excited about how they've done it.

40:06.804 --> 40:07.024
Right.

40:07.084 --> 40:12.869
Sounds a lot like Robert Malone, like fifth generation warfare, something you can't really resist because you don't know where it's coming from.

40:13.310 --> 40:16.653
Maybe the world that you thought you left behind never existed in the first place.

40:17.073 --> 40:17.774
Just deliberate.

40:17.814 --> 40:24.600
And you remember, you remember back in 2020, how fracking confusing it was, like the information to charge, to grasp.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.621
You don't have a clue.

40:25.741 --> 40:26.822
I mean, I'm sorry.

40:26.862 --> 40:29.604
At the time, I was thinking maybe I'm just dumb, dumb shit.

40:29.624 --> 40:30.505
I just don't understand all this.

40:31.735 --> 40:33.856
But consultant, sorry, I'm a pretty smart guy looking at all this stuff.

40:33.876 --> 40:35.517
And I was like, I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.

40:35.977 --> 40:38.178
And oftentimes it's kind of like conflicting information.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.119
I'd go through the official government data, the ONS.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.620
I'd be so confusing.

40:41.900 --> 40:46.623
And the thing is, you needed to be a statistician to read through the lines and figure out.

40:47.263 --> 40:48.784
But in essence, everything was a lie.

40:49.124 --> 40:49.444
That's all.

40:49.664 --> 40:54.667
Interesting that I just realized that Uncaptured is on his hat, which is actually

40:56.428 --> 40:59.710
Dan Cohen's media organization that he started a long time.

40:59.790 --> 41:07.395
I wonder if it's stolen just like illusion of consensus was stolen by a substack from a Canadian kid.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.176
Fusion.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.316
Stand up, sit down, stand up.

41:10.377 --> 41:10.877
No, no, sit down.

41:11.137 --> 41:11.957
Nope, stay sitting down.

41:11.997 --> 41:12.578
Now you can stand up.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.100
You just got to the point where you just didn't know and they wanted you to be in that state.

41:16.733 --> 41:20.195
so that you would look to the government, the state, for the answers.

41:20.435 --> 41:23.998
So when the government and state said, you can stand up, now you'd be like, can I stand up?

41:24.518 --> 41:24.818
Standing up.

41:25.439 --> 41:25.979
Now you can sit down.

41:26.079 --> 41:26.700
Okay, thank you, thank you.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.983
Because making a decision was so stressful, you abdicated all responsibility to the state.

41:33.344 --> 41:35.565
And that is, that has persisted.

41:36.146 --> 41:36.946
So nothing has changed.

41:37.687 --> 41:42.130
Abdicated all your responsibility is something I've been saying for three and a half or four years.

41:44.341 --> 41:53.625
And definitely he hasn't been saying it for three and a half or four years because he wasn't anywhere to be seen in 2020 or 2021, maybe even 2022.

41:54.305 --> 41:54.785
Look it up.

41:57.606 --> 42:00.408
Prove these people true yourself.

42:01.608 --> 42:13.293
And if you can't prove them to be true by their record, by what they say, by the consistent record of integrity, then stop following them.

42:14.642 --> 42:20.787
Some of the pressure from the state has come off, the pressure from the media has come off, but there is still a state of, you know, a fog of war.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.451
And we hear things like, oh, you know, there's a leaked the wet market.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.373
Then it's the it's it's a leaked virus from Wuhan.

42:27.453 --> 42:28.034
No, it's not.

42:28.114 --> 42:28.815
Yes, it is.

42:29.255 --> 42:29.915
It's a conspiracy.

42:29.996 --> 42:30.556
No, it's not.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.358
You know, it's there's a virus.

42:32.438 --> 42:33.318
No, there's no virus.

42:34.019 --> 42:34.779
No, it's clones.

42:35.120 --> 42:35.740
Maybe it's not.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.140
It was dispersed in some places.

42:37.641 --> 42:38.301
It's this.

42:38.981 --> 42:42.563
I mean, it's got to the point where it's that has persisted.

42:43.143 --> 42:43.903
So nothing has changed.

42:44.344 --> 42:46.044
Some of the pressure from the state has come off.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.165
The pressure from the media has come up.

42:47.545 --> 42:50.486
But there is still a state of, you know, a fog of war.

42:50.986 --> 42:54.148
And we hear things like, oh, you know, there's a leaked the wet market.

42:54.448 --> 42:57.069
Then it's the it's a leaked virus from Wuhan.

42:57.149 --> 42:57.729
No, it's not.

42:57.809 --> 42:58.510
Yes, it is.

42:58.950 --> 42:59.610
It's a conspiracy.

42:59.690 --> 43:00.231
No, it's not.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.031
You know, it's there's a virus.

43:02.051 --> 43:03.012
No, there's no virus.

43:03.692 --> 43:04.473
No, it's clones.

43:04.813 --> 43:05.454
Maybe it's not.

43:05.774 --> 43:07.456
It was dispersed in some places.

43:07.876 --> 43:12.340
I mean, it's got to the point where it's like, I have no fracking idea what the hell's going on.

43:12.701 --> 43:15.824
See, he has no fracking idea what's going on.

43:15.884 --> 43:27.795
So after all this podcasting, after all this hard work, churning out so many interesting guests, listening to so many people try to teach him something,

43:28.789 --> 43:30.890
bring him some level of understanding.

43:30.970 --> 43:36.831
Even if he didn't understand what I told him about clones, he at least admitted that he's heard of it.

43:42.853 --> 43:45.034
He's got no fracking idea.

43:45.074 --> 43:46.174
He's a pretty smart guy.

43:46.194 --> 43:47.574
He says he toots his own horn.

43:47.614 --> 43:48.315
I'm pretty smart.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.415
I looked at those government figures.

43:50.475 --> 43:52.336
I didn't understand what they were talking about.

43:52.436 --> 43:55.137
Now he's been doing a podcast for more than a year.

43:55.177 --> 43:56.517
He doesn't understand diddly.

43:58.809 --> 44:07.465
After four years, you know, first couple years just sheltering in place, I guess, working with his head down, wearing the mask because they told him to.

44:08.706 --> 44:13.009
Now he's finally awake, but now, I mean, he just, he can't figure anything out.

44:13.029 --> 44:14.930
This is all just too complicated for him.

44:14.970 --> 44:17.192
It's just a, he's no fracking idea.

44:17.212 --> 44:18.012
It's persisted.

44:18.593 --> 44:19.373
So nothing has changed.

44:19.813 --> 44:21.495
Some of the pressure from the state has come off.

44:21.515 --> 44:25.918
The pressure from the media has come off, but there is still a state of, you know, a fog of war.

44:26.418 --> 44:32.482
And we hear things like, oh, you know, there's a leaked, the wet market, then it's the, it's, it's a leaked virus from Wuhan.

44:32.562 --> 44:33.142
No, it's not.

44:33.222 --> 44:33.923
Yes, it is.

44:34.363 --> 44:35.044
It's a conspiracy.

44:35.104 --> 44:35.664
No, it's not.

44:36.124 --> 44:37.465
You know, it's, there's a virus.

44:37.545 --> 44:38.426
No, there's no virus.

44:39.106 --> 44:39.886
No, it's clones.

44:40.226 --> 44:40.846
Maybe it's not.

44:41.187 --> 44:42.847
It was dispersed in some places.

44:43.287 --> 44:47.768
I mean, it's got to the point where it's like, I have no fracking idea what the hell's going on.

44:47.988 --> 44:51.729
So we've all got our jobs to do, he told Mark in that voicemail.

44:51.789 --> 44:53.369
We've all got our jobs to do, man.

44:53.389 --> 44:56.850
You can't just expect everybody to be paying attention to whatever you're doing.

44:58.390 --> 44:59.391
So what's his job?

45:00.451 --> 45:02.831
Is he just an audio technician with cameras?

45:04.912 --> 45:05.852
Is he a film editor?

45:08.976 --> 45:10.277
I don't get what his job is.

45:10.317 --> 45:19.361
His expertise was some kind of MD or surgeon, but apparently it's not doing him any good now because he has no fracking idea what's going on.

45:24.723 --> 45:25.904
So how's he helping us then?

45:29.994 --> 45:34.557
But what I do know, and this is the important thing, it is important to ground yourself.

45:35.138 --> 45:37.379
So don't allow yourself to be spun around.

45:38.120 --> 45:42.683
I accept there are many things that I do not know, and I'm quite happy to say that.

45:43.023 --> 45:45.805
The problem with society today is too many people are scared to say, I don't know.

45:46.265 --> 45:49.627
They think by saying that, they come across as an idiot or stupid, and they will lose credibility.

45:49.808 --> 45:51.289
So they will make up some bullshit story.

45:52.209 --> 45:53.090
No, it's not.

45:53.190 --> 45:57.373
The reason why that's stupid is because we are four years into this lie.

45:58.325 --> 46:11.974
And if you are still at the stage where you don't know, and you're arguing for more people to admit that they don't know, you're not really helping anyone.

46:12.794 --> 46:17.197
We need people to understand that this was a lie.

46:17.237 --> 46:20.119
We need people to understand how they lied about it.

46:20.960 --> 46:25.603
And you're supposed to believe that he's got nothing to offer, really, except for, you know,

46:26.567 --> 46:27.988
You just got to admit you don't know.

46:28.108 --> 46:30.650
Some people are just afraid to admit that they don't know.

46:34.473 --> 46:44.501
Some people are just being told, instructed not to question the novel virus that killed millions and millions more were saved from that likely came from gain of function and therefore will come again.

46:49.116 --> 46:52.238
their flag to one mass, whereas I just say I actually don't know.

46:52.379 --> 46:53.920
I have I think it might be this.

46:53.940 --> 46:54.600
I think it might be that.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.882
But I do know what I think it might be this.

46:56.962 --> 46:58.063
I think it might be that.

47:02.226 --> 47:06.209
He's never going to he's never going to show you any useful understanding.

47:06.249 --> 47:13.815
He's never going to show you that he's grown in his understanding, become more sophisticated in his his grasp of what might have happened.

47:13.875 --> 47:16.798
It's never going to happen because that's not what he's there for.

47:17.728 --> 47:19.189
He's there to waste your time.

47:19.209 --> 47:31.954
He's there to make sure that there's enough noise on his channel from Sasha Latupova and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone that people like Mike Yeadon and I can be put behind paywalls and it's all well and good.

47:32.967 --> 47:38.330
Keep in mind that I had one interview, my first interview with Doc Malek, was put behind a paywall.

47:38.831 --> 47:41.152
The second one wasn't, but the second one was crap.

47:41.653 --> 47:49.198
He talked for like half the time, and it was me repeating stuff that he apparently didn't understand from the first one, and still doesn't understand now.

47:49.898 --> 47:56.902
So despite all these possibilities, he's never really bothered to do any reading on his own, because he's got another podcast tomorrow, I guess.

47:59.704 --> 48:02.166
This is one of the biggest bullshitters on Earth right now.

48:04.451 --> 48:09.933
He's a gigantic fraud, and I feel very bad for him, because it's not gonna go well.

48:10.933 --> 48:17.195
If he keeps this charade up, it's the only way to see it as a charade.

48:18.276 --> 48:25.018
If he can talk to Sasha Latupova for a couple hours, this guy might as well be Shannon Joy.

48:26.999 --> 48:28.299
I mean, what are we dealing with here?

48:29.059 --> 48:30.240
Is this another EpiGirl?

48:32.261 --> 48:32.741
Probably.

48:33.441 --> 48:35.802
That's the best way to see it, I think, is an epigirl.

48:36.722 --> 48:43.884
I mean, of all the people in the UK that could be lauded as heroes, you know, I mean, seriously, this guy?

48:43.964 --> 48:44.444
Come on.

48:45.184 --> 48:45.864
Come on!

48:46.165 --> 48:47.325
I'm grounding myself now.

48:47.605 --> 48:51.066
In reality, I know where up is and where down is and where forward is, where back is.

48:51.426 --> 48:54.007
I do know medical ethics went out the window.

48:54.307 --> 48:57.628
I do know our freedom and our liberty were taken away from us.

48:57.688 --> 48:59.228
When did you figure that out, Doc?

49:00.914 --> 49:02.515
2022, was that when you figured it out?

49:02.555 --> 49:03.737
When was that exactly?

49:03.777 --> 49:04.637
Did you figure that out?

49:04.677 --> 49:05.638
That's strange to me.

49:05.659 --> 49:08.441
Ever properly returned.

49:08.682 --> 49:11.945
I do know bodily autonomy went out the window.

49:12.205 --> 49:13.687
I do know there was no informed consent.

49:13.707 --> 49:18.532
Not one person, not one of the billions of people who took those experimental shots had informed consent.

49:19.810 --> 49:22.251
I do know that mandates are the exact opposite of medical ethics.

49:22.351 --> 49:24.312
I do know that our politicians failed us.

49:24.392 --> 49:25.313
Our medics failed us.

49:25.393 --> 49:26.373
Our judiciary failed us.

49:26.653 --> 49:27.694
Our legal system failed us.

49:27.754 --> 49:29.035
Our law enforcement failed us.

49:29.415 --> 49:31.556
The pharmaceutical companies did exactly what they've always done.

49:31.576 --> 49:32.196
They never failed us.

49:32.236 --> 49:33.357
They're crooks, and they always have been.

49:34.297 --> 49:34.938
Everyone failed us.

49:35.618 --> 49:40.080
These are the things that ground me in reality, and I know I'm not some crazy conspiracy theorist.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.801
I know this is conspiracy reality.

49:42.721 --> 49:43.702
So that's the illusion.

49:44.926 --> 49:46.846
The illusion is that they failed us, see?

49:47.327 --> 49:56.089
He wants you to accept the same thing that Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, and everybody else, that it was a bungled response, that they went totalitarian and they shouldn't have.

49:56.549 --> 49:58.129
And so we better make better rules.

49:58.709 --> 50:02.931
We better make sure that the who doesn't change the treaty in the wrong ways.

50:07.032 --> 50:07.852
Each country

50:08.968 --> 50:11.990
had its unique set of weaknesses that were exploited.

50:12.150 --> 50:18.955
Each country needs to close those weaknesses, cure those fear, fix those weaknesses, close those loopholes.

50:20.216 --> 50:28.062
And anybody that's making international arguments about international solutions because this is an international problem is a liar.

50:30.452 --> 50:38.620
It's not an international problem and it's an American problem that we can get rid of the PREP Act and they don't have the ability to declare an emergency in the first place.

50:39.341 --> 50:40.743
Then we can work on other laws.

50:43.505 --> 50:45.287
None of these people are making that argument.

50:45.347 --> 50:49.632
None of these people are able to say anything useful because they don't have any fracking idea.

50:51.824 --> 50:55.068
No, I think you encapsulated it extremely well, and I totally agree with you.

50:55.429 --> 50:56.210
What did he say?

50:56.230 --> 50:58.052
He didn't say anything.

50:58.453 --> 51:01.717
I'm happy to say I don't know.

51:02.518 --> 51:03.539
I've been saying this the whole time.

51:03.599 --> 51:05.962
Just like you, I'm not sure about certain things.

51:06.262 --> 51:07.144
I think it could be this or that.

51:07.164 --> 51:08.045
There's these different scenarios.

51:08.285 --> 51:12.248
And so you're such an adult that you decided you don't have to figure out for yourself.

51:12.388 --> 51:15.029
You know, I just don't know which used car to buy.

51:15.049 --> 51:17.131
It's just so hard to figure it out.

51:17.191 --> 51:19.052
So I guess I'm just going to admit, I don't know.

51:19.072 --> 51:24.356
I might as well just go to the car lot and let the used car salesman tell me what I should buy.

51:24.396 --> 51:25.236
Cause I just don't know.

51:25.276 --> 51:26.037
It's just too much.

51:32.921 --> 51:36.442
They're giving everybody that listens to this the excuse to say, I just don't know.

51:36.502 --> 51:37.462
I could never learn this.

51:37.522 --> 51:38.443
It's too complicated.

51:38.483 --> 51:39.563
These people are too smart.

51:39.583 --> 51:40.983
These arguments are too detailed.

51:41.363 --> 51:49.706
I mean, if Doc Malek can't figure it out and he's podcasting full-time, how the hell am I going to figure it out while I'm raising three kids and trying to coach basketball and all this?

51:49.766 --> 51:50.666
I might as well just give up.

51:54.187 --> 51:58.648
I might as well just give up is the message that both of these jackasses are sending.

52:00.759 --> 52:02.560
They both had me on their podcast.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.921
They're both making jokes here.

52:04.941 --> 52:06.122
They don't know anything.

52:06.142 --> 52:09.404
I never heard anybody talk very smart about this stuff.

52:09.884 --> 52:12.265
Nobody ever really made any sense to me.

52:12.986 --> 52:15.187
So I just got to keep podcasting, I guess.

52:15.627 --> 52:17.048
Maybe someday it'll click.

52:21.022 --> 52:28.823
I think what we can agree on is what you say is that this was to usher in totalitarianism, a permanent biosecurity, total recall sort of state.

52:29.584 --> 52:33.044
So would they lie about it in order to do that, you two dumbasses?

52:34.644 --> 52:35.925
Of course they would lie about it.

52:35.945 --> 52:36.705
You know that.

52:36.765 --> 52:38.565
That's why you're doing your podcasts.

52:38.985 --> 52:41.266
That's why your podcasts have risen to where they are.

52:41.326 --> 52:43.506
They get on AM radio, they get around the world.

52:46.426 --> 52:47.547
This is bullshit.

52:47.607 --> 52:49.407
These people are bullshitting us.

52:51.139 --> 52:54.581
Or the very, very best case scenario.

52:54.641 --> 52:59.944
This guy's not willing to commit because he doesn't want to risk his bread money.

53:02.746 --> 53:08.029
Just like Malick's not willing to commit to anything because, you know, I just want to have the best podcast, a really high quality.

53:08.549 --> 53:15.573
Mark, it's not high enough quality, Mark, and I'm trying for really high quality audio podcasts with punch.

53:17.915 --> 53:31.580
He's not trying to save the world, he's trying to make a podcast that's got good punch, that's controversial, that people like to listen to, that sponsors will get into so that he can eventually be the chief surgical and medical officer of the wellness company or some shit.

53:33.609 --> 53:35.870
These people are not saving our grandkids.

53:35.910 --> 53:40.553
They are not fighting the vaccine schedule of America as a criminal enterprise.

53:40.593 --> 53:46.396
They're not trying to teach anybody the biology that would save them, because they just don't have any fracking idea.

53:47.816 --> 53:49.597
Definitively, that was what it was.

53:50.298 --> 53:51.918
One of the main things it was to do.

53:51.958 --> 53:58.422
And then, you know, I do have further questions, your thoughts on, you know, as you mentioned, the WHO World Government Treaty, as I like to call it, the big pharma death cult.

53:59.142 --> 54:00.943
You know, you, apparently you were cancelled.

54:01.504 --> 54:02.004
You don't exist.

54:02.024 --> 54:03.665
I'm talking to a ghost right now.

54:03.845 --> 54:07.748
There have been, I've talked on my TNT show, Dr. Mark Trocey in Canada.

54:08.068 --> 54:09.589
I'm a big fan of his in Ontario.

54:09.629 --> 54:11.070
He just got his license taken away.

54:11.610 --> 54:14.472
You had on Charles Hoff as well, I think in Canada, he's fighting a lawsuit.

54:14.492 --> 54:17.914
So there's still doctors, many doctors across the planet have been cancelled.

54:18.315 --> 54:20.736
Some have even disappeared and died under suspicious circumstances.

54:20.776 --> 54:26.140
So what's sort of been your experience as a doctor being cancelled?

54:26.877 --> 54:29.175
Yeah, I mean, I've just pinned you something over.

54:29.989 --> 54:35.731
So he's not gonna, I bet you dollars to donuts, he's not gonna give you any details about when it happened.

54:35.751 --> 54:57.197
He's not gonna say, so I was arguing with my boss in the hallway of the Pittsburgh School of Medicine and arguing with them that they were telling me to read the New York Times and I was calling them morons, that they had a university at a medical school and in a faculty and walking around the halls as tenure track faculty members and they're telling each other,

54:57.677 --> 55:22.323
to read the new york times how stupid it sounded and i was so angry about it in 2020 they told me never to come back in because they didn't feel comfortable that's not going to be the story here he's not going to give you any details about how it exactly fell apart for him and his family and his career they recruited this guy

55:23.817 --> 55:25.358
on Telegram, have a look at it and read the app.

55:25.718 --> 55:26.658
It's very relevant to what you said.

55:26.678 --> 55:27.238
And look at the time.

55:27.298 --> 55:28.539
So it's, you know, it's pretty hot.

55:28.559 --> 55:29.319
It's pretty current.

55:29.759 --> 55:30.179
All right.

55:30.219 --> 55:33.941
So someone just, I guess just today says, hi, I was trying to find you earlier in Gantz.

55:33.961 --> 55:34.661
I hope you're okay.

55:34.741 --> 55:35.041
I'm great.

55:35.181 --> 55:35.421
Thanks.

55:35.481 --> 55:37.182
No longer practicing canceled surgery.

55:37.202 --> 55:40.263
And I've left the GMC voluntarily had enough of the profession.

55:40.303 --> 55:42.324
And the lady says, sorry to hear that, but glad you're well.

55:43.064 --> 55:44.705
He left voluntarily.

55:49.407 --> 55:49.867
I'm sorry.

55:50.187 --> 55:51.667
We're very clear about that, right?

55:51.707 --> 55:52.988
That's not canceled.

55:55.123 --> 56:08.311
If you quit and start your own business or your own LLC or your own 501c3 and start getting paid $220,000 a year like Pierre Kory, it's not exactly the same as getting cancelled.

56:11.093 --> 56:18.178
If you lose your job at some shitty hippie university in Oregon and the settlement is $500,000, it's not exactly getting cancelled.

56:22.116 --> 56:31.262
If you get to then start a podcast and get to go in front of the Senate and whine about what your settlement didn't provide for your family because your dad didn't set you up well enough.

56:32.743 --> 56:34.244
This is all a joke to me.

56:36.686 --> 56:50.636
Ladies and gentlemen, we are under attack by traitors, Americans who work for weaponized piles of money that are willing to lie to you in order to make sure that you do not usefully inform yourself so that you can save your children from slavery.

56:52.543 --> 56:57.207
And whether these two guys are witting or unwitting participants in it, I don't really care.

56:57.267 --> 56:59.289
But I'm pretty sure Malik's gotta know.

57:03.232 --> 57:04.953
I'm pretty sure this guy's gotta know.

57:06.515 --> 57:10.278
I've had two hours of conversation with both of them, this one a long time ago.

57:11.800 --> 57:27.006
So to just casually drop some of the ideas that I'm talking about, some of the word combinations that I use, and just gloss over them as though both of you haven't talked to me, just the lowest kind of slimeball fakers I've ever imagined you could encounter.

57:30.208 --> 57:31.228
It's extraordinary.

57:33.148 --> 57:36.651
It's like they interview people, and they say, wow, I really understand.

57:36.691 --> 57:38.052
Your ideas are really cool.

57:38.112 --> 57:40.794
You're so, you finally cleared up some things for me.

57:40.834 --> 57:41.955
And then they go on to the next one.

57:41.995 --> 57:43.296
They say exactly the same thing.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.999
Wow, Peter McCullough, you really cleared everything up.

57:46.039 --> 57:47.920
Wow, Robert Malone, don't get so angry.

57:47.960 --> 57:48.961
You really are smart.

57:49.061 --> 57:50.022
Wow, that's awesome.

57:52.571 --> 57:53.312
What are you up to now?

57:53.572 --> 57:55.234
Never been happier as well with you.

57:55.254 --> 57:56.835
So I guess patients are still seeking you out.

57:57.176 --> 57:57.736
That's a doctor.

57:58.097 --> 57:59.338
So that's a private doctor.

58:00.099 --> 58:03.002
And she used to refer me patients, you know, every six months or whatever.

58:03.382 --> 58:05.745
So you know, she's a private family doctor in central London.

58:06.426 --> 58:07.447
And you know, anytime someone

58:07.927 --> 58:11.309
injures themselves or has a problem, she would ring me and say, oh, I've got this patient.

58:11.489 --> 58:12.650
I want your advice.

58:12.670 --> 58:13.991
Should I should I send a patient to you?

58:14.011 --> 58:14.531
What do you think?

58:15.051 --> 58:16.312
And I actually operated on her.

58:16.632 --> 58:17.273
She had a trauma.

58:17.373 --> 58:18.714
She broke her foot and I had to fix it.

58:18.974 --> 58:23.356
So, you know, she trusts me because, you know, I ended up fixing her foot.

58:24.057 --> 58:24.877
But yeah, that's my life now.

58:24.897 --> 58:27.859
You know, you know, you know, she you know, like you said, you just she just said, you know, I can't find you.

58:28.119 --> 58:28.459
I'm canceled.

58:28.479 --> 58:28.780
I'm a ghost.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.161
You know, I'm a ghost now.

58:32.002 --> 58:33.142
I've been wiped out, you know.

58:33.903 --> 58:35.884
You know, if someone said to me, you know, last year,

58:36.852 --> 58:41.094
You know, you'll be, you'll have, you'll, you'll no longer be able to practice your 25 year surgical career.

58:41.174 --> 58:41.634
Last year.

58:41.734 --> 58:44.575
So if someone said it last year, so it's really only been a year.

58:46.476 --> 58:47.237
It's just fake.

58:48.517 --> 58:58.522
He's been elevated with fake censorship, fake cancellation designed specifically to make sure that some podcast in the UK would take off and could be circulated.

58:58.582 --> 59:03.244
And part of this, this team worst case scenario that just can't seem to figure it out.

59:04.514 --> 59:07.575
They have just no frackin' idea after hundreds of hours of podcasting.

59:07.595 --> 59:08.856
I still don't know, man.

59:09.256 --> 59:10.516
They all sound good to me.

59:10.816 --> 59:12.577
Here, everything you work for has come to an end.

59:12.977 --> 59:21.300
You know, imagine like, you know, as a child, 14, 15 year old, you're working, sitting all these exams, trying to get, you know, the grades so that you can get the interviews.

59:21.400 --> 59:25.341
Does he seem like he's angry about losing a job or losing a career?

59:25.381 --> 59:26.722
Does he seem really pissed?

59:27.168 --> 59:31.852
med school, then you go to five med school interviews and you have rejections and then you get accepted.

59:31.892 --> 59:33.093
And then imagine how excited you are.

59:33.113 --> 59:36.837
Then you go to med school, five years of grueling lectures, exams every month.

59:37.297 --> 59:41.001
Then you have to do the junior doctor years and then struggle to get onto a surgical rotation.

59:41.561 --> 59:46.286
And then from that, do the research, the hard work and get onto a higher surgical rotation.

59:46.866 --> 59:52.674
and navigate past that, do fellowships, get a consultant job, become a consultant at the age of 36.

59:52.714 --> 59:54.616
You know, I became a consultant.

59:54.836 --> 59:58.701
So from the age of about 14, 15, I started this journey to become a doctor and a consultant.

59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.844
And I didn't become a consultant until I was 36.

01:00:01.545 --> 01:00:03.087
And then at the age of 48, you get told

01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:05.429
And it's all over son.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.830
We don't want you anymore.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.771
Not because any patient's upset with you.

01:00:08.831 --> 01:00:10.152
Not because you're a dangerous surgeon.

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:11.954
Actually, it turns out you're really good.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:14.195
And patients don't want to complain about you.

01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:15.316
But we don't like what you're saying.

01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:16.637
They don't like what you're saying.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.699
So we're gonna make make life so difficult for you.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.861
That you know what, you can't you can't tolerate it anymore.

01:00:23.122 --> 01:00:24.062
And so that's where I'm right now.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:29.106
I just don't have a lot of pity for him because it doesn't sound true to me.

01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:37.295
Basically, you know, speaking up for medical ethics, standing up for the truth, calling- What truth?

01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:38.456
What ethics?

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.137
When did you stand up?

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:42.618
Who did you save?

01:00:43.879 --> 01:00:50.223
They murdered people in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 when you were still doing something else.

01:00:50.283 --> 01:00:56.347
I guess building the, building the garden shed that you film in now, putting together that TIE fighter.

01:00:58.035 --> 01:01:00.778
Yeah, all the bullshit in this world, this clown world.

01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.420
And I'm not a single issue person.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.585
You know, I'm not, oh, you know, the transgender, we need to fight the transgender or, you know, oh, we needed early treatment.

01:01:08.725 --> 01:01:10.247
I'm the Ivermectin person.

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:13.349
You know, I'm not I'm not a super specialist in one area.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.152
I I am seeing the bigger picture now.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:16.773
All right.

01:01:17.595 --> 01:01:19.375
I thought you'd had no frackin' idea.

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:20.456
What's the bigger picture?

01:01:20.496 --> 01:01:21.896
I can't wait to hear it.

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:24.016
Multiple pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.

01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:27.897
And, uh, trust me, Hrovje, I... Is it Hrovje?

01:01:28.657 --> 01:01:29.117
Hrvoje.

01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:30.238
Hrvoje.

01:01:30.338 --> 01:01:30.598
Sorry.

01:01:31.038 --> 01:01:31.398
Hrvoje.

01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:32.518
I've totally messed up your name.

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:33.578
It's my f... Sorry.

01:01:33.598 --> 01:01:34.639
You know, people do this to me all the time.

01:01:34.679 --> 01:01:35.479
Now you know what it feels like to me.

01:01:35.639 --> 01:01:36.439
Ah-ah-ah-mad.

01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:37.459
So mad.

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:38.459
I'm mad.

01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:39.520
You know what?

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.400
You know my, my, you know, this is digressing.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.881
Do you know, honestly, when I was a little kid, I moved school once, and the teacher brought me to the front and said, what's your name?

01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:46.361
I went, Ahmed.

01:01:46.902 --> 01:01:47.923
Everyone, this is Muhammad Ali.

01:01:47.943 --> 01:01:48.464
I was like, what?

01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:53.293
You just reminded me, have you seen that skit with the ventriloquist guy, Ahmad the Dead Terrorist?

01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:55.406
No, I'm gonna send it to you.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:57.687
That made me laugh laugh out loud years ago.

01:01:57.727 --> 01:02:04.151
But uh, uh, anyways, yeah anyway Yeah, yeah I still can't do it.

01:02:04.171 --> 01:02:06.633
You just say her Herb Herb, right?

01:02:06.693 --> 01:02:18.420
So where were we so basically So basically her yeah, they don't they want they they just don't want me Practicing for speaking up and because i'm connecting all the dots i'm seeing all the jigsaw puzzle pieces and I don't say I have all the pieces

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.611
I wonder what pieces he's got.

01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:23.412
I can't wait for him to tell us one of those pieces.

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:27.153
You know, I think it's like a little children's piece initially, like 20 pieces.

01:02:27.433 --> 01:02:28.474
And I go, Oh, I got 10 pieces.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:29.134
I know what this is.

01:02:29.174 --> 01:02:30.935
And then suddenly I realized I said a hundred piece jigsaw puzzle.

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.175
And then I get 50 pieces.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.876
I go, Oh shit, it's 500.

01:02:35.497 --> 01:02:38.718
The more time goes by, the more I realize I have no idea what's going on.

01:02:39.018 --> 01:02:42.579
But what I do understand is there are multiple issues and they're all linked.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.821
So whether it's a climate scam, financial system,

01:02:46.761 --> 01:02:54.965
political system, the mass migration, invasion, the mRNA jabs and pandemics, the transgender ideology.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:58.386
You know, I mean, we could go on and on, dude.

01:02:58.426 --> 01:02:59.266
The endless wars.

01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:00.847
They're all linked.

01:03:02.247 --> 01:03:02.687
They're all linked.

01:03:02.907 --> 01:03:03.788
So I'm not a single issue guy.

01:03:03.828 --> 01:03:04.568
I'm trying to connect the dots.

01:03:04.588 --> 01:03:10.030
And my podcast is trying to cover all of these and make people realise there is a bigger game afoot.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:16.572
Because thinking like a surgeon and a doctor, which can't help because I've been, it's been more, I have my life, you know, more than half my life.

01:03:16.972 --> 01:03:20.534
And when you're treating an illness or a disease or an injury,

01:03:21.594 --> 01:03:23.076
One, you have to understand that there is a problem.

01:03:23.737 --> 01:03:24.918
That's number one.

01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:26.800
Number two, you need a diagnosis.

01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:28.822
You cannot treat symptoms.

01:03:29.343 --> 01:03:31.926
If you treat symptoms, you're not treating the root cause.

01:03:32.927 --> 01:03:34.749
So what's the diagnosis, Malik?

01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.530
They'll come back.

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.912
So you need to understand, first of all, there is a problem.

01:03:38.693 --> 01:03:40.354
Then you need to understand what the problem is.

01:03:41.014 --> 01:03:44.476
Then you need to start... He's got no fracking idea what the problem is.

01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:47.037
He just got through explaining that for a half an hour.

01:03:47.137 --> 01:03:53.060
I don't understand how much more contradiction can we have in one interview and we're not even 15 minutes in.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.161
Treatment options.

01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:56.442
And the treatment options are typically multifactorial.

01:03:57.102 --> 01:03:59.364
You shouldn't always just focus on one thing as an operation.

01:03:59.784 --> 01:04:10.673
You know, I used to say, maybe lose weight, optimize your weight, reduce your stress levels, you know, and improve your diet, get some physiotherapy, adjust your footwear, you know, and then you attack the problem from multiple things because

01:04:11.437 --> 01:04:13.359
The root problem never really is one issue.

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:16.201
There were multiple issues that led to the problem developing in the first place.

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:20.645
So to fix that problem, the idea that it's just one thing you need to do to fix it is ridiculous as well.

01:04:20.685 --> 01:04:23.628
You need to attack all the things that led you to that point.

01:04:24.129 --> 01:04:29.373
But going back to where we are right now, the clown world, the inverted world, upside down world, can I swear on the show?

01:04:29.573 --> 01:04:31.475
The shit show world, you know, the shit show world.

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:37.340
You know, we need to identify that there are multiple avenues to where we have come to this point in time.

01:04:38.121 --> 01:04:41.684
And if we don't address all of them somehow, we won't fix anything.

01:04:41.804 --> 01:04:43.846
We won't make the world a better place.

01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:45.247
It's just pathetic.

01:04:45.287 --> 01:04:52.193
I've been trying to do that for over a decade on my podcast as well, talking to everyone from all walks on different subjects and to piece everything together.

01:04:52.213 --> 01:04:54.055
That's why I call it geopolitics and empire.

01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:55.936
We talked about that on your podcast, right?

01:04:56.217 --> 01:04:58.539
Geopolitics, the science of how things work.

01:04:58.559 --> 01:04:59.720
And then it's all about

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:26.563
empire right globalism and I love your attitude maybe we can talk about that later that you don't you don't skip a beat you know as you just outlined decades of your life's work and you don't skip a beat you know I've got um from the art of manliness Rudyard Kipling's poem right in front of me if where he he says specifically you know if if you he says um you you risk all of your winnings on one turn of pitch and toss and you lose and you start again at your beginning and never breathe a word about your loss

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:32.286
You're a man, and that's what you're doing, and what many of us, friends of mine, have had to do.

01:05:32.546 --> 01:05:32.846
What?

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:36.628
Seriously?

01:05:38.009 --> 01:05:39.790
Did he just say what I think he just said?

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:45.252
Did he just encourage people not to apologize for the mistakes they made, not to admit that they screwed up?

01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.372
What kind of bullshit was that?

01:05:51.532 --> 01:05:53.252
And I love your attitude.

01:05:53.272 --> 01:06:00.534
Maybe we can talk about that later, that you don't you don't skip a beat, you know, as you just outlined decades of your life's work and you don't skip a beat.

01:06:00.554 --> 01:06:17.059
You know, I've got from the art of manliness, Rudyard Kipling's poem right in front of me, if where he says specifically, you know, if you he says you risk all of your winnings on one turn of pitch and toss and you lose and you start again at your beginning and never breathe a word about your loss.

01:06:17.779 --> 01:06:34.891
you're a man and that's what that's what you're what you're doing and what many of us friends of mine have had to do they've been fired from their jobs for not wanting to be injected with pentagon juices i uh i call it and so what would be your we all we all have to try you know to extrapolate what what would be your sort of master thesis as to what

01:06:35.581 --> 01:06:39.862
they're trying to do because, you know, we've got the WHO pandemic treaty, the international health regulations.

01:06:40.242 --> 01:06:42.523
I talked last week to James Roguski, who's really on that.

01:06:43.103 --> 01:06:45.644
And so what are your thoughts about that?

01:06:45.664 --> 01:06:52.326
That's the fourth time we've mentioned the WHO and the IHR times four now.

01:06:53.366 --> 01:06:55.586
And then he's now mentioning Roguski.

01:06:59.908 --> 01:07:01.068
We might be headed.

01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:01.961
All right.

01:07:02.002 --> 01:07:02.222
OK.

01:07:02.863 --> 01:07:02.983
Yeah.

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:08.532
I mean, going back to your your geopolitics podcast, it really is epic, by the way, really is epic.

01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:10.515
Oh, just flattery again.

01:07:10.615 --> 01:07:11.917
Epic podcast, by the way.

01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:14.321
That last one that I listened to is Rurik was classic.

01:07:14.601 --> 01:07:15.222
Fantastic.

01:07:15.342 --> 01:07:16.865
So I just want to say, you know.

01:07:17.955 --> 01:07:19.296
I've really moved over to.

01:07:19.316 --> 01:07:21.919
I don't think he understands what Kipling meant either.

01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:24.321
It's absolutely disgusting what happened there.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:25.362
I mean, I'm just shocked.

01:07:25.422 --> 01:07:27.684
I don't even know where to begin listening to a lot of your podcasts.

01:07:27.704 --> 01:07:31.788
And I'll be honest with you, because I just find some of the other ones that I was listening to, they're just too frivolous and too.

01:07:32.609 --> 01:07:34.871
I used to listen to a lot of James and Joe Rogan.

01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:37.293
And I feel something's happened.

01:07:37.313 --> 01:07:37.473
You know,

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:40.516
He talks about Elon Musk all the time, and it's like, yawn.

01:07:40.876 --> 01:07:42.597
He talks about transhumanism, yawn.

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:44.698
He talks about Russian bots all the time, yawn.

01:07:45.099 --> 01:07:48.141
It's just the same stuff coming, and it's almost like, are you being paid to say all this stuff?

01:07:48.501 --> 01:07:49.982
It's like, I'm not interested.

01:07:50.322 --> 01:07:51.383
And I listen to you.

01:07:51.523 --> 01:07:54.385
Oh, so Rogan's being paid, but he's not.

01:07:56.006 --> 01:08:00.589
And this is just really basic psychological warfare here.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.351
Accuse your enemy of what you're doing.

01:08:03.791 --> 01:08:04.752
I mean, this is pathetic.

01:08:06.133 --> 01:08:07.974
I just find it hilarious to me.

01:08:09.181 --> 01:08:10.422
And I go, nah, don't want to listen to it.

01:08:10.442 --> 01:08:11.302
And I pop yours on.

01:08:11.823 --> 01:08:18.807
And I think, you know, I wrote my substat today, you know, why geopolitics should interest everyone and its effect on health, freedom, and happiness.

01:08:18.847 --> 01:08:20.468
You know, I posted our conversation.

01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:25.691
Because it impacts every aspect of our lives and health.

01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:31.054
So, you know, really well done for the work that you've been doing and the amazing guests that you've been getting on.

01:08:31.535 --> 01:08:37.679
But I mean, before I talk about the bigger picture and what I think is going on and, you know, appreciate that I might be wrong, you know, let's talk about this IHR who thing.

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:39.680
And, you know, I'm not going to say I'm plagiarizing this.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.683
I'm taking this from David Thunder's Freedom Blog sub stack, right?

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:55.911
He's a. You know, he's done some great work on this, and he talks about these proposed amendments to the IHR and it would set in motion a dangerous who led global bureaucracy, and that's what we're worried about.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:09:04.593
And the thing is, you know, the WHO are going to get together, they're going to have a world assembly, 27th of May to the 1st of June, and they're going to talk about these IHR amendments.

01:09:05.214 --> 01:09:19.678
And if a simple majority of the delegates... Now, interestingly enough, right, we, you may be familiar, if you've been on Twitter today, that all of those people that I call meddlers were all there for this talk that he was plugging a couple months before it happened.

01:09:24.907 --> 01:09:26.148
Steve Kirsch is there.

01:09:26.168 --> 01:09:28.389
Asim Malhotra is there.

01:09:29.049 --> 01:09:30.389
Brett Weinstein's there.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:32.810
Jessica Rose is there.

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.592
Brian Cole is there.

01:09:36.632 --> 01:09:37.292
They're all there.

01:09:38.533 --> 01:09:50.738
At this thing that a couple months ago, he thought he needed to mention already on a podcast to make sure that everybody who's listening knows that the WHO is important and the international health regulations are important, mentioning five times now.

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:59.695
And a meeting where all of these people have been, where the contents of the meeting are being broadcast live by CHD.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:08.600
That's pretty extraordinary level of continuity in the heads up system that seems to be happening here supposedly at random.

01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:22.394
tickets, vote yay, then unless the heads of state formally reject them within, you know, 10 months of that period, they will be passed through and be, you know, be ratified.

01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:24.677
And it's then, you know, you're bound by international law.

01:10:25.197 --> 01:10:26.860
And the funny thing about that is,

01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:28.501
Think about that.

01:10:29.122 --> 01:10:29.902
It's a passive thing.

01:10:30.642 --> 01:10:33.083
So it's not like the heads of state have to vote for it.

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:34.804
The governments have to discuss it.

01:10:34.904 --> 01:10:38.106
And it's going through Parliament or the Assembly.

01:10:38.366 --> 01:10:39.146
And they're voting.

01:10:39.246 --> 01:10:40.647
And then there's a democratic process.

01:10:41.707 --> 01:10:44.329
If they don't say anything or do anything, it's going to happen anyway.

01:10:45.213 --> 01:10:46.093
Do you see how clever that is?

01:10:46.773 --> 01:10:50.454
So it's just implied, you know, that, yeah, this is going to pass through.

01:10:50.794 --> 01:10:55.996
This is the same, the same story, internet, you know, membership things that you do, you know, go try.

01:10:56.096 --> 01:10:58.316
It's the same story that Meryl Nass is selling.

01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:04.438
It's the same story that that they're all selling right now, that we have to think about the who, that there's nothing that we could do at home.

01:11:05.472 --> 01:11:08.453
There's nothing that we could do in the UK to change things.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.735
There's nothing we could do in Canada or in America to change things.

01:11:12.215 --> 01:11:14.256
We've got a rally against the who.

01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:20.299
And that's why just this week, Bret Weinstein declared on his podcast that we had had a major victory.

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:28.343
That's why this week, Meryl Nass said that, I don't know what you guys are doing, but I'm drinking champagne because we just had a major victory against the who.

01:11:31.124 --> 01:11:31.844
Stop lying.

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.286
This is all part of the show.

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:38.694
It's all part of the slow roll show.

01:11:38.834 --> 01:11:46.363
This is just another epi girl who's saying what he's told to say at the right time and nothing more because he's got no frackin' idea.

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:49.046
Free trial for 28 days.

01:11:49.146 --> 01:11:51.649
And when you do the 28 days, you know, free trial, you have to give all your bank details.

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:57.463
And they go, if you don't cancel within a certain period, we're going to charge you for a year or whatever.

01:11:58.084 --> 01:12:00.005
You have to actively cancel it.

01:12:00.285 --> 01:12:03.768
If you don't do anything or if you forget or whatever, that's it.

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:04.608
You're paying up.

01:12:04.969 --> 01:12:05.429
You're signed up.

01:12:05.749 --> 01:12:06.810
It's kind of dodgy tactics.

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:08.071
And that's what they're doing.

01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.372
And these IHR, there's lots of amendments.

01:12:10.632 --> 01:12:14.375
But David did some really good work and distilled it into eight key things.

01:12:14.415 --> 01:12:15.236
I'm not going to go through it all.

01:12:15.836 --> 01:12:26.662
But basically what it does is instead of the WHO being just simple, you know, the WHO is giving information, the WHO is now the source of all the advice and guidance and is the coordinating authority.

01:12:26.702 --> 01:12:36.728
So instead of the national governments having their public health officials and scientists and experts deciding how to react to something, it's now going to be the WHO and its team of experts.

01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:39.210
Now you're creating a single point of failure.

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:42.752
So whereas before you've got redundancies, some countries might get it right, some countries might get it wrong.

01:12:43.874 --> 01:12:45.697
Now everything's going to be done by the who.

01:12:45.957 --> 01:12:52.046
And not just that, you need to understand that normally when it's a government, it should be elected and representing the people.

01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:53.809
Now you've got the who.

01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:54.430
Who elected them?

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:55.988
Who are they representing?

01:12:56.588 --> 01:12:57.770
And where's the funding coming from?

01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:07.860
And as we know, I've spoken to, for example, David Bell, who was a, who worked for the, who is an insider, worked with Bill Gates as well, who is now heavily funded and influenced by corporations and individuals.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.666
Gavi and Bill and Gates, Middle India Foundation, individual, you know, companies and big pharma.

01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:16.649
And the way they work with their money when they donate, it's not like

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:18.751
Buddy, I really like you.

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:19.132
You know what?

01:13:19.152 --> 01:13:19.872
Here's 10 pound.

01:13:20.072 --> 01:13:42.010
I want to give you 10 but not for people obviously, but are we really supposed to believe that this little dipshit is the is the guy we should be listening to about international law the UN and the who This is what he's learned since he decided to pull his head out Since he got cancelled and voluntarily quit because they made it so hard on him.

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.050
I

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:46.531
What a tremendous liar.

01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:48.152
What a traitor to UK.

01:13:48.212 --> 01:13:51.295
Like he hasn't even mentioned one murder in the UK yet.

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:52.676
What a traitor.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:14:01.763
Anyone from the UK that sees this guy talking to an American and not saying that they murdered people in the UK, man, and they lied about it.

01:14:02.283 --> 01:14:03.284
They starved people.

01:14:03.324 --> 01:14:10.469
They let people die of urinary tract infections, of cold, of lack of water, and midazolam.

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.271
Has he said that yet?

01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:15.931
No, he has not.

01:14:17.393 --> 01:14:19.176
But he's talked plenty about the who.

01:14:19.857 --> 01:14:23.644
And he's talked plenty about his own, wow, I was really suffering boy.

01:14:23.684 --> 01:14:25.026
He sure is a suffering guy.

01:14:26.252 --> 01:14:27.973
OK, I'll send you $10 of Bitcoin.

01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:29.573
And you're like, thanks, Ahmed.

01:14:30.234 --> 01:14:31.674
And then I go, no, no, there's a catch.

01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:32.995
And you go, there's a catch?

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:37.657
I go, yeah, Herve, um, Herve, Herve, Herve, Herve.

01:14:37.997 --> 01:14:39.278
Still can't say it, Herve.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:43.199
Basically, you can only spend those $10 on tacos.

01:14:45.865 --> 01:14:47.006
And you go, tacos.

01:14:47.466 --> 01:14:48.087
I want petrol.

01:14:48.427 --> 01:14:50.769
Nope, I'm giving you $10 tacos.

01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:54.692
And you're like, all right, OK, I don't want to eat tacos tonight.

01:14:54.712 --> 01:14:55.292
I don't have tacos.

01:14:55.552 --> 01:14:56.293
There's another catch.

01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:56.913
What?

01:14:57.073 --> 01:14:57.654
What's the next catch?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.535
Well, these tacos, you have to buy them from my shop.

01:14:59.935 --> 01:15:02.097
It's like, you know, it just came ridiculous.

01:15:02.117 --> 01:15:08.762
So they apply funding, but then there's, you know, they've got stipulations on how the money is spent, what they spend it on.

01:15:09.383 --> 01:15:09.843
Guess what?

01:15:10.303 --> 01:15:12.145
A lot of it is spent on vaccines.

01:15:13.183 --> 01:15:14.184
And why do you need vaccines?

01:15:14.204 --> 01:15:15.525
Well, you need vaccines for viruses.

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.266
Why do you need viruses everywhere?

01:15:17.306 --> 01:15:19.508
Well, there might be a deadly virus, so-called pandemic.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:22.090
So now you're looking for them.

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:30.757
So one of the other things this thing does is it wants you to create this system where you're constantly looking for potential causes of viruses and outbreaks.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.259
So you've got this pandemic preparedness industry.

01:15:33.299 --> 01:15:34.500
You're sampling and testing.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.020
Guess what?

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.102
You're going to find millions of viruses and mutations everywhere.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:39.524
Every time you find a mutation, you're going to go, oh my god.

01:15:39.964 --> 01:15:41.925
there's a pandemic, but you know, it doesn't even have to be a pandemic.

01:15:42.345 --> 01:15:51.429
One of the things that David pointed out was, um, number seven, I think it was, it wasn't even like there is a pandemic.

01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:53.709
It's, there's a potential for one.

01:15:54.430 --> 01:16:00.892
It's, you know, it's removing the terminology so that it's like, there may be, you know, the potential for an emergency.

01:16:00.912 --> 01:16:04.754
And then they use vague terms like, you know, an emergent problem or, or

01:16:08.539 --> 01:16:12.180
Is anybody going to take this guy seriously that these are his ideas?

01:16:14.461 --> 01:16:14.741
Really?

01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:19.182
Is he still saying anything useful or not really?

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.263
Pandemic potential was created by lying.

01:16:25.123 --> 01:16:27.604
Pandemic potential was created by lying.

01:16:29.544 --> 01:16:31.825
He could explain it very simply, but he's not.

01:16:34.963 --> 01:16:37.284
you know, an intermediate problem or an emergency.

01:16:37.564 --> 01:16:39.705
And it's like, what do they actually, what do they actually mean by these terms?

01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:40.565
Like what?

01:16:41.005 --> 01:16:43.886
And if you think about it, they called COVID a pandemic.

01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:44.866
Really?

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:46.047
On what basis?

01:16:46.767 --> 01:16:50.928
Now their definition of pandemic has changed, you know, recently, well, 2014 or whatever it was.

01:16:50.948 --> 01:16:52.729
This is such bullshit.

01:16:52.809 --> 01:16:55.029
This is stuff that people were talking about it in 2020.

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:55.450
It's now 2024.

01:17:00.868 --> 01:17:08.855
Is he really retelling this stupid shit about the definition of a pandemic, the definition of a vaccine being changed?

01:17:10.397 --> 01:17:12.018
It happened while he was still working.

01:17:15.441 --> 01:17:18.925
Why hasn't Herb asked him whether he took the shot or not since he didn't come out?

01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:20.546
Did he take the shot in order to work?

01:17:20.586 --> 01:17:22.408
Didn't you have to take the shot in order to work?

01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:24.510
Where are the real questions?

01:17:30.919 --> 01:17:33.680
The layperson, if you say, you know, what do you think a pandemic is?

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:41.982
You think it's this deadly contagion spreading wildly across the world, killing lots of people.

01:17:42.443 --> 01:17:42.763
Am I right?

01:17:43.623 --> 01:17:52.506
Well, that definition has now changed, and I don't know what the latest one is, but it doesn't, it's just basically any kind of virus, infection, you know, whatever, contagion, but there's no deadly component to it anymore.

01:17:53.277 --> 01:18:00.419
So if you look at COVID, the average age of death, you know, of COVID and nothing else was greater than the average life expectancy.

01:18:00.579 --> 01:18:01.039
Did you hear that?

01:18:01.319 --> 01:18:07.121
So if your average life expectancy, for example, in the UK is 78, 79, the average age of someone dying of COVID was 82.

01:18:08.322 --> 01:18:10.382
So having COVID meant you lived longer than average.

01:18:11.123 --> 01:18:11.643
It was crazy.

01:18:12.443 --> 01:18:13.543
And so what's deadly about that?

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.724
And, you know, and the data that came through

01:18:19.468 --> 01:18:23.329
And please tell me you hear that he has still not explained that they murdered people.

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:28.650
He's explaining that they died of COVID.

01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:31.731
These old people died of COVID.

01:18:32.371 --> 01:18:37.212
After we watched some of those documentaries about Scotland and the UK, do you think those people died of COVID?

01:18:40.533 --> 01:18:47.475
If you're not really angry right now at this little shit, this little mealy mouth piece of shit,

01:18:48.487 --> 01:18:51.111
traitor for the UK and everywhere else.

01:18:52.293 --> 01:18:55.218
He still hasn't said that they murdered people in the UK.

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.463
He said that old people died of it.

01:18:58.543 --> 01:18:59.965
He lives longer then.

01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:01.768
He's laughing about it.

01:19:03.631 --> 01:19:10.753
And I don't know what the latest one is, but it doesn't, it's just basically any kind of virus infection, you know, whatever, contagion, but there's no deadly component to it anymore.

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:18.636
So if you look at COVID, the average age of death, you know, of COVID and nothing else was greater than the average life expectancy.

01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:19.256
Did you hear that?

01:19:19.536 --> 01:19:25.358
So if your average life expectancy, for example, in the UK is 78 or 79, the average age of someone dying of COVID was 82.

01:19:26.538 --> 01:19:28.599
So having COVID meant you lived longer than average.

01:19:29.339 --> 01:19:29.839
It was crazy.

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:36.657
So after all this study and after all this podcasting, he's pretty sure you can still just have COVID.

01:19:37.578 --> 01:19:38.338
COVID's a thing.

01:19:39.119 --> 01:19:42.242
He's not even gotten so far as to question whether COVID is a thing.

01:19:42.262 --> 01:19:43.163
He's a doctor.

01:19:52.072 --> 01:19:54.114
Thomas Bender questions whether it's a thing.

01:19:56.883 --> 01:19:58.984
Sukrit Bhakti questions whether it's a thing.

01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:01.165
Mike Yeadon questions whether it's a thing.

01:20:01.305 --> 01:20:02.706
I question whether it's a thing.

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:04.826
He doesn't.

01:20:05.647 --> 01:20:06.487
Malone doesn't.

01:20:07.468 --> 01:20:08.268
Corey doesn't.

01:20:09.969 --> 01:20:10.769
Cole doesn't.

01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:12.049
McCullough doesn't.

01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:13.850
Ladies and gentlemen, wake up.

01:20:16.451 --> 01:20:17.572
And so what's deadly about that?

01:20:18.072 --> 01:20:22.354
And the data that came through, it wasn't any worse than an average seasonal flu.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:28.214
And then if you look at the way it spread, you had these hotspots in New Jersey, New York, and Lombardy, and London.

01:20:28.734 --> 01:20:32.877
But then just across the state line, or just across another country, there was nothing going on.

01:20:33.518 --> 01:20:38.442
You had problems in Spain, but maybe not in Portugal, or nothing in Malta, nothing in France.

01:20:38.462 --> 01:20:40.684
You know, it was just, what kind of virus does that?

01:20:41.584 --> 01:20:44.807
You know, this so deadly, contagious virus, with people flying.

01:20:44.827 --> 01:20:45.727
Remember, planes were flying.

01:20:46.128 --> 01:20:48.089
People were embarking, disembarking, all the time.

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:52.593
I mean, you know those movies where they show the red dots, and they're covering the whole Earth?

01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:53.846
That never happened.

01:20:54.927 --> 01:20:58.069
And if you ask the average person on the street, did you see anyone fall down and drop dead?

01:20:58.389 --> 01:20:59.630
Do you know anyone who died of COVID?

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.411
Most people shrug their shoulders and go, no.

01:21:01.431 --> 01:21:03.732
So there's nothing really deadly about COVID.

01:21:03.752 --> 01:21:05.133
There's nothing really special about COVID.

01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:06.754
And most people recovered from it.

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:07.814
And if they recovered from it.

01:21:07.895 --> 01:21:10.756
So COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID is, COVID is real.

01:21:10.816 --> 01:21:11.557
COVID is real.

01:21:11.637 --> 01:21:13.138
COVID is real, but it wasn't bad.

01:21:13.198 --> 01:21:13.898
COVID is real.

01:21:13.978 --> 01:21:14.638
COVID is real.

01:21:14.678 --> 01:21:15.679
I mean, COVID is real.

01:21:15.759 --> 01:21:20.762
COVID is definitely real, but I mean, COVID isn't as bad as they said COVID would be real, COVID.

01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:28.138
means their immune system was amazing, and it meant that their immune system recognized something about this, and it wasn't that novel as they were saying.

01:21:28.839 --> 01:21:38.592
Oh, so that sounds a lot like Kevin McKernan in April 24th, 2020, when everything has an ancestor, and so it's not novel.

01:21:38.652 --> 01:21:40.414
I mean, they're lying if they say it's novel.

01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:45.032
We're not even testing in the backwoods of China.

01:21:45.052 --> 01:21:47.292
There's no sequencing there, so who knows how long.

01:21:47.332 --> 01:21:53.414
It could have been 40 or 80 years circulating in the background of China, according to Kevin McKernan, on the 24th of April, 2020.

01:21:54.054 --> 01:21:57.735
And now here's him saying the same thing in 2024.

01:21:57.795 --> 01:21:58.575
That's great.

01:21:58.995 --> 01:22:00.355
That's just great, isn't it?

01:22:00.395 --> 01:22:01.395
I'm thinking about your body.

01:22:01.415 --> 01:22:03.196
He said, I know you, mister.

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:06.277
I mean, you're slightly different, but you're not that different.

01:22:06.337 --> 01:22:07.877
I don't know how to tackle you and deal with you.

01:22:08.922 --> 01:22:14.124
So the WHO said this was a pandemic, and we had all the lockdowns and all this nonsense.

01:22:14.484 --> 01:22:19.986
And, you know, remember Professor Neil Ferguson's modeling, his faulty modeling, and I think it was report A or whatever it was.

01:22:20.006 --> 01:22:21.367
It wasn't even a peer-reviewed paper.

01:22:21.387 --> 01:22:24.288
It was just basically an opinion with shitty modeling.

01:22:24.348 --> 01:22:26.109
If you put rubbish into a model, you get rubbish out.

01:22:26.569 --> 01:22:28.530
And, you know, he was like, oh my God, this many people are going to die.

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:29.730
And people took that.

01:22:31.671 --> 01:22:34.732
So what is the rubbish that you put into a model, Ahmed?

01:22:38.888 --> 01:22:43.311
Come on, Ahmed, what's the rubbish that you put into a model you're so freaking smart?

01:22:46.733 --> 01:22:47.294
It's data.

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:53.338
The model that was fed data that was based on murder.

01:22:54.559 --> 01:23:02.765
Murder in New York, murder in Lombardy, probably murder in the UK was used to extend those models into time.

01:23:04.065 --> 01:23:04.506
Murder.

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:08.626
Data about murder was filed and fed.

01:23:08.826 --> 01:23:10.967
It's not just garbage in, garbage out.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:12.589
Tell me what you know.

01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:21.476
The garbage that they put into those models was based on mass casualty events that were probably created by murder.

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:33.626
The pulse ox debacle and the high flow nasal oxygen drama.

01:23:34.705 --> 01:24:03.710
debacle that you can't seem to talk about because you've got it all figured out you know there's a lot of puzzle pieces so every time i think i got 10 puzzle pieces now i find out it's a hundred piece puzzle so i got no frackin idea governments took that and who took this and they ran the whole covid plan shit show so they got it wrong they got wrong big time so we know they get it wrong you got it wrong otherwise you would have been out doing something you're still getting it wrong you don't know anything

01:24:04.636 --> 01:24:08.158
Human beings, they're just people and they're heavily influenced by Big Pharma.

01:24:08.759 --> 01:24:17.344
And now we're going to give them the power to do this again and again and again and bypass national sovereignty and national experts and public health officials.

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:20.446
So, you know, it's basically centralization.

01:24:20.566 --> 01:24:29.011
And the best thing about centralization is the mafia cabal loves it because instead of going around to 10 people or 100 people and bribing them and extort.

01:24:30.132 --> 01:24:31.513
He would have made a great radar, though.

01:24:32.438 --> 01:24:34.639
I mean, he would have made a great radar though.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.142
That guy would make a great radar on mass.

01:24:38.302 --> 01:24:39.322
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:24:40.603 --> 01:24:42.564
King from them and threatening them.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:44.365
And they just go to one person.

01:24:45.326 --> 01:24:45.546
All right.

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:49.288
You're, you're in charge of all these people, but all we need to do is put the pressure on you and you'll do what we tell you.

01:24:49.308 --> 01:24:50.429
And then everyone else will fall in line.

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:52.831
So centralization is a bad thing.

01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:58.634
And again, if you go back to that chat that I had with David Bell, he was telling me like, look, a lot of these people in the who, you know, they came, they're good people.

01:24:58.654 --> 01:24:59.715
They come from the third world.

01:24:59.735 --> 01:25:00.595
They don't have that much money.

01:25:00.615 --> 01:25:01.296
Suddenly they're in Geneva.

01:25:02.236 --> 01:25:02.677
Living it up.

01:25:02.817 --> 01:25:03.317
Larging it up.

01:25:03.497 --> 01:25:03.978
Big house.

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:04.578
Swimming pool.

01:25:05.079 --> 01:25:05.819
Private schooling.

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.540
Health insurance.

01:25:07.081 --> 01:25:09.323
Their family member might be sick and now suddenly they're getting healthcare.

01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:10.504
It's a crucial number.

01:25:11.465 --> 01:25:13.086
Once they arrive, they don't want to go back.

01:25:13.747 --> 01:25:15.208
It's a nice place to live.

01:25:15.248 --> 01:25:15.709
Good food.

01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.850
Nice in the summer.

01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:18.591
Skiing in the winter.

01:25:19.032 --> 01:25:19.672
What's not to love?

01:25:22.054 --> 01:25:23.676
So you're saying that they lied.

01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:26.979
Without saying that they lied.

01:25:31.124 --> 01:25:35.887
I mean, how long is it gonna take for him to just say that these people have so many different reasons to lie?

01:25:37.268 --> 01:25:38.549
It's hard for me to list them all.

01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:43.992
They have so many different ways they've lied, it's hard to list them all.

01:25:44.052 --> 01:25:45.613
Why are we not able to say this?

01:25:46.874 --> 01:25:49.095
Why is no one able to say this but me?

01:25:50.997 --> 01:25:52.398
What the hell is going on here?

01:25:53.798 --> 01:25:55.900
They use all these words to say nothing.

01:25:56.343 --> 01:25:56.824
They want to stay.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:58.245
And people stay.

01:25:58.846 --> 01:25:59.507
No one really goes.

01:26:00.328 --> 01:26:02.070
And to stay, you need to conform.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.291
You don't want to upset anyone.

01:26:03.311 --> 01:26:04.493
You don't want to upset your funders.

01:26:05.354 --> 01:26:06.835
Oh, hello, whatever foundation.

01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:09.138
You're giving us $5 million and you want us to do this?

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:10.240
Oh, OK, we'll do that.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:15.546
Yeah, and my job and all my people below me, their jobs depend on your funding and grant.

01:26:15.766 --> 01:26:16.327
We'll go along.

01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:18.192
That's what's happening.

01:26:18.212 --> 01:26:22.956
It's just simple human incentives and corruption.

01:26:23.076 --> 01:26:26.519
But that's not to say that there aren't some evil individuals at the top driving this.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:34.927
So ultimately, what this whole IHR and WHO is doing is creating a supernational layer above sovereign states.

01:26:35.988 --> 01:26:40.933
And it's the embryo of the one world government.

01:26:42.338 --> 01:26:44.143
the embryo of the one world government.

01:26:44.163 --> 01:26:47.733
So how should we get to the abortion of the one world government?

01:26:47.753 --> 01:26:50.199
Are you going to give us a solution to that or that's just your...

01:26:51.633 --> 01:26:58.216
You're just explaining to us how the embryo will go through blastula to, you know, whatever, right?

01:26:58.236 --> 01:27:02.617
You're just explaining the embryonic development of the New World Order or what?

01:27:02.757 --> 01:27:04.898
Like, what the hell is this?

01:27:05.578 --> 01:27:07.039
Let's bypass sovereign states.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:07.919
They don't know what they're doing.

01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:11.541
The WHO is deciding what needs to be done, this emergency, whatever it might be.

01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:17.183
And I forgot to mention the other thing that IHR WHO want to do is, you know, they want to expand the WHO emergency power.

01:27:17.603 --> 01:27:28.688
he looked down at his notes again and forgot that he mentioned forgot to mention one thing so under these revised regulations you know david talks about the director of the who you know who is some people say a terrorist and isn't even a medical doctor

01:27:29.352 --> 01:27:30.994
I call him Tedros the terrorist, yeah.

01:27:31.054 --> 01:27:31.474
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:31.695 --> 01:27:36.560
Based on the opinion, advice of the emergency committee, and you know, who is the emergency committee?

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:37.661
Who elected them, right?

01:27:38.482 --> 01:27:43.867
They may designate an event as having the potential to develop into a public health emergency of international concern.

01:27:44.248 --> 01:27:51.716
And then the Health and Human Services Secretary will declare an emergency under the PREP Act, and then all this shit will follow.

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:59.981
If we want it to stop, we fall out of the WHO, we fall out of the UN, and we repeal the PREP Act.

01:28:01.382 --> 01:28:02.082
It's pretty easy.

01:28:03.704 --> 01:28:11.010
Of course, as a UK guy, he probably doesn't know this, or pretends that he doesn't know it, and so he doesn't have any obligation to say it.

01:28:13.071 --> 01:28:18.656
But there's an American on this stream who apparently, after all this podcasting, still hasn't figured out priority list.

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.404
Holy balls, we are in trouble.

01:28:22.886 --> 01:28:24.129
We are in really big trouble.

01:28:24.889 --> 01:28:26.790
communicate this and recommend measures to state parties.

01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.530
Did you hear that?

01:28:28.151 --> 01:28:28.631
Potential.

01:28:28.891 --> 01:28:30.031
So it doesn't even need to be one.

01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:31.972
They just think it's got the potential of something.

01:28:31.992 --> 01:28:34.914
And then they can start telling the states what to do.

01:28:35.294 --> 01:28:39.976
And the states are under legal obligation to kind of like follow and do as they're told.

01:28:40.997 --> 01:28:46.980
And, you know, this concept of a potential health emergency is pretty dangerous, along with the idea of intermediate emergency.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.441
Why is he reading so much?

01:28:49.981 --> 01:28:52.422
So who knows what a potential or intermediate emergency amounts to?

01:28:52.502 --> 01:28:53.343
I mean, what does that actually mean?

01:28:53.883 --> 01:28:54.703
No one knows.

01:28:54.884 --> 01:28:55.424
No one will tell you.

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.705
And then the other thing they talk about is health measures.

01:28:58.845 --> 01:29:00.186
No solutions.

01:29:00.366 --> 01:29:01.607
No solutions.

01:29:01.687 --> 01:29:03.267
The solutions are very simple.

01:29:03.368 --> 01:29:04.388
Call them lies.

01:29:04.528 --> 01:29:07.930
Get out of the vaccine schedule and the UN and the WHO.

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.570
They're not talking about this.

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.031
They're giving you all the details.

01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:16.554
They're making sure you understand how it's going to work so that when you actually get trapped, the hog cage closes.

01:29:16.574 --> 01:29:17.754
You won't be surprised.

01:29:18.255 --> 01:29:18.975
You won't panic.

01:29:21.485 --> 01:29:26.067
how to take us gently into this new future through chaos.

01:29:34.716 --> 01:29:40.058
And that's documents containing information on a laboratory test for pathogen or information on vaccination.

01:29:40.078 --> 01:29:44.760
So they're now validating these WHO digital health certificates, you know, these vaccine passports.

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.221
So, you know, prohibitive testing, you know, this costs people.

01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:52.763
So if you're not vaccinated, you know, you remember twenty one, twenty three, you have to spend so much money on these stupid tests.

01:29:54.204 --> 01:29:57.925
So, you know, and it resulted in twenty one and twenty three.

01:29:57.985 --> 01:29:59.586
What what what is he talking about?

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.282
But the tests are validating these who digital health certificates, you know, these vaccine passports.

01:30:05.982 --> 01:30:08.703
So, you know, prohibitive testing, you know, this costs people.

01:30:08.744 --> 01:30:13.245
So if you're not vaccinated, you know, you remember twenty one, twenty three, you have to spend so much money on these stupid tests.

01:30:14.686 --> 01:30:18.388
So and it resulted in thousands of probably tens of thousands of people vaccinating.

01:30:18.408 --> 01:30:18.888
I mean, that's not true.

01:30:18.908 --> 01:30:19.408
That millions.

01:30:19.628 --> 01:30:20.228
David's wrong there.

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:23.150
Millions of people were vaccinated because they wanted to travel.

01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:25.831
Everybody pretty much who I ask, you know, why did you get the shot?

01:30:26.531 --> 01:30:27.431
I really need to go on holiday.

01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:28.532
I really need to travel for business.

01:30:29.895 --> 01:30:31.076
That's how Malone did it, right?

01:30:31.116 --> 01:30:35.942
He said he had to do it for travel and then he's probably lied about it because, again, why?

01:30:36.022 --> 01:30:40.087
Because Stephen Hadfield said that he didn't have his card when they went to Rome together.

01:30:40.627 --> 01:30:46.514
Seems kind of weird, you know, I mean, if you got the vaccine and you're pissed, which is Robert Malone was pissed because

01:30:47.679 --> 01:30:50.882
Peter Cullis told them that they had figured it out when apparently they hadn't.

01:30:50.962 --> 01:30:54.104
So he took the vaccine because he thought it would help with his long COVID that he had.

01:30:54.525 --> 01:30:55.426
And he had to travel.

01:30:55.786 --> 01:30:58.628
And then he gets all the way to Rome and he forgot his damn card.

01:30:58.668 --> 01:30:59.849
So that was pretty stupid.

01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:02.191
So they'll be able to push all this through.

01:31:02.211 --> 01:31:02.952
You know, you can't travel anymore.

01:31:02.972 --> 01:31:03.733
Oh, you know, you don't have that.

01:31:03.753 --> 01:31:04.793
You're not up to date with your jabs.

01:31:04.813 --> 01:31:06.235
And it won't be like, oh, you had your three jabs.

01:31:06.255 --> 01:31:06.735
You're fine.

01:31:06.855 --> 01:31:08.176
Oh, you haven't had your latest booster.

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:10.138
Last time, you know, you didn't have your 82nd booster.

01:31:11.819 --> 01:31:12.560
When will it stop?

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.222
So this is just me scratching the surface on this IHR and who.

01:31:15.562 --> 01:31:21.066
But what it essentially is, going back to that bigger jigsaw puzzle, is everything is heading towards one world government.

01:31:21.686 --> 01:31:24.628
And in some respects, I feel like we're already there.

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:33.734
If you look, our high streets are all the same, same shops, same malls, same TV programs everywhere, same social media, same apps, same music.

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.616
There's no diversity of culture.

01:31:36.454 --> 01:31:37.474
And I weep for that.

01:31:37.494 --> 01:31:42.476
You know, I want to go to a different country and taste different food, see different shops, buy different things, different clothes.

01:31:42.856 --> 01:31:43.656
But actually everything's the same.

01:31:45.137 --> 01:31:47.617
Everything's homogenous, big business rules everywhere.

01:31:48.578 --> 01:31:50.218
Health care has become super standardized.

01:31:50.298 --> 01:31:53.279
I mean, people think the NHS here in the UK is very different from American health care.

01:31:54.699 --> 01:31:54.939
No.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.301
So he knows apparently that they're the same.

01:31:59.401 --> 01:32:00.321
It's all the same.

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:01.621
It's the same thing.

01:32:02.222 --> 01:32:03.142
And this is a lie.

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.198
Each of our prisons is very different.

01:32:06.238 --> 01:32:14.061
America is very different from the UK, the American healthcare system, the public health system, the military system, parliament versus Congress.

01:32:14.602 --> 01:32:22.905
This is a lie because he doesn't want you to be sophisticated enough to know how easily Americans could pull ourselves out of this.

01:32:22.985 --> 01:32:28.728
If we elected the right people and just did it, it can be hard, but not impossible.

01:32:31.889 --> 01:32:38.152
Because the bottom line is that if we're all motivated and we're all engaged in the system in America, then if they cheat, we'll all know.

01:32:38.572 --> 01:32:39.352
It'll be obvious.

01:32:40.233 --> 01:32:44.594
The problem is now we're not all engaged in the American system and so they can cheat.

01:32:44.634 --> 01:32:47.056
It won't be obvious to us because we didn't lay in line to vote.

01:32:47.556 --> 01:32:49.156
None of us signed up to be an elector.

01:32:49.637 --> 01:32:54.399
None of us signed up to be on the electoral commission so that we could be at a poll.

01:32:55.543 --> 01:32:57.224
And so we're not ready for this election.

01:32:57.264 --> 01:33:01.227
This presidential election is going to go exactly how they want it to.

01:33:01.627 --> 01:33:05.090
And it doesn't matter how many of us register and how many of us show up at the polls.

01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:08.012
The script is already written.

01:33:08.052 --> 01:33:08.832
I'm convinced of it.

01:33:09.493 --> 01:33:18.819
The question is, can we get enough dominoes ahead so that their script will not work the way that they want it to work and that people won't buy into it the way that they want people to buy into it?

01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:26.194
You don't have to know what the script is to get several dominoes ahead of them when they're making mistakes like promoting this clown.

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:28.775
There's managed health care everywhere.

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:32.136
If you look at the uniparty systems, everywhere you go, every country is the same.

01:33:32.457 --> 01:33:32.877
Left, right.

01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:33.757
They're all going to Davos.

01:33:33.817 --> 01:33:34.898
They're all part of the WEF.

01:33:35.418 --> 01:33:36.058
They're all the same.

01:33:36.198 --> 01:33:36.759
Everything's the same.

01:33:37.539 --> 01:33:39.440
And they have the same ideas on climate change.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.481
They have the same idea about transgender issues.

01:33:42.421 --> 01:33:43.282
Same, same, same, same, same.

01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.383
And I almost feel like we're already there.

01:33:45.403 --> 01:33:46.383
We've got this one world government.

01:33:46.803 --> 01:33:49.485
And oh, you know the ultimate test of how you know we're in a one world government?

01:33:49.525 --> 01:33:51.346
So that's the third time that he's saying it.

01:33:51.386 --> 01:33:53.327
You know how we're in the one world government?

01:33:53.347 --> 01:33:55.408
He's telling you that we're in the one world government.

01:33:55.448 --> 01:33:58.930
There's no reason to resist anymore because we're already there.

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:00.590
Where do you run to?

01:34:01.491 --> 01:34:05.813
Where's the place we can all pack up our bags, take our suitcases and run and go.

01:34:05.833 --> 01:34:07.134
We're going there to be free.

01:34:08.343 --> 01:34:11.544
Everyone I speak to goes, oh man, there's nowhere.

01:34:12.045 --> 01:34:13.125
You know, like Mexico.

01:34:13.505 --> 01:34:14.285
Mexico is good.

01:34:14.325 --> 01:34:15.946
Mexico, you know what, it's happening here.

01:34:15.986 --> 01:34:17.707
We're just a few years behind everywhere else.

01:34:18.647 --> 01:34:20.608
Wherever you go, wherever you go, it's the same story.

01:34:21.266 --> 01:34:22.227
There is nowhere to run.

01:34:22.668 --> 01:34:23.288
What does that tell me?

01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:25.010
Tells me we're all ready at that one world government.

01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:28.033
What they just haven't done is declare it.

01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:36.162
You know, like when you open up a new building or a shop, there's an unraveling, there's a grand unraveling, a ceremony, and they open the curtain.

01:34:36.182 --> 01:34:36.843
Cut the ribbon, right?

01:34:37.183 --> 01:34:40.667
Cut the ribbon, open the curtains, and everybody then sees, ah, look at that, the balloons all go up.

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:42.169
They just haven't done that yet.

01:34:43.763 --> 01:34:44.764
Yeah, I think you just nailed it.

01:34:44.864 --> 01:34:46.746
I mean, we are on the same frequency.

01:34:46.846 --> 01:34:50.949
And, you know, even for 10 or 20 years, because I've been traveling the world, I've been obsessed with foreign cultures.

01:34:51.009 --> 01:34:52.771
And I lived in Mongolia.

01:34:52.811 --> 01:34:54.733
And six months, I became intermediate in Mongolian.

01:34:55.013 --> 01:34:57.735
I lived in a yurt, I had my Mongolian, what do you call it garb.

01:34:57.795 --> 01:35:04.921
And I just I started noticing, as just as you said, if you have a one world political system, you have to have a one world economic system.

01:35:05.181 --> 01:35:07.483
And then you have to have a one world culture.

01:35:07.904 --> 01:35:09.906
And as you just described it, and it's it's this model.

01:35:10.546 --> 01:35:10.906
culture.

01:35:12.888 --> 01:35:14.890
By the way, I had David Bell on my TNT show back in 2022.

01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:17.832
He's awesome.

01:35:18.433 --> 01:35:19.714
What is the monoculture?

01:35:19.794 --> 01:35:22.576
Is it Muslims and Islam?

01:35:22.736 --> 01:35:24.678
Or is it Judaism?

01:35:24.858 --> 01:35:26.619
Or is it Catholicism?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.062
Or evangelistic Christian?

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:32.044
What is the monoculture?

01:35:32.224 --> 01:35:32.985
Is it hip-hop?

01:35:34.238 --> 01:35:35.819
Is it Hollywood movies?

01:35:35.919 --> 01:35:45.222
What's the model culture that they're so convinced is already there that we have to just forget about all the other aspects of our culture that are definitely present and still strong?

01:35:46.003 --> 01:35:47.083
What are they talking about?

01:35:49.224 --> 01:35:51.545
They want you to believe in something.

01:35:51.625 --> 01:35:53.565
They're telling you what to believe.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:57.587
They want you to already accept something, even if it's not there.

01:35:58.012 --> 01:36:08.882
do have to ask you, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, and I respect everyone's opinion, but before I ask you this, I want to share this meme I came across the other day, which says, I have never regretted burning any bridges.

01:36:09.062 --> 01:36:11.884
I've only regretted that some people weren't on them while I was doing it.

01:36:11.985 --> 01:36:14.547
And so I don't mind getting people's opinions.

01:36:14.807 --> 01:36:29.397
panties in a bunch so to speak and so um there's this the whole no virus no contagion thing and i just i so i'm allowed to do it but people don't like it when i do it so these guys are going to pretend that they do it now they're going to do the no virus thing i can't wait to hear what kind of uh

01:36:30.273 --> 01:36:32.574
What kind of nuance they're able to roll out here?

01:36:32.594 --> 01:36:34.095
I love what Mark Trosey, who I interviewed, said.

01:36:34.335 --> 01:36:35.916
It's both a germ and terrain theory.

01:36:36.156 --> 01:36:43.600
I was at Anarchapulco recently, and most of the people there were no virus, no contagion, except David Avocado Wolf, who I'm a big fan of and who's got, he's a big person in the old media.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:48.142
He himself said, I'm like, he's 80% terrain and 20% germ because he's a farmer.

01:36:48.182 --> 01:36:51.864
He sees fungus and infectious diseases, and I just can't, I cannot go there.

01:36:51.884 --> 01:36:56.026
I experience in my daily life as a parent, there's constant contagion.

01:36:56.206 --> 01:36:59.807
And from the beginning, I always believed there was no pandemic.

01:36:59.827 --> 01:37:01.348
We can have the same views at the same time.

01:37:01.388 --> 01:37:05.129
There was no pandemic, but infectious disease exists and it's a normal part of life.

01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:06.969
I'm not afraid of getting sick or being around other people.

01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:11.711
What's your take on the crowd that has a different view on this?

01:37:12.461 --> 01:37:13.981
Yeah, so I'm just with you.

01:37:14.001 --> 01:37:15.322
I've said it publicly multiple times.

01:37:15.442 --> 01:37:17.042
I'm 80% terrain, 20% germ.

01:37:17.282 --> 01:37:17.882
Why can't it be both?

01:37:18.162 --> 01:37:19.562
I hate it when people give you binary options.

01:37:19.982 --> 01:37:22.343
You're either with Israel or with Hamas.

01:37:23.123 --> 01:37:23.563
Choose.

01:37:24.163 --> 01:37:24.543
I don't choose.

01:37:24.943 --> 01:37:25.363
Frack you.

01:37:25.663 --> 01:37:26.964
I'm a team of humanity, right?

01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:29.604
I mean, they always do this, whichever it is.

01:37:29.824 --> 01:37:31.124
Are you a virus pusher?

01:37:31.924 --> 01:37:35.025
Or are you saying you're a no virus person?

01:37:35.665 --> 01:37:35.905
Shut up.

01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:36.825
I don't choose either.

01:37:36.845 --> 01:37:37.946
Maybe it's a bit of both.

01:37:38.526 --> 01:37:40.306
Like, you know, I just I hate this kind of stuff.

01:37:40.737 --> 01:37:43.298
I hate this kind of stuff because it means I have to learn something.

01:37:43.338 --> 01:37:45.459
It means I have to like decide on stuff.

01:37:45.499 --> 01:37:50.742
It means like I have to decide who's lying and decide who knows what they're talking about.

01:37:50.762 --> 01:37:56.585
I have to think hard about concepts and, and models of reality and then consider them against each other.

01:37:56.625 --> 01:38:04.289
And maybe even try to think whether one is based on, on conjecture and exaggeration or lies, or I just don't like it.

01:38:04.349 --> 01:38:06.150
I just don't, I don't like any of that stuff.

01:38:06.190 --> 01:38:06.810
That's annoying.

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:07.951
I'm just a podcaster.

01:38:08.511 --> 01:38:11.253
And one thing life has taught me, it ain't black and white.

01:38:12.074 --> 01:38:12.675
Shades of grey.

01:38:13.435 --> 01:38:13.796
And you know what?

01:38:14.076 --> 01:38:14.716
Keep an open mind.

01:38:15.837 --> 01:38:19.520
Today you think this, tomorrow you'll be looking back and going, oh, what a dumb shit I was.

01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:20.661
So just keep an open mind.

01:38:20.681 --> 01:38:22.283
And don't be so cultish about things.

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:22.903
And you know what?

01:38:22.923 --> 01:38:23.864
There's too many goddamn cults around.

01:38:25.405 --> 01:38:26.185
Seriously, too many calls.

01:38:26.365 --> 01:38:30.446
And the thing is, I I've just seen too much with, like you said, with the kids, with my own infections and everything.

01:38:31.367 --> 01:38:32.027
Call it whatever you like.

01:38:32.047 --> 01:38:33.947
There is something out there, some kind of contagion.

01:38:33.967 --> 01:38:39.689
But at the same time, I accept we have bacteria and viruses in our bodies, on our surfaces, in our eyeballs, everywhere.

01:38:40.089 --> 01:38:40.749
We live with them.

01:38:41.069 --> 01:38:43.570
We live in partnership and harmony with them.

01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.890
But how many times.

01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:48.891
He does act like a podcaster with no pertinent medical experience at all.

01:38:49.031 --> 01:38:50.732
It's really it's really remarkable.

01:38:51.616 --> 01:38:57.761
Have I been in someone's knee, or joint, or ankle, with pus pouring out, with bacteria, and we're washing it out, and then give antibiotics?

01:38:58.161 --> 01:38:58.822
Something's happening.

01:38:59.862 --> 01:39:06.948
These no-virus people, or no-contagion people, are you telling me if your knee's hot, and you've got pus pouring out of it, you won't have antibiotics?

01:39:08.444 --> 01:39:11.747
Like, seriously, you've got septicemia, you're not going to have antibiotics?

01:39:12.347 --> 01:39:12.828
Like, you know what?

01:39:12.848 --> 01:39:14.509
Just just be a bit humble.

01:39:14.549 --> 01:39:18.572
You know, if your argument was so powerful, everyone would accept there's no such thing as viruses and bacteria contagion.

01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:19.853
But it's not.

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:20.714
It's a bit complicated.

01:39:20.734 --> 01:39:21.494
We're not 100 percent sure.

01:39:21.835 --> 01:39:23.136
So just just be patient.

01:39:23.156 --> 01:39:28.600
And I find a lot of no virus people get quite aggressive and then they get quite trolling, almost like 77th Brigade attacking you.

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.722
Oh, you are pushing the virus thing.

01:39:31.744 --> 01:39:32.284
I don't know, man.

01:39:32.324 --> 01:39:32.664
I don't know.

01:39:32.684 --> 01:39:35.226
I'm totally like there's legitimate arguments in your side.

01:39:35.246 --> 01:39:35.706
But you know what?

01:39:35.766 --> 01:39:39.488
Equally, my life experience and what I'm seeing and you know, I can't go there yet.

01:39:40.128 --> 01:39:40.728
You know, I just can't.

01:39:40.748 --> 01:39:41.709
I want to keep an open mind.

01:39:42.089 --> 01:39:44.150
I'm 80% towards terrain, but I'm 20% jump.

01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:45.851
He's not working to figure it out.

01:39:45.931 --> 01:39:46.571
That's the point.

01:39:46.631 --> 01:39:48.112
He's never going to try to figure it out.

01:39:48.152 --> 01:39:49.292
He's not going to buy the books.

01:39:49.513 --> 01:39:50.893
He's not going to read the arguments.

01:39:50.953 --> 01:39:57.356
He's not even going to read the the Farewell to Virology document or any of the stuff by Stefan Lanka.

01:39:57.376 --> 01:39:58.417
He's not going to do any of that.

01:39:59.485 --> 01:40:09.654
He's never going to get down into the weeds and say, you know, herpes virus probably exists, but Corona viruses might not, not at least in the way that they say it's it's this, he doesn't want to commit to anything.

01:40:09.674 --> 01:40:16.340
Why do I want to work that hard when you could just podcast, not take any, any stance and make a living doing that?

01:40:17.502 --> 01:40:19.864
Why would you ever want to take a stand on anything?

01:40:22.086 --> 01:40:23.387
I mean, that might be, you know,

01:40:24.298 --> 01:40:26.218
Why would you want to admit that you were wrong?

01:40:26.258 --> 01:40:28.979
They quoted Kipling wrong for cripes sake.

01:40:29.039 --> 01:40:30.199
What's going on here?

01:40:30.219 --> 01:40:32.079
I'm holding on to that right now.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.860
I can tell you right now, in January 2020, I had something.

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.120
I had something.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:41.481
Before I even knew about COVID, before I even saw the people falling down and everything, I was sick as a dog.

01:40:42.341 --> 01:40:43.922
And I've had the flu before a couple of times.

01:40:44.402 --> 01:40:48.542
I've even had to go to the emergency room because I collapsed when I had the flu.

01:40:48.602 --> 01:40:49.022
Don't ask.

01:40:49.063 --> 01:40:49.563
Long story.

01:40:50.183 --> 01:40:51.703
I bumped my head and my wife took me up.

01:40:51.943 --> 01:40:52.764
I called the ambulance, actually.

01:40:52.784 --> 01:40:53.384
I went in the ambulance.

01:40:53.444 --> 01:40:54.505
I was running a massive fever.

01:40:54.725 --> 01:40:55.185
So I've had the flu.

01:40:55.205 --> 01:40:55.986
I know what the flu feels like.

01:40:56.026 --> 01:40:56.706
I've had it a couple of times.

01:40:57.026 --> 01:40:57.827
This was not like the flu.

01:40:58.047 --> 01:41:06.632
This was not like the flu, says Mary Holland, says Meryl Nass, says Robert Malone, says Kevin McCarron, says Ahmed Malik.

01:41:08.533 --> 01:41:09.053
Wow.

01:41:09.614 --> 01:41:11.875
Something strange in the neighborhood.

01:41:11.935 --> 01:41:12.836
This was strange.

01:41:13.116 --> 01:41:14.076
This was weird.

01:41:14.096 --> 01:41:17.418
I was very feverish, very unwell.

01:41:17.979 --> 01:41:18.939
I didn't know you could say that.

01:41:20.725 --> 01:41:23.686
It got a little bit better and then got really sick again, deep in my chest.

01:41:23.706 --> 01:41:24.646
And I got antibiotics.

01:41:24.686 --> 01:41:25.926
And at the time, I didn't know what was going on.

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.187
And that was that second.

01:41:27.327 --> 01:41:28.447
He got antibiotics.

01:41:28.487 --> 01:41:30.928
What would you need antibiotics for if it was a virus?

01:41:31.028 --> 01:41:33.088
I thought if you had covid, it's something else.

01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:34.529
Boy, that was antibiotics.

01:41:34.789 --> 01:41:35.609
Bacterial pneumonia.

01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:38.750
The virus knocks you out and then you get the second bacterial pneumonia.

01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:40.831
And I lost sense of smell for four months.

01:41:41.951 --> 01:41:48.053
And I've never had that, never like maybe a week or so, but not for not like this could taste anything, nothing.

01:41:48.653 --> 01:41:49.413
Something happened to me.

01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:55.851
I guarantee you that people have had this happen in their lives and they were never aware of it because they didn't pay any attention.

01:41:56.391 --> 01:42:00.352
Because the TV hadn't told them that it was a symptom of a dangerous novel virus.

01:42:02.573 --> 01:42:09.056
I guarantee you all these people have had it before in their lifetime, where maybe for a month, their taste buds, their smell was gone.

01:42:09.516 --> 01:42:10.356
And they didn't notice.

01:42:10.436 --> 01:42:11.777
They noticed, but they didn't know.

01:42:11.797 --> 01:42:13.377
Because nobody cares.

01:42:13.497 --> 01:42:15.758
Just like in America, we don't call in sick.

01:42:17.093 --> 01:42:19.234
When we're sick, we go to work when we're sick.

01:42:19.254 --> 01:42:21.496
We call in when we need vacation time.

01:42:21.536 --> 01:42:22.457
We need a day off.

01:42:25.279 --> 01:42:26.319
This guy doesn't know.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.341
This guy's playing a role.

01:42:30.402 --> 01:42:32.624
He's a traitor to the UK and everybody else.

01:42:36.566 --> 01:42:38.788
Most importantly, he's a traitor to his own children.

01:42:40.089 --> 01:42:40.749
Or maybe not.

01:42:40.809 --> 01:42:46.233
Maybe he's earning multi-generational wealth right now as a result of this grift.

01:42:47.332 --> 01:42:49.573
Maybe he's already been paid multi-generational wealth.

01:42:49.613 --> 01:42:50.234
How do I know?

01:42:50.754 --> 01:42:54.776
Maybe he is doing something for his kids, but not something honorable.

01:42:54.996 --> 01:42:55.597
My wife didn't get it.

01:42:56.097 --> 01:42:56.837
My kids didn't get it.

01:42:57.778 --> 01:43:05.442
And that's why I wonder, you know, like JJ Cree talks about these viral clones and Sasha Latapova talks about something else similar to that, exosomes or whatever, where it's synthetic.

01:43:05.562 --> 01:43:09.184
So it's Sasha Latapova and me saying similar things.

01:43:09.944 --> 01:43:11.085
Holy shit.

01:43:13.726 --> 01:43:14.527
Do you see it yet?

01:43:16.792 --> 01:43:18.773
Do you see it yet?

01:43:20.114 --> 01:43:23.555
These clowns really think we're dumb.

01:43:24.876 --> 01:43:37.282
That they can get away with saying shit like this in January or February and no one's going to notice that they're plugging the Geneva thing that's going to happen and everybody's going to show up and they're going to televise it and make it a big deal.

01:43:37.642 --> 01:43:40.283
We're going to record stuff and say stuff in Geneva.

01:43:42.822 --> 01:43:46.766
Sasha Latapova says similar things as Jonathan Cooey.

01:43:46.926 --> 01:43:48.387
Oh boy, is that rich.

01:43:48.787 --> 01:43:54.032
Take maybe, you know, RNA sequences, put in a lipid nanoparticle, aerosols.

01:43:54.092 --> 01:43:54.393
I don't know.

01:43:54.453 --> 01:43:54.753
I don't know.

01:43:55.173 --> 01:43:55.794
I just don't know.

01:43:56.214 --> 01:43:58.636
I had something that made me very sick.

01:43:59.918 --> 01:44:00.658
And who knows what it is?

01:44:00.858 --> 01:44:02.460
Toxin, poison, whatever they're using.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.066
But the problem that I have when you say there's no virus, there's no such thing as virus and contagion.

01:44:10.293 --> 01:44:14.554
You let the people who run the bioweapons labs off the hook.

01:44:15.694 --> 01:44:17.995
And that's a fracking dangerous game to play.

01:44:18.795 --> 01:44:22.256
Because there are bioweapons labs all around the world, many American ones.

01:44:22.796 --> 01:44:25.157
You just need to look at what they did in Iraq, OK?

01:44:25.277 --> 01:44:25.837
The Gulf War.

01:44:26.217 --> 01:44:27.218
They gave anthrax.

01:44:27.598 --> 01:44:31.539
And you tell all these no-virus, no-contagion people, you think anthrax doesn't make you sick?

01:44:32.449 --> 01:44:33.970
Aspergilloma, whatever you call it.

01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.911
You think that doesn't make you sick?

01:44:35.492 --> 01:44:36.473
These toxins within them?

01:44:37.133 --> 01:44:38.214
You don't think these things will make you sick?

01:44:38.234 --> 01:44:39.255
Because I think they will.

01:44:39.275 --> 01:44:40.036
I think they'll kill you.

01:44:40.937 --> 01:44:46.662
So they've experimented and played around with these substances and agents to make them sick.

01:44:46.782 --> 01:44:49.384
And what was Gulf War syndrome all about?

01:44:50.024 --> 01:44:52.747
These drugs, these bioweapons, these vaccines and everything.

01:44:52.787 --> 01:44:57.331
And they made their own army soldiers really sick from all of this stuff.

01:44:57.938 --> 01:44:58.399
And they do.

01:44:58.559 --> 01:44:59.380
All of what stuff?

01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:02.824
The anthrax vaccine that Meryl Ness spoke out against?

01:45:02.844 --> 01:45:04.245
What are you talking about here, Ahmed?

01:45:04.626 --> 01:45:06.268
Be specific for once.

01:45:06.888 --> 01:45:08.290
Tell us something useful.

01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:12.695
Play around with these agents and bacteria and try and make them more dangerous.

01:45:13.536 --> 01:45:15.118
And that is actually happening.

01:45:15.538 --> 01:45:17.800
It's actually happening, and it doesn't work very well.

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:27.028
So shitty for RNA viruses, in fact, that they use something called infectious clones to approximate whatever they imagine happens in the wild.

01:45:27.108 --> 01:45:29.830
I took a whole hour to explain it to you, you jackass.

01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:33.253
Just say, oh, there's no contagion, there's no virus, it's nothing like this.

01:45:33.273 --> 01:45:34.734
It's all in your head.

01:45:35.915 --> 01:45:36.776
Make your terrain better.

01:45:37.416 --> 01:45:38.978
You're letting them off the hook.

01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:41.920
And that makes me almost think, are you playing for the other side?

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.722
Letting them off the hook of what?

01:45:44.833 --> 01:45:51.937
of talking shit about pandemic potential that doesn't exist, about lying about the effectiveness of transfections.

01:45:52.298 --> 01:45:53.899
What are we letting them off the hook on?

01:45:53.999 --> 01:45:54.739
For the leak?

01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:03.244
Do you see how imprecise his language is and how with that imprecision, he effectively does nothing?

01:46:03.805 --> 01:46:10.849
He effectively creates confusion, uncertainty, embedded contradiction.

01:46:12.796 --> 01:46:14.097
He's got no frackin' clue.

01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:16.538
He's got exactly a frackin' clue of what he's doing.

01:46:16.598 --> 01:46:20.821
He's confusing people, making people afraid, and making people go limp.

01:46:21.982 --> 01:46:22.142
Right?

01:46:23.323 --> 01:46:23.823
Right, seriously?

01:46:24.303 --> 01:46:27.846
And either you're just ideologically captured, or you are deliberately controlled.

01:46:27.886 --> 01:46:29.487
You are a controlled agent.

01:46:29.907 --> 01:46:31.468
And you can be controlled indirectly and directly.

01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:40.114
You know, people who are indirectly controlled are ones who believe something truly, but are mistaken in their belief, but are promoted, and their voice is amplified.

01:46:41.069 --> 01:46:46.514
You know, because it suits the powers above that this person is spreading this information because it's false and it's helping them.

01:46:46.934 --> 01:46:48.836
And so, who's he implying that would be?

01:46:48.916 --> 01:46:49.937
Sasha Lantupova?

01:46:50.658 --> 01:46:51.339
Meryl Ness?

01:46:51.699 --> 01:46:52.380
Robert Malone?

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.681
Mary Holland?

01:46:54.181 --> 01:46:55.302
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:46:56.043 --> 01:46:56.804
Pierre Kory?

01:46:58.425 --> 01:46:59.586
Who's he talking about here?

01:47:00.563 --> 01:47:10.075
How much more imprecise could he be so that effectively he's giving you no information at all, except for telling you you're screwed, and that we're already in the New World Order?

01:47:10.116 --> 01:47:11.417
I mean, as far as he's concerned.

01:47:12.479 --> 01:47:14.121
And I get worried about these ideological camps.

01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:16.404
I'd rather people said, I'm not really sure.

01:47:16.424 --> 01:47:17.505
Sounds attractive.

01:47:18.562 --> 01:47:19.122
Is it everything?

01:47:19.263 --> 01:47:19.663
Not sure.

01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:21.404
You know, that's humility.

01:47:21.724 --> 01:47:22.725
That's keeping an open mind.

01:47:22.985 --> 01:47:24.006
That's scientific.

01:47:25.246 --> 01:47:31.631
And then the other side is when you've got people who are saying it's all, you know, gain of function, early treatment.

01:47:31.671 --> 01:47:32.511
I mean, I just don't know.

01:47:33.932 --> 01:47:34.993
Then you're letting them off the hook.

01:47:35.033 --> 01:47:37.834
Then you've got the other people who say there's no virus.

01:47:38.274 --> 01:47:40.415
But there are viruses that exist, but there was no virus in this case.

01:47:40.435 --> 01:47:41.676
It was all just hospital measures.

01:47:42.356 --> 01:47:43.897
And again, I think you're letting them off the hook.

01:47:44.277 --> 01:47:46.078
I think they definitely did something.

01:47:46.458 --> 01:47:47.258
They did something.

01:47:47.278 --> 01:47:48.479
How about they lied?

01:47:49.159 --> 01:47:53.321
Why is it so hard to say they did something?

01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:56.442
And people did get sick.

01:47:56.942 --> 01:47:59.964
And yes, people died because of the hospital protocols and measures.

01:48:00.763 --> 01:48:20.418
People died because of hospital protocols and measures, which is murder when you let somebody starve, when you let somebody dehydrate, when you let somebody die of a urinary tract infection, when you give them secondary pneumonia by giving them high flow nasal oxygen for weeks or days or whatever it was.

01:48:22.321 --> 01:48:23.722
What is going on here?

01:48:23.742 --> 01:48:30.745
In certain places in the world, through some mechanism of dispersal, aerosol, whatever, poisoning, they make people sick.

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:31.805
They use that.

01:48:31.865 --> 01:48:39.488
He is actually reinforcing the fact, this idea that somewhere there are bad guys that make people sick with spray.

01:48:40.769 --> 01:48:45.491
They aerosolized, they did stuff, they did stuff when it could just all be lies.

01:48:47.304 --> 01:48:54.626
It could just be Pierre Kory lying to get people to get into the hospital, then lying about whether or not this high flow nasal oxygen's hurting anybody.

01:48:54.666 --> 01:48:56.226
Is that really progression of COVID?

01:48:56.626 --> 01:48:59.166
Or are you just damaging his lungs with that oxygen?

01:48:59.947 --> 01:49:01.327
And not asking that question.

01:49:01.807 --> 01:49:10.949
This guy, who's worked on lots of people that have been under anesthesia care, is apparently not interested in asking that question about the protocols.

01:49:10.969 --> 01:49:16.330
He's never even said that in my home country, they use midazolam in starving people to kill them.

01:49:18.356 --> 01:49:20.718
Think about how much of a massive fail he is.

01:49:22.258 --> 01:49:22.919
He's a traitor.

01:49:23.839 --> 01:49:25.000
There's no other way to see it.

01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:25.881
This is a traitor.

01:49:25.981 --> 01:49:27.842
He's selling out.

01:49:28.202 --> 01:49:34.126
He's talking over all the murder that happened in Scotland and the UK, everywhere.

01:49:34.146 --> 01:49:38.869
And he's talking over all the murder that happened in the United States.

01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:43.452
People died of the protocols, but that's not murder apparently.

01:49:45.968 --> 01:49:49.151
ramp up the fear and the propaganda, and everyone fell in line.

01:49:49.531 --> 01:49:56.638
And I watched a recent video, including him, right, because he only lost his job when he voluntarily quit last year.

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.321
So he fell in line, too.

01:50:00.381 --> 01:50:05.006
I mean, he didn't drop his job and start podcasting and crusading because people were being murdered.

01:50:05.026 --> 01:50:05.986
And they were lying about it.

01:50:06.046 --> 01:50:06.467
Not at all.

01:50:08.407 --> 01:50:09.187
which I thought was amazing.

01:50:09.487 --> 01:50:10.348
I'll just lay it out to you.

01:50:11.228 --> 01:50:13.208
There is a row of chairs.

01:50:13.649 --> 01:50:14.849
And three people are sitting in the chairs.

01:50:15.089 --> 01:50:15.809
And they're actors.

01:50:16.649 --> 01:50:17.750
And there's a bell that goes, doot.

01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:20.111
And when the bell goes, doot, everybody stands up.

01:50:20.131 --> 01:50:20.931
They've got pieces of paper.

01:50:20.951 --> 01:50:21.611
They're auditioning.

01:50:21.631 --> 01:50:22.251
But they stand up.

01:50:22.691 --> 01:50:24.072
And when it goes, doot, again, they sit down.

01:50:24.432 --> 01:50:25.092
And they're actors.

01:50:25.792 --> 01:50:28.053
Now, one person of the public comes in and sits down.

01:50:29.093 --> 01:50:31.454
And he's not an actor, and he doesn't know that other people are actors.

01:50:31.835 --> 01:50:34.336
And when this noise goes, doot, the other three people get up.

01:50:34.376 --> 01:50:36.057
And he looks at them like, why are they getting up?

01:50:36.297 --> 01:50:38.058
And they're all looking at their sheets.

01:50:38.478 --> 01:50:39.639
And then, doot, and they sit down again.

01:50:40.559 --> 01:50:43.641
When it makes that noise again, doot, this fourth person gets up.

01:50:43.681 --> 01:50:45.642
He goes, oh, I don't want to be sitting there.

01:50:46.102 --> 01:50:46.662
I'll do it as well.

01:50:47.483 --> 01:50:51.125
So when three people decide to lie to you, it's pretty hard to see through it.

01:50:51.985 --> 01:50:56.828
So if Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose

01:51:00.174 --> 01:51:14.468
And Pierre Corey, and Nurse Erin, and Kyle Seidel, and Doc Malek all agree to lie to you to say that it's just impossible for them to figure it out.

01:51:14.528 --> 01:51:15.248
They just don't know.

01:51:15.348 --> 01:51:17.330
So they're just going to be humble and say they don't know.

01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:17.991
They can't know.

01:51:18.031 --> 01:51:19.172
They're not smart enough to know.

01:51:19.212 --> 01:51:23.296
And that's the right thing to do, because then you'll do it too.

01:51:25.273 --> 01:51:30.955
And that will effectively keep you in the hog trap long enough so that when they close the gate, you'll be in it and just so will your kids.

01:51:32.636 --> 01:51:34.516
He's working for them, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:34.656 --> 01:51:36.477
It's clear as day in this podcast.

01:51:36.577 --> 01:51:38.157
There's no saving being done here.

01:51:38.197 --> 01:51:39.658
There's no fighting being done here.

01:51:40.978 --> 01:51:43.539
He's effectively Joe Rogan, UK.

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.460
It's a joke.

01:51:47.679 --> 01:51:48.722
Number 5 person comes in.

01:51:49.363 --> 01:51:51.548
He sees number 4 and 1, 2, 3 doing the same.

01:51:51.608 --> 01:51:52.229
Hoot, stand up.

01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:53.071
Hoot, sit down.

01:51:53.091 --> 01:51:53.653
So he starts doing it.

01:51:53.953 --> 01:51:54.896
No one's told anyone to do that.

01:51:54.936 --> 01:51:55.838
No one's told him to do this.

01:51:56.078 --> 01:51:56.559
But he starts doing it.

01:51:56.579 --> 01:51:57.622
He doesn't know why he's doing it, but he does it.

01:51:58.643 --> 01:52:01.244
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 people come in.

01:52:01.404 --> 01:52:02.445
All the seats are filled up.

01:52:02.845 --> 01:52:03.585
They all stand up.

01:52:03.806 --> 01:52:04.166
No reason.

01:52:04.206 --> 01:52:04.686
No one questions.

01:52:04.726 --> 01:52:05.266
No one laughs.

01:52:05.806 --> 01:52:06.467
No one looks at each other.

01:52:06.507 --> 01:52:07.467
No one says, why am I doing this?

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:08.908
Don't just do it.

01:52:08.928 --> 01:52:10.548
15 people are standing up and down like idiots.

01:52:10.588 --> 01:52:22.834
So now this is the same thing that Robert Malone and some other people, I think, get wrong, like that guy from Belgium, is that they make it seem like all these people are just doing it because they're lemmings.

01:52:24.039 --> 01:52:36.402
but they're not because there are three people that are conspiring against them to lie consistently so that it appears as though there is an illusion of consensus about what's the proper behavior.

01:52:37.302 --> 01:52:40.863
So it's not exactly just people running off a cliff.

01:52:40.983 --> 01:52:46.645
It requires people to run off the cliff in order for the other lemmings to go off the cliff.

01:52:48.004 --> 01:52:50.404
It requires people like him to say, I don't know.

01:52:50.424 --> 01:52:53.425
I don't have any fracking clue after all these years in podcasts.

01:52:53.505 --> 01:52:53.925
I don't know.

01:52:54.445 --> 01:52:55.725
I just know they did something.

01:52:55.785 --> 01:52:58.126
They probably did something like what Sasha and Jay say.

01:52:58.166 --> 01:52:59.086
They sprayed something.

01:53:02.147 --> 01:53:03.787
What a mealy mouth piece of shit.

01:53:03.967 --> 01:53:06.307
I'm sorry, but this is a joke to me.

01:53:06.387 --> 01:53:07.367
This is a traitor.

01:53:07.828 --> 01:53:09.528
You should stop subscribing.

01:53:09.568 --> 01:53:11.928
You should hammer him on Twitter.

01:53:12.408 --> 01:53:14.129
This guy should be discredited.

01:53:14.909 --> 01:53:15.829
It's just wrong.

01:53:17.677 --> 01:53:23.439
Because after all this work and all this podcasting, he has not figured out anything.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.260
He has no opinion on anything.

01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:32.703
And him and this interviewer are encouraging you that that's the best idea, is to just, you know, you can't know.

01:53:33.083 --> 01:53:34.244
There's no reason to know.

01:53:34.284 --> 01:53:35.944
It's so much work to know.

01:53:35.964 --> 01:53:42.627
Holy balls, what a pathetic, pathetic display.

01:53:43.237 --> 01:53:46.178
because a little beep is going boop, stand up, did you stand up?

01:53:46.939 --> 01:53:47.999
A minute later, boop, they sit down.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.081
The three original actors walk out, they get called out and say, you know, go out.

01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:52.662
So they're gone now.

01:53:52.682 --> 01:53:55.063
So the original people who knew were in it are gone.

01:53:55.323 --> 01:53:56.463
The other 12 idiots.

01:53:56.644 --> 01:54:07.369
Oh yeah, so if Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose exit stage left for a year, but this dipshit continues, then we're just fine.

01:54:07.389 --> 01:54:11.611
If Pierre Khoury just continues, then we're fine.

01:54:12.625 --> 01:54:20.852
We can eventually get rid of Sasha Latupova after she's useless and more people find out about her daughter and how she used her daughter when she was a minor.

01:54:22.894 --> 01:54:28.099
Once more people find that out, they can remove Sasha as long as this clown's still being elevated.

01:54:30.661 --> 01:54:32.022
And there are many more like him.

01:54:32.583 --> 01:54:34.064
Shannon Joy is one of them.

01:54:35.966 --> 01:54:38.148
This Irv is one of them.

01:54:39.875 --> 01:54:42.175
And there are different levels and different tiers.

01:54:42.256 --> 01:54:46.076
It wouldn't surprise me if very soon Brett Weinstein's on both of these podcasts.

01:54:48.377 --> 01:54:50.357
You don't know why they're standing or sitting.

01:54:50.757 --> 01:54:51.477
Carry on.

01:54:51.597 --> 01:54:51.878
Stand up.

01:54:52.758 --> 01:54:53.038
Sit down.

01:54:53.058 --> 01:54:57.739
Do you understand how easily it is to manipulate human beings?

01:54:58.499 --> 01:55:00.659
Get them to do shit that they don't even understand.

01:55:01.079 --> 01:55:05.000
Oh, but they would never have done all of this to make an illusion of a pandemic.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.201
They did something because I got sick.

01:55:07.261 --> 01:55:08.201
It was strange.

01:55:13.279 --> 01:55:13.880
Just accept it.

01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:18.062
And what happens is that there was one person who didn't get up.

01:55:19.664 --> 01:55:22.345
And instead of saying, yeah, I don't know why I'm doing this.

01:55:22.365 --> 01:55:23.886
Yeah, I'm going to sit down as well.

01:55:25.067 --> 01:55:27.609
They all look to her and turn to her like, why are you not getting up?

01:55:28.369 --> 01:55:28.870
I'm doing this.

01:55:29.590 --> 01:55:30.271
Why are you not doing this?

01:55:30.831 --> 01:55:31.391
What's wrong with you?

01:55:32.772 --> 01:55:36.955
So everyone gets vaccinated and the ones who don't get vaccinated, how dare you?

01:55:38.096 --> 01:55:39.137
Why are you not getting vaccinated?

01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:40.801
Did you not hear the toot?

01:55:40.821 --> 01:55:42.061
We need to get vaccinated now.

01:55:42.842 --> 01:55:43.863
Toot, we need to get booster now.

01:55:44.183 --> 01:55:46.244
Oh yeah, but isn't the toot on TV?

01:55:46.324 --> 01:55:53.870
Wasn't there a bunch of toots on TV in the UK beeping on the TV about what we needed to do to build back better?

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:55.371
Is he not going to explain that?

01:55:56.091 --> 01:55:58.773
Or is it just stupid people doing what they're told?

01:56:00.814 --> 01:56:04.817
You see, it's not that we were lied to.

01:56:04.877 --> 01:56:07.159
It's not that we're governed by mythology.

01:56:08.191 --> 01:56:09.311
It's that people are dumb.

01:56:09.351 --> 01:56:10.091
They're gullible.

01:56:10.131 --> 01:56:11.532
They're easily manipulated.

01:56:12.652 --> 01:56:13.512
So it's our fault.

01:56:14.553 --> 01:56:15.053
Why are you not doing it?

01:56:15.613 --> 01:56:16.193
There's no thinking.

01:56:16.773 --> 01:56:19.034
There is no critical thinking going on.

01:56:19.514 --> 01:56:20.674
Human beings have just been programmed.

01:56:20.694 --> 01:56:24.295
So what's his excuse for not critically thinking for the first three years?

01:56:24.355 --> 01:56:27.256
Or he did, but he didn't have the principles to do anything about it.

01:56:27.336 --> 01:56:27.976
Is that what it was?

01:56:28.016 --> 01:56:28.536
Programmed.

01:56:29.436 --> 01:56:32.077
Or maybe nobody approached him and said, hey, we could build a little

01:56:32.657 --> 01:56:45.009
a little studio in your backyard so that you could have a podcast and then we'll be sure that your podcast gets elevated and you'll be fine as long as you don't talk about or question the novel virus and you don't question that millions of people were killed from it.

01:56:45.069 --> 01:56:48.933
You just kind of, you know, remain agnostic about these things.

01:56:48.973 --> 01:56:50.815
We'll promote you to high heaven.

01:56:51.355 --> 01:56:53.017
We'll get you all those guests you need.

01:56:53.237 --> 01:56:54.298
We're easily manipulated.

01:56:54.619 --> 01:56:55.520
We're herd animals.

01:56:56.021 --> 01:57:01.889
We're weak now to the greatest extent, I believe, in our history.

01:57:02.389 --> 01:57:03.691
We're weak and pathetic.

01:57:04.652 --> 01:57:07.877
And that's why these people are doing what they're doing to us.

01:57:08.905 --> 01:57:09.185
My friend.

01:57:09.665 --> 01:57:09.865
Yeah.

01:57:09.965 --> 01:57:19.890
And, and, you know, we covered a lot of the topics that I'm most interested in and, you know, something else that you touched on, you know, again, one of my biggest fears is you mentioned like the, the health passes, the Nazi health passes during COVID.

01:57:19.930 --> 01:57:25.372
I bought, it's right behind me, uh, uh, actual Aachen and pass from 1930s Nazi Germany, which was to prove here.

01:57:25.572 --> 01:57:29.175
To prove, I got it from an Italian antique dealer on eBay for 10 bucks.

01:57:29.636 --> 01:57:31.277
And I bought one for each of my family members.

01:57:32.218 --> 01:57:36.182
Because if I was forced again to show my COVID papers, I would whip out my Nazi Aachman pass.

01:57:36.743 --> 01:57:41.587
And I learned later that there's a second one called the Gesundheit pass, the actual Nazi health pass.

01:57:42.648 --> 01:57:50.794
And so my fear is what they're pushing towards is this, the CBDC's cashless system with digital IDs and digital passports where they're really going to control.

01:57:51.354 --> 01:57:57.539
If they decide, if the system decides they hit a button and you literally can't buy food, no one's going to help you because if they help you, the same thing's going to happen to them.

01:57:57.939 --> 01:58:02.242
And that's kind of my biggest fear down the line is we're going to end up in this type of.

01:58:02.302 --> 01:58:05.024
So they didn't hear that from Mike Eden for the last four years.

01:58:05.205 --> 01:58:05.425
I mean.

01:58:06.909 --> 01:58:11.371
Doc Malik put Mike Eden's podcast behind a paywall because you know, his family needs money.

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:18.916
So I'm sure that Doc heard it, but maybe he doesn't want to give it away because it's behind the paywall system.

01:58:18.956 --> 01:58:20.536
And so you know, any further thoughts on that?

01:58:20.737 --> 01:58:22.197
How do you think that might play out what we can do?

01:58:23.058 --> 01:58:25.919
And then other things that you're sort of thinking about?

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:26.980
Yeah.

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.281
What do you think?

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:28.701
Unfortunately,

01:58:33.635 --> 01:58:37.900
I'm really just disappointed in a lot of people in the world today.

01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:39.241
I hate this.

01:58:40.022 --> 01:58:40.563
I really am.

01:58:41.484 --> 01:58:46.990
I think, you know, 10-15% of the population are really switched on and get it.

01:58:49.133 --> 01:58:50.554
But the majority really don't.

01:58:51.415 --> 01:58:52.837
They know something's not right.

01:58:54.150 --> 01:58:54.831
But they don't know what.

01:58:55.732 --> 01:58:57.013
And that goes back to the diagnosis.

01:58:57.654 --> 01:58:59.176
If you don't know what the problem is, how can you fix it?

01:59:00.037 --> 01:59:01.879
And some of them aren't even aware there is a problem.

01:59:02.319 --> 01:59:05.002
They have a little sense something's not right.

01:59:05.343 --> 01:59:08.126
But they've not quite got to the point where they think they need to go see a doctor.

01:59:08.967 --> 01:59:10.448
They just think, something's not right.

01:59:11.449 --> 01:59:13.351
But maybe I'll just leave it and I'll be better tomorrow.

01:59:13.932 --> 01:59:14.653
Some patients are like that.

01:59:15.675 --> 01:59:19.119
And I say it to these patients, you know, who come a year or two years later.

01:59:19.139 --> 01:59:23.062
And by that point, their foot's pointing 90 degrees the wrong angle.

01:59:24.203 --> 01:59:26.546
And the deformity is so severe, it's got problems in their knees.

01:59:26.586 --> 01:59:28.187
And their knees now have got a serious problem.

01:59:28.728 --> 01:59:30.129
And their hip and back are off.

01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:32.111
I go, why did you leave it so late?

01:59:32.592 --> 01:59:35.935
Because you left it so late, because there's deformity and it's irreversible.

01:59:36.555 --> 01:59:38.717
You've now got knock on complications elsewhere.

01:59:38.737 --> 01:59:44.923
And so not only will the problem be harder to fix, it will take longer to fix and it will not be as good as before.

01:59:45.424 --> 01:59:46.985
And the complications and risks are higher.

01:59:47.265 --> 01:59:48.226
And they go, oh, really?

01:59:48.246 --> 01:59:50.509
I'm like, did you not realise something was wrong?

01:59:50.529 --> 01:59:52.290
And they went, do you know what?

01:59:52.530 --> 01:59:53.692
I knew something was not right.

01:59:54.232 --> 01:59:55.133
I was kidding myself.

01:59:57.452 --> 01:59:58.734
And I think that's what people are doing now.

01:59:59.374 --> 02:00:01.477
I think a lot of people are kidding themselves.

02:00:02.198 --> 02:00:03.980
They're kidding themselves that, you know what?

02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.121
Tomorrow is going to be a better day.

02:00:06.142 --> 02:00:06.983
Tomorrow will be easier.

02:00:07.644 --> 02:00:09.106
That the problem will somehow be fixed.

02:00:09.687 --> 02:00:11.429
Someone's going to sort it out and make sense.

02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:13.091
And those people

02:00:14.585 --> 02:00:15.306
Yeah, they're in trouble.

02:00:16.046 --> 02:00:17.747
So I think things are going to get worse.

02:00:18.588 --> 02:00:22.211
I think this year, I don't know why, my spidey sense is telling me this year is going to be a bad year.

02:00:22.671 --> 02:00:26.053
It's going to make 2020 look like one of the starters.

02:00:26.494 --> 02:00:27.735
This is this is going to be a big one.

02:00:28.235 --> 02:00:28.975
Something's going to happen.

02:00:30.517 --> 02:00:30.977
It could be anything.

02:00:31.417 --> 02:00:31.998
Could be all of them.

02:00:32.098 --> 02:00:33.058
Could be another pandemic.

02:00:33.719 --> 02:00:36.301
Could be a hot war, proper big hot war affecting the West.

02:00:36.881 --> 02:00:38.602
It could be a massive financial crash.

02:00:39.588 --> 02:00:45.051
And that could be as a result of anything, because anything can the Tinder box, anything can light it.

02:00:46.052 --> 02:00:50.174
Another scandal, another bank crashing, another financial thing that we just don't even know about around the corner.

02:00:50.655 --> 02:00:55.218
It could be, oh, they hacked our electronic system and the Internet and we lost outage.

02:00:55.238 --> 02:00:59.000
Can you imagine what the world would be like if for two weeks there's no electricity and no Internet?

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.602
The chaos, the looting, the riots.

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:05.524
What would the world do without Malik's podcast for two weeks?

02:01:05.604 --> 02:01:06.544
I mean, man, oh, man.

02:01:06.805 --> 02:01:08.686
And then the lights are back on.

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.160
So I'll give an example.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.440
If this happens, right?

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.441
So all the people are watching.

02:01:15.181 --> 02:01:15.681
I disappear.

02:01:16.342 --> 02:01:16.782
What's happening?

02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:17.942
I'm back.

02:01:18.322 --> 02:01:18.682
It's all right.

02:01:19.602 --> 02:01:20.182
Now we're back.

02:01:20.943 --> 02:01:22.283
And we've realized who the baddies were.

02:01:22.743 --> 02:01:26.644
Those pesky Iranians, those North Koreans, those Donetskans.

02:01:27.104 --> 02:01:28.344
Are there even such a thing as Donetskans?

02:01:28.684 --> 02:01:35.906
But anyway, and now to protect us from this ever happening again, we're going to introduce digital currency.

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:38.304
We're going to introduce a social credit system.

02:01:38.704 --> 02:01:44.587
No, you're going to introduce digital ID on the internet, just like Twitter is already trying to do it.

02:01:45.548 --> 02:01:48.550
So again, this is not a very precise understanding.

02:01:48.610 --> 02:01:51.411
It's not a very nuanced understanding.

02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:52.052
It's nothing.

02:01:53.012 --> 02:01:54.153
It's worthless air.

02:01:55.374 --> 02:02:00.617
And it's somebody who's really masquerading as an already proven card carrying hero.

02:02:03.518 --> 02:02:04.379
It's really pathetic.

02:02:06.141 --> 02:02:06.842
And it's gonna be so much better.

02:02:07.262 --> 02:02:15.848
And again, the majority of people being the sheeple that they are, will actually beg for it.

02:02:16.849 --> 02:02:18.810
They will embrace it and welcome it.

02:02:19.671 --> 02:02:20.291
The sheeple.

02:02:20.351 --> 02:02:22.113
See, I don't call people the sheeple.

02:02:22.313 --> 02:02:27.957
I do say that they're skillfully watching television and skillfully using social media, and that makes them vulnerable.

02:02:30.046 --> 02:02:39.674
But sheeple's insulting because it makes it seem like that the people are dumb and that's why the farmer takes advantage of them because they can.

02:02:41.396 --> 02:02:53.126
As opposed to what it really is, which is people over a couple generations have been dumbed down and poisoned, confused that they've inherited this power over them.

02:02:53.786 --> 02:02:56.429
These charlatans they inherited from their parents.

02:02:57.691 --> 02:03:07.760
who all agree for their entire lifetime to lie to them about their basic biology in order to perpetuate this idea of biosecurity state being relevant.

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:14.447
And he's never going to be able to explain that to anyone because he's got no fracking idea.

02:03:15.236 --> 02:03:27.905
Because, again, the evil people have done a wonderful job of getting the majority of us to enslave ourselves, to build our own prisons, whether they be physical or, more importantly, in the mind.

02:03:28.885 --> 02:03:36.090
And I think there is a World War III right now already, and it's a war on the mind, this constant, relentless war.

02:03:37.648 --> 02:03:38.148
There it is.

02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:40.390
It's a war on the mind.

02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:43.092
And he's got no fracking idea what's going on.

02:03:43.172 --> 02:03:47.294
Just like Jordan Peterson, the psychologist, has no idea what to do.

02:03:47.334 --> 02:03:48.575
We're all in a disarray.

02:03:48.595 --> 02:03:52.778
We're being attacked from a spiritual point of view.

02:03:53.218 --> 02:03:54.419
We're being attacked from our health.

02:03:54.939 --> 02:03:58.302
You just need to look at the food, the land, the way they're raping it.

02:03:58.422 --> 02:04:00.943
Is it the same in the UK as it is in America?

02:04:02.144 --> 02:04:04.225
Are we all in the same boat together?

02:04:04.966 --> 02:04:06.307
Stop lying!

02:04:07.591 --> 02:04:10.532
depleting it with the nutrients, feeding us as toxic garbage.

02:04:11.072 --> 02:04:15.333
We're never been so sick and unhealthy and obese and infertile as a species.

02:04:16.014 --> 02:04:22.776
I mean, honestly, go down to the average beach and you'll just see these fat pregnant men with beach ball stomachs.

02:04:23.736 --> 02:04:25.096
And it's apparently a dad bod.

02:04:25.817 --> 02:04:26.557
We're disgusting.

02:04:27.057 --> 02:04:28.758
You know, we're the lean healthy.

02:04:28.818 --> 02:04:30.278
We're disgusting.

02:04:30.498 --> 02:04:31.758
We're pathetic.

02:04:32.179 --> 02:04:33.139
We're sheep.

02:04:36.343 --> 02:04:37.225
This is the message.

02:04:38.168 --> 02:04:39.170
He's not saving us.

02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:40.393
He's not saving our kids.

02:04:40.433 --> 02:04:44.423
He doesn't want to turn our kids back into critically thinking primates.

02:04:47.182 --> 02:04:49.083
I'm not sure how much longer I should really listen.

02:04:49.583 --> 02:04:51.144
It is 20 more minutes, I guess.

02:04:51.384 --> 02:04:54.705
The athletic human beings now, we're only a dad bod.

02:04:55.425 --> 02:04:56.166
We're disgusting.

02:04:56.666 --> 02:04:59.867
You know, we're the lean, healthy, athletic human beings now.

02:05:00.587 --> 02:05:01.408
We're all flabby.

02:05:01.908 --> 02:05:05.649
And no wonder we're non-binary, because have you noticed a fat man looks just like a fat woman?

02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:06.790
They all got boobies.

02:05:07.210 --> 02:05:08.130
The women have got beards.

02:05:08.731 --> 02:05:10.652
You know, men are just jiggling around a bit.

02:05:10.672 --> 02:05:12.332
You know, it's just we've just lost the plot.

02:05:12.612 --> 02:05:15.694
So there's a war on multiple fronts, but most importantly, on our mind.

02:05:17.014 --> 02:05:25.380
And the action of that is that we worship and embrace our captors and the ones who imprison us and the ones who torture us.

02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:27.661
It's the ultimate Stockholm Syndrome buster.

02:05:28.382 --> 02:05:31.404
We are living in a global Stockholm Syndrome.

02:05:32.064 --> 02:05:40.910
And the few people like you and me who call out this Stockholm Global Syndrome and go, oh, shit, guys, it's the invasion of the body snatchers.

02:05:41.191 --> 02:05:42.351
We need to fracking do something.

02:05:43.092 --> 02:05:46.014
Everyone turns around and goes, destroy them.

02:05:46.894 --> 02:05:47.614
We're the crazies.

02:05:47.974 --> 02:05:48.934
We're the conspiracy theorists.

02:05:49.414 --> 02:05:50.135
We're the nutjobs.

02:05:50.735 --> 02:05:52.835
See, he's a card-carrying hero now.

02:05:52.915 --> 02:05:55.676
He's part of the dissident movement.

02:05:55.696 --> 02:05:58.636
He's a card-carrying leader of the dissident movement now.

02:05:59.456 --> 02:06:02.877
And in essence, the truth is, we're the ones who are awake.

02:06:03.717 --> 02:06:06.218
We are the ones who truly value freedom and liberty.

02:06:06.618 --> 02:06:07.938
We are the ones who love humanity.

02:06:08.578 --> 02:06:09.598
And we want to save everyone.

02:06:10.138 --> 02:06:13.179
How are you going to save them if you have no fracking idea what's happening?

02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:18.602
How can he save our children if he has no frackin' idea what's happening?

02:06:19.002 --> 02:06:21.404
He has no frackin' clue what they're lying about.

02:06:21.444 --> 02:06:23.405
He can't even use the word lie.

02:06:23.425 --> 02:06:29.408
How's he gonna save us from people who are willing to coordinate their lying?

02:06:31.049 --> 02:06:37.953
How can he save us from people that are willing to coordinate their lying across non-governmental organizations over decades?

02:06:38.988 --> 02:06:43.910
How's he gonna save us if he doesn't wanna learn the history of these ideas?

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:48.311
If he doesn't wanna learn the nuances of these ideas and how they're presented and not.

02:06:48.871 --> 02:06:56.654
What is going on here other than a trader pretending to be a card carrying hero when in fact he is an absolute fraud?

02:06:57.354 --> 02:06:58.915
I don't know, I think this is a fraud.

02:06:59.675 --> 02:07:04.817
And going back to another analogy, the problem is you look at all these sheep that we've got in the world today,

02:07:05.987 --> 02:07:07.588
It's all disgusting sheep.

02:07:07.628 --> 02:07:09.569
You're yucky, disgusting losers.

02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:10.770
Stupid.

02:07:11.531 --> 02:07:15.554
You and me and all the other kind of freedom fighters and freedom thinkers, we are the sheepdogs.

02:07:16.354 --> 02:07:18.255
We don't eat sheep, but we protect them.

02:07:18.315 --> 02:07:18.816
We herd them.

02:07:19.216 --> 02:07:19.796
We look after them.

02:07:20.277 --> 02:07:21.698
We keep the big bad wolf away.

02:07:21.918 --> 02:07:23.439
He is a sheepdog.

02:07:24.099 --> 02:07:25.160
Can you believe this?

02:07:26.601 --> 02:07:29.123
This guy's claiming the title sheepdog.

02:07:32.088 --> 02:07:33.029
Holy shit.

02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:36.772
The problem is, the sheep look at us and are scared of us.

02:07:37.492 --> 02:07:41.436
And instead, the wolf in sheep's clothing, they think is one of them.

02:07:42.236 --> 02:07:44.078
And they go to the wolf for protection.

02:07:44.098 --> 02:07:46.340
Do you see how crazy it is?

02:07:47.501 --> 02:07:48.241
This is what's happening.

02:07:48.842 --> 02:07:55.187
The evil ones have done such a good job of giving themselves this veneer of being a sheep, when actually they are the wolf.

02:07:56.248 --> 02:07:57.809
This is the problem, my friend.

02:07:58.468 --> 02:08:00.349
I think you've laid it out perfectly.

02:08:00.569 --> 02:08:08.173
And even sometimes, and I'm sure some listeners now, this is kind of a therapy as well for us airing this stuff out, like it shows, okay, I'm not crazy.

02:08:08.233 --> 02:08:09.513
There's other people thinking like me.

02:08:10.073 --> 02:08:11.334
Oh, my gosh.

02:08:11.414 --> 02:08:12.374
Are you kidding me?

02:08:12.434 --> 02:08:14.035
This podcast could be from 2020.

02:08:14.936 --> 02:08:15.756
It's a joke.

02:08:16.536 --> 02:08:17.817
It's a crying joke.

02:08:19.122 --> 02:08:20.703
No progress has been made.

02:08:21.464 --> 02:08:27.609
These two guys are blowing sunshine up each other's buttholes like they're both the greatest ever.

02:08:28.349 --> 02:08:39.478
Their podcasts are the greatest ever and they can't stop patting each other on the back for how great their humility is for being able to admit that they don't know fracking shit.

02:08:42.432 --> 02:08:45.254
Holy pathetic bullshit.

02:08:45.274 --> 02:08:52.337
It is a form of therapy and what, you know, further on up the road, it's like, what now?

02:08:52.497 --> 02:08:55.219
You know, I'm always thinking, I like how you said freedom thinker.

02:08:55.259 --> 02:08:57.960
Sometimes I'm not sure if I want to call myself freedom fighter, but freedom thinker.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:08:58.661
Thinker?

02:08:58.701 --> 02:08:59.681
What are you thinking about?

02:08:59.721 --> 02:09:01.262
You don't have any fracking clue.

02:09:01.282 --> 02:09:02.603
You have no answers.

02:09:02.643 --> 02:09:04.704
You have no hypotheses, nothing.

02:09:05.384 --> 02:09:06.565
What are you thinking about?

02:09:08.525 --> 02:09:13.528
We talk about this stuff, we warn people, let's push back, don't comply, I'm not wearing a mask, all this sort of stuff.

02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:15.830
But I'm also thinking, I gotta start preparing.

02:09:16.771 --> 02:09:20.814
Like you laid out, I'm cyanide-filled, like my past guest, Illegal Man, calls it.

02:09:21.294 --> 02:09:23.175
I think we're headed into this dystopia.

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:27.639
I just wanna make preparations to be able to survive going through the fire.

02:09:27.659 --> 02:09:29.740
And many of our forefathers, every generation.

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.601
Yeah, you gotta survive.

02:09:31.221 --> 02:09:34.184
I'm just collecting Bitcoin from the people who tell me what to say.

02:09:34.804 --> 02:09:36.665
Because I hope that gets me to survive.

02:09:37.225 --> 02:09:39.106
That's all I'm doing is just trying to survive.

02:09:39.166 --> 02:09:42.487
Get enough for my kids, because I know they're going to run this ship into the ground.

02:09:43.227 --> 02:09:53.992
I can see that they're going to crash the airplane, so I'm just trying to position myself next to the right, you know, exit row, or I'm just trying to get myself, you know, where I need to be.

02:09:55.373 --> 02:09:56.935
No, everybody else isn't paying attention.

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:59.357
All these sheep around, they might as well get where I need to be.

02:09:59.437 --> 02:10:01.679
I've talked to Robin Martinati on the program early on.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:18.497
Robin Martinati is the guy who kept Mike Eden captured on Telegram for a very long time until finally Mike Eden started his own Telegram because he realized that that asshole was actually delaying and misconstruing the things that he said.

02:10:20.029 --> 02:10:33.201
That guy's on my list because he blocked me after he tried to make fun of my clones theory and then tried to say that CGMP was cyclic GMP in this document when it was not.

02:10:33.221 --> 02:10:35.923
It was about general manufacturing processes.

02:10:35.963 --> 02:10:38.906
He made himself look like a jackass and then he blocked me.

02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:42.832
And he has been meddling with Mike Eden for three years.

02:10:42.872 --> 02:10:44.613
And then who does this dipshit mention?

02:10:45.273 --> 02:10:46.394
Robin Martinati.

02:10:46.734 --> 02:10:50.757
Like you laid out, I'm cyanide-filled, like my past guest, Illegal Man, calls it.

02:10:51.217 --> 02:10:53.098
I think we're headed into this dystopia.

02:10:53.178 --> 02:10:57.501
I just want to make preparations to be able to survive going through the fire.

02:10:57.961 --> 02:11:01.643
And, you know, many of our forefathers, every generation, I've talked to Robin Monotti on the program early on.

02:11:03.141 --> 02:11:08.323
I think 2021, and he was talking about Humberto Eco or fascism, eternal fascism, where every generation has to deal with this.

02:11:08.343 --> 02:11:09.163
And I thought about it.

02:11:09.503 --> 02:11:13.444
When I was a kid, we lived through the breakup of Yugoslavia.

02:11:13.465 --> 02:11:14.005
My uncle fought.

02:11:14.025 --> 02:11:14.545
He's still alive.

02:11:14.585 --> 02:11:17.786
He fought the Serbs who were coming into Croatia.

02:11:18.026 --> 02:11:20.307
My grandfather was a prisoner of the Croatian Nazi regime.

02:11:20.607 --> 02:11:22.427
My great-grandfather died as a result of World War I.

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:27.862
you know, what are you thinking about on the way forward?

02:11:28.282 --> 02:11:28.603
What now?

02:11:29.083 --> 02:11:30.063
Yeah, it's really interesting.

02:11:30.104 --> 02:11:31.204
So can't wait.

02:11:31.404 --> 02:11:33.966
On Monday, I did a podcast with a guy called Tim Leach.

02:11:34.606 --> 02:11:35.267
And he's a prepper.

02:11:36.127 --> 02:11:37.348
And he preps.

02:11:38.189 --> 02:11:41.250
And basically, the title of the podcast is going to come out in the next couple of weeks.

02:11:41.311 --> 02:11:43.572
It's going to be how to prepare for the zombie apocalypse.

02:11:45.774 --> 02:11:50.039
And, um, and we need to, we need to, and you know, I think there's two elements to this.

02:11:50.139 --> 02:11:56.025
One is in the acute phase, like for example, this year, whatever shit they throw at us, no matter how uncomfortable it gets,

02:11:57.082 --> 02:11:57.702
Don't lose your shit.

02:11:58.743 --> 02:11:59.163
Calm down.

02:11:59.463 --> 02:11:59.823
Relax.

02:12:00.304 --> 02:12:01.344
The world is not going to come to an end.

02:12:02.025 --> 02:12:03.786
It'll only come to an end if you think it's going to come to an end.

02:12:04.066 --> 02:12:04.766
And you make it happen.

02:12:05.026 --> 02:12:05.586
Don't make it happen.

02:12:06.087 --> 02:12:06.947
Let everyone lose their heads.

02:12:07.247 --> 02:12:15.532
Going back to Rudyard Kipling, he goes, if all those around you are losing their heads, but you, my son, maintain yours or keep yours or whatever it is, then you're a man.

02:12:16.152 --> 02:12:16.792
And that's what I would say.

02:12:17.233 --> 02:12:20.494
And when everyone else, running around like a headless chicken, keep your shit together.

02:12:21.215 --> 02:12:23.876
And look at the sky, look at the sun, listen to the birds.

02:12:24.396 --> 02:12:25.177
Everything's going to be just fine.

02:12:26.578 --> 02:12:28.180
Everything's going to be just fine.

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.441
So don't lose your shit.

02:12:29.801 --> 02:12:32.704
But in the short term, like, just be prepared, you know, that something might happen.

02:12:33.185 --> 02:12:43.475
Make sure you know, tell your family, your wife, prepare yourself, have water, have some food, keep a baseball bat, and all the other stuff that my guest talks about in the podcast.

02:12:44.434 --> 02:12:49.279
But then the other thing is in the long term, because I think, you know, shit is going to go down and it's not gonna be good.

02:12:49.899 --> 02:12:53.423
You know, if you speak to people who lived in the communist countries, they go, we didn't protest.

02:12:53.603 --> 02:12:55.605
We didn't go on marches against the state.

02:12:55.925 --> 02:12:56.445
Are you kidding me?

02:12:56.726 --> 02:13:00.569
That's like, send that chap to Gulag, you know, Siberia.

02:13:00.809 --> 02:13:01.490
Why would you do that?

02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:07.115
You know, you just, you just, you went underground and you created parallel structures and you bypassed the state.

02:13:08.136 --> 02:13:09.658
So take, for example,

02:13:11.297 --> 02:13:17.193
If your children are being schooled and indoctrinated, consider taking them out of school and homeschooling them.

02:13:18.191 --> 02:13:19.152
Many people can't afford to do that.

02:13:19.812 --> 02:13:21.734
So let's go back because he's a dipshit.

02:13:21.754 --> 02:13:22.054
I get that.

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:22.975
And I'm tired of him.

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:26.197
But that doesn't mean you still can't hold him, Sam.

02:13:26.237 --> 02:13:27.899
We didn't go on marches against the state.

02:13:28.219 --> 02:13:28.679
Are you kidding me?

02:13:28.699 --> 02:13:29.380
I'm going to be good.

02:13:30.121 --> 02:13:31.201
My guest talks flat in the podcast.

02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:36.966
But then the other thing is in the long term, because I think, you know, shit is going to go down and it's not going to be good.

02:13:37.607 --> 02:13:41.930
You know, if you speak to people who lived in the communist countries, they go, we've done whatever it is.

02:13:42.370 --> 02:13:42.911
And you're a man.

02:13:43.564 --> 02:13:50.146
And that's why those around you are losing their heads, but you, my son, maintain yours or keep yours, whatever it is, and you're a man.

02:13:54.887 --> 02:13:56.508
I mean, think about how pathetic that is.

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:57.088
Okay.

02:13:57.148 --> 02:14:02.349
Just think about how pathetic that is for just one second, please, because it's driving me bananas.

02:14:03.690 --> 02:14:04.670
Why is that not working?

02:14:14.332 --> 02:14:15.132
What's he quoting?

02:14:17.233 --> 02:14:30.300
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.

02:14:31.361 --> 02:14:33.201
And it goes on and on and on.

02:14:33.622 --> 02:14:36.103
It's definitely not what Dipshit said.

02:14:37.796 --> 02:14:42.657
I'm sorry I'm using these derogatory terms, I'm sorry I'm being so mean, but this is a traitor.

02:14:42.697 --> 02:14:53.139
This is somebody who is pretending to be a card-carrying hero, pretended to try and help my family just like other people have, and he's actually a meddler.

02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:02.621
He's actually a meddler who put Mike Yeadon's podcast behind a paywall, put mine behind a paywall,

02:15:03.837 --> 02:15:15.407
has interviewed Sasha Latupova a couple times, has said on this podcast that Sasha Latupova and myself have very similar ideas, even though he's got no fracking idea what's going on, according to him.

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.591
And that's what I would say.

02:15:20.611 --> 02:15:28.998
You know, when everyone else running around like a headless chicken, keep your shit together and look at the sky, look at the sun, listen to the birds, you know, everything's gonna be just fine.

02:15:29.773 --> 02:15:30.774
Don't don't do anything.

02:15:31.274 --> 02:15:32.114
Don't do anything.

02:15:32.215 --> 02:15:36.277
You know, don't don't step out of your job and speak out until somebody asks you to do it.

02:15:36.457 --> 02:15:47.944
Somebody builds you a townhouse in a studio in your garden, then then it's okay to finally speak out when you're when you're ready to quit voluntarily because you've got another guaranteed gig in your backyard.

02:15:47.964 --> 02:15:49.104
And then why not?

02:15:49.265 --> 02:15:49.725
Why not?

02:15:50.025 --> 02:15:55.028
You know, voluntarily give up on a give up on a career to start another one.

02:15:55.287 --> 02:15:56.148
be just fine.

02:15:56.668 --> 02:15:57.388
So don't lose your ship.

02:15:57.689 --> 02:15:58.509
Don't lose your ship.

02:15:58.529 --> 02:15:59.510
Like just be prepared.

02:15:59.570 --> 02:16:00.691
You know that something might happen.

02:16:01.151 --> 02:16:11.437
Make sure you know, tell your family, your wife, yourself, have water, have some food, keep a baseball bat and all the other stuff that my guest talks about in the podcast.

02:16:12.398 --> 02:16:17.241
But then the other thing is in the long term, because I think, you know, shit is going to go down and it's not going to be good.

02:16:17.881 --> 02:16:21.783
You know, if you speak to people, that's the second time he said that lived in the communist countries.

02:16:22.304 --> 02:16:23.184
We didn't protest.

02:16:23.705 --> 02:16:25.365
We didn't go on marches against state.

02:16:25.686 --> 02:16:26.186
Are you kidding me?

02:16:26.466 --> 02:16:30.328
That's like that's like send that chap to Gulag, you know, Siberia.

02:16:30.548 --> 02:16:31.169
Why would you do that?

02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:33.410
So he knows so much about communism suddenly.

02:16:33.470 --> 02:16:34.291
Isn't that interesting?

02:16:34.311 --> 02:16:37.492
Because he doesn't know really anything, but he knows a lot about communism.

02:16:37.713 --> 02:16:38.333
You know, you just

02:16:38.593 --> 02:16:43.276
You went underground and you created parallel structures and you bypassed the state.

02:16:43.416 --> 02:16:45.017
Parallel structures.

02:16:45.878 --> 02:16:51.021
Oh, now I see, you know, like the alternative FLCCC or like the wellness company.

02:16:51.101 --> 02:16:52.822
I see alternative structures.

02:16:52.862 --> 02:16:53.983
We'll burn it all down.

02:16:54.523 --> 02:17:03.609
So take, for example, if your children are being schooled and indoctrinated, consider taking them out of school and homeschooling them.

02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:07.411
Many people can't afford to do that because both couples and partners are working.

02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.477
I get that.

02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:12.001
But that doesn't mean you still can't homeschool them to some extent.

02:17:12.341 --> 02:17:13.042
So what do I mean by that?

02:17:13.882 --> 02:17:16.243
It means when they come home, talk to them.

02:17:17.384 --> 02:17:17.844
Talk to them.

02:17:18.865 --> 02:17:22.847
Take the fracking phone off them and the iPad and the YouTube and the television.

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:23.987
And I'm not being a Nazi about this.

02:17:24.007 --> 02:17:26.808
You know, I mean, let them my kids watch half an hour of a cartoon here and there.

02:17:26.828 --> 02:17:30.350
You know, I'll let them do that, you know, because if you do too much, you know, then they rebel.

02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:32.191
And he's such a good generation.

02:17:32.211 --> 02:17:34.932
So that's so easy to imagine how he's such a good dad.

02:17:34.952 --> 02:17:36.693
I mean, he's there all the time for them.

02:17:36.753 --> 02:17:38.194
I can't imagine it any other way.

02:17:38.314 --> 02:17:40.695
Come on, let's get the chessboard out, or let's talk about this, and let's talk about that.

02:17:41.116 --> 02:17:44.097
And I talk to them about the fiat system, or the currencies, and how money is made.

02:17:44.117 --> 02:17:46.139
And they're like five and seven.

02:17:46.159 --> 02:17:46.499
They're old.

02:17:46.779 --> 02:17:50.841
He's teaching them all about fiat currencies because he's such a rebel.

02:17:51.282 --> 02:17:57.005
Boy, since he pulled his head out last year and voluntarily quit his job, he's learned just about everything.

02:17:57.425 --> 02:17:58.746
You can start talking about these things.

02:17:59.186 --> 02:18:03.108
So don't abdicate all of your children's education to the state.

02:18:04.089 --> 02:18:04.709
Start teaching them.

02:18:05.049 --> 02:18:05.770
Start talking to them.

02:18:06.983 --> 02:18:08.946
Another one would be stay fucking healthy.

02:18:09.807 --> 02:18:11.449
Don't get into their sick care system.

02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:14.373
Again, I was telling someone today on my podcast, you know, it's really funny.

02:18:14.393 --> 02:18:15.534
I spent 25 years in a hospital.

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:19.259
Sometimes, you know, most days I would be spending more time in a hospital than at home.

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:22.062
Sometimes I would be spending more time with my colleagues and my wife.

02:18:23.144 --> 02:18:26.108
You know, my home, my home was the hospital now.

02:18:27.057 --> 02:18:31.018
Now, if you ask me to go near hospital, I get I get like my my spine starts tingling.

02:18:31.038 --> 02:18:31.718
I get really nervous.

02:18:31.778 --> 02:18:32.518
It's very foreboding.

02:18:32.778 --> 02:18:35.259
I sense this dark energy coming from the hospital.

02:18:35.279 --> 02:18:35.859
I don't feel safe.

02:18:36.339 --> 02:18:38.280
I don't trust the hospital.

02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:43.041
I know the doctors individually might be very nice, but I don't trust the protocols they're following.

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:46.902
I don't trust indoctrination and I don't trust their judgment that they're critically thinking.

02:18:47.442 --> 02:18:49.342
I don't trust that what they're doing is in my best interest.

02:18:49.382 --> 02:18:50.083
And what do I mean by that?

02:18:50.463 --> 02:18:51.483
Well, the last few years have shown

02:18:52.253 --> 02:18:57.695
that doctors will do whatever it takes to keep their job and their license, then do what's the right thing.

02:18:58.155 --> 02:19:02.877
So instead of speaking out against mandates and experimental shots, they've just kept their head down, because you know what?

02:19:02.897 --> 02:19:03.618
They can't afford it.

02:19:03.658 --> 02:19:06.279
Like him, he kept his head down for almost three years.

02:19:06.319 --> 02:19:07.759
That's why he didn't save anyone.

02:19:07.859 --> 02:19:12.881
That's why all the shots from AstraZeneca were given out before he pulled his head out.

02:19:12.941 --> 02:19:16.283
That's why all the shots were given out around the world before he pulled his head out.

02:19:16.983 --> 02:19:18.905
before he even started speaking about them.

02:19:19.266 --> 02:19:23.271
And he still can't call them transfection, even though I explained to him why he should.

02:19:23.671 --> 02:19:27.957
He still calls them shots because he's still playing for them.

02:19:28.798 --> 02:19:30.179
He works for the slavers.

02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:34.665
He's part of the people that are controlled, demolishing the Republicans of the West.

02:19:36.412 --> 02:19:37.633
And doctors have said this to my face.

02:19:38.373 --> 02:19:38.813
And you've seen it.

02:19:39.233 --> 02:19:42.175
How many doctors around the world have you seen speak out percentage-wise?

02:19:43.075 --> 02:19:42.175
0.001%?

02:19:44.216 --> 02:19:45.116
Because they've said, no, you know what?

02:19:45.476 --> 02:19:46.517
I need to keep my mortgage going.

02:19:46.657 --> 02:19:47.337
I've got a holiday.

02:19:47.357 --> 02:19:48.638
I've got that mistress on the side.

02:19:48.658 --> 02:19:50.479
I've got a lot of shit to do.

02:19:50.519 --> 02:19:51.679
I can't afford to do this.

02:19:51.699 --> 02:19:52.200
That's reality.

02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:56.141
So this idea that doctors first do no harm, my ass.

02:19:57.222 --> 02:19:57.382
No.

02:19:58.142 --> 02:19:59.983
First, I need to take care of my pocket.

02:20:00.764 --> 02:20:01.664
I need to take care of my bills.

02:20:02.584 --> 02:20:03.605
Second, I need to take care of the mortgage.

02:20:04.287 --> 02:20:06.189
Oh, so it's mortgage and bills.

02:20:06.269 --> 02:20:10.812
And so if that means having a podcast and not figuring anything out, then that's what I got to do.

02:20:11.673 --> 02:20:21.281
If that means promoting all the people that I'm told to promote, like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Sasha Latupova, in order to pay the bills and make the mortgage meanwhile, then that's what I got to do.

02:20:21.961 --> 02:20:23.442
That's the first priority for him.

02:20:23.842 --> 02:20:28.305
First priority isn't putting everything on the line for his children and his grandchildren.

02:20:28.685 --> 02:20:34.168
Putting everything on the line doesn't mean risking your faculty position at a medical school.

02:20:34.468 --> 02:20:37.410
It means voluntarily quitting after they made it hard enough for him in 2023.

02:20:37.450 --> 02:20:38.090
This is a traitor, a fake.

02:20:41.992 --> 02:20:46.534
Hero, he does not carry anything to the battle at all.

02:20:46.574 --> 02:20:54.658
He's not got any insight or any special knowledge that brings any help or insight to anyone that listens to him.

02:20:56.319 --> 02:21:03.182
And that's why he has risen so quickly as a podcaster and why so many of these fake people promote him.

02:21:04.263 --> 02:21:06.904
Second and third, I need to look after the school and fees, holidays.

02:21:07.504 --> 02:21:08.765
I mean, where does the patient rank?

02:21:09.932 --> 02:21:10.593
I think quite low down.

02:21:10.893 --> 02:21:14.596
So when you go to a hospital, how do you know when that doctor is speaking to you and telling you what needs to be done?

02:21:14.956 --> 02:21:23.042
They're telling you what's in your best interest or what's actually in their best interest because they're following the guidelines and protocols that are going to protect them from getting into trouble.

02:21:23.062 --> 02:21:24.784
And they might know, actually, it's not right for you.

02:21:24.844 --> 02:21:25.264
But you know what?

02:21:25.804 --> 02:21:26.385
Shit happens.

02:21:26.665 --> 02:21:28.386
Nothing's going to happen to me because I'll just follow the protocol.

02:21:29.007 --> 02:21:29.647
I won't get into trouble.

02:21:30.688 --> 02:21:35.192
But if I do the right thing and tell you not to do this, protect you, well, I might get into trouble then and investigate it.

02:21:36.277 --> 02:21:36.577
You know what?

02:21:36.597 --> 02:21:38.237
I'm just going to follow the guideline.

02:21:38.898 --> 02:21:39.858
I'm just following orders.

02:21:40.678 --> 02:21:43.139
So this whole idea of first do no harm is bullshit, non-existent.

02:21:43.159 --> 02:21:44.759
So anyway, stay out of the hospital system.

02:21:45.059 --> 02:21:45.579
Stay healthy.

02:21:45.599 --> 02:21:46.759
How do you do that?

02:21:46.799 --> 02:21:47.460
Don't eat their shit.

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:48.980
Don't consume their shit.

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:50.900
Don't watch their crap TV.

02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:54.441
Listen to geopolitics and empire for God's sake and support you.

02:21:54.461 --> 02:21:56.842
It's just coffee a month or whatever.

02:21:57.342 --> 02:22:01.523
Don't go to Starbucks and spend your money on that crap, that brand piss water.

02:22:01.863 --> 02:22:02.403
Spend it on you.

02:22:03.507 --> 02:22:06.628
Look after your health, exercise, build relationships.

02:22:07.508 --> 02:22:11.570
Most of the relationships I've come across in my last 20 years have been very dysfunctional, not healthy.

02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:15.751
Man and woman, husband and wife together, and it's not really what it should be.

02:22:16.351 --> 02:22:20.473
Love, friendship, trust, passion.

02:22:21.573 --> 02:22:22.514
No, it's all gone.

02:22:22.534 --> 02:22:23.434
So you know what?

02:22:24.014 --> 02:22:32.878
make sure your relationship is a proper relationship, loving relationship, a deep meaningful relationship and have lots of sex for God's sake, you know, and then build your commitment.

02:22:32.918 --> 02:22:34.138
Have lots of sex.

02:22:34.258 --> 02:22:39.201
Now for me that's a very surprising thing to say and why is that a very surprising thing to say?

02:22:39.741 --> 02:22:42.542
Because I don't talk like that about my best friend.

02:22:44.315 --> 02:22:51.466
I would never say those words because it implies something about my relationship that's private.

02:22:52.448 --> 02:22:54.712
Something about my relationship that's intimate.

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:57.436
Have lots of sex.

02:22:58.544 --> 02:23:11.347
What kind of thing is that to say to people who are unhappy after four years of confusion, frustration and doubt, arguing about these biological ideas and being lied to consistently on television and social media?

02:23:11.727 --> 02:23:16.608
What kind of a statement is that to make to people that are alone and isolated?

02:23:21.269 --> 02:23:27.191
What does that mean about his relationship with his wife and how much he respects or doesn't respect her to you?

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:43.473
to me that's kind of a weird thing to say unless you're like a single person or something and that's just your way of coping but if you're a married person to your best friend with passion and whatever I would think a little class is in order

02:23:46.394 --> 02:23:47.155
That's just me, though.

02:23:47.496 --> 02:23:50.160
Don't be fearful of strangers and your neighbor.

02:23:51.142 --> 02:23:55.129
Get to know people and, you know, help them out because it's a good thing to do.

02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:59.817
Check in on them because it's a good thing to do and treat other people like the way you'd want to be treated.

02:24:00.836 --> 02:24:08.399
And then have faith, have true spirituality and remember that we are spirituality, but don't get into anything particular.

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:11.280
Don't be a Christian or a Muslim or believe in God.

02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:16.281
Just have some spirituality, you know, and and treat your neighbors like you'd have them treat you.

02:24:17.001 --> 02:24:21.483
Sounds like Russell Brand religiosity here are spiritual beings.

02:24:21.543 --> 02:24:24.304
And, you know, I really do believe that there's a creator.

02:24:24.324 --> 02:24:26.164
I mean, I think he's on holiday right now.

02:24:26.225 --> 02:24:27.505
But anyway, I think there is a creator.

02:24:28.499 --> 02:24:30.901
And it's funny, I'm kind of conflicted, and I'd like to hear your view on this.

02:24:31.281 --> 02:24:32.923
I don't trust any organized religion.

02:24:32.943 --> 02:24:34.384
I think they're all cults, and it's all bullshit.

02:24:34.444 --> 02:24:38.247
They've all been captured by man to control, guilt, and shame us.

02:24:38.948 --> 02:24:40.890
But take, for example, I'm an ex-Muslim.

02:24:41.971 --> 02:24:45.754
If you tell me Jesus's teachings, I'd be like, yeah, I follow them.

02:24:46.795 --> 02:24:47.735
I liked what he taught.

02:24:48.296 --> 02:24:49.017
Am I a Christian?

02:24:49.257 --> 02:24:49.337
No.

02:24:51.578 --> 02:24:55.059
You know, I think if Christ came down on the earth today, he would be disgusted.

02:24:55.739 --> 02:25:01.040
He would tear down the Vatican, and he would say, how dare you worship at the altar of the holy vaccine.

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:02.220
Okay?

02:25:02.581 --> 02:25:16.184
So, but the problem is, if we get rid of all these flawed, damaged- So you're, you like Jesus's teaching, but you're not a Christian, but if Jesus comes back, he would be pissed, but you don't believe in Jesus.

02:25:16.904 --> 02:25:17.904
So what is he, a myth?

02:25:18.964 --> 02:25:21.045
What is this mealy mouth bullshit here?

02:25:22.381 --> 02:25:38.231
not committing to anything he doesn't commit to anything nothing nothing at all there's no commitment here because he doesn't know fracking shit but he's sure that we're spiritual beings and it's a spiritual war and corrupted evil religions evil what have we got left

02:25:39.025 --> 02:25:41.066
This is how they usher in the one world religion.

02:25:41.767 --> 02:25:43.088
Oh, I thought we were already there.

02:25:43.248 --> 02:25:44.149
One world religion.

02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.669
Oh, wow.

02:25:44.709 --> 02:25:45.229
That's great.

02:25:45.289 --> 02:25:48.071
Now we're really getting all the messages right in one package.

02:25:48.171 --> 02:25:53.415
So I'm conflicted because I don't want a one world religion, but I don't really like the current religions either.

02:25:53.695 --> 02:25:56.978
But I want to keep the current religions and just make them better and go back to where they used to be.

02:25:57.658 --> 02:25:58.579
I'm kind of conflicted.

02:25:58.759 --> 02:25:59.320
What do you think?

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:02.822
This would be an entire part two podcast.

02:26:03.122 --> 02:26:03.543
Let's do it.

02:26:03.763 --> 02:26:05.865
But I think people know where I stand.

02:26:05.925 --> 02:26:10.068
I try not to bang people on the head with it, but I'm a Bible-believing Christian.

02:26:10.148 --> 02:26:15.993
I could even classify myself as a fundamentalist in a sense, but I believe what the Bible says and even warns about what you're saying.

02:26:16.013 --> 02:26:22.618
Christ said how many times there's going to be false prophets, there's going to be false churches, even the Christian churches that I attend,

02:26:23.258 --> 02:26:28.461
None of them are perfect because man is imperfect and then you know But that doesn't mean to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

02:26:28.541 --> 02:26:31.543
And so And there's new world religion as well.

02:26:31.563 --> 02:26:32.703
I've been talking about this recently.

02:26:32.743 --> 02:26:39.387
It's it's very much, you know new age occult esoteric Gnostic Theosophy Helena Blavatsky Alice Bailey.

02:26:39.407 --> 02:26:45.831
I've been calling out now in alt media a lot so you've got that top down from the top down the elites have this occult view and

02:26:46.451 --> 02:27:01.813
and now from the bottom up it's coming through all media who are literally pushing and I go to these conferences and they're pushing the same theosophic worldview which I would classify technically it's anti-christ it's anti-christian because they believe in all these luciferian doctrines and so that kind of was going to lead to my next

02:27:02.493 --> 02:27:10.498
One of my last questions for you the the media alternative media movement, which you you're not participating in with with podcasting Just you know, how's that been going?

02:27:10.538 --> 02:27:12.599
What have you been learning any thoughts on the states?

02:27:12.619 --> 02:27:27.468
You know, we've got MSM But the state of independent media and it seems like the deep state is also moving into alternative media, you know Any thoughts on moving into alternative media the deep state started alternative media you dummy

02:27:28.448 --> 02:27:32.290
Sorry, but what part of that don't you understand?

02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:47.278
Alternative media was started by the deep state, started by our governing structures, started by weaponized piles of money that want to interfere with our governance, that want to consciously and intelligently manipulate the habits and opinions of the masses.

02:27:50.199 --> 02:27:51.700
Seriously, it is pathetic.

02:27:54.151 --> 02:27:56.052
media space and the way forward there.

02:27:56.512 --> 02:27:58.973
Yeah, without naming names, you nailed it, Buster.

02:27:59.473 --> 02:28:10.038
I think the powers at large, the predator, criminal crats, philanthropists, they know that a lot of the population don't trust mainstream media.

02:28:11.018 --> 02:28:13.499
And, you know, was it Albert Pike or something like that?

02:28:13.579 --> 02:28:16.960
Scotch Freemason said we will provide the leader for the opposition.

02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:20.622
You know, they haven't spent trillions and billions with that.

02:28:21.182 --> 02:28:22.963
Did he just cite Albert Pike?

02:28:26.068 --> 02:28:27.854
33rd degree Freemason from America.

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.503
That's extraordinary.

02:28:32.267 --> 02:28:34.209
That's extraordinary gaming, everything.

02:28:35.169 --> 02:28:44.097
And they know that a significant population or percentage of the population are now following alternative media, whether it's Joe Rogan or Russell Brand or you name it.

02:28:45.038 --> 02:28:50.822
So I think they're all going to be heavily influenced and there'll be I'm not saying those particular outlets.

02:28:51.523 --> 02:28:54.585
I'm just saying I think there's a mainstream alternative media now.

02:28:55.086 --> 02:28:59.589
They're not mainstream media, but mainstream alternative media, which is captured.

02:29:00.390 --> 02:29:02.851
And they are also pushing the agenda.

02:29:03.731 --> 02:29:12.914
So subtly nudging, influencing, brainwashing, promoting the idea of false idols.

02:29:13.714 --> 02:29:15.354
And there's names that we can talk about.

02:29:16.315 --> 02:29:19.355
We've written great books, great speakers, great quotes.

02:29:19.956 --> 02:29:21.196
But then they say some really weird shit.

02:29:21.664 --> 02:29:29.367
So he's mentioned Gage and he's mentioned me and Sasha Latupova in the same breath, and then now he's mentioned Albert Pike.

02:29:30.148 --> 02:29:44.073
Albert Pike is the author of the book Morals and Dogma, Ancient and Accepted Right, and it is a book that was released in America in

02:29:51.547 --> 02:29:58.711
1944 this reprint is from, but I think it was 1906 it was entered into the Act of Congress.

02:30:00.772 --> 02:30:08.496
Entered according to an Act of Congress, yes, in the year 1871 by Albert Pike in the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.

02:30:08.516 --> 02:30:11.218
And that's this right here.

02:30:11.718 --> 02:30:12.799
So he cited this.

02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:24.144
book, which I have and have read parts of, because I feel it's really important to not talk shit, but actually to try and know shit.

02:30:24.805 --> 02:30:27.186
So yeah, I got that book.

02:30:28.746 --> 02:30:30.907
I've read the words, a lot of them.

02:30:32.108 --> 02:30:33.568
Some pretty mystical shit in there.

02:30:34.609 --> 02:30:42.592
A very interesting name to just drop out of a hat since you just woke up last year when they made you so painful that you decided to

02:30:44.178 --> 02:30:47.419
to voluntarily quit your job so you could speak out or something.

02:30:47.599 --> 02:30:49.219
Wow, it's just extraordinary.

02:30:49.379 --> 02:30:59.442
It's extraordinary how pathetic their narratives are when they're actually held up against knowledge and previous work.

02:31:00.422 --> 02:31:01.283
It's kind of pathetic.

02:31:01.783 --> 02:31:05.844
It's the T-shirt that says, COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

02:31:08.384 --> 02:31:10.325
Oh, for God's sake, just take the damn shot.

02:31:12.032 --> 02:31:12.673
Who said that?

02:31:12.733 --> 02:31:13.535
Is that you?

02:31:13.715 --> 02:31:15.618
Or was that Joe Rogan?

02:31:15.678 --> 02:31:19.344
Or was that, I don't know, Jordan Peterson?

02:31:19.445 --> 02:31:23.872
It certainly wasn't him because he wasn't saying anything when people were taking the shot.

02:31:23.912 --> 02:31:24.593
Give them hell!

02:31:25.509 --> 02:31:28.531
You know, what narrative does that fit?

02:31:29.311 --> 02:31:40.076
And the thing is with these, the best lie, the best lie is one that's coated in layers and layers of truth, because then it's so easy to swallow.

02:31:40.997 --> 02:31:44.959
So 90%, 95% of the stuff they'll tell you is like exactly what you want to hear.

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:52.243
But it's either the omission, what they don't talk about, or what they gently throw in, and then you accidentally swallow.

02:31:53.503 --> 02:31:54.444
And there's a lot of these around.

02:31:55.419 --> 02:31:56.100
Including him.

02:31:57.360 --> 02:32:00.322
As sad as it is, that's exactly the role that he plays.

02:32:00.342 --> 02:32:01.122
You get nowhere.

02:32:01.182 --> 02:32:02.143
He's a hamster wheel.

02:32:02.543 --> 02:32:06.245
If there's anyone out there who's basically saying, come to me.

02:32:06.885 --> 02:32:07.486
I have answers.

02:32:08.166 --> 02:32:10.027
I will lead the way and free you.

02:32:10.708 --> 02:32:11.628
I will show you the path.

02:32:12.549 --> 02:32:13.949
Run the fucking opposite direction.

02:32:14.129 --> 02:32:14.670
There you go.

02:32:15.050 --> 02:32:18.012
So if anybody says they know what they're talking about, run away.

02:32:18.112 --> 02:32:21.453
If anybody says that they have something to teach you, run away.

02:32:23.311 --> 02:32:26.294
Don't work to evaluate their claims.

02:32:26.374 --> 02:32:30.718
Don't try to learn what they're trying to teach and then evaluate it on your own terms.

02:32:31.178 --> 02:32:35.382
Don't listen and try to understand their ideas and then evaluate them.

02:32:35.982 --> 02:32:37.884
Run the other way.

02:32:39.105 --> 02:32:45.531
And follow people like me and Herve who are humble enough to admit that we don't know a frackin' thing.

02:32:46.834 --> 02:32:48.415
as far as I can say, okay?

02:32:48.715 --> 02:32:52.598
The only person you should ask to lead the way and help you is God.

02:32:53.499 --> 02:32:57.322
Look in the mirror and find your own leader in that reflection.

02:32:58.002 --> 02:32:59.063
God is within us all.

02:32:59.923 --> 02:33:02.805
There lies your leader, and don't rely on anyone else.

02:33:03.006 --> 02:33:03.866
So how do we do that?

02:33:03.886 --> 02:33:04.647
Do we pray?

02:33:04.687 --> 02:33:09.350
Do we say rosaries with Russell Brand?

02:33:11.492 --> 02:33:12.713
God's in every one of us?

02:33:13.653 --> 02:33:14.174
What God?

02:33:14.214 --> 02:33:15.375
Which one are you talking about?

02:33:16.152 --> 02:33:18.533
You want to go back to the old religions, the way they used to be.

02:33:18.594 --> 02:33:20.275
What is this nonsense?

02:33:20.335 --> 02:33:22.996
This non-committal spittle.

02:33:23.136 --> 02:33:27.119
Don't abdicate your power, your responsibilities, your thinking.

02:33:27.479 --> 02:33:29.700
Don't abdicate your responsibilities.

02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:32.922
Don't use words that Jonathan Cooey uses, please.

02:33:33.343 --> 02:33:36.404
To some other person because you're a lazy piece of shit.

02:33:36.485 --> 02:33:37.405
Who's lazy?

02:33:38.086 --> 02:33:45.090
This guy's been podcasting for a year, claims to be trying to do something, I guess, but hasn't figured anything out yet.

02:33:46.564 --> 02:33:47.485
Who's lazy?

02:33:47.565 --> 02:33:49.086
Who's not doing any of the reading?

02:33:49.447 --> 02:33:51.249
Instead, just podcasting all the time.

02:33:51.629 --> 02:33:52.670
I don't want to learn anything.

02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:54.071
I got so many people to interview.

02:33:54.111 --> 02:33:55.192
I don't have time to learn.

02:33:55.413 --> 02:33:56.794
Don't think, oh, I'm not worthy.

02:33:56.834 --> 02:33:57.695
I'm not smart enough.

02:33:57.755 --> 02:33:58.095
Yes, you are.

02:33:58.636 --> 02:33:59.036
We all are.

02:33:59.537 --> 02:34:01.218
No, you just said you're not.

02:34:01.318 --> 02:34:09.066
You just said for the last hour that you've been podcasting for a year since you pulled your head out and you haven't figured out fracking shit.

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:14.504
In case you're not aware, this is a complete contradiction, right?

02:34:14.524 --> 02:34:20.349
This is just him wrapping up with a massive contradiction the size of a battleship.

02:34:20.569 --> 02:34:21.309
You need to have it in there.

02:34:21.329 --> 02:34:22.070
You need it in your gut.

02:34:22.530 --> 02:34:24.872
Your gut instinct tells you something is off.

02:34:25.373 --> 02:34:25.893
Go with your gut.

02:34:26.173 --> 02:34:29.376
Okay, so gut instinct tells me that you're a lying traitor.

02:34:29.476 --> 02:34:32.178
So I went with my gut and did a two-hour show about you.

02:34:32.598 --> 02:34:33.659
How you like them apples?

02:34:34.339 --> 02:34:35.040
Do not override it.

02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:36.181
It never lets you down.

02:34:37.328 --> 02:34:39.810
That's also why I think Meryl Nass is a liar.

02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:41.951
That's why I think Robert Malone's a liar.

02:34:41.971 --> 02:34:47.053
That's why I think Peter McCullough has probably been convinced that if he doesn't lie, they'll ruin him.

02:34:47.434 --> 02:34:53.277
That's why I think Pierre Kory is still selling a book about ivermectin, because they're all liars.

02:34:54.565 --> 02:35:01.187
That's why I think that this guy is compromised because he pretended to be a rival of Robert Malone, but he's really not.

02:35:01.267 --> 02:35:03.907
He lied about that too, just like Sasha lies about it now.

02:35:04.307 --> 02:35:06.448
And that's why him and Sasha are working together.

02:35:06.828 --> 02:35:12.589
That's why he said in this podcast that Sasha and Jay have pretty similar ideas, which they definitely do not.

02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:14.510
They are.

02:35:15.703 --> 02:35:19.724
There is a drive to create, you know, this alternative sound thing.

02:35:19.924 --> 02:35:22.604
So, you know, the capture 70 percent of people with the mainstream media.

02:35:22.904 --> 02:35:24.425
And then how do we capture the 30 percent?

02:35:25.325 --> 02:35:27.885
It's obvious you get you get those voices.

02:35:28.766 --> 02:35:32.826
So, you know, the reason why I'm on your show is, you know, because I think you work for the CIA and I'm working for the M.I.C.

02:35:32.846 --> 02:35:35.207
No, I'm just joking, you know, because we are truly independent.

02:35:35.567 --> 02:35:38.527
You know, we say as it is, we there's no topic we won't cover.

02:35:38.948 --> 02:35:41.088
I'm happy talking about 9-11 and what bullshit job that was.

02:35:41.668 --> 02:35:42.809
I'm happy talking about anything.

02:35:43.350 --> 02:35:45.011
I won't shy away from these things.

02:35:45.151 --> 02:35:47.053
I will connect all the dots, but I won't get any answers.

02:36:00.549 --> 02:36:01.190
You cover everything.

02:36:01.631 --> 02:36:02.352
You're very open-minded.

02:36:02.372 --> 02:36:03.393
So yeah.

02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:17.312
We wouldn't want to save anybody from a criminal vaccine schedule.

02:36:18.073 --> 02:36:19.514
We just want everybody to be free.

02:36:19.554 --> 02:36:22.096
We want people to be able to say whatever they want to say.

02:36:22.136 --> 02:36:31.202
And if it's not right, or if it's a lie that traps people or disarms them from acting in their own best interest, we don't care.

02:36:32.002 --> 02:36:34.584
We just want people to be able to say whatever they want to say.

02:36:35.585 --> 02:36:36.906
Stop lying!

02:36:38.132 --> 02:36:42.515
I think, you know, the listenership, they they are hopefully wise enough and smart enough.

02:36:43.196 --> 02:36:47.199
The question is, how do we get our loyal group of followers who listen to us?

02:36:47.519 --> 02:36:48.760
How do we grow that?

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:54.845
How do we get food to that 70 percent of people who are totally indoctrinated and brainwashed?

02:36:55.065 --> 02:37:06.274
I think that I think the way to do it would be to accept fame and comfort from weaponized piles of money and then get programmed to rise among the opinion of these people.

02:37:07.168 --> 02:37:16.693
and say messages that are not threatening to the narrative that the deep state wants to provide, that the globalized, weaponized piles of money wants to provide our children.

02:37:16.753 --> 02:37:17.833
That's how you do it.

02:37:18.294 --> 02:37:25.357
And then you can take care of your mortgage, you can take care of your kids, you can take care of your future and screw everybody else.

02:37:25.857 --> 02:37:29.499
Screw the people that they murdered and lied about because you need to get yours, man.

02:37:29.739 --> 02:37:30.860
That's the biggest challenge.

02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:32.601
I'd be interested to know what you think of that.

02:37:33.174 --> 02:37:36.136
I think some of them just, they can't, they will never.

02:37:36.976 --> 02:37:38.397
That's just how it is, that's just how it is.

02:37:38.457 --> 02:37:47.561
You know, there's a quote in the Bible, it's just some, it talks about us men, man, which includes women, man, as clay pots, and some were made for destruction.

02:37:48.462 --> 02:37:50.083
And so, unfortunately,

02:37:50.743 --> 02:37:53.044
You know, there's these clay pots that were made for destruction.

02:37:53.224 --> 02:37:53.525
I don't know.

02:37:53.545 --> 02:37:54.225
I don't have the answer.

02:37:54.285 --> 02:37:59.188
But you know, we, you and I, we and people listening, we all do what we do every day.

02:37:59.208 --> 02:38:09.934
I remember Ricardo Boschi, I had him on the program, former Australian Special Forces a few years ago, and he emphasized Teddy Roosevelt's quote, just do what you can with what you got, where you're at, common sense.

02:38:10.775 --> 02:38:13.036
And Doc, you're a fantastic guest.

02:38:13.476 --> 02:38:18.442
So, you know, crystallizing a lot of things for us and a great podcaster as well.

02:38:19.063 --> 02:38:25.110
And so any final thought for us as we head into whatever we're heading into.

02:38:26.176 --> 02:38:30.039
Nah, just say to everyone listening, you know, just do all the things I just said.

02:38:30.059 --> 02:38:31.240
Stay healthy, stay free.

02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:32.961
Also, just be happy, right?

02:38:32.981 --> 02:38:35.704
You know, turn off your goddamn phone, turn off the TV, the news.

02:38:36.144 --> 02:38:37.005
Don't listen to their shit.

02:38:37.045 --> 02:38:39.807
You know, honestly, I go outside just even to my garden and look at my chickens.

02:38:39.847 --> 02:38:40.387
It makes me happy.

02:38:40.888 --> 02:38:42.669
There's a particular chicken right now called Jenny.

02:38:42.689 --> 02:38:43.610
She's the cutest chicken ever.

02:38:43.650 --> 02:38:44.130
She's so brave.

02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:46.732
She's the smallest of all the chickens that we've got, but she's the bravest.

02:38:46.772 --> 02:39:06.480
I'm sorry, but this reminds me a lot of the podcast in March of 2020 when Mark Kulak interviewed Kevin McCarron for the first time and Kevin McCarron claimed to like to shoot guns and held up an arrow because he did archery in Japan.

02:39:07.492 --> 02:39:18.679
When in reality, I had just done a really killer video on YouTube about how you can teach yourself compound bull mechanics.

02:39:19.139 --> 02:39:21.040
You can teach yourself to fix a car.

02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:26.603
You can learn basic virology and immunology and teach your way out of this pandemic.

02:39:27.304 --> 02:39:35.268
And then the same week, Kevin McCarren just happens to be holding a little arrow and claiming that he does archery in Japan.

02:39:35.288 --> 02:39:36.549
Stop lying!

02:39:37.236 --> 02:39:41.001
And now this guy just happens to have chickens and think they're really cute.

02:39:41.322 --> 02:39:46.969
And he's got a studio in his backyard and it just happens to be that that's the way it is.

02:39:47.089 --> 02:39:50.093
It's like, come on, come on guys.

02:39:50.173 --> 02:39:51.175
It's just pathetic.

02:39:51.255 --> 02:39:51.996
And I love her for that.

02:39:52.236 --> 02:39:53.416
Wherever I go, she follows behind me.

02:39:53.436 --> 02:39:54.377
And when I turn around, she freezes.

02:39:54.797 --> 02:39:56.097
I keep walking, then I turn around, she freezes.

02:39:56.477 --> 02:39:57.318
And she's looking for food.

02:39:57.378 --> 02:39:57.798
I give her the food.

02:39:57.818 --> 02:39:58.658
She'll eat from my hand.

02:39:58.978 --> 02:39:59.378
I pick her up.

02:39:59.398 --> 02:40:00.159
She lets me pick her up.

02:40:00.239 --> 02:40:00.779
She's adorable.

02:40:01.079 --> 02:40:05.761
And I just think everybody should just be brave and happy, happy warriors in this fight.

02:40:05.801 --> 02:40:11.703
Because what you don't want to do is get down into this doom and gloom and negativity and depressed and fearful and anxious.

02:40:11.963 --> 02:40:13.383
Because if you think about all these emotions, what are they?

02:40:13.403 --> 02:40:14.464
They're dark, dark emotions.

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:14.964
What's dark?

02:40:15.364 --> 02:40:15.984
Dark is evil.

02:40:16.304 --> 02:40:17.745
Dark is Luciferian, satanic.

02:40:18.085 --> 02:40:19.005
That's what they want you to feel.

02:40:19.725 --> 02:40:20.285
What is the light?

02:40:20.686 --> 02:40:21.266
Light is hope.

02:40:21.966 --> 02:40:22.826
Light is happiness.

02:40:23.267 --> 02:40:23.907
Light is love.

02:40:24.627 --> 02:40:30.350
OK, so you need to shine the light from within outward and have joy.

02:40:30.430 --> 02:40:37.554
No matter how tough life gets, how miserable, you know, I've lost my career, you know, struggling to make a living and pay the bills, wife increasing our hours.

02:40:38.354 --> 02:40:39.154
It's okay, I'm still happy.

02:40:39.575 --> 02:40:41.296
Oh, so his wife's got a job.

02:40:41.496 --> 02:40:42.056
I see.

02:40:42.156 --> 02:40:55.143
So then really you're not struggling in the same way that we were, where I had a wife that had dedicated her life to the kids at home and we were relying on one income that wasn't enough at the start of the pandemic.

02:40:55.203 --> 02:41:00.526
And then we lost a 20 year career that both of us had invested in as a partnership.

02:41:01.306 --> 02:41:04.328
This is somebody with her own career still.

02:41:06.328 --> 02:41:08.809
So he's struggling to make a living, but not really.

02:41:10.030 --> 02:41:13.032
Kinda, but not really because he quit on his own.

02:41:14.072 --> 02:41:17.394
He volunteered to stop because they made it so hard for him last year.

02:41:18.817 --> 02:41:22.119
I don't know if you're aware, but the pandemic's been going on for almost five years now.

02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:23.961
And people look at me and go, no, you look really great.

02:41:23.981 --> 02:41:24.741
You look really happy.

02:41:25.082 --> 02:41:27.743
And it comes down to, I'd rather be poor, free and happy.

02:41:27.763 --> 02:41:30.766
Oh, he's poor and he's free.

02:41:30.926 --> 02:41:36.690
And he's, he's doing the right thing because he's a card carrying hero from last year.

02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.790
Rich.

02:41:38.843 --> 02:41:40.844
and a slave and miserable.

02:41:42.045 --> 02:41:46.769
So I would just say to everybody, be happy and live your life now like it's your last.

02:41:47.209 --> 02:41:48.890
And don't worry too much about tomorrow.

02:41:49.290 --> 02:41:51.192
Okay, that's exactly what I'm doing.

02:41:51.232 --> 02:41:53.433
And that's why I'm calling the liars for who they are.

02:41:53.473 --> 02:41:54.914
Because I'm not worried about tomorrow.

02:41:54.954 --> 02:41:56.395
I'm not worried about getting rich.

02:41:56.996 --> 02:41:58.737
I'm worried about my grandkids.

02:41:59.297 --> 02:42:00.819
I'm worried about my children.

02:42:01.832 --> 02:42:07.094
not being able to see the liars because there are so many of them that are willing to lie together.

02:42:07.634 --> 02:42:13.935
Just like the experiment he explained, they're going to walk some of these liars off the stage because they have him.

02:42:13.955 --> 02:42:19.377
Stand back from the timeline of humanity.

02:42:20.111 --> 02:42:22.093
You know, we've been on this planet a really long time.

02:42:22.213 --> 02:42:24.695
And sometimes it's been great, sometimes it's been shit.

02:42:25.195 --> 02:42:26.376
Wars have come and gone.

02:42:26.496 --> 02:42:27.737
Empires have risen and fallen.

02:42:27.757 --> 02:42:28.578
And you know what?

02:42:28.618 --> 02:42:29.538
It's going to be the same, same.

02:42:29.858 --> 02:42:39.186
These idiots that are planning this, this rich, small, powerful cabal of families, individuals, banks, whatever, corporations, they think they're so fracking smart.

02:42:39.506 --> 02:42:45.571
But they're so sick spiritually, mentally, physically, inbred.

02:42:46.031 --> 02:42:46.792
There's no hope for them.

02:42:47.492 --> 02:42:51.275
They're chasing this transhumanism and living forever ain't going to happen.

02:42:52.175 --> 02:42:53.396
They're going to destroy themselves.

02:42:54.237 --> 02:42:55.498
In some respects, we don't need to do anything.

02:42:56.198 --> 02:42:57.079
We don't need to do anything.

02:42:57.119 --> 02:42:57.839
They will.

02:42:58.099 --> 02:43:00.141
We don't need to do anything.

02:43:00.181 --> 02:43:01.522
We don't need to fight the who.

02:43:01.542 --> 02:43:02.282
Why would we do that?

02:43:02.322 --> 02:43:03.243
We can just let them.

02:43:05.244 --> 02:43:07.106
Holy cow, destroy themselves.

02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:08.952
And you know what?

02:43:08.972 --> 02:43:09.812
Things will get better again.

02:43:10.813 --> 02:43:13.136
And some other shit will come along, like a big asteroid.

02:43:13.416 --> 02:43:13.716
Who knows?

02:43:14.156 --> 02:43:16.679
So don't fret too much about it.

02:43:16.719 --> 02:43:19.261
Don't get too paranoid and miserable and depressed.

02:43:20.282 --> 02:43:21.423
Just be that shining light.

02:43:21.803 --> 02:43:23.325
Be grateful for everything that we have.

02:43:23.525 --> 02:43:25.347
Get out of nature and love.

02:43:26.168 --> 02:43:26.848
And have lots of sex.

02:43:27.629 --> 02:43:29.110
I would totally agree.

02:43:29.310 --> 02:43:30.692
You really- For everything that we have.

02:43:30.832 --> 02:43:32.654
Get out of nature and love.

02:43:33.454 --> 02:43:34.035
And have lots of sex.

02:43:35.115 --> 02:43:52.587
Have lots of sex he said it again He said it again To a world full of lonely people that have lost their loved ones Some people watch their best friend die from kovat protocols.

02:43:52.647 --> 02:43:54.328
He's saying have lots of sex.

02:43:54.348 --> 02:43:54.368
I

02:43:57.327 --> 02:44:04.073
in a, to a group of young adults that were abandoned at the beginning of the pandemic where no other adults would stand up for them.

02:44:04.113 --> 02:44:09.318
And they had to deal with universities and, and testing protocols and the pressure to get.

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.941
And now he's just saying, have lots of sex.

02:44:16.187 --> 02:44:18.869
What a malevolent traitor, piece of garbage.

02:44:18.889 --> 02:44:20.110
I would totally agree.

02:44:20.310 --> 02:44:21.191
You really nailed it.

02:44:21.211 --> 02:44:23.113
That's where my head has been at for a long time.

02:44:23.533 --> 02:44:36.363
Um, I mean, in general, when you were saying, and that's why, you know, Ecclesiastes from the old Testament has, has always been my favorite, one of my favorite books from the Bible where it says, there's nothing you under the sun, uh, you know, vanity of life is a vain parade.

02:44:36.883 --> 02:44:38.605
Um, eat, you know, obey God.

02:44:38.805 --> 02:44:40.666
At least he could have said, make love.

02:44:42.308 --> 02:44:44.029
Like what in the world?

02:44:47.614 --> 02:44:49.135
eat, drink, and be merry.

02:44:49.796 --> 02:44:50.556
That's where we're at.

02:44:50.657 --> 02:44:55.020
I hope Jenny makes for a good chicken burger eventually.

02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:57.642
And Doc, it's been great.

02:44:57.922 --> 02:44:58.543

I love chatting to you.

02:45:45.614 --> 02:45:48.236
And don't forget, you need to feed Jenny the chicken as well.

02:45:48.256 --> 02:45:48.516
Yes.

02:45:49.737 --> 02:45:50.957
All right, Doc, give other great work.

02:45:51.017 --> 02:45:52.258
Thanks for being on Geopolitics & Empire.

02:45:52.758 --> 02:45:55.200
I hope you enjoyed this Geopolitics & Empire podcast.

02:45:56.758 --> 02:46:02.885
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been in the car with these people for a very, very, very long time.

02:46:03.666 --> 02:46:04.026
Okay?

02:46:04.667 --> 02:46:05.528
Very long time.

02:46:10.481 --> 02:46:12.904
You can see them because they actually promote each other.

02:46:13.204 --> 02:46:15.507
They argue with each other, but it's all bullshit.

02:46:15.847 --> 02:46:25.599
And so you can see Sasha Latapova arguing with Kevin McKernan or agreeing with him on some aspects, just like you can see Doc Malek promoting Sasha Latapova.

02:46:25.959 --> 02:46:30.585
These are all people that are hired in order to, like,

02:46:32.165 --> 02:46:34.666
curate a limited spectrum of debate.

02:46:34.806 --> 02:46:41.189
And Doc Malek is just a guy who's agreed not to answer any questions or not to ask any meaningful ones.

02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:42.790
And that's the same thing.

02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:46.352
You are not engaging at all in this case.

02:46:46.392 --> 02:46:52.835
He's decided not to gauge at all in a very lively debate, but instead just to admit that he doesn't fracking know anything.

02:46:53.235 --> 02:46:56.457
And it's just better to, I don't know, have lots of sex.

02:46:59.281 --> 02:47:00.802
Ladies and gentlemen, they're doing this.

02:47:01.042 --> 02:47:03.863
They're doing it with people that are willing to lie to us.

02:47:04.743 --> 02:47:06.423
Doc Malek is one of those people.

02:47:06.524 --> 02:47:08.444
Sasha Latupova is one of those people.

02:47:08.524 --> 02:47:10.485
Kevin McKernan is one of those people.

02:47:10.925 --> 02:47:12.746
Meryl Nass is one of those people.

02:47:13.126 --> 02:47:14.726
Robert Malone is one of those people.

02:47:14.946 --> 02:47:16.427
Epi Girl is one of those people.

02:47:18.496 --> 02:47:27.021
And they have been lying to us in coordination, in Zoom meetings and in signal chats and in telegram groups for years.

02:47:27.501 --> 02:47:29.082
They lie on podcasts.

02:47:29.182 --> 02:47:31.584
They agree to laugh about the same stuff.

02:47:33.505 --> 02:47:38.027
Even when their dads know what's going on and their dads work with their other dads.

02:47:38.568 --> 02:47:44.211
They pretend like they're self-made and they suffered even though they got a half a million dollars settlement.

02:47:45.796 --> 02:47:49.358
I didn't get a half a million dollar settlement from my loss.

02:47:50.299 --> 02:47:52.560
I trust you understand that.

02:47:53.060 --> 02:47:55.642
These people have been misleading the young for years.

02:47:55.762 --> 02:47:57.163
That's why they tour the world.

02:47:57.563 --> 02:48:00.565
That's why these clowns are in Geneva right now.

02:48:01.606 --> 02:48:06.369
Because it is a coordinated operation to mislead the young about a lot of things.

02:48:07.659 --> 02:48:13.682
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:48:14.162 --> 02:48:16.303
The biologist's name is Jonathan Cooey.

02:48:16.343 --> 02:48:19.645
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as often as I can.

02:48:20.965 --> 02:48:26.228
Please stop transfection in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:48:26.668 --> 02:48:31.551
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:48:32.011 --> 02:48:36.353
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:48:37.588 --> 02:48:42.553
Here at GigaOM Biological, we do know a little bit more than frackin' nothing.

02:48:43.294 --> 02:48:47.758
And we try to teach as much as we possibly can every frackin' day.

02:48:48.539 --> 02:48:54.265
Ladies and gentlemen, if you like what you saw, please go to GigaOM Biological and share the stream or find a way to support it.

02:48:54.685 --> 02:48:56.407
I'll see you again tomorrow at 10.10.

02:48:56.447 --> 02:48:57.168
Thanks very much.
