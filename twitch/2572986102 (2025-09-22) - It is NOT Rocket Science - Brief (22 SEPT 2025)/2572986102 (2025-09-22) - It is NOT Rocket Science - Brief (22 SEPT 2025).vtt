WEBVTT

00:48.320 --> 00:52.824
She says her love for me could never die.

00:52.864 --> 01:06.277
That'd change if she ever found out about you and I. Oh, but her love was cold.

01:07.278 --> 01:10.020
Would it hurt her if she didn't know?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.523
Because when it gets too much,

01:21.351 --> 01:27.955
I'm gonna run to you.

01:27.975 --> 01:33.557
Cause when the feeling's right, I'm gonna run all night.

01:33.698 --> 01:41.282
I'm gonna run to you.

01:41.382 --> 01:44.043
She's got a heart of gold.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.664
She can't let me down.

02:08.558 --> 02:11.621
I need to feel your touch.

02:11.661 --> 02:15.085
I'm gonna run to you.

02:15.345 --> 02:18.328
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you.

02:18.428 --> 02:21.812
Cause when the ceiling's right, I'm gonna stay all night.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.023
you

03:39.189 --> 03:44.679
Oh, where the feeling's right now.

03:44.699 --> 03:45.139
Oh, yeah.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.186
Where the feeling's right now.

03:49.206 --> 03:49.848
I'm gonna rock you.

04:14.949 --> 04:15.710
That's a tough cut.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.551
I still have to learn how to cut that one right.

04:18.591 --> 04:24.795
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen, playing with a little bit of technical changes made here in the background.

04:25.536 --> 04:32.320
Still trying to stay focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and trying to love your neighbor.

04:34.525 --> 04:39.850
There may be a missile landing in the background, or that's just an airplane.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.092
Anyway, love that Brian Adams.

04:43.133 --> 04:46.175
Yeah, it's like my high school kind of tunes.

04:46.255 --> 04:48.077
He's a great guy.

04:49.158 --> 04:57.385
Lots of songs about love and lost love and love and lost love and traveling with lost loves and chasing lost loves and stuff like that.

04:58.395 --> 05:07.657
Not the kind of music that my kid is listening to right now, unfortunately, but that's just the world that we live in Today I've got kind of a long program.

05:07.717 --> 05:26.320
I'm gonna try and push through it And get through it by two hours because I do want to go to the gym with my boys this afternoon at 2 30 However, I do have something quite interesting lined up I got a really short analysis of a PBS clip that I think just kind of sets us up for what what

05:27.529 --> 05:29.550
I'm not the first person to propose this.

05:30.950 --> 05:34.331
I think a lot of people need to take a swing at this tree.

05:35.411 --> 05:38.212
It's going to take a lot of lumberjacks to cut this tree down.

05:39.232 --> 05:47.514
I'm really interested in pursuing this on a very aggressive basis.

05:48.395 --> 05:52.816
I think recent American history has been, for the most part, hijacked.

05:53.956 --> 06:16.354
especially crucial details in American history, crucial, you know, structural narratives, if you will, about why it is that we do the things we do, we say the things that we do, or we even, you know, I don't know, put our military in the places that we put it and spend the money in the way that we spend it.

06:16.434 --> 06:16.695
And so,

06:17.935 --> 06:23.319
Today's a pretty interesting program because I think a lot of loose ends are coming together.

06:23.439 --> 06:36.467
If you haven't been paying attention to Mark Kulak out of Boston, Massachusetts, at Housatonic ITS, Housatonic Live, I would like to suggest that you're missing something quite extraordinary.

06:37.988 --> 06:43.492
He has put together some pieces that seem to fit in a pretty easy way.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.114
It's almost like, you know, you could assemble

06:48.456 --> 07:05.125
lots of different pieces and lots of different ways and you could pay attention to lots of different books and ignore other books and you know lots of different assemblies of American history could be could be created and maintained

07:06.105 --> 07:20.561
And Mark's got a really interesting take on how 9-11 and bioterrorism and nukes and the Department of Energy and the Human Genome Project and the impetus to

07:22.883 --> 07:38.017
use the controlled demolition of America via the dollar to try and convert the American population effectively to the status of experimental animal.

07:39.088 --> 08:04.862
Now, I'm not necessarily sure that, you know, there might be a lot of that language that Mark uses, that I use, that comes from our regular, you know, correspondence and friendship over the last five years, but I want to be very clear about my independence in my choice to talk about 9-11 in this context, choice not to talk about 9-11 in this context,

08:05.422 --> 08:11.306
My choice to talk about Israel or religion or anything like that is my personal view.

08:11.326 --> 08:19.932
It is my personal little struggle here that I try to share as honestly as I can with the people who watch this stream.

08:21.173 --> 08:29.098
And I still don't really know who to trust other than the four other people and two dogs in my house.

08:29.238 --> 08:29.639
That's it.

08:31.010 --> 08:39.045
I'm sorry, I don't want to be a creep to all the people that are scrolling over there, all the people that have...

08:40.988 --> 08:44.050
lent me support over the years.

08:45.250 --> 08:54.716
It is just that it's been very, very hard over the last five years to have seemingly have been betrayed so many times.

08:54.796 --> 08:59.698
And so I'm gonna try and be as objective as possible as I move through this story.

09:00.739 --> 09:10.144
But suffice it to say that you gotta get your head around the idea that the vast majority, if not all,

09:11.385 --> 09:24.949
The people that we are, have been, led to believe are significant are in fact actors that provide the outward facing Lollapalooza of liars behind which

09:27.029 --> 09:45.094
there are a number of you know cordoned off little curtained areas where where the real governance of our population happens the real decisions about what is going to happen those decisions are made elsewhere outside of our purview and on a time scale that we are

09:45.874 --> 09:48.175
by design not paying attention to.

09:48.656 --> 10:08.726
The real planners that are running things and funding things in America and in banks and in multinational organizations are all thinking on 20 to 40 to 60 to 100 year timeframes because their piles of money over which that they are steward are actually huge.

10:08.806 --> 10:13.049
They are large enough to think on that timescale and probably

10:13.809 --> 10:24.056
financially distributed, managed, whatever the right word is, well enough so that they can yield that or wield that kind of control.

10:25.237 --> 10:29.099
And so again, I'm not suggesting that I know who is doing it.

10:29.199 --> 10:30.400
But for example,

10:31.727 --> 10:48.036
It strikes me as a little odd that Matt Taibbi, before the pandemic, was referring to Goldman Sachs as the vampire squid that was responsible for orchestrating EU countries' failure, bank failure, I don't know what.

10:48.577 --> 10:49.697
They orchestrate a lot.

10:49.817 --> 10:55.340
And Matt Taibbi was all about calling out Goldman Sachs as the bad guys of all bad guys.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.703
But then at the beginning of the pandemic, not only did he completely ignore

11:00.503 --> 11:09.547
anything to do with lockdowns, masks, school closings, gain-of-function viruses, lab leaks, natural viruses.

11:09.587 --> 11:10.827
He ignored all of it.

11:11.987 --> 11:15.909
But he's also kind of, you know, just dropped the name Goldman Sachs.

11:15.929 --> 11:24.092
You know, the place where Bannon worked as an investment advisor before he went into filmmaking and narrative control.

11:25.373 --> 11:33.918
The place where Aaron Seary worked after he worked as a clerk for the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court.

11:34.598 --> 11:45.724
Then he also, don't forget, he was also the lawyer that helped Silverstein or whatever his name was with the guy who got like a billion dollars for the Twin Towers insurance policy.

11:46.204 --> 12:04.857
Yeah, Aaron Siri, the anti-vax guy, yeah, he was involved in a 9-11 lawsuit, insurance policy, and he was also involved with clerking for the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court for three years, which is an interesting job that I guess you don't get by filling out an application and sending it in.

12:06.775 --> 12:15.678
And now he's supposedly the anti-vax lawyer genius that's kind of behind the broader health freedom movement of which Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:15.718 --> 12:21.180
and apparently, you know, Jay Bhattacharya and Robert Malone and all these people are a part of.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.441
This is not funny, ladies and gentlemen.

12:25.481 --> 12:27.082
This is American history.

12:28.902 --> 12:33.764
And it's available at our fingertips to document, to objectively

12:35.499 --> 12:48.941
archive and replace what this national security state is handing us on a silver platter, of course, for free on social media, complete with a wide variety of different bands that are willing to sing songs about it.

12:51.946 --> 12:54.667
That's the magic of this National Security Theater.

12:54.687 --> 12:57.207
And so I think it's important that we keep working.

12:58.148 --> 12:59.728
And so I plan to keep working.

13:00.648 --> 13:02.929
Thank you very much again for joining me.

13:04.289 --> 13:06.570
And I will see you again in a minute.

13:08.610 --> 13:13.131
Yes, I think I'm just going to say some stuff about these guys.

13:14.011 --> 13:16.672
And then, yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do here.

13:17.312 --> 13:18.434
I think that's all I'm gonna do.

13:18.454 --> 13:23.500
I think that's what I'll do is just do... I'm just trying to play around with all these screens.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.725
I'm trying to figure out if I know how to use them all right now.

13:26.765 --> 13:31.151
So just a little bit of patience would be awesome.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.693
I think this is the one I want, right?

13:53.622 --> 13:56.926
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it.

13:59.349 --> 14:00.029
And I have lied.

14:00.049 --> 14:01.111
I'm sure I'll lie again.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.914
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

14:04.014 --> 14:05.035
I try not to be a liar.

14:05.055 --> 14:05.876
I don't want to be a liar.

14:05.896 --> 14:09.200
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

14:11.596 --> 14:14.977
I guess I would ask myself, like, I mean, I lie.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.678
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

14:17.698 --> 14:19.679
I really try not to.

14:19.699 --> 14:21.520
I try never to lie on TV.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.441
I just don't, you know, I don't like lying.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.622
I certainly do it, you know, out of weakness or whatever.

14:52.229 --> 14:53.311
Truth is good for kids.

14:53.752 --> 14:57.601
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

14:58.062 --> 14:59.786
We want everybody to feel good.

15:00.087 --> 15:01.791
That's not the way life is.

15:13.885 --> 15:14.926
Welcome to the NewsHour.

15:15.206 --> 15:19.548
The political fallout from the murder of conservative activist Charlie Cook continues.

15:20.028 --> 15:30.013
Last night, Disney suddenly suspended ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live, following comments Kimmel made about how President Trump's supporters were responding to Kirk's murder.

15:30.553 --> 15:38.357
That suspension was cheered by the president and his allies, but it's also raised concern of censorship and the future of the First Amendment.

15:38.918 --> 15:43.360
Today, Democrats on Capitol Hill introduced a bill to protect free speech.

15:44.759 --> 15:59.239
One of the things that I want to start out with as a teaching moment here is making sure everybody understands that the proposal at hand here is that the entire two-party theater is staged.

15:59.799 --> 16:10.469
such that PBS NewsHour, wittingly or unwittingly, the participants of this narrative, just like Fox NewsHour, wittingly or unwittingly, is participants of this narrative.

16:11.029 --> 16:15.593
Most of these people have their Screen Actors Guild card.

16:15.633 --> 16:16.755
They are memberships

16:17.395 --> 16:32.322
They are members in an organization of people whose job it is to read the script that they are given, and more importantly, whose job it is to, as best they can, to the best of their abilities, read the script as directed.

16:34.878 --> 16:48.856
And so yes, of course, you know, John Malkovich is allowed to read the script exactly as he wants to, but that most actors, in order to get to the stage where you're John Malkovich, need to read the script as directed.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.191
And that's what these people do.

16:51.872 --> 17:04.402
They don't have the requisite knowledge to question the scripts that they are given every day after day after day after day from a group of people who are required to produce a script day after day after day.

17:04.922 --> 17:12.628
Only a certain number of those people behind the scenes need to be willing to stay on this script, but I assure you it is enough.

17:13.549 --> 17:15.331
However many is required plus 10.

17:17.529 --> 17:26.313
such that this guy knows or doesn't know that he is accepting a job, that his job is to read the script and assume that it is right.

17:27.094 --> 17:34.818
Even if it is right, but wrong in a way that is necessary for national security, they need to read the script and not question it.

17:35.118 --> 17:41.901
Read it as if they almost themselves put it together and are sure that all the research that supports it is real.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.242
That's how they're supposed to read it.

17:47.765 --> 17:48.806
That's censorship.

17:49.407 --> 17:51.268
That's state speech control.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.490
That's not America.

17:54.311 --> 17:59.396
And so what's happening here is a fake theater about free speech.

18:00.777 --> 18:08.004
The argument now here is, of course, oh, now the MAGA people are trying to censor their bad guy, the left.

18:08.104 --> 18:08.885
And so the left

18:09.406 --> 18:14.527
in the right, and the right does it when they want to, and the left does it when they want to, and that's crazy.

18:14.567 --> 18:19.528
But then maybe we should have an open discussion about what times there is necessary to censor speech.

18:20.028 --> 18:23.249
Maybe we, you know, we all agree that you can't shout, yell, and fire.

18:23.609 --> 18:28.610
We all agree that if free speech results in violence, then you can't do that either.

18:29.050 --> 18:35.471
So they want to open this door, just like they want to open this door to the idea that they could protect you on

18:36.011 --> 18:56.553
the internet if everybody had a digital id and we knew who people were so on the other side of the internet somewhere in another canyon that doesn't echo over to this part there's a band that's playing a very similar sound with a very similar combination of guitar bass and drum but they're saying something about how digital id is the way to protect our kids on the internet but

18:56.873 --> 19:10.681
all of these things are going to bubble in the background for the next few years and Donald Trump and the rest of these people are all part of that theater and they don't need to know what's coming next they just need to know that oh my gosh i got my cue i guess i'm on stage

19:12.151 --> 19:27.736
One of the people that I pointed out about a week ago is named Mark Maron that I noticed that was on all these B-level and C-level podcasts on YouTube and on Rumble talking about how he's tired of these woke comedians like Joe Rogan who make jokes about trans people.

19:28.476 --> 19:31.599
and said how, you know, trans people don't have any rights anymore.

19:31.659 --> 19:34.201
Trans people are left afraid in their houses.

19:34.261 --> 19:35.822
So maybe stop doing the jokes.

19:36.323 --> 19:39.685
And he's been on podcast after podcast after podcast.

19:39.805 --> 19:40.226
Why?

19:40.246 --> 19:50.774
Because he's got a Netflix show that's all about how Joe Rogan is wrong about COVID and was silly during COVID and is silly about this stuff and doesn't know what he's talking about.

19:51.375 --> 19:55.999
And of course that's being hyped here as part of the same thing.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.220
because who are they gonna show here?

19:58.560 --> 20:04.122
Who do they mention multiple times this week or last week on PBS NewsHour?

20:04.222 --> 20:05.082
Mark Maron.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.063
Now, why is Mark Maron important to me?

20:08.003 --> 20:23.249
Because Mark Maron is somebody I had no idea who he was until about February or March of 2020 when I started to be interacting with him and other people on a weird website

20:24.127 --> 20:35.790
that was called The Burning Platform, and they had their own little forum, and there they had shared a couple of my videos, so somebody said, hey, there's this website, and they're talking about your videos.

20:37.171 --> 20:47.294
And on that website, you're anonymous, and lots of people had funny names, and I was told that this one account with a funny name called Hard Scrabble Farmer, I believe,

20:48.257 --> 20:52.980
Maybe it's not quite that, so you won't be able to find it and verify it, but something like that.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.642
And that guy was supposed to be Mark Marin, and I had to look up Mark Marin.

20:56.682 --> 21:04.647
I spelled his name wrong a few times before I got what I thought was the right guy, a comedian who'd been on a few late night shows.

21:05.228 --> 21:10.691
You know, like Joe Rogan had been on a few late night shows where you do like a five minute, eight minute bit.

21:12.907 --> 21:25.940
So it's interesting because that guy was kind of saying that I was right about the lab leak and cool guy and wow, that guy's awesome and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, making me think that he had a podcast and maybe I could be on it.

21:27.025 --> 21:36.612
But of course, little did I know that he was just kind of starting his podcast because somebody told him that this was the time to start a podcast just like Brett Weinstein did, just like all these clowns did.

21:37.073 --> 21:38.714
And they didn't have to know why.

21:38.794 --> 21:44.719
They just had to be told by somebody who was financially behind them, somebody who was like,

21:45.419 --> 21:51.583
I don't know intellectually behind them in the sense of somebody that I looked up to because they have a private jet and four houses.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.024
And so I like that guy and he likes me.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.346
And so if he told me I should start a podcast, I'm going to start a podcast.

21:57.907 --> 22:01.749
If he's going to buy me a studio in my backyard to start a podcast, I'm going to do that.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.051
And that's what we're talking about here.

22:05.131 --> 22:06.332
People were put in place.

22:07.728 --> 22:12.111
because they have already tried this several times using TV and, you know, whatever.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.712
It doesn't quite work.

22:13.952 --> 22:17.354
You gotta have a spontaneous sort of...

22:19.110 --> 22:21.932
grassroots feeling of the movement.

22:21.972 --> 22:32.361
Everybody's got to have the impression that they're part of a much larger wave of realization, a much larger wave of awakening or awareness.

22:32.882 --> 22:46.413
That's what makes social media so magical and very different from watching TV or the news or even a late night program where there's a loud audience that seems to agree on what's funny.

22:48.294 --> 23:05.361
nothing is like the illusion of social media for creating the idea that wow this video is going around his are everybody watching this video because boy does this drive me bananas that is something that cannot be never has occurred with regular television i mean

23:06.461 --> 23:06.762
Never.

23:07.062 --> 23:12.046
I mean, that is a new level of malevolence that only social media allows.

23:12.166 --> 23:18.752
And so you have on the background this normal media that's able to play off of it.

23:18.792 --> 23:28.660
And more importantly, what you should see is that PBS NewsHour over the last two or three years has shifted almost exclusively to saying, you know, Donald Trump tweeted.

23:29.981 --> 23:31.642
The Biden administration tweeted.

23:32.549 --> 23:37.935
Substack author, so-and-so-and-so, who also publishes her stuff on, I don't know what.

23:39.076 --> 23:43.320
That kind of stuff is very normal on PBS NewsHour now.

23:44.621 --> 23:50.027
Almost as if their funders have told them that the new relevant media is there.

23:50.087 --> 23:52.530
The new relevant media platforms are these.

23:54.500 --> 24:15.915
And it's remarkable how many people before and after the sale of X during the pandemic have profited from this sale or were complaining about X before the sale and sort of excited about it afterward, even though nothing really changed.

24:16.015 --> 24:20.278
It just, it essentially was a complete drama over nothing.

24:21.403 --> 24:33.145
that somehow Elon Musk for some exorbitant number of billions of dollars bought free speech back from the guy with the long beard because the guy with the long beard wasn't letting us have free speech.

24:34.165 --> 24:35.805
It's just remarkably dumb.

24:37.226 --> 24:41.346
It's remarkably dumb when you look back at it and you see how things line up.

24:41.806 --> 24:50.628
What's more remarkably dumb is when we look back and see that after 9-11 there wasn't this same level of

24:51.699 --> 24:58.822
of actors on TV and actors on late night programs with the story.

24:59.942 --> 25:02.823
Just a couple, only a couple.

25:05.284 --> 25:11.786
And everything after that was read via script, you know, a couple news programs, whatever.

25:12.246 --> 25:15.768
And in fact, the big movies that came out, came out years later,

25:16.969 --> 25:32.702
And curiously enough, as Mark showed last night, we're made by people and combinations of people and partnerships between people that just don't make any right sense in the history of modern America if they're never mentioned.

25:34.183 --> 25:38.267
Especially because of the relevance of Steve Bannon now with Donald Trump.

25:39.448 --> 25:45.630
the relevance of the health freedom movement and all of these people relative to Donald Trump.

25:45.650 --> 25:49.570
It just doesn't make any sense at all that this is not mentioned.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.331
This can't possibly be a real news organization.

25:52.771 --> 26:07.555
And most of what is on the internet, on Substack, on X, cannot be real people because again, there are people that have dedicated 20 years of their life

26:09.284 --> 26:30.694
Like that fraud that I met at the Red Pill conference two and a half years ago, this guy Gage, that's remarkable that there have been people in place for that long because they lost control of that whole situation most likely.

26:30.714 --> 26:36.197
And so they had to have people, they had to put people out there and Gage was likely one of them.

26:38.334 --> 26:54.960
When he got co-opted, I have no idea, but that guy approached me in a elevator that was wide open about 270 degrees with glass in a hotel at the Red Pill Conference two years ago after I had given my presentation.

26:56.261 --> 27:02.143
In the elevator were three ladies with wet swimsuits and towels around themselves.

27:05.546 --> 27:05.806
Yes.

27:06.767 --> 27:10.450
And so I got in the elevator and then there comes this guy, Gage.

27:10.530 --> 27:11.811
I can't remember what is his name.

27:13.992 --> 27:22.459
It's, it's not Andrew Gage, but it's, it's Richard Gage.

27:23.199 --> 27:28.223
And Richard Gage comes into the elevator in front of these ladies.

27:28.263 --> 27:34.848
And there might've been a little girl or a little kid, or I might be remembering that part wrong, but there were multiple people that were coming from the pool.

27:35.589 --> 27:49.358
and they were in the elevator and I got in the elevator and then Richard Gage got in the elevator and we rode up and he looked at me and I looked at him and I think there was some

27:50.902 --> 28:16.777
Conversation like maybe I made a joke about the pool or something like that But when we got to his floor again, remember this is an elevator that you can see out so I think Something like the swimmers were looking out as they were barefoot dripping and I maybe I asked him if the pool was warm something like that You know then get up to the fourth floor or whatever floor was that Richards gonna get out the doors open And he looks at me and yes, he had to look like this.

28:17.218 --> 28:19.399
He says so you had to tell the truth, didn't you?

28:21.112 --> 28:23.294
And I was absolutely stunned.

28:23.414 --> 28:29.698
I didn't, you know, you'd think I would have a smart ass remark, you know, like that, but it, I wasn't prepared.

28:29.758 --> 28:31.999
I wasn't even thinking he was going to say anything to me.

28:32.139 --> 28:33.200
It was kind of bizarre.

28:33.700 --> 28:46.349
And I got to see if I've ever, I should really look to see if I've ever told this story right after the red pill conference, because it's possible that I'm missing a, a part of the conversation in the elevator.

28:46.409 --> 28:49.451
Cause somehow or another, it feels like something happened in the elevator.

28:49.471 --> 28:50.372
I don't know if there was like a,

28:51.192 --> 28:57.716
Maybe I said something clever before that in a nice way to Gage, or I spoke to the swimmers, I can't remember which.

28:58.177 --> 29:00.958
But when he was getting out is when he said, so you had to tell the truth, didn't you?

29:01.819 --> 29:03.360
And I didn't know what to do with that.

29:03.380 --> 29:03.780
What?

29:05.837 --> 29:07.218
What else should I have done?

29:07.438 --> 29:08.439
And the doors closed.

29:09.099 --> 29:10.320
It was remarkable.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.702
It was a remarkable day.

29:11.722 --> 29:24.853
And so what strikes me as very important about this is Mark's recent shows have been about the 9-11.

29:24.873 --> 29:32.640
A lot of Mark's work has been about trying to figure out why it is that this book

29:33.675 --> 29:44.960
The Big Shot AIDS vaccine and a few other books, like the book Germs, came out and talked so much about bioterrorism and anthrax and this kind of thing.

29:47.401 --> 30:00.348
And there are lots of peripheral clues about that with regard to Robert Malone behind Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Merrill Nass behind Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Veer Sharav behind Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

30:00.388 --> 30:01.088
And those three

30:02.560 --> 30:22.718
aforementioned people were in a congressional phone call discussion back in I don't know 2001 was it or about the anthrax vaccine and whether or not kids could be used to test it or it's remarkable how long these people have have had

30:24.537 --> 30:51.782
have had interaction with one another and have had seemingly, I guess, pretty good working relationships because this is over decades that they have come into contact with each other in professional situations, apparently over very serious issues like the fidelity of the vaccine schedule or the definition of and the recompense that autism people should or shouldn't be given based on the damage caused by vaccines.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.422
All these major issues

30:54.162 --> 30:59.163
over 20 or 30 years, these people have been working together with them.

30:59.243 --> 31:06.605
So it's strange in a way to think that no one on the PBS NewsHour would report that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

31:06.565 --> 31:18.628
's most close advisors are people that are associated with the biosecurity, bioterrorism, bioweapons, national security state apparatus since the early 2000s.

31:20.697 --> 31:23.938
That's a remarkable thing not to report regularly.

31:24.918 --> 31:32.260
Maybe for some people in the audience, it might even make them feel better that, well, at least if he's connected to the neocons, then who cares, right?

31:32.300 --> 31:40.722
I mean, if he's connected to all the people that the Bush administration showed him who boss and won the war on terror, then why do I care?

31:41.202 --> 31:44.063
Because that's all the same narrative here.

31:45.316 --> 31:58.782
that somehow or another, this giant security apparatus of America that is at least partially funded by 450 or 400, sorry, 340 or 350 million Americans tax money that has a lot of money for aircraft carriers and nuclear missiles and tanks and all this stuff.

32:13.263 --> 32:13.485
Right?

32:13.907 --> 32:15.696
The control of this.

32:17.325 --> 32:20.187
is completely left to chance.

32:21.008 --> 32:32.656
And if we would just get our act together as voters in America, you know, we could in theory put good guys in charge, but unfortunately the voters in America can't get their act together.

32:32.776 --> 32:46.125
And so inevitably, you know, wow, it's crazy, but this, this completely foreign funded fake, you know, person, Trump with the help of Russia was able to win once, no twice.

32:48.499 --> 32:50.481
And we're so dumb as to believe that.

32:51.982 --> 33:01.472
It's like being in a school bus and all the adults in the first six seats are saying, yeah, there's nothing we can do about Donald Trump being the driver.

33:02.072 --> 33:05.716
And if he wants to go to a drive-in movie, that's where we're going.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.480
because he got elected, right?

33:11.201 --> 33:20.594
And so we ride in that bus and that's just the agreement that everybody in the first six seats has that they're just going to agree that, you know, it's not our fault.

33:20.674 --> 33:21.715
He's in the driver's seat.

33:21.735 --> 33:22.757
Well, it's not our fault.

33:22.797 --> 33:23.758
She's in the driver's seat.

33:23.778 --> 33:24.760
Well, it's not our fault.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.222
He was in charge of that.

33:29.241 --> 33:53.492
and now think about how that apparatus could be used in a military fashion in order to create almost any narrative about any other country or even a biological phenomenon like a pandemic or even a murder that has now turned to free speech and whether or not censorship yada yada yada

33:56.434 --> 33:58.075
And on the other side, what is it?

33:58.115 --> 34:01.437
It's 300,000 people went to a stadium because they believe in this guy.

34:01.477 --> 34:04.239
And all of these people were testifying on his behalf.

34:04.299 --> 34:06.320
I'm not even sure what we saw yesterday.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.562
If anybody watched that, it's just, it's crazy.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.243
Where have they taken us?

34:15.786 --> 34:18.967
We've got to wake up and realize that something is not right.

34:19.027 --> 34:23.110
And we've got to wake up and realize that it's social media and we've got to get off.

34:25.922 --> 34:26.383
It's crazy.

34:26.423 --> 34:27.725
I didn't think I was going to say that much.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.568
Buke to Kimmel suspension.

34:29.788 --> 34:35.838
Senate Democrats today accused the Trump administration of using Charlie Kirk's murder to silence critics.

34:37.577 --> 34:38.998
It began four days ago.

34:39.478 --> 34:47.221
ABC's late-night host took jabs at Trump and the right over their weekend messaging about the suspect in Kirk's assassination.

34:47.641 --> 34:59.786
We had some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.

35:00.026 --> 35:12.454
That monologue aired after a weekend when Utah's Republican governor had suggested the suspect had leftist ideology, but the day before, prosecutors and the suspect's mother echoed that same belief.

35:14.535 --> 35:20.558
Then, yesterday, some sharp criticism from the chairman of the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission.

35:23.709 --> 35:30.856
Trump appointed Brendan Carr threatened federal action if local ABC affiliates didn't do something about Kimmel.

35:31.396 --> 35:36.621
These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly.

35:37.122 --> 35:38.483
So what's happening here, right?

35:38.523 --> 35:43.267
This is the NewsHour using footage from a podcast.

35:43.988 --> 35:49.269
which essentially concedes to the relevance of podcasts.

35:49.869 --> 35:58.151
And this administration is almost entirely composed of administrators that are more than willing to do podcasts.

35:58.191 --> 36:06.233
The guy on the FDA, the guy at the HHS, the guy at the NIH, they're all doing podcasts, podcasts all the time.

36:07.375 --> 36:21.389
And what that does by definition is shifts the, if they're not available, and even not more importantly, they're not using network media, then by definition, they are shifting the focus of that

36:22.455 --> 36:31.058
those Americans that are looking for their output or whatever they're doing and following them, they're shifting that attention off of this.

36:31.798 --> 36:32.778
They don't see this.

36:32.998 --> 36:38.780
But at the same time, if you did see it, it would still be telling you that social media is relevant.

36:39.380 --> 36:44.722
PBS NewsHour would still be saying Robert Malone's name, just like, you know, on our

36:46.022 --> 36:50.424
Corners of social media are on the more conservative side of social media.

36:50.484 --> 37:12.555
Robert Malone is known in a much wider way It's just an illusion and it's only an illusion that's possible to sustain because social media and we We use it willingly we use it skillfully We think that if we if we tweet the right thing or post the right thing that we're gonna have an effect and that's not how it works It's not how it works at all

37:14.598 --> 37:18.720
on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.

37:19.120 --> 37:26.162
Then, a company called Nexstar, which operates multiple ABC stations, said it would start pulling Kimmel off the air.

37:26.783 --> 37:32.505
Nexstar needs the FCC's approval for a proposed $6.2 billion merger.

37:32.725 --> 37:41.448
Now, if what we are saying is true, and this orchestration extends over decades of time,

37:42.307 --> 38:01.751
then what you would need is a group of people who have decades of trust in one another, a decades long relationship, a friendship where deep trust, because, you know, I remember that time when you did that line in the, you know, I remember that time when you slept with, you know,

38:03.567 --> 38:06.289
And these kinds of bonds, it doesn't matter.

38:06.329 --> 38:15.455
It can just be that I remember that time you were really drunk and you said this, or you did that, or that happened to you, or when I had to bail you out.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.116
It doesn't matter what it is.

38:17.296 --> 38:25.442
I don't, I think one of the best points that has nothing to do with 9-11 or American history or anything else is just how remarkable it is.

38:25.522 --> 38:27.944
And Mark Kulak made this point really well the other night.

38:28.484 --> 38:30.606
How remarkable it is that Mark,

38:31.286 --> 38:34.987
Really nice guy, upstanding citizen, as far as I can tell.

38:35.007 --> 38:40.328
He doesn't have friends from 30 years.

38:40.408 --> 38:46.169
He doesn't have professional colleagues that he's worked with on and off for 30 years.

38:46.729 --> 38:55.651
He doesn't have a professional relationship with anybody that has extended that long because of, you know, career changes and whatever.

38:55.671 --> 38:59.592
And I don't either.

39:00.945 --> 39:12.835
After being that long in academia, you know, after being in that many labs and having that many students, I have exactly nobody with whom I'm in contact for that long.

39:12.855 --> 39:21.483
I have one friend who I'm in contact with since 2016 when we moved back to the United States from the Netherlands right before Trump was elected.

39:24.150 --> 39:29.153
And so that's my longest friend right now in the United States that I talk to or see.

39:29.713 --> 39:43.401
You know, I have some other friends in Chicago, but because all of those friends shared my now deceased friend, Nathan, who's on my slides sometimes, it's not really the same kind of thing anymore.

39:43.461 --> 39:47.863
Because every time we talk to each other, it's kind of the first thing that comes out.

39:49.544 --> 39:50.425
And so it's a...

39:52.952 --> 40:18.769
It's a weird thing to think that the people that are in front of us, the people that they're talking about, the people that we have been talking about, the people that are responsible for Trump derangement syndrome, the people that are responsible for curating the 9-11 safe narratives, the people that were responsible for curating the anti-vax narrative for the last six or 10 years, they're all people intertwined with people who have show business connections for more than 30 years.

40:21.994 --> 40:23.896
That is fricking remarkable.

40:26.940 --> 40:32.766
What's more special though is that no one is reporting it and it was not like it was hidden information.

40:32.826 --> 40:34.168
It's right there in front of us.

40:36.821 --> 40:38.041
It's special.

40:38.241 --> 40:39.602
It really is very special.

40:39.622 --> 40:40.662
Then more dominoes.

40:41.222 --> 40:46.923
Conservative Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest owner of ABC affiliates, said they'd do the same.

40:47.603 --> 40:58.566
Sinclair said Kimmel must apologize to Kirk's family and quote, make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA, which is Kirk's political group.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.902
While meeting with the British prime minister in the U.K.

41:02.942 --> 41:06.523
today, President Trump rejected the idea that free speech was under attack.

41:06.563 --> 41:10.884
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings, more than anything else.

41:10.944 --> 41:14.364
And he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk.

41:14.604 --> 41:17.985
And Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person.

41:18.045 --> 41:19.725
And they should have fired him a long time ago.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.346
So, you know, you can call that free speech or not.

41:23.083 --> 41:29.289
This summer, the president celebrated when CBS canceled the show of another of his critics, Stephen Colbert.

41:30.089 --> 41:40.559
CBS cited financial reasons for the cancellation, even as its parent company, Paramount, was finishing a deal of its own, which also required FCC approval.

41:41.080 --> 41:46.224
But critics say Colbert's and Kimmel's political positions were why they were targeted.

41:47.901 --> 41:48.862
There he is right there.

41:48.902 --> 41:49.902
That's Mark Maron.

41:50.983 --> 41:57.467
And that's the guy I did a show about a couple, maybe two weeks ago, to show you that he was going all over the place.

41:57.507 --> 42:01.109
He's got a Netflix special where he's doing stand-up.

42:02.023 --> 42:04.525
And so his card has been pulled.

42:05.166 --> 42:18.557
And so he's on stage now and he's going to be part of this, you know, group of people that further, you know, cordons off the thing and the people that we're going to call like nutcases.

42:18.737 --> 42:26.724
And remember that if you take away the COVID vaccine, if you remember, if you take away the COVID vaccine, we still have a country of

42:29.547 --> 42:35.074
80% people that believe vaccines are completely safe, and there's no reason to worry about them.

42:36.636 --> 42:37.677
That's where we are.

42:37.697 --> 42:39.419
That is the reality of it.

42:39.639 --> 42:43.784
Even in the most optimistic appraisal, there is a

42:47.800 --> 42:57.449
a skepticism of the COVID vaccine, a skepticism of the mRNA, and that is not a 50-50 split like the election was or something like that.

42:57.909 --> 43:08.038
We need to be very aware of that because that is actively hidden, that supermajority is actively hidden, and he's of course being queued up

43:08.678 --> 43:34.085
to start to slowly reveal that supermajority to the conservative side because again remember he was on the conservative side in 2020 on the website called the burning platform courting me as possibly a podcast guest when i was riding my bike saying it's a lab leak do you see this yet do you see it yet this is what authoritarianism looks like right now in this country it's happening

43:34.969 --> 43:43.835
Last night, multiple comedians denounced Kimmel's suspension as censorship, including Wanda Sykes, who was set to be a guest on Kimmel last night.

43:44.095 --> 43:52.982
WANDA SYKES, Actress on Kimmel's Suspension": He didn't end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week, but he did end freedom of speech.

43:54.039 --> 43:55.140
within his first year.

43:56.100 --> 44:02.644
And, today, former late night host David Letterman weighed in, talking with our colleague, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

44:02.924 --> 44:13.651
And you can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration.

44:13.951 --> 44:21.535
Okay, so this is the problem I have and I'm going to try and hit it as hard as I can all the time from now on going forward.

44:22.316 --> 44:32.662
You cannot claim to believe extreme things and then not do extreme things as far as action goes.

44:33.282 --> 44:41.027
You can't say that you think the president and his administration is a criminal regime.

44:41.907 --> 44:51.114
Unless you are willing to take very extreme Measures and that's not going on an arts festival and calling it any criminal regime.

44:51.134 --> 45:07.688
That's too much I'm sorry, but that's got to be theater That's got to be theater it's got to be a scripted nonsense theater because nobody

45:08.427 --> 45:09.128
would say that.

45:09.208 --> 45:18.596
Just like right now, you cannot take anybody seriously who's going to go on TV and say that, you know, vaccines cause autism.

45:18.656 --> 45:23.080
That is not something, I'm sorry, that's not something you can take seriously.

45:23.120 --> 45:27.884
You cannot take yourself seriously if you think those three words together mean anything.

45:27.945 --> 45:32.148
Just like if you say, this is a criminal regime, that's just ridiculous.

45:32.729 --> 45:33.389
It can't be.

45:34.230 --> 45:35.730
Otherwise, that means what?

45:35.870 --> 45:43.872
It means that the entire membership of Congress is going along with a criminal regime when they have the power to do something about it.

45:45.072 --> 45:57.655
It means that the entire national security state of 18 or 19 intelligence agencies spread across our bureaucracy is just going along with it, even though apparently it's a criminal regime.

46:01.354 --> 46:08.940
And so you can't say that your son or your daughter 25 years ago got autism because of the MMR vaccine.

46:09.380 --> 46:19.969
And ever since you've been fighting for a big top tent of health freedom, having gotten nowhere, but participated in the general campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:20.009 --> 46:20.669
for president.

46:21.890 --> 46:24.492
You can't just, you can't take people like that seriously.

46:24.953 --> 46:28.876
And America as a country needs to see that essentially we've been undermined.

46:30.908 --> 46:41.995
And the most important thing might be to figure out whether the people that undermine us have loyalties to other countries or other nations or in some way are guilty of treason.

46:42.035 --> 46:44.857
And I'm not saying anything other than the truth.

46:45.138 --> 46:53.923
I really believe that there are people that are either unwitting participants in treason or have actively engaged in treason.

46:54.023 --> 46:59.067
The undermining of the American government and American society

47:01.270 --> 47:06.309
with money, with foreign agents, with lying.

47:07.811 --> 47:09.953
And I don't think it should be allowed.

47:09.973 --> 47:13.376
I don't think we should allow our government to lie to us.

47:13.456 --> 47:31.450
I don't think it should be permitted under national security reasons, especially if those national security reasons are based on ghost stories that were told in the early 50s and late 60s about genetic engineering or about living forever or about bioterrorism.

47:33.513 --> 47:46.701
And there is no explanation for why this should have been retired 15 years ago on a boat somewhere is still talking to us, being shown to us, more importantly, being sprayed all over social media.

47:46.721 --> 47:48.062
There's no excuse for it.

47:50.083 --> 47:51.264
It would be like if the U.S.

47:51.324 --> 47:54.466
government had spent money to distribute COVID tests.

47:54.926 --> 47:55.126
Oh, oh!

47:59.815 --> 48:03.063
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

48:03.745 --> 48:04.948
That's the whole point, right?

48:06.425 --> 48:08.306
You gotta understand why it's free.

48:08.406 --> 48:10.127
Why is this message free?

48:10.208 --> 48:13.450
Why does it seem like everybody agrees that this is the argument?

48:13.970 --> 48:19.974
Why is it so seamless how these people show up with the same sort of things, you know?

48:20.374 --> 48:34.864
And then the PBS NewsHour can just summarize across all the stages that right now the trend across rock music is actually everybody to use a guitar with big pointy sides and I don't know, they throw their picks in the middle of

48:36.845 --> 48:59.804
The show out to the audience and everybody screams, but I guess you know Crowdsurfing is a thing that isn't cool anymore at any of these stages And so they just all agree on this Lollapalooza of liars to talk about what's going on and across stages There's a sort of pattern or agreement, you know that on the bluegrass stage They all agree that the heavy metal sucks all the way over there and thank goodness.

48:59.844 --> 49:02.106
We can't hear them in that Canyon, but

49:03.513 --> 49:09.258
On the heavy metal side, they're all very complimentary because we wouldn't have the finger picking without the bluegrass.

49:09.318 --> 49:22.149
And so there's this kind of weird thing that goes along with the antagonism where it's like, hey, wait a minute, maybe I should check out the heavy metal because if the bluegrass people say it sucks, but the heavy metal people are respecting the bluegrass.

49:22.610 --> 49:29.156
And so you get people to move between stages and they think that they're moving between stages because it's what people say.

49:29.976 --> 49:32.237
And it's what things that they hear.

49:32.277 --> 49:39.978
But in reality, all of the artists on all the stages are scripted to say stuff that'll make you curious about what that person said.

49:40.018 --> 49:43.439
And more importantly, during set break, you're going to be able to hear them.

49:43.799 --> 49:50.100
Maybe even during set break, you're going to get a screenshot from another stage and you're going to find out what's on that.

49:50.200 --> 49:58.662
And so that's not that dissimilar to the PBS News Hour showing you or your friends or your family what they would never otherwise see on social media.

49:59.082 --> 50:00.963
because their social media doesn't have it.

50:02.184 --> 50:06.647
And so that's the role that mainstream media plays.

50:06.707 --> 50:11.450
That's the role that the late night talk shows play.

50:12.191 --> 50:21.597
Is this bridge or this, you know, illusion of consensus can be solidified on another level where first you have the interactive layer where,

50:22.057 --> 50:36.906
all of us get to tweet at our favorite people, and we get our likes, and we get our retweets, or we get our, you know, thumbs ups, or we get our, you know, shares, or whatever the hell it is on Instagram, and then above them are the people that are actually performing the script.

50:37.967 --> 50:48.994
And it is from this nearly endless list of people auditioning to get featured on the summaries, and the summaries can be Tucker Carlson,

50:50.126 --> 51:00.032
Summaries could be Kim Iverson on Rumble, the summaries could be PBS News Hour, Fox News, you know, CBS Sunday Morning, all this stuff.

51:01.733 --> 51:11.919
And the trick to see here is that social media has been moved up in the control levels because social media is starting to become ubiquitous because we all use our phones.

51:13.460 --> 51:14.901
And phones are everywhere now.

51:15.801 --> 51:18.403
And so it's not TV anymore that you need to control.

51:20.458 --> 51:26.461
In fact, TV is a delayed message sometimes, really delayed message.

51:26.501 --> 51:28.282
You know, old TV lasts forever.

51:28.922 --> 51:32.865
Social media is now and it's ever changing.

51:33.745 --> 51:35.406
You're ever seeking the latest.

51:36.186 --> 51:40.448
And it's that timeframe that will enslave our children.

51:41.609 --> 51:43.170
We need to come up with a plan.

51:44.269 --> 51:55.200
and a way to be on the same page and on the same plan as our children, the same vision for our country, the same vision for our local communities as our children have.

51:56.021 --> 52:17.122
That's the role that high schools play, and high school sports play, and nightclubs play, and bars play, and shooting clubs play, is this idea that we can get our family and friends on a multi-generational shared plan and a shared vision of where this country and where our communities are going.

52:17.542 --> 52:19.604
And these people have no idea

52:20.578 --> 52:22.741
that their script is dangerous to that.

52:22.761 --> 52:28.368
They have apparently no idea that social media is absolutely the antithesis of that.

52:29.229 --> 52:30.751
That's what I find so remarkable.

52:32.353 --> 52:34.857
In the Oval Office, that's just not how this works.

52:35.805 --> 52:46.811
Others celebrated the move to take Kimmel off the air.

52:48.132 --> 52:55.476
And earlier today, FCC Chair Parr warned more federal action could be coming.

52:55.776 --> 52:58.077
But, yes, I don't think this is the last shoe to drop.

52:58.397 --> 53:01.439
This is a massive shift that's taking place in the media ecosystem.

53:01.459 --> 53:03.460
And I think the consequences are going to continue to flow.

53:03.740 --> 53:09.706
Sinclair Broadcasting says, this Friday, it will replace Kimmel's show with a tribute to Charlie Kirk.

53:11.394 --> 53:16.715
For the record, we asked FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for an interview, and his office did not respond.

53:17.275 --> 53:19.596
For more, we turn now to Dylan Byers.

53:19.776 --> 53:22.516
He is senior media correspondent at PUC.

53:22.996 --> 53:24.457
Dylan Byers, thank you so much.

53:25.397 --> 53:30.738
Help us understand what... Of course, PUC is an Internet news source, probably with podcasts.

53:30.758 --> 53:36.539
So it's, again, the acquiescence to that is kind of, you can see the information pyramid here.

53:36.999 --> 53:40.880
Because remember, the bureaucracy, the

53:42.554 --> 53:46.499
Politicians, they're not watching 50 podcasts.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.482
They're paying for those.

53:50.104 --> 53:51.907
They're watching to see what gets here.

53:53.489 --> 53:58.216
What has been the reaction in the media world to Kimmel getting pulled off the air?

54:01.107 --> 54:02.428
Well, it's been rather overwhelming.

54:02.668 --> 54:15.919
I mean, I think there's a pretty broad consensus here, and certainly my own reporting and the reporting of others bears this out, that this was a decision that Disney CEO Bob Iger made due to the pressure from the FCC.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.362
The remarks that you referenced that Kimmel made came on a Monday night.

54:19.702 --> 54:23.025
There was no move to take Jimmy Kimmel off the air by Disney.

54:23.735 --> 54:25.176
for his show the following night.

54:25.736 --> 54:44.029
But after the chairman Carr went out and- So we're supposed to believe that this multinational billion dollar corporation called Disney doesn't have lawyers that understand what free speech is in America and whether or not their license of ABC would be in danger based on what he says.

54:44.089 --> 54:44.969
They have no lawyers.

54:45.009 --> 54:46.090
They can't figure that out.

54:46.530 --> 54:53.655
And since the FCC chairman said something like that, they're just going to back down because Disney has no lawyers, apparently.

54:53.695 --> 54:53.771
you

54:54.815 --> 55:04.762
gave an interview and suggested that he would put pressure on ABC after Nextar decided that it would preempt Kimmel's show on its owned and operated stations.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.604
Then Disney made the move to preempt Jimmy Kimmel's show.

55:08.824 --> 55:11.406
And look, you mentioned it there.

55:11.446 --> 55:17.090
So it really is supposed to feel like this group of people and then that group of people.

55:17.530 --> 55:24.615
And so then this consensus is kind of forming and it's like an overwhelming group of people that has decided to do it.

55:26.676 --> 55:27.916
And that's just ridiculous.

55:27.976 --> 55:29.176
It's like two phone calls.

55:29.757 --> 55:32.597
And then now they're telling a story that they're told to tell.

55:32.657 --> 55:37.179
These people can't possibly have all these little, these, I mean, it's just ridiculous.

55:37.239 --> 55:39.499
It's preposterous what's happening here.

55:39.880 --> 55:50.463
Package, there was some precedent for this with Paramount's decision to cancel Colbert, which was justified by the fact that Colbert was losing a significant amount of money for the network.

55:50.523 --> 55:52.523
And so there's some ambiguity around this decision.

55:52.563 --> 55:54.444
There doesn't seem to be any of that ambiguity

55:55.126 --> 56:10.894
Here, this is pretty clearly a decision that Disney came to in light of that FCC pressure, in light of that next star pressure, perhaps also because they need regulatory approval for another deal that Disney is seeking to acquire Fubo.

56:12.971 --> 56:19.634
This, look, the FCC certainly has the power to renew licenses, to revoke licenses.

56:19.954 --> 56:22.255
It does not have the power to censor content.

56:22.275 --> 56:30.798
And what we are seeing here is a sort of indirect, albeit pretty brazen attempt to influence the programming on ABC television.

56:31.596 --> 56:35.201
Earlier today, we spoke with a constitutional scholar, Ilya Sloman.

56:35.241 --> 56:40.808
He's a professor of law at George Mason University and also at the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute.

56:41.228 --> 56:44.312
Here's what he had to say about Trump and the FCC's actions.

56:46.556 --> 56:51.822
Trump is definitely abusing the power of the FCC, whatever other authority it might legitimately have.

56:52.162 --> 57:02.173
It does not have the power to force stations to take people off the air merely because they have views the president objects to, and it definitely is a violation of the First Amendment.

57:02.514 --> 57:07.960
If there's anything that violates the First Amendment, it's government pressure and coercion to censor political speech.

57:09.175 --> 57:12.757
Now, that is something that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr used to believe.

57:12.797 --> 57:20.180
There are multiple statements where he is echoing that same idea, that it is not the FCC's job to police speech.

57:20.820 --> 57:25.562
How has he responded today as to how he has had this reversal of opinion?

57:27.984 --> 57:40.688
Well, look, I don't want to editorialize here, but I would say if you're looking for intellectual consistency here among many officials in this administration, you'd be hard pressed to find it.

57:41.449 --> 57:53.733
Look, by going out and giving an interview and just suggesting that you can do this the easy way or the hard way, at the end of the day, I suppose you can technically say it was Disney's decision.

57:53.813 --> 57:54.473
I didn't do it.

57:55.123 --> 58:11.912
But that sort of reeks of sort of mafia-level tactics, of sort of veiled threats and coercion that Disney, by virtue of the position it's in and by virtue of the FCC's leverage here, that it was willing to, frankly, capitulate to.

58:12.753 --> 58:18.376
The MAGA world, the president himself and all of his supporters have celebrated this move.

58:18.436 --> 58:20.737
Now, again, what we're supposed to believe is that

58:22.023 --> 58:35.670
multi-million dollar corporations, maybe even billion dollar media corporations, flinch at the FCC chairman of the Trump administration.

58:35.710 --> 58:39.052
So remember, the Trump administration is a criminal administration.

58:39.072 --> 58:40.473
They're completely incompetent.

58:40.493 --> 58:42.514
They don't know what they're doing.

58:42.574 --> 58:43.894
They're breaking the law.

58:43.955 --> 58:48.397
They're using the government as a weapon and it's all criminal.

58:50.202 --> 58:57.329
but these huge corporations that have lawyers, you know, like lots of them and can afford to have lawyers.

58:57.409 --> 59:03.655
And how many lawyers would you really need at a table to sit down and decide whether they could win the lawsuit or not?

59:04.276 --> 59:11.903
And how much money does Disney have in order to popularize the lawsuit that Disney's being stomped on by the US government?

59:12.323 --> 59:13.525
And what a great way

59:14.145 --> 59:32.604
to make Trump put his money where his mouth is but instead PBS NewsHour is telling us that the Trump administration is so scary that all they have to do is put their FCC chairman and then put Trump in front of a camera and have him say some tough stuff and man all these media moguls will just bend like a reed

59:34.542 --> 59:35.963
It's just ridiculous.

59:36.023 --> 59:37.483
It's such a dumb story.

59:37.943 --> 59:43.986
Saying that this was a consequence of his actions, of Kimmel's actions.

59:44.326 --> 59:45.627
What else have they been arguing?

59:46.487 --> 01:00:02.174
I think this is a great- Disney's worth $204 billion, but they can't afford a lawyer that could decide what a joke that is, what a veiled and pointless threat that is, and how amazingly simple it would be to bring down

01:00:02.694 --> 01:00:10.858
the Trump administration with this incredible overreach in both verbiage and threat, just call him out!

01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:13.020
But they don't.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.780
Why don't they call him out?

01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:21.284
Because... EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME SCRIPT!

01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:27.067
...thing that has happened.

01:00:29.673 --> 01:00:43.264
Well, look, I think there's been a longstanding feeling among the right, certainly among Trump supporters, that media, generally speaking, what we usually refer to as mainstream media, has been bias.

01:00:43.624 --> 01:00:50.669
And that if you believe that broadcast networks should be sort of servicing the American people,

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:54.211
then that sort of bias is a bad thing.

01:00:54.271 --> 01:01:00.914
And I think they would view the actions against Colbert or against Kimmel as progress in that regard.

01:01:00.974 --> 01:01:10.898
I think what I would say, and I think what many folks across the political spectrum have pointed out over the course of the last 24 hours... See, that's the problem, is that it's not like that.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.478
It's a very simple issue.

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:14.839
You just have to teach people what the issue is.

01:01:14.859 --> 01:01:16.140
It's free speech.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.401
The answer to free speech is more free speech.

01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:22.405
and private platforms are not free speech.

01:01:23.526 --> 01:01:35.240
The consequences of your free speech could be professional and private, and social media makes that more complicated, but not any less

01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:40.782
true that free speech is only cured by more free speech.

01:01:40.842 --> 01:01:46.804
It's just a question of whether or not you're dealing with, yeah.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.004
This is crazy, man.

01:01:48.024 --> 01:01:49.485
We're really going into a dystopia.

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:58.727
What is happening now to, say, ABC to Jimmy Kimmel, is the kind of power and coercion that a future Democratic president

01:01:59.321 --> 01:02:02.842
could try to wield against conservative critics.

01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:05.564
So this does not set a good precedent.

01:02:05.604 --> 01:02:24.191
At the end of the day, one thing that I think we can all agree we all value here is living in a society where people are able to go out and make jokes and state political opinions without fear of retribution from their employer because their employer has a deal pending approval

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:26.630
by the federal government.

01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:37.480
And I would just say that anyone celebrating this move now... The puppets in a puppet show are not actually hitting each other.

01:02:38.861 --> 01:02:41.243
That is freaking brilliant.

01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:43.946
That is the... I could end the show right there.

01:02:44.506 --> 01:02:47.849
Puppets in a puppet show are not actually hitting each other.

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:49.130
Thank you very much.

01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:50.632
That might be a t-shirt.

01:02:50.772 --> 01:02:51.092
Wow.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:51.953
Well done.

01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:59.636
We're probably going to rethink that in future administrations if future administrations try to wield that power, too.

01:02:59.656 --> 01:03:00.776
All right.

01:03:00.816 --> 01:03:02.377
That is Dylan Byers at PUC.

01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:04.058
Dylan, thank you so much for your time.

01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:06.279
Thank you.

01:03:10.731 --> 01:03:17.397
have been tariffs, more than 20 media defamation lawsuits since he launched his presidential campaign.

01:03:17.437 --> 01:03:20.780
You see, so it's all making social media relevant.

01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:22.722
I find it very interesting.

01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:27.126
I just think that the answer is just you got to come to terms with the fact that

01:03:27.706 --> 01:03:31.128
Up until now, America has been trapped in a national security theater.

01:03:31.688 --> 01:03:50.077
The extent to which other populations in the free-speaking English Western world who also actively use social media, the extent to which they have been trapped by our own theater, I don't really know because I don't live in Germany or the Netherlands or anything like that, but I do know

01:03:50.959 --> 01:04:00.235
that in order to make the illusion of consensus seem to have a significant global part or global portion,

01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:21.785
They have recruited actors from around the English-speaking world, including in the UK and Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, who have been active on social media, very specifically on X and on Substack, the new platforms that PBS NewsHour is very willing to promote.

01:04:22.706 --> 01:04:33.195
And they were active on the conservative side, behind the health freedom movement, behind this fake skepticism of the COVID narrative, which has resulted in nothing, right?

01:04:33.235 --> 01:04:44.184
Because it's very much like, as Mark pointed out in his shows the last couple of days, the 9-11 had two basically safe narratives to talk about on TV.

01:04:44.264 --> 01:04:47.708
Maybe it was some kind of, I don't know, slip up.

01:04:48.808 --> 01:05:03.599
where the terrorists got through and we weren't aware that they got through because you know there was a there was a exercise going on that day and so there was a stand-down order and it got confused and so that allowed these terrorists to get through.

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:14.868
The other alternative was is that somehow or another maybe somebody was behind those terrorists maybe even with some part of the American security state you know that needed a new Pearl Harbor

01:05:15.428 --> 01:05:22.370
let the terrorists do it or facilitated them, much like the original bombing of the World Trade Center back in 1992.

01:05:22.911 --> 01:05:27.712
So those two narratives are very, very safe, right?

01:05:27.752 --> 01:05:36.335
Those two narratives are narratives that only came after several years, it seems in my recollection of

01:05:36.935 --> 01:05:53.211
a stewing about it being a completely staged event in the background on the internet, but never on TV, never in movies, and no one of report ever got to the stage where they were actually willing to question the physics of the building.

01:05:53.892 --> 01:05:55.173
That's the remarkable thing.

01:05:56.328 --> 01:06:02.672
Building 7 remains a ghost in the mainstream 9-11 narrative.

01:06:02.853 --> 01:06:06.455
And you can't get a rally in Washington, D.C.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:09.697
to talk about any alternative unless it involves space lasers.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:21.565
And that's again, because this is the same continuous, ever-evolving, ever-edited script that has its roots all the way back to 9-11.

01:06:23.942 --> 01:06:28.784
because America has been governed by a national security theater since before then.

01:06:28.844 --> 01:06:41.488
It's just that the tentacles of the national security theater, the number of stages available, the number of rock bands that are out there, the number of vendors,

01:06:42.771 --> 01:06:55.778
of this information has increased exponentially by design, social media being that military theater that we are now trapped in, complete with actors on scripts that complement one another.

01:07:11.035 --> 01:07:11.375
Ha ha!

01:07:11.855 --> 01:07:15.657
Zookeeper, Zookeeper, those two puppets are killing each other!

01:07:26.062 --> 01:07:31.604
Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok have just reported an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen Belt.

01:07:31.805 --> 01:07:34.766
Scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken.

01:07:35.586 --> 01:07:36.967
Hey kid, what did I know?

01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:07.452
Fellas, where you going at this hour?

01:08:08.052 --> 01:08:09.993
Hey, don't scratch up them heads.

01:08:10.773 --> 01:08:11.793
Good morning, everybody.

01:08:11.873 --> 01:08:16.255
Panic is gripping Springfield as giant advertising mascots rampage through the city.

01:08:18.856 --> 01:08:21.637
Listen carefully to the question that he asks here.

01:08:22.897 --> 01:08:27.819
Perhaps it's part of some daring new ad campaign, but what new product could justify such carnage?

01:08:28.139 --> 01:08:28.800
A cleanser?

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.641
A fat-free fudge cake that doesn't let you down in the flavor department like so many others?

01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:42.606
What product would justify, what product would justify such advertising?

01:08:43.026 --> 01:08:51.816
I think if you took this wonderful analogy but you said to yourself that social media is destroying our societies

01:08:53.912 --> 01:09:08.642
What would justify the rollout and the free reign that we have given social media over our brains, over our news, over our information, over our internet, over our children?

01:09:09.222 --> 01:09:11.504
What could possibly justify it?

01:09:12.204 --> 01:09:13.045
What product?

01:09:15.286 --> 01:09:17.488
That's the question you need to ask yourself.

01:09:17.808 --> 01:09:23.392
Even though this is an old cartoon, it is spot on if you can see the narrative, if you can see the metaphor.

01:09:26.187 --> 01:09:27.208
No!

01:09:38.514 --> 01:09:40.816
With ice and flavor, please.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.357
Ah, they're not so tough.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.298
Uh, Chief, that wasn't a monster.

01:09:45.338 --> 01:09:47.439
That was the captain of the high school basketball team.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.221
Uh, yeah, well, yeah, he was turning into a monster, though.

01:09:54.042 --> 01:09:54.442
Hello?

01:09:54.722 --> 01:09:55.042
Yes?

01:09:55.582 --> 01:10:00.943
Oh, uh, if you're looking for that big donut of yours, um, Flanders has it.

01:10:01.303 --> 01:10:02.444
Just smashed open his house.

01:10:03.524 --> 01:10:04.184
He came to life.

01:10:05.004 --> 01:10:05.544
Good for him.

01:10:14.246 --> 01:10:15.046
Help me, Lord!

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.686
I told you, Flanders has it!

01:10:18.487 --> 01:10:18.827
Or Moe.

01:10:19.547 --> 01:10:20.147
Go kill Moe.

01:10:21.533 --> 01:10:22.893
Just give him the donut.

01:10:23.114 --> 01:10:25.394
Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.

01:10:25.814 --> 01:10:28.875
Well, okay, if it'll end horror.

01:10:31.496 --> 01:10:45.801
So I have to warn you, the sound effect that's about to come up here is really brutal, but if you haven't seen it, The Simpsons is a magnificent TV show that at least for the first 15 seasons or so was just a real

01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:51.288
A real frank commentary on a lot of things in American society and an awesome show.

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:59.919
And there's a sound effect coming up that as a dog lover, every time I hear it, it bothers me.

01:10:59.939 --> 01:11:05.025
And at the same time, I can laugh because again, this is a Halloween episode, so it's very dark.

01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:06.407
People die like that.

01:11:06.948 --> 01:11:18.929
basketball player did and people talk about killing people like Homer just did but it's a whole Halloween episode so just understand that the satire here is pretty deke how dark but anyway here goes the the donut guy again

01:11:32.366 --> 01:11:34.712
Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?

01:11:35.213 --> 01:11:38.441
These monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear.

01:11:39.243 --> 01:11:40.546
And your kids should have jackets on.

01:11:40.867 --> 01:11:41.849
Did you get that joke?

01:11:43.035 --> 01:11:46.557
These monsters are destroying everything that we hold dear.

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:48.839
And you kids should have jackets on.

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:52.481
That's kind of like how the health freedom movement does it.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:56.464
The vaccines are poisoning thousands and killing thousands of kids.

01:11:56.804 --> 01:11:59.766
We don't know how many kids are dying of vaccines every year.

01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:04.389
And oh yeah, we should get the dye out of the food that we know we shouldn't eat anyway.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:10.733
We should use better oil to fry the things that we shouldn't eat anyway.

01:12:13.783 --> 01:12:17.806
You know, the kids on screens for four years because pandemic is real thing.

01:12:19.648 --> 01:12:23.191
None of those things, it's just the priorities don't make any sense anymore.

01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:24.752
That's kind of a priority joke.

01:12:27.214 --> 01:12:28.696
Hey, what's that in his footprint?

01:12:32.539 --> 01:12:33.079
Hmm.

01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:39.004
If your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them.

01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:41.927
Well, sir, advertising is a funny thing.

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:46.016
If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon it goes away.

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:48.076
Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:48.696
Exactly.

01:12:49.117 --> 01:12:52.697
If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll lose their powers.

01:12:52.797 --> 01:12:54.178
But people can't help looking at them.

01:12:54.218 --> 01:12:55.278
They're wrecking the town.

01:12:57.619 --> 01:12:59.679
You know, maybe a jingle would help.

01:12:59.699 --> 01:13:03.640
Don't watch the... Don't watch the...

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:23.506
Monsterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

01:13:26.786 --> 01:13:27.586
Just don't look!

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:31.088
Just don't look!

01:13:31.769 --> 01:13:32.629
Just don't look!

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:33.830
Just don't look!

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:37.031
It worked!

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:46.116
They're all dead!

01:13:46.316 --> 01:13:47.897
Well, except for Chubbsy Upsy over there.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:52.931
Rinku.

01:13:53.271 --> 01:13:54.292
Homer, stop looking!

01:13:54.412 --> 01:13:56.294
Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad.

01:13:56.794 --> 01:13:56.974
Oh.

01:14:02.139 --> 01:14:02.840
Here comes something.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.121
Remember the story.

01:14:04.341 --> 01:14:06.503
We're newlyweds on our way to Earth Capital.

01:14:08.405 --> 01:14:09.306
Oh, Shazbot.

01:14:09.346 --> 01:14:10.247
What time is it?

01:14:10.327 --> 01:14:11.068
Game time!

01:14:11.168 --> 01:14:11.268
Woo!

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:19.043
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

01:14:19.263 --> 01:14:23.945
Beware, we are being governed by scripted actors for a very, very long time.

01:14:23.985 --> 01:14:27.748
People were put in place, and these people are not real.

01:14:27.808 --> 01:14:29.208
They are characters on the stage.

01:14:29.248 --> 01:14:30.409
They are all part of the show.

01:14:30.969 --> 01:14:39.674
You might have been interacting with some of those people on the bottom or maybe in the second row, maybe even the third row, but that doesn't mean that you were actually interacting with anyone.

01:14:39.714 --> 01:14:44.617
In fact, that's the many layered, many, many, many layered

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:50.802
Lollapalooza of liars, if you will, that we are dealing with right now.

01:14:51.222 --> 01:15:00.969
Fifth Generation Warfare also, of course, extends to all of these health freedom movements and non-profit organizations that have sprung up as a result of this Fifth Generation Warfare.

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:02.370
That's how they do it.

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:06.533
And not everybody, in fact, most people probably don't understand what's going on.

01:15:07.033 --> 01:15:11.637
But only the people with the controls and with the access to the website or whatever

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:13.697
need to be in on the gag.

01:15:14.378 --> 01:15:15.498
It's about diluting.

01:15:16.038 --> 01:15:17.818
It's about absorbing.

01:15:18.558 --> 01:15:20.619
That's why Kevin McKernan exists.

01:15:21.499 --> 01:15:31.161
There is no other way to explain why the research and development director of the Human Genome Project was behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:31.201 --> 01:15:34.062
There's no other way to explain how Merrill Nass

01:15:34.682 --> 01:15:42.545
and Robert Malone were at his presidential announcement and hugged without words in front of the stage before the announcement.

01:15:42.885 --> 01:15:52.629
There's no other way to explain it other than these people being one of several national security actors behind the health freedom movement who fooled America and much of the world

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:55.491
using the help of social media.

01:15:55.931 --> 01:16:00.194
So this is what a national security theater looks like in 2025.

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.816
It is podcasts.

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:08.441
It is late night talk shows that summarize podcasts or claim to take a sample of things.

01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:10.622
And these people are not real actors.

01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:16.387
Watch Donald Trump whisper into the ear of Elon Musk saying, don't screw it up.

01:16:17.509 --> 01:16:25.234
Watch him whisper into Elon Musk's ear and watch how the jumping moron changes his attitude after this whisper.

01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:28.864
Oh, oh, oh, I better take this pretty seriously.

01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:29.625
I see.

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:31.305
Is it going to be okay?

01:16:31.366 --> 01:16:32.026
Is he mad at me?

01:16:32.486 --> 01:16:33.867
Oh, that's what I needed.

01:16:33.887 --> 01:16:34.167
Thanks.

01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:37.348
So this guy is the same kind of actor.

01:16:38.429 --> 01:16:40.910
And, you know, there are varying levels of read in.

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.351
I think Donald Trump is actually very well read in.

01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:45.432
He's a good friend of Hillary Clinton.

01:16:45.452 --> 01:16:52.176
He's been probably aware of his impending performance ever since that he was in that debate.

01:16:53.136 --> 01:16:55.299
This lady, of course, is ridiculous.

01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.604
It's fraud on this scale that can only be explained by scripted national security actors.

01:17:01.245 --> 01:17:05.490
If you watch videos of this woman, there's no way to take her seriously.

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:07.832
She has about as much

01:17:08.573 --> 01:17:12.516
you know, elder statesmanship experience as Barry Weiss.

01:17:12.737 --> 01:17:13.797
It's just kind of a joke.

01:17:14.218 --> 01:17:19.402
The only real carrying card that she has is that she's a surfer and she's been on Joe Rogan.

01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:21.584
I mean, it's a joke at this point.

01:17:21.724 --> 01:17:24.947
And that's what you see on this screen.

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:36.677
And if it was possible for you to open your mind long enough to understand that these people are scripted actors, and I want you to listen very carefully to that script, scripted actors.

01:17:37.048 --> 01:17:37.768
I don't know, man.

01:17:37.968 --> 01:17:40.869
I favor authenticity over a lot of other values.

01:17:40.909 --> 01:17:44.551
That doesn't mean I'm not sometimes duplicitous, disingenuous and dishonest.

01:17:44.591 --> 01:17:45.231
Of course I am.

01:17:45.271 --> 01:17:47.712
I'm fallen and I fall into dishonesty frequently.

01:17:47.732 --> 01:17:49.712
But today... I don't know, man.

01:17:49.912 --> 01:17:52.813
I favor authenticity over a lot of other values.

01:17:52.853 --> 01:17:56.495
That doesn't mean I'm not sometimes duplicitous, disingenuous and dishonest.

01:17:56.535 --> 01:17:57.175
Of course I am.

01:17:57.215 --> 01:17:59.656
I'm fallen and I fall into dishonesty frequently.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:17:59.996
But today...

01:18:00.936 --> 01:18:01.658
I don't know, man.

01:18:01.858 --> 01:18:04.764
I favor authenticity over a lot of other values.

01:18:04.804 --> 01:18:08.452
That doesn't mean I'm not sometimes duplicitous, disingenuous, and dishonest.

01:18:08.492 --> 01:18:09.133
Of course I am.

01:18:09.153 --> 01:18:11.618
I'm fallen, and I fall into dishonesty frequently.

01:18:11.638 --> 01:18:11.959
But today...

01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:15.331
And so yeah, that's where we are.

01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:18.992
Intramuscular injection is indeed dumb, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:27.874
Transfection is a crime and autism is a myth that all of these people have agreed to argue about on behalf of the national security state.

01:18:28.214 --> 01:18:38.177
And GigaOM Biological is part of the independent bright web, not part of the internet that's being used against you, but a free version of the internet where thought is being

01:18:39.317 --> 01:18:41.439
Crafted in real time, let's say it like that.

01:18:41.919 --> 01:18:42.960
I'm very happy to be here.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.302
I hope you're making the attempt to get off of social media.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:49.104
I'm just warning you, there's not much time left for me.

01:18:50.165 --> 01:18:57.931
I am still being an obnoxious person on X. I'm trying to call out these imposters for what they are.

01:18:59.172 --> 01:19:05.576
But soon I'm going to be off of X. And soon we will be only on the websites that we ourselves maintain.

01:19:06.677 --> 01:19:11.280
And we're gonna see what happens, because I think I gotta put my money where my mouth is.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:17.943
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:22.205
Virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:31.150
One of the fantastic things in my favor is the idea that very few, if anyone, has ever been able to say it as succinctly as me.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:41.959
That's what makes Giga Home Biological very different from a lot of the people that you might see and follow who are actually on a national security script because none of them will tell you to get off of social media.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:50.006
They might tell you which particular social media account to follow or what social media platform is the most free but none of them will tell you that none of them are.

01:19:50.467 --> 01:19:57.333
None of them will explain why the cheese is free there and none of them will tell you that Elon Musk is a scripted fraud or that

01:19:57.873 --> 01:20:02.377
that Jeff Bezos is a scripted fraud or that Peter Thiel is just kind of a joke.

01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:19.010
No one's gonna actually say that to you because they're all on the same script and this is the biology that they have to ignore because this biology exposes them for the frauds that they are independent of their also paying homage to all of these fake, you know, ruling elite

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:28.334
Just the whole idea that we've come to refer to a group of people on Earth as the ruling elite already shows you that we're almost enslaved already.

01:20:28.815 --> 01:20:30.075
And so we need to figure it out.

01:20:30.736 --> 01:20:32.637
We need to pull our collective heads out.

01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:33.857
That's for sure.

01:20:34.678 --> 01:20:37.399
That's for sure we need to pull our collective heads out.

01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:43.222
If there's one thing I know, that's what we need to do because the cheese is free for a reason on social media.

01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:46.564
Free for a reason is because it's a military weapon.

01:20:47.489 --> 01:20:54.473
They are actively using it against us, and they can actively use it against you in particular whenever they want to.

01:20:55.814 --> 01:20:56.654
Welcome to the show.

01:20:56.674 --> 01:21:01.337
It is Monday, so I guess you've started that week of hamster wheeling.

01:21:02.017 --> 01:21:04.898
And so I hope this is a pleasant surprise.

01:21:05.139 --> 01:21:06.719
1 minute and 20 into the show.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.161
Still got a good half hour for you here.

01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:16.545
I think I got a little bit over my skis with regard to how much I can accomplish, but I'm just going to try and see what I can do.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:23.952
Again fifth generation warfare is not just the health freedom movement, but it's everything and that's the

01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:28.158
Sounds like a big gross-over generalization, but it's really not.

01:21:28.238 --> 01:21:28.898
It's really not.

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:39.724
Social media gives us the illusion that we can interact with a script and interact with a group of people on a sitcom or on a Star Trek episode, but that's not how social media works.

01:21:40.304 --> 01:21:53.692
Social media is the Star Trek episode that makes us believe that politics is real, that international relations are real, that the scandals around Donald Trump are real, and all of these people are in on it.

01:21:54.392 --> 01:22:01.001
I know it sounds nuts, but a lot of these people on this screen have had long-term relationships with one another.

01:22:01.021 --> 01:22:09.912
And the relationships belie a level of trust that can't exist with money alone.

01:22:10.953 --> 01:22:15.676
I thought this was an interesting thing to play at the beginning of the stream.

01:22:15.736 --> 01:22:20.678
I hope it's all very obvious to you that it's not advertising that we're worried about here.

01:22:20.698 --> 01:22:21.519
It's social media.

01:22:21.559 --> 01:22:30.503
Why are we allowing social media and these podcasters to undermine our democracy, to undermine our ability to understand what's going on?

01:22:30.563 --> 01:22:31.644
Why are we allowing that?

01:22:32.424 --> 01:22:34.685
That's really the question in my mind.

01:22:36.306 --> 01:22:47.321
I think what's cool about Mark Hulak's work, and I'm going to claim just a tiny little bit of credit here because I did start the wheels turning with Mark a few weeks ago.

01:22:47.802 --> 01:22:51.307
He's always been on Bannon, and he's always known lots of things that I didn't know.

01:22:53.449 --> 01:23:11.948
But we were talking one morning on the phone and I pointed out to him when we I think it was we were he was talking about Kathy Griffin and the head or maybe I said that Kathy Griffin was the one with the head and Then I said yeah, and then there was also Snoop Dogg who did this music video that had a gun with a flag that came out of it and

01:23:12.689 --> 01:23:30.716
And so I do think that the connection between those two was just a random search with terms based on that random conversation between him and I about where Trump derangement syndrome came from and whether it was more than just Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert scripted to drive people nuts.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.137
Was it also people on The View?

01:23:32.177 --> 01:23:36.038
It turns out that, of course, she's worked with a lot of these people for a long time.

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:36.878
It goes way back.

01:23:38.919 --> 01:23:45.564
And the connections that Mark has uncovered from a Hollywood perspective is really remarkable.

01:23:46.524 --> 01:24:00.133
But again, remember just for very rudimentary purposes, given the fact that this screen has been something that I've been using for a few weeks now at least, why I chose a lot of these people.

01:24:02.455 --> 01:24:07.498
Charlie Kirk was on this screen for a few weeks before the shooting actually happened.

01:24:08.038 --> 01:24:11.841
I mean, Snoop Dogg, all this, this composition was all done for a while now.

01:24:11.901 --> 01:24:18.665
And the reason why is because there are some connections here between Weinstein and Bannon.

01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:32.905
Like all of these weird connections that go back too far and for too long to too big of piles of money, too large of corporations with too much influence and output to be by chance.

01:24:33.065 --> 01:24:44.734
Again, because you do not become the CEO of a $150 million film company for nothing just because somebody decides that you're a pretty good guy.

01:24:44.794 --> 01:24:46.616
I like your conversation at the water.

01:24:47.076 --> 01:24:50.018
You know, by the way, we're looking for somebody to run this big,

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.842
That's not how this happens.

01:24:54.104 --> 01:24:56.287
That's not how an aircraft carrier works.

01:24:56.307 --> 01:24:56.848
Hey, dude.

01:24:57.389 --> 01:24:59.151
Hey, you over there with the brown shoes.

01:24:59.752 --> 01:25:00.674
Why don't you come over here?

01:25:00.714 --> 01:25:01.635
I got a job for you.

01:25:01.695 --> 01:25:04.840
That's not how an aircraft carrier is run.

01:25:07.731 --> 01:25:25.426
And you need to see the American security apparatus as an aircraft carrier that includes the entire Lollapalooza of liars on social media and that visit mainstream media and represent the functioning behemoth.

01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:31.074
And so just like an aircraft carrier, everybody has their job.

01:25:31.114 --> 01:25:34.435
And when you sign up to be on an aircraft carrier, you accept that.

01:25:35.195 --> 01:25:44.538
If you sign up to work on a submarine, you don't think that you're going to get on the submarine and then be able to bitch about what you're doing or complain about what you have to do or the schedule that you're given.

01:25:47.439 --> 01:26:07.458
Just like the military because it was basically a military operation these people don't question the schedule or the script that they are given when their numbers called it's called and They go on stage and recite the lines that they are given as even if it's just handed to them right before the curtains open That's what you need to understand

01:26:08.447 --> 01:26:10.828
And Snoop Dogg signed up a long time ago.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.590
Kathy Griffin very willingly signed up.

01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:18.172
You have to understand that an actor would gladly sign up for that.

01:26:20.394 --> 01:26:32.100
If somebody came to an actor in Hollywood struggling and waiting tables and said, hey, we're looking for somebody with your build and your eyes and your hair and your voice to do a podcast.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.663
And since I'm the guy who produced Seinfeld, you never know where this will go.

01:26:39.025 --> 01:26:41.347
Hey, you know, you're trying to start an ad agency.

01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:43.068
Why don't you start a podcast, you know?

01:26:43.088 --> 01:26:48.592
I'm friends with Peter Thiel and I have a, you know, one up on this.

01:26:49.593 --> 01:26:50.653
You could get called up.

01:26:50.713 --> 01:26:51.834
It could be a really big thing.

01:26:51.894 --> 01:26:58.219
It's a really easy way to audition for better positions in the structure of things.

01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:03.411
So everybody's aware, you just have to get in.

01:27:03.431 --> 01:27:06.532
You gotta get your SAG card first, then you gotta be on set.

01:27:06.992 --> 01:27:08.692
You gotta get noticed, you know what I mean?

01:27:08.732 --> 01:27:10.513
And that's no different.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:21.715
Except the national security state has a little bit higher requirements and better and more stringent siphon or sieve for what they keep and don't keep.

01:27:22.255 --> 01:27:24.595
But essentially, these people have been put in place.

01:27:25.275 --> 01:27:28.116
Some of them have been groomed for years and years and years.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:32.740
You should see it that way because this is for all the marbles.

01:27:33.841 --> 01:27:41.085
You're not going to leave the 2,000 plus jobs necessary to make an aircraft carrier run efficiently.

01:27:41.105 --> 01:27:44.607
You're not going to leave those jobs to the first 2,000 applicants.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:51.491
And you're not turning those jobs over all the time or an aircraft carrier is never going to be projecting any power.

01:27:51.511 --> 01:27:53.252
Do you see what I'm trying to get at here?

01:27:53.272 --> 01:27:56.594
I hope this analogy is hitting home because this is the truth.

01:28:03.559 --> 01:28:05.360
Oh, I don't know what I needed to do there, sorry.

01:28:06.121 --> 01:28:07.482
That was just my music, I guess.

01:28:08.943 --> 01:28:11.284
So, these two guys go back to the Man Show.

01:28:11.364 --> 01:28:26.275
That's also something that Mark Hulak was able to find just because... All of these people are connected via Joe Rogan, via the Health Freedom Movement, or one way or another behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or some version of the Health Freedom Movement in another country around the world.

01:28:26.695 --> 01:28:28.036
And that's not by chance.

01:28:28.596 --> 01:28:32.339
The long connection that Mar has to this is not by chance.

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:41.529
And so these other people could be handled by entirely different handlers and believe most of the things they're saying.

01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:53.019
But at the core is a group of people that doesn't take Donald Trump seriously because they know that Donald Trump is on the same team as Hillary Clinton was, whatever team that is.

01:28:54.244 --> 01:28:55.245
That's the trick here.

01:28:55.605 --> 01:28:57.607
That's the main trick to understand.

01:28:57.727 --> 01:29:03.331
Because they understand that truth, then they don't have to worry about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:05.773
or Jay Bhattacharya or the vaccine schedule.

01:29:06.194 --> 01:29:11.278
They just have to improvise along the script they already understand.

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:21.195
And that is that there is a show happening and the loud noises that are made over there, I'm supposed to pay attention to and complain about.

01:29:21.215 --> 01:29:25.096
And that's all that's necessary to participate in this theater.

01:29:25.576 --> 01:29:31.478
And once you have cleared the level of audition and you're given a little bit of a role in the script,

01:29:31.918 --> 01:29:43.348
Then the directors and the stage managers can shift stuff around as is necessary including move you into the front of stage or move you back of stage or take you out of the show completely.

01:29:43.388 --> 01:29:46.111
It doesn't matter because this is how it works.

01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:57.918
And so the health freedom movement is, you fell for it whether you think Joe Rogan is smart or not.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.883
You fell for it whether you think Joe Rogan is funny or not.

01:30:00.923 --> 01:30:03.787
You fell for it whether you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:03.847 --> 01:30:04.969
is a fraud or a hero.

01:30:04.989 --> 01:30:05.670
You fell for it.

01:30:06.647 --> 01:30:08.288
Please understand that.

01:30:08.728 --> 01:30:13.830
You're not absolved from any responsibility if you knew all along that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.611
was just a brainworm victim and an idiot.

01:30:16.931 --> 01:30:32.558
You're not absolved of this if you understand that Russell Brand is an idiot and a fake and an actor because you still accept the left using these people to represent the conservative side of America.

01:30:32.598 --> 01:30:33.698
Do you see that problem?

01:30:34.198 --> 01:30:35.439
Do you see the problem there?

01:30:38.442 --> 01:30:56.919
If you know that these people are fake, then you have to condemn all of the other stuff on social media that uses these people to represent us, to represent a right or a conservative movement in America.

01:30:56.999 --> 01:31:03.344
All of these things only exist because the left in concert agrees that these people are it.

01:31:06.388 --> 01:31:17.408
when we know that that's not a real woman from Hawaii who's a Hindu and got on Joe Rogan and is now the Director of National Intelligence.

01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:46.762
We know, I know for sure that those guys over there are not real FDA commissioners or NIH directors or HHS secretaries because I've spoken at length with all of them and they are all vapid individuals that are only looking to stay away from saying anything of report, anything of substance because they knew all along they were being set up.

01:31:48.854 --> 01:31:49.935
This is just an actor.

01:31:50.275 --> 01:31:51.095
This is an actor.

01:31:51.316 --> 01:31:52.096
This is an actor.

01:31:52.316 --> 01:31:53.017
That's an actor.

01:31:53.357 --> 01:31:54.037
That's an actor.

01:31:54.377 --> 01:31:55.098
That's an actor.

01:31:55.538 --> 01:31:56.759
Lex Friedman is an actor.

01:31:57.099 --> 01:31:57.920
This is an actor.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:58.820
That's an actor.

01:31:59.401 --> 01:32:00.701
These are all actors.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:04.264
It's just a question of what level on which are they acting.

01:32:05.143 --> 01:32:06.964
What stage are they choosing to do?

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:15.591
Just because you don't get a big stage on Rumble doesn't mean that they can't bring you on as an opening act or let you play a song with them.

01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:19.054
You know, like they do with old musicians that have crashed out.

01:32:19.094 --> 01:32:25.178
You might bring an old, you know, you could bring Jerry Garcia on to play one Grateful Dead song or something like that.

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:32.244
And so all of that kind of shit is pulled with these people on the internet that makes them seem like something real happening.

01:32:32.984 --> 01:32:44.213
some kind of discussion is occurring where a real you know debate is occurring and that's all orchestrated national security bullshit and the only real

01:32:46.534 --> 01:32:56.805
One man show on the internet that's covering this besides me, I think, is, well, I don't know, Mark Kulak of Usatonic ITS and Joe Marshall.

01:32:56.885 --> 01:32:57.906
Basically, that's it.

01:32:58.607 --> 01:33:01.610
And I don't know of anyone who can say it like I can say it.

01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:03.612
So I'm very excited to be here.

01:33:03.632 --> 01:33:06.916
I'm very excited to have the support of you guys out there.

01:33:06.936 --> 01:33:08.958
I'm very happy with how PeerTube is working.

01:33:09.658 --> 01:33:17.241
We're going to advance that ball as much as we possibly can over the next couple months to set up a few independent peer tubes for a few other people.

01:33:17.661 --> 01:33:20.642
We're just looking to get all of the necessary legal stuff ready to go.

01:33:20.722 --> 01:33:24.984
Don't forget that we still say it better than anybody, intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:33:26.284 --> 01:33:28.747
Transfection of healthy humans was always a crime.

01:33:28.867 --> 01:33:31.910
RNA cannot pandemic and autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:33:32.831 --> 01:33:36.115
We are here by design because they saw this signal coming for a long time.

01:33:36.135 --> 01:33:38.998
It's an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

01:33:39.058 --> 01:33:41.301
Ladies and gentlemen, let me add a little sound effects there.

01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:52.896
And that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is what they sculpted with Murder and Lies for a couple years and lied about it on TV with the help of all those people on the previous screen and much, much more.

01:33:53.317 --> 01:33:56.842
And that is because America is run by this false two-party theater.

01:33:57.262 --> 01:33:58.964
It's not even just one party.

01:33:59.935 --> 01:34:15.501
It is just one group of individuals, all of them rich and influential, tied to other large piles of money like corporations and non-profits that are all vying for control of power as the United States is bled dry.

01:34:15.921 --> 01:34:21.583
And anybody that's rising into clear view is not somebody that's also driving the frickin' boat.

01:34:23.308 --> 01:34:29.029
They're not putting the guy who's driving the aircraft carrier on podcasts.

01:34:29.849 --> 01:34:31.950
They're not putting the captain on podcasts.

01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:44.632
They're sending a very low-ranking officer from the communications department, at best, maybe the mess hall, to talk to the press.

01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:48.193
Because the aircraft carrier is still doing its job.

01:34:57.014 --> 01:35:11.239
And so I showed you the other day that this guy, for example, The Diary of a CEO podcast is a multi-million dollar, 50 man, 50 employee organization.

01:35:11.299 --> 01:35:15.740
So this is ruled by podcast actor and these people have been put in place.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.681
And if this guy, this Englishman,

01:35:19.241 --> 01:35:35.312
has 50 employees from a podcast, then I think you need to come to terms with the fact that the US military or the NATO military or whatever organization is behind this or organizations realized a long time ago that this is chump change.

01:35:35.732 --> 01:35:41.736
If it takes only 50 people to produce something like this, then we should produce a lot of some things like this.

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:48.581
In other words, a Lollapalooza of liars, a very good rock bands, very good, you know, costumes, very good,

01:35:49.242 --> 01:35:51.221
Jams, very good bass lines.

01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:59.117
And all different ones, you know, hardcore rockers like this dude that swears a lot and takes his shirt off by the pool.

01:35:59.177 --> 01:36:09.566
Or somebody like Russell Brand that's got all kinds of nice necklaces and funny tattoos and stuff, you know, like a Hindu elephant on one arm and a crucifix on the other arm.

01:36:09.886 --> 01:36:13.129
Or this guy who will tell you all about Kevin McKernan being super smart.

01:36:13.169 --> 01:36:19.295
You know, the Human Genome Project Research and Development Director that's curiously behind the anti-vax movement.

01:36:20.015 --> 01:36:39.066
And nobody in American media seems to care about that one simple fact that there is a guy who actually was an employee of the Whitehead Institute, a colleague of Mark Lander, a long colleague of Francis Collins, directly behind as a scientific advisor to CHD throughout the pandemic.

01:36:39.106 --> 01:36:40.406
His name is Kevin McKernan.

01:36:40.827 --> 01:36:48.611
He's been on several podcasts, including a large podcast that is run by a guy by the name of Danny Jones, has a direct connections to Hulk Hogan.

01:36:51.018 --> 01:37:11.256
who is of course the guy that Peter Thiel gave lawyers to so that he could sue Gawker for having published a sex video of Hulk Hogan, but he was really trying to get back at Gawker because Gawker outed Peter Thiel as a gay man.

01:37:14.130 --> 01:37:28.879
And so this guy was on that Danny Jones podcast with Callie Means and Mary Talley Bowden, probably doing a fake argument between Callie Means to fool Mary Talley Bowden into believing that she was still part of a real health freedom movement.

01:37:29.279 --> 01:37:39.205
And a lot of the doctors that are involved simply aren't sophisticated enough from a scientific perspective to understand because they've been shielded by social media.

01:37:39.265 --> 01:37:42.467
They've been shielded by these other people from ever hearing from me.

01:37:43.817 --> 01:37:46.960
Mary Talley Bowden was on my show in 2022.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:47.720
Think about that.

01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:50.683
And now she won't talk to me anymore.

01:37:50.983 --> 01:37:51.924
How is that possible?

01:37:52.124 --> 01:37:53.805
Because of people like this.

01:37:54.065 --> 01:37:54.566
So listen.

01:37:58.109 --> 01:38:00.711
We are joined with, I think a new guest.

01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:02.773
Dan, I don't think I've ever had you on this show.

01:38:02.933 --> 01:38:03.493
Dan Cohen.

01:38:04.054 --> 01:38:04.614
How you doing, man?

01:38:04.634 --> 01:38:05.115
You doing okay?

01:38:05.695 --> 01:38:06.576
I'm good, I'm good.

01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:07.757
How is that possible?

01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:09.947
How can you start a show?

01:38:10.027 --> 01:38:11.648
I don't think I've ever had you on.

01:38:12.248 --> 01:38:23.855
I'm sorry, but there's no amount of interviewing you could do and not know whether you had somebody on your podcast for an interview and still know them.

01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:26.056
Do you see my point?

01:38:26.076 --> 01:38:29.018
So what he's giving away is that they've known each other for a while.

01:38:29.458 --> 01:38:30.979
He's been on Twitter for a while.

01:38:31.039 --> 01:38:34.441
He does very well for himself on Twitter for a while.

01:38:35.529 --> 01:38:40.811
and they've known each other for a while, and he's gotta say, I don't know if I've ever had you on my podcast before.

01:38:41.891 --> 01:38:50.635
Think about that and me saying that about someone would imply that we knew each other, but I just haven't had you on before.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.955
We talk all the time, but I haven't had you on before.

01:38:53.756 --> 01:38:59.618
You see, I can't remember the last time, Mark Kulak, when I had you on my podcast, but I have had you on.

01:39:01.238 --> 01:39:02.379
That's not what he said.

01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:06.351
And I think that's pretty significant.

01:39:06.371 --> 01:39:13.256
I think it's an admission that they've known each other for a long time, which means that getting on this podcast wasn't really that big of a deal.

01:39:13.276 --> 01:39:18.681
Um, and in fact, uh, is just part of a, you know, that's how the plan works.

01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:19.301
I've never been.

01:39:19.881 --> 01:39:22.143
We are joined with, I think a new guest.

01:39:22.263 --> 01:39:24.585
I don't, Dan, I don't think I've ever had you on this show.

01:39:24.705 --> 01:39:25.266
Dan Cohen.

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:26.386
How you doing, man?

01:39:26.406 --> 01:39:26.887
You doing okay.

01:39:27.467 --> 01:39:27.807
I'm good.

01:39:27.847 --> 01:39:28.148
I'm good.

01:39:28.288 --> 01:39:29.689
Uh, just, um,

01:39:30.188 --> 01:39:31.189
Yeah, getting my morning going.

01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:32.209
I've never been on.

01:39:32.529 --> 01:39:34.010
It's a pleasure to be on with you.

01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:36.331
Well, it's a pleasure to have you, which is a give you a moaning donut.

01:39:37.212 --> 01:39:38.853
Dan Coyne, journalist, filmmaker.

01:39:39.613 --> 01:39:49.898
He has contributed to Al Jazeera, English, Alternate, Electronic, Infotata, Rayzone, Middle East, I, Mondewise, The Nation, Vice News, Mint Press.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.301
You've been around, to put it mildly.

01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:55.681
You have been around.

01:39:56.961 --> 01:39:57.642
Let me ask you this.

01:39:58.022 --> 01:40:08.524
I didn't hit, there's a tweet that you responded to and I kind of want to dig into the tweet because I'm interested in this aspect of Charlie Kirk's death.

01:40:09.824 --> 01:40:17.406
I've been fascinated by the way each side has been trying to use him as a cudgel to hit the other side.

01:40:18.306 --> 01:40:19.746
It's almost like there wasn't a real person.

01:40:20.546 --> 01:40:23.387
That a lot of what has been put out has been this kind of

01:40:24.329 --> 01:40:26.850
deification or desecration.

01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:33.654
And depending upon the side that you're on, using that club to beat the head of the other side.

01:40:34.354 --> 01:40:35.094
It is very weird.

01:40:35.114 --> 01:40:35.995
It's very strange.

01:40:36.795 --> 01:40:44.739
The images that they've come out with Jesus taking Kurt, Charlie Kurt away to somewhere, like all of this stuff is very strange.

01:40:44.819 --> 01:40:45.620
It's very bizarre.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.781
Um, let's start there for Bill.

01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:52.181
Give me a take on this and just to give reference point.

01:40:52.481 --> 01:40:52.882
It was this.

01:40:53.182 --> 01:41:06.805
So this video is before, um, Charlie Kirk's, uh, whatever that happened yesterday, which of course would, would make everything that had made everything that happened before pretty, pretty tame.

01:41:07.345 --> 01:41:11.946
Um, anyway, that you were responding to from Sarah bills.

01:41:14.218 --> 01:41:19.582
So here we go talking about a tweet, and that being a conversation that people should pay attention to, i.e.

01:41:19.662 --> 01:41:23.645
there is a relevant thing there on social media, which I don't agree with, but okay.

01:41:23.965 --> 01:41:24.206
Right here.

01:41:25.006 --> 01:41:30.991
It says, Sarah says, why was Charlie giving multiple members of the Trump administration his quote, final wishes before he died?

01:41:31.471 --> 01:41:33.172
First Miller, now Noam.

01:41:34.013 --> 01:41:36.535
And you point out, he says, because they're following the same script.

01:41:37.135 --> 01:41:41.499
Once you see that they're national security state actors, then you can't unsee it.

01:41:42.352 --> 01:41:46.694
We are governed by highly paid liars via cable TV, social media, and podcasts.

01:41:47.355 --> 01:41:51.296
And just to be clear, Sarah wasn't saying that he knew he was going to die.

01:41:51.617 --> 01:42:00.641
His point was, how are all of these people all of a sudden bringing this up as if I was the last person to talk to Charlie and Charlie told me X or Y?

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:02.182
Break down your comment for me.

01:42:06.055 --> 01:42:17.784
I think that right here, a friend of mine would say that I have a very good friend of mine named Jonathan Cooey, who puts it better than me when he says that we are governed by podcast.

01:42:19.306 --> 01:42:23.489
He called, he came up with this national security state actor phrase.

01:42:23.929 --> 01:42:27.192
And I think it's a really apt way to describe what these people are.

01:42:27.793 --> 01:42:28.033
But

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.362
Just saying you could right there already just say, you know, it's not just me.

01:42:35.462 --> 01:42:53.368
It's a lot of people So my comment that these are national security state actors, I mean well Sarah firstly was pointing out that the Homeland Security Secretary what's her name the former governor of

01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:57.032
of like, no, yeah, Christie know him.

01:42:57.312 --> 01:42:57.573
Yeah.

01:42:57.833 --> 01:42:59.894
Um, and then, and then who was the other one?

01:42:59.974 --> 01:43:01.534
JD van, who was, who was the other person?

01:43:01.554 --> 01:43:03.155
She was, it was, let me see.

01:43:03.775 --> 01:43:06.377
It was Christie gnome and it was Miller.

01:43:06.697 --> 01:43:08.038
Um, Steven Miller, of course.

01:43:08.358 --> 01:43:08.558
Yeah.

01:43:09.058 --> 01:43:12.900
Um, both said that he, uh, um,

01:43:13.971 --> 01:43:19.472
that, sorry, I have to switch my brain from a completely different subject that I was just working on.

01:43:19.852 --> 01:43:33.494
Both said that Charlie Kirk had told them in, you know, right before he was killed, that he was, you know, we need to crack down on the terrorist left, things like that.

01:43:33.514 --> 01:43:43.076
That's not an exact quote, but which is obvious, you know, fodder for for just right wing

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:50.643
Um, you know, everyone, the kind of narrative that the left is crazy and they celebrate killing and we need to crack down on them.

01:43:50.703 --> 01:43:54.945
And, you know, and they're not only they celebrate killing, but, but, you know, they're killers even.

01:43:55.886 --> 01:44:04.130
Um, and that, so what my point and Sarah said, look, they're saying the same thing, which is very strange.

01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:10.333
And she clarified, I'm not saying that Charlie Kirk knew he was going to die, but it's strange that they're both saying this.

01:44:10.513 --> 01:44:12.814
And my point is, yes, these are,

01:44:13.608 --> 01:44:15.577
These people are scripted.

01:44:16.414 --> 01:44:20.336
they are saying that for a very specific political reason.

01:44:21.577 --> 01:44:31.882
Kristi Noem was put in that position, you know, if you look at she's like a she's a grandmother, but she got like a nice haircut, got like plastic surgery, got Botox.

01:44:31.942 --> 01:44:33.523
Kristi Noem is a grandmother?

01:44:33.883 --> 01:44:34.143
Yes.

01:44:34.904 --> 01:44:35.184
Yeah.

01:44:35.764 --> 01:44:36.885
And yeah, exactly.

01:44:36.925 --> 01:44:39.046
She's, you know, she's an older lady.

01:44:39.486 --> 01:44:43.528
I mean, she's into her 60s, I believe.

01:44:44.029 --> 01:44:44.669
I had no idea.

01:44:45.714 --> 01:44:46.599
Yeah, I had no idea.

01:44:47.022 --> 01:44:49.054
And they made her kind of like, you know,

01:44:50.512 --> 01:44:52.413
Hot, quote unquote.

01:44:52.433 --> 01:45:09.598
They tried to make her look physically attractive and put her in this position as Homeland Security for this theater where she goes out with ICE agents and cracks down on criminals and does all these appearances on social media in particular.

01:45:10.038 --> 01:45:12.078
Stephen Miller is saying the same thing.

01:45:12.458 --> 01:45:16.820
So this is clearly a script that went out.

01:45:18.524 --> 01:45:23.052
My point is I think actually a fundamental thing that people need to understand.

01:45:23.072 --> 01:45:26.538
Yeah, you can see like, you know, that she's 60.

01:45:27.139 --> 01:45:30.404
She's I mean, we can look up exactly Christy gnome age.

01:45:32.397 --> 01:45:32.617
She's 53.

01:45:33.437 --> 01:45:34.318
So she's not she's not 60.

01:45:35.659 --> 01:45:36.639
But she is a grandmother.

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.201
Um, she looks good for 53.

01:45:39.301 --> 01:45:39.541
Jesus.

01:45:39.621 --> 01:45:39.942
Yeah.

01:45:40.342 --> 01:45:51.870
But I mean, if you look at pictures of her, like from before, if you look up Christie gnome, like age, you can find pictures of her from before where she looks much more plain, like home.

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:52.650
She looks her age.

01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:54.351
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:45:54.711 --> 01:45:56.593
But you know, and she got plastic surgery.

01:45:56.693 --> 01:46:01.376
Clearly, she got like, clearly does like Botox, you know, lip enhancements, these kind of things.

01:46:02.436 --> 01:46:04.157
That's not just because of vanity.

01:46:04.297 --> 01:46:19.305
That's because they're trying to market her for, you know, kind of conservative audiences to bring them in to this whole like MAGA farm support Trump.

01:46:19.845 --> 01:46:29.630
So, you know, having like a good looking older woman to go and do these appearances on social media where she's out there with the ICE agents getting the criminals, this kind of thing.

01:46:30.205 --> 01:46:32.428
That is all propaganda.

01:46:33.489 --> 01:46:37.193
And it's a theater is how I describe it, national security state theater.

01:46:37.934 --> 01:46:46.865
And really, this is the main thing that I think people on all sides of the political spectrum have to understand.

01:46:47.515 --> 01:46:55.938
about social media, we just assume that, you know, like, yeah, they're like social media is pretty normal.

01:46:55.978 --> 01:46:59.980
Like we have our X accounts, we have our whatever, Instagram, whatever you use.

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:07.763
I mean, in particular, you know, a lot of people I think who are in journalism, who are in our spheres, use X in particular.

01:47:09.455 --> 01:47:37.815
but and we are kind of under this sort of illusion that there is some amount there's free speech or some amount or it was censored but Elon restored it even if we don't really like Elon this politics now we have free speech because a lot of the people who were banned you know were brought back and you know what is he laughing about there it's so weird oh it's a place of free exchange and all these things when in reality

01:47:38.772 --> 01:48:03.024
It is, not only is this a corporate platform, it is military-grade social engineering made to, where it is, where there is a lot of inorganic activity and scripted national security state actors that are

01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:12.558
difficult to identify and that are put in place to rise at certain points in order to kind of steer

01:48:15.396 --> 01:48:18.279
how people think in order to engineer their mind.

01:48:18.719 --> 01:48:24.364
Because the most important thing is this little, our consciousness, that's what they're really fighting for.

01:48:24.724 --> 01:48:32.211
How we think, how we perceive reality, and then that determines what we do with our day-to-day on a day-to-day basis.

01:48:32.591 --> 01:48:33.512
And so it's funny, right?

01:48:33.552 --> 01:48:37.796
Because what he could say is, is that I've got this friend named Jonathan Cooey who

01:48:38.576 --> 01:48:52.933
learned this because he realized that the entire anti-vax movement was full of actors like this who just kind of populate these conferences and these non-profits to make it seem like there's a legitimate health freedom movement when actually their whole

01:48:53.573 --> 01:48:59.216
real rhetoric is controlled and they're used as part of this limited spectrum of debate.

01:48:59.576 --> 01:49:03.118
And he got involved because he really thought there was a fight going on.

01:49:03.158 --> 01:49:05.439
And as a biologist, he exposed it.

01:49:05.539 --> 01:49:08.020
So I'm interested to see when that actually happens.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:15.063
So the thing is, the more we get good, quote unquote, at social media,

01:49:23.294 --> 01:49:29.798
the more we build a big following and we feel like we're interacting with

01:49:32.571 --> 01:49:44.659
important people, maybe some journalist who you used to really look up to, and all of a sudden they're favoriting and retweeting your posts, and maybe you're DMing with them.

01:49:44.719 --> 01:49:47.861
A lot of that is so incredibly easy to manipulate.

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.863
For example, I'll give an example.

01:49:51.844 --> 01:49:53.005
The account Syrian Girl,

01:49:54.026 --> 01:50:11.865
Maram Sousley, she's Australian-Syrian, she said, well, Charlie Kirk followed me recently on X, and that is proof that he was changing his position on Israel.

01:50:12.757 --> 01:50:18.541
Now, Charlie, and that went viral, that got like several thousand retweets and many more likes.

01:50:19.842 --> 01:50:23.684
Charlie Kirk follows like, I think it was like 185,000 people on Twitter.

01:50:24.024 --> 01:50:29.228
I just follow is like literally anything.

01:50:29.668 --> 01:50:29.808
Yeah.

01:50:33.297 --> 01:50:38.920
So number one, if that is somehow meaningful, I just don't see it.

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:41.562
I think that's at best, I would say wishful thinking.

01:50:42.082 --> 01:50:43.563
Yeah, it's her point of view.

01:50:43.583 --> 01:50:44.484
It's like her little window.

01:50:44.944 --> 01:50:45.164
Right.

01:50:45.584 --> 01:50:55.190
And secondly, Or you could see it as somebody who understands that everybody he follows will see everything that he tweets because social media is programmed to his benefit.

01:50:56.533 --> 01:50:59.215
That might be the reason why you would follow that many people.

01:50:59.315 --> 01:51:07.162
Not because you want to see what those people respond, but because you've been told that the programming algorithm has been gamed for you.

01:51:07.742 --> 01:51:10.865
And so everybody that you follow will see everything that you tweet.

01:51:10.985 --> 01:51:18.712
So, you know, put your staff on it and realize that you're gathering people that will see every radio signal that you send out.

01:51:19.252 --> 01:51:21.773
because they've gamed social media for you, all right?

01:51:22.253 --> 01:51:23.793
Here we go, a deal.

01:51:24.273 --> 01:51:37.536
And so they're trying to pretend that that's some kind of evidence that something fake was going on instead of evidence that it was somebody who was actively participating in the militarization of social media against the American public.

01:51:37.576 --> 01:51:38.836
Do you see the problem here?

01:51:39.316 --> 01:51:40.936
There's still need to tweak it.

01:51:41.156 --> 01:51:44.837
Especially, you know, bigger figures like Charlie Kirk.

01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:54.577
they're not spending all day, like a lot of social media users who are really good at X, they're not spending all their time on social media.

01:51:54.637 --> 01:51:55.998
He's like a political actor.

01:51:56.078 --> 01:52:00.601
He's flying here and running Turning Points USA or this kind of thing.

01:52:01.882 --> 01:52:04.183
So there are people that manage those accounts.

01:52:04.864 --> 01:52:12.189
So there's no indication that Charlie Kirk himself, it was Charlie Kirk's account

01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:26.806
could be run by literally anybody, could be run by... I'm not really sure Dan has ever said any of this kind of skeptic position of social media before and say that you don't know who's DMing you or liking your tweets.

01:52:27.347 --> 01:52:29.769
I really feel like that's my message and

01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:34.013
Before me, there hasn't been anybody in his ear saying it.

01:52:34.053 --> 01:52:36.595
So it's strange to me up until this point.

01:52:36.655 --> 01:52:38.037
I hope we're gonna get a shout out.

01:52:38.057 --> 01:52:41.119
His assistant, his hired social media intern.

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:45.463
It could be run by somebody directly working in the national security state.

01:52:46.064 --> 01:52:54.811
And this is the kind of thing where it's like, oh, Charlie... It means skilled social media user if you're really good at X. That's what it means, skilled social media use.

01:52:54.991 --> 01:52:56.693
He's basically paraphrasing that.

01:52:58.584 --> 01:53:00.787
He must be having some kind of change.

01:53:02.148 --> 01:53:08.395
So this is the point that I'm trying to make, is that all of these platforms

01:53:09.073 --> 01:53:13.778
not only X, TikTok, Facebook, you know, they're for different generations.

01:53:13.838 --> 01:53:16.360
Now it's like boomers who use Facebook.

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:22.946
It's like a lot of kids who use TikTok and, you know, like, I don't know, Instagram and, and YouTube.

01:53:23.246 --> 01:53:28.011
And Rumble is now the like alternative platform, you know, but Rumble is like,

01:53:28.611 --> 01:53:51.747
Another one that this is you know, you can have they can make certain podcasts or shows rise To be you know, all of a sudden you're getting 10, you know You're the one that's out front to get tens of thousands of viewers or whatever, you know live So all of this is basically an invented reality in many ways and it's very difficult.

01:53:51.827 --> 01:53:54.829
It's like WWE or WWF we're like

01:53:55.939 --> 01:53:59.481
you know, it's how do we know what's fake and what's real?

01:53:59.762 --> 01:54:04.485
Like, it's scripted, but there are things that are happening that are real, but but we don't know.

01:54:04.925 --> 01:54:09.268
And the overwhelming majority of social media users do not understand

01:54:10.296 --> 01:54:13.038
the level to which it is, it is scripted.

01:54:13.659 --> 01:54:26.650
And these political actors and political of the single uniparty that rules this country are, these people are following scripts.

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:34.897
The national security state is thinking generations ahead in its plans of what it wants to do.

01:54:35.777 --> 01:54:41.000
you and I are reacting to the news on a daily basis of what's happening.

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:45.383
We are not understanding there is a major long-term agenda.

01:54:47.064 --> 01:54:49.806
And the big question, of course, what are those agendas?

01:54:49.826 --> 01:54:51.927
And that's a huge question.

01:54:52.007 --> 01:54:55.529
But my point is social media is their terrain.

01:54:55.649 --> 01:54:56.630
It is their theater.

01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:57.911
It is their matrix.

01:54:58.231 --> 01:54:59.292
It is not ours.

01:54:59.412 --> 01:55:01.333
And it is not a public square that

01:55:02.065 --> 01:55:08.608
You know, they just kind of bought and are making money off of any form of controlling our minds.

01:55:09.909 --> 01:55:10.729
Yeah.

01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:12.070
I used to be a software engineer.

01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:14.311
I was a software engineer for like 10 years.

01:55:16.212 --> 01:55:22.856
Any platform that there's a layer of code between you and that platform, I can control.

01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:35.073
And I say that to say, whether you have sock puppet accounts, whether you have certain algorithms that push certain things over other things, those things are manipulated or can be manipulated.

01:55:35.453 --> 01:55:44.035
And I'm talking about, and Dan should be talking about scripted actors that don't need any manipulation other than for everybody to see them.

01:55:45.095 --> 01:55:46.356
That's what we're talking about.

01:55:46.396 --> 01:55:48.276
There's no programming involved in that.

01:55:49.201 --> 01:55:57.507
If everybody that Charlie Kirk follows is programmed to see whatever Charlie Kirk tweets, then that's it.

01:55:57.647 --> 01:55:58.068
It's done.

01:55:58.108 --> 01:55:58.808
It's programmed.

01:55:58.868 --> 01:55:59.209
It's over.

01:55:59.249 --> 01:56:00.330
There's no algorithms.

01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:06.754
There's no things that need demystification or we got to get the AI out of this.

01:56:06.935 --> 01:56:12.719
It's just actors on a script that have agreed to accept the script because that's their job.

01:56:12.759 --> 01:56:14.520
And it doesn't matter how it's edited.

01:56:14.921 --> 01:56:17.803
They don't need to know because it's a need to know basis.

01:56:19.226 --> 01:56:21.147
in a way that serves certain agendas.

01:56:21.927 --> 01:56:22.527
So yeah, you're right.

01:56:22.607 --> 01:56:25.868
It's not reality in the reality sense of the word.

01:56:26.469 --> 01:56:27.809
There's always a space.

01:56:27.989 --> 01:56:40.054
There's a rift between you trying to hit at real reality versus the code base that's there to give you, let's say, a view, a take on what that reality is.

01:56:40.094 --> 01:56:40.994
No, I totally agree with you.

01:56:41.034 --> 01:56:43.475
I mean, I give you, especially political actors,

01:56:44.315 --> 01:56:45.476
They tend to be on script.

01:56:46.176 --> 01:56:51.700
So for example, you had all of the drones that go into Ukraine and then all of a sudden you see

01:56:53.944 --> 01:56:59.409
80 on my site, maybe like 30 internet sites coming up saying Donald Trump is weak.

01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:02.051
Donald Trump allows NATO to be attacked.

01:57:02.431 --> 01:57:09.197
And they're saying almost the exact same thing with maybe a different tone, a different letter, a different word here or there.

01:57:10.098 --> 01:57:19.606
So he imagines that what he's seeing is what a national security theater or just the spontaneous output of the human population.

01:57:19.686 --> 01:57:20.807
See, that's the trick here.

01:57:21.347 --> 01:57:33.418
They have a very specific agenda of what they want to accomplish in referencing that particular event, creating hysteria around that particular event, trying to get a following on that particular event to get it to bubble up on the side of the thing.

01:57:34.264 --> 01:57:40.366
Those people, they know that this wasn't an attack or NATO.

01:57:40.986 --> 01:57:44.668
That doesn't stop them from pushing it out there in order to try to pull Donald Trump in a particular direction.

01:57:45.228 --> 01:57:45.688
It's scripted.

01:57:46.108 --> 01:57:46.408
Agreed.

01:57:47.329 --> 01:57:48.249
And it's not just that.

01:57:48.369 --> 01:57:49.229
It can be all sorts of things.

01:57:49.289 --> 01:57:59.253
I mean, Cuban Twitter, if you remember, where I think the CIA created this kind of Twitter-like thing that they controlled, that they wanted to use to try to overthrow Donald Trump.

01:58:02.034 --> 01:58:11.762
He said CIA.

01:58:12.603 --> 01:58:19.349
So he seems to know that it can be used that way, but he doesn't seem to consider that it has been used that way on the Western world.

01:58:19.429 --> 01:58:20.370
That's the shocking part.

01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.810
I agree with you.

01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:21.891
No, I totally agree with you.

01:58:22.031 --> 01:58:23.712
I don't think people look at it in those terms, though.

01:58:24.073 --> 01:58:24.873
Let me add something.

01:58:25.834 --> 01:58:44.774
I mean, yeah, so like people understand, you know, a lot of anti-imperialists know about that episode in particular, well, yeah, that episode in particular where they had that, yeah, Twitter kind of thing that they operated, I think it was like ZunZuneo or something like that in Cuba to overthrow the government.

01:58:44.914 --> 01:58:47.937
Social media was clearly a weapon for regime change.

01:58:48.490 --> 01:59:10.220
So if it is a weapon for regime change and social engineering Don't forget an advisor to chd and robert f kennedy jr And now acip member robert malone was a part of the arab spring operation Which was also a flexing of the social media muscle to maneuver a population Against cuban sovereignty.

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.242
Well, what does that mean that we are using it every day?

01:59:14.362 --> 01:59:16.123
How are we being engineered?

01:59:16.516 --> 01:59:21.042
in a far more sophisticated way than it was like a decade or so ago.

01:59:21.583 --> 01:59:24.347
Another thing I might point out about that is

01:59:26.101 --> 01:59:33.469
The idea that, okay, so we all see that there are coordinated groups of liars.

01:59:33.549 --> 01:59:44.742
October 7th, perfect example, the 40 beheaded babies, these kinds of things, where everyone who is paying attention or is critical, basically,

01:59:46.744 --> 01:59:51.746
saw that as an basically obvious hoax, and saw that it was coordinated.

01:59:51.786 --> 02:00:00.210
That was very clearly, I mean, it was, we know that that came from Netanyahu's office and was handed out, you know, okay, that was very obvious.

02:00:01.431 --> 02:00:02.711
So we know these things happen.

02:00:03.392 --> 02:00:05.733
And those are those are the most obvious ones.

02:00:06.073 --> 02:00:12.636
What I would suggest the example that you gave about like, these, you know, drones in the Poland,

02:00:13.655 --> 02:00:24.360
in order to convince Donald Trump to be more aggressive towards Russia, whatever, I think that Donald, the idea that Donald Trump is,

02:00:26.315 --> 02:00:37.805
Anti has these anti-interventionist instincts very end is pushed by Hawks Very well could be and probably is part of the script.

02:00:38.306 --> 02:00:49.896
Yes That's most security state script because it's a little point because you know, Donald Trump speaks from both sides of his mouth all the time he says, you know, we don't we don't seek regime change in Iran and

02:00:50.996 --> 02:00:51.897
You know, we don't want war.

02:00:51.917 --> 02:00:53.398
We're going to negotiate with them.

02:00:53.718 --> 02:01:05.143
And then he uses those negotiations to give Israel the element of surprise for Israel to launch this war, which then Trump, of course, supports in every way, and then actually even joined in.

02:01:05.684 --> 02:01:06.964
The same thing with Hamas.

02:01:07.024 --> 02:01:07.665
The U.S.

02:01:07.725 --> 02:01:07.905
was

02:01:08.465 --> 02:01:12.246
you know, oh, we got really tired of Joe Biden, you know, everyone's Oh, Trump is here.

02:01:12.266 --> 02:01:14.506
We got this temporary bag in the car.

02:01:14.866 --> 02:01:17.307
And then negotiations with Hamas.

02:01:17.367 --> 02:01:18.527
And this is great.

02:01:18.607 --> 02:01:20.627
And wow, finally, some sense here.

02:01:20.767 --> 02:01:27.268
And then the element of surprise, boom, you know, so that to me is all that's coordinated.

02:01:27.428 --> 02:01:28.169
That's yes.

02:01:28.769 --> 02:01:29.669
That's all the money.

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:30.749
Exactly.

02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.669
Precisely.

02:01:31.909 --> 02:01:32.469
Precisely.

02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.849
Yes.

02:01:33.349 --> 02:01:34.490
They got those guys together.

02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:36.210
Boom, you know, so

02:01:37.502 --> 02:01:42.026
These are the same, these are scripts, national security state scripts.

02:01:42.106 --> 02:01:44.708
This is not happening again and again by accident.

02:01:44.908 --> 02:01:57.218
And if it were one time, you know, that Trump got played or got rolled, then I'd say, Oh, okay, you know, that might carry some water, this idea that, you know, he's being pressured like that.

02:01:57.878 --> 02:01:58.699
But, um,

02:01:59.389 --> 02:02:03.031
The reality, I think, fool me once, shame on you, right?

02:02:03.071 --> 02:02:13.478
Fool me like 30 times, then at some point, I'm just a goldfish going into the side of the bowl again and again, like think, think, think.

02:02:13.918 --> 02:02:16.560
And that's basically, I think, where we're at.

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:26.907
And people who, and I'm not accusing you of this, obviously, but even myself, for a long time, I really thought that, yeah, Trump really does have these anti-interventionist instincts.

02:02:27.287 --> 02:02:28.648
He sells it really well.

02:02:29.424 --> 02:02:35.365
And I think this is broadly accepted in anti-imperialist thinking.

02:02:37.586 --> 02:02:41.587
Okay, I'm going to leave it right here for now.

02:02:41.727 --> 02:02:45.007
And after I get back from the gym, I'm going to pick it up where I left off.

02:02:45.047 --> 02:02:51.829
And if I do not manage to do that for some reason, which I don't think is going to be a problem, I will definitely pick it up here tomorrow morning.

02:02:52.769 --> 02:02:57.372
I have this and one more video and one more point to make that I think is all going to sync really nicely together.

02:02:57.853 --> 02:03:05.218
So hopefully at about 420 or so, 430 when I get back, I'll just take my sweaty head and put it back on the screen and start right here.

02:03:05.278 --> 02:03:06.619
So thanks very much for being here.

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:07.720
There's no music out.

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:08.800
I'm really going to leave right now.

02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:12.863
I'm going to stop streaming as soon as it goes blank and then I'll come back in a couple hours and finish this.

02:03:12.903 --> 02:03:14.624
Thanks very much and thanks for your patience.

02:03:15.565 --> 02:03:19.948
It's going to be a busy week and a busy month and a busy fall.

02:03:20.008 --> 02:03:20.809
Let's put it that way.

02:03:21.289 --> 02:03:27.836
We just crossed the fall equinox, so it's time for the work to really start.

02:03:27.876 --> 02:03:30.038
It's basketball season almost, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:30.058 --> 02:03:32.001
That means big time, big time focus.

02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:35.224
Thanks for being here, and I'll see you again in a few hours.

02:03:35.304 --> 02:03:36.766
I really hope it's going to work out.

02:03:36.786 --> 02:03:37.306
I think it will.

02:03:37.887 --> 02:03:38.648
Thanks, thanks, thanks.
