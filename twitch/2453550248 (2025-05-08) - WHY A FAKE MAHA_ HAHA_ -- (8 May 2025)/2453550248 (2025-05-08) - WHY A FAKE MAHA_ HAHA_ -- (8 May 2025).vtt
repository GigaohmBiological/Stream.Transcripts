WEBVTT

00:21.656 --> 00:31.640
Officials in two Latin American countries alerted the WHO of several outbreaks of a new infectious disease that's mysteriously appearing across the region.

00:31.940 --> 00:36.202
Severe Epidemic Enterovirus Respiratory Syndrome 2025.

00:37.302 --> 00:43.945
Over the past six weeks alone, there have been 500 confirmed or suspected cases reported.

00:44.445 --> 00:50.988
The virus could cause a severe pandemic if early containment and mitigation efforts are not successful.

00:51.578 --> 01:00.307
The pandemic in this type of situation and trend would be a risk for the global health security.

01:00.528 --> 01:04.992
Pandemics are inherently political, financial, and so much broader.

01:05.273 --> 01:07.855
We have not spoken on the leadership

01:09.016 --> 01:09.716
in country.

01:10.296 --> 01:13.077
And I think that we need to be also very careful.

01:13.317 --> 01:19.639
We cannot decide a lot of things without the leaders be involved and agree on that.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.480
There is no substitute for national leadership.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.162
It's important to support the local response and the national response.

01:26.502 --> 01:36.845
Training those that are in these areas first, enabling them with the tools, protecting them, and if need be, regional solidarity first.

01:37.338 --> 01:47.612
At this stage, communication is key, and communication should include not just scientists with data, but also social, religious, and political leaders.

01:47.773 --> 01:48.113
Trust.

01:48.614 --> 01:54.242
This is an essential issue, and trust was broken among countries.

01:54.983 --> 01:59.408
between populations and healthcare systems, between healthcare systems and governments.

01:59.428 --> 02:06.795
I'm very sorry to say that in 2025 we need to strengthen the health system.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.618
WHO needs to be a voice for the voiceless.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.901
No one is safe until all of us are safe.

02:12.546 --> 02:21.278
As of today, there have been an estimated 1 billion cases worldwide, with more than 20 million deaths, including nearly 15 million children.

02:21.838 --> 02:25.543
Countless millions are alive, but left with paralysis or brain damage.

02:26.044 --> 02:29.909
The most successful countries are those which invested in preparedness.

02:30.329 --> 02:32.711
and trained for this moment years in advance.

02:33.292 --> 02:44.141
This included having full-time pandemic preparedness and response teams, which conducted detailed operational planning and routinely tested those plans through exercises and drills.

02:44.582 --> 02:50.667
If more countries had participated and heeded the guidance, the toll might have been much less.

02:54.679 --> 02:57.500
A condition that we will not call autism.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.180
I don't like the word autism.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.120
He was vaccine damaged.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.921
He was neurologically damaged.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.362
A condition that we will not call autism.

03:06.502 --> 03:08.042
I don't like the word autism.

03:08.942 --> 03:09.983
He was vaccine damaged.

03:10.343 --> 03:11.783
He was neurologically damaged.

03:12.543 --> 03:15.224
A condition that we will not call autism.

03:15.364 --> 03:16.924
I don't like the word autism.

03:17.824 --> 03:18.865
He was vaccine damaged.

03:19.225 --> 03:20.625
He was neurologically damaged.

03:21.987 --> 03:24.109
condition that we will not call autism.

03:24.230 --> 03:25.791
I don't like the word autism.

03:26.672 --> 03:27.613
He was vaccine damaged.

03:53.801 --> 03:53.982
so

04:17.461 --> 04:19.102
Good morning, everybody.

04:19.222 --> 04:20.023
Welcome to the show.

04:20.063 --> 04:27.488
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist, coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:27.508 --> 04:29.369
It is the 8th of May, 2025, and I'm happy to be here.

04:35.040 --> 04:49.409
I think it's important to realize that for a long, long time I thought that there were good people around and all I had to do was teach them the truth and the truth would escape and together we would change the world.

04:49.489 --> 04:53.652
But instead, I kept running into people who were, I don't know,

04:54.472 --> 04:55.653
had ulterior motives.

04:56.734 --> 04:59.536
And that's what I meant in the beginning of this stream.

05:00.057 --> 05:09.645
That's why I started with this graphic in the beginning of the stream, because we need to understand the form that this military industrial operation took.

05:10.365 --> 05:15.707
and it is a form that is a lot different than what you see in a comic book or on a movie screen.

05:16.647 --> 05:25.890
There are coordinated liars, that's all it requires and these actors were put in place because there's trillions of dollars at stake and because there's

05:26.610 --> 05:33.457
two generations of human endeavor at stake here, all bent on the Human Genome Project.

05:33.637 --> 05:49.313
And so once you understand that COVID is just a part of that, once you understand that from the moment that we dropped the bomb, basically, this whole thing started, and it is a contiguous line of people that were connected to all of those

05:50.033 --> 06:06.519
Those pillars of the military industrial complex around the Manhattan Project in after World War two that are now the same people they're all descended from the same dads and it is remarkable because part of this this illusion is a

06:07.879 --> 06:28.529
a number of fake groups, of sabotaged groups that herd cats for this illusion and maintain this limited spectrum of debate which results in an illusion of consensus which, like it or not, can even affect the people at the highest levels of our society.

06:29.130 --> 06:34.452
Social media can be used to convince a president just like it can be used to convince your grandmother.

06:34.953 --> 06:36.914
Ladies and gentlemen, whoever surrenders

06:37.819 --> 06:48.345
to the scrolling, whoever surrenders to the social media as being a representation of social reality is essentially a victim of it.

06:48.925 --> 06:49.745
And that's where we are.

06:49.806 --> 06:56.029
That's why I think it's so important to say that they need us to teach our children this gain of function mythology.

06:56.469 --> 07:01.172
And by simply not acquiescing to that pressure, we can actually win.

07:02.613 --> 07:24.310
And if you understand specifically how this was done over the last five years, how it's possible that we got to the point where everybody, both sides of the coin, have come to consider a lab leak, a possibility, even if it doesn't explain the last five years, it could explain the future five, depending on where avian flu came from.

07:24.830 --> 07:26.831
And so we must be vigilant.

07:26.871 --> 07:29.473
We can't let any of this dust in our eyes.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.774
And we've got to.

07:31.894 --> 07:32.435
We've got to.

07:32.555 --> 07:35.597
We've got to get to the eyewash station of biology.

07:36.217 --> 07:38.118
And I hope that's giga ohm biological.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.799
The voice you hear is that of Jonathan Cooley.

07:39.819 --> 07:40.640
You can find my work.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.862
on the PubMed website using my last name, my first two initials.

07:44.902 --> 08:01.329
You can also find a lot of my ideas contorted and diluted on the sub stack called Woodhouse 76, where those ideas are used to have fake dialogues with people like Claire Craig or Pierre Corey, or even Mike Eden, and hopefully Jay Bhattacharya, that would make this

08:02.229 --> 08:04.230
comedy routine complete.

08:05.170 --> 08:07.330
Anyway, I also helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

08:07.370 --> 08:10.631
write this book, and we had a great relationship.

08:10.691 --> 08:16.253
And then Children's Health Defense hired me after that, and I thought that was a great thing, but it turns out it wasn't.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.893
They fired me for talking about Robert Malone at the end of 2024.

08:22.254 --> 08:25.375
And so yesterday I covered this, hold on one second.

08:26.565 --> 08:35.792
Yesterday, I covered this video, which is of these three clowns, two of which are now at the top of the pyramid of the FDA.

08:36.493 --> 08:45.280
This guy is at the top of the pyramid of the FDA, an Egyptian, and then that guy is at the head of the vaccines.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.763
He's replacing Jeremy Marks, or Marks, whatever that guy's name was.

08:50.804 --> 08:51.785
Was it Jeremy Marks?

08:53.203 --> 08:54.465
Can somebody put it in the chat?

08:54.525 --> 09:01.053
But anyway, whoever marks the guy was that the FDA that made all those goofy videos about kids getting vaccines is fine.

09:02.055 --> 09:04.398
That that guy's being replaced by him.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.279
So I

09:08.443 --> 09:13.506
I can't stress enough how this is absolutely contiguous with this diagram.

09:13.606 --> 09:31.196
Most of these people were put in place specifically so that these people, these actors that we covered yesterday, could be put in place to maintain the trajectory that we are on, where the medical data of America

09:32.472 --> 09:45.642
and the medical remnants of America, all the things that are coming out of our hospitals, all the things that are coming out of all these testings, all the data that's coming off of our phones, has now given up to the highest bidder.

09:47.165 --> 10:03.954
And the highest bidder right now might actually be the national security state in America that for a long time has made this a priority under the pretense that it should be the basis for a biological security defense system for America.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.175
We have to first understand the human genome.

10:07.916 --> 10:12.298
And of course, that argument was specifically made to the Clinton administration, for example.

10:14.537 --> 10:22.946
And so a spectacular commitment to lies has been maintained, and it's been maintained, for example, by Tony Fauci being in his position for so long.

10:23.526 --> 10:33.296
It has been maintained by the people that Fauci trained under the HIV pretense have maintained their positions for so long because it is

10:33.957 --> 10:39.918
a spectacular commitment to those lies that allows those people to function at that high level in that bureaucracy.

10:39.958 --> 11:03.142
Whether or not they're read in is still hard for me to tell, to be quite honest, because again, remember for nearly 50, well, I guess if you count my toddler age, then for 50 years of my life, I was spellbound under the same pretense that viruses exist and contagion can be understood as viruses moving from person to person and never gave it much thought.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.763
just like most people in academia don't really give it much thought.

11:08.565 --> 11:16.018
It's only after five years of giving it much thought and trying to help people who I thought were giving it much thought for longer than me.

11:17.403 --> 11:24.285
did I realize the extent to which we have been lied here, lied to, brought here over generations.

11:24.345 --> 11:28.046
It's not our fault, but we can save our children from this.

11:28.726 --> 11:41.609
And so these people have been put in place on social media to create an illusion of consensus, to agree about what questions to ask and what the right answers are, and to laugh about it so that you feel comfortable with their conclusions.

11:41.729 --> 11:46.050
And the underlying presuppositions of all the discussions that they have

11:46.650 --> 11:48.072
are the actual enchantment.

11:48.192 --> 11:56.080
If these guys don't question PCR and they don't question its ability to find and identify novel pathogens easily.

11:57.173 --> 12:02.916
then that mythology will be maintained by the entire two hours conversation.

12:03.296 --> 12:23.805
If they don't talk about the fact that the population pyramid had an anticipated rise in old people and it all caused mortality that could have been misconstrued as something else, having a propensity to kill old people like this bald guy wants you to believe, then that illusion will be maintained by the two hour conversation that doesn't even actually directly address it.

12:26.516 --> 12:34.300
And just like Wikipedia, it's not so much what's there, it's what's not there, what's assumed, what they allow you to assume.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.082
And how long did they argue about boosters for what age group?

12:40.623 --> 12:42.244
And now they're part of the FDA.

12:44.045 --> 12:49.688
And this is all by design because the health freedom movement in America was never real to begin with.

12:50.888 --> 12:53.690
I thought it was just like everybody else did, but it wasn't.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.551
It was already there.

12:56.789 --> 12:59.190
Meryl Nass was already there.

13:00.831 --> 13:01.591
Don't you see?

13:04.273 --> 13:06.354
Stephanie Seneff was already there.

13:09.575 --> 13:16.618
And because of the way that the pandemic went and the nature of the, you know, how on narrative did we stay?

13:16.678 --> 13:18.199
We didn't stay that on narrative.

13:18.259 --> 13:19.660
Everybody didn't take the shot.

13:22.594 --> 13:29.578
And so this fracturing of society, I can only see as being on purpose.

13:31.179 --> 13:43.485
And this putting of these people into places right now, like Vinay, or like the latest thing with Casey Means, this can only be to light the fuse of America's controlled demolition.

13:43.525 --> 13:44.806
That's all I can see here.

13:44.846 --> 13:51.830
This is undermining the very fabric of our society by putting clowns in places where there should not be clowns.

13:53.220 --> 13:58.204
People shouldn't walk into the US government and meet a bunch of people in funny animal costumes.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.806
But that's essentially what we have here.

14:04.848 --> 14:14.655
At least with Barack Obama, they tried to portray him and made him get a resume that seemed like could be misconstrued as somebody who knew what community service was.

14:14.675 --> 14:21.961
That's what they tried to do with Bobby, but all these other people, come on.

14:23.038 --> 14:29.341
It's like entrepreneur, entrepreneur, entrepreneur, five-time postdoc and surfer going nowhere.

14:30.782 --> 14:34.604
What, deep woods doctor, bioweapons expert?

14:36.085 --> 14:37.465
What are we talking about here?

14:38.666 --> 14:39.967
These aren't patriots.

14:43.889 --> 14:47.831
And these people haven't made any progress in five years.

14:49.099 --> 14:51.541
except for in their tuning and their harmonizing.

14:51.581 --> 14:54.322
These people sing together better than the nylons do.

14:59.026 --> 15:12.234
And that's why nobody ever talks about Brandy Vaughn or the biology of ingestion versus injection, which I think is one of the most beautiful, beautiful simplifications that Brandy contributed to my lexicon.

15:13.515 --> 15:17.718
That's why Polly Tommy is in the same place that she's been for so long.

15:20.014 --> 15:21.776
and why nobody really points that out.

15:21.816 --> 15:23.897
Like, wow, you've been fighting for a long time.

15:23.958 --> 15:26.800
I mean, could you summarize the message for us?

15:31.124 --> 15:31.945
I'm Mary Holland.

15:31.985 --> 15:33.666
You sure have been fighting for a long time.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.468
What's your elevator pitch?

15:39.051 --> 15:40.832
Their elevator pitch is what?

15:40.972 --> 15:41.893
It's health freedom.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.617
It's we should be able to say whatever we want to.

15:45.697 --> 15:46.918
We should have free choice.

15:48.726 --> 15:50.386
Everybody should have free choice.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.628
It's worth six million votes, ladies and gentlemen.

15:56.528 --> 15:58.148
People like Steve Bannon know that.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.009
People like Peter Thiel know that.

16:01.889 --> 16:04.910
People like Alex Karp know that.

16:04.950 --> 16:13.412
You know the guy who went to Germany and studied for a while because he wanted to understand how people know things and how people perceive participation in their democracy?

16:16.243 --> 16:27.346
And so they created a social movement and they curated it so that it would go nowhere, but it would hurt as many cats as possible.

16:28.806 --> 16:30.167
5G, here we are.

16:30.707 --> 16:32.207
There's a, there's a booth over there.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.869
And Brandy eventually figured it out.

16:40.353 --> 16:47.218
Brandy eventually figured it out after she made all these videos with all of her heroes, and every time she says hero, they cringe.

16:47.958 --> 16:52.802
Just like Polly did in the last video, now she's cringing as she says, I'm here with my hero.

16:55.043 --> 16:57.445
Suzanne Humphries knows that she's not a hero.

16:58.326 --> 16:59.466
She knows that she's a liar.

17:01.108 --> 17:02.529
She's definitely on script.

17:03.669 --> 17:08.693
There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is the reality of America.

17:09.724 --> 17:19.091
And that means that as Americans, we have to wake up, take responsibility for where we are, apologize to our children and clean up this mess.

17:20.852 --> 17:24.975
This mess is a continuous line of mess, right?

17:25.375 --> 17:27.417
And we need to take responsibility for that.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.318
That doesn't mean we have to burn the flag.

17:29.758 --> 17:34.722
It doesn't mean we have to separate into 50 states, although maybe that's not the worst idea ever.

17:35.828 --> 17:45.642
But maybe we should give everybody some financing and some free help to move to whatever state they want to move to so that then when we declare the borders closed, everybody's happy with where they are.

17:54.005 --> 18:04.810
But I can tell you for sure that a group like the Independent Medical Alliance, who's promoting people like Andrew Wakefield, is just part of that show.

18:04.890 --> 18:11.672
It's part of that illusion of consensus that there is some movement and some alliance of groups.

18:11.752 --> 18:13.573
And it's just nonsense.

18:13.673 --> 18:17.415
It's absolutely positively only herding cats.

18:17.955 --> 18:22.938
The idea that Dr. Casey Means is now the new Surgeon General nominee.

18:23.418 --> 18:25.159
What could possibly go wrong here?

18:25.219 --> 18:30.822
Well, there could be a hearing with a lot of contentious questions.

18:31.742 --> 18:33.964
There could be all kinds of show there, right?

18:35.945 --> 18:40.147
We could talk about her dad and the connections her dad has.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.729
Or we could talk about her maybe being in CIA.

18:45.856 --> 18:49.157
And so again, this is going to happen around the world.

18:50.497 --> 18:54.978
It's going to be a sort of predictable wave of media hype.

18:55.538 --> 19:04.040
And of course, all of these people that are on the Maha movement are triggered by it because some of them do know that she's kind of a Johnny come lately.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.760
She didn't fight against COVID.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.581
She was writing her book during COVID and now she gets to come in front.

19:09.841 --> 19:10.661
That's not fair.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.980
So, of course, this is all built into the movement.

19:15.000 --> 19:15.941
This is all drama.

19:15.981 --> 19:28.003
Now we're still arguing and listening to the same people argue, even if a few of them are just unwittingly doing what they're kind of set up to do, because they don't need them anymore.

19:29.683 --> 19:35.804
If Mary Talley Bowden gets really upset with Kelly Victory because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:35.844 --> 19:40.645
apparently doesn't have any power at all, well, that's really just braming Donald Trump then, isn't it?

19:43.137 --> 19:47.940
And so now they can start this narrative that Donald Trump's not listening to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.881
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:48.901 --> 19:49.721
doesn't have any power.

19:50.102 --> 19:54.965
And meanwhile, on PBS NewsHour and all over the left, they're still talking about this guy being a clown.

19:55.405 --> 20:00.128
And Casey Means being evidence that obviously this clown has got another clown in there.

20:02.270 --> 20:10.175
And so we'll be arguing with our own side, supporting people on our own side, and they're all on that same diagram.

20:11.189 --> 20:13.373
We are trapped in a hamster wheel.

20:14.095 --> 20:18.924
And the rungs of the hamster wheel are the social media accounts of these people.

20:19.841 --> 20:27.383
the questions that they say we should argue about, the people that they say we should ally ourselves with or ally ourselves against.

20:27.443 --> 20:35.565
And all the while, all of these people believe, essentially, in the bad biology, that it's a combination of your environment and your genes.

20:36.085 --> 20:44.748
So if we understand the environment and we can understand your genes, basically, we just have to put those two together with AI, and then we can take over the evolution of the species.

20:49.116 --> 20:55.159
I know usually you're used to me not starting with an introduction like that, but today I thought I'd mix it up a little bit.

20:55.219 --> 20:55.919
Welcome to the show.

20:55.979 --> 21:00.841
This is a gig on biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief, where we seek the truth together.

21:01.221 --> 21:05.983
Biology is the way, I thought I'd go back in time today because it is Thursday, right?

21:06.023 --> 21:06.804
It is Thursday.

21:07.524 --> 21:12.006
And sometimes I do a throwback Thursday and I didn't title it that, but that's what I'm gonna do today.

21:12.806 --> 21:28.817
I want to see if you can see how this is a fake Maha movement by going back to 2017 and watching a video that happened of an event that happened in April of 2017 and again remember this is in the context of these

21:29.417 --> 21:33.159
you know, this previously under control pneumonia.

21:33.259 --> 21:38.882
And then suddenly in 2020, we lose control of pneumonia and a bunch of people die.

21:39.242 --> 21:41.503
But you can also see the slant in the curve here.

21:41.863 --> 21:44.184
We have an expected rise in all cause mortality.

21:44.204 --> 21:48.146
We have an excess number of old people that we could have made even worse, right?

21:48.186 --> 21:55.030
By just making sure that in all these years in prep for the big show, that we took really good care of old people.

21:55.430 --> 21:59.715
We're gonna spend, spare no expense on all the old people for like four years.

21:59.795 --> 22:01.878
And then in 2020, we're just gonna say, you know what?

22:02.899 --> 22:05.202
Antibiotics don't really work for pneumonia.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.144
And dexamethasone, that's great stuff.

22:07.184 --> 22:09.086
That makes everybody feel better for a while.

22:09.587 --> 22:11.950
And you know, supplementary oxygen is better than nothing.

22:14.249 --> 22:31.233
So, 2017, they have already had vaxxed one, ICANN already exists, and now we're about to put Mary Holland and James Lyons Weiler and a few other people in place so that we can convince Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:31.253 --> 22:32.154
to change his

22:33.914 --> 22:54.274
you know mercury project to children's health defense and believe that you know we need to fight against vaccines too because there's mercury in those as well that's essentially how they got him he might not know how awful this rig is how awful this truman show is but he's got so many people around him telling him he's doing a great job

22:54.634 --> 23:06.009
He might not realize that already back in 2017, these people were building their resume as people speaking out about this, including Mary Holland, who in 2015 was on Democracy Now!

23:06.109 --> 23:12.778
saying that the untested MMR or some component of it is responsible for her son's autism.

23:14.949 --> 23:29.361
Remember in 2013, her chief science officer at CHD would not use the word autism as I showed you in the beginning of my presentation today because it's not autism, it's vaccine damage, it's neurological damage.

23:30.462 --> 23:31.583
Let's check this video out.

23:32.824 --> 23:33.585
You're gonna love this.

23:35.346 --> 23:37.088
It's an IPAC video from 2017.

23:51.515 --> 23:52.476
Shoot, I need more water.

23:52.536 --> 23:55.677
So this is Chaz DeVolt, she's with the Washington State Department of Health.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.620
You're just gonna have to watch it like this and tolerate it.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.501
And I'm here as a private citizen.

24:10.276 --> 24:10.916
Yes, thank you.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.657
There's James Lyons-Weiler.

24:12.697 --> 24:13.738
There's Mary Holland.

24:14.579 --> 24:15.419
There's Sasha Latipova, 1.0.

24:15.459 --> 24:18.721
Do you have any thoughts on homeoprophylaxis?

24:19.962 --> 24:21.102
And that's one question.

24:21.122 --> 24:23.344
And then I have a second question for the attorney types.

24:24.244 --> 24:26.986
I received a form when I took my child to preschool.

24:27.206 --> 24:32.109
And it said, I know I could be causing the death of my child and the other children.

24:32.149 --> 24:33.530
Mary Holland there.

24:33.590 --> 24:34.710
And I refused to sign it.

24:35.171 --> 24:36.431
And I had to leave.

24:37.732 --> 24:57.761
I'm wondering is there anything I could do to fight that I gotta listen to that again Sorry private we don't private preschool So this is in New York They're asking questions they're asking questions, sorry I

24:59.690 --> 25:03.192
They're asking questions to the, thank you, buddy.

25:03.572 --> 25:10.355
They're asking questions to the panel after the panel has presented over two days.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.556
And so, you can find some of those panels.

25:12.996 --> 25:16.577
This is called Immunology Session 6, and there's Session 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

25:18.863 --> 25:21.985
Do you have any thoughts on homeoprophylaxis?

25:23.225 --> 25:24.326
And that's one question.

25:24.346 --> 25:26.607
And then I have a second question for the attorney types.

25:27.488 --> 25:36.113
I received a form when I took my child to preschool, and it said, I know I could be causing the death of my child and the other children.

25:36.833 --> 25:39.695
And I refused to sign it, and I had to leave.

25:40.795 --> 25:43.879
And I'm wondering, is there anything I could do to fight that?

25:44.480 --> 25:47.163
I can't afford to hire an attorney, but I want to fight it.

25:47.383 --> 25:48.184
What did she say?

25:48.244 --> 25:49.425
I didn't get that again.

25:49.445 --> 25:50.767
Private preschool, right?

25:50.847 --> 25:51.388
We don't have public.

25:51.628 --> 25:54.191
Any thoughts on homeoprophylaxis?

25:55.452 --> 25:56.574
And that's one question.

25:56.594 --> 25:58.816
And then I have a second question for the attorney types.

25:59.697 --> 26:08.303
I received a form when I took my child to preschool and it said, I know I could be causing the death of my child and the other children.

26:08.323 --> 26:11.925
And I refused to sign it and I had to leave.

26:12.846 --> 26:16.088
And I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to fight that.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.290
I can't afford to hire an attorney, but I want to fight it.

26:19.530 --> 26:26.875
So now there's a letter that she got that said that if you're not going to vaccinate your kid, then you have to sign a letter that says, you know, you could be

26:27.955 --> 26:31.397
You know, you could be contributing to the death of other children.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.798
That's your own child.

26:32.838 --> 26:33.698
That's pretty hardcore.

26:35.279 --> 26:37.500
That's a private we don't private preschool, right?

26:37.540 --> 26:38.941
We don't have public preschools here.

26:39.061 --> 26:40.121
So it's a private institution.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.062
Was the first part of your question to me?

26:42.082 --> 26:42.723
Oh, individual.

26:43.223 --> 26:46.885
Oh, I can address a little.

26:47.265 --> 26:50.046
I'm not a doctor, but plays on TV.

26:52.007 --> 26:55.529
I work for a holistic veterinary practice, and we do use a lot of homeopathy and treatment.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.143
We get questions about no-sodes for dogs all the time.

27:00.163 --> 27:08.953
Our vets do not recommend them because the basis of homeopathy is treating disease with these homeopathic medicines.

27:09.093 --> 27:10.635
They're not really intended as

27:11.576 --> 27:13.518
a prophylactic or a preventive measure.

27:15.220 --> 27:23.868
Now, I have heard of naturopaths that use those preparations kind of to fudge titers so that kids can get into school.

27:24.268 --> 27:30.514
There's really not a lot of info on if they actually prevent disease, if they work the same way that a vaccine would.

27:31.704 --> 27:37.387
they can produce antibodies and you can have a positive titer, which schools do accept as a substitute.

27:38.848 --> 27:43.791
But really they don't work the same way and that's not really the basis of homeopathy.

27:43.931 --> 27:47.873
So that's the best answer I can give you on that.

27:48.753 --> 27:50.054
They could help, we don't really know.

27:50.094 --> 27:52.215
I don't think there's been enough study on it.

27:53.922 --> 27:54.603
Can I add to that?

27:55.143 --> 28:11.240
So the problem is that homeopaths do not have enough funding and possibilities to actually do any studies about homeoprophylaxis the way it would be designed for vaccine to test for efficacy and so on and so forth.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.284
So that's why we are stuck in this situation where

28:15.424 --> 28:18.525
we can't predict ahead of time whether it's working or not.

28:18.845 --> 28:42.072
We know that homeopathy works for historical reasons, and those who have experience, personal experiences with homeopathic remedies know, you know, just like people know when there is vaccine injury, people who use homeopathy successfully, they see the difference.

28:42.092 --> 28:42.993
You don't like it that way?

28:43.053 --> 28:43.813
I'll put it in the front.

28:45.119 --> 28:46.440
Let me just format it different.

28:53.084 --> 28:53.864
Did that not work?

28:54.324 --> 28:56.666
I guess it didn't work to start it over.

29:01.148 --> 29:04.610
I just like to have that slide in the front there because it's really important.

29:09.451 --> 29:10.131
Can I add to that?

29:10.691 --> 29:26.756
So the problem is that homeopaths do not have enough funding and possibilities to actually do any studies about homeoprophylaxis the way it would be designed for vaccine to test for efficacy and so on and so forth.

29:26.796 --> 29:29.357
So that's why we are stuck in this situation.

29:43.516 --> 29:44.016
There we go.

29:44.036 --> 29:51.061
Okay, I have to start it over again.

29:51.181 --> 29:52.622
Sorry, but you said it.

29:52.922 --> 29:55.244
I'm just responding to the chat.

29:56.084 --> 29:56.825
Current slide.

30:00.805 --> 30:03.507
I'll just do it again and go forward because I think I was pretty good.

30:03.527 --> 30:14.894
I do not have enough funding and possibilities to actually do any studies about homeoprophylaxis the way it would be designed for vaccine to test for efficacy and so on and so forth.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.916
So that's why we are stuck in this situation where

30:19.076 --> 30:22.198
We can't predict ahead of time whether it's working or not.

30:22.498 --> 30:30.681
We know that homeopathy works for historical reasons and those who have experience, personal experiences with homeopathic remedies know

30:32.430 --> 30:44.234
Just like people know when there is vaccine injury, people who use homeopathy successfully, they see the difference in the recovery speed from various diseases.

30:44.774 --> 30:48.815
So it's really an unknown, so you can't say one way or another.

30:48.895 --> 30:53.897
Historically, homeoprophylaxis wasn't used as vaccines for long-term prevention.

30:54.157 --> 30:57.458
It was only used in the context of the ongoing outbreak.

30:57.978 --> 31:04.000
And there are some studies on leptospirosis in Cuba where they did look at it from a public health perspective.

31:04.361 --> 31:07.922
They didn't do homeoprophylaxis versus placebo.

31:08.002 --> 31:12.484
So in case you don't see what I see, what I see is a person with a foreign accent

31:13.949 --> 31:19.752
You can find out later what her name is and you'll find out where she worked and where her training was, and it won't surprise you at all.

31:20.332 --> 31:31.437
What I see is somebody who's acknowledging viruses, acknowledging that vaccines probably work, but homeopathy might be an alternative to it, but it's not appropriate as prophylactics.

31:31.477 --> 31:33.358
It's only appropriate when things are spreading.

31:35.154 --> 31:54.465
And so with this in-depth knowledge that she will present in immunology session number five, where she talks about all kinds of stuff, all the biology and virology and molecular biology you could possibly want, never once does she question the idea of intramuscular injection as medicine.

31:56.165 --> 32:00.508
Never once does she question the idea of RNA, you know, how can it do that?

32:02.262 --> 32:15.526
Never once does she question the idea of vaccination in general, just offers alternatives, offers explanations for why it might not always work as well as we thought, and even wrote a book about it.

32:17.667 --> 32:27.710
I don't know if she's a good guy or a bad guy, but my feeling is, is that she's not contributing to simplifying the problem, and all the work that I've found from her doesn't simplify the problem.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.751
This question is not simplifying the problem.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.079
It wasn't a study.

32:34.399 --> 32:47.130
It was just handing out homeoprophylaxis to leptospirosis-affected area, which brought down the epidemic, which would normally happen after rainy season.

32:47.630 --> 32:56.578
So there is a possibility that it works, so it needs to be investigated, but we cannot really apply it right now the way vaccines are intended.

33:01.678 --> 33:06.200
I'm gonna give you half an answer to your second question and then let's talk offline.

33:07.780 --> 33:12.382
When a law is unjust, it must be broken.

33:13.123 --> 33:26.368
So if you look at any social movement in history from 19th century slavery to civil rights, the people who were seeing ahead into the future did not go along with the law.

33:27.008 --> 33:29.189
And if you wanna know what I mean, we'll talk after.

33:32.708 --> 33:38.481
I can add just a slight bit of info on that topic, too, before Alan.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.426
Yeah, let Alan have a turn first.

33:41.704 --> 33:43.905
Yeah, I'm going to respectfully disagree with that.

33:43.945 --> 33:45.045
We're a system of laws.

33:45.105 --> 33:50.287
And if we decide to, we're just going to sort of, it's not arbitrary, obviously be a good reason.

33:50.887 --> 33:57.649
But if we don't follow the laws, you know, if we decide we're not going to follow this law, well, then what are the, what laws are we going to follow?

33:57.789 --> 33:59.590
That is not Sasha Latipova.

33:59.630 --> 34:00.870
Do not get confused.

34:00.990 --> 34:01.250
Okay.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.751
That's not Sasha Latipova.

34:02.811 --> 34:04.191
I can tell you who it is right now.

34:05.192 --> 34:09.633
Um, I got to look over here though, cause I don't know her name off the top of my head.

34:12.286 --> 34:19.932
It is Tatyana Obukhanovich, Tatyana Obukhanovich, Ph.D.

34:20.412 --> 34:23.915
Physicians for Informed Consent, founding director emeritus.

34:24.535 --> 34:25.656
She has her Ph.D.

34:25.696 --> 34:34.543
in immunology from Rockefeller University or did her postdoctoral training at Harvard Medical School and at Stanford School of Medicine and during her postdoc and

34:36.184 --> 34:46.017
Doctoral studies, she co-authored several peer research, reviewed things in nature, cell, and later authored the book titled Vaccine Illusion.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.021
So that's who that is.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.844
And I'll let this keep playing.

34:51.394 --> 34:53.255
slippery slope once you start down that path.

34:53.315 --> 34:59.697
Now, I would be the first to say there are extreme situations where you don't follow a law for the sake of following a law.

34:59.717 --> 35:08.940
If there's going to be some obvious negative effect, then you make a decision and there's no quick one-size-fits-all kind of thing here.

35:08.960 --> 35:09.701
But what I will say,

35:11.001 --> 35:17.846
That situation in particular, when the government requires you to agree with them, they're actually violating First Amendment free speech.

35:17.966 --> 35:23.370
Free speech, interestingly enough, includes not only the right to voice your own views.

35:24.671 --> 35:30.855
Within reasonable limits, you're no longer allowed to put the prescription for how to make a dirty nuclear bomb on the internet.

35:30.915 --> 35:38.400
But within reasonable limits, you have the right to share your views, but you also have the right to be free from being compelled to speak.

35:38.420 --> 35:39.401
I'm sure Mark heard that.

35:40.777 --> 35:46.483
When someone says you have to agree, when the government says you have to agree with me, you're being compelled to speak or required to speak.

35:46.503 --> 35:48.344
That's a violation of first amendment free speech.

35:48.404 --> 35:52.208
So there's a clear legal violation there that could potentially be pursued.

35:52.248 --> 35:54.610
There was a group of parents in a new.

35:54.790 --> 36:00.676
So do you find it surprising at all that he's making an elaborate show of how free speech is at the heart of this?

36:01.537 --> 36:02.257
Stop lying.

36:03.178 --> 36:04.540
Stop lying.

36:05.020 --> 36:05.741
It's brutal.

36:07.281 --> 36:15.184
New England State who pursued that and actually got the health department to change the form there without having to file a lawsuit, but potentially you could file a lawsuit as well.

36:15.524 --> 36:19.765
Allen, in this particular case, we're talking about a private institution, not a public school.

36:20.385 --> 36:22.006
Does that change anything?

36:22.026 --> 36:24.587
Is that access or... Sorry?

36:28.364 --> 36:31.707
Yeah, I stand corrected.

36:31.907 --> 36:54.584
It does come up with private physicians with the vaccine refusal form, and while I would say it's clearly unethical, there's a separate question, because we have constitutional rights with governments, not with private entities, but there are exceptions, and there are some times where when you're dealing with the vaccines, which is so deeply entrenched in government, to make a long story short, that that would create an exception, but you have to look at the specific situation as to

36:55.966 --> 36:57.768
Did you have something, Leah?

36:57.848 --> 36:58.770
I can't cut you off.

37:00.262 --> 37:08.065
on the note of what's on the exemption form, there is a bill that would remove those incriminating pieces of the form.

37:09.106 --> 37:10.886
I'm gonna say something crazy here.

37:10.906 --> 37:25.272
I think that there is a case that happened in Idaho where a mandatory vaccine was thrown out because the rationale for vaccination was dumb.

37:27.142 --> 37:30.804
Either it didn't work or people were getting, I don't remember what it was.

37:31.304 --> 37:33.245
But there is precedence in American law.

37:34.386 --> 37:39.108
And somebody from the Health Freedom Movement is thinking about running for governor of Idaho.

37:39.608 --> 37:40.429
But, you know, whatever.

37:41.309 --> 37:46.492
I'm just throwing that out there for, you know, somebody that really wants to chase down something, that might be something to chase down.

37:49.150 --> 37:53.755
It got introduced right before the deadline for this session, so it didn't go anywhere.

37:54.756 --> 37:57.339
It's still a possibility for the next session.

37:57.459 --> 37:58.860
Is that not moving for you either?

37:58.880 --> 37:59.841
Sorry about that.

38:00.442 --> 38:02.264
Let me see where we are.

38:02.504 --> 38:05.667
I'll just escape here for a second and start it again.

38:06.908 --> 38:09.371
Sometimes goofs up when I play big videos like this.

38:09.431 --> 38:10.072
I apologize.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.784
and it's like right here, eight minutes or so.

38:13.884 --> 38:15.185
Form and then signing it, handing it.

38:15.205 --> 38:15.345
Oh no.

38:15.405 --> 38:16.886
Potentially you could file a lawsuit as well.

38:16.906 --> 38:21.788
But Alan, in this particular case, we're talking about a private institution, not a public school.

38:21.928 --> 38:24.450
It's still a possibility for the next session.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.310
So it's HB 2092.

38:27.691 --> 38:38.877
Please talk to your house representatives about it and why it's important to you because they need our personal stories in order to even consider doing that.

38:39.946 --> 38:42.067
Can I go one step further with that, or do we need to move on?

38:42.087 --> 38:42.947
I'll let you make the call.

38:44.127 --> 38:45.988
Did you have something to add on it, Jack?

38:46.548 --> 38:47.069
Yes, thank you.

38:48.529 --> 38:53.551
In a number of states, people are modifying the form and then signing it and handing it back, as Mary said earlier.

38:53.571 --> 39:02.774
I don't know if you were here present or not, but the solution for you tomorrow that's easy to recommend is that form of your expression is still your expression, as Alan is teaching us.

39:03.294 --> 39:07.276
And so if there's something on there that you disagree with, just cross it off.

39:08.476 --> 39:08.676
right?

39:08.976 --> 39:12.319
Initial the cross off and then sign it and then hand it back.

39:12.359 --> 39:15.421
That puts them in the position where they're going to have to be the end.

39:15.481 --> 39:18.203
So he's totally an expert on legal documents.

39:18.283 --> 39:22.386
Now you can just take a contract and cross it out and initial it and then sign it.

39:22.426 --> 39:23.827
And that's totally the way it works.

39:23.987 --> 39:29.791
While he's sitting on a panel with a lawyer from Columbia University right next to him, that's pretty remarkable.

39:30.111 --> 39:41.033
to Gator, either in a court of law, if they push it back to you and say, well, I'm not going to accept this, then if you want to sue them, then you can say they refuse the form and then still have the same discussion.

39:41.633 --> 39:42.553
Go ahead, Alan.

39:42.993 --> 39:45.074
If you modify the form, they're going to say we can't accept it.

39:45.094 --> 39:46.074
They're going to send it back.

39:46.114 --> 39:52.775
I mean, how is it possible that that's the guy who says that when he's sitting next to a Columbia lawyer right there?

39:55.335 --> 39:58.116
And somebody from the New York Health Department right there?

39:59.845 --> 40:00.861
What is going on?

40:02.967 --> 40:16.572
They have the leverage, I'm gonna respectfully disagree, and so they say, you signed the form or you can't come to school here, and they're the one in the position to say that, or you can't, I will not treat your child in my practice if you don't sign the form, you know, in the respective situations.

40:17.212 --> 40:28.396
I would not wanna sign something that I didn't agree with, but I, so far, this might be a naive thing to say, but so far, I've never heard of anybody, a situation where somebody had one of those forms, where somebody tried to use it against them.

40:28.436 --> 40:31.617
You said you were a bad parent, therefore, you know, this consequence.

40:32.137 --> 40:36.903
I think it's there for the simple purpose of trying to coerce you into vaccinating right now.

40:36.963 --> 40:43.270
And if you really dig in your heels and you say, I'm not going to do this, then OK, your kid doesn't go to school here or you don't get to come to this practice.

40:43.290 --> 40:44.391
So you're left holding the bag.

40:44.771 --> 40:46.173
You can try modifying it.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.655
And if they accept it, great.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.865
You know, I say do it in the smallest way possible.

40:50.905 --> 40:51.985
Write above your signature.

40:52.065 --> 40:53.306
I do not agree with all of the above.

40:53.326 --> 40:58.890
You know, the least way that you can write it, I think, has the best chance of them accepting it.

40:58.930 --> 41:04.254
But if they say no, you keep that one as the evidence that you tried to disagree.

41:04.734 --> 41:07.076
You sign another one the way they want it, and get on with your life.

41:07.376 --> 41:11.920
Now, you can also challenge it legally if it's a public school with a form, because it's unconstitutional.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.022
In my opinion, you find an attorney, and you could potentially

41:15.843 --> 41:19.407
get the health department to change the form again, potentially without a lawsuit at all.

41:19.447 --> 41:23.771
There's an attorney right there, but she apparently doesn't have an opinion.

41:23.791 --> 41:32.061
You know, I work with hundreds and hundreds of people over the years, and I rarely have somebody who has the emotional stamina of the money and says, yeah, let's go to court.

41:32.101 --> 41:33.142
I want to fight this.

41:33.202 --> 41:36.866
We all want to fight it, but who actually wants to hire an attorney and walk through the steps?

41:37.126 --> 41:42.709
I'd like to inject that you're part of a community as well, and there's resources online for you to do GoFundMes.

41:43.410 --> 41:54.796
And I've seen people be intimidated by lawyers, nothing against lawyers, but their own lawyer who said, you're going to offend the judge if you go to the community with this to raise money.

41:54.836 --> 41:56.577
And I said, go to the community and raise money.

41:57.657 --> 42:05.380
I know examples of where a doctor systematically has a conversation with the patients, and they say, just cross out what you don't like and sign it.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.260
I'll accept it.

42:06.840 --> 42:07.561
So it can work.

42:07.601 --> 42:08.781
It depends on the practice.

42:08.821 --> 42:14.823
And the most valuable thing that you might have in this situation are your feet, and go find another practice.

42:15.023 --> 42:16.263
OK, let's move on.

42:16.404 --> 42:20.265
Oh, we have one more comment, kind of a comment from one of our people, me.

42:21.465 --> 42:21.785
Right, right.

42:22.025 --> 42:25.028
Okay, so yeah, because I know you're not from Washington State, Ellen.

42:25.508 --> 42:34.395
So many of us do homeschooling, and as you know, the people who work at the schools will ask you to do more than what you are legally required to do by the state law.

42:35.036 --> 42:37.558
Now, so what we do is we get educated as homeschoolers.

42:37.578 --> 42:42.501
For example, we go to the school, we say, here, I'm gonna give you the information you need.

42:42.902 --> 42:45.744
They give you a form asking for five other pieces of information.

42:46.284 --> 42:49.427
And if you say to the person who works there, and they're ignorant enough,

42:49.867 --> 42:51.790
No, I only need to tell you these two things.

42:52.190 --> 42:53.191
They might argue with you.

42:53.672 --> 43:02.283
But if you then get the support of who and you get the legislation, you come back and say, legally, I'm only obligated to do this, they will give in.

43:02.883 --> 43:08.030
Now, I'm pretty certain that this form that's being floated around the schools that comes from Department of Health,

43:08.490 --> 43:19.901
I think it is actually an expansion beyond what the law actually states we're required to do and that the Department of Health pushed it a little bit and they're just waiting for people to be ignorant enough to give them what they want.

43:20.282 --> 43:25.987
So what I would do is check with Department of Health, confirm whether their form lines up with the actual letter of the law.

43:26.487 --> 43:27.549
I don't think it does.

43:28.029 --> 43:31.592
And if you can do that and go back to the school, they've lost their argument.

43:32.273 --> 43:37.804
But someone has to do that check on whether this new form lines up with what the actual letter of the law is.

43:38.145 --> 43:41.953
And if it doesn't quite, then that's your option.

43:50.004 --> 43:53.086
And, sorry, that was a delay.

43:55.167 --> 44:01.430
You can go right into, like right now, tomorrow, whenever, you can go and read the wording of the law as it is.

44:01.490 --> 44:05.793
You can just look up current Washington State, you know, Google Washington State immunization laws.

44:07.714 --> 44:13.017
I don't believe that they took away your right to have your doctor use a letter.

44:14.429 --> 44:21.773
In on the 2011 exemption form, which is still available, and you could also try to use that one, that does not have the incriminating language on it.

44:22.133 --> 44:26.916
It just says, my doctor has told me about the risks and the benefits and that's it.

44:28.677 --> 44:32.259
But on that form, it also stated your doctor can use a letter instead of this.

44:34.124 --> 44:42.071
The new form doesn't say anything, but I don't think there's anything in the wording of the law that took away your right to also just have your doctor use a letter.

44:42.411 --> 44:43.572
So there are other ways around it.

44:43.612 --> 44:47.196
You could ask me to show you the form afterwards, the older form.

44:47.756 --> 44:49.378
They may just use that.

44:50.038 --> 44:50.919
There are other options.

44:51.259 --> 44:55.303
I mean, it's good to push it, I think, if you can, but you know.

44:55.717 --> 44:57.018
Okay, very excellent.

44:57.158 --> 44:58.078
This is a great discussion.

44:58.499 --> 44:59.519
Let's move on to our next.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.281
It's a great discussion that goes nowhere.

45:02.881 --> 45:14.489
The thing that bothers me the most is that over the past five years, number one, the best friend that I lost was an intellectual property lawyer named Nathan.

45:15.509 --> 45:17.591
And I had my leg up on a stool because my back hurts.

45:19.312 --> 45:21.053
And Nathan passed away

45:22.479 --> 45:24.700
after having an acute aneurysm.

45:25.961 --> 45:29.262
And I attribute it to him having transfected himself twice.

45:31.023 --> 45:38.326
And I'm upset about it because Nathan was the best man that I knew on Earth, basically, is how to say it.

45:38.867 --> 45:40.347
And all of his friends agreed.

45:40.427 --> 45:46.210
Like, we all looked to Nathan as, like, the standard of, you know, if we did it like Nate, we'd be kicking ass.

45:48.071 --> 45:48.251
And...

45:51.092 --> 46:11.962
I don't know what to say, but I've had now several friends that are lawyers, and I know from them, I know from Nathan, that what made law so exciting to Nathan was that it was about winning arguments.

46:12.783 --> 46:18.926
It was about making arguments that were hard to defeat or had no holds.

46:20.262 --> 46:22.304
And that was the part about it that he liked.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.385
It was like a puzzle you had to solve.

46:24.425 --> 46:28.528
And if you assembled it correctly, it was stable and couldn't be knocked over.

46:30.410 --> 46:44.120
And so what I find so puzzling about a mom, like, I don't know, a Columbia professor who claims that at some part of the MMR hurt her son, she doesn't already have a very specific strategic

46:45.433 --> 47:11.436
Legal strategy laid out to solve these problems because that's what lawyers do They build a a solid argument based on And Instead she's sitting there quiet letting James Lyons Weiler answer questions about legality and how to cross out phrases and things in forms and signature the change and

47:16.041 --> 47:19.824
If you don't see it yet, just understand that she doesn't have anything to say.

47:19.944 --> 47:32.374
She's more or less there to see what they say so that she can report back to her little table with him and James and they can decide how they can create a hamster wheel about that argument.

47:32.434 --> 47:34.636
Make sure that they never get any farther than that.

47:34.716 --> 47:36.217
Oh yeah, she's arguing about that.

47:36.257 --> 47:36.778
That's great.

47:37.118 --> 47:38.099
Let's keep her busy.

47:38.419 --> 47:39.360
Let's promote her.

47:40.101 --> 47:42.863
Maybe we should have her do an article for IPAC next month.

47:44.909 --> 47:48.630
And we can put her in touch with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:48.670 --> 47:54.832
because by the time this is all over, those two people will have convinced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:54.872 --> 48:00.334
to change his World Mercury Project to CHD.

48:02.175 --> 48:05.076
And they're going to all blame the story on Laura Bono.

48:05.736 --> 48:08.137
But I assure you, it had nothing to do with Laura Bono.

48:08.197 --> 48:10.197
It's these two and Meryl Nass.

48:11.978 --> 48:12.178
Next.

48:13.902 --> 48:15.182
This is actually a great segue.

48:16.243 --> 48:30.708
In my experience, something interfering with a lot of the legal and especially the scientific and political discussions are the social aspects, the language we use, the sociology around vaccines.

48:31.308 --> 48:41.572
And I'd be really interested to just go down the line and each of you speak briefly about what you would like to see change about the way we speak about vaccines

48:42.212 --> 48:44.633
across the board, across many different perspectives.

48:44.933 --> 48:52.216
Think about the question that she just asked and how yours truly would answer it if he was on the stage right now.

48:53.716 --> 48:57.578
What would you change about how we speak about vaccines?

48:59.078 --> 49:01.859
That's a pretty badass question.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.760
You want to hear it again just to make sure you heard it right?

49:04.780 --> 49:06.341
Because it's a badass question.

49:09.110 --> 49:10.370
This is actually a great segue.

49:11.451 --> 49:25.915
In my experience, something interfering with a lot of the legal and especially the scientific and political discussions are the social aspects, the language we use, the sociology around vaccines.

49:26.495 --> 49:36.778
And I'd be really interested to just go down the line and each of you speak briefly about what you would like to see change about the way we speak about vaccines

49:37.438 --> 49:39.839
across the board, across many different perspectives?

49:42.519 --> 49:52.201
Well, I think the way the other side speaks is either directly or indirectly from a tactic of how to manipulate or control to achieve their end.

49:52.821 --> 50:03.304
And so in order to get to a place where we can truly have an objective, open discussion about it, we have to clear out whatever part is there with an agenda other than

50:05.564 --> 50:06.966
having that actual conversation.

50:07.026 --> 50:15.315
So I think we need to be exploring and looking more at what are the systems of control that are in place trying to prevent the conversation that all of us want to have.

50:15.335 --> 50:23.404
I'm not sure just continuing to assert our view and hoping at some point that somebody will finally say, okay, let's have a conversation.

50:25.472 --> 50:32.237
There are many different levels and types of people on both sides of it, so I'm oversimplifying it here.

50:32.277 --> 50:41.123
There are good people who disagree with us, I would say because they have bad information, but there are also very deliberate mechanisms employed.

50:41.143 --> 50:45.467
When you don't have the truth on your side, you have to use something else to control the discussion.

50:46.187 --> 50:49.632
And so we are where we are because the discussion has been controlled.

50:50.073 --> 50:56.922
So we need to identify those mechanisms of control and address those in order to clear a space for there to be an open conversation.

50:56.942 --> 51:01.188
So that's what I'd like to see us as a community and a society, larger society, focusing on.

51:04.309 --> 51:09.614
There was a meme that was on Facebook, which really applies here.

51:09.654 --> 51:13.497
So there is one side yelling at the parent, you are stupid, vaccines are safe.

51:13.878 --> 51:17.581
The other side is yelling at the parent, you are stupid, vaccines are dangerous.

51:19.022 --> 51:24.968
So what I would like to see change is that a parent is treated as an intelligent adult.

51:26.528 --> 51:29.089
And so neither side determines that.

51:29.729 --> 51:35.971
The truth is on our side, we already did research, just accept on faith what we did or what we researched.

51:36.411 --> 51:46.474
We really need just to present information to parents and let them decide which risks they want to take or don't want to take and how they perceive the decisions and really

51:52.695 --> 52:05.999
Remember what I'm saying remember what mark is saying and remember what so many of these people are not saying Intramuscular injection is an unjustifiably silly way.

52:06.019 --> 52:15.081
I mean it's unjustifiable as a methodology in the application of medicine intramuscular injection

52:17.603 --> 52:20.406
is very simply ridiculous.

52:24.910 --> 52:41.467
And it's just absolutely remarkable that if you realize that intramuscular injection is maybe even worse than hitting kids on the head with a baseball bat repeatedly because you want their skull to get stronger or something like that.

52:46.914 --> 53:04.285
I mean, this is extraordinary, ladies and gentlemen, because if you believe what Brian Hooker believed in 2013, and that is that kids can reach a toxic tipping point because of this stupid vaccine schedule that probably doesn't save anybody anyway,

53:06.812 --> 53:09.334
that you would be fighting for it with a little more vigor.

53:10.095 --> 53:13.697
And when somebody asks you, how would you like people to talk about vaccines?

53:14.078 --> 53:16.459
You wouldn't have a 45 minute answer.

53:16.519 --> 53:21.423
You wouldn't have this canned answer about let's let people make a choice about this stuff.

53:24.806 --> 53:31.731
Because you know, if parents believe that hitting their kids is good for them, then we should just let them do it.

53:34.389 --> 53:38.452
If doctors believe that hitting kids is good for them, then we should just let them do it.

53:39.633 --> 53:50.402
And if it's a hammer they wanna use, or they wanna use a small little toy baseball bat, or they wanna use a collapsible metal baton, what difference does it make?

53:50.442 --> 53:51.163
It's up to them.

53:51.703 --> 53:56.287
Let's just give them all the information about that stuff and let them decide.

53:58.533 --> 54:04.395
And so essentially, that's what Brian Hooker, who used to not use the word autism, just decided to do.

54:04.876 --> 54:06.596
I'm not going to take a stand on anything.

54:06.636 --> 54:08.017
I'm just going to let people decide.

54:09.017 --> 54:12.779
And maybe I'll get a book out of it, or maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:12.799 --> 54:15.400
will get to the White House, and then we'll do something about it.

54:16.160 --> 54:21.622
I don't know what we're going to do, though, because I guess what we're going to do is just give them all the information and let them decide.

54:22.143 --> 54:24.223
Because we don't want to yell at them the truth.

54:24.684 --> 54:27.905
We don't want to take the stance that we know the truth.

54:29.244 --> 54:30.324
That would be crazy.

54:32.125 --> 54:38.326
Cause you know, homeopathy sometimes works and vaccines can work and, and there's stuff that, that, you know, it's out there.

54:38.346 --> 54:42.767
It comes down to vaccine choice on either end.

54:45.668 --> 54:48.949
Vaccine choice is absolutely bullshit.

54:51.769 --> 54:52.769
That was a perfect answer.

54:56.530 --> 55:09.133
Yeah, I mean, part of changing the language around this conversation is that last slide that Tatiana showed where it's not about putting vaccines in the middle, it's about putting the immune system and maybe I'd like to put the child there too.

55:09.333 --> 55:19.716
And so if we all remember that we have the same goal, which is to have the healthiest, happiest, smartest children, we're trying to

55:20.576 --> 55:23.198
keep our kids safe from infectious disease and all.

55:23.238 --> 55:29.681
Well, then why don't we look at the kids who've never had a vaccine and talk about how healthy and smart they are?

55:30.621 --> 55:32.142
You know, like Brandy Vaughn did.

55:33.283 --> 55:37.145
She's still alive right now, but not on stage with these super clowns.

55:37.805 --> 55:40.846
Also keep their brains and their bodies intact.

55:41.647 --> 55:45.769
Um, then we can completely change the conversation and we can fix this.

55:48.132 --> 55:56.297
So at the start of the vaccine epidemic book, it talks about the sort of pro versus anti and how that's totally unhelpful.

55:57.057 --> 55:59.498
It's such a much more complicated question.

56:00.019 --> 56:03.481
And for me, I focus on prior free and informed consent.

56:05.422 --> 56:10.725
Informed consent does not exist if you tell people the mathematical risk.

56:11.425 --> 56:17.987
Informed consent only exists when you tell them the biological justification for what they're doing.

56:18.647 --> 56:20.047
And they don't have it.

56:20.527 --> 56:28.049
There is no biological justification for the intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to augment a healthy human.

56:28.089 --> 56:29.230
There just is not.

56:31.770 --> 56:33.231
You want to talk about free choice?

56:33.251 --> 56:35.171
You want to experiment with that shit?

56:35.231 --> 56:36.272
That's totally fine.

56:36.292 --> 56:37.292
Go ahead and do it, but...

56:38.277 --> 56:46.679
to talk about it like it is medicine, to give it a term like vaccine, to distinguish it from any other dumb idea, is absurd.

56:47.179 --> 56:47.919
She knows it.

56:47.999 --> 56:49.079
That's why she's there.

56:49.139 --> 56:50.880
It's not a complicated issue.

56:51.280 --> 56:54.640
That's exactly her job, is to repeat that over and over.

56:55.101 --> 56:56.481
It's really complicated.

56:56.961 --> 57:01.722
It's a complicated environmental and a genetic... Oh.

57:06.546 --> 57:07.988
The human right to choice.

57:08.428 --> 57:10.269
That's how I try to deal with the language.

57:10.970 --> 57:12.651
The human right to choice?

57:12.691 --> 57:14.353
That's all she's got to say?

57:14.373 --> 57:19.037
Oh my gosh, it's, it's, it's vomitous.

57:19.217 --> 57:20.118
It's absolutely.

57:20.158 --> 57:21.199
And you do it very well, by the way.

57:21.859 --> 57:28.024
Have the same goal, which is to have the healthiest, happiest, smartest children.

57:28.145 --> 57:33.149
And the healthiest, happiest, smartest children are the ones that aren't vaccinated.

57:33.229 --> 57:34.330
That's the truth.

57:36.863 --> 57:39.764
And yes, they do kinda say it in this book.

57:39.964 --> 57:41.105
Kinda, but not really.

57:42.566 --> 57:47.067
And they're not selling this book anyway, and Brian Hooker isn't saying it anyway, so who gives a shit?

57:50.109 --> 57:52.630
It's not like anybody's proposing an IQ test.

57:56.453 --> 58:03.596
We're trying to keep our kids safe from infectious disease and also keep their brains and their bodies intact.

58:04.796 --> 58:10.258
Intact, but we use intramuscular injection as regular way of administering medicine.

58:10.918 --> 58:12.259
Stop lying!

58:14.440 --> 58:16.801
What does intact mean in your wild world?

58:19.663 --> 58:23.426
Then we can completely change the conversation and we can fix this.

58:24.127 --> 58:33.854
Listen to this global at the start of the vaccine epidemic book, it does, it talks about the sort of pro versus anti and how that's totally unhelpful.

58:38.892 --> 58:41.093
such a much more complicated question.

58:41.613 --> 58:48.516
And for me, I focus on prior free and informed consent and the human right to choice.

58:48.976 --> 58:50.797
That's how I try to deal with the language.

58:51.617 --> 58:52.538
Oh my gosh.

58:54.739 --> 58:58.820
I don't think I've ever felt this much wrath in my whole life.

59:00.821 --> 59:02.362
What a fraud this woman is.

59:03.718 --> 59:15.941
What an absolute fraud this woman in who's, who's been on Bannon's war room repeatedly for five years and been promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:16.041 --> 59:25.023
as a flawless leader for five years and a CHDs, you know, I don't know, president and leave or something like chairman on leave.

59:29.324 --> 59:29.944
Oh my gosh.

59:29.964 --> 59:32.325
This is one of the worst people in America.

59:33.621 --> 59:34.562
It's really awful.

59:35.362 --> 59:36.903
And you do it very well, by the way.

59:38.905 --> 59:39.725
There's another one.

59:41.466 --> 59:47.130
On stage at every CHD event I've ever attended, most of the time every day.

59:47.791 --> 59:53.014
So multiple on stage in front of thousands of people that paid to go there.

59:55.195 --> 59:58.258
To promote his IPAC that is doing this one now in 2017.

59:58.298 --> 59:58.498
This guy.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:07.105
who wrote the Sky Horse book, The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism in 2016.

01:00:07.345 --> 01:00:24.359
You know, the same publisher that published the Waging War on the Autistic Child by Andrew Wakefield in 2012, published Callous Disregard in 2001, that's at 10, no, 2010, with the data of my friend Paula Aitken's kid.

01:00:34.147 --> 01:00:39.611
and before that published a book where there's an epilogue story in it where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:47.737
runs as an independent candidate and then joins another candidate and gets into the White House, and then the candidate that he got in the White House with gets shot.

01:00:49.978 --> 01:01:00.366
And that's a 2008 book by Sky Horse Publishing, the same publishing company that's put out Brian Hooker's book, that put out all of Robert F., or sorry, Robert Malone's books.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:07.252
You know, like the lies my government told me.

01:01:07.272 --> 01:01:10.755
You see Children's Health Defense is right there with Robert Malone, right there.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.423
Skyhorse Publishing will probably put out Kevin McKernan's book in a year or two.

01:01:21.286 --> 01:01:23.868
So I can refer you to jameslyonsweiler.com.

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:25.569
I've written an article on this topic.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:33.956
It's time to change the course and dialogue over vaccines and informed consent.

01:01:35.597 --> 01:01:41.101
And then I'd also like to see, well, respect is huge.

01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:41.862
I mean, that's part of it.

01:01:42.482 --> 01:01:51.486
I'd like to see Congress be told by the American public to fund earmark money for a billion dollars to do neurodevelopment research.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.708
We don't need research on vaccines.

01:01:54.788 --> 01:01:58.229
That's for pharmaceutical companies to do.

01:01:58.309 --> 01:02:07.854
I'd like to see the pharmaceutical companies broken up like we did with Ma Bell and have competition between smaller and drive innovation with a free and open market.

01:02:08.774 --> 01:02:15.059
I'm hoping that this would be an opportunity for our government to do that with the MMR alleged fraud.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.664
So the billion dollars that I'm speaking about, we have seven research program initiatives.

01:02:23.926 --> 01:02:32.132
Can you imagine now that there is a remote possibility that somebody like James Lyons Weiler will actually be around the NIH?

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:33.653
Can you see what I'm saying?

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:55.849
this is terrifying development research reform initiative and the very first program the first priority of program is how do we treat these kids that are vaccine injured without saying the vaccine injured how do you handle all this no development disorder in a in a in our in our society from a medical standpoint

01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:58.770
What are the most optimal ways of treating them?

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.130
How do you integrate that into education?

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:19.495
And a major source of the inspiration for our hypothesis should come from the observational data from the population, the moms and the dads of the United States, testing cannabis oil and testing other methods and testing what happens if there, you know, are there safe ways to get metals out of tissue and all of it.

01:03:19.915 --> 01:03:21.096
Let's do science.

01:03:21.316 --> 01:03:27.982
It's so obvious to me that we have a very sick subpopulation and they're not being completely underserved.

01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:34.948
And of course the thing that he's saying here is that there's a genetic vulnerability to these heavy metals.

01:03:34.988 --> 01:03:36.970
Some kids can handle it, some kids can't.

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.693
Why don't we start studying detox?

01:03:43.075 --> 01:03:45.357
Why don't we start studying CBD oil?

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:54.969
You know, cannabis, that thing that the Autism One conference in Chicago said was like a really good idea.

01:03:55.009 --> 01:03:59.493
You know, that thing that Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project has been sequencing.

01:04:02.728 --> 01:04:05.030
probably to make medicines with plants.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:17.999
You know, like Brian Hooker did for 16 years before he said that I don't use the word autism because it's, and this guy, how do we treat these vaccine injured kids without saying they're vaccine injured?

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:19.720
Why don't we just call it autism?

01:04:22.552 --> 01:04:30.137
And the final thing I'd like to say is because artificial immunization is not going to go away.

01:04:30.357 --> 01:04:31.218
It's just not going to.

01:04:31.278 --> 01:04:37.181
So what I'd like to do is set up robust research to develop safety screens.

01:04:38.422 --> 01:04:42.845
And all of this presumes that we can do a natural, normal objective.

01:04:42.925 --> 01:04:45.567
Sorry, I'm cleaning my ears to make sure I heard what I just heard.

01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:48.809
I think there might be something in my ears.

01:04:50.043 --> 01:04:54.907
I think he said something about artificial, artificial, artificial, as even if that's a thing.

01:04:55.367 --> 01:04:57.469
Artificial vaccination is not going away.

01:04:57.509 --> 01:04:58.310
Did he say that?

01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:59.231
Did he say that?

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:01.653
I think he said that.

01:05:01.893 --> 01:05:03.254
Let me just, let me just make sure.

01:05:04.195 --> 01:05:05.896
I had to clean my ear up.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:06.917
That was really something.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.839
With each other, which just points right back to respect point.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.742
What are the most optimal ways of treating them?

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.084
How do you integrate that into education?

01:05:15.604 --> 01:05:19.047
And the, this may a major source of the inspiration for

01:05:19.127 --> 01:05:26.612
Just want to say that that's what Polly Tommy and her daughter did for the first 10 years of their anti-vax career.

01:05:27.033 --> 01:05:36.579
They just advocated for more awareness of autism and more ways for kids to get jobs as autism and for teachers to be more aware of autism.

01:05:36.619 --> 01:05:40.462
I shit you not, this has been going on for a long time, guys.

01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:56.435
hypothesis should come from the observational data from the population, the moms and the dads of the United States, testing cannabis oil, and testing other methods, and testing what happens if there are there safe ways to get metals out of tissue, and all of it.

01:05:56.835 --> 01:05:58.016
Let's do science.

01:05:58.236 --> 01:06:04.897
It's so obvious to me that we have a very sick subpopulation, and they're not being completely underserved.

01:06:05.418 --> 01:06:06.898
Stop lying!

01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:08.278
The final thing I'd like to say is

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.303
Because artificial immunization is not going to go away.

01:06:14.523 --> 01:06:15.364
It's just not going to.

01:06:15.384 --> 01:06:21.451
So what I'd like to do is set up robust research to develop safety screens.

01:06:22.692 --> 01:06:31.902
And all of this presumes that we can do a natural, normal, objective conversation with each other, which points right back to respect.

01:06:34.606 --> 01:06:36.207
I don't know how to follow that.

01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:43.492
I don't know how to follow that either because these two are two of the worst traders in America.

01:06:44.573 --> 01:06:51.038
As far as I'm concerned, this is the heart of the fake anti-vax movement in America because look how long they've been busy.

01:06:51.558 --> 01:07:00.024
Look how long they have not been able to progress to understanding intramuscular injection as a methodology has wholly

01:07:01.497 --> 01:07:04.220
inappropriate given our biology.

01:07:05.481 --> 01:07:07.664
This lady said I want to talk about the immune system.

01:07:07.704 --> 01:07:09.265
Well you want to understand it?

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:16.153
You want to talk about an intact kid but you're going to give medicine with a needle?

01:07:20.845 --> 01:07:32.458
It's remarkable, ladies and gentlemen, and it is remarkable because remember, the reason why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America is because this idea is so simple.

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:36.202
Intramuscular injection is actually dumb.

01:07:37.139 --> 01:07:51.144
It makes no sense in the context of our biology, the way that our immune system is organized, the way that our microbiome is organized, and likely the way that our symbiosis with our microbiome expresses itself is the immune system.

01:07:52.384 --> 01:08:06.089
And so augmenting that system willy-nilly to pretend that we're saving people can only be a malevolent mythology put in place by people like Hilary Kaprowski,

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:15.629
and probably even Joshua Lederberg in the sense of Joshua Lederberg understood that he lived in Rome and that certain things were going to happen.

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:29.396
Apparently James Lyons Wyler also understands that he's in Rome because artificial vaccination is never going to go away because Rome wants it.

01:08:32.076 --> 01:08:46.985
And once you start to see it that way, once you rewatch Ben-Hur, and you hear Pontius Pilate say those words to Ben-Hur, and a man should know where he is, and right now the world is Rome, that's what you see here.

01:08:48.265 --> 01:08:51.867
People have been given the opportunity to serve Rome, and they're serving Rome.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:59.472
This one from Columbia University, not that dissimilar from Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University, serving Rome.

01:09:00.589 --> 01:09:03.851
not America and certainly not America's grandchildren.

01:09:06.553 --> 01:09:23.023
And if you can't see James Lyons Wyler for the trader that he is right now, given the context, given the seven years of context, almost nine years of context that we have between this time and where we are now in 2025.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.525
I mean, it would kind of go along with what Tatiana and Jennifer said.

01:09:32.007 --> 01:09:36.652
I just really wish there was less disdain from both sides of the issue.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:41.458
It seems like social media has just ramped up this war of hatred.

01:09:42.694 --> 01:09:57.638
people saying, I hope your kids die then, or even coming from our side with accusing someone of making the wrong comment that they're a troll, and it just, it can get so bad so quickly in online conversation.

01:09:58.859 --> 01:10:03.320
And I just wish that publicly there would be more discussion of,

01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:15.109
really how vaccines work and some of the limitations, like how it's sort of assumed that if you're vaccinated, you're, you can't get sick and you can't spread disease.

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:15.669
You're good.

01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:18.171
And that's just not necessarily.

01:10:18.211 --> 01:10:19.312
She almost got there.

01:10:19.372 --> 01:10:19.612
Right.

01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:25.696
She's like, I wish people would explain how vaccines work and, and how they're not perfect.

01:10:25.757 --> 01:10:31.481
And, you know, try to be, she's thinking in the right direction, but she hasn't done the requisite work.

01:10:32.759 --> 01:10:35.860
And I'm not blaming her because I hadn't done it until now either.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.402
But she hasn't done the requisite work so that she could teach it as easily as I can teach it.

01:10:41.462 --> 01:10:46.043
And since somebody in the chat asked me to do it, I'm going to do it again.

01:10:46.464 --> 01:10:50.585
Oh, I couldn't find my pen because I had it in its case.

01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:53.086
I think I can just go whoop like that.

01:10:53.286 --> 01:10:53.506
No?

01:10:54.866 --> 01:10:55.286
Wait, what?

01:10:55.787 --> 01:10:56.307
It's not on?

01:10:56.907 --> 01:10:59.188
OK, I don't have my camera on, but I can turn that on real quick.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:07.769
So I'm going to try and answer the question that Dragon Knight put in there.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:13.112
Would love a stream on how intramuscular vax is inappropriate, biologically speaking.

01:11:13.132 --> 01:11:20.778
I've got a pretty good cartoon way of teaching you, and then you can fill in the details by just googling the stuff that I talk about and figuring out that I'm probably right.

01:11:22.459 --> 01:11:24.080
So we can go over here, I think, now.

01:11:25.692 --> 01:11:41.178
I'm going to draw a rudimentary representation of your biology and specifically what you are as a pattern integrity.

01:11:41.238 --> 01:11:45.320
Remember, we are starting with the pretense that life

01:11:59.818 --> 01:12:03.999
Life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, okay?

01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:16.881
And so, I can't really draw a good picture of you as a human if I draw you with legs and arms and a head because those legs and arms and head have changed a lot over your lifetime.

01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:27.443
But if I simplify your body structure to two holes, because you have a hole right here and you got a hole back there, then I can draw a pretty simplified body

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:31.227
And I draw it kind of like what an ion channel would look like.

01:12:32.688 --> 01:12:34.509
And I draw it in cross section like this.

01:12:38.472 --> 01:12:45.036
And I usually have, you know, like some kind of, I can't really draw it perfect because I'm not an illustrator.

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:49.479
But you can imagine you can draw it like this, for example.

01:12:50.039 --> 01:12:55.002
You wouldn't be able to see both sides of it necessarily, but in this 3D drawing, you can see it in both sides.

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:55.903
And so there's a hole.

01:12:57.435 --> 01:13:01.457
with a side hole and then basically this.

01:13:02.797 --> 01:13:17.283
And so the way that I would draw you as a pattern integrity is that you have an inside and an outside, but you have to remember that the outside includes the contents of this hole.

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:26.051
So, in a sense, you're like a tube.

01:13:27.011 --> 01:13:34.213
And so, if you think of yourself as a tube, and you understand that actually there are several gates in here.

01:13:38.754 --> 01:13:38.994
Right?

01:13:39.034 --> 01:13:39.734
There are gates.

01:13:40.655 --> 01:13:44.896
And at every gate, there's a fairly good, everything in here is coated in mucus.

01:13:45.576 --> 01:13:49.977
And what ends up happening in the course of your lifetime is that food is coming in this end.

01:13:51.676 --> 01:13:53.277
And waste is coming out this end.

01:13:55.658 --> 01:13:59.841
And also air comes in this way, but it also comes out this way, right?

01:14:02.863 --> 01:14:04.564
And so that's a good basis, right?

01:14:04.604 --> 01:14:05.204
Here's your lungs.

01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:13.906
This would be your esophagus and your trachea and then your adductor.

01:14:13.926 --> 01:14:19.392
So you can get fancy about this too, but just understand this is as simple as I can make it.

01:14:19.412 --> 01:14:27.541
And there are a few sphincters that can kind of keep this compartmentalized and it's not that dissimilar to how the gut of a honeybee is organized.

01:14:28.536 --> 01:14:35.221
And just like the gut of a honeybee, you also have several zones in your tube.

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:39.904
And in those tubes, there are different complements of bacteria.

01:14:40.925 --> 01:14:49.872
Now, interestingly, in addition to those different complements of bacteria, every cell in your body is essentially a symbiotic

01:14:51.891 --> 01:15:02.878
machine, because inside of each cell is a bacterial symbiont called the mitochondria, and many, many, many of them, they have their own DNA, they divide on their own, etc.

01:15:03.719 --> 01:15:18.969
We don't understand a lot about mitochondria, at least they don't tell us a lot about mitochondria, but they are considered endosymbionts in my new biology and the biology of people like Lynn Margulis, and also the biology of people like Joshua Lederberg.

01:15:20.071 --> 01:15:36.358
And so it is my contention, and it is kind of a synthesis of other people's ideas, and it wouldn't surprise me if many people had already thought of this, but it is my contention that the individual pattern integrity that is you has a border like this.

01:15:39.932 --> 01:15:54.856
This is the whole pattern integrity, all the way around, and all the bacteria that are in here, all the bacteria that are on your skin, all the bacteria that are in the lining of your lungs, and all the mitochondria in your body, of course, are all one individual.

01:15:56.796 --> 01:15:59.397
And this is a symbiotic relationship.

01:15:59.877 --> 01:16:03.638
This pattern integrity, at the heart of it, is a symbiotic relationship.

01:16:03.678 --> 01:16:05.058
It doesn't exist without it.

01:16:06.141 --> 01:16:12.224
And what you will find with regard to plants and animals and insects is that they all share that in common.

01:16:12.384 --> 01:16:17.406
Even trees have an intimate interaction with soil bacteria at their roots.

01:16:17.926 --> 01:16:20.587
And without that interaction, trees would not be trees.

01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:27.190
Without the soil, the compost heap that we carry around in our gut, we would not exist.

01:16:27.911 --> 01:16:31.853
It is an absolutely essential part of our biology.

01:16:32.653 --> 01:16:34.814
And it is not just one bacteria.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.774
It is not just, you know, there to clean up the waste.

01:16:39.994 --> 01:16:47.257
It is a symphony that allows us to seamlessly extract useful things from our food.

01:16:50.178 --> 01:16:53.720
Useful things from the bacterial processes that occur here.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.842
And what's interesting, most interesting, is that the only

01:16:59.096 --> 01:17:02.357
sure thing in virology is bacteriophages.

01:17:03.017 --> 01:17:08.958
The genetic signal equivalent to viruses in bacteria are called bacteriophages.

01:17:09.518 --> 01:17:17.260
So we have bacteria of different kinds in our lung, in our guts, and we can call this one and two and three.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.521
And those bacteria are signaling, they are influencing one another using phages.

01:17:28.621 --> 01:17:33.102
And those phages, coincidentally, are free to pass the gut barrier.

01:17:33.142 --> 01:17:35.702
They're free to pass the blood-brain barrier.

01:17:35.742 --> 01:17:37.523
They're free to go wherever the hell they want to.

01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:57.826
And so it is very likely, in my humble opinion, that the immune system is primarily here to regulate what phages and what phage communication is allowed and what phage communication is not part of the symbiosis so that the preferred bacterial symbionts

01:17:59.321 --> 01:18:02.262
are given optimal conditions in our gut.

01:18:03.682 --> 01:18:05.823
That's what our immune system probably does.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:23.708
And in that interaction with the gut microbiome, we essentially prevent disease by and keep ourselves healthy and keep our digestion efficient by selecting with our immune system

01:18:25.939 --> 01:18:38.582
to benefit or to, let's say, bias the phage communication to the bacteria that we want there, that our body has selected, that our breast milk has taught us and given us.

01:18:38.982 --> 01:18:42.723
Because bacteria from the gut go through breast milk, believe it or not.

01:18:43.103 --> 01:18:50.565
And so one of the ways that your microbiome should have been seeded was through the breast milk of your mother.

01:18:52.205 --> 01:19:15.408
And so now if you see the immune system as selecting for and biasing this whole system so that you have a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria at the barrier of your skin, you have a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria that line the mucosal layer of your airways and of your gut,

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:26.636
and you have this symbiotic relationship which is maintained by the immune system's interaction with them and their phages.

01:19:30.639 --> 01:19:46.750
So if this is the background on which they claim to be able to pull up an RNA that is attributable to a coronavirus is absurd because the background signal here of bacteriophages from outside and within the individual

01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:50.681
are so many orders of magnitude above what they claim.

01:19:52.002 --> 01:20:02.370
At one time, Stephen Hatfield in 2020 said that you needed 50 virans in order to pass the infection from one person to another.

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:03.470
This is just absurd.

01:20:04.671 --> 01:20:09.375
And we have uncovered the biological basis for this system.

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:22.872
in our understanding of and tracing the roots of shotgun sequencing, because the people that invented shotgun sequencing are not actually the Human Genome Project at all.

01:20:23.912 --> 01:20:24.713
It's not at all.

01:20:25.573 --> 01:20:30.696
It was actually somebody working on corals and bacteriophages.

01:20:35.663 --> 01:20:46.783
And so then if I culminate this explanation, we have an immune system that is organized from the inside out, and inside out would also be pointing into the gut like this, right?

01:20:48.564 --> 01:20:55.990
And that orientation of the immune system is oriented inside out, but allows the free passage of phages.

01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:15.244
And so in my hypothesis, one of the most important roles of the immune system would be to make sure that if there is phages that are in circulation, that are from bacteria that we do not want, that are foreign to our symbiosis, that our immune system better damn well be aware of it.

01:21:19.403 --> 01:21:39.431
And I think that's where if you say that you're going to inject something here, and you're going to augment this system when you don't even understand its primary purpose, you don't even understand the primary players in the symphony and what you're purporting to augment by producing antibodies to it.

01:21:43.453 --> 01:21:47.435
When antibodies primary function may be to mop up bacterial

01:21:48.601 --> 01:21:53.663
bacterial toxins associated with bacteria that are not part of our symbiosis.

01:21:53.703 --> 01:21:55.824
The symbiosis being the pattern integrity.

01:21:56.325 --> 01:22:04.308
You are a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time and you cannot augment this beautiful symphony by squirting shit here.

01:22:06.329 --> 01:22:13.893
That's my best way of saying that intramuscular injection is not a biologically sound way of administering medicine.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.163
Let's go back to the video and fix that.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:18.405
Hope that helped.

01:22:25.146 --> 01:22:27.767
So does everyone know what the Cutter incident was?

01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:47.097
So in 1954, Cutter Labs made a polio vaccine that was supposed to be an inactivated vaccine, and it wasn't adequately inactivated.

01:22:49.704 --> 01:22:56.726
Problem with this argument is, is that means that adequately inactivated vaccines are fine and that's bullshit.

01:22:57.466 --> 01:23:04.688
Um, when they were doing the, the vaccine trials, I mean they weren't trials, but they were rolling it out and they rolled it out.

01:23:05.389 --> 01:23:13.611
I know for sure in Idaho, cause that's where I lived and I got that vaccine and I'm a cutter kid and um,

01:23:15.154 --> 01:23:24.796
It, you know, there's, I'm fine, but when I get really tired, I still can feel the effects of having received that vaccine.

01:23:26.056 --> 01:23:26.476
Wow.

01:23:26.516 --> 01:23:27.917
That is a testimony boy.

01:23:27.997 --> 01:23:31.357
She got the cutter vaccine and she's got chronic fatigue from it.

01:23:31.457 --> 01:23:31.777
Damn.

01:23:32.437 --> 01:23:35.298
In terms of just being nervous, nerve, nerve jumpy.

01:23:35.798 --> 01:23:37.779
You know, I don't do well when I'm exhausted.

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:44.660
And, um, my mom told me that it was the scariest part of her motherhood.

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:54.197
Nevertheless, I grew up and went to nursing school and had my first career as an intensive care nurse.

01:23:55.217 --> 01:23:59.840
Then, I met some friends from Africa who were here as AIDS scholars.

01:24:01.934 --> 01:24:07.777
I met them because I love to dance and they told me that I should go into epidemiology.

01:24:08.737 --> 01:24:13.840
And I had to hand write my application because I was computer illiterate.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:17.322
But for whatever reason, the University of Washington let me in.

01:24:18.282 --> 01:24:22.464
And I graduated in epidemiology and totally by fluke.

01:24:23.505 --> 01:24:28.387
They needed somebody at the local health department in the middle of the Jack in the Box outbreak.

01:24:29.341 --> 01:24:33.863
And that wasn't what I was gonna do with epidemiology because I'm an anthro undergrad.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.765
And I was gonna do... Jack in the box was bacteria, by the way.

01:24:39.405 --> 01:24:42.546
Sociocultural epidemiology studies.

01:24:43.366 --> 01:24:46.308
But I fell in love with infectious disease.

01:24:47.288 --> 01:24:52.310
And... And... Who wouldn't?

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:56.011
You know, I mean... And I've been doing it ever since.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:56.632
And...

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:05.670
the immunization coordinator at the health department where I was working was also doing the disease surveillance.

01:25:06.291 --> 01:25:09.773
And so I started doing that part of her job.

01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:22.120
So what I've done over the last almost 25 years is it's my job to know about the diseases for which a vaccine has been developed.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.422
It's my job to know how the disease presents.

01:25:26.568 --> 01:25:30.371
And so I'm a surveillance epi for vaccine preventable diseases.

01:25:31.432 --> 01:25:37.416
And I, every call, every phone call I get is an adventure.

01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:40.759
I want to talk to whoever is on the phone.

01:25:41.239 --> 01:25:43.060
I want to answer their questions.

01:25:43.641 --> 01:25:46.703
I want to make sure they have the resources that's needed.

01:25:47.632 --> 01:26:12.641
And I want all of you to realize that there are thousands of people like me across the country who really want to be a good public servant and who really want, who really want people to have whatever they need, whatever's causing their discomfort about

01:26:14.315 --> 01:26:21.420
She said that she fell in love with infectious disease and she got a clapping ovation with laughter.

01:26:23.561 --> 01:26:28.104
This lady is not sophisticated enough to understand that she's part of the machine.

01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:30.566
This is what I would call an unwitting participant.

01:26:30.606 --> 01:26:32.247
I don't know why they accepted me.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:43.995
They accepted you because they knew you weren't sophisticated enough to see through the bullshit, that you were just smart enough to learn what they told you, and that you would be happy to go around and do what you're doing right now.

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:54.980
Especially if you have somebody like James Lyons Wyler and Mary Holland whispering into your ear and sending you phone calls and text messages.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.423
The situation they're in, we want those resources to get out there.

01:26:59.984 --> 01:27:08.771
And what I would really love is if people could just do a check when you're saying our side and their side.

01:27:09.772 --> 01:27:11.233
And what does that even mean?

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:15.751
What does that even mean, indeed?

01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:23.016
That's the question that I have when I see the frickin' shit that's going on right now.

01:27:23.156 --> 01:27:25.057
It really pisses me off, okay?

01:27:25.498 --> 01:27:26.858
Because this is not right.

01:27:27.579 --> 01:27:28.520
It's not right.

01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:33.623
It is absolutely, positively not right.

01:27:41.186 --> 01:27:52.340
It is absolutely positively not right that dollars went to CHD and CHD made banners that says rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies.

01:27:55.424 --> 01:27:56.845
It doesn't even make sense.

01:27:58.487 --> 01:27:59.609
What is the message?

01:28:01.505 --> 01:28:11.569
At some point in time, either this is a big deal, or it's just, you know, who's better, LeBron James or Michael Jordan.

01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:21.413
Either it's an argument without consequence, and it doesn't really matter what your opinion is, or you freaking know the answer!

01:28:22.473 --> 01:28:23.414
Do you see this?

01:28:26.038 --> 01:28:27.579
There is no other way to see it.

01:28:27.659 --> 01:28:28.659
We are in a trap.

01:28:28.839 --> 01:28:47.966
It is a hamster wheel for your mind and it is maintained by people like her, but even worse by coordinated liars like Mary Holland and, and Meryl Nass and James Lyons Weiler and Brian Hooker and all these other people who damn well knew better.

01:28:49.431 --> 01:29:01.160
There is no other explanation for the audio that I have of Brian Hooker saying he doesn't use the word autism other than they convinced him to use the word autism to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.162
in the White House, and he went along with it.

01:29:04.892 --> 01:29:09.634
because it wasn't to save kids from suffering the damage that his kid had.

01:29:10.014 --> 01:29:15.976
It wasn't to save parents from suffering the horrible trials that he's gone through as a father.

01:29:16.336 --> 01:29:19.497
That apparently is fine because Polly cured her kid.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:25.540
And Jenny McCarthy cured her kid.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:27.320
Great.

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.081
Thank you very much.

01:29:28.921 --> 01:29:30.762
And Andrew Wakefield is a hero.

01:29:32.182 --> 01:29:32.862
I'm coming your way.

01:29:32.962 --> 01:29:33.423
I'm coming your way.

01:29:33.463 --> 01:29:34.123
We've got a question here.

01:29:36.618 --> 01:29:42.882
Hi, first I want to say the two answers about the homeopathic no-sodes.

01:29:42.922 --> 01:29:50.026
I'm a naturopathic physician, and when you asked the question, I kind of braced myself, and your answers were awesome and made my day.

01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:51.166
Thank you so much.

01:29:54.148 --> 01:30:09.642
Today I heard a lot of kind of vilifying generalizations about doctors and how we approach vaccines and how we approach talking to our patients about it and I totally understand those generalizations because that's what a lot of people experience when they go to their pediatricians.

01:30:11.003 --> 01:30:16.548
I was wondering if you knew or honestly anybody here of a way that

01:30:17.569 --> 01:30:27.993
Physicians who are more like minded to what we're talking about here a way that we can become more visible Is there an organization we can join that has our name somewhere?

01:30:28.773 --> 01:30:39.177
It's a little bit I feel dangerous to kind of blatantly advertise that you're okay with not Vaccinating because you'll get trolled somebody might report you But if there's any other way

01:30:40.774 --> 01:30:41.735
informed consent.

01:30:42.135 --> 01:30:50.279
Well, I went to that website right away and it says that if you register and join, your name's not going to be shared with anybody.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:58.844
Well, if you indicate your intention to be shared, you can become advisor and then your name will appear there if you don't want to be anonymous.

01:30:58.944 --> 01:30:59.484
Well, perfect.

01:30:59.564 --> 01:30:59.964
Thank you.

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.085
There's another way to do that.

01:31:02.606 --> 01:31:08.369
There are, I think, three different sites that host online lists of vaccine-friendly doctors.

01:31:10.567 --> 01:31:18.546
Can you add me to a list of people that somebody like Elon Musk could use to tailor my social media so that I never realize that I'm being played?

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.401
That's essentially what she asked for.

01:31:22.881 --> 01:31:31.724
And that's essentially what we do when we join CHD's website or we support them even, or we join ICANN or say, yes, put me on the emailing list.

01:31:32.164 --> 01:31:37.166
Essentially, you've just put yourself on a list of people that needs to be controlled on social media.

01:31:37.586 --> 01:31:40.527
And social media allows that because you know what you know.

01:31:40.547 --> 01:31:43.928
Do you know what you know when you scroll on your phone?

01:31:44.428 --> 01:31:45.609
You know what you see.

01:31:46.704 --> 01:31:47.144
That's it.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:53.546
And every single person on earth sees something different on their phone social media.

01:31:54.366 --> 01:31:59.508
No two feeds are the same and they can be tailored by programming.

01:31:59.588 --> 01:32:01.228
It's not an algorithm.

01:32:01.368 --> 01:32:03.949
Virality on the internet is a lie.

01:32:04.009 --> 01:32:05.069
It's a mythology.

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.590
It's the same mythology.

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:11.171
Things can go viral and so can RNA.

01:32:11.911 --> 01:32:13.232
Stop lying.

01:32:16.425 --> 01:32:21.388
So make sure that you and everyone you know who falls in that category.

01:32:21.468 --> 01:32:31.355
So a vaccine-friendly doctor is someone who maybe gives vaccines, but is friendly to families who want to individualize or customize the schedule.

01:32:31.675 --> 01:32:34.877
So one is- Individualize or customize the schedule.

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:42.562
Instead of hitting them three times in one day, maybe you can hit them on both sides of the head, and then we'll come back in a couple weeks and we'll hit them with the third one.

01:32:44.485 --> 01:32:46.706
Of course, that's that guy, Paul Thomas.

01:32:46.766 --> 01:32:55.431
That was his claim to fame for these last 10 years, that he has a alternative schedule with a few less shots, and they're a little later.

01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:59.893
You know, when their skull is harder, so the bat doesn't hurt so much.

01:33:00.663 --> 01:33:03.445
Dr. Bob Sears as the other is naturally Nicole's.

01:33:04.186 --> 01:33:09.330
And then the third one is, I think that- You know, in reality, it's not a totally terrible argument.

01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:12.913
If you've got to inject shit, you should inject it later.

01:33:12.973 --> 01:33:14.153
Of course, that's true.

01:33:14.594 --> 01:33:16.295
I would make that argument in spades.

01:33:16.756 --> 01:33:25.642
Your life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, and you can screw up that trajectory much worse the earlier you bump it.

01:33:26.063 --> 01:33:26.983
That's for sure.

01:33:27.003 --> 01:33:28.525
I totally agree.

01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:37.929
It would be best if we could get rid of all the injections until they're four and then probably a lot of the worst stuff would go away.

01:33:38.309 --> 01:33:45.213
But we would still kill people and we would still in neurologically injure people and the worst case scenario for absolutely for sure.

01:33:45.733 --> 01:33:50.655
Especially if we decided that they still needed 72 shots we were just going to start them at year four.

01:33:52.396 --> 01:33:53.997
So without a doubt

01:33:55.305 --> 01:33:58.107
This is a limited spectrum of debate.

01:33:58.147 --> 01:34:01.269
If you say that, well, we'll just give it to the pattern integrity later.

01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:03.011
Yes, that is true.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:13.478
Then if the cruise ship was going from New York to Spain and you change the course of the ship really early, you could get it to go all the way to South Africa.

01:34:13.518 --> 01:34:20.223
But if you waited too long, the only thing you could really do was change whether it went into the Mediterranean or it went North of Spain.

01:34:20.283 --> 01:34:20.704
That's it.

01:34:21.803 --> 01:34:23.063
And you can see that, right?

01:34:23.804 --> 01:34:32.667
And so sure, that's an argument that makes biological sense, but it is an argument that nevertheless assumes that intramuscular injection is a good idea.

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.627
We should just apply it later.

01:34:34.927 --> 01:34:40.189
But this cartoon doesn't change for your entire fricking life.

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:45.231
So it doesn't matter if you're 80 years old or eight days old.

01:34:45.691 --> 01:34:51.413
This cartoon still means that injecting at the star is a biologically ridiculous idea.

01:34:53.732 --> 01:34:55.473
Damn, I'm kicking some butt today.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:58.415
Paul Thomas is also hosting a site.

01:34:59.936 --> 01:35:00.476
There he was.

01:35:00.516 --> 01:35:01.877
You heard the name, Paul Thomas.

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:03.799
I just want to say thank you, first of all.

01:35:04.599 --> 01:35:09.362
I've really resonated with many things that you guys have said, especially you, a fellow nurse.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:10.403
I'm also a nurse.

01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:12.691
and I've seen both sides.

01:35:13.771 --> 01:35:28.656
I've also had a vaccine reaction myself and luckily it's documented and it gets me an exemption from getting the flu vaccine every single year in my job, which I get a form to sign that has statements that say, you know, you know, you're

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:41.701
You're making your patients susceptible, other people susceptible, you know, and I always end up saying I'm signing this under duress, you know, or as some statement, as you've said, I haven't had to sign one in a long time.

01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:43.922
There's one particular hospital that had to sign those.

01:35:44.403 --> 01:35:51.386
But anyhow, I had a question about,

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:53.926
These are strategy meetings.

01:35:54.366 --> 01:36:09.749
These are strategy meetings that they had to have before the pandemic happened so that they would know exactly how and exactly what the arguments are and be practiced with it and understand how to do it and know how to make sure that people never fell out of the hamster wheel.

01:36:11.049 --> 01:36:13.990
That the merry-go-round or the Ferris wheel never stopped.

01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:16.910
Every time they came down to the bottom, okay, I think we're gonna get off now.

01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:18.191
Nope, we're going back up again.

01:36:19.251 --> 01:36:20.171
That's how this works.

01:36:21.431 --> 01:36:43.537
and understand that they had to be doing this before the pandemic because these people were crucial to making sure the conservative right in America, once they really understood that the pandemic was bullshit, would be corralled into a limited spectrum of debate that would still be politically useful and controllable.

01:36:45.362 --> 01:36:53.470
And Elon Musk bought X and that whole theater happened to make sure that people thought the truth was being given away on X so that for sure they could be controlled by it.

01:36:55.272 --> 01:36:58.455
We were assimilated, ladies and gentlemen, that's what happened.

01:36:58.516 --> 01:36:59.717
We got assimilated.

01:37:02.003 --> 01:37:05.025
And I'm sorry I was in and out earlier.

01:37:05.045 --> 01:37:07.546
I had my baby here but my husband took him home.

01:37:08.006 --> 01:37:09.047
I don't know if I missed it.

01:37:10.727 --> 01:37:16.910
I remember reading that the pertussis vaccine is causing

01:37:18.351 --> 01:37:21.833
people who've been vaccinated to be more susceptible to getting pertussis?

01:37:22.413 --> 01:37:28.377
And I don't know if any of you are familiar with that study or can speak to that.

01:37:28.597 --> 01:37:28.797
Yeah.

01:37:29.217 --> 01:37:40.564
So the study that came out of CDC, they were looking at two different strains of pertussis and how they're distributed between patients.

01:37:40.724 --> 01:37:42.745
Why do they have this Ukrainian lady?

01:37:42.785 --> 01:37:44.526
Because she's the Kevin McKernan.

01:37:45.698 --> 01:37:49.542
Auditioning for the role or maybe she decided not to do it for the pandemic.

01:37:49.622 --> 01:37:50.042
I don't know.

01:37:50.723 --> 01:38:00.352
I don't know where she went But she is the the stupid complicated version of the dumb simple opposite with with James Lyons Wyler

01:38:02.079 --> 01:38:13.189
This is remarkable and I've watched a couple other hours of her and I've become very, very convinced that this Rockefeller, Harvard, Stanford scientist, doctor is a plant.

01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:18.074
She makes it more complicated than it is and it is very, very simple.

01:38:18.494 --> 01:38:21.737
That's why I can draw a diagram like this and nobody can argue with it.

01:38:23.067 --> 01:38:25.167
Even Joshua Lederberg wouldn't argue with that.

01:38:25.228 --> 01:38:30.689
He would love that explanation for my boundaries of the individual.

01:38:30.729 --> 01:38:40.431
And in fact, the idea of drawing the boundaries around the microbiome and including that as part of ourselves was Joshua Lederberg's idea.

01:38:44.712 --> 01:38:45.192
Get some.

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.341
or pertussis cases that have been vaccinated versus not.

01:38:50.221 --> 01:39:00.344
And the strain, which is pertuctin negative, that's what it is called now, seems to be affecting- I'm gonna cut it right here.

01:39:01.884 --> 01:39:13.948
I think it's really important to remind you again, yesterday I showed you a video from October 10th, 2020, of that same character that was just on stage, James Lyons Weiler, staging a speech

01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:44.851
Pro Trump speech in October 10th 2020 at the heart of when the murder really was gonna pick up We just had some local murder in New York in in Earlier in 2020 and now we were gonna spread it all around the United States for the first winter and James Lyons Weiler gave this speech Our third expert that traveled from not New York or Michigan, but right here from the Pittsburgh area here in Pennsylvania

01:39:45.747 --> 01:39:59.137
This guy's been on stage at every CHD event I've ever been at, and he plugs his eye pack, and I believe with absolute certainty that he is a 100% meddler, liar, traitor to our children.

01:40:00.358 --> 01:40:01.139
One of the worst.

01:40:01.219 --> 01:40:08.304
I want to thank the media for being here, and thank everyone online for sharing this across all social platforms.

01:40:09.348 --> 01:40:12.991
I'm an objective research scientist, and I have two main points that I want to drive home.

01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:14.633
The first one is the number 21%.

01:40:15.313 --> 01:40:17.775
I want you to remember that number and write it down.

01:40:17.795 --> 01:40:20.818
It's a very, very important number to you if you're an American citizen.

01:40:21.298 --> 01:40:27.623
The second thing, and I'll get to that in a minute, the second thing that I want to say is I'm not here in support of any particular bill.

01:40:27.663 --> 01:40:31.406
I run a not-for-profit, and I can't say yay or nay on my opinion.

01:40:31.446 --> 01:40:38.472
What my personal opinion is is muted, and I don't mind that, but I can condemn the politicization of your health.

01:40:38.905 --> 01:40:47.251
The politicization and the commoditization of the American citizens' health, Pennsylvania citizens' health, is not a commodity.

01:40:47.651 --> 01:40:52.154
It is neither a monetary commodity nor is it a political commodity.

01:40:52.694 --> 01:41:05.323
And shame on you if you have changed your position or held onto a position in the light of evidence from data from studies that tell you that your position is wrong simply because you disagree with President Trump.

01:41:06.063 --> 01:41:07.244
I don't even know what he said there.

01:41:07.264 --> 01:41:08.485
I don't even know what that means.

01:41:09.617 --> 01:41:15.840
Ignoring papers just because you disagree with Donald Trump Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna make a bold statement here.

01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:39.132
But if you didn't miss if you missed it, this guy was in Pittsburgh and I'm gonna go so far as to say In October of 2020 was when I was told to not come in anymore Turn in your badge and keys you're fired this guy moved from Pittsburgh to Michigan because they knew that I was trying to contact him and

01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:47.732
And they knew that if I ever got in touch with this guy, I would know exactly how much of a bullshitter he was within an hour of spending time with him.

01:41:48.252 --> 01:41:51.792
And since he was in Pittsburgh, I could have gone over to his fricking house.

01:41:54.073 --> 01:42:02.615
And by the time he replied to me, to my emails, that I was telling him that I worked at the same university of Pittsburgh as you, dude.

01:42:02.975 --> 01:42:04.475
And I got fired, dude.

01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:08.196
He had moved to Michigan.

01:42:10.188 --> 01:42:13.249
And he wanted me to teach a course in his IPAC university.

01:42:17.129 --> 01:42:18.010
I know it sucks.

01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:27.111
It really sucks to be me because I'm like, I've seen a UFO and I have to keep telling everybody that I've seen the UFO and I'm not happy about it.

01:42:27.151 --> 01:42:39.134
I don't like to have to say that this guy is actually as bad as he is, but knowing that he's as bad as he is makes me feel obligated to the rest of my fellow citizens in America to tell them.

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:50.142
the same way I feel about Mary Holland, the same way I feel about the Truman Show victim, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the same way I feel about the poser, Jay Bhattacharya.

01:42:50.970 --> 01:43:05.798
who tried to pretend to be my friend for three years and specifically told me to stop talking about Robert Malone because he was about to be nominated for NIH director and I should, you know, stop talking about people and just talk about biology.

01:43:06.238 --> 01:43:12.322
These people are part of something that is not for my children or yours.

01:43:12.582 --> 01:43:16.324
It is about the controlled demolition of America.

01:43:17.222 --> 01:43:25.846
And maybe the pandemic was the start of the lighting of the fuse, you know, like it's now on and all of these people know it.

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:27.907
And they're all think that they're on the arc.

01:43:28.908 --> 01:43:32.230
They all think they got an all access laminate.

01:43:32.290 --> 01:43:33.710
And that's why they're doing this.

01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:36.512
Otherwise you can't explain this behavior.

01:43:37.639 --> 01:43:39.279
His language won't get any better.

01:43:39.299 --> 01:43:41.580
He's not going to be more succinct in his message.

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:42.660
Shame on you.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.040
You're hurting people.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.581
You're hurting society.

01:43:45.841 --> 01:43:47.061
You're destroying businesses.

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:48.041
Shame on you.

01:43:49.882 --> 01:43:51.682
Now that I got that out, I can talk about some science.

01:43:52.822 --> 01:43:52.922
OK.

01:43:53.322 --> 01:44:00.004
Historically, coronaviruses, vaccines for coronaviruses have had a terrible safety record.

01:44:01.884 --> 01:44:06.285
There is a condition known as disease enhancement due to pathogenic primates.

01:44:07.213 --> 01:44:09.495
And this was discovered in vaccinated animals.

01:44:09.695 --> 01:44:16.181
So he's renaming something that is called antibody dependent enhancement and those are actually papers that exist.

01:44:16.261 --> 01:44:25.910
So here already you can see that he's being a jackass because this pathogenic priming is a term that only he uses.

01:44:25.930 --> 01:44:26.891
Understand how bad that is.

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:47.320
In my peer-reviewed research paid for the citizens of the United States of America through donations to IPAC, prior to the development of any COVID vaccines, I found that all but one of the proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 virus have what we call unsafe epitopes.

01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:54.374
right, which are parts of proteins that are capable of causing immune conditions, autoimmune conditions.

01:44:54.434 --> 01:44:55.955
This is exactly on narrative.

01:44:55.995 --> 01:45:06.702
Remember that there is a company called EpiVax that Robert Malone used to work for that looked very specifically for special epitopes that could activate the immune system and guarantee a good response.

01:45:07.102 --> 01:45:14.467
And so he's telling the flip side of that story, which that we can look at proteins and remove the dangerous epitopes that might have some kind of

01:45:15.127 --> 01:45:17.869
added danger to people and we could make a safe vaccine.

01:45:17.909 --> 01:45:23.753
And so again, what he's slipping in here is this assumption that we need vaccines, that vaccines can work.

01:45:23.813 --> 01:45:25.254
It's just that sometimes they don't.

01:45:25.654 --> 01:45:36.581
And so if we knew everybody's genetic background and we knew better, you know, which, which people are susceptible to heavy metals, then the people that are fine with heavy metals can still get those vaccines and we can make other vaccines for other people.

01:45:37.002 --> 01:45:41.845
This man is absolutely positively a traitor to my children.

01:45:42.445 --> 01:45:43.646
In immune responses,

01:45:44.341 --> 01:45:45.962
against proteins in our own body.

01:45:46.623 --> 01:45:51.087
This is peer-reviewed research, and I'll be happy to provide the press with a reference after this.

01:45:51.947 --> 01:46:00.674
About a third of the proteins that might be targeted by autoimmune conditions by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, either through infection or injection.

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:06.499
His pronunciation of COV and COVID is an admission that he worked with Robert Malone to get this story.

01:46:06.979 --> 01:46:11.903
I guarantee you Robert Malone is another one of the people that is definitely a traitor to my children.

01:46:12.864 --> 01:46:13.925
Target the immune system.

01:46:14.548 --> 01:46:23.175
But from the start, it looks like this virus has evolved the ability to attack our immune system as part of its disease-causing capacity.

01:46:23.935 --> 01:46:32.562
This pathogenic priming, I predicted in my study which parts of the human body would likely be most affected by pathogenic priming.

01:46:32.802 --> 01:46:35.544
Just this random guy in Pittsburgh, he predicted everything.

01:46:35.584 --> 01:46:36.425
He knew everything.

01:46:36.465 --> 01:46:37.866
He knew of the fear and cleavage site.

01:46:37.886 --> 01:46:39.047
He knew of all of it.

01:46:39.087 --> 01:46:41.368
He was even on Chinese news.

01:46:41.508 --> 01:46:42.049
Come on!

01:46:43.676 --> 01:46:48.360
This guy, the environmental and genetic causes of autism guy.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:55.086
This guy, the guy who says that vaccine-preventable diseases are spreading asymptomatically among the people that are vaccinated.

01:46:56.127 --> 01:47:00.150
This guy who says that we're gonna be stuck with artificial vaccination forever.

01:47:00.190 --> 01:47:04.094
I guess we're gonna have to find an alternative organic vaccination then to help out.

01:47:05.395 --> 01:47:08.718
Then we'll just educate everybody and hope everybody chooses organic, right?

01:47:09.438 --> 01:47:10.739
Stop lying!

01:47:13.533 --> 01:47:19.477
And now studies by medical physicians, by medical teams around the world are confirming my predictions.

01:47:19.998 --> 01:47:24.801
This is not simply a respiratory virus with respiratory symptoms.

01:47:25.222 --> 01:47:26.142
This affects many.

01:47:26.263 --> 01:47:31.086
He is claiming to be one of the smartest and most insightful biologists on earth.

01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:32.307
Make no mistake about it.

01:47:32.467 --> 01:47:37.291
Tissues across the body and there's some grave concern if you're going to get infected.

01:47:38.027 --> 01:47:47.279
Also make no mistake about the fact that in July of 2020, I already said that they were misconstruing a background as spread in order to take advantage of the collapsing dollar.

01:47:49.342 --> 01:47:54.769
And then I was still employed by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and they still didn't know what the hell to do about me.

01:47:57.418 --> 01:48:00.720
But where's the grave concern if you're going to be injected with these same proteins?

01:48:01.101 --> 01:48:11.608
Not a single, to my knowledge, not a single vaccine manufacturer took heed of my warning to remove those unsafe epitopes from the vaccines before they formulated their vaccines.

01:48:11.948 --> 01:48:16.471
Well, I mean, you know, they're all reading his blog, so I guess they're just ignoring his advice.

01:48:17.092 --> 01:48:25.157
In spite of being emailed my study with a plea to please consider taking out those unsafe epitopes, your body has 500,000

01:48:26.858 --> 01:48:28.798
peptides throughout your life.

01:48:29.779 --> 01:48:32.419
The coronavirus has something like 28 proteins.

01:48:32.459 --> 01:48:38.300
What's the probability that there's going to be many proteins that match at small segments of immunogenic epitopes?

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:48.862
Don't forget that those 27 proteins, many of them have multiple functions, according to virologists like Robert Malone and David Baltimore.

01:48:48.982 --> 01:48:49.603
Very high.

01:48:51.223 --> 01:48:56.444
We now have results from frontrunner vaccines from these hybrid trials where they skipped over the animals trials,

01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:09.645
FDA, in absolutely ignoring safety margin, in a stunning decision, decided to allow Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers to skip the most... This is all fake, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49:09.665 --> 01:49:14.747
The lady that was on screen with them in 2017, this is her name.

01:49:14.767 --> 01:49:16.308
You can search for that.

01:49:16.328 --> 01:49:17.749
You can see where she did her thing.

01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:21.890
She has a book called The Vaccine Illusion that is still available on...

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:27.854
on Amazon and did I set this up right?

01:49:28.394 --> 01:49:28.974
Maybe I did.

01:49:29.034 --> 01:49:30.055
Did I set this up right?

01:49:30.175 --> 01:49:30.695
No, I didn't.

01:49:31.236 --> 01:49:31.936
So let me go back.

01:49:31.996 --> 01:49:34.958
I wanted that to fly away and get out of the way.

01:49:35.578 --> 01:49:36.779
So let me just get it smaller.

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:43.002
But if you look at what Amazon dishes up, you can only get it on Kindle.

01:49:44.083 --> 01:49:45.824
And so you got to listen to that.

01:49:45.944 --> 01:49:46.884
Otherwise you can't get it.

01:49:46.964 --> 01:49:49.486
And then look what they give you for books afterward.

01:49:50.066 --> 01:49:50.747
Paul Thomas.

01:49:51.744 --> 01:49:57.866
Suzanne Humphreys, the Turtles All the Way Down book, which was essentially promoted by Steve Kirsch.

01:49:59.367 --> 01:50:00.808
Jack Stockwell, I don't know.

01:50:02.108 --> 01:50:03.409
Neil Miller, I don't know.

01:50:04.509 --> 01:50:11.332
Mark Bailey, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and then here's another Bailey book.

01:50:12.514 --> 01:50:14.535
Or she'd the forward is by Sam Bailey.

01:50:14.915 --> 01:50:15.775
Can you catch a cold?

01:50:16.555 --> 01:50:19.516
So Amazon doesn't have any problem with any of these books.

01:50:19.556 --> 01:50:20.416
These aren't scary.

01:50:20.456 --> 01:50:21.236
This is the truth.

01:50:21.316 --> 01:50:22.576
Apparently, it's just free.

01:50:22.596 --> 01:50:25.177
You know, I will not free you can buy them.

01:50:25.217 --> 01:50:26.817
Some of them are 65% off.

01:50:27.417 --> 01:50:30.318
Mark Bailey's book is 65% off.

01:50:30.378 --> 01:50:31.918
It's only $7 now.

01:50:32.879 --> 01:50:34.779
What a what a great that's awesome.

01:50:34.859 --> 01:50:36.900
Wow, that's just great.

01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:37.460
Good for him.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.660
I think that's awesome.

01:50:40.086 --> 01:50:41.267
Resuming slideshow.

01:50:41.808 --> 01:50:44.571
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:54.802
And if you need to say it a little more gentlemanly way, you can say intramuscular injection is not a biologically justifiable way to administer medicine to a healthy person.

01:50:55.855 --> 01:51:09.946
And you can learn the biology of ingestion versus injection and compare all of the ways that we could avoid toxins that we ingest versus all the ways we can't avoid toxins when we are injecting them.

01:51:09.986 --> 01:51:16.150
And you'll understand what I was trying to say with this figure over here, and I'll teach this until I'm blue in the face.

01:51:16.190 --> 01:51:19.012
It's not the perfect diagram yet, so I'm still working on what to do.

01:51:19.032 --> 01:51:23.736
I was born in 1998, and virtually every vaccine

01:51:24.196 --> 01:51:26.818
that he received that could have samarasol.

01:51:26.878 --> 01:51:34.362
Samarasol is the mercury-containing organic preservative that they used in vaccines and still use in some instances.

01:51:34.742 --> 01:51:39.825
But he had a very, very high... So keep in mind that this could already be Brian

01:51:41.186 --> 01:51:55.588
on a script because he says it's mercury and there was a lot of mercury and so he seems to simplify it to the fact that if there wasn't so much mercury and he hadn't taken so many shots that he might not have reached a toxic tipping point and then gone into neurological damage.

01:51:56.149 --> 01:52:01.591
And so it may be that right now we're still trying to figure out how to deal with this problem, how to talk about it.

01:52:02.052 --> 01:52:05.993
And Brian Hooker is one of those people who's trying to figure out how to deal, how to talk about it.

01:52:06.033 --> 01:52:11.456
And one of the ways that he deals with it right now in 2013 is that he doesn't use the word autism.

01:52:11.496 --> 01:52:13.377
And for that, I admire him.

01:52:13.817 --> 01:52:16.858
The dose of, uh, for Marisol and his infant vaccines.

01:52:17.499 --> 01:52:22.141
And then, uh, he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months.

01:52:23.483 --> 01:52:28.307
and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

01:52:28.427 --> 01:52:29.988
I don't like the word autism.

01:52:30.869 --> 01:52:31.930
He was vaccine damaged.

01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:33.711
He was neurologically damaged.

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:49.343
And so just like every pharmaceutical company and every global health project would love, the Human Genome Project fits right into the Human Genome Project, and it's very easy for you to conceive that these people would work together.

01:52:50.290 --> 01:53:00.353
to enslave the world, you know, the United Nations, the WHO, the Aspen Institute, any of these companies would be happy to contribute to the enslavement of all of mankind.

01:53:01.351 --> 01:53:06.275
All the people that own social media, of course, have global reach.

01:53:06.615 --> 01:53:11.939
And so they have global influence that they can sell around the world that we can change.

01:53:12.079 --> 01:53:13.280
We can change history.

01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.861
We can change people's opinion.

01:53:15.282 --> 01:53:17.303
We're worth millions of votes.

01:53:17.363 --> 01:53:27.851
They know that this is a global power, not that dissimilar to the noosphere that was invented or imagined by Pierre, sorry, Teilhard de Chardin.

01:53:28.752 --> 01:53:44.037
And Teilhard de Chardin is this guy who talked a long time about how the Catholic Church might be the, you know, the group that would take control of the evolution of the species essentially by being one global consciousness.

01:53:45.138 --> 01:53:56.582
And so what we're dealing with here is a very scary Truman Show where people behind the scenes have taken advantage of other people's desires or dreams to save America

01:53:57.788 --> 01:53:59.649
and used them and played them like a fiddle.

01:54:00.469 --> 01:54:02.630
And I think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:08.573
probably at one time was a good guy and thought he was fighting for good things and really believed in the legacy of his father.

01:54:09.013 --> 01:54:11.955
And a lot of liars have taken advantage of that belief.

01:54:13.055 --> 01:54:16.237
And after 20 years of consistent lying, we are where we are.

01:54:17.199 --> 01:54:38.225
where Casey Means is the Surgeon General, where Vinay Prasad is going to be the head of biologics, where a clown like Marty McCarty, a surgeon, is the head of the FDA, where a person who deferred to me repeatedly in our interview a couple years ago as the biologist and economist is the head of NIH.

01:54:42.412 --> 01:54:43.913
It's all by design, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:43.933 --> 01:54:47.996
They took a background and they misconstrued it as spread, told us an elaborate mythology.

01:54:48.036 --> 01:54:49.237
And this is for all the marbles.

01:54:49.277 --> 01:54:50.558
It's for the grandchildren of earth.

01:54:50.998 --> 01:54:53.520
That's why there's a fake vaccine movement in America.

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.763
You can figure it out by thinking about this background as irreducible.

01:54:58.223 --> 01:55:03.287
And so using PCR on that background with no controls, I mean, come on, that's a joke.

01:55:03.327 --> 01:55:05.088
It's a nonspecific PCR test.

01:55:05.528 --> 01:55:10.252
And as long as you believe that it's finding something, and as long as all these people agree that it is,

01:55:10.712 --> 01:55:27.340
then the illusion is complete and everybody agrees from Mike Yeadon to Sasha Latupova to Kevin McKernan all the way to Kevin McCairn everybody agrees that PCR works to find this novel virus and it's been trackable for five years stop

01:55:27.981 --> 01:55:28.361
Lying!

01:55:28.862 --> 01:55:31.024
RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:31.144 --> 01:55:37.509
And if you use their tests to find their ghosts, you're not making their ghosts real, nor does that make you a hero or a ghost buster.

01:55:37.969 --> 01:55:41.432
They use placebos to make it safe because intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:55:41.472 --> 01:55:42.953
Thanks for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:43.374 --> 01:55:44.194
I love you very much.

01:55:44.635 --> 01:55:46.776
I'll see you again soon.

01:56:36.423 --> 01:56:38.007
I'm sorry, I just love that clip.

01:56:38.368 --> 01:56:42.497
The way that that guy fires that engine up at the end with one last rev.

01:56:43.159 --> 01:56:44.301
Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
