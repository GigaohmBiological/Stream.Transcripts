WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
Very sorry for the late start but

00:56.760 --> 01:02.400
No janitor kicking us out of the gym tonight, so I got here pretty late

01:03.800 --> 01:10.400
But I'm a little committed to the streak in this stage, so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to sustain it

01:10.400 --> 01:15.120
But I'm feeling it now. I just gotta be conservative and get it done

01:26.320 --> 01:28.320
I

01:31.120 --> 01:35.160
Got a lot of work done today though. Holy man did I get a lot of work done today?

01:36.240 --> 01:41.800
and then I had practice at seven thirty until nine and then

01:42.800 --> 01:44.800
we got home

01:46.560 --> 01:48.560
Actually, I'm gonna change my hat right now

01:56.320 --> 01:58.320
I

02:00.520 --> 02:05.040
Gotta figure out how to cut that little that's sure you scheduled for 16 minutes next

02:05.840 --> 02:11.000
He's going on French British Italian Japanese television

02:12.040 --> 02:16.520
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing

02:26.320 --> 02:28.320
So much

02:56.320 --> 02:58.320
Oh damn

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
True Drew good to see you

03:26.320 --> 03:29.160
Pamela

03:56.320 --> 04:12.760
Well here we are again, I feel like I've got to give them, you know

04:12.760 --> 04:17.320
I got to give them a little airtime because I want to be fair and balanced

04:17.320 --> 04:24.960
I think there's some TV program or some news channel. It's fair and balanced. I like the sound of that fair and balanced

04:24.960 --> 04:26.960
Hey mark what's going on?

04:27.480 --> 04:31.280
That guy's been up to his eyeballs and concrete lately, I think

04:32.360 --> 04:34.360
He's a beastly man that mark

04:44.920 --> 04:50.720
Yes, this is going biological a high-resistance low noise information brief. It's the 17th of November

04:51.440 --> 04:52.720
2023

04:52.720 --> 04:59.520
We are still trying to fight our way out of this limited spectrum of debate that these people have held us in

05:00.320 --> 05:04.360
that have sort of reinforced the views of the system and

05:04.880 --> 05:06.880
We've got to fight our way out

05:07.160 --> 05:13.280
Fair and balanced is the Fox News Network. Well, I don't know. I guess I could be a worse company, right? I don't know

05:13.280 --> 05:15.280
I

05:18.200 --> 05:23.480
See this face sliding back there behind our history keep sliding back there and then he's gone again

05:23.480 --> 05:28.160
I keep seeing there he goes again. See him. I saw the simple step we can take and our

05:28.640 --> 05:31.140
We can encourage our family and friends to take

05:31.680 --> 05:33.680
Is to not take part in the lion

05:35.880 --> 05:41.000
That that that's something that we can ask all of our family and friends to consider

05:41.560 --> 05:44.600
Just stop perpetuating the lies stop testing

05:45.120 --> 05:47.480
Stop talking about it like it's out there

05:48.240 --> 05:52.240
Stop pretending like the only reason why you wash your hands is because of cold

05:53.120 --> 05:59.880
Stop pretending that the only reason why you're concerned about your health is because of COVID. That's just ridiculous

06:00.720 --> 06:04.120
You should have been done eating better for 20 years already

06:04.640 --> 06:08.920
He should have been taking care of your body already for the last 20 years. That's the problem

06:09.920 --> 06:15.520
So many of us owe a debt to our to our body and we need to pay it back

06:19.200 --> 06:24.720
Yeah, anyway the brick wall at the back of theater is definitely visible. I know you can see it

06:25.400 --> 06:28.840
It's just a question of how can we teach it to our family and friends?

06:28.840 --> 06:31.400
I think a really good way to say it is challenge people to

06:32.040 --> 06:37.080
Explain why there's no evidence of spread in New York City get them to explain why

06:38.080 --> 06:40.080
The spread didn't cross borders

06:41.120 --> 06:43.840
Tell them that lockdown is not a good enough reason

06:44.560 --> 06:48.240
Infectious clones are the only real threat. We've got a we've got a I admit

06:48.240 --> 06:53.240
I've got to do a little bit better teaching that biology in the next couple weeks thumbnail that don't worry

06:54.000 --> 06:55.880
placebo batches were likely distributed

06:55.880 --> 07:00.680
I think everybody understands why that could screw things up and in transfection healthy mammals is dumb

07:01.560 --> 07:06.400
Sometimes you just got to say it like it is like protocols for murder gain a function is a mythology

07:07.400 --> 07:14.720
Scooby-Dooers is real and the layers are committed to lies. It's a spectacular commitment to these lies right here

07:15.200 --> 07:22.000
Lies about a novel virus lies about millions of people being killed by it lies about millions more being saved from it

07:22.720 --> 07:28.760
Lies about gain a function being a real thing and lies about viruses that will come again

07:28.760 --> 07:38.000
This is giggle and biological. That's right giggle and biologicals of information brief brought to you by a biologist

07:38.480 --> 07:41.720
Who sometimes feels like he's trapped on a starship

07:44.040 --> 07:48.280
Sometimes it hasn't been it's been a while since I've felt trapped on a starship. I guess that was

07:49.080 --> 07:51.080
And I owe you another one I didn't

07:54.480 --> 07:56.480
Didn't switch out all this

07:58.760 --> 08:00.760
There we go

08:03.640 --> 08:11.880
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey, and this is giggle and biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist in the back of his garage

08:11.880 --> 08:13.880
It is the 17th of November

08:14.080 --> 08:18.600
2023 it is 8 after 10 in the evening where I am and

08:19.240 --> 08:24.920
I am very thankful for the people that subscribe and share the work of giggle and biological

08:24.920 --> 08:28.840
Our general message is usually the same

08:29.920 --> 08:32.640
Don't take the bait on TV and social media

08:34.280 --> 08:39.880
Because it is not a matter of what's true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true

08:39.880 --> 08:45.280
That's kind of an awkward quote, but it's from a very very very influential man

08:47.200 --> 08:52.280
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

08:52.680 --> 08:55.720
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent

08:56.240 --> 09:02.440
These two phrases are a little bit more skippy and a little bit more zippy and they're from somebody who nobody knows or cares about

09:02.680 --> 09:09.600
But I assure you there the biological principles that they talk about and stand for are solid as a rock and

09:10.320 --> 09:15.880
You can tell a lot from someone if they talk about me and they don't talk about this slide right here

09:15.880 --> 09:18.280
They're basically not talking about my work

09:18.800 --> 09:24.800
Because everything else that I'm gonna present over the next weeks and months and maybe even years is

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
Gonna be biology that more or less

09:28.280 --> 09:30.720
Edifies these ideas that are to my

09:31.480 --> 09:33.000
stage

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
right

09:35.000 --> 09:36.440
Anyway

09:36.440 --> 09:38.440
That's the end of that show

09:38.440 --> 09:41.760
I think I've got another show somewhere, right?

09:42.560 --> 09:44.560
Do I have another one of these somewhere

09:44.560 --> 09:53.440
Or did I save that one as a funny one now I was gonna do this one I guess so

09:56.360 --> 09:58.360
We are on this Scooby-Doo kick

09:59.200 --> 10:06.480
And it is a real Scooby-Doo kick in the sense of trying to help people to understand what was done to them

10:06.480 --> 10:09.840
Sorry for that rough transition from music to no music

10:10.680 --> 10:16.040
I think it's really important as we approach Thanksgiving to try and give it one more world

10:16.760 --> 10:21.200
In terms of really selling this to the people that don't really get it yet

10:23.560 --> 10:30.360
It is much more convincing to brainwash someone by getting them to think that they solved a puzzle

10:31.600 --> 10:35.000
you can imagine fooling four and five-year-olds by

10:35.680 --> 10:42.160
Making them feel like they're solving a puzzle and then they could really come to the conclusion that wow those footprints on the floor

10:42.160 --> 10:45.960
I mean that there is a monster in the house somewhere and oh wow the

10:46.440 --> 10:49.360
Close on the floor mean that wow they might they might have

10:49.760 --> 10:55.920
They might have went through your stuff and oh wow look the food on the counter means that they must have stolen some food

10:55.920 --> 11:00.040
And they ate it and then oh the back door is open so they must have went out the back door

11:00.040 --> 11:02.040
And

11:02.520 --> 11:09.320
So then when they go out by outside and they find that I don't know the barbecue is on you can also convince the kids that wow

11:09.320 --> 11:15.480
that monster that went through the house that left the footprints that ate the cookies and then went out the back door also lit the barbecue and

11:17.640 --> 11:21.320
Now imagine a scenario where an intricate

11:22.960 --> 11:26.720
combination of bureaucrats programmed for an emergency and

11:27.720 --> 11:31.920
And media scared into believing there's an emergency and

11:32.720 --> 11:37.120
secret meetings being used to orchestrate the response to and

11:38.080 --> 11:41.640
coordinate the the censorship of the response to

11:42.520 --> 11:45.520
this new perceived emergency and

11:46.960 --> 11:52.320
Now imagine if they had rehearsed it five six seven times at a table and

11:53.120 --> 11:55.120
two or three times for real

11:55.760 --> 11:57.760
How good would we be at this?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
how how

12:00.480 --> 12:04.840
Accurately would be it would we be able to execute it now what I want you to imagine is

12:05.680 --> 12:09.160
That successful execution of this theater

12:09.920 --> 12:15.440
results in huge shifts in power huge transfers of wealth and

12:16.240 --> 12:22.400
So now is the impetus on the system to allow mother nature to dictate how and when this occurs

12:23.040 --> 12:25.920
Or do you think it's much more likely that at some point?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.560
This might be the way that we are governed

12:29.440 --> 12:33.160
That the system itself would say well, we're not going to wait for mother nature

12:33.960 --> 12:39.480
To cause all these changes to happen to cause all this wealth to shift to cause all this power to

12:40.400 --> 12:42.400
be available

12:43.160 --> 12:45.160
We'll just simply orchestrate it ourselves

12:46.160 --> 12:48.160
And it would be so easy

12:48.920 --> 12:50.920
so easy to do it

12:51.880 --> 12:58.600
Because again these plans these emergency plans these contingency plans have been rehearsed and orchestrated

12:59.560 --> 13:04.680
and gamed at tables and exercises over the last two or three decades

13:06.280 --> 13:08.280
And those of you who know your history

13:08.520 --> 13:16.280
Know very well that that's exactly what they've been doing for a very long time and it's very hard to differentiate what we are now experiencing from

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Just such an exercise

13:19.960 --> 13:26.120
where the combination of a controlled media and a well-brief bureaucracy and

13:27.200 --> 13:34.040
a national security apparatus capable of dictating behavior to those levels of governance

13:35.480 --> 13:42.120
Simply by saying that certain things are classified certain things are required certain security measures are currently in place

13:43.160 --> 13:48.700
And so therefore you can only say certain things and we have to consider the worst case scenario as a distinct

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
possibility on the table

13:51.000 --> 13:52.600
and

13:52.600 --> 13:58.680
Once the worst case scenario is the distinct possibility on the table. We are right where they want us

13:59.800 --> 14:05.080
Once as a society we have accepted that they declared an emergency for a good reason

14:05.960 --> 14:11.360
That the reason that they declared the emergency is actually a bona fide danger that could have happened again and

14:12.360 --> 14:16.240
That we learned some things worked and some things didn't and we have to improve

14:16.880 --> 14:22.000
Before the next one happens then we are essentially accepting this faith right here in pink

14:22.480 --> 14:27.200
There was a novel virus millions of people died from it. More millions more were saved from it

14:29.440 --> 14:33.840
The very scary possibility is is that it came from a gain of function laboratory

14:35.040 --> 14:38.400
And therefore a virus like this one or even worse could come again

14:40.720 --> 14:42.720
And people as

14:43.680 --> 14:49.760
Varied as Rand Paul Tony Fauci Peter Dasek Richard Ebright

14:52.720 --> 14:54.720
Kevin Esfelt

14:55.280 --> 15:01.440
Jonathan Cooley in 2020 in 2021 Brett Weinstein now Robert Malone now

15:02.640 --> 15:05.760
Are all in perfect agreement that this is the truth

15:07.440 --> 15:12.240
So many people are excited that massy passed a bill that ban gain of function

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
And

15:14.880 --> 15:20.560
By banning it you make it even more real because if it wasn't real, why would you need to ban it?

15:24.800 --> 15:31.280
And so this carries on as the Scooby-Doo continues we are continually being reinforced that

15:32.320 --> 15:33.760
you know

15:33.760 --> 15:37.840
More and more people on both sides of the aisle are coming to the conclusion that this was a lab leak

15:38.720 --> 15:41.920
And now what you're going to find very stunning ladies and gentlemen

15:43.680 --> 15:49.280
Is that as we approach this wall of obfuscation and this wall of medlers

15:51.600 --> 15:57.600
And right now this wall of medlers actually doesn't have any of the no virus crew on it

15:58.800 --> 16:01.040
I think we're about to hear a video today

16:02.720 --> 16:08.640
That is essentially going to say almost what i've said up until now in this very video from Sam Bailey

16:08.640 --> 16:10.640
And

16:10.640 --> 16:13.680
So i'm i'm really interested when i'm going to find i'm

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
cautiously optimistic

16:17.120 --> 16:22.320
But again, there are a few patterns of behavior with these people that I need you to understand are not

16:22.880 --> 16:24.880
congruent with them

16:24.880 --> 16:26.880
wanting to

16:26.880 --> 16:28.880
Save as many people as possible

16:30.160 --> 16:32.560
And the most striking one is their

16:34.000 --> 16:35.840
unwillingness

16:35.840 --> 16:38.560
to really defend their position

16:39.600 --> 16:45.680
Under any circumstances that are more or less equal or free they have to be completely defined by them

16:46.320 --> 16:48.880
And you have to agree to certain terms

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
and certain boundaries

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
and certain topics

16:54.400 --> 16:55.600
And

16:55.600 --> 16:58.960
The best example I can have is uh, dr. Malick

16:59.680 --> 17:00.720
um

17:00.720 --> 17:06.960
Dr. Amad Malick is a podcast that i've been on he's a little bald guy from the uk really sweet

17:08.800 --> 17:10.720
Really sweet gentleman

17:10.720 --> 17:16.480
And he was going to have sam bailey on his show actually a couple weeks before he had me on his show

17:17.360 --> 17:22.080
And at some point apparently she found out that he was not a no virus

17:22.560 --> 17:27.360
Person that he was open-minded about the existence of sars kobe 2

17:27.920 --> 17:30.240
And she promptly canceled her interview with him

17:31.440 --> 17:34.560
And so again here you see there's a certain

17:36.880 --> 17:42.560
There's a certain dubiousness to their behavior and so i'm as I said i'm cautiously optimistic and open-minded

17:42.560 --> 17:48.160
And I since I want to have this be a rather efficient stream and it's already 10 20 minutes after 10

17:48.960 --> 17:51.600
I'm just going to see what we can do here with this one now

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
Do I have it already? Yes, I do

17:55.920 --> 17:57.920
But it's just on this one

17:57.920 --> 17:59.920
I'll just move it over here

18:25.040 --> 18:27.040
You

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
You

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
You

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
You

20:25.040 --> 20:27.040
You

20:55.040 --> 21:05.600
Children's health events were added again with fear-based narratives about lab engineering viruses

21:06.160 --> 21:10.880
They reported that in his new book deception the great covid cover-up

21:11.360 --> 21:17.280
Senator rand paul details the catastrophic failures of the public health emergency during the pandemic

21:17.760 --> 21:22.800
Addressing the gain of function research funded in part by the us government paul claims dr

21:22.800 --> 21:30.240
Anthony fauci and his scientific yes men not only knew the sars kobe 2 virus originated at china's wuhan institute of

21:30.240 --> 21:35.760
irology but worked to cover it up and attack anyone threatening to reveal the truth

21:36.240 --> 21:41.040
You may get the feeling that many people have been deeply asleep during the past four years

21:41.600 --> 21:45.360
Mentioned two weeks to flatten the curve and you'll get a blank look

21:45.920 --> 21:50.240
Even from those that dutifully repeated the foolish metro back in 2020

21:50.880 --> 21:55.440
Those espousing the lab like cover-up story also seem to be missing things

21:56.080 --> 22:03.440
Or they have forgotten that in early 2020 it was one of the narratives being promulgated by the mainstream media

22:04.000 --> 22:07.920
For example, the some published a story in april that year that stated

22:08.400 --> 22:14.960
It was revealed earlier this month ministers fear the deadly pandemic could have started after a leak from a lab

22:15.680 --> 22:21.440
USan british intelligence officials suspect bungling scientists at the wuhan institute of virology

22:21.840 --> 22:26.160
Accidentally spread the color during risky coronavirus tests on bats

22:26.720 --> 22:33.120
The story included a map showing the proximity of the institute to the huwanan seafood market

22:33.440 --> 22:40.800
And photographs said to be from inside the facility that were openly published by china daily the state run media platform

22:41.120 --> 22:45.680
But shh it's all top secret folks then in 2021

22:45.760 --> 22:52.720
We had the united states senate chiming in as though there was a lab leak cover-up going on and apparently caught red-handed

22:52.960 --> 22:55.520
Big tech platforms were now reversing the censorship

22:56.000 --> 23:00.800
We know that facebook recently reversed their decision

23:01.520 --> 23:05.440
on taking down any kind of information

23:05.920 --> 23:09.360
That said it came from the lab in wuhan

23:09.840 --> 23:15.680
So the overt product placement has been done since 2020 through the mainstream media

23:16.080 --> 23:23.200
Politicians and big tech but the lab leak proponents think that this is something that the public is not supposed to know about

23:24.160 --> 23:29.760
Lab leak nonsense has continued to be splashed across corporate media headlines in 2023

23:30.320 --> 23:34.320
And yet somehow the so does anybody really know whether she's

23:35.200 --> 23:42.720
She or her husband or tom kowen or any of these other people have actually tied it together like this before

23:43.440 --> 23:50.800
I've never heard her say it as explicitly as the lab leak was set up to

23:52.160 --> 23:59.440
From the beginning to be a theater to make people think that the pandemic was occurring and that the only debate was whether it was a natural

23:59.440 --> 24:01.440
Virus or whether it was a lab leak

24:02.160 --> 24:08.560
She seems to be saying that now, but I I don't get the feeling that they have been saying this from

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
from the start

24:13.600 --> 24:17.120
And I don't know how long they've been saying it or whether they're actually absorbing

24:17.920 --> 24:21.680
some of the things that our side has been saying now and

24:22.560 --> 24:28.960
Kind of making it sound as though, you know, since 2020 we've known that this was it's different

24:31.440 --> 24:35.440
It's a different kind of claim right and I I hope you can see that that if

24:37.920 --> 24:41.040
If the theater was the primary operation

24:42.400 --> 24:47.200
Then it is still very dangerous to harp on there are no viruses. There are no viruses

24:47.200 --> 24:53.120
There are no medicines. We don't need medicine and all this other stuff if really what they lied about was the pandemic

24:54.080 --> 24:56.080
So i'm still trying to figure out

24:56.880 --> 24:58.880
I

24:58.880 --> 25:01.040
Yeah, I'm I'm confused. I mean look here

25:04.640 --> 25:06.000
I

25:06.000 --> 25:09.360
I think it's really cool. She said the PCR test in the very beginning

25:10.240 --> 25:16.320
She said that in 2021 the lab leak narrative was pulling a lot of this story along as she had this music on

25:16.320 --> 25:18.400
I didn't really understand. That's why I wrote that there

25:19.040 --> 25:22.640
She points out that the emails the papers and everything they don't mean danger

25:22.640 --> 25:26.080
It doesn't mean these things are being made it certainly doesn't mean they're creating

25:26.720 --> 25:33.280
Gain a function or rather. They're not creating pandemic potential in the laboratory and I've said that I've got slides of it for many many

25:34.000 --> 25:36.400
many months if not a year or more now

25:38.000 --> 25:42.400
when these people have tried to harass me and tried to you know

25:43.680 --> 25:45.280
get me

25:45.280 --> 25:47.280
They attacked me quite

25:47.760 --> 25:50.560
Quite more than they needed to when really I was trying to

25:51.520 --> 25:55.680
In a way point out to them that you know, we're really not that far off

25:58.720 --> 26:03.040
They they talk about the Rand Paul book when I just talked about two days ago. I mean, okay, that's great

26:03.680 --> 26:09.040
So first the lab leak then the cover up then the censorship theater. I mean we're all talking about the same stuff now

26:10.720 --> 26:17.280
And I have been saying the scooby-doo for a while now and before that I was still telling it like this so

26:18.240 --> 26:22.320
I'm totally on this page. I'm just not on the page of

26:23.360 --> 26:24.880
of

26:24.880 --> 26:29.920
How it's being said here. I don't know it's it's strange to me. It feels very conceited or something, but

26:31.120 --> 26:32.560
I don't want to

26:32.560 --> 26:38.960
Maybe it's just the New Zealand accent to make it sound like that likes of Rand Paul are portraying this as a high level cover up

26:39.600 --> 26:45.920
One thing that has been consistent during the covid era is the blanket censorship and suppression

26:46.320 --> 26:48.080
Of the no virus arguments

26:48.720 --> 26:56.320
I am unable to post covid related content on my youtube channel and even my video on polio was banned after just six minutes

26:56.800 --> 27:02.480
For the past four years my viewers have informed me that simply posting a link to one of my videos

27:02.720 --> 27:05.440
Can result in a suspension of their facebook account

27:06.080 --> 27:10.960
Meanwhile the proponents of the gain of function narratives can post links to the new york times now

27:11.520 --> 27:18.880
Rand Paul's entire analysis has a fatal flaw and that is taking the virologist claims at face value

27:19.200 --> 27:22.320
He does not examine the methodologies being employed in virology

27:22.720 --> 27:30.560
So he runs with words like isolation and gain of function to sustain the narrative that an infectious disease causing particle

27:30.800 --> 27:34.880
Has been physically isolated and then modified to make it even more dangerous

27:35.360 --> 27:39.280
In reality, nothing of the sort has ever been demonstrated

27:39.840 --> 27:45.680
As well as covering the work of ron fuscié, ralf barrack and petitacic in videos

27:46.080 --> 27:50.880
My husband mark also discussed the lab leak fallacy in a farewell to virology

27:51.280 --> 27:53.360
His formal refutation of the virus model

27:53.760 --> 27:58.880
We have broken down these papers numerous times to expose their pseudoscientific nature

27:59.120 --> 28:01.760
That pervades the entire field of virology

28:02.320 --> 28:09.600
In their promotional piece on rand paul when they stated the gain of function research funded in part by the u.s

28:09.680 --> 28:14.080
Government chd provide a link to an article by dr. joseph mccollar

28:14.320 --> 28:17.920
They posted on the website in april 2022. This was titled

28:18.720 --> 28:21.520
1000 plus document make make no mistake about it

28:22.480 --> 28:30.320
This is the second time now. She's mentioning chd in particular and she is mentioning it without actually calling it children's health defense

28:30.960 --> 28:32.960
Without actually saying what they do

28:35.120 --> 28:38.160
Now to me, this is spectacular because again

28:38.400 --> 28:47.360
They've been on chd multiple times chd has held the defender has held some kind of podcast with them and maryll nasse and a few other people before

28:48.880 --> 28:54.320
And they've talked to david or david resnick before and or if that's that that's that guy's name

28:55.120 --> 29:03.520
They've they listened to everybody chd has people on that I I wouldn't necessarily say they should have on but they they talk to everybody

29:05.280 --> 29:12.800
And so it's almost like biting the hand that feeds you and you know, you can barely get your message out anywhere and one of the few places

29:13.600 --> 29:19.600
That is willing to get your message out. You just constantly send emails to people complaining that

29:20.400 --> 29:28.000
You don't that they don't back you or that they don't give you enough credence or that they're not saying exactly what they should say

29:28.560 --> 29:30.400
Who are they're giving?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.160
You know airtime or attention to the gain of function narrative. I

29:34.960 --> 29:37.680
Can't say I totally disagree with some of that

29:41.200 --> 29:47.760
But it's like pick your battles like what what are what do they what do they really want to have happen here?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.480
It's it

29:50.480 --> 29:51.920
to me

29:51.920 --> 29:57.600
Putting this on the screen, but not really just trying to make I guess they think they've already done it

29:57.600 --> 30:01.840
Right the the farewell to virology is their thing and it's checkmate and so

30:02.720 --> 30:06.400
The way that they win arguments is that they wave that around and they say well

30:07.360 --> 30:11.600
If you've read that and you don't submit to us then I guess you're an idiot

30:12.480 --> 30:14.480
and I have read it

30:15.200 --> 30:17.200
And the papers that they choose

30:17.760 --> 30:19.760
They refute them great

30:20.000 --> 30:26.560
They say that the papers don't definitively show isolation of viruses or purification of viruses

30:28.480 --> 30:32.080
But some biological phenomenon is going on there that we can sequence

30:33.600 --> 30:35.840
That shows up in these reactions

30:38.880 --> 30:45.040
And it's just unfortunate that really it seems to be an all-out denial of molecular biology

30:46.000 --> 30:48.800
So they they go to old papers

30:49.760 --> 30:53.920
And they can show you that these old papers aren't showing any direct evidence of anything

30:53.920 --> 30:56.880
They're just showing indirect evidence of some phenomenon

30:57.600 --> 31:01.120
That those authors clearly didn't understand totally agree

31:03.520 --> 31:05.520
But now to be

31:06.320 --> 31:12.080
Sort of slam dunking the ball without wanting to figure out what really happens what really is going on here

31:12.640 --> 31:15.360
What are these signals?

31:16.560 --> 31:19.200
What is this biology? They just want to throw it all out

31:19.200 --> 31:22.800
Well, never mind all of immunology silly all of medicine is silly

31:22.800 --> 31:26.720
We should just eat better food and exercise and drink water and everything will be fine

31:29.280 --> 31:35.200
Irrespective of whether we're being transfected by air or sea or food or water

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
or lipid nanoparticle or

31:38.960 --> 31:40.640
or

31:40.640 --> 31:43.200
vaporized virus-like particles

31:45.520 --> 31:49.760
This part of the no virus thing is what's frustrating

31:50.800 --> 31:53.840
Because what they want you to believe is it's all lies

31:55.760 --> 31:58.800
When we know that they've been trying to weaponize

31:59.440 --> 32:02.320
DNA and RNA for more than 20 years

32:03.680 --> 32:06.640
They've been trying to weaponize these small

32:07.520 --> 32:10.960
packets of information for more than 20 years

32:12.400 --> 32:14.240
And so they may not be very good at it

32:15.120 --> 32:17.520
They may not be able to do it with very high fidelity

32:19.040 --> 32:24.080
But I assure you they can make things that will annoy your immune system. I assure you they can make things that will

32:25.200 --> 32:27.680
Disrupt physiology in your body

32:28.880 --> 32:32.480
And these may not be viruses. They may not replicate very well

32:33.200 --> 32:36.160
They may not do all the things that virology says they do

32:37.120 --> 32:39.120
But

32:40.640 --> 32:46.720
But I think that they can be used to orchestrate fear frustration confusion and even

32:47.760 --> 32:51.600
Real biological signals that molecular biologists can find and

32:54.640 --> 32:57.120
And confound into a pandemic

32:59.440 --> 33:02.720
And I really feel as though there's a lot of

33:03.360 --> 33:05.360
There's very little rather

33:05.360 --> 33:09.680
Attempt at making forward progress with people understanding what's going on

33:10.720 --> 33:15.440
And it's a lot of attacking and whining and and arrogance

33:18.000 --> 33:23.600
And knowing that they won't have a conversation with you unless you agree that there are no viruses or unless you start by

33:24.320 --> 33:31.120
Having to argue about farewell and farewell to virology. You can't have a conversation with them as you start there first

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
I

33:35.760 --> 33:39.280
If you wanted to talk about what health freedom means they would first want to say

33:39.280 --> 33:43.440
Well, do you believe in viruses or not because if you don't believe if you believe in viruses

33:44.320 --> 33:48.080
Or you believe in infectious clones like that crazy dr. Cooley guy

33:48.960 --> 33:50.560
Then uh

33:50.560 --> 33:52.560
Then no, we don't want to talk to you

33:53.280 --> 33:56.000
And this is really not this is the problem

33:57.600 --> 34:01.040
And so this is the second time now we're bringing up chd

34:02.000 --> 34:05.520
Even though we're just reposting joe marcola here who

34:06.240 --> 34:10.720
You know, I don't know if joe marcola is a good guy or a bad guy, but he certainly seems to be

34:11.600 --> 34:16.640
A patriot and doesn't seem to really uh, I don't know. I just I can't believe

34:18.800 --> 34:25.200
That's revealed disturbing details about high risk. I'm very surprised that that chd is even in this video

34:25.280 --> 34:28.880
That's what I'm that's what I'm you're seeing me deal with right now because

34:29.680 --> 34:35.760
Gigo and biological supposed to be my show and it's not I've been trying very hard not to

34:37.360 --> 34:42.400
Cross over too much and when I have crossed over it's always it's always

34:43.360 --> 34:45.040
sketchy

34:45.040 --> 34:51.600
As to whether it's good idea or not and so I didn't really expect a second article to be in this video

34:51.680 --> 34:55.360
And so I'm a little frustrated by that, but I'm going on and a function experiments

34:55.680 --> 35:00.320
But what exactly was it referring to an investigative report by vanity fair?

35:00.880 --> 35:07.520
I kid you not mccolla and the chd think that vanity fair are going to reveal the truth about

35:08.320 --> 35:10.320
to the public

35:21.440 --> 35:25.200
This wasn't the first time vanity fair had presented this narrative

35:25.520 --> 35:30.080
In fact, they published a huge feature article in july 2021

35:30.720 --> 35:37.520
If you read this article you will see it contains nothing more than talk about people who talk about viruses

35:38.160 --> 35:44.240
These peripheral stories about politics grants and government documents may be fascinating for the naive

35:44.640 --> 35:47.920
But it is all fluff when you are looking for scientific evidence

35:48.560 --> 35:55.520
Where is the virus the second vanity fair expose the one referred to in the mccolla chd article

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
suffers from the same problem

35:58.240 --> 36:03.600
Amongst the a hundred thousand plus documents. Where do we find any evidence for a virus?

36:04.240 --> 36:06.960
Halfway through the article we do see a citation

36:07.440 --> 36:14.160
The author states that she Zengli and a preeminent coronavirus researcher at the university of north carolina

36:14.480 --> 36:20.720
Ralph barrack mixed components of sars like viruses from different species and created a novel chimera

36:20.800 --> 36:23.120
That was able to directly infect human cells

36:23.840 --> 36:28.640
And the paper they linked to is this one that appeared in nature medicine in 2015

36:29.280 --> 36:34.720
A sars like cluster of circulating back coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence

36:35.360 --> 36:41.920
So this is the evidence they are presenting for a virus existence and laboratory engineering of such claimed viruses

36:42.720 --> 36:44.720
Let the day section begin

36:44.800 --> 36:50.640
As with any virology paper, you don't get distracted by the title or the abstract which contain

36:50.880 --> 36:56.320
Venceful claims. You need to focus on the ticklish spot, which is the method section

36:56.960 --> 37:03.280
Here we find it opens by stating wild type sars co v urbani mouse adapted sars co v

37:03.760 --> 37:11.440
M a 15 and chimeric sars like co v's were cultured on zero e six cells obtained from united states army medical research

37:11.920 --> 37:13.440
of infectious diseases

37:13.440 --> 37:15.840
So right here the whole thing falls apart

37:16.480 --> 37:20.880
They are claiming that they already know they have viruses in the starting samples

37:21.440 --> 37:26.720
Without establishing anything of the sort they can then state that the culture cells were quote

37:27.200 --> 37:31.280
Inoculated with virus see so that's really it's sad

37:33.120 --> 37:36.560
It's really sad because if we go back to this

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
Those are three clones

37:42.560 --> 37:44.560
So

37:46.080 --> 37:52.320
They're just saying it right here wild type sars co v urbani a clone

37:54.080 --> 37:56.080
A cDNA clone

38:00.080 --> 38:09.040
It's transferred made into RNA and put on cultured on zero e six cells. That's exactly what they do

38:09.760 --> 38:11.760
They have another clone

38:11.920 --> 38:20.160
Of a mouse adapted sars co v which is ma 15 they make RNA they put it on the zero six cells

38:21.360 --> 38:25.680
That's culturing the virus. That's how you culture a clone

38:28.480 --> 38:33.760
And those cells spit out exosomes with that RNA in it like

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
It's that simple

38:37.200 --> 38:40.080
They can even do it with the circular dna and tr and

38:40.960 --> 38:42.960
electropyrated into the

38:42.960 --> 38:48.240
Vero six cells and then have the Vero six cells make it into RNA and and put it out

38:48.880 --> 38:50.880
But I don't I don't know if that works

38:51.680 --> 38:57.680
I really think they take the dna and they make it into RNA. That was that infectious RNA on the Vero e six cells

38:58.240 --> 39:00.080
That's how it's done

39:00.080 --> 39:02.080
That's the standard cloning method

39:02.480 --> 39:08.240
So the wild type sars or banny which is named after the guy who got infected by that virus

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
And the first patient

39:11.920 --> 39:16.480
And that's a clone of his of the sequence of the sars

39:17.040 --> 39:20.240
One that he was infected with it's a clone in dna

39:21.360 --> 39:25.440
They can send that dna anywhere. They can also grow that dna in a plasmid

39:26.000 --> 39:28.320
Or a series of plasmids five I think

39:29.040 --> 39:30.240
in

39:30.240 --> 39:33.440
Bacterial dna or bacterial chromosomes grow it up

39:34.480 --> 39:36.400
Ligate it back together

39:36.400 --> 39:40.880
And then they can convert that to RNA and put that on cell culture. They that's how they do it

39:44.720 --> 39:46.720
They have viruses and the starting samples

39:47.360 --> 39:52.640
Without establishing anything of the sort they can then state that the culture cells were quote

39:53.120 --> 39:55.120
And inoculated with virus

39:55.440 --> 40:00.640
In reality, they're not inoculated with virus. So here she's going to see it. She's going to say it as clones right here

40:00.720 --> 40:06.640
See they have a mixture of culture cells proteins and genetic sequences along with fetal serum

40:06.960 --> 40:09.520
Some antibiotic and antifungal agents

40:09.920 --> 40:15.280
The nonsense then gets on stilts with the section construction of sars like chimeric viruses

40:15.680 --> 40:22.640
Here they claim to be making a quote and features clone by using spike sequences from their samples along with quote

40:23.120 --> 40:27.120
Six contiguous complementary dna's using published sequences

40:27.840 --> 40:33.440
Don't take your eye off the ball here. These sequences have never been shown to come from a virus

40:33.680 --> 40:43.440
They have simply been fraudulently classified as viral on genetic data banks from processes that never physically isolated any viruses

40:43.680 --> 40:46.640
Okay, but she's right about that, but that doesn't matter

40:47.440 --> 40:52.560
As i've tried to explain they find RNA and dna's signals

40:53.440 --> 40:55.280
in the wild

40:55.280 --> 41:01.040
And the only way to find out what these signals might do be they exosomes or or waste or

41:01.600 --> 41:04.400
Horror packets of information or noise

41:05.840 --> 41:10.160
Is to make a clone of them put them on a cell culture and see what they do

41:11.680 --> 41:13.680
Do they replicate or not?

41:14.160 --> 41:20.560
Guess what? Ralph barracks already figured out it seems that if you have a certain minimum

41:22.240 --> 41:24.240
gene set

41:24.720 --> 41:31.600
This RNA dependent RNA polymerase and rf1a and a couple others you basically have self replicating RNA

41:33.680 --> 41:39.200
They don't understand it, but that's what they found in these in these samples. That's how I understand it

41:40.160 --> 41:42.800
And so if they make a dna copy of it

41:42.800 --> 41:47.440
They can make enough of that RNA and then put it in a cell culture. It seems to replicate for a little while

41:49.280 --> 41:55.360
If they run a gel they actually see the RNA replicating, but it makes a lot of

41:56.160 --> 42:01.120
Subgenomic RNA so they don't really fully understand how the system works

42:02.240 --> 42:05.680
But they get a few full genomes. It seems to replicate

42:06.400 --> 42:08.400
It's kind of cool

42:08.480 --> 42:10.480
I admit that they don't understand it

42:10.960 --> 42:15.040
But I can tell you for absolute certain that using this six

42:15.760 --> 42:21.360
These little dna after the plasmids containing the wild type genome frameworks are amplified exercise ligated and purified

42:21.920 --> 42:28.960
In vitro transcription reactions were then performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA. I assure you

42:30.800 --> 42:36.320
That these people are capable of making this full-length genomic RNA in some quantity

42:37.280 --> 42:40.000
And if they start with a dna

42:41.040 --> 42:48.000
Plasmids and they grow it up in bacteria and then they ligate it with specific enzymes. I assure you they can do that

42:51.280 --> 42:53.280
Molecular biology is real

42:54.640 --> 43:00.080
Refuting what occurs when they make these sequences and then cells

43:00.800 --> 43:06.240
Start to react to these sequences of being being being transfected to these sequences

43:07.120 --> 43:13.600
By exporting them, expelling them, packaging them, whatever you want to call it

43:15.120 --> 43:18.960
If that's not viral replication, I'm totally down with that

43:21.440 --> 43:24.640
But if they found a way to use zero-six cells to

43:25.680 --> 43:27.680
to package

43:28.480 --> 43:29.920
full-length

43:29.920 --> 43:31.920
self-replicating RNA

43:32.640 --> 43:35.600
And then they can for a little while play with it in a laboratory

43:36.960 --> 43:41.040
And they can make quantities of it and spray it around in the in the air

43:43.600 --> 43:46.640
Then I assure you that they can transfect people with it

43:48.240 --> 43:53.680
And you don't have to believe in any viruses being in the wild save an occasional

43:54.400 --> 43:55.600
you know

43:55.600 --> 43:59.200
RNA that gets into you and gives you some symptoms. I mean

43:59.760 --> 44:02.560
It's hard for me to imagine that people are so insistent that

44:03.040 --> 44:07.600
They've never they've been sick, but they themselves don't believe that it passes all this other stuff

44:08.720 --> 44:10.720
You got to throw out a lot of

44:11.200 --> 44:13.200
of grandmother's wisdom

44:13.840 --> 44:15.840
to believe that there aren't

44:18.080 --> 44:20.080
Contagious

44:20.080 --> 44:21.840
symptomologies

44:21.840 --> 44:30.560
Whether these contagious symptomologies are transferred by RNA or DNA noise from one kind specific to another is a question that needs answering

44:31.520 --> 44:33.520
But there's no question that the

44:34.640 --> 44:36.640
the substrate exists

44:36.880 --> 44:45.280
There's no question that that substrate exists. There's no question that the immune system needs to either be responsive or tolerant to that substrate

44:47.760 --> 44:54.960
If you want to say that that substrate is largely benign and that we don't it's not full of pandemic potential. I'm all about it

44:56.240 --> 44:59.360
But if you're going to sit here and say that for the last 40 years

45:00.080 --> 45:02.080
the people who have been working on

45:02.560 --> 45:07.920
the basics on how to ligate DNA together and how to work with basic DNA

45:08.880 --> 45:18.080
Molecules and how to make large quantities of of DNA molecules that they somewhat understand the composition of I'm afraid I've got you lost me there

45:22.480 --> 45:29.280
Because it isn't an illusion that some of these geneticists have this idea that we are really close to being able to do

45:29.360 --> 45:31.360
something useful

45:31.920 --> 45:34.560
Because we are starting to get tools that are

45:36.000 --> 45:39.920
Surprisingly accurate in their application to a certain extent

45:39.920 --> 45:48.320
And so it is easy to imagine a future where these tools will become precise enough to be used for certain limited applications given our

45:49.360 --> 45:51.920
Limited understanding of how these things work

45:54.320 --> 45:58.720
But you must see how deceptive it is if you're just so dismissive

45:59.440 --> 46:02.400
to all of the molecular biology here that you can't

46:03.120 --> 46:05.120
usefully differentiate between

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
the exaggeration

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
of a natural phenomenon

46:10.160 --> 46:16.000
That's RNA and DNA floating around and calling it pathogens calling it pandemic potential

46:18.320 --> 46:24.800
And and kind of going like oh wow, that's that's a little far far fetched and saying it's all lies even this

46:25.600 --> 46:28.560
They can't make a lot of DNA

46:29.040 --> 46:32.800
They can't make a lot of DNA of the sequence that they want

46:33.280 --> 46:38.160
They can't make a lot of DNA of the sequence they want and then turn it into RNA. No, they can't

46:38.960 --> 46:40.960
Of course they can

46:42.960 --> 46:49.280
And so even if these self replicating RNAs aren't something that exists in the wild in any quantity or something that

46:49.840 --> 46:53.600
They are making up out of whole cloth. They can do it like this and lie about it

46:54.880 --> 46:58.400
And those cells may very well package exesomes full of this

46:59.360 --> 47:02.240
subgenomic RNA and full genomes and cause

47:02.960 --> 47:06.720
immunogenic reactions and all this other stuff, but what are they doing then?

47:08.240 --> 47:10.240
They're not just playing here

47:12.480 --> 47:16.640
If you believe that there are no viruses in the wild and that this is evidence of it

47:16.640 --> 47:20.480
And you believe that they are telling stories about gain of function and this is evidence of it

47:20.960 --> 47:24.880
Then you must explain this and the best most parsimonious

47:25.600 --> 47:27.600
forward-looking

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
evil acknowledging

47:30.320 --> 47:35.440
Explanation is that this is just a massive cover-up for them trying to find ways

47:36.400 --> 47:39.680
To advance their understanding of genetic technologies

47:41.360 --> 47:48.560
So they got these self replicating RNAs and they say that they found them in the wild so that they can pretend that they're working on wild things

47:49.360 --> 47:55.760
When in reality they could be goofing around in the laboratory with self replicating RNAs that they call viruses

47:55.760 --> 47:57.760
But this is really technology

47:58.800 --> 48:03.120
And the way they make it is through this infectious clone thing this recombinant DNA

48:04.240 --> 48:06.880
Turned into RNA and then they transfect stuff with it

48:08.880 --> 48:10.880
Now wouldn't that be a much more

48:11.760 --> 48:17.280
A much more invigorating and motivating and enticing explanation for this biology than just saying

48:17.680 --> 48:22.000
Oh, don't watch the ball. They're making fun of you. They're making all kinds of stuff up

48:25.600 --> 48:28.000
Kevin McCurnan isn't lying about everything

48:30.240 --> 48:36.320
You think that that buck halter guide a buck halts guy does nothing. Well, you're crazy

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
What they do they do well

48:44.000 --> 48:46.560
What they do they can do with pretty high precision

48:47.280 --> 48:52.880
How that transfers to the wild how that transfers to the natural world how that transfers to

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
A patient is very different

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
But in laboratory conditions

48:58.480 --> 49:06.720
With laboratory generated DNA laboratory generated enzymes laboratory directed evolution optimized enzymes

49:08.880 --> 49:10.880
We can do a lot with DNA

49:11.600 --> 49:15.600
And that means we can make a lot of pure or relatively pure RNA

49:16.560 --> 49:22.240
You don't believe there's any self replicating RNA or DNA viruses in the wild. That's great

49:23.280 --> 49:27.920
But if you don't think that people have been trying to figure out how to make something like that

49:28.480 --> 49:30.480
Now that's that's a completely

49:31.040 --> 49:33.040
Gigantically ridiculous position

49:34.560 --> 49:37.200
But it's very convenient for the people who do it

49:39.120 --> 49:41.360
Because then there's no challenge from

49:41.680 --> 49:45.920
Sam Bailey and her followers to any of the dangers that are represented here

49:48.240 --> 49:54.000
Shouldn't Sam Bailey then really be saying that the real danger is gene drives

49:56.240 --> 49:59.760
The real danger is directed evolution of enzymes and toxins

50:01.600 --> 50:03.600
Why isn't she saying that then?

50:04.720 --> 50:10.000
Because she doesn't understand that biology. She doesn't read those papers or she thinks those papers are nonsense too

50:12.160 --> 50:15.600
That's where this little magic show breaks down

50:16.560 --> 50:18.560
There's no next step

50:19.040 --> 50:21.040
It's just all nonsense

50:21.360 --> 50:27.920
They're just throwing millions of dollars out the window on stinky bottles of brown liquid that they do nothing

50:28.720 --> 50:32.560
And all these people are so stupid that they they really don't get it

50:33.120 --> 50:37.600
Those gels and everything they're so excited and those patterns and everything, but it means nothing

50:37.680 --> 50:39.680
I

50:41.200 --> 50:46.400
Wow what a spectacular bamboozlement nice using published sequences

50:47.120 --> 50:52.800
Don't take your eye off the ball here. These sequences have never been shown to come from a virus

50:53.040 --> 51:02.720
They have simply been fraudulently classified as viral on genetic data banks from processes that never physically isolated any viruses

51:03.120 --> 51:12.720
These complementary DNA sequences were then transcribed into RNA and mixed with zero monkey kidney cells to supposedly make viruses

51:13.040 --> 51:19.680
So the statement that chimeric and full-length viruses were confirmed by sequence analysis before using these studies

51:20.160 --> 51:27.280
As a case of circular reasoning. They had already declared in advance that these sequences were viral

51:28.240 --> 51:32.160
That's true. That's true. So she's making a semantic argument here

51:33.200 --> 51:36.960
Right. So the sequences are real

51:38.240 --> 51:40.160
But they made them

51:40.160 --> 51:44.160
And then they put them into a cell culture and whatever the cell culture did with it

51:45.040 --> 51:50.400
They sequenced and said that was evidence of a virus. So I totally agree

51:52.160 --> 51:53.280
But

51:53.280 --> 51:54.240
I

51:54.240 --> 51:56.240
disagree with the

51:56.640 --> 52:00.800
attribution that there's nothing going on in this experiment because what's happening

52:01.600 --> 52:05.040
Is the DNA is being changed to RNA

52:05.600 --> 52:12.480
And you're getting a large quantity of RNA that you would never have in the wild never exist in the wild

52:13.280 --> 52:17.120
And then they take that RNA and they put it on a pure cell culture

52:17.920 --> 52:19.040
and

52:19.040 --> 52:21.280
The cell culture releases particles

52:22.320 --> 52:24.320
supposedly

52:24.960 --> 52:28.080
And it could just be that they put a bunch of RNA on that

52:28.240 --> 52:29.760
on

52:29.760 --> 52:31.760
That cell culture and then when they

52:32.400 --> 52:38.400
They dissociate the cell culture now they have have cell fragments and membrane fragments and

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Mycels

52:42.000 --> 52:43.760
full of RNA

52:43.760 --> 52:46.320
Basically, they're making lipid nanoparticles by by

52:47.200 --> 52:49.040
by cell culture

52:49.040 --> 52:55.760
So they put all those RNAs in the cell culture and then they break up the cell culture into small little lipid bubbles and they have

52:56.560 --> 52:58.000
made like

52:58.160 --> 53:00.160
garage level

53:00.160 --> 53:01.680
Mycels

53:01.680 --> 53:03.680
M-I-C

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
E-L-L-E

53:07.520 --> 53:10.720
Right, I think that's the word. It's like big lipid nanoparticle

53:11.520 --> 53:14.480
So I totally agree with this argument except

53:15.600 --> 53:17.600
the idea that

53:17.600 --> 53:20.880
This isn't sufficient to create the illusion of a pandemic

53:21.760 --> 53:24.400
That they couldn't make truckloads of this and spray it around

53:24.960 --> 53:31.200
And that people wouldn't get sick from it. Of course they would get sick from it. It's RNA in a lipoprotein coat

53:33.040 --> 53:40.480
And so if this is a way of manufacturing RNA in a lipoprotein coat and it's not a virus, but it's something

53:42.800 --> 53:50.240
Then what you're really uncovering is is that gain of function research and viral research in coronavirus is in particular is really

53:50.880 --> 53:54.720
a giant cover for bioweapons research for genetic research really

53:56.720 --> 54:00.160
And the only way that they can come up with a rationale

54:00.960 --> 54:06.400
for exploring genetic research in this way with self-replicating RNAs is to

54:08.080 --> 54:14.720
disguise them as viruses and then they get the added bonus of this perpetuating this mythology of

54:15.440 --> 54:19.920
Mother nature of being out to get us and that you know, you need public health and vaccines

54:21.200 --> 54:24.000
So why aren't they on that part? You see

54:24.800 --> 54:27.680
That's the part that bothers me too. They're so hot

54:28.560 --> 54:30.720
on CHD and the viruses

54:31.360 --> 54:36.880
But CHD's main message is that the vaccine schedule in America is is like

54:37.600 --> 54:39.600
criminal

54:40.080 --> 54:44.160
And so if you agree with CHD on that which I presume Sam Bailey does

54:44.480 --> 54:52.160
Then why would you want to attack CHD so hard? Why wouldn't you want to be more like, you know, CHD is a great organization

54:52.160 --> 54:55.840
And they're really fighting for the right things except they get this virus story wrong

54:58.160 --> 55:02.640
Instead, it's 100% antagonism 100% taking the legs out

55:03.840 --> 55:07.280
Of one of the only organizations in America that's really trying

55:09.360 --> 55:12.720
And is composed of people who have real skin in the game

55:14.720 --> 55:16.720
like Brian Hooker and

55:17.680 --> 55:19.680
and Laura Bono and

55:20.240 --> 55:22.240
And yeah, I mean the list is very long

55:23.680 --> 55:25.680
Real people

55:27.040 --> 55:32.080
And it's just not a it's not in in 2023. Are we really still here?

55:33.440 --> 55:36.560
That they don't have a better more succinct stick

55:37.520 --> 55:39.760
That they can get to the heart of the matter quicker

55:40.560 --> 55:46.720
I mean, are they going to analyze New Zealand's all-cause mortality at some point and start to get pissed off about people being

55:46.960 --> 55:50.720
Transfected or are they just going to be stuck on this isolation issue forever?

55:51.920 --> 55:55.920
Doesn't matter whether they were in the form of CDNA or RNA

55:56.480 --> 56:05.360
Unfortunately, this quote infectious clown business has fooled a number of people's who can uh, I do believe Mark Bailey believes in in

56:06.320 --> 56:11.840
Um, in bacteriophages. Absolutely. I think he does continue to ignore the provenance issue

56:12.240 --> 56:15.920
If there is no physical isolation of any particle shown to be viral

56:16.320 --> 56:20.480
How can it be claimed that these sequences come from inside one?

56:21.200 --> 56:23.200
So at this point all they have are

56:23.760 --> 56:28.480
Vero cell mixtures including various proteins and genetic sequences

56:29.040 --> 56:33.040
To clarify a virus is said to be a replication competent particle

56:33.440 --> 56:36.000
Consisting of a genome and approach a nation's coat

56:36.480 --> 56:40.160
It is supposed to be an intracellular parasite that causes disease

56:40.800 --> 56:45.280
Anyone thinking that this has been established at this point is seeing things

56:45.920 --> 56:49.360
The methodology is clearly insufficient to make such a claim

56:50.080 --> 56:56.160
Their case rests on starting with samples from the us army medical research institute of infectious diseases

56:56.640 --> 57:02.320
And you would have to be pretty new to this game to believe that they have ever physically isolated any viruses

57:03.120 --> 57:05.120
Such a sweet kid

57:05.680 --> 57:08.880
We then move to the next section of the barrack study

57:09.520 --> 57:11.520
mice and in vivo infection

57:12.000 --> 57:16.560
Where they exposed mice to their mixture that contained the imaginary viruses

57:17.120 --> 57:22.240
Not just any mice, but highly inbred albino ba alb mice

57:22.800 --> 57:27.520
They inethetize the mice and then squirted 50 microliters into the nose of each mouse

57:27.920 --> 57:30.160
This may not sound like much fluid

57:30.240 --> 57:36.720
But by weight it is equivalent to injecting half a cup or four fluid ounces into a human's nose

57:37.600 --> 57:41.840
While they are asleep the tomfoolery continued when they stated

57:42.240 --> 57:46.800
No blinding was used in any animal experiments and animals were not randomized

57:47.200 --> 57:54.000
They presented this chart showing weight loss and lethality after injecting the two mixtures into the mice

57:54.720 --> 58:02.000
Because it was not a scientific study. There was no control group and the actual lethality was apparent mostly caused by

58:02.400 --> 58:05.120
Sacrifice due to the study protocols

58:05.680 --> 58:08.000
But however, they abused these animals

58:08.320 --> 58:12.480
It was all pointless from the start as they have not shown an infectious particle

58:12.880 --> 58:16.720
Thus all of their results are built on a false premise

58:17.440 --> 58:21.200
For example, this does not represent a quote viral tighter or

58:21.600 --> 58:22.400
infection

58:22.400 --> 58:27.760
But levels of selected nucleic acid sequences in their in vitro cell culture experiments

58:28.160 --> 58:34.880
The study also features some histological slides and antibody essays without valid controls again

58:35.360 --> 58:40.720
But aside from that, they are all indirect measures that do not require the existence of viruses

58:41.680 --> 58:43.680
So there is the trick, right?

58:44.000 --> 58:50.400
They are all indirect measures that do not require the existence of viruses and could also be explained by

58:50.880 --> 58:56.720
Transfection could also be explained by exposure to the RNA not the replication of it

58:57.760 --> 59:05.200
It could be the exposure to the cell culture materials and not the replication of it very possible

59:10.000 --> 59:16.080
But it's hard for me to imagine that they're making these clones and that they're not doing it well

59:16.080 --> 59:18.080
I

59:19.360 --> 59:21.360
Have used

59:21.600 --> 59:28.960
in particular a product an adenovirus product where DNA is used in adenovirus

59:30.480 --> 59:32.480
in particles to

59:33.120 --> 59:35.120
Transfect neurons

59:35.920 --> 59:37.920
in the brain of a mouse

59:38.160 --> 59:40.160
under specific genetic promoters

59:41.120 --> 59:42.400
and

59:42.400 --> 59:46.400
The precision with which we can do that in the short term is extraordinary

59:47.680 --> 59:48.880
now

59:48.880 --> 59:50.480
again

59:50.480 --> 59:52.480
it is

59:52.720 --> 59:53.760
Out of my

59:53.760 --> 01:00:00.720
Expertise to be able to say whether what I was getting from the suppliers and from the people that were making them for me were

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.440
we're actually bona fide

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.080
adenoviruses

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.080
But what they did and what we were capable of doing with them was very predictable very precise

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400
and very repeatable

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.880
And although I could not verify directly that the genes were being expressed the fluorescence showed up where it should be

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.400
and their sensitivity to blue light was within milliseconds

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.360
of the application of the laser

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:38.080
And I was recording ionic currents in real time using patch clamp physiology with a resolution far far far

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.720
beyond what is necessary to see that these signals are real

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.680
So we can put RNA and DNA into neurons in a mouse and get them to express proteins

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.560
which have functional consequences that can include

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.080
rapid open and closing of protein channels to blue light

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.800
rapid and open and closing of channels that are gated by drugs

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.440
And we can upregulate and downregulate protein expression we can interfere with it with

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.920
small interfering RNAs

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.480
And we can make lots of copies of those small interfering RNAs

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.120
that are accurate enough to knock down one protein and not another

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.200
one

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.240
Sub-transcript of another one subunit of a protein or another

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.680
And these are not

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.840
unchecked or unrepeated experiments. They are done worldwide

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.720
Asking different questions. So molecular biology exists

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.440
The question is do wild viruses exist?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:56.160
And that's the part that they get wrong because they really really are careless about how they talk about this stuff

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.400
So imprecise that oftentimes they are in effect in the minds of the listener

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.600
Throwing out all of molecular biology with the virology bathwater

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.040
So here it is a colorful depiction. It was certainly created in a lab, but

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.440
it's not a virus

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.080
Vanity Fair did not bother to analyze this paper in any way and reported that this gain of function

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:29.360
Experiment which had begun prior to the moratorium was so fraught that the authors flagged the dangers themselves

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.880
Writing scientific review panels may deem similar studies too risky to pursue

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.000
The only risk they're running is that more people start waking up to the fraud of virology

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.120
Instead of so I just want to entertain what Moderna has just put in the chat at 1102

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.400
Are you damaged the mouse neurons that you think you found a signal?

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120
So i'm not going to take that

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.240
Personally just because that shows exactly how

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.280
Like shallow your understanding is of what i'm talking about and that's okay because

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.480
I'm making a pretty casual reference to a pretty sophisticated set of technologies and their use in

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.280
laboratory animals

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.280
but we can express

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.160
algal proteins

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160
in mouse neurons

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.560
And use blue lasers to make those neurons spike

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.040
or have sub

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040
threshold signals

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.520
on the timescale of close to

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.800
a 10th of a millisecond on and off

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:38.480
And depending on the fluorescence of the neuron we can also predict the relative

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.560
Magnitude of that signal because we have a tag on those

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.760
On those ion channels and so the more of them there are

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.240
The more fluorescent the

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:54.800
Neuron will be and that is linearly related to the electrical signal we see when we turn on the blue light. It's not damage

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.680
The neurons are functioning normally the animals are behaving normally

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:10.800
And we can modify the behaviors by turning on the red the blue light because those neurons then function differently when they are depolarized by the algal protein

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200
And you can't use it for everything

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.480
But with elegant application of

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960
Transfection of this

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:28.320
Of this methodology you can do very ask very elegant questions about how neurons work together. You can't cure cancer

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720
But we're talking about very basic

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.560
Questions on how neurons talk to one another that's that's the neurobiology that matters

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.760
that's the

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.600
Stuff that I was interested in doing that you can't get grants for because because you're not trying to cure a disease

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920
You're not trying to make a vaccine

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.840
So try not to be too

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640
Too dismissive of what

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.760
Academic biologists are capable of and what academic biology does when it's done right

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.040
There is good science in every field. There are good questions being asked. There are

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.600
worthwhile experiments

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.880
The question is are there a hundred billion dollars worth of good experiments being done and the answer is obviously no

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.560
But there are good scientists out there who can ask ask very basic questions that move that basic understanding forward

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.160
And there are lots of applications of Transfection that work great for that

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720
Molecular biology is real

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.120
That's what's frustrating about their stick because it really feels like they want you to cast

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.640
Has wide a net of doubt as possible

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:49.520
On as wide a field base as possible in biology and that's a really big mistake

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.760
Lab lakes that look like something out of outbreak. They will understand. Oh, come on now. Really

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.200
Really I didn't say I was playing with live viruses

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.280
I said I was transfecting and transforming cells using DNA and RNA and some protein you know

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.360
Some coat

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.880
Some particle some application I get a little tube

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It's got DNA in it

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.120
I mean, this is where you know, you start to sound like

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.960
That this this little shtick has worked on you

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.480
Because you're not sophisticated enough to know where the bs starts

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.760
And that's exactly what people like kevin mccernan kevin mccernan chuck kownan

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.320
Is that with their

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.560
Really stupid complicated explanations about how these sequencing reactions work

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.480
We're just going to go limp and not learn the details well enough so that we know where the real

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.040
You know bonafide measurements can be made and where the bs starts

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080
And if you're not willing to do that work

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.040
And you shouldn't be in this audience because this audience is doing that work in real time

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.440
And it's kind of sad if you want to sit in the chat and then

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.160
Rag on me and defend her when this is exactly what she's doing

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.360
Casting such a wide doubt a net of doubt that she would throw out

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.680
Almost any anything that works anything that's measurable anything that's understandable with respect to these signals

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.720
It's just a it's just a it's just terrible disingenuousness

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.480
That like the film it is pure fiction

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:41.280
Sadly though the headlines are being promulgated by dr mccollar rand paul and the chd

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.040
Without any of them discussing the actual science in these papers

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.760
If they are unable to understand the so-called gain of function experiments

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.360
Then shouldn't they say I don't know and leave it at that

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:01.680
On that front we are often asked to talk to prominent health freedom individuals who have called fraud on various covid responses

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.240
But it's still subscribing to the virus model

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:12.080
Almost universally they do not want to discuss the methodologies of the virologists and start discussing peripheral phenomena

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.760
As tom kowin has publicly announced several times

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.880
The offer is open to walk through a virological paper step by step

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:28.160
At each step we would like them to state whether they think it is following the scientific method and whether there are valid controls

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.080
We would also like them to look at a paper like the barrack one I have just presented and indicate

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.920
Which part they think demonstrates the existence of a virus as defined by the virologists

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:46.880
See so she's really stuck on this defining the virus and which one is defining the virus

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.200
And she doesn't want to acknowledge that infectious clones are simply transfections

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.360
And if they transfect a plate of zero six cells

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.040
They get particles that have RNA in them and if they put that RNA in an animal

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760
They can see the RNA

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.360
Replicate for a short period of time make partial copies of itself

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.400
I don't know what they see they see an immune response that includes antibodies to some of the proteins that are encoded by the RNA

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:26.000
The fact that they don't understand what they're doing is very different than them doing nothing

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.040
And so by discounting the entire experiment

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.880
You're ignoring the fact that they can make that DNA

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.880
You're ignoring the fact that they can take that DNA and they combine it with a t6

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.400
polymerase and they can make it into an RNA

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.600
And they can put that RNA on a cell culture

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.480
And the cell culture will package it or put it in vesicles or something

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:59.920
And they can make that mixture then and they can put it somewhere else and it seems like the RNA replicates some make some copies of itself

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.000
That's already back in the 80s. Okay, so you can see the argument that we've made

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.800
And we've talked about in a book like this one

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.240
So in a book like this one

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.800
Where they tried to do what they could?

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.240
They were already doing gels like this and the gels they don't really know what they're doing

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.560
But the gels do show you one thing when one thing weighs the same as another thing

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.600
they go to the same part of the gel and so you can do pretty simple control experiments

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.960
And they could show that some of these RNAs were self-replicating

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.320
They weren't doing it very well because they were making really

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.400
Small truncated copies of certain parts of the RNA and they still don't understand why this is

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.600
But they can see leader sequences there and the leader sequences have something to do with when the RNA polymerase stops

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080
And

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.120
So they see what I can believe for the last 20 years are some kind of really crappy

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.400
Signals of self-replicating RNA that occasionally they get a clue

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760
And so they've been combining these

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.200
These hints these molecular things together

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.720
Hint cell cultures and colon them viruses pretended to go out into the wild and find more

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:33.280
But it is very very dangerous to discount all of molecular biology to discount the fact that they can make a lot of a lot of something

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.000
If they wanted to they can make a lot of DNA

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.440
If they wanted to they can make a lot of myelin

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.440
If they wanted to they can make a lot of any protein that they wanted to

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.120
If they wanted to make a lot of any RNA they could

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.440
And so if they wanted to transfect Sam Bailey and all of her family with a vaporized

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.000
RNA

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I think they could do it

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.200
And if that RNA or that DNA

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.360
Was was detected with a PCR test. I think they could they could make that pretty replicable too

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.880
It might not be a self-replicating RNA pathogen

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.600
But you can't discount the fact that they have technologies to put these sequences in places

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.760
They have technologies that can transfect and express these proteins in places

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840
That means that they can do things

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.480
That means they can create signals they can create illusions they can create real

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760
Pathologies

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:54.400
Because there are real toxic proteins there are real immunogenic proteins there are real allergenic proteins

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.760
And autoimmunity is real

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.200
If you make a salmonella bacteria that can express the the myelin protein on its outside

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.520
You can cause people to go into advanced muscular multiple sclerosis by getting salmonella

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.200
That's not an imaginary story. That's a real thing

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.160
Because the immune system is a real thing

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.960
But we have to be very careful about how this no virus narrative is being wielded as this

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.800
really

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.800
Bull in a china shop style

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280
nonsense

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:44.480
Where everybody who believes in anything to do with this molecular biology just has to be discounted as an idiot

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.520
And then now now mary holland and and

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.760
All of the other great leaders of chd are equivalent to tony fauci in her mind

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.480
Because now she's going to play tony fauci after she just what was that slide of?

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.480
Oh

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.640
It's not the stand that like the film it is pure fiction here sadly though

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:16.160
The headlines are being promulgated by dr mccollar Rand paul and the chd

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.760
Without any of them discussing the actual science in these papers

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.640
I don't know what science you're talking about. If they are unable to understand the so-called gain of function experiments

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.320
Then shouldn't they say I don't know and leave it at that

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.960
On that front we are often here

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.160
So look comedy. This is mccolla. This is the guy who

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.320
Stopped vaccinating his office until he lost his job

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.520
This is a guy who's spoke out very early about hydroxychloroquine being

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:50.160
Wrongly blamed for swollen hearts and heart attacks and all this other stuff and has come full

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.760
Through the pandemic all the way to the point now where he says that the vaccine schedule in america is super sketch

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.560
He actually says this in a more forceful and direct manner than robert f Kennedy jr. We'll say

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.680
She's got him on here with del and pure cori and

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.200
Who's that? Is that robert melon without him? What is that? Is that robert melon? I don't know

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.480
I just I I think this is really you know here's

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.080
Naomi wolf. I'm totally down with that. We saw Naomi wolf yesterday was

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:34.960
To talk to prominent health freedom individual but you don't want to talk to prominent health freedom individuals because they believe in viruses and it's such a weird

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:45.520
It's such a weird stance because it's not it's not being genuine because they can make dna and they can make rna

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.240
And so if they're lying about what they're doing with it if they're

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.280
obfuscating what they can and can't do with it

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:59.840
That's something completely different and and you you could be a lot more precise about it and make a lot more progress than just saying to argue about

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.800
vigils who have called on various covid responses, but it's still subscribing to the virus model

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:14.640
Almost universally they do not want to discuss the methodologies of the virologists and start discussing peripheral phenomena

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.240
As tom cowin has publicly announced several times

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.440
The offer is open to walk through a virological paper step by step

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:30.720
At each step we would like them to state whether they think it is following the scientific method and whether there are valid controls

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.640
We would also like them to look at a paper like the barrack one i have just presented and indicate

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.560
Which part they think demonstrates the existence of a virus as defined by the virologists

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.640
Ironically, they say fauci is lying when it comes to vaccines drugs and public policy

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.960
But when it comes to fauci's basic virology everything is spot-on

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.160
Because I represent science as we have explained a virus mania

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.480
Fauci has been one of the major drivers of establishment virology for the past four decades

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.320
And was probably the most powerful AIDS official in the united states

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:15.360
Public belief in the virus model is the single most important factor keeping the whole show together

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.480
Coming back to the title of the video. It means that there is no evidence that viruses exist in nature

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.520
Trying to find and isolate such particles directly from humans animals or plants failed long ago

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.360
Christine massy has tirelessly requested this evidence from hundreds of institutions around the world and they have all turned up a blank

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.520
Not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for any alleged viruses

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.720
This point is crucial for people to understand

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.120
Viruses have never been seen in nature

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:57.200
They are created in laboratories, but only as fictional constructs in the imaginations of the virologists

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:05.600
This can be through calling particles and cell breakdown experiments viral and then blaming the breakdown on the particles

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.560
Or it could be through silly experiments where mixtures are injected into animals

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:17.840
And then the responses are attributed to imagined viruses or it could be through creating a quote genome

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.600
Even though the provenance of the genetic material was not established

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:28.400
This latter technique is increasingly favored by virologists as it largely takes place in the dry lab

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.440
That is on their computer simulations

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.480
None of this translates to infectious replicating and disease causing particles as biological entities

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:45.760
Because there is no evidence that they exist there is no evidence that there is anything contagious to leak from a lab

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.960
So what goes on in top secret facilities is nothing to do with actual viruses

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.120
If they really had evidence for such a thing they would have showcased it to the public long ago

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.800
Those who have studied the history of virology can see that despite their best efforts

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.840
They have a fatal problem of the missing virus

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:12.640
The lab leaks sleuths who are mining the genetic databases and looking at government reports

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.840
Are not finding breadcrumbs accidentally left behind by stealthy virologists

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.440
They are finding giant lobes of bread that are designed to go along with the circus

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.680
If they looked upstream they might notice that they are dealing with pseudo scientific constructs

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:36.000
Perhaps they should consider why the virologists have not done the blinded and controlled experiments

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.440
That we propose to them in the settling the virus debate statement

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.360
As always I encourage everyone not to get swept up in fair narratives

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.840
The virus model has been one of the greatest tools of manipulation

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.720
And its influence has been catastrophic

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.120
Particularly in the last four years

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.160
Many of us have learned to ignore the model in our own lives and the health of our families is all the better for it

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.320
So when I have a big problem with the way that this goes because

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.960
Is your family better for it because you ignore that there are viruses

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.680
Or is it because you stopped using or never used vaccines

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.400
So

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:27.360
That's the problem that I have with her then attacking chd because chd has an open mind about

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.200
The biology and a not open mind about the

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.760
The medical application of vaccines for this

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.920
And one of them is really hurting people

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120
And the other one is

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.680
Actually not hurting people really

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:52.400
Except for if they believe in it and then if they believe in it they still have to take back scenes in order for them to get hurt

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.520
So

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.600
On the other hand if the government is using these stories of gain of function as cover for

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.560
them looking for

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.480
Signals in the wild that can be useful in genetic engineering

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.440
because exosomes are real

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.040
and

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.120
There is a whole field of biology

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.280
that works on exosomal communication between tissues

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.520
and

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.800
between

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.840
species

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.840
between con specifics

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.480
And it's just a very very difficult

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.960
size scale

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.960
to work on

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.640
so

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.640
It is very likely

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:47.920
That a background signal composed of RNA and DNA and enzymes or or RNA and DNA coding for enzymes

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.480
is there

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:58.720
Because cells send signals to each other because the immune system sends signals to other parts of the immune system using these small packets of information

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.920
But a

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.520
A conflated background signal that has been

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.360
You know distorted into a signal of pathogens. I'm totally down with this idea

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.600
I'm not totally down with it being like about

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
about the pretty girl

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.760
I'm totally not down with it being about the

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.960
the

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.800
It's this is not about this is something wrong with this

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:38.160
Because we're not doing the hard work of okay, so they're they're lying about this stuff

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.840
And they're they've exaggerated about this stuff and a lot of these experiments don't have controls

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.800
But what do we do about all of this technology which can make large quantities of DNA and large quantities of RNA?

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.280
What do we do about that technology?

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.240
Do you actually think that they're not doing anything with it?

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.120
Do you actually think that all of these labs are doing nothing?

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:11.040
Or do you think that they're actually using this very highly developed RNA and DNA technology for something?

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.080
That's the part of this that's so frustrating

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.960
Is because we're we're contorting and distorting

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.600
Taking away

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:30.880
Support from an organization full of people trying to do their best to end the scam of vaccines

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:40.320
And the only thing you can say is that they're just dummies because they don't they don't know how to read a virology paper like me and my husband do

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And then wave your wave your hair around and take pictures like this

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.520
And pump

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.520
pump plastic into your lips

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.360
Seriously, I tried to talk to her in the first year of the pandemic and she wouldn't do an interview with me

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.840
I mean at some point I really thought that they were actually pretty good people

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.680
And just that they were they just needed to understand that

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.400
There might not be wild viruses, but they figured out a way to make little tiny

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.200
Self-replicating RNAs and they're playing around with them and calling them viruses

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.800
And maybe some of these self-replicating RNAs are signals that we use ourselves that other animals use themselves

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.000
Maybe they're especially abundant in in bats for all I know

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.640
But they're not going to get these ideas from nowhere. They're not going to find these little genes nowhere

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.880
But they do find them I kind of believe that

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.200
But

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:55.200
The question of them being a signal of a pathogen or a signal of a pathogenic potential even is a bit over the day that it's a bit ridiculous

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.200
A bit exaggerated. I'm totally fine with that

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.640
But I'm not fine with attacking everybody on the health freedom unit side

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.640
With one blanket attack of well, they won't accept it that they can't read virology like we can read it

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.400
They don't understand this biology like we do

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.280
All of those people are crazy and me and my husband were the best

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040
And Tom Cowan too, he's great

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.040
But I'm not going to mention Andy Kaufman anymore because he's kind of a weirdo and he spoke about exosomes for the first year

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.360
I think this is very disingenuous

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I'd be happy to have them on my show

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.040
To discuss this and to discuss what what infectious clones might be

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.400
And what these applications might be

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.040
um

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:55.600
And how easy it would be for them to seed the molecular biology of a pandemic and claim that it is there and actually try to perpetuate this

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.240
Idea of their being pathogenic viruses out there and that they're very dangerous and that some of them could be getting a function

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.240
We totally agree on this

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880
In fact

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880
It's in this book

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.520
That we agree on that

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:19.120
That the molecular biology exists for them to create the illusion of a pandemic right down to the sequences right down to the limited

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.600
Culturability of it

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:28.480
And that's the part that I believe that these people are wittingly or unwittingly covering up

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.760
That yes, there are very little good evidence for wild viruses with any

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.520
Real capability of causing spreading pathogenesis over a long period of time

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.560
There's almost there's no evidence for that not very good at all

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.680
And our best chance at understanding that kind of phenomenon would be the polio virus or the measles virus or something like that

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.160
maybe pertussis

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.160
Or whooping cough

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.120
But the bottom line is is that we don't understand how our immune system deals with these signals

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.480
We don't understand the significance of these signals. We're not really sure how they work or how they become generated

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.080
And we do know that the military

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.520
And the government have a vested interest in us not understanding that on the back of this

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:29.040
Is a multi-billion dollar effort to understand how to augment the genome and so we have used every trick in the book

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.760
to allow us to explore

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.520
the broad

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.120
applications of

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.440
Transfection and transformation

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.520
And the broad search for ways to accomplish it

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.920
And if gain-of-function virology is an elaborate mythology to hide their

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.960
Experimenting experimenting with these technologies. I'm totally down with that

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.280
But if we're going to stop at there are no viruses and everybody who thinks that there's a virus

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.240
I don't care what else they're fighting for health freedom-wise. I'm not going to work with them

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.880
That I think you're full of it. I think you're full of it. That's what I think. I think you're full of it

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.280
If you enjoyed this video, please visit support.disam.com

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.520
I don't know. I don't I don't I don't like that. I just don't think it's

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.000
It's as genuine as they want you to believe it is. I just don't think it is

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:39.040
So that's that's all I'm going to say about that. I think I don't need to say any more about that

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.800
And in fact, I think I'm just going to summarize it right here

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400
that

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400
That's this one

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.880
and I just

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.960
I can't believe that

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.280
You know

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.520
after spending a full year almost

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.480
Talking about how the PCR is nonsense

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.000
She mentioned PCR in exactly one sentence at the very beginning of the video and then never again

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.840
as to how that could be used to fool people

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.920
And I think that's a much better

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:27.040
argument than some of these other things about there being a virus or no virus because it is very complicated for

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.280
For the average person to understand

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.600
These subtle arguments about well, what's a virus and what's a clone and all this other stuff?

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.600
It takes a lot of background knowledge, but

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:42.880
To say that they were using a test that basically detected a conflated background signal is pretty easy for everybody to understand

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.040
And that was a story that they were pushing for the first year that they don't push anymore at all ever

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.040
Strange right because I told you that that's what they do. They don't say anything about that

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.040
And it essentially protects the faith because it's such an absurd

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.120
Position that it doesn't threaten the faith at all

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:14.560
The position that threatens the faith is when you start identifying that the faith is the novel virus

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.000
It's not that there's no RNA and DNA floating out there. It's not that our immune systems don't do anything

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.360
It's not that our immune systems aren't challenged by mother nature all the time

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.400
It's that that challenge has been grossly exaggerated

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360
and that challenges

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.760
Threat to you has been grossly exaggerated relative to the threats of

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.640
malnutrition and

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.920
Toxins in your environment toxins that you put on your skin, etc, etc, etc

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.560
And so it's just a weird

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.600
message that's missing so much of

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.520
the precision that that we're trying to get and

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.400
You know in a lot of ways as I said on this notes and elsewhere we agree

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.320
We agree that the gain of function story is a complete hoax

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.120
We agree that they actually set out to use that as a hoax

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.640
We agree that they use that hoax to fool people in believing that wow we caught him in a lie

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.120
And that's how they got people to believe that there was a pandemic. I absolutely agree with that

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.600
But why and how did they do it?

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.880
With really intentional lies with very very wicked lies

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.080
About sequences and about culturing

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.560
And about the significance of infectious clones

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.680
And it's really curious that she actually

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:49.120
Said infectious clones in that video and actually failed to explain it

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:57.520
But just explained it away as fake. It's not viruses. No, it's not viruses because viruses can't make

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:04.720
Pure quantities of an RNA genome. They can't it's they can't find that in the wild. We talked about that

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.280
Of course they can't

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:14.000
But as best we can tell it seems like they can find some signal that resembles the

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.720
the

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.520
Resemble something of an RNA signal that can be moved between animals

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400
And

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.440
So their best approximation of it is an infectious clone

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.120
And is it a good approximation? No, it's completely different. It's completely synthetic

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.800
It's completely way pure that anything that's ever been in nature ever will be

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680
Because RNA doesn't do that

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.000
And so do they ever talk about why they're doing this? Do they ever talk about it?

01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:52.720
Do they ever say that if you don't believe in viruses that'll keep the digital idea way

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.760
Do they ever say that if you don't believe in viruses that'll keep the CBDC away

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.120
Do they ever talk about just stop, you know

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:13.040
She spent 18 minutes telling people that there's no viruses, but then that's an indirect statement

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.000
I guess we shouldn't take the vaccines or or what

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.960
What about the vaccine schedule

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.920
What about all the other issues that that people want to understand or is it just about viruses? I don't know

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.480
I think that was a

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:34.560
Pretty fair evaluation of a pretty disingenuous presentation that zeroed in on

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.600
CHD children's health defense

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.360
Joseph Mercola and a few other people for no good reason

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.080
other than to

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.760
other than to

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.120
I guess draw attention to support Sam Bailey.com

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.160
I really don't understand

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640
What the motivation is there

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.560
They really are fighting for some good things

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.200
But because they don't agree with us and can't read virology like we can they're just on the bench like everybody else

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:12.240
Haha, the danger is the eliminated the elimination of the control group. She also didn't say that at all

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:19.360
She also didn't say anything about intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.040
That's actually a really pretty straightforward statement that gets a lot of work done really quick

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.640
And doesn't make people grind their gears about a lot of virus realer. Did they uh

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.560
Are they able to isolate viruses or is a FOIA request?

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.120
Proof that they don't buy aisle

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.520
I don't understand if you get a FOIA request

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.480
And they answer it. Does that mean that they didn't isolate the virus or they did isolate the virus?

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.160
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent. Thanks for joining me tonight. I'll see you guys tomorrow

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.440
Boop-bye

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.600
Ego is not questioning yourself what

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.200
It's a fair question. I don't even know what you're talking about anymore

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.520
Should actually make you rethink your methods

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:14.000
Looking for an immune response to i g i g g what are you talking about?

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.640
I didn't know man. I don't know

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:23.600
I'll keep reading your chat for a little while, but uh, I honestly I think you're struggling there fella

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.480
Just start treading water for a little while and uh, I'll go back to immunology 101 in a week or so

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.960
Um, and and we'll start talking about stuff again

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.120
I

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.720
Don't know. I don't know what to tell you sunday. I'm presenting to the uh

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.360
To the doctors, uh, the medical doctors for covid ethics in the uk the group that's hosted by

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.920
uh, steven frost

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:55.280
Uh, monday morning. I'm gonna have uh j about a charia on and monday

01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:01.520
I guess that's really early monday afternoon and then monday early evening. Um, I think at six o'clock

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.240
Eastern time. I'm gonna have peter mccullis. So monday is a big day for me

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.680
Um, and sunday

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.320
I'm gonna be presenting to the doctors in the uk

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.760
So that'll be a good

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:17.040
summary and maybe you'll even get some of your clone thing that you want in there and a little bit more about the pcr and a

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:24.320
Little bit more details about the science and the backing it up again. You know, it's been three years doing this already

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.280
It's not like uh, the the papers aren't out there. It's just getting tiring after a while

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.480
You know, I kind of feel like the balies, you know, if you don't want to listen to all the stuff that I did before

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560
Well, then i'm not going to talk to you now

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360
I'm just kidding. I'll see you guys again tomorrow

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.080
The ego out take the ego out he says take the ego out

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.240
He tried to be on stream for three years straight

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.080
Shaking a can on the internet and tell me about ego. I got none brother. I got none

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.440
You
