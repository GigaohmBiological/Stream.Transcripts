04:18.540 --> 04:20.940
joining me

04:48.860 --> 04:55.500
is a fizzy in 611 good to you know I just picked verses that the deep state bad guys tell me to

04:55.500 --> 05:00.460
put on um you know all the controllers that I have all these people that are behind the scenes

05:00.460 --> 05:06.140
influencing me like my wife and my three kids my big dog and this guy named mark who lives in

05:06.140 --> 05:11.300
Boston I mean it's just kind of a joke to me but thank you very much I'm not making fun of a fizzy

05:11.300 --> 05:15.060
in 611 at all I'm just was making a big joke loving Daniel

05:29.780 --> 05:34.980
I think truth is good for kids we're so busy lying we don't even recognize the truth no more in

05:35.060 --> 05:40.180
society we want everybody to feel good that's not that's not the way life is

05:42.580 --> 05:46.580
but you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it in people

05:48.180 --> 05:52.980
and I have lied I'm sure I'll lie again I don't want to lie you know I don't think I'm a liar

05:52.980 --> 05:58.340
I try not to be a liar I don't want to be a liar I think it's like really important not to be a liar

06:05.940 --> 06:10.740
it's almost hard to put a laugh track behind that anymore because what he said is just so

06:10.740 --> 06:18.020
brutally in your face um Tucker Carlson is gonna be featured in today's show again just so you know

06:20.820 --> 06:28.740
mark mark mark you're so funny as a surgeon you should be speaking out on this you could

06:28.740 --> 06:33.140
save lives if you did what the fuck I didn't know anything about this how am I meant to know about

06:33.220 --> 06:41.060
this you know what I don't know about everything like um you shouldn't you shouldn't think that

06:41.060 --> 06:46.980
just because you're on to something that someone else you'd be doing it to buddy we've all got

06:46.980 --> 06:54.420
our own jobs to do I don't tell you what to do what the fuck anyway I mean the reason why I try

06:54.420 --> 06:59.620
to get through to you get your number call you and you're busy last time and I'm not busy is

06:59.940 --> 07:06.660
look I went back through the podcast and I'm afraid I think it wasn't good enough mate

07:07.380 --> 07:13.540
um I don't know how to explain this to you but you know it was about it was just over an

07:13.540 --> 07:20.500
hour but the thing is what was relevant was like literally just 15 minutes and it was just dragged

07:20.500 --> 07:27.220
out and there was not enough substance not enough facts not enough details um I would also say

07:27.220 --> 07:34.420
try and work on your presentation you you drag things out and speak very slowly and

07:34.980 --> 07:41.140
it's just you need to be a bit more punchy bit more punchy bit more animated bit more lively

07:41.780 --> 07:46.900
I mean I don't know if you're just a bit flat that day or what I don't know but you just I think

07:46.900 --> 07:52.820
you're I don't know your style you can have you just could inject yourself with a little bit more

07:52.900 --> 08:00.180
energy a little bit more animation so what I was going to do actually was create some clips

08:00.180 --> 08:06.740
of the podcast and do a sub stack and obviously credit you and reference you and talk about the

08:06.740 --> 08:11.780
opioid deaths and all that kind of stuff so that was the plan I'm sorry mate I've just

08:12.820 --> 08:19.620
got a lot of fucking podcasts got a lot of recordings and I'm trying to keep the quality of the

08:19.700 --> 08:25.460
content quite high and my faith on this occasion it just it just wasn't good enough

08:26.340 --> 08:33.300
this voice is Doc Malek from the UK just being honest with you um it just the quality wasn't

08:34.660 --> 08:42.900
up to scratch all right mate bye um this phone call took place about six or seven weeks after

08:42.980 --> 08:50.500
Doc Malek interviewed Mark um under some constraints because apparently had a funeral that day and he

08:50.500 --> 08:55.300
only had an hour to record it and so it was kind of rushed and he didn't really want to do it and

08:55.300 --> 09:00.740
he wasn't that into it but they recorded it anyway and he was so busy because he's done so many

09:00.740 --> 09:05.620
podcasts that he knew that it wasn't going to come out for six to eight weeks anyway and he told

09:05.620 --> 09:11.140
that to Mark after the recording and six to eight weeks later Mark just pinged him and said hey

09:11.140 --> 09:14.820
you know Malek you might be able to save some people if you would talk about the fact that

09:14.820 --> 09:21.220
maybe giving supplemental oxygen to people who were on pulse ox might not have been the best idea in

09:21.220 --> 09:26.420
the beginning of the pandemic maybe they're still doing it now you could call attention to this

09:26.420 --> 09:33.380
and save lives and that was the response was laughter and incredibility incredibility

09:34.260 --> 09:40.500
incredibility i don't i don't while i'm just butchering that word um like he didn't believe

09:40.500 --> 09:46.100
mark like he was uh found it ridiculous that mark wanted him to talk about something that he was

09:46.100 --> 09:51.300
talking about and instead of addressing whatever it was that mark mentioned he just said it was

09:51.300 --> 09:56.740
ridiculous for mark to think that anyone should pay attention to everything or whatever mark wants

09:56.740 --> 10:03.460
him to i mean he made it about something that it wasn't if he was really a doctor then what he

10:03.460 --> 10:07.300
could have said was mark i think you've got a really good point with supplemental oxygen you

10:07.300 --> 10:12.180
should keep following up on it but don't harass me i just found out about it from you right now but

10:12.180 --> 10:20.820
instead three or four f words later we haven't said anything about the idea and once you realize that

10:20.900 --> 10:27.060
all of these people whether they're on signal talking about jj kui or whether they're in a

10:27.060 --> 10:33.380
bitcoin chat group talking about jj kui all of these people aren't talking about the fundamental

10:33.380 --> 10:39.780
messages of giga ohm biological when they say that i'm crazy they're not talking about the

10:39.780 --> 10:45.140
fundamental messages of giga ohm biological that have been ignored by all the people that i'm attacking

10:45.860 --> 10:50.340
and i'm not really attacking them right we're just saying that the ideas that they're presenting

10:51.060 --> 10:56.580
they're not following them to their logical conclusion and instead they're stopping well short

10:56.580 --> 11:04.340
almost the exact same way that tony fauci and petered asak and richard ebright and and emily

11:04.340 --> 11:10.020
cop and all these other people that are absolutely positively caught up into a scooby-doo

11:10.660 --> 11:17.140
where they believe implausible biology is possible is the fundamental problem here

11:18.580 --> 11:24.820
and none of these people who are calling me crazy or mark deep state or me working for bad guys

11:24.820 --> 11:31.780
are ever going to acknowledge that since they heard the truth from me they haven't said it again

11:32.340 --> 11:40.100
since doc malik put my first interview with him behind a paywall he hasn't repeated any of the

11:40.100 --> 11:48.420
things that i've said to any of his guests that's why i think he's full of shit in the meantime he's

11:48.420 --> 11:56.820
given a platform to sashilatapova and maryll nass and robert melon never having a critical

11:57.140 --> 12:02.020
question for any of them but instead just letting them get on stage and actually tuning up and

12:02.020 --> 12:09.140
harmonizing with them for the whole performance and the last interview that i had with him that's

12:09.140 --> 12:16.900
not behind a paywall is almost 20% of him whining about his own situation that we've come to understand

12:16.900 --> 12:22.340
is a little bit different apparently last year he was negotiating with the wellness company

12:23.140 --> 12:30.580
for a $50,000 signing bonus is that how you think that i negotiated with robert f Kennedy jr when

12:30.580 --> 12:37.220
he asked me to help him and consult on the wuhan cover up book do you think that that's how much

12:37.220 --> 12:44.340
i asked for a $50,000 signing bonus and $10,000 a month with a three-year contract and a five

12:44.340 --> 12:50.340
percent equity in the book and a 12-month salary with an early termination and maybe a board member

12:50.420 --> 13:01.460
of CHDEU when it gets formed and this was a year ago this email is supposedly real here he is on

13:01.460 --> 13:06.580
twitter saying nice hit piece bravo how did you get a copy of the email and why is it taken out of

13:06.580 --> 13:13.860
context if this is taken out of context then uh i don't need to know the context the context is

13:13.860 --> 13:20.980
very simple here is a doctor who didn't stand up for shit didn't have principles about shit

13:20.980 --> 13:31.700
until 2022 and now he's negotiating as if he's joe rogan of eu for a salary that i'm sure he was

13:31.700 --> 13:36.580
going to disclose to all of his followers i'm sure he was going to convert all of his support to

13:37.140 --> 13:40.180
two free subscriptions once he got this job

13:45.140 --> 13:50.420
like i did when i got hired by robert f Kennedy jr and then told everybody that you can stop your

13:50.420 --> 13:56.980
subscriptions you can stop supporting me i've got a job i'm gonna be okay i told a lot of people to

13:56.980 --> 14:06.260
pause you see the difference between somebody who really is just trying to raise a family and do

14:06.340 --> 14:11.220
the right thing and doesn't really know what the right answer is all the time versus somebody

14:11.220 --> 14:17.780
who is intimately part of a machine and a ladder that they know is available to climb

14:22.660 --> 14:27.140
now i just took these two screenshots and popped them in five minutes ago because my computer had

14:27.140 --> 14:35.300
to restart for a update and so that's why i'm late but this guy is going bananas offline in

14:35.300 --> 14:38.820
several little signal chat groups that i actually used to be a part of

14:40.500 --> 14:46.020
and coordinating his message against me with other people who used to

14:46.020 --> 14:53.380
meddle with me before i cut them out of my life and it is a coordinated symphony of people that i

14:53.380 --> 15:00.180
already had on my bulletin board two years ago as people that were meddlers before they actually

15:00.180 --> 15:07.060
revealed themselves many of them i've pointed out to you already in the years past

15:08.420 --> 15:14.260
now believe it or not they are on a signal chat bitcoin group that i used to be a part of more

15:14.260 --> 15:22.020
than a year ago that ryan cole is a part of that all these you know interesting people some people

15:22.020 --> 15:31.940
with connections to crossfit and bsi and and they're all there pretending that the main message

15:31.940 --> 15:36.660
of this stream isn't intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of

15:36.660 --> 15:42.100
augmenting the immune system is dumb trying to pretend that the main message of this this

15:42.100 --> 15:47.620
stream isn't r&a can't pandemic and trying to pretend that the reason why i'm angry is not

15:48.340 --> 15:53.060
because everybody ignores those messages but because i'm trying to get ahead or because i'm

15:53.060 --> 16:04.580
trying to self emulate for the deep state it is hilarious to me that people with bitcoin and

16:04.580 --> 16:10.740
billion-dollar trading experience are pretending that they tried to help me in the last three years

16:10.740 --> 16:18.660
it is hilarious to me that people who have intimate connections to bitcoin and the

16:18.660 --> 16:25.140
international original international covid summit wherever it occurred is it was it Costa Rica or

16:25.140 --> 16:31.540
florida or some bullshit like that that have connections to wall street trading that have

16:31.540 --> 16:38.420
connections to day trading scams that are all pretending that somehow when i contacted Jonathan

16:38.420 --> 16:44.180
kui i totally meant to help him i tried to help him start a business blah blah blah blah blah

16:45.860 --> 16:50.900
while i was losing my career in my house and paying for my bills with a credit card these

16:50.900 --> 16:56.180
people were helping me start a business one of the businesses that somebody was trying to help me

16:56.180 --> 17:05.460
start was trying to sell gold and trading cards and magic cards being held like like fine art in in

17:05.540 --> 17:14.820
airport lockers i shit you not the idea was to have baseball expensive baseball cards

17:14.820 --> 17:23.140
stored in in airport lockers and then we would sell you know bitcoin or or or or shares in those

17:23.140 --> 17:28.580
things in terms of bitcoin and then people would have ways of using their bitcoin to invest in

17:28.580 --> 17:32.900
shit that was one of the ways that this guy was going to help me

17:35.460 --> 17:44.020
and now that guy from years ago is now in a bitcoin group that he himself started and is still

17:44.660 --> 17:52.980
coordinating talking coordinatedly with this poser pretending that i'm self-immulating and

17:52.980 --> 17:57.540
i'm not sending my main message anymore and instead i'm attacking all these people

17:57.540 --> 18:00.100
because that's what the deep state wants me to do

18:02.820 --> 18:06.980
it's hard for me to believe that anybody in those chats believes these things but that's what's

18:06.980 --> 18:11.620
going on right now ladies and gentlemen just in case you want to know what this means

18:13.700 --> 18:17.700
tall trees catch much wind the wind's getting windier up here i can tell you that for sure

18:17.700 --> 18:24.340
i believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what i understand

18:24.980 --> 18:29.620
all right is the audio really off okay then i'm just going to restart it again i'm going to

18:29.620 --> 18:35.380
see what happens okay um it might be because of this youtube thing let me just stop this

18:36.260 --> 18:39.860
and then i'm going to stop this okay i'm going to stop streaming is going to start it all over

18:39.860 --> 18:45.540
okay guys that's just what we're going to do and um if it if it doesn't work with the start

18:45.540 --> 18:49.140
all over then that's too bad but i i want to get this stream right and i don't want to have to

18:49.140 --> 18:52.340
re-record it um so here we go i'll be right
