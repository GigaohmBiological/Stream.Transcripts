WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.540
Okay, so we're going to need some help here because we need to see if we are on, I didn't

00:19.540 --> 00:24.800
change that title, so we got to see if that title went to all the other streams.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.600
How am I going to check that?

00:30.600 --> 00:37.160
If you are in the chat in Twitch, please talk to me, hey, Fletch, how are you?

00:37.160 --> 00:40.160
Can you, you can hear me okay?

00:40.160 --> 00:54.640
Now we need to go to, you got to try this one, and you got to try YouTube.

00:54.640 --> 01:06.040
Let me get that link for you, is this the right one, no, I want this one, oh that's here,

01:06.040 --> 01:14.720
oh it's working, I see, and it looks like I'm on live in YouTube as well, YouTube is here,

01:14.720 --> 01:18.720
can you hear me?

01:18.720 --> 01:23.720
I think we can hear on YouTube also, all right, all right.

01:23.720 --> 01:29.040
Good sound says not now, all right, what about, what about this one?

01:29.040 --> 01:39.960
Okay, I think the peer tube is going to be the slowest, oh yeah, mute, yes, so peer tube

01:39.960 --> 01:48.360
is going to be the slowest, that's going to be the farthest behind, but it's okay because

01:48.360 --> 01:53.640
I can see that it's working, peer tube's a little chokey, it looks like, every once

01:53.640 --> 02:05.640
in a while it's stalling, maybe, yeah, peer tube looks slow, YouTube looks good, peer tube

02:05.640 --> 02:21.640
looks a little slow, see it freezes every once in a while, I wonder if that's just me,

02:21.640 --> 02:26.640
no it's definitely lagging on peer tube, it might be the people watching, we have eight

02:26.640 --> 02:36.840
viewers, maybe that's too many, I don't know, maybe it's also resolution, we might have

02:36.840 --> 02:52.680
to check that, it was okay before though, so maybe we want to try just streaming to peer

02:52.680 --> 03:02.560
tube, although I bet YouTube is doing fine, I wonder if I have to stop one of those, what do you

03:02.560 --> 03:20.640
think, how's everybody doing? It's freezing just on peer tube, right, is everybody saying just on

03:20.640 --> 03:28.400
peer tube freezing, it's not freezing on Twitch, is it? Broken Science was fantastic, I am Katniss,

03:28.400 --> 03:35.040
I have lots to report, it's actually going to change the direction of the whole stream, I'm actually

03:35.040 --> 03:43.960
really excited about it, Twitch good, okay, and YouTube is good, so that's actually pretty

03:43.960 --> 03:53.440
excellent, I'm not really sure what to think about this one, I'm going to close that, maybe I

03:53.440 --> 04:01.640
had too many windows open there, hold on one second here, where's my other one, here, that one's still

04:01.640 --> 04:14.800
frozen, so peer tube's not perfect yet, I don't see a lot of peer tubing there, that's not really

04:14.800 --> 04:26.600
working very well at all actually, okay, while we tried, I do really think it's working very well on,

04:26.600 --> 04:39.120
I do think that this is working very well on YouTube though, which is good, but oh, here tube

04:39.120 --> 04:43.280
does work every once in a while and then it freezes again, so I'm not sure what to do about that,

04:43.280 --> 04:58.520
okay, but we're trying it, right, we had to try it, I really do think we're doing well on still here a

04:58.520 --> 05:04.120
little bit of fuzzy noise in the background, alright, well let me see if I can fix that,

05:04.120 --> 05:18.720
that might help a little bit, will you be multi-stripping to both platforms, yes I'm gonna try and stream to

05:18.720 --> 05:26.200
twitch YouTube and peer tube simultaneously, but peer tube was the one I was trying to work on tonight

05:26.200 --> 05:33.400
getting running and figuring out how close we are to having that working and it looks like we're

05:33.400 --> 05:42.040
close, I mean it's it's not not working and I wonder if there's something to do with how it could be

05:42.040 --> 05:50.520
something to do with how this thing, because peer tube says it's getting just as good of a signal as

05:50.680 --> 05:58.720
YouTube, but somehow peer tube is not dealing with it as well, so we might have to open, you might have

05:58.720 --> 06:11.760
to open that up a little bit, somehow see how much bandwidth we have and what we've been doing, okay, so

06:11.760 --> 06:18.320
this is a good first test, I'm very very happy to be back, peer tube is choppy, but there is a way to

06:18.320 --> 06:26.880
tune it, I'm not very worried about this test at all, having having YouTube and and twitch going

06:26.880 --> 06:37.080
simultaneously is already a really big deal, so I'm excited about that, smooth as cheese on YouTube,

06:37.080 --> 06:42.400
okay, so this is really good because we're gonna be able to do this live on both then, and we're not

06:42.400 --> 06:50.880
gonna have to fool around with that, and then in the meantime, we can get this really running,

06:50.880 --> 06:56.920
and then we'll have, yeah it's too bad this one is not working, darn it darn it darn it, I wonder if

06:56.920 --> 07:05.200
I just don't have it set up right, but we will figure it out, because you know, guess who got us

07:05.200 --> 07:12.080
back to this point already, of course you know who that is, that's that's Ted, and Ted got us

07:12.080 --> 07:21.760
this far, Ted will get us farther, I'm not worried about it at all, yeah, so hey Pamela, good to see

07:21.760 --> 07:29.920
you, I did not plan on doing a stream because I wanted to stop in between here and see if I could

07:29.920 --> 07:37.440
go back to peer tube, and see some of the basic settings, and see if there's anything that I can see

07:38.400 --> 07:45.440
that would work to fix this, and then I'll come back in about 15 minutes, I know this isn't the

07:45.440 --> 07:51.600
perfect way to come back, but Ted worked really hard to get the peer tube up and running, and so I

07:51.600 --> 07:56.800
wanted to be sure I could pull that trigger, more importantly I'm really happy that we've got it

07:56.800 --> 08:02.320
running on YouTube, because that's exciting, I know that my multi-stream plugin is going to work,

08:02.320 --> 08:08.000
so I'm really excited about that, I'm really excited

08:08.000 --> 08:26.320
let's see testing, oh I see I didn't have very much volume here

08:26.960 --> 08:34.240
test one two, testing one two, test

08:43.840 --> 08:56.000
okay so we got that we got that laugh track you need a laugh track I got one for you

08:56.320 --> 09:09.280
I really do think that YouTube is doing really well and so this peer tube thing is just something

09:09.280 --> 09:17.440
I've got to fix because it's getting exactly the same signal as far as I can see on my

09:17.440 --> 09:31.280
multiple output they're both throwing 5.6 6.8 I mean there's throwing 60 frames a second and

09:31.280 --> 09:41.600
they have the exact same speed so peer tube is getting what YouTube is getting so something is

09:41.600 --> 09:49.280
not quite right. Well peer tube is not going to get me cancelled if I don't leave the things up

09:50.320 --> 09:56.080
and if I keep my language right I'm not too worried about YouTube I just wanted to see if I can

09:56.800 --> 10:00.960
I can get it up there and I'm not going to leave any videos up so every time I go live and then go

10:00.960 --> 10:07.840
off there won't be a video there for anybody to watch but at least you can see me live on YouTube

10:07.840 --> 10:13.200
find me live on YouTube and we're just going to drop everything from YouTube when we when we're

10:13.200 --> 10:20.240
done with it that's my plan and we'll keep using Twitch as a repository for early streams and then

10:21.840 --> 10:26.960
we will yeah it's buffering on on on peer tube so we've just got to open that

10:28.000 --> 10:34.080
we've got to open that somehow maybe the maybe the pipe can be opened somehow I don't know what

10:34.080 --> 10:44.960
that means but let me see configuration plugin themes system

10:55.360 --> 10:59.920
we are going live though that's kind of nice I can see that now in the videos and the live ones to

11:00.000 --> 11:03.760
show up all the time so I can rename that that's good

11:11.920 --> 11:12.000
hmm

11:15.840 --> 11:16.960
yeah let me see

11:22.080 --> 11:22.880
live streaming

11:23.840 --> 11:29.040
maximum live live resolutions to generate

11:32.160 --> 11:35.040
also transcode original resolution

11:41.360 --> 11:47.200
live transcoding threads what do I need for that for enable remote runners for lives

11:47.200 --> 11:52.240
use remote runners to process live transcoding remote runners has to register on your first

11:52.240 --> 11:52.720
instant

11:56.080 --> 12:01.360
we'll claim at least three threads with VOC decoding what is this

12:03.680 --> 12:07.920
does that help anything does anybody know what that means can I do that does that help

12:08.720 --> 12:10.480
where are my where are my chat people's

12:14.960 --> 12:20.560
peer tube user might yeah I don't know it's all up to us how big that server is so Ted and I can

12:20.560 --> 12:24.880
make the bit the server bigger pretty quick and if it's not working

12:27.040 --> 12:31.760
for example I wonder if it's generating this other live resolution it's supposed to generate

12:31.760 --> 12:38.320
this other live resolution of 480p and if it does that then it might be transcoding the original

12:38.320 --> 12:43.200
resolution I think the original resolution is very big hold on one second let me check what my

12:43.680 --> 12:54.080
original resolution is because if my original settings for the video output yeah 1920 1080 is

12:54.080 --> 12:59.680
pretty big so it's going to be it's going to be doing that one so I wonder if I could make this

13:02.640 --> 13:03.280
like this

13:05.600 --> 13:06.800
and then maybe it'll work

13:09.760 --> 13:10.400
what do you think

13:14.080 --> 13:22.320
okay now I turned off the other resolution and now it's not encoding the 480 anymore

13:22.320 --> 13:32.080
see it's smooth I got it peer tube is running now check it out go check out peer tube

13:34.000 --> 13:37.360
oh it just started to buffer right now dang and I thought I fixed it

13:39.840 --> 13:40.240
shoot

13:43.440 --> 13:50.320
but it might be better oh no now I'd buffered again darn darn darn

13:55.680 --> 14:00.400
okay let me see if I can change that again though because that configuration might be what it is

14:03.600 --> 14:06.000
that might be what it is I might have to set

14:13.680 --> 14:27.840
what if I just do this update configuration now videos here okay now I changed it to one

14:28.880 --> 14:33.600
video resolution just HD

14:33.920 --> 14:46.400
are we still good on YouTube still good on YouTube look at peer tube though I think peer tube is better now

14:51.520 --> 14:55.920
it's cool that I can change that live check it out it's not doing it anymore it's buffered now

14:55.920 --> 15:02.640
it's it's working I think it's working where'd the chat go I don't see the chat anymore

15:03.600 --> 15:06.560
or am I not watching shit I'm not watching the live one am I

15:10.720 --> 15:11.680
here's the live one

15:15.520 --> 15:20.960
how's that is the live one going now this is live this is good see I got it

15:26.240 --> 15:27.120
talk to me goose

15:27.760 --> 15:33.520
do we got this we got three we got three going check it out

15:39.920 --> 15:49.040
yes oh it just buffered oh dang it I was about ready to turn on the sound and then it buffered

15:49.760 --> 16:04.320
hmm I thought I had it

16:10.400 --> 16:14.800
yeah I have a feeling it's the pipe we just have to fix the pipe that's all we're just going to

16:14.800 --> 16:23.520
fix the pipe it's something to do with the pipe maximum live transcoding enabled for live streams

16:25.120 --> 16:28.240
live transcoding threads can we go eight

16:30.800 --> 16:33.280
update configuration does that help

16:33.280 --> 16:51.680
this one's live who am I looking at am I staring at something no it froze again

16:52.000 --> 16:58.240
no it's freezing again

17:01.920 --> 17:07.440
peer tube settings enable hls playback instead of web torrent if available

17:07.440 --> 17:21.760
having more trans coded resolutions can improve playback what really

17:28.240 --> 17:35.280
hmm I'm not sure about that let me go back configuration live streaming I'm going to put

17:35.920 --> 17:41.120
480p only try that

17:51.840 --> 17:56.960
now this one says up that's not the right one dang it

18:06.240 --> 18:14.880
and that's not it where's the live one

18:21.120 --> 18:23.840
this should be 480 now why isn't it 480

18:27.600 --> 18:28.720
is this live or not

18:35.280 --> 18:58.640
I don't think you can do that I think what it does is that it trans codes my my stream

18:58.640 --> 19:09.760
I think it reco it does original resolution anyway and so I don't think

19:10.480 --> 19:13.280
okay

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
hmm

19:39.760 --> 19:41.760
.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.760
.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.760
What happens when I do that update?

20:17.760 --> 20:21.760
Does it change to a new video for you or does it quit and start again?

20:21.760 --> 20:25.760
I have the feeling that there's something funny happening there.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.760

22:55.760 --> 22:59.760
.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
.

23:00.760 --> 23:07.160
So, it's getting there. I still have this I can put up.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.680
Yeah, I'm really happy with this though. I got a lot farther with it than I

23:17.680 --> 23:23.560
thought. It's still freezing up on the T or 2. Yeah, I know. But it's a it's a

23:23.560 --> 23:29.560
work in progress and we will figure it out. If we have to pay a little more

23:29.560 --> 23:32.880
money or something like that, then we'll figure that out. But I do like the

23:32.880 --> 23:36.200
fact that we're gonna be on YouTube. I do like the fact that we can get that on

23:36.200 --> 23:41.720
there. And maybe we'll do rumble at the same time too. I don't know. Maybe maybe

23:41.720 --> 23:51.760
we'll do rumble at the same time. I guess we could. I mean, we could definitely do

23:51.760 --> 23:54.720
rumble at the same time.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.800
Oh, you shit.

24:21.760 --> 24:48.480
So, let's see. Go live. Create a new live stream. Or a I want to create one that's

24:48.480 --> 24:53.040
going to go up all the time. How do we do that?

24:57.880 --> 25:11.080
This is not what I want. I want to set up a live streaming leave. Set up a new

25:11.080 --> 25:21.800
live stream. Static key. That's what I want. Okay. Copy. All right, we're gonna

25:21.800 --> 25:28.120
just add it right now. Why don't we just add right now? Because we're that good.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.880
Add a new target.

25:33.280 --> 25:41.520
rumble, baby. And I need that other number.

25:43.800 --> 25:56.760
Where did that go? Here. Copy. And then over here to OBS. Paste it right there.

25:57.280 --> 26:01.600
Sync start with OBS. Okay.

26:04.040 --> 26:09.360
I'm just gonna start it. Failed to connect stream.

26:10.600 --> 26:15.320
rumble live. Stream key.

26:16.920 --> 26:22.880
That's fine. What's wrong with that? That's what I did. There's this thing.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.880
template.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.520
Maybe I had to do that. Copy.

26:34.160 --> 26:42.640
Here. Paste. Okay. Start.

26:42.640 --> 26:50.600
Oh, check it out. Go see if I'm on rumble. I think I just got on rumble.

26:50.600 --> 26:58.440
Ah, funny. That's pretty easy. Am I on rumble?

26:58.440 --> 27:04.280
I haven't created any channels yet.

27:04.280 --> 27:11.400
My content. Paul Offit.

27:11.400 --> 27:24.800
Look, I'm live on rumble. Twitch is down. Yes, I'm on rumble.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.800
Is Twitch really down or not down?

27:32.800 --> 27:41.800
Twitch is up. Who said Twitch was down? Pamela, you said Twitch was down.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.800
I'm live on Twitch. I'm live on rumble. I'm live on YouTube.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.800
And my peer tube is running slowly. What do you think about them?

27:49.800 --> 27:56.800
Apples, Mark. Peer tube is jammed up. I admit that, but I'm live streaming on YouTube.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.800
I'm live streaming on rumble. Yes.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.800
That's cool. Hey, I like that.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.800
And it should be a little delay from Twitch because Twitch is the one that I stream out first.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.800
And these are all concurrent streams that come off of that one.

28:19.800 --> 28:27.800
So all I got to do is create a new template and then create that and then my live stream will come up.

28:27.800 --> 28:35.800
So we are crushing now.

28:35.800 --> 28:54.800
Oh, if I could get peer tube working. If I could get peer tube working. Oh, my gosh.

28:54.800 --> 29:01.800
Yes, on Twitch and on rumble. They'll be there on rumble too now that I'm doing it on rumble like this.

29:01.800 --> 29:09.800
So we'll have a stream on rumble that will be archived and we'll have a stream on.

29:09.800 --> 29:18.800
Yeah, this is great. This is working really well. I'm very excited.

29:18.800 --> 29:27.800
I can change resolution on streaming software to peer tube to 480 and lowest bitrate.

29:27.800 --> 29:38.800
I can't change it to 480. It won't let me do that on here.

29:38.800 --> 29:47.800
Yeah, Twitch is working. YouTube is working. Rumble is working.

29:47.800 --> 29:59.800
Holy ships. I'm very excited about that.

29:59.800 --> 30:04.800
Yeah, I know. Now the chats are all over the place. That's true. But there are ways to bring them together.

30:04.800 --> 30:19.800
So I might be able to do that. Pamela does a little troll and I don't think she's trolling us.

30:19.800 --> 30:29.800
Yeah, I know. I had to use that. I had to use that template on rumble just because that was the one that was there. But I will fix that.

30:29.800 --> 30:35.800
I can make a new template.

30:35.800 --> 30:42.800
And then that template will just probably be the.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.800
Oh, isn't this great? I can't believe it works so well.

30:47.800 --> 30:58.800
It's crazy. It's a free plugin. Like, and it works really, really well. I mean, for the.

30:58.800 --> 31:05.800
It looks really good on rumble. It looks really good on Twitch. It looks really good on YouTube.

31:05.800 --> 31:16.800
I don't know what to say.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.800
PeerTube is going to need some work. We're going to have to probably open up the.

31:20.800 --> 31:27.800
We're going to have to open up some more bandwidth on the server. That's what we're going to have to do. We're going to have to pay a little more money.

31:27.800 --> 31:36.800
And it will run just fine. That's what's going to have to happen.

31:36.800 --> 31:42.800
And there is a way to combine the chats. There's a couple different ways we can use a Chrome extension.

31:43.800 --> 31:49.800
And pop all the chats out and then that Chrome extension will put them all together. I just downloaded that today and I.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
It's going to take me a little while to figure out how that.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.800
That functionality works, but you can do it. At least people have.

31:56.800 --> 32:02.800
Have said that you can do it. I'm probably more than one solution, but.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.800
Keep in mind that that my.

32:05.800 --> 32:11.800
My Ted of Bill and Ted's excellent. Excellent adventure. Ted is on the other side of the planet, so.

32:11.800 --> 32:18.800
It's very rare that we can have a talk. It's best like if I get up early in the morning and call him.

32:18.800 --> 32:26.800
And other than that, it works great because he's a genius and he knows how this all works and if he doesn't, he can figure it out very quick.

32:26.800 --> 32:31.800
I do think the most important thing is how much money we are going to spend every month.

32:32.800 --> 32:37.800
On the server space and the processor, which.

32:37.800 --> 32:42.800
Works on our peer tube, so the processor that we're using on the peer tube right now.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.800
Might just be insufficient for.

32:45.800 --> 32:55.800
Live streaming it the way that we want to live stream it and it might just be that we have to up it from what we're paying now a month to 10 more a month.

32:55.800 --> 33:02.800
Something like that will get us a faster processor and that might already work.

33:02.800 --> 33:13.800
So yeah, we just have to figure out how much if we can spend enough money to make it work, we will otherwise we might just have to leave it at YouTube Twitch and rumble because this is already a very big.

33:13.800 --> 33:17.800
Step up and then we could take the recording.

33:17.800 --> 33:26.800
That I'm always making here and I can still put that on peer tube and have peer to be a place to.

33:26.800 --> 33:31.800
Check audio bit rate to peer tube and out of peer tube as well. Yeah, I've got.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.800
It's identical according to my.

33:34.800 --> 33:39.800
OBS they sending out all the same all the time.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.800
Well, that's how Ted is serving us Ted.

33:43.800 --> 33:58.800
You know, there's different ways to support actually Ted pays for the soapbox and Ted and his friend are trying to start a business where they do some of this stuff for corporate clients and so it was.

33:58.800 --> 34:05.800
He says that it was worth his time to try and set up this peer tube instance and learn how to do it so that he could do it for somebody else.

34:05.800 --> 34:20.800
So I take his word for it, but he is definitely donating talent to giga home biological and all of us in this household and all of us that that are part of this little group really Oh, Ted, a big thank you because

34:20.800 --> 34:26.800
without him I wouldn't be fooling around with this peer tube right now I wouldn't be fooling around with all of this.

34:27.800 --> 34:32.800
I'm going to get this streaming to go as well as it's going. And I did work for Markram.

34:32.800 --> 34:40.800
I did work for Markram and you're not a big fan. I'm going to click on that and see what you watch.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.800
Perceptual bubble. Oh no, he's a monkey. He's a really not a.

34:45.800 --> 34:50.800
He's not somebody that I enjoy. I completely.

34:50.800 --> 34:55.800
He's a bit of a charlatan.

34:55.800 --> 35:08.800
Yeah, he's a bit of a charlatan and he talks a lot of big game. That's why the EU gave him a billion dollars to do the human human brain project or whatever the blue brain project it was a.

35:08.800 --> 35:13.800
It was a tremendous amount of talk that got him there.

35:13.800 --> 35:18.800
Yes, thanks Ted. Oh my goodness.

35:19.800 --> 35:30.800
We did this really well. We got rumble running, which I didn't think we were going to get. So we got rumble rumble seems to be working fine YouTube's working fine and Twitch.

35:30.800 --> 35:37.800
So that really means that peer tube is just a question of figuring out the rates.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.800
And I'm committed to that. I really want peer tube to work.

35:41.800 --> 35:50.800
And in that sense, I'm very willing to put 20 extra bucks a month into a slightly.

35:50.800 --> 36:01.800
Beefier server and beefier processor to get peer to running equally well as these other platforms are apparently running so well done Ted.

36:01.800 --> 36:06.800
And well done Jay for figuring out your OBS.

36:06.800 --> 36:20.800
OBS is a little bit of a beast, but once you get it and learn its little quirks, you can do an awful lot with OBS and I am achieving everything that I'm achieving right now, including this chat over here.

36:21.800 --> 36:29.800
And I didn't have the little people where all the little people. It's not loading all the people.

36:29.800 --> 36:34.800
I thought there were little avatars here. Those little little peer tube.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.800
Peer tube octopuses. Where are they?

36:39.800 --> 36:49.800
So tomorrow morning. After my second cup of coffee, I think I'll do this beyond the noise number 33 with Paul Offit as kind of a test run.

36:49.800 --> 36:58.800
Again, all streams running. Hopefully by my second cup of coffee, I will even be able to talk to Ted.

36:59.800 --> 37:10.800
RFK calling an audible with an Aaron Rodgers VP. I actually suggested Aaron Rodgers be his VP already a year ago when I saw a picture of him and Aaron Rodgers on Twitter.

37:10.800 --> 37:18.800
So who wouldn't surprise me involved. They tried to do that.

37:18.800 --> 37:26.800
Yeah, so that is the ball game, I think.

37:26.800 --> 37:33.800
I hope you are too disappointed that I didn't have a really a really good show ready for you, but I am.

37:33.800 --> 37:39.800
I am building that content now, so we are almost there. We're almost fully back. I had a really productive weekend.

37:39.800 --> 37:47.800
I met a lot of really wonderful people again, and I also met some really new wonderful people.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.800
Most importantly, I will tell you, I really connected with Greg Glassman.

37:53.800 --> 38:08.800
I finally understood what him and Emily Kaplan are up to and why their work from a philosophical perspective is so central to my own work and how I am going to move forward.

38:08.800 --> 38:18.800
I've heard lots of people ask me and ask my wife, but how does Jay think that he can do this going forward? How can you just keep doing this?

38:18.800 --> 38:32.800
And we are going to keep doing this, GIGO and biological, but we're not going to keep chasing the same clowns that we have been chasing and we're not going to keep chasing the same running from the same clown cars that we've been running from.

38:32.800 --> 38:59.800
In fact, I think it's time for GIGO and biological, and for Jessica Hockett, and for Mark Koolack of Heucetonic Live, and a few others who are key in this space to now start to really take leadership roles in waking people up and moving the ball forward in the right direction and not being distracted any longer.

38:59.800 --> 39:09.800
And if you haven't seen it, Marcus, a couple short videos up. He's got a long video with Jessica Hockett. He has a new one coming up in the next day or two.

39:09.800 --> 39:24.800
And he had a short one from today, which details the long in the short, the very simple fact of the matter that putting someone on oxygen isn't as simple as putting someone on oxygen.

39:24.800 --> 39:42.800
And because of the pandemic and during COVID, we may have through silliness on TV, tricked people into believing that a small device that you put over your finger, if it reads a certain number, that that could be indication that you are near death.

39:42.800 --> 39:52.800
And that one of the ways to combat that reading would be to put someone on supplemental oxygen and putting someone on supplemental oxygen that doesn't need it.

39:52.800 --> 40:01.800
At too high of a concentration for too long is an absolutely certain way to do permanent damage to someone's lungs.

40:01.800 --> 40:11.800
And a lot of this damage, as it progresses, seems to resemble what you might think of as a progression of a respiratory disease in a hospital.

40:11.800 --> 40:25.800
And so it is very, very possible that one of the things that we have been overlooking from the very beginning is the idea that people that are put on supplemental oxygen that they don't need can be damaged by it.

40:25.800 --> 40:43.800
And if that damage is not taken as being caused by the oxygen, but instead being the body's inability to cope with a respiratory pathogen of known known origin, you can have a very serious problem on your hands.

40:44.800 --> 40:52.800
So yeah, we have some things to do. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of teaching to do. And we have a lot of broken science to fix.

40:52.800 --> 40:58.800
So how are we going to keep this going? We're going to keep it going forever. This is what we do now.

40:58.800 --> 41:09.800
This is a resource that not only do we need GIGO and biological and the broken science initiative and he was a tonic live and people like Jessica Hockett, but we need more.

41:09.800 --> 41:19.800
And so I'm going to get up and make the donuts every day. I hope you will start finding the ways that you can contribute to making the donuts.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.800
And I hope that all of us collectively.

41:24.800 --> 41:38.800
Yeah, I'm very optimistic. I'm very optimistic because I came home from that conference with four books.

41:38.800 --> 41:50.800
And those four books include probability theory and the logic of science by E. T. Janes.

41:50.800 --> 41:55.800
And although I don't, I'm not a probability guy. I'm not a math guy.

41:55.800 --> 42:05.800
I think it's time that I at least become competent. And so I'm not suggesting by any stretch of the imagination that I'm going to start teaching statistics.

42:06.800 --> 42:27.800
I am going to start to use ideas from this book and ideas from the stovebook to make sure that what I am learning from broken science is not lost on any of you.

42:27.800 --> 42:37.800
Because I have finally understood how important the ideas in this book are and how well they are often expressed in this book.

42:37.800 --> 42:47.800
And so I'm very excited because understanding how science is broken will start to teach us better.

42:47.800 --> 42:57.800
How to evaluate scientific papers, how to see a journal club in the correct way and how to analyze what a scientific paper did or didn't do.

42:57.800 --> 43:09.800
And what to expect from a scientific paper. And I think once we start to explore journal clubs from the perspective of broken science, from the perspective of what type of model are they proposing?

43:09.800 --> 43:17.800
What methods are they using to validate the model? What measurements are they making? And what scales are those measurements on?

43:17.800 --> 43:25.800
And, and what predictions have, has their model made that has been validated by future measurements?

43:25.800 --> 43:40.800
These kinds of terminologies and discussion points are going to become landmarks that we look for in every scientific paper that we respect and admire as something that has pushed our knowledge forward.

43:40.800 --> 43:53.800
And what we look for and miss in papers that aren't challenging the prevailing model, that aren't really challenging a model at all, that aren't even testing anything.

43:53.800 --> 44:08.800
And once we start to do this paper by paper, you know, publication by publication, observation by observation, I think all of us collectively are going to come together to understand how science was broken.

44:08.800 --> 44:17.800
How preparing falsification of hypotheses is actually not the scientific method that we've been looking for.

44:17.800 --> 44:31.800
It's not the scientific method that, that it was sold to be. And actually this guy stove is the dude that really, that really was able to figure it out. This is not a long book.

44:32.800 --> 44:39.800
And you can get through the first 15 pages of this book and pretty much already understand what Popper and these guys did.

44:39.800 --> 44:51.800
This books and its rights are owned by broken science and they are going to publish a much more handsome small copy of this very soon.

44:51.800 --> 45:00.800
And the PDF I think they actually already have on their website for free distribution. So if you're interested in it, look up the broken science initiative.

45:00.800 --> 45:23.800
It's Greg Glassman, it's Emily Kaplan, and it's a bunch of other people that they've brought together to try and reteach the philosophy of science correctly to our young people so that maybe over a single generation we can change back to something that resembles, you know, real modern science

45:23.800 --> 45:36.800
instead of this postmodern stuff where we're doing preparing and reiterative falsification and null hypotheses and this kind of thing.

45:36.800 --> 45:47.800
We're going to talk about all of this and I'm really, really excited about it. And Jay Kelly Kay, if you taught stats and research methodology for 30 years, well then I would be more than happy

45:48.800 --> 45:57.800
to collaborate with you on a beginner's stats ideas course, because again, I'm not looking to teach math.

45:57.800 --> 46:09.800
What I'm looking to do is teach people the logic of the scientific method and how we should be thinking about its wielding and how we are not thinking about it right now.

46:09.800 --> 46:18.800
And honestly, I've been to a few of these broken science meetings and they up until this one have been very intimidating.

46:18.800 --> 46:31.800
It's a lot of very accomplished people, independently wealthy people, independently don't give a hoot about anybody else people, because the world moves around them.

46:31.800 --> 46:40.800
You put all these people in a room together, at a dinner together with nice wine, and then you put me there.

46:40.800 --> 46:47.800
It took me a long time to feel comfortable in my own skin among these people.

46:48.800 --> 47:05.800
Even Matt Briggs, if you know this guy from Twitter, William Briggs, the celebrity of the stars or the statistician to the stars, he's a very, very down-to-earth guy, but from the perspective of intelligent wit and this kind of thing.

47:05.800 --> 47:09.800
He holds his own with anyone and he's comfortable there.

47:09.800 --> 47:16.800
But boy, I feel a lot like a privileged fly on the wall and I learn a lot by just keeping my mouth shut.

47:16.800 --> 47:24.800
But it's been a real privilege to be able to hang out with those people and to discuss my ideas and their ideas together.

47:25.800 --> 47:34.800
And I finally feel like this last visit was just such a crucial, I think I've been given a gift.

47:34.800 --> 47:38.800
And so I wanted to do all the technical stuff today.

47:38.800 --> 47:45.800
I wanted to see how many of these streams I could get working in OBS and I wanted to see how well peer to but work on first poll.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.800
And like I said, I'm going to send a message to Ted.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.800
We were, I mean, this is a 95% fully successful.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.800
I see rumble working perfect.

47:55.800 --> 48:02.800
I see YouTube is still perfect.

48:02.800 --> 48:08.800
And I don't even know if I, if someone is here on YouTube, it would be really great.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.800
I don't think I need to keep this open.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.800
Do I need to keep this open?

48:13.800 --> 48:18.800
I don't know if I need to keep the stream even open and it'll probably still stream.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.800
Trying to match the settings.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
That's possible.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.800
It's possible that I have to match the settings.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.800
I'm not sure it's supposed to be transcoding in the original settings.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.800
So if it's not doing that.

48:44.800 --> 48:52.800
I think it should just be doing that.

48:52.800 --> 48:57.800
So I don't know if you are running a virtual or you leave two cores to run OS dedicate all.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.800
Yeah. So see, it's on a server.

48:59.800 --> 49:06.800
So the peer tube server might just have two cores and it might only have four cores and it needs eight.

49:06.800 --> 49:12.800
And so instead of spending, you know, 17 bucks a month, maybe I have to spend 24 or something like that.

49:12.800 --> 49:14.800
We are going to figure this out.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.800
It is going to work.

49:17.800 --> 49:22.800
And we are, we are just a matter of, of, of tweaking.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.800
So I'm going to bed.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.800
Thank you very much for joining me.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
This has been giga ohm biological.

49:29.800 --> 49:36.800
I should play the song because we, we don't get to, we don't get to hang out very much lately.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
And I want to hang out more.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.800
We're going to hang out every day soon.

49:41.800 --> 49:44.800
My friends, every day very soon.

49:44.800 --> 49:45.800
I promise.

49:54.800 --> 49:55.800
I'm so excited.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.800
I don't know what to tell you, Annie.

49:57.800 --> 50:04.800
But I've got so many more handholds to share with you.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.800
So you too can start climbing on your own.

50:07.800 --> 50:18.800
And I am really excited to finally believe that I can use the Broken Science Initiative's ideas to enhance giga ohm biological.

50:18.800 --> 50:24.800
I used to think of them as a parallel but not, you know, really related outfit.

50:24.800 --> 50:33.800
And now I send them a central to it instructing how I go about identifying the problems

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
and how I've been doing it.

50:35.800 --> 50:43.800
But I haven't had the crisp semantics and I haven't had the backing of the, of the philosophy.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.800
You know, who's, who's philosophy?

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
And that's the trick.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.800
I met a, a professor from Germany who's going to be on the show to talk about this stuff as well.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.800
He describes P values as the way that we do science right now.

50:58.800 --> 50:59.800
It's a bit of a ritual.

50:59.800 --> 51:06.800
I'm also going to have a guy by the name of Malcolm Kendrick on who's an expert on statins and a class for all.

51:06.800 --> 51:11.800
And on the face of blood science.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
And I've got a few other people lined up as well.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.800
But I'm also really excited.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
I'm super excited.

51:19.800 --> 51:20.800
I'll see you guys really soon.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.800
Really, really excited.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.800
Check this out once.

51:26.800 --> 51:33.800
Okay, that works.

51:33.800 --> 51:44.800
Yeah, I think this is going to be just fine.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.800
I'll see you guys later.

51:46.800 --> 51:51.800
Thank you.
