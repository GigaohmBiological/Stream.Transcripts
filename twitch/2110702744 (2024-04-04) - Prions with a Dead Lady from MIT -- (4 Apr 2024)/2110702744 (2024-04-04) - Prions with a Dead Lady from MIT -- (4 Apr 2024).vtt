00:30.000 --> 00:32.000

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Does that look alright?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Mm-hmm.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That's my friend Nathan.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
He's dead.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.560

01:20.560 --> 01:23.060

01:23.060 --> 01:25.060

01:25.060 --> 01:28.040

01:58.040 --> 02:08.040
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.040
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.040
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

02:28.040 --> 02:57.040
I think the truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying we don't even recognize the truth no more than society.

02:57.040 --> 03:05.040
We want everybody to feel good. That's not the way life is.

03:05.040 --> 03:13.040
This episode is sponsored by Moink. That's Mo plus Moink.

03:13.040 --> 03:18.040
But you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it in people.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.040
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.040
You know I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

03:26.040 --> 03:30.040
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

03:52.040 --> 04:22.040
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data

04:22.040 --> 04:52.040
tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us

04:52.040 --> 05:22.040
that the latest data tells us that the

05:22.040 --> 05:52.040
latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that

05:52.940 --> 06:08.080
And that interview is going to entail meeting a EMT and another vaccine injured person from Canada I think it's going to be a really interesting discussion where we're going to try to stay focused on the biology.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.160
Of course, we're not going to be taking their bait.

06:10.160 --> 06:21.860
And of course we're going to be loving our neighbors even up in Canada so I'm looking forward to that, unfortunately because this is like a one man show with the help of my best friend as much a she can do and she keep us back,

06:21.860 --> 06:23.620
keeps the whole household running.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.780
It's new people sharing my work,

06:26.780 --> 06:29.940
so keep doing it, it's really working well.

06:29.940 --> 06:32.820
I mean, we're way below the number of subscribers

06:32.820 --> 06:35.900
that we need, but that doesn't necessarily mean

06:35.900 --> 06:37.420
that I'm pessimistic.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.700
I think actually we're doing pretty well.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.980
We're doing pretty well because I see the views,

06:43.980 --> 06:48.420
I see people sharing, I get feedback by email

06:48.420 --> 06:50.700
from people who are excited about the information

06:50.700 --> 06:53.140
that they're getting, not everybody can support.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.060
I get that, but the more we get this around,

06:56.060 --> 06:59.060
we're not looking for tens of thousands of subscribers.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.580
We don't need to have a sub-stack

07:01.580 --> 07:02.980
the size of Jessica Rose,

07:02.980 --> 07:06.380
we don't need to have a sub-stack the size of Robert Malone.

07:06.380 --> 07:09.700
I don't need 50,000 paid subscribers.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.140
We really just need a thousand.

07:11.140 --> 07:14.260
If we had a thousand, this family of five would be fine.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.900
I would be able to do this full-time.

07:16.900 --> 07:21.100
I think my wife would be able to do yoga

07:21.100 --> 07:24.740
and take care of our family as well

07:24.740 --> 07:26.700
as she's doing right now and better.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.460
And more importantly, this information

07:28.460 --> 07:31.140
would be sustainable forever.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.140
It would never stop.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.140
And so these people who courageously put their flag on mine

07:35.140 --> 07:37.700
or put their name on my flag,

07:37.700 --> 07:40.260
I can't thank you enough on behalf of me

07:40.260 --> 07:44.020
and my two sons and daughter and my best friend and wife.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.540
I mean, the independent Bright Web

07:46.540 --> 07:47.780
has got to start somewhere.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.900
And I think with people like Hugh Satanic Live

07:50.900 --> 07:52.740
with Mark Koolack doing his work

07:52.740 --> 07:54.940
with Jessica Hockett tearing up Twitter

07:56.260 --> 07:58.660
with Giga Home Biological now streaming

07:58.660 --> 08:00.700
at least two or three places all the time.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.820
I'm not streaming from YouTube today

08:02.820 --> 08:05.180
because I'm going to try to pull all of my stuff

08:05.180 --> 08:07.060
from YouTube Live.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.380
I didn't want to download it all

08:08.380 --> 08:10.300
and I hate to screen capture from YouTube

08:10.300 --> 08:11.460
because I'm lazy.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.340
So I'm going to use YouTube

08:13.340 --> 08:15.100
and so we're going to be streaming and pulling

08:15.100 --> 08:17.340
and so I wanted to keep that band move open.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.340
I don't know if that's going to be a trick that works

08:20.340 --> 08:21.660
but we'll see what happens.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.940
Never more than now.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.780
Is it true that this illusion is sustained

08:28.780 --> 08:31.860
only through our active participation?

08:31.860 --> 08:36.340
And every time they try to send up another signal flare

08:36.340 --> 08:38.540
like, oh my goodness, there's an eclipse coming

08:38.540 --> 08:41.860
and all the states are declaring a state of an emergency

08:41.860 --> 08:44.220
because they're going to shut down the internet

08:44.220 --> 08:45.060
or something like that.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.060
I mean, I guess that's possible.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.940
I think it's a lot more likely that the eclipse

08:50.940 --> 08:53.460
is going to cause a lot of people to want to go see it

08:53.460 --> 08:56.020
because they've got a chance to see something

08:56.020 --> 08:57.460
and they never may see again.

08:57.460 --> 09:02.460
And you know, the reality of Earth astronomy,

09:03.940 --> 09:05.420
I mean, if you want the real truth

09:05.420 --> 09:08.660
is I understand it unless you're a flat Earth Earth.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.900
Eclipse has happened quite often.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.220
It's just a question of are you there to see it

09:13.220 --> 09:14.980
and who's there to see it?

09:14.980 --> 09:16.500
And there's an awful lot of ocean

09:16.500 --> 09:18.340
over which eclipses can occur.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.980
And there's a lot of, you know, it's just all a,

09:22.980 --> 09:23.820
I don't know.

09:24.620 --> 09:28.580
I think if we stay focused and don't take the bait

09:28.580 --> 09:32.420
and assume that most of what's on that social media

09:32.420 --> 09:35.740
is bait, we're going to be all right.

09:35.740 --> 09:36.580
We're going to be all right.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.060
We stick together, everything is going to be fine.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.780
I have a real feeling that what we got to do

09:42.780 --> 09:44.140
is get biology in our head.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.420
Once we understand it better than they do,

09:46.420 --> 09:48.660
then we're immune, right?

09:48.660 --> 09:52.740
As long as we are vulnerable to bamboozlement

09:52.740 --> 09:56.700
because we lack the understanding then yes.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.580
But if we get the biology into our head as Jeff has,

10:00.580 --> 10:02.380
Jeff has really crammed it in there.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.980
I mean, he's taken it to a little extreme.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.820
I'll give you that, but, you know, God bless him.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.180
And in all seriousness,

10:12.180 --> 10:15.060
everybody should send some energy up to Canada

10:15.060 --> 10:19.180
because Jeff did that scar was made for a reason.

10:19.180 --> 10:24.180
And so we're, we're very happy that his recovery

10:24.500 --> 10:28.460
has been so relatively bump-free,

10:28.460 --> 10:31.300
but let's hope that it continues that way.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.740
Let's hope he stays in good health

10:32.740 --> 10:34.820
and the worst thing he has to pay attention to

10:34.820 --> 10:37.900
is his successful business being attacked

10:37.940 --> 10:40.780
by all the latest DEI and other crap

10:40.780 --> 10:42.980
that's going on in our world.

10:42.980 --> 10:43.820
Thank you very much.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.380
Jeff is a very good supporter of the stream.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.500
A crazy good supporter of the stream.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.260
Him and his wife, Cara, do a lot of stuff

10:50.260 --> 10:52.900
behind the scenes to organize a schedule

10:52.900 --> 10:54.060
that I don't pay attention to.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.540
So one of the reasons for example,

10:55.540 --> 10:58.820
that I'm gonna be on with Jason Levine this evening.

10:58.820 --> 10:59.660
Where the hell am I?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.980
What, what, what the?

11:03.460 --> 11:05.420
Shoot, hello, ladies and gentlemen.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.780
This is GIGO and biological,

11:06.780 --> 11:08.380
high-resistance low noise information

11:08.380 --> 11:09.740
brought to you by a biologist.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.460
It's April 4th, 2024.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.300
I apologize.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.260
I wasn't even looking at the screen at that time.

11:15.260 --> 11:18.180
We are in a situation where, you know,

11:18.180 --> 11:20.980
it's only a few of us, but it's people like Jeff and Cara

11:20.980 --> 11:25.300
in Canada that support, whoops, that's the wrong button,

11:25.300 --> 11:28.020
that support what I'm doing here

11:28.020 --> 11:30.460
and what, what, what me and my family

11:30.460 --> 11:32.180
are trying to accomplish more and more.

11:32.180 --> 11:34.820
It's becoming very obvious that this is a family affair

11:34.820 --> 11:38.340
because number one, I've always been aware

11:38.340 --> 11:41.260
that as I've been slowly losing my mind

11:41.260 --> 11:43.260
as a recovering academic biologist,

11:43.260 --> 11:45.140
that one of the reasons why I've been able

11:45.140 --> 11:46.540
to keep the train on the rails

11:46.540 --> 11:48.780
is because of my best friend and wife.

11:48.780 --> 11:51.740
Never once doubting me, even though clearly

11:51.740 --> 11:55.260
I was claiming that this guy was falling for several years.

11:55.260 --> 11:58.460
And so, yeah, thanks to her

11:58.460 --> 12:02.820
and thanks to my kids for also believing in their dad.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.620
And so, yeah, this is really an effort

12:05.620 --> 12:08.260
of just a family that rents their house in Pittsburgh

12:08.260 --> 12:10.260
coming to you live from a garage

12:10.260 --> 12:11.700
that looks a little better than a garage,

12:11.700 --> 12:14.180
but it's really not, we got kind of lucky

12:14.180 --> 12:16.140
when we had to move from our house

12:16.140 --> 12:17.980
that we hoped to own forever.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.300
In the north side of Pittsburgh,

12:20.300 --> 12:23.060
we got lucky enough to be able to move into a house

12:23.060 --> 12:25.820
that had a little kind of studio behind the garage.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.540
And we did choose it because as a family,

12:28.540 --> 12:31.380
already two years ago, we were already all in.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.060
And when we saw this house, it was like,

12:33.060 --> 12:35.460
well, we don't have enough bedrooms for the boys

12:35.460 --> 12:38.100
and the basement is small, but the garage is pretty big.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.500
It's big enough for your stupid motorcycle.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.540
And it's got this little wood shop in the back

12:42.540 --> 12:44.660
that you could make into a studio.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.140
And so for two years now,

12:47.140 --> 12:49.100
my kids have been sharing bedrooms

12:49.100 --> 12:54.100
and we're not suffering in some terrible way,

12:54.660 --> 12:57.300
but I just want you to see how it is really a family

12:57.300 --> 13:00.580
that's all in and I got a lot of credit needs

13:00.580 --> 13:03.300
to be given to my wife who doesn't get any,

13:03.300 --> 13:07.420
there's no memorial or star here for her.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.180
And she permits me to do all this stuff

13:10.180 --> 13:15.180
and basically facilitates it by never once

13:15.540 --> 13:18.060
having an even shadow of a doubt in me.

13:18.060 --> 13:22.460
So yeah, I can't say enough about that.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.380
So thank you very much.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.100
I don't know why I'm saying it on April 4th

13:25.100 --> 13:28.100
because this is not a special date for us.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.460
Anyway, where was I going to go with this?

13:30.460 --> 13:31.300
Oh yeah.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.140
So basically, of course,

13:32.140 --> 13:33.860
we're always breaking down the same thing.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.140
You just have to understand

13:35.140 --> 13:37.100
that they've been telling us stories for a long time.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.460
We've been governed by stories.

13:38.460 --> 13:43.020
You're a revolve, whatever that skinny golem looking guy.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.300
We'll tell you that we've always been governed by stories,

13:45.300 --> 13:47.980
but the question is just what kind of truth

13:47.980 --> 13:48.980
are you willing to tell?

13:48.980 --> 13:51.820
And we're never going to have informed consent

13:51.820 --> 13:55.820
as sovereign citizens of any republic

13:55.820 --> 14:00.140
unless we exercise that informed consent with action.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.500
That means basically educating yourself.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.940
You're going to have to learn what fractional reserve banking

14:05.940 --> 14:07.420
is, you're going to have to learn

14:08.580 --> 14:11.900
how the legislative process in the United States

14:11.900 --> 14:14.260
has been used against us for decades.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.500
You're going to have to understand

14:15.500 --> 14:18.420
how secret budgets have been used against us for decades.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.100
You're going to have to understand

14:20.100 --> 14:25.100
how the forward facing sort of people of government

14:25.740 --> 14:28.420
have been used against us by telling us stories

14:28.420 --> 14:30.020
that aren't directly related

14:30.020 --> 14:32.260
to what's really going on behind the scenes.

14:32.260 --> 14:36.220
We've always known that with foreign policy

14:36.220 --> 14:38.740
and with certain stories about marriage

14:38.740 --> 14:41.340
or what's happening in their personal life,

14:41.340 --> 14:42.580
but it never dawned on us

14:42.580 --> 14:45.580
that we would be governed by a complete,

14:45.580 --> 14:49.820
encyclopedic mythological state of reality

14:49.820 --> 14:52.780
where we don't really know the cutting edge of anything.

14:52.780 --> 14:57.660
And we've been told sort of cartoon versions of it

14:57.660 --> 14:59.820
so that we could be enslaved.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.620
And it's a kind of a dark narrative,

15:02.620 --> 15:04.340
but it's also a very hopeful one

15:04.340 --> 15:06.780
because if that's where we are right now

15:06.780 --> 15:09.860
when we still have houses and we still have running water

15:09.860 --> 15:12.340
and we still have roads that we can prepare,

15:12.340 --> 15:13.980
we still have bridges we can repair,

15:13.980 --> 15:17.300
we still have banks that we can close and audit.

15:17.300 --> 15:20.500
We still have an IRS that we can close and audit.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.220
We still have a federal reserve that we could close

15:23.220 --> 15:26.580
and audit we still have people that are alive,

15:26.580 --> 15:28.100
that know what's going on,

15:28.100 --> 15:30.460
that we could water board, for example.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.460
I mean, that's kind of a joke, of course.

15:32.460 --> 15:35.460
But there is still hope and I still feel hope.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.820
I don't think that they've come anywhere near

15:38.820 --> 15:41.260
to the kind of total control that they want us to believe.

15:41.260 --> 15:44.780
I still think it's very important to have a firm grip

15:44.780 --> 15:46.700
on the standing hypothesis

15:46.700 --> 15:49.260
of what recently happened over the last four years.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.700
I think that the who declared a pandemic

15:51.700 --> 15:54.220
of a dangerous novel virus that was detectable

15:54.220 --> 15:57.580
by a nonspecific PCR test that was likely rolled out

15:57.580 --> 16:02.580
in a background and its exposure was carefully curated

16:02.980 --> 16:06.900
to be misconstrued as spread using this test

16:06.900 --> 16:10.780
and a combination of media, bullets and financial incentives,

16:10.780 --> 16:13.700
which caused a mass casualty events.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.460
Those mass casualty events may have been coordinated

16:16.460 --> 16:19.580
by the US government, the Department of Homeland Security,

16:19.580 --> 16:22.340
the Department of Defense, I don't know.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.380
It's also possible that they could have seeded

16:24.380 --> 16:29.380
the molecular evidence for the virus being in Wuhan

16:30.020 --> 16:32.900
or in Iran or in Italy or in Washington

16:32.900 --> 16:34.540
in the Shohomish County man

16:34.540 --> 16:36.780
by using what is called an infectious clone

16:36.780 --> 16:41.460
because RNA virology is essentially based on this methodology.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.820
And after carefully thinking and reading

16:44.820 --> 16:47.740
and listening to other people talk about this stuff

16:47.740 --> 16:50.540
from decades past and currently,

16:50.540 --> 16:52.820
I have come to the very humble conclusion

16:52.820 --> 16:56.700
that people like Mark Bailey are correct about SARS-CoV-2.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.980
And in particular, I think we can summarize it best

16:59.980 --> 17:03.580
and most safely by saying that an RNA molecule

17:03.580 --> 17:05.300
cannot sustain a pandemic.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.740
And yet that's what we have been told has happened.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.060
And I believe that the reason why we are being told

17:10.060 --> 17:12.700
this mythology is so that we will teach it to our children.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.980
And the direct effect of that will be that they will submit,

17:15.980 --> 17:18.500
their sovereignty will be inverted into permissions

17:18.540 --> 17:21.220
because they believe a mythology that isn't real

17:21.220 --> 17:23.780
and therefore they will behave according to the edicts

17:23.780 --> 17:24.860
of that mythology.

17:24.860 --> 17:28.100
And as they turn up the heat and the coming years

17:28.100 --> 17:29.780
or even maybe a decade,

17:29.780 --> 17:32.260
then they can easily invert those rights

17:32.260 --> 17:35.020
to permissions in our kids, no problem.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.300
And of course, you've got to remember

17:37.300 --> 17:38.860
that social media is going to be working

17:38.860 --> 17:41.340
for those whole five years or those 10 years.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.420
Social media is going to be working very hard.

17:43.420 --> 17:47.420
Government is going to continue to govern us with mythologies.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.700
And so even if it doesn't happen now,

17:49.700 --> 17:52.820
it doesn't happen in a snap, it can happen over time.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.940
And that's exactly how this game has been played.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.860
COVID was like an abrupt thing

17:57.860 --> 17:59.340
to put everybody on their heels.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.140
But now that we're on our heels,

18:01.140 --> 18:03.500
there's not as much pressure needed.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.340
I don't know if you're a person who does Udo

18:06.340 --> 18:08.100
or any kind of martial arts,

18:08.100 --> 18:10.300
but once a person is off-balanced,

18:10.300 --> 18:13.220
then there's an incredible amount of force

18:13.220 --> 18:15.380
is no longer necessary.

18:15.860 --> 18:19.420
And so I think that we're currently in that state

18:19.420 --> 18:21.580
and being sort of taken advantage of in that way.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.260
And so we got to get our feet underneath this

18:23.260 --> 18:25.340
and the way we do that is with biology.

18:25.340 --> 18:28.580
And so I have broke down a couple of days ago,

18:28.580 --> 18:31.020
the basic thing that I think where we are now,

18:31.020 --> 18:32.460
it might have taken a while to get there.

18:32.460 --> 18:33.700
And so some of you people that thought

18:33.700 --> 18:35.900
I was going to repeat everything may have missed it.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.220
But I think it was two days ago,

18:37.220 --> 18:40.980
I did a stream where this is one of the slides in that talk

18:40.980 --> 18:43.540
and I'm basically addressing one, two and three

18:43.580 --> 18:48.580
in that discussion and in addressing the third one,

18:48.980 --> 18:51.700
we are trying to sort of get ahead of the dominoes.

18:53.660 --> 18:57.660
We identified the narrative of amyloidosis

18:57.660 --> 19:00.780
and pre-on generation by the spike protein already

19:00.780 --> 19:04.780
as kind of a red herring in 2020 and 2021

19:04.780 --> 19:06.660
when a number of people were very convinced

19:06.660 --> 19:08.380
that this was the story.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.580
I don't wanna call out any particular names,

19:10.580 --> 19:12.220
but there's more than one.

19:12.260 --> 19:14.980
And some of them I even had on my stream multiple times

19:14.980 --> 19:18.020
to talk about the various aspects

19:18.020 --> 19:21.700
of this spike specific toxicity

19:21.700 --> 19:23.980
and what aspects of it we could understand

19:23.980 --> 19:25.260
and not understand.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.660
And so one of the narratives that was running

19:27.660 --> 19:30.340
in the background as a worst case scenario

19:30.340 --> 19:33.100
with regard to the spike protein in particular

19:33.100 --> 19:35.860
was the idea that it was a pre-on generating

19:35.860 --> 19:38.700
or there was a pre-on motif in it

19:38.780 --> 19:42.260
or that it could cause crowdsfeld yachab disease.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.980
And one of the little hints of that

19:44.980 --> 19:46.260
is this letter B down here.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.300
I guess you can't see that because it's too small.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.660
I have to switch over here.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.060
Is this letter B?

19:52.060 --> 19:53.700
And then I'll get rid of this

19:53.700 --> 19:56.220
because that's supposed to be like this.

19:56.220 --> 19:59.380
This letter B down here is a Luke Montenier paper

19:59.380 --> 20:02.660
where I think it was 25 people who were injected

20:02.660 --> 20:07.500
with the original J&J or the original AstraZeneca

20:07.500 --> 20:12.500
developed acute crowdsfeld yachab disease.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.220
So that was cool, that's interesting

20:15.220 --> 20:18.340
but it had kind of in the beginning

20:18.340 --> 20:21.300
of the pandemic already was being taken out of context

20:22.300 --> 20:25.300
because those people were all convinced

20:25.300 --> 20:28.540
and uniquely, not uniquely,

20:28.540 --> 20:33.540
all united in their being convinced

20:34.420 --> 20:37.060
that the paper of Luke Montenier

20:37.060 --> 20:39.500
suggested that the spike protein did it.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.460
And so we had to be afraid of the virus

20:42.460 --> 20:45.540
and they didn't acknowledge the possibility,

20:45.540 --> 20:47.500
they didn't even spit out the possibility

20:47.500 --> 20:50.140
that it could be the transformation itself

20:50.140 --> 20:55.140
that was causing this acute protein misfolding disorder.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.500
Now, we're still in the gray area here.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.820
I'm not saying there are definitely pre-ons

21:01.820 --> 21:03.180
or definitely not pre-ons.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.900
What I'm trying to do is take a very objective approach

21:05.900 --> 21:09.420
to trying to look at the science that supports the idea.

21:09.420 --> 21:10.980
I don't wanna take a side on it

21:10.980 --> 21:13.660
especially with regard to the spike protein.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.020
I think it would be much more important

21:15.020 --> 21:18.620
to understand it as the biology as a phenomenon in general

21:18.620 --> 21:20.580
and then see if the spike protein fits it

21:20.580 --> 21:22.300
as a particular example.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.900
And I think that that's following the same sort of rubric

21:24.900 --> 21:27.740
that we did with COVID-19 because with COVID

21:27.740 --> 21:29.580
and SARS-CoV-2 we first started out

21:29.580 --> 21:32.580
with well, let's understand the immunology

21:32.580 --> 21:35.460
and the virology of coronaviruses in general

21:35.460 --> 21:37.860
before we start to try and understand the specifics

21:37.860 --> 21:40.260
of this particular story.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.420
And that got us very far, very quick.

21:42.420 --> 21:45.060
And I think that's why we were very successful

21:45.060 --> 21:46.900
in not getting too sucked in.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.660
And by 2021 we were already really pushing out.

21:50.660 --> 21:54.260
And I'm excited about this because I think

21:54.260 --> 21:59.260
this is kind of the same sort of, it's the right approach.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.940
So in doing it this way, my idea was to, again,

22:03.940 --> 22:07.780
as I said, use YouTube to do it.

22:07.780 --> 22:11.340
And so what I've found is this person named Susan,

22:11.340 --> 22:13.060
I'm gonna move my head for a second to see

22:13.060 --> 22:14.980
if I can see her name, Susan Linquist

22:14.980 --> 22:17.540
of the Whitehead Institute, MIT

22:17.540 --> 22:20.340
and the Howard Hughes, you know, Thingy Bobby.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.820
Now, of course that's already interesting, right?

22:22.820 --> 22:24.660
Because we know about the Whitehead Institute,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.380
we know about MIT.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.220
And if you go on YouTube, you will find an extraordinary

22:30.020 --> 22:35.020
number of videos about six, seven years old of this woman

22:36.100 --> 22:41.100
presenting lots of different takes on protein folding

22:41.260 --> 22:43.580
and how protein folding can go wrong.

22:43.580 --> 22:46.380
Now I'm choosing this one because I think it's a

22:46.380 --> 22:49.260
more general video that will help me introduce

22:49.260 --> 22:52.940
what I think is going to become essentially the main theme.

22:52.940 --> 22:54.820
And I'm just gonna say it right here out loud

22:54.820 --> 22:57.020
and then we'll see if that's what happens, right?

22:57.020 --> 22:58.740
We're gonna work through this together.

22:58.740 --> 23:02.100
But my feeling is, is that most of the biology

23:02.100 --> 23:07.100
in prions that is purported to be understood

23:08.780 --> 23:12.340
is actually understood in yeast.

23:12.340 --> 23:17.340
And so they have a yeast model of prionogenesis

23:17.700 --> 23:22.300
and how proteins can be a sort of genetic code

23:22.300 --> 23:27.300
all by themselves and how protein folding can be inherited.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.620
And they use this as a biological proxy

23:32.620 --> 23:36.580
and evidence for prionogenesis and prion disease

23:36.580 --> 23:41.580
and the mechanisms by which it occurs in other eukaryotes.

23:43.060 --> 23:44.500
And that's the really interesting thing.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.220
Yeast a single cellular cell organism has a eukaryote

23:48.220 --> 23:52.820
because it has a nucleus inside of a membrane

23:52.820 --> 23:55.060
and it's got some other membrane bound organelles.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.540
And so because the cells have some of the same

23:57.540 --> 24:00.500
or much of the same machinery that our cells do,

24:00.500 --> 24:04.500
we are considered part of the same large kingdom of life.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.940
And so molecular biologists studying prions

24:07.940 --> 24:12.660
have used yeast as a proxy for prionogenesis

24:12.660 --> 24:13.740
in our own cells.

24:13.740 --> 24:16.500
Now, that I'm not saying it's good or bad.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.220
I'm just wanting to understand the state of the art

24:19.220 --> 24:22.860
is that prions that we don't understand in nature,

24:22.860 --> 24:25.700
we don't understand on an island somewhere

24:25.780 --> 24:28.540
or we don't understand in a sheep field somewhere

24:28.540 --> 24:31.780
are often just assumed to work like the stuff

24:31.780 --> 24:33.900
that we have observed in yeast.

24:35.260 --> 24:37.740
And now we need to really focus together

24:37.740 --> 24:39.460
and you can do this work on your own too

24:39.460 --> 24:41.940
with PubMed and your own Google searches.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.180
We need to focus to what extent?

24:45.140 --> 24:49.820
The biology of these prions in yeast

24:49.820 --> 24:54.060
has been misconstrued as mechanistic evidence

24:54.060 --> 24:57.500
supporting the idea of how prionogenesis

24:57.500 --> 25:02.500
and these neurodegenerative diseases work in mammals.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.700
And now we're gonna have to work through this along,

25:07.700 --> 25:08.940
it's gonna take a long time.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.380
That's why maybe you thought

25:10.380 --> 25:12.380
I was just gonna throw papers up there.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.820
I did think that that's the way we would go about it,

25:14.820 --> 25:17.980
but it's become very clear to me after postponing

25:17.980 --> 25:21.300
for more than two weeks and trying to read more

25:22.300 --> 25:26.020
that in order to make my point as safely

25:26.020 --> 25:27.980
and as solid as possible,

25:27.980 --> 25:31.180
I'm gonna need to walk a little slower toward the exit

25:32.260 --> 25:35.820
because I don't wanna inadvertently somehow,

25:38.180 --> 25:41.420
yeah, not that I don't mind making mistakes,

25:41.420 --> 25:44.420
but I don't wanna make it easy

25:44.420 --> 25:46.340
for the people that are working against us

25:46.340 --> 25:49.140
to undermine what we're gonna do here.

25:49.140 --> 25:53.700
So I think the more we can let other experts speak for us

25:53.700 --> 25:57.500
and start to list the questions that we have

25:57.500 --> 26:00.980
and identify the potential incongruencies

26:00.980 --> 26:05.740
in their model, then we can more efficiently

26:05.740 --> 26:08.460
and more effectively move through the literature

26:08.460 --> 26:12.460
as we try to do journal clubs about prions

26:12.460 --> 26:14.500
because it's really important to understand

26:14.500 --> 26:17.740
what people like her see as the sort of big picture

26:17.780 --> 26:20.980
of what prions are and aren't and what they mean.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.820
And so I think this will be really interesting.

26:23.820 --> 26:26.180
I hope you will find it that way too.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.460
And we'll go from there.

26:31.740 --> 26:32.900
Let's see if this works.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.260
I just have an irregular speech.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.700
I'm Susan Lindquist.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.940
I'm at the Whitehead Institute

26:38.940 --> 26:41.500
in the Department of Biology at MIT

26:41.500 --> 26:44.180
and I'm here to tell you about protein folding.

26:45.180 --> 26:50.300
Protein folding is a universal problem of biological systems

26:50.300 --> 26:54.180
and it winds up influencing every aspect of biology

26:54.180 --> 26:55.340
that you can imagine.

26:57.260 --> 27:00.380
So these are very simple organisms

27:00.380 --> 27:02.420
called the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.660
It's a microorganism.

27:03.660 --> 27:06.300
This is obviously a very, very large magnification

27:06.300 --> 27:07.460
of these organisms.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.420
That organism is responsible for beer, bread, wine,

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
all kinds of things that make life worth living.

27:15.500 --> 27:20.220
Anyway, that organism is also a wonderful experimental system

27:20.220 --> 27:23.540
that has the same types of problems with protein folding

27:23.540 --> 27:26.380
that those organisms over there have.

27:26.380 --> 27:30.020
This is a universal aspect of life.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.860
And we're used to thinking about life

27:31.860 --> 27:34.500
in terms of all the very different things

27:34.500 --> 27:36.900
that make up different individuals,

27:36.900 --> 27:39.780
but there's a unifying principle of life

27:39.780 --> 27:42.020
that relates to protein folding

27:42.020 --> 27:45.740
and that plays out from this organism to that organism

27:45.740 --> 27:48.700
in ways that allow us to deeply understand

27:48.700 --> 27:51.460
some of the worst problems in human biology

27:51.460 --> 27:56.060
and try to find clever solutions at to fix them.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.140
So you understand already where she's at,

27:58.140 --> 28:00.940
she's suggesting to you that the cellular machinery

28:00.940 --> 28:02.860
of yeast is so similar to ours

28:02.860 --> 28:05.780
and what they do is so similar to what we do,

28:05.780 --> 28:10.220
they have the exact same problem, protein misfolding.

28:11.220 --> 28:14.700
And so it's a very interesting place to start.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.460
And you're starting at the stage where ribosomes

28:18.460 --> 28:19.860
don't work that well, I guess,

28:19.860 --> 28:22.460
or that proteins are unpredictable

28:22.460 --> 28:24.660
or something or something.

28:24.660 --> 28:26.780
And so it's gonna be very,

28:26.780 --> 28:28.580
just feel it going forward.

28:28.580 --> 28:31.300
She starts already with saying, I'm gonna warn you,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.420
we're using yeast, yeast is a great model.

28:34.420 --> 28:35.660
They're fantastic.

28:35.660 --> 28:38.380
The first point she makes is yeast equals humans.

28:40.260 --> 28:44.540
So I think that already should shed light on where we are.

28:44.540 --> 28:48.020
And it's a very gentle presentation,

28:48.020 --> 28:49.540
but it's a very, you know,

28:49.540 --> 28:52.780
that's a forceful assumption right there.

28:52.780 --> 28:55.100
We're gonna use yeast as a model

28:55.100 --> 28:57.180
for what our own systems have to deal

28:57.180 --> 28:58.780
with what our own systems do.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.820
So proteins are us, many people think.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.060
I'm gonna stop it again because that name right there,

29:08.060 --> 29:10.660
Venki Rama Krishnan,

29:10.660 --> 29:13.020
that's the guy who studies ribosomes.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.740
He's like got the Nobel Prize for it.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.500
Mark Coolack did a couple of videos,

29:17.500 --> 29:19.620
I think at least one video on him.

29:19.620 --> 29:22.100
And I find him a very interesting piece in the puzzle

29:22.100 --> 29:24.780
who I'm very curious what he thinks about prions

29:24.780 --> 29:27.260
and the role of ribosomes in them, et cetera.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.420
Anyway, I'll try to let it run.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.620
About proteins as being food.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.580
The reason why we think of them as being food

29:33.580 --> 29:36.740
is because we need to take some of those elements

29:36.740 --> 29:38.980
of proteins into ourselves,

29:38.980 --> 29:40.500
chop them up into little pieces,

29:40.500 --> 29:42.860
reassemble them into our own proteins

29:42.860 --> 29:45.500
because proteins do just about everything

29:45.500 --> 29:48.060
that you can think of in our bodies.

29:48.060 --> 29:52.820
Proteins are the muscle that powers our arms and legs.

29:52.820 --> 29:56.820
Proteins are carrying pigments in our eyes

29:56.820 --> 29:59.380
and it's when light strikes those pigments,

29:59.380 --> 30:01.700
it causes the protein to change shape,

30:01.700 --> 30:04.860
that sends a signal to our brain and that's how we see.

30:04.860 --> 30:07.060
Proteins are parked in our stomachs

30:07.060 --> 30:09.580
and ready to receive the food we eat

30:09.580 --> 30:13.220
and tear it apart into little component parts

30:13.220 --> 30:16.420
that we can use to build up new proteins

30:16.420 --> 30:19.940
that, as I mentioned, do just about everything

30:19.940 --> 30:24.020
in our biology that we think about as a living system.

30:25.420 --> 30:27.540
Now, the problem with protein folding

30:27.540 --> 30:31.220
is that these things look kinda complicated, right?

30:31.220 --> 30:32.900
And they are very complicated,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.900
but they start out very simply.

30:35.900 --> 30:40.420
So the code of life is often called the double helix

30:40.420 --> 30:44.900
and it's a very long linear string of information.

30:44.900 --> 30:48.020
It itself doesn't look too interesting,

30:48.020 --> 30:51.020
but along different parts of this,

30:51.020 --> 30:54.540
it codes for the essential elements of proteins

30:54.540 --> 30:56.540
that make up living systems.

30:56.540 --> 31:00.620
And a good analogy for the way in which this information

31:00.620 --> 31:04.540
is encoded in this long linear molecule

31:04.540 --> 31:07.500
is to think about cassette tapes.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.820
Now, cassette tapes were something

31:09.820 --> 31:12.060
I played all the time when I was young.

31:12.060 --> 31:15.380
I know that you're mostly playing CDs

31:15.380 --> 31:17.380
and other digital forms of music.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.380
But the cassette tape provides a really great analogy

31:20.380 --> 31:24.500
for the way in which very complex information

31:24.500 --> 31:26.420
can be encoded by a simple...

31:26.420 --> 31:29.420
Now, as a member of the Broken Science Initiative,

31:29.420 --> 31:32.540
I'd like to point out that she called this an analogy.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.700
And I think that's a very...

31:34.700 --> 31:37.540
It's appropriate for her to use that word

31:37.540 --> 31:40.660
because if she said this is a great model of DNA,

31:40.660 --> 31:43.380
then this model would make all kinds of predictions

31:43.380 --> 31:45.100
that don't work for DNA.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.660
And so she says it's an analogy

31:46.660 --> 31:50.300
because it actually weakens your potential understanding

31:50.300 --> 31:55.300
of DNA because unless the analogy is extremely on target,

31:55.420 --> 31:56.540
which it's not,

31:57.540 --> 31:58.820
if it was a good analogy,

31:58.820 --> 32:01.900
it would work as a pretty good model as well.

32:01.900 --> 32:05.860
And so keep that in mind as these people teach you biology,

32:05.860 --> 32:09.380
are they giving you an analogy which can serve then

32:09.380 --> 32:13.220
to make you understand their model better?

32:13.220 --> 32:16.340
Or is it an analogy that almost disarms you

32:16.340 --> 32:18.460
from even questioning their model?

32:18.460 --> 32:22.100
Because if you start to understand DNA as a cassette tape,

32:22.100 --> 32:23.500
then you've already been...

32:23.500 --> 32:25.180
You're already kind of limited

32:25.220 --> 32:26.820
in terms of how you're gonna understand

32:26.820 --> 32:30.020
how protein production results from that, right?

32:30.020 --> 32:35.020
It's a very subtle but spectacularly effective way

32:35.020 --> 32:40.140
to assume or pretend like you're really giving good information.

32:40.140 --> 32:44.620
When in reality, she's already undermined anybody

32:44.620 --> 32:49.620
without previous experience in her first two minutes.

32:50.940 --> 32:52.820
So it's only a 20 minute video,

32:52.820 --> 32:54.300
but it will take a while to get through it

32:54.300 --> 32:56.860
because it's very important for us

32:56.860 --> 33:00.820
to be able to efficiently do this,

33:00.820 --> 33:03.180
to be able to hear what people are saying

33:03.180 --> 33:04.500
and very quickly say,

33:04.500 --> 33:07.180
well, I understand biology like this.

33:07.180 --> 33:10.380
And so we know that DNA is more complicated than a cassette tape.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.380
We know it's not just a linear molecule.

33:12.380 --> 33:15.420
We know that there are all kinds of ways

33:15.420 --> 33:19.580
that that code can be intermixed, blocked, altered,

33:19.620 --> 33:21.060
methylated, whatever.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.220
We know that what we know is very little.

33:26.060 --> 33:28.500
And so it's frustrating that she says,

33:28.500 --> 33:30.140
this is a great analogy for it.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.940
It's a great analogy if you don't really want to understand

33:32.940 --> 33:36.180
where the irreducible complexity is

33:36.180 --> 33:37.660
and what we know about it, then yeah,

33:37.660 --> 33:39.060
this is a great analogy.

33:40.340 --> 33:42.140
Long thread.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.260
So here we go.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.420
Here's a cassette tape.

33:46.420 --> 33:49.540
You look at the tape that's wound around those two spools

33:49.700 --> 33:52.180
and it doesn't look the least but interesting.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.660
But when you put it into this machine

33:54.660 --> 33:56.620
that decodes the information,

33:56.620 --> 34:01.140
just like DNA is decoded in the machinery of the cell,

34:01.140 --> 34:05.140
outcomes the most amazing and complex and beautiful sounds.

34:06.980 --> 34:09.540
Oh, and those are proteins.

34:09.540 --> 34:13.220
She really thinks she's a good presenter.

34:13.220 --> 34:14.060
It's nice.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.340
You get completely different sounds.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.540
I'll probably turn that on.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.540
And another piece of the tape.

34:18.540 --> 34:19.540
Wow.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.540
And another piece of the tape.

34:21.540 --> 34:22.540
Wow.

34:22.540 --> 34:23.540
Wow.

34:23.540 --> 34:24.540
Wow.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.540
Wow.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.540
Wow.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.540
Wow.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.540
Wow.

34:28.540 --> 34:29.540
Wow.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.540
Wow.

34:30.540 --> 34:31.540
Wow.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.540
Wow.

34:32.540 --> 34:33.540
Wow.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.540
Wow.

34:34.540 --> 34:35.540
Wow.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.540
Wow.

34:36.540 --> 34:37.540
Wow.

34:37.540 --> 34:38.540
Wow.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.540
Wow.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.540
Wow.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.540
Wow.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.540
Wow.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.540
Wow.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.540
Wow.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.540
Wow.

34:46.540 --> 34:47.540
Wow.

34:47.540 --> 34:48.540
Wow.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.540
Wow.

34:49.540 --> 34:50.540
Wow.

34:50.540 --> 34:51.540
Wow.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.540
Wow.

34:52.540 --> 34:53.540
Wow.

34:53.540 --> 34:54.540
Wow.

34:54.540 --> 34:57.540
So how does that complexity get encoded in that simple linear molecule?

34:57.540 --> 35:06.540
Well, that's a problem biologists

35:06.540 --> 35:12.540
to fold up into very precise shapes in order to do anything interesting in the cell.

35:12.540 --> 35:18.780
I find it intriguing that there is no mention of RNA at all. Now mention of RNA editing,

35:18.780 --> 35:27.100
no mention of RNA three-dimensional shapes, no mention of RNA regulation, no mention of RNA

35:27.100 --> 35:35.100
interaction with the, wow, I mean we just went from DNA to protein, which of course even occurs

35:35.180 --> 35:41.660
in different compartments of our eukaryotic cell. Like, whoa, so now you see why that

35:41.660 --> 35:47.660
cassette tape analogy is incredible. If you combine it with this, now how much biology have you

35:47.660 --> 35:54.220
learned from the MIT lady? Are you ready to argue with somebody like Kevin McCurnan? I mean,

35:54.220 --> 36:00.140
that's, that's the frustrating thing here. And people can watch hours and, and they will be.

36:00.460 --> 36:07.980
And those shapes are incredibly complicated. So let's look at some real protein structures.

36:10.780 --> 36:16.140
You can see each of these different parts of the code has been decoded into long linear string,

36:16.860 --> 36:22.380
but that folds up and folds up and moves back and forth and back and forth on top of itself.

36:22.380 --> 36:27.100
And it's the complexity of this fold that can actually do something powerful.

36:27.980 --> 36:34.380
Now, the difficulty in terms of how this plays out into living systems is we don't really understand

36:34.380 --> 36:40.620
the forces that allow the protein to fold so precisely into exactly the right shape. What we

36:40.620 --> 36:44.860
are understanding, however, is that when they don't fold into exactly that right shape,

36:45.900 --> 36:53.900
disaster occurs. And a way of thinking about this, again, to kind of, to illustrate this,

36:53.980 --> 36:59.500
this process is to think again about that music, that long linear piece of information and a

36:59.500 --> 37:05.580
cassette tape that encodes extraordinary music. Well, it's played by instruments, right? And

37:05.580 --> 37:11.260
instruments are together playing together and they make great music. Just like the proteins

37:11.260 --> 37:16.220
are together in a cell and they make wonderful, wonderful biology and you have different proteins

37:16.220 --> 37:21.500
making different types of biology in your digestive system, in your brain, in your heart.

37:22.380 --> 37:30.700
The problem is that making these complex folds is very much like taking a lot, long sheet or

37:30.700 --> 37:35.980
square sheet of metal and moving it into forming a musical instrument.

37:40.620 --> 37:46.220
So if you get the fold exactly right, it can play some beautiful music.

37:46.220 --> 37:55.980
Music. But if there's some very small element of the fold that you get almost right, you don't

37:55.980 --> 38:08.380
get it quite right. It can be a disaster. And now the principle of prions, and I hope she's going

38:08.380 --> 38:14.860
to say that, is that there is a particular kind of fold where this horn can then sit next to other

38:14.860 --> 38:21.420
horns and ruin those horns as well. And so again, all of a sudden the analogy falls to pieces because

38:21.420 --> 38:29.820
their own model, well, that doesn't work with horns. And so you see what the issue is, when I make

38:29.820 --> 38:35.980
an analogy like this, the analogy is essentially the model and the model that I'm trying to use

38:35.980 --> 38:42.380
to make predictions that are validated in the future. And so unfortunately, this is not really a

38:42.380 --> 38:49.500
very good model, because remember, it's not a sheet of metal. It's three dimensional electrostatic

38:51.100 --> 38:59.260
shapes that are interacting with one another in a chain that are surrounded by a polar solvent

38:59.260 --> 39:09.900
called water, which we know has extraordinary attributes at a molecular scale. And so if these

39:09.900 --> 39:16.460
proteins are hydrophobic and hydrophilic, it's because they are electromagnetically hydrophobic

39:16.460 --> 39:23.100
or electromagnetically hydrophilic. And that changes their propensity to fold inside of that

39:23.660 --> 39:31.660
polar solvent. And so it's nowhere near the analogy of sheet metal. And it's nowhere near,

39:31.660 --> 39:37.740
this is not a misfolded protein. So unless she says that and prions are horns that cause other

39:37.820 --> 39:44.540
horns to crumple up, then she's not adequately taking this analogy to its logical conclusion,

39:44.540 --> 39:48.460
and therefore really not using it effectively, actually misleading people with it.

39:49.740 --> 39:52.300
Here's another example. Oh, she didn't even say anything.

39:53.020 --> 39:58.140
Piece of metal folding up into a different shape, making and doing different things.

39:58.140 --> 40:02.780
I love the French horn. It's the most beautiful sound.

40:02.780 --> 40:10.700
Right. A fold isn't quite right. It's a disaster. So now you've got this orchestra of proteins

40:10.700 --> 40:15.340
that make up the living system, and they need to play together exactly right. They need to

40:15.340 --> 40:20.380
fold properly, and then they need to play together exactly right. If you want the living system

40:20.380 --> 40:26.460
to be disease free. Wow, what an interesting, that's a whole protein instrument. That's a whole

40:26.460 --> 40:32.700
summary of biology and the broadest terms. You got to have rightfully folded proteins if you

40:32.700 --> 40:39.980
want the body to be free of disease. And it's not totally wrong. But it's interesting because this

40:39.980 --> 40:47.980
whole so far, this whole lecture has been to try and convince you of the primacy of protein folding

40:47.980 --> 40:55.020
and almost like we're always, I guess, having to deal with this problem. It's a big problem.

40:55.100 --> 40:58.060
Misfolded protein is a huge problem apparently.

40:59.580 --> 41:04.620
Are actually functioning together inside of a living cell. You're going to see pictures of

41:04.620 --> 41:11.420
proteins serving as architecture and the structural integrity of the cell. You see proteins talking

41:11.420 --> 41:17.900
to each other between cells. You'll see proteins cutting proteins, assembling into various structures,

41:18.940 --> 41:24.460
disassembling. And all of these are part of the orchestration of life inside the living cell.

41:25.180 --> 41:33.180
What is, oh no, we're going to use a cartoon to show us what it looks like so we're bamboozled

41:33.180 --> 41:40.380
into believing we know. That's what this is. It would be hard to imagine that any of this stuff

41:40.380 --> 41:46.700
is just exaggeration, right? Obviously they must know all this stuff. This must be backed by

41:47.180 --> 41:52.700
thousands of papers. Otherwise they wouldn't make such a video, right?

41:52.700 --> 42:18.860
Wow, look how that works. Gee, it just all does it. They just all assemble. That's so cool.

42:23.500 --> 42:34.060
I mean, if they can make a cartoon like this, that must be how microtubules assemble.

42:34.700 --> 42:41.580
This must be how dyin' in halls, vesicles around, must be moving along the information

42:41.580 --> 42:46.780
highway of the cell and bringing pets of goodies from one end of the cell to the other end of the

42:46.780 --> 42:51.740
cell. Anyway, you can see I think. I'm not saying it doesn't happen that way.

42:53.100 --> 43:00.220
I'm suggesting to you that there are aspects of this video which are assumed because one or two

43:00.220 --> 43:06.140
of aspects of this video are actually fairly well understood. And since we understand one or two of

43:06.140 --> 43:10.460
these things, why can't we make assumptions about all this stuff? And one of the things that is

43:10.460 --> 43:15.580
assumed is that somehow or another, these subunits of all these proteins just come together,

43:17.580 --> 43:21.580
and now in a little while, she's going to show you another video, but she's not going to point

43:21.580 --> 43:26.940
out that this video, if the other video is correct, then this video is totally wrong.

43:27.660 --> 43:32.220
And she's not going to point that out, but she's going to, at some point, make an argument that

43:32.220 --> 43:36.940
it's really crowded in a cell, but this is not a crowded cell. There aren't proteins everywhere

43:36.940 --> 43:42.700
here. And so it's a very interesting, you know, we're going to flip flop back and forth over here,

43:42.700 --> 43:45.820
and that's because she thinks you're asleep or something, I think.

43:47.180 --> 43:51.660
The extraordinary complexity of living system and the proteins that are operating in it

43:51.660 --> 43:56.300
to keep us biologically active and do all the amazing things that we can do.

43:57.740 --> 44:04.220
I urge you, by the way, to get on the web and plug in that reference and take a longer look at

44:04.220 --> 44:08.620
the movie. And there's also an animation that will tell you exactly what you're looking at all

44:08.700 --> 44:11.660
in various parts of it. I've just shown you a very small snippet.

44:12.620 --> 44:20.620
But this incredibly complicated biology that's represented by this beautiful movie

44:21.580 --> 44:27.500
is misrepresented in just one particular way. And that is that in order to illustrate how

44:27.500 --> 44:31.420
these proteins are moving about and doing their things and interacting with other proteins in

44:31.420 --> 44:36.700
the cell, they've taken most of the proteins out of that system so that you can see them.

44:37.660 --> 44:42.380
In reality, the cell is much, much, much more crowded.

44:43.580 --> 44:44.540
Okay.

44:44.540 --> 44:50.060
So you think about this complicated protein fold and the fact that different proteins have

44:50.060 --> 44:55.420
different folds, they have to go from a long linear string of amino acids into those complicated

44:55.420 --> 45:02.140
folds so that they can interact with themselves properly. And they have to do that in a really

45:02.220 --> 45:08.940
crazy environment. They have to do this in an environment that's this packed with proteins.

45:08.940 --> 45:15.420
So each one of these colors actually represents a different protein in its complex, beautiful

45:15.420 --> 45:22.780
shape that can change and move around and do various things. But this image, although it

45:22.780 --> 45:27.980
represents the crowding of the cell, is missing one other piece. By the way, this is a beautiful

45:27.980 --> 45:32.860
movie by Adrian Elcock. And again, you can find it on the web.

45:34.380 --> 45:41.420
The thing that this particular image does not convey is how energetic the system is.

45:41.420 --> 45:45.580
Proteins are actually moving about like crazy all the time. And it's this aspect of proteins

45:45.580 --> 45:50.060
being able to move and signal from one end of the cell to the other end of the cell,

45:50.860 --> 45:56.540
help us to interpret what we see one moment and I'm looking here at you or looking over here at

45:56.620 --> 46:00.460
the screen. I completely change everything I understand about what I'm looking at because

46:00.460 --> 46:06.860
the proteins are changing shape so fast. So living systems have proteins that work at incredible

46:06.860 --> 46:11.900
speed. And here's an example of the way they move about and how the crowding is

46:12.940 --> 46:17.820
jostling and banging to each other all the time. So what's missing in her explanation here,

46:17.820 --> 46:24.220
what's crucial to understand is that this is not happening in free space, right? It's happening

46:24.220 --> 46:29.980
in the polar solvent of water at the molecular scale. So there is a potential for there to be a

46:29.980 --> 46:37.660
lattice here. There are potential for there to be much more space between proteins, which is occupied

46:37.660 --> 46:45.420
by less than, I mean, water is not water at the molecular scale. Water at the molecular scale is

46:45.420 --> 46:51.820
like puzzle pieces that can kind of get locked into place, right? And so they can form kind of a

46:51.820 --> 46:57.180
crystal lattice at that, at that size scale. So do they move around like this? Probably, but

46:57.180 --> 47:03.020
they're moving around like this in the context of a polar solvent. And so other things can happen

47:03.020 --> 47:08.860
besides this. And I think that for the moment, I'm just going to say that I think this is

47:09.740 --> 47:17.980
terribly insufficient to describe what's happening. And so she's sort of hand waving over what is one

47:17.980 --> 47:24.780
of the most beautiful places that you can bring someone to understand the irreducible complexity

47:24.780 --> 47:31.740
of a cell. Because if you were to, you know, adequately explain how water plays a role in this,

47:31.740 --> 47:39.740
and that sort of bring them down to understand what water is, and how that molecular three-dimensional

47:39.740 --> 47:49.420
charged shape, polar shape, can have real physical phenomenon at that scale, and how that would then

47:49.420 --> 47:56.220
interact with these highly polarized giant molecules, it becomes a far more compelling

47:57.100 --> 48:02.940
place for your imagination to go as a biologist looking for the, you know, the edge where the

48:03.020 --> 48:09.420
irreducible complexity starts. And it feels as though this is hand waving over that instead of

48:09.420 --> 48:14.380
pointing out this is where it is. This is the irreducible complexity that we're having a lot

48:14.380 --> 48:21.260
of fun exploring, but we have no real hope of cracking in the sense of all knowing.

48:22.940 --> 48:29.580
And that's frustrating, but okay, let's go. The one way in which this animation doesn't quite convey

48:29.580 --> 48:36.860
what's happening in the cell is that it too, for the purposes of clarity, has been modified

48:36.860 --> 48:44.700
in a certain way, and that is it's been slowed down. So just as the other movie I showed you,

48:44.700 --> 48:50.620
this was not very crowded, and things are moving around rather slowly, in this movie which shows

48:50.620 --> 48:58.140
the crowding, things are actually not moving at real speed. So you can illustrate and understand

48:58.220 --> 49:01.740
and look at how these proteins are interacting with each other and moving around.

49:03.020 --> 49:07.020
In order to get a realistic idea of how fast these proteins are moving around in the cell,

49:07.660 --> 49:13.980
you'd have to speed that movie up not ten times, not a hundred times, not a thousand times,

49:13.980 --> 49:21.740
not a hundred thousand times, but one million times. So that movie is real slow motion compared

49:21.740 --> 49:27.420
to what's happening in the biology and living system. And there you have the heart of the protein

49:27.420 --> 49:33.340
folding problem, because if these long linear strings of amino acids have to fold up into these

49:33.340 --> 49:39.260
very, very precise shapes without getting into trouble with other proteins while they're doing it,

49:39.900 --> 49:45.980
under such incredibly kinetic energetic conditions, you can imagine that sometimes they get that

49:46.060 --> 49:51.580
fold wrong, just like those musical instruments, if you don't, but don't fold the metal exactly.

49:51.580 --> 49:56.300
I really feel something's wrong with this. I don't know how to say it any other way that I

49:56.300 --> 50:01.260
don't think that that is a good portrayal of what goes on inside of a cell given what we've seen

50:01.260 --> 50:07.340
under a microscope, given what I've seen under a microscope. I don't believe it anymore. So

50:10.460 --> 50:15.660
I'm doing some reading on the side over here, and I'm just not buying this. I think that this

50:15.660 --> 50:19.980
is one of those things where if you can make a computational biology paper, look at that.

50:20.940 --> 50:26.780
It's right there. If you can make a model of something like this, that's great. That's perfect,

50:26.780 --> 50:32.780
because that's exactly what we have with that model of the end protein and the RNA getting

50:32.780 --> 50:38.780
packaged into a endosome with spike protein on the outside of it. We made a beautiful model

50:38.780 --> 50:44.300
of how this works, and we have all kinds of variables in our model, and it just works out great.

50:46.140 --> 50:51.420
And that's what I think this is. It's designed to confuse you. It's designed to make it again,

50:51.420 --> 50:57.660
seem like everything that happens in a cell is just a random, it's just a random nonsense.

50:57.660 --> 51:04.380
It is not a clock. Don't think of a cell like a clock. Think of it as a sack of assorted beans

51:04.380 --> 51:10.380
that you just get, gets lucky all the time. Think about that. She's trying to convince you

51:10.460 --> 51:17.020
that our cells work like this, and just the right enzymes come together, the right

51:18.620 --> 51:26.780
tRNA shows up at the right ribosome at the right time through all of this mess. I mean, come on, come on.

51:29.980 --> 51:34.540
Right. It could ruin an orchestra. The same thing can happen in living systems.

51:35.500 --> 51:39.900
And when you say what I see on a microscope is on a fixed slide, it's actually not. I've

51:39.980 --> 51:47.980
looked at live neurons. I've looked at live cell cultures of all kinds of cells in my career,

51:47.980 --> 51:53.100
and they're all alive. And when you use fluorescence or you use other kinds of

51:54.140 --> 52:03.020
means of labeling different parts, then you can see them. I've watched a frog embryo divide to

52:03.020 --> 52:08.700
48 cells once by staying in a laboratory for almost 48 hours straight.

52:10.860 --> 52:16.620
So I've definitely taken the time to look under real microscopes at real living cells.

52:17.500 --> 52:24.700
In fact, I had a couple friends at Pitt that I just spent time with in the confocal microscope

52:24.700 --> 52:29.020
room just because of what they were doing. And at least one of them was working on hippocampal

52:29.020 --> 52:34.060
cell cultures. So again, that's live cells with with several different fluorescent labels. And so

52:34.060 --> 52:40.060
you can see the space inside of the cells can't possibly look like what she just showed you. Otherwise,

52:40.060 --> 52:44.700
you wouldn't be able to watch the trafficking of proteins and stuff like that, right? I mean,

52:44.700 --> 52:50.940
that's just weird. It's strange. I don't know. And now this this if she's going to say this

52:50.940 --> 52:54.540
has something to do with prions, I'm going to be very sad.

52:55.420 --> 53:02.220
So I want to give you one more illustration, one more analogy. What happens when proteins start

53:02.220 --> 53:07.340
to misfold and bang into each other in inappropriate ways and stick to each other and

53:08.700 --> 53:15.900
something a process we call protein aggregation? And you know exactly what protein aggregation is

53:15.900 --> 53:24.060
like. I know that you've seen it many times. The egg white in this little photograph is actually

53:24.140 --> 53:28.380
a solution. I think we should just go back because before she ruins this idea,

53:29.180 --> 53:33.660
I want to put something else on the screen. Think about this for a second.

53:41.100 --> 53:45.500
Yeah, I really want to say, okay, I'm going to let her I'm sorry, I'm going to let her speak.

53:45.500 --> 53:51.020
I don't want to ruin too much. I don't want to say too much. I just I want to let it go.

53:51.020 --> 53:57.020
So I want to give you one more illustration, one more analogy. What happens when proteins

53:57.020 --> 54:02.460
start to misfold and bang into each other in inappropriate ways and stick to each other and

54:03.820 --> 54:11.020
something a process we call protein aggregation? And you know exactly what protein aggregation is

54:11.020 --> 54:19.260
like. I know that you've seen it many times. The egg white in this little photograph is actually

54:19.260 --> 54:25.660
a solution of protein. The proteins are all folded properly and so they're clear and beautiful

54:25.660 --> 54:32.380
and not in any trouble. But when you apply heat to that system, the proteins start to move around

54:32.380 --> 54:37.580
a little faster. They start banging into each other. They start unfolding a little bit. And what

54:37.580 --> 54:44.540
happens is the properties of the biological system change completely. And that is in fact what you

54:44.620 --> 54:50.460
get. So those and so this is actually a combination of the boiling of water, right?

54:51.900 --> 54:58.060
And the denaturing of protein. So they go to a linear form. Now the reason why this is annoying

54:58.060 --> 55:03.020
is because supposedly prions are you can't you can't you can't destroy them with heat.

55:04.460 --> 55:10.300
So then prions don't are not related to that. Because if prions are a kind of protein

55:10.300 --> 55:17.340
configuration that is immune to heat, immune to auto-claving, then this is not a good analogy

55:17.340 --> 55:23.660
because they are proteins that can't be denatured, I guess. Why don't we use the word denatured here

55:23.660 --> 55:29.900
because then when we come to proteins, she could say that proteins like prions can't be denatured.

55:31.500 --> 55:36.460
In all of the reading that I've done in preparation for taking you through this part of the cave,

55:37.420 --> 55:44.380
I have never heard anyone say that proteins can be denatured, but prion proteins cannot be denatured.

55:44.380 --> 55:51.500
Even though as a biologist, since I was at least in high school, this is denatured protein.

55:52.140 --> 56:00.300
Protein that is linearized linear, I can't even say it, is made linear by the application of

56:00.300 --> 56:05.900
heat because you break all the hydrogen bonds because you of course increase the kinetic energy

56:05.980 --> 56:18.860
of the water. I'm just very curious as to where this is going. And I know that I think you're going

56:18.860 --> 56:24.620
to enjoy this journey that we go on. And I think at the end of this, we're going to have a very,

56:24.620 --> 56:29.980
very succinct message about what's going on here. And we're going to be able to say, look,

56:30.060 --> 56:35.660
anybody that's pushing this and is not saying very specifically that

56:35.660 --> 56:41.500
transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent because one of the worst case scenarios

56:41.500 --> 56:50.860
is a protein misfolding disorder, then they're being extremely disingenuous. They are not playing

56:50.860 --> 56:55.100
for our grandchildren. They were playing for team worst case scenario from the very beginning.

56:55.100 --> 57:00.780
Anybody that sold this as a as a part of the spike protein on the virus, I'm going to put

57:00.780 --> 57:05.900
all my chips on the fact that they have to be working against us, at least in America.

57:07.660 --> 57:14.780
Most of the people that are anybody that's fighting for the American Republic and whatever's left of it

57:16.940 --> 57:24.460
cannot by definition have been pushing the pre on hypothesis in 2020 or 2021 because they had to be

57:25.340 --> 57:30.620
either wittingly or unwittingly involved in ceding that narrative because there was,

57:30.620 --> 57:36.620
it had nothing to do with that. It had only to do with transfection and the potential for it.

57:37.900 --> 57:45.100
And this complete whiff. This is a whiff. If you're not a baseball fan, it's when you swing and you

57:45.100 --> 57:48.940
miss, you have a perfect pitch. It's right down in the middle. You could hit a home run with it.

57:49.020 --> 57:56.380
You got a great big giant bat and you missed because she could just say this is denatured

57:56.380 --> 58:01.900
protein. And so she could make two points with one. You've seen proteins that go into aggregate

58:01.900 --> 58:06.460
aggregate proteins are often denatured ones. The examples that you know of are scrambled eggs.

58:07.820 --> 58:12.860
But interestingly, prions are really cool because they can't be denatured. So when you apply heat

58:12.860 --> 58:18.220
to them, they don't go away. And now she's made an adequate analogy. But instead,

58:18.940 --> 58:24.220
this MIT professor says that this is aggregate protein. It's not denatured protein. It's

58:24.220 --> 58:30.860
aggregated protein, which is really weird because she has to know that's wrong.

58:30.860 --> 58:43.820
These are aggregated proteins. And it's just a nice visual illustration of the problem that

58:43.820 --> 58:50.780
can occur when proteins don't fall properly in our living systems. So we want to understand

58:50.780 --> 58:57.100
how we can keep the proteins looking more like this and how if they start to go off.

58:57.100 --> 59:04.620
I just said it right there. I think that using modified RNA to transfect healthy humans is a

59:04.620 --> 59:09.660
I don't see any reason why that couldn't result in protein misfolding. They're using a chemically

59:09.660 --> 59:16.380
modified codon optimized viral RNA or that an RNA that they claim came from a virus. And they're

59:16.380 --> 59:21.020
transfecting healthy humans with it. So do I know what's going to happen? Absolutely not.

59:21.020 --> 59:25.900
As far as I'm concerned, we should leave room on that list no matter how many things we add to it

59:25.900 --> 59:31.580
because there's always possibly another one. And one of them, unfortunately, I think is possible

59:31.580 --> 59:36.380
is a protein misfolding disorder. Why not? I don't know if we understand these things yet,

59:36.380 --> 59:43.020
but I'm going to show you that I think we understand a lot less about the protein misfolding disorders

59:43.020 --> 59:49.340
that we seem to find in mammals versus what we purport to understand in yeast. And that's the

59:49.900 --> 59:55.660
disconnect and maybe contradiction or incongruency that is being weaponized against us.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.980
Pathway and start to form little bitty aggregates. We can bring them back to life.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:09.340
Because just a little bit of that aggregation state causes disaster for a living system.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.380
So what are the solutions that life I don't I don't like this analogy at all.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:19.420
The first way we started to discover and learn something about the solutions to that problem

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:27.180
actually involved heat. So here we have a very simple experiment that was done with yeast cells.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:35.260
We're growing yeast cells in a culture, in a shaking roman mire flask. And we took some of those

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:41.100
cells out. We took two identical alichlots of cells out. What I mean by an alichlot is just a

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:48.060
little portion of the culture. Two identical portions of the culture out. And that one on the

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:54.620
top there was exposed directly to a high temperature. And the proteins denatured and killed the cell.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:01.100
This one on the bottom was first exposed to an intermediate temperature to allow it to

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.420
kind of condition. Basically it was exposed for half an hour to 39 degrees instead of being

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:12.940
shifted directly to 50 degrees. And as you can see that short half hour pre-treatment

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:20.540
provided tremendous increased capacity of the cells to survive that second higher heat treatment.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:30.220
Now this is a universal property of life. And so it is not only true for yeast cells. It's true

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.540
for a rabbit opposite seedlings. This is basically the same experiment. A rabbit opposite seedlings

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:39.500
were planted in these little dishes. One treated directly at high temperatures. The other one

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.140
given this intermediate treatment that allowed it to condition itself. And then to withstand

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:51.260
the rigors of that more intense condition. And these are human cells in culture. Basically

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:57.180
the same experiment. You can do this experiment with all living organisms on earth. Because all

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:03.980
living organisms face the same problem of protein folding. And they all prepare for problems in

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:10.700
protein folding the same way. By making other proteins that help proteins to stay in their

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:17.340
normal shapes and sizes. So how do we find out what they're doing during those conditioning

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:23.340
pre-treatments? Okay so here's where the bridge gets made. Right now they do heat treatments on those

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:31.740
eridopsis things are on those human cells. And we need to do the the real leg work to find out if

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:36.300
the genes that are activated have anything to do with the genes that are activated in the yeast.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.860
Because that's where we're going now. Now we're going to look at the genes and the proteins that

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:47.660
are activated in the yeast in that heat experiment. And I think although I could be wrong a lot of the

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:55.580
correlates in the eridopsis experiment or the correlates in a human cell experiment haven't

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:03.180
been fully developed. And so will can we we need to go through there's a lot of literature here.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.540
So this is not a small task. Okay it's not going to be you know Saturday afternoon biology

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:13.580
prions don't exist anymore. We need to understand it and in order to understand it it's a lot of

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.940
work. And so for a while I've been thinking that I would just prepare the summary lectures

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:23.580
and that would be fine but it's become more and more apparent to me that I need to really

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:30.060
bring everybody along with me in order that you see why there's so much work necessary. Why we

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:36.780
have to break it down. And why after a week or two we might decide that wow this is an incredible

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.860
distraction and maybe that's the whole reason why we were throwing this in the beginning. But in

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:46.700
so doing in doing this exercise what we're going to be able to do is definitively say okay so do

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:52.060
we need to worry about this or not. And who doesn't need to worry about it why do they need to worry

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:57.820
about it how can we use this story to move our ball forward and that's that's what this is about.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:03.580
And I think that already you're starting to see it right here I hope I chose this video correctly

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:09.580
so that you can it's a good on ramp to see how these shells are going to be moved around where

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.620
sometimes we're talking about human cells and and whatever and sometimes we're talking about yeast

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:20.460
and so it was interesting that she went to plants and an aerodopsis but we'll see we'll see what

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:27.020
she's got for us. What we do is we again take out a small portion of the cells and label them

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:34.860
with radioactive amino acids so that as the shell is making its own proteins each of those proteins

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:41.100
will get radioactive amino acids incorporated into it. That allows us then to visualize it what's

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:47.740
happened we spread those proteins out on a gel and we put a film on top of it and wherever there's

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:53.500
radioactivity from a newly made protein we can see the imprint will line on the gel.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.980
And so you can see that at 25 degrees the normal temperature for this organism it's making one

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:05.420
group of proteins. At 39 degrees it started making a whole bunch of other proteins and the

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.860
sole function of all of those proteins is to cope with this protein folding problem.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:17.020
Her assumption is the function of all those proteins is to cope with the folding problem.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:22.540
That's an extraordinary thing to say. I'm sure she's done a lot of experiments they're all called

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:28.620
heat shock proteins but already we're working with high levels of certainty even though her

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:35.740
introduction was was subpar at best. They help other proteins in the cell maintain their normal

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:42.940
shapes or to get rid of them when they've lost their normal shapes. Now this is a very broadly

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:48.460
used survival response we first started working with it with heat because that's an awful simple

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:55.100
manipulation to make within the laboratory but it turns out these same proteins provide protection

01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:01.740
against all sorts of different difficult conditions changes in pH, changes in the energy balance

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:09.180
of the cell, changes in osmotic strength, many many many different changes in the cell. In fact

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:13.740
but then doesn't that suggest that they should always be there and that this is just a change

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:20.300
in relative abundance? Wouldn't you always need those there then? I'm curious about that because

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:26.780
that seems to also indicate then that there are situations where the danger of misfolding is

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:32.940
higher or lower depending on the concentration of these proteins, right? There's a lot of things

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:38.860
that their model makes predictions about that they just kind of talk around. That's where I

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:45.180
used to annoy people all the time in neuroscience as well because they make these ridiculous simple

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.060
models of the animal's behavior and it's like well dude if that's your model you could do a

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:58.140
really easy experiment to test that why don't you do that first and so make sure you see what's

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:06.300
happening here. This is how academic biology has gotten so twisted up in itself because everybody

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:12.140
does this. Everybody gets their own little story tells it their own little way with their own

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:20.220
little characters that are the main story. When I started in in biophysics in 2001 as a

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:32.780
sodium, potassium channel expert wannabe that that I learned from my my supervisor that that

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:37.820
potassium channels that are activated by calcium are orchestrating the entire brain

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:46.780
and we made arguments in prose and discussed how important they were for the finest tuning

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.060
of neurons and the finest tuning of neurons is what matters

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.780
and so if you have a story about SK channels then that's the story you tell

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:07.420
and she has a story about heat shock proteins and so her story is about how yeast is a great

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:14.780
proxy for the protein folding challenges of all other eukaryotic life and so my work is

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:20.540
applicable to all other eukaryotic work. It's a pretty awesome place to be working

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:27.580
and these heat shock proteins are made exclusively to chaperone and to prevent

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:33.900
misfolding and also to get rid of them when they do misfold so we don't need them all the time or

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:40.780
or what strange what what does those jobs when when the heat shock proteins haven't been called

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:46.300
into action we don't have any part of that model nothing about that model is explained.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:52.460
These proteins are constantly being made made in smaller amounts over and over and over again

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:58.540
to help cope with this very broad problem in protein folding. So this very broadly used

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:03.180
survival response as I showed you yeast cells I showed you arabidopsis ceilings

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:08.860
arabidopsis is a small little mustard plant I showed you human cells every organism on earth

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:13.980
is making very highly conserved very similar patterns of proteins under these stress conditions

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:19.980
and it turns out that that plays into human biology and medicine and just an extraordinary

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:26.860
variety of different ways. One of the major reasons why we want so deeply to understand

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:34.700
this problem is that it drives many aspects of human disease. So one of the things that it drives

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:41.580
is the process of infection when organisms come into our body and you can see here we've got

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.980
a fungus that is growing under normal conditions not inside the body but when it starts to grow

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:54.460
inside the body it senses this change in temperature and it and it starts to realize that it can

01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.780
invade the biological system and the only way it can do that is by making new proteins and by

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:05.820
making this survival response that allows those new proteins to fold properly.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:14.620
So that's one aspect of disease biology that uses that survival response all the time.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:20.300
Here's another aspect of human biology that uses the survival response. So what you have

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:29.020
in blue is normal proteins and what you have labeled in brown here is the master regulator

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:36.060
of the survival response and that's normal tissue over there and you can see that the survival

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:42.220
response protein is kind of tucked away in little corners of the cells because it's not being used

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:49.900
under this normal biological system but in the cancer cells you can see that that master regulator

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:55.340
has been amplified a great deal it's actually present now in the center of the cell and it's

01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:00.700
directing a whole new program of gene expression whole new sets of proteins are being made

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:07.420
at the dictum of the cancer cells to help protect those cancer cells and drive the malignant state.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:17.020
And neurodegenerative disease these are two brain sections from a normal person and from

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:22.540
someone with who has died from neurodegenerative disease and what you're seeing here is the

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:31.260
devastation brought by misfolded proteins in the brain. So it turns out that in terms of human beings

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.300
we are a bit between a rock and a hard place with regard to this problem in protein folding

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:44.620
because cancer cells and infectious organisms are using their survival response this heat shock

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:52.620
response to kill us because it strengthens them it allows them to survive the rigors of a living

01:11:52.620 --> 01:12:00.940
system and our brains conversely are not using the survival response when we would normally think

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:06.060
they should be because when we die of neurodegenerative diseases it's because proteins have

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:11.740
misfolded misfunction and just like those instruments that are not playing right with the orchestra

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:18.380
they're causing devastating disease. See how that whole now see how that whole thing fell apart

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:24.780
how the whole analogy fell apart now she went back to the protein folding in the in the horns and the

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:31.260
orchestra not playing so what she's saying that the brain doesn't have heat shock proteins and

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.660
otherwise those proteins wouldn't have misfolded that's again the same question I had before

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:44.380
what does this stuff in normal conditions don't they need proteins to fold correctly in normal

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.420
conditions isn't there still a chance that they will fold incorrectly in normal conditions you

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:57.180
showed us this chaotic you know internal cell I mean it seems really like there we have a foot

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:05.180
in and a foot out of this analogy and I find it very frustrating because I have the background

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:11.500
to follow along and I don't think she's painting a coherent picture of what the the biological question

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:18.380
is. This puts us in a difficult position but it's not a place where we can't move and we can't do

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:24.300
something important in biological experimentation and the reason why we can do do things that will

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:31.580
help to fix these problems is because it is such a universal problem and so we can take these very

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:38.140
simple organisms here these cells it's really understand more about how it's really like an

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:47.340
enchantment you can't see it any other way this is a carefully constructed set of slides that

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:53.500
ends with the same image that it began with which is a cheap trick but it's also a very

01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:00.620
effective one and a good one that a lot of good teachers will use because you you want to run a

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.540
full circle right you want to bring people back to where you were in the beginning especially

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:11.900
if the beginning is the take-home message what's the take-home message here that yeast is a great

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:20.140
cellular proxy model for us and so now in the next video that we watch we're going to listen to how

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:27.420
pre-owned disease is recapitulated in yeast protein inheritance and you're going to see very easily

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:33.260
how it is that these two things have been misconstrued our understanding of whatever goes on in a

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:39.740
dish with yeast has been misconstrued with whatever goes on in the forest of a cannibalist

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:48.460
place in New Guinea or or in a sheep field in the UK I really think that's a possible

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.860
a possible problem in our near future and I think that they would love it they would absolutely

01:14:54.860 --> 01:15:02.860
love it if the skilled tv watchers would really take pre-ons at cartoon face value they are

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:11.020
proteins that are unable to be you know destroyed by autoclave if you just get one protein in you

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:17.180
you are definitely dead once you once you have it it's over and this is just the way these things work

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.940
um I think we're we're gonna have a lot of fun over the next couple of weeks

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:25.660
simple organisms here these cells I think we're gonna have a lot of fun over the next couple of weeks

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.580
how that the biology of that system is driven how how to correct protein folding and how it goes

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:37.740
wrong in order to help these people over here with all of those different protein probing problems

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:43.180
I just mentioned to you so I'll be talking to you about that in the next lecture I'm so excited so

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.420
that we've really found our thing here I think we really did we found it I think this is our new

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:53.020
teacher um we're going to use her regularly because I do think that's the way we go forward

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:59.420
it's not that it's not that I'm always going to use videos but I really need you to feel it

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:06.780
I need you to feel how there has been a concerted effort to push this idea out I've also found it

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:16.140
feels like countless countless like mid-level podcasters with very good production values

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:25.100
relatively decent followings making very certain videos about pre-on disease and what happened

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:30.060
before and what's gonna happen in the future and making fun of how the worst-case scenario is

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:38.060
pretty ugly it is starting to become to me very obvious that something strange is going on

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:44.060
and so we have the opportunity to get ahead of the dominoes and before this becomes some kind

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:51.980
of weird narrative that they start to misconstrue what we're probably well expected developments

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:57.820
from the multiple transfections that they've rolled out they're going to be able to cover it up

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:03.340
and they're going to try to cover it up by misconstruing the spike as having a particular

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:09.660
effect the transfection itself of course doesn't and that's a lie I'm sure it's a lie and I'm sure

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:14.940
it's well I'm not sure but I got a lot of chips on the fact that that's probably coming and so if

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:20.380
that is the case then this is the way we get ahead of it we learn this biology better than they know

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:26.620
it and if we do that then we will be able to exercise informed consent because they won't be

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:33.580
able to bamboozle us I think this is a good place for me to stop I hope you don't mind if I

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:39.340
stop now I'm going to go to basketball at four and then I do have this stream with Jason Levine

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:46.060
tonight at seven o'clock I'll talk to Jason he uses Google Google whatever you call it so I

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:53.580
might be able to do it with sound only and then I could go live while he's recording it so I'll

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.980
just see what he thinks about it I'm not going to do it without his permission or something but

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:03.100
that would be at seven o'clock if that's going to happen and yeah I think this has been a pretty

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:11.660
good start again I'm what I'm trying to do is break you into the idea that that pre-owned biology

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:18.860
is for the most part based in yeast and so it we we really need to dig into what do we understand

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:24.780
from yeast and what we understand from pre-owned disease in the wild and see if these two things

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:31.500
can be brought together in a way that allows us to truly assess what the what you know the real

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:36.300
biology is that's what we do here um ladies and gentlemen stop all transfections and humans

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:43.340
because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary and this has been

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:49.100
giga-owned biological a high-resistance low-noise information for you brought to you by a biologist

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.820
where intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:59.420
immune system is dumb. Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and I'm going to

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:05.580
be a little less complicated than here and say RNA cannot pandemic that's the way it should be

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:13.100
um so yeah that was the show um thanks very much again for coming and uh I will see you

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:19.180
probably tonight um but you won't be able to see Jason you won't be able to see Chet um so I don't

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:25.020
I don't know it might be better than nothing um and then uh yeah it's giga-owned biological.com

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:30.460
if you want to share the stream um there's all kinds of ways to do it but that might be one um

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:38.220
also screen.gigome.vio is really the algorithm free search engine free you just find our stuff

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:43.500
there just the recent stuff there's a little bit from mark um and then the rest of the stuff is

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.780
just for me it's kind of a new archive that we're building um and so yeah thanks a lot for joining

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:53.900
me and I will see you tonight and definitely also tomorrow I swear we are eventually gonna

01:19:53.900 --> 01:20:02.460
get to 1313 eastern time every day um it's just uh yeah it's a priority thing and sometimes

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:09.020
I have one paying client right now and so when I get a phone call from her I do need to take it

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.260
and so that sometimes it's during containing it so I have to wait till two or whatever

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:19.580
anyway thank you very much thanks Jeff from Earth for all the clips on instagram um and uh yeah

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:25.900
see you guys soon
