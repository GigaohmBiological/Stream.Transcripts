00:03.247 --> 00:04.697
Mike Vandenberg, Mixtape.

01:13.624 --> 01:14.704
Good morning, everybody.

01:14.744 --> 01:15.525
Welcome to the show.

01:15.565 --> 01:20.507
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:20.607 --> 01:22.307
It's the 30th of April, 2025.

01:22.347 --> 01:36.633
I'm going to start with a brief introductory video from a couple days ago on the PBS NewsHour to try and start addressing the question of where are they taking America?

01:36.673 --> 01:39.534
And so in order to find out where they are taking America,

01:40.174 --> 01:46.038
We have to take a sample from a lot of different parts of the sewer in order to find out just how bad the water is.

01:46.178 --> 01:56.265
And so this is a regular sample from the PBS NewsHour, I think, right at the middle of the pipe that we are trying to understand.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.225
Good morning, everyone.

01:57.286 --> 01:59.147
Good to see you, Brother Spoon, Christy.

01:59.167 --> 02:02.309
I Am Katniss is the first in the chat.

02:02.829 --> 02:03.390
Well done.

02:03.990 --> 02:08.013
We're not going to use PCR as we watch the sewer, but they definitely are.

02:08.813 --> 02:09.594
Let's get started.

02:10.134 --> 02:10.954
Good to see you everybody.

02:10.974 --> 02:31.765
Good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Today health secretary Robert F Kennedy jr Pledged to find out what is driving the country's rise in autism spectrum disorder or ASD After a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that rate had continued to climb Yeah

02:32.797 --> 02:36.603
I'm gonna fix this really quick, please, if you don't mind.

02:36.663 --> 02:38.306
I'm just gonna get this all set up.

02:39.268 --> 02:40.289
That should do it.

02:40.590 --> 02:42.413
Oh no, this one's not focused yet.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.295
So see, I always gotta do something.

02:45.418 --> 02:50.982
When you don't have your own crew, then you need to just do it yourself.

02:51.843 --> 02:55.686
See, I'm focusing my own camera with my own long arm.

02:55.706 --> 02:57.908
I don't know how he does it.

02:57.948 --> 03:00.130
His production is so incredible.

03:01.110 --> 03:01.551
Here we go.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.172
Anyway, sorry about that.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.994
The ASD prevalence rate in eight-year-olds is now one in 31.

03:06.274 --> 03:06.615
Shocking.

03:09.619 --> 03:11.920
There is an extreme risk for boys.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.463
Overall, the risk for boys of getting an autism diagnosis in this country is now one in 20.

03:18.643 --> 03:26.506
AMNA NAWAZ The CDC said the increase was most likely driven by better screening and diagnosis, which Kennedy rejected.

03:27.146 --> 03:36.910
Separately, there are reports that the CDC plans to study a supposed connection between autism and vaccines, despite dozens of studies showing no connection between the two.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.131
Ali Rogin digs into the science.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.608
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:42.668 --> 03:48.472
has recently delivered contradictory messages on vaccines, in one interview recommending them.

03:48.932 --> 03:59.218
It's one thing to say the measles vaccine is the best way of preventing spread, but it's another thing to then say, and therefore, we suggest that you get the measles vaccine.

03:59.519 --> 04:01.660
We encourage people to get the measles vaccine.

04:02.080 --> 04:09.524
While in another, again raising questions about a link between vaccines and autism that has been thoroughly studied and debunked.

04:09.765 --> 04:12.066
The studies that they did were very, very narrow.

04:12.446 --> 04:19.410
More than 25 years ago, a supposed link between autism... Think about abbreviating somebody's comments so...

04:21.451 --> 04:23.792
and then think you were representing them somehow.

04:24.212 --> 04:32.115
She thinks she's doing a news report by reading a script where they use like two second soundbites from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

04:32.675 --> 04:35.316
That is in and of itself remarkable.

04:35.956 --> 04:41.338
I also think that their choice of the particular white woman here is also very remarkable.

04:41.398 --> 04:47.700
They either use decrepit old ladies or they use somebody who they clearly know is not

04:48.726 --> 04:51.467
I mean, come on, this is a joke to me.

04:52.047 --> 05:01.951
And PBS NewsHour is a particularly macabre joke on our grandchildren because it is actually supported, at least in part, by public funds.

05:02.011 --> 05:13.576
And then in addition to that, they get a whole bunch of money from weaponized piles of money that do not have the best interest of our grandchildren at heart at all, that have been aware

05:14.076 --> 05:21.418
of the population pyramid problem for decades and are part of the governance structure that is managing that problem.

05:23.558 --> 05:36.501
And so where are they taking America if they have allowed the Donald Trump administration to take in and represent with the Health and Human Services Secretary of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

05:36.641 --> 05:39.162
Is this all just a random

05:40.885 --> 05:48.150
Combination of events that none of these people foresaw coming or when are we on a very very bad script here?

05:49.271 --> 05:52.133
Where everybody that believes that there's some?

05:53.214 --> 06:06.504
patriotic idea behind Maga or this patriotic idea behind Maha is actually being fooled by people who know they're doing it by people who are willing to do it and

06:08.479 --> 06:09.460
And what are they doing?

06:09.640 --> 06:20.105
It feels to me like they are bringing America to a very particular place, a very particular set of circumstances from a social perspective.

06:20.145 --> 06:26.148
They are not trying to build a big top tent of health freedom like they say on one side.

06:26.588 --> 06:29.610
They are not trying to follow the science on the other side.

06:31.232 --> 06:43.805
It is this very macabre duality of liars that we have become enchanted by, and that if we don't vigilantly fight against it, our children will inherit.

06:45.587 --> 06:51.433
And they'll be in a much worse circumstances than we were when we inherited what we inherited from our parents.

06:53.553 --> 07:04.924
and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine was put forward by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, a gastroenterologist and surgeon who in 1998 authored this study in the Lancet Medical Journal.

07:05.825 --> 07:11.651
The study was based on just 12 cases of vaccinated children, but contained no control group,

07:12.031 --> 07:21.339
patients who hadn't been vaccinated for comparison, and it relied on parents' memories rather than- No unvaccinated controls.

07:21.439 --> 07:27.944
They actually said on PBS NewsHour there were no unvaccinated controls.

07:29.105 --> 07:32.929
Like that is remarkable.

07:34.710 --> 07:39.154
They relied on parents' memories, you know, like the memory of Paula Aitken.

07:40.000 --> 08:05.306
who when she remembered that her son did not develop rapid onset in one day, did not happen after any particular shot, and had a very particular traumatic early childhood, a particularly noticeable developmental trajectory, all of which was edited out in child number four.

08:07.594 --> 08:14.338
And yet, PBS NewsHour is absolutely happy to connect Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

08:14.378 --> 08:24.344
directly to Andrew Wakefield, who pulled the exact same stunt but with a different script in the UK years before with Pauly Tommy.

08:24.805 --> 08:30.608
The same script that's now, they're still sticking to now, where some people say it's the P in the DTP.

08:30.989 --> 08:33.130
Some people say it's the M in the MMR.

08:34.878 --> 08:39.163
Some people say it's the aluminum or the thimerosal, this particular kind of mercury.

08:39.303 --> 08:40.444
Paul Offit's a liar.

08:40.905 --> 08:45.309
These people are on a very limited script and they are not getting off of it.

08:45.410 --> 08:54.780
And the way that you can see that it is part of the big picture is that PBS NewsHour is unafraid to tell you their names.

09:02.056 --> 09:02.817
official records.

09:03.457 --> 09:18.812
It was quickly criticized for its flaws, and later revealed that Wakefield hadn't disclosed conflicts of interest, that he was being paid to work on a lawsuit against vaccine companies, and that he had falsified some medical records to support his conclusion.

09:19.568 --> 09:22.729
We were able to show that he'd manipulated it.

09:23.789 --> 09:36.632
But remember, and this is just gonna blow your fricking mind, remember that Paula Aitken told us that at some point in time, Paul Shattuck told her to go to Brian Deere.

09:37.472 --> 09:41.994
Brian Deere being the guy that we now think probably just controlled this.

09:42.054 --> 09:47.575
That's why they're also saying his name, selling his book.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.029
on the PBS News Hour.

09:51.089 --> 09:56.275
Now, I just got some interesting shit in the mail the other day that I really hope is down here.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.637
Oh, dang it, I forgot about the wire.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.541
Where is that?

10:01.781 --> 10:03.904
Oh, man, I think it's upstairs on the table.

10:06.218 --> 10:12.301
Hey, Phila, if you're watching the show right now, can you bring me the books that were underneath the iPad charging place?

10:13.622 --> 10:15.043
If you're listening, I don't know if you're listening.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.925
Otherwise I'm gonna have to call her and tell her to get those books down here.

10:19.965 --> 10:20.966
Let me just do that quick.

10:21.006 --> 10:22.286
Cause that's really interesting.

10:22.326 --> 10:23.567
And I want to tie that in now.

10:24.087 --> 10:26.389
And I didn't, ah, she's listening.

10:26.489 --> 10:27.429
Thank you very much.

10:28.410 --> 10:29.490
Yes, all of them are fine.

10:29.530 --> 10:29.830
Thank you.

10:29.870 --> 10:30.111
Thank you.

10:30.131 --> 10:31.211
Thank you very, very much.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.013
So in this pile, let me,

10:34.793 --> 10:35.834
Let me switch over here.

10:37.115 --> 10:42.358
In this pile of stuff, I get books in the mail a lot.

10:43.379 --> 10:44.960
Don't go to eBay, there's nothing there.

10:46.656 --> 10:49.197
Got another news week with autism on the cover.

10:49.257 --> 10:59.402
This is from 2000, July, 2000, same month, same month, same month as the human genome business that we read yesterday, right?

10:59.462 --> 11:04.404
So you can see that these narratives were being, you know, this is before the internet.

11:04.444 --> 11:06.465
This is before social media was really big.

11:06.905 --> 11:09.226
And so this is still how it was done back then.

11:09.246 --> 11:14.608
That's what I'm trying to do is really understand it and get the real, you know, my hands on this stuff.

11:14.628 --> 11:15.429
This is great, isn't it?

11:16.209 --> 11:34.841
I'm getting a my my my my mailman hates me he really does the other day he came with 11 items I mean you know there's there's textbooks in there so this molecular biology of a gene I needed this for one particular passage in it you know you can get some textbooks for like four bucks so this is cool

11:37.076 --> 11:42.759
So let me keep this on focus here.

11:42.779 --> 11:48.942
So Brian Deere is the journalist who apparently exposed Andrew Wakefield.

11:48.982 --> 11:52.924
And so here PBS NewsHour is saying that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:52.964 --> 12:02.930
is promoting ideas that were already debunked, that ideas that come from the charlatan Andrew Wakefield, and that Brian Deere has the goods on Andrew Wakefield.

12:03.749 --> 12:07.431
but it's a very limited spectrum of debate being curated by actors.

12:07.471 --> 12:10.412
And now, how would I know that Brian Deere is an actor?

12:10.452 --> 12:29.440
Number one, because I talked to the mom of child number four, Paula Aitken, and there is an interview that I did that's on my website and on Twitch and on YouTube, and is about to be promoted by Melissa Watt, the wife of Andrew, or sorry, Alan Watt,

12:30.721 --> 12:42.248
I'm actually gonna do a program with her in June and she's gonna do a program with me in June We are in touch There's a book on the table over there that she sent me in a long handwritten letter, and I'm super excited.

12:42.268 --> 12:54.597
We finally connected And she's also gonna share that video with Paula Aitken because I think it's a really Touching interview in the sense of she's a really

12:56.229 --> 13:02.252
She's just a, it's a genuine interview with a person who has been confused by these people for a long time.

13:02.332 --> 13:12.198
And she, because she's busy with her son and she's just an average woman and an average mom, she never, at some point she was even scared and she was involved with these UK people.

13:12.278 --> 13:22.864
So the UK person that she got in contact with in kind of parallel with talking to Andrew Wakefield was a guy by the name of Paul Shattuck who told her

13:23.524 --> 13:39.376
that he never didn't know who Wakefield was, but later she found out that he and Paul Shattuck actually had papers together, not that dissimilar to how Andrew Wakefield and Peter Daszak have had a paper together about measles, which is really strange that nobody talks about.

13:39.816 --> 13:42.498
Peter Daszak, you know, EcoHealth Alliance, Lab League guy.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.401
So, who Andrew Huff told

13:47.962 --> 13:59.453
Robert Malone on a podcast had had joined the CIA Anyway, Bob Deere this guy Is now on the PBS NewsHour like a few days ago.

13:59.493 --> 14:04.658
They're talking about him They're saying look at look at the two books that I've written about the doctor that fooled the world.

14:05.098 --> 14:09.823
And of course, there are two different Skyhorse books

14:12.273 --> 14:16.534
Skyhorse being, you know, on the back of the book it says Skyhorse Publishing, so you can see it.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.976
That's the publishing arm, the publishing mirror of CHD.

14:22.816 --> 14:27.117
They have two books by Andrew Wakefield, one in 2010 and one in 2012.

14:27.657 --> 14:34.359
And so he's got two books, you know, Two Doctor, The Doctor, The Fool, The World.

14:34.779 --> 14:37.380
But they're not not selling Andrew Wakefield's book.

14:37.420 --> 14:41.621
Maybe somebody that was thinking objectively would all check them all out of the library, ha, ha, ha.

14:42.188 --> 14:55.440
So the reason why I'm saying this is because, again, remember, Paula felt like the mother of child number four in that Lancet study that they are talking about now in the PBS NewsHour in 2025, that

14:58.132 --> 15:08.436
mom thought that this was one network of people, that Brian Deer, Andrew Wakefield, and Paul Shattuck all knew each other and all were kind of, you know, shepherding the cats.

15:08.976 --> 15:21.020
Now, I have in my hand the best of Autism Asperger's Digest magazine because it was cheap on there and I wanted to see who was writing articles in this magazine.

15:23.536 --> 15:47.224
this thing I just another one of these I want to find out which of these magazines is real and who put them all together you know because Mark Kulak got really lucky with the autism file that this is a magazine that Pauly Tommy put out in the UK there's all kinds of of weird people in there including Judy Mikovits and also it's it was a gold mine so if you haven't seen those check that out on his website so here

15:48.384 --> 15:57.271
There's not really anything interesting in the list of authors that write in the best of, you know, they selected articles from over four years of issues.

15:57.691 --> 16:02.034
And there's not really any names that popped out.

16:02.174 --> 16:09.580
But I did read the About the Asperger's Digest, Autism Asperger's Digest and this book.

16:10.881 --> 16:16.865
And I got through, so the second paragraph down here, maybe I can switch to that.

16:24.399 --> 16:30.262
If I get to the second paragraph, third paragraph of this intro, so it's about autism book, right?

16:30.322 --> 16:35.664
So you read about the way it came about, and I don't know, maybe somebody else needs to read that.

16:36.144 --> 16:45.308
I just want to read this, because as the Digest gained a foothold in the autism community, it quickly attracted the stars in the field as contributing or regular authors.

16:45.928 --> 16:57.676
Tony Atwood, I don't know, Katherine Faherty, I don't know, Gary Misab, I don't know, Carol Gray, Peter Gerhart, Bernard Rimland, Simon Baron Cohen.

16:58.756 --> 17:03.800
Isn't that, uh, isn't Simon Baron Cohen the the dude that's all goofy with, uh,

17:05.362 --> 17:06.563
I can't remember, but he does a lot.

17:06.584 --> 17:07.685
That's Borat, isn't it?

17:08.526 --> 17:10.227
Luke Sy, I don't know who that is.

17:10.368 --> 17:16.094
Andy Bondy, Barry Prezent, Lori Ehrensberger, and Paul Shattuck.

17:18.035 --> 17:27.878
Now, if you remember, Paul Shattuck was, of course, the guy that came over to Paula Atkins' house and asked her for the details.

17:28.078 --> 17:41.481
After he'd already gotten all the details on the phone, he asked her for the details of the diet that cured her son Colin's gastrointestinal problems.

17:42.714 --> 18:03.256
And then after getting those details over the phone, he still came over to her house and wanted all the details, you know, wanted to know all the ways that it, and then, and then at a different way through a different organization, through a different set of people, she got in contact with Andrew Wakefield, but then only found out later that Paul Shattuck and Andrew Wakefield did know each other, but they

18:03.922 --> 18:13.916
Paul pretended not to know Andrew Wakefield, so that guy was mentioned in the best of Autism Asperger's magazine, so he was.

18:15.501 --> 18:16.281
in the community.

18:16.341 --> 18:18.843
He was working, but in a different part of it.

18:18.923 --> 18:25.726
And you can see how it's compartmentalized because somewhere else, there's no article by Pauly Tommy in here as a guest writer.

18:26.186 --> 18:34.650
There's no mention of anybody that's writing in the autism file, you know, like Judy Mikovits or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.611
or anything like that.

18:35.651 --> 18:38.372
This is a whole different group of heroes.

18:39.488 --> 18:50.958
that sees Asperger's and autism as a unified front, whereas the Autism File apparently has a whole other set of heroes that has a whole other take on autism.

18:52.319 --> 18:56.843
And when you hear that Paula Aitken tried to reach out to Pauly Tommy and got no real response,

18:58.051 --> 19:19.408
at that time, then you can see a sort of very interesting picture in my mind of players that without the help of Paula Aitken, I would never understand them as potentially all being part of the same group of people that Pauly Tommy and Wakefield, I only saw Pauly Tommy and Wakefield together as this little unit.

19:19.448 --> 19:22.311
But if you also see their opposition

19:24.204 --> 19:51.540
and their opposition is still making a living as an expert on on wakefield that's pretty extraordinary uh... the study and uh... fabricated the appearance of a link with autism for personal gain and personal glory and uh... the results of that was that uh... he was banned from medicine and the research paper he published was retracted by the lots it

19:52.202 --> 19:57.884
Yet the alarm he created was real, leading to falling MMR rates and rising measles cases.

19:58.524 --> 20:10.929
Researchers around the globe set out to test Wakefield's findings, with studies that track large populations over time, that compare affected groups against those without a condition, and that analyze other research.

20:11.519 --> 20:20.521
We sought to test the hypothesis that had been raised by the findings of the Wakefield study.

20:20.841 --> 20:23.462
This was a systematic review of the existing evidence.

20:23.842 --> 20:26.483
Dozens of studies came to the same conclusion.

20:27.043 --> 20:32.944
There was no evidence of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism.

20:33.124 --> 20:36.725
There was no association whatsoever in our study.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.823
So that's what the science tells us.

20:39.244 --> 20:46.950
But many who continue to question vaccine safety, like Kennedy, ask, what then is behind the dramatic rise in autism rates?

20:47.671 --> 20:54.697
Autism rates have gone from 1 in 10,000, or 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 10,000, depending on what study you look at.

20:54.817 --> 21:00.381
In my generation, as a 70-year-old man today, in our children, it's 1 in 34.

21:00.902 --> 21:03.024
You can't even believe these numbers.

21:04.082 --> 21:07.284
One in 10,000 children had autism.

21:07.404 --> 21:07.624
One in 10,000.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.686
And now it's one in 36.

21:10.986 --> 21:13.587
There's something wrong.

21:13.727 --> 21:13.927
One in 36.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.248
Think of that.

21:15.668 --> 21:23.773
There was one landmark 1989 study of individuals in Utah which found the rate was four in 10,000, not one in 10,000, as Trump and Kennedy said.

21:26.874 --> 21:35.720
Official estimates began in 2000 and show the rate in children jumped from 1 in 150 that year to 1 in 31 in 2022.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.461
Still a huge increase.

21:38.081 --> 21:40.703
And researchers say there are a lot of reasons for that.

21:41.183 --> 21:43.325
Some we understand, but many we don't.

21:43.745 --> 21:49.329
The first is changes in how we diagnose people or who we're including as having autism.

21:50.109 --> 21:59.754
The second is changes in recommendations from the American Association for Pediatrics to what pediatricians should be looking for in signs during wellness visits.

22:00.174 --> 22:07.098
The third reason is due to increased awareness and acceptance of autism in our communities.

22:07.718 --> 22:15.963
And then the fourth is changes in some trends over time for factors that we know are associated with increased likelihood of autism.

22:16.383 --> 22:30.655
Well, you know what I just thought of, and I wonder if Mark Kulak is listening, but you know, Zika virus, the whole idea of Zika virus is weird.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.317
And the whole idea of microencephaly is weird.

22:33.357 --> 22:39.843
And I wonder if the people who are getting microencephaly were also vaccinated during pregnancy.

22:41.721 --> 22:44.222
because that would be the easiest explanation.

22:44.282 --> 22:55.487
Because I remember there being something about wanting to vaccinate mothers before they, or while they were pregnant, and Zika was something like that.

22:55.627 --> 22:59.449
And so maybe they even tested it on, I don't know.

23:00.050 --> 23:01.870
Is that what we're dealing with here?

23:02.391 --> 23:02.731
Because

23:03.857 --> 23:07.439
That picture just a minute ago was a kid with microencephaly.

23:07.479 --> 23:09.039
He had like a goofy looking head.

23:09.499 --> 23:11.660
And fathers being old.

23:11.760 --> 23:18.323
Third reason is due to increased awareness and acceptance of autism in our communities.

23:18.943 --> 23:22.465
And then the fourth is changes in some trends over time.

23:22.905 --> 23:27.227
for factors that we know are associated with increased likelihood of autism.

23:27.447 --> 23:34.710
Things like preterm birth and fathers being older in age when they're having children.

23:35.310 --> 23:38.572
But those alone don't explain all of the increase.

23:39.032 --> 23:47.035
Some of the things my lab studies... I mean, this is one of the worst reports ever, how they're clipping clip to clip and they clip from her to this clip.

23:47.115 --> 23:48.056
It's gross.

23:49.850 --> 24:03.576
focused on have been genes and how genes contribute to autism and how other environments or environmental factors also contribute to autism and brain development.

24:03.796 --> 24:04.976
It is impossible.

24:05.877 --> 24:13.440
It is impossible that the guy that CHD put on stage every time they've ever organized anything

24:14.571 --> 24:19.574
has a book in 2016 called The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

24:21.396 --> 24:23.697
And they are a real anti-vax movement.

24:23.817 --> 24:42.690
It is impossible because Paul Offit also believes that it is a complex bouquet of genetic and environmental causes that explains autism, even though we're diagnosing it differently and where it depends on how wide of a net you cast, it's all the same bullshit argument.

24:44.195 --> 24:48.378
And the reason why is because intramuscular injection is just plain dumb.

24:48.418 --> 24:53.181
And the only way they've been able to get away with it, I'm sure, is because a lot of it is placebo.

25:00.306 --> 25:01.527
It was a long con.

25:03.228 --> 25:12.015
If intramuscular injection is dumb, as I am suggesting and have been suggesting and unchallenged on for almost two years now,

25:13.180 --> 25:15.541
really a strong year and a half.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.023
I have been saying RNA cannot pandemic.

25:19.083 --> 25:39.194
I've been saying transfection in healthy people was always a crime and intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, but slowly realized that just intramuscular injection in general is dumb, is a statement worth saying to get somebody to provoke a correction and it hasn't happened yet.

25:40.782 --> 25:50.214
And instead, I have prominent people calling me JJ, without links, and criticizing my high production level.

25:52.336 --> 25:56.161
In case you're not aware, I use PowerPoint, and it's really, really simple.

25:56.781 --> 25:57.863
You know the magic trick?

25:58.423 --> 26:00.146
It's use the transition morph.

26:01.112 --> 26:03.694
then it changes one slide to another slide.

26:04.154 --> 26:15.563
So if you copy A, and then you copy that slide over, and then you change some stuff, and you put the transition to morph, those changes will occur in animated form, and it'll look super cool.

26:16.303 --> 26:25.751
And so more words will move around, or letters will move around, and it looks like you put a lot of work into your... It's all about the red thread of thought that goes through it.

26:26.636 --> 26:32.154
And the fact of the matter is, at this point, after five years of watching my show develop...

26:33.541 --> 26:36.642
because I've been using PowerPoint for five years to do this.

26:37.363 --> 26:42.685
I've been using a green screen in my bedroom and then in my garage to do this.

26:43.205 --> 26:52.049
None of these people have the guts to think about the very simple summary statements that I've started my stream with and ended with for many years now.

26:52.789 --> 26:54.049
None of them have the guts.

26:54.329 --> 27:00.352
And that whole point is the reason why you can see that they are full of it.

27:01.957 --> 27:06.839
Because at some point in time, you've got to say, well, you know, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:06.919 --> 27:11.001
is a drug addict, but he says some things right.

27:12.421 --> 27:13.262
Except he doesn't.

27:13.742 --> 27:15.282
He says he's pro-vaccine.

27:15.302 --> 27:16.663
He wants safe vaccines.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.504
And Steve Kersh says that he's going to give us safe vaccines.

27:23.386 --> 27:28.688
I say, and some other people have said, that autism is a mythology.

27:29.912 --> 27:40.499
that vaccination is a mythology, that arguing about mandates is slave speak, because intramuscular injection is just dumb.

27:42.300 --> 27:57.371
And this elaborate theater where the PBS NewsHour has dissolved into the title of James Lyon Weiner's book,

27:58.976 --> 28:01.997
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but this is the breaking moment.

28:03.958 --> 28:08.940
This is where the left and the right realize that we have been pitted against each other.

28:10.541 --> 28:20.845
This is the point where the left and the right realize that they need to have sympathy for one another because the trap was as magnificent as it was malevolent.

28:22.626 --> 28:27.848
And now it's actually curious to see that it is the left who can't sustain.

28:28.874 --> 28:37.737
It is the left who is having to sort of adopt some of the talking points of the fake conservative right.

28:39.897 --> 28:44.839
And the reason why is because the script is, that's where we're going.

28:46.139 --> 28:52.221
We're going to this place where there are complex answers to these complex problems.

28:52.281 --> 28:58.583
And the only people who are gonna provide those answers are technocrats on television and liars on social media.

29:01.158 --> 29:03.280
And that is their strategy for governing us.

29:03.320 --> 29:12.028
That is their strategy for getting to our grandchildren and getting our grandchildren into a digital prison where they are essentially experimental animals.

29:13.650 --> 29:22.278
And in the meantime, they're going to harvest as much of the DNA as they can through remnant streams and through other theaters on television, like maybe the bird flu to come.

29:24.482 --> 29:30.944
But autism is a mythology and it is a mythology that has been around for decades.

29:31.024 --> 29:35.846
I'm talking since the time when they announced the Human Genome Project was done.

29:36.586 --> 29:41.508
They have been teaching us what autism is and telling us that it could be boys more than girls.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.731
Which of course indicates a genetic vulnerability.

29:50.461 --> 30:08.333
And don't worry, the transgender argument gets you to argue the same thing, because if you're arguing that sex is chromosomally dependent and defined, then you're kind of already on a slippery slope if you don't understand a new biology, but you just understand the old biology, then you're about to say that genes matter the most.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.217
And for certain things, that's true.

30:16.650 --> 30:23.472
But you must understand the illusion, the trap that they're getting you in when you get fighting about transgenderism.

30:23.612 --> 30:27.413
It's much more diabolical than just a communist thing.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.434
You know, they're trying to sell us this, it's just communist attack.

30:31.815 --> 30:35.056
And they're using fifth generation warfare to ruin our culture.

30:35.236 --> 30:37.236
No, it's even worse than that.

30:37.356 --> 30:39.757
They're actually trying to enslave your grandkids.

30:40.317 --> 30:42.058
And they want you to argue about this.

30:42.118 --> 30:48.099
They want you to get really mad about the fact that sex is determined by genes.

30:50.520 --> 30:55.662
Because then you'll be on their slippery slope and they can kick you right down to where you accept the fact that you know what?

30:56.562 --> 30:56.942
Genes.

30:57.402 --> 30:57.962
It's genes.

30:58.463 --> 30:59.943
We need to have all that data.

31:00.683 --> 31:02.604
Boy, I hope we have somewhere to store it soon.

31:05.925 --> 31:11.768
environmental factors like the air we breathe, what we eat and drink, infections, and many more.

31:12.068 --> 31:13.909
There are so many factors in the environment.

31:13.929 --> 31:15.110
The question is where to look.

31:15.550 --> 31:19.192
And when you look for one, you find that interacts with another one, right?

31:19.452 --> 31:27.337
So for example, what if children experiencing a lot of stress in their households is a factor that contributes to autism?

31:27.817 --> 31:31.399
Well, maybe those very families are the ones using more screens.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.680
So is it the stress or is it screen time?

31:33.965 --> 31:37.187
Researchers are now- Is it stress or is it screen time?

31:37.267 --> 31:38.087
Gee, I wonder.

31:38.167 --> 31:47.812
So, you know, some families hit their kids in the head with a baseball bat seven or eight times before they're one year old, and other families don't do that.

31:56.206 --> 32:03.471
Now working to determine what these many factors could be and how they might interact with many genes to cause autism.

32:04.051 --> 32:13.437
Some are also studying how to detect autism even earlier in life, using brainwave analysis on infants, well before behavioral signs show up.

32:13.837 --> 32:23.930
The reason this has worked is so important is that it may... The reason why this work is so important it is that it perpetuates a myth that this is a developmental disorder.

32:23.970 --> 32:31.560
You know, the trajectory across time that they have no idea how it works.

32:33.988 --> 32:36.489
They have this little idea that, oh, we have the recipe list.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.949
Here's all the 100,000 proteins.

32:39.389 --> 32:41.230
So I guess we understand everything now.

32:42.130 --> 32:48.731
And the illusion is that there is a developmental sign to find.

32:51.152 --> 32:55.253
Why don't they do this brain scan right before and right after an intramuscular injection?

32:56.564 --> 32:58.404
I mean, if they really wanted to know, right?

32:59.004 --> 33:03.885
Why don't they do the brain scan on the kids and watch the brain change?

33:03.945 --> 33:06.846
They don't even have a hypothesis which addresses the issue.

33:07.866 --> 33:13.807
Their hypothesis is that it is a developmental thing that can be seen early in childhood.

33:14.827 --> 33:19.688
How would they differentiate between a kid with a gift and a kid with a gift?

33:20.968 --> 33:24.629
How would they differentiate between, I mean, this is just absurd.

33:27.526 --> 33:29.667
It's absurd in a number of different levels too.

33:29.727 --> 33:32.008
It's absurd from a neuroscience perspective.

33:32.068 --> 33:34.930
It's absurd from a biological and developmental perspective.

33:34.970 --> 33:43.914
And it's absurd from the mythology of autism that it perpetuates it with, with a high degree of effectiveness.

33:43.974 --> 33:50.777
It perpetuates the idea that there's autism, just this picture of all those electrodes on this, this little kid's head.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.739
It's so malevolent.

33:58.015 --> 34:05.321
They give us a way to predict in the first half year of life, which babies will go on to develop autism.

34:05.721 --> 34:12.867
And if we can do that, then we, A, can scale this up throughout the United States in pediatric clinics, for example.

34:13.327 --> 34:19.072
And B, we can start to develop interventions that can be used in babies as young as three to six months of age.

34:19.492 --> 34:26.618
Researchers say this should be the focus going forward, not another study looking for a connection between vaccines and autism.

34:27.490 --> 34:30.453
At the population level, it's been answered.

34:31.133 --> 34:32.754
There have been innumerable studies.

34:32.794 --> 34:34.776
In fact, to such a point that they have actually stopped.

34:34.796 --> 34:42.321
The population level data is, if it's real, only possible because they put out so many placebo.

34:44.703 --> 34:47.445
And I'm going to probably go to my grave believing that.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.066
There's no other way to explain it.

34:51.829 --> 34:53.570
There's simply no other way to explain it.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.031
They don't get lucky that often.

34:59.742 --> 35:06.650
And that would require an extraordinary, it's just ridiculous.

35:06.790 --> 35:10.113
It's absolutely ridiculous.

35:11.415 --> 35:14.478
And again, we are watching a news program.

35:16.921 --> 35:20.324
We are watching a, I got to get out of there.

35:20.405 --> 35:21.606
That didn't work very well, did it?

35:24.980 --> 35:30.042
We were watching a news program, right, where they were using a bunch of people with foreign accents again.

35:30.102 --> 35:35.563
Why do we have to talk to people with foreign accents when we have a country of 350 million people?

35:37.484 --> 35:46.967
Why do I have to hear... Why do I have to hear from experts that can't barely speak English from Columbia University?

35:47.067 --> 35:53.329
How, in fact, can somebody be the head of something at Columbia University and barely able to speak English?

35:55.808 --> 35:57.029
unless it's by design.

35:57.970 --> 36:02.375
Unless so much sand is being shoveled into our eyes that we have no hope of seeing.

36:03.196 --> 36:11.085
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you find your intellectual eyewash station right here at GigaOM Biological.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.166
Thanks very much for being here.

36:12.186 --> 36:13.107
I'll be back in a second.

36:19.915 --> 36:20.176
you you

36:37.642 --> 36:37.722
do

37:03.550 --> 37:05.111
Once again, good morning, everybody.

37:05.191 --> 37:09.134
Thank you very much for using a little bit of your time to listen to me today.

37:09.935 --> 37:14.758
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

37:14.798 --> 37:18.781
The voice you hear is that biologist, Jonathan J. Cooey.

37:18.921 --> 37:20.882
I come to you out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

37:21.423 --> 37:29.708
You can find the stain of my academic work on the National Library PubMed website with my last name and my first initials.

37:30.669 --> 37:46.556
You can also find a lot of my work on the Woodhouse 76 substack where Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler oftentimes water down some of my work and then title it a little different and use it to argue with people like Claire Craig or Pierre Corey who are both in on this from the very beginning.

37:47.376 --> 37:49.457
So if you want to check out some of that work, go right ahead.

37:49.497 --> 37:54.859
Just remember that they're not going to cite me or, you know, it'll just be my slides of different colors and that kind of thing.

37:56.100 --> 38:03.626
I also helped Children Health Defense as a staff scientist under Brian Hooker for a long time in 2023, and also helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:03.646 --> 38:06.248
write the Wuhan cover-up book, and I'm even listed as an expert in it.

38:15.175 --> 38:16.696
Yes, biology is the way.

38:17.336 --> 38:22.200
I really like Bob and I really like Bob's work and I think Bob is really on the same page as me.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.462
Some of these people have pretended to apologize.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.903
They're not really apologizing.

38:26.423 --> 38:31.227
You gotta look at what they say because this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

38:31.247 --> 38:34.649
There is definitely a fake anti-vax movement in America.

38:35.730 --> 38:43.977
It may be somewhat funded by, supported by, coordinated by a guy by the name of Steve Bannon.

38:43.997 --> 38:49.282
It could also be related to, I'm sure it's related to a guy by the name of Robert Malone.

38:50.303 --> 38:59.951
Robert Wallace Malone, if you want his whole name, his wife Jill Glasspool Malone, and also a guy by the name of Kevin McKernan, formerly of the Human Genome Project.

38:59.991 --> 39:10.539
I think doing some research into these people, their background, their conflicts of interest, and how they have probably managed to curate a fake anti-vax movement that

39:11.019 --> 39:14.001
can talk about biology, but not really tell any truths.

39:14.942 --> 39:16.042
I think that's where we are.

39:16.183 --> 39:17.363
I think you got to seek the truth.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.064
If you want to find it, you got to seek it, though.

39:19.225 --> 39:20.225
Oh, what's that now?

39:20.285 --> 39:20.605
That one.

39:22.006 --> 39:37.377
And when you want to seek the truth, the first thing you need to really understand is that the pandemic itself, the whole illusion of public health, the whole illusion of AIDS, the whole illusion of chronic fatigue syndrome is being actively maintained by actors.

39:38.297 --> 39:41.778
And those actors are experts on TV that don't know any better.

39:42.218 --> 39:57.123
But there are also actors behind the scenes of these organizations and these bureaucracies and these meetings that actually do know the truth and do know that the idea that evolution because DNA is a horrible hoax.

39:58.188 --> 40:20.721
They've known, they know probably about the fact that, you know, as far back as Hilary Koprowski and Joshua Lederberg and Julian Huxley and Herman Muller, people were talking in very similar terms in the 50s in these private meetings of very smart people that they're talking now just with a little more certainty.

40:21.181 --> 40:24.443
And the certainty I feel really comes from the illusion

40:24.983 --> 40:31.730
that the Human Genome Project has created, that something was done, something is done, and now we know things.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.955
And that illusion is this, you know, evolution because DNA.

40:36.995 --> 40:38.857
Now we found it, we know all the genes.

40:39.578 --> 40:45.824
It's just a matter of time before we take over and start managing the evolution of the species.

40:45.885 --> 40:47.086
That's how these people think.

40:48.206 --> 40:55.358
And it might be that they're using cat enthusiasts and using horse enthusiasts.

40:55.458 --> 40:55.919
I don't know.

40:56.940 --> 40:58.463
But a few of these people are

41:00.157 --> 41:04.978
from a mentor perspective, they've worked with too many of the people that have to know.

41:05.638 --> 41:07.578
Francis Collins definitely knows.

41:07.658 --> 41:09.279
Mark Lander definitely knows.

41:09.959 --> 41:13.120
Murray Gardner and Bob Gallo definitely know.

41:14.740 --> 41:25.522
And being so associated with Judy Mikovits for so long, these are all one set of deep state, whatever you want to call it, actors.

41:27.830 --> 41:34.554
And we have to be very, very careful about not being tricked into being too precise with our explanation.

41:35.675 --> 41:38.857
Too precise would be something like saying it's the DOD.

41:39.558 --> 41:43.040
Too precise would be saying something like it's Hunter Biden and metabiota.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.402
Too precise would be saying something like it's a lab leak.

41:47.443 --> 41:56.029
Because all of these very precise explanations will, by design, fall short

41:57.106 --> 42:00.910
of describing the depth of the illusion.

42:01.910 --> 42:09.797
Because the depth of the illusion includes telling us stories about viruses without telling us any stories about phages.

42:11.039 --> 42:17.865
Even though the biological presence of phages and bacteria is orders of magnitude

42:18.815 --> 42:39.943
more important to our daily existence in orders of magnitude, more relevant as a background signal than anything that they can describe has a norovirus, a flu virus, a coronavirus, or any of these other viruses that they say are our pathogens, that are out to get us, that are ever evolving to get us.

42:40.504 --> 42:46.366
This whole illusion of virology requires that you don't understand two things.

42:47.298 --> 42:49.660
Phages and bacteria, that's one thing.

42:50.480 --> 42:54.423
And because that's one thing, it's one phenomenon, it's one entity.

42:54.443 --> 43:02.968
You can't call phages something separate from bacteria any more than you can call exosomes something separate from our body.

43:06.621 --> 43:24.912
And so we need to reorient our understanding so that we can help reorient our children's understanding so that as this bad biology continues to be spread over too much bread, they will notice and they will be able to see that they're running out.

43:25.993 --> 43:35.399
There's no more mayonnaise on the knife anymore and they're still getting more bread out of the bag and still spreading as though they're making sandwiches and they're not.

43:36.471 --> 43:46.880
And that really, I think, became evident reading this article from 2000 about what they were gonna do or not do and how many times did they do it, how many replicates were there.

43:46.960 --> 43:59.470
Man, oh man, they have made no progress in 25 years other than making some things cheaper and probably creating a lot more intellectual property.

44:03.427 --> 44:07.849
And so I believe that we can get rid of this fake vaccine movement if we don't even focus on it.

44:07.929 --> 44:13.471
Instead, try to understand how a background could be misconstrued as a pandemic.

44:13.591 --> 44:19.673
A background that we should just understand as an irreducibly complex genetic background.

44:20.433 --> 44:33.736
that's almost exclusively produced by the bacteria that we are in symbiotic relationship with, that the plants are in symbiotic relationship with, that make up the soil, that are present in all of our water supplies.

44:33.976 --> 44:39.538
Ladies and gentlemen, with a non-specific PCR test,

44:41.741 --> 44:50.490
they could take that bacteriophage and bacteria background and misconstrue it as the spread of a novel virus with just a few well-placed liars.

44:51.792 --> 45:03.765
And since this is about national security, since all of these countries have the same population pyramid problem to use to their advantage, never let a crisis go to waste,

45:05.014 --> 45:16.800
then it makes perfect sense why none of these people that are acting for these governing weaponized piles of money, I don't need to tell you who they're working for, I don't even know, how would I know?

45:16.900 --> 45:18.841
I'm just a guy in the back of my garage.

45:19.261 --> 45:23.964
But RNA cannot pandemic and they don't have the biology to address that.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.998
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

45:27.458 --> 45:36.726
There should be a doctor by now who's written me a letter that says, you know, dude, there are a couple exceptions to that, just so you know, but there isn't.

45:38.587 --> 45:40.449
Transfecting healthy people is a crime.

45:40.489 --> 45:46.654
The reason why they can't address this is because people like Brian Hooker know that that's what they should have called it from the beginning.

45:46.734 --> 45:53.420
People like Kevin McKernan has admitted on X that that's what they should have called it from the very beginning, but he did not.

45:55.014 --> 46:07.141
And in fact, he was on podcast after podcast after podcast for five years, specifically not calling it transfection and transformation, but calling them vaccines, just like his employers wanted him to.

46:09.322 --> 46:18.908
One of the things I wanted to point out about yesterday that I didn't notice in this magazine of the Human Genome Project is they actually said something here that I think is really important.

46:20.369 --> 46:21.469
They said that the,

46:24.150 --> 46:26.272
that the, where is it?

46:29.996 --> 46:30.376
Where is it?

46:31.437 --> 46:32.278
Wait, I just saw it.

46:32.718 --> 46:33.799
Okay, maybe it's in the other one.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.481
Hold on a second, let me find it.

46:35.501 --> 46:36.382
Yeah, the major players.

46:36.963 --> 46:37.863
That was a different page.

46:38.264 --> 46:44.890
So this major player, Lyon Bioscience, this one, that one, the other, Oxford Medical Group, Informax,

46:46.031 --> 46:47.032
I didn't read this one.

46:47.132 --> 46:48.652
See, so I wanted to show this one.

46:48.672 --> 46:50.273
This one's in Heidelberg, Germany.

46:51.414 --> 46:54.375
Bayer, and I, you know, okay, this is interesting, right?

46:55.415 --> 47:00.397
And then, Netgex, this is in, and this has Abbott.

47:01.118 --> 47:02.758
So I didn't, I didn't read this yesterday.

47:02.798 --> 47:03.619
I want you to see this.

47:03.699 --> 47:04.499
Double Twist.

47:07.661 --> 47:08.701
John Couch.

47:09.722 --> 47:11.162
Proprietary Tools.

47:13.043 --> 47:15.024
And so then, Compugen.

47:17.785 --> 47:20.366
Bayer, Human Genome Sciences.

47:24.028 --> 47:25.889
Wait, so I'm missing a page here.

47:25.909 --> 47:27.991
Hold on, let me find the page that I wanted to find.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.071
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

47:34.754 --> 47:36.515
No, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:36.555 --> 47:37.856
I just read it, dang it.

47:38.916 --> 47:39.677
Oh, yeah, right here, yeah.

47:40.509 --> 47:41.970
There's another page that looks the same.

47:42.030 --> 47:43.650
See, now here, this is the one we showed.

47:43.710 --> 47:48.892
Celera, Human Genome Sciences, Inside Genomics, Millennium Pharmaceuticals.

47:48.912 --> 47:50.312
The Human Genome Project.

47:50.372 --> 47:54.474
Look carefully at the joint collaborators, the Department of Energy.

47:57.515 --> 47:59.175
That's the highest level of security.

47:59.275 --> 47:59.635
Why?

47:59.695 --> 48:01.196
Because that's nukes, right Mark?

48:02.628 --> 48:05.130
So it is really the Department of Energy.

48:05.170 --> 48:08.574
The Department of Energy is the lead executives, Ari Petrino.

48:08.654 --> 48:11.536
So the Department of Energy is important there, I think.

48:11.596 --> 48:16.161
It's important to point that out because that is the highest level of government security.

48:16.181 --> 48:17.482
That's where the nukes are.

48:17.522 --> 48:19.103
That's where DITRA is, I think.

48:20.124 --> 48:21.665
And you can follow Mark Kulak.

48:21.705 --> 48:36.055
He's done a lot of shows about Ditra and Luger and all this other stuff and how it's all kind of connected to the vaccination of the military and bioterrorism and all this other stuff in addition to nukes.

48:39.659 --> 48:41.820
Yeah, it's not really good.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.700
We still have to think our way out.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.801
And I'm looking forward to starting a couple new series about this.

48:48.861 --> 48:51.342
But I'm trying to see myself as a biology coach.

48:51.802 --> 48:53.002
I want to give you stuff to read.

48:53.042 --> 49:00.804
I want to show you what I'm doing to try and double check my work, hoping that at some point in time I'm going to be wrong.

49:00.844 --> 49:03.765
And then I can just focus on basketball or something else.

49:04.465 --> 49:08.626
But apparently, it really is not going to be refuted.

49:09.842 --> 49:13.964
by any of these people that there was an anticipated rise in expected deaths.

49:14.124 --> 49:19.106
Even 60 Minutes is reporting now that our population pyramids are a little goofy.

49:19.186 --> 49:30.892
I actually uploaded to my website under the heading Stuff, and you don't have to scroll down very far, a McKinsey report about the fact that the population pyramids of the West are about to collapse.

49:32.779 --> 49:41.004
And now what comes along with that is a brief rise in expected deaths from the excess number of old people from when families were more productive.

49:41.584 --> 49:42.805
And so it was an opportunity.

49:43.385 --> 49:45.566
That's why Tony Fauci was able to predict it.

49:47.007 --> 49:49.889
That's why people like Ted Turner have been predicting it.

49:51.430 --> 49:56.092
Potentially social security gonna go bankrupt, the NHS gonna go bankrupt.

49:58.013 --> 49:59.254
So how are they covering it up?

50:00.882 --> 50:03.044
Well, they cover it up with stuff like this.

50:04.905 --> 50:06.086
This is like two days ago.

50:06.166 --> 50:07.127
Thank you very much.

50:07.488 --> 50:08.669
It's an honor to be here.

50:10.050 --> 50:19.358
So I can honestly say I am the only Nobel laureate who has ever thanked a photocopy machine in their Nobel speech.

50:20.238 --> 50:24.082
You young folks can ask the older folks what a photocopy machine is.

50:26.093 --> 50:29.374
Just very briefly, I want to address Vilma in the chat.

50:29.595 --> 50:39.158
As I understand it, my friend who works in government explained to me that DITRA is connected to a lot of organizations.

50:39.218 --> 50:41.619
It's only about 80 people, really.

50:44.654 --> 50:48.155
I don't really understand what Ditra is, so I don't want to argue about it.

50:48.775 --> 50:52.757
But the DoD is connected to a lot of things.

50:52.837 --> 50:57.158
I mean, my dad was in the Navy, so that doesn't make me automatically bad.

50:58.379 --> 51:02.140
The DoD being connected to things doesn't make the DoD the heart of it.

51:02.240 --> 51:09.282
I still believe that the DoD should be thought of more like a weapon.

51:09.983 --> 51:11.123
And you know, you don't blame

51:11.621 --> 51:14.182
the weapon, you blame the people that are wielding the weapon.

51:14.442 --> 51:18.943
And the wielding of the weapon is oftentimes done by the executive branch.

51:19.683 --> 51:27.726
So the way that the laws have been put in place have put more and more power to direct or to trigger

51:28.644 --> 51:36.026
the DOD in the hands of the executive branch, which a lot of people would argue that's the way it's supposed to be, he's the commander in chief.

51:36.546 --> 51:56.971
But if it's not in the commander in chief's hands, but it's in the HHS secretary's hands, and the laws and the directives and the national security operations that are tied to those directives tell the DOD to transfect its troops

51:58.129 --> 52:06.332
I don't think that there's any place in that chain of command where you go, okay, so now we should line up the military and put them on trial.

52:07.372 --> 52:15.235
So much as try to figure out, okay, so who is responsible for putting these in place?

52:15.675 --> 52:17.775
Who's responsible for understanding that?

52:17.875 --> 52:22.037
Who was instead put in place to pretend they don't understand it?

52:22.830 --> 52:25.911
like Aaron Siri, who pretends not to understand.

52:26.471 --> 52:45.178
Even I would go so far as to say that the people who are attacking the PrEP Act are seeming to pretend that they don't understand that the way to attack the PrEP Act is to point out that a non-elected official is empowered to suspend a whole list of fundamental rights

52:46.685 --> 52:52.446
But the official that is allowed to do it is not held to strict scrutiny.

52:52.886 --> 53:07.949
And we have a long precedence in American law for any time there being a suspension of fundamental rights by a law, by a government thing, then that government needs to be held to strict scrutiny.

53:07.989 --> 53:11.270
There needs to be a set of circumstances that justify it.

53:13.803 --> 53:17.605
And maybe that process is not perfect.

53:17.645 --> 53:23.247
Maybe that process could still result in some kind of totalitarian violation of our civil rights.

53:23.388 --> 53:40.996
But those words, strict scrutiny, and what they mean with regard to the government suspending fundamental rights, this is like a law school, an L1 class in constitutional law, as far as I understand.

53:41.056 --> 53:42.236
All I can do is read books.

53:42.316 --> 53:43.537
I never went to law school.

53:44.940 --> 53:54.369
but Aaron Siri seems incapable of explaining why the PrEP Act could be struck as unconstitutional.

53:54.709 --> 54:09.524
There are other people that have been put in front of us that claim that the PrEP Act is treasonous, that the PrEP Act is very bad, but they can't explain it in legal terms as simply as I have been able to explain it for a couple years now.

54:11.513 --> 54:17.135
that when the government suspends fundamental rights, we have a principle in America, it should be held to strict scrutiny.

54:17.595 --> 54:27.019
The other magical thing about this is, is that any lawyer in the UK or any lawyer in the Canada should have absolutely jack all idea what I'm talking about.

54:27.699 --> 54:31.280
Because these are legal principles established in American law.

54:31.881 --> 54:34.181
These words don't mean very much in the UK.

54:34.201 --> 54:35.562
They mean nothing in Canada.

54:37.148 --> 54:41.769
And so what is Viva Fry doing herding American cats?

54:41.850 --> 54:45.351
What is Viva Fry doing talking American law?

54:46.931 --> 54:50.072
When he probably knows less about American law than I do.

54:50.192 --> 54:50.572
Why?

54:51.133 --> 54:55.494
Not because he's a lawyer, but because he's a lawyer in Canada.

54:57.267 --> 55:07.513
And so in order to be a lawyer in Canada, you'd need to be an expert on a whole bunch of shit that would only confuse your potential understanding of American law and American precedents.

55:08.939 --> 55:23.114
Not saying he couldn't do it, but he's another guy who hasn't gotten to the point where he can say that the PREP Act is a law that allows an unelected official to suspend a number of fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny.

55:23.154 --> 55:28.380
And this is reason to strike the law as unconstitutional.

55:29.531 --> 55:33.015
There's no Harvard Law School professor saying that.

55:33.395 --> 55:39.241
There's no Columbia Law professor that's really anti-vax that's capable of saying that.

55:39.701 --> 55:45.928
Mary Holland has had a microphone shoved in her mouth for the last 15 years and hasn't been able to say that.

55:47.149 --> 55:48.631
Mary Holland, Esquire.

55:51.832 --> 55:59.037
I got in front of Bobbie Ann Cox at a Brownstone event in Pittsburgh and asked her about this and she just panicked.

55:59.857 --> 56:06.982
And then this guy Mendel Hall came over and I said to him that this woman doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying.

56:07.822 --> 56:17.368
All I'm trying to say is that the PrEP Act is unconstitutional because an unelected official is allowed to suspend a number of fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny of any kind.

56:17.849 --> 56:20.971
There's not even a list of reasons required

56:22.253 --> 56:24.235
It's just the rational basis test.

56:25.836 --> 56:34.622
Anybody who's never been to law school or read a law school book might not know what the rational basis test is, but it's just basically, you just have to have a rational reason, you know, like a hunch.

56:36.944 --> 56:38.305
And then you can do whatever you want.

56:38.365 --> 56:39.286
That's the PrEP Act.

56:40.627 --> 56:44.510
Not like, you know, 10,000 Americans have to die of the same thing.

56:44.590 --> 56:47.192
Not there, you know, and when is it over?

56:48.399 --> 56:54.262
when you are no longer allowed to suspend fundamental rights is also not codified in that law at all.

56:54.362 --> 56:56.102
All makes it unconstitutional.

56:56.583 --> 57:00.925
But Goldman Sachs lawyer, Aaron Seery can't seem to figure that out.

57:01.105 --> 57:05.106
Pam Popper on YouTube can't seem to figure that out.

57:05.487 --> 57:08.108
Tom Renz, he can't seem to figure that out.

57:08.148 --> 57:10.829
Mary Holland, she can't seem to figure that out.

57:11.089 --> 57:12.810
All of these American people,

57:13.470 --> 57:19.775
Maybe Mary Holland can't figure it out because of the three years she spent in Russia studying Russian law or something like that screwed her up.

57:22.517 --> 57:29.343
Maybe Aaron Seery can't figure it out because he works for Goldman Sachs like, oh, like Steve Bannon works for Goldman Sachs.

57:33.966 --> 57:35.788
Let's listen to more science here.

57:35.828 --> 57:38.230
This is really recent in Pennsylvania.

57:39.036 --> 57:43.320
Katie Carrico and I started working together in 1997.

57:43.981 --> 57:49.647
That's when I came to Penn from the National Institutes of Health from Tony Fauci's lab.

57:50.047 --> 57:53.110
You've probably heard of him and a few other things.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.514
So when I came over,

57:58.206 --> 58:04.350
Katie and I, the only way you could read a journal article back then was to photocopy it.

58:05.310 --> 58:09.093
So we would wait for each other and talk.

58:09.773 --> 58:14.216
And mostly Katie talked and I got a few words in here and there.

58:15.017 --> 58:20.100
But we talked about our interests and what we were doing and what we wanted to work on.

58:21.192 --> 58:31.155
Katie worked on RNA, and she would deliver RNA to any kind of cells, any kind of cell line, and ask, is protein made?

58:32.415 --> 58:37.856
I had worked in HIV pathogenesis, and I worked on dendritic cells.

58:38.617 --> 58:46.599
So I'm not going to overwhelm you with science, but dendritic... I understand that what he is admitting here is he worked on the exact project

58:47.580 --> 59:02.852
that Tony Fauci talked to a BBC reporter about in 2011, which is a HIV vaccine that was targeting dendritic cells, where he was, Tony Fauci was telling stories about having to do it better than the immune system does.

59:04.314 --> 59:08.177
You know, solving the problem that the immune system couldn't solve.

59:08.217 --> 59:09.838
That's a pretty bold statement, right?

59:11.890 --> 59:27.096
And so this guy worked in that project under Tony Fauci, which means that this guy could have very little actual understanding about what he does and the implication of what he's done.

59:27.116 --> 59:29.877
You can hear it in his voice.

59:32.090 --> 59:37.053
Dendritic cells are the cell that starts all immune reactions.

59:37.754 --> 59:43.858
And what that means is that dendritic cells are the critical cell for making a vaccine.

59:44.999 --> 59:50.623
So my interest was I wanted to get mRNA to load dendritic cells.

59:51.504 --> 59:55.226
And here I am bumping into somebody at a copy machine.

59:55.246 --> 59:58.609
Now, what's really interesting is that if you got

59:59.765 --> 01:00:08.513
mRNA into dendritic cells, I guess the dendritic cells would express the protein, would make the protein that was encoded by the mRNA.

01:00:09.414 --> 01:00:25.168
This is in no way the encoding of a protein by RNA in a dendritic cell and then the making of that protein is in no way related as far as we understand.

01:00:26.038 --> 01:00:31.280
to the function of dendritic cells, which is antigen presentation.

01:00:33.742 --> 01:00:49.849
The reason why I turned the reverb on there is for you to understand that for a very long time, they've had people like this guy or people like Peter Cullis pretending that if we could just target one specific type of cell, then this would work out.

01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:54.231
One of the videos that I show in my longer intros is this video of

01:00:54.751 --> 01:01:01.472
a computer-generated coronavirus coming out of the sky and bonding to a membrane and then getting sucked in.

01:01:02.013 --> 01:01:09.974
Later in that video, they show a needle coming in and the nanoparticles coming out and those nanoparticles going into a dendritic cell.

01:01:11.174 --> 01:01:21.257
As if the way that the mRNA vaccine works is that it goes to dendritic cells, those dendritic cells express a protein and then present it to T-cells.

01:01:21.297 --> 01:01:23.377
But that's not at all how this works.

01:01:25.384 --> 01:01:39.135
There's a phagocytotic event where the dendritic cell is sampling from the damage associated molecular pattern, and then deciding what to present.

01:01:40.356 --> 01:01:45.159
And I don't know that there's any protein synthesis involved in that presentation.

01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:49.763
And that presentation, of course, occurs on an adjusted MHC molecule.

01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:59.433
So you have this really interesting set of oversimplified cartoons of immunology.

01:02:00.113 --> 01:02:10.318
And a lot of these people that are in vaccinology per se, they don't understand that understanding that cartoon is not understanding.

01:02:10.358 --> 01:02:12.659
They think that that's part of their expertise.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:14.980
That work was done by other people.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.441
So I don't need to understand it, how it was done.

01:02:17.461 --> 01:02:19.742
I don't need to check it or understand the details of it.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.003
I can just start there.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.102
who makes RNA and gives it the cells.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.363
It was a Reese's moment.

01:02:28.704 --> 01:02:31.426
Again, you'll have to ask an older person what that means.

01:02:32.406 --> 01:02:46.257
But we started working together and we spent eight years fighting our way in the lab, figuring out what was going on and how do we get RNA to work better.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.538
And that led us to our,

01:02:50.489 --> 01:03:02.038
paper in 2005 that allowed us to identify a critical change that was needed in mRNA to get it to work better.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:13.627
So if you look back in the late 90s, many people, many labs, many pharmaceutical companies were working with RNA.

01:03:14.428 --> 01:03:16.309
It went into clinical trials.

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:18.151
It went into people trials.

01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:19.592
And it failed.

01:03:20.959 --> 01:03:23.440
Everybody at that point in time gave up on it.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.041
They said, it's too hard to work with.

01:03:26.141 --> 01:03:27.262
It's too fragile.

01:03:27.842 --> 01:03:29.202
It's too difficult.

01:03:29.663 --> 01:03:31.463
It doesn't make enough protein.

01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:32.444
It doesn't work.

01:03:32.864 --> 01:03:34.024
And they gave up on it.

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:35.685
And that was it.

01:03:36.025 --> 01:03:37.306
Our RNA was dead.

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:41.848
So when Katie... That's basically the story of Robert Malone, right?

01:03:41.888 --> 01:03:48.871
He sold it to Merck or Inderverma sold him out or it wasn't going to work or the immune reaction was too great.

01:03:48.911 --> 01:03:49.871
And then they got out of it.

01:03:52.759 --> 01:03:58.303
But he's still the inventor, and Jill Glasspool Malone is sure that he saved a lot of people by inventing it.

01:03:58.323 --> 01:03:59.984
He and I investigated this.

01:04:00.665 --> 01:04:19.138
We found that we could modify the RNA and make it more stable, make it produce much more protein, and that's what went into the first two COVID vaccines that were approved and helped to stem the tide of the pandemic.

01:04:19.998 --> 01:04:29.024
This is just a calculation of what effect the vaccines had on the COVID-19 pandemic.

01:04:30.184 --> 01:04:49.276
And what it's noting is both the up and down nature of the pandemic, but importantly, once vaccines were introduced, the number of deaths from COVID-19 greatly dropped by enormous amounts.

01:04:50.751 --> 01:04:52.713
It's been calculated the vaccine.

01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:54.634
This is the numbers from the CDC.

01:04:54.694 --> 01:04:58.257
So do you see a tremendous drop in numbers of COVID?

01:04:58.317 --> 01:04:58.818
I do too.

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:00.299
It's remarkable.

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:05.684
It happened right at the beginning of the end of 2022, the beginning of 2023, it just stopped.

01:05:06.204 --> 01:05:09.487
It's like they forgot how to treat pneumonia for about two years.

01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:14.231
And then at the end of 2022, right about here, they just kind of remembered again.

01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:18.995
Isn't that weird?

01:05:19.723 --> 01:05:35.019
saved between 15 and 20 million lives so imagine thinking that you saved between 15 and 20 million lives it must feel good I mean he must get up in the morning and just like think he's got to drink a Mountain Dew for breakfast

01:05:36.946 --> 01:05:44.815
Katie and I spent 25 years working on mRNA, trying to turn it into something useful.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:48.258
And it finally became useful in a vaccine.

01:05:48.859 --> 01:05:52.082
Now, neither of us thinking back from 1997 when we first met,

01:05:54.645 --> 01:06:00.008
ever thought that the vaccine would be proven in a century.

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:09.714
Now not that dissimilar to Denny Rancor or the guy named Dowd or even Nick Hudson.

01:06:10.815 --> 01:06:23.243
There's a lot of people out there who've done the numbers and who are capable of doing the numbers who had no idea, have no idea that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that with a little bit of negligence

01:06:24.224 --> 01:06:28.785
You know, antibiotics don't work on a viral syndrome.

01:06:29.506 --> 01:06:40.529
They could use this buildup of old people that they don't really want to spend the money to keep all of these people alive for as long as possible because that would bankrupt the system.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:43.010
So that's kind of a national security concern.

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:48.212
So what if everybody that came to the hospital was given some supplementary oxygen

01:06:49.523 --> 01:06:56.524
and anybody that developed pneumonia, we would put on a ventilator, but not treat it because it's a viral pneumonia.

01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:01.885
And what if we only did that for two years?

01:07:01.945 --> 01:07:03.345
What would the result look like?

01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:09.787
What if in addition to that, we used a little do not resuscitate orders.

01:07:09.827 --> 01:07:15.568
We sent all the old doctors home and let the residents take care of the ER for a couple of years.

01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:17.348
What if we scared everybody

01:07:18.866 --> 01:07:21.548
on TV about a lab leak behind the scenes.

01:07:21.908 --> 01:07:29.854
What if we had some doctors go on the internet and say that I'm using supplementary oxygen with 60 liters a minute because we're running out of ventilators?

01:07:29.894 --> 01:07:38.901
What if we had a billionaire go on the news and say that he was gonna switch the electric car factory that he has to making ventilators because this is such a shit show?

01:07:40.814 --> 01:07:50.707
What if we gave an incentive to all the corporate hospitals in America to classify non-COVID deaths as COVID deaths, even suspected COVID deaths, because we gave them $35,000 per patient?

01:07:54.540 --> 01:08:03.946
not to the doctor who was heroically trying to save them or to the staff that was risking their lives and going to work to try and save us from the pandemic.

01:08:03.986 --> 01:08:09.650
We didn't give them $35,000 for every person that they tried to save.

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.132
We gave it to the corporate hospital owners.

01:08:15.543 --> 01:08:28.352
What about the hundreds of companies around the United States that took money from the government to put together a group of people that would professionally track and trace contacts of people who had positive cases?

01:08:28.913 --> 01:08:34.016
They paid people $40 an hour to call the contacts of people that were testing positive for COVID.

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:35.878
Where did those companies go?

01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:43.936
There was lateral flow test fraud in the UK.

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:48.659
Tests that were produced in China and then used in the UK to define the pandemic.

01:08:51.881 --> 01:08:59.405
To starve old people in old folks' homes that died of thirst and cold and hunger and urinary tract infection.

01:09:00.746 --> 01:09:05.269
All because a viral syndrome is not appropriately treated with antibiotics.

01:09:07.987 --> 01:09:16.954
And in the meantime, we have this incredibly unsophisticated guy pretending that he just kind of fell face first into the butter.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:17.595
Oh well.

01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:36.150
And they're happy to put him on stage on the biggest audiences and promote these videos because a lot of people are not sophisticated enough to understand this because the truth has never actually been told to them.

01:09:37.114 --> 01:09:58.102
only a very complicated version of some explanation combined with some dumb simple version and then mixed together in some some fire hose of of information when it's just very simple it's incredibly simple

01:10:00.902 --> 01:10:11.545
That's why it makes it so aggravating that there is an anti-vax movement that for 20 years could have just said intramuscular injection is dumb and everything else is smoke and mirrors.

01:10:12.305 --> 01:10:13.025
No big books.

01:10:13.525 --> 01:10:15.046
I don't need a whole rack.

01:10:16.286 --> 01:10:17.426
This is a whole rack.

01:10:20.167 --> 01:10:21.547
This is a whole rack of books.

01:10:21.687 --> 01:10:26.228
None of these books are cool books or, you know, like great biology books.

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:26.989
Those are down here.

01:10:28.169 --> 01:10:28.589
You know, like,

01:10:30.692 --> 01:10:34.473
Antibody phage display and all the methods and protocols of it.

01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:46.898
These are cool books Oops like this book concepts of symbiosis symbiogenesis I'm knocking some books off the back so many books in here.

01:10:47.758 --> 01:10:54.060
These are all the books from the the anti-vax movement and When they came out in what order?

01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:56.261
Look at this for a minute 1988

01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:03.190
Immunization, reality behind the myth.

01:11:03.211 --> 01:11:04.151
You ever heard of this book?

01:11:05.332 --> 01:11:08.074
Did Suzanne Humphreys cite this book?

01:11:08.955 --> 01:11:10.596
Brian Hooker ever tell you about this book?

01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:12.157
How about this book?

01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:17.361
Also from 1988, Eustace Mullins, Injection, Murder by Injection.

01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:18.642
You ever heard of this book before?

01:11:19.022 --> 01:11:20.143
I got a signed copy of it.

01:11:21.064 --> 01:11:21.124
Huh, 1988.

01:11:21.164 --> 01:11:21.904
1991, the virus hunter, Robert Gallo.

01:11:30.424 --> 01:11:30.944
Great book.

01:11:31.224 --> 01:11:31.465
Wow.

01:11:31.725 --> 01:11:32.225
Nail biter.

01:11:35.146 --> 01:11:39.188
Shot in the Dark by Barbara Lowe Fisher.

01:11:39.949 --> 01:11:45.071
Why the P in DTP may be hazardous to your child's health.

01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:47.992
This is an interesting alternative narrative to the MMR.

01:11:48.052 --> 01:11:51.094
We need to have an M, and an M, and an R, and not an MMR.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.015
This is a similar spin.

01:11:53.888 --> 01:11:56.970
This is the lady that is responsible for the NBIC.

01:11:57.871 --> 01:11:59.652
And this is in 1991.

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:04.035
How in the hell is it possible?

01:12:04.055 --> 01:12:04.035
1991?

01:12:07.677 --> 01:12:08.238
Let's see.

01:12:08.298 --> 01:12:10.459
Then Horowitz's book comes out in 1996.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.202
That's emerging viruses, big, thick Ebola thing, right?

01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:16.724
This is the guy who was fighting against

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:22.802
fighting against Bob Gallo in a recording that we've seen.

01:12:23.082 --> 01:12:29.887
98 is when Dancing Naked in Minefields comes out with Carey Mullis.

01:12:30.648 --> 01:12:34.010
The Big Shot in 01.

01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:36.832
This is a book that Mark has done a lot of work on.

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:37.593
Fascinating.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:40.215
I've only read like the first half of it and then I stopped.

01:12:40.715 --> 01:12:41.536
I usually do that.

01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:42.497
I come back and

01:12:43.723 --> 01:12:47.584
I usually inevitably open the book where I need to open it, and I just read those parts.

01:12:48.485 --> 01:13:11.393
Interestingly, this bookshelf starts in 2008 with a Skyhorse Publishing book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, and this is the book where chapter 12 is a... It has an epilogue in it, and the epilogue

01:13:14.704 --> 01:13:22.069
The epilogue is a glimpse of the future, and Ventura gets elected, and he gets elected with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:22.289 --> 01:13:23.430
as his running mate.

01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:40.000
And after he gets elected as a running mate, he gets out of Iraq, and then he's independent, and then he challenges the two leading parties to a debate.

01:13:41.238 --> 01:13:43.059
Uh-oh, starting to sound familiar.

01:13:43.539 --> 01:13:45.599
And then the two parties have a convention.

01:13:46.699 --> 01:13:48.140
And then Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.261
leaves the Democratic Party and agrees to join Jesse Ventura as a running mate.

01:13:54.141 --> 01:14:00.383
And then the Kennedy-Ventura ticket surges in the polls.

01:14:00.443 --> 01:14:04.004
Remember, this is a 2008 Skyhorse publishing book.

01:14:04.724 --> 01:14:05.204
And then U.S.

01:14:06.165 --> 01:14:07.145
bombs Iran.

01:14:08.584 --> 01:14:17.951
then declares martial law after Iranian terror bombs go off in five cities, and then a gunman shoots Ventura.

01:14:24.196 --> 01:14:30.842
And I guess Bobby Kennedy becomes the president.

01:14:38.069 --> 01:14:39.429
That's pretty remarkable.

01:14:44.611 --> 01:14:46.432
And it's something to do with Fidel Castro.

01:14:47.392 --> 01:14:54.435
I mean, so that's the Skyhorse Publishing Book that comes out in what would be 2008.

01:14:54.495 --> 01:14:57.236
So that's not even on the screen here yet.

01:14:57.256 --> 01:14:58.476
This is only 2013 in this graph.

01:14:58.636 --> 01:14:58.956
Then in 2000,

01:15:07.881 --> 01:15:12.983
2010, there's a book called The History of the Peanut Allergy Epidemic.

01:15:13.003 --> 01:15:14.563
This is in 2010.

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:20.785
I just want you to see the reason why I mention this book is because this is the first edition of the book.

01:15:20.805 --> 01:15:21.525
2010, right?

01:15:21.565 --> 01:15:21.845
That's one

01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:37.209
That's two years after the Ventura book that announces that Bobby Kennedy is going to get to the White House as vice president and then his president will be shot and then he'll be president.

01:15:37.249 --> 01:15:39.070
So this book comes out two years later.

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:48.452
In the same year that the peanut allergy epidemic book came out, Callous Disregard by Andrew Wakefield comes out with a forward by Jenny McCarthy.

01:15:51.115 --> 01:15:54.976
Then Polly Tommy's book comes out in 2011.

01:15:55.236 --> 01:15:57.156
It's not with Skyhorse Publishing though.

01:15:57.176 --> 01:16:04.178
It's with something like Praticus and it's Autism, A Practical Guide to Improving Your Child's Quality of Life.

01:16:04.218 --> 01:16:08.459
So this is not a book that's gonna tell you not to take any vaccines.

01:16:08.539 --> 01:16:12.820
This is a book that's gonna tell you how to, I guess, fix the gut or some shit like that.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:20.233
And in the same year, 2011, Viral Storm by Nathan Wolfe comes out.

01:16:20.273 --> 01:16:30.178
This is the guy who apparently had used metagenomic sequencing, shotgun sequencing that was invented by the guy that found the phages in the mucus of coral.

01:16:30.598 --> 01:16:37.322
That guy, he used metagenomic sequencing to look for the dark matter of life in all these viruses and none of them

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:39.184
are involved in bacteria.

01:16:39.204 --> 01:16:40.785
They're all against us, I guess.

01:16:41.266 --> 01:16:43.508
Anyway, this is also a fake virologist, right?

01:16:43.548 --> 01:16:52.458
He's very similar to, it's like the American version of Peter Daszak, and he's connected to Hunter Biden and the fake labs that are in the Ukraine.

01:16:53.911 --> 01:16:55.811
and they may have just been producing lots.

01:16:55.871 --> 01:17:04.473
And so then in 2012, you've got Waging the War on the Autistic Child, also by some guy by the name of Andrew Wakefield, also Skyhorse Publishing.

01:17:05.533 --> 01:17:15.215
And then in 2013, you have Dissolving Illusions that comes out with Suzanne Humphries, and she doesn't seem to be aware of any books that came before her.

01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:21.276
She just has some graphs that she got from some guy named Roman, and she tells you in that video with,

01:17:22.336 --> 01:17:28.981
Brandy Vaughn that, you know, Roman did all the work and all she did was just, you know, help write the book or something like that.

01:17:29.141 --> 01:17:43.410
And then in 2016, Sky Horse Publishing puts out James Lyons Weiler's book, Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism, which just has basically restated the title and premise of the book on PBS NewsHour two days ago.

01:17:43.971 --> 01:17:51.155
And in that year later, the third edition of Peanut Allergy Epidemic comes out and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:51.215 --> 01:17:52.036
wrote the foreword.

01:17:53.978 --> 01:17:54.198
Huh.

01:17:55.439 --> 01:17:58.402
So I thought I'd read the forward that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:58.462 --> 01:18:11.113
wrote to the third edition to this book in 2017 before the World Mercury Project changed its name to Children's Health Defense and employed

01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:21.937
Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Merrill Nass to, underneath the general counsel, Mr. Bobby Kennedy.

01:18:21.978 --> 01:18:22.679
And also they had

01:18:23.109 --> 01:18:27.110
Of course, Rolf Hazlehurst involved, and he's also a hero that they don't talk about, ever.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:29.311
So let's go over here.

01:18:29.931 --> 01:18:33.632
This is the introduction, again, to the peanut allergy epidemic.

01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:41.074
The third edition, this is a book by Heather Frazier, which we don't hear very much of, and the forward by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:41.114 --> 01:18:45.735
Remember, again, the reason why I'm saying this is because the book originally came out in 2010, not in 2017.

01:18:49.536 --> 01:18:53.657
And it's basically the same book, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:53.717 --> 01:18:58.158
released another version of it with Sky Horse Publishing, right?

01:18:58.958 --> 01:18:59.838
See it on the back there.

01:19:00.639 --> 01:19:02.119
And did the forward to it.

01:19:02.179 --> 01:19:14.962
Now you might think, oh wow, you know, now you're gonna see a thing where he connects the book that she wrote about the peanut allergy and vaccines to a lot of other things.

01:19:16.411 --> 01:19:22.357
Because of course, he's about to change the World Mercury Project to Children's Health Defense.

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:24.619
He was already in the movie Vaxxed.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.942
He's already met all of these people.

01:19:28.042 --> 01:19:30.945
He knows about ICANN because it's already formed.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:37.792
But Sky Horse Publishing that published how many years earlier?

01:19:39.389 --> 01:19:44.933
Skyhorse Publishing published a book with Jesse Ventura suggesting that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:44.953 --> 01:19:48.275
would be a great vice president in 2008.

01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:59.162
And in 2017, Bobby Kennedy is writing the foreword to a Skyhorse Publishing version of the peanut allergy epidemic.

01:20:01.044 --> 01:20:08.549
What I think I see here is a political movement that is hijacking an anti-vax movement for its own purposes.

01:20:09.775 --> 01:20:16.197
with no intention of ever forwarding any of the real biological ideas like intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:20:16.638 --> 01:20:20.819
And you can see that by comparing the biology of ingestion versus injection.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.801
And so let's read this forward just for shits and giggles.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:37.373
My son Connor was born in 1994 and developed chronic asthma, food allergies, and anaphylaxis that required 29 emergency room visits before he was three years old.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:41.294
His brother Finn, born four years later, also developed anaphylaxis.

01:20:41.855 --> 01:20:46.817
What are the chances neither their mother nor I had any allergies, not even allergic to poison ivy?

01:20:46.857 --> 01:20:47.937
I don't even know what that means.

01:20:49.019 --> 01:20:56.126
Epidemic allergy in our children emerged suddenly and then ramped up inexorably throughout the 1990s in every American community.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:21:01.211
Its impacts affect our businesses, public spaces, transportation, and schools.

01:21:01.251 --> 01:21:08.457
Without explanation, children with allergies to peanuts, milk, fish, bee venom, latex, pollens, and more were filling our classrooms.

01:21:09.258 --> 01:21:13.081
Peanut allergy is now so prevalent that it impacts everyday consumer behavior.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:26.251
30% of polled mothers said that nut allergy influenced food purchase decisions, and 67% considered nut allergy when buying snacks for an event with children.

01:21:27.272 --> 01:21:32.436
We have all watched in bewilderment as peanut allergies among children skyrocketed from 0.8% in 2002 to 1.4% in 2008.

01:21:37.881 --> 01:21:42.324
Just three years later in 2011, another study indicated an incidence as high as 2.8.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:47.608
Upwards of 2 million children in the United States now allergic to peanuts.

01:21:48.388 --> 01:22:03.699
Schools learned to protect vulnerable kids with cupboards filled with EpiPens and puffers, hand-washing protocols, food bans, and exempt spaces, inconveniences that sometimes annoy non-allergy families, but provided some reassurance to worried parents like me.

01:22:05.563 --> 01:22:20.702
Incidentally, I knew an adult in Norway, an American, the husband of a colleague of mine, and he was peanut allergic to the point where he needed to go to the hospital like immediately if he was exposed to it.

01:22:21.342 --> 01:22:28.664
Initially, researchers believed peanut allergy was unique to Western countries, specifically United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

01:22:28.724 --> 01:22:32.505
Then suddenly similar epidemics exploded in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Africa.

01:22:32.986 --> 01:22:34.086
Where is this coming from?

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:37.007
I knew the answer could not be solely genetic.

01:22:39.147 --> 01:22:44.669
As my friend, Dr. Boyd Haley, Chairman of Emeritus of the University of

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.243
Kentucky Department of Chemistry says genes don't cause epidemics.

01:22:52.383 --> 01:22:56.786
Genes can provide vulnerability, but then you need an environmental toxin.

01:22:56.846 --> 01:23:00.409
What toxin had launched the allergy cascade?

01:23:00.449 --> 01:23:01.590
So what toxin?

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:05.833
It must be a specific toxin.

01:23:05.973 --> 01:23:07.714
It can't be a methodology.

01:23:10.356 --> 01:23:16.841
It can't be like getting hit in the head with a hard object, and it doesn't really matter what the object is, you know?

01:23:17.711 --> 01:23:19.252
That's how you should see it.

01:23:19.492 --> 01:23:32.398
If I hit you in the head with a dumbbell, or I hit you in the head with a baseball bat, or I hit you in the head with a ball-peen hammer, or I hit you in the head with the handle of a screwdriver, there's certain differences there, for sure.

01:23:33.499 --> 01:23:36.040
Some might have more lethality than others.

01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:39.262
But arguing about it,

01:23:39.935 --> 01:23:51.406
The difference between a ball peen hammer doing it, or is it weights, or is it a dumbbell, is where they're going when they say, but what toxin?

01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:56.671
In 1998, I was among a group of young parents who co-founded the Food Allergy Initiative.

01:23:56.711 --> 01:24:00.735
So in 1998, he was already getting in these groups.

01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:05.537
to research cures for food allergies.

01:24:05.677 --> 01:24:18.203
Interesting that that would be around the same time that Paul Shattuck would come to Paula Aitken's house and find out why her son didn't have the bowel problems that all these other kids had.

01:24:18.883 --> 01:24:24.566
FAI did extraordinary work in developing treatments, but I remained intensely curious about identifying the cause.

01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:28.664
Intensely curious, he really wants to figure this shit out.

01:24:29.204 --> 01:24:46.117
In my own research, I learned that a host of other childhood epidemics, autism, ADD, ADHD, SIDS, OCD, ASD, narcolepsy, sleep and seizures disorder, developmental dislays, autoimmune diseases, and tics all began rising in the early 90s.

01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:52.846
Sounds like he's about to get violent, right?

01:24:52.886 --> 01:24:56.927
He sounds like he's gonna go buy a gun and start shooting people because this is really serious.

01:24:56.947 --> 01:24:58.387
This is not fucking around anymore.

01:24:59.388 --> 01:25:00.288
Excuse my language.

01:25:01.748 --> 01:25:19.034
Coincidentally, this is the time period during which the Center for Disease Control and Prevention dramatically expanded the vaccine schedule, raising children's exposure to mercury, aluminum, and other toxic vaccine ingredients.

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.970
which people like Brandy Vaughn have put on billboards.

01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:42.300
Public health authorities expanded the schedule, including a battery of metal-laden vaccines, first in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and subsequently in Asia and Africa, along a timeline exquisitely correlated with the explosion of these new childhood epidemics in these locales.

01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:48.103
Abundant peer-reviewed science linked mercury, a known neurotoxin, to

01:25:49.053 --> 01:25:54.180
Sorry, I gotta fold that a little different.

01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:57.905
Injuries that now, according to the CDC, afflict one in six Americans.

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:02.451
In 2003, I wrote a book assembling and synthesizing hundreds of these studies.

01:26:05.128 --> 01:26:05.949
I wonder what book that is.

01:26:06.209 --> 01:26:13.598
As I searched medical literature on PubMed, I occasionally came across studies linking these contaminants to anaphylaxis, asthma, allergies, and eczema.

01:26:14.139 --> 01:26:22.189
While the timing of the anaphylaxis explosion suggests a link to sudden expansion of the vaccine schedule, the published science on its origins was surprisingly sparse.

01:26:24.525 --> 01:26:30.128
Scientists and public health officials have offered numerous theories purporting to explain the epidemic.

01:26:30.308 --> 01:26:38.233
The hygiene hypothesis, GMOs, glyphosate-based pesticides, environmental pollutants, peanut mold.

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:43.676
But the proliferation of these exposures did not neatly coincide with the allergy epidemic.

01:26:43.756 --> 01:26:49.820
None of these potential causes explain the sudden meteoric rise of anaphylaxis in the early 90s.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:27:03.364
Seeking answers that might help end the epidemic, National Peanut Allergy Board, along with the Food Allergy Research and Education and the National Institutes of Health, funded the LEAP study in 2010.

01:27:03.924 --> 01:27:09.646
However, the study, which was published in 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine, sheds little light on causation.

01:27:09.706 --> 01:27:19.749
We learned only that children at risk of developing peanut allergy were those who already had severe egg allergy or eczema.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:36.089
The only person in my family who has any allergies at all, besides me having developed eczema after my rabies vaccination at the University of Pittsburgh, is my daughter, who for a while was allergic to eggs.

01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:39.532
And I think that allergy went away because she was breastfed for so long.

01:27:40.733 --> 01:27:47.019
But she also got the hepatitis B and vitamin K shot on her birth without our permission, because we did not know it was coming.

01:27:47.634 --> 01:27:52.136
And we didn't know it was coming because there was no effective warning system out there.

01:27:52.196 --> 01:27:58.678
Nobody like Children's Health Defense had any billboards up there that was at least trying to eliminate vaccines on birthdays.

01:28:00.319 --> 01:28:01.039
Unfortunately.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.500
Don't want to spend money on that.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:11.023
We've got too many big salaries to pay at Children's Health Defense to spend money on billboards that might save babies from injections on day one.

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:14.991
Ciliary allergies can lead to more allergies.

01:28:15.031 --> 01:28:19.032
That struck me as a circular conclusion and brought us no closer to answering the riddle.

01:28:19.472 --> 01:28:20.373
What was triggering?

01:28:20.893 --> 01:28:23.374
It really feels like he kind of wants to know.

01:28:25.475 --> 01:28:37.239
In the summer of 2016, I asked Dr. James Baker, head of the nonprofit FAIR, formerly FAI, and former senior vice president of Merck's vaccine division, whether vaccines could cause a pandemic.

01:28:39.234 --> 01:28:41.556
cause a food allergy epidemic.

01:28:41.596 --> 01:28:42.978
I'm just shocked that this is Merck.

01:28:44.259 --> 01:28:49.345
He told me it was a possibility that should be looked into, but unfortunately nobody is studying it at that moment.

01:28:50.547 --> 01:28:52.689
Dr. Baker's candor was refreshing.

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:58.475
Most scientists understand the radioactive peril of raising questions that implicate vaccine safety.

01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:06.115
scientists like doctors and journalists know that a vaccine debate can be a career-ending minefield.

01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:17.902
Now what I want you to understand is that if you believe what you said you believed on the page before this, then you need to call for courage.

01:29:19.864 --> 01:29:23.226
Not that dissimilar to trying to understand

01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:30.611
If you really think that abortion is murdering babies, then, you know, I understand why you might go to extreme measures.

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:32.873
I really do.

01:29:33.854 --> 01:29:40.460
I don't think you should, because I don't think extreme measures are a good way of solving human problems, but they may be necessary.

01:29:42.065 --> 01:29:55.797
If you think hundreds of thousands of kids are being given autism and ADD and ADHD and SIDS and OCD and ASD, which ASD is Osteo spectrum disorder, but autism is listed.

01:29:55.837 --> 01:29:58.119
See, that's what's so stupid about this, right?

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:02.483
Autism is listed here, attention deficit disorder.

01:30:04.825 --> 01:30:07.788
This is like hyperactivity disorder, which is kind of the same thing.

01:30:08.854 --> 01:30:14.316
then SIDS, then OCD, then ASD, which is autism spectrum disorder.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:21.539
So is this really, is this really trying to win here by being super precise?

01:30:21.639 --> 01:30:26.321
Or are you actually screwing people over who don't understand that this list is bullshit?

01:30:26.361 --> 01:30:28.722
It's repeating here and it's repeating here.

01:30:31.263 --> 01:30:33.284
No chronic fatigue syndrome is lifted here.

01:30:38.519 --> 01:30:48.846
even though he's, you know, later going to promote Judy Mikovits as being a hero for maybe coming out about chronic fatigue syndrome being related to the vaccines because the vaccines are contaminated with a mouse virus, right?

01:30:49.807 --> 01:30:55.091
So around that time of discussion with Dr. Baker, I stumbled on Heather's book and I devoured it ravenously.

01:30:55.511 --> 01:30:56.212
Heather has done

01:30:56.812 --> 01:31:02.436
for allergies, what Jared Diamond did for the broader concept of human history in his book, Guns, Germs, and Steel.

01:31:03.036 --> 01:31:11.422
Guns, Germs, and Steel is a really interesting book because in Guns, Germs, and Steel, the biological weapons are not viruses.

01:31:12.943 --> 01:31:13.604
Did you know that?

01:31:14.805 --> 01:31:23.731
The biological weapons that he discusses there are bacteria that are genetically modified to produce proteins that are human proteins.

01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:38.075
And so if you get exposed to this bacteria, and the bacteria causes an infection like salmonella would, then your body will develop antibodies and an immune response to the proteins on the outside of that bacteria.

01:31:38.495 --> 01:31:48.485
And if those proteins were myelin, then your body would develop a very advanced form of MS, multiple sclerosis, in a matter of weeks.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:54.483
And they did that by producing salmonella that had myelin protein on the outside.

01:31:55.324 --> 01:31:57.765
Nothing to do with gain of function viruses.

01:31:58.266 --> 01:32:02.148
That is a transfected bacterial culture.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:11.594
That is the biological warfare that's outlined in Jared Diamond's book.

01:32:11.634 --> 01:32:12.294
Think about that.

01:32:13.675 --> 01:32:15.757
Viruses are this hypothetical thing.

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:19.994
that based on your assumption that RNA can do that stuff.

01:32:20.675 --> 01:32:34.832
But a transfected culture of salmonella that is expressing myelin protein on the outside is a nasty, nasty, real biological weapon.

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:50.495
Although she's not a scientist, she used her gift to synthesize a wide range of scientific disciplines in history to arrive at a simple, coherent, integrated, and common sense hypothesis that for the first time, convincingly explains the sudden onset of the allergy epidemic.

01:32:50.535 --> 01:32:56.720
Her theory accounts for its steep rise in America and its subsequent movement from Western nations into the developed world.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:05.766
Heather tracks the allergy epidemic's causes to US political, legal, and medical reforms in the late 80s.

01:33:06.907 --> 01:33:08.288
In 1986, the U.S.

01:33:08.348 --> 01:33:16.233
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program eliminated liability for vaccine manufacturers.

01:33:16.454 --> 01:33:17.114
All true.

01:33:17.674 --> 01:33:22.338
Any company shrewd and connected enough to persuade the CDC to add their products to the schedule could cash in.

01:33:22.918 --> 01:33:33.885
Vaccination schedule rapidly expanded without anybody performing comprehensive safety analysis or testing the possible negative synergies from a battery of multiple early vaccinations.

01:33:33.945 --> 01:33:34.406
So again,

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:39.811
We're starting to get into the complicated explanations for the very simple reason.

01:33:40.912 --> 01:33:50.002
I don't know, maybe it's because it's a negative synergy between hitting them with a baseball bat and hitting them with a frying pan.

01:33:51.684 --> 01:33:56.529
Maybe it's the synergistic, you know, multiple hits to the head are bad.

01:33:57.301 --> 01:33:59.363
and they can't seem to do the analysis yet.

01:33:59.824 --> 01:34:08.653
Nor did the public health regulators make any effort to perform a mass loading calculation of the combined mercury and aluminum exposures from so many new vaccines.

01:34:10.955 --> 01:34:19.183
So now we're gonna get safe vaccines by reducing the adjuvants, by identifying the bad adjuvants and never teaching basic biology 101.

01:34:21.516 --> 01:34:31.962
Having read Fraser's analysis, it seems strange to me that no one had previously connected the dots between the vaccine schedule and anaphylaxis crisis that preceded.

01:34:32.842 --> 01:34:40.467
No one had connected the dots before, except for this guy named Waylon James.

01:34:41.707 --> 01:34:43.308
He seems to have connected it in 1988.

01:34:43.488 --> 01:34:50.310
And Eustace Mullins also seems to have connected it in 1988.

01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:58.314
And then there's a whole flood of books that have nothing to do with reality that come after those books.

01:34:59.914 --> 01:35:03.336
And no one before Heather has ever connected this thing.

01:35:04.576 --> 01:35:05.036
Interesting.

01:35:05.957 --> 01:35:10.919
Those path-breaking vaccinologists quickly discovered that injecting an allergen directly into the bloodstream pipe

01:35:12.232 --> 01:35:16.075
bypassing the digestive process often provokes anaphylaxis.

01:35:16.716 --> 01:35:24.202
Medical literature shows how powerful adjuvants added to vaccines in order to increase the immunological response also amplify the allergic response.

01:35:24.342 --> 01:35:25.083
Adjuvants promote

01:35:26.438 --> 01:35:37.285
Allergic sensitization not just to vaccine antigens, but also to other bystander proteins and allergens in the ambient environment at the time that the adjuvant vaccines are administered.

01:35:37.925 --> 01:35:46.851
Thus, a child vaccinated with aluminum adjuvants during a spring ragweed outbreak may develop a lifelong allergy to ragweed, peanut oil.

01:35:47.871 --> 01:35:54.676
Further, as noted by the LEAP study, once a child has developed allergies, there's a tendency to develop more.

01:35:55.643 --> 01:36:14.774
And of course, that would be because their hypersymbiosis with their bacteria in their gut and the phages that they produce is now totally off balance and probably no longer in sync, no longer effectively assisting the microbiome as you're supposed to by selecting for their phages and eliminating those of the competitors.

01:36:15.794 --> 01:36:22.098
It did not allude to me that the same pharmaceutical companies have transformed vaccination into a lucrative enterprise.

01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:31.557
In 19, I invited Heather to give a presentation at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:36:32.017 --> 01:36:41.343
The Broad Institute, you know, where people as diverse as Helena Chan and Kevin McKernan have all taken paychecks.

01:36:43.044 --> 01:36:51.250
A prestigious group of well-funded and experienced scientists gathered at MIT to find a way to turn off the allergic reaction by identifying genetic precursors to allergies.

01:36:52.605 --> 01:37:01.287
This is good, important work, but I wanted them to hear and understand Heather's story of the peanut allergy from a historical perspective, one that was supported by a rich library of medical literature.

01:37:01.367 --> 01:37:13.069
Using a series of vivid slides, Fraser clearly explained the provocative role of aluminum adjuvants, conjugate vaccine technology, and combination vaccines in the allergy explosion.

01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:20.511
Look at that complicated explanation for intramuscular injection of any combination of substances being dumb.

01:37:22.691 --> 01:37:23.972
They don't want you to know.

01:37:23.992 --> 01:37:34.696
Again, in case there was any chance that Heather Fraser's book was going to let you know, they needed to put a forward in front of it to make sure that they complicated it as much as possible.

01:37:34.756 --> 01:37:40.798
Fraser's presentation was strong and convincing, but it only raised mild interest among the scientists.

01:37:41.019 --> 01:37:44.500
They were not the least bit skeptical, but they explained to us, this is not what we do.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.603
Their expertise, they said, were human genes.

01:37:53.174 --> 01:37:55.295
Their expertise is human genes.

01:37:55.716 --> 01:38:04.161
When I questioned them, they acknowledged that the allergy epidemic must have been triggered by an environmental toxin and that their research was unlikely to identify the culprit.

01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:09.104
They told me that they did not need to know what caused the peanut allergy in order to find the treatment.

01:38:09.264 --> 01:38:09.945
Ha ha.

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:19.871
I began thinking that refusal to look at the possible causal role of vaccines was like trying to find a genetic cause for sunburn without considering the role of the sun.

01:38:22.267 --> 01:38:24.328
What an interesting standpoint to take then.

01:38:25.089 --> 01:38:26.790
So what's the sun in this analogy?

01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:28.891
Too many vaccines?

01:38:29.832 --> 01:38:31.333
Vaccinating when your kid is sick?

01:38:32.274 --> 01:38:37.297
Or intramuscular injection is just plain dumb?

01:38:38.991 --> 01:38:51.379
because I think that for all this time, we have been herded into a trap where they were never gonna say that intramuscular injection is dumb, but they're gonna give you some mealy-mouthed explanation about how it's combination vaccines that are dumb.

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:55.042
It is the accumulation of heavy metals that's dumb.

01:38:55.222 --> 01:39:05.769
Any one particular shot doesn't hurt people, even though they had a whole bus that they were touring around the United States that said these people had early, immediate onset symptoms.

01:39:06.783 --> 01:39:13.086
that would never require a long-term placebo-controlled trial to establish as existing.

01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:16.194
And yet none of these people have promoted it yet.

01:39:16.595 --> 01:39:27.702
And in fact, here, he's kind of accentuating the longer term side effects, the longer term development of allergies and other things, instead of the immediate.

01:39:28.402 --> 01:39:40.130
And the immediate part would reveal that it's intramuscular injection of any combination of substances, not one particular one, not accumulation of it, even though that's probably a factor.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:48.923
I wanted to prevent a new generation of children from being pushed into the river in the first place.

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:55.427
Their work is important, but these scientists were trying to save the children downstream.

01:39:56.087 --> 01:40:00.690
I wanted to prevent a new generation of children from being pushed into the river in the first place.

01:40:03.251 --> 01:40:11.256
But if he effectively does not see that hitting a kid in the head with any piece of metal or wood

01:40:11.966 --> 01:40:36.182
or any hard, heavy object is dumb, then we can do an awful lot of studies about whether a baseball bat is too hard to hit a kid with, or whether a dumbbell is too hard to hit a kid with, or maybe a set of wooden nunchucks is appropriate to hit a kid in the head with, and then we'll make a list of safe things that we can hit our kids in the head with.

01:40:37.663 --> 01:40:38.884
That's what this sounds like.

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.003
because he still doesn't seem to understand.

01:40:42.604 --> 01:40:44.527
Heather's book cracks the code?

01:40:44.987 --> 01:40:45.949
What's the crack?

01:40:50.776 --> 01:40:53.279
This is a Skyhorse book from, um...

01:40:54.807 --> 01:40:57.948
This is a Skyhorse book from 2017.

01:40:59.068 --> 01:41:00.389
Sorry for the abrupt cut there.

01:41:00.429 --> 01:41:02.909
I could do this, but I didn't.

01:41:03.049 --> 01:41:03.970
I apologize for that.

01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:06.430
So that's 2017.

01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:08.831
They redo that one.

01:41:08.891 --> 01:41:14.792
Then in 2018, Moth in the Iron Lung comes out and also this book by Tom Cowan.

01:41:18.403 --> 01:41:22.305
where he seems to know I guess there's something wrong with vaccines or something like that.

01:41:22.846 --> 01:41:29.429
Then one of the better books that I think is out there comes out, which is this one, How to End the Autism Epidemic.

01:41:29.489 --> 01:41:33.151
I think this is one of those books that everybody should probably have.

01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:34.592
A lot of the studies in here are good.

01:41:34.612 --> 01:41:35.553
A lot of the arguments are good.

01:41:35.573 --> 01:41:36.994
I think chapter four is really nice.

01:41:38.335 --> 01:41:41.357
I can't say anything really bad about this book, so I don't know about J.B.

01:41:41.397 --> 01:41:42.858
Hanley or who he is.

01:41:42.898 --> 01:41:44.119
And this is Chelsea Green.

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:49.163
So this is the same publishing company that published Tom Cowan's book.

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:57.410
Then Three Seconds to Midnight, that's Steve Hatfield's book, comes out in 2019.

01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:59.992
So this is really close to the start of the pandemic.

01:42:00.032 --> 01:42:01.093
Steve Hatfield has a book.

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.084
And then it just starts, right?

01:42:04.144 --> 01:42:05.885
Then the list of books comes out.

01:42:05.985 --> 01:42:09.087
Anthony Fauci, the real Anthony Fauci comes out in 2021.

01:42:09.147 --> 01:42:15.150
They basically use this to campaign to get Bobby on the White House ticket.

01:42:15.411 --> 01:42:16.771
And first he's independent.

01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:26.717
And I think they really hoped that like they told the story here, that the independent candidate would be absorbed as a vice president.

01:42:26.737 --> 01:42:29.378
They told that story in a book in 2008.

01:42:32.216 --> 01:42:42.038
The fake anti-vax movement in America with their float in the parade and sitting on the throne is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:42.359 --> 01:42:59.703
and at his side are people like Merrill Nass and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker are actually also supported by people like Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy

01:43:00.865 --> 01:43:14.031
All of whom, even Stephen Bannon will regularly promote CHD and Mary Holland because it is all one fake anti-vax movement that was used to herd a bunch of people politically.

01:43:14.091 --> 01:43:21.874
To herd a bunch of cats into politically manipulating them into believing that Donald Trump and the Maha movement was something real.

01:43:23.955 --> 01:43:27.337
It's like faking your enthusiasm for NBA basketball.

01:43:29.634 --> 01:43:39.856
You know, you buy a bunch of shorts and you buy a bunch of shirts and you wear the stuff and you put a little face paint on and you learn some stats and you start saying that the NBA is really great.

01:43:40.596 --> 01:43:41.817
But that's not being honest.

01:43:42.817 --> 01:43:44.957
You know the NBA hasn't been great for years.

01:43:44.997 --> 01:43:47.118
You know that they haven't been calling travels for years.

01:43:47.158 --> 01:43:53.819
You know that they... It's the same game, unfortunately.

01:43:56.573 --> 01:44:04.723
And so the next pandemic of the entire world, but that's life.

01:44:09.437 --> 01:44:10.518
and the audience laughs.

01:44:10.558 --> 01:44:11.738
So this gets worse, right?

01:44:11.758 --> 01:44:17.982
Because- When Secretary Kennedy asked me to do, to answer the question, what is causing the rise in autism?

01:44:19.602 --> 01:44:24.845
This is a guy who met me several times in person during the course of the pandemic.

01:44:25.566 --> 01:44:37.152
This is a guy who pleaded with me not to mention Robert Malone's name again, not mention anybody's name again, just teach the biology that he defers to me on because he's not sophisticated enough to understand it.

01:44:39.119 --> 01:44:43.742
Later, he sent me another text correcting that, saying that he doesn't agree with my biology.

01:44:43.802 --> 01:44:46.483
But when I interviewed him, he said that, you know, you're the biologist.

01:44:46.523 --> 01:44:47.244
I defer to you.

01:44:47.544 --> 01:44:48.605
I'm just an economist.

01:44:50.586 --> 01:45:02.093
This guy is now allowed by the big show to talk to Dr. Drew in front of official White House signage.

01:45:04.454 --> 01:45:05.915
And this cannot be by accident.

01:45:07.742 --> 01:45:10.184
This will never be shown on mainstream media.

01:45:10.204 --> 01:45:14.207
This will probably only be shown to the people who social media wants it to see.

01:45:14.727 --> 01:45:34.903
But nonetheless, this is a extremely discrediting moment because not only is he talking to Dr. Drew, but Dr. Drew has regularly promoted the traitor, Sasha Latupova, whose daughter played a very macabre character on the internet when she was a minor.

01:45:36.246 --> 01:45:47.434
and was promoted on Alex Jones as soon as she became 18, as far as I can tell, after having spoof threatened to kill the YouTube CEO.

01:45:48.855 --> 01:45:55.900
And sometime in the last few years, she made a video with her mom at a gun range about shooting the president for the white race.

01:45:57.998 --> 01:46:00.340
These are not things that have disappeared from the internet.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.541
These are things that are just conveniently ignored.

01:46:02.561 --> 01:46:13.329
That nobody seems to notice that Dr. Drew promotes somebody with such a macabre history of what can only be characterized as child abuse.

01:46:15.331 --> 01:46:26.079
She has her underage daughter on the internet faking a powder-based overdose before talking about sex.

01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:35.644
This is a terrible person who was promoted repeatedly on the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:36.364 --> 01:46:44.468
Defender podcast, repeatedly with podcasts by CHD, with Meryl Nass and Pauly Tommy as hosts.

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:56.094
This woman was on stage with the traitor Robert Malone in 2023, in January, in Sweden, talking about how it was the DOD, but we'd never really figure it out.

01:46:59.013 --> 01:47:08.541
And now Dr. Drew is talking to my friend, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the National Institutes of Health.

01:47:12.784 --> 01:47:14.245
And this is supposed to be real.

01:47:17.008 --> 01:47:18.509
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:18.569 --> 01:47:24.453
has asked Jay Bhattacharya to figure out the autism epidemic, which I thought

01:47:25.473 --> 01:47:37.203
I thought Heather Frazier had cracked the puzzle in 2010 in her original book that got republished by Skyhorse Publishing seven years later.

01:47:37.223 --> 01:47:39.344
I thought she'd cracked the code.

01:47:42.747 --> 01:47:44.468
What do we need some economist?

01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:50.934
I was about to say something really rude there, but what do we need some economist?

01:47:52.185 --> 01:47:58.452
from Stanford to be the head of the NIH, if the guy doesn't even understand biology, defers to me as a biologist.

01:47:58.992 --> 01:48:04.198
It's actually surprising how much can they get done when there's the political will to do it.

01:48:04.438 --> 01:48:08.662
That's a question that has been very difficult to get scientists to actually address.

01:48:08.963 --> 01:48:10.284
I don't know the answer why Rochester.

01:48:10.384 --> 01:48:11.485
I don't either, but I'd like to know.

01:48:11.565 --> 01:48:19.990
And by the way, I would also argue that there's been a political movement to suppress the question even, and it's amazing how much that can have an effect.

01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:21.351
That actually didn't surprise me.

01:48:21.391 --> 01:48:21.872
I knew about it.

01:48:21.912 --> 01:48:23.933
This is discrediting the United States.

01:48:24.734 --> 01:48:31.138
By allowing Dr. Drew to interview anyone of significance in front of a White House signage is just gross.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.162
I think Dr. Drew is like the epitome of what grifter means.

01:48:37.422 --> 01:48:37.902
I'll do any

01:48:39.929 --> 01:48:47.455
I'll do any ad, I'll read any script, I'll look into any camera and say whatever you want to say, just put the money on the table.

01:48:47.515 --> 01:48:48.716
That's really who he is.

01:48:49.537 --> 01:48:52.759
And why is Jay Bhattacharya legitimizing this guy?

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.021
Because he was told to.

01:48:56.842 --> 01:49:05.089
You think Jay Bhattacharya's best bet for getting his message out was to go to Dr. Drew, or do you think somebody told him that now you have a Dr. Drew interview?

01:49:05.623 --> 01:49:06.083
about that.

01:49:06.484 --> 01:49:11.928
What I didn't know was that when there's a political will to answer a question like this, it will happen.

01:49:12.549 --> 01:49:15.411
Remember that when he was on stage with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:23.058
about a week ago, he said that there was a decrease in life expectancy in America, but he had no explanation for it.

01:49:26.621 --> 01:49:29.984
Even though the explanation is right there, it starts with O and ends with D.

01:49:35.148 --> 01:49:36.449
The code was cracked!

01:49:52.256 --> 01:49:54.178
for funding to study the problem.

01:49:54.198 --> 01:50:08.317
We'll give data available to them so that they can analyze the links of autism with environmental exposure, diet, age of the birds.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:29.953
age of the parents exactly what pbs news hour just told you a couple days ago it's you it can be that the dad's too old to have kids then you get this autism shit you know when the dad's real old then you get a lot of autistic sperm well the above approach yeah good and uh with no

01:50:31.031 --> 01:50:33.292
a priori, thumb on the scale, you can't look at that.

01:50:33.312 --> 01:50:35.392
And so we'll have an honest answer.

01:50:35.412 --> 01:50:39.933
I mean, it's hard to, as a scientist, I never say, oh, can we know this in two days?

01:50:39.953 --> 01:50:42.374
Because two days from now, you say, well, where's the answer?

01:50:43.154 --> 01:50:47.355
But I think that we actually, for the first time in history, are really honestly asking the question.

01:50:47.915 --> 01:50:58.497
And because I've been at a party or two with this guy and eaten tacos and drank beer next to him, I just can't take this seriously.

01:51:00.743 --> 01:51:05.947
I feel like, more than anything right now, this just irks me.

01:51:06.828 --> 01:51:08.589
Because I know this is just a performance.

01:51:08.609 --> 01:51:14.093
There's no possible way, after all the conversations that I've had with this guy, that this is real.

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:18.337
He can't possibly be the head of NIH.

01:51:19.398 --> 01:51:20.518
He's pretending to be.

01:51:21.279 --> 01:51:28.745
If the head of the NIH is more like the guy who dresses in the mouse suit at Chuck E. Cheese, then yes, he's the head of NIH.

01:51:31.172 --> 01:51:32.638
He's the guy you meet when you come in.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:36.352
He's the guy who gives you your menu and sits you down at the table, but that's it.

01:51:41.129 --> 01:51:48.574
It's, that's actually surprised me that we, when there's a political will to do that, you can actually get past the institutional desire.

01:51:48.694 --> 01:51:50.855
See, he said political will twice now.

01:51:50.935 --> 01:51:57.280
So he's been given a script of talking points that he's supposed to improvise through and he's passed the audition stage.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:02.443
So if, if, if his improvisation is shitty, oh, that's just the way it is.

01:52:02.523 --> 01:52:03.964
I mean, this is the actor you've got.

01:52:05.313 --> 01:52:06.073
not know the answer

01:52:20.899 --> 01:52:22.459
which is a science institution.

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:35.984
And I noticed, I would give a lecture and at the beginning, maybe 25 years ago when I started doing this, at the first couple of seats in the front rows, I could say, oh, those kids have, I could see, you know, I know what spectrum is, you know.

01:52:36.724 --> 01:52:43.326
And as the years went on, the rows started filling up, the next row, the next row, and it got so bad, that institution got so bad.

01:52:43.406 --> 01:52:49.828
He has been lecturing long enough to see the front row of intellectually disabled people increase over time.

01:53:03.146 --> 01:53:06.027
It's just gross the kinds of stories these people will tell.

01:53:06.707 --> 01:53:15.971
It got so prevalent that that institution needed to set up a separate autism department and program for helping them manage whatever stressors or unique issues they had.

01:53:15.991 --> 01:53:19.933
And whatever the answer is, it's almost like, I mean, there's such a range.

01:53:21.033 --> 01:53:24.434
it's likely to be the case that the biology is going to be very different.

01:53:24.514 --> 01:53:26.174
So you're putting your finger on this.

01:53:26.454 --> 01:53:29.375
This may not be, it's not a, people go, it's not a diagnosis.

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:31.175
I thought to myself, it's not, it's a syndrome.

01:53:31.735 --> 01:53:34.056
And as such, yes, there's going to be a lot of different things in there.

01:53:34.096 --> 01:53:35.276
We're going to have to look at that too.

01:53:35.316 --> 01:53:35.856
Tease it apart.

01:53:35.876 --> 01:53:43.858
I think we'll learn a lot more about it and we'll get answers to parents and children of this country who have been desperate for answers for years.

01:53:44.278 --> 01:53:49.161
I'm talking to Jenny McCarthy in a few weeks, and I want to apologize to her, because she's looking for answers.

01:53:49.561 --> 01:53:56.085
And I was a little dismissive, and I thought, God, it's sexist, and it's like, you can't let moms try to come up with some answers here.

01:53:59.466 --> 01:54:00.307
Pretty remarkable.

01:54:01.528 --> 01:54:02.308
That's where we are.

01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:11.313
They still won't really tell you the truth about how criminal it was not to use antibiotics for pneumonia for a couple years, but the data's right there.

01:54:12.509 --> 01:54:16.913
They're never going to tell you that pure oxygen or misuse of ventilation can also lead to pneumonia.

01:54:16.953 --> 01:54:19.976
They might need antibiotics, so if we don't treat it, it'll increase.

01:54:21.377 --> 01:54:21.918
Opioids.

01:54:22.799 --> 01:54:31.087
I mean, our head of NIH and head of HHS is unaware that more young people die of opioids than anything else under 40.

01:54:34.008 --> 01:54:35.348
Do not resuscitate orders.

01:54:35.408 --> 01:54:37.809
This suicide story, I think, is a minimum thing.

01:54:38.349 --> 01:54:40.089
I don't think there were that many suicides.

01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:43.130
I'm sure there were suicides, but they didn't contribute to the loss.

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:49.092
They didn't contribute to hundreds, to thousands of deaths, like opioids did.

01:54:50.012 --> 01:54:52.832
Death certificates can be faked for money, and they definitely did it.

01:54:52.912 --> 01:54:59.074
PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool, but it does create a remnant stream that's ideal

01:55:00.034 --> 01:55:05.019
for a human genome project that needs a never-ending stream of remnants.

01:55:07.221 --> 01:55:21.415
And remember, America is a country that still takes the foreskin of babies for fibroblasts and sells it, and sells cesarean section placentas for a lot more money than they do from regular births.

01:55:24.212 --> 01:55:26.715
Fighting about mandates is slave speak.

01:55:27.436 --> 01:55:33.745
You can't mandate hitting kids in the head and then argue about how many times you can hit them or how early you can hit them.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:38.742
Vaccines are a mythology because intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:55:39.302 --> 01:55:46.405
Autism is a mythology designed to hopefully make people never come to the conclusion that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:55:46.785 --> 01:55:50.186
It's a complex thing of environmental and genetic causes.

01:55:50.667 --> 01:56:01.251
Gain of function is a mythology that wants to hide or is intended to hide the fact that the only thing the Human Genome Project has allowed us to do is make large quantities of pure DNA.

01:56:01.671 --> 01:56:03.012
And we can put that in places.

01:56:03.712 --> 01:56:07.154
When we do, sometimes proteins that aren't supposed to be there will show up.

01:56:07.714 --> 01:56:09.575
Sometimes immune responses will happen.

01:56:09.615 --> 01:56:11.196
Sometimes other changes will happen.

01:56:11.236 --> 01:56:14.318
Sometimes the cells that we put it in will repackage it.

01:56:17.099 --> 01:56:19.501
But that doesn't mean virology is real.

01:56:19.541 --> 01:56:21.682
And it definitely doesn't mean that gain of function is real.

01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:27.385
AI is a mythology that's really just computers and our naivety about what language is.

01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:34.294
Our naivety about how language can be used against us that people have known for generations.

01:56:35.014 --> 01:56:37.516
And AI is just a computer application of that.

01:56:37.616 --> 01:56:40.798
Don't think for a second that AI is about to wake up and take over.

01:56:42.768 --> 01:56:45.049
So we don't want to make poisoning kids a choice.

01:56:45.269 --> 01:56:47.029
We want to fight against poisoning kids.

01:56:47.809 --> 01:56:49.550
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:52.071
We don't need to figure out what part of that is dumb.

01:56:52.371 --> 01:56:54.611
Intramuscular injection of anything is dumb.

01:56:55.491 --> 01:56:56.892
Autism complicates that.

01:56:57.512 --> 01:57:03.474
Make sure that you don't ever come to that conclusion by asking whether it was the heavy metals or the adjuvants or the conjugated proteins.

01:57:03.934 --> 01:57:08.355
And again, virology is just applications using synthetic DNA, which is the only thing

01:57:08.875 --> 01:57:10.957
that the Human Genome Project has really given us.

01:57:11.377 --> 01:57:16.541
And finally, language is an enchantment, so don't read language that you don't want to read.

01:57:17.101 --> 01:57:21.224
Don't scroll on social media reading language that you shouldn't be reading.

01:57:21.705 --> 01:57:22.505
Pick a book.

01:57:23.046 --> 01:57:26.748
Choose the language you read, because then you're choosing the thoughts that you think.

01:57:27.309 --> 01:57:30.411
Ladies and gentlemen, please remember this is for all the children of Earth.

01:57:30.431 --> 01:57:31.652
This is for the grandchildren.

01:57:31.692 --> 01:57:33.373
Specifically, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:57:33.754 --> 01:57:35.155
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:57:35.195 --> 01:57:36.776
Transfecting healthy people is a crime.

01:57:37.156 --> 01:57:40.278
and the population pyramid is a problem that they have been managing.

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:41.539
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:42.901
See you again tomorrow.

01:57:43.821 --> 01:57:44.902
Streak alive.

01:57:46.383 --> 01:57:47.204
Not gonna break.

01:57:50.266 --> 01:57:55.851
Bethel Park Schools calling me again because the school got, school got canceled today because, uh,

01:57:57.952 --> 01:58:01.797
because we had too many trees down yesterday from the thing.

01:58:01.837 --> 01:58:05.842
Don't forget we're learning about the background and that's how we're going to dispel the myth.

01:58:07.083 --> 01:58:11.329
I hope everybody is aware we're doing the Pattern Integrity, a pie with a tat.

01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.951
What is it?

01:58:13.531 --> 01:58:14.993
It is a place where

01:58:15.774 --> 01:58:18.957
There is an interface between composition and decomposition.

01:58:18.997 --> 01:58:25.303
It is a place where hypersymbiosis exists, where there are endosymbionts and ectosymbionts and they communicate.

01:58:25.804 --> 01:58:29.708
And that is what a life as a pie with a tat means.

01:58:29.788 --> 01:58:40.038
You can figure this out also by thinking about the fact that there are no diseases blamed on bacteriophages, but bacteriophages can are free to pass most if not all barriers in your body.

01:58:40.638 --> 01:58:55.323
mitochondria, our endosymbionts that they might be communicating with, and more importantly, our antibodies and payers patches might be ways of selecting and promoting certain bacteria in our gut and working together with them.

01:58:55.783 --> 01:59:01.985
All of this magic world was probably known by Joshua Lederberg, tried his best to leave it behind.

01:59:02.565 --> 01:59:09.527
Make sure you know mitochondria, endosymbionts, you can find that idea originally from Lynn Margulis, look that up.

01:59:09.967 --> 01:59:14.690
And payers patches versus rhizophagy is the subject of the next couple of days.

01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.071
Hopefully I'll get the slides done.

01:59:16.091 --> 01:59:17.892
This is a hard subject to push.

01:59:17.972 --> 01:59:22.274
So forgive me if I do it less perfectly in the next couple of days.

01:59:22.314 --> 01:59:23.075
Thanks for being here.

01:59:23.095 --> 01:59:26.897
I hope you're enjoying the biology coaching.

01:59:27.497 --> 01:59:30.419
Life is a pattern integrity of the trajectory across time.

01:59:30.879 --> 01:59:31.519
Thanks for being here.

01:59:31.579 --> 01:59:32.240
See you again tomorrow.
