00:08.578 --> 00:08.978
The end

00:59.577 --> 01:00.437
Let me introduce

01:21.823 --> 01:40.325
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:41.466 --> 01:51.569
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

01:51.829 --> 01:57.951
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

01:57.991 --> 02:03.073
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management.

02:03.113 --> 02:05.053
He was one of the co-founders of

02:07.754 --> 02:12.056
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flattery as well.

02:12.136 --> 02:17.978
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody in flattery as well.

02:20.338 --> 02:24.460
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:26.240 --> 02:26.941
And I have lied.

02:26.961 --> 02:28.021
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.802
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

02:30.922 --> 02:31.942
I try not to be a liar.

02:31.962 --> 02:32.823
I don't want to be a liar.

02:33.383 --> 02:36.104
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.093
We want everybody to feel good.

04:10.113 --> 04:12.193
That's not the way life is.

04:12.333 --> 04:20.275
I don't care how you get there.

04:20.295 --> 04:22.955
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:22.975 --> 04:29.536
The goal is to win.

04:30.397 --> 04:31.317
What time is it?

04:31.377 --> 04:32.137
Game time!

04:37.990 --> 04:39.711
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

04:40.051 --> 04:41.951
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

04:41.991 --> 04:45.493
It is eight after noon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:45.513 --> 04:49.574
Coming to you live from the back of my garage, this is Jonathan Cooley of GigaOM Biological.

04:50.274 --> 04:55.776
I am your chief biologist, urging you to get you and your family, your children off of social media.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.458
This is the only non-compliance that matters.

05:00.938 --> 05:01.979
Welcome to the show, ladies.

05:02.079 --> 05:02.439
Oh, sorry, sorry.

05:02.539 --> 05:02.939
Sorry, Brian.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.600
I didn't mean to yell at Brian.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.293
condition that we will not call autism.

05:22.413 --> 05:23.755
I don't like the word autism.

05:23.895 --> 05:27.560
Thank you very much 2013 Brian for saying it so clearly.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.883
That was Brian Hooker from 2013.

05:30.444 --> 05:36.251
Luckily the internet allows time travel so that we can see when some of these people were not actually scripted actors.

05:37.352 --> 05:50.477
that we're creating a myth about autism spectrum disorder that's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology to make sure that virology is never questioned as a science and public health is never questioned as a reason.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.679
And they've actually done the same thing with pandemics and data function.

05:55.119 --> 05:59.841
They've gotten us running in the directions they want us to run and none of those directions are useful.

05:59.901 --> 06:05.223
Although it seems like we're about to escape, it's all an illusion because it's all social media.

06:05.703 --> 06:10.467
And our acquiescence to social media is what's going to destroy us, enslave us.

06:11.367 --> 06:19.053
Mice die in traps because they do not understand why the cheese is free and you've got to figure out why the cheese is free on social media, ladies and gentlemen.

06:19.614 --> 06:20.314
Figure it out.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.955
We've got to figure it out.

06:22.376 --> 06:23.276
We've got to figure it out.

06:23.396 --> 06:23.877
I agree.

06:23.997 --> 06:24.617
Digital ID.

06:25.478 --> 06:27.900
definitely matters, but listen carefully.

06:28.321 --> 06:36.368
If you're not on the social media platforms that will first be required to have digital ID, you're never going to need digital ID for PeerTube.

06:36.989 --> 06:44.296
So the trick is to realize that if you want to watch YouTube, eventually you're going to need to enter your name and your address and your

06:44.796 --> 06:51.741
and your social security number and give up your ID and make sure it's you because if you make bad comments, we want to be able to trace them back to you.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.502
That's how that works.

06:54.082 --> 07:04.409
So actually resisting the social media is the trick, because if you don't care about social media, then you won't care if social media requires a digital ID.

07:04.449 --> 07:08.232
That's the way they're going to get you on board, even with Substack, ladies and gentlemen.

07:08.772 --> 07:13.255
And once you know the truth, once you can see it for really what it is, it will set you free.

07:13.275 --> 07:14.416
You won't be angry anymore.

07:15.096 --> 07:16.437
You won't be sad anymore.

07:16.457 --> 07:23.262
You won't feel hopeless anymore because you realize that social media is not an accurate representation of reality.

07:23.282 --> 07:24.163
It is a theater.

07:24.623 --> 07:28.306
And if you get mad about what's on stage, then that's your own fault.

07:28.846 --> 07:29.807
You can't get mad.

07:29.827 --> 07:31.448
Are we going to be talking about excrement today?

07:32.089 --> 07:37.233
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours who are rolling the excrement offstage.

07:37.673 --> 07:38.473
Oh, nice.

07:38.754 --> 07:40.175
Are we going to be talking about excrement today?

07:40.859 --> 07:46.003
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours who are rolling the excrement offstage.

07:46.363 --> 07:49.785
It is extremely important to understand that I think I'm right.

07:49.865 --> 07:52.207
I'm ready to be corrected, though, Mr. Delusion.

07:53.308 --> 07:58.411
I could be wrong about the way that digital IDs will be enforced, but I really believe it.

07:59.152 --> 08:01.634
I believe that one of the ways that they're going to do it... You know what?

08:01.674 --> 08:02.134
Hold on a minute.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.315
I'm just going to address this right now.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.799
I really think it's important to see it.

08:07.939 --> 08:13.100
One of the ways that they could potentially get us all to beg for digital IDs, because that's the trick.

08:13.140 --> 08:20.722
They got to get us to beg for it, just like they got to get us to fight about whether it's important for you to wear a mask because it's for everybody else, man.

08:21.242 --> 08:28.203
And they need you to get to fight about the idea that my kids aren't safe on the Internet because of these anonymous people, man.

08:28.623 --> 08:31.604
These anonymous kids on the Internet can harass my kid.

08:32.509 --> 08:37.054
These anonymous adults, these pedophiles that are registered under funny names.

08:37.354 --> 08:38.996
We got to get rid of all these people.

08:39.817 --> 08:43.521
All these racist accounts that are advocating for violence.

08:43.862 --> 08:46.064
We can't have any more of these bots anymore.

08:47.466 --> 08:50.008
And so what they're actually doing on Twitter,

08:51.109 --> 09:11.776
with the militarization of social media and the false amplification of these scripted actors, they are also creating a situation where eventually they can flip the tables and say, hey, the only reason why the Trump administration was successful is because they had a whole bunch of bots and a whole bunch of actors on social media.

09:12.396 --> 09:19.963
And those actors on social media were fake amplified and we thought they were rising because they said smart things and people agreed with them.

09:20.383 --> 09:29.010
But it's not, it's because Elon Musk and his little team of programmers programmed Steve Bannon's operators to rise in social media.

09:29.931 --> 09:35.756
And so in order to protect ourselves from that ever happening again, we're gonna need some digital ID on the internet.

09:39.016 --> 09:47.604
Imagine a bunch of parents in front of Congress saying that my daughter committed suicide because a bunch of anonymous people were harassing her on the internet.

09:48.365 --> 09:49.105
Stop lying!

09:49.746 --> 09:59.835
Imagine a group of parents online because kids got in trouble somehow or committed a crime somehow because of social media.

10:00.516 --> 10:00.816
Stop

10:02.052 --> 10:17.604
You can imagine any number of scenarios that they can create where then they'll televise it just like Bret Weinstein in 2019 or 18 had to be in front of Congress to tell everybody how dangerous it was that these woke kids were able to ruin his career.

10:20.686 --> 10:26.270
If you do not understand why the cheese is free, you will never escape the trap.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.392
And the cheese is free on social media.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.176
And so they're doing something to you.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.378
They're using it against you.

10:34.538 --> 10:36.580
Otherwise, the cheese wouldn't be free.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.543
And it's not just because they sell ads.

10:42.644 --> 10:44.346
It has nothing to do with ads.

10:45.286 --> 10:52.232
The reason why social media is free is because it is a crucial part of the way we are governed.

10:54.198 --> 11:05.427
It is the military aspect of the pandemic that Sasha Latupova is out there and scripted to make sure that you never connect to the military.

11:08.269 --> 11:19.138
The illusion of a lab leak or a natural virus, the illusion of a toxic spike protein designed by a Chinese lab is the DOD COVID operation.

11:22.219 --> 11:28.544
The transfections are not the DOD, those are DOE, that's Department of Energy and the Human Genome Project.

11:28.584 --> 11:30.085
Believe it or not, that's the way it is.

11:32.266 --> 11:40.872
But the narrative control and the attention control during the pandemic, 100% positive was DOD.

11:42.353 --> 11:49.919
And that means that Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, CHD, ICANN, Sasha Latupova, her daughter Soph, Alex Jones, they're all

11:51.943 --> 11:52.523
D.O.D.

11:54.284 --> 11:59.226
And that's why it's very safe for all these people to be very imprecise about it's the D.O.D.

12:00.367 --> 12:03.408
And we got to end the Prep Act emergency or something.

12:05.089 --> 12:17.854
Because they are actually the puppets that we're supposed to watch on social media and come to some conclusion that at least some people are out there fighting, tweeting against the empire.

12:19.315 --> 12:19.755
Dang it.

12:22.827 --> 12:23.447
Hey, what's that?

12:23.528 --> 12:24.468
Did I have to stop that?

12:24.548 --> 12:25.569
Oh, no, not that one.

12:25.609 --> 12:25.909
This one.

12:27.590 --> 12:28.251
There we go.

12:30.172 --> 12:32.554
So you got to show your children the truth.

12:32.594 --> 12:34.856
You got to show your children the truth, ladies and gentlemen.

12:37.037 --> 12:44.863
We will be able to persuade other people to see the truth and to see the light, because that's what we stand for.

12:45.683 --> 12:48.485
and the truth should prevail at all costs.

12:49.245 --> 12:53.408
And the sacrifices we continue to make to get the truth out there will continue.

12:53.428 --> 12:55.570
And so I would encourage people, wake up.

12:56.771 --> 13:00.653
The truth is the most sensational thing that you could ever report.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.115
It's always going to be what people want to hear.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.737
We must continue to speak our truth.

13:09.199 --> 13:11.361
You know they eat babies.

13:11.461 --> 13:13.102
That is not bullshit.

13:13.993 --> 13:29.340
So please make sure you're clear and understanding that I really believe that Roseanne Barr talking about eating babies is on exactly the same level as... And everybody still thinks I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy.

13:29.580 --> 13:42.907
It's just exactly the same part of fifth generation warfare that Jessica Rose with five degrees is the same fifth generation warfare that has all kinds of people and advisors behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:43.487 --> 13:51.071
It's the same fifth generation warfare that gave us Donald Trump and Trump derangement syndrome.

13:52.970 --> 14:16.042
It was by design, fifth generation warfare split America in half using Donald Trump and Biden and Obama and racism and George Floyd and Pierre Corey's testimony in the George Floyd case and Robert Malone's career and Paul Offit's career in order to get us to accept the status of experimental animal for our children.

14:16.102 --> 14:17.023
That's the way it is.

14:18.106 --> 14:23.932
And these people, they don't need to know as much as we've surmised.

14:24.092 --> 14:29.257
They just need to know that they're on that team and that their job is to read the script.

14:29.637 --> 14:35.183
Please, ladies and gentlemen, understand that this Trump derangement syndrome and the idea that

14:35.583 --> 14:42.189
Maybe it's Peter Thiel, the Antichrist, or maybe Elon Musk really is a smart guy trying to save us.

14:42.509 --> 14:52.158
There might be nuclear weapons on the way, and Epstein is a real guy who controlled real people by bringing them to an island and then blackmailing them for the rest of their lives.

14:53.274 --> 14:58.016
I mean, all of these things are things that are perceived to be true.

14:58.136 --> 15:05.300
And you can rest assured that because this is a military operation and social media is a military weapon, none of them are true.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.401
It's an illusion.

15:09.542 --> 15:18.427
It's not to say that Peter Thiel or Elon Musk don't have a lot of money, but neither of them is the mastermind super genius that they are portrayed to be.

15:19.554 --> 15:26.378
just like Brett Weinstein is not, just like Joe Rogan is not, or Steve Bannon is not, or Donald Trump is not.

15:28.960 --> 15:33.303
We have to come to terms with the fact that we are run by a two-party theater.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.504
It is completely false.

15:34.524 --> 15:37.846
We haven't had control of elections since probably before Obama.

15:39.110 --> 15:55.453
And even then, we probably didn't have completely fair and objective elections because this two-party theater has been in place since before John F. Kennedy and is responsible for the murder of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, and don't forget Estes Kefauver.

15:57.334 --> 16:03.755
And so election fraud is not an issue, but we are driven on one side to care about it, on the other side to believe it's okay.

16:04.784 --> 16:11.050
And just like anything else, election fraud, pandemics, gay marriage, it's all been used to slice us in half.

16:11.110 --> 16:15.715
The trouble is the knife doesn't cut in the same place at the same time all the time.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.078
And the end result is, is that our loaf of bread is shredded.

16:20.820 --> 16:29.368
Our social fabric is shredded and it's all done on the basis of using people that are in clear view, but have no idea what they're talking about.

16:30.711 --> 16:52.687
The best way to characterize this is to think about social media and television as more like a Star Trek set where people read the script that they are given and the only reason why it's so effective and confusing is because the script is about things in the real world instead of Vulcans and Romulans.

16:54.349 --> 17:06.235
but the science and the scripting of the science, the geopolitics and the scripting of the geopolitics, the questions that they ask, the arguments that they have, the gotcha moments that occur.

17:07.756 --> 17:12.678
The vast majority of these are scripted because it's a national security priority.

17:13.999 --> 17:19.162
They're not leaving politics and the keys to the nuclear weapons to chance.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.849
And they haven't for a very, very long time.

17:24.950 --> 17:39.716
Ever since they decided that nuclear war was the ultimate power, that DNA was the ultimate answer, that all of these things made it imperative that they take over.

17:40.896 --> 17:47.199
As soon as we were able to drop the atomic bomb and realize, or everybody thought that we could scale it up,

17:48.314 --> 18:11.125
As soon as we discovered DNA and thought we understood that mutation was the mechanism by which evolution had occurred, we thought we were very close to unlocking all the keys of the universe, the keys to ultimate destruction, the keys to ultimate wisdom, and ultimate power over ourselves and our environment.

18:12.318 --> 18:20.421
And so it was around that time when these people, this technocracy decided, you know what, we've got to take this to the next level.

18:20.461 --> 18:25.704
And that's what you can hear in that man and his future conference.

18:25.744 --> 18:29.825
That's what you can hear happening in the 50s and early 60s.

18:31.766 --> 18:40.830
Around the same time that these physicists are attempting to cross over into biology and find the last remaining laws of reality.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.851
they have not yet been able to find.

18:45.952 --> 19:01.027
And so the worst part is in clear view there are need-to-know basis scripted actors who are now trying to absorb little pieces of the new biology that I am teaching and writing down as we speak.

19:02.088 --> 19:11.155
including trying to point out, as if they are the first people to say it, that the human genome was never actually sequenced when it was announced to be sequenced.

19:11.256 --> 19:14.798
And then, again, the next time they announced it, it wasn't yet done.

19:15.159 --> 19:17.260
And the next time they announced it, it wasn't yet done.

19:17.841 --> 19:23.345
And even today, there are very few, if any, examples of a full human genome sequence.

19:24.566 --> 19:29.831
There are always large percentages missing, large error rates.

19:31.886 --> 19:37.831
and huge amounts of uncertainty and irrepeatability.

19:37.871 --> 19:40.654
You can't sequence a human twice and get the same answer.

19:44.178 --> 20:03.346
What will happen now is certain need-to-know basis scripted actors will pretend to be coming out and trying to object to some aspect of virology or some aspect of PCR, but never actually get to the point where they're going to object wholeheartedly to the idea that evolution is real because we found DNA.

20:05.742 --> 20:08.523
They'll skirt around it by saying DNA isn't real.

20:08.943 --> 20:10.644
Or sorry, yeah, DNA isn't real.

20:11.144 --> 20:14.005
They'll skirt around it by saying that evolution didn't happen.

20:14.565 --> 20:34.073
But they won't explicitly tell you that the only reason why all of these people suddenly pivoted to accept evolution as fact is because there was this little brief period of time where it seemed like a prediction about physics and chemistry being the underpinnings of life

20:35.256 --> 20:45.059
And then the discovery of DNA seemed at that time to indicate that it might actually be that just physics and chemistry are enough to understand what life is.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.841
And that we would soon unravel that problem.

20:52.922 --> 20:59.604
And as we've peeled back the layers of this complexity, of course, there were people all along that understood this.

20:59.644 --> 21:01.205
Hilary Kaprowski probably did.

21:02.445 --> 21:04.066
Joshua Lederberg probably did.

21:05.871 --> 21:26.426
And these huge thinkers that have been mentors for a great number of people and praised as mentors by a great number of people, nonetheless, their fundamental ideas and the huge contributions that they made to identifying the irreducible complexity of life, they are just wholeheartedly discarded.

21:26.486 --> 21:33.631
And Hilary Koprowski is celebrated as a vaccine, like savior or a vaccine pioneer.

21:35.194 --> 21:40.096
And Lederberg is praised as a bioweapons and AI guy.

21:43.417 --> 21:45.877
And so it's remarkable, ladies and gentlemen, where we are.

21:45.917 --> 21:54.520
We are in a very scary place, but it is our children that we need to save because our children just need to be shown what social media is.

21:57.469 --> 22:00.194
They just need to be shown what social media is.

22:01.175 --> 22:08.988
And then it should be relatively easy to get them out, relatively easy for them to fight their way out and understand why they need to build their own.

22:10.120 --> 22:27.416
Once our teenagers and college kids start building their own soapbox instances, you know, even university student groups could start their own university soapbox instance that is maintained by a student government and have their own that's connected to all the big 10 schools.

22:27.456 --> 22:29.277
You know, it could be like that easily.

22:29.297 --> 22:36.404
And PeerTube instances could be set up by, you know, relatively savvy high school kids.

22:37.639 --> 23:05.334
This is not super rocket science, you know, and once we get good at it ourselves, I really think that GigaOM Biological as a, instead of an LLC, but as a nonprofit, we'll be seeking to do that for people like Housatonic Live for Mark Kulak, for Joe Marshall, and maybe even for Dan Cohen, people that are really doing their best to contribute something to plant trees under whose shade they will not shelter.

23:06.643 --> 23:20.191
You know, I want I want to work with people who are working for the future of our our kids and so That's that's where my mind is and I think again without Wanting to beat a dead horse.

23:20.251 --> 23:29.376
I really think it's important to understand these people as if they are Star Trek actors and that's why they are so committed to the script and

23:30.069 --> 23:36.651
And when they are scripted to say that the Vulcans are attacking the Romulans, they just say it with a lot of conviction.

23:38.472 --> 23:40.832
And it doesn't, you know, it doesn't matter.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.673
All they have to do is agree that that's Captain Kirk.

23:45.494 --> 23:48.375
All they have to do is turn around and say, wow, man, you're great.

23:49.515 --> 23:56.077
And now it's very hard for anybody that's following them to realize that Captain Kirk is also just an actor on stage.

23:58.550 --> 24:05.794
And that's what they've done with Robert Malone, with Steve Kirsch, with Jessica Rose, with all of these people.

24:05.834 --> 24:12.818
And so John Bodwin could be an innocent participant that's fooled by all the people around him, and he thinks that this set is real.

24:14.459 --> 24:23.665
Because Kevin McKernan is sitting over there being the science officer, and Steve Kirsch is sitting in the captain's seat talking his shit, and Jessica Rose is over there with her earpiece in.

24:26.038 --> 24:28.601
And so it's very hard for John Bodwin to see out.

24:29.122 --> 24:39.555
And there are lots of other people like John Bodwin that I think are just trapped because they are surrounded by these other people being usefully integrated into this script.

24:40.700 --> 24:50.592
And I would have been one of these people on stage, I imagine, if I'd have done things better than I did, if I'd have followed my orders or done what I was told, but most likely not.

24:50.672 --> 24:54.456
Most likely they would have never given me a chair on stage.

24:54.897 --> 24:59.402
They would have always just made me feel like I was contributing to the script that these actors read.

25:00.043 --> 25:03.745
And that is the real trick of social media.

25:03.765 --> 25:13.012
When you start to believe as an audience member that something that you're doing on social media is contributing to what's happening in the sitcom you're watching.

25:13.612 --> 25:22.758
Can you imagine sitting at home and watching Star Trek The Next Generation and thinking that the reason why a character did what they did is because of something that you tweeted?

25:24.977 --> 25:34.045
Can you imagine sitting and watching Outlander and thinking that one of the characters on Outlander is doing something because of something that you posted on Facebook?

25:35.266 --> 25:49.398
Because that is the exact same thing as you thinking that these people in the Maha movement are doing things because of stuff that we tweet or stuff that we have forced them to do.

25:51.749 --> 25:53.931
We've got to break free of that.

25:54.592 --> 25:56.453
We've got to break our children free of that.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.695
And the only way to do it is to break free ourselves.

26:02.399 --> 26:04.140
I hope that analogy is clear.

26:05.391 --> 26:06.291
I hope that makes sense.

26:06.331 --> 26:18.014
Maybe I should use the Star Trek thing or Star Wars instead of Star Trek, but make sure you understand you gotta download the PeerTube app and you gotta input the URL stream.gigaohm.bio.

26:18.914 --> 26:29.676
I think actually yesterday, a fair number of you actually did because we had the highest number of views in a single day on my PeerTube ever yesterday.

26:30.316 --> 26:32.578
So congratulations for downloading the app.

26:32.618 --> 26:34.599
If you have any problems, please send me an email.

26:34.639 --> 26:35.479
I'd be happy to help you.

26:35.519 --> 26:38.061
I'm going to make a video and send it out to everybody on email.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.343
I think this is the game changer.

26:41.884 --> 26:46.567
Now that this app is working so well with our website, this is just the game changer.

26:46.627 --> 26:58.074
Because again, remember, if you're worried about it, any other app that you would download from the App Store, Google Play is going to ask you to enter in an email and then get an email and click on a confirmation link.

26:58.594 --> 27:03.355
and maybe even enter in some other data, this app will ask for none of it.

27:03.495 --> 27:06.456
This app is also available on GitHub.

27:06.476 --> 27:09.317
So if you want to, you can see the whole dang code.

27:09.717 --> 27:13.918
The same thing is true for the website and the program that runs the website.

27:14.518 --> 27:27.621
So please understand that although you are sharing chunks of the video as you stream and some of the peers that are closer to you are gonna be sharing those chunks as well, it's possible, there's no data.

27:30.700 --> 27:37.622
And it is a very well-researched, well-documented, you know, on Reddit and GitHub and elsewhere.

27:37.662 --> 27:38.863
You can find it.

27:39.003 --> 27:39.843
It's the real deal.

27:40.603 --> 27:48.966
And anybody that was really trying to break free of corporate social media in any form would be advocating for this.

27:51.307 --> 27:58.069
And for soapbox instances, honestly, like Truth Social or Blue Sky or GigaOM.bio.

27:59.554 --> 28:03.616
So stream.gigaohm.bio is where the PeerTube instance is.

28:03.956 --> 28:11.819
And it is the URL that you need to enter into the PeerTube app in order to have it on your phone.

28:11.879 --> 28:13.539
So watch, I can show you right now.

28:13.719 --> 28:14.520
It's not open.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.801
I'm gonna open the PeerTube app right here.

28:17.821 --> 28:22.603
And it says it's live.

28:22.663 --> 28:23.343
No, that's not it.

28:24.143 --> 28:25.324
Sorry, I already had it open.

28:25.364 --> 28:26.304
That's why it didn't work.

28:26.364 --> 28:26.784
So let me see.

28:26.804 --> 28:28.585
I'll close it and then I'll open it again.

28:30.148 --> 28:31.368
And there we are live.

28:31.408 --> 28:33.389
So if I click on that, you'll see me right away.

28:33.409 --> 28:35.570
Have it on your phone.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.130
So watch, I can show you right now.

28:37.190 --> 28:38.251
It's not open.

28:39.531 --> 28:41.012
I'm going to open the PeerTube app.

28:41.412 --> 28:42.472
That's pretty impressive.

28:42.732 --> 28:47.814
And that works flawlessly for me and for lots and lots of other people.

28:47.874 --> 28:49.535
So you don't need to have Twitch.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.436
You don't need to use YouTube.

28:51.476 --> 28:52.536
And so here's the point.

28:54.033 --> 29:07.299
If they start requiring you to use digital ID to watch Twitch because there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of chicks in swimming pools that are playing dirty video games, PeerTube doesn't.

29:07.759 --> 29:09.800
PeerTube will never ask you to log in.

29:11.761 --> 29:12.241
Do you see?

29:13.461 --> 29:21.825
Because we're not providing anything except for my free speech to you, there's nothing to regulate.

29:23.424 --> 29:34.688
because I am providing the platform that is for my, it's like me using a megaphone versus me going to, I don't know, the Rosemont Horizon and being able to get on stage.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.789
See, if I use a megaphone on the street, they can't stop me.

29:38.829 --> 29:45.432
If you want to stand on the same street corner that I am, PeerTube, and watch what I'm doing, you can, and there's nothing to stop you.

29:46.712 --> 29:52.294
And they won't be able to pressure me to screen your name or ask for, that's not how that works.

29:53.234 --> 30:02.580
But they can do that on these large platforms that are selling ads and collecting data because they wanna regulate that, you see.

30:05.943 --> 30:09.845
I hope you can see how this is so much a flying free bird.

30:10.365 --> 30:14.588
This is so much an FU to the system that it's hard to underestimate.

30:15.569 --> 30:17.350
No one else is doing it.

30:18.111 --> 30:21.373
Not even the Colbert Report or Corbett.

30:22.884 --> 30:23.765
Not CHD.

30:23.785 --> 30:28.970
Do you know one of the things that I tried to do at CHD while I was there is advocate for them to make a PeerTube?

30:30.211 --> 30:36.356
So that they could host all of their videos on their own PeerTube site instead of on Rumble and shit.

30:36.917 --> 30:37.738
Do you know that?

30:40.720 --> 30:41.221
Crickets.

30:42.122 --> 30:44.003
They didn't even understand what I was saying.

30:44.023 --> 30:45.505
They didn't want to hear it, nothing.

30:46.522 --> 30:50.365
They don't know because they are scripted not to know.

30:50.425 --> 30:53.548
It's a national security operation we're up against.

30:56.550 --> 31:09.020
And that's why nobody can explain to you this irreducibly complex background of genetic noise on which there's no way it's possible that we would have a novel viral pandemic.

31:09.858 --> 31:24.795
that just happened to be timed with a once in a century or once in a lifetime rise in all cause mortality across the Western world because of the huge families after World War II that we have seen coming since the early 90s.

31:26.536 --> 31:42.061
and that everybody that has risen on the right, in the populist conservative right, was put in place to make sure that this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality would never be noticed, and that all of these deaths would be attributed to a novel virus.

31:42.121 --> 31:44.282
The timing was perfect.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.923
You can see it here in Denny Rancourt's own graphs.

31:47.779 --> 31:51.982
It's harder to see it in my graph because my graph doesn't have all these extra years in it.

31:52.362 --> 31:54.284
My graph actually starts right there.

31:55.024 --> 32:01.008
And so it's a little hard to see the rise, but you can definitely see the rise if you look back a couple decades.

32:01.849 --> 32:07.333
And this anticipated rise in all cause mortality is that right there.

32:08.053 --> 32:10.835
This thing, I'm gonna go back to it and let it play again.

32:10.875 --> 32:11.756
This thing right here.

32:12.978 --> 32:13.979
that's now moving up.

32:14.119 --> 32:17.063
This is the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

32:17.103 --> 32:22.348
And when it got to 2020, you can see what happened.

32:23.990 --> 32:29.717
And they put Denny Rancourt in place to obfuscate the fact that we knew this was coming.

32:31.328 --> 32:40.336
He actually said in an interview with me and Jason Levine that he had no idea about population pyramids and whether there was an anticipated rise or not.

32:40.816 --> 32:43.559
He had no figuring in of opioid deaths.

32:43.579 --> 32:44.960
He doesn't really think it matters.

32:46.121 --> 32:48.423
And he doesn't know how any of these people died.

32:51.434 --> 33:08.300
And of course, because the COVID narrative wants you to attribute cardiac effects to the spike protein, even an anticipated rise in stroke and heart attacks, because there are more old people now, could be attributed to the novel virus, and it was.

33:12.381 --> 33:15.482
And that's why Denny Rancor was... It's just a rubbish.

33:16.923 --> 33:17.303
It's junk.

33:19.793 --> 33:28.198
Community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap, trying to screen their employees and their nursing homes.

33:28.998 --> 33:41.486
Now remember what I'm trying to show you here is that there's no reason for any of these Americans and South Africans and Canadians to have gone to Bucharest, Romania to try and save people from the pandemic.

33:42.381 --> 33:53.643
There's just no explanation for why Steven Hatfill, who's now one of the chief science officers at ASPR, would have met those people there and been side-by-side with Nick Hudson.

33:54.263 --> 34:00.464
You know, the Pandata guy from South Africa that asked me to present three times and then lost those videos.

34:04.105 --> 34:08.446
Like Jason Kristoff, who's been around the world with Merrill Nash and, uh,

34:09.591 --> 34:11.292
and Robert Malone all the way to Japan.

34:11.312 --> 34:15.534
Here's Jessica Rose, who was on stage in the video that we're about to watch.

34:15.614 --> 34:16.055
Remember?

34:16.835 --> 34:23.719
In Scotland in 2023, where Robert Malone didn't talk about the mRNA at all, but they're making a whole movie now like he did.

34:23.739 --> 34:30.522
And then we have Jill Glasspool Malone, Robert Malone, two of the worst and fakest Americans in America.

34:30.542 --> 34:31.543
There's Meryl Nass.

34:32.564 --> 34:34.905
And Bret Weinstein went halfway around the world.

34:36.052 --> 34:42.714
The guy who can't eat bread, except for in Europe, decided to go to Romania to have breakfast at the hotel with Steve Hatfield.

34:45.475 --> 35:03.941
Who, of course, in 2020 was telling us that we had to wear an apron when we took care of sick kids, and that sick kids should use a different shitter, and that kids should be trained or desensitized to wearing masks by having Barney wear a mask.

35:04.221 --> 35:05.241
All Steve Hatfield.

35:06.365 --> 35:13.150
And also one of the first guests that Steve Bannon had on when he shifted his war room to the pandemic war room in 2020.

35:18.013 --> 35:22.996
Trump derangement syndrome was designed and created by fifth generation warfare.

35:26.158 --> 35:30.201
For something that's not going to turn positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

35:33.072 --> 35:40.238
I said, dude, you need these capture antigen things, where you're not looking for antibodies, you're actually looking for the virus.

35:41.579 --> 35:42.540
So they're expensive.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.542
I won't let that play.

35:45.803 --> 35:53.669
I will just make sure that you understand that there's no way none of these people understand that there is a list which rules out a novel virus.

35:53.689 --> 35:55.471
There's a list of manslaughter.

35:56.638 --> 36:14.260
ventilators, supplementary oxygen, opioid deaths, remdesivir, midazolam, also the incredible lack of use of antibiotics, even for something like urinary tract infection, all resulted in more of those old people dying quickly instead of using six months of Medicare on the way out.

36:17.907 --> 36:25.789
One of the most egregious places and examples of this was in Scotland, and that is documented in that sub stack that I'm always advertising for in my introduction.

36:26.509 --> 36:30.150
In Scotland, they just murdered old people, just murdered them alone.

36:30.170 --> 36:41.713
I don't know if I told you already or not, but download the gigaohm, sorry, download the PeerTube app, put in the gigaohm URL and get at it.

36:44.761 --> 36:47.102
Dr. Steven Hadfield joins us.

36:47.222 --> 36:48.142
Honored to have him on.

36:48.622 --> 36:55.164
When we first shifted the show to warm pandemic, he was our first, he was our first guest, but we only had him for like a week or 10 days.

36:55.244 --> 37:00.886
And he went over to the white house to work with Dr. Pierre Navarro and others during the darkest days of the pandemic.

37:02.007 --> 37:08.609
So, sir, um, walk us through because you're, you're taking incoming from all over.

37:08.629 --> 37:10.169
This is from five days ago.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.910
I should have put the, the, the,

37:12.734 --> 37:37.663
the date there i apologize about getting rid of this amazing new technology what was it i and i know there's a now remember we've covered a video where kim iverson is talking about getting rid of the technology um you know that mary holland has been on jimmy door and has been on redacted talking about getting rid of the technology and brett weinstein is talking about getting rid of the technology his friend is rolling the

37:38.203 --> 37:39.364
excrement off stage.

37:39.404 --> 37:43.565
And now we have a sort of a reunion of sorts after six years.

37:44.085 --> 37:49.948
The first guest of the Pandemic War Room in 2020 in January is Steve Hatfill.

37:49.968 --> 37:55.110
And now he's here to tell us why getting rid of the mRNA is so amazing.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.112
thousand reports out there, everything like that.

37:57.532 --> 37:59.834
But you're a data guy and a science guy.

38:00.134 --> 38:10.683
Walk us through what led to the decision of finally getting, you know, stopping the underwriting of American taxpayer for this experimental gene therapy, sir.

38:12.565 --> 38:13.206
Hi, Stephen.

38:13.386 --> 38:14.567
Good to see you once again.

38:16.188 --> 38:22.374
What happened is that the data had accumulated to the point where meta-analysis studies could be done.

38:23.900 --> 38:26.642
These are very comprehensive analysis.

38:26.842 --> 38:28.663
Now, of course, what's the implication here?

38:28.683 --> 38:30.064
Let's just start out with the basics.

38:30.124 --> 38:32.966
The idea is we had no idea how many people would get hurt.

38:33.907 --> 38:36.188
You know, it could have worked even better than it did.

38:36.288 --> 38:38.290
It could have worked flawlessly for all we knew.

38:39.331 --> 38:40.371
And that's not correct.

38:40.531 --> 38:44.274
We know that transfection would have been inappropriate for any healthy human.

38:45.484 --> 38:50.228
but we wouldn't have been able to get the data that we now have had we not transfected all of these people.

38:50.769 --> 38:58.656
I do think that they used a lot of placebo in order to make it very unclear whether or not transfection was really hurting people or not.

38:58.696 --> 39:05.502
But anybody that got a live dose, and certainly anybody that got two, is most likely permanently damaged in some way or another.

39:05.542 --> 39:10.926
Maybe as yet undetected, but I am very pessimistic for anybody that got this

39:12.203 --> 39:15.285
transfection in any reasonable dosage more than once.

39:16.385 --> 39:22.548
And anyone before the pandemic, including myself, that understood that these were transfections would have been equally afraid.

39:23.208 --> 39:33.333
And in fact, that's why I think Sukharbhakti was so pressured in Germany a couple years ago, because he was one of the few people who could explain that so well.

39:34.293 --> 39:39.916
And he explained it in a way that precluded the spike protein having to be particularly toxic.

39:40.868 --> 39:49.770
because it is the immune attack on the cells expressing a foreign protein, which produces the potential for autoimmunity.

39:50.510 --> 40:04.773
And more importantly, if you express that spike protein in the same places again, or new places again, and the immune system has learned to attack that protein, then the attack the second time will be much more

40:06.721 --> 40:12.824
potentially dangerous than the first time because the immune system will have been prepared and primed.

40:13.465 --> 40:20.709
And so the allergic reaction, the clotting reaction, whatever actually happens could happen much worse in the second live exposure.

40:20.969 --> 40:33.536
This is all cartoon back of the napkin stuff that people like Sukrit Bhakti were doing very early in the pandemic based on his knowledge of complement and basic

40:35.217 --> 40:39.140
sort of clotting mechanisms, not about the spike protein.

40:39.160 --> 40:57.031
And so that's, again, where this whole narrative is going to have the water muddied even more because everybody from as diverse of backgrounds as Peter McCullough and Stephen Hatfield are going to tell you that it's a particular quality of the spike protein, rather than a general

41:00.373 --> 41:06.775
side effect of a non-specific, non-targeted transfection of human cells.

41:08.435 --> 41:11.236
I guess that's my best swing at that one.

41:12.496 --> 41:26.039
And it virtually came back consistently that there was no benefit to risk ratio for taking a messenger RNA vaccine.

41:27.340 --> 41:27.720
In fact,

41:29.306 --> 41:37.112
It was more dangerous to take a vaccine than it was to contract COVID-19 and be hospitalized with it.

41:39.974 --> 41:44.297
We're now in 2022 that the status started to come out.

41:45.478 --> 41:50.141
The side effects for this essentially gene therapy

41:52.168 --> 41:54.009
was so enormous.

41:54.109 --> 41:55.531
So you can hear the script, right?

41:55.571 --> 41:57.832
Because Mary Holland calls it a gene therapy.

41:58.052 --> 42:00.354
And Paul Offit calls it a gene therapy.

42:00.554 --> 42:04.237
And Jessica Rose with her five degrees calls it gene therapy.

42:04.857 --> 42:09.801
And they all call it gene therapy that's never been tried on people before.

42:09.841 --> 42:11.282
And that's just bullshit.

42:11.302 --> 42:15.305
And more importantly, it's been used in mice and monkeys for decades.

42:15.345 --> 42:17.707
And we know exactly its limitations there.

42:19.148 --> 42:20.089
It's improgressive.

42:21.394 --> 42:22.775
it was difficult to fathom.

42:24.056 --> 42:32.342
And then finally, a few months ago, some of the detailed biochemistry studies started to appear in the literature.

42:33.983 --> 42:46.052
And this sudden flood of messenger RNA, it appears irrespective of what the messenger RNA insert is coding for.

42:47.513 --> 42:49.775
Just the sheer amount of

42:51.119 --> 42:58.685
number of millions of molecules of messenger RNA entering the cell is creating biochemical havoc.

43:01.427 --> 43:04.049
It's disrupting protein metabolism.

43:04.229 --> 43:07.712
It's interfering with tumor suppressor genes.

43:09.093 --> 43:13.176
It's just completely damaging the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell.

43:15.605 --> 43:16.805
So that's part of it, right?

43:16.885 --> 43:27.833
The damaging of the mitochondria could actually be real, but it could be the LNP itself and the toxicity of the LNP, because remember, the LNP is only stabilized by its chemical

43:29.304 --> 43:30.985
the chemical preparation itself.

43:31.045 --> 43:41.609
And once the pH changes, once it's inside of your body, the composition of the LNP can change, the charge ratios, the way that what charges are exposed, etc.

43:42.369 --> 43:50.032
And so I do think that there's a lot of reason to believe that the lipid nanoparticle itself is doing a lot of damage independent of whatever the RNA does.

43:50.712 --> 44:05.381
And it is in their best interest to make sure that all of those things get mixed up and combined and never usefully sorted out like we expect this from this and we expected that from that, because that would be, you know, that would be honesty.

44:08.263 --> 44:10.024
It's it had to be stopped.

44:11.344 --> 44:11.564
And.

44:13.586 --> 44:13.926
The.

44:15.767 --> 44:18.168
Should should Operation Warp Speed been done?

44:18.208 --> 44:18.889
Yes, of course.

44:20.609 --> 44:21.429
It had to be done.

44:23.070 --> 44:31.093
But it was always understood at the end of 2020 that this would be followed very, very, very carefully.

44:32.593 --> 44:37.035
And it would be halted at the first sign of any strange adverse events.

44:38.499 --> 44:41.401
And we had those strange adverse events very shortly.

44:41.501 --> 44:50.765
This guy was using this exact same voice to say that you should put on a rubber apron when you visit your two-year-old kid and let your two-year-old kid have a separate shitter.

44:50.785 --> 44:53.727
I mean, it's remarkable.

44:55.448 --> 44:56.808
This is just a monster.

44:58.669 --> 45:01.811
I can have pity for some people, but this one, he's a killer.

45:03.083 --> 45:10.609
This is a national security, deep state actor who may even be responsible for Bruce Ivins' death.

45:11.629 --> 45:14.912
Major veins in the brain clotting.

45:16.413 --> 45:18.074
And a brief pause was given.

45:18.134 --> 45:22.698
It was one of the adenovirus messenger RNA vaccines, but it

45:24.611 --> 45:25.812
It was restarted again.

45:26.773 --> 45:28.954
Eventually, I think we gave ours to Canada.

45:29.755 --> 45:30.615
It was unsafe.

45:31.416 --> 45:40.782
And then we started seeing the same things with the Moderna and the Pfizer preparations, messenger RNA vaccines, and the brain clotting.

45:42.283 --> 45:43.965
And a brief pause was given.

45:44.025 --> 45:47.807
It was one of the adenovirus messenger RNA vaccines.

45:48.288 --> 45:51.310
Adenovirus messenger RNA vaccines.

45:54.369 --> 45:54.950
What in the hell?

45:55.010 --> 45:55.810
Why didn't that work?

45:56.051 --> 45:56.711
Gosh, darn it.

45:58.133 --> 45:58.893
Hugh Demon.

46:00.195 --> 46:01.476
Yeah, but that should have been a buzzer.

46:01.536 --> 46:02.577
Like, what are we talking about?

46:02.957 --> 46:05.339
Adenovirus mRNA vaccines?

46:05.480 --> 46:06.300
Are you serious?

46:07.001 --> 46:11.065
Are we seriously there at this stage with this level of shitheadery?

46:11.946 --> 46:15.789
This level of poor scripting, like poor improvisation?

46:16.550 --> 46:17.331
That's scary.

46:18.635 --> 46:22.916
I mean, listen to that again, listen to that again, because that's scary.

46:22.996 --> 46:27.177
I mean, nobody that watches this stream would ever make that mistake.

46:28.737 --> 46:33.958
Nobody that watches this stream would ever make that mistake.

46:34.598 --> 46:37.359
This would be followed very, very, very carefully.

46:38.819 --> 46:43.280
And it would be halted at the first sign of any strange adverse events.

46:44.744 --> 46:52.128
And we had those strange adverse events very shortly, major veins in the brain clotting.

46:53.629 --> 46:55.310
And a brief pause was given.

46:55.370 --> 46:59.152
It was one of the adenovirus messenger RNA vaccines.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.014
It was restarted again.

47:03.034 --> 47:06.196
Eventually I think we gave ours to Canada.

47:06.976 --> 47:08.837
It was- What a bunch of bullshit.

47:08.957 --> 47:10.398
It wasn't restarted again.

47:10.478 --> 47:14.220
Johnson and Johnson was stopped around the world as was AstraZeneca.

47:18.311 --> 47:20.031
These people are getting sloppy.

47:21.032 --> 47:22.652
And you know why they're getting sloppy?

47:22.712 --> 47:25.253
Because it's, this is by design.

47:25.453 --> 47:35.175
The conservative right, the populist right in America is about to be humiliated by all the frauds that they supported.

47:36.675 --> 47:37.975
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:38.096 --> 47:39.976
is going to be our humiliation.

47:41.713 --> 47:48.939
The discrediting of Steve Bannon and this clown and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:49.139 --> 47:55.505
and Donald Trump are gonna be the downfall of the populist Christian right in America.

47:58.207 --> 48:06.294
The discrediting of Russell Brand is the destruction or the discrediting of the Christian right in America.

48:06.354 --> 48:08.216
Believe it or not, that's what's happening.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.001
You don't see it like that.

48:11.282 --> 48:13.663
I didn't see it like that, but I do now.

48:15.585 --> 48:26.233
Because if you go and listen and watch on the other side, you will see people who are absolutely certain and were already certain that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:26.273 --> 48:27.634
was just a scripted fraud.

48:28.075 --> 48:29.296
They don't need to be told.

48:29.796 --> 48:33.579
They were already sure that Donald Trump was a scripted fraud.

48:33.619 --> 48:34.780
They don't need to be told.

48:36.274 --> 48:50.359
But what they do need to be told is that what we were victimized by, what we fell victim to on Twitter and on Facebook and on all these places was a military operation.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.380
We're not dumb.

48:54.761 --> 49:02.805
We are vulnerable to the largest, most complete psychological operation ever executed on planet earth.

49:02.965 --> 49:08.748
And it was aimed at the people with skepticism and it was aimed at the people with faith.

49:08.868 --> 49:13.970
That's the reason why we are victims of Donald Trump, because he was aimed at us.

49:16.271 --> 49:22.194
Not because we are vulnerable to stupid things and stupid stories, but because he was aimed at us.

49:23.649 --> 49:28.493
With 50 or 60 years of advertising excellence, he was aimed at us.

49:29.834 --> 49:37.940
And with layers and layers of scripted actors and fifth generation programming of social media,

49:40.017 --> 49:41.057
He was aimed at us.

49:42.338 --> 49:48.421
And Steve Bannon and Jessica Rose and all these people are aimed at us.

49:49.301 --> 49:51.222
Laura Loomer was aimed at you.

49:52.102 --> 49:53.643
Soph was aimed at you.

49:54.303 --> 49:56.865
Frickin' Alex Jones was aimed at us.

49:58.525 --> 50:02.687
When we were following Bill Cooper, Alex Jones was aimed at us.

50:02.747 --> 50:06.389
When we were following Mike Rupert, Alex Jones was aimed at us.

50:10.925 --> 50:14.546
We can pull ourselves out of this, ladies and gentlemen.

50:14.586 --> 50:16.366
We just have to understand what happened.

50:16.646 --> 50:19.567
We have to take responsibility for what we fell for.

50:21.047 --> 50:29.969
And we have to start seeking understanding from the people who we would have, a year ago, defended Trump and RFK to.

50:32.709 --> 50:39.911
We've got to pull our heads out right now or the conservative right in America will be destroyed, effectively discredited for a generation.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.439
and we don't wanna be discredited to our children.

50:45.961 --> 50:46.441
And safe.

50:47.241 --> 50:52.524
And then we started seeing the same things with the Moderna and the Pfizer preparations.

50:54.065 --> 51:05.111
It turns out that the manufacturers did not do due diligence to ensure these were safe products before they were released onto the American market.

51:06.512 --> 51:07.212
And throughout 2021,

51:10.634 --> 51:16.336
to 2024, the drug companies essentially ran the pandemic response.

51:16.556 --> 51:17.877
Nobody stood up to them.

51:18.577 --> 51:19.778
Nobody questioned them.

51:21.718 --> 51:31.222
So on the conservative right in America, we have Steven Hadfield saying it was the pharmaceutical companies and nobody questioned them as they push the pandemic.

51:31.942 --> 51:37.024
And we have Sasha Latipova saying it was the DOD and nobody questioned them as they push the pandemic.

51:39.997 --> 51:45.120
And we will not escape because neither of these stories is even remotely related to the truth.

51:47.262 --> 51:53.466
No more related to the truth than the natural virus is related to the truth.

51:53.546 --> 52:06.274
The only thing that is related to the truth is that Peter Daszak and Li Min Yan and Tony Fauci and Paul Offit are all part of the same acting club.

52:08.959 --> 52:11.181
That's the only thing that I know.

52:12.461 --> 52:24.189
I know that we are being governed by scripted actors and everyone we've been chasing and all the villains we've been hunting and all the mysteries we've been solving are just part of this stage show.

52:26.011 --> 52:29.633
Even when we thought we were changing what was happening on stage, we weren't.

52:32.255 --> 52:33.656
Those were scripted responses.

52:35.177 --> 52:37.779
Judicial Watch, America's first legal,

52:38.772 --> 52:40.693
were able to obtain some documents.

52:42.474 --> 52:44.555
They didn't want to release it, Pfizer.

52:44.655 --> 52:59.283
They wanted a 70 year moratorium on the clinical data from the trials, which from the start showed these never prevented infection, never prevented disease transmission.

52:59.303 --> 53:01.985
I mean, can you see how this is an actor?

53:02.045 --> 53:03.766
This is not a serious man.

53:05.049 --> 53:09.571
This is not a serious guy trying to do a seriously patriotic thing.

53:11.412 --> 53:12.432
This is gross.

53:14.493 --> 53:16.734
I have pity for him because it's so bad.

53:20.456 --> 53:26.578
And there's no good clinical data to ever show it reduced the severity of disease.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.140
The CDC in response,

53:31.912 --> 53:38.855
I don't know what's wrong with that once fine agency, but they become a supplicant of big pharma.

53:40.115 --> 53:46.258
They put out a paper saying, yes, we've saved like 14 million lives, the vaccination program.

53:47.819 --> 53:55.302
No, the paper's been torn to shreds by epidemiologists.

53:56.405 --> 54:05.470
It was based against a computer model and against an idea where you have the peak and it comes down, and then it goes back up again.

54:07.471 --> 54:18.057
The vaccines have injured hundreds of thousands, and we're not really sure how many have been killed by it, but a significant amount.

54:20.819 --> 54:22.119
They had to come off the market.

54:22.139 --> 54:22.920
There was no choice.

54:24.198 --> 54:27.039
you want to make America healthy again, it had to be stopped.

54:28.359 --> 54:31.641
And the lack of- They're not stopped.

54:32.801 --> 54:39.923
The only thing they're doing is stopping the development of future versions of flu or COVID mRNA.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.144
They're not stopped.

54:42.844 --> 54:45.945
The current mRNA still exists and is available.

54:47.026 --> 54:49.827
My kids could have got a COVID shot two days ago.

54:49.847 --> 54:51.267
What is he talking about?

54:51.948 --> 54:52.948
This is bullshit.

54:55.043 --> 55:08.513
regulatory supervision over the previous four years, from 2021 to the end of 2024, the drug companies were, everybody was jumping in to make a dollar.

55:09.834 --> 55:15.939
And the spike protein itself that they were using for COVID-19 is a toxin.

55:17.700 --> 55:19.282
It's a poisonous molecule.

55:19.942 --> 55:20.943
It was killing people.

55:22.930 --> 55:26.631
And they'd gone too far now to go back and admit a mistake.

55:27.332 --> 55:31.433
Nobody would stand up until Secretary Kennedy.

55:31.853 --> 55:36.975
Dr. Hadfield, this is why this announcement came out the other day, and I was like, this is earth shattering.

55:37.015 --> 55:38.116
It was just kind of put out.

55:38.876 --> 55:43.798
And now with you and others, we're starting to get some backup to it, how important this is monumental.

55:44.418 --> 55:48.240
But I want to go to the years 21, 22, because it's not about

55:49.079 --> 55:50.820
Warp Speed are trying to put this together.

55:51.541 --> 55:59.726
It is about the pharmaceutical industry in 21, 22, and even later, in the medical profession, in the colleges, in all of this.

55:59.766 --> 56:12.776
I mean, now, because of things like the Pfizer papers, and this is a bunch of citizens going through these documents and just seeing all this stuff, and now you- The Pfizer papers were thousands of hours of human time wasted on reading

56:13.576 --> 56:40.818
supposedly paperwork that Pfizer submitted and Naomi Wolf, super clown, coordinated the reading of and now travels the world saying that she's responsible for revealing the truth with regard to wasting all those people's time reading all those stupid documents that wouldn't have been necessary if we would have just said that they were transfections and old technology being renamed and nobody needs them.

56:42.619 --> 56:51.363
but these people instead were focused on a gain-of-function spike protein with fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts, and so everybody was scared shitless.

56:54.825 --> 56:59.928
You got all these peer-reviewed journal articles coming out.

57:00.128 --> 57:10.673
I'm sorry, but this man wearing two working shirts with a shitty, greasy hair and three pens in his shirt is a fraud.

57:12.608 --> 57:16.374
This is a costume, and that makes this man an asshole.

57:18.879 --> 57:23.827
It is a costume that is designed to make him appear as though he's an everyman, and he's not.

57:23.907 --> 57:26.151
He's a former Goldman Sachs executive.

57:29.326 --> 57:34.290
I am absolutely sure that this is one of the shittiest and most fraudulent Americans alive.

57:34.350 --> 57:42.176
And I'm sure that he is also, but he is a more integral part of the national security state.

57:42.236 --> 57:51.623
And therefore probably from a legal and moral perspective feels a little bit better about what he's doing.

57:51.663 --> 57:54.946
Whereas this guy just knows he lies for a living and you know, whatever.

57:55.816 --> 57:56.617
Maybe they're the same.

57:56.777 --> 57:57.138
I don't know.

57:57.198 --> 57:59.680
It's just really frustrating because they're not real people.

58:00.742 --> 58:12.655
We are watching the set of the Star Trek Enterprise and we are listening to the communications officer interview some shithead that we picked up off a freighter.

58:14.923 --> 58:15.764
studies coming out.

58:16.564 --> 58:20.827
But the pharmaceutical industry knew this, the Moderna and Pfizer knew this.

58:21.628 --> 58:31.955
And worse than them knowing it, the universities and the doctors, the entire system that we've built up with taxpayer money to make sure people are educated, make sure these are the finest institutions in the world.

58:32.415 --> 58:34.036
This was David and Goliath.

58:34.156 --> 58:40.721
And now that we got Bobby Kennedy, David and Goliath, you mean like how Brett Weinstein has been saying it, that we're fighting Goliath?

58:44.091 --> 58:45.511
The universities knew?

58:46.392 --> 58:47.072
What did they know?

58:47.092 --> 58:53.013
That they were going to be able to test all of their students mandatorily every week and get all kinds of genetic data?

58:54.113 --> 58:54.754
What did they know?

58:54.774 --> 58:59.115
That they would be able to sell those remnants to the highest bidder?

58:59.155 --> 58:59.835
What did they know?

58:59.855 --> 59:07.137
That PCR was just on an irreducibly complex background so probably meant shit?

59:07.677 --> 59:08.597
What did they know?

59:12.665 --> 59:17.848
It's just ridiculous right now to think that this is somebody that anybody in America takes seriously.

59:19.829 --> 59:25.633
We need to save the people who are taking these people seriously because these are fraudulent Americans.

59:25.693 --> 59:29.455
They are the worst type of Americans because they're pretending not to be frauds.

59:30.376 --> 59:32.397
They're insisting they're the only real people.

59:34.679 --> 59:42.583
and some, you know, Jay Bakhtar and people like you at HHS, you know, reasonable people that look at science and understand science is never settled.

59:42.643 --> 59:44.924
Science goes forward every day.

59:45.845 --> 59:50.387
But the what we had to fight against is so monumental and it's not out of the system.

59:51.287 --> 59:52.848
This is why we're back in this effort.

59:52.968 --> 59:57.711
It's going to get more into next week about banning all by all pharmaceutical ads from television.

59:58.867 --> 01:00:23.384
This is propaganda and these companies got to be held responsible They knew because we've got to save our TV time and we've got to save our commercial breaks from you know pharmaceutical commercials because you know I would rather use my commercial breaks to shop for sporting equipment or decide what beer I like instead of having to frickin decide whether I need a drug or not and

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:30.232
Who gives a living shit if they advertise on network TV?

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:32.993
Who's sitting around between advertisement?

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:35.274
Who even watches television anymore?

01:00:37.776 --> 01:00:45.459
Who would watch television at all if my PeerTube and a few other PeerTubes were just available?

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.300
Why would you need to?

01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:52.700
what they were doing.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:58.384
If you look at all the studies you're talking about and you look at the Pfizer papers you go through, this was not lost on them.

01:00:58.424 --> 01:01:00.185
So how should people have faith?

01:01:00.646 --> 01:01:05.269
How could the basic citizen in this country today understand the monumental decision?

01:01:05.389 --> 01:01:07.831
Because the 500 million is just a, that's just a tip.

01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:19.160
You're just shutting down these studies, but it's a deeper issue you're talking about and that the pharmaceutical industry work for their own purposes, their own profits, their own benefits and bald face lied to people, sir.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.245
Unfortunately, everything you've just said is true.

01:01:25.205 --> 01:01:26.145
We've got a problem.

01:01:27.866 --> 01:01:29.306
There's a new sheriff in town.

01:01:30.047 --> 01:01:31.847
There's several new sheriffs in town.

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:34.648
You have President Trump.

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:39.949
You have Mr. Knox at ASPR.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.050
And you have Secretary Kennedy.

01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:48.392
The days of Big Pharma

01:01:50.826 --> 01:01:51.107
are.

01:01:53.449 --> 01:01:53.609
Yeah.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:56.352
Sorry, I had to allow that comment.

01:01:56.372 --> 01:01:57.152
I don't know what you said.

01:01:57.393 --> 01:01:59.755
Actually killing the American population are over.

01:02:00.255 --> 01:02:02.718
This is all about make America healthy again.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.140
And I want to add something.

01:02:06.241 --> 01:02:07.803
Nobody is anti backs here.

01:02:09.705 --> 01:02:12.908
I've done vaccination campaigns in Africa years ago.

01:02:16.007 --> 01:02:26.255
What we're dealing with are experimental genetic products that were used as vaccines using the code for us.

01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:27.416
What does that mean?

01:02:27.696 --> 01:02:29.177
Used as vaccines.

01:02:29.898 --> 01:02:31.279
Do you see the problem there?

01:02:31.799 --> 01:02:33.741
Do you see why this is breaking now?

01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:41.347
What does it mean to be used as vaccines injected intramuscularly injected without care?

01:02:42.455 --> 01:02:46.998
Just because, assumed to work, what is used as vaccines?

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:48.599
What does that mean?

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.542
Do you see why that's a monumental mistake?

01:02:55.186 --> 01:02:58.468
novel gene therapies used as vaccines.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:04.013
If this guy were to stop him and saying, doctor, what do you mean by used as vaccines?

01:03:04.454 --> 01:03:07.977
Can I use a Philly cheese steak as a vaccine?

01:03:08.477 --> 01:03:11.059
Could I use my water bottle as a vaccine?

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.722
Could I use my phone as a vaccine?

01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:15.763
What in the fuck do you mean?

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:18.325
Use as a vaccine.

01:03:18.425 --> 01:03:18.665
Wow.

01:03:18.705 --> 01:03:20.106
I just said the F word, didn't I?

01:03:20.186 --> 01:03:20.546
Darn it.

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:21.627
I was doing really well.

01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:23.768
I'm sorry, but I, it's really frustrating.

01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:26.850
What in the world does that question mean?

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:33.034
Potentially a protein poison.

01:03:33.954 --> 01:03:35.675
I'll make America healthy again.

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:37.836
Yeah.

01:03:38.477 --> 01:03:40.838
Actually killing the American population are over.

01:03:41.338 --> 01:03:45.861
This is all about make America healthy again.

01:03:46.798 --> 01:03:48.339
And I want to add something.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.001
Nobody is anti-vax here.

01:03:53.223 --> 01:03:56.166
I've done vaccination campaigns in Africa years ago.

01:03:59.228 --> 01:04:02.291
What we're dealing with are experimental genetic products.

01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:12.339
It's very likely that Meryl Nass met Steve Hatfill all those years ago in Rhodesia during this vaccination campaign.

01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:17.196
That's why they have been so closely related for so long.

01:04:17.236 --> 01:04:35.851
And that's why when Robert Malone and Steven Hatfield were on the Tommy podcast together and talking and Robert Malone brought up Meryl Ness, Steven Hatfield said, Oh, I hate her because he wants people to make sure that he knows we never worked together.

01:04:35.891 --> 01:04:37.633
I don't know who that is, but she's a shithead.

01:04:40.202 --> 01:04:45.686
That was how close they came to stepping on each other's proverbiable things.

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:48.589
That's how close they've come.

01:04:48.749 --> 01:04:55.975
Just the same reason why maybe Stephen Hadfield went on Tommy's podcast and said that Robert Malone didn't have a Vax card when they went to Rome.

01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:01.239
Because they're getting very close to blowing their cover.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.104
That they've all known each other for a couple decades, all the way back from when they met in Rhodesia.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.780
All the way back with Ebola, remember that shit?

01:05:13.641 --> 01:05:18.342
And the anthrax stuff, and the anthrax after 9-11, et cetera, et cetera.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:21.002
This is very dark, ladies and gentlemen, it's very dark.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:26.243
Yes, this was the original accused leaker of the anthrax after 9-11.

01:05:26.303 --> 01:05:30.984
This guy is a deep state player of the highest order.

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:35.945
Used as vaccines.

01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:52.269
using the code for essentially a protein poison that has... Again, implying that if they hadn't chosen the spike protein, that it would have been much better.

01:05:53.249 --> 01:06:05.994
Hadn't chosen the spike protein with the fear and cleavage site and the HIV inserts and the staphylococcus enterotoxin B homology and all this other shit, then it would have been fine.

01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:12.238
Never mind the N1 methyl pseudo uridine never gets mentioned.

01:06:12.279 --> 01:06:14.481
Never mind that the LNP never gets mentioned.

01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:15.542
It's just remarkable.

01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:18.985
Devastated families.

01:06:21.087 --> 01:06:24.010
Then you brought it down to

01:06:26.881 --> 01:06:31.225
inoculate children who were really at no risk for COVID-19.

01:06:32.006 --> 01:06:33.648
No risk for COVID-19?

01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:41.095
You told parents that they needed to treat their kids with a rubber apron and they needed a separate shitter so the kids weren't going to die.

01:06:41.115 --> 01:06:42.777
But boy, were they sure deadly, huh?

01:06:44.539 --> 01:06:46.281
Holy man, what a monster.

01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:52.045
And then you have top people considered to be top epidemiologists.

01:06:52.445 --> 01:06:59.109
Michael Osterholm was on NPR this morning saying how wonderful and safe the vaccines were.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:09.115
What's interesting is that actually Michael Osterholm was actually on Joe Rogan in 2020 to tell everybody for sure this couldn't be a lab leak.

01:07:09.155 --> 01:07:10.076
That's ridiculous.

01:07:13.442 --> 01:07:21.369
setting me up to think, wow, but that's ridiculous because I just did a bike ride explaining why it might be a lab leak.

01:07:21.869 --> 01:07:26.052
So I did a bike ride saying, holy cow, somebody lied to Joe Rogan.

01:07:27.814 --> 01:07:36.080
Because in 2020, I thought Joe Rogan was just a podcaster who was so good at his job and had so many followers that Spotify decided to give him $100 million a year.

01:07:42.571 --> 01:07:50.174
Because at the start of the pandemic, I thought social media was just kind of this thing, you know, that was like a public thing that like spontaneously did stuff.

01:07:52.255 --> 01:07:56.396
I never imagined that it was just layers and layers of a military trap.

01:07:58.517 --> 01:08:11.302
I never imagined that I was watching a stage performance on a layered stage performance that I could never have any effect on, but was actually scripted to make it appear as though I had an effect on it.

01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:19.364
And that organizations like CHD had been doing that to parents for quite a few years already.

01:08:25.289 --> 01:08:29.372
I'm still pretty humbled by how long it took me to see this.

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:35.998
And so I'm always going to remain humble as I try to help you and your family see it.

01:08:38.612 --> 01:08:44.917
But there will never be any truth with a million subscribers on YouTube.

01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:49.581
There will never be any truth with a million followers on Twitter.

01:08:50.903 --> 01:08:57.188
But there might be some truth on PeerTube with 100 followers or with 400 followers or with 1,000 followers or with 98 subscribers.

01:09:02.352 --> 01:09:13.928
And that truth could grow without any stopping, without any ability to be stopped if it grew here, rather than on YouTube or Twitter or wherever else people try to grow.

01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:29.000
The only real growth that can be achieved is that federated, non-centralized, funded-on-your-own internet, like PeerTube, Soapbox, etc.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.602
And your own website, if that's what you want to do.

01:09:31.642 --> 01:09:33.704
And use Vimeo to host your videos.

01:09:33.724 --> 01:09:34.585
That also works.

01:09:35.746 --> 01:09:36.487
Embed everything.

01:09:36.527 --> 01:09:37.768
You can do all of those things.

01:09:37.788 --> 01:09:39.669
You can release your stuff on PDF.

01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:42.272
You don't need to use Substack.

01:09:47.128 --> 01:09:49.977
You gotta realize why the cheese is free, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:51.842 --> 01:09:52.985
You can't fix stupid.

01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:57.839
It's beyond the grass.

01:09:57.859 --> 01:10:00.501
But hang on, but hang on, but hang on, but hang on, but hang on, hang on.

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:01.041
Ho, ho, ho.

01:10:01.081 --> 01:10:03.262
But this is my, you can't fix stupid.

01:10:03.903 --> 01:10:04.844
And this is my problem.

01:10:04.904 --> 01:10:06.565
I've got a problem with the way you guys roll it out.

01:10:06.585 --> 01:10:09.367
And I've been very clear with this top guys over at HHS.

01:10:09.927 --> 01:10:17.253
This is so monumental and so important, and it's not going to be won by Steve Bannon yelling to a microphone or Dr. Hadfield coming on here.

01:10:17.773 --> 01:10:20.435
This is about the data and this is about the facts.

01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:35.351
and this is why this audience took years of their lives to get into those Pfizer documents under this audience worked with Naomi Wolf to get into those Pfizer document stop lying wow that is ridiculous Naomi Wolf and start putting information out this

01:10:36.352 --> 01:10:40.235
We have to now is incumbent upon HHS.

01:10:40.515 --> 01:10:47.940
It's incumbent upon Bobby Kennedy and all the great deputies he has, including yourself, to come forward and let's put it out.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.780
So we refute them.

01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:52.643
I said at the time when I saw that press release, they're they're now on.

01:10:52.663 --> 01:10:53.524
They're an NPR.

01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:56.125
They're on MSNBC, the same cast of characters.

01:10:56.486 --> 01:11:01.249
These demons that were out there in twenty one and twenty two are back in your life.

01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:02.229
Okay.

01:11:02.349 --> 01:11:02.490
Yeah.

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:14.639
Because if we're going to stop it, it's only going to get stopped when we take the science and we take the data and we rub their nose in about what they did, what they knew when they knew it.

01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:17.221
And what was the problem here?

01:11:17.261 --> 01:11:27.308
The main problem is, is that they're suggesting that we should rub the, the deaths and injuries of Americans into the face of the left.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:28.389
Cause they did it.

01:11:30.805 --> 01:11:50.243
But anybody that was on the internet talking about a lab leak and a gain-of-function spike protein and amyloidosis and cardiac effects from a spike protein like Jessica Rose was, is responsible for people not being able to make informed choices about what should have been called transfection from the very beginning.

01:11:51.303 --> 01:12:08.932
Anybody that was out there wearing a bandana and woodshop goggles and insisting that people not go visit their grandparents in December of 2020, like Brett Weinstein did, is responsible for a lot of people making the wrong choice about this shot, about these injections.

01:12:10.513 --> 01:12:19.798
And so it is not ironic, it is absolutely malevolent that these same people are now purporting to be the people who said they always got it right.

01:12:21.093 --> 01:12:27.936
I didn't get it right completely, but I definitely told everybody it's not a shot for everyone.

01:12:30.277 --> 01:12:34.118
But I, at the time in 2020, still said that maybe it'll help my parents.

01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:36.359
It's possible.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:50.705
And that doubt, that kernel of doubt, that window, that little crack of sunlight is all that was necessary for people to make the choice that everybody on TV was urging them to make.

01:12:51.809 --> 01:13:11.292
And if the only alternative voices were Pierre Cory complaining about supplementary oxygen in the hospitals, if the only other voices were somebody like Kyle Seidel, if the only other voices were the American doctors, then it's very easy to see why lots of people made the wrong choice.

01:13:11.352 --> 01:13:19.434
And for these malevolent actors to pretend as though they did anything like I did,

01:13:20.282 --> 01:13:33.261
stand up in front of a faculty meeting and say that this is transfection you people are idiots what are you doing we need to speak out and then got fired there is no other story like that in america it sucks but there isn't

01:13:34.565 --> 01:13:41.169
There is no other medical school faculty member in America that stood up and said, these are transfections.

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:43.170
We're not going to use these on our old people.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.752
We use this technology all the time in our mice and monkeys.

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:51.094
There isn't one single faculty member on earth.

01:13:54.677 --> 01:13:56.077
And I'm not happy about that.

01:13:56.117 --> 01:13:58.299
I think it sucks that I'm the only

01:13:59.443 --> 01:14:13.410
medical school faculty member on earth that stood up and said these were transfections, who stood up and said that this PCR test can't possibly be pulling a signal from background.

01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:16.652
And so they are exaggerating.

01:14:16.692 --> 01:14:18.573
They are telling us a story here.

01:14:19.313 --> 01:14:26.597
There is no other medical school faculty member in the entire world who can claim that.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:34.101
There's also no other medical school faculty member in the world fired during COVID.

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:37.564
Well, not fired, but told to go home because they're afraid.

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:41.767
And then they quietly paid out my contract, ruining my 20 year career.

01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:50.574
Quite a bit different than what happened to Brett Weinstein in 2017, when he made a deal with Evergreen University for a half a million fricking dollars.

01:14:54.317 --> 01:14:57.920
I have a Nobel prize winning postdoc

01:14:59.306 --> 01:15:12.274
Apprenticeship On my resume and I don't tell anybody I have three postdoctoral degrees One of which was awarded a Nobel Prize in part.

01:15:12.314 --> 01:15:24.582
I don't say any shit like that Like Jessica Rose says she has five postdoctoral degrees, but she has five post-secondary degrees not postdoctoral She says post-secondary

01:15:25.336 --> 01:15:30.399
but they're really just postdocs with different labs that had different specialties.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.443
And every time she did a postdoc in a lab, she considers that specialty a degree.

01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:43.968
So I guess I could say that I have a post-secondary degree in neuropsychiatry.

01:15:43.988 --> 01:15:55.276
I have a post-secondary degree in computational modeling, and I have a post-secondary degree in neuroanatomy, as well as a PhD in neurobiology.

01:15:55.933 --> 01:15:57.494
Boy, I'm pretty badass, ain't I?

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:09.779
That's not how an academic CV and an academic career works, and for sure not for somebody like Jessica Rose, who, according to everything that I can find out, was never even trying to become faculty.

01:16:10.119 --> 01:16:13.601
She was just kind of touring the world, wasting people's grant money on her.

01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:18.722
And she always just did kind of a little computational thing for whatever she was doing.

01:16:18.762 --> 01:16:22.864
So even if she worked for a molecular biologist, she didn't do molecular biology.

01:16:22.904 --> 01:16:29.546
She just contributed some computational modeling to the molecular biology paper and then called herself a molecular biologist.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.706
Do you see what we're dealing with here?

01:16:32.526 --> 01:16:37.228
And Jessica Rose is as tied to these people as their own pubic hair.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:43.110
Sasha Latupova is as tied to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.131
as his wife is.

01:16:47.513 --> 01:16:57.898
Mary Holland and Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy and their collective fraudulent careers are tied to all of us.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:05.783
We might as well be wearing Alex Jones is a genius t-shirts if we're gonna be on their team.

01:17:06.653 --> 01:17:11.515
We might as well be wearing t-shirts that say, Steve Bannon is the man.

01:17:14.956 --> 01:17:18.197
We might as well be wearing Bobby Kennedy 2024 t-shirts.

01:17:18.257 --> 01:17:26.579
That's how stupid we are if we are not absolutely positively absolving ourselves with everything to do with this narrative.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.260
And we must do it quickly.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:32.680
Because this will escalate.

01:17:33.361 --> 01:17:36.666
The mistakes that they are making will compound.

01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:42.875
And at some point in time, they will become responsible for this ridiculousness.

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:46.941
And that will then bring our side to their knees.

01:17:47.887 --> 01:17:48.367
It's coming.

01:17:49.048 --> 01:17:50.108
Consequences of that.

01:17:50.469 --> 01:17:52.470
And so this is not a game of rhetoric.

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.530
This is not a game.

01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.131
This is not a debating society.

01:17:55.411 --> 01:17:58.113
We're not going to out debate them and they're not going to out debate us.

01:17:58.513 --> 01:18:00.634
People understand what the two sides are.

01:18:00.734 --> 01:18:01.935
Now it's back to the facts.

01:18:02.015 --> 01:18:05.397
And finally, the power of Bobby Kennedy at HHS.

01:18:05.497 --> 01:18:13.582
And this is the part of the Trump revolution to make America healthy with MAGA is now we have, as he promised us, platinum level science.

01:18:14.842 --> 01:18:20.783
Platinum level science at HHS just as he promised.

01:18:22.284 --> 01:18:25.044
Peace on Earth just as he promised.

01:18:25.144 --> 01:18:27.985
Getting out of the Middle East just as he promised.

01:18:32.506 --> 01:18:34.006
Tax cuts for the middle class?

01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:35.226
No, he didn't promise that.

01:18:36.387 --> 01:18:38.407
Better education for the kids?

01:18:38.487 --> 01:18:39.407
Didn't promise that.

01:18:40.948 --> 01:18:41.148
Hmm.

01:18:42.988 --> 01:18:43.128
Hmm.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.100
Interesting.

01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:51.003
Sounds like a great big bullshit show to me.

01:18:51.063 --> 01:18:51.443
I don't know.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:52.903
Yes.

01:18:53.264 --> 01:18:55.845
No more being running dogs for big pharma.

01:18:56.145 --> 01:18:59.507
No more being running dogs for profits for big.

01:18:59.607 --> 01:19:05.269
I think that Elon Musk's party will be part of the fracturing of the right because that's what they need to do.

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:11.552
The left is on board with moving forward with the global whatever, whatever.

01:19:11.592 --> 01:19:12.893
They'll accept Bitcoin.

01:19:12.933 --> 01:19:14.274
They'll accept digital ID.

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:14.814
That's fine.

01:19:15.822 --> 01:19:29.135
This operation was aimed at the conservatives, aimed at the people with faith, aimed at the people who already had another set of principles that couldn't be shaken.

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:37.062
And so that's why all this rhetoric about trans also became so aggressive.

01:19:38.891 --> 01:19:45.194
And actually they obviously are overplaying their hand on this because that's, it's part and parcel.

01:19:45.254 --> 01:19:46.334
It's the design.

01:19:46.394 --> 01:19:55.718
It's all aimed at the conservative, self-governing, sovereign thinking, individualistic Americans.

01:19:58.618 --> 01:20:05.921
And so it feels like, because social media tells us this, that it's the Republicans that are, it's the right, it's the whatever.

01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:13.004
No, think of it more as there are two or basically two kinds of people in the world.

01:20:13.404 --> 01:20:17.906
There are people who can see, and there are people can only see what they're shown.

01:20:19.659 --> 01:20:23.061
And the people who see what they're shown are mostly on the left.

01:20:23.521 --> 01:20:26.522
The people who can just plain see are on the right.

01:20:26.962 --> 01:20:33.405
And they actually require a lot more fifth generation warfare to manipulate.

01:20:33.505 --> 01:20:36.847
And they need a lot more fifth generation warfare to break.

01:20:38.988 --> 01:20:41.249
You don't need to break the other side.

01:20:41.389 --> 01:20:43.430
They need to break our side.

01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:48.232
I really think it's as simple as that.

01:20:49.628 --> 01:20:59.655
Trump was aimed at us The people who can see Big pharma, right?

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:02.037
It's now and but to do that that's what i'm saying.

01:21:02.097 --> 01:21:13.545
We ought to just have overwhelmed these people with the studies and how you guys curated the studies and put the data out and this i'm at it and I said i've told people over there the war room platform

01:21:14.205 --> 01:21:16.146
four hours a day, you got it, baby.

01:21:16.506 --> 01:21:18.927
This thing is so big and so important.

01:21:19.528 --> 01:21:21.529
And don't think they're going to roll over.

01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:24.510
These are some of the most profitable institutions in the world.

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:27.191
You think they're going to sit there and they give a damn what Bobby Kennedy says?

01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:28.792
You think they give a damn what Hadfield says?

01:21:28.812 --> 01:21:31.213
You think they give a damn what Bannon and the people say?

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:31.613
They don't.

01:21:31.734 --> 01:21:40.478
I just think it's very useful now to start thinking of people who see what they're told to see and people who just see.

01:21:41.816 --> 01:21:43.277
And that's the difference.

01:21:43.317 --> 01:21:44.478
There is no left and right.

01:21:44.518 --> 01:21:45.619
There's no red and blue.

01:21:45.659 --> 01:21:48.441
There's no conservative and liberal.

01:21:49.622 --> 01:21:54.225
There are people who see what they're shown, and then there are people who see.

01:21:56.527 --> 01:21:59.589
And the people who see, some of them have faith.

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:01.551
Some of them are scholars.

01:22:02.831 --> 01:22:04.152
Some of them are analysts.

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:08.496
Some of them have just been burnt a lot of times in their life.

01:22:09.714 --> 01:22:15.057
Some of them, for whatever reason, understand the danger of coordinated lying.

01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:21.761
You can understand the danger of coordinated lying by having been an insider at the corporate level.

01:22:22.962 --> 01:22:29.146
You can understand the dangers of coordinating lying by having been a high school teacher.

01:22:31.027 --> 01:22:37.431
You can understand the danger of coordinated lying by having been a lot of different things in your adult life.

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:51.694
It doesn't have to be that because you're abused kid or because you were raped or whatever that you finally woke up and realized that there are a lot, there is really degrees of nasty in the world.

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:57.517
So don't, I don't think of it as left and right anymore.

01:22:57.557 --> 01:23:05.560
I think of it as people who are prone to see what they are told to see and then people who work harder than that.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.701
And the people who work harder than that are,

01:23:09.767 --> 01:23:15.989
are descended from or are living in the tradition of the people that first got on the first boats to leave.

01:23:16.509 --> 01:23:23.391
The people that first went to seek their own life in America and pick themselves up and do their own thing.

01:23:24.691 --> 01:23:29.533
Those are the people that already had answers and knew how to find them for themselves.

01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:35.036
And so you don't need to think about it like left and right anymore.

01:23:35.516 --> 01:23:37.937
And it's not condescending to say it.

01:23:37.977 --> 01:23:45.259
It's just to acknowledge that human biology and human psychology has a spectrum.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:55.702
And many people are part of a spectrum of people that basically can't see through what we are now facing.

01:23:57.003 --> 01:23:57.903
It's just too hard.

01:24:04.136 --> 01:24:06.217
And so yes, some of them won't be saved.

01:24:06.277 --> 01:24:07.898
Some of them we won't be able to save.

01:24:07.939 --> 01:24:13.742
But our children, our children can be saved because our children can be shown from the very beginning what it is.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.105
And then it's very easy because you never start with this idea.

01:24:18.145 --> 01:24:25.510
You know that guy that I played before a few times that there are people who grow up learning not to trust and they're fine.

01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:33.235
But the people who grow up not who just trust everybody, those people are in for a very big

01:24:34.272 --> 01:24:38.377
let down with the number of people that are paid to lie.

01:24:38.998 --> 01:24:41.881
You see, that's the trick and how much lying occurs.

01:24:43.343 --> 01:24:50.732
It's very similar to culture shock that can happen sometimes when people go to a country where negotiation is normal.

01:24:52.259 --> 01:25:04.464
and you go to a street market and you wanna buy something and you're kinda surprised at how the transaction goes and maybe it's even a little coarse because you didn't realize that you were insulting the guy by taking his first price.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:09.126
Or you were insulting the guy by not bargaining with him.

01:25:10.567 --> 01:25:12.368
Or by not burping at the table.

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:18.032
These people are actors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:18.272 --> 01:25:24.298
We've got to wake up to that and we've got to teach our children how vulnerable they are to actors on social media.

01:25:25.058 --> 01:25:27.821
They're going to they're going to buy up the said they own the medical schools.

01:25:28.121 --> 01:25:29.602
They own the medical profession.

01:25:30.003 --> 01:25:30.203
Right.

01:25:30.443 --> 01:25:31.764
They've corrupted everything.

01:25:31.824 --> 01:25:35.127
And they're just not going to sit there because to admit their guilt.

01:25:35.808 --> 01:25:52.031
is just not to bring down the apparatus and to actually start to lead America to be healthy again, it's to hold them accountable and responsible for what they did and what they knowingly did to the American people, and particularly to the elderly and the young, right?

01:25:52.871 --> 01:25:55.871
Of which they did and pushed it for more profits, sir.

01:25:57.392 --> 01:25:58.372
Absolutely correct.

01:25:59.312 --> 01:26:00.372
Could you put up that book?

01:26:02.593 --> 01:26:05.093
What happened as a number of us got together?

01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:11.154
And we've took the, there's about 5,000 papers showing the damage.

01:26:11.354 --> 01:26:12.995
No, not that one, another one.

01:26:15.096 --> 01:26:15.857
The Pfizer book?

01:26:16.017 --> 01:26:17.217
Yeah.

01:26:17.277 --> 01:26:20.659
No, the COVID-19 injuries book.

01:26:22.841 --> 01:26:24.282
Oh, let's say the COVID-19 injuries?

01:26:25.262 --> 01:26:26.903
Yeah, I sent it to you.

01:26:26.923 --> 01:26:27.503
What book is that?

01:26:27.684 --> 01:26:28.204
Okay, fine.

01:26:29.324 --> 01:26:29.604
Okay.

01:26:30.044 --> 01:26:34.947
What we did, a number of experts, it was quite a group effort.

01:26:35.008 --> 01:26:35.448
$40 a book.

01:26:35.488 --> 01:26:42.132
And we took out of these 5,000 papers, the 700 most severe vaccine injury.

01:26:42.192 --> 01:26:46.675
Are you telling me that I could publish a book on Amazon and charge $40 a book?

01:26:49.396 --> 01:26:51.998
That's remarkable, $40, wow.

01:26:53.038 --> 01:26:55.220
Peer-reviewed medical papers.

01:26:56.348 --> 01:27:02.832
And we put them all into, subdivided and put it all into this cumulative book and we made it free.

01:27:02.892 --> 01:27:04.313
You can get it off the internet.

01:27:07.395 --> 01:27:11.118
It's called COVID-19 Vaccine Injury.

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:15.381
700 clinical papers.

01:27:17.422 --> 01:27:21.725
And anyone could go on there and read for themselves.

01:27:23.627 --> 01:27:26.488
You see why that's a stupid, complicated solution, right?

01:27:26.528 --> 01:27:47.552
It's just like Sherry Tenpenny telling you that she spent 25 years and 18 hours a day reading about vaccines, trying to learn stuff about vaccines, and she still doesn't have a real clear understanding, still doesn't have a real clear opinion or an elevator pitch about what we should do after 25 years of trying, even though the good Lord told her to do it.

01:27:48.504 --> 01:27:49.264
Stop lying!

01:27:49.925 --> 01:27:51.586
And so this is kind of the same thing.

01:27:51.646 --> 01:28:00.530
It's like, you know, if you want to catch up to Charles Rixey, you're going to have to download his Excel sheet with 4,000 papers and read all those first and then get back to him.

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.594
This is fifth generation warfare, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:07.314
This is bullshit.

01:28:07.974 --> 01:28:09.575
What these vaccines have been doing.

01:28:11.556 --> 01:28:14.638
We have not been able to have a voice anywhere.

01:28:15.478 --> 01:28:16.799
It's all been suppressed.

01:28:17.762 --> 01:28:22.987
You're not going to get on the mainstream media unless you tout the benefits of the vaccines.

01:28:25.068 --> 01:28:26.209
You still hold it.

01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:27.570
But hang on.

01:28:27.731 --> 01:28:27.951
Hang on.

01:28:27.971 --> 01:28:28.351
Hang on.

01:28:28.411 --> 01:28:28.751
Hang on.

01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:29.452
Slow down.

01:28:29.472 --> 01:28:29.852
Slow down.

01:28:29.912 --> 01:28:30.233
Slow down.

01:28:30.253 --> 01:28:30.593
I got you.

01:28:35.115 --> 01:28:40.599
If it's okay, I'm just going to move on to the second video because I do want to try and keep it under like two and a half hours here.

01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:41.399
I'm starting to get hot.

01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:45.883
The next video is actually picking up where we left off yesterday.

01:28:48.165 --> 01:28:50.086
I'll see what the end of that one is like.

01:28:50.807 --> 01:28:53.709
This is the video about mRNA.

01:28:53.769 --> 01:28:54.810
We paused right here.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.171
I'm just going to pick it up right here.

01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.352
We got about 30 minutes left.

01:28:57.472 --> 01:29:02.000
The FDA director is launching a national study into COVID-19 vaccine harms.

01:29:02.501 --> 01:29:07.108
We have not gotten full elucidation of the risks of these mRNA vaccines.

01:29:07.665 --> 01:29:14.787
So the reason why I titled this show, Getting the Band Back Together, number two, is because yesterday it was Getting the Band Back Together.

01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:23.250
And it seemed like what they were doing was representing a conference that took place in January of 2023, as though it took place more recently.

01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:31.132
And that the function of that conference was to tell everybody that the mRNA was a bad idea, when in fact, it was like a fifth generation warfare conference.

01:29:31.812 --> 01:29:41.734
where Sasha Latapova told us it was the DoD and Merrill Nass told us it was the DoD and Robert Malone told us that we would never figure it out.

01:29:46.236 --> 01:29:52.817
And so this is the second half of that video where now I guess they're gonna tell us that the FDA is wrong or something like that.

01:29:53.557 --> 01:29:56.018
And again, that the RNA is, the RNA,

01:29:57.324 --> 01:30:05.426
transfection, that they're not going to call a transfection, keep calling a vaccine was bad, and that these people are the ones who've been speaking out about it from the very beginning, including Robert Malone.

01:30:08.186 --> 01:30:11.587
Hundreds of thousands of people have claimed that they've been vaccine injured.

01:30:11.927 --> 01:30:14.088
I take those concerns very seriously.

01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:23.730
What is inside my arm?

01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.170
What's in my arm?

01:30:26.691 --> 01:30:27.852
What's in my arm, El?

01:30:29.913 --> 01:30:38.058
In this chapter, let's break down the science using 3D visuals to show how the mRNA vaccine works and explore its potential links to clotting and heart damage.

01:30:38.098 --> 01:30:39.859
Let's also use an AI voice.

01:30:47.096 --> 01:30:51.649
But first, let's recognize that messenger RNA isn't just a man-made invention.

01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:55.239
In its natural form, it's a marvel within our bodies.

01:30:57.731 --> 01:31:00.712
Evolution has gifted life with the wonders of genetic coding.

01:31:01.512 --> 01:31:11.354
I decided to start it here to remind you that, again, one of the things that they did in this movie, scripted, is tell everybody that evolution is real because DNA is so magic.

01:31:11.434 --> 01:31:18.356
But then they don't manage to tell you that all the chemical magic of DNA is missing from RNA.

01:31:18.396 --> 01:31:21.696
But I guess RNA can still pandemic, because what the hell, you know?

01:31:21.716 --> 01:31:22.257
We told you.

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:24.117
The blueprint of existence.

01:31:27.358 --> 01:31:28.859
in this grand symphony of life.

01:31:29.459 --> 01:31:30.740
That's already bad, right?

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:33.561
Because the enzyme didn't have to open up the double helix.

01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:35.542
So that was already a bullshit cartoon.

01:31:35.582 --> 01:31:37.603
The double helix has to be open.

01:31:37.643 --> 01:31:40.405
You can't read it without opening it.

01:31:40.445 --> 01:31:52.571
So that's already stupefied and simplified to the point where you're not actually giving people any reasonable information, at least insofar as the cartoon is supposed to look like.

01:31:54.232 --> 01:31:56.353
Messenger mRNA plays a vital part.

01:32:02.045 --> 01:32:11.153
The magnificent diversity of life stems from humble beginnings, evolving over billions of years to attain its marvelous complexity.

01:32:18.019 --> 01:32:27.428
The journey from primitive beings to complex creatures would not have been possible without the genetic blueprint called DNA and the related molecule RNA.

01:32:30.799 --> 01:32:33.584
DNA holds all the instructions to maintain the body.

01:32:34.786 --> 01:32:41.879
These instructions are then copied from DNA into smaller snippets called messenger RNA, which are the to-do list for each cell.

01:32:45.069 --> 01:32:56.874
So you can think... I just want to be clear to Vilma in the chat that I really think that neuro-linguistic programming is only something you need to worry about when you listen to one person, like a therapist.

01:32:57.914 --> 01:33:05.597
The much more dangerous is when two people just talk to each other and agree to lie about something, agree to pretend to understand something.

01:33:06.078 --> 01:33:14.261
And so there might be neuro-linguistic programming used in that kind of podcast enchantment, but it's not even really necessary.

01:33:15.301 --> 01:33:17.542
And it's really not even necessary at all.

01:33:17.562 --> 01:33:25.846
And in fact, I think a lot of what Peter Duke is doing in that article is complicating a very, very uncomplicated thing.

01:33:25.906 --> 01:33:33.169
You don't need to become an expert in neurolinguistic programming to understand how dangerous it is if three people are scripted to lie to you.

01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:40.373
Think of DNA as the blueprint, and mRNA is the project manager bringing plans to life.

01:33:41.994 --> 01:33:42.955
the project manager.

01:33:43.355 --> 01:33:46.798
We choose to go to the moon in this decade.

01:33:46.938 --> 01:33:55.685
During the space race of the 1950s and 60s, genetics research saw rapid progress, including the discovery of messenger RNA in 1961.

01:33:56.425 --> 01:33:57.927
And this is absolutely true.

01:33:57.987 --> 01:34:10.937
And so I tried to say this earlier in the stream, but during the time of the atomic weapons and World War II and the dropping of the bombs, there was also this

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:23.795
rapid change in focus from atomic energy and unleashing the power of the bomb to the final rules of life.

01:34:23.895 --> 01:34:31.219
Because again, it was assumed that once DNA was discovered, then that means that mutations in the DNA would be the way that

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:37.362
that evolution would have, that's the mechanism of evolution.

01:34:37.382 --> 01:34:42.984
And so then the trick would become how do we get from DNA to an organism?

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:46.165
How is an organism encoded in the DNA?

01:34:46.626 --> 01:34:53.708
And we've only ever been able to get so far as to say that we can find coding regions that seem to code for proteins.

01:34:54.639 --> 01:34:56.060
That's as far as we've ever gotten.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:20.720
We have not gotten anywhere near the point where we can understand how the expression of proteins is coordinated over time, how the assembly of proteins is coordinated across time and space, any of this stuff, and whether or not that is encoded in the DNA has never even, it's not, most of these questions haven't even been asked because we have been forced by funding and by mentorship

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:32.485
to focus exclusively on this evolution-because-DNA and DNA-RNA protein, leaving out, of course, the wonderful machine of the ribosome about whom we have no idea.

01:35:38.568 --> 01:35:48.332
Today, scientists have figured out how to create a synthetic modified version of mRNA in the lab that is engineered to last longer and evade immune detection.

01:35:51.269 --> 01:35:58.146
Our cells mistake this lab-made mRNA as their own, and our body starts to create proteins for therapeutics or vaccines.

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:06.551
See, that's one of the more interesting parts of this video because they show the LNP kind of passing through the membrane, not binding to it.

01:36:06.991 --> 01:36:09.853
And I think that's a much more accurate representation of it.

01:36:09.893 --> 01:36:13.316
I think you can think of them more as oil bubbles moving through oil.

01:36:14.116 --> 01:36:18.319
And so it's very possible that the lipid nanoparticles could go to the nucleus.

01:36:18.379 --> 01:36:20.841
It's very possible they could go to mitochondria, the ER.

01:36:22.582 --> 01:36:30.088
and only change their chemical composition and release their components at an unpredictable place or time.

01:36:31.969 --> 01:36:39.755
I think that's probably more likely than not and part of the reason why they don't talk too specifically about what the lipid nanoparticle contributes to this mechanism.

01:36:43.858 --> 01:36:47.001
Those ribosomes are not embedded in membranes, that's pretty dumb.

01:36:49.431 --> 01:36:52.692
For example, your mitochondria have ribosomes.

01:36:52.752 --> 01:36:58.314
What would happen if the ribosomes of mitochondria were transcribing the spike protein instead?

01:36:59.974 --> 01:37:01.975
Just not an unreasonable question here.

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:14.299
The modified mRNA vaccines are created on a computer in a lab without using a real virus.

01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:21.122
These genetic vaccines only required the genetic sequence of the coronavirus.

01:37:21.904 --> 01:37:24.750
We never had access to the physical virus to design the product.

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:31.862
It's almost like they're putting those little clips in there for the benefit of the no virus people.

01:37:31.962 --> 01:37:34.523
You know, we didn't even have the virus, we just had the sequence.

01:37:34.543 --> 01:37:39.366
They're doing that on purpose because it's all one malevolent harmony.

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:46.270
There's gotta be a little bait in here for everybody that's part of this trap on the populist right side that knows for sure it's a lab leak.

01:37:50.034 --> 01:37:58.858
In the early stages of the pandemic, Chinese scientists released the genetic code of the coronavirus, sparking a global race to develop a vaccine.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:09.763
As soon as we get that sequence, let's plug it into mRNA, that's all I needed was the sequence.

01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:17.226
They used the genetic code provided by Chinese scientists as a backbone for their mRNA vaccine.

01:38:20.253 --> 01:38:29.477
The modified genetic code in the vaccine instructs our bodies to produce only a specific part of the coronavirus rather than the entire virus itself.

01:38:29.878 --> 01:38:38.722
One of the things that never gets mentioned anymore by the illustrious Kevin McKernan is that when they make the spike protein mRNA, not only did they end methyl

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.863
N1 methyl pseudouridine, did they not chemically alter it to that?

01:38:46.763 --> 01:39:03.751
But they also designed an RNA with codon optimization, meaning that the codons are not the codons that were reported in Wuhan, but they are codons which are optimized for the human codons for these amino acids.

01:39:03.951 --> 01:39:07.113
And that's a pretty difficult thing to explain, but you know that the

01:39:07.893 --> 01:39:10.895
The genetic code is somewhat redundant at certain codons.

01:39:10.955 --> 01:39:16.859
And that redundancy means that some codons are more prevalent in human tissues than others.

01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:26.325
And the genetic code of the virus has codons that are rarer in human mRNAs and would maybe result in less expression.

01:39:26.365 --> 01:39:31.888
And so they changed these codons to optimize them for human expression.

01:39:32.489 --> 01:39:36.111
And in so doing, what they have done is changed the shape

01:39:37.546 --> 01:39:42.290
not of, well, of the spike protein perhaps, but they've changed the shape of the RNA.

01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:54.219
Because an RNA molecule is not what they've just shown you there with a few spins in it, but it's more like a phone cord that's been pulled to extension and then let come back together.

01:39:54.259 --> 01:39:59.003
And then you get this random assortment of tangles and windings.

01:40:00.604 --> 01:40:02.506
And depending on the specific

01:40:03.618 --> 01:40:10.764
code of that RNA, then there's tendencies for different kinds of curls to occur.

01:40:11.124 --> 01:40:17.510
And those curls have an effect on how that mRNA goes through a particular ribosome.

01:40:19.932 --> 01:40:23.115
So these are all attributes of

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:30.020
unknowns that are currently not discussed at all as a problem for the mRNA.

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.482
But instead, we're just talking about the DNA contamination.

01:40:33.522 --> 01:40:37.223
We're just talking about the fact that they chose this crazy Wuhan spike protein.

01:40:38.324 --> 01:40:41.345
We're not talking about the fact that transfection in general would be bad.

01:40:41.365 --> 01:40:45.026
We're not talking about the fact that the lipid nanoparticle with nothing in it at all might be bad.

01:40:45.066 --> 01:40:49.468
We're not talking about the fact that the spike protein is irrelevant.

01:40:49.508 --> 01:40:52.169
Just expressing protein with

01:40:53.716 --> 01:41:08.465
impure RNAs that are codon optimized so that you do not know the three-dimensional structure, that it could in fact be different, that the end result will be that the protein that is produced is probably not related to the one that it was originally designed to be related to.

01:41:10.726 --> 01:41:12.747
And none of that is presented here.

01:41:14.867 --> 01:41:17.508
in this dumb, simple cartoon.

01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:23.712
Vaccine platforms are using what's called the spike protein of the coronavirus.

01:41:27.413 --> 01:41:29.034
The spike proteins are the tiniest.

01:41:29.154 --> 01:41:30.235
Oh my goodness, that's right.

01:41:30.275 --> 01:41:33.356
You all, you young kids don't know about phone cords.

01:41:33.436 --> 01:41:36.018
Phone cords, phones used to have cords.

01:41:36.078 --> 01:41:39.620
It went all the way to the wall and they were a curly cord.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.001
And so you could get curls that curled on curls.

01:41:42.061 --> 01:41:44.182
And that's what RNA and DNA does.

01:41:45.888 --> 01:41:53.891
Those are called G... G something somethings.

01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:54.511
What do they call it?

01:41:54.532 --> 01:41:55.372
I can't remember anymore.

01:41:55.392 --> 01:41:57.373
Somebody will remember it.

01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:04.736
Once this mRNA code is injected into your body, it instructs your cells to make these coronavirus spikes.

01:42:09.137 --> 01:42:15.340
By creating these spikes in our body, our immune system should build immunity against this specific part of the virus.

01:42:15.811 --> 01:42:19.515
And of course, here they are with the cartoon, immunity is antibodies.

01:42:19.575 --> 01:42:32.889
That's exactly how Francis Collins explained it at the beginning of 2020 in July, when he showed this cartoon of antibodies for the spike and that the vaccine antibodies were better than the immunity from the virus.

01:42:34.291 --> 01:42:35.232
Same bullshit.

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:51.269
The worst mistake of all would be to take messenger RNA and then have it code for a lethal protein that was engineered in a Chinese biosecurity lab.

01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:52.289
Stop lying!

01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:54.291
That was a disaster.

01:42:54.631 --> 01:42:58.173
Stop lying!

01:42:59.714 --> 01:43:06.039
The mRNA technology is exceptionally complicated and unlike anything we have seen with standard vaccines.

01:43:08.632 --> 01:43:10.813
when people receive their first COVID-19.

01:43:10.893 --> 01:43:14.774
Can I try to portray what kind of trap we're in?

01:43:15.775 --> 01:43:21.997
Nobody on the left, nobody that sees what they are shown is seeing this.

01:43:23.458 --> 01:43:27.860
Nobody that sees what they are shown is seeing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:28.880
as a good guy.

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:33.202
Nobody that sees what they are shown is seeing Donald Trump as a bad guy.

01:43:36.175 --> 01:43:44.559
Only people who have tried to figure it out see Donald Trump as somebody who might be okay or have considered the possibility that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:44.659 --> 01:43:50.262
might be fighting a imperfect but morally justified battle.

01:43:52.663 --> 01:43:57.886
We are in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen, because none of us should have been fooled by this, but all of us were.

01:43:59.349 --> 01:44:22.197
and it didn't matter whether you believed it or you didn't believe it, you were being fooled by it because not believing it accepted the other part, you know, the novel virus that just came from a laboratory or from a natural leak, but it doesn't really matter because viruses are real and happen all the time and that's why we have vaccines and thank goodness for Paul Offit.

01:44:24.718 --> 01:44:28.659
Vaccine, it was the first time their body received lipid nanoparticles.

01:44:31.038 --> 01:44:32.299
It's getting freaking hot in here.

01:44:36.361 --> 01:44:43.024
The mRNA vaccine dose is filled with tiny bubbles of fat called lipid nanoparticles.

01:44:43.084 --> 01:44:48.007
These fat bubbles protect the modified mRNA from degrading and help it enter cells.

01:44:48.687 --> 01:44:54.470
Once inside, the mRNA instructs the cells to produce a genetically engineered version of the spike protein.

01:44:57.113 --> 01:45:04.198
Tiny bubbles, tiny bubbles, tiny bubbles, tiny bubbles.

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.780
Ooh, I can hear it.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.641
I can hear it go in.

01:45:07.661 --> 01:45:15.726
The lipid nanoparticles, when they attach to cells, then the lipid nanoparticles dump off their payload messenger RNA.

01:45:16.287 --> 01:45:20.370
The messenger RNA then is taken into the cytoplasm of the cell.

01:45:20.850 --> 01:45:25.033
It's read by ribosomes over and over and over again.

01:45:29.867 --> 01:45:34.991
The spike protein, which is a foreign protein, is expressed on the surface of cells.

01:45:40.415 --> 01:45:45.399
The injection of mRNA vaccines turns our bodies into spike protein manufacturing sites.

01:45:47.061 --> 01:45:49.903
Oh, look at those cute little endothelial cells with their little spikes.

01:45:49.923 --> 01:45:55.147
With every dose, a substantial amount of these modified spike proteins are created inside your body.

01:45:58.649 --> 01:46:05.791
The scientific community has... So there they're showing the spike proteins on endothelial cells, implying that endothelium will get attacked.

01:46:05.851 --> 01:46:16.033
Now, the only question is, is whether you're going to take their word for it that the spike protein is special or just the idea that transfecting your endothelium might be the worst idea ever.

01:46:16.773 --> 01:46:20.174
...stated that the spike protein created by the vaccine is harmless.

01:46:23.534 --> 01:46:26.475
Concerns have been raised about its potential to cause harm.

01:46:28.331 --> 01:46:35.547
A Yale preprint detected spike protein up to 709 days after vaccination in patients with post-vaccination syndrome.

01:46:36.485 --> 01:46:40.167
It could have been a frog protein and it would have gotten all the same results.

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.187
That's my point.

01:46:41.267 --> 01:46:44.849
It could have been a frog protein and it wouldn't have mattered.

01:46:44.869 --> 01:46:52.833
It would have still gotten you the same results with this carrier and this codon optimization and N1 methyl pseudouridine.

01:46:52.913 --> 01:46:54.014
It would have all been the same.

01:46:54.854 --> 01:47:02.158
I don't think the spike proteins specific sequence contributes anything to the results of what we're seeing.

01:47:03.857 --> 01:47:06.298
The code that they used is for the spike protein.

01:47:06.498 --> 01:47:18.360
Early on in the pandemic, we learned that the spike protein is the toxic part of this virus that causes clotting, that causes inflammation, that causes myocarditis, that causes brain fog.

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:31.623
And remember that we had people on the internet very early that were coordinated and scripted to say this, that start with Kevin McCairn, who was interacting with me as early as March of 2020.

01:47:33.237 --> 01:47:46.144
who's connected directly to George Webb of 60 Minutes fame, and Robert Malone, Lawsuit fame, and Jane Ruby fame, and all these other shitheads, Peter Duke.

01:47:48.005 --> 01:47:49.506
There's no way to get around this.

01:47:51.847 --> 01:48:00.152
George Webb was on 60 Minutes in February of 2020, and it's not because he just had a good story about the Wuhan Games.

01:48:02.213 --> 01:48:18.480
George Webb is a scripted actor on the exact same script that Kevin McCairn, Paul Cuttrell, Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, Robert Malone, Jane Ruby, all these people, they're all on the same script.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:28.485
Sasha Latapova, Catherine Watt, Naomi Wolf, Kevin McKernan, Ryan Cole,

01:48:31.038 --> 01:48:33.560
Peter McCullough, Jessica Rose.

01:48:33.681 --> 01:48:36.924
I mean, these are all the same team.

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:50.576
The spike protein... Any foreign protein expression will trigger a response.

01:48:50.796 --> 01:48:58.222
Any protein that is even not where it's supposed to be could potentially trigger a response even if it is an endogenous one.

01:48:58.482 --> 01:49:00.403
Absolutely correct, Jason M.

01:49:01.224 --> 01:49:12.814
That is at the heart of this biology and what all of these people are trying to obfuscate with the LNP and with brand new gene therapy and with the spike protein being a toxic protein.

01:49:13.034 --> 01:49:15.316
Absolutely, positively A+.

01:49:17.798 --> 01:49:23.303
Directly causes blood clotting and is found in the middle of large blood clots.

01:49:30.973 --> 01:49:38.059
Researchers have concerns that the immune response triggered by mRNA vaccines could potentially... Look at those antibodies floating around.

01:49:38.079 --> 01:49:39.260
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.502
...potentially lead to excessive attacks on our tissues and organs.

01:49:42.722 --> 01:49:48.127
But understand that if the endothelium is destroyed, clotting will occur.

01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:55.863
If little tiny parts of the endothelium are destroyed, micro-clotting will occur.

01:49:55.883 --> 01:49:58.585
It's not amyloid and it's not frickin' prion.

01:49:59.345 --> 01:50:01.447
Holy shit, these people are awful.

01:50:03.048 --> 01:50:09.412
And any cell that makes this foreign protein now becomes a target of your own immune cells to attack as well.

01:50:10.032 --> 01:50:11.013
He said it pretty well.

01:50:11.053 --> 01:50:12.454
He just said foreign protein.

01:50:12.474 --> 01:50:15.516
He didn't say the spike protein because it's so nasty.

01:50:19.827 --> 01:50:25.049
Those cells will be attacked immunologically, as if they're infected with the virus.

01:50:29.631 --> 01:50:34.693
The immune system detects the presence of spikes and initiates the destruction of the infected cells.

01:50:35.213 --> 01:50:36.114
I'm going to check the name.

01:50:36.154 --> 01:50:37.314
Hold on one second.

01:50:37.474 --> 01:50:40.795
Inside mRNA vaccines, the documentary.

01:50:41.656 --> 01:50:44.417
Inside mRNA vaccines, the documentary.

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:45.898
And actually, let me show you.

01:50:45.918 --> 01:50:48.539
Did I put that in here somewhere?

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:49.239
It's in the other one.

01:50:50.014 --> 01:50:53.877
There are three... I'm gonna find it in the other one.

01:50:53.917 --> 01:50:54.717
Hold on one second.

01:50:54.737 --> 01:50:55.918
I think I had it in the other one.

01:50:56.719 --> 01:50:56.899
Here.

01:50:58.019 --> 01:51:02.162
There are three prominent... I'm sure I had it in this one.

01:51:02.182 --> 01:51:03.163
Didn't I have it in this one?

01:51:04.204 --> 01:51:04.824
Please tell me.

01:51:04.984 --> 01:51:05.505
Yeah, right here.

01:51:07.386 --> 01:51:11.789
There are... I gotta resume this slideshow and I gotta escape.

01:51:12.429 --> 01:51:13.510
Then I'm gonna come over here.

01:51:16.472 --> 01:51:17.353
Hold on one second.

01:51:17.373 --> 01:51:18.714
I'm gonna try and show you what I mean.

01:51:18.894 --> 01:51:19.094
Yes.

01:51:21.874 --> 01:51:33.902
This, there are three places on Rumble already where you can find this documentary, like the day that it was released, one of them being this Coronavirus Plushie account.

01:51:35.223 --> 01:51:38.565
And they already had lots of views after only less than a day.

01:51:40.227 --> 01:51:44.550
And I knew of two of these, I knew of Sierra Delta and I knew of Coronavirus Plushie.

01:51:45.450 --> 01:51:51.774
a long time ago, because this one posts a lot of videos that I think are, you know, Mickey Willis and this kind of thing.

01:51:53.094 --> 01:51:59.338
And so it's available in a lot of places, and that's conspicuous, and by design, of course.

01:52:00.678 --> 01:52:02.039
Let's keep this going here.

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:04.460
I got to start it over, though.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:05.361
Sorry about that.

01:52:06.461 --> 01:52:10.063
A director is launching a national study into fairness plan.

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:13.325
Other and other and well.

01:52:16.621 --> 01:52:21.743
If you look at some of the studies, where does the vaccine, where does the spike protein like to go to?

01:52:21.944 --> 01:52:24.165
What makes this foreign protein now?

01:52:28.166 --> 01:52:33.049
A widespread distribution could result in the production of spike protein in various organs.

01:52:34.509 --> 01:52:38.992
Lipid nanoparticles go everywhere in the body, as in everywhere.

01:52:40.092 --> 01:52:41.653
Why is he smiling like that?

01:52:43.174 --> 01:52:43.994
Why is he smiling like that?

01:52:44.014 --> 01:52:49.917
To the brain, to the bone marrow, to the liver, to the spleen, most importantly, to the reproductive organs, to the testes, to the ovaries.

01:52:50.877 --> 01:52:53.438
So lipid nanoparticles can't be controlled.

01:53:03.121 --> 01:53:08.984
Most of the lipids should stay in the shoulder, and they are designed to efficiently enter the deltoid muscle cells.

01:53:09.644 --> 01:53:12.285
But they can also be taken up by other cells in the body.

01:53:13.499 --> 01:53:16.060
What did they just say in this video?

01:53:17.241 --> 01:53:20.523
What did they just say in this actual video?

01:53:20.823 --> 01:53:21.123
What?

01:53:31.849 --> 01:53:38.753
Health officials have been cautious in acknowledging that these particles may have the potential to distribute beyond the injection site.

01:53:40.635 --> 01:53:44.556
If these particles enter the bloodstream, they may potentially increase risks.

01:53:44.816 --> 01:53:46.016
That's not by accident.

01:53:46.056 --> 01:53:49.117
Showing you a little bleeding injection is not by accident.

01:53:49.157 --> 01:53:55.938
That's supposed to make you think that John Campbell and Marc Giraudeau are like, maybe we should have, we should pull back on the needle first.

01:53:57.318 --> 01:53:58.199
Holy shit.

01:53:59.839 --> 01:54:04.700
A widespread distribution could result in the production of spike protein in various organs.

01:54:06.181 --> 01:54:10.644
Lipid nanoparticles go everywhere in the body, as in everywhere.

01:54:12.025 --> 01:54:12.905
What a bastard.

01:54:15.167 --> 01:54:21.591
To the brain, to the bone marrow, to the liver, to the spleen, most importantly to the reproductive organs, to the testes, to the ovaries.

01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:25.093
So lipid nanoparticles can't be controlled.

01:54:34.778 --> 01:54:40.643
Most of the lipids should stay in the shoulder, and they are designed to efficiently enter the deltoid muscle cells.

01:54:40.823 --> 01:54:46.067
They are saying that in their own movie, most of the lipids should stay in the shoulder.

01:54:46.708 --> 01:54:50.931
They're opening it up to the possibility that maybe for you it didn't go anywhere.

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:53.553
These people are awful.

01:54:54.014 --> 01:54:55.515
Oh my gosh, they're awful.

01:54:56.216 --> 01:54:58.858
But they can also be taken up by other cells in the body.

01:55:02.802 --> 01:55:09.808
So not only can the cells in your deltoid muscle be turned into spike production sites, but also cells in your heart muscle and organs.

01:55:15.434 --> 01:55:25.363
Current leading theories of mRNA vaccine-related cardiovascular problems include spike protein expression in tissues and molecular mimicry of the spike protein.

01:55:27.364 --> 01:55:42.212
Molecular mimicry is what Dolores Cahill was talking about from very early on, and not being specific about what molecules are being mimicked is very much an admission that this is a bullshit argument.

01:55:48.496 --> 01:55:49.817
This guy's dead, of course.

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:53.838
This guy's dead, and this guy wasn't saying it was amyloid.

01:55:53.878 --> 01:55:55.599
This guy wasn't saying it was prion.

01:55:56.239 --> 01:55:57.300
Just keep that in mind.

01:55:58.721 --> 01:56:09.445
The late pathologist Arne Burkhardt and his team examined over a hundred biopsies from individuals suspected of having suffered adverse reactions to vaccines, some of which were fatal.

01:56:10.946 --> 01:56:15.608
And the destruction of the endothelium may be one of the major factors.

01:56:17.506 --> 01:56:22.808
These biopsies provide clues about how the vaccine may contribute to damage to organs and tissues.

01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:33.433
Our findings are so alarming that the vaccination should be stopped immediately, and especially the vaccination of children.

01:56:39.335 --> 01:56:45.158
When these tiny fat particles enter the bloodstream, they may be absorbed by the walls of blood vessels or the heart.

01:56:48.911 --> 01:56:57.518
If these tissues produce spike proteins, our immune system may attack these areas, causing potentially serious damage to the vessel walls or the heart.

01:56:58.178 --> 01:57:02.662
Having nothing to do with the spike protein, it doesn't matter what protein they expressed here.

01:57:02.722 --> 01:57:06.245
It only had to be foreign and maybe it could have just been one that didn't belong.

01:57:09.367 --> 01:57:12.650
We found spike protein in many organs and many tissues.

01:57:13.251 --> 01:57:18.996
Spike protein was in the endothelium and in the vessels, in the vessel walls.

01:57:28.345 --> 01:57:39.395
Arne Burkhardt's autopsy findings align with a growing body of biopsy and biodistribution studies, including one that used deep learning to track lipid nanoparticle distribution in animals.

01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:46.233
It was actually known before it was deployed in humans, based on rodent models.

01:57:46.253 --> 01:57:53.536
That was the brain area that I worked on.

01:57:53.596 --> 01:57:55.057
Now I got to go all the way back here.

01:57:55.077 --> 01:58:03.321
The FDA director is launching a national study into... These biopsies provide clues about by the walls of blood vessels or the heart.

01:58:07.085 --> 01:58:15.570
If these tissues produce spike proteins, our immune system may attack these areas, causing potentially serious damage to the vessel walls or the heart.

01:58:16.971 --> 01:58:20.293
We found spike protein in many organs and many tissues.

01:58:20.873 --> 01:58:26.557
Spike protein was in the endothelium and in the vessels, in the vessel walls.

01:58:35.945 --> 01:58:45.590
Arne Burkhardt's autopsy findings align with a growing body of biopsy and biodistribution studies, including one that used deep learning to track lipid nanoparticles.

01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:55.094
That's the hippocampus, the site of spatial learning in a mouse and probably in a human, but this is a mouse or a rat.

01:58:56.995 --> 01:58:59.116
And so this is kind of the brain region I worked on.

01:58:59.136 --> 01:59:01.437
I actually worked on the main input to this brain region.

01:59:01.597 --> 01:59:04.678
This is the dentate gyrus, and then this is the hippocampus.

01:59:04.719 --> 01:59:05.479
But it's still kind of cool.

01:59:06.031 --> 01:59:07.292
distribution in animals.

01:59:09.132 --> 01:59:19.516
It was actually known before it was deployed in humans, based on rodent models, that these products went all over the body and yet they persisted to continue to deploy them.

01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:33.161
And so his specific role was to come out on the Bret Weinstein podcast and not say that in June of 2021 because somebody by the name of Byron Bridle was saying it in Canada.

01:59:33.682 --> 01:59:45.172
And so they shut Byron Bridle up with pressure from his university and then put this shithead on the Weinstein podcast with Steve Kirsch to not say what he just said.

01:59:49.674 --> 02:00:00.022
What a malevolent shithead is Robert Lowe.

02:00:01.863 --> 02:00:12.271
It was actually known before it was deployed in humans, based on rodent models, that these products went all over the body, and yet they persisted to continue to deploy them.

02:00:12.651 --> 02:00:13.432
Stop lying!

02:00:14.593 --> 02:00:15.974
Stop lying!

02:00:17.762 --> 02:00:25.026
Health agencies approved mRNA vaccines, knowing that lipid nanoparticles can spread to different organs in animal studies.

02:00:28.227 --> 02:00:30.649
But you see how contradictory that is, right?

02:00:31.009 --> 02:00:38.493
He knew from animal studies, he knew from inventing them, but he still took the shot according to his own lying mouth.

02:00:39.637 --> 02:00:47.642
even though Stephen Hadfield says he forgot to bring his vaccine card to Rome when they went to visit the Vatican and the Roman Senate.

02:00:49.043 --> 02:00:55.487
So I don't know why he took the Moderna in order to travel, but then forget his frickin' vaccine card, because they didn't have one.

02:00:56.348 --> 02:00:57.388
It was just funny.

02:00:58.649 --> 02:01:01.911
They had antigen tests there, though, that were super specific.

02:01:01.951 --> 02:01:02.652
It was crazy.

02:01:03.615 --> 02:01:06.056
That's actually a story that Steve Hadfield tells.

02:01:06.456 --> 02:01:16.721
So on one hand, we're supposed to believe that Robert Malone was misled by Peter Cullis, who said that the lipid nanoparticle problem was fixed and it stays in the shot area, so he took two.

02:01:17.101 --> 02:01:20.262
But now we're supposed to believe that he knew all along that they didn't stay there.

02:01:22.583 --> 02:01:30.827
They conclude that any spread of mRNA beyond the injection site is minimal and short-lived, and have not raised major concerns about the spike protein.

02:01:33.157 --> 02:01:40.160
Research cited by health agencies shows no conclusive evidence of significant harm in humans.

02:01:55.285 --> 02:01:57.426
We never use experimental products in pregnant women.

02:01:57.826 --> 02:01:59.006
We never use it in children.

02:01:59.126 --> 02:02:00.627
In this situation, we've done both.

02:02:02.529 --> 02:02:06.210
And we don't know what's gonna happen to these children long-term after the shot.

02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:14.672
If you look at some of the studies, where does the vaccine, where does the spike protein like to go to?

02:02:15.393 --> 02:02:24.955
To women's ovaries, to men's testes, and how is it gonna affect their future fertility, their ability to have children?

02:02:25.275 --> 02:02:27.756
The answer is we don't know.

02:02:29.156 --> 02:02:54.126
It is just so malevolent to realize that these people like Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Mike Palmer and Haseem Malhotra and Meryl Nass are all responsible for the confusion about a lab leak and a confusion about a toxic spike protein designed in a Chinese lab and responsible for the fear and frustration and doubt that led to a lot of people accepting the countermeasures as a better alternative.

02:02:55.382 --> 02:03:09.226
are now pretending to have been right all along and are now pretending to be the people speaking out against the shit that they actually were paid to facilitate and paid to hide the murder that justified it.

02:03:11.562 --> 02:03:28.947
It is pretty remarkable where we are on the conservative right, because the people that we believe are heroes are responsible for the injuries of our family members, for our family members going along with the TV, because obviously these people are scripted fools.

02:03:31.547 --> 02:03:33.008
We're in trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:33.028 --> 02:03:37.509
The conservative right, the populist right in America needs to wake up and wake up fast.

02:03:37.569 --> 02:03:38.609
We have been had.

02:03:39.150 --> 02:03:40.650
No long-term safety data.

02:03:48.763 --> 02:03:53.787
My doctor, while I was pregnant, said, I'm going to give you the vaccine.

02:03:53.807 --> 02:03:54.908
I have another client.

02:03:55.268 --> 02:03:56.669
The baby's totally fine.

02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:59.051
The baby's immune to COVID.

02:03:59.071 --> 02:04:00.452
This is a really good thing.

02:04:00.512 --> 02:04:02.894
And I was like, I wanted to please my doctor.

02:04:02.934 --> 02:04:03.695
I love my doctor.

02:04:03.715 --> 02:04:06.257
I respect the doctor.

02:04:06.297 --> 02:04:08.498
This part of this is right.

02:04:08.659 --> 02:04:10.140
This part of this is brutal.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.681
I told the story yesterday.

02:04:11.701 --> 02:04:13.723
It is much worse than I thought.

02:04:14.716 --> 02:04:17.979
Doctors and their staff are much worse than I thought.

02:04:18.099 --> 02:04:19.541
It's way worse than I thought.

02:04:19.681 --> 02:04:23.845
I had one of the best doctors in Pittsburgh with one of the highest ratings in Pittsburgh.

02:04:24.325 --> 02:04:25.446
He was a great guy.

02:04:25.766 --> 02:04:32.353
And the moment I tried to tell him that he might not understand everything that he thought he understood, he completely wrote me off.

02:04:32.413 --> 02:04:34.755
And even after I've corrected, course corrected,

02:04:35.235 --> 02:04:40.938
and fine-tuned my understanding of this illusion, including to include that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:04:40.958 --> 02:04:41.618
and C.H.D.

02:04:41.758 --> 02:04:44.639
aren't who they say they are, but there's still an issue here.

02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:50.042
He is just full-blown seeing what he has shown.

02:04:51.343 --> 02:04:56.447
He and like many, most other doctors are only seeing what they are shown.

02:04:57.087 --> 02:05:02.931
And right now this video is only showing you what they want you to see.

02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:11.497
Please understand these people are all unwitting participants or scripted actors.

02:05:13.553 --> 02:05:16.474
And so I got home and I told my husband, you know, I'm thinking about doing this.

02:05:16.514 --> 02:05:20.317
He's like, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, just don't, let's wait, let's wait till after.

02:05:20.337 --> 02:05:21.637
I said, okay, okay.

02:05:24.439 --> 02:05:34.005
And of course, this would be a very easy time to point out that we were already worried about women and what they ingest during pregnancy.

02:05:34.045 --> 02:05:40.809
So the idea that we would inject random things into pregnant people is just absurd.

02:05:43.206 --> 02:05:54.279
And so we're not really scoring the touchdowns that we could score in this video, because again, it is showing you only what they want you to see, allowing you to think only what they want you to think.

02:05:57.523 --> 02:06:02.689
I regret it every single day that I walked into my local pharmacy to get that shot in my arm.

02:06:06.533 --> 02:06:09.614
But the news got me when they said, hey, you're going to have to protect your children.

02:06:09.634 --> 02:06:13.675
And I'm a new mother, and well, what are you going to do?

02:06:13.935 --> 02:06:15.176
I want to protect my child.

02:06:17.597 --> 02:06:19.457
And they're safe and they're highly effective.

02:06:20.097 --> 02:06:21.958
That these are safe and effective.

02:06:22.714 --> 02:06:26.096
Those two words haunt me to this day.

02:06:26.116 --> 02:06:26.856
And that's safe.

02:06:26.936 --> 02:06:31.139
And that was by design, safe and effective is the mandate of the FDA.

02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:32.579
That's why Fauci said it.

02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:34.060
That's why McKernan said it.

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:36.341
That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:06:36.301 --> 02:06:39.003
's dad and Brett Weinstein's dad were involved in it.

02:06:39.043 --> 02:06:41.784
And Estes Kefauver was killed because of it.

02:06:42.585 --> 02:06:50.489
The FDA is one of the targets here because it's in the way of the Human Genome Project and are being used as experimental animals.

02:06:50.529 --> 02:06:51.830
The FDA stands in the way.

02:06:53.663 --> 02:06:58.466
It stands in the way specifically of personalized, designed transfection medicine.

02:06:59.507 --> 02:07:00.508
If and effective.

02:07:02.649 --> 02:07:07.413
Which this vaccine was not safe for me, and it was not effective.

02:07:09.194 --> 02:07:14.017
Safe and effective while there's neuropathy and pain throughout my whole body.

02:07:14.577 --> 02:07:15.698
I can't think straight.

02:07:15.718 --> 02:07:16.739
I have brain fog.

02:07:16.799 --> 02:07:17.840
I can't dance anymore.

02:07:19.741 --> 02:07:25.363
Jessica's serious condition has put an indefinite pause on her career as a multi-talented artist.

02:07:26.024 --> 02:07:30.886
Jessica Sutta rose to stardom as a... Jays and Em, I thought exactly the same thing.

02:07:30.986 --> 02:07:35.648
Once they were trying to give it to pregnant women, I thought, wow, this is a big mistake because this is just stupid.

02:07:36.188 --> 02:07:38.069
And everybody will see how stupid this is.

02:07:38.749 --> 02:07:40.050
It's remarkable that they didn't.

02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:43.051
I really, I am exactly where you were.

02:07:43.231 --> 02:07:49.633
a member of the Pussycat Dolls, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, with 55 million records sold.

02:07:50.093 --> 02:07:52.814
I've had the most incredible experiences in my career.

02:07:53.134 --> 02:07:53.814
I didn't know that was her.

02:07:53.834 --> 02:07:54.174
That's funny.

02:07:54.194 --> 02:07:57.615
After the COVID shot, I have not been able to dance again.

02:07:57.855 --> 02:08:03.897
You know, after the COVID shot, I think my friend Annie Wershing actually got brain cancer and died, like, six months later.

02:08:04.397 --> 02:08:08.659
After the COVID shot, about a year later, my best friend had a frickin' aneurysm and died.

02:08:08.679 --> 02:08:09.799
I mean, so...

02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:11.790
I mean, it sucks.

02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:16.052
There are a lot of people who are probably hurt, but there are a lot of people who are freaking dead.

02:08:16.652 --> 02:08:19.374
And I don't know if I ever will dance again.

02:08:24.056 --> 02:08:33.200
Following the mRNA vaccine, Jessica developed severe autoimmune-like symptoms, leaving her in excruciating... Autoimmune-like symptoms?

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.121
What a weird imprecision that is.

02:08:35.361 --> 02:08:38.062
...pain and relentless fatigue for over three years.

02:08:39.614 --> 02:08:46.723
So about two days after the first shot, I woke up with the most excruciating muscle spasm in my right rib.

02:08:47.344 --> 02:08:57.676
It spread through my whole entire rib cage, burning, stabbing, the most awful, intense pain that no pain reliever can take away.

02:09:01.058 --> 02:09:13.000
I had a stammer for a while where I couldn't put words together and I had involuntary head jerks and leg jerks, overall fatigue, joint pain, all throughout my whole body.

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.881
And during this, I lost about 50 pounds in three months.

02:09:18.781 --> 02:09:23.502
Oh, I hear a sudden pharmaceutical company going, oh shit, wow, what happened there?

02:09:23.542 --> 02:09:24.342
We gotta check that out.

02:09:25.403 --> 02:09:27.723
I feel like my body is eating itself.

02:09:31.673 --> 02:09:38.695
As I sit in front of you right now, I'm in... Maybe she can get bit by a tick that makes her allergic to herself, and then her body will stop eating itself.

02:09:38.715 --> 02:09:39.115
I don't know.

02:09:39.375 --> 02:09:41.055
So much pain, I could just cry.

02:09:41.556 --> 02:09:45.177
So life for me is just a painful existence every single day.

02:09:45.957 --> 02:09:48.818
Honest to God, I feel like I just turned 41, and I feel like I'm 100.

02:09:49.138 --> 02:09:50.258
I never knew 41 would feel like 100.

02:09:50.458 --> 02:09:50.878
And yeah, it's...

02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.081
It's devastating.

02:09:59.101 --> 02:10:00.401
I definitely feel bad for her.

02:10:00.421 --> 02:10:01.362
I'm not making fun of her.

02:10:01.382 --> 02:10:02.162
Don't get me wrong.

02:10:02.182 --> 02:10:04.704
I don't want anyone to go through what I'm going through.

02:10:04.844 --> 02:10:05.424
I do not.

02:10:05.444 --> 02:10:07.706
I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy.

02:10:08.966 --> 02:10:24.936
And the fact that I did this to Kim, I just... It's so lucky that Steve Kirsch, you know, only lost some sight in his eye and Robert Malone just ended up forgetting his Vax card but didn't, you know, get hurt and had actually helped with his long COVID or something, I think.

02:10:26.516 --> 02:10:29.677
Remember, because that's why Robert Malone took it, because he had long COVID.

02:10:30.197 --> 02:10:33.138
Because I can't imagine this happening to a young child.

02:10:36.159 --> 02:10:40.021
The most important thing to remember is what happens when it happens to a young child.

02:10:40.081 --> 02:10:46.643
They don't know, and they can't tell you, and they can't make the connection, and neither can their dipshit doctor.

02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:51.931
mRNA technology.

02:10:52.571 --> 02:10:58.657
It's still new, and it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for where this could be used.

02:10:59.458 --> 02:11:01.800
The lowest hanging fruit is other vaccines.

02:11:02.841 --> 02:11:16.173
The mRNA vaccines, its uses are being expanded tremendously into other vaccines and then into animals, which terrifies me because we just don't know any long-term data.

02:11:20.782 --> 02:11:26.143
While these mRNA vaccines aren't meant to alter our genes, they do use our gene machinery.

02:11:28.584 --> 02:11:33.025
With the rise of mRNA products, our bodies are becoming factories for drug production.

02:11:44.888 --> 02:11:50.229
While these mRNA vaccines aren't meant to alter our genes, they do use our gene machinery.

02:11:53.285 --> 02:12:10.310
In this presentation, where these people were in Stockholm in January of 23, including Mike Palmer, Meryl Ness, Robert Malone, Sasha Latipova, the mother of Soph, and the fraud Asim Malhotra from the UK.

02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:19.533
In 2023, this guy presented a presentation about fifth generation warfare and about how there were no morals.

02:12:20.313 --> 02:12:28.885
There were no limits to what they would do in order to enslave you, and you would never figure out who the people that were doing it to you were.

02:12:29.586 --> 02:12:31.990
And he played a brochure video from the U.S.

02:12:32.070 --> 02:12:33.292
Army Psyops Corps.

02:12:36.758 --> 02:12:39.060
These are the Psywar.

02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:44.304
This is the fifth generation warfare deployed by America on the world.

02:12:44.805 --> 02:12:46.806
They recruited people from other countries.

02:12:47.267 --> 02:13:03.981
They promoted people like Nick Hudson and Claire Craig and Jonathan Engler from other countries to do the same thing that Sasha Latupova is doing and very, very ineffectively question the narrative without actually questioning the narrative or making any useful progress against anything.

02:13:05.731 --> 02:13:08.915
These are some of the worst actors on earth.

02:13:10.457 --> 02:13:18.567
And they are responsible for a lot of others unwittingly fueling the behavior of the lemmings around them.

02:13:19.648 --> 02:13:23.593
But these people are not innocent.

02:13:24.525 --> 02:13:27.186
Meryl Nass is one of the worst Americans alive.

02:13:27.246 --> 02:13:28.727
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

02:13:29.247 --> 02:13:31.648
Robert Malone's one of the worst Americans alive.

02:13:31.708 --> 02:13:33.029
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

02:13:33.489 --> 02:13:39.272
This Sasha Latupova person is one of the worst Americans and one of the worst moms alive.

02:13:40.733 --> 02:13:45.875
This is one of the worst sons and one of the most fraudulent doctors alive.

02:13:50.262 --> 02:13:51.624
Rise of MRNA products.

02:13:51.964 --> 02:13:54.407
Our bodies are becoming factories for drug production.

02:14:01.295 --> 02:14:06.702
Why were they filming it like that to make a documentary, but then not release it for two years?

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:18.358
Why would they film that conference in January of 2023 but not release this documentary for two and a half years?

02:14:18.978 --> 02:14:30.363
Unless it was a scripted theater all along and that's why they use ZDogg and Paul Offit videos and audio in this video because it was all done as part of a script.

02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:46.386
These experts emphasize extreme caution to protect current and future generations from any potential health disasters, as we've seen with toxic substances in the past, such as lead, asbestos, and DDT.

02:14:48.007 --> 02:14:50.028
Dusting with DDT was begun at once.

02:14:50.888 --> 02:15:00.212
They're working on this technology, this lipid nanoparticle plus a gene sequence, for so many other viruses and infectious diseases now.

02:15:01.747 --> 02:15:09.613
By helping to create the vaccines that really rescued us from the coronavirus, I'm here with Stéphane Bancel, who is the CEO of Moderna.

02:15:10.213 --> 02:15:10.814
What's next?

02:15:11.114 --> 02:15:15.077
So what we're working on is a lot of vaccines, around 30 plus vaccines today.

02:15:17.439 --> 02:15:21.362
The FDA has approved Moderna's RSV vaccine for people 60 and older.

02:15:23.083 --> 02:15:26.686
To approve a new type of self-amplifying mRNA vaccine.

02:15:28.092 --> 02:15:33.416
and they want to do this and they want people to think, see, we used it during COVID.

02:15:34.797 --> 02:15:36.979
Wasn't it great that we were able to warp speed it?

02:15:37.339 --> 02:15:38.500
No, it's not great.

02:15:40.221 --> 02:15:46.545
Now they've got 50 more racing trains coming down the tracks because they- Why did they show Biden there?

02:15:46.626 --> 02:15:47.666
Why did they show Biden?

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:49.988
Warp speed and the rushing of it was Donald Trump.

02:15:50.008 --> 02:15:51.149
Why did they show Biden?

02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:53.931
It's so interesting.

02:15:53.971 --> 02:15:55.132
This is so weird.

02:15:56.254 --> 02:15:58.135
It's almost like they're liars.

02:15:58.555 --> 02:15:59.576
They think they have permission.

02:16:03.417 --> 02:16:08.860
It was such a success of mRNA technology.

02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:12.902
The mRNA technology is a very powerful technology.

02:16:14.323 --> 02:16:19.225
How can Sasha be better than the rest of the group if she's freaking part of the group?

02:16:20.333 --> 02:16:21.555
What the hell is wrong with you?

02:16:22.015 --> 02:16:26.461
That's like saying that Ku Klux Klan guy is better than most of them.

02:16:26.861 --> 02:16:28.783
At least he can hang out at barbecues.

02:16:29.946 --> 02:16:32.909
That is the biggest bullshit comment I've ever heard.

02:16:33.069 --> 02:16:34.611
She's on their team.

02:16:35.012 --> 02:16:36.673
She's been at the barbecues.

02:16:36.734 --> 02:16:39.517
She's been at the frickin' hotel breakfast.

02:16:39.877 --> 02:16:47.365
She's traveled the world with Robert Malone and Meryl Nass, two of the biggest frauds in America, but she's better than them?

02:16:47.806 --> 02:16:48.847
Come on, dude.

02:16:49.347 --> 02:16:51.190
Have a little more discernment than that.

02:16:51.891 --> 02:16:59.688
Throughout the pandemic, world leaders championed the new mRNA vaccine platforms, expanding their use to other vaccines.

02:17:01.010 --> 02:17:05.071
Indeed, mRNA vaccines will be central to the EU's preparedness plan.

02:17:05.171 --> 02:17:09.492
If she's less narrow-minded than them, it's because she has a different script than them.

02:17:09.552 --> 02:17:11.472
They gave her slightly different lines.

02:17:11.552 --> 02:17:12.032
Come on.

02:17:12.552 --> 02:17:15.853
You are... You are... You've got to be pretending in the chat.

02:17:15.913 --> 02:17:17.513
That can't possibly be real.

02:17:18.454 --> 02:17:21.374
For fighting COVID-19 and other viruses.

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:27.436
It is a great moment for us and it's a great moment for all the thousands of people working here.

02:17:27.536 --> 02:17:29.216
They feel very excited about your visit.

02:17:34.298 --> 02:17:43.147
And this pioneering technology could be the backbone of our future vaccine portfolio.

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:48.713
AI holds incredible promise for all of us.

02:17:49.814 --> 02:17:55.380
To design a vaccine for every individual person, to vaccinate them against that virus.

02:18:01.829 --> 02:18:04.511
And this pioneering technology could be the backbone.

02:18:04.711 --> 02:18:05.332
You see that?

02:18:05.992 --> 02:18:06.593
What is that?

02:18:08.034 --> 02:18:13.919
Those are not... Those are not labels of these machines, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:13.979 --> 02:18:15.960
What those are, are script cards.

02:18:17.301 --> 02:18:24.447
Script cards, so that while they're speaking to the cameras in this setup, they don't forget the main points.

02:18:26.527 --> 02:18:33.193
There's no vaccine factory that has a fricking laminated sign that says RNA and another laminated sign that says lipid right next to it.

02:18:34.494 --> 02:18:35.375
Holy shit.

02:18:37.237 --> 02:18:39.699
Of our future vaccine portfolio.

02:18:42.902 --> 02:18:43.322
Thank you.

02:18:45.204 --> 02:18:47.967
AI holds incredible promise for all of us.

02:18:49.088 --> 02:18:52.789
to design a vaccine for every individual person.

02:18:53.469 --> 02:19:11.954
Using AI to generate vaccines, using AI to find genes, using AI to diagnose things is something that Claire Craig was doing before the pandemic, that Kevin McKernan was doing before the pandemic, that everybody interested in the Human Genome Project was doing before the pandemic, that anybody that's interested in using AI

02:19:12.594 --> 02:19:23.879
to de-identify or re-identify genetic data with medical data, like from the Epic database, would definitely be interested in learning language learning, large learning modules.

02:19:23.979 --> 02:19:33.084
Man, I'm talking about really networks and networks and networks that are designed to just make giant,

02:19:35.464 --> 02:19:43.288
machine learning algorithms, giant machine learning algorithms to try and crunch the data that they are collecting.

02:19:44.028 --> 02:19:51.212
They aren't there yet, just like they needed to first start with chess before they moved on to learning the game Go.

02:19:51.692 --> 02:19:54.874
They are not there yet, but they've got a couple data sets now.

02:19:54.914 --> 02:19:56.755
They got a data set from Ohio State.

02:19:57.315 --> 02:20:15.594
They got a data set from the University of Illinois and they can take all those student data records and go back into Epic and pull those out and then take all the swab samples from all those kids and sequence them all and see if they can feed that data into an AI and see if the AI can pull patterns out.

02:20:16.325 --> 02:20:21.947
And if it doesn't work, maybe they'll add the Ohio State data to the Illinois State data.

02:20:21.987 --> 02:20:24.667
And maybe if that doesn't work, they'll at least know what does.

02:20:25.067 --> 02:20:37.691
And then they'll take those things and apply it to the Florida State data or rerun the Ohio State data after they've modified the code analyzing the University of Illinois data.

02:20:41.272 --> 02:20:45.073
Someday they'll get it right in plenty of time for our grandkids.

02:20:46.877 --> 02:20:50.420
I like where my Chief Woohoo ended up there.

02:20:50.521 --> 02:20:52.583
To vaccinate them against that cancer.

02:20:53.584 --> 02:20:58.228
And you can make that vaccine, that mRNA vaccine.

02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:04.995
It's a strand of mRNA, the code of life inside every cell of your body.

02:21:05.335 --> 02:21:07.857
Then it has the power to change everything.

02:21:07.877 --> 02:21:11.601
Moderna, this changes everything.

02:21:14.454 --> 02:21:25.138
Are companies like Moderna, this is a revolutionary biotech firm that's creating a whole new class of medicines based on messenger RNA, the software of life.

02:21:25.318 --> 02:21:28.099
Well, it's almost science fiction what you're up to.

02:21:28.479 --> 02:21:29.119
It's like software.

02:21:29.539 --> 02:21:30.339
It's a software of life.

02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:33.501
I mean, we have 48 drugs today in development.

02:21:33.521 --> 02:21:33.501
48.

02:21:33.701 --> 02:21:34.601
48 today.

02:21:34.681 --> 02:21:36.602
And there's 50 more in the labs cooking.

02:21:37.422 --> 02:21:42.864
While Moderna's products are not designed to alter genes, but to cure diseases and develop vaccines,

02:21:43.976 --> 02:21:53.495
It is also true that mRNA technology has made humanity more open to gene and cell therapies, a view echoed by Stefan Ulrich, an executive at Bayer.

02:21:54.139 --> 02:21:57.942
The mRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy.

02:21:57.962 --> 02:22:06.747
I always like to say, if we had surveyed two years ago in the public, would you be willing to take a gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body?

02:22:07.208 --> 02:22:09.849
We would have probably had a 95% refusal rate.

02:22:10.049 --> 02:22:14.833
I think this pandemic has also opened many people's eyes to innovation.

02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:18.935
Many people's eyes to innovation.

02:22:24.165 --> 02:22:42.996
understand please that the understand that the skeptical part of the sales pitch is as important as the accepting part of the sales pitch the miracle part of the sales pitch because the skeptical part of the sales pitch coming together with the miracle part of the sales pitch is the

02:22:43.496 --> 02:22:47.858
the fifth generation warfare because even the objections can be answered.

02:22:47.878 --> 02:22:57.901
And so eventually, even though we were, it was flawed in the beginning or it was terrible in the beginning, there is an imaginary MRNA that's perfect for everyone.

02:23:00.322 --> 02:23:06.284
There is a theoretical goal here that is good for everyone.

02:23:06.324 --> 02:23:11.986
And even Mary Holland would say that this technology wasn't ready for prime time yet.

02:23:14.375 --> 02:23:15.835
Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:23:16.475 --> 02:23:19.976
and Stephen Hadfield will tell you they're not anti-vaccine.

02:23:19.996 --> 02:23:21.857
They've been doing vaccines for years.

02:23:22.317 --> 02:23:25.477
They just want safe, tested vaccines.

02:23:27.558 --> 02:23:34.679
It's converging on a common goal where we decide that there are no medicines that are good for everybody.

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:38.280
And so the FDA is kind of an outdated idea.

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.620
Not intramuscular injection, that's great.

02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:43.661
It's the FDA that's an outdated idea.

02:23:46.311 --> 02:23:53.493
By hacking organisms, elites may gain the power to re-engineer the future of life itself.

02:23:54.233 --> 02:23:58.734
Of course, they just showed the dire wolves there, which is hilarious.

02:23:59.174 --> 02:24:06.136
This will be the greatest revolution in biology since the very beginning of life four billion years ago.

02:24:07.957 --> 02:24:11.378
What an absolute crock of shit this is.

02:24:12.258 --> 02:24:12.578
Wow.

02:24:18.157 --> 02:24:21.541
Jason M has hit another absolute home run.

02:24:22.422 --> 02:24:25.926
Electroporation is the future, ladies and gentlemen, it absolutely is.

02:24:28.869 --> 02:24:29.830
Hey, Toby!

02:24:29.970 --> 02:24:37.399
A 39-year-old mother of two sons and wife to a wonderful husband experienced a life-changing turn after getting the mRNA vaccine.

02:24:42.193 --> 02:24:49.736
It was very hard for my husband to watch me suffer the way I did, and my children didn't know what was going on.

02:24:49.996 --> 02:24:56.198
You know, I didn't know if I was gonna live till the next day, and I had to have these hard conversations with my children.

02:24:57.499 --> 02:24:58.099
Her nerves.

02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:01.280
It's her nerves.

02:25:04.521 --> 02:25:05.482
More cartoons.

02:25:06.362 --> 02:25:06.682
Ooh.

02:25:06.722 --> 02:25:09.263
Vaccines can dysregulate the immune system.

02:25:09.303 --> 02:25:10.023
Multiple sclerosis here.

02:25:10.043 --> 02:25:11.204
Triggering autoimmunity.

02:25:12.148 --> 02:25:12.749
Look at that!

02:25:12.809 --> 02:25:14.611
Wait, what is that?

02:25:15.151 --> 02:25:15.752
What is that?

02:25:15.812 --> 02:25:19.756
Is that a virus that's hanging around the myelin sheath of neurons?

02:25:19.856 --> 02:25:23.339
What in the Sam hell are they showing here?

02:25:24.941 --> 02:25:26.663
This is so crazy!

02:25:26.783 --> 02:25:27.163
What is this?

02:25:27.183 --> 02:25:29.145
Holy shit, what is this?

02:25:38.584 --> 02:25:42.827
The antibodies are coming from where?

02:25:43.248 --> 02:25:45.890
Where are the antibodies coming from in this shot?

02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:48.291
Are they coming from the big virus cell here?

02:25:48.351 --> 02:25:50.893
What the f... What is this?

02:25:52.595 --> 02:25:54.576
Holy shit, is this bad.

02:25:55.637 --> 02:25:57.178
Wow, is this bad.

02:25:57.718 --> 02:25:59.400
What is going on in this video?

02:26:02.912 --> 02:26:06.396
The body attacks itself, potentially damaging the immune system.

02:26:06.416 --> 02:26:12.903
Could autoimmunity cause Toby's symptoms, where a dysregulated immune system attacks her nerves?

02:26:18.329 --> 02:26:22.814
Vaccines can dysregulate the immune system, triggering autoimmunity.

02:26:24.733 --> 02:26:26.334
I'm sorry, but look at that picture.

02:26:26.834 --> 02:26:34.277
They are making it look like the antibodies are coming out of these giant viruses that are then attacking the myelin on the she.

02:26:36.578 --> 02:26:37.638
That is fantastic.

02:26:37.938 --> 02:26:41.560
The body attacks itself, potentially damaging nerves.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:42.220
Wow.

02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:44.081
Wow.

02:26:44.881 --> 02:26:47.582
I started suffering with severe vertigo.

02:26:47.722 --> 02:26:49.343
Look at how bad that is.

02:26:52.253 --> 02:26:54.335
Look at how bad that is.

02:26:54.695 --> 02:26:55.756
Oh my gosh.

02:26:56.776 --> 02:27:00.679
I felt like there was electric raindrops dropping on my skin.

02:27:00.699 --> 02:27:03.341
I had burning sensations in my brain.

02:27:03.361 --> 02:27:06.764
I was having audible hallucinations.

02:27:07.464 --> 02:27:09.366
I was suffering from aura.

02:27:09.386 --> 02:27:10.887
You should talk to Sherry Tenpenny.

02:27:10.947 --> 02:27:12.708
She's had audible hallucinations.

02:27:12.768 --> 02:27:17.652
She thinks God told her to do it because she's willing to do the work, whatever that meant.

02:27:17.967 --> 02:27:24.931
migraines, tremors, internal vibrations, excruciating leg pains.

02:27:25.191 --> 02:27:27.392
My veins were bulging and burning.

02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.254
I developed POTS.

02:27:30.854 --> 02:27:33.216
I had lost an extreme amount of weight.

02:27:36.338 --> 02:27:40.040
I have extreme joint pain, muscle atrophy.

02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:42.021
The list is endless.

02:27:42.641 --> 02:27:46.964
I was afraid to fall asleep at night because I didn't know if I was going to wake up.

02:28:01.593 --> 02:28:06.995
Over the course of 60 years of mRNA research, early studies failed to make mRNA work.

02:28:09.796 --> 02:28:14.918
Simply injecting mRNA caused dangerous immune reactions and was highly inefficient.

02:28:17.319 --> 02:28:19.680
Until Robert Malone took it to the next level.

02:28:29.028 --> 02:28:33.614
Robert Malone's team made major breakthroughs proving that mRNA could be used as a drug.

02:28:35.056 --> 02:28:40.303
By using lipids to protect the fragile mRNA, they successfully made it work in human cells.

02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:44.362
That was an Inder Verma paper and Felger.

02:28:44.422 --> 02:28:47.404
That was not the John Wolfe paper.

02:28:47.424 --> 02:28:59.072
And it's interesting because John Wolfe was invited to write a review about human genetics with Joshua Lederberg, not the other two authors on that paper, not Robert Malone, but John Wolfe.

02:28:59.112 --> 02:29:01.513
And John Wolfe, I think is dead.

02:29:01.634 --> 02:29:03.255
I think he might even have died.

02:29:03.275 --> 02:29:05.196
I don't know for sure.

02:29:05.276 --> 02:29:07.978
He might've died as the same way that Tony Bark died.

02:29:10.247 --> 02:29:12.492
of esophageal cancer in 2020.

02:29:12.933 --> 02:29:13.694
That's possible.

02:29:13.875 --> 02:29:17.563
Yet, the toxicity of these lipids remained a decades-long challenge.

02:29:18.365 --> 02:29:20.887
Again and again and again those trials failed.

02:29:21.587 --> 02:29:30.794
The industry has been plagued with the problem that these formulations... So don't forget that Inder Verma is an Indian guy who got a lot of awards in India.

02:29:30.834 --> 02:29:42.823
He's a very highly respected geneticist in India who this guy studied with supposedly got PTSD from because they were fighting about the RNA idea for so long blah blah blah blah blah.

02:29:45.063 --> 02:29:49.844
But Indoverma has been in front of the Congress talking about vaccines as well.

02:29:50.064 --> 02:29:50.765
They're toxic.

02:29:51.805 --> 02:30:03.968
Now there had been improvements in the technology or alterations at least since I had abandoned the field in the late 1990s because of the inflammation and toxicity of the formulations.

02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:11.330
Their discovery led to a monumental medical breakthrough.

02:30:11.350 --> 02:30:14.731
This year's Nobel Prize recognizes

02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:19.544
Catalin Carrico and Drew Weissman made a Nobel Prize worthy discovery.

02:30:19.644 --> 02:30:29.953
Don't forget that at the beginning of this video, Paul Offit on TWIV or no, sorry, on the ZDogg podcast is saying that Robert Malone could have won this Nobel Prize.

02:30:30.033 --> 02:30:30.393
Could have.

02:30:32.255 --> 02:30:35.878
Engineering mRNA to be nearly invisible to the immune system.

02:30:41.713 --> 02:30:46.378
Unmodified foreign mRNA is very fragile and potentially dangerous to use.

02:30:49.554 --> 02:30:53.957
This modified version of mRNA... Potentially dangerous to use.

02:30:54.238 --> 02:30:55.479
Wow, that is wrong.

02:30:56.239 --> 02:30:57.040
Holy shit.

02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:01.443
...is more potent, durable, and less likely to cause harmful inflammation.

02:31:01.664 --> 02:31:02.264
Wow!

02:31:02.404 --> 02:31:04.466
Catherine Organic, how do you like that?

02:31:04.546 --> 02:31:13.973
The analog N1 methyl pseudouridine is actually less likely to hurt you because it's so awesome.

02:31:14.454 --> 02:31:16.175
Holy shit, that's amazing.

02:31:17.396 --> 02:31:18.457
Krikal and Weissman

02:31:19.721 --> 02:31:25.408
And so they took the U out and put pseudouridine in there and produced a molecule.

02:31:25.488 --> 02:31:27.671
It's a kind of a modified synthetic thing.

02:31:28.972 --> 02:31:32.617
And that worked considerably better because the RNA doesn't degrade.

02:31:32.737 --> 02:31:34.699
It stays around for a long period of time.

02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:38.304
And the pseudouridine appears to suppress some of the inflammation.

02:31:39.017 --> 02:31:42.599
Wow, so we have Kevin McKernan making this mistake.

02:31:43.099 --> 02:31:46.301
We have Brian Hooker making this mistake.

02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:57.747
We have almost everyone on our list making the mistake of not saying, including Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying, not saying that it's not pseudouridine because pseudouridine is natural.

02:31:57.787 --> 02:31:59.288
Pseudouridine wouldn't have worked.

02:31:59.748 --> 02:32:04.491
Pseudouridine would not have done what N1 methyl pseudouridine did.

02:32:06.192 --> 02:32:06.432
This

02:32:08.197 --> 02:32:09.138
is not a mistake.

02:32:09.738 --> 02:32:17.625
This is scripted bullshit that can be easily discarded by anyone who's looking.

02:32:20.307 --> 02:32:25.432
They intentionally made messenger RNA synthetic for Pfizer-Moderna.

02:32:25.952 --> 02:32:28.835
This increased the efficiency to the maximum

02:32:31.855 --> 02:32:34.376
Using too much pseudouridine may cause error.

02:32:34.596 --> 02:32:37.697
They keep saying pseudouridine.

02:32:38.277 --> 02:32:39.218
Holy shit.

02:32:39.718 --> 02:32:42.659
Catherine Organic is so right about this, it's painful.

02:32:44.619 --> 02:32:47.120
In ribosome reading, leading to malfunctions.

02:32:49.961 --> 02:32:52.422
A research team at Cambridge University found that.

02:32:52.482 --> 02:32:57.584
Of course, that can also happen because of their codon optimization, but they're not saying that here.

02:32:59.037 --> 02:33:07.101
With these vaccines, about 10% of the time, the cellular machinery produced faulty proteins instead of the intended spike protein.

02:33:09.383 --> 02:33:19.868
While the researchers did not observe any harm with these proteins and assured that the issue could be fixed, the bigger question is how this was missed and whether there are more things overlooked.

02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:27.953
Of course, the more things that you already know and what your brain is queuing up is the DNA contamination.

02:33:30.478 --> 02:33:39.745
This modified RNA should be cleared from our bodies within days, but more research is needed to understand why it sometimes lingers much longer in some individuals.

02:33:40.486 --> 02:33:45.470
There was statements made that the RNA only stays in your body for a brief period of time.

02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:49.373
That's true for natural RNA, but this is not a natural RNA.

02:33:49.413 --> 02:33:50.714
This is a synthetic product.

02:33:51.054 --> 02:33:56.799
The pharmaceutical industry and the governments misrepresented this to patients.

02:34:00.034 --> 02:34:04.736
I mean, he knew it and he didn't say it when he could have said it, so he misrepresented it too.

02:34:05.516 --> 02:34:06.917
But he's pretending that he didn't.

02:34:07.998 --> 02:34:12.960
He scripted Merrill Nass and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:19.282
to not adequately represent what this was by scripting them not to call it transfection.

02:34:19.322 --> 02:34:25.625
And even though it says transfection on all those papers on his resume, this master still has not said it.

02:34:27.466 --> 02:34:29.387
That's how you know they are scripted traitors.

02:34:32.082 --> 02:34:44.975
As recently as 2017, just three years before the pandemic, mRNA technology was still in the experimental phase, with challenges in toxicity, biodistribution and very limited human testing.

02:34:45.235 --> 02:34:50.080
So the RNA area, can you talk us through where we're at, how optimistic you are?

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:54.265
You know, there's early animal data that shows real promise.

02:34:58.092 --> 02:35:07.937
In 2017, a Stat News investigation reported that Moderna's mRNA therapy for a rare disease failed in animal studies due to lipid particle toxicity.

02:35:09.212 --> 02:35:25.506
The company has since... And so again, it's very curious to see that the FDA led by Marty McCary and Vinay Prasad is moving away from animal testing and going to AI and computational models, which would again allow mRNA to pass a lot of tests that it wouldn't otherwise pass.

02:35:25.546 --> 02:35:28.589
You can see it's a full court press of bullshit.

02:35:28.749 --> 02:35:30.571
Proved the safety of its technology.

02:35:39.668 --> 02:35:41.009
Oh, let's cover all of it.

02:35:41.109 --> 02:35:45.010
Oh yeah, let's... There he is!

02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:46.691
Hey, that's the ribosome guy!

02:35:47.351 --> 02:35:54.433
That's, uh... I don't remember his name, but that's the guy that Mark Kulak introduced me to.

02:35:54.633 --> 02:36:02.556
Oh wow, we gotta go back a little bit, because that's pretty cool.

02:36:03.016 --> 02:36:07.038
Um... So... ...scientists... ...saying I had to have these...

02:36:08.857 --> 02:36:09.357
Are you sure?

02:36:10.237 --> 02:36:11.538
On this unproven thing.

02:36:12.118 --> 02:36:14.818
We were meeting with pharmaceutical and biotech.

02:36:14.978 --> 02:36:20.920
Were not inflammatory and would remain localized at the site of injection of the draining lymph nodes.

02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:24.940
And that became the storyline that all accepted.

02:36:26.841 --> 02:36:31.022
I want to just pause it on some of these people.

02:36:32.542 --> 02:36:36.403
Since the 90s, mRNA technology has made remarkable progress.

02:36:37.119 --> 02:36:39.141
So, of course, we know he's a fraud.

02:36:39.381 --> 02:36:43.584
These two probably don't understand how they're being used.

02:36:43.924 --> 02:36:45.145
They're not very complicated.

02:36:45.225 --> 02:36:50.529
Derek Rossi is actually one of the guys who was working with Moderna.

02:36:50.569 --> 02:36:58.836
Derek Rossi actually had a postdoc by the name of Luigi Warren, and Luigi Warren was one of the original members of Drastic.

02:36:59.236 --> 02:37:11.649
Luigi Warren is also the guy who gave me the Marek's disease paper in chickens and kind of encouraged me to talk about how transfection to the spike protein might cause the virus to evolve.

02:37:12.987 --> 02:37:26.422
So the postdoc of Derek Rossi is actually responsible directly for setting me up thinking that I had something to say about why transfection to the spike protein might cause the virus to change.

02:37:26.482 --> 02:37:31.648
And I didn't realize at the time that that of course made me accept that there was a virus going around.

02:37:32.329 --> 02:37:33.070
His postdoc.

02:37:34.045 --> 02:37:45.953
Luigi Warren the guy who had a spread in the in USA Today in 2020 actually was in that when a whole mid spread in USA Today Can't make this up.

02:37:46.814 --> 02:37:51.517
I've touched every single part of this bullshit narrative burn more control

02:37:52.867 --> 02:37:53.728
Robert Langer.

02:37:53.828 --> 02:37:59.294
Peter Cullis is the guy that Robert Malone says lied to him about the lipid nanoparticle.

02:37:59.734 --> 02:38:10.546
He is credited with inventing the lipid nanoparticle that saved everybody, but of course now we're finding out that it didn't save anybody and that it didn't do anything special and it just went everywhere.

02:38:11.187 --> 02:38:14.390
And we have a video of Peter Cullis saying that he wasted

02:38:15.191 --> 02:38:23.526
five postdocs trying to get lipid nanoparticles to stay in one place and one postdoc even threatened to quit if she was forced to work on it.

02:38:30.356 --> 02:38:32.357
thanks to brilliant Barty Graham.

02:38:32.537 --> 02:38:46.824
That's the guy who works at the big tall dude that works at the Vaccine Research Center for the NIH and also was the the like college roommate of the dude at Rice University that also now is at Pfizer or somewhere else like it's crazy.

02:38:47.304 --> 02:38:49.025
Scientists and the decades

02:38:49.565 --> 02:38:52.407
That guy's the dude with the, oh no, that's not him.

02:38:53.127 --> 02:38:54.588
Okay, maybe I got that mixed up.

02:38:54.648 --> 02:38:56.209
Maybe that's not the dude I thought it was.

02:38:56.269 --> 02:38:59.571
I thought that that was the ribosome guy.

02:38:59.611 --> 02:39:01.312
This is somebody completely different, my bad.

02:39:01.672 --> 02:39:03.173
Long coordination of U.S.

02:39:03.213 --> 02:39:05.215
scientific and military agencies.

02:39:09.337 --> 02:39:15.161
But for a global vaccination campaign, it had to be more than just an exciting technology in development.

02:39:15.681 --> 02:39:17.182
It had to be truly flawless.

02:39:18.325 --> 02:39:31.771
The people working in the field believed that they had developed compounds and formulations that were not toxic, were not inflammatory, and would remain localized at the site of injection of the draining lymph nodes.

02:39:32.431 --> 02:39:35.793
And that became the storyline that all accepted.

02:39:40.195 --> 02:39:42.436
Stay at home during this pandemic.

02:39:43.263 --> 02:39:49.046
a global vaccination program without a vaccine that hasn't been fully developed yet.

02:39:51.167 --> 02:39:55.109
You get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated.

02:39:56.230 --> 02:40:00.812
mRNA vaccines took the spotlight as one of the leading candidates for a COVID vaccine.

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:06.863
Today we're meeting with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

02:40:07.163 --> 02:40:08.244
How can we make it faster?

02:40:08.344 --> 02:40:15.010
We were able to go so fast because we were working for many years with the NIH and we had worked with Dr. Sparcy's team.

02:40:16.992 --> 02:40:25.379
The former CDC director, Robert Redfield, was surprised by the strong preference for mRNA vaccines over traditional proven technologies.

02:40:26.596 --> 02:40:31.777
Berks and I were on the board, and we voted for the protein vaccines to be included.

02:40:31.937 --> 02:40:35.978
Berks and I felt this is, you know, 50-year technology.

02:40:36.038 --> 02:40:36.758
Let's go with it.

02:40:37.318 --> 02:40:45.260
And part of the reason we didn't win is everyone didn't think it was sexy enough, all right?

02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:47.100
The mRNA was new, it was sexy.

02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:49.961
There was a pretty heavy bias by other people in the room.

02:40:53.283 --> 02:40:59.646
Fascinating that on mRNA technologies, Moderna had never safely brought a product to market ever before.

02:41:00.226 --> 02:41:04.408
But that same company has never brought an approved vaccine to market.

02:41:04.608 --> 02:41:08.310
It's never produced a commercial product before.

02:41:08.390 --> 02:41:12.872
Drew Griffin explains why so many people are pinning their hopes on this unproven technology.

02:41:13.413 --> 02:41:23.958
So why in the world were we allowing companies with no experience in the vaccine realms to produce a product to be used around the world?

02:41:29.861 --> 02:41:42.727
And of course, the reason why that none of these people will tell you is that making an mRNA vaccine is as simple as making DNA, which is super cheap because of the Human Genome Project.

02:41:43.968 --> 02:41:49.390
And it's a very, very common molecular biology methodology.

02:41:49.430 --> 02:41:53.471
The whole thing is widely available, so anybody can do it.

02:41:53.752 --> 02:41:54.412
That's why.

02:41:54.432 --> 02:42:06.196
Borla, the CEO of Pfizer, admitted, he said, he went to a scientist and said, why are we using mRNA technology?

02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:08.477
We've only been researching this for two and a half years.

02:42:08.797 --> 02:42:11.438
And they just turned around and said to him, it's because it's what we're doing.

02:42:13.925 --> 02:42:17.986
He came and suggested to me mRNA, and it was very counterintuitive, the decision.

02:42:18.026 --> 02:42:18.887
I told him, are you sure?

02:42:19.927 --> 02:42:23.028
If you do that, this is not going to be only the first COVID vaccine.

02:42:23.048 --> 02:42:24.289
That will be the first vaccine ever.

02:42:25.289 --> 02:42:26.909
And they felt strongly about it.

02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:30.331
And I had to place my trust on them, and I did.

02:42:34.232 --> 02:42:39.814
But was it too much of a leap to go from no approved mRNA vaccines to deploying them to billions?

02:42:45.287 --> 02:42:54.012
The COVID vaccine trials were critical for evaluating mRNA technology's potential concerns about toxicity and biodistribution.

02:42:56.874 --> 02:42:59.996
How do we know if these vaccines are working?

02:43:02.341 --> 02:43:09.062
It takes about a decade, about 10 years and well over a billion dollars to bring a vaccine to market.

02:43:09.722 --> 02:43:12.963
But the decision was made that there was not sufficient time.

02:43:13.463 --> 02:43:20.245
What was done was to run very limited clinical trials of very short-term duration.

02:43:20.665 --> 02:43:27.126
There needs to be some compromise in some of the safety measures that would normally be expected.

02:43:29.448 --> 02:43:33.731
They overlapped the studies and were allowed to submit earlier research data.

02:43:35.372 --> 02:43:44.418
Before the pandemic, the FDA sometimes treated mRNA vaccines as gene therapy products, but now they are recognized as genetic vaccines.

02:43:45.970 --> 02:43:54.177
Critics argue that by treating these vaccines as traditional vaccines rather than genetic vaccine platforms, regulators may have bypassed certain safety checks.

02:43:54.697 --> 02:44:11.751
There was a strong effort to deny that this was gene therapy technology because if it was acknowledged that it was gene therapy technology used for vaccination purposes, then a whole different set of regulatory tests would have had to been performed.

02:44:13.133 --> 02:44:14.354
I don't think that's the lie.

02:44:14.414 --> 02:44:25.903
I really think the lie is that if they would have said that it was old technology, then they would have to also admit that everybody in academia knows it would be absolutely ridiculous to use in healthy people.

02:44:33.806 --> 02:44:38.692
regulatory agencies and public health experts declare that mRNA vaccines underwent.

02:44:38.772 --> 02:44:49.185
Can you imagine if at any point on my stream, I just decided to cut to a, like a full length, you know, shot of me that was in slow motion going.

02:44:55.063 --> 02:45:13.557
And then maybe when I was turned around like this I would be facing like the downtown of Amsterdam and I would turn into the camera slow-mo with really crazy music like... I mean, would you take me seriously anymore?

02:45:14.558 --> 02:45:17.140
Like, what in the hell is going on here?

02:45:18.897 --> 02:45:25.344
rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations, both before and after approval, with no critical steps bypassed.

02:45:26.185 --> 02:45:30.070
They emphasize that these vaccines have saved millions of lives with minimal harm.

02:45:31.251 --> 02:45:34.314
And ongoing safety monitoring shows no significant risks.

02:45:36.336 --> 02:45:40.181
This vaccine, the mRNA vaccines, probably saved about three million lives.

02:45:44.346 --> 02:46:02.318
The former CDC director is skeptical about mRNA technology's future in vaccines, but sees promise in therapeutics, including... Can you understand how it is that if we have Steve Hatfield and Redfield playing a role in governing us on social media, it's a trap?

02:46:03.118 --> 02:46:16.943
If we have a guy who used to work for DITRA and DARPA and his best friends with David Hohn and used to work with Weiner and Koprowski and Offit all doing this shit to us, it's all one show.

02:46:18.284 --> 02:46:30.368
If they're all connected by mentors and training and, you know, I used to roll there, I used to roll there, I was at the same congressional meeting as you all those years ago, they aren't here by accident.

02:46:34.568 --> 02:46:35.488
for rare diseases.

02:46:35.908 --> 02:46:41.570
The mRNA technology will not be used in vaccines.

02:46:42.671 --> 02:46:44.271
OK, let's fast forward three years.

02:46:45.031 --> 02:46:49.673
But I do think the mRNA technology will be used in therapeutics.

02:46:54.195 --> 02:46:56.436
and the therapeutics will be personalized, right?

02:46:56.676 --> 02:47:08.383
And vaccines may be eventually admitted to be flawed and flawed based on, you know, the genetic background of people sometimes makes them vulnerable, you know, like that MTHR gene.

02:47:18.692 --> 02:47:22.475
After spending a lot of time and money on treatments, Toby and her husband.

02:47:22.515 --> 02:47:25.538
You see that those are the people who also wore masks, right?

02:47:25.598 --> 02:47:31.023
So those are the people that were most scared, most confused, and also did what they were told.

02:47:32.384 --> 02:47:41.512
So the Robert Malone, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Alex Jones weapon was not aimed at them.

02:47:43.954 --> 02:47:45.355
And face financial ruin.

02:47:47.532 --> 02:48:02.335
My injury has cost us over $70,000, and I don't even know if I can fully heal or, you know, it's definitely put me in the right direction, but it's landed us in financial ruins.

02:48:03.395 --> 02:48:12.537
And to where our credit's been ruined, we had to take out major loans, and now we're filing for bankruptcy.

02:48:13.057 --> 02:48:15.258
So it's- It's an interesting cross she's wearing.

02:48:16.106 --> 02:48:17.603
completely devastated us.

02:48:21.454 --> 02:48:26.818
If you have an adverse event or your child has an adverse event, you are on your own.

02:48:27.258 --> 02:48:30.641
From a compensation standpoint, you're literally hosed.

02:48:30.781 --> 02:48:31.521
You're hosed.

02:48:31.581 --> 02:48:39.567
And so that's one of the things that they're going to argue for in the near future is that we should put the COVID shot on the VICIP or whatever the hell it is.

02:48:40.248 --> 02:48:45.912
So that, you know, people like Aaron Seery can get paid while they fight for our rights or our settlement or some shit.

02:48:47.608 --> 02:48:52.371
That's part of the illusion of what they are fighting and what they're fighting for.

02:48:52.431 --> 02:48:54.372
It's not, it doesn't help anybody.

02:48:55.373 --> 02:49:00.996
The regulatory agencies and the pharma companies are completely immune to prosecution.

02:49:01.596 --> 02:49:06.619
So we can't sue them and try to get financial recourse after injuries.

02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:12.863
And so nobody is going to say here that that is a violation of a fundamental right.

02:49:14.451 --> 02:49:16.472
That's my constitutional right.

02:49:16.512 --> 02:49:21.514
Do you notice that nobody's actually saying that that's a constitutional right?

02:49:21.614 --> 02:49:23.214
I find that quite shocking.

02:49:23.894 --> 02:49:28.096
If you're making a movie and you are scripting something there.

02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:35.092
If you have an adverse event or your child has an adverse event, you are on your own.

02:49:35.552 --> 02:49:38.933
From a compensation standpoint, you're literally hosed.

02:49:39.673 --> 02:49:45.275
The regulatory agencies and the pharma companies are completely immune to prosecution.

02:49:45.895 --> 02:49:50.936
So we can't sue them and try to get financial recourse after our injuries.

02:49:51.156 --> 02:49:54.457
That is a violation of a constitutional right.

02:49:54.597 --> 02:49:56.198
It is a fundamental right.

02:49:57.182 --> 02:50:01.225
And the PrEP Act allows that to happen without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

02:50:01.666 --> 02:50:06.750
And there is a very, very malevolent reason why somebody with a Ph.D.

02:50:06.810 --> 02:50:19.381
in biology is able to talk so succinctly and sharply about this while lawyers like Bobby Ann Cox or Aaron Seery or frickin' Mendenhall, who all helped, uh,

02:50:20.041 --> 02:50:35.125
Grace's dad can't seem to get to this fundamental thing where this guy, this citizen of America should be saying at the end of that statement that it is my fundamental right to sue for damages over $20.

02:50:36.746 --> 02:50:42.548
It is my fundamental constitutional right to sue for damages over $20.

02:50:45.066 --> 02:50:50.250
And yet he is scripted not to say it's a constitutional right.

02:50:51.611 --> 02:51:05.421
Because then it might cue some lawyer to realize that, holy shit, that means the PREP Act could be struck as unconstitutional by a single circuit court because it violates the fundamental rights.

02:51:05.501 --> 02:51:09.203
It suspends fundamental rights without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

02:51:11.645 --> 02:51:12.706
Holy shit.

02:51:13.902 --> 02:51:16.005
Can you see how malevolent this is?

02:51:16.085 --> 02:51:23.615
It's as malevolent as the loss that is being turned into a win by Grace's dad.

02:51:27.379 --> 02:51:28.741
This is really awful.

02:51:30.443 --> 02:51:32.186
And it's wrong, it's evil.

02:51:38.405 --> 02:51:45.068
That's the guy who lost a hockey playing kid in Canada and they're using him, using him like a rag doll.

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:47.869
These people are abandoned.

02:51:48.489 --> 02:51:56.613
Many people are devastated from the standpoint of their finances, they're physically devastated and they're often emotionally devastated.

02:52:01.854 --> 02:52:08.218
Paul Merrick and his team at the Independent Medical Alliance are tirelessly... My God, is that guy a piece of shit.

02:52:08.959 --> 02:52:14.843
Pierre Cory is one of the most fraudulent, traitorous Americans alive.

02:52:16.283 --> 02:52:21.347
...researching and developing treatment protocols for long-term COVID and COVID vaccine injuries.

02:52:23.985 --> 02:52:31.734
wow look who else was there holy shit that indian dude was there too that is freaking amazing

02:52:32.645 --> 02:52:34.867
Mr. Bean, holy shit.

02:52:34.887 --> 02:52:38.971
Clearly there are people out there suffering and they're often desperate.

02:52:39.331 --> 02:52:43.815
The focus of this conference is on spark related disease.

02:52:44.236 --> 02:52:44.996
Oh no, okay.

02:52:45.036 --> 02:52:51.582
He was at the, he was at the FLCCC conference, not at the, but it was at the FLCC conference.

02:52:51.602 --> 02:52:57.528
So before they changed their name to IMA and gave themselves over to that Spanish guy, um,

02:52:58.979 --> 02:53:05.404
Dr. Bean was at one of those places where also this guy was and Corey was and Ryan Cole was.

02:53:05.464 --> 02:53:07.785
So that's pretty, that's pretty hardcore.

02:53:07.865 --> 02:53:15.991
You know, vaccine injured and the people here are really, their mission is to help those that are less fortunate and those that have suffered.

02:53:16.011 --> 02:53:18.553
All right, spike protein.

02:53:18.813 --> 02:53:21.955
Obviously the conferences around spike protein.

02:53:21.995 --> 02:53:22.436
There's the...

02:53:23.615 --> 02:53:27.876
There's the virus, talking about the spike protein, but we got to show you where it is in the virus.

02:53:28.296 --> 02:53:29.037
Stop lying!

02:53:29.477 --> 02:53:29.937
Wow.

02:53:30.797 --> 02:53:31.217
Wow.

02:53:31.877 --> 02:53:34.318
I also want to thank Brad Dressen, who's my co-chair of React 19.

02:53:34.478 --> 02:53:46.642
Yeah, I'm pretty sure React 19 is the same thing that was starting at the original CHD conference with black and yellow writing, and now they've changed the coloring of the logo and stuff like that, but it's the same thing, I'm sure.

02:53:47.810 --> 02:54:01.121
This is a time when we all can share our individual experiences with regards to COVID and those injured by the COVID shots and be able to collaborate and try to hopefully move forward.

02:54:01.342 --> 02:54:06.946
So nowhere in this conference are they going to question the idea that maybe they just murdered a lot of people and lied about it.

02:54:06.967 --> 02:54:09.849
Maybe they just managed the population pyramid and lied about it.

02:54:09.889 --> 02:54:11.611
Maybe they just let opioids go nuts.

02:54:12.271 --> 02:54:15.194
Nowhere in this conference because they all accept COVID.

02:54:16.072 --> 02:54:17.653
COVID and the COVID spike.

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:23.697
To develop better diagnostics and treatments.

02:54:23.857 --> 02:54:38.007
It could be that it's Kirsch's nonprofit organization, but I'm just saying that at the second CHD conference, they were already there and they had a very big booth, a top level right next to CHD's booth.

02:54:38.147 --> 02:54:42.710
So that's pretty, you know, they weren't down with the rest of the vendors, let's put it that way.

02:54:43.677 --> 02:54:47.439
It's really hard to understand this unless you're living it.

02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:53.323
This experience has been the most isolating experience of my life.

02:54:53.403 --> 02:55:08.952
Okay, not to belittle her experience, but this has also been the most isolating experience of my life, trying to explain to people how all of these people are coordinated, scripted actors, because otherwise, I can't explain the last six years of my life

02:55:09.392 --> 02:55:24.942
and all this weird interactions I've had on my phone and social media with all these people that are all in this movie now, pretending like they've never heard of me, or transfection, or population pyramids, or infectious clones, or holy shit.

02:55:27.583 --> 02:55:33.047
So I can't wait to be around my fellow Vaxxed injured.

02:55:42.608 --> 02:55:48.632
But also the doctors at the frontline COVID critical care because they have been tremendous.

02:55:48.712 --> 02:55:53.855
Dr. Merrick has been an angel within the community.

02:55:53.875 --> 02:56:06.642
The team we have are truly... I have no doubt in my mind that this guy is an unwitting participant and bless his heart, man oh man, they focused a lot of energy on him and have used him like a rag doll.

02:56:07.828 --> 02:56:08.409
Oh, it's awful.

02:56:08.829 --> 02:56:12.873
The outstanding people who absolutely committed to what we're doing.

02:56:12.893 --> 02:56:16.036
It's like a family, you know, these are my family.

02:56:16.456 --> 02:56:19.739
I think our goal is to educate, to empower people.

02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:21.781
Are you going to succeed in this goal?

02:56:22.362 --> 02:56:22.802
Of course.

02:56:22.822 --> 02:56:25.205
I mean, there's absolutely no way we can fail.

02:56:25.405 --> 02:56:27.427
I think, you know, we've come this far.

02:56:31.701 --> 02:56:36.064
You can just see the affection and kindness of the people that are here.

02:56:36.204 --> 02:56:38.246
I mean, think about the logo, right?

02:56:38.326 --> 02:56:46.612
The logo is... This is part of a community and I hope this community will grow bigger.

02:56:46.672 --> 02:56:49.174
The logo has a red C in the middle.

02:56:50.914 --> 02:56:54.978
A red C. So there's no doubt that this is about COVID.

02:56:55.518 --> 02:56:56.820
That COVID is real.

02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:01.704
It's so real that you only need to have a red C to represent it right in the middle of your logo.

02:57:03.806 --> 02:57:12.635
To the extent that we will be able to persuade other people to see the truth and to see the light, because that's what we stand for.

02:57:13.416 --> 02:57:14.657
And the truth should prevail.

02:57:15.248 --> 02:57:22.396
I think Merrick's an absolutely good guy too, and I think he would be absolutely devastated to find out that these people have been playing him for five years.

02:57:22.816 --> 02:57:23.577
At all costs.

02:57:24.358 --> 02:57:28.563
And the sacrifices we continue to make to get the truth out there will continue.

02:57:29.063 --> 02:57:30.324
And so I would encourage people, wake up.

02:57:31.863 --> 02:57:35.744
The truth is the most sensational thing that you could ever report.

02:57:35.944 --> 02:57:38.185
It's always going to be what people want to hear.

02:57:38.805 --> 02:57:41.846
We must continue to speak our truth.

02:57:42.306 --> 02:57:44.286
We fight evil through love.

02:57:44.767 --> 02:57:53.529
To the extent that we will be able to persuade other people to see the truth and to see the light, because that's what we stand for.

02:57:54.352 --> 02:57:57.153
And the truth should prevail at all costs.

02:57:57.934 --> 02:58:02.096
And the sacrifices we continue to make to get the truth out there will continue.

02:58:02.616 --> 02:58:03.877
And so I would encourage people, wake up.

02:58:05.433 --> 02:58:09.315
The truth is the most sensational thing that you could ever report.

02:58:09.335 --> 02:58:11.757
It's always going to be what people want to hear.

02:58:12.377 --> 02:58:15.379
We must continue to speak our truth.

02:58:15.879 --> 02:58:16.939
We fight evil through love.

02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:23.323
What we're about at React 19 is really spreading love and caring for our fellow human beings.

02:58:24.003 --> 02:58:29.386
And I really think, in the end, that's the story that will defeat the evil that we're up against.

02:58:31.107 --> 02:58:33.709
If this film matters to you, please share it and help...

02:58:34.853 --> 02:58:39.176
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth, both as a process and an endpoint.

02:58:41.598 --> 02:58:51.686
Placebo is how they made it safe enough, and non-specific PCR tests are how they got away with making us believe we were Ghostbusters and fighting something that wasn't there.

02:58:52.246 --> 02:58:54.868
They lied about a population pyramid, ladies and gentlemen.

02:58:55.249 --> 02:58:58.071
This is for all the marbles, that's why those people are out there.

02:58:58.491 --> 02:59:02.274
And that's also why we are a huge problem because we can see them very clearly.

02:59:02.334 --> 02:59:03.314
I hope you can too.

02:59:03.794 --> 02:59:06.256
I hope I brought them a little bit better in focus for you.

02:59:07.117 --> 02:59:20.105
Make sure you understand that those people that I just showed you in that video are the people who are trying to tell you that the DoD is deploying a kill box, that the shot was a bioweapon, and that pandemics do not occur naturally.

02:59:21.045 --> 02:59:27.233
And these are extremely inaccurate, very malevolent bad ideas.

02:59:27.333 --> 02:59:37.426
Because the reality is, intramuscular injection's a very terrible idea from the late 1800s, transfection in healthy humans was always a crime, and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:59:37.486 --> 02:59:38.207
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:00:29.289 --> 03:00:31.172
You all are very welcome.

03:00:31.232 --> 03:00:32.554
I will see you tomorrow for sure.
