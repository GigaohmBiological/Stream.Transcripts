01:00.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh time out JC on the bike. JC on the bike.

01:16.000 --> 01:28.000
It's JC on the bike. It's JC on the bike yeah. Well I'm wise enough to know when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Look at round. It's JC on the bike. Who says Veda didn't study music in college?

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
If you're not aware of the early COVID survivors website hosted by usatoniclive please check it out.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
The Mark Force podcast has been rocking lately. The last two episodes have been fantastic. It's an exciting list.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
It's an exciting list that as it populates seems to be really tying a lot of loose ends together.

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:07.000 --> 02:17.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

02:17.000 --> 02:32.000
We're considering doing a fundraiser for the early COVID survivors. Stay tuned. We might do a New Year's Eve telethon actually to raise money for the early COVID survivors.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
Just stay tuned to useatoniclive and to get your own biological for more details.

02:40.000 --> 03:09.000
I tell you those early COVID survivors they have endured everything that is imaginable in a martyr and a sacrificial lamb

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Also a victim of cancellation. I mean these people have suffered in ways that we can't understand.

03:15.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm really happy that Mark is calling attention to them while I simultaneously call attention to the biology that's gone out of black.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
That was a funny transition.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
The early COVID survivor, oh my goodness, I sent some sarcasm there.

03:42.000 --> 03:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the faith we are trying to dispel. We got into the wrong car on this road, ladies and gentlemen. This is Gigaohm Biological.

03:56.000 --> 04:12.000
Oh man, I don't know what to say about shedding. I don't like that topic very much.

04:12.000 --> 04:25.000
There is reasonable biological basis for shedding depending on how successful the the transfection is.

04:25.000 --> 04:35.000
There is reason to believe that shedding is possible. Just take an eat raw garlic for a few days and tell me that your sweat doesn't smell different.

04:35.000 --> 04:45.000
Tell me that your skin doesn't smell different and tell me that your body isn't excreting some of those compounds through your sweat glands and in your breath.

04:45.000 --> 04:55.000
And this isn't any different than a small protein or a protein fragment being shed part of an exosome or not.

04:56.000 --> 05:18.000
Shedding is something that it's hard to discount as wholly implausible, but on the other hand, what shedding does is it suggests that this technology is especially successful in producing protein and my guess is only in the best case scenario.

05:18.000 --> 05:30.000
But you know what, I'm just throwing things out there at this stage. We really don't know because transfection has never been adequately evaluated in this format in healthy people.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
And so I can wax intellectual all day long and so can everybody else. But the bottom line is that what you can expect is things to go wrong.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
Some of the things that go wrong there may include shedding, but I think most of the things that go wrong are going to be local.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
They're going to be things that go wrong with your own system.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
And those can include autoimmunity. Those could include protein misfolding.

05:54.000 --> 06:07.000
And I think that's why there were quite a few characters very early on in the narrative who were already seeding the idea that the novel spike protein or the bioweapon spike protein was capable of

06:07.000 --> 06:21.000
causing amyloid or capable of causing prion disease in the virus so that when the inevitable consequences of transfection were realized and amyloidosis was one of them or

06:21.000 --> 06:30.000
occasionally prion disease was one of them that this would already be covered by the viral story that was seeded at the very beginning of the pandemic.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
On a whole different sides of the internet using algorithmic plugging.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
And I think that's really what we're dealing with here is the our inability to see through the veil.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
You know, even even the idea that some of these people that picked us up on the road were innocent at some point.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
It's possible that none of them were ever not in on it.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And so again, I can't stress enough how important it is that you share the work.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
If you find it valuable, that's the best way that you can support Gigaohm biological, but Gigaohm biological is also supported through a subscriber base.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
It's pretty limited, but to all of those people, I am very thankful and some of them have been contributing for several years now.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
And it's really the reason why I can't really hang up the stream and still think I need to keep fighting.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm not saying that I'm going to quit, but it does make it much easier to keep going because it's a lot of hours and a lot of work.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And so I really do appreciate it.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But again, sharing the stream is most important.

07:31.000 --> 07:43.000
So I am not asking for financial donations off the top of my head, but just saying that I do receive them and I do accept them and they are valuable to me and my family.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
The gain of function worst case scenario is the thing we're mostly fighting now.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
And it is with great humility that I declare that this is what we're fighting.

08:00.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm not sure if I was by any stretch of the imagination, even close to the first person to articulate the gain of function in coronaviruses was a mythology.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
And I may even be guilty of resisting this idea for a while.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
And I'm feeling very humble about where I am now after four years.

08:26.000 --> 08:39.000
I think I could have been farther much earlier had there not been the significant level of meddling that went on behind the scenes and and in front of our eyes and in front of us on TV.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And so here we are with six books that basically all tell the same story.

08:44.000 --> 09:01.000
I was able to contribute a little bit to the Wuhan cover up in the sense that there are infectious clones in there. There's RNA in lack of fidelity and RNA copying and there's a few other things in there that hint at the idea that coronaviruses may not be all there cracked up to be.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
But the book is still the same as every one of those books there.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
And I knew that from the beginning.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
The book was 70% written when I started.

09:10.000 --> 09:19.000
And so we're doing the best we can trying to push back against this, but we've all come to this realization too late.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And so we've got extra work to do.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
We've got extra work to do because we've really got to push back on this novel virus because other people are not doing it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
The people that are controlling the narrative are not doing it.

09:32.000 --> 09:41.000
And so I'm going to go back to this analogy because I really do think it's valuable and I'm going to keep telling it until I get it right.

09:41.000 --> 09:54.000
But you've got to think about the start of the pandemic is getting lost on the road in the middle of the night with some kind of new biological phenomenon floating over your head that you don't really understand you're all by yourself.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
And you're hoping that somebody's going to give you a ride somewhere, but you don't even know how you got on this road. You're just all isolated and confused.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
You don't have to go to work anymore. They're telling you that something going around that can kill your grandma.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
Maybe it was released from a laboratory according to some of the crazy people on the internet.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And then some people came and picked you up and gave you a ride.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
It was a car full of people, though. It wasn't just one guy, but it was a person in the driver's seat, a person in the passenger seat, and a person in the backseat.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
And they offered you the fourth seat in the car.

10:33.000 --> 10:44.000
And who are these people? Well, they're these people that we all encountered on the internet in 2020 that we all thought were fighting for us in 2021.

10:45.000 --> 11:00.000
They picked us up in this car and basically bamboozled us with an illusion of consensus about a novel virus that killed millions of people that for which we had to do something that millions of people were saved from likely came from gain of function.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
And therefore will likely happen again. Only next time it'll be much worse.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
And so we've been riding in this car with people like who are on the last screen there.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
And some of them have unwittingly participated in this scheme.

11:17.000 --> 11:30.000
Others of them have participated in it and willingly as a result of their knowledge that we've been governed by this mythology for a long time, that it's always been the intention to govern us by this mythology.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
They have been preparing for this controlled demolition of the American system for quite some time.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
And I think we need to really seriously understand that the alarm is now.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
We don't have much time to pull out of the who and pull out of the UN and take our sovereignty back.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
We don't have that much time. It may already technically be impossible because of the way that the financial system has been legally orchestrated.

12:03.000 --> 12:27.000
At some point we're going to have to watch the Great Taking by David Webb because it may be the best description for how the financial system around the globe has been conscripted legally over the last decade to essentially make it possible to institute a governance structure above that of the national level without our ever being able to consent to it or not.

12:28.000 --> 12:41.000
And now what I want you to understand is that the people that picked you up on this road trip, the people that picked you up on this road trip may very well be aware that this is the intentional shift that's coming.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Maybe even an inevitable one.

12:47.000 --> 13:07.000
We can't be sure exactly what kinds of forces are arrayed against us, but there are numbers of different competing piles of weaponized money, weaponized piles of money that are working against us and probably competing with each other at the same time behind this narrative.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
And so we don't even know which of the groups we got in the car with.

13:13.000 --> 13:30.000
Did we get in the car with the group that wants us to think that the baddest baddies are the Chinese or did we get in the group of the car that is working on behalf of the European interests or the city of London?

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
Did we get into the car that's working on the interest of the large pharmaceutical companies, if that's even an interest?

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
We don't even know what teams are in the background orchestrating this event to try and usurp our national sovereignty system.

13:48.000 --> 14:08.000
But somebody is, and many of these people who we have turned to for leadership are actually already aware that this transition is about to take place and are already aware and are auditioning for positions on the other side of that transition, I assure you.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
It is the only logical explanation for the drama that we have been subject to in this car ride.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
The drama about previous vaccinations and how sure they are that they work.

14:21.000 --> 14:32.000
The unquestioning of this novel virus jumping from species, the unquestioning use of PCR or asymptomatic spread, the unquestioning of the variants,

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
and the unquestioning of gain of function research as a even greater danger than that of mother nature.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
And so this faith in a novel virus is fully safe from all these people that picked us up on this road.

14:49.000 --> 14:57.000
All these people that picked us up on this road are spreading the bad ideas that don't get us out and they're much more dangerous than any spreading RNA molecule.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
This illusion of consensus that they spread is much more dangerous because it gets people to behave irrationally to ditch their families.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
To go against what they should have known as common sense principles.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
To go against what they should have known about the sacredness of certain aspects of biology.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
It's not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That's what the intellectual dark web is all about.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
That's what these two guys right here brought Weinstein's right there.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Brett Weinstein is right up there and then Dave Rubin is right here.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Dave Rubin is right there.

15:45.000 --> 15:57.000
The original OG members of the intellectual dark web sitting at the original dinner table with Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein and Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
That's what this is.

16:02.000 --> 16:11.000
Pre-conceived limited spectrum of debate controlled by these guys who have a very lively debate within that spectrum.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Listen to them give each other compliments like they weren't already on an organized team.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
This is just from like a few days ago.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
What you were doing and what we were all doing you know IDW doesn't exist.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
But it was a very important stage in something that I think doesn't have a name at the moment.

16:35.000 --> 16:57.000
What you were doing was somehow a prototype of what you are doing and I think there's meaningful progress if you look across that whole arc and anyway I appreciate it and I think it's important stuff so keep it up.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
I should probably end right there.

17:00.000 --> 17:13.000
And so that was just them plugging each other right and saying how great they are and how awesome they've been such dissidents and they're so confused by the current system and it's really great that you're such a leader and yada yada yada.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
We should do another show together.

17:16.000 --> 17:27.000
Well here's from today's podcast I've got it going at two times the speed and you're not even going to really notice it's just going to sound like Brett's talking into normal speed.

17:28.000 --> 17:46.000
Try to tolerate his verboseness and what he's basically going to do is walk you through the hypothetical of how do we tell if the number of people that are dying in our little anecdotal circle of friends and family is something significant.

17:47.000 --> 18:08.000
And then he doesn't really get very precise like he always doesn't and basically boils it down to either you died from the virus or you died from the shot and excess deaths are pretty high right now and he has no real explanation for that he doesn't try to delve into it at all.

18:08.000 --> 18:19.000
And he wastes an awful lot of time not talking about Denis' data and for whatever reason he's not able to show the real graphs of Denis' data that show any significant findings.

18:20.000 --> 18:34.000
He does say that Denis' name a couple times and he does say that it's worth looking at I don't know if there are links in the bottom of this video I highly doubt it he's not like you know going to tell you to go to DenisRancourt.com or anything like that.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
And more importantly he's not going to delve into anything else that Denis has ever done even though he went all the way around the world to Romania and met Denis on stage.

18:48.000 --> 19:00.000
He didn't bother to find out all the other things that Denis did including Denis' most powerful analysis of the data in America that shows that there's no geographic evidence of spread from one geographic center to another.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
From one county to another the virus and these deaths do not cross state lines or county lines and that's a problem.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
And he's found this all over the world there is no real evidence of a spreading pathogen.

19:18.000 --> 19:40.000
And that's why there's no increase steady all-cause mortality increase in 2020 because the all-cause mortality increases that were said to be spread were so geographically isolated that on the average across the United States you don't really see a signal until the shot rolls out.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
That's very significant it's not the same as saying there was no all-cause mortality increase in 2020.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
It's very imprecise because in certain locations there were huge increases in all-cause mortality.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But on average you do not see it.

20:01.000 --> 20:27.000
And so very very carefully now with very precise description of his data very very honest recapitulation of Denis' data would reveal those two things that excess deaths are higher after the shot and that there's no evidence of geographic spread in the excess deaths that we see in 2020.

20:31.000 --> 20:53.000
And just like Robert Malone he is going to use it to exclusively talk about the increase in all-cause mortality that may be indirectly or directly related to the shot and talk about it as verbose and imprecisely as possible in order to make sure that in the end you're not really that curious about Denis' data.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You're never going to go look it up.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And then they end it.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
So it's about ten minutes I'm going to try and let it play I just you know I might stop at once but I think I'm just going to let it play.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And just remember what we're trying to listen for.

21:08.000 --> 21:22.000
We're trying to listen for an honest accounting of the fact that they killed people with ventilators with lack of antibiotics with misuse of steroids with the Remdesivir, Madazalam, and sending people back to the hospital.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
We're trying to get back to old folks homes instead of caring for them in hospitals.

21:27.000 --> 21:36.000
The list is quite substantial quite solid quite uniform across the United States and even in places around the world.

21:36.000 --> 21:51.000
So we really need to be honest in our accounting and it seems for some reason after four years the leaders of the intellectual dark web are still absolutely incapable of counting beyond the novel virus and beyond the

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
intersection which they still can't find the word transfection for.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
After four years.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
Example OK the problem is if I'm stuck with my anecdotal encounter with the world and this pattern.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
We can do the same thing for the pattern of violence in our cities then I have no way of decisively answering the question.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
The only thing I can do is say does the pattern continue to match the does the pattern continue to anecdotally match the predictions of the model I have that there is something new and dangerous.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
If I say that loose there's no that loose is that loose in the world.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, I have to do over I would just say loose in the world noted.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Now is that already imprecise sorry I didn't know I wasn't going to stop it but that's already very imprecise right.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
He's already talking about something new and deadly loose in the world that's not very precise.

22:43.000 --> 22:58.000
That sure sounds like a virus to me it doesn't sound like a shot it doesn't sound like transfection or a methodology of gene gene manipulation or gene therapy that's being mislabeled or misused or mis.

22:58.000 --> 23:08.000
Applied to a healthy population it sounds like something is loose like biologically a pattern integrity loose on the I mean come on.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
I hope you can see this already how just painful this is.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Awesome I feel we're making progress.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
So what I wanted to do now is show what you do if you actually want to take that anecdotal pattern and the hypothesis that results from it and get rigorous.

23:22.000 --> 23:35.000
And if you would show there was a excellent talk at the COVID summit in Romania I'm not going to show you the talk it's worth the 25 minutes or so to watch it but this is Dennis Raincourt that's what it looked like in the auditorium.

23:35.000 --> 23:50.000
And Dennis Raincourt is a physicist who has gone and analyzed the all cause mortality data from around the world he's looked at countries different countries he's looked at very different timescales and so here take a look this is the pattern of all cause mortality

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
by month over a hundred years 70.

23:55.000 --> 24:03.000
What you'll see is a pattern of spikes and troughs that your mind will correctly register as highly regular.

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
Now what that highly regular pattern is is an oscillation of seasons and for reasons that Raincourt correctly points out are not fully understood.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
There is an increasing all cause mortality that means we don't care what you died of the question is we just count deaths and we look at the pattern.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
People tend to die in the winter and they tend to die much less in the summer and the exact reason for that is not perfectly understood.

24:22.000 --> 24:39.000
Now I would argue that the likely explanation for this is somewhere in the neighborhood of we all have some proximity to death at every moment a force with which the grave pulls at us.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
That force is quite strong.

24:41.000 --> 24:51.000
So is he he's anthropomorphizing the grave as it pulls on you and generates this seasonal variability in death.

24:51.000 --> 25:10.000
He's wasting I mean this is at double speed he's wasting time explaining people the reasonably well understood or accepted phenomenon that the death rate fluctuates seasonally it could be a combination of a lot of things we understand that.

25:11.000 --> 25:26.000
There's no reason to waste any time on it unless the whole idea is to tire you out so that the actual impact of anything that Denis Rancourt has done will be lost on you because number one he's not going to show it to you and number two he's not going to tell it to you and number three.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000
He's going to use an extraordinary number of words not to tell or show you it.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
In the first year of life.

25:36.000 --> 25:49.000
It decreases radically over that year if you survive to one year of age that force pulling you towards the grave tends to be flat until you reach the age of sexual maturity at which point it begins to very gradually on an accelerating pattern increase until it's quite precipitous.

25:49.000 --> 25:58.000
Late in life and then there is arguably a plateau largely due to what is likely a decrease in your risk of cancer if you live through the period in which cancer has skyrocketed.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
In any case interesting that the data if you plot it out reveal this highly regular pattern and as predicted this is a northern hemisphere this is France data you're looking at here.

26:06.000 --> 26:17.000
Very interesting and of course necessary that it be this way if we look at the southern hemisphere where the pattern of seasons is inverted then the pattern of spikes and drops is inverted as it would have to be otherwise the explanation would be falsified by it.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
So anyway that's what the general pattern looks like.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Can you show the next graph.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Okay so maybe I didn't capture the other graph you want to show his bulleted list.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
So here's I don't know what you mean said his son Zach.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
So he had one graph and it was a graph that went up to 2020 so actually he showed nothing.

26:39.000 --> 26:50.000
He showed absolutely nothing of the rise of all cause mortality none nothing significant here has been shown not one graph has been shared.

26:50.000 --> 26:58.000
No website nothing no links no QR code nothing there to tell you where Denis' website is.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
He's pronouncing his name as rain court.

27:06.000 --> 27:17.000
I presume it's Denis Ran Court like you know kind of like the French I don't I'm not you know but it ain't rain core.

27:17.000 --> 27:27.000
You think if you went all the way around the world and met this guy and saw this brilliant presentation that you either would have gotten more slides which I think are downloadable.

27:27.000 --> 27:37.000
If you really wanted to share the data you might have learned to present it a little better maybe chosen to successive figures to make the point.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
But you know that the dark horse podcast never does that.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
These figures are tough.

27:45.000 --> 27:54.000
Teaching anything is not the goal here it's just you know to wax intellectual for a while.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
It's to run out the clock is what we're starting to think it is.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
We're basically just running out the clock.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Tell the next big thing whatever is going to happen.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
Cyber war crash of the internet bring in the digital currency for everybody that wants bread I don't know.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
But these people seem to be running out the clock.

28:18.000 --> 28:32.000
When really what we need to be doing is pulling the fire alarm and saying we need to get out of the who we need to get out of the UN we need to take back our treasury we need to figure out how we are going to fix this problem in the United States without the guidance

28:32.000 --> 28:44.000
and the help of these people in these banks and in these corporations in these commercial banks that have completely bankrupt the United States.

28:44.000 --> 29:01.000
I'm not an economist I'm not some kind of finance guy but I definitely know that fractional reserve banking has been abused for too many hundreds of years and abused in such a way as to sap all of the real value and wealth from the United States.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
It's gone already probably.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
And so it's up to us each and every one of us Americans to regain ownership over our country.

29:14.000 --> 29:23.000
And I don't have a good plan for how to do it but I assure you that these people are running out the clock on that idea they are not interested in that idea.

29:23.000 --> 29:33.000
So if we've got some good ideas let's start throwing them out there let's send emails let's talk about it let's figure out how to do it if we've got to run for office then we've all got to do it.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
Maybe Mark Koolack needs to run in Massachusetts I don't know.

29:38.000 --> 29:46.000
Maybe we can find a person to run in every state I don't know maybe something has to happen though because this is not working anymore.

29:47.000 --> 29:56.000
These people are not helping us anymore we are hamsters in a wheel with these people.

29:56.000 --> 30:08.000
And these people are responsible for the worst case scenario narrative that kept us all trapped that fooled us all into thinking that the mystery to solve was whether this was a gain of function or lab leak not whether anybody was killing anybody.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
And so let's listen to see if Brett knows how many people have been killed or even cares.

30:13.000 --> 30:31.000
The upshot from this extremely carefully done research and I want to call your attention to especially number five number four on this list 17 million vaccine deaths worldwide to the present plus or minus half a million.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
That is incredibly high number and of course the number of inoculations given was staggering.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
Obviously we're not just talking about billions of people who were inoculated but many of them inoculated multiple times elsewhere in this talk and again I encourage you to go look at it.

30:43.000 --> 30:53.000
He points out that the risk goes up rather precipitously with the number of doses you've had becoming quite high at the fourth dose.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
Interesting I wasn't there I was going to talk but the fifth point on this list fatal toxicity is exponential with age with risk of death doubling every 45 years of age.

31:00.000 --> 31:14.000
That is not counter to but is the the opposite direction of what we have talked about anecdotally what it seems to be the case not with regard to fatality but adverse events wherein in 2022 when we were talking about the insanity of giving

31:14.000 --> 31:27.000
these vaccines to young people the point was that COVID is simultaneously a disease that does not affect the young very much see in 2022 to be talking about the insanity of giving it to young people was not talking about the insanity of giving it to

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
the old people.

31:32.000 --> 31:56.000
It was not talking about the insanity of treating any old person for the circulating virus that there is no evidence for so there's still an acceptance of the narrative in 2022 if you're arguing for the little kids not getting the shot you still haven't figured it out

31:56.000 --> 32:14.000
that the shot should have never been justified for anyone because they killed people and the fact that they used Remdesivir and lack of antibiotics and misuse of steroids and Madazzalam in the UK and elsewhere and all of this other stuff to create

32:14.000 --> 32:34.000
these local mass casualty events that were misconstrued as spread using models and exaggeration on TV and lack of context with regard to all cause mortality that's how they justified this and they don't seem to be wanting to be aware of that

32:35.000 --> 32:44.000
they don't want to acknowledge that in order for this to have been rolled out they needed to kill people

32:44.000 --> 32:54.000
and at the very very least every single one of us that was trying to figure this out in 2020 but didn't quite get there needs to admit that we we bought into this

32:55.000 --> 33:07.000
we bought it hook, line and sinker that something was going around that we could test for even if we thought that well the tests aren't perfect we still thought we could test for it

33:07.000 --> 33:21.000
we still told people that something was going around we still talked about natural immunity to that thing that was still going around I wrote a review about the thing going around

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
the reason why I wrote that review is because of people like Brett Weinstein

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
because of people like Brett Weinstein agreeing wholeheartedly with everything that was on television

33:33.000 --> 33:40.000
everything that was on social media going along with the masks going along with the social distancing

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
wondering about the possibilities of a lab leak in a worst case scenario

33:48.000 --> 33:58.000
lots of other people were doing it too lots of other people were in my circle of influencers people contacting me on the net telling me that's going to be a billion people dead you better be careful

33:58.000 --> 34:10.000
about how you say this because you could be responsible for the death of thousands or even millions of people by talking like you're talking right now Mr. Cooey

34:11.000 --> 34:24.000
and now in retrospect what I see are people that were meddling that were making sure that people who questioned the possibility of a worst case scenario were terrified to do so

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
and so all of these people are complicit in this murder all of them

34:30.000 --> 34:46.000
I tried my best to figure it out I tried my best to find out who was lying and it took me almost three years to get to the stage where I finally realized that maybe Mark Bailey wasn't wrong about COVID

34:47.000 --> 34:56.000
maybe Andy Kaufman wasn't wrong about them being able to not isolate and purify this virus

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
but then I think myself and I get back there and I think what in the hell happened then

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
why was it so hard for me to come to the realization that they were lying about this

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
why was it so hard for me to see through and then I look back and I think about all the people that I met

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
all the people that were talking to me behind the scenes

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
all the people that were in the car with me

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
and those people aren't insignificant people they're people that everybody on this watching this stream

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
everybody of the two thousand people that will watch this stream in the next day

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
they all know it they all know who these people are

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
who had me on their podcasts and broadcasts and on their panels

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
the illusion of consensus was strong on signal

36:00.000 --> 36:08.000
the illusion of consensus was strong on these apps and in these videos and in these forums

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
and these people are still reinforcing that

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
still doing it right now as of today this is them reporting on Denis Rancourt's data

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
and it's nothing it's a worthless report

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
because it doesn't question the fundamental need to roll out transfection

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
it doesn't question the fundamental basis for the rollout of the transfection

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
it doesn't question the fundamental basis of the narrative

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
we never needed any of this stuff

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
Ivermectin is just a thing that probably has a lot of different benefits

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
and Ivermectin is one of those things that Brett pushed so hard in the beginning

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
whole hard in 2020

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
oh my goodness and still pushing it now

37:02.000 --> 37:08.000
even though it's much more biologically plausible that that's just a drug that should be in everybody's medicine cabinet

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
just like hydroxychloroquine probably

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
and if we studied it correctly we'd understand when it's helpful

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
but instead it's just one of those millions of other probably substances that we don't use like we should use it

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
because it's cheap and free and organic

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
and can be grown in your backyard

37:30.000 --> 37:39.000
so for four years now we're just not going to talk about anything relevant

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
we're going to talk about the mystery virus

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
we're going to talk about solving that

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
we're going to talk about being dissidents

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and speaking out against the shots

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
that we can never seem to accurately deem transfection

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
even after two and a half years ago

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Heather and him both agreed

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
that Jay Kui's right they are transfections they're not really vaccines

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
but then we'll go back to call on them vaccines for two and a half more years

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
we wouldn't want to win

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
we can all go back and play the video

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
they actually admitted it on a podcast that they're really transfections

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
and Jay's right we should probably call them transfections not vaccines

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
and then they never call them transfections again

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
not that I watched every hour of their show anymore

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
maybe they did

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
but it sure didn't seem like it to me and they sure didn't say it today

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
you're getting tired of me calling out all the same people I'm sorry

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm not watching the chat tonight

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm sure everybody's getting tired of having Brett Weinstein called out

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
but this is one of the best examples out there

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
one of the best examples of what we're up against

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
this is what the illusion of consensus looks like

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
if you watch this podcast you are getting in Brett's car

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
and letting him tell you a story about what you see outside of the car

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and where he's taking you

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
and you don't know where that is

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
you don't know if that's toward a central bank digital currency

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
and digital ID

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
you don't know if that's toward genetic sampling of everybody

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
you don't know if that's toward informatic

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
bioinformatics on everyone

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
population control

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
he could be for all of that for all you know

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
they're not telling the truth

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
the problem is if I'm stuck with my anecdotal encounter with the world

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
and this pattern

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
we can do the same thing for the pattern of violence in our cities

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
then I have no way of decisively answering the question

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
the only thing I can do is say does the pattern continue to match

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
does the pattern continue to anecdotally match

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
the predictions of the model I have that there's something new and dangerous

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
at loose in the world

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
if I say at loose there's no at loose in the world

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
yeah

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
if I have to do over I would just say loose in the world

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
no did

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
awesome I feel we're making progress

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
so what I wanted to do now is show what you do

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
if you actually want to take that anecdotal pattern

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and the hypothesis that results from it

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
and get rigorous

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
and if you would show there was a excellent talk

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
sorry I went back I'm just going to let it play

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
because it's pretty fast

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I think it's pretty fast

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
five minutes or so

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
to watch it but this is Dennis Raincourt

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
that's what it looked like in the auditorium

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and Dennis Raincourt is a physicist who has gone

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
and analyzed the all-cause mortality data

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
from around the world

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
he's looked at countries different countries

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
he's looked at very different time scales

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and so here take a look this is

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
the pattern of all-cause mortality

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
by month over a hundred years

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
seventy

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
what you'll see

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
is a pattern of spikes and troughs

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
that your mind will correctly register

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
as highly regular

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
now what that highly regular pattern is

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
is an oscillation of seasons

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
and for reasons that Raincourt correctly points out

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
are not fully understood

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
there is an increasing

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
all-cause mortality

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
that means we don't care what you died of

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
the question is we just count deaths and we look at the pattern

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
people tend to die in the winter

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and they tend to die much less in the summer

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and the exact reason for that is not perfectly understood

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
now I would argue that

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
the

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
the likely explanation for this

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
is somewhere in the neighborhood of

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
we all have some proximity to death

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
at every moment

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
a force with which the grave pulls at us

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
that force is quite strong

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
in the first year of life

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
it decreases radically over that year

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
if you survive to one year of age

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
that force pulling you towards the grave tends to

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
that was the grave pulling me down

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
sorry that was too much security at which point

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
it begins to very gradually in an accelerating pattern

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
increase until it's quite precipitous

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
late in life and then there is arguably

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
a plateau largely due to

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
what is likely a decrease in your risk of cancer

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
if you live through the period in which cancer has skyrocketed

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
but in any case interesting that the data

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
if you plot it out

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
reveal this highly regular pattern

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
it's predicted this is northern hemisphere

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
this is france data you're looking at here

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
very interesting and of course necessary that it be this way

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
if we look at the southern hemisphere where the

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
pattern of seasons is inverted

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
then the pattern of spikes and drops is inverted

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
as it would have to be otherwise the explanation would be falsified by it

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
so anyway that's what the general pattern looks like

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
can you show the next graph

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
okay so maybe I didn't capture the other graph

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
you want to show his bulleted list then

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
so here is the upshot from

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
this extremely carefully done research

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
and I want to call your attention

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
to

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
especially number five

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
number four on this list

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
17 million vaccine deaths worldwide

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
to the present

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
plus or minus half a million

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
that is an incredibly high number

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
now of course the number of inoculations given

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
was staggering

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
obviously we're not just talking about billions of people

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
who were inoculated but many of them inoculated multiple times

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
elsewhere in this talk and again I encourage you to go look at it

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
he points out that the risk goes up

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
precipitously with the number of doses you've had

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
becoming quite high

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
at the fourth dose

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
interesting I wasn't there I was going to talk

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
but the fifth point on this list fatal toxicity is exponential with age

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
with the risk of death doubling every 45 years of age

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
that is not counter to

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
but is the opposite direction of what we have talked about anecdotally

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
when it seems to be the case not with regard to fatality

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
but adverse events wherein

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
in 2022

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
when we were talking about the insanity of

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
giving these vaccines to young people

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
the point was that

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
COVID is simultaneously a disease that does not affect the young very much

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
and these vaccines seem to produce a greater number of adverse events in the young

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
that's got to be wrong

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
and I'm surprised that she went there

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
the additional adverse events

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
in the young

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
it was because when an old person

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
who's 70 years old

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
takes the vaccine and gets myocarditis

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and has a heart attack

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
it's not a vaccine adverse event

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
it's just an old person dying

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I don't think you can underestimate

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
the idea that when you give an old person a

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
transfection and they have a adverse event

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
it is so dismissable

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
it's not even funny

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
a stroke is dismissable

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
in a 65 year old person

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
they're not even going to worry about that

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
and especially if that stroke comes two weeks

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
after the shot instead of two hours

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and I don't think that you can

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
underestimate how important that is

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
because in young people

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
when the stroke happens

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
four months later

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
people are still willing to say

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
hey wait a minute

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Annie was 40 years old

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
she did

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
but when you're 65 years old

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
nobody cares

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
nobody's thinking that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
like oh wow he was fine

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
he should have lived longer

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and even when they do

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
the question is not really there

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
it's not statistically significant in their mind

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
and so I want you to understand

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
how sad it is

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
that it were here now

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
four years into the pandemic

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
people haven't reassessed

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
transfection

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
for the ridiculous

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
criminally negligent application

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
of a methodology that is

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
of any age

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
even after all this time

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
of arguing on the couch

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
two years ago with

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Robert Malone

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
about how it's some kind of

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
log made of fiberglass

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
in a way

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and the body has to be challenged

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
to not make auto-immunity

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
but somehow it's okay

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
to do that in old people

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
somehow it's okay

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
to transfect the endothelium

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
of old people but young people

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
are especially vulnerable

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
to adverse events

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
that's not a very

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
insightful interpretation

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
of the current data

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
that seems like pretty much

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
a pretty cutter

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
CDC FDA

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
best case scenario

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
for the rollout of a

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
transfection in a hurry

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I can't even believe

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I need to explain it

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
but it's so ridiculous

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and here we are

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
we're still not talking about the protocols

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
and how these whole things were justified

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
it's like that part of the story

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
in 2020 and half of 2021

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
they weren't objecting to anything

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
now we did not

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
we never said that it tends to kill the young more

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
but the myocarditis and pericoditis

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
specifically in young men and potentially

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
menstrual and pregnancy issues in young women

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
you know just because that's a young woman situation

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
but is more of an issue

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
in youth whereas he's finding fatal toxicity

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
increasing with age

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
so I wanted to actually navigate that a little bit

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
and this drawing from the research

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I did back when I was doing the telomere work

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
and deeply embedded in the evidence

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
surrounding senescence

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
which begins at the age of first reproduction

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
or average age of first reproduction

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
for your species

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
and continues to

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
to accelerate through life with

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
additional years

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
that process

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
is the empirical description

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
of the vulnerability that I was just describing

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
the force that is pulling you towards the grave

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
now on your 20th birthday

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
is so weak

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
now if you're a male you may be inclined to risky behaviors

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
and we can argue about what that pattern is

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
but from the point of view of the failure of your biological systems

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
at a critical level that would cause you to die

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
the force is extremely weak at 20 especially

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
in the prior world

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
before all the novel influences

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
you know you might now be a 20 year old with a metabolic disease

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
that would make you much more vulnerable but historically speaking

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
you would have had a very low degree of decrepitude at 20

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
maybe only a few years and accelerating at a very low rate

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and as you get older

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
the degree to which your systems are compromised

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
by this goes up and up and up

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
so if you imagine as Dr. Raincourt points out in his talk

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
if you imagine that the mRNA vaccines function as a toxin

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and I'm not sure that's exactly the right description

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
they are toxic but they are more than that

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
because of the way they interact with the immune system

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
yeah they are

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
they are a

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
complex toxin

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
indeed

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
transfection

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
does that not that word doesn't work

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
a toxin that keeps on giving

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
why would they just call it what it is

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
it's extraordinary

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I don't know what to say

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
but anyway the point is

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
if you imagine that every person that you encounter

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
is if you could look above their heads and there was a number

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
that indicated the degree to which the grave was pulling on them

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
then you would say well if you were to administer a toxin broadly across

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
all of them some of them that number

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
at which the grave is pulling towards them is so high

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
that it won't take very much right now that's the same thing

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
that we likely see in the seasonal pattern

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
right if you're very very close to death

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
then you know the insults that come along with winter

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
right might be enough to do it

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
if you're very healthy and young then it's not going to

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
and so in any case I think

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
in part we are

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
we are

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
hampered in our ability to understand what's going on

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
because death is such a focus

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
and the problem is death is a binary thing

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
whereas damage is not

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
right so to the extent that something damaging

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
has been released on the public and that that is measurable

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
in the death of people who were close enough

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
in proximity to the grave

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
that it pushed them over the edge right

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
and it will very rarely get somebody who's perfectly healthy

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and it will very frequently get people who were headed that direction

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
anyway and you know so we need

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
we need a better toolkit to think about these things

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
but my larger point is

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
if you anecdotally think that you're seeing a pattern

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
you're being denied information on what that pattern is

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
you're not allowed to know what these people died of

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
therefore if you start saying

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
oh it's another died suddenly and somebody says aha

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
this person was sick for seven years it's not a died suddenly

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
as a result of these inoculations because they were sick long

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
before these inoculations had ever been given to anybody

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
okay you went but

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
but if you were interested in figuring out okay

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
to what degree were these things causing that arm

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
is the fact that I seem to be seeing

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
not only anomalies in the number of people who seem to be dying

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
but also tragically

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
the number of people who seem to be

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
serious disruptions of pregnancy

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
yeah right so you know again

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
do they happen under normal circumstances of course

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
now what he's suggesting is that you could use all cause mortality

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
to answer some of these questions about you know

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
are these things being caused by a new

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
thing on the loose as he said

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
so he's still not being very very precise here

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
although I think for most listeners

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
you would surmise that he's mostly talking about the shots right now

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
but what's really crazy about it is

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
is that he doesn't even think about the possibility of re

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
assessing whether there was indeed a spreading

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
novel pathogen that was a new source of death in 2020

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
using the exact same analysis

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
even though Denis has done it for him

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
in his own country of the United States

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
and so while he's very happy

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
to tell you that all cause mortality seems to have revealed a signal

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
that shows that these mRNA shots may be responsible for injuring people

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
he's not at all interested in how this same analysis has revealed

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
the lack of geographic spread around the world

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
and the lack of an actual respiratory disease

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
killing anybody

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
he doesn't see it

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
and in a lot of ways that's a more significant finding

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
than the deaths due to the shots

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
it's what he succinctly described

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
on the Iverson show

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
Denis crushed it on the Iverson show

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
apparently Brett didn't get the memo

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
probably some of that normally happening during normal circumstances

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
is actually the result of other novel phenomena toxins in the environment

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
who knows metabolic diseases whatever the novel influences are

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
and then there would be an ancestral environment that was free of all those novel influences

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
presumably a very tiny rate of those things

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
why in large measure because the body is built

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
to not invest in projects that are fatally compromised

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
and so there's a very high rate of spontaneous abortion

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
which presumably is a result of the fact that the body is

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
looking at a pregnancy that's underway

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
and deciding whether it's a good enough benefit for you to invest in it

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
so anyway there are elegant systems in the body

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
they're disrupted by novelty

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
the fact that the public health campaign appears to have created

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
a huge quantity of excess death

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
something like 17 million people globally

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
and that's not even the cost of the public health campaign

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
that is the parent vaccine induced deaths to date

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
so think about in light of the model we've just before

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
think about what that actually implies

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
if damage was done by these inoculations

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
to a large fraction of the people who received them

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
and some small fraction of those people were being pulled towards the grave

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
at a strong enough level that they disappeared

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
and they ended up in our statistics

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
then the question is how many years of life are people actually being robbed of

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
what's the net effect and what is the total number of excess deaths

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
that will ultimately be attributable to this public health campaign

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
so all of those things are interesting

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
in addition to the deaths that were the result of other interventions

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
that were mandated ventilators

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
and then there's the question of even more difficult questions

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I don't exactly know how you study it

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
but there's the question of

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
given the treatments that turn out to work

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
that were denied to people

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
in order presumably to get them to accept

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
and here we go, hydroxychloroquine and ivermaculations

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
what would the number of excess deaths have been

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
how much lower would the excess mortality rate be

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
had drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
been administered more frequently

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
which is believable

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
which is the fact that rain court says in rain court

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
which is that you actually do not see a spike of excess deaths

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
that are related to covid

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
that they seem to be related to the measures that were mandated

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
in the aftermath of its announcement

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
right on this I mean

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
what did

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
okay so what does that mean Brett

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
are you going to draw the conclusion

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
that there wasn't a spreading pathogen then or not

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
are you going to draw the conclusion

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
that Denis drew

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
that he most assuredly said to you

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
in your face in Romania

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
on his talk

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
on the screen

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
in that empty hall

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
I mean are we joking here

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
did they just say it

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
like ventilators and stuff

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and actually Denis doesn't see

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
evidence of a particularly dangerous respiratory disease

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
but it looks like it is the interventions

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
that killed people

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
and so that means that we didn't need the shot at all

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
that means everybody that was waxing intellectual about bushmeat

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
being the possible source of this virus

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
is guilty

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
of making a very big mistake

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
with their very big platform

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
pushing a very big mythology

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
that killed a lot of very very very very very big numbers of people

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
they get that vaccine to us very very fast

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and how did they

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
been able to put together a story

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
in which the vaccine arrived exactly

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
coincident with the virus

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
then we would not have the control group

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
and we could not say this is excess mortality from COVID

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
which is to say oops 2020

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
basically nothing and this is so if the vaccine

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
would have been available when the pandemic happened

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
then we wouldn't have a control group

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
why is that?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
why wouldn't we have a control group then

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
we are telling stories

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
here ladies and gentlemen this is a mythology

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
being laid down and not even very accurately

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
or congruently

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
it's falling apart very rapidly here

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
because they are maintaining a faith

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
in something that doesn't exist

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
and they are inverting

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
what happened in 2020

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
into a health crisis that never occurred

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
isolated mass casualty events

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
were misconstrued

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
as the spread of a novel pathogen

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that never manifested itself

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
but instead

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
numbers were generated through the application

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
of protocols via financial incentives

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
from the top down

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
and because senior doctors were sent home

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
and because hospitals in the United States

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
are run by administrators

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
and residents were called to run

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the hospitals

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
under manned and understaffed

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
these protocols were enacted

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and people were killed

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
because antibiotics don't work on a viral pneumonia

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
because steroids aren't appropriate for COVID

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
because ventilators at a high setting

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
is what the CDC said to do

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
and we are running out of ventilators

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
and these people went along with it

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and they are still going along with it

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
because they are not talking about it

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
because they said ventilators under their breath

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
because they are not talking about all the other ways

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
that people were killed

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
and how excess deaths

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
are being tallied to one or two causes

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
the virus

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
or the shot

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
not to suicide

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
not to malnutrition

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
not to loneliness

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
not to isolation

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
not to opioid overdose

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and lack of resuscitation

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
not DNR notices

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
in places around the world

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
none of these things

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
are being tallied on their whiteboard

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
the shot

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
and the deadly virus

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
that's it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and then very imprecise language about

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
a new cause of death being loose

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
on the world

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
if you can't see it

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I feel bad for you

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
if you are still trying to

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
look away

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
from the fact that the only way this could happen

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the only form

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
of fifth-generation warfare

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
you need to worry about is people

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
participating in the governance structure

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
willingly

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
and these people were sat down in a room

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
and told that this is how

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
this is going to go down

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
these are the events that are going to come

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
in the future

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
if you want to be a part

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
of the governance structure

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
that orchestrates these coming events

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
these coming changes

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
these coming metamorphoses for our society

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
this is what you got to do

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
this is the narrative you got to sell

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
the more successful you are

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
it's selling the narrative the more there are

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
algorithms will raise your star

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
here's your job

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
here's your salary

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
go and do it

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and there are different levels and different layers

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
of this there are different players

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
in this there are different competing

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
interests in this but all these competing

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
interests have

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
a real vested

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
they really need this narrative to continue

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
they're doubled and tripled down because

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
they thought they could get us all in

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
and we're not all in

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
and now they have a very big problem

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
on their hands

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
because this is not a lie they can undo

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
it's not a lie they can back out of

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
until the past is erased

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
and forgotten

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
as long as the past is still in video

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
as long as we can still see

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and listen to the eighth podcast

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
of Brett Weinstein

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
in December of 2019

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Sam Harris agree

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
that when the real big pandemic comes

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
there won't be any room to tolerate

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
the anti-vax mentality

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
as long as that video

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and that audio exists

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
there is evidence for what

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
has been done to us

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
as long as the video

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
evidence of Robert Malone

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
being on a stream

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
with Paul Cottrell exists

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
then there is evidence for how this was done

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
as long as there is video

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
and audio evidence of George Webb saying

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
that the greatest hero of the pandemic

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
is Paul Cottrell

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
there is evidence for the team

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
of worst-case scenario people

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
ceding that narrative

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
of a Chinese lab leak

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
from the very very beginning

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
in a possible worst-case scenario

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
to make sure

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
that this train left the station

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
without any doubt

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and these people

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
were all in it.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
They are all complicit

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
in the eventual murder of Americans

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and people around the world

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
but particularly

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
murder of Americans

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
to seed the mass casualty events

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that could be misconstrued as spread

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and drive this narrative around the world

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
with America at the front

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
with the intention of getting

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
all of the world to turn

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
against us eventually

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
for this very thing

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
that Brett will be one of the people

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that leads the introspection

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
of America

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
where we finally realize

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
that our past is something

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
to be ashamed of

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
and Brett will be the one who helps

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
lead our way out of that, right?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
right into central bank

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
digital currency

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
of a global governance

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
after a cyber attack

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
that wipes out the banking system of America

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
or some shit like that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that's why they're so confident

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
that's why they're so bold

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
that's why they keep doubling down

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
because something is coming

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and so I don't know how to say it any other way

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
but just get ready

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
get your things in order

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
get to know your community

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
get to know your neighbors

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
get a radio

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I hope I'm wrong

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I hope it's many years yet

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
for what's coming

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
but the way that they double down

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
on this narrative the way that they insist

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
that this is the way it is

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
it leads me to believe that

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
the timer's running

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I'm just trying to be real

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I think the timer's running

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
accessibility after

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
the mRNA technology was deployed

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
if those two things had shown up at the same moment

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
we couldn't compare and all of this

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
contributed to the disease

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
there's further road we can go down

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
but I think this is maybe a good place

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to put this on pause for now

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
with the understanding

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
that what we have done is we have taken the anecdotal experience

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
of a person who doesn't know how to think about this

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
we have talked about

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
from that formulating a hypothesis that then is in need

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
of a test and then the fact that that test

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
can actually come in the form of large data sets that capture

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
unambiguous events like death and show us

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
that in fact whether or not this specific

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
test that caused us to formulate that hypothesis

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
were caused by this exact thing

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
that they are completely consistent with the idea

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
that there's a new force that is a hazard

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
that we are justified in

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
focusing our attention on these tests

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
our morbid curiosity in this case is a survival instinct

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
that's it it's a survival instinct

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
and that to deny you the information that allows that survival instinct

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
together appropriate information

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
is a crime in and of itself

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
so he basically said

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
nothing he said nothing there

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
as he tried to summarize this

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
he said absolutely nothing

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and certainly not as clear as it could be said

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
which is that all cause mortality

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
is a way of checking predictions

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and there were two predictions made

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
the first one was that a novel virus

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
was circulating the globe starting in 2020

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
and contributing another cause of death

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and those numbers didn't show up

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
except for in limited geographic locations

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
over very limited time periods

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and on the other hand

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
after the rollout of the transition

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and on the other hand

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
after the rollout of the transfection

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
a more clear signal

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
in all cause mortality rise

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
was seen around the world

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
coincident with it

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
it's very easy to explain

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
it's very easy to say it

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
there was no evidence of spread of a respiratory pathogen

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
there was evidence of mass casualty events

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
that seemed to be correlated with

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
the application of bad protocols

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
which were not uniformly applied

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
and

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
and all cause mortality rise

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
associated with the geographic

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
outlay of transfection

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
succinct

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
simple

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
two conclusions

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
no spread

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
shots are deadly

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
it's really easy Brett

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
you don't need an hour and forty minutes

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
into your podcast

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
but that's part of the obfuscation

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
that he does so well

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
that's what the intellectual dark web does so well

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
it's a very lively debate

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
inside of a limited spectrum

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
that reinforces every single notion

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
of the mythology that we are being governed by

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
the mythology we are being governed by

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
that I didn't see until

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
very very recently

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that we all need to

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
retrospectively just

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
humble up and see

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
that there wasn't a spreading RNA virus

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
that spreading RNA viruses

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
are probably a pretty big

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
biological myth

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and that if you don't want to get

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
sophisticated enough to check that

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
then you can just assure yourself

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
that they lied about it

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
because RNA cannot copy itself

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
with high fidelity over millions of victims

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
over several years

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
it doesn't happen

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
it can't happen

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
there's no biology to explain it

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and on those principles

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
the no-virus people have been right

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
but the past is fading into

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
the past is being erased

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
the erasure will be forgotten

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and then the lie will become truth

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
that's how we got AIDS

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and that's how we have

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
our vaccine schedule

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
in the United States

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
because the past was forgotten

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and the lie became the truth

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
the vaccines are just a flawless

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
best idea ever

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Brett Weinstein and

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Heather Hay

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and that's that limited

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
spectrum of debate

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
that noam Chomsky warned us about

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
it's that exact thing

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
that the intellectual dark web does

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
and all the while the presuppositions

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
of the system are being

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
reinforced by this limited

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
spectrum of debate including a novel

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
virus that killed millions of people

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
that millions of people were saved from

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
that likely came from getting a function

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
will definitely come again

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
here's the

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
trip to Romania

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
that we're talking about here

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
keep in mind that not only was Denis Rancourt

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
at this place

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and Brett Weinstein

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
but also so many of the players

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
that we've come to recognize

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
as part of this worst case scenario

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
chorus the Malone's

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Meryl Nass

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Brian Cole

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
this is the

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
guy from Harvard

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Harvey Reich

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and Jessica Rose

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
immunologist mathematician

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
bio informatics person who

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
focuses exclusively on

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
virus she's also a virologist

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
exclusively on virus nothing else

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
every once in a while she'll write

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
something about the dangers of the shot

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
but never about

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
transfection as a whole

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and then of course

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
here we have Steve Hatfield

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Steve Hatfield

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the guy who in March of 2020

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
said that this thing was going to be

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
something pretty deadly and that we

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
needed to get kids to get used to

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
masks and Barney should be wearing

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
a mask because we got to get kids

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
used to this and make it fun

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
about

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
a week later

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
about a week later

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
he's in another video

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
in that video

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
he says things like

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
public health in the 20th century

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
has to be ranked up there

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
with the level of national defense

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
he says that in the future

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
the U.S. probably needs a pandemic

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
fusion center like NORAD

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
social distancing is viral

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
is vital

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
this country has done the greatest war

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
time mobilization since World War

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
II for the pandemic

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
um

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
yeah

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I mean we're talking about some pretty

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
serious on narrative stuff

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
happening with with Mr. Steve

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Hatfield who now is on

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
international tour for a book

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
he's writing about the the role that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
hydroxychloroquine could have played

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
in saving the pandemic and you know

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
how how Rick Bright

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and Janet Woodcock are responsible

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
for sabotaging Trump's plan and Navarro's

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
plan to stockpile hydroxychloroquine

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and save America

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
what a wonderful story

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
about a drug that should have been in

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
everybody's medicine cabinet but wasn't

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
specific for any particular respiratory

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
disease

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
just generally useful

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
for inflammation

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
same probably with ivermectin

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
although maybe ivermectin has some

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
antibiotic and other effects

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
another useful drug

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that probably should be in everybody's

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
medicine cabinet and like aspirin

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
could have lots of usefulness

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
depending on when you used it

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
but you know

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
wouldn't want to think like that

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
we would not want to challenge

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
the existence of a novel virus

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
for which novel cures are needed

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
things that people have been using

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
for years in other places

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
for other things that were over the

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
counter in France until the start

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
of the pandemic for example

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but remember

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
they did this stuff on purpose

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
you heard

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
that hydroxychloroquine

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
used to be over the counter in

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
France and then became not over

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the counter at the start of the pandemic

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
ooh, hydroxychloroquine

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
must be a secret they're trying to keep

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
that's how they did it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
they made you think

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
they were trying to hide it

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
they did these obviously terrible

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
obviously terrible trials

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
that could obviously

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
be dissected by

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
armchair biologists like Brett Weinstein

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
to show that this ivermectin

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
trials clearly

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
compounded it's confounded

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
they're clearly covering up

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
the usefulness of ivermectin

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
here's three of us

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
he's got two shots

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
i've got the ivermectin

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
he's got shots in

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and natural immunity

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
this is a new way for us

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
to hang out during the pandemic

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
that's how he came out in

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
2021 with Robert Malone

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and Steve Kirsch on his podcast

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
he came out against the shot thing

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
it was a very

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
titrated

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
slow roll

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
to where we are now

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
three years later

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
no where basically

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
absolutely no where

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
basically

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
only now coming

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
to the conclusion that the right

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
thing was to be skeptical about

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
everything

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
all the way down to the root cause

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and for whatever reason

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
however they did it

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
they made it very hard for everybody

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
to get down to that root cause

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
the weird part is

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
i even have the feeling that the people

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
who were technically at the right place

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
with the root cause

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
were there already too early

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and i'm not talking about

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
people who questioned the AIDS virus

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
i'm not talking about people like that

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
like resnick

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
who already knew the full extent

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
to the mythology

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
that could be laid by a illusion

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
of consensus in science

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
i'm talking about

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
people like Andrew Kaufman

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
like seriously

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
can i just show you a picture

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and then you tell me what this picture means

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
because i still can't really

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
figure out what this picture means

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
but it drives me absolutely bananas

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
because i see it

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
every time i open this folder

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
i see this picture and i think what in the hell

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
does this picture mean

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
where is it now? can i find it?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
my goodness

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
what does this picture mean

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
where is my

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
oh it's in this one

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
here

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and media or images

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
i think it's images

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
hold on one second

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
E

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
E

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
images no

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
darn it now i'm wasting your time

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
i apologize i'm gonna find them

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
hold on one second

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
it's

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
stream media

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
yes here

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
what is this?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
so apparently

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
apparently

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
he had a contract

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
with the state of New York

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
or got a grant

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
from the state of New York prison system

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
to provide a biometric

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
device

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
to the prison system of New York

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
now the name of the company is back here

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
i don't think it's on this one

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
but it might be

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and we can look it up

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
i've got some of the documentation

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
but this is a picture of him right before the pandemic

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
at a poster session

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
where he's

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
getting the award

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
to develop the technology

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
to monitor

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
somehow biometrics of prisoners

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
maybe with regard to suicide watch

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
or something like that

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and here he is

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
having a handshake

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
with one of the real godfathers

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
of the pandemic narrative

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and one of the people that oversaw the mass casualty event

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
in New York and New York state

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
and coincidentally

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
who's the first guy

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
who's the first name

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
that Kevin McCarran mentioned

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
in late February

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
or early March

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
as the thing that he was most focused on

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
the two things

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
that i really want to focus on

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
are these no-virus people like Andy Kaufman

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and the 5G narrative

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
that the 5G is causing the virus

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
i got to fight against those two things

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
i suspect that some of these

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
no-virus people were actually very good people

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
i think some of these no-virus people

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
were actually

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
probably on the right side the whole time

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
and that they were co-opted by a few people

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
by the state

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
by the system

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
by these interests that were interested

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
in posing next to the train

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and carefully coached

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
as to how to play the no-virus team

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and it could be

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
very very easy for them to

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
have been a uniting force

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
or a place of

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
networking but instead they stuck

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
to it so hard

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
in the first year and a half or two years

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and at the same time

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
were opposed

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
so violently

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
by people on our side

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that it became

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
very very hard for anybody

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
to see

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
that their position was rational

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
that their

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
their idea of questioning

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
the source

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
narrative of the pandemic was a good idea

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
both by their own actions

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
by the actions of others that appeared

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
to be opposing them

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
by the memes that were created

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
there was a collective effort

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
on both sides

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
of that narrative

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
both sides of that narrative

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
that is the no-virus king

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
shaking hands

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
with the pandemic

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
mass casualty event coordinator

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
that started the whole

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
thing

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
and they're shaking hands

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
in 2019 ladies and gentlemen

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
please wake up and apologize

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
to everybody who knew this

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
before we did

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
and who figured it out

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
this is not the hero you're looking for here

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
this is not the hero you're looking for

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
this is what I think is part

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
of the controlled op on the

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
no-virus side

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
it's not a coincidence this photo exists

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
it's not a coincidence that grant exists

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
that guy is not interested

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
in saving humankind

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
other people on the no-virus team

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
might be

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
other people who questioned the aids

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
epidemic already

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
10, 20 years ago might be

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
on the good side

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
but I know for sure

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
that Kevin McCarran and

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Paul Catrell knew the name of

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Andrew Kaufman in February and

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
March of 2020 and repeated it

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
often

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
the other name that they knew

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
was Tom Cowan

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
they didn't start in on the

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
balies until much later in

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
2020

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I see it

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
ladies and gentlemen I see it

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
very clearly that a game is being played

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
with us that a game has been played

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
for a very long time that some of these

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
people are wittingly involved

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
other people are unwittingly involved

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
but all of them know that there

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
is a governing structure

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
above us and around us

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and outside of us

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
that uses mythology to govern us

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and that's why they feel very

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
comfortable talking about the mythology

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
because they are comfortably part

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
of the governing structure

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
it's not fifth generation

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
warfare it's fifth generation

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
governance

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
and they want to govern our

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
children by this mythology so that's

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
why they are sticking to it they know

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
that's the plan

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
they know all of our people are all in

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
all of the people in on this plan are

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
all in and so it's either they win

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
or they lose

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
there's no in between this time

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
because it's for all the marbles

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
so if you want to play

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
on the right team it's now or never

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
because they're going to

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
keep telling the same stories

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
they're going to keep obfuscating the

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
truth they're going to keep talking about

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
infection and replication in competent

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
clones with the idea of

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
implying to you that there are also

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
replication competent clones

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
they're going to keep playing with your consciousness because

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
it is the primary real estate that this has

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
always been about your consciousness

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and that of your children

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and these narratives that they brought

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
out they were all designed

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
to give everybody a job to give everybody

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
a place to pose on the side of the

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
train to help pretend to stop and start it

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
so that everybody would believe that

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
these actions were necessary

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and contributing to the experience

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
that we were all having

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I lonely rode all by ourselves

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
where we've never been before

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
until we got picked up by a bunch of strangers

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
that helped explain these stories to us

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
and such plausible explanations

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
they were Ivermectin

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
and hydroxychloroquine

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
make sense for a novel virus

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
they couldn't possibly make sense

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
for a population that was just

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
wholly unhealthy

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
undernourished

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
sick and constantly inflamed

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I mean imagine a scenario where

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
50% of America is in a constant state

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
of inflammation just because they're

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
overweight and undernourished

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
and that's something that would work

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
against inflammation or work against

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
an overactive immune system

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
like Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
could have general beneficial effects

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
out of a population like that

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
imagine that

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and imagine how many doctors were not

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
savvy enough to maybe think about that

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
but instead were so convinced

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
that they wrote books

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and articles and substacks

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
about the effectiveness of Ivermectin

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
that they came out on their podcast

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
and said that

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
prophylactic use of Ivermectin

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I'm proving to you now

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
that it's safe

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Brett Weinstein

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Pierre Corrie

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
are the two main proponents

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
of Ivermectin and the main proponent

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
of hydroxychloroquine

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
is not Zeb Zelenko

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
it's Steven Hatfield

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
a guy who oversaw

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
the Ebola response

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
a guy who was accused

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
of being the anthrax leaker

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
but then given five million dollar

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
someone sorry we didn't mean to accuse you

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
even though you were on sipro

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
the week before

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
for a sinus infection

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
the mystery virus does not

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
equal the excess deaths

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Mr. Brett Weinstein

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and Denis told you that there were no

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
excess deaths attributable to

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
a virus in 2020

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
but you don't seem to care

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
you don't seem to care

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
at all to do this math

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
to reframe it with regard

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
to all-cause mortality

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
you don't want to outline

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
the fact that all of these things

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
are confounders

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that you won't talk about

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
you mentioned ventilators

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
like ventilators

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
that's it

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
nothing else

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
nothing else that could have distorted

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the all-cause mortality

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
the interpretation of it

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I mean for goodness sakes

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
even Jessica Hockett is right about this

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
all-cause mortality is bullshit

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
why is it bullshit

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
well because let's go back

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
what is this all-cause mortality

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
here in America

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
what does that represent

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
hey healthy population

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
does that represent a nourished population

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
does that represent

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
a great healthcare system

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
or does this represent the death rate

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
in one of the most unhealthy

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
obese, inflamed, undernourished

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
populations in all of the first world

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
does it represent a population

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
where between 50 and 100,000 people

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
die of drug overdose every year

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
of just opioids

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
never mind cocaine or crack

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
never mind our high suicide rate

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
all-cause mortality

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
normalizes our very very

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
unhealthy system

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
and excess all-cause mortality

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
is on top of the already dirty system

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
that we have

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
now we had some more excess deaths

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
so think about all the things

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
that these people are making

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
you accept as normal

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
the pre-COVID malnutrition

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
in our children

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
the pre-COVID obesity

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
in our adults

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
the pre-COVID lack of exercise

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
in the last 20 years

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
of most adults in America

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
our consumption of over-processed food

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that comes in boxes and bags

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
and frozen

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
our lack of understanding

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
excess mortality in America

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
is not a normal number

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
it's not a reflection of a status quo

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
that is healthy and thriving

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and so to show excess

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
above that is not really showing

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
anything of significance

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
in fact it's

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
it's not understandable at all

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
if you're not going to count

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
all of these things

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
that are contributing to

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
the excess excess deaths

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
the sad part of this argument

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
that it's about population control

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
is that the last 25 years

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
have been about population control

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
the vaccine schedules

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
about population control

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
process food is about

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
population control

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
the widespread use of glyphosate

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
is about population control

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
the lack of

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
of good public schools

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
is about population control

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
the transgender issue

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
is about population control

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
gotta come to the realization

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
that the pandemic is just a reason to wake up

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
a last slap across your face

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
that if you ignore it it's over

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
it's the last one

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
the next slap is going to be your kids

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
why aren't we talking about

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
strict liability for all vaccines

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
why aren't we talking about

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
getting rid of the PrEP Act

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and the 1986 Vaccine Act

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
through the 7th Amendment violation

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
that they represent

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
why aren't we talking about

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
the zero epidemiological evidence of spread

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
why aren't we talking about

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
millions of dollars of projected Medicare costs

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
that have been avoided

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
by the uniquely focused

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
excess deaths in Medicare

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
populations

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
why aren't we talking about that

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Brett's not savvy enough to know

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
that for the last 20 or 15 years

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
at least that all

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
projections have said that

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
wow and these boomers get old

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
and we start spending $500,000 a year

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
on keeping them alive

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
this system ain't going to explode anymore

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
the system of Social Security

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
ain't going to float anymore

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
unless oh goodness look what came along

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
a whole bunch of new causes of death

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
iatrogenic death

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
nursing home death

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
do not resuscitate order death

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
opioid death

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
it's all going to be

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
come forgotten

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
unless we fight

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
ladies and gentlemen i do think it's important

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
to remember that RNA is like

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
a mixtape

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and you can't make copies of it

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and they're not high fidelity

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
so if you take albums

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and you make a mixtape for your girlfriend

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
that mixtape can't be copied again

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
because that's not how

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
cassette tapes can be copied

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
the DNA equivalent

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
in music of a CD

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
then you can make a compilation CD

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
that can be copied over and over again

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
and that means that you can

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
make a copy of the mix that you make

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
for your girlfriend

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
now RNA in the wild

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
is basically the same thing

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
they have a very hard time

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
culturing it

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
but they can occasionally sequence it

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and if they can sequence it

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
then they can use synthetic means

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
DNA copy of that sequence

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
that they purport to have found in the wild

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and if they use recombinant DNA techniques

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
to make a DNA construct of that virus

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
they can grow that DNA in mass quantities

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
by making plasmids of it

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
and those plasmids

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
with the right tweaks will be grown

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
into large quantities by

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
bacterial culture

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and very simply by tying

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
antibiotic resistance to the expression

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
of the plasmid

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
then only bacteria which copy the plasmid

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
will grow and in the end

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
you're left with a huge

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
a huge quantity

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
of these plasmids which have been

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
which may have been copied by these bacteria

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and you can lice the bacteria

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
and combine those DNA

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
with a cell culture

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
electroporate them into a cell culture

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
or combine them with a commercial

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
enzyme and convert them into RNA

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
and those pure RNA transcripts

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
that are created in this way

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
are called infectious clones

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and those infectious clones can be used

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
in cell culture experiments

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
they can be used in animal experiments

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
and they can be stored and shared

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
with colleagues around the world

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
most importantly to understand

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
they don't have to be made in small quantities

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
but they can actually be made at the industrial scale

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
in exactly the same way

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
the process too

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
was used to create the RNA

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that was injected

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
into billions of people around the world

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
the exact same process

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
the exact same vats

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
the exact same

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
factories could be used to make

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
large quantities of infectious RNA

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
expressing the spike protein

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
or expressing the whole coronavirus genome

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
purported to exist in nature

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
and the beauty of these clones

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
these infectious clones

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
is that they are a way of

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
reliably seeding

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
this sequence

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and possibly

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
reliably seeding

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
this sequence in high correlation

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
with symptomology

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
while at the same time having no

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
reasonable expectation

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
for a massive amount of spread

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
simply because we already know

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
from the original part of this slide

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
these viruses don't really do that

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
very well

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
but if you made a large pure quantity

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
of their genome

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
then you could make it appear that way

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
through the molecular signals

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
that would be extremely easy to detect

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
in that scenario where you distribute a clone

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
around the world

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
into a few patients in a few different places

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
and then use that

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
as evidence of spread

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
if you did that in

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
in close temporal approximation

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
with an event like what

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
happened in New York City that Jessica

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Hockett is so studiously

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
investigating then you could very easily

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
see how this

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
correlation of molecular data around

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
the world with the sparse

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
but real

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
mass casualty events

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
the illusion of a spreading

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
pandemic could be seated very easily

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
in a matter of days or weeks

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
and so can all the molecular

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
biology be fraud it's not likely

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
and in fact it definitely

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
doesn't need to be we have the technology

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
on our benches right now

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
to create the illusion of the pandemic

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
using PCR

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
hand-high fidelity sequencing

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
and infectious clones to do it

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and so it's a crime scene

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
and we need to investigate it

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
and we need to investigate the crime scene

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
with this understanding of biology in mind

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
that RNA viruses are notoriously

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
difficult to wrangle maybe even a

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
mythological beast

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
and

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
the way this mythology has been sustained

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
in the laboratories with DNA

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
and with the making of

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
RNA infectious clones

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and so we found ourselves alone

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
on this road being told

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
that there was a novel virus that millions of people

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
died and millions more were saved from

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
that Michael came from gain of function

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and might come again

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
and the car that picked us up

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
all alone on this highway

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
was filled with people who are unwilling

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
to question that narrative

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
but fully willing to tell you that they're going to give you a ride

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
to somewhere safe

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
when in reality

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I think they're just running out the clock

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
they're just going to drive you down this road

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and eventually you're going to come to the conclusion

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
that they're not driving you anywhere useful

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
and you're going to ask to get out of the car

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
and you're going to be right back where you started again

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
no further along than you were

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
and you're going to find out

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
that they just drove you in circles

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
for a year

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
that's what they did to us

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
and for a while I was participating

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
in it

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
as much as I wanted to be struggling against it

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I didn't know who all the liars were

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
the liars were lying

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
about knowing each other

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
and so I was driven from one

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
signal group to another signal group

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
from one trusted group of people

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
to another

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
from one car of liars

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
to another car of liars

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
one car of liars drove me north

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
and by the time I figured out they were lying

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I got out of there and started walking south

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
and someone else picked me up

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
but they were liars too

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
and they did that to all of us

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
every one of us has people that we followed

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
that lied to us and then we changed our mind

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
or tried to figure out a new way out

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
and then another person lied to us

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
because there were so many liars

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
winning and unwittingly

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
participating in this governing structure

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
whether or not they knew the full

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
implications of what they were doing

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
doesn't really matter

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
because they were sustaining this idea

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
that something spread

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
that didn't exist before

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
this illusion of consensus

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
that millions of people were killed

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
included asymptomatic spread

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
and I'm using this analogy

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
of a train because it is like that

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
once it started

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
once the belief in this started

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
and was ceded

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
from the top to the bottom

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
from the left to the right

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
by all of these people

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
agreeing that there was a novel virus

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
that people are in danger of

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
that might have come from a laboratory

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and therefore

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
all of these extemporaneous measures

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
and countermeasures and therapies

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
are justified

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
all this action is justified

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
is a cognitive trap that your children

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
are on

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
and they are

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
on this train because we got

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
on the train with them

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
we held their hand as they stepped over

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
the gap

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and it is up to us to take them

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
off this train

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
they will not get off this train

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
on their own

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
they will not come to the realization

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
that all the adults around them

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
have been lying

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
that all their teachers are mistaken

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
unless we pull them off the train

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
one by one

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
our friends, our family

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
our parents

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
our co-workers

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
need to be helped

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
off the train

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
with humility

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
with empathy

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
with love, with friendship

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
not the people who see the narrative

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
the people who fell victim to it

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
the people who fell victim to the faith

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
let's explain to them

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
that a conflated background signal

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
is all that is necessary

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
and a spectacular commitment to the lie

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and why they would do it

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
that's all we got to do

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
that's all the task really is

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
that's all we can hope to do

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
that's all we can keep doing

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I got a really interesting video

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
for tomorrow

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
which is

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
actually a video from the University of Chicago

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
and what it looked like at the beginning of the pandemic

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
at the University of Chicago

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I think you'll find it really interesting

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
especially because the University of Chicago

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
still basically has the same

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
the same

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
forward public facing

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
policy about COVID

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
it's really extraordinary

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
for what I consider to be one

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
of the better institutions

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
in the United States

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
they're really on narrative in an extraordinary way

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
so I'm going to try and watch that tomorrow

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
thank you very much for joining me

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
so it was a little bit broken, angry, stream

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
but we're just going to try and keep

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
singing the same song over and over again

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
to try and get it better and better

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
and make the message clear and clear

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and we've got a couple really great things

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
coming up in December including

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
a really blow out

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
timeline show

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Christmas Special

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
we've got lots of plans and I've got lots of

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
guests that are starting to line up to try

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
and get on the show and have a discussion

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
with us so I think we're going to have a couple council

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
fires coming up in the next couple weeks

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I've got lots of tempting offers

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
so we're going to see what happens but

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
every day that I can

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
be here I've got a secret weapon

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
in the house for the next couple weeks

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
and so with that secret weapon

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I think I'm going to be able to be a little

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
bit more available for this stream

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
and a little bit more focused on it

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
that being said I also need to be present

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
at home

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
and so I'm going to continue to try and do this

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
balance as best I can and I hope you will be

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
patient as I do thank you very much for joining

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
me and I will see you again tomorrow

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
intramuscular injection of any

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
combination of substances with the intent

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
and transfection in healthy humans

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
is criminally negligent

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
viruses are not patterned integrity

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
don't forget it and I will see you tomorrow

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
at Giga Home Biological

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Music

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Music

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:23.000

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Thanks everybody for joining me

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
122 people big time

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I love it thank you thank you thank you

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Check out Soothspider's little tools

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
for making clips

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I think it's really working

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I don't want everybody working hard to share my

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
stream but on the other hand

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I do really think it helps a lot

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
so if you do have the time and the energy

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
to use some of the tools that Soothspider's

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
has made for us

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
please do so and

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
thank you very much Soothspider for all

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
that work Pamela

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
everybody else who's here

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Jeff everybody

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
just I don't know thanks and

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I'll see you tomorrow night

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:27.000
