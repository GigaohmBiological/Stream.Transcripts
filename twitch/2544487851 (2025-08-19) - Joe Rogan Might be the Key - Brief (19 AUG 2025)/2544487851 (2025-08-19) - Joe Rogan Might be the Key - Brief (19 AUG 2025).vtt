00:32.947 --> 00:53.000
Pigeons and doves coo They're not two birds but one from a deeper view With life that always holds true One descent but if you only knew

00:59.470 --> 01:04.445
Goats and geese have had their roots revealed

01:06.158 --> 01:16.221
More than birds, the fossils have the clues to make it real.

01:16.861 --> 01:28.244
By the mid-Jurassic, they had warm bodies and hollow eggs.

01:38.329 --> 01:53.237
If raptors grew wings and flew More than birds the stones we feel Archaeopteryx is real

01:59.595 --> 02:19.067
If I told you birds convey More than eggs and tasty stew They're a strain if I know to More than birds convey

02:27.503 --> 02:30.921
da da da da da da da

02:39.517 --> 02:49.961
How could life give rise to cockatoos from such a monstrous land?

02:50.021 --> 02:56.464
Selection pressure substitutes their jumps for flights to power-fighting tents.

02:56.624 --> 02:58.384
Adapting old T-Rex's family

03:11.520 --> 03:12.706
More than birds

03:15.168 --> 03:37.123
By Oviraptor's breeding can be shown Coats like birds they laid their eggs sequentially And sat on them to grow

03:44.505 --> 03:58.350
Died while stuck in good More than birds in amber sealed Dino plumage is revealed

04:01.997 --> 04:14.827
If our rooks and birds are afraid Are the ancient kings made new?

04:15.507 --> 04:20.391
Cause they're avian dinos too!

04:33.619 --> 04:54.776
I mean, even if the guy uses auto-tune, this is really crazy, man.

05:07.352 --> 05:10.696
I mean, he can't help it if he's caught in a bad biology, but he's a good singer.

05:10.736 --> 05:13.559
He's got a really, really wide ranging voice.

05:13.659 --> 05:15.641
It's really impressive in my mind.

05:15.721 --> 05:17.403
But, you know, sorry, it's so geeky.

05:17.463 --> 05:20.225
Mark, Mark, Mark, you're so funny.

05:20.886 --> 05:24.069
As a surgeon, you should be speaking out on this.

05:24.810 --> 05:26.392
You could save lives.

05:26.592 --> 05:27.393
Dude, what the fuck?

05:27.413 --> 05:28.594
I didn't know anything about this.

05:28.634 --> 05:29.775
How am I meant to know about this?

05:30.711 --> 05:31.091
You know what?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.652
I don't know about everything.

05:32.672 --> 05:42.237
Like, um, you shouldn't, you shouldn't think that just because you're on to something that someone else should be doing it too, buddy.

05:42.798 --> 05:44.399
We've all got our own jobs to do.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.220
I don't tell you what to do.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.161
What the fuck?

05:48.901 --> 05:59.347
Anyway, I mean, the reason why I try to get through to you to get your number, call you and you're busy last time and I'm not busy is, um, look, I went back through the podcast and I'm afraid

06:01.092 --> 06:04.255
I think it wasn't good enough mate.

06:05.576 --> 06:20.689
I don't know how to explain this to you but you know it was about, it was just over an hour but the thing is what was relevant was like literally just 15 minutes and it was just dragged out and there was not enough substance, not enough facts, not enough details.

06:22.751 --> 06:26.573
I would also say try and work on your presentation.

06:26.593 --> 06:37.579
You drag things out and speak very slowly and it's just you need to be a bit more punchy, a bit more punchy, a bit more animated, a bit more lively.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.522
I mean, I don't know if you're just a bit flat that day or what.

06:41.582 --> 06:41.943
I don't know.

06:42.263 --> 06:45.746
But you just I think you're I know your style.

06:46.747 --> 06:51.092
You can have you just could inject yourself with a little bit more energy, a little bit more animation.

06:51.853 --> 06:54.175
So what I was going to do actually was.

06:55.316 --> 07:19.561
create some clips of the podcast and do a sub stack and obviously credit you and reference you and talk about the opioid deaths and all that kind of stuff so that was the plan i'm sorry mate i've just got a lot of fucking podcasts i've got a lot of recordings and i'm i'm trying to keep the quality of the content quite high i'm afraid on this occasion it just

07:20.888 --> 07:21.869
It just wasn't good enough.

07:22.789 --> 07:26.551
I know that sounds harsh, but I'm just being honest with you.

07:27.992 --> 07:32.054
It just, the quality wasn't up to scratch.

07:32.775 --> 07:33.555
All right, mate, bye.

07:57.433 --> 08:03.517
For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed.

08:04.278 --> 08:09.580
that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country.

08:10.541 --> 08:26.487
On August 23rd of last year, God sent me President Trump.

08:26.507 --> 08:30.409
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

08:32.213 --> 08:32.934
And I have lied.

08:32.954 --> 08:34.075
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:34.215 --> 08:35.736
I don't want to lie.

08:35.836 --> 08:36.817
I don't think I'm a liar.

08:36.877 --> 08:37.918
I try not to be a liar.

08:37.938 --> 08:38.798
I don't want to be a liar.

08:39.499 --> 08:43.602
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

08:47.345 --> 08:48.306
There are no ethics.

08:48.366 --> 08:51.068
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

08:52.389 --> 08:57.934
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

09:06.101 --> 09:11.948
Oh, there's bad news of fans of living, because Health Secretary R.F.K.

09:12.008 --> 09:12.389
Jr.

09:12.449 --> 09:16.414
just pulled $500 million in funding for vaccine development.

09:17.034 --> 09:23.262
Now, we have 10 more months of this show, and I want to give a measured, nonpartisan response here.

09:23.282 --> 09:25.645
F*** you, you roid-addled nepotism!

09:45.025 --> 09:49.288
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

09:49.328 --> 09:54.911
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

09:56.833 --> 10:00.915
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

10:02.316 --> 10:05.018
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

10:05.078 --> 10:06.699
But that's what we're in right now.

10:09.053 --> 10:19.002
Most of these shots are for flu or COVID, but as the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract.

10:19.582 --> 10:20.183
Counterpoint.

10:20.203 --> 10:24.447
F*** you, you roadkill-munching, rabbi-human Slim Jim.

10:31.817 --> 10:36.519
last night before the bill was allowed to be voted on in the House.

10:36.559 --> 10:42.702
He was trying to ward off the Republicans from allowing a vote on Massey and my bill.

10:42.902 --> 10:51.106
But as you pointed out, the grand jury testimony and grand jury files largely concern Epstein and Maxwell.

10:51.146 --> 10:53.007
They're the ones who were prosecuted.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.348
It will not have

10:54.688 --> 11:02.631
the witness interviews that really implicate the rich and powerful men who were potentially engaged in sex trafficking.

11:02.951 --> 11:06.092
It will not have a lot of the e-mails and the texts.

11:06.592 --> 11:11.574
And, as you pointed out, it requires a court order to unseal those files.

11:11.694 --> 11:13.574
Typically, courts are reluctant to do that.

11:13.694 --> 11:14.655
They may in this case.

11:15.335 --> 11:23.838
But there's a lot within the Justice Department that the Justice Department could release, and they can do so while protecting victims' identity.

11:28.859 --> 11:38.455
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong, all that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

12:16.901 --> 12:17.361
Test 1, 2.

12:17.782 --> 12:19.142
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

12:19.182 --> 12:21.184
Welcome to the Independent Bright Web.

12:22.224 --> 12:26.727
It's a place where you can find real Americans speaking to the world.

12:28.027 --> 12:30.729
We may expand the Independent Bright Web to... I think truth is good for kids.

12:31.149 --> 12:34.931
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

12:35.444 --> 12:37.104
We want everybody to feel good.

12:38.005 --> 12:39.425
That's not the way life is.

12:39.685 --> 12:45.326
The intellectual bright web may someday expand into international waters, but right now we've got Joe Marshall.

12:45.386 --> 12:49.367
We've got, I don't know, I'm starting to think Dan Cohen might be all right.

12:49.907 --> 12:52.447
I'm pretty sure that Mark Kulak is a straight up shooter.

12:53.728 --> 12:55.748
One of my favorite people on the internet.

12:55.808 --> 12:59.909
One of my favorite friends that I've made over the COVID pandemic.

13:01.390 --> 13:15.029
And somebody that I would recommend you follow and use his website to explore the history of these mentors that have served above these people and started to craft these ideas that we are currently trapped in.

13:17.591 --> 13:19.212
Yeah, I'm pretty excited to be here today.

13:20.452 --> 13:21.773
Anyway, thanks for being here.

13:21.813 --> 13:23.674
You better leave up, what's this, 16 years?

13:23.714 --> 13:24.154
Yeah, this'll be 17.

13:24.254 --> 13:25.895
You old champ, you old champ.

13:26.375 --> 13:27.136
Super vet now.

13:27.176 --> 13:28.316
Super, super vet.

13:28.336 --> 13:32.959
16 years, man, and seeing it evolve through all the eras, man.

13:32.979 --> 13:42.603
Like last summer, a good friend of ours, coach Chauncey Bill, has mentioned a player posting his highlights at halftime, and we've seen guys checking their phones during the games.

13:43.284 --> 13:44.584
We're gonna watch this clip right here.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.765
I had a kid, dog.

13:46.846 --> 13:49.368
At halftime, now you know we rebuilding, right?

13:49.388 --> 13:52.091
We in New Orleans, we ain't even gonna say the kid name.

13:53.493 --> 13:55.415
We're down like 18 at the half.

13:56.696 --> 13:57.617
He had a nasty dunk.

13:59.539 --> 14:06.006
We coming out for the third quarter, this motherfucker done posted his dunk on his joint.

14:06.146 --> 14:06.867
At halftime.

14:10.385 --> 14:12.407
We down 18.

14:12.707 --> 14:15.250
You gotta optimize those numbers.

14:17.332 --> 14:25.919
So what's the biggest difference you've noticed in players today compared to when you came in the league in 09?

14:26.040 --> 14:26.780
That for one.

14:27.501 --> 14:32.325
Motherfuckers getting on their phone, so worried about what's on their phone, what somebody say.

14:33.426 --> 14:37.751
Even to this point, I seen a motherfucker put his name in a Twitter search to see what they was saying.

14:38.392 --> 14:42.576
Somebody who was actually playing them.

14:42.596 --> 14:44.478
They was getting minutes.

14:45.579 --> 14:48.522
And I'm like, this to the point we at?

14:48.602 --> 14:49.603
You know what I mean?

14:50.244 --> 14:52.226
That was never a thought.

14:54.568 --> 14:56.149
Even for you, that wasn't a thought.

14:56.209 --> 14:57.050
Even worse for me.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.192
They didn't have cell phones and shit.

15:00.452 --> 15:01.713
No social media or nothing.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.614
Niggas weren't checking their two-way pages and all that.

15:15.521 --> 15:16.823
But to that point, it's that.

15:17.283 --> 15:27.356
My folks always ask me, man, you can play another four or five years, but it's that part of the game that sucks the energy out of you because...

15:28.416 --> 15:37.940
Everybody so worried about everything else now, instead of what it was built on, like your game, competing, winning, going out there, you know, giving everything you got.

15:38.100 --> 15:42.121
It's like everybody's so caught up in all the shit that don't matter anymore, you know what I mean?

15:42.181 --> 15:47.443
Like what I'm wearing, motherfuckers in the mirror, fixing this, doing that, exfoliating and all this shit.

15:47.603 --> 15:48.804
What time is it?

15:49.064 --> 15:49.604
Game time!

15:59.400 --> 16:00.461
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.782
I'm just back from the gym.

16:01.842 --> 16:03.102
I'm not exfoliating.

16:04.203 --> 16:06.665
Not trying to check my social media at all.

16:06.745 --> 16:12.169
I wanted to be here after the basketball.

16:12.189 --> 16:14.210
I wanted to come in here and get something done.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.612
And so hopefully I can achieve that today.

16:16.632 --> 16:19.313
I need you to get off of social media.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.954
I don't know why that's not moving.

16:20.974 --> 16:22.315
There it goes.

16:22.736 --> 16:24.457
A social media is a military weapon.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.760
A social media is a national security theater and you cannot change their script.

16:29.940 --> 16:36.483
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

16:37.003 --> 16:41.345
Virology is never questioned as a science and public health is never questioned as a reason.

16:41.865 --> 16:43.866
They've done the same thing with pandemics.

16:44.026 --> 16:50.269
Don't be alarmed or impressed by what they're doing with the narrative and as they shift it around.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.290
break things and scramble around.

16:53.350 --> 16:56.992
The more they move, the more erratic they move, the more obvious it becomes.

16:57.613 --> 17:01.955
Ladies and gentlemen, the cheese is free on social media because that's how they are controlling.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.236
They're controlling what questions you ask.

17:04.636 --> 17:06.457
They're controlling what you're concerned about.

17:06.497 --> 17:08.038
They're controlling what you're afraid of.

17:08.938 --> 17:15.064
You think that there's trillions of immigrants in America that are overrunning the streets.

17:15.605 --> 17:19.108
You're worried about gain-of-function viruses and scientists that make them.

17:19.548 --> 17:21.550
And these are all ridiculous myths.

17:21.570 --> 17:24.813
You go on biologicals, the biology they ignore.

17:25.894 --> 17:29.418
The history that they ignore, a lot of it is actually archived very well.

17:30.198 --> 17:33.642
on a website called housatonicits.com.

17:34.102 --> 17:35.103
I encourage you to go there.

17:35.163 --> 17:41.169
I encourage you to follow Mark Housatonic Live on YouTube, Rumble, Odyssey, Gigohome, Peertube, etc.

17:42.971 --> 17:45.994
I also encourage you to follow Joe Marshall.

17:46.014 --> 17:46.814
I think he gets it.

17:47.795 --> 17:50.558
The Liberty Perspective is on Rumble and on YouTube.

17:51.098 --> 17:52.760
I like Joe a lot.

17:52.780 --> 18:01.947
You might want to put him on 2x or 1.5x because he says a lot and he speaks like a guy who lives in the woods, which he does.

18:02.968 --> 18:05.630
And so, you know, he doesn't speak quick like us city boys.

18:06.611 --> 18:10.254
So you might need to, yeah, you might need to speed him up a little bit.

18:10.294 --> 18:11.796
But ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

18:11.836 --> 18:13.237
Welcome to Giga Home Biological.

18:13.277 --> 18:15.218
We're trying to get the truth out there.

18:16.239 --> 18:18.360
I do think that there is a truth to distribute.

18:18.400 --> 18:25.724
It's just not distributed for free on social media, by social media platforms, or by social media algorithms.

18:25.784 --> 18:26.744
That's the reality.

18:27.505 --> 18:37.490
And I think a lot of us have just been bamboozled into believing that, especially during the pandemic, that social media was a free place or worth fighting for.

18:38.775 --> 18:43.838
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours who are rolling the excrement offstage.

18:43.978 --> 18:45.679
I guess I forgot to change that slide.

18:45.719 --> 18:47.740
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

18:47.980 --> 18:53.423
Don't forget, you must show your children why the cheese is free on social media.

18:53.483 --> 18:57.665
Social media is the military weapon that they intend to enslave our children with.

18:58.186 --> 18:59.646
And so you need to get them off.

19:00.207 --> 19:04.769
You need to get them off those platforms and maybe even teach them how to build their own platforms.

19:04.829 --> 19:07.351
If we could go back to kind of a MySpace thing,

19:08.231 --> 19:25.386
but you know our kids building their own websites and paying for their own urls that would be a huge move forward ladies and gentlemen RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injections are dumb transfection is a crime and population pyramids are real and that's exactly how fast joe marshall doesn't talk

19:25.947 --> 19:28.170
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch him.

19:29.151 --> 19:38.683
Mark Kulak can talk a little slower than me at times too, but his humor is so clever that you're going to need to be sharpened on the edge of your seat all the time listening.

19:38.723 --> 19:42.487
Ladies and gentlemen, I think there's no better way

19:43.308 --> 20:08.833
to envision what's going on than to imagine that you've been watching an elaborate Star Trek show and you have been trying to text the people on the set, you've been trying to text the people in the costumes, you've been trying to text the stagehands and trying to convince them that they need to do something different, that they need to be aware that there's somebody behind them or that the Romulans are about to attack or they missed a key detail on their on their tricorder readout.

20:09.927 --> 20:24.504
And after a few, what looks like somebody was listening to you because you got some chats back or something like that, Captain Kirk steps out of the Enterprise main control room or the bridge and you're

20:25.768 --> 20:26.569
You think you did it.

20:26.949 --> 20:33.354
You think you told him, and he stepped away, and he avoided the explosion, and you think that you had some influence on the show.

20:33.414 --> 20:35.616
That's what social media does to us.

20:36.337 --> 20:48.066
That's what it did to us, most importantly, at the beginning of the pandemic, where we thought that we were part of a mystery-solving exercise, when, in fact, we were watching a theater version of a mystery-solving exercise.

20:48.146 --> 20:54.652
It was gonna take about five years to reach its climax, where everybody on both sides get, I guess it was a lab leak,

20:56.653 --> 21:14.986
And so if you can start to think of Brett Weinstein and Dave Pakman and Sam Seder and Kim Iverson and Theo Vaughn and all these people as people that are on social media, but they don't read it, they don't use it.

21:15.427 --> 21:18.049
And in fact, social media represents them as being

21:18.928 --> 21:20.049
more than they are.

21:20.149 --> 21:27.457
One of the things that I'd like to discuss just briefly, I've got a little list here that I'm just going to flip over on this.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.959
I think I can, no I can't.

21:29.359 --> 21:30.040
Can I not do that?

21:30.100 --> 21:31.421
Maybe I didn't turn the camera on.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.345
I got this list of things that I've been thinking about.

21:34.385 --> 21:35.866
I guess I'm a little bit out of focus.

21:35.906 --> 21:36.767
That button should work.

21:36.827 --> 21:37.128
There we go.

21:38.048 --> 21:46.413
Um, a little list of things that I've been thinking about, about how we could dispel the myth of this, which way do I go?

21:46.453 --> 21:56.619
This kind of being on the Star Trek Enterprise, you know, with, with like Ryan Cole and, and, and Jessica Rose sitting at the, at the helm and,

21:57.359 --> 22:17.952
and I don't know some communication officer maybe Jessica Hockett is over at one seat and and somebody like Nick Hudson is at the other seat and they're all having conversations about Bergamo, Italy and it sounds really good or they're having conversations about how the Romulan ship is cloaked and they're all really good because they all stay on script and during the pandemic

22:18.992 --> 22:20.093
I was really fooled.

22:20.153 --> 22:21.234
I thought I could help.

22:21.434 --> 22:23.195
I thought I could change people's minds.

22:23.275 --> 22:29.079
I thought if you just gave me a half an hour, I could convince you that this was the most important idea that you can learn.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.600
And then people said, wow, you're really amazing.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.502
But then they just kept going with the.

22:34.517 --> 22:53.255
with the Star Trek show they just kept going with the script that they were giving and I thought that I had convinced them that they should change the script that they should that they should you know pull the Enterprise out and go back to impulse power turn away from the Romulans go back to Federation space and get out of the neutral zone and they just won't listen to me.

22:53.655 --> 23:09.647
And for five years, I've been breathlessly trying to explain to them how, you know, arguing about whether or not we have to get out of the neutral zone or whether the neutral zone is a mandated reinforced area is kind of a dumb argument if the Romulans are gonna kill you when you go there.

23:09.707 --> 23:13.690
Except all this drama wasn't about Star Trek and Romulans.

23:13.750 --> 23:21.316
It was about biology and pandemics and RNA viruses and PCR tests and people dying.

23:23.206 --> 23:36.051
And so the people that were on stage were scripted not to talk about the real reasons why people were dying, to insist on a consensus, including the captain, you know, Robert Malone or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:36.091 --> 23:40.613
or Donald Trump, insisting that there was a virus that we had to make some hard choices for.

23:40.673 --> 23:43.054
And he made some pretty good choices, including warp speed.

23:45.359 --> 23:50.081
Now what we have to realize, and I think this is crucially important, I'm gonna turn down the sound effects here.

23:50.561 --> 24:00.565
You have to realize that while we have been paying attention to Star Trek here, something else very malevolent has been going on in the Middle East.

24:01.925 --> 24:07.647
And that is about to be blamed on the conservative right in America.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.748
Now the conservative right in America is not a real movement.

24:10.828 --> 24:12.789
It's not like there's a t-shirt or a hat.

24:13.249 --> 24:14.890
But they want you to believe it is.

24:16.866 --> 24:18.767
Stephen Colbert wants you to believe it is.

24:18.847 --> 24:20.428
Jimmy Kimmel wants you to believe it is.

24:20.548 --> 24:22.208
Robert Malone wants you to believe it is.

24:22.308 --> 24:23.849
Maha wants you to believe it is.

24:23.929 --> 24:27.191
Joe Rogan wants you to believe it is, that it's one conservative movement.

24:27.291 --> 24:41.057
So that when they say that the conservative movement has discredited itself and that the leaders of the conservative movement might even be, you know, guilty of war crimes, that is going to be on us unless we pull our heads out now.

24:43.134 --> 24:51.799
Because like it or not, if you can see through Alex Jones, but you're still kind of arguing on the conservative side of things, then that's the team you're on.

24:52.760 --> 25:01.325
You can't say like, I don't know, like Janet Reno in the chat said yesterday, that I could see through Laura Loomer a long time ago.

25:01.385 --> 25:02.886
This is not new information.

25:03.426 --> 25:04.367
That's not the point.

25:04.867 --> 25:12.312
Laura Loomer, Sasha Latupova, her sister Soph, or her daughter Soph, excuse me, Alex Jones,

25:13.092 --> 25:21.476
Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone, they are all by social media design tied to the conservative right.

25:21.536 --> 25:28.920
And so when they decide to say everybody who stood up for Israel without exception or didn't stand up for Gaza like

25:29.460 --> 25:40.473
Donald Trump and everybody else in the Maha movement because we've been paying too much attention to whether we should have Casey Means as Surgeon General or whether we should, you know, ban this RNA or that RNA.

25:40.513 --> 25:46.480
We haven't been paying attention to other things, which the other side is paying attention to a lot.

25:47.745 --> 25:48.806
And this is by design.

25:49.226 --> 25:51.127
This is the trap that's now closing.

25:51.167 --> 25:58.291
And unfortunately, the jaws of this trap are going to fracture the conservative part of America.

25:58.331 --> 26:01.473
Because the other part of America, they don't need to worry about.

26:01.513 --> 26:03.294
They're governing them very effectively.

26:03.635 --> 26:05.376
PBS NewsHour works on them.

26:05.796 --> 26:07.357
Democracy Now works on them.

26:10.063 --> 26:21.969
But the best part I can give you and the best thing that I can tell you is that the absurdities on both sides are what allow them, the lesser versions of both to coexist.

26:22.109 --> 26:27.852
You know, you can see through Laura Loomer and it doesn't matter if you're a conservative and you don't disown her, then you're done.

26:28.872 --> 26:37.957
You can see through the Joe Biden and the Harris thing, but if you don't actually disown that part of the democratic, you know, narrative, then you're done.

26:38.991 --> 26:43.735
then the red people will dismiss you, then the blue people will dismiss you.

26:43.796 --> 26:50.722
And so somewhere in the middle here is a, wow, we've both been played by a national security state.

26:51.222 --> 26:55.587
We have both been watching bad versions of a Star Trek show,

26:56.187 --> 27:01.269
the most ridiculous episodes of which are obviously absurd on both sides.

27:01.709 --> 27:07.552
And yet both sides have been convinced not to admit that their absurd episodes are absurd.

27:07.912 --> 27:09.173
They're just kind of ignoring them.

27:09.313 --> 27:12.094
Oh, I already saw through Alex Jones and Lauren Loomer.

27:12.174 --> 27:15.015
Oh, I already knew that Harris was kind of a windbag.

27:15.035 --> 27:18.717
I already knew that there must be smarter people behind Biden.

27:21.451 --> 27:25.253
Oh, I knew that the Russian hoax was a little bit over the top.

27:25.313 --> 27:33.837
Well, obviously Donald Trump is not the most clever guy, or he's not the most ethical guy, but he's still a very good businessman.

27:34.297 --> 27:45.303
And these kinds of cognitive dissonance exist on both sides, but right now, it is the critically thinking conservative right in America that's been set up for a disaster.

27:46.465 --> 27:51.309
because all of the people that we are following and arguing with, remember, right?

27:51.329 --> 27:56.953
We're texting these people on the Star Trek Enterprise set, and we're hoping that they're going to change their mind.

27:57.374 --> 28:03.738
You know, Mary Talley Bowden is working really hard on X to make sure that, you know, maybe somebody will listen to her about the mRNAs.

28:03.799 --> 28:05.980
And so, man, oh, man, I'm frustrated.

28:07.281 --> 28:08.122
And that's a theater.

28:09.093 --> 28:14.636
That is all a theater being performed by people who are being compensated for being part of that theater.

28:14.657 --> 28:23.682
And that governance theater is keeping you from realizing that America's governance and the control of our government is not in our hands anymore.

28:25.223 --> 28:26.424
It's very, very bad.

28:28.174 --> 28:33.536
And we think that the Maha movement, the podcasts that they're doing is evidence of work getting done.

28:33.596 --> 28:34.336
It's not.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.477
There are empty desks.

28:36.737 --> 28:38.657
There are people that need hiring.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.818
There are people that don't believe in the government anymore.

28:40.878 --> 28:41.998
There's funding gone.

28:42.038 --> 28:47.560
There's all kinds of chaos behind the scenes in a way that's not been there before in America.

28:47.580 --> 28:51.981
And it's not clear whether this tailspin can be reversed.

28:52.081 --> 28:57.283
I don't really know, especially if both sides are very interested in maintaining the tailspin.

28:58.679 --> 29:10.607
if in fact there isn't both sides, but it's just Obama, Trump, Biden, Trump, all one continuous administration running the United States into the ground.

29:11.327 --> 29:16.251
And more importantly, running the United States into the ground while using the

29:17.148 --> 29:19.730
you know, a faux conservative movement to do it.

29:19.770 --> 29:34.398
So they actually will achieve multiple, multiple goals if this succeeds, because the Christian right in America would be permanently sort of discredited by people like Bobby Kennedy, who says that he prays 30 minutes every day.

29:34.439 --> 29:44.825
And the answer to his prayers was Donald Trump, like Sherry Tenpenny, who says she's been fighting the vaccine schedule for 25 years because God told her to, or even Donald Trump,

29:45.425 --> 29:55.153
holds up a Bible, we know that God or Jesus or any entity or thought or concept like that is not governing what he does.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.135
That's not governing what any of these people do.

29:58.175 --> 30:02.578
They don't have the humility to admit there are things in the world that they don't understand.

30:03.399 --> 30:05.841
Because they're too busy thinking about the things they control.

30:07.717 --> 30:14.002
So I do think there's a way out, but it's a way out that involves Americans, all Americans eating crow.

30:14.282 --> 30:18.044
All Americans have to admit that they didn't know what was going on.

30:18.104 --> 30:32.755
And it may be that the conservative right in America right now is gonna be made more of a fool of, but the bottom line is a spectrum of genders is just as ridiculous as believing that Donald Trump is going to save the American democracy.

30:34.451 --> 30:41.556
Talking about a man who wants to become a woman as a trans woman is just dumb.

30:41.636 --> 30:42.576
It's a trans man.

30:42.636 --> 30:43.677
That's easy to solve.

30:43.717 --> 30:44.598
That's no problem.

30:44.618 --> 30:53.063
Yet both sides seem to agree that trans women are men that want to be women, which just doesn't make any semantic sense.

30:53.184 --> 31:00.028
But you can see how inverting those two terms makes it very hard for people to see through it.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.971
And in fact, very easy to bludgeon kids over the head with this idea.

31:04.951 --> 31:07.212
I don't think there's any biological basis for it.

31:07.232 --> 31:11.935
And again, I just think that the way forward is to reject both sides.

31:12.075 --> 31:14.856
Get off of social media, start reading books.

31:15.957 --> 31:28.263
You know, you could think of that Pai Mei video we looked at yesterday as, you know, you can read books like a human or you can sleep on the floor like a dog and look at and read whatever your phone gives you to read.

31:28.283 --> 31:29.804
Because that's really where we are.

31:30.652 --> 31:34.293
We need to realize that there's no convenience on social media.

31:34.813 --> 31:40.595
There's no, um, you know, entertainment really on social media, unless you use it within great intention.

31:42.156 --> 31:48.438
If you're not using social media with great intention and great discernment, social media will enslave you.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.258
It will ruin you.

31:51.019 --> 31:54.860
And more importantly, and more, more importantly, it will ruin your kids.

31:56.127 --> 32:01.251
So, you know, people can say that I'm not offering an alternative, but I think I actually am.

32:01.311 --> 32:11.780
I have a soapbox instance that is gigaohmbiological.com, and that soapbox instance is essentially the same as Truth Social, which is the same as Blue Sky.

32:13.001 --> 32:16.682
As far as being cutting edge and offering an alternative, I don't know what else I can do.

32:16.783 --> 32:26.506
So I also have built a Peertube website, which is a decentralized, federated version of a YouTube kind of video hoster.

32:26.926 --> 32:28.047
It has its own app.

32:28.527 --> 32:38.411
If you download that Peertube app and enter the URL stream.gigaohm.bio, you will have the live stream and the recent posts of my work and Mark's work.

32:39.131 --> 32:46.815
on your phone with no login, no data collection, and extremely stable streaming of videos.

32:46.875 --> 32:50.017
So I can't tell you enough how much this kicks ass.

32:50.858 --> 32:52.238
I can only tell you to download it.

32:52.258 --> 32:56.001
I hope your phone isn't too old to use it because it's a game changer for me.

32:56.201 --> 32:58.062
And I think it will be a game changer for you.

32:59.082 --> 33:03.405
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been governed by scripted actors for a long, long time.

33:04.205 --> 33:09.470
Um, and the trick for me is to try and point those scripted actors out last three years.

33:10.211 --> 33:10.872
I mean, for sure.

33:10.952 --> 33:13.254
One of those scripted actors is Jessica Rose here.

33:13.294 --> 33:26.367
You can see a video recorded from her in 2023, but only released in a documentary produced in 2025, where she says she's uniquely qualified to speak about the events of the last few years because she has five degrees.

33:27.864 --> 33:29.825
What she's really talking about are post-docs.

33:29.865 --> 33:31.125
This is a total fraud.

33:31.605 --> 33:37.107
Somebody who's on a script provided by Robert Malone and probably NATO or Horditra or something like that.

33:37.167 --> 33:43.068
But Jessica Rose is one of the more egregious, fraudulent adults on earth.

33:44.209 --> 33:48.530
Because she spent the last five years pretending to be something and someone that she's not.

33:49.310 --> 34:03.407
and for any of you that have fallen for this schtick that is jessica rose please download the spars pandemic document look on page 47 through 53 and read about the epi girl character because that's what this shithead is

34:04.397 --> 34:15.886
This is just somebody who has taken a lot of money on Substack, and a lot of money from Brownstone, and a lot of money from IMA, and a lot of money from FLCC to talk about nonsense, scripted nonsense.

34:15.947 --> 34:18.729
She may not even write all of her Substacks.

34:19.469 --> 34:24.454
Just like Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone definitely don't write all of their Substacks.

34:25.168 --> 34:41.579
And so you really need to understand that your family and friends may have been bamboozled by an extremely aggressive and extremely advanced version of psychological warfare that involved actors on social media.

34:42.139 --> 34:43.160
And here's the trick.

34:44.441 --> 34:45.302
Did this thing work?

34:46.442 --> 34:46.703
It did.

34:47.263 --> 34:49.064
So here's the trick.

34:49.665 --> 34:49.965
Okay.

34:50.025 --> 34:50.965
Oops, that's the wrong one.

34:51.065 --> 34:51.686
That's the right one.

34:52.901 --> 34:56.866
For me, what I don't know what I'm doing here, I'm not producing very well.

34:57.366 --> 35:00.430
For me, the trick is to think about this list right here.

35:01.751 --> 35:07.758
This is the list that breaks the illusion for me because when I put this list together, I thought, wow, imagine that.

35:08.658 --> 35:28.067
Okay, so this list says tweets per day, words per week on Substack, Substack's comments per day, per week, podcasts per week, DMs, texts, signal chats per week, telegram groups and telegram messages per week, and the number of telephone numbers that somebody has.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.989
Now, I want you to imagine a scenario, because this only occurred to me recently.

35:32.765 --> 35:39.189
I want you to imagine a scenario that you wanted to fool somebody like me into thinking that they were teaching Brent Weinstein biology.

35:40.890 --> 35:51.315
The way that you would do it is you'd put this guy on a signal chat and then have a Zoom drink with all the people in the signal chat in the first week of the signal chat.

35:51.355 --> 35:54.097
And then after that, never see each other again.

35:55.168 --> 36:04.137
And so essentially, after one Zoom meeting, I was convinced that the signal chat had the same people in it that the Zoom meeting did.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.960
But I don't know that for sure.

36:08.161 --> 36:18.432
And in fact, the way that Brett Weinstein reacted to me in 2024 at the Pittsburgh Brownstone event finally makes sense to me.

36:19.571 --> 36:22.892
because I wasn't teaching him biology in that signal chat.

36:22.932 --> 36:26.014
I was teaching his handler or handlers the biology.

36:26.494 --> 36:36.498
And that's why Brett Weinstein and his wife both mentioned me a couple of times in kind of a weak sort of, we don't really know this guy kind of way.

36:36.558 --> 36:41.280
And certainly we don't know his website or what he's really trying to do because they weren't interacting with me.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.141
Here's the scary part.

36:44.021 --> 36:46.182
If you think about how that could be done,

36:47.549 --> 36:52.811
How many people were getting direct messages from Peter McCullough on Instagram?

36:53.611 --> 36:59.473
How many people got direct messages from Peter McCullough on Telegram groups or on Twitter?

37:01.333 --> 37:04.754
How many people got direct messages from Peter McCullough on Substack?

37:04.794 --> 37:08.715
How many people got direct messages from Peter McCullough on Gab or anywhere else?

37:08.795 --> 37:13.637
And then think about how many of those people can verify it was actually Peter McCullough.

37:15.626 --> 37:21.530
How many signal chats was Ryan Cole in versus how many did people think he was in?

37:22.190 --> 37:31.776
Maybe you thought you were in the only signal chat that Ryan Cole was in when in reality he was in 10,000 different signal chats with 50,000 people.

37:33.297 --> 37:43.324
And there would be no way for us to verify that because if you're in a signal chat with 150 people and one of them's Ryan Cole and every once in a while he posts, as far as you're concerned, he's in that group.

37:44.588 --> 37:51.797
But fifth generation warfare wouldn't need to get very complicated for that to be an illusion.

37:53.194 --> 38:12.024
Ryan Cole could be on an island somewhere with his wife and kids playing volleyball and posting hundreds of Substack comments a day, tweeting hundreds of times a day, putting out hundreds of thousands of words on Substack, answering all the DMs on Instagram and all the DMs on Twitter.

38:12.405 --> 38:22.010
And every one of those people would have no idea that he was playing volleyball on a beach because later on in the afternoon, a recorded podcast is going to broadcast and it looks like he's working hard.

38:24.522 --> 38:28.483
Now I'm not saying that I have any first-hand knowledge that that's what Ryan Cole did.

38:28.523 --> 38:34.024
What I want you to entertain the possibility of is that all the DMs that you got aren't real.

38:34.764 --> 38:37.865
All the communications that you've had with these people are not real.

38:38.665 --> 38:42.666
But they could easily be made to appear real.

38:45.146 --> 38:49.547
Especially if the responses are very limited or there's a lot of people in the group.

38:51.428 --> 38:55.671
That's a pretty deep and magical level of enchantment.

38:55.711 --> 39:01.896
If you thought that you were in a special group that Ryan Cole and, you know, Sukrit Bhakti and Thomas Binder were in these groups.

39:01.976 --> 39:02.796
I was in a great group.

39:02.856 --> 39:06.459
It was called like the, you know, air free asylum, man.

39:06.519 --> 39:06.779
Oh man.

39:06.819 --> 39:08.781
I felt so powerful when I was in that group.

39:08.841 --> 39:11.522
And every time I tapped in there, I got a message right back.

39:14.224 --> 39:20.329
Can you imagine if they, you know, there's no ethics, there's no limits to what they'll do.

39:22.133 --> 39:23.715
And maybe Ryan Cole was everywhere.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.380
Maybe Jessica Rose was everywhere.

39:28.481 --> 39:30.244
Maybe they used Jessica Rose twin.

39:32.366 --> 39:34.309
Again, there's no limits to what they will do.

39:34.429 --> 39:36.872
And all of these things are child's play.

39:36.912 --> 39:37.934
Like this is a joke.

39:40.455 --> 39:54.939
How are you going to count all the substack comments that somebody puts out per day and count how many DMs they send on Twitter and how many posts they do on Facebook and how many signal chats they're in and how many signal messages they sent?

39:54.999 --> 39:55.919
How would you ever know?

39:56.500 --> 39:59.601
Nevermind the actual text messages and phone calls they make.

40:01.341 --> 40:04.002
And how easy would it be for them to game that?

40:06.583 --> 40:07.963
Because that's what I think they did.

40:10.506 --> 40:20.210
And they did that with Jessica Rose and probably Asim Malhotra, probably Robert Malone, probably Sasha Latupova, probably Pierre Corey, probably Jessica Cockett.

40:20.450 --> 40:25.833
All these people have had an extended reach just by that kind of fake amplification.

40:29.414 --> 40:36.477
And so fifth generation warfare is all of these kinds of groups and the people that run them and how they're set up and how they work.

40:36.657 --> 40:38.498
That's fifth generation warfare.

40:39.159 --> 40:40.039
That's it for sure.

40:41.769 --> 41:08.006
just like this is fifth generation warfare, organizing some Senate hearing that's supposed to expose something or having Senator Ron Johnson on CHD tonight at eight o'clock to talk about vaccine injuries with Polly Tommy, the foreign agent, and Brian Hooker, the guy who used to not say autism back in 2013, but now he's building a big top tent of health freedom with a smile on his face, saving no kids from anything.

41:13.789 --> 41:22.433
And so Trump derangement syndrome was created by a group of people, some of whom were connected to all the same comedy club in LA.

41:23.974 --> 41:37.760
Many of them are connected through Larry David and Seinfeld and Steve Bannon and Teal and Rogan, RFK and Skyhorse Publishing.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.981
It's all one shit show.

41:40.885 --> 41:42.867
This lady is friends with them.

41:43.027 --> 41:44.629
It's all one shit show.

41:46.131 --> 41:48.453
This lady, I think was at that comedy club too.

41:48.514 --> 41:49.495
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

41:49.555 --> 41:52.298
They, they like, she worked with Steve Bannon.

41:52.338 --> 41:54.700
Like this is all one show.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.745
That's why Jimmy Kimmel is on the show too.

41:58.785 --> 42:02.089
That this all one show, it's just all one show.

42:05.902 --> 42:11.583
And there's no way to avoid the truth that this was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

42:11.623 --> 42:13.804
There's an easy list to describe what they did.

42:14.244 --> 42:15.744
It's manslaughter and lies.

42:17.144 --> 42:26.686
Endemicity is a myth that Ralph Baric and Tony Fauci have been telling us for decades now, that even somebody like Jeffrey Sachs believes in.

42:27.467 --> 42:34.348
And nobody, none of these people seem to care or be able to enunciate that, well, one way they could have got rid of it with this is placebo.

42:35.700 --> 42:51.821
No one, literally no one can explain how placebos would be a boon to both manufacturing quotas and also to greatly reduce the safety signal, which of course, Jessica Rose and CHD and Steve Kirsch have been yelling about forever.

42:52.301 --> 42:53.362
Bare signal, man.

42:55.686 --> 42:58.088
Everybody's still using PCR to find the ghost.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.689
Nobody has stopped that yet.

42:59.749 --> 43:01.551
That's because this is by design.

43:01.591 --> 43:05.073
They are on a script and it's not in their script to stop the PCR test.

43:05.113 --> 43:09.477
It's not in their script to question the bio fire PCR test.

43:09.537 --> 43:11.819
It's not in their script to save our children.

43:11.919 --> 43:13.420
That's why we have to do it ourselves.

43:15.765 --> 43:19.447
And so I've been trying very hard to say it as succinctly as possible.

43:19.487 --> 43:20.768
I think I'm getting really close now.

43:20.828 --> 43:23.630
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

43:24.310 --> 43:27.552
Transfection of healthy humans was a crime and it remains so.

43:28.072 --> 43:32.215
RNA cannot pandemic and autism is a meaningless word by design.

43:32.295 --> 43:34.076
Autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

43:34.877 --> 43:38.459
We can break this, but not if you're going to choose to wear a blue hat.

43:39.540 --> 43:45.445
Not if you believe that the Trump administration is destroying our democracy, you know, but the Biden administration wasn't.

43:46.026 --> 43:49.729
COVID was a public health disaster of dumb people is not what it was.

43:49.769 --> 43:58.416
It was brainwashed people and people that were the target of a decade long, maybe even two decades long PR program.

43:58.476 --> 44:01.799
Pandemics do not happen, but that's what the blue people believe.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.962
And the blue people also believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:05.022 --> 44:06.003
is killing kids.

44:07.540 --> 44:10.461
So you better pull your head out and realize what your neighbors think.

44:13.461 --> 44:19.782
Oh, there's bad news of fans of living, because Health Secretary RFK Jr.

44:19.822 --> 44:23.803
just pulled $500 million in funding for vaccine development.

44:24.403 --> 44:30.625
Now, we have 10 more months of this show, and I want to give a measured nonpartisan response here.

44:30.645 --> 44:33.005
F*** you, you roid-addled nepo-cum.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.126
I mean, what should scare you is the applause.

44:38.424 --> 44:45.537
I mean, there could, there is a stage director there who's going like this, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

44:46.178 --> 44:47.901
But it's still scary.

44:47.921 --> 44:51.667
Specifically.

44:52.796 --> 44:54.717
Specifically, Bobby Jr.

44:54.797 --> 44:58.378
is nixing 22 projects that use mRNA technology.

44:58.638 --> 45:00.859
But that's the latest vaccine technology.

45:01.379 --> 45:04.460
That's like saying, kids, I'm turning off the GPS.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.321
We're going to make our way to six flags by using the stars.

45:08.642 --> 45:10.022
Hand Daddy the sextant.

45:14.944 --> 45:15.224
Yes.

45:15.844 --> 45:18.405
Crank down Windows in Daddy's car.

45:18.425 --> 45:19.065
There you go.

45:19.205 --> 45:20.586
All right, there you go.

45:21.661 --> 45:25.382
Now, yesterday, yesterday, RFK Jr.

45:25.422 --> 45:27.222
tried to defend the indefensible.

45:27.762 --> 45:37.724
Most of these shots are for flu or COVID, but as the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract.

45:38.284 --> 45:38.924
Counterpoint.

45:38.944 --> 45:45.625
F*** you, you roadkill-munching, red-eyed, human slim Jim.

45:45.945 --> 45:48.306
You're gonna kill people.

45:50.928 --> 45:51.388
Why?

45:52.228 --> 45:57.170
Why would you say that mRNA vaccines don't perform well against upper-repertory infections?

45:57.210 --> 46:02.572
The National Institutes of Health said they prevented an estimated 14.4 million deaths.

46:03.632 --> 46:04.132
Why?

46:04.812 --> 46:07.113
Why on Earth is RFK Jr.

46:07.133 --> 46:09.234
so anxious to fill our streets with dead bodies?

46:09.474 --> 46:10.874
These are my two ravens.

46:12.675 --> 46:13.035
Oh, right.

46:13.055 --> 46:13.955
I forgot.

46:14.615 --> 46:15.196
I forgot.

46:16.296 --> 46:16.776
I forgot.

46:16.836 --> 46:18.177
They do love the eyeballs.

46:20.111 --> 46:22.553
Experts say mRNA vaccines are safe.

46:22.673 --> 46:32.142
And a University of Minnesota professor of infectious diseases pandemic preparation said, I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business.

46:32.442 --> 46:37.586
And keep in mind, 50 years ago, the base of the food pyramid was menthol cigarettes.

46:39.548 --> 46:45.173
Now, the Trump administration, Trump administration is always also trying to end science up in space because we just

46:46.858 --> 47:05.604
I find that quite remarkable because yes, he has eight months more of driving that fire, fanning the flames of morons that have believed the narrative from the beginning and the more dangerous narrative, the one that says that their fellow Americans put people at risk and made the pandemic worse.

47:06.744 --> 47:11.106
Those people are out there and they might be more numerous than us.

47:11.206 --> 47:13.547
These people believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:13.607 --> 47:14.407
is killing kids.

47:15.950 --> 47:21.220
And so we need to pull our heads out, ladies and gentlemen, and start calling it for what it is.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.542
These people are frauds.

47:23.263 --> 47:25.367
They were an elaborate operation.

47:25.407 --> 47:26.349
We were set up.

47:26.950 --> 47:27.711
We're sorry.

47:30.979 --> 47:33.703
And we want to correct this mission right now.

47:33.743 --> 47:38.069
We want to correct this course right now, because this is bad news, ladies and gentlemen.

47:38.089 --> 47:39.331
It's bad, bad, bad news.

47:47.162 --> 47:49.743
for mRNA vaccine development.

47:50.103 --> 48:01.528
You'll remember that mRNA vaccines were vital in fighting COVID-19, and they're seen as a key tool to control future pandemics because they can be manufactured quickly.

48:02.028 --> 48:07.450
Even Trump's former Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, said this move will cost lives.

48:08.011 --> 48:15.914
Anna Merlin, reporter for Mother Jones, wrote about RFK's war on these immunizations, and here she is with Hari Sreenivasan.

48:16.869 --> 48:17.750
Christiane, thanks.

48:17.770 --> 48:22.774
Anna Merlin, you recently wrote a piece in Mother Jones titled The Plot Against Vaccines.

48:22.914 --> 48:24.275
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.638
and his allies have hit on a way to undermine immunization.

48:28.159 --> 48:31.601
First, I guess, let's just sort of break down the article bit by bit.

48:32.542 --> 48:34.604
Is there an overarching plot?

48:34.824 --> 48:36.005
I think this guy's Indian.

48:37.326 --> 48:39.168
Or how far along are we in this?

48:39.642 --> 48:39.882
Right.

48:39.982 --> 48:52.533
My colleague, Keira Butler, and I, who co-wrote the article with me, looked at sort of a series of steps that Mr. Kennedy and the people he's installed at HHS have taken to, frankly, endanger the vaccine supply.

48:52.613 --> 49:01.881
And we looked at both things that could potentially hurt the people trying to get vaccinated, could deter companies from making vaccines.

49:01.941 --> 49:07.786
And we also looked at the ways that he's trying to overhaul the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which works to

49:08.502 --> 49:11.083
compensate people who allege that they've been injured by vaccines.

49:11.143 --> 49:16.446
So it's a pretty systematic approach and it is frankly moving very, very quickly.

49:16.526 --> 49:19.547
A lot of public health experts we talk to are really, really concerned.

49:20.048 --> 49:23.549
Okay, let's start with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

49:23.709 --> 49:30.793
I'm pretty safe in assuming that a majority of Americans don't even know what that is and how it works.

49:31.053 --> 49:31.813
Explain what it is.

49:32.594 --> 49:36.355
So the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established in the 1980s.

49:38.186 --> 49:42.949
after a scare over DTP vaccines, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis.

49:43.069 --> 49:57.679
Basically, throughout the 1970s, there were a growing number of personal injury lawsuits alleging injuries from DTP vaccines and the amount of money being asked for from those lawsuits kept skyrocketing.

49:57.739 --> 50:07.606
So by the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, drug manufacturers were increasingly reluctant to make those vaccines and indeed to make vaccines at all.

50:08.508 --> 50:12.122
despite the fact that most public health experts and scientists who looked at these

50:12.830 --> 50:18.574
Lawsuits didn't necessarily think that the injuries that were being alleged came from these vaccines.

50:19.094 --> 50:32.064
So there started to be a real nationwide concern over the vaccine supply, endangering the vaccine supply, which of course doesn't just hurt the US, it also hurts the rest of the world because a lot of major drug companies are housed here in the US.

50:32.564 --> 50:39.629
So basically, they came up with this system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that went into effect a few years later,

50:40.109 --> 50:50.539
that essentially created what is called a no-fault system, where people who allege that they or their children were injured by vaccines go into this specialized program that is set up to compensate them.

50:52.030 --> 50:55.892
where people like Aaron Seery are paid whether they win the case or not.

50:55.992 --> 51:04.517
So now she's gonna tell you that most of them just get paid out and it seems like a pretty friendly little place, but I'm not sure it's that simple, but Aaron Seery loves it.

51:04.557 --> 51:11.681
And Aaron Seery just wants the COVID shots to be on the VICP so that he can make lots of money from it.

51:11.741 --> 51:15.183
That's also what Robert F. Kennedy Jr's son does for a living.

51:20.282 --> 51:21.582
I have a little pause here, there we go.

51:21.622 --> 51:27.444
Most cases, about 60% of cases are heard without going into a courtroom, so to speak.

51:28.185 --> 51:35.307
The system is actually designed to compensate people very quickly, even if the injuries aren't necessarily proved to be caused by vaccines.

51:35.327 --> 51:36.547
It's a pretty unique program.

51:36.907 --> 51:44.870
And then the cases that are heard in a courtroom of sorts are heard by what are called special masters, who are judicial appointees who are specially trained

51:45.350 --> 52:02.644
in vaccine law, vaccine cases, the science around vaccines, the sort of established system about how... So if most Americans have never heard about this, the way that she's explaining it, it sounds very friendly, very easy, and it seems like it errs on the side of paying people out even if they can't really prove it.

52:04.474 --> 52:08.757
Which is a pretty... not... I don't think that's totally true.

52:09.538 --> 52:14.822
Although, you know, we'd have to talk to somebody like Rolf Hazlehorst or somebody like that before we'd really figure it out.

52:15.303 --> 52:20.066
The trick is to understand, and I think she's going to say it very soon, that there is a pre...

52:21.067 --> 52:27.235
determined list of things that they compensate for, and autism is not on that list.

52:27.295 --> 52:30.099
Now, why would autism not be on that list?

52:30.139 --> 52:36.788
Well, one of the reasons why autism is not on that list is because autism is not a very well-defined disease.

52:38.146 --> 52:54.889
In fact, I think if you start listening carefully to the no-virus people and to the bullshitters on any side, you will quickly hear people using the words diseases and illness in a very loose umbrella way, just in the same way they use the word vaccine.

52:55.349 --> 52:58.210
And vaccine doesn't mean any more than illness does.

52:59.230 --> 53:01.930
It is a general term that, like, stink.

53:03.330 --> 53:04.051
Or, uh...

53:08.140 --> 53:10.282
What is another good term for that kind of thing?

53:10.362 --> 53:21.449
Warm, you know, I mean, it's not very, you know, if you could tell somebody that it's 98 degrees outside, or you could say it was warm outside, which one of those is more specific?

53:21.509 --> 53:24.371
Well, if you say vaccine, you're not being very specific.

53:24.431 --> 53:28.234
If you say illness and how does it spread, you're not being very specific.

53:28.274 --> 53:33.338
If you say contagious illnesses and not a thing, you're not really being very specific.

53:33.378 --> 53:36.340
And in fact, by saying something so aspecific,

53:36.840 --> 53:49.144
You're saying something that from the perspective of communication, it could sound very profound to the person with the right assumptions, or it could sound very retarded to a person with a different set of assumptions.

53:49.204 --> 53:58.888
And so that lack of precision is happening here right now, where she's describing in a very favorable way something that I think Ralph Hazlehorse would describe in a very different way.

53:59.828 --> 54:10.234
And the idea here is to make it seem as though, and I think they're right, that the anti-vax movement in America is almost exclusively bullshit, because it actually is.

54:12.355 --> 54:25.943
And it's going to take a few months for us to really teach our way out of this so that we can show people that there is an anti-vax position to take, but it's not an anti-vax position, it's an anti-intermuscular injection position.

54:27.017 --> 54:29.798
It's an anti-preservative injection position.

54:29.878 --> 54:32.679
It's an anti-untested adjuvant position.

54:33.159 --> 54:41.362
It's an anti-intramuscular injection position, an anti-augmenting your immune system willy-nilly position.

54:43.122 --> 54:46.143
It's not vaccines cause autism.

54:48.224 --> 54:50.485
It's not a big top tent of health freedom.

54:51.539 --> 54:55.723
It is a very precise way of talking about what these people are lying about.

54:55.923 --> 54:57.244
RNA can't do that.

55:00.066 --> 55:02.628
It's called transfection, and it always was.

55:03.089 --> 55:09.074
And, for the love of goodness, intramuscular injection's a dumb idea from the late 1800s, early 1900s.

55:13.436 --> 55:24.728
Remember that Mother Jones is the actual magazine, including Mother Jones and Rolling Stone, where all of these measles articles were put back in the day for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

55:24.687 --> 55:25.969
's, you know, seeded narrative.

55:26.629 --> 55:28.992
Some vaccines can, in very rare cases,

55:29.540 --> 55:31.401
cause some injury to some people.

55:31.541 --> 55:34.042
So it is a pretty revolutionary system.

55:34.122 --> 55:42.847
And while it people who work within it, you know, like the attorneys who represent vaccine injured people would tell you that it is in need of some updates.

55:43.367 --> 55:45.849
By and large, it has been working pretty well since the 1980s.

55:47.165 --> 55:48.705
So this seems like a compromise.

55:48.845 --> 55:55.367
On the one hand, the public health infrastructure says, listen, vaccines overall are important.

55:55.947 --> 55:58.908
And at the same time, there might be injuries.

55:59.488 --> 55:59.868
Is that right?

56:00.388 --> 56:01.229
Yeah, that's correct.

56:01.309 --> 56:09.491
I mean, broadly, we know and we have known for centuries at this point that vaccination is a good thing and it is good for public health.

56:09.771 --> 56:10.691
Centuries.

56:12.552 --> 56:13.332
Stop lying.

56:15.017 --> 56:36.070
i don't think she's lying i don't think she knows but it's not centuries however like every medical product it is not risk-free for absolutely everyone so this not for absolutely everyone so you know like neil degrasse tyson when he was on the high wire and explaining how some people can't get vaccinated because they have a condition that doesn't allow that to happen stop lying

56:37.845 --> 56:38.306
Lion!

56:38.606 --> 56:54.300
It's so dumb because we're getting right back to the James Lyons Weiler pitch of environmental and genetic causes of autism and maybe some people are genetically vulnerable to the components of vaccines so we're gonna have to screen everybody on a medical and genetic basis to make vaccine schedules safer.

56:55.943 --> 57:04.446
basically concludes that it is our social responsibility to compensate those very few people who might be injured by vaccines.

57:05.126 --> 57:11.428
It's our social responsibility to compensate those small number of people who are injured by vaccines.

57:11.488 --> 57:13.989
And it could very well be a small number of people.

57:16.090 --> 57:21.572
But they don't compensate people whose kids lose eye contact and start shitting against the wall.

57:24.778 --> 57:26.419
and they don't call that autism.

57:26.479 --> 57:29.241
They just say that vaccines cause autism.

57:29.281 --> 57:50.617
You see the absolute ridiculousness of Polly Tommy saying that she cured her son with secretant injections and was in the newspaper in the UK, but now is in America years later with a ranch in Austin, rich and famous, in front of the Senate, talking about the injury of her child.

57:51.604 --> 58:10.346
when she was on a newspaper in the UK saying her child was cured by injections of secretin recommended by Andrew Wakefield, who's now also in America, owning property in Austin, Texas, and being paraded around as a hero, including allowed to speak in front of our governing bodies.

58:12.972 --> 58:26.721
And in fact, those people are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., behind him with Merrill Nass and Mary Holland, two extreme frauds, and Robert Malone, a deep state insider, DITRA, DOD, et cetera.

58:28.463 --> 58:31.885
And so we have been set up by a very elaborate con.

58:32.265 --> 58:35.147
And that long con is about to be dropped on our heads.

58:38.089 --> 58:39.870
It doesn't mean that she's right.

58:39.930 --> 58:41.912
It doesn't mean that, that, that,

58:42.879 --> 58:48.183
Sreenivasan is a genius, it means that the script is written so that we lose.

58:48.863 --> 58:49.964
And you need to see it.

58:51.285 --> 58:59.832
And it won't do you any good to argue with them or tell them the subtle nuances of what they're not getting right, because these people are going to be in charge in a couple years.

59:00.372 --> 59:02.654
Because Donald Trump is not going to be in charge.

59:03.034 --> 59:04.055
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:04.095 --> 59:05.656
is not going to be running for office.

59:08.581 --> 59:17.614
And if AOC and Buttigieg are in charge, then this kind of mentality will again become the norm, the accepted reality.

59:18.035 --> 59:19.697
And for a lot of people, it still is.

59:20.632 --> 59:26.254
And so instead of fighting for something, instead of the truth getting out, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:26.294 --> 59:35.216
and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense have been telling us on stage at all their stupid conferences, the truth is not getting out at all.

59:35.897 --> 59:40.318
And in fact, for the last 15 years, those people have been scripted to fuck it up.

59:42.571 --> 59:44.753
They've been scripted not to save anybody.

59:44.813 --> 59:51.238
And in fact, they let people run right into the jaws of the trap for the first three years of the pandemic.

59:51.298 --> 59:57.082
And now after five or six years, they're trying to tell us that they always knew and they did not.

01:00:00.004 --> 01:00:12.234
And the only reason why these people aren't aware that the transfections were actually nasty and should have never been given is that the vast majority were probably placebo and neither side can figure that out because it's a script.

01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:14.552
They're acting!

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:18.221
And to do so quickly.

01:00:19.005 --> 01:00:24.708
So what are some of the examples of people who have been in front of this system who get paid out?

01:00:24.948 --> 01:00:29.391
So if you look at HRSA.gov, you can see that there are so-called table injuries.

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:35.054
There is a list of vaccines and the supposed injuries that can, in some rare cases, be caused by them, right?

01:00:35.455 --> 01:00:38.696
And so you can see that there are things like encephalitis.

01:00:39.017 --> 01:00:42.519
One of the most common injuries is actually not an allergic reaction.

01:00:42.699 --> 01:00:46.341
It is what's called serva, which is a shoulder injury that can happen if the

01:00:46.801 --> 01:00:50.082
vaccine is administered too high or too low in the muscle.

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:59.203
So these so-called... Too high or too low in the muscle, you can get this one thing called... Holy balls, that's hilarious.

01:00:59.303 --> 01:01:00.883
Wow, that's really hilarious.

01:01:00.943 --> 01:01:14.966
Table injury is not only say which vaccine could in rare cases cause which injury, it also gives you a time frame that is generally scientifically agreed upon for when these injuries could take place, which is again an important counter to

01:01:15.956 --> 01:01:30.243
what Secretary Kennedy and other people like him have claimed, which is pinning any number of childhood and adult syndromes to vaccines, even if there is no evidence that that is the case, and even if the vaccines were administered years ago.

01:01:30.996 --> 01:01:31.376
R.F.K.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:31.776
Jr.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.238
seems to be incredibly critical of this court.

01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:52.688
He recently tweeted out that the ICP has devolved into a morass of inefficiency, favoritism, and outright corruption as government lawyers and the special masters who serve as vaccine court judges prioritize the solvency of the HHS trust fund over their duty to compensate victims.

01:01:53.028 --> 01:01:54.149
Well, why is R.F.K.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.430
so critical of this court, this process?

01:01:56.974 --> 01:02:05.061
Secretary Kennedy has been critical of it for years going back to his time as the head of the anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense.

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:06.482
So it's funny, right?

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:10.825
Because Children's Health Defense is just a big top 10 for health freedom and they're not anti-vaccine.

01:02:10.845 --> 01:02:12.166
They just want safe vaccines.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:14.208
They want placebo tested vaccines.

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:23.516
And so again, we have this really terrible malevolent trap we're in where so many people have been convinced to answer exactly like I just did.

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:26.477
and defend Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:26.537 --> 01:02:40.040
and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker's 25 years of failure or a decade of failure as part of the 5D strategy that they're doing and the big top tent of health freedom that they've established.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:52.684
But what they've actually done is set the conservative movement up for complete disaster, complete discrediting, and maybe even set up the Christian right in America for complete discreditation.

01:02:53.752 --> 01:03:01.516
by all their fellow Americans and maybe all their fellow secular citizens of the Western world.

01:03:02.716 --> 01:03:19.645
And so without a doubt, it is vital that conservative, principled, critically thinking, Christian, I don't know, religious, faithful, you know, people that just accept that there's things that we don't understand, those people, they need to pull their heads out.

01:03:20.225 --> 01:03:21.706
They need to burn that red hat.

01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:26.045
They need to admit that, wow, I'm pretty, I was pretty fooled.

01:03:26.545 --> 01:03:36.041
Like, I should not have believed this, but make the argument that the only reason why I believed it is because you fricking people were offering us Harris.

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:40.471
because you people believed in Obama.

01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:43.272
You people believed in Biden.

01:03:43.312 --> 01:03:50.454
So yeah, I understand that I made a mistake by thinking that I could throw a wrench in the system by voting for Donald Trump in 2016.

01:03:50.874 --> 01:03:56.796
I made a mistake in thinking that, you know, maybe Donald Trump was a good guy and he was gonna be good.

01:03:56.836 --> 01:03:59.417
But at some point you can admit that, well, I didn't think that

01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:02.779
that Israel would still be bombing Gaza.

01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:04.441
I didn't think that we would bomb Iran.

01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:07.043
I didn't think that Donald Trump would do nothing.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.864
I didn't think that Donald Trump would do nothing.

01:04:08.904 --> 01:04:18.632
I didn't think that Donald Trump would do that and just pull your head out because Bobby hasn't done anything but fund a universal vaccine for flu and COVID.

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:25.238
Bobby hasn't done anything but do podcasts.

01:04:26.698 --> 01:04:29.380
Jay Bhattacharya hasn't done anything but do podcasts.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.702
Jay Bhattacharya is the most unqualified person to head the NIH ever.

01:04:36.384 --> 01:04:43.529
I don't even know what that guy would give a lecture about, but most of the shit on his resume has to do with diseases and modeling.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:52.094
And all of his academic work from undergraduate to PhD to MD to whatever has all been at Stanford.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:05:08.307
You can't find another academic on earth that's done their undergraduate, their master's degree, their PhD, and their MD at the same university because there isn't any other university in the United States that would tolerate that bullshit.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.549
But Stanford isn't a real university.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:14.891
Stanford is full of puppets.

01:05:19.346 --> 01:05:20.866
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:20.886 --> 01:05:27.948
I'm not optimistic, but I'm not pessimistic, because I do actually think it's a message for anyone that wants to see it.

01:05:28.768 --> 01:05:36.049
But you just got to accept the premise that we are being ruled by a red-blue theater, and both the red and the blue are absurd.

01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:38.869
And the absurdities are different.

01:05:38.909 --> 01:05:46.971
The absurdities are gears which mesh perfectly, and inside of these gears are being ground up our family and our communities.

01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:51.441
as we choose from two very ridiculous sides.

01:05:52.562 --> 01:06:02.193
It's not a lesser of two evils, it's just equivalent dumb, equivalent stupid, equivalent mythologies on both sides, and they're both absurd.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.855
It's not evil, it's absurdity.

01:06:04.997 --> 01:06:07.099
call it evil, then everybody can't think about it.

01:06:07.159 --> 01:06:08.219
It's just absurd.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.662
And if you see that this theater is absurd, you can let it go.

01:06:12.742 --> 01:06:13.663
You can dismiss it.

01:06:14.223 --> 01:06:15.885
It doesn't have any superpowers.

01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:17.426
It's not about to take over the world.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:23.830
It's just absurdly dumb that America has Donald Trump as a president, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:31.035
as HHS secretary, and some guy by the name of Jayantabadacharya, who smells like curry, at the head of frickin' NIH.

01:06:32.352 --> 01:06:33.853
He is a fraud.

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:35.793
Marty McCary's a fraud.

01:06:35.853 --> 01:06:37.354
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:37.534 --> 01:06:41.215
is a scripted fraud with a bunch of frauds behind him.

01:06:45.256 --> 01:06:54.800
And if we don't teach this to our children as part of the real American history in about 15 years, we won't have an America to come back to or to point to.

01:06:59.088 --> 01:07:04.052
Well, I don't know what Mr. Kennedy's personal ire about the program is linked to.

01:07:04.212 --> 01:07:12.058
A lot of personal injury attorneys in the anti-vaccine movement are critical of the program because they would like these cases to be heard in civil court.

01:07:12.498 --> 01:07:14.320
And indeed, Mr. Kennedy has been counsel

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:21.335
in some of the few vaccine cases that are heard in civil court, a series of class action lawsuits over the Gardasil vaccine.

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:32.084
So I would say that in listening to the comments that Mr. Kennedy has made recently about this program, it is pretty striking some of the basic facts that he misstates.

01:07:32.184 --> 01:07:35.687
He claims that the system is designed not to compensate people.

01:07:35.767 --> 01:07:38.269
He claims that it's a lot more adversarial than it actually is.

01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:39.770
He doesn't mention that 60% of people are

01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:43.752
compensated without ever going before a special master.

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:58.298
It is, again, these are statistics that are easy to find if you work for the federal government or look at a government... They're not easy to find if you listen to Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Brian Hooker and listen to the scripts that they read.

01:08:00.819 --> 01:08:05.581
These statistics are not very easy to find if you fell for Sherry Tenpenny or

01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:12.573
or Suzanne Humphreys or James Lyons Wyler.

01:08:14.694 --> 01:08:16.154
It's really bad, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:17.855
It's much worse than you thought.

01:08:18.175 --> 01:08:24.298
Because intramuscular injection being a dumb idea from the 1800s doesn't preclude the possibility that the measles vaccine worked.

01:08:27.699 --> 01:08:28.420
That's where we are.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:30.941
Run website.

01:08:30.961 --> 01:08:36.263
So it's very surprising to me how many things he says about the program that most people would disagree with.

01:08:37.057 --> 01:08:52.085
One of the lines of reasoning that Secretary Kennedy has used in the past is that courts like the one that deal with vaccines are set up in a way to protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies.

01:08:52.446 --> 01:08:53.506
What's wrong with that thinking?

01:08:53.766 --> 01:09:04.052
If they had to go to civil court, wouldn't there be a possibility that they would have to pay lots more to people who are suffering from vaccines?

01:09:04.403 --> 01:09:05.904
So there's a couple of things wrong here.

01:09:06.224 --> 01:09:14.187
One is that as anybody who's paid the slightest attention to the American civil court system knows, it's adversarial, it's expensive, it takes a long time.

01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:30.313
So we would be asking patients who may also already be dealing with serious injuries to go through a very long, very expensive court system where for instance, their legal fees are not paid for, which in many cases they are paid for in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:32.934
They also stand a chance of losing.

01:09:33.427 --> 01:09:38.329
You know, this is something that is not often mentioned when Secretary Kennedy talks about this.

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:41.271
This is a process that does not have a guaranteed outcome.

01:09:41.871 --> 01:09:49.255
This was set up, the national vaccine... See, now she's not talking about it, honestly, because you cannot sue in a civil court.

01:09:49.295 --> 01:09:55.178
You can't sue in regular court because of the PrEP Act and because of the National Vaccine Safety Act.

01:09:56.357 --> 01:09:57.838
You're just not allowed to anymore.

01:09:57.898 --> 01:10:06.124
And so the PrEP Act essentially creates a violation of fundamental rights to sue for damages over $20.

01:10:07.084 --> 01:10:13.268
So you can say it's like really expensive and it'll be a long trial and you could lose, but that's not what would happen.

01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:21.214
What would happen is the court would say, we can't listen to your trial because of the PrEP Act and kick it to the administrative court.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:36.212
And so they're talking like that's an option, but it's only an option if your goal is to torpedo the whole act by having the court say, we can't allow you to sue for damages because of this law.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:45.420
And then you argue again to the circuit court that that law should be struck because it allows the suspension of my fundamental rights without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

01:10:47.165 --> 01:10:53.453
And so again, this is not a genuine portrayal of the conundrum that we have created for ourselves.

01:10:53.893 --> 01:11:00.381
It is not a genuine portrayal of what the vaccine injury court is.

01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:04.085
Not on that side and not on the CHD side.

01:11:04.546 --> 01:11:07.129
And that is the malevolence of this trap.

01:11:08.575 --> 01:11:11.657
But boy, this is sure a convincing interview that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:11.697 --> 01:11:14.299
and CHD haven't been telling us the full story.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.381
Compensation program was set up for patients.

01:11:16.421 --> 01:11:19.504
It was set up to make sure that they have a better chance.

01:11:19.744 --> 01:11:22.106
Civil court is a lot more unpredictable.

01:11:22.126 --> 01:11:26.329
It involves people going up against juries who may or may not side with them.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:32.013
And so overall, you go up against a jury in a trial like that.

01:11:32.053 --> 01:11:33.114
That's interesting, isn't it?

01:11:34.615 --> 01:11:37.197
Need increased compensation in this program.

01:11:37.238 --> 01:11:37.738
These people are

01:11:38.357 --> 01:11:41.780
not getting paid enough, the caps are too low because they were established a long time ago.

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:45.604
There need to be more special masters hearing these cases so they go through more quickly.

01:11:45.624 --> 01:11:54.753
If Secretary Kennedy and the people he appointed talked to lawyers for vaccine injured plaintiffs, they would have a lot of suggestions for how to overhaul the program.

01:11:55.273 --> 01:12:00.238
It wouldn't involve weakening or dismantling it in the ways that he seems to be suggesting.

01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:08.176
Let's take a look at a different kind of line of his attack on immunizations or vaccines.

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:26.107
He has, as the secretary, the power to help appoint people in positions who decide what sort of vaccines we should be pursuing, which ones should be taken off the shelves, which should be suggested for use, et cetera.

01:12:27.147 --> 01:12:29.669
Who has he filled those leadership positions with?

01:12:30.256 --> 01:12:50.226
Yeah, one really noteworthy thing that happened recently that you probably saw the headlines about is that Secretary Kennedy removed all 17 members of ACIP, which is an advisory body that helps CDC decide what should appear on the vaccine schedule and the sort of guidance we give to the American public about vaccines.

01:12:50.286 --> 01:12:57.169
So Secretary Kennedy removed all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them with people who in several cases have

01:12:57.924 --> 01:13:07.472
very distinct and long-term ties to the anti-vaccine movement and to other forms of medical skepticism and sort of contested medical advice.

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.073
So he's done that.

01:13:09.513 --> 01:13:10.394
That is ongoing.

01:13:10.574 --> 01:13:14.617
He has suspended the U.S.'

01:13:14.577 --> 01:13:22.484
's funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps vaccinate children in some of the poorest places in the world and developing countries against

01:13:23.064 --> 01:13:25.766
diseases like polio, Ebola, meningitis.

01:13:25.946 --> 01:13:29.149
He's installed a series of people throughout HHS.

01:13:29.569 --> 01:13:32.151
There's been a number of actions and they're happening very fast.

01:13:32.731 --> 01:13:37.115
What's the response been from the existing medical community?

01:13:37.275 --> 01:13:40.897
And does that break down along, I don't know, partisan lines?

01:13:40.977 --> 01:13:46.882
Is it just Democrat doctors or Republican doctors that are either in support of this or in opposition to this?

01:13:48.055 --> 01:13:52.096
No, this is broadly unpopular with the medical community.

01:13:52.216 --> 01:14:15.360
Another thing that HHS has done under Mr. Kennedy is kicked out long established medical associations from the- One thing that I should probably make clear that I think the health freedom movement has purposefully distorted is the idea that there are a lot of doctors waking up because I don't think there are.

01:14:17.296 --> 01:14:20.378
I think there is an incredible paucity of doctors waking up.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:29.645
And the main reason why is because the doctors that are amplified on social media are not very knowledgeable doctors.

01:14:30.425 --> 01:14:36.410
Sherry Tenpenny is never gonna convince any of our family doctors to reconsider.

01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:43.515
And neither is Suzanne Humphries on Joe Rogan, neither is James Lyons Weiler.

01:14:44.778 --> 01:14:49.580
And so that, I think, is a unique position that GigaOM Biological could potentially occupy.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:15:06.785
I think that I could explain it to a lot of people in a way that they have never heard it before, and explain it in a way that leaves open a great deal of uncertainty as to what's good and what's bad, but a general understanding of why certain things are probably not good.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:14.948
biological basis for understanding why intramuscular injection was probably a dumb idea from the very, very start.

01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:20.739
But now that we know so much about the immune system, it's a very, very dumb idea.

01:15:25.532 --> 01:15:27.654
CDC working groups that talk about vaccines.

01:15:27.734 --> 01:15:34.419
Again, this is like the American Medical Association and another half dozen really big medical bodies.

01:15:34.439 --> 01:15:38.763
The concern has been very widespread and it has been nonpartisan.

01:15:38.803 --> 01:15:44.387
This is a this is a serious concern for public health experts, scientists, doctors who study vaccination.

01:15:45.048 --> 01:15:49.271
And, you know, the biggest concern overall is that it's going to be confusing to the American public.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:53.375
You're suddenly going to have somebody in a position of extraordinary power

01:15:54.051 --> 01:16:09.291
making contested and extremely questionable claims about the safety of the vaccination system that, you know, we've worked so hard as sort of the US public health system has worked so hard to build trust in these programs.

01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:18.805
You know, it's also interesting that we're already seeing a decrease in vaccinations, and that's accelerated post-COVID, right?

01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:20.246
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

01:16:21.046 --> 01:16:26.927
COVID was a really profitable and fruitful time for anti-vaccine groups.

01:16:26.967 --> 01:16:29.848
They were able to use people's fear and confusion about what was going on.

01:16:30.388 --> 01:16:35.690
to drive first skepticism about COVID vaccines and mRNA technology, and then vaccines more broadly.

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:41.613
As you're saying, we've seen a decrease in the number of children getting vaccinated for school.

01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:46.835
And, you know, that has happened previously in other areas of history.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:54.098
It's always a concern, but it's a special concern right now because we're still dealing with a devastating measles outbreak across the country that, again,

01:16:54.858 --> 01:16:57.659
HHS has not been speaking about as much as you might expect.

01:16:57.759 --> 01:16:59.200
Measles is incredibly dangerous.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.601
It's especially dangerous for children and infants.

01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:09.865
And if those kids are not vaccinated against measles, it could be and has been for at least two children in Texas so far deadly.

01:17:09.885 --> 01:17:18.649
It's funny, they tell stories about how when you get measles, it erases your immune memory and to all other, I mean, I've heard a lot of stories about measles.

01:17:19.665 --> 01:17:23.206
Apparently, vaccination to measles doesn't ruin your immunity to everything else.

01:17:23.566 --> 01:17:26.367
What's been the Secretary's incredibly dangerous?

01:17:27.767 --> 01:17:33.188
Secretary Kennedy suggested that at least one of the children who died of measles was malnourished, which is not true.

01:17:33.488 --> 01:17:35.569
We do not have any evidence that that is the case.

01:17:36.729 --> 01:17:45.611
And Secretary Kennedy's former organization, Children's Health Defense, has actually interviewed the parents of the children who died in Texas and is sort of attempting to

01:17:46.701 --> 01:17:48.862
bring them around to the anti-vaccination cause.

01:17:49.602 --> 01:18:06.506
So I think it's fair to say that a lot of public health experts, myself and my colleague Kira Butler talked to, really expressed a desire for HHS to do more to reemphasize that people should get their children vaccinated against measles and to not muddy the waters and confuse people about what is safe and what isn't.

01:18:06.912 --> 01:18:12.035
I wonder if anybody will be able to sue HHS for damages from measles.

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:14.296
I wonder if anything's gonna flip like that.

01:18:14.697 --> 01:18:30.165
Underlying this notion that there could be different environmental factors is sort of a challenge, if not outright denial of germ theory and science that we've established for 150 or 200 years at least now, right?

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.227
And I wonder what is,

01:18:32.907 --> 01:18:33.848
in place of that?

01:18:34.068 --> 01:18:36.271
What is the secretary?

01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:38.093
150 or 200 years of germ theory.

01:18:38.373 --> 01:18:39.214
Stop lying!

01:18:41.177 --> 01:18:41.377
Wow.

01:18:41.397 --> 01:18:52.530
The secretary and the people that he works with who are part of this movement, what do they believe in if they don't think that measles spreads the way that it actually does?

01:18:53.584 --> 01:18:57.306
Yeah, my colleague Kira Butler has written about this in some detail.

01:18:58.007 --> 01:19:09.613
Secretary Kennedy in one of his books suggested a belief in what is called miasma theory, which is basically as he describes it, and the way that he describes it is not quite accurate to the historical belief.

01:19:09.974 --> 01:19:12.855
But essentially, the idea with miasma theory is that

01:19:14.156 --> 01:19:34.075
people get sick from things like dirty air and environmental factors but they can be protected from illness by better nutrition and by building up their own immune systems and while that was probably a useful idea before we knew what germs were um you know several centuries ago now that we know several centuries ago

01:19:39.096 --> 01:19:44.681
Gosh, it's just sad really, you know, like insisting, you know, we've known this since the dawn of time.

01:19:44.701 --> 01:19:47.083
You know that germs and viruses get people sick.

01:19:47.103 --> 01:19:51.567
You have to take that into account when you're thinking about how to protect people from illness.

01:19:51.927 --> 01:19:53.388
So it's funny that she says that.

01:19:53.528 --> 01:19:54.970
It's for centuries, right?

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.872
I'm just going to show you something that I got in the mail the other day.

01:19:58.653 --> 01:19:59.413
Just random.

01:20:01.175 --> 01:20:04.158
I'll just show you what I got in the mail the other day.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.640
Cause I get stuff in the mail.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:11.521
This is a West Virginia official bulletin on the control of communicable diseases.

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:18.483
It's official West Virginia bulletin here on communicable West control of diseases.

01:20:19.043 --> 01:20:22.544
And this one is from January of 1936.

01:20:23.104 --> 01:20:27.845
So we're not going back centuries, you know, not a couple hundred years.

01:20:27.885 --> 01:20:30.245
We're only going back about a hundred years.

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:34.366
And the communicable diseases, we're missing an L there.

01:20:35.406 --> 01:20:43.068
Um, include things that are, uh, you know, um, let's see methods of control go through here.

01:20:43.168 --> 01:20:43.728
Cholera.

01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:48.909
Uh, etiological agent of chicken pox.

01:20:49.109 --> 01:20:49.729
Undetermined.

01:20:49.889 --> 01:20:54.771
I thought we knew that we had microbes and viruses for centuries.

01:20:55.131 --> 01:20:56.751
Oh, dengue fever.

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:58.631
Etiological agent.

01:20:58.911 --> 01:20:59.792
Undetermined.

01:21:01.352 --> 01:21:02.132
So weird.

01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:05.674
I thought we had this down for centuries already.

01:21:06.134 --> 01:21:06.414
Huh.

01:21:06.974 --> 01:21:07.374
Weird.

01:21:07.454 --> 01:21:08.095
Diphtheria.

01:21:08.115 --> 01:21:09.095
That's a bacteria.

01:21:09.475 --> 01:21:09.975
Interesting.

01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:10.595
Dysentery.

01:21:10.696 --> 01:21:11.576
Oh, it's a bacteria.

01:21:11.716 --> 01:21:12.216
Interesting.

01:21:12.736 --> 01:21:12.976
Huh.

01:21:13.457 --> 01:21:14.077
Dysentery.

01:21:14.137 --> 01:21:14.857
A bacteria.

01:21:14.997 --> 01:21:15.517
Interesting.

01:21:15.677 --> 01:21:16.158
Huh.

01:21:16.918 --> 01:21:17.958
Oh, encephalitis.

01:21:18.178 --> 01:21:19.019
Undetermined.

01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:22.552
I don't know what to say.

01:21:23.132 --> 01:21:24.193
Let me think here.

01:21:24.573 --> 01:21:31.017
For centuries, we've known, presumably, cocci, streptococci, but we're not sure.

01:21:31.717 --> 01:21:33.318
Boy, I'm telling you, this is weird.

01:21:33.698 --> 01:21:36.120
I don't think we've known for very long.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:42.824
Epidemic influenza, undetermined, claimed at present time to be a filterable virus.

01:21:45.939 --> 01:22:07.672
So I'm confused how it is that this, you know, highly intrepid, very intelligent Mother Jones reporter doesn't seem to know that our understandings of communicable diseases are not as high fidelity as she thought, and certainly not high fidelity for centuries.

01:22:10.214 --> 01:22:12.916
Not really high fidelity for centuries.

01:22:14.622 --> 01:22:16.883
You silly scripted shitheads!

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:21.544
And they are scripted shitheads.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:22.464
They don't read.

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:29.526
If she was an investigative reporter, she might have already gotten to the point where she understood that intramuscular injection was just dumb.

01:22:30.506 --> 01:22:32.587
But she's not an investigative reporter.

01:22:32.627 --> 01:22:34.107
She's a scripted reporter.

01:22:35.347 --> 01:22:39.068
Write a story about how shitty Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:22:39.048 --> 01:22:40.409
's take on vaccines is.

01:22:40.449 --> 01:22:41.449
Well, that's pretty easy.

01:22:44.364 --> 01:22:45.225
Unbelievable.

01:22:45.725 --> 01:22:52.130
So we've asked several times if Secretary Kennedy still believes in and promotes miasma theory.

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:57.053
And I would I would love to know more about whether or not he still holds that to be true.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.344
From your piece, there's a comment from the department and from one of their spokespersons.

01:23:02.364 --> 01:23:10.089
The Secretary Kennedy is committed to restoring scientific integrity, transparency, and public trust in federal health policy, especially with concerns vaccines.

01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:18.655
Any suggestion that his goal is to make vaccines harder to access or discourage manufacturers is completely false.

01:23:19.396 --> 01:23:21.818
How are the actions that he is taking now

01:23:23.382 --> 01:23:28.978
how would they decrease the interest of manufacturers to make these medicines?

01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:40.367
Right, so we can look at exactly what happened in the 1980s with the DTP vaccine, which is that as these civil cases and these... Hey, Liar Bird, Kate, welcome to the show.

01:23:40.427 --> 01:23:41.668
I'm glad you make alive.

01:23:41.728 --> 01:23:43.369
That's, it's nice to see you.

01:23:43.409 --> 01:23:45.230
I'm glad you chatted that in.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.831
Nice work.

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:47.832
Jury awards started to rack up.

01:23:48.192 --> 01:23:51.374
Drug manufacturers started to pull out of making vaccines.

01:23:51.414 --> 01:23:52.475
You know, this isn't something

01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:54.056
that they have to do.

01:23:54.156 --> 01:24:01.321
And frankly, they often choose not to because vaccines, contrary to what a lot of folks in the anti-vaccine movement will tell you, don't make them a ton of money.

01:24:01.502 --> 01:24:05.405
That is not a super profitable product for drug manufacturers or doctors.

01:24:05.485 --> 01:24:09.628
So they could simply choose not to make them, not to market them due to concerns.

01:24:10.148 --> 01:24:13.971
And again, this is something that's really extraordinary, right?

01:24:14.031 --> 01:24:20.336
On one side, we're told that they're the most profitable things that vaccine manufacturers can make, you know, Sanovi and Merck.

01:24:20.836 --> 01:24:22.838
And then on the other hand, we're told that we don't really make much

01:24:23.538 --> 01:24:26.561
I mean, you know, we can just stop making them right now.

01:24:26.581 --> 01:24:27.402
I mean, it was stupid.

01:24:27.442 --> 01:24:30.405
If you don't want them, we won't make them over getting sued.

01:24:30.425 --> 01:24:42.695
And that is very much the place where the public health experts that Kira and I spoke to are worried that we will find ourselves if this type of anti-vaccine rhetoric from the federal government continues.

01:24:44.262 --> 01:24:54.149
It remains to be seen, and I would say, as I have been saying when I've talked to folks about this, if you need to get up to date on any of your vaccines at all, talk to your doctor.

01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:57.651
Get that done as soon as you can.

01:24:57.671 --> 01:25:05.476
Just so we don't leave this conversation with any doubt, where is the science on vaccines today?

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.112
Vaccines are incredibly safe.

01:25:08.252 --> 01:25:09.574
They're incredibly effective.

01:25:09.754 --> 01:25:15.239
We started vaccinating people as a society around the same time that we learned that it's good to wash your hands.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.002
This is a very old, very established science.

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:29.414
But if you have any concerns and say if you're somebody who doesn't trust the American medical establishment, right, you're somebody who just is really concerned about what you see as corruption in American medicine, you can look at studies from places like Denmark.

01:25:30.237 --> 01:25:41.324
Denmark just released another landmark study tracking children over the last 24 years to specifically look at whether there's concern over aluminum adjuvants in vaccines.

01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:46.188
Aluminum adjuvants have been- And again, you know, it's both sides playing that silly game.

01:25:46.248 --> 01:25:47.168
Is it mercury?

01:25:47.248 --> 01:25:48.409
Is it adjuvants?

01:25:48.469 --> 01:25:49.110
Is it this?

01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:49.790
Is it that?

01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:50.470
It's stupid.

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:51.311
We debunked it.

01:25:51.351 --> 01:25:51.731
It's done.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:55.574
And it's all nonsense if they're trying to debunk it.

01:25:55.794 --> 01:25:58.356
Autism, if they're trying to debunk a particular

01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:08.141
adjuvant, if they're trying to debunk a particular component, then they're never going to get to the point where they realize that intramuscular injection is simply dumb.

01:26:09.178 --> 01:26:23.464
and that trying to explain a succinct list of things that could happen when you inject a combination of substances intermuscularly is antithetical to our understanding of our biology because it's not that predictable.

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:30.767
She just got through saying that one of the things on her list is really dependent on whether you input it too high or too low in the muscle.

01:26:31.207 --> 01:26:31.988
Stop lying!

01:26:32.308 --> 01:26:35.911
Come on, this is not an informed person.

01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:38.032
That's not an informed person.

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:40.374
This is not a patriotic American.

01:26:40.434 --> 01:26:42.115
That might not even be an American.

01:26:43.856 --> 01:26:45.938
This is just gigantic bullshit.

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:50.724
This is the Joe Rogan on the other side.

01:26:50.964 --> 01:26:55.166
This is as bad as it is on the other side, but make no mistake about it.

01:26:55.867 --> 01:27:07.572
If the script calls for us to get burnt, if it calls for Joe Rogan to be discredited and Trump to be discredited and the conservative Christians in America to be discredited, then that's what the script is going to do.

01:27:08.072 --> 01:27:13.315
And if you don't want that to happen, you don't want to watch that movie, then get off social media now.

01:27:15.299 --> 01:27:21.602
used in vaccines for a long time to increase their efficacy, and Secretary Kennedy and others have claimed that maybe that is unsafe.

01:27:21.682 --> 01:27:29.345
So again, Denmark looked at this data for the past 24 years and determined that no, aluminum adjuvants are safe.

01:27:29.905 --> 01:27:37.368
There is so much science, not just in the US, but across the world, showing that vaccines are safe, that they're effective, and they are a

01:27:38.268 --> 01:27:38.889
Good idea.

01:27:38.969 --> 01:27:51.118
Some of the best research that's ever been done on vaccines was done by a Denmark researcher by the name of Christine Stibel-Ben and she looked at the DTP vaccine and all-cause mortality in the kids who got it.

01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:56.943
And the all-cause mortality in the kids who didn't get the DTP vaccine was five times better.

01:27:57.683 --> 01:28:00.025
than the ones who did get the DTP vaccine.

01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:02.187
And that study is pretty strong.

01:28:02.247 --> 01:28:03.027
It's pretty tough.

01:28:03.087 --> 01:28:03.808
It's pretty good.

01:28:04.268 --> 01:28:05.309
It's pretty well done.

01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:10.013
But you know, she points out the Democrat, the Denmark study about aluminum.

01:28:14.221 --> 01:28:18.242
It's very, very hyperconformist, lickspittle stuff.

01:28:18.282 --> 01:28:18.883
For most people.

01:28:18.943 --> 01:28:24.465
And of course, if you have any doubts about this for yourself or your children, you should talk to your doctor.

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:33.168
But the concern now is- And the doctor will take your 13 year old into the room and tell the 13 year old that your parents are probably stupid because they don't read.

01:28:33.728 --> 01:28:34.808
And we know all about it.

01:28:34.848 --> 01:28:36.989
Should we tell you about all the vaccines you need?

01:28:37.029 --> 01:28:40.630
And by the way, you know, are you sure you're a boy and a boy?

01:28:40.650 --> 01:28:42.291
Are you sure?

01:28:44.676 --> 01:28:51.561
You should probably go talk to your doctor because they know exactly what they were told to know.

01:28:53.362 --> 01:29:02.728
America's in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen, and we need to start to build a network of doctors who do know, and it ain't the network of doctors that's in the health freedom movement.

01:29:02.768 --> 01:29:04.370
Those people are actors.

01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:07.852
There is going to be a disconnect between

01:29:08.539 --> 01:29:18.512
what the American health system is saying, what people like the HHS secretary are saying, and what you might hear from the medical professional in your life, which is confusing for people.

01:29:18.532 --> 01:29:22.476
Yeah, which might make some very difficult conversations that doctors have to have.

01:29:22.917 --> 01:29:25.040
Hannah Merlin, senior reporter for Mother Jones.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:25.901
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:27.772
It's spectacular.

01:29:27.952 --> 01:29:29.792
It's absolutely spectacular.

01:29:29.832 --> 01:29:35.775
In the meantime, the red team in America thinks that, you know, thank God for Donald Trump.

01:29:36.155 --> 01:29:46.319
They think that the DOD deployed a kill box and that the spike shot was a bioweapon designed by the NIH and that pandemics don't occur naturally because this is a lab leak.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:30:01.243
America is in absolutely huge trouble, and it's because its own citizens don't understand how separated they are, how set up they are to fight and kill one another.

01:30:03.004 --> 01:30:06.265
There are no ethics involved in that picture you just saw.

01:30:06.305 --> 01:30:10.706
There's no ethics involved in the story that they told us that something started in 2020.

01:30:12.561 --> 01:30:19.029
There's no ethics involved in leaving out this, you know, little niggle of a story here where there's this bump.

01:30:22.874 --> 01:30:29.242
An anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, ladies and gentlemen, was misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen.

01:30:30.902 --> 01:30:33.243
They used non-specific PCR to do it.

01:30:33.383 --> 01:30:38.824
They used performing actors to do it, like this guy who headed the Lancet Commission.

01:30:39.664 --> 01:30:44.445
Were anybody that you know, someone you love, fooled by this jackass?

01:30:44.485 --> 01:30:49.207
Because if it's possible to save anybody, those are the people we can save.

01:30:49.307 --> 01:30:54.848
Because it is absurd to think that the most frequent speaker at the Vatican

01:30:57.737 --> 01:31:02.242
and the head of the Lancet Commission, who said that the Lancet Commission people were lying to me.

01:31:02.282 --> 01:31:04.064
All these virology people were lying.

01:31:04.124 --> 01:31:05.325
It's obviously a lab leak.

01:31:05.365 --> 01:31:06.627
This dude is a stooge.

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.451
This dude is a huge stooge.

01:31:12.392 --> 01:31:17.495
Ladies and gentlemen, the premise is that we are being run by a national security theater.

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:18.615
There are no elections.

01:31:18.735 --> 01:31:22.437
They don't leave anything to chance anymore because that's not how this works.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:26.759
People who rise into clear view like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:26.819 --> 01:31:28.980
are need-to-know basis scripted actors.

01:31:29.481 --> 01:31:31.302
And that's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:31.382 --> 01:31:36.544
seems to have let everybody down because the script lets you down, not the actor.

01:31:36.604 --> 01:31:37.965
The actor is doing just fine.

01:31:39.104 --> 01:31:42.145
And these need to know basis actors include Donald Trump.

01:31:42.385 --> 01:31:46.626
Donald Trump might not even know and didn't know that that shooting was going to be faked.

01:31:46.986 --> 01:31:51.447
And he didn't know how it was going to be faked until he went down on the ground and somebody put blood on his ear.

01:31:52.408 --> 01:31:55.388
That's how ridiculous this is right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:55.909 --> 01:31:57.189
Jeff Bezos is fake.

01:31:57.729 --> 01:31:59.210
You know, Elon Musk is fake.

01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:00.650
Peter Thiel's a moron.

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:16.870
None of these people... None of these people can be found on screen saying anything profound, but lots of these people can be found on screen saying stupid-ass shit!

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:24.917
If you've got the lab, if you've got the scientists necessary, effectively you could come up with a zombie-type virus.

01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:25.157
Whoa.

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:38.933
And it could be your next-door neighbor who starts it all.

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:42.437
You need a table and a sink, and that's a laboratory.

01:32:42.837 --> 01:32:46.861
Once the biopocalypse strikes, we may not know what hit us.

01:32:47.082 --> 01:32:48.603
What the hell is that?

01:32:48.984 --> 01:32:50.445
Until it's too late.

01:32:50.525 --> 01:32:53.028
You're gonna have a huge death toll before you ever catch up with it.

01:32:59.224 --> 01:33:01.485
Do you see why they're telling the story in 2013?

01:33:03.527 --> 01:33:09.010
Do you see why they're telling the story in 2013 with Joe Rogan on the Sci-Fi Channel?

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:14.334
Because this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is coming.

01:33:17.036 --> 01:33:21.278
And so they have Ralph Baric in academic circles pushing it.

01:33:22.079 --> 01:33:25.321
They have Peter Daszak on 60 Minutes pushing it.

01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:28.503
They have Nathan Wolf at TED Talks pushing it.

01:33:35.396 --> 01:33:37.417
That's what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:38.478 --> 01:33:39.459
This is an admission.

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.701
These are actors and we were set up.

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:58.992
Joe Rogan questions everything.

01:34:00.513 --> 01:34:01.074
What a name.

01:34:02.941 --> 01:34:06.482
Is the world going to be wiped out by biopocalypse?

01:34:06.682 --> 01:34:14.524
28 Days Later, World War Z. We've all seen those movies where the world is coming to an end because of a terrifying superbug.

01:34:14.824 --> 01:34:16.424
What if that wasn't just a movie?

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.865
What if those scenarios were a reality?

01:34:19.605 --> 01:34:23.546
Smallpox, the avian flu, drug-resistant bacteria.

01:34:23.826 --> 01:34:26.347
All these nasty superbugs are real.

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:32.348
These things are... What I see here, in case you're not clear about it, is that this is pre-podcast.

01:34:33.621 --> 01:34:33.841
Right?

01:34:33.961 --> 01:34:38.383
This is where they didn't understand yet exactly how they were going to get this around.

01:34:38.443 --> 01:34:44.546
So this is a highly produced, lots of sound effects, wow, bang, boom, kind of thing.

01:34:44.986 --> 01:34:49.948
You know, four panels, like, like 24, the TV show.

01:34:50.749 --> 01:34:59.273
They're still experimenting with how to get people to accept an illusion of consensus about an idea.

01:34:59.333 --> 01:35:02.354
Like, you know, pandemics are coming and we're all going to die.

01:35:03.703 --> 01:35:10.367
And in this case, what they're trying here is highly produced, very elaborate production.

01:35:10.568 --> 01:35:32.322
But later on, people like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Alex Karp are going to come to the realization that actually scripting a conversation with loaded questions and loaded arguments and loaded conclusions is even more effective than some bullshit like this.

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:36.444
And so I think this is almost like prehistory.

01:35:36.504 --> 01:35:47.552
This is like going back when they were still trying to figure out how it is that we can make a national security theater for the most effective to catch the most people.

01:35:48.332 --> 01:35:49.513
And that's podcasting.

01:35:50.776 --> 01:35:55.278
They're alive, they outnumber us, and they are little mini-killing machines.

01:35:55.498 --> 01:36:03.982
They are the four trillion little horsemen of the bio-pocalypse, and they could turn humanity into a wretched shell of its former self.

01:36:04.402 --> 01:36:11.965
These are all real scenarios that actual scientists working on infectious diseases are worried about.

01:36:12.265 --> 01:36:19.990
One of the most terrifying scenarios is that they might get help spreading across the planet by the most dangerous organism of them all.

01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:21.210
Mankind.

01:36:21.831 --> 01:36:29.075
Before I get into what sort of dangers we may be facing, I need to find out how long people have been toying with these microscopic creatures.

01:36:29.155 --> 01:36:31.517
How much trouble we could already be in.

01:36:31.537 --> 01:36:33.398
That was like clay in that dish.

01:36:33.418 --> 01:36:34.278
That was awesome.

01:36:35.439 --> 01:37:00.678
we're about to meet dr sergey popov he's a former soviet union bioweapons expert and he tells us that if this was a bioweapon the contents of this bottle would be enough to kill everyone in this stadium now think about how crazy that is that he's being so imprecise if this was a bioweapon what could be a bioweapon it could be a pure quantity of dna

01:37:02.625 --> 01:37:06.087
It could be a pure quantity of RNA or a nearly pure quantity of RNA.

01:37:06.127 --> 01:37:07.748
It could be a bacterial culture.

01:37:07.768 --> 01:37:10.509
It could be a pure bacterial toxin.

01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:16.072
It could be an enzyme in pure quantity.

01:37:16.112 --> 01:37:16.852
You see how, how,

01:37:20.228 --> 01:37:38.281
imprecise he is being is by design because they want you to feel a gray area between you know in this book some things who had a bacteria and they had a name and a shape and they could see it and then others said presumed to be a filterable virus

01:37:41.263 --> 01:37:56.635
And so what Joe Rogan is doing here is trying to muddy the water as much as possible between real communicable diseases, real biological signals, and real potential dangers with the imaginary ones like RNA viruses.

01:37:56.655 --> 01:37:59.718
20,000 people.

01:37:59.758 --> 01:38:02.340
Wrap your head around that, son.

01:38:03.321 --> 01:38:05.102
Wrap your head around that, son.

01:38:05.122 --> 01:38:06.383
How are you, sir?

01:38:06.943 --> 01:38:07.164
Good.

01:38:07.244 --> 01:38:07.664
How are you?

01:38:07.804 --> 01:38:08.425
Thank you for meeting me.

01:38:09.645 --> 01:38:15.307
So a bottle full of deadly viruses could really wipe out an entire stadium full of people?

01:38:15.647 --> 01:38:17.047
Yes, absolutely.

01:38:17.487 --> 01:38:21.128
Now, how many different biological weapons were created in the Soviet Union?

01:38:21.728 --> 01:38:29.571
I don't really know, but the Ministry of Defense definitely had huge stockpiles of biological weapons.

01:38:29.751 --> 01:38:30.231
Like how big?

01:38:30.251 --> 01:38:31.691
In the amount of tons.

01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:34.072
Maybe tens of tons.

01:38:34.232 --> 01:38:35.152
Tens of tons?

01:38:35.412 --> 01:38:35.632
Yes.

01:38:35.752 --> 01:38:37.953
So that's enough to wipe out, like, whole cities.

01:38:39.082 --> 01:38:39.803
Absolutely.

01:38:40.263 --> 01:38:43.585
The whole population of the whole population of earth.

01:38:43.885 --> 01:38:45.166
Wow.

01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:49.208
But they only need, but they only need to fix this problem right here.

01:38:49.248 --> 01:38:51.710
They only need to fix this little problem right here.

01:38:51.730 --> 01:38:54.751
This little increase in all cause mortality.

01:38:54.791 --> 01:38:56.372
That's going to come in about 10 years.

01:38:56.432 --> 01:38:57.773
We don't need to kill everybody.

01:38:57.833 --> 01:38:58.734
Like, Holy shit.

01:38:58.754 --> 01:38:59.274
That's weird.

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:01.522
I wonder if it's anthrax.

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:09.465
The United States helped inactivate a lot of biological weapons in the former republics of the Soviet Union.

01:39:09.545 --> 01:39:10.065
Did they?

01:39:10.105 --> 01:39:11.586
I wonder if that was DITRA.

01:39:11.986 --> 01:39:13.827
Holy shit, what's he talking about?

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:18.949
United States probably, when they went over there, they were probably like, what are you guys doing over here with all this?

01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:23.612
There were trenches, huge trenches filled with anthrax.

01:39:23.632 --> 01:39:26.513
A little tiny amount of anthrax would kill a person, right?

01:39:26.813 --> 01:39:27.433
Absolutely.

01:39:27.553 --> 01:39:28.534
This is very scary stuff.

01:39:29.349 --> 01:39:52.271
yes yes it is that's why nobody knew about it and the soviet union made all effort to cover it up that's crazy ah yes there are very few things less comforting than the words cover up and trenches of anthrax used in the same sentence cover up i know all about cover-ups boy this is like the scooby-doo mystery started

01:39:52.851 --> 01:40:05.229
are those facilities under heavy security ha that guy worked for ditra that's funny you could walk into those facilities and find biological agents available to almost anything

01:40:07.539 --> 01:40:12.282
That's right.

01:40:12.382 --> 01:40:13.443
America, yeah.

01:40:14.104 --> 01:40:25.852
There's been a bunch of movies that depict horrific nightmare scenarios where some sort of man-made agent gets released and wreaks havoc and destroys the population.

01:40:26.133 --> 01:40:28.094
Do you think there's a possibility of that ever happening?

01:40:30.439 --> 01:40:31.260
Absolutely!

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.701
What's the most frightening biological weapon that you know that was ever developed?

01:40:47.148 --> 01:40:51.211
One of the most potent was the so-called hemorrhagic virus.

01:40:51.651 --> 01:40:59.135
Hemorrhagic means that they will bleed extensively from your nose, from your eyes, from your stomach.

01:40:59.656 --> 01:41:02.758
Oh, ten times more potent than the smallpox.

01:41:03.118 --> 01:41:05.779
Ten times more potent than smallpox.

01:41:05.819 --> 01:41:08.501
What does that even mean if they don't do the same thing?

01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:09.682
What does that even mean?

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:11.400
Deadly?

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:11.780
What?

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.241
What is the potency there?

01:41:13.261 --> 01:41:14.261
It's so stupid.

01:41:14.301 --> 01:41:15.842
The language is so stupid.

01:41:15.942 --> 01:41:21.223
What do people do to protect themselves if something like this happens, if there is some sort of an outbreak?

01:41:21.723 --> 01:41:21.923
Wow.

01:41:21.943 --> 01:41:22.003
Yes.

01:41:22.023 --> 01:41:25.925
Well, um, you just scared the s*** out of me.

01:41:26.145 --> 01:41:27.285
Congratulations.

01:41:27.905 --> 01:41:28.325
Thank you.

01:41:28.365 --> 01:41:28.906
Wow.

01:41:28.966 --> 01:41:32.507
That was some seriously scary s***.

01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:43.792
And what's even more scary is what is happening today.

01:41:44.592 --> 01:41:46.513
I'm going to talk to Charles Faddis.

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:54.378
See how it's not as convincing as if you just have like Michael Osterholm on your podcast for like two hours and talk.

01:41:54.578 --> 01:41:56.419
Like it's not nearly as convincing.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.640
That's the trick.

01:41:59.021 --> 01:42:03.644
He was the head of the CIA's WMD terrorism unit.

01:42:03.924 --> 01:42:07.166
And he knows what kind of horrifying things are going on.

01:42:11.354 --> 01:42:12.655
Alright, Charles.

01:42:12.715 --> 01:42:13.155
What's happening?

01:42:13.755 --> 01:42:15.816
How scary is bioterrorism?

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:18.457
How many people look like Robert Malone in this movie?

01:42:18.498 --> 01:42:19.358
Is this the first one?

01:42:19.378 --> 01:42:21.419
I mean, how much should we really worry about it?

01:42:21.599 --> 01:42:28.322
The average person thinks there's like some finite amount of this stuff out there and it's all under control and that's not even close to true.

01:42:28.702 --> 01:42:33.785
If more people were really aware of the dangers that are out there, there'd be a lot of folks that were lying awake at night.

01:42:34.365 --> 01:42:40.632
What diseases specifically are you worried about, and are you worried about engineered diseases that we're not yet aware of?

01:42:40.932 --> 01:42:42.994
We're worried about a whole host of diseases.

01:42:43.295 --> 01:42:45.857
One of the big ones that people talk about, smallpox.

01:42:46.318 --> 01:42:49.301
We don't hear a lot about it, but there are still stockpiles of it in the world.

01:42:49.801 --> 01:42:50.442
Right now, the U.S.

01:42:50.462 --> 01:42:54.746
government is so worried about smallpox that they're stockpiling 2 million doses of vaccine.

01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:01.084
There's another disease called tularemia that the Soviets worked with an awful lot.

01:43:01.524 --> 01:43:04.447
Their idea was, knock a country out of commission.

01:43:04.487 --> 01:43:08.590
In other words, they were gonna infect us with it and tens of millions of people would be hospitalized.

01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:09.331
That's terrifying.

01:43:09.871 --> 01:43:16.937
So when I was running the weapons of mass destruction unit for CIA, right, our job is to track biological, chemical, nuclear, radiological.

01:43:17.017 --> 01:43:23.462
I wonder if he ran into Charles Rixey, because he sounds like he's describing his job a lot like Charles Rixey's job.

01:43:23.522 --> 01:43:24.383
Material worldwide.

01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:31.209
Every expert I know, every person that's focused on the issue will tell you that the number one threat is biological warfare.

01:43:31.449 --> 01:43:38.175
You know, we could have a terrorist group sending operatives here that have been deliberately infected with some kind of disease, some kind of pathogen, and it could happen tomorrow.

01:43:38.235 --> 01:43:40.337
Like a biomartyr type situation.

01:43:40.498 --> 01:43:40.838
Exactly.

01:43:41.058 --> 01:43:41.719
You're talking about...

01:43:42.099 --> 01:44:00.871
bio-martyr type situation wow that's awesome that are willing to use suicide tactics so there is nothing that stops them from then utilizing that fanaticism to deliberately infect somebody and use them as the mechanism for spreading a disease i think the scariest thing about a bio-martyr is that you would never see it coming

01:44:01.811 --> 01:44:06.693
They said biomartyr again, wow, that's an amazing word!

01:44:06.713 --> 01:44:07.453
He said it again!

01:44:07.473 --> 01:44:08.313
Like, wow, that's awesome!

01:44:21.377 --> 01:44:22.078
Yeah, absolutely.

01:44:22.478 --> 01:44:22.858
Absolutely.

01:44:22.898 --> 01:44:23.499
No question.

01:44:24.099 --> 01:44:25.560
There's a whole new bio business.

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:30.163
And now we get these sort of do-it-yourself labs all over the country with sort of bio entrepreneurs.

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:37.629
And folks are playing with engineering new organisms, but in the process, potentially creating completely new diseases.

01:44:38.169 --> 01:44:39.010
So there's a lot of concern.

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:41.391
Did you see that gain of function in that test tube?

01:44:41.411 --> 01:44:42.152
That was pretty awesome.

01:44:42.372 --> 01:44:44.614
Learn about the idea of somebody mucking around with this.

01:44:45.464 --> 01:44:53.290
And now you have a pathogen released that is brand new, and nobody has any resistance to it anywhere on the planet.

01:44:53.891 --> 01:44:57.713
Would it be even possible to stop something in its tracks?

01:44:57.894 --> 01:45:04.379
If it's a disease that we haven't seen before or we didn't stockpile anything in advance, you're going to have a huge death toll before you ever catch up with it.

01:45:04.659 --> 01:45:12.385
You're going to find out when the first case gets diagnosed, which probably means at least 48 hours after the attack started, now you realize there was an attack.

01:45:12.825 --> 01:45:15.950
And by now, everybody that was infected has infected somebody else.

01:45:16.391 --> 01:45:17.913
So we're already playing catch-up.

01:45:18.053 --> 01:45:23.001
Now you're going to try to engineer something while this is already raging, you know, kind of like a wildfire?

01:45:23.021 --> 01:45:23.983
That's not going to happen.

01:45:24.103 --> 01:45:26.447
You're going to lose a lot of people before you catch up with this thing.

01:45:27.639 --> 01:45:31.682
There's one thing that Charles Faddis mentioned that really kind of freaked me out.

01:45:32.423 --> 01:45:45.752
He was talking about individuals that are running their own laboratories that may be doing experimentation on bacteria and viruses and might not even realize what kind of danger they're putting the rest of us in.

01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:49.235
Who are these people and what the hell are they thinking?

01:45:49.455 --> 01:45:50.916
And why are they driving a Hemi?

01:45:52.862 --> 01:45:54.904
I need to find out what Tony Kimmery knows.

01:45:55.344 --> 01:45:58.547
He's a journalist who's been investigating rogue experiment.

01:45:58.627 --> 01:46:01.029
It's the second Robert Malone lookalike.

01:46:01.249 --> 01:46:02.650
Oh my gosh.

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.791
Across the country.

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:04.452
Hi Tony.

01:46:04.492 --> 01:46:04.852
How are you?

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:09.476
And he says that it could be taking place right next door to you.

01:46:09.976 --> 01:46:12.258
This is something that you've been studying for a long time.

01:46:12.559 --> 01:46:14.220
You're on the cutting edge of this.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.422
What is your biggest concern?

01:46:16.442 --> 01:46:19.344
The fact that you could come up with a zombie type virus.

01:46:19.384 --> 01:46:19.464
Whoa.

01:46:21.752 --> 01:46:27.436
Coming up, you are a- They are definitely auditioning, like, what is going on here?

01:46:28.236 --> 01:46:29.257
Biohacker.

01:46:29.477 --> 01:46:30.218
What are you doing here?

01:46:30.538 --> 01:46:34.481
People come in, they pay a fee, you can play with genes, you can play with organisms.

01:46:34.681 --> 01:46:35.821
Is there anything dangerous here?

01:46:35.841 --> 01:46:37.543
I'm not gonna tell you, it's perfectly safe.

01:46:37.743 --> 01:46:45.448
And later, you're gonna go to a shelter in Kansas, where people are preparing for some sort of bio-apocalypse.

01:46:46.048 --> 01:46:47.469
Hello!

01:46:47.649 --> 01:46:48.370
I don't feel safe.

01:46:50.465 --> 01:46:53.972
at the moment of truth, be that a viral pandemic or nuclear.

01:46:55.294 --> 01:46:56.235
I got a place to go.

01:46:56.496 --> 01:46:59.080
Seven billion people on the planet do not.

01:46:59.501 --> 01:47:00.283
I'm dying!

01:47:07.325 --> 01:47:11.869
Is the world going to be wiped out by viruses and plunged into a bio-apocalypse?

01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:16.792
I'm talking to Tony Kimmery, and he says that we should be very worried.

01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:19.274
This is something that you've been studying for a long time.

01:47:19.574 --> 01:47:21.015
You're on the cutting edge of this.

01:47:21.516 --> 01:47:23.417
What is your biggest concern?

01:47:24.498 --> 01:47:30.162
He's the editor of Homeland Security Today, which is just an awesome title.

01:47:31.903 --> 01:47:35.286
This new threat now is the do-it-yourself biology labs.

01:47:37.179 --> 01:47:39.140
What exactly are these do-it-yourself labs?

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:46.281
It's a global community of citizen scientists, amateur biologists, do-it-yourself bioengineers.

01:47:46.782 --> 01:47:49.542
And for very little money, you can create your own lab.

01:47:49.742 --> 01:47:51.823
What is the kind of damage that one of these labs can do?

01:47:52.163 --> 01:47:56.304
They're dealing with potentially seriously pathogenic materials.

01:47:56.724 --> 01:47:57.905
They're not regulated.

01:47:58.265 --> 01:47:59.845
Who knows who's coming and going?

01:48:00.565 --> 01:48:06.447
And these same resources that are available to the biopunk community are also available to terrorist organizations in rogue states.

01:48:07.187 --> 01:48:08.048
It's a real threat.

01:48:08.228 --> 01:48:14.473
Counterterrorism folks will tell you that they believe that the bio threat is the biggest one facing us right now.

01:48:14.854 --> 01:48:21.419
What intelligence do we have as far as how much progress they've made in terms of engineering some sort of a new virus?

01:48:21.619 --> 01:48:27.624
If you've got the lab, if you've got the scientists necessary, effectively you could come up with a zombie type virus.

01:48:29.735 --> 01:48:33.518
You know, something like a rabies virus that's manipulated with something else.

01:48:34.339 --> 01:48:36.400
So like a 28 days later type scenario.

01:48:36.901 --> 01:48:42.745
If it's well resourced enough and they're the right people with the right knowledge, then you've got a real problem.

01:48:43.006 --> 01:48:47.109
So these type of labs have the capability of producing a pandemic virus.

01:48:47.369 --> 01:48:51.251
There's a lot of classified information out there, but the CIA, they've been following this.

01:48:51.451 --> 01:48:56.713
They have determined that there are some that have been able... Notice the CIA has been following it.

01:48:56.793 --> 01:49:06.057
Notice that the other expert was running bioweapons for the CIA, or working on, you know, all the chemical, biological, and radiological weapons for the CIA.

01:49:06.177 --> 01:49:06.918
CIA!

01:49:06.938 --> 01:49:09.699
...able to develop some dangerous pathogens from scratch.

01:49:10.279 --> 01:49:15.683
with a hybrid or designer or the next influenza pandemic virus and then spreading it around.

01:49:15.903 --> 01:49:20.927
That's got the greatest potential for killing a lot of people outside of a small tactical nuclear weapon.

01:49:21.108 --> 01:49:27.352
So someone is going to come along, create some sort of a virus that we really haven't had any exposure to yet.

01:49:27.773 --> 01:49:28.694
In fact, do you hear it?

01:49:29.014 --> 01:49:30.235
They're actually doom, doom.

01:49:31.543 --> 01:49:36.526
Every time they change the framing of these things, they're actually playing the music of 24.

01:49:36.726 --> 01:49:39.187
It's like they're not there yet.

01:49:39.227 --> 01:49:40.528
Look at it.

01:49:40.688 --> 01:49:45.611
They have determined that there are some that have been able to develop some dangerous pathogens from scratch.

01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:46.111
Can you hear it?

01:49:46.431 --> 01:49:57.157
With a hybrid or designer or the next influenza pandemic virus and then spreading it around, that's got the greatest potential for killing a lot of people outside of a small tactical nuclear weapon.

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:58.878
So someone is going to come along

01:49:59.198 --> 01:50:08.606
create some sort of a virus that we really haven't had any exposure to yet, infect someone, they enter into a large population area, and then it spreads.

01:50:11.048 --> 01:50:11.188
Whoa.

01:50:15.089 --> 01:50:15.289
OK.

01:50:15.489 --> 01:50:17.150
You ready?

01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:24.993
I met with a guy named Anthony Kimmery, and he is essentially an expert on infectious diseases.

01:50:25.213 --> 01:50:28.754
And one of the things that he's concerned with is biopunks.

01:50:29.335 --> 01:50:32.536
They're people who experiment with biological agents.

01:50:32.856 --> 01:50:37.278
They set up laboratories, and they start experimenting with different things.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:41.319
So that's Joe Rogan on like his 50th podcast here.

01:50:41.359 --> 01:50:44.079
So you can see it's kind of a transition period right now.

01:50:44.119 --> 01:50:55.642
And I think they just realized at some point that they get a lot better results and a lot better response from the viewers from a podcast than they do from that extremely highly produced video set.

01:50:56.562 --> 01:50:57.302
And it's cheaper.

01:50:57.602 --> 01:50:59.342
So this is perfect discovery.

01:51:01.403 --> 01:51:01.723
Gosh.

01:51:03.618 --> 01:51:08.746
Right now in some basement, there's some guy with a mohawk fiddling around with the bubonic plague.

01:51:09.467 --> 01:51:14.774
By the way, a lot of the punks I know, they don't need to order some bacteria or virus.

01:51:15.075 --> 01:51:18.981
They just need to take their pants off in a bathroom, and that spreads disease.

01:51:22.483 --> 01:51:24.544
Well, listen, man, I'm going to talk to Rob Carlson.

01:51:24.624 --> 01:51:27.786
He's a PhD from Princeton and a bio-entrepreneur.

01:51:27.826 --> 01:51:37.753
And he apparently is going to reassure me that this is not something to be concerned with and that what they're doing is they're trying to create beneficial things.

01:51:38.133 --> 01:51:39.254
They're not trying to ruin the world.

01:51:39.414 --> 01:51:39.634
Right.

01:51:40.294 --> 01:51:48.980
And what you're going to do is you're going to go to a shelter in Kansas where people are preparing for some sort of bio-apocalypse.

01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.201
And they have set up this...

01:51:52.495 --> 01:51:53.175
Refuge.

01:51:53.495 --> 01:51:54.456
Is this an above ground?

01:51:54.556 --> 01:51:55.416
So it's funny, right?

01:51:55.476 --> 01:51:58.457
Because what you see here is the exploration of the podcast.

01:51:58.497 --> 01:52:09.682
They have interspersed this conversation in and then they're just going to find out through production and repetition that this is the part of the program that convinces the most people.

01:52:11.102 --> 01:52:17.405
And so they'll just get rid of the other shit, all the music and graphics and nonsense and just leave it right here.

01:52:18.845 --> 01:52:18.945
It's 2013.

01:52:21.604 --> 01:52:25.826
And I'm showing you what was coming on this repeating graph above my head.

01:52:27.086 --> 01:52:35.010
And because they knew it was coming since the early 1990s, they also knew that they had 10 years to put people in place to tell the story.

01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:37.451
And Joe Rogan was recruited.

01:52:38.544 --> 01:52:54.263
He doesn't need to know why, he doesn't need to know the plan, and in fact need to know scripted actors that are a part of the governance structure of America and the world probably don't care once they're told that that's what their role is, that's what their job is, that they work for.

01:52:54.966 --> 01:52:56.888
the governance structure of the world.

01:52:57.448 --> 01:52:59.731
And that sounds like a pretty exciting job to me.

01:52:59.791 --> 01:53:00.691
Where's my script?

01:53:01.512 --> 01:53:02.233
Oh, no, no, no.

01:53:02.253 --> 01:53:03.674
You're going to go deep into the center of the earth.

01:53:03.914 --> 01:53:04.175
Really?

01:53:04.395 --> 01:53:04.635
Yeah.

01:53:05.196 --> 01:53:08.919
You're going to talk to a PhD from Princeton and you're sending me to an underground cave?

01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:10.961
Listen, dude, you're going to go to Kansas.

01:53:10.981 --> 01:53:12.362
You're going to have a good time.

01:53:12.943 --> 01:53:14.925
And that is the last thing he ever heard.

01:53:17.898 --> 01:53:19.418
I don't know what Duncan is so worried about.

01:53:19.678 --> 01:53:22.599
I'm sending him to a safe haven, a shelter.

01:53:23.199 --> 01:53:28.000
I'm the one who has to go to a shady laboratory filled with viruses and bacteria.

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.861
But the only way to find out what's really going on is if I gold book myself.

01:53:34.102 --> 01:53:37.202
We're about to go into a real live biopunk lab.

01:53:37.242 --> 01:53:39.223
And inside this lab is Rob Carlson.

01:53:39.503 --> 01:53:41.203
He has a PhD from Princeton.

01:53:41.423 --> 01:53:43.804
He's one of the founders of the biopunk movement.

01:53:52.964 --> 01:53:53.865
Hi, how are you?

01:53:54.125 --> 01:53:54.346
Good.

01:53:54.646 --> 01:53:55.547
Thank you for meeting us.

01:53:55.607 --> 01:53:56.168
Really appreciate it.

01:53:56.188 --> 01:53:56.488
Sure thing.

01:53:56.849 --> 01:53:58.611
You are a biohacker.

01:53:59.051 --> 01:53:59.792
Sometimes, yeah.

01:54:00.253 --> 01:54:05.559
Most people, like if you tell them I'm involved in the biohacking movement, do they just stare blankly at you?

01:54:05.639 --> 01:54:10.025
Why didn't you fix the fricking hair problem you got first with your biohacking?

01:54:11.505 --> 01:54:13.327
Some do, some raise their eyebrows.

01:54:13.427 --> 01:54:15.229
In Washington, D.C., some get concerned.

01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:17.031
What is the concern?

01:54:17.051 --> 01:54:21.997
If you have biology in a garage, then some people think it's going to go to miss you.

01:54:22.097 --> 01:54:23.819
So this guy has a Ph.D.

01:54:23.859 --> 01:54:28.744
in physics, but he's actually kind of masquerading as a biologist.

01:54:29.705 --> 01:54:37.656
And his big claim to fame is that I think more recently he's moved on to trying to store data in DNA, which is really gay.

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.341
And why is it gay?

01:54:41.401 --> 01:54:45.988
Well, it's because of the fact that it rests on the assumption that that's what DNA is.

01:54:47.466 --> 01:54:52.132
I'm not saying that DNA doesn't code for RNA that codes for proteins.

01:54:52.192 --> 01:54:55.296
I think we've kind of figured out that something like that occurs.

01:54:55.977 --> 01:55:02.465
But the fact of the matter is that we are still working under the assumption that everything that we are

01:55:03.486 --> 01:55:10.830
as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time is encoded in the DNA, we just haven't figured it out yet.

01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:19.594
And that's why it would make theoretical sense to try and store data in DNA, because we assume that's what it's used for anyway.

01:55:20.075 --> 01:55:32.241
So maybe if some shithead from, you know, Princeton fools around with storing our kind of data in DNA, maybe we'll stumble upon the mechanism where the biological data is stored in DNA.

01:55:35.987 --> 01:55:42.289
This is the kind of dumbassery that we are under the spell of for the last couple decades.

01:55:42.369 --> 01:55:44.830
And this guy is part of it.

01:55:45.251 --> 01:55:46.611
Joe Rogan is part of it.

01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:48.692
Because again, there are no morals.

01:55:48.772 --> 01:55:59.456
The only goal is to make sure that the vast majority of the citizenry are completely bamboozled and believe in the idea that we are about to figure out the code of life, which we are not.

01:55:59.996 --> 01:56:01.277
Rock solid security.

01:56:02.117 --> 01:56:02.838
Oh, no, it doesn't.

01:56:03.238 --> 01:56:04.840
There's wide open doors.

01:56:05.461 --> 01:56:06.241
What are you doing here?

01:56:07.022 --> 01:56:07.823
What am I doing here?

01:56:07.843 --> 01:56:09.205
I mean, what is anybody doing here?

01:56:09.245 --> 01:56:10.546
What's the purpose of this?

01:56:10.666 --> 01:56:11.267
People come in.

01:56:11.307 --> 01:56:12.708
They pay a fee.

01:56:12.768 --> 01:56:13.749
They do their project.

01:56:13.869 --> 01:56:15.391
You can play with genes.

01:56:15.411 --> 01:56:16.532
You can play with organisms.

01:56:16.993 --> 01:56:18.454
And they might be working on anything.

01:56:20.495 --> 01:56:23.177
Just anybody, all they have to do is pay a fee?

01:56:23.877 --> 01:56:26.219
Do you like do any sort of background check on these folks?

01:56:26.399 --> 01:56:29.742
Well, I don't know what sort of background check you think that might be appropriate there.

01:56:30.202 --> 01:56:30.642
I don't know.

01:56:30.802 --> 01:56:35.426
But I mean, do you do a background check when you get a driver's license?

01:56:35.626 --> 01:56:36.266
No, you do not.

01:56:37.207 --> 01:56:42.571
So what he's saying is because you don't need a background check to get a driver's license, you shouldn't need one to run a biolab.

01:56:43.717 --> 01:56:47.900
The last time I checked, you can't start a pandemic apocalyptic zombie virus.

01:56:48.120 --> 01:57:00.309
Don't forget that Robert Malone went in front of a meeting of the UK Parliament and told people that we were in danger of a pandemic from garage-level scientists.

01:57:00.369 --> 01:57:11.978
He actually said in a room in the UK Parliament that a person with a biology degree and some equipment from eBay could cause the next pandemic.

01:57:12.018 --> 01:57:13.179
And here's Joe Rogan

01:57:15.584 --> 01:57:43.500
actually about 10 years earlier saying the same stupid shit like the shithead Robert Malone said during the pandemic multiple times on hundreds of podcasts in front of multiple government groups or government organizations or para-government organizations or parliamentary organizations or health freedom groups holy shit ladies and gentlemen if you can't see it now there may be no hope for you

01:57:44.912 --> 01:57:45.773
by commuting.

01:57:46.153 --> 01:57:48.175
In this case, right, there's some safety training.

01:57:48.896 --> 01:57:52.379
And people who are responsible for the place are keeping track of what goes on here.

01:57:52.459 --> 01:57:53.620
And they are talking to people.

01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:54.941
And they're looking over people's shoulders.

01:57:55.361 --> 01:57:57.523
But the security part doesn't bother me so much in this case.

01:57:58.724 --> 01:57:59.285
Wow.

01:57:59.725 --> 01:58:00.806
And I'm not the only one doing it.

01:58:00.986 --> 01:58:04.589
There are a lot of people out there who are trying the same sort of thing.

01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:11.896
So what's interesting to me about that is that I can make it, as every other kind of company in our economy, in my garage doing biology.

01:58:13.106 --> 01:58:15.628
Is there anything dangerous here that we need to be concerned about?

01:58:15.648 --> 01:58:17.489
In this lab, probably not.

01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:20.131
Probably is a strange word to use there.

01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:22.373
Well, there's always a potential for something to happen.

01:58:22.513 --> 01:58:24.534
You know, cooking in your kitchen, you've got sharp knives around.

01:58:24.574 --> 01:58:25.495
There's always a potential.

01:58:25.535 --> 01:58:27.316
So I'm not going to tell you that it's perfectly safe.

01:58:27.716 --> 01:58:30.198
OK, so we don't have to worry about the organisms.

01:58:30.378 --> 01:58:35.122
It's just being around a laboratory that could be potentially slightly dangerous.

01:58:36.022 --> 01:58:37.823
You don't want to lick things, you know?

01:58:37.843 --> 01:58:38.404
No licking.

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:40.665
You don't want to eat the stuff that's sitting on the bench.

01:58:41.046 --> 01:58:48.351
Now, there are folks that have some concerns about the whole idea of biohacking, manipulating enzymes.

01:58:49.752 --> 01:58:50.072
Sorry.

01:58:50.872 --> 01:58:51.453
Bacterias.

01:58:51.773 --> 01:58:52.954
Are these concerns unfounded?

01:58:54.997 --> 01:58:55.457
Coming up.

01:58:55.777 --> 01:58:59.299
You could potentially do something dangerous here, but you could do that anywhere.

01:58:59.579 --> 01:59:01.200
There are lots of labs like this.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.162
So the notion that we could actually prevent people from doing harm is not.

01:59:05.322 --> 01:59:06.222
I am a biologist.

01:59:06.242 --> 01:59:07.023
I have a Ph.D.

01:59:07.083 --> 01:59:07.663
in biology.

01:59:07.723 --> 01:59:09.083
It's actually in neurobiology.

01:59:09.144 --> 01:59:17.808
I worked with Edward and Mabrit Moser in Norway and Edward Moser and Mabrit Moser won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2014.

01:59:18.028 --> 01:59:18.308
About

01:59:21.289 --> 01:59:22.791
six months after I left the lab.

01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:31.438
And my claim to fame is that my last name was on a couple slides of Edward Moser's presentation after he won the Nobel Prize.

01:59:31.458 --> 01:59:33.200
And that's about as famous as I'll ever be.

01:59:34.001 --> 01:59:35.222
Oh, no, wait, that's right.

01:59:35.322 --> 01:59:39.185
I'm also a biologist whose name is in this fraudulent book as an expert.

01:59:40.366 --> 01:59:41.848
And they nearly made a fool of me.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:49.604
With this book, but fortunately I pulled my head out in time To now be regularly declaring Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:59:49.644 --> 02:00:05.232
And the people behind him as scripted frauds part of a national security operation That has been in decades in the making and decades in the making including setting up people like Joe Rogan to be the sort of you know cheerleaders of the bullshit

02:00:06.192 --> 02:00:29.324
and later it will be ugly out there the world's going to be devastated it's going to be terrible this is a Noah's ark and you'd be willing to shoot people to keep them out and you'd be willing to shoot people to keep them out there are thousands of people out there working in homemade labs who are toying thousands of people

02:00:30.506 --> 02:00:46.738
thousands of them are working on homemade labs like that's that's a pretty bold statement with potentially dangerous biological materials i'm talking to biopunk pioneer rob carlson to find out how worried we should be about what they're doing in these labs

02:00:50.785 --> 02:01:00.367
There are folks that have some concerns about the whole idea of biohacking, about manipulating these biologies.

02:01:06.369 --> 02:01:07.649
Hold on one second.

02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:11.530
Sorry, I wanted to fix one thing here and then we'll get back to it.

02:01:16.252 --> 02:01:16.632
Tonight.

02:01:20.327 --> 02:01:43.385
endgame wow ever want to live recreational vehicle directly in i'm not gonna i'm not gonna watch this part this is silly he headed for a biopocalypse i just hope that duncan's found a nice safe spot for us to ride out the viral winter if a biopocalypse does occur oh a viral winter neat while seven other billion people on the planet do not

02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:45.290
Who has the final say?

02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:47.811
The shelter director.

02:01:48.211 --> 02:01:48.491
You?

02:01:49.091 --> 02:01:50.312
Maybe, maybe I'm not.

02:01:50.352 --> 02:01:51.052
At this point, I am.

02:01:51.432 --> 02:01:52.913
And you'd be willing to shoot people?

02:01:52.973 --> 02:01:54.614
What an interesting thing to point out.

02:01:54.714 --> 02:01:58.616
Arthur says that this video is one year before the color revolution in Ukraine.

02:01:58.636 --> 02:02:05.359
You know, the country where all the bio labs were, including where the bio labs of metal biota of Nathan Wolf were.

02:02:08.841 --> 02:02:11.242
Nice, nice tip in the chat there.

02:02:12.223 --> 02:02:12.823
To keep them out.

02:02:15.196 --> 02:02:18.839
This place is operated tight because it has to be.

02:02:18.919 --> 02:02:21.321
If it isn't, you're going to have chaos.

02:02:22.102 --> 02:02:22.802
This is amazing.

02:02:23.503 --> 02:02:25.224
Can you take me on a tour of Vivos?

02:02:25.664 --> 02:02:25.985
You ready?

02:02:26.145 --> 02:02:26.225
Yeah.

02:02:26.245 --> 02:02:26.425
Let's go.

02:02:26.545 --> 02:02:26.965
Let's see it.

02:02:27.686 --> 02:02:28.527
Where's the wine bar?

02:02:29.247 --> 02:02:30.128
Let's go exploring.

02:02:30.328 --> 02:02:30.929
Let's do it.

02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:33.471
So we're cruising along.

02:02:34.548 --> 02:02:38.069
inside an underground cave mountain.

02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:41.531
It's the same square footage as the Empire State Building.

02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:42.551
Wow.

02:02:43.411 --> 02:02:46.573
How many people will eventually live in this place?

02:02:46.633 --> 02:02:47.613
Well, we're planning 5,000.

02:02:49.033 --> 02:02:52.235
Could be a little more, but frankly, we could even build it.

02:02:52.255 --> 02:02:54.756
He looks like you're going to need a few more shitters in there, though.

02:02:54.816 --> 02:02:55.456
Holy cow.

02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.301
You know, the thought is this.

02:02:58.802 --> 02:02:59.622
These people.

02:02:59.842 --> 02:03:02.264
I would love to ride around in that, in my wheel, though.

02:03:02.284 --> 02:03:03.025
That would be sweet.

02:03:03.065 --> 02:03:05.067
That looks like a nice little place to play.

02:03:05.087 --> 02:03:07.229
The next genesis to restart this planet.

02:03:07.689 --> 02:03:11.512
Effectively, this facility is a Noah's Ark.

02:03:11.892 --> 02:03:12.213
Wow.

02:03:15.595 --> 02:03:16.196
Check, check.

02:03:16.696 --> 02:03:17.577
Check, check, check.

02:03:17.597 --> 02:03:18.418
All right, ready?

02:03:19.879 --> 02:03:21.901
So what did you think about the underground shelter?

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.164
See how his podcast was actually kind of started with the sci-fi channel?

02:03:27.224 --> 02:03:28.445
It was like a transition.

02:03:28.485 --> 02:03:29.046
Do you see it?

02:03:31.932 --> 02:03:53.822
it was definitely the creepiest place i've ever been in my life we ended up driving into a hole in the side of a mountain in this massive i'm gonna fast forward a little bit every few years first of all thank you very much thing i'm gonna talk to dr brad spellberg from the harbor ucla medical center he's an infectious disease specialist and he's gonna tell us where the real danger is

02:03:54.912 --> 02:03:56.053
First of all, thank you very much for doing this.

02:03:56.133 --> 02:03:56.433
You bet.

02:03:56.693 --> 02:04:02.216
Now, knowing what you know and being an expert at this, what scares you the most?

02:04:03.116 --> 02:04:12.761
The most terrifying thing that I am seeing is bacteria that we can't treat with antibiotics anymore, that have set medicine back 80 years, and patients are dying of those infections already.

02:04:13.202 --> 02:04:19.545
These totally resistant bacteria that are in hospitals and nursing homes are now spreading in communities and killing people, and we can't stop them.

02:04:19.765 --> 02:04:29.289
Now we're talking about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is a very different phenomenon than gain-of-function viruses, which have never been mentioned in this show yet.

02:04:29.349 --> 02:04:32.450
Just make sure you realize that that term has not been used yet.

02:04:33.271 --> 02:04:34.311
Did you see World War Z?

02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:35.572
I have not seen it yet.

02:04:35.852 --> 02:04:41.614
The concept behind the movie is that there's a disease, and this disease turns people into zombies.

02:04:42.535 --> 02:04:46.256
Some rabies-like form of a disease that turns people into mad dogs.

02:04:47.297 --> 02:04:47.857
Is that possible?

02:04:48.829 --> 02:04:55.195
One of the scariest things about being an infectious diseases is in every few years, something pops out and you go, Oh my God, how did we not know about that?

02:04:55.275 --> 02:04:58.298
So, you know, HIV popped out in 19 in the early 1980s.

02:04:58.838 --> 02:04:59.999
Where was that before?

02:05:00.079 --> 02:05:00.280
Right?

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:02.542
SARS monkey pox.

02:05:03.082 --> 02:05:07.887
Now we have this middle East corrupt SARS monkey pox and wow.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:11.150
I didn't even know monkey pox was a thing, but apparently it was.

02:05:12.346 --> 02:05:25.662
Coronavirus now that's killing 50% of people it infects and it just popped up in the last year or two That's one entirely feasible doomsday scenario that a lot of people are really worried about happening right now See we think we rule the planet.

02:05:25.943 --> 02:05:26.824
No microbes.

02:05:27.004 --> 02:05:27.705
They rule the planet

02:05:27.965 --> 02:05:30.047
They formed the atmosphere of the planet.

02:05:30.107 --> 02:05:32.429
They've been around for three and a half billion years.

02:05:32.489 --> 02:05:33.430
They formed the atmosphere?

02:05:33.450 --> 02:05:33.550
Yeah.

02:05:34.090 --> 02:05:35.612
They live at the bottom of the ocean.

02:05:35.932 --> 02:05:39.715
They've been found alive a mile down the Earth's surface in solid rock.

02:05:40.055 --> 02:05:43.498
No matter what we throw at them, we will never win the war against microbes.

02:05:43.638 --> 02:05:45.059
It's not winnable.

02:05:45.259 --> 02:05:47.341
We're not in a war against microbes.

02:05:47.441 --> 02:05:50.404
We are the result of a microbial world.

02:05:50.504 --> 02:05:52.666
We are based on a microbial world.

02:05:52.706 --> 02:05:56.609
We carry around a compost heap of bacteria in our guts.

02:05:59.209 --> 02:06:01.030
We're not in a war with them.

02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:03.472
We are in a symbiosis with them.

02:06:04.192 --> 02:06:09.836
And it is that symbiosis that's at the heart of the definition of who we are as beings.

02:06:11.317 --> 02:06:25.947
And in fact, what all higher life on earth is, is a symbiotic relationship between a whole host of bacteria and their phages and a multicellular assembly that facilitates that symbiosis.

02:06:25.987 --> 02:06:27.728
This is a very complex,

02:06:29.465 --> 02:06:41.674
pattern integrity that these people are trying to portray as something that is in direct opposition to it instead of a complex harmony.

02:06:41.834 --> 02:06:42.895
It's disgusting.

02:06:44.312 --> 02:06:45.333
to keep a pace.

02:06:45.813 --> 02:06:46.594
We're on a treadmill.

02:06:46.814 --> 02:06:47.655
There's no end game.

02:06:48.135 --> 02:06:48.355
Wow.

02:06:48.755 --> 02:06:50.477
That's a fascinating way to look at it.

02:06:50.817 --> 02:06:57.702
So we have to keep our endurance, and we have to constantly throw attention and money at this in order to just keep the population alive.

02:06:57.923 --> 02:06:58.483
Absolutely.

02:06:58.503 --> 02:07:01.826
And in fact, microbes are the most adaptable things on the planet.

02:07:02.426 --> 02:07:07.909
The future of humanity and microbes will likely evolve as episodes of our wits versus their genes.

02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:10.331
They're still using their genes to adapt.

02:07:10.391 --> 02:07:13.193
And the scary thing is we've kind of stopped using our wits to keep up.

02:07:13.253 --> 02:07:16.615
And that's why we're having this antibiotic superbug problem right now.

02:07:16.635 --> 02:07:24.500
Now, each time you go back to the well... Of course, antibiotics are something that in our history, we can explore and see what they did.

02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:29.483
And one of the things that antibiotics did was completely get rid of the idea of phages.

02:07:30.683 --> 02:07:31.444
But actually,

02:07:32.839 --> 02:07:45.276
In the early 20th century phages were a real thing they worked really well and there were a couple scientists that did really well with phages and cured a lot of things including really resistant bacteria.

02:07:45.757 --> 02:07:49.382
Phages were so popular actually that there were even

02:07:50.123 --> 02:07:56.786
you know, like little pamphlets that you could see from France where they had bacteriophages and they sold them.

02:07:57.226 --> 02:08:02.428
And they were produced by the Laboratory of Bacteriophages of Professor de Hul.

02:08:02.488 --> 02:08:12.953
And he's like a really famous scientist who did a lot of work on bacteriophages and curing diseases with bacteriophages, observed

02:08:13.613 --> 02:08:16.515
the phage cycles in the Ganges River, etc.

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:21.099
This guy is a really, really interesting biologist.

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:33.168
And in fact, what I'm showing you here are just some advertisements that happened to survive from his work in phages from France.

02:08:33.368 --> 02:08:36.090
These are from the early 20th century.

02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:41.835
So talking about bacteria and talking about antibiotics is completely ignoring

02:08:42.415 --> 02:08:51.417
a 50-year history of combating infections, even very persistent infections, with a library of phages.

02:08:51.517 --> 02:09:04.079
And a lot of these phages were actually stored in a library in a former Russian Republic, Tajikistan or something like that.

02:09:04.099 --> 02:09:09.100
I have to look it up again because I read the book a while ago, but it's remarkable

02:09:10.211 --> 02:09:13.994
how much of this biology is simply omitted from biology 101.

02:09:14.515 --> 02:09:35.593
And if you don't omit it, and you realize that there was a long time when we were using intramuscular injection, primarily for morphine, and that people were making concoctions of bacteriophages, storing bacteriophages, creating libraries of them, looking for them that would work and finding them.

02:09:35.653 --> 02:09:37.735
And those techniques are all but lost now.

02:09:38.803 --> 02:09:45.804
because of antibiotics and the presumption that antibiotics had made phage biology kind of irrelevant.

02:09:45.864 --> 02:09:48.625
And it turns out, I think actually to be the opposite.

02:09:48.765 --> 02:09:54.506
I think antibiotics have made phage biology almost inevitable at this stage.

02:09:54.546 --> 02:09:57.746
And so that's what he's kind of talking about without talking about it.

02:09:58.466 --> 02:10:00.587
So far eBay has done pretty well, right?

02:10:00.687 --> 02:10:06.488
eBay gave me a couple of pretty good little pieces of, pieces of property to talk about there.

02:10:06.528 --> 02:10:06.968
I like that.

02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:09.491
You've got to come up with the next generation thing.

02:10:09.531 --> 02:10:11.152
It's getting harder and harder to do that.

02:10:11.332 --> 02:10:12.693
The low-hanging fruit is plucked.

02:10:13.134 --> 02:10:25.842
What an incredibly complex problem, because on one hand, you have these organisms that are essential for life, can live in these insane environments that other life forms can't exist in, and yet, they also kill us.

02:10:26.342 --> 02:10:29.144
You know, people say to me, how far away are we from the iceberg?

02:10:29.705 --> 02:10:31.226
The ship has hit the iceberg.

02:10:32.026 --> 02:10:37.610
If these bugs spread, which they may well, that's when the lifeboats go under and we all drown.

02:10:39.652 --> 02:10:42.795
Coming up... I found what I thought were cactus spines in my arms.

02:10:43.336 --> 02:10:43.896
I don't know what they were.

02:10:44.157 --> 02:10:46.399
We were seeing these odd fibers in our skin.

02:10:46.699 --> 02:10:48.121
Traveled across my eyeball.

02:10:48.481 --> 02:10:49.782
Oh, yeah, I do see a scar.

02:10:50.403 --> 02:10:53.566
And later... This was extracted from a woman's body.

02:10:53.586 --> 02:10:54.547
There's some fibers.

02:10:54.928 --> 02:10:56.890
Okay, what the hell is that?

02:11:00.277 --> 02:11:02.878
in any of the countless labs sprinkled across the world.

02:11:03.278 --> 02:11:11.722
But even without human intervention, these tiny mutating microbes keep finding ways to adapt and thrive.

02:11:12.122 --> 02:11:16.584
They continue to resist medication and figure out ways to spread.

02:11:17.184 --> 02:11:18.825
How in trouble are we?

02:11:22.802 --> 02:11:26.625
It's very spooky talking to these guys about diseases and their potential.

02:11:26.665 --> 02:11:28.146
See, they're still testing it out.

02:11:28.266 --> 02:11:29.426
And I really believe it.

02:11:29.506 --> 02:11:35.490
Right now you're watching a snippet of the transition where people are realizing that, you know what?

02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:41.114
The most convincing part of this goofy show is when these two people sit down and talk with each other.

02:11:42.415 --> 02:11:44.096
Maybe we should just do an hour of that.

02:11:45.557 --> 02:11:46.918
Or two hours or three hours.

02:11:46.978 --> 02:11:48.039
Maybe we should do a daily.

02:11:48.119 --> 02:11:49.700
Holy cow, this works perfectly.

02:11:50.768 --> 02:12:00.585
And then actually about 10 years later, Mike Osterholm is on his podcast in 2020 telling everybody that it's just a natural virus.

02:12:04.827 --> 02:12:08.628
sort of a gigantic worldwide pandemic.

02:12:08.888 --> 02:12:11.188
I never thought it was a real possibility.

02:12:11.228 --> 02:12:12.248
I never really considered it.

02:12:12.728 --> 02:12:16.229
And this find is actually Mark Kulak's find.

02:12:16.289 --> 02:12:19.490
Make sure you know that Housatonic ITS while he was on vacation.

02:12:20.210 --> 02:12:33.012
After a brief discussion with me about Kathy Griffin and the head of Donald Trump and Snoop Dogg and his music video with the gun with the flag that said bang,

02:12:34.732 --> 02:12:43.255
Mark Kulak went bananas and found out that all of these people that were involved in Trump derangement syndrome were actually connected to Steve Bannon directly.

02:12:43.795 --> 02:12:53.559
And so it looks like the same apparatus that drove everybody to the Maha movement was also represented on the other side driving people to Trump derangement syndrome.

02:12:54.119 --> 02:12:57.540
And right in the middle is this performer called Joe Rogan.

02:12:58.206 --> 02:13:07.090
who is connected to Kimmel and connected to all of these people that we thought were on different sides of something, when they're really not.

02:13:07.130 --> 02:13:09.111
They're all actors on the same stage.

02:13:10.011 --> 02:13:15.454
It is terrifying to think that there are new diseases and mutations sprouting up on a daily basis.

02:13:16.514 --> 02:13:17.715
Have you heard of Morgellons?

02:13:17.895 --> 02:13:18.535
Yeah, I've heard of it.

02:13:18.915 --> 02:13:23.357
For folks who haven't, I've posted a bunch of research about it at sci-fi.com.

02:13:23.798 --> 02:13:30.161
It is some sort of a new phenomenon that many people dismiss, including legitimate doctors.

02:13:30.281 --> 02:13:35.944
I've talked to a legitimate doctor in the field of bioweapons, and I said, what do you know about Morgellons?

02:13:35.964 --> 02:13:37.384
He's like, oh, Morgellons.

02:13:37.524 --> 02:13:38.665
Ah, you know, a lot of those people are crazy.

02:13:39.665 --> 02:13:43.646
I've talked to some of these folks that have this disease, and it's not all crazy people.

02:13:43.967 --> 02:13:48.988
We got a hold of this video of this woman, and she needs help, and she doesn't want her identity revealed.

02:13:49.148 --> 02:13:49.788
Just check this out.

02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.689
Hi, Joe.

02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:55.970
I've had the disease they call Morgellons for about 15 years now.

02:13:56.290 --> 02:14:02.652
Strange fibers that aren't able to be identified come out of my body, and I sure would like to have some help finding out what they are.

02:14:03.052 --> 02:14:07.514
I've got a little handheld microscope, and I can show you a picture of what's on my skin.

02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:10.622
This is a typical viper that we have.

02:14:10.642 --> 02:14:13.144
Oh, there's a black one.

02:14:14.225 --> 02:14:15.667
Oh, and there's one of those long ones.

02:14:17.368 --> 02:14:20.692
The stuff that's actually on my hand is like a callus.

02:14:23.648 --> 02:14:32.555
And so what I think you see here is a kind of confusing of stuff.

02:14:32.615 --> 02:14:39.120
It's not that dissimilar to what somebody like Judy Mikovits would do with regard to chronic fatigue syndrome.

02:14:40.041 --> 02:14:53.771
autism and chronic disease and start to just try to draw this or create this very gray area, a mystery, a full of mysteries, you know, inside of mysteries where we don't really know about any of these things.

02:14:54.571 --> 02:15:03.078
This, this, it's remarkable because somewhere inside of here is the potential for everybody in the world to be in danger.

02:15:03.518 --> 02:15:10.824
And so all this other stuff is just smoke and mirrors because in the end, we keep repeating the idea that the whole world is in danger.

02:15:10.864 --> 02:15:13.586
We've already hit the iceberg, as that guy said.

02:15:13.746 --> 02:15:17.810
It's for me, but for a whole community of people that are being knocked out of society.

02:15:20.828 --> 02:15:25.409
Morgellons is another example of strange things that can happen to the human body.

02:15:25.949 --> 02:15:30.110
Is Morgellons one of those mutations that Dr. Spellberg warned me about?

02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:36.951
Whatever it is, this creepy condition, disease, is affecting more and more people every day.

02:15:37.311 --> 02:15:42.873
One of them is Dr. Greg Smith, who not only studies Morgellons, but actually has it.

02:15:43.093 --> 02:15:48.674
Dr. Smith may seem a little unusual, but what he has to say is really odd.

02:15:49.594 --> 02:15:54.036
Public knowledge about this disease needs to just continue to be expanded.

02:15:54.256 --> 02:15:55.937
How did you realize you had it?

02:15:56.177 --> 02:16:02.580
I found what I thought were cactus vines in my arms, but they don't really look like cactus vines.

02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:09.112
As a physician, I studied all the anatomy and the physiology of the skin, and this wasn't normal at all.

02:16:09.172 --> 02:16:10.693
Like, what kind of odd stuff was happening?

02:16:10.933 --> 02:16:16.255
We were seeing these odd fibers in our skin, as well as other unusual things.

02:16:16.275 --> 02:16:17.356
I don't know what those things are.

02:16:17.876 --> 02:16:18.516
I don't know what they were.

02:16:19.297 --> 02:16:21.597
But I happened to get one of these little specks in my eye.

02:16:22.258 --> 02:16:25.199
OK, so I took my glasses off, went in, and looked at my eye.

02:16:25.759 --> 02:16:29.041
And this was totally the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life.

02:16:29.481 --> 02:16:32.262
That piece of fluff traveled across my eyeball.

02:16:33.885 --> 02:16:38.388
It hurt like a son of a gun as it went across the cornea, and then started digging in right on the edge.

02:16:38.829 --> 02:16:40.590
And if you can see that scar there?

02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:41.391
Oh, yeah.

02:16:41.411 --> 02:16:42.091
I do see a scar.

02:16:42.111 --> 02:16:42.531
Do you see it now?

02:16:42.571 --> 02:16:43.032
Yeah.

02:16:43.252 --> 02:16:44.373
Oh, in your eyeball itself.

02:16:44.513 --> 02:16:45.233
Top of the eyeball, right.

02:16:45.273 --> 02:16:45.534
Yeah.

02:16:45.894 --> 02:16:50.257
So you had this Morgellons lesion in your eyeball itself.

02:16:50.317 --> 02:16:52.059
What it was was a little fluff ball.

02:16:52.299 --> 02:16:54.981
It's really little tiny balls of fibers intertwined together.

02:16:55.822 --> 02:16:56.062
Uh-huh.

02:16:56.342 --> 02:16:58.525
Something's got to be stimulating the body to cause this.

02:16:59.206 --> 02:16:59.606
Right.

02:17:00.187 --> 02:17:07.696
There is a significant amount of not just neurological, but psychiatric symptoms from this disorder.

02:17:07.756 --> 02:17:14.704
And that's hard for people who are not medical and who are sick and whose brain is not working well because they've got the Morgans.

02:17:15.305 --> 02:17:18.987
And it probably supports the idea that it's a psychosomatic illness, or at least clouds the waters.

02:17:19.047 --> 02:17:19.608
Of course it does.

02:17:19.668 --> 02:17:20.969
It clouds the waters big time.

02:17:21.329 --> 02:17:23.770
What are your theories about the origins of this disease?

02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:25.071
Do you have a theory yourself?

02:17:25.812 --> 02:17:34.737
The research that has been done most recently, the last couple of years, about Morgellons, shows that these systemic symptoms are related to Lyme disease.

02:17:35.598 --> 02:17:40.661
I think this Morgellons is probably something else along with it that causes the funky fibers.

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:46.164
So Lyme disease, a disease that compromises the immune system might leave you susceptible to this.

02:17:46.464 --> 02:17:52.790
So far, the vast majority of patients who have Morgellons when tested appropriately will also be found to have.

02:17:53.350 --> 02:18:03.859
What's so bizarre about this story is that if you can find the fibers and you can take pictures of them, then why aren't we talking about what the fibers are made of?

02:18:06.181 --> 02:18:08.984
Are the fibers all the same across patients?

02:18:12.008 --> 02:18:15.291
Do you see how imprecise and almost dumb this is?

02:18:26.693 --> 02:18:28.254
You've helped us quite a bit.

02:18:28.714 --> 02:18:33.817
If I thought I had fibers crawling across my eyeballs I think I'd be suffering too.

02:18:34.077 --> 02:18:41.981
So we need to find out what exactly is this Morgellons disease and is it a part of this bio-pocalypse that we keep hearing about.

02:18:42.421 --> 02:18:51.185
We had a podcast listener that sent us some samples of things that she had pulled from her body and we're gonna bring them to seal samples and we have

02:18:52.506 --> 02:18:54.047
Yeah, sometimes.

02:18:55.108 --> 02:18:55.449
I would.

02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:59.992
It's all, like, diatomaceous earth.

02:19:00.793 --> 02:19:01.954
Diatomaceous earth?

02:19:02.294 --> 02:19:03.636
What is diatomaceous earth?

02:19:03.916 --> 02:19:05.977
Like, ocean life that has been...

02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:09.152
Dead for eons.

02:19:09.532 --> 02:19:14.196
They use it for swimming pool filters, organic pesticide for plants.

02:19:14.656 --> 02:19:18.400
Yeah, it looks like little sponges or filters.

02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:21.442
So is it possible that that's human skin?

02:19:22.383 --> 02:19:23.444
No.

02:19:23.584 --> 02:19:24.465
It is organic.

02:19:24.545 --> 02:19:25.926
It's just not human.

02:19:26.126 --> 02:19:27.988
So it's not from a human body, definitely?

02:19:28.368 --> 02:19:28.568
Right.

02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:32.652
There's nothing to indicate that this came out of a human.

02:19:35.387 --> 02:19:37.568
So what exactly is Morgellons?

02:19:38.288 --> 02:19:45.730
I'm convinced that Morgellons is a real disease, but I'm also pretty convinced that it's probably not going to be the start of the biopocalypse.

02:19:46.090 --> 02:19:47.050
Well, thank you very much.

02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:49.031
This has been very illuminating.

02:19:49.091 --> 02:19:49.991
I really appreciate it.

02:19:50.131 --> 02:19:52.752
And it's very fascinating machinery you got here.

02:19:58.464 --> 02:19:59.905
Here's what I learned in my journey.

02:20:00.206 --> 02:20:00.806
Here is what he learned.

02:20:00.826 --> 02:20:03.508
Our bodies are not just an individual organism.

02:20:03.769 --> 02:20:07.312
We are an ecosystem of literally trillions of organisms.

02:20:07.652 --> 02:20:10.474
That's what makes a biopocalypse possible.

02:20:11.135 --> 02:20:20.503
When you talk to people that are in the know, they'll tell you the biggest threat to mankind isn't nuclear war or terrorism, but it's biology itself.

02:20:20.903 --> 02:20:26.128
The smartest minds in the world literally have no idea what's coming down.

02:20:26.368 --> 02:20:31.171
As soon as they come up with a cure, the bugs mutate and find their way around it.

02:20:31.311 --> 02:20:34.892
The bottom line is that this is a war that will never be won.

02:20:35.373 --> 02:20:39.415
We just have to hope that we win more battles than the bugs do.

02:20:41.172 --> 02:20:41.992
Where is Rogan?

02:20:42.092 --> 02:20:43.693
Why do I get sent to these kinds of things?

02:20:43.933 --> 02:20:44.353
Hello?

02:20:44.473 --> 02:20:46.534
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

02:20:46.554 --> 02:20:59.639
Make sure you understand that endemicity is a myth, that placebos made it safe, that using PCR to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster, but it definitely, there's a good reason why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

02:20:59.679 --> 02:21:02.420
It's because this is for all the grandchildren of Earth.

02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:03.640
Thank you very much for being here.

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.001
I will see you again tomorrow.

02:21:05.521 --> 02:21:08.522
Don't forget, the red team is going to lose

02:21:09.142 --> 02:21:14.767
The blue team has always been losing and there's only one way out and that's the truth.

02:21:14.947 --> 02:21:15.788
Thanks for being here.

02:21:16.268 --> 02:21:17.009
See you again soon.
