WEBVTT

01:10.412 --> 01:10.492
You

01:36.482 --> 01:57.957
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

01:59.571 --> 02:04.455
But I know for sure that they are combining our lack of a lot of other people in our channel's sights.

02:04.495 --> 02:06.377
But no, I'm anxious to help you in this COVID crisis.

02:06.397 --> 02:10.240
I think we all have to change, but I would like to have our voices heard.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.921
Have more of these people possible.

02:21.169 --> 02:22.610
I think this one's going to be important.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.811
I know they're all important.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.314
Liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.777
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:30.857 --> 02:40.304
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:40.344 --> 02:46.930
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:38.393 --> 03:46.335
Bones make a spot on my haggle-white mood.

03:46.495 --> 03:54.597
I have my hands on your hips, but my head is at the door.

03:54.717 --> 03:56.697
They say it works.

03:57.217 --> 03:57.998
I tried.

04:10.034 --> 04:20.102
But no matter how I do it, my house won't protect me anymore.

04:20.162 --> 04:27.907
It's raining harder than I can handle, harder than I can think.

04:28.988 --> 04:31.990
It's raining harder than the ground,

04:47.155 --> 04:54.239
I have my hands on your hips, but my head is at the door.

05:14.512 --> 05:37.173
It's as if no one lives here As if nothing is happening It's raining harder than I can take Harder than I can drink It's raining harder than the ground can take

06:12.998 --> 06:20.705
The buoys are too dark, for my sky is blue in mud.

06:21.045 --> 06:31.895
Because my head is in the clouds, and a hand already at the door.

06:45.820 --> 07:04.478
It's raining harder than the ground can handle Harder than I can handle It's raining harder than I can handle Harder than I can drink

07:50.321 --> 07:52.282
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

07:53.382 --> 07:58.063
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.321
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

08:02.823 --> 08:03.643
It's embarrassing.

08:21.317 --> 08:25.561
Here we are ladies and gentlemen again, running the gamut, running the...

08:27.051 --> 08:51.749
running the rat race if you will trying to keep up with these people trying to make them keep up with us actually is what we are doing because as we take control of our attention again and we take control of our consciousness these people are going to have to up the ante on their on their military operation on their on their social media attempt at controlling us and enforcing these

08:52.589 --> 09:12.805
charlatans power because that's i've started to see this in a little different light that's part of the reason why i'm inspired to do a different show today than biology 101 because this morning i got up and every morning i get up and try and think about what am i missing what am i not thinking about how am i how am i trapped still

09:13.365 --> 09:16.806
by this coordinated group of liars on the internet.

09:17.346 --> 09:23.187
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

09:23.728 --> 09:26.548
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

09:26.908 --> 09:30.269
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

09:30.749 --> 09:32.810
And we are working diligently to

09:33.570 --> 09:38.914
to codify all of the biological observations from the past that edify these ideas.

09:38.975 --> 09:40.816
And I think we're doing a very good job of it.

09:41.256 --> 09:43.678
The mystery virus does not equal excess deaths.

09:43.718 --> 09:45.240
They always knew this was going to happen.

09:45.680 --> 09:53.807
And so they took advantage of this opportunity with murder and lies to create the illusion of a pandemic when there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

09:55.469 --> 10:09.876
And that's the reason why a lot of these lawyers are also not really objectively or, let's say, earnestly solving the problem using what should be, you know, law school L1 level understanding of American law.

10:10.737 --> 10:13.858
We're not talking about the right terms or combining the right words.

10:13.918 --> 10:14.759
And that's the problem.

10:15.779 --> 10:31.006
Instead, we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, about transfection and about RNA and what it can and can't do in order to break the illusion of consensus these people created by sticking to that limited spectrum of debate about a lab leak, about gain-of-function viruses.

10:31.046 --> 10:39.971
This is all how we are now being governed by a bunch of people who go on podcasts and talk to each other about what they say are the problems that need solving.

10:40.371 --> 10:42.512
And as long as we accept that these people

10:44.793 --> 10:59.540
these people are having useful debates with each other, as long as we accept that these people are arguing on our behalf, then they will be the acolytes that quietly assist the elite in running this show.

11:00.580 --> 11:03.462
And I believe that's what happened at the rescue of the Republic.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.923
And I've got a new idea.

11:06.003 --> 11:09.985
I mean, it's something that someone has always been trying to push on me.

11:11.613 --> 11:20.199
Always trying to, I've had a lot of friends in the background, advice in the background, viewers that send me thoughtful emails in the background.

11:20.219 --> 11:28.906
And so I am challenged all the time to reorganize how I think about these people that we argue with and about the subjects that we argue about.

11:28.986 --> 11:38.293
I'm forced all the time to think about how it is that I'm still accepting this narrative or may still be useful tool to them.

11:39.238 --> 11:54.535
because we are we are being governed by this mythology so coming out of this fighting our way out of it is not going to be as simple as taking the goggles off because the lights are bright and these people know that's what has been

11:55.967 --> 12:09.450
bugging me in the back of my head for the longest time is that they already knew there were going to be people like Mark Kulak and Jonathan Cooley and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.050
and all these people.

12:11.090 --> 12:20.792
They've known all of us, known about us, known about our kind, known about our type of people for generations.

12:23.206 --> 12:33.273
Ladies and gentlemen, you're talking to Jonathan Cooey, or listening, rather, to Jonathan Cooey, Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

12:34.333 --> 12:42.539
For about 15 to 16 years, I was a patch clamp physiologist, which is a microscope and mouse brain guy.

12:43.600 --> 12:49.704
I made a lot of recordings from a lot of brain slices, and I published a few papers about it over the course of

12:50.464 --> 12:55.066
It looks like they're 20 years, but really the useful amount of work there is less than 20 years.

12:55.966 --> 13:02.068
You can find the last year or so of my work on the internet at stream.gigaohm.bio.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.388
It's not a perfect website.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.549
It's not a perfect server.

13:05.329 --> 13:11.711
I think we're going to need to invest a little bit more money into it so that it's a little more reliable and a little more smooth for people that watch.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.432
But it's better than nothing right now.

13:14.692 --> 13:17.113
And it is actually quite exceptional.

13:18.213 --> 13:21.315
In the grand scheme of things because not a lot of other people are doing this.

13:21.355 --> 13:41.748
We've got that peer tube channel there There are other channels there including a clips channel you can find my calendar the courses I'm teaching the books you need for that the archive of other videos that I think are important like videos of Kevin McKernan from 2020 and then of course Mark Kulak at Housatonic ITS is now publishing an archive there as well.

13:41.828 --> 13:41.948
So

13:43.768 --> 13:57.211
It is a ongoing project, but please share it, try to use it, figure out how it works, criticize it, tell me what you're having problems with, so that Ted and I can optimize it, even if that means we have to invest more money in it.

13:57.571 --> 13:58.451
That's the point, right?

13:58.591 --> 14:04.212
A bigger server with more GPUs, or however the hell that works, will make everything run smoother.

14:04.232 --> 14:09.193
And if it's not running smooth, I want it running smooth, so I need people watching and critiquing from that site.

14:11.860 --> 14:12.581
Holy cow.

14:13.441 --> 14:14.562
Let me move over here.

14:17.785 --> 14:19.206
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

14:19.927 --> 14:24.190
Coming to you live from Pittsburgh at 12.06 Eastern Standard Time.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.072
Apologize for being late.

14:26.112 --> 14:30.135
Like I said, I've been really inspired this morning and the course of this week.

14:32.199 --> 14:41.269
Basketball tryouts, puppies, just a lot of farms, talking about renting to own things.

14:41.849 --> 14:52.921
There's just a lot of wheels turning in the background right now that Giga Home Biological has needed to turn in the background for a while and trying to get to turn in the background for a while.

14:53.562 --> 15:01.564
And so as these things come forward and opportunities now start to come to fruition, I hope we're going to have a lot of good news.

15:01.604 --> 15:12.866
In case you're not aware, we are going to put on the first ever, for ourselves, for this little LLC, sole proprietorship, our first ever live live stream.

15:12.946 --> 15:17.787
So I have booked the local community center here in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania,

15:18.607 --> 15:21.168
and we have a capacity of 250 people.

15:22.089 --> 15:28.352
I will have my rig set up on stage and a hard line and we will just do the same thing that I'm doing now.

15:29.413 --> 15:39.918
I will stream, but then I'll have a studio audience and we'll have some mics and maybe we'll get food, maybe we'll have a barbecue, maybe there'll only be 10 people there and it will be a complete joke.

15:40.118 --> 15:40.498
I don't know.

15:41.139 --> 15:44.741
But the main drill for me was to see if I could

15:45.621 --> 15:56.210
set up a rig somewhere else and successfully live stream from somewhere else because the family has a number of ideas about how we could spend next summer and the following year.

15:56.270 --> 15:59.032
And one of those ideas would be streaming on the road.

16:00.233 --> 16:06.978
And another one of those ideas would be moving to a more rural living location where we're renting anyway.

16:08.359 --> 16:27.663
and having a more of a farm-like setting where my backdrop could be different, our location could be different, my kids could have a lot more outdoorsy kind of stuff, and we can, you know, shake a can on the internet from somewhere a little more comfortable than in the middle of a small, albeit very, very wonderful city of Pittsburgh.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.664
I'm not saying I'm not grateful for where I am, I'm just saying that

16:31.184 --> 16:42.273
in the grand scheme of things, since we pay so much for this house because we're in the city, we probably could pay a similar rent and have something very, very much different somewhere else.

16:42.313 --> 16:44.054
And so we're trying to figure that out as well.

16:45.455 --> 16:54.622
And again, I can only say that I'm immensely grateful for all the people's names that are over there and the people that aren't there yet, but should be.

16:55.203 --> 16:56.344
There's just a lot of

16:58.339 --> 17:15.407
There's been a lot of opportunity given to me and my family that has been very hard to see and seize because of the stress and the uncertainty of this, call it a job if you want, this mission that we're on.

17:16.707 --> 17:19.549
So, whoa, that was, sorry, a little loud.

17:19.629 --> 17:24.111
I didn't, I guess I overloaded the memory here.

17:24.151 --> 17:26.111
Let me just escape and start that slide again.

17:29.245 --> 17:40.730
I would say that again we are still at the stage where there are some basic things that if we wanted to, we could definitely get this, get this to work.

17:40.850 --> 17:42.751
If we really wanted.

17:44.312 --> 17:45.614
and people really wanted to.

17:45.654 --> 17:51.822
There are very succinct ways to say, at least about the public health system, what's wrong with it.

17:52.042 --> 17:56.788
And clearly these people are very adept at avoiding that.

17:57.069 --> 17:59.852
And so that's what you see when you hear Steve Kirsch

18:00.433 --> 18:09.877
talking on the Stu Peters podcast, or you hear Elon Musk talking to Tucker Carlson, or you hear Brett Weinstein talking to someone, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:09.917 --> 18:10.797
talking to someone.

18:10.937 --> 18:12.218
It's always the same.

18:12.678 --> 18:26.524
They're trying to be very specific about very specific things that they think are bad, and they don't actually want to talk about the biological ideas that edify their position, because if they had to explain it, they wouldn't be able to get here.

18:27.631 --> 18:27.831
Right?

18:27.871 --> 18:33.036
Their avoiding arriving at these conclusions would become obvious.

18:33.076 --> 18:42.345
And so that's why they're in charge of the narrative and why the narrative has very quickly pivoted over the last year or so, which is, you know, for me, very quick.

18:43.106 --> 18:45.328
But for you, it probably feels like forever.

18:45.388 --> 18:50.873
But really, that's quite quick that they eventually decided to pivot to do not talk about 2020 anymore.

18:52.134 --> 18:56.878
Never mind what Robert Malone said to Paul Cuttrell on several podcasts in 2021.

18:58.019 --> 19:04.723
Don't go back and see that because that would reveal that there was a different thing happening.

19:07.305 --> 19:10.828
And so they, of course, don't want you to think in longer timescales.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.450
They don't want you to think in terms of population.

19:13.490 --> 19:15.852
They don't want you to think in terms of governance.

19:17.031 --> 19:27.544
Because if you did think on longer timescales and you did think about governance and you did really think about depopulation, then you wouldn't be thinking about them killing us.

19:27.584 --> 19:31.849
What you would be thinking about was what depopulation problem are they talking about?

19:33.615 --> 19:57.673
And the depopulation problem they were talking about is the big families after World War II and that era of prosperity where people were having lots of children and we were having medical advances, which have led to, of course, a preponderance of old people that from a retirement perspective and public health perspective and from social medicine perspective could potentially bankrupt any one of these countries where

19:58.473 --> 20:07.680
in the course of trying to govern a large population growing at a potentially exponential rate, they discouraged family size.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.903
And so now we are left with the remnants of this in the data.

20:12.383 --> 20:13.364
And they knew that.

20:13.484 --> 20:22.351
So why in the world would they just tell you that we expect all-cause mortality to go up by a few million people every year around the world because there's more old people dying?

20:23.604 --> 20:30.869
when they could tell you something that would benefit the governance of you by them for generations.

20:32.950 --> 20:39.135
And the thing that really struck me this morning when I woke up and inspired me to change the topic today

20:41.331 --> 20:46.916
is all scribbled down on this piece of paper here, but I haven't been thinking at the right timescale.

20:46.936 --> 20:49.918
And every time I think at the right timescale, new things come out.

20:49.958 --> 20:57.445
That's why I showed that video with the rock the other day, the German video where there's these two rocks on the mountain and they're watching humanity.

20:57.465 --> 21:03.070
And on their timescale, they can't even see the people moving.

21:03.750 --> 21:07.834
They just see houses and crumbling buildings and this kind of thing.

21:09.161 --> 21:17.868
And so if you think on their time scale, and that's what I challenge myself to do every time when I get up in the morning, I sit down in the chair and I try to think, what are they thinking?

21:17.928 --> 21:22.792
What would I, how would I contribute to what I imagine their plan is?

21:22.832 --> 21:25.074
And this morning I got hit by a bowling ball.

21:27.896 --> 21:29.618
Like something just knocked me over.

21:30.851 --> 21:37.413
And so what I want to do is start here at this introduction and go through my introduction, albeit a little tiny bit shorter.

21:37.493 --> 21:40.774
It's still going to be annoying for those people who hate it that I do it every day.

21:43.655 --> 21:50.397
And then segue into gene drives and why gene drives are more interesting than you might think.

21:51.797 --> 21:58.819
And more malevolent and terrifying than I ever thought possible until I realized what they could be used for.

22:00.171 --> 22:06.914
And now, I'm standing in front or sitting in front of the wrong slide here, in the sense of what I'm talking about.

22:06.954 --> 22:18.878
But I want to preface this by saying why it is that I think this repeating this introduction, and then understanding why I'm doing Biology 101.

22:18.918 --> 22:18.978
Now,

22:26.061 --> 22:49.173
I want to do Biology 101 because I want people to understand that the foundation of your introduction to biology is fundamental to how your entire understanding of your world forms as you listen, read, and think about these ideas.

22:50.214 --> 22:52.615
And so it is of paramount importance for

22:54.005 --> 23:20.841
any kid's introduction to biology, if they're going to achieve what they want to achieve, it's so important for kids to start with molecular biology and most importantly, their version of molecular biology, their simplified, stunted version of molecular biology that underpins ultimately people like Sam Harris saying that there's no free will.

23:22.711 --> 23:24.192
because everything is determined.

23:24.272 --> 23:31.698
Because from the molecular level onward, it's just chemistry and physics interplaying like a clock.

23:32.318 --> 23:43.907
And it's just our inability to measure or understand or see at that time scale and that size that prevents us from fully being able to just kind of predict the future like we predict the weather.

23:46.328 --> 23:49.631
And make no mistake about it, that is the bridge.

23:51.311 --> 24:02.192
That is the thought that has to get a seed in your garden of your mind and then grows as a weed.

24:03.925 --> 24:23.016
and spreads throughout your garden as a weed that you think that, wow, I mean, if DNA is there and evolution is real, then I guess that means that basically we are a spontaneous process that potentially we could take control of, not that dissimilar to the breeding of a dog.

24:26.938 --> 24:29.120
And incidentally, something that I did yesterday,

24:31.744 --> 24:33.565
really also got me thinking about this.

24:33.605 --> 24:37.346
And I'm just gonna keep talking because I'm only gonna do this one show today.

24:37.366 --> 24:39.787
And if it's goofy, it's only for you guys anyway.

24:40.428 --> 24:42.869
I just wanna share all these things and how they're coming together.

24:43.489 --> 24:56.474
Years ago in Amsterdam, when I was doing my PhD, we were out one night and I don't remember what kind of crew we were in, but we were all drinking and having a good time and talking about things.

24:57.174 --> 24:57.935
And I actually,

25:01.323 --> 25:02.664
I have it framed back here.

25:03.564 --> 25:06.405
Shit, did I just stand up and show you I'm wearing green sweatpants?

25:08.966 --> 25:12.067
I think I just stood up and showed you I was wearing green sweatpants.

25:12.107 --> 25:12.788
Hey, guess what?

25:13.768 --> 25:14.628
It's not serious.

25:14.688 --> 25:17.309
I'm just in my garage, so I'm wearing my green sweatpants.

25:17.369 --> 25:18.110
Surprise, surprise.

25:19.150 --> 25:27.634
Let me go over here and go over here.

25:28.274 --> 25:28.514
Whoops.

25:30.084 --> 25:32.285
Um, why isn't that on?

25:35.086 --> 25:35.606
That's weird.

25:35.646 --> 25:36.526
Why isn't this on?

25:38.967 --> 25:41.047
I want to show you this thing that I'm holding in my hand.

25:41.647 --> 25:47.869
Uh, but I thought my, my table camera was on and I don't see it's on what's happening.

25:52.110 --> 25:52.871
That's so weird.

25:52.911 --> 25:53.871
Why isn't it coming on?

25:54.771 --> 25:56.112
It's like it's broken or something.

25:57.052 --> 25:57.132
Uh,

26:00.939 --> 26:01.980
So anyway, I'll show you this.

26:02.020 --> 26:02.861
This is a napkin.

26:02.881 --> 26:06.364
Yeah, I can do that.

26:06.444 --> 26:07.225
Sorry, I can do that.

26:08.486 --> 26:14.992
It's a napkin that I drew when I was sitting in a cafe in Amsterdam all those years ago in Iceland.

26:16.115 --> 26:18.976
is the most pure genetic population in the world, you see.

26:18.996 --> 26:24.078
And then I have plaques and tangles, plaques and tangles, plaques and tangles.

26:24.338 --> 26:29.700
And then you see in that down in the bottom there, you see this thing right here, that's a Eppendorf tube.

26:30.240 --> 26:30.601
See that?

26:30.741 --> 26:32.101
That's an Eppendorf tube.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.723
And it says human, human tissue going in an Eppendorf tube.

26:37.822 --> 26:42.225
And plaques and tangles, plaques and tangles, that's all about Alzheimer's disease.

26:42.945 --> 26:47.548
And then you can see here, I was drawing the canals, like I'm not an artist, obviously.

26:49.149 --> 26:54.272
So the point is, is that, why isn't this working?

26:54.332 --> 26:56.914
I'm still trying to figure out why this is not coming on.

26:58.435 --> 27:01.217
There, that's blinked and it went funny.

27:01.577 --> 27:02.397
And why isn't it?

27:05.579 --> 27:06.680
It's still not showing up.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.426
I don't understand that.

27:12.686 --> 27:13.348
Hmm.

27:14.731 --> 27:15.753
I want to fix this.

27:16.254 --> 27:17.698
Oh, that might not have been all the way in.

27:24.193 --> 27:25.513
Ah, I want to fix that.

27:25.553 --> 27:27.314
OK, I'll have to fix that later.

27:27.334 --> 27:28.414
I don't know what's going on here.

27:28.474 --> 27:32.775
Something came apart or something is not connected because my table camera doesn't work.

27:32.815 --> 27:39.976
And I really wanted you to see this just because I want you to understand that this has been in the back of my mind for a very long time and trying to understand it.

27:40.216 --> 27:50.318
But from a perspective of how do I get ahead in academic science, this is me getting enthusiastic about understanding what they wanted to do, which was take human tissue

27:51.246 --> 27:59.389
with Alzheimer's disease, plaques and tangles, and look for the genes that are altered or different from people that don't have plaques and tangles.

28:00.649 --> 28:10.192
And then those genes would be the things that you would knock out in a mouse, or you would up-regulate or down-regulate, or chart through development.

28:11.943 --> 28:13.645
Now, why is this important?

28:13.685 --> 28:19.971
Well, because we have been arguing, Mark and I have been arguing, among other people have been arguing, that this

28:23.049 --> 28:27.451
this population thing, they knew that there was gonna be excess deaths.

28:27.531 --> 28:38.995
And more importantly, they know they've already got the population thing kind of under control because population is going to collapse because family size has decreased and has continued to decrease.

28:39.055 --> 28:48.139
They know, these actuaries all know that our population is not gonna stay 10 billion people for very much longer.

28:51.921 --> 28:52.661
They know that.

28:54.019 --> 29:03.524
And if you think in a multi-generational way, and you think about it, it's a great idea to have everybody think that it's as simple as just trying to get rid of people.

29:04.004 --> 29:09.047
But Mark has made the point, and I will make the point, that they would never waste that resource.

29:09.827 --> 29:16.611
That's a tremendous number of experimental animals that would otherwise be very useful, essentially medical remnants.

29:17.311 --> 29:20.013
Why in the world would you wait until these people are dead?

29:22.503 --> 29:35.272
what if you if you can convince them that you're just killing them when in reality you're using them their whole life to achieve something that can only be seen from a multi-generational perspective now that's a different story

29:37.642 --> 29:54.592
And so I believe Mark is right, or I believe that I'm right, or I believe that we are all who have said this are right, that the Human Genome Project was the announcement, the start of a transition to a new kind of governance where nation states would be in the way.

29:55.653 --> 30:06.660
And they used this population signal, this known coming rise in all cause mortality to tell us a national security story, a global

30:07.833 --> 30:21.063
health, public emergency story, and all they had to do was murder a few thousand people in America, and the rest would take care of itself, because it would just be coordinated lies about that murder.

30:22.764 --> 30:35.734
Now, the nice thing about this is that they've done it in all different ways, and so there's not one way to see it, but there are a few things that they leave out all the time, the opioids, the supplemental oxygen, and the idea that they knew that this rise was coming.

30:38.530 --> 30:42.673
And so that's the problem with talking about all-cause mortality.

30:42.733 --> 30:45.796
If you don't calculate it correctly, you can make anything disappear.

30:46.316 --> 31:03.010
And they have essentially done a shell game with what they knew was gonna be an all-cause mortality rise for maybe a decade, and they've made it into a crisis by sweeping some of these people together with murder, and coincidentally avoids that bankruptcy, that problem with the budget,

31:03.630 --> 31:09.652
where these people, as they age out, that part of their life is the most expensive for the state.

31:11.153 --> 31:17.855
And people like Ted Turner were talking about this in the 80s already, about how we would never be able to afford all these old people when they finally retire.

31:24.237 --> 31:25.637
So that's why I play it like this.

31:25.677 --> 31:26.518
This is real.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.859
And it needs to be as evil as it can possibly sound.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.727
You, my lord.

31:55.669 --> 32:18.631
And so that's what I say about 2020 and why these people had to be out there with all these ideas, because they are seeding a narrative that allows this clock to keep moving, allows this script to keep moving, where again, one of the things that's going to happen in this script is America as a nation and as an idea is going to be destroyed by the people that own it.

32:20.233 --> 32:21.753
the people that are a part of it.

32:21.853 --> 32:27.155
Just like Rome was destroyed by Romans, this place is going to be lit by us.

32:27.215 --> 32:28.135
That's what they want.

32:28.835 --> 32:33.736
And ideally, we'll take each ourselves out as well, because again, there is an issue.

32:34.576 --> 32:35.397
What happened?

32:36.297 --> 32:38.917
What happened when America was established?

32:40.758 --> 32:45.559
People are able to joke all the time about the idea that Australia was founded by criminals.

32:48.012 --> 32:52.136
But people don't talk very much about what people found in America.

32:54.538 --> 33:06.568
It was pretty independent, hardcore people willing to get on a ship and risk their life to come to a place where they knew there would be people that didn't want them to be there and didn't speak their language and lived like savages.

33:07.349 --> 33:08.290
And they went anyway.

33:13.752 --> 33:20.300
And so you could imagine a scenario where actually America is enriched for very particular genotypes.

33:22.062 --> 33:28.810
Free-thinking, critically thinking, independent, free-willed genotypes.

33:32.756 --> 33:46.421
And then mixed in there are physical and mental capacities that were added to the population because of the weird results of slavery.

33:47.701 --> 33:49.081
You got to accept that as well.

33:51.582 --> 33:59.145
That's why Jimmy the Greek lost his job because he said, you know, one of the reasons why these black people in America tend to have a genetic disposition that's,

34:00.148 --> 34:11.740
pretty impressive from a physical muscle mass perspective is because they descend from people who, like it or not, were more or less bred that way.

34:12.921 --> 34:17.806
This is a very dark history that we need to come into stark realization of.

34:19.875 --> 34:39.128
because it's that same history that's now being twisted and contorted so that people like us will fight about it when we were all essentially enslaved by this same mythology and then pinned against each other with these not so well told American history tales.

34:42.770 --> 34:47.854
Where we actually escaped and broke away from the crown and all these other things.

34:49.229 --> 34:50.850
have free money in this stuff.

34:53.091 --> 35:02.175
And so this narrative is just part of a longer, much longer game, a multi-generational game.

35:02.235 --> 35:12.160
So when we look at it from the perspective of one year or five years, it's still a time, it's just a snap in the time that they are planning and scripting.

35:13.223 --> 35:19.587
And so yes, right now in the short timescale, we are kind of off of their script, off of their planned places.

35:20.047 --> 35:29.073
Maybe we've even slowed them down a little bit, but in the grand scheme of things, in the very large scheme of things, this cruise ship is still 100% on target.

35:29.593 --> 35:36.277
Because unless you're thinking in a multi-generational timeframe, you don't even see where the ship is going.

35:37.698 --> 35:40.059
And that's why Biology 101 with these books,

35:42.682 --> 36:07.601
And Peter Hotez leading us to Teilhard de Chardin is so important because these ideas have been developing across generations, which explains why the biological mythologies that I believe we've uncovered here at GigaOM Biological are so important to understand, because those mythologies are directly related to this vision.

36:11.161 --> 36:28.685
and its evolution in books like What is Life and Mind and Matter and Man and His Future, honed and sharpened by years of discussion and books like Survival of the Wisest.

36:33.598 --> 36:38.581
And so if you look at the short timescale, this is a very important thing to argue about.

36:38.601 --> 36:44.365
But if you pull back and try to look at the multi-generational timescale, there's something a lot more frightening here.

36:44.385 --> 36:47.327
And it's not depopulation, ladies and gentlemen, it's not.

36:49.689 --> 36:52.330
And it's not just experimentation either.

36:52.431 --> 36:53.851
It's much darker than that.

36:53.952 --> 36:57.214
I can see I've been shown

36:58.692 --> 37:06.160
Something popped into my head today that I need to get out right now before I even have a slide for it.

37:08.894 --> 37:19.343
And so yes, on a short timescale, the illusion of the plandemic was the idea that an endemic signal, whatever it was, could have been well characterized before the pandemic.

37:19.403 --> 37:32.154
And then using a strategic rollout of highly specific PCR tests, along with highly aspecific PCR tests, an entire tidal wave of confusion

37:33.306 --> 37:58.496
and seemingly high fidelity data or assumed to be high fidelity data could be used to take that expected population signal and murder to create an illusion of something that is going endemic when in fact it was always in the background because you can't tell the difference between endemicity and a background if you don't have any data from before 2020.

37:58.877 --> 37:59.857
You just simply can't.

38:01.434 --> 38:09.371
Nevermind that the 220 plus EUA products that were used to define the spread of this pathogen in 2020, 21 and 22 are all gone now.

38:12.844 --> 38:16.167
There's just no excuse to believe the story that they told us.

38:16.247 --> 38:39.006
And so yesterday I took you back to the Glenn Beck program and Robert Malone's appearance there nearly a year after he had come out on Brett Weinstein's podcast in 2021 and nearly two years after he had gotten that weird phone call in January 2020 that something crazy was happening in China and he should spin his team up.

38:40.583 --> 38:47.348
In this video, he talks about exosomes as if it's normal, but he's just, you know, realizing all this stuff now.

38:49.009 --> 38:50.190
And that's not what happened.

38:50.370 --> 39:01.157
What you're seeing here over the course of these years is Robert Malone keeping the ship going in the direction it is and keeping people from understanding what's actually happening.

39:03.019 --> 39:09.263
And that's why all of these questions, if we just were to boil it down and maybe this is a better way to write them.

39:10.267 --> 39:17.590
Those were questions that I originally proposed on the UK Doctors for Ethics presentation that I put up the other day.

39:17.610 --> 39:26.893
Why oh why won't anyone discuss how the background signal could be misconstrued as spread both genetic and the actuarial signal that we talked at the beginning today?

39:27.453 --> 39:33.737
Why won't they list and define the many ways the methodologies of PCR can be highly accurate but complete bullshit for the background signal?

39:34.197 --> 39:40.060
Why won't they define that even in its purest form these products would never have been appropriate for healthy humans?

39:40.581 --> 39:44.663
Why won't they define the transfections using the terms that were there before the pandemic?

39:45.203 --> 40:00.932
Why won't they use those terms transfection and transformation to explain how infectious clone is really just a misnomer or a semantic game that virologists play to hide the fact that most of virology is transfection and transformation in cell culture?

40:02.605 --> 40:07.050
And that's also, you know, why won't they acknowledge the statement that RNA cannot pandemic?

40:07.070 --> 40:16.100
Well, because if they did and acknowledge that that biology was present before the pandemic, then they would have to admit that they were either completely fooled, which would be great.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.682
You could just apologize for it.

40:19.724 --> 40:22.848
Or they would have to admit that they've been playing along all along.

40:23.868 --> 40:36.823
And that's why we have a video now of Steve Kirsch on the Stu Peters podcast saying that only in extremely rare cases like this one might it be justified to mandate a vaccine.

40:36.843 --> 40:39.786
And we've been telling people a long time not to get vaccinated.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.297
And that's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:43.337 --> 40:50.843
says he's not anti-vaccine, is because maybe in five years, there will be a time when we have safe vaccines.

40:50.883 --> 41:00.110
That's also why when Elon Musk sits down with Tucker Carlson, the big message is, is Elon saved free speech by buying Twitter.

41:00.511 --> 41:03.093
And then he goes on to say that smallpox killed a lot of people.

41:03.133 --> 41:07.857
People would be still dying from smallpox and polio if we didn't have smallpox and polio vaccines.

41:08.477 --> 41:12.699
almost as if he doesn't understand that nobody gets a smallpox vaccine anymore.

41:13.419 --> 41:18.962
It was a super bizarre statement that I'm sure no one else in the world is going to cue in on except for me.

41:20.422 --> 41:23.564
And now regulation is killing Americans and he knows how to fix it.

41:24.084 --> 41:35.929
Not that dissimilar to what Kevin McKernan was saying in 2020 on the Vance Crowe podcast, no less than three times, where he said the FDA and it's 10 pages of paperwork for an EUA was getting in the way of them solving this problem.

41:39.386 --> 41:49.651
And so this is you on X, and it's actually, I think it's actually X. I think it's possible that these, a lot of these people actually work for Elon.

41:51.271 --> 42:08.019
I think it's possible that Elon's billions of dollars, because that's a lot of money, is being, very small amounts of it, but very significant to these people, are being used to influence them, to put them on places, to get them to go farther, and maybe Peter Thiel's in on it too, because they're buddies, right?

42:09.056 --> 42:10.157
But that's what's happening.

42:10.197 --> 42:11.738
That's who all these people work for.

42:11.778 --> 42:12.999
They don't work for DOD.

42:13.059 --> 42:21.406
They don't work for the military industrial complex, unless you call working for Elon Musk, working for the military industrial complex, which isn't that far off.

42:22.847 --> 42:32.855
Because if these people are an integral part of how a social media platform can be used, militarized to control Americans, that would be extraordinary.

42:32.895 --> 42:38.139
Now, what I want you to imagine is that when you get off social media, when they turn off social media,

42:38.797 --> 42:39.957
what people are left with.

42:41.718 --> 42:45.539
And then flip that around and ask yourself, what are they left with?

42:46.480 --> 42:54.442
Because the moment they turn the internet off, they know the address of every person that is skeptical of the current narrative.

42:54.482 --> 43:05.386
They know the address of, the IP address of, the name of, the family members of, the close contacts of, the private message partners of all of the people

43:07.708 --> 43:09.850
who are skeptical of the state narrative.

43:11.592 --> 43:22.383
And so of course, the more you engage in social media, the more you tell them about your behavior, about your propensities, about your thoughts, about your potential for action.

43:25.226 --> 43:28.489
And so it started to dawn on me that, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

43:28.509 --> 43:29.490
What are we talking about here?

43:29.510 --> 43:31.012
We're talking about genetic testing.

43:32.022 --> 43:37.145
We're talking about wanting to figure out the genome of humans, right?

43:37.185 --> 43:38.306
That's what we're talking about.

43:38.366 --> 43:41.068
So how are they going to go about that?

43:41.208 --> 43:43.249
What would be the thing?

43:47.722 --> 43:52.326
Before I talk to you about this, I want to share a video that will clear your mind.

43:52.587 --> 43:57.792
And it is really designed to clear your mind because what I'm about to explain is dark.

43:58.052 --> 44:01.855
And I don't want you to think that I necessarily think it's happening.

44:04.898 --> 44:12.826
But I think it's something worth considering as an exercise because it is of vital importance that more people

44:14.022 --> 44:19.244
think on different time scales so that you can see different things.

44:21.365 --> 44:38.031
And I really want to challenge you, and it's so serendipitous that gene drives are the molecular biology subject matter that brought this all full circle for me, because I've known for a very long time that gene drives are important.

44:39.463 --> 44:50.071
And that there would be an important thing to understand but I didn't understand them as well as I do Now from the perspective of the bad guys or I imagine I do and so I want to share this with you.

44:50.111 --> 44:55.435
No more words This is a video just to clear your mind and then I'll be back after the video.

44:58.137 --> 45:02.060
I Might escape and start it again just to make sure it plays I

45:37.189 --> 45:37.571
Yeah.

45:47.049 --> 45:52.394
So that guy right there, if you can see my pointer, that guy right there is like a badass on the keyboard.

45:52.434 --> 45:55.536
That guy right there I think is the best keyboard player in Japan.

45:57.037 --> 46:00.560
Or one of the best keyboard players in Japan that's showing him how to use the reverb right now.

46:01.201 --> 46:05.184
And then that guy right there with the turban I think is also a super badass.

46:05.224 --> 46:07.106
I just don't remember his name off the top of my head.

46:07.766 --> 46:12.630
And they are at some kind of keyboard convention and this is the dude from

46:14.907 --> 46:16.708
Snarky puppy, I can't remember his name.

46:20.029 --> 46:22.830
Somebody will type it in the chat because somebody knows who this dude is.

46:23.391 --> 46:24.351
Corey Henry, thank you.

46:51.568 --> 46:55.390
He's playing with his feet too, in case you can't see it.

46:55.430 --> 46:58.191
He's playing the bass line with his feet.

47:23.789 --> 47:23.889
Hey.

49:08.767 --> 49:09.728
So let's do this.

49:11.830 --> 49:12.851
Did this work or not?

49:14.492 --> 49:15.353
It still didn't work.

49:15.493 --> 49:17.494
I don't understand why this is not working.

49:18.615 --> 49:20.497
Oh maybe this thing is broken.

49:21.920 --> 49:22.700
Cause that works.

49:22.720 --> 49:24.221
When I pull that out, it works.

49:24.321 --> 49:26.362
So this cord may just be shot.

49:26.462 --> 49:28.043
Let me see what's happening here.

49:30.324 --> 49:31.105
Like that works.

49:31.345 --> 49:33.066
So is there something loose here?

49:33.126 --> 49:33.486
What is it?

49:33.586 --> 49:33.846
Two?

49:34.846 --> 49:35.767
It's supposed to be two.

49:39.749 --> 49:41.950
I don't know why it's not, it's not working.

49:42.470 --> 49:45.392
Um, shoot.

49:45.812 --> 49:46.732
It's super annoying.

49:46.772 --> 49:49.074
I want to almost find another cord for it or something.

49:49.774 --> 49:49.854
Uh,

49:51.983 --> 50:18.957
I don't understand why you are not working But the this is on for sure it's on so This cord must be broken so I could go look for a cord right now But I won't because this is just darn it annoying But I I want to explain something from the perspective of genes and and

50:26.108 --> 50:49.943
How neuroscience it when I was in neuroscience how neuroscience was thinking about it and so Man it's really bogging bugging me that I can't write And I'm gonna I'm almost I'm almost gonna have to stop and fix it because I really need to have my paper here but

50:51.030 --> 51:12.709
The reason why I wanted to clear your mind there with that music is because I wanted you to think about a couple of things that we heard about before the pandemic and try to put them in perspective of how neuroscience has been moving forward and how they think about moving forward in neuroscience.

51:15.504 --> 51:15.924
Dang it!

51:16.084 --> 51:16.625
I need this.

51:16.785 --> 51:19.847
I need this, uh... Oh, I do have that long cord.

51:20.007 --> 51:20.888
I could use this one.

51:20.948 --> 51:22.028
Oh, let me see if that works.

51:22.048 --> 51:22.349
Hold on.

51:22.369 --> 51:25.511
Let me get this... off of here.

51:25.551 --> 51:28.533
I wish I could signal to my son and get him to come down here and help me.

51:28.853 --> 51:31.595
Verla, if you're watching, you can tell Kiri to come down here and help me.

51:32.536 --> 51:35.878
Um... I just have to get this cord off of here.

51:35.938 --> 51:36.718
I think that'll work.

51:37.159 --> 51:38.279
This cord might already work.

51:38.359 --> 51:41.021
Oh no, that's the camera cord, so then this cord will work.

51:42.562 --> 51:43.463
Yeah, this is the one.

51:44.730 --> 51:45.690
Okay, this one might work.

51:45.870 --> 51:46.250
Let's see.

51:46.971 --> 51:48.771
Because I think this is also a little one, right?

51:48.871 --> 51:50.512
This is also a little HDMI.

51:51.612 --> 51:52.572
Yes, it is.

51:52.872 --> 51:53.432
I think it is.

51:53.712 --> 51:53.893
Yeah.

51:54.113 --> 51:54.893
Okay, so let's see.

51:54.933 --> 51:56.233
Maybe this is gonna work already.

51:56.293 --> 51:58.954
I have another long cord here that's hooked up to camera.

51:59.954 --> 52:00.774
What one is this one?

52:00.974 --> 52:02.715
Three, two, something.

52:03.375 --> 52:04.195
It's another camera.

52:04.475 --> 52:05.136
I think it'll work.

52:05.596 --> 52:05.976
Let's see.

52:07.116 --> 52:08.737
I just I gotta remember which one this is.

52:08.757 --> 52:09.797
Is this two on the main?

52:12.827 --> 52:13.467
Is that the right?

52:13.887 --> 52:15.908
Yes, that's the right chord.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.589
Because this is really for the outside camera.

52:19.909 --> 52:20.810
So that would be 2.

52:22.190 --> 52:22.990
Is it coming on?

52:26.611 --> 52:28.012
Alright, I think it's coming on.

52:34.834 --> 52:35.074
Where's 2?

52:36.375 --> 52:36.915
Camera 2.

52:37.055 --> 52:37.495
Oh no, this 2.

52:40.523 --> 52:41.003
There it is.

52:41.023 --> 52:42.845
Yeah, I don't need it anymore, honey.

52:42.905 --> 52:43.525
I figured it out.

52:43.545 --> 52:44.486
Thank you for running down.

52:45.627 --> 52:46.348
It worked already.

52:47.469 --> 52:48.930
Um, and then I can put myself here.

52:49.050 --> 52:49.390
Yes.

52:49.731 --> 52:50.211
Okay.

52:50.331 --> 52:52.533
So here, I'm sorry for that delay.

52:52.573 --> 52:54.474
So here's the little notes that I was taking.

52:55.375 --> 53:00.459
Um, and what I'm trying to do is give you an idea of what, okay.

53:00.479 --> 53:01.120
That's what I want to do.

53:01.240 --> 53:01.460
Okay.

53:01.620 --> 53:04.803
This is, I'm all working this out on, on, you know, live here.

53:06.229 --> 53:09.770
Because it's an idea that I think is really worth trying to work out.

53:10.030 --> 53:12.591
And if we don't work it out today, then we'll work it out tomorrow.

53:12.611 --> 53:14.512
We'll work it out tonight, work it out this afternoon.

53:14.552 --> 53:16.072
So the idea is time scales.

53:20.334 --> 53:21.534
And running out the clock.

53:26.815 --> 53:40.342
So Mark and I have had the feeling that they have been running out the clock, but we haven't, I don't think any of us understand what clock they're looking at or what clock is running or what the script is that they're running out or what this is really going on.

53:40.382 --> 53:50.847
But part of it has to do with what social media does and what TV does and what the mainstream media does with regard to our ability to think on longer timescales.

53:52.028 --> 54:05.695
Because while these people have been playing multi-generational timescales, media and social media makes us play hourly timescales, daily timescales, tomorrow's timescale, this week in Washington timescales.

54:06.856 --> 54:18.241
And so if we continue to think exclusively throughout the day on those timescales alone, then we will continue to do things like argue about, so what do I need to do here?

54:18.282 --> 54:20.823
I need to switch to that one.

54:22.085 --> 54:24.286
And then that one should be, yeah, okay.

54:25.646 --> 54:32.288
We need to think on timescales like this one, where we're thinking about endemicity and the background.

54:33.028 --> 54:35.729
And so we would want to think on timescales like this, right?

54:35.889 --> 54:45.832
We would want to think on timescales of four or five or 10 years, and then still, still we're not thinking on the timescale of a generation, not even close.

54:47.523 --> 54:56.185
And so even this book about the fourth turning or something like that, even this is just approaching that correct timescale.

54:58.485 --> 55:03.486
But what's interesting is the gene drives are also on that multi-generational timescale.

55:04.806 --> 55:13.588
And when Kevin Esvelt is talking about gene drives, he's always talking about getting rid of mosquitoes or getting rid of this or changing that.

55:15.319 --> 55:18.440
but it doesn't really have any implications for us.

55:18.540 --> 55:24.181
And we're not really thinking about what it might be used for us because we don't think on those timescales.

55:24.281 --> 55:32.483
Now, at the same time, what I want you to play with here in your head is, no, that's not what I want to do.

55:32.503 --> 55:33.363
I want to do this one.

55:33.903 --> 55:35.483
And so then I can leave this one on, right?

55:35.804 --> 55:37.744
No, this one, it's gotta be this one.

55:38.860 --> 55:39.641
So I'll figure that out.

55:39.661 --> 55:44.303
I can switch that chord to the other one, and then this will work the way I expect it to.

55:44.363 --> 55:49.347
So running out the clock and timescales are the theme of this discussion.

55:49.407 --> 55:55.070
And now what I want you to see is what the Human Genome Project did with regard to timescales.

55:55.190 --> 56:07.498
Because what the Human Genome Project did with regard to timescales was, number one, it identified a bunch of single nucleotide polymorphisms, meaning that it identified

56:08.940 --> 56:16.586
relatively conserved regions of the genome where single nucleotide changes were identifiable.

56:18.888 --> 56:22.951
And it's not really clear to me exactly how these these

56:24.602 --> 56:28.663
small nucleotide or single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified.

56:29.243 --> 56:39.625
But these were considered sort of the first anchor to solving any kind of genetic problem with regard to the human genome project, right?

56:39.665 --> 56:46.346
This is human genome project.

56:47.807 --> 56:49.747
Oh, I don't have this pen open, so it's not running.

56:58.919 --> 56:59.820
Come on, girl, run.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.821
There we go.

57:02.762 --> 57:08.366
So the Human Genome Project identified single nucleotide polymorphisms.

57:08.947 --> 57:14.851
And these were supposed to be changes in conserved regions that they thought, wow, look at this, this is cool.

57:14.911 --> 57:25.179
Now, what you need to understand is that that was a tiny, tiny fractional signal of the genome that was only attainable in places that are highly conserved across the samples that they sequenced.

57:25.239 --> 57:26.500
And so like

57:27.461 --> 57:32.264
a rudimentary map of a generic national park.

57:32.764 --> 57:42.870
If you drew a map of a national park and you said, oh, here's my map, and you said that there's an entrance and there's an exit, well, yeah, I mean, that's a map.

57:44.662 --> 57:48.243
It's not a very complicated map, but it's a map of a national park.

57:48.303 --> 57:50.684
It's not a very specific national park map.

57:50.724 --> 57:56.927
It's not going to be useful if you say, take this map to Yellowstone and try to find your way around, but it is a map.

57:57.387 --> 58:00.788
And you can claim that you have made a general map of national parks.

58:00.808 --> 58:04.750
You could even add a ranger station and you could add trail heads.

58:05.170 --> 58:07.811
And then you could say, yeah, every national park has these things.

58:09.131 --> 58:13.213
And we looked at two national parks and they seem to have different, slightly different trail heads.

58:16.072 --> 58:35.808
And I know this is a very inept analogy or a very inadequate analogy, but it is intended to let you see that this proclamation that we've identified about 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms implied that the rest of the signal was relatively homologous and relatively homogenous.

58:35.888 --> 58:41.433
But instead, we found these single nucleotide polymorphisms that are interesting.

58:42.878 --> 58:46.000
And so it implies a level of fidelity that wasn't there.

58:46.100 --> 58:59.370
And instead, what it was, was saying that there were about 1000 places in the genome that were very highly conserved that we could identify relative to a larger background that we haven't even touched yet.

59:00.498 --> 59:09.304
And in that, there are about, we've identified some single nucleotide changes, which is interesting because why?

59:09.884 --> 59:19.591
Not because of the single nucleotide polymorphisms, but because the genes that those are identifiable in are so conserved.

59:22.513 --> 59:24.054
Do you see what I'm trying to say there?

59:25.034 --> 59:30.038
If you took 10 genomes that are billions of base pairs long,

59:31.826 --> 59:44.836
and were able to identify small nucleotide polymorphisms in single genes, and you identified about 1,000 of them, what you would be identifying is 1,000 ticks on these lines.

59:45.116 --> 59:45.497
That's it.

59:46.397 --> 59:50.420
Nothing more, nothing more high fidelity than that.

59:50.500 --> 59:53.423
And those ticks would represent about a million bases.

59:56.516 --> 59:58.817
inside of which there's a conserved region.

59:58.857 --> 01:00:07.101
And that conserved region was highly conserved, conserved enough so that when they amplified it, they could see a single nucleotide polymorphism.

01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:14.724
And what they used this observation to imply was that the rest of the genome could be probed and studied.

01:00:14.924 --> 01:00:20.867
And furthermore, these changes would always be single nucleotide polymorphisms.

01:00:21.795 --> 01:00:28.659
It suggests that single nucleotide changes could have gigantic effects on our pattern integrity.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:34.222
And to a certain extent, for these limited number of examples, that may actually be true.

01:00:35.343 --> 01:00:43.067
Just like the fainting goats are goats that have a very particular modified or missing potassium channel.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:44.348
I don't even know what it is anymore.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:55.156
And so a single gene change can result in what appears to be a very obvious phenotypical change in the animal.

01:00:57.734 --> 01:01:20.937
and the gross overgeneralization that is biologically pulled over, mythologically pulled over our eyes in 101 biology, is that these single nucleotide polymorphisms and our ability to occasionally tie one to a childhood disease or one to a birth defect or associate five of these with people who get Alzheimer's earlier than other people,

01:01:21.918 --> 01:01:30.882
does not indicate a high fidelity understanding of what this whole code is coding for.

01:01:31.683 --> 01:01:39.106
Which, as we heard from the other day, is coding for both the architecture and the assembly.

01:01:41.007 --> 01:01:42.908
It's more than just proteins.

01:01:42.968 --> 01:01:50.212
It's also how they work together and how they get assembled together and all of these things that we have no hope of translating.

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:53.249
at least no hope from where we stand right now.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:02:07.052
And so to imply that we have sequenced the genome and understand the genome and understood it already a while ago when we published the Nature paper with Mark Lander's name and Kevin McKernan's name on it, which is what they imply all the time, is wrong.

01:02:07.112 --> 01:02:20.714
The only thing the Human Genome Project made very cheap and easy was to sequence 3,000 bases at a time or so and made it very, very much cheaper to manufacture synthetic pure DNA and synthetic pure RNA.

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:30.067
And so now what I want to get to is this single nucleotide polymorphisms and neuroscience.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:44.271
Because single nucleotide polymorphisms that should happen to produce or be associated highly, like for example, let's say, you can look it up and teach me what it is.

01:02:47.842 --> 01:02:58.546
Angelman's disease is a disease that is associated with a particular change in some genes and when kids have these altered

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:07.514
genes, they come into these, you know, altered states of, of cognitive ability and all kinds of other things happen.

01:03:07.554 --> 01:03:13.759
And Angelman's disease is studied as a window into autism.

01:03:13.899 --> 01:03:14.219
Why?

01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:17.722
Because autism has all of these symptoms.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:22.725
And Angelman's disease has some symptoms that people can say overlap with it.

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:26.308
And the bonus is, is that Angelman's can be blamed on a gene.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.281
think it's only one gene.

01:03:30.882 --> 01:03:50.016
And so if Angelman can be blamed on a gene, then the rationale of the Human Genome Project is, is that by doing you the favor of identifying this gene, we have enabled you to use this as an anchor to study the manifestation of something very big that people call autism.

01:03:51.226 --> 01:04:02.297
And so now we're spending money on autism and we're solving Alzheimer's, but really what we're doing is spending money studying particular genes under the pretense that they're related to these things.

01:04:03.889 --> 01:04:05.531
just throw a thing out there.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:11.976
You've heard everybody, we've spent billions of dollars on Alzheimer's disease and looking for genes that are involved in Alzheimer's.

01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:26.990
Would it surprise you or scare you or terrify you that any of the genes that are involved in Alzheimer's disease could also be involved in extremely high memory capability, could be involved in extremely high intelligence capability?

01:04:29.318 --> 01:04:34.382
And so if they tell the NIH to study a list of genes, we don't have to know why.

01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:54.396
And we could think we're studying it to prevent Alzheimer's disease or to combat the genetic causes of autism, when in reality, we're doing the work of DARPA or DITRA or the DOD or the executive branch or the NGOs that want to understand how this gene plays a role in advanced intelligence or memory formation and maintenance.

01:04:57.679 --> 01:05:01.762
And so the cool thing that I realized this morning was the timescale thing.

01:05:02.222 --> 01:05:06.426
If you want to study anything in the brain, this model is a trick.

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:17.474
Because in reality, all of the things that you want to study in the brain and understand in the brain are insurmountable, combinatorial,

01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:28.615
It's an irreducible complexity of genes and behavior and experience that is the culmination of us as humans.

01:05:29.435 --> 01:05:35.658
And so of all the genes to study, of all the places to put your resources, where are you going to put them?

01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:43.342
People have been thinking that and hyping the idea that they're trying to extend life and find longevity.

01:05:43.362 --> 01:05:44.343
Well, how are they going to do that?

01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:47.204
They're going to do it by finding the genes that are associated with it.

01:05:48.899 --> 01:05:50.620
They're not going to do it by making drugs.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.521
They're not going to do it by transfecting you.

01:05:55.642 --> 01:06:06.526
They're going to find the genes of it, and then they're going to put those genes in the people that they want to have those genes and kill the people that they want that have those genes they don't want reproducing.

01:06:08.947 --> 01:06:14.069
In other words, I started thinking like a dog breeder today, but then about humans.

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:38.007
Like if I was in the ruling class and I was in on these meetings and I was thinking about how to breed future generations of humans to get where we want to go, I would guess it's not that far off from having a ruling elite with all the good genes and a working slave class.

01:06:39.775 --> 01:06:47.993
that could be used for experiments or for doing stuff or whatever, at the end, you know, when they finally get there, that would be the result.

01:06:50.302 --> 01:07:07.313
And what are we doing right now, which has really creeped me out the most, is that we're segregating ourselves right now on social media into free-thinking people, into people that want to try and save the world, with people that want to try and save their communities, lead in their communities.

01:07:07.373 --> 01:07:15.178
And so social media is helping our rulers to identify the people with genetic propensities to act.

01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:16.980
And how will they identify it?

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.641
Well, if it passes on to your kids,

01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:20.532
It might have been genetic.

01:07:22.073 --> 01:07:28.840
If it doesn't pass on to your kids and your kids acquiesce to social media and jump in, then maybe there are no special genes in your family.

01:07:31.643 --> 01:07:39.851
Now, I'm not saying that there are genes that are responsible for my behavior and that's it or, you know, that I'm suggesting what they think.

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:48.141
And so if you were gonna use the population of humans on earth for something useful, what would you use it for?

01:07:48.721 --> 01:07:53.845
Would you put all the Alzheimer's people in a place and use them as an experiment to try and get rid of Alzheimer's?

01:07:54.625 --> 01:08:08.496
Or would you use a military program like Twitter to put all of the dissident people in one group and all of the conformists in another group and make sure that these two never meet

01:08:09.679 --> 01:08:18.786
and yet make sure that these people feel like they're really doing a lot as they run around in their hamster wheel and all the while, you can watch these people's kids.

01:08:20.868 --> 01:08:31.456
And in one generation, you can identify with the genotypes of those kids, genes that seem to correlate with parents who were dissidents and kids who were dissidents.

01:08:33.598 --> 01:08:35.459
How the hell else are you going to get those genes?

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.241
You can't do that experiment in animals.

01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:47.746
And so if you were planning to use the human population for genetic experiments, which would benefit future generations of humans.

01:08:48.985 --> 01:09:00.655
then you're going to need to separate those humans into useful populations that exhibit the genotypes and the phenotypes, because you can't do genotypes yet, the phenotypes that you want to select for.

01:09:00.775 --> 01:09:07.901
Not that dissimilar to if you were running a fox farm for fur and you wanted to get rid of all the biting foxes.

01:09:07.941 --> 01:09:11.564
Well, the easy way to do it would be not to let any of those biting foxes breed.

01:09:11.964 --> 01:09:15.067
And in a couple generations, you don't have any biting foxes anymore.

01:09:16.584 --> 01:09:34.828
And so if you were using social media for something that would benefit the governance of future generations, you would use it to identify the biting foxes and to track the offspring of those biting foxes and to make sure that in a couple generations, there were no more biting foxes in your generation, in your population.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:40.590
And at the same time, you'd get the benefit of finding the genetic basis for biting foxes.

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:45.931
That's why I had to play the music because

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:50.028
You gotta clear your mind before you can think this darkly.

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:53.111
But I do think that they think this darkly.

01:09:55.771 --> 01:10:13.735
And so it's, you know, that is weird and it's scary, but it also explains why we might be where we are, where they're fine with us talking about depopulation because it's not about depopulation.

01:10:13.775 --> 01:10:18.116
This is about using the population to identify genes that matter.

01:10:20.874 --> 01:10:23.035
And what genes that matter would they be worried about?

01:10:23.055 --> 01:10:26.296
They're not going to be worried about Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

01:10:26.736 --> 01:10:29.337
That's what they say, but that's no way.

01:10:30.377 --> 01:10:43.261
You've all seen that video where they were talking about the VMAT gene or the VGAT gene, some glutamate receptor in the brain that is especially enriched in people that are fanatics in religion.

01:10:46.789 --> 01:10:54.258
Don't you think that that data is almost exclusively available to people that engage very vigorously in X?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.343
Or moved from X to Telegram?

01:11:01.326 --> 01:11:05.711
Or moved to Locals and are active there or on Discord there?

01:11:06.612 --> 01:11:06.973
Active?

01:11:08.257 --> 01:11:12.581
We are giving them information about our phenotype and how we think.

01:11:13.161 --> 01:11:23.530
Remember that these people, these people told us that like fish swim in the sea in schools, men swim in conscious thought in groups.

01:11:27.173 --> 01:11:36.401
And so by showing them what groups we want to swim in and what ways that we swim, what thoughts we swim in, what we choose to put in our garden, we are,

01:11:37.248 --> 01:11:44.350
In a way, if you think of their biology revealing a genetic propensity to rebel.

01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:47.951
The genetics of heroes.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.392
The genetics of patriots.

01:11:51.612 --> 01:11:54.053
Versus the genetics of compliance.

01:11:56.053 --> 01:11:58.834
The genetics of weakness.

01:12:01.615 --> 01:12:04.015
The genetics of drones.

01:12:04.676 --> 01:12:06.196
The genetics of conformists.

01:12:08.479 --> 01:12:12.463
And make no uncertain, I mean, don't misunderstand me.

01:12:12.523 --> 01:12:21.913
I believe that that is very possibly what's going on right now in the guise of public health and pandemics and climate change in the Middle East.

01:12:23.595 --> 01:12:28.876
This is a multi-generational narrative that the details of don't really matter that much.

01:12:29.076 --> 01:12:30.177
For the short term, they do.

01:12:30.677 --> 01:12:39.059
For allowing people to briefly see outside of the blocked train window to the reality of where we're going, yes, it's useful for that.

01:12:40.419 --> 01:12:41.899
But it doesn't get you off the train.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.480
And the only way we get off the train is multi-generationally.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.761
We need to raise children that understand this.

01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:58.176
We need to raise children that understand it well enough so that they can speak it to their peers and resist it.

01:12:59.818 --> 01:13:00.818
That's how we do this.

01:13:01.539 --> 01:13:09.084
We have to turn the chaos that they necessarily have to create in order to get where they want to go, where nation states don't matter anymore.

01:13:09.565 --> 01:13:13.888
That chaos is the same door through which we can walk our free grandchildren.

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:17.989
It's not going to be pretty.

01:13:18.049 --> 01:13:19.109
It's not going to be easy.

01:13:19.169 --> 01:13:20.570
It's going to require patience.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.351
And it's also going to require stamina.

01:13:24.052 --> 01:13:25.052
It's going to require faith.

01:13:30.555 --> 01:13:38.880
But it hasn't been clear to me, as it is now, how important it is for us to think on their time scale.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.761
And that's why gene drives are so important.

01:13:40.781 --> 01:13:46.044
Because if you were exposed to a gene drive,

01:13:46.952 --> 01:14:07.968
and it changed your gametes, or if it changed some cells in your body, unless it had a physical manifestation in the form of disease or suffering, you would never actually know that you were altered by a gene drive and that your kids might inherit that alteration.

01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:16.094
And inheriting an alteration that only has effect during development, well, that's a very interesting thing, right?

01:14:17.779 --> 01:14:25.843
And so gene drives are of course very scary from the perspective of their application to an ecosystem, of the removal of an insect species.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:28.264
Oh my goodness, the birds might not have anything to eat.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.406
And that's what I thought we had to be concerned about.

01:14:32.226 --> 01:14:42.011
The changing of crops, the changing of wild populations, the spread of a gene drive in places that they didn't expect it to or unknown consequences.

01:14:42.051 --> 01:14:46.573
But I want you to think much more malevolently about that.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:15:06.985
I want you to think about the fact that while they have us chasing around the idea that gene drives released in the world, just like gain-of-function viruses released in the world, might be worse than nuclear weapons, which is the title of that video that we were going to watch with this program here.

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:15.627
So I'll escape from this and put that video on.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.943
And we're gonna watch it yesterday, which was this video here.

01:15:22.963 --> 01:15:26.446
Escape, no, it was this.

01:15:26.466 --> 01:15:30.908
This is not a very well-produced show, but it's definitely live.

01:15:32.009 --> 01:15:33.510
It's definitely live.

01:15:41.634 --> 01:15:44.016
So a Gene Drive is basically CRISPR

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:53.415
that can, it's like CRISPR, but then encoded.

01:15:54.176 --> 01:15:56.418
So you put a CRISPR into your genome.

01:15:57.631 --> 01:16:03.575
And then once it's in your genome, it can use itself to write over whatever is there.

01:16:03.636 --> 01:16:07.358
So, it becomes a very hyper-dominant gene.

01:16:07.578 --> 01:16:13.043
That's the best way to describe it, because we have a diploid genome, we have two copies of every gene.

01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:18.507
And so, in theory, you can use a gene drive to not only write over one copy, because that's how CRISPR would work,

01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:26.835
but you're encoding the CRISPR into it so that after it's in your genome, it also automatically writes over the other one.

01:16:26.855 --> 01:16:28.497
And we'll let him explain it.

01:16:28.577 --> 01:16:32.582
That's what Kevin Esfeldt explains in this video that has less than 300 views on YouTube.

01:16:35.834 --> 01:17:01.629
Now, he's gonna talk about screw worms and he's gonna talk about all these ecological uses for it and how it might be used and why it's very scary, but he's not gonna talk about the possibility that it could be used to knock out a gene that would remove anybody's desire to be independent or critically think or believe in God or whatever other gene they say they've identified as a problem.

01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:21.279
to create a population of people that's no longer capable of rebelling, that doesn't have the biological basis for which to form the thoughts and the behavior that they want out.

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:29.707
Again, I'm just improvising here, trying to work through these thoughts with you.

01:17:29.727 --> 01:17:31.548
I don't have it all worked out.

01:17:31.608 --> 01:17:53.719
But I do know that when you think on those timescales, and you think malevolently, as they might have thought at their table, then if you have the choice of spending all of your resources, and you can only identify a couple genes, you can only focus on a couple things, then we probably would want to focus on free thinking, we'd probably want to focus on intelligence, we'd probably want to focus on longevity.

01:17:55.950 --> 01:18:19.197
And so they get us running around talking about how AI is a problem, or people are going to upload their consciousness to a computer, or that gain-of-function viruses are way more dangerous than a nuclear bomb, instead of talking about how these people might be manipulating us so that we would segregate ourselves into populations based on the way we think.

01:18:21.007 --> 01:18:29.558
And once we segregated ourselves based on the way that we think, it would be possible for them to do experiments on us or to read our genomes in that way.

01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:34.044
It's never dawned on me before that my genome could actually be useful to them.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:34.605
And why?

01:18:35.045 --> 01:18:35.926
Until this morning.

01:18:36.767 --> 01:18:43.688
I have been telling you up until now, and this just came into my head immediately, that our genomes aren't important, that they're after our kids.

01:18:44.109 --> 01:18:45.569
But that's not entirely true.

01:18:45.989 --> 01:18:53.911
Because what we have done, what my wife and I have done, what Mark and his wife have done, is identified themselves as people that are willing to stand up.

01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:58.672
That means that any of their progeny might inherit the genetic propensity to stand up.

01:19:03.273 --> 01:19:04.973
Knocked my microphone off the stand here.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:22.653
And so that's a really important thing to see because then our genetics are useful because before we die, they need my genes so that when they're screening my kids, they can see whether their behavior correlates with anything that came with their inheritance.

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:25.496
And if they had enough of us,

01:19:27.415 --> 01:19:35.988
have identified and can keep track of our kid's genome, then they can actually identify the genes that are likely to underlie this stuff.

01:19:36.008 --> 01:19:37.971
And then they can play around with knocking them out.

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:58.624
Now, I know that almost seems like a comic book level of application of this biology, but I think it's a much more plausible application of this biology than any gain-of-function RNA with furin cleavage sites or any bioweapon that's made of a spike protein that was designed to hurt people.

01:20:02.007 --> 01:20:06.210
They need to identify the genes that are

01:20:07.372 --> 01:20:12.655
problematic before they can ever use a gene drive to manipulate the human population.

01:20:12.695 --> 01:20:14.856
We already know that a gene drive could do it.

01:20:15.276 --> 01:20:19.258
We already know that Kevin Esvelt understands that they could do it, and that's crazy.

01:20:20.119 --> 01:20:25.181
But nobody's going to do that until they know what genes are the problem.

01:20:27.562 --> 01:20:32.365
We are several steps away from their goal, but there are lots of increments here.

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:44.804
And even though they are lying about their fidelity of understanding, they lie about their fidelity of understanding with an underlying background plan of how to surmount or solve those problems.

01:20:46.866 --> 01:20:52.954
And if you want to study the human genome, then you need human populations in useful groups.

01:20:55.066 --> 01:21:04.289
And the useful grouping is not the phenotype on the outside, like Chinese and Indian or black or American or white or Caucasian.

01:21:04.309 --> 01:21:08.590
Those are completely useless genotypes.

01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:22.814
Unless those genotypes segregate inseparably from the things that they're really interested in, like longevity, intelligence, strength, immune system, I don't know.

01:21:24.773 --> 01:21:31.297
Think on the scale and think about how these people would be thinking already back from these people, right?

01:21:31.337 --> 01:21:32.037
That's the point.

01:21:32.938 --> 01:21:37.601
They were already thinking that way in the 30s and the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and the 70s.

01:21:37.641 --> 01:21:38.541
And so now we're here.

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:49.868
How can we separate the human population into useful groups based on phenotypes that actually matter without them knowing that we're doing it?

01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:53.190
I think the answer is social media.

01:21:55.481 --> 01:22:12.520
I think by actively participating in social media, we are giving them an unfathomable amount of information about what we think and how we think and our cognitive capability and our propensity to rebel.

01:22:13.806 --> 01:22:33.437
And if there is a genetic basis for it, the way for them to find that, the way for them to find the genes for conformity or for a useful slave, a willing slave, would be to segregate the population into groups that behave the way that they want them to behave and then screen those populations for the genes that correlate highest with them.

01:22:38.772 --> 01:22:44.263
And so it is a lot more malevolent than I ever imagined if I imagined what I imagined this morning.

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:48.893
They need us to beg for X.

01:22:50.128 --> 01:23:12.464
They want us to think that Kamala Harris is going to censor X, and so we have to vote for Trump so that X becomes the default free speech, you know, town hall, Main Street America, where everybody gets to yell and scream whatever they want, so that again, everybody can yell and scream into their own private bucket and get an own private echo programmed by them.

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:26.623
so that you feel like you're engaging in useful resistance when really all you are is giving them more and more details exactly how you think, how intelligent you are, and who's connected to you, and how you are able to organize or not organize a network.

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:29.864
And then they can watch our children.

01:23:33.045 --> 01:23:39.146
And by two generations, they will have this fox farm and the genes that they need to breed out identified.

01:23:43.922 --> 01:23:45.622
and they can get rid of them with a gene drive.

01:23:47.863 --> 01:23:56.325
The creepy thing is, is that if it's a gene that doesn't, that isn't present in some of those populations, then the gene drive only needs to apply to the population that has the gene.

01:23:57.685 --> 01:23:59.585
It might be harmless to the people that don't.

01:24:04.346 --> 01:24:08.007
So let's watch Kevin Esvelt and see if he can, if he can, if he can

01:24:09.386 --> 01:24:10.487
I hope X is dead.

01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:11.627
I hope no one uses it.

01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:17.049
That would be a wonderful place for us to be if X is dead.

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:18.230
I think that would be great.

01:24:23.512 --> 01:24:24.113
Wow, I don't know.

01:24:24.173 --> 01:24:26.494
Can anybody in the chat give me a little feedback?

01:24:26.514 --> 01:24:30.616
Did I make any salient points here with this discussion about timescales?

01:24:30.936 --> 01:24:35.098
I'm still trying to understand whether I did anything useful there or not.

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:47.888
I think this is the one.

01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:50.532
Is this the one we, did I turn it on already yesterday?

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:59.043
Oh yeah, this is the three hour one.

01:25:16.826 --> 01:25:38.680
Now, perhaps the first thing to see here is that in the interview, there's no way in God's green earth that this interviewee, the guy who's doing the interviewing, no, sorry, the interviewer, not the interviewee, the interviewer doesn't understand Kevin's answers and is probably not a sophisticated enough biologist to really grasp what Kevin is talking about.

01:25:38.761 --> 01:25:41.903
And it feels a lot like Kevin understands that, but

01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:47.227
Let's just watch this and again, realize that this is on YouTube and it's got less than 300 views.

01:25:47.247 --> 01:25:48.368
So you can definitely find it.

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:52.872
And he's just going to explain what gene drives are here.

01:25:52.892 --> 01:25:55.874
I'm going to get a little smaller, I think.

01:25:58.637 --> 01:25:59.938
Welcome to the Zapiens podcast.

01:26:00.258 --> 01:26:00.959
I'm Lloyd Waitz.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:08.225
Today, I'll be interviewing Professor Kevin Esvelt, who leads the Sculpting Evolution Group at the MIT Media Lab.

01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:11.130
What was the title of his group?

01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:13.511
The Sculpting Evolution Group.

01:26:13.591 --> 01:26:16.813
Now, that's no different than what these people talk about.

01:26:16.853 --> 01:26:25.838
Sculpting the evolution of a species, sculpting the evolution of our species, and using all the tools, all the tools that God gave us, right?

01:26:27.299 --> 01:26:38.325
Being most famous for the development of the CRISPR-based gene drive, Professor Asfeld is also a very passionate and vocal speaker about preventing existential risks, such as pandemics.

01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:43.560
A lot of his thinking has been very inspirational to a lot of the conversation that I've had on this podcast.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.641
So I'm very happy to have him on today and interview him in detail.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:48.481
Thank you.

01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:50.242
Delighted to be here.

01:26:50.562 --> 01:26:50.742
Yeah.

01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:54.383
So just for starters, I'm familiar with some of your work.

01:26:54.403 --> 01:26:59.745
But if you could just give a broad overview for anyone who's watching, what you work on and what your interests are.

01:27:00.105 --> 01:27:00.325
Sure.

01:27:00.345 --> 01:27:01.166
So I'm Kevin Esvelt.

01:27:01.446 --> 01:27:04.087
I run the Sculpting Evolution Group at the MIT Media Lab.

01:27:04.807 --> 01:27:07.148
And we focus on advancing biotechnology safely.

01:27:08.075 --> 01:27:15.637
So that includes ways of harnessing evolution to create new molecular tools and platforms to catalyze the work of others.

01:27:16.737 --> 01:27:18.897
It includes developing technologies to change.

01:27:19.117 --> 01:27:22.078
Platforms that catalyze the works of others.

01:27:22.698 --> 01:27:28.079
You could say enables terrorists, you know, like, I mean, that's pretty funny.

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.401
Enables the works of others, you know, like eugenicists and people who, wow.

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:34.581
Into the shared environment.

01:27:36.072 --> 01:27:48.976
to solve ecological problems using nature's tools, and especially includes doing that in ways that are going to ensure that the technologies have the greatest likelihood of winning popular support.

01:27:50.376 --> 01:28:02.840
And the way to do that is to ensure that they're as safe as possible, which involves going to people early on and saying, hey, we think we might be able to address this problem that we've heard you have any of these different technical ways.

01:28:03.959 --> 01:28:05.260
Are you interested in any of them?

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.621
And if so, which ones?

01:28:08.062 --> 01:28:19.990
And that's just very different from the typical way technology gets developed, where we are too afraid of being scooped to even tell anyone what we're doing until we have the thing basically done, at which point it's really too late for anyone else to weigh in.

01:28:21.894 --> 01:28:32.682
And that's a bit of a problem because... So I think one of the first things to see is that one of his standard schticks is that he wants you to believe that he's very interested in safety.

01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:44.190
And that one of the reasons why he's so open about all these tricks and all these methodologies is because he wants everybody to understand so that everybody knows and so that we are very open about it.

01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:47.112
And that's an irrelevant debate.

01:28:49.738 --> 01:29:11.272
It's a very irrelevant debate because the technology that he's talking about and its application to the irreducible complexity of our ecosystem or just the irreducible complexity of a single human is already very easy to understand as morally and ethically incorrect and arrogant and wrong.

01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:23.088
because we don't understand those systems at either size scale and in either time scale to usefully augment them using a gene drive, even if it does on what it says on the tin plus some extra.

01:29:24.729 --> 01:29:38.898
And so talking about it in this way and thinking about it in this way, he frames it as, as long as we're open and honest about everything, then everybody won't be scared of something that they shouldn't ever be thinking about using anyway, which is not what he's going to say.

01:29:40.097 --> 01:29:53.489
We shouldn't be thinking about genetically altering wild species or eliminating them using bacterial genetics that we don't really understand how might affect a eukaryotic genome over generations.

01:29:53.529 --> 01:29:54.550
We shouldn't be doing that.

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:55.751
We shouldn't be playing with that.

01:29:56.251 --> 01:30:02.677
Even if those, those tools are in theory available to us, it's probably not things that we need to do.

01:30:03.137 --> 01:30:06.180
His argument will be that if I don't do it, someone else is going to do it.

01:30:09.124 --> 01:30:10.485
But I don't think that's even true.

01:30:13.067 --> 01:30:25.818
If I was offered a lab to do whatever I want, I would probably at this point either study dogs or I would study squirrels because I think the way that squirrels navigate around my backyard really indicates that they get stuck in little ruts.

01:30:27.284 --> 01:30:36.610
Like they take the same fence to the same branch to the same ground, and then they jump over there and hide there for a second, and then they run under the fireplace, and then they go up this way.

01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:42.314
And if you interrupt that with a chair, they almost can't find their way to the chicken food anymore.

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:48.698
And so for me, as a neuroscientist, that really says that whatever mapping is going on in their brain is really, really hard.

01:30:49.299 --> 01:30:52.181
And so they really rely on this memory of the map.

01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:56.403
And if the map gets interrupted, then they have a little bit of a glitch for a while.

01:30:56.423 --> 01:30:57.024
They don't know what to do.

01:30:57.674 --> 01:30:59.655
when all you have to do is just climb over the new thing.

01:30:59.715 --> 01:31:01.876
But that I find very fascinating.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:08.100
I would never be interested in the molecular biology at this time scale or this size scale.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.381
It just wouldn't be drawn there.

01:31:10.051 --> 01:31:16.514
I wouldn't be interested in the genetic manipulation of animals and plants by artificial means.

01:31:16.594 --> 01:31:18.075
Why would I be interested in that?

01:31:18.435 --> 01:31:33.062
Knowing that 99% of the time it would never work out anyway, that it would result in a broken dog or a broken mouse, like all inbred mice essentially are, like all of the really inbred dog breeds are.

01:31:35.097 --> 01:31:48.443
That's one of the insights that I had on this thing, which is what, what inspired this napkin that I talked about an hour ago was actually the realization that this is how I explained it at that exact conversation.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.543
But do you understand?

01:31:50.023 --> 01:31:53.765
Isn't it crazy that we haven't used dog breeds for any of these things yet?

01:31:56.141 --> 01:32:00.904
Because we're talking about genes and humans and we're all excited about these genes of interest.

01:32:00.984 --> 01:32:12.412
And I said to these people at the table, but we have dog breeds that already have a propensity to have heart problems, a propensity to have hip problems, a propensity to have all these genetic traits.

01:32:12.492 --> 01:32:26.021
So we should be able to use their genomes and compare across purebred dogs to identify all kinds of genes of interest that have to do with phenotypes like muscle size and leg size and skeleton thickness and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:32:27.282 --> 01:32:40.192
and definitely for heart problems that are congenital in golden retrievers or hip problems that are congenital in in shepherds and so it dawned on me oh my gosh there's a huge resource that we have that's even more

01:32:41.647 --> 01:32:51.580
selected and inbred and purer than the laboratory mice that we've tried to create and serendipitously because we were breeding animals to be useful.

01:32:52.641 --> 01:32:59.771
Selecting for phenotypes and the genotypes that came along with them have naturally been enriched and so there's information there.

01:33:01.752 --> 01:33:24.689
And like six months later, a PNAS paper came out where they analyzed five different dog breeds and showed the genes that were responsible for the extra claw and the gene that was responsible for the bull terrier's jaw and change in skull and how that change in skull, the same gene was also responsible for the collie's long nose.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:29.773
And it was just this absolutely brilliant paper that did exactly what I said in the pub.

01:33:30.834 --> 01:33:45.397
which was use these animals as natural inbred, you know, enriched pure genetic populations from which you could compare other genetically enriched populations and then see what genes separate them.

01:33:47.679 --> 01:33:52.542
And so if you were going to do this in the human population, you wouldn't do it based on skin color.

01:33:52.582 --> 01:33:54.263
You wouldn't do it based on hair.

01:33:54.643 --> 01:33:58.045
You wouldn't do it based on any of those things that don't matter.

01:33:58.085 --> 01:34:00.747
But you definitely want to tell everybody you were going to do that.

01:34:01.633 --> 01:34:06.157
You definitely want to tell everybody that was all about blonde hair and blue eyes in World War II.

01:34:06.617 --> 01:34:25.172
You definitely want to tell them that because you wouldn't want to know, you want them to know that you were enriching for longevity or mitochondrial power or intelligence or free thinking or higher order mathematic capabilities or any of these other things that may very well have some basis in genetics.

01:34:28.837 --> 01:34:49.160
And so if you're thinking on multi-generational timescales and you're thinking about what information can I extract from these people before they die and the population is cut in half, what would you rather extract other than potentially group them into people that live longer, group them into people that think stronger, or group them into people that are healthier?

01:34:49.981 --> 01:35:00.067
and then inadvertently screen their children in the next generation or this one for their genotypes and then even though they don't know, you've already grouped them.

01:35:01.371 --> 01:35:21.361
You already know who the groups that are meaningful are and you've got them all around chasing around race and chasing around religions and chasing around all these other things when in reality the population is screening itself for behaviors and phenotypes that they can then screen for the genotypes that underlie them.

01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:24.543
And the biggest signals will be the most useful.

01:35:25.183 --> 01:35:29.085
It only needs to be one or three.

01:35:31.286 --> 01:35:35.652
Think about the human population as a great big diverse fox farm.

01:35:37.955 --> 01:35:41.660
And what you want to get in the next couple generations is foxes that don't bite.

01:35:46.446 --> 01:35:48.890
If you're intending to change the shared environment,

01:35:50.325 --> 01:35:53.869
Well, people can't very well opt out of the outcomes.

01:35:54.069 --> 01:35:57.133
So you're denying them a voice in these early stage critical decisions.

01:35:57.633 --> 01:36:06.283
So we're trying to establish these norms of greater transparency and especially community guidance in work that will have widespread environmental impacts outside the lab.

01:36:07.444 --> 01:36:08.646
And then the last one is on the

01:36:10.842 --> 01:36:20.827
Misuse side, how can we prepare for a world in which biotech allows many people to build exponentially spreading biological agents?

01:36:21.687 --> 01:36:27.249
Yeah, so there are, I know, a list of different ways that you are looking at approaching that.

01:36:27.309 --> 01:36:32.832
And I think probably the most famous piece of your work is coming out of the gene drive, right?

01:36:33.552 --> 01:36:36.093
So can you talk about what is a gene drive?

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:37.034
How does that work?

01:36:37.194 --> 01:36:39.555
And how does that affect these outcomes that you're talking about?

01:36:40.131 --> 01:36:48.793
Yeah, so until, I suppose, about a decade ago, we really couldn't use biotechnology to change the environment very much.

01:36:49.513 --> 01:37:06.498
About the most we could do is use biotech to change the domesticated animals and crops that then we put out there and shape the environment in other ways, typically using lots of energy and chemicals, to create a local fitness advantage, and then we would just engineer those things so that they had different traits.

01:37:07.861 --> 01:37:20.704
What we really could not do at all is engineer anything approximating a wild organism with a new trait and then have that trait persist, let alone spread on its own in the wild.

01:37:21.705 --> 01:37:30.587
In fact, it wouldn't be an overstatement to claim that we could not build fitness-positive things until about a decade ago.

01:37:31.987 --> 01:37:34.648
And a decade ago, of course, is about when CRISPR came out.

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:45.871
so fitness positive and one of the things i realized not too long after that is fitness positive things in his vernacular seems to indicate like a gain of function

01:37:47.185 --> 01:37:53.467
So we weren't able to create gain of function pattern integrities until his technology.

01:37:53.507 --> 01:37:56.208
So make sure you don't miss this, right?

01:37:56.248 --> 01:38:01.070
He's choosing his words very carefully, but he's not choosing them in a way that will reveal the stunt.

01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:04.291
And the stunt is here very specifically.

01:38:04.331 --> 01:38:05.912
He understands what he just said.

01:38:05.952 --> 01:38:08.933
He just didn't say it in a way that would be useful to us.

01:38:09.413 --> 01:38:11.134
But I'll say it in a way that will be useful.

01:38:11.174 --> 01:38:14.155
We haven't been able to make pattern integrities that sustain.

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:24.520
We haven't been able to usefully augment a pattern integrity ever and have the progeny of that pattern integrity be better off than before we modified them.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.301
We've never been able to do it.

01:38:27.442 --> 01:38:41.750
But this is the same guy who was in front of the Senate in a testimony in 2020 or 2021 about the fact that gain of function does exactly that with RNA.

01:38:43.683 --> 01:38:47.008
Do you hear how extraordinary that is?

01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:57.303
A professor from MIT at the Sculpting Evolution Lab is telling you that heretofore, we have not been able to usefully augment a pattern integrity in a positive way.

01:38:58.154 --> 01:39:00.315
that was sustained across generations.

01:39:00.956 --> 01:39:21.709
And yet, a couple years ago, this guy testified that gain-of-function research in virology, which is lipid-coated RNAs, needs to be tightly regulated because if you add the wrong sequences to these, they become self-sustaining pattern integrities that can endanger the entire world's population.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.961
And this guy's in their meetings.

01:39:29.181 --> 01:39:31.122
This guy is at the foo conferences.

01:39:31.202 --> 01:39:37.367
This guy is the guy who's finding and training the postdocs that then don't go on to work to pharmaceutical companies.

01:39:37.787 --> 01:39:39.108
They go on to work for DARPA.

01:39:39.128 --> 01:39:40.509
They go on to work for DOD.

01:39:40.529 --> 01:39:42.470
They go on to work for somebody that nobody knows.

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:51.516
He works at the MIT media lab that was tied with all these other creepy stories that have nothing to do with what they're really doing there.

01:39:52.366 --> 01:39:58.114
which is thinking on a multi-generational timescale about how they can usefully augment the human species.

01:40:00.277 --> 01:40:04.282
And they really actually already understand that it's going to be primarily

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:09.304
genes that they need to target, genetic backgrounds that they need to target.

01:40:09.324 --> 01:40:22.980
And the first way that you find a gene associated with a particular behavior in animals on the laboratory bench in neuroscience is to take that group of animals and enrich them for the behavior that you want.

01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:38.608
If you want to see genetic signals in an animal, and you're only going to look for things that stand out, then you also need to create a genetic background that's very homogenous.

01:40:39.129 --> 01:40:44.372
So that tiny signals show up on a background with very little noise, because all the animals are identical.

01:40:44.933 --> 01:40:56.561
The flip version of that is when you start with a phenotype, the way to get a good genetic signal would be to enrich this phenotype as, as specifically as possible.

01:40:59.198 --> 01:41:04.381
If you wanted to make everybody redheaded, then the way to do it would be to make sure that only redheads had kids.

01:41:09.525 --> 01:41:19.251
If you want to make sure that you don't have biting foxes in a fur farm, then you make sure that the foxes that bite the handlers don't make pups.

01:41:22.753 --> 01:41:28.617
And if you want to find populations of humans and identify the genes that underlie their

01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:44.820
their rebellious and independent behavior that make them ungovernable, then you're going to have to first identify those people and then monitor their children to see if they pass on this trait.

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:58.409
And if they do, you've got a group that's probably enriched for genetic background propensity to rebel, to critically think, to be intelligent, to live longer,

01:42:00.134 --> 01:42:00.954
to be healthier.

01:42:03.935 --> 01:42:05.396
And so can you see what they're doing?

01:42:05.936 --> 01:42:20.001
Can you see why it's not about depopulation, but it's a longer game and why social media plays exactly into them being able to covertly identify and group us, store all this information digitally?

01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:29.425
That if you edit an organism with CRISPR and you put it out there,

01:42:30.441 --> 01:42:35.765
natural selection is going to typically act against it, because whatever change we made, we made it for our benefit.

01:42:37.106 --> 01:42:40.509
We didn't make it to assist the replication of the organism.

01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:58.543
But if you encode the CRISPR genome editing machinery next to the change that you made, and you program it to turn on in the reproductive cells of a multicellular organism, so one that makes sperm and eggs,

01:42:59.730 --> 01:43:12.078
then in organisms that inherit one engineered copy and one wild copy, CRISPR will turn on in the reproductive cells, it'll cut the wild copy, and it'll replace it with the engineered version.

01:43:13.079 --> 01:43:18.483
And so what I'm suggesting to you is, is if they did this to you, you wouldn't know.

01:43:20.204 --> 01:43:28.770
If they knocked out the gene for rebellious behavior, whatever that gene is that they identified, and you had kids, you wouldn't know.

01:43:31.636 --> 01:43:43.480
And so if this guy has invented the molecular techniques that are needed, the first thing they need to do is make sure that all of our kids accept injections, intramuscular injection.

01:43:44.521 --> 01:43:55.445
The next thing they need to do is have our kids accept that the species and the group and the globe and the community are more important than themselves and overrides their own sovereignty.

01:43:57.768 --> 01:44:08.315
And then they need to use the data that they're gathering over the next decade about how we behave and what our propensities are to endure and to rebel as opposed to conform.

01:44:10.236 --> 01:44:14.558
And then our genomes can be put into a useful context.

01:44:15.799 --> 01:44:25.045
Our genomes can be put together and pooled and screened for signals that rise above the noise, which indicate that maybe or maybe not our kids are inheriting something.

01:44:26.755 --> 01:44:30.636
And if they are, they can use a gene drive to knock it out in the next generation.

01:44:30.696 --> 01:44:35.038
And in one generation, we will go from having these genes to not.

01:44:35.978 --> 01:44:40.940
And they will be exclusively controlled by the bloodlines that are running this show.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:51.783
The only wild type humans left with all the potential of humans given to us by God will be those people who weren't gene drived.

01:44:55.845 --> 01:45:00.472
And it's impossible for me to let go of this thought anymore.

01:45:01.815 --> 01:45:20.553
All this studying of his papers and trying to get to the point where I could teach virology and teach molecular biology and the illusion of the human genome project and teach what gene drives are has also inadvertently awakened me to this idea that reminded me that I need to think on different timescales.

01:45:20.633 --> 01:45:21.994
This is the perfect weapon.

01:45:22.054 --> 01:45:26.879
A gene drive is the perfect weapon because the victims are not the victims.

01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:34.911
There are no victims in a way.

01:45:35.772 --> 01:45:40.255
If our gametes are affected and our kids grow up with those genes, they don't know.

01:45:41.736 --> 01:45:46.899
You're not going to know if you're a genetically modified organism when you grow up a genetically modified organism.

01:45:49.522 --> 01:46:08.936
And if we have accepted intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system as a foregone conclusion, has the highest expression of our technology and a highest expression of our existence, then it's going to be very, very easy for them to put this in there because that's all it is.

01:46:09.176 --> 01:46:10.677
It's just RNA and DNA.

01:46:12.058 --> 01:46:15.721
Synthetically purified, made to order and design.

01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:27.498
They put it in you, it affects your gametes, and if you reproduce, and if you don't reproduce, it's all good too.

01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:31.962
Polluting the CRISPR machinery.

01:46:32.843 --> 01:46:38.948
So this means that instead of half the offspring inheriting the engineered trait, all of them will.

01:46:40.658 --> 01:46:45.341
I would say something to Phil Blanc there, because what you're talking about is really real.

01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:52.284
You're right, that if biting foxes, if there is an advantage, then the biting foxes will come back again.

01:46:52.344 --> 01:47:04.211
But from their biological perspective, I don't know if this is right, because again, I think that this is undiscovered country here with regard to what the genome really is.

01:47:05.367 --> 01:47:17.597
But if you go by their model of reality and by what they're thinking, what they believe is that a significant portion of behavior and of propensity to behave in humans is determined by genetic background.

01:47:18.117 --> 01:47:28.466
And so if they are able to identify genes which play a role in the propensity to behave in a certain way, then taking those genes out of the gene pool completely

01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:38.113
which is what a gene drive does, will remove permanently that potential of evolutionarily coming back in a generation.

01:47:39.634 --> 01:47:52.759
If you get rid of all the genes for red hair, it's much harder for red hair to spontaneously show up again in future generations, even if it could be carried very recessively for a while until you get lucky.

01:47:53.720 --> 01:48:00.709
That can't happen if the genetic basis for it is removed from all populations or from the population we're talking about.

01:48:01.209 --> 01:48:10.360
And so you're totally right about foxes, but if you believe what this guy is saying and you believe what the mechanics of this molecular biology are,

01:48:11.101 --> 01:48:20.205
and it seems to be the case in cell culture and in limited applications in insects, then it seems like this would take away the genetic basis for these propensities.

01:48:20.265 --> 01:48:29.208
And so the propensity to bite would have to develop in a new way, or as a consequence of a rearrangement of the other genes which are involved, which weren't identified.

01:48:29.228 --> 01:48:33.930
And so you're right, but you're also kind of not right from their perspective of the biology.

01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:38.332
But thank you for the tip or for the chat, because I think it's insightful.

01:48:41.052 --> 01:48:43.954
And that's why we call this a CRISPR-based gene drive system.

01:48:44.574 --> 01:48:51.139
And the gene drive refers to the distorting inheritance to favor one particular allele over another.

01:48:51.459 --> 01:48:53.640
And there's all kinds of natural gene drive systems.

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.624
Our genomes are laden with the broken remnants of ancient gene drive systems of various forms.

01:48:59.124 --> 01:49:03.747
But with CRISPR, we- So that's an interesting statement to make without qualification.

01:49:03.907 --> 01:49:08.751
Our genomes are littered with remnants of gene drives from before.

01:49:09.781 --> 01:49:17.925
That's really kind of like virology saying that, you know, there's all kinds of RNA and stuff all over the place.

01:49:17.945 --> 01:49:20.286
So, you know, it's not just viruses, but that doesn't matter.

01:49:20.326 --> 01:49:21.207
We study viruses.

01:49:21.667 --> 01:49:32.152
Him saying that I'm making gene drives and it's a brand new thing, even though there are remnants of gene drives from generations in the past and it's all over the place, seems to implicate something different here.

01:49:33.973 --> 01:49:44.123
And so because there are very few people that are attempting to spin this mythology, I think it's very possible that we're going to catch a lot of these kind of pseudo incongruencies or things that aren't explained quite right.

01:49:44.183 --> 01:49:47.626
Number one, because again, the interviewer is completely inept.

01:49:47.646 --> 01:49:49.027
He's not going to be able to do anything.

01:49:49.047 --> 01:49:52.470
He's just going to ask questions that were probably already pre-agreed upon.

01:49:52.611 --> 01:49:58.216
Have the opportunity to control this and harness it for our own purposes.

01:49:58.874 --> 01:50:03.317
Of course, in most cases, you don't necessarily want to engineer the entire species.

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:05.738
I can think of four cases where we might wanna do that.

01:50:06.159 --> 01:50:08.420
For most of them, you really just wanna keep a lid on that.

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:17.826
I just wanna show you how, so TK07777, they'd probably target fertility more than anything else, no?

01:50:18.346 --> 01:50:25.051
Let me give you a flip side of that, which comes right off the cuff right now, just pops right into my head because of what you typed.

01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:27.172
Who's having babies right now?

01:50:28.544 --> 01:50:32.467
Who is passing genes on to the next generation right now?

01:50:32.507 --> 01:50:35.009
Well, it's not the people that are already conforming.

01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:39.913
My brother and his wife decided not to have kids because they thought that was a good thing to do for the earth.

01:50:41.193 --> 01:50:47.178
My friend Mark Kulak was currently in Reno, Nevada, and one of the things he noticed is that there aren't very many kids there.

01:50:47.979 --> 01:50:49.740
The people that work there aren't having kids.

01:50:54.249 --> 01:51:01.215
And so, yeah, the people that don't have the genes that they're interested in, the people that are conforming are not having kids.

01:51:01.616 --> 01:51:03.177
They don't care about those genes.

01:51:03.237 --> 01:51:12.386
They care about the genes for intelligence, longevity, health, independence, critical thinking, and those genes and those people are still reproducing.

01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:15.989
The experiment is going perfectly.

01:51:16.926 --> 01:51:24.894
They can discourage most people that watch TV and social media and usefully, really skillfully use those things.

01:51:25.295 --> 01:51:28.038
They can discourage them from breeding in all kinds of other ways.

01:51:29.159 --> 01:51:36.447
With infidelity, with porn, with divorce, and with narratives about bad kids, or you know, whatever.

01:51:37.448 --> 01:51:38.709
And with economic hardship.

01:51:40.543 --> 01:51:53.037
But people that are gonna have kids, people that believe that having kids is, you know, the thing, they're not gonna stop having kids because somebody says not to have kids or that kids are bad for the environment or whatever.

01:51:55.529 --> 01:52:06.155
So for me, the experiment is working out perfectly because the people that are having kids are also likely to have the genetic predispositions that they want to analyze further.

01:52:06.215 --> 01:52:13.360
And so using social media and stress and societal strife, they are getting us to identify ourselves.

01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:28.759
And then they can watch our behavior in the artificial prison of social media where we oftentimes think that we're actually fighting the empire when really we're just sitting in that virtual reality chair.

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:35.445
And these performing liars are telling us a version of the mythology that won't usefully let us escape.

01:52:36.738 --> 01:52:38.759
because we're not thinking on the right timescale.

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:48.725
This is the right timescale, the generational timescale, the changing of people's gametes so that people that they don't want to breed won't breed.

01:52:49.389 --> 01:53:05.097
But more importantly, so that people won't pass on the genes that they don't want them to pass on, because that is a much more crafty and much more malevolent and wicked application of the same tools.

01:53:05.557 --> 01:53:07.077
And you're only a local population.

01:53:07.097 --> 01:53:18.543
So a lot of what my group does is focus on this question of how can we reliably control the extent to which we edit a wild species?

01:53:20.957 --> 01:53:27.041
So he's saying wild species here, but ultimately understand that this is not about the wild species.

01:53:27.101 --> 01:53:27.781
It's about us.

01:53:29.242 --> 01:53:31.083
We're going to learn how this thing works.

01:53:31.123 --> 01:53:32.764
We're going to make this tool work better.

01:53:33.584 --> 01:53:38.827
And then once it's working, the application to the human race will be a multi-generational experiment.

01:53:39.007 --> 01:53:48.713
Nobody who gets a gene drive will know that they got a gene drive and their kids won't know either.

01:53:51.482 --> 01:53:57.987
And unless you know what part of your genome to look at to see whether you got a gene drive, you won't know either.

01:54:01.009 --> 01:54:02.610
How did you end up stumbling across this?

01:54:02.650 --> 01:54:08.935
I understand that kind of the argument of CRISPR being discovered rather than being invented as it's technically a natural system.

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:14.539
But so how did it come along that this doesn't seem like this was something that was searched for in demand.

01:54:14.579 --> 01:54:17.701
It seems like this is something that you kind of found and realized its potential later.

01:54:18.612 --> 01:54:25.354
Well, the notion of gene drive is well understood because nature discovered that around the time sex evolved in the first place.

01:54:26.214 --> 01:54:30.776
Ways of cheating that even distribution of inheritance pattern began to evolve.

01:54:31.836 --> 01:54:34.757
And CRISPR was first really discovered, yes.

01:54:35.698 --> 01:54:39.799
I played a very minor role in developing it with George Church's team.

01:54:40.683 --> 01:54:41.523
at Harvard Medical School.

01:54:41.563 --> 01:54:43.985
George Church is not a good guy.

01:54:44.445 --> 01:54:47.326
In case anybody is not aware, you can go Google that fella.

01:54:48.447 --> 01:54:55.310
He's like Epstein and all that other stuff that I don't cover.

01:54:56.150 --> 01:55:03.734
And that's who he did his PhD with, George Church, in case there's any more doubt about what team he's on and what he's talking about and how he thinks.

01:55:05.614 --> 01:55:06.415
With Gene Drive,

01:55:07.403 --> 01:55:11.145
I've just always been very interested in evolution and fitness advantages.

01:55:11.225 --> 01:55:13.025
That's been a major focus of my research.

01:55:14.046 --> 01:55:21.649
For other reasons, I was just walking outside in the Emerald Necklace and I wondered, hey, would we ever engineer any of these critters around us with CRISPR?

01:55:22.389 --> 01:55:25.170
I saw a turtle that day, I remember, which is very unusual.

01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:26.731
You don't see a lot of turtles in the Emerald Necklace.

01:55:27.847 --> 01:55:38.251
And I concluded that no, we probably wouldn't because we'd have to raise so many of them in order to release enough to make a dent in the existing wild population of any given trait that it probably wasn't very likely that we would do that.

01:55:39.271 --> 01:55:40.732
Then I wondered, well, wait a minute.

01:55:41.632 --> 01:55:50.435
What if you encode CRISPR along with the change you want to make such that the organism will do genome editing on its own and convert the wild copy to the engineered copy?

01:55:52.005 --> 01:55:53.086
potentially every generation.

01:55:53.566 --> 01:55:59.789
And I thought, wait a minute, that's exactly what the ISK1 endonuclease gene and enzyme do in yeast.

01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:06.613
ISK1 exists at a locus that does not always contain it.

01:56:07.353 --> 01:56:19.100
And when it finds itself in a diploid yeast that has the wild type version and the ISK1 version, ISK1 endonuclease cuts the wild type version and it copies over the ISK1 gene in its place.

01:56:20.981 --> 01:56:21.481
So this is a

01:56:22.338 --> 01:56:23.960
endonuclease gene drive system.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.585
And what I was thinking, wait a minute, what I just proposed was doing that exact same thing with CRISPR.

01:56:30.867 --> 01:56:41.157
And then I thought, wait a minute, aren't there people trying to engineer homing endonucleases like IceQ1 to be useful to build gene drives in like malarial mosquitoes to get rid of malaria?

01:56:41.177 --> 01:56:44.080
Because I'm sure I remembered hearing something about that.

01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:52.253
And I thought, but that won't work very well, because A, it's incredibly difficult to re-engineer homing endonucleases.

01:56:53.774 --> 01:57:00.058
And B, if you target just one site, what if there's a mutation in that site that blocks cutting?

01:57:00.998 --> 01:57:06.782
Any wild type organism that has a mutation, as long as that mutation is more fit than your gene drive system,

01:57:07.796 --> 01:57:10.439
then it can't be replaced by the gene drive, and so it's going to outcompete it.

01:57:10.879 --> 01:57:13.922
Now, first of all, keep in mind what he's talking about is yeast, right?

01:57:14.002 --> 01:57:24.672
So he's talking about a very simple genome, a very simple organism with very simple physiology that can be easily tracked over generations.

01:57:24.732 --> 01:57:30.238
And he's talking about the application of these endonucleases into those genomes and how they work.

01:57:32.086 --> 01:57:41.288
And the jump here, and that's again why I'm teaching and trying to orchestrate this Biology 101 class, is because in this book,

01:57:42.407 --> 01:58:08.722
regularly in this Biology 101 book and regularly in the ideas of prion disease, for example, you're going to be asked to accept the molecular evidence, the mechanistic molecular evidence of yeast as directly correlated to molecular processes assumed to be seminal to our own pattern integrity.

01:58:09.383 --> 01:58:23.729
And so anything that we learn in yeast can be applied to this pattern integrity, even if the difference is, you know, a matchbox car and a Formula One race car.

01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:38.636
He thinks that, you know, if we understand how a little matchbox car works and how the wheels can work, then we understand how a Formula One car works and we can apply what we learned in our matchbox car modifications to a Formula One car.

01:58:40.743 --> 01:58:52.007
And yet that's what we accept with prions and the prion model in yeast with the prion model that we assume exists in our own system.

01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:58.469
And that's what he wants you to assume here is that when he can do these things in a yeast,

01:59:00.546 --> 01:59:12.749
that doing them in a larger, more complicated pattern integrity on the four-dimensional and on the three-dimensional and on the four-dimensional size scale and time scale, that it's all the same.

01:59:13.609 --> 01:59:15.129
And again, what is that illusion?

01:59:15.169 --> 01:59:23.171
That illusion is almost the determinism of this fundamental biology that they've been teaching us since we were a kid.

01:59:23.691 --> 01:59:29.032
That DNA and its existence mean that we're essentially all physics and chemistry.

01:59:30.097 --> 01:59:31.499
We're not all we're cracked up to be.

01:59:31.579 --> 01:59:33.101
There's nothing really special here.

01:59:33.561 --> 01:59:41.191
It's just that we can't really understand it yet, but eventually we will once we get better measuring devices and better cameras and better microscopes.

01:59:43.396 --> 01:59:46.917
And so if we understand DNA, then everything else is dependent on it.

01:59:46.957 --> 02:00:04.780
Just in the same way that Teilhard de Chardin and Brett Weinstein would say unequivocally that evolution is the foundational mode of thought, that all other disciplines stem from evolutionary theory and evolutionary thinking.

02:00:06.621 --> 02:00:07.201
They say that.

02:00:08.476 --> 02:00:17.362
Brett says that, Desjardins says that, they all say that, and this guy is, of course, sculpting Evolution Lab at MIT Media Labs.

02:00:18.443 --> 02:00:20.404
But I thought, with CRISPR, the game changes.

02:00:20.424 --> 02:00:27.528
Now you can target multiple sites, such that it would have to require combinatorial resistance, which nature is not very good at.

02:00:28.489 --> 02:00:30.971
So here is a way that would allow us to

02:00:34.306 --> 02:00:46.731
engineer wild populations in a way that would be evolutionarily stable, and CRISPR is so versatile in targeting that you could always build another one, no matter the target sequence.

02:00:47.091 --> 02:00:56.274
Instead of spending a decade trying to engineer one homing endonuclease to build something that wouldn't be a very evolutionarily stable, you just target it with CRISPR.

02:01:00.623 --> 02:01:11.129
So I was very enthused for the first day and thought about it a lot, and went and read up a lot on gene drive and discovered that Austin Burt had actually come up with a clever way of using a homing endonuclease to cause a population to crash.

02:01:11.369 --> 02:01:26.258
The obvious way is you can, instead of copying a single sequence of DNA at one genetic locus, what if instead you program the gene drive system to preferentially cause the inheritance of a sex chromosome?

02:01:27.028 --> 02:01:39.913
So what if, for example, in the mosquito Y-chromosome, which also encodes maleness in mosquitoes just like it does in humans, what if you encode a nuclease that cuts the X-chromosome, thereby ensuring that most offspring inherit the Y?

02:01:40.554 --> 02:01:50.738
They would therefore be male, and they would inherit this ability, and then you would end up having this driving Y-chromosome spread through the population, turn them into males, and the population would crash.

02:01:51.527 --> 02:01:54.069
There's also another way to do it by targeting female fertility genes.

02:01:54.609 --> 02:01:56.330
So Austin Bird had worked out all of this in 2003.

02:01:56.611 --> 02:02:02.214
And in fact, he'd been trying to raise money and building up this organization called Target Malaria to build gene driving in mosquitoes.

02:02:04.076 --> 02:02:05.096
So I was very excited by this.

02:02:05.136 --> 02:02:07.638
And I thought, oh, it's not just malarial mosquitoes.

02:02:07.678 --> 02:02:12.742
If that works, we can directly target and crash the populations of the schistosomes that cause schistosomiasis.

02:02:13.462 --> 02:02:15.424
There's surely many other things that we could do this for.

02:02:15.444 --> 02:02:20.067
And then the next day, I woke up and thought,

02:02:21.869 --> 02:02:23.850
Good God, how many people are going to be able to do this?

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.452
And are we going to be engineering every organism there is out there?

02:02:26.712 --> 02:02:32.736
And if you can engineer a mosquito to not carry disease, you can engineer a mosquito to carry a disease always.

02:02:33.676 --> 02:02:34.697
This seems really bad.

02:02:36.438 --> 02:02:38.059
How thoroughly could this be misused?

02:02:38.399 --> 02:02:39.660
And is that going to be a problem?

02:02:40.681 --> 02:02:42.862
And I sat on it for a month or so until I was pretty sure.

02:02:42.902 --> 02:02:47.385
But the answer is, it's slow because it spreads over generations.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.180
easily detected.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:56.343
It's obvious if you look for it, just because these sexually reproducing organisms don't have CRISPR in their genomes.

02:02:56.563 --> 02:03:00.364
They have CRISPR in their bodies because in the gut.

02:03:00.504 --> 02:03:01.985
That's really extraordinary.

02:03:02.785 --> 02:03:04.686
It's obvious because you can look for it.

02:03:04.726 --> 02:03:08.127
Who's going to screen for CRISPR in our kids' kids?

02:03:13.447 --> 02:03:25.357
And whose word are you going to take for it that they screened your genome objectively to find out if you had CRISPR in it or not after being transfected over your lifetime to the entire childhood vaccine schedule?

02:03:26.358 --> 02:03:27.679
You see where this is going?

02:03:27.739 --> 02:03:30.081
If it's a multi-generational thing,

02:03:31.314 --> 02:03:37.179
then they need to identify and segregate populations of humans with the phenotypes that they want to screen for.

02:03:37.199 --> 02:03:43.103
And they're not screening for things that you think they're screening for, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

02:03:43.123 --> 02:03:48.748
They're screening for intelligence, longevity, endurance, mitochondrial performance, all these things.

02:03:51.485 --> 02:04:03.633
And they are using social media to get us to segregate ourselves based on cognitive ability and cognitive propensity to rebel and to think independently so that they can eventually screen our children for those genotypes.

02:04:04.493 --> 02:04:15.320
To try and identify signals usefully in these generations as they slowly, inevitably, the population collapses back down to a more useful level for the world.

02:04:17.363 --> 02:04:25.150
But I think the people that are governing us over these multiple generations already knew that it was okay for the world to become crowded because we could use it.

02:04:25.710 --> 02:04:44.467
It's okay for us to drive the population to a higher population, sorry, family size after World War II and then take it down later in the coming decades because then we would be left with this, you know, coming increase in all cause mortality as these people aged out that we could tell them a story about.

02:04:46.038 --> 02:04:53.403
And that story would allow us to finally segregate these people into useful groups across countries.

02:04:53.603 --> 02:05:02.750
Because across languages, across cultures, people have risen up and identified themselves as people who don't believe this bullshit.

02:05:07.492 --> 02:05:11.695
And so they did it very cleverly, much more clever.

02:05:11.935 --> 02:05:32.327
I mean, I think they need a clap because this is incredible how this plan has enabled them to identify all the people across cultures and languages using social media that had the potential genetic propensity to stand up, to rebel, to critically think, to endure.

02:05:33.488 --> 02:05:36.050
And now they can carefully monitor our children

02:05:37.059 --> 02:05:43.475
because we are still having them, to see if that behavior segregates or not.

02:05:44.397 --> 02:05:45.058
And if it does...

02:05:45.734 --> 02:05:47.055
they have their population.

02:05:47.616 --> 02:05:52.520
They have their population of biting foxes with the probably enriched genotypes.

02:05:53.320 --> 02:06:04.650
You know, like James Lyons Wyler was talking about how unvaccinated kids are segregating by genotype because they are injured and they have a propensity to be injured.

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:07.392
And so we have to screen those people for their genotype.

02:06:07.952 --> 02:06:10.935
That is a bullshit lie.

02:06:12.346 --> 02:06:18.008
But screening everybody that's had the propensity to stand up and have principles in 2020 is not a lie.

02:06:19.008 --> 02:06:27.670
And screening the kids of the people who stood up and the kids who are still standing up would be even a better group of people to screen.

02:06:29.211 --> 02:06:31.211
And the perfect target for a gene drive.

02:06:37.219 --> 02:06:40.822
encoding CRISPR in the actual eukaryotic cells themselves.

02:06:41.522 --> 02:06:44.424
So if you see CRISPR in there, it's because a human put it there.

02:06:44.484 --> 02:06:48.988
So it's going to be blindingly obvious you can't pull a fast one on anyone with this technology.

02:06:49.048 --> 02:06:50.349
And that's a ridiculous statement.

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:53.031
You can't pull a fast one on anyone with this technology.

02:06:53.071 --> 02:06:58.415
If you're only changing my sperm, how the hell would I know until my kid's 14 years old?

02:07:02.097 --> 02:07:02.878
It's an illusion.

02:07:04.406 --> 02:07:13.033
Maybe you can't knock down a mosquito population without somebody being able to figure out that the mosquito population collapsed because of a CRISPR event.

02:07:13.633 --> 02:07:14.494
That's true.

02:07:16.035 --> 02:07:21.899
But how the hell would we ever know until it was way too late that they had altered people with CRISPR?

02:07:21.939 --> 02:07:22.340
We wouldn't.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.561
And this is bullshit, what he's saying right here.

02:07:24.982 --> 02:07:26.583
And this is part of his shtick.

02:07:26.663 --> 02:07:27.564
This is what he does.

02:07:29.065 --> 02:07:29.345
Apology.

02:07:30.427 --> 02:07:37.250
So it's slow, it's obvious, and crucially, because CRISPR is so versatile, it's easily countered.

02:07:38.411 --> 02:07:50.096
That is, if one person can build a gene drive system that works in an organism, somebody else can take the exact same gene drive design, swap out the guide RNAs, change the sequences

02:07:53.172 --> 02:07:54.492
for two ones.

02:07:55.232 --> 02:07:55.953
Sorry, let me start over.

02:07:57.193 --> 02:08:00.093
You can take the original gene drive that you don't like.

02:08:01.094 --> 02:08:04.494
You can remove whatever it is that causes the problem.

02:08:05.295 --> 02:08:14.156
And then you can add some extra guide RNAs that target the original version and just change the target sequences in yours so that they're no longer present.

02:08:14.977 --> 02:08:20.218
This way, yours will continue to spread through the wild population just like the version you don't like.

02:08:20.878 --> 02:08:22.098
But whenever yours encounters

02:08:23.732 --> 02:08:27.538
The first gene drive version, the second one will cut it and replace it with itself.

02:08:28.459 --> 02:08:31.944
So it has all the advantages, plus it wins when the two encounter each other.

02:08:32.445 --> 02:08:40.116
And because CRISPR is so versatile, it is not possible to build a CRISPR-based gene drive system that cannot be overwritten by another one.

02:08:40.973 --> 02:08:46.639
So that's also ridiculous because one of the things that he's not admitting is that CRISPR has all kinds of off-target effects.

02:08:46.679 --> 02:08:56.329
You have this guide RNA that is supposed to make it go to a specific place and give it high specificity, and that's what he's talking about in a cartoon form.

02:08:56.369 --> 02:09:01.054
But in reality, CRISPR also just randomly hits shit too.

02:09:02.116 --> 02:09:02.997
And they know that.

02:09:03.497 --> 02:09:17.885
That's one of the huge limitations about altering larger genomes, and why it works so usefully in yeast most of the time if you ignore all the noise, because the genome's small enough where off-target effects are negligible.

02:09:18.926 --> 02:09:23.229
But when you start trying to augment a genome that has, you know, billions of bases, well,

02:09:26.536 --> 02:09:28.197
It's a little more complicated than that.

02:09:28.257 --> 02:09:51.330
Now, I'm just suggesting to you, not that this is dangerous for us now, it is dangerous for our ecosystems now, but it is this kind of potential and this inaccurate, very disingenuous discussing of a limited spectrum of debate, asking questions that don't matter, talking about aspects of safety that don't matter.

02:09:53.723 --> 02:10:07.850
and thinking on timescales that aren't relevant for human population and human governance and the sculpting of the evolution of mankind, which is what all of these people and all of these books are all about, including Kevin Esvelt.

02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:11.712
If anybody is definitely on their team, it's him.

02:10:12.352 --> 02:10:20.156
Remember, he testified in front of Congress during the pandemic that gain-of-function viruses were very, very dangerous.

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:32.319
and needed to be tightly regulated, even though in this interview from this year, he said that we've never, up until very recently, been able to positively augment a pattern integrity.

02:10:32.359 --> 02:10:35.681
We've never been able to gain a function anything.

02:10:37.942 --> 02:10:43.325
But three years before this, he testified in front of Congress that gain-of-function RNA is dangerous to the planet.

02:10:44.646 --> 02:10:46.627
So you know he's a liar, okay?

02:10:46.647 --> 02:10:48.448
You know that he's part of this.

02:10:48.488 --> 02:10:49.569
There is no other,

02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:51.510
conclusion to come to.

02:10:52.831 --> 02:10:54.951
He might be unwittingly doing this.

02:10:55.011 --> 02:10:56.991
He might be, but there's, it's no way.

02:10:57.371 --> 02:10:58.212
There's just no way.

02:11:00.692 --> 02:11:04.373
This guy loves being part of this highly trained elite.

02:11:04.753 --> 02:11:07.654
He descends from George Church.

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:18.696
In other words, it's inherently reversible and it inherently favors defense because anything that is slow, obvious, and easily blocked favors defense.

02:11:19.619 --> 02:11:23.142
Now, if you remove any one of those properties, then it no longer favors defense.

02:11:23.402 --> 02:11:24.863
But gene drive has all three.

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:28.206
And consequently, I concluded that it was safe to tell other people.

02:11:28.887 --> 02:11:40.216
So at that point, I told George Church and said, who else can, is it safe to tell about this and ensure that I'm right once you believe, to your satisfaction, that my reasoning is in fact correct?

02:11:41.257 --> 02:11:44.780
I'm guessing George Church was very excited when he first had this idea.

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:46.101
Yeah, we had some good discussions.

02:11:48.358 --> 02:11:51.280
Yeah, we had some good discussions, and then he looks away.

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:58.125
We had some good discussions about how we could govern, how we could influence the evolution of humankind.

02:11:59.166 --> 02:12:04.610
How if we knew what genes were doing what, we could really influence humankind.

02:12:06.107 --> 02:12:11.369
If we knew what genes were doing what, we could sure influence humankind.

02:12:11.469 --> 02:12:22.313
One of the ways that we could find out what genes are doing what would be to first get people to segregate themselves into groups of different fundamental conscious thought.

02:12:23.993 --> 02:12:31.016
Because as they say, schools of fish swim in the ocean and groups of men swim in conscious thought.

02:12:32.856 --> 02:12:34.237
So our genetic propensity

02:12:35.202 --> 02:12:56.671
to swim in high levels of conscious thought, to swim in spiritual levels of conscious thought, to swim in independent conscious thought versus our desire or drive to be a part of a group of conscious thought is probably somewhere has a genetic basis and these people would be interested in that.

02:12:59.612 --> 02:13:02.674
Elon Musk and his friends would be interested in that.

02:13:03.547 --> 02:13:08.571
Kevin Esfeldt and George Church would be interested in that, I assure you.

02:13:09.771 --> 02:13:25.142
So because this is an inherently defensive technology and still is probably looked at very carefully, even when you're looking at crashing populations of mosquitoes, because even though it's a defensive technology, the mosquitoes aren't going to be trying to re-engineer CRISPR to try and fix it.

02:13:26.283 --> 02:13:28.084
What are the specific applications that you had in mind?

02:13:28.104 --> 02:13:29.205
I know you said you mentioned four.

02:13:30.712 --> 02:13:35.268
So originally it was, well, remember Ian to the fray.

02:13:36.949 --> 02:13:45.072
What they're talking about in swimming of schools of thought is that fish swim in groups because that's their nature.

02:13:45.812 --> 02:13:47.773
And men also swim in groups.

02:13:47.793 --> 02:13:52.575
You could say that we have a propensity to form social groups in the form of tribes.

02:13:53.055 --> 02:14:01.878
You could say we have a propensity to form groups in the form of gangs or in the form of militia or communities.

02:14:02.498 --> 02:14:04.059
And that genetic propensity

02:14:05.465 --> 02:14:07.387
I think is probably variable.

02:14:08.588 --> 02:14:11.972
Just like the propensity to be a leader is variable.

02:14:12.552 --> 02:14:18.218
Just like the propensity to speak up or not is probably variable.

02:14:18.678 --> 02:14:29.769
And some of that variability, maybe not very much of it, maybe it's very little genetic, but from the perspective of these people, they think it's exclusively genetic.

02:14:30.816 --> 02:14:37.521
They think they can explain almost all of human behavior by the propensity and the potential set by your genetic background.

02:14:39.002 --> 02:14:42.144
And so they want to look for this signal.

02:14:43.385 --> 02:14:52.251
They're most interested in signals that are longevity, endurance, mitochondrial strength, intelligence, free thinking.

02:14:52.992 --> 02:14:55.694
They want to understand the genetic basis of those things.

02:14:55.734 --> 02:15:00.577
They want to understand the genetic basis of genius without us knowing that that's what they're doing.

02:15:02.628 --> 02:15:05.449
And so they tell us that we're studying Alzheimer's.

02:15:05.509 --> 02:15:25.337
They tell us that we're studying the loss of memory in old people, when in reality, those genes are most likely involved also in the maintenance of memory and the ability to live a long, healthy, conscious life, a spiritual life, an independent life, free of the influence of liars.

02:15:26.837 --> 02:15:31.979
there may be a genetic vulnerability to concerted lying and social pressure.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:37.022
And that genetic vulnerability will also be enriched by the groupings in social media.

02:15:37.122 --> 02:15:40.083
And so all of these things are just ideas I want you to think about.

02:15:40.103 --> 02:15:43.205
I don't want you to assume that I think I've identified it now.

02:15:43.345 --> 02:15:51.109
I'm trying to start to exercise muscles that I haven't been exercising in a while, which is trying to think on their timescale

02:15:51.929 --> 02:15:53.810
and on their list of goals.

02:15:53.870 --> 02:16:01.454
And if I think about it that way, then I can see a very big advantage to what is happening on social media spontaneously.

02:16:01.894 --> 02:16:07.857
And that is that they are able to identify phenotypical groups of people and how they think.

02:16:08.017 --> 02:16:14.160
And then that grouping might be useful in identifying the genetic basis for those behaviors.

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:21.124
And if that is to be done in humans, this is the one of the best covert ways that I can think of doing it.

02:16:21.704 --> 02:16:32.516
Tricking people into accepting social media as the free speech forum and then getting them to behave very freely on that forum would give them a digital representation of our propensity to rebel.

02:16:33.518 --> 02:16:39.144
And then they can screen our kids for whether or not they inherited anything from us that seems to correlate with that behavior.

02:16:40.868 --> 02:16:41.769
It's just an idea.

02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:46.174
And then they could use this guy's gene drive to, in theory, knock it out in the next generation.

02:16:46.234 --> 02:16:47.616
Again, it's just a comic book.

02:16:48.176 --> 02:17:01.191
It's just a theorizing session that's designed to start to exercise the muscles necessary to think on their time scale, to think on their goal set.

02:17:03.012 --> 02:17:28.906
Because if we keep focusing on pandemics and on RNA camp pandemic and stuff like that, we're still on too narrow of a timescale to be able to see their movements and the coordination of their movements, the coordination of their ideologies or the idea set that they're... It's hard to see only in retrospect what they did with lab leak and natural virus over those years.

02:17:28.966 --> 02:17:30.447
Now, when we look back, we can see it.

02:17:31.227 --> 02:17:35.311
What can we see when we look back on the years of the social media?

02:17:35.351 --> 02:17:49.906
Well, we can see that they have screened us for our propensity to ask questions and to be willing to go to a new platform, to be willing to find a new set of people, a new set of friends, as opposed to the people who weren't willing to do that.

02:17:55.905 --> 02:18:03.890
And so watching how our kids grow up and how our kids behave will also give them some idea as to our ability to pass that on to the next generation.

02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:11.114
And if there is any genetic predisposition for it, they will be able to identify it on the scale of populations.

02:18:12.175 --> 02:18:21.601
They're not gonna be able to see it at all, the people like us, but in a group highly enriched for people who watch GigaOM, if there is any genetic basis

02:18:22.526 --> 02:18:31.725
then they will be able to find it across all of the different ethnicities and all of the different ages and all the different cultures that watch this little show.

02:18:32.667 --> 02:18:33.369
They can see it.

02:18:34.437 --> 02:18:48.242
And now think about what Joe Rogan has done for enriching a population of free thinking or conformist thinking or whatever they've done to manipulate those people and screen those people and tweak those people.

02:18:48.262 --> 02:18:51.963
Because every one of these podcasts is a potential experiment.

02:18:55.902 --> 02:19:25.782
like the people that they put in front of us at the last meeting with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., how many people went and subscribed to Michaela Peterson's podcast tells them something about those people's susceptibility to that kind of message and manipulation and their personal history across social media will give them some idea of what ideas and conversations led to them accepting the new people that were put in front of them in that meeting or subscribing to them and why we didn't.

02:19:25.862 --> 02:19:26.084
Thank you.

02:19:28.703 --> 02:19:45.074
And so these people have been making the argument behind the scenes that with AI and with tracking and with more data storage and with all this stuff, eventually we will reach a threshold where we will be able to use the information on social media to correlate with the genetic background of the people and their behavior.

02:19:45.094 --> 02:19:49.717
And we're going to be able to make useful progress for the human genome in ways that benefit us.

02:19:50.137 --> 02:19:57.702
And then we can tell NIH to look at these genes and say that they're involved in autism or say that they're involved in some genetic defect.

02:19:59.664 --> 02:20:18.117
Millions of academic biologists around the world will investigate these genes because we say they're important and in reality we know that we're looking for the genes that we need to segregate for, eliminate, gene drive out of the population when the gene drive system and methodology is finally up to snuff for humans.

02:20:19.358 --> 02:20:19.998
And then we'll do it.

02:20:22.099 --> 02:20:27.944
Just like when we finally are able to upload our consciousness like Kurtzweiler says, then we'll do it.

02:20:28.786 --> 02:20:30.407
and he just assumes it's gonna happen.

02:20:30.447 --> 02:20:35.850
This guy just assumes that gene drives are gonna get better and better and they're already reversible.

02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:37.391
It's 100% reversible.

02:20:37.431 --> 02:20:42.134
You just change the guide RNA and you can just reset whatever thing you screwed up.

02:20:42.695 --> 02:20:55.743
This is the level of arrogance and simplification and also exaggeration of understanding and fidelity of command over these irreducible complexities that all of these people have been bullying us to accept

02:20:56.323 --> 02:20:59.845
from biology 101 when we were in high school until right now.

02:21:03.026 --> 02:21:17.192
And so until we start thinking on the time scale of Teilhard de Chardin, we're not going to be seeing why this immunomythology is being taught to our children, why we are being coerced into teaching this immunomythology to our children.

02:21:17.232 --> 02:21:25.696
It's because we need to accept that the goal is taking over the evolution of mankind so that we can finally perfect

02:21:27.195 --> 02:21:27.782
ourselves.

02:21:30.239 --> 02:21:33.040
And that's not how we perfect ourselves, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:36.461
Perfecting ourselves is an individual spiritual journey.

02:21:36.781 --> 02:21:38.581
It is a family journey.

02:21:38.701 --> 02:21:43.022
It is a spouse and soulmate journey.

02:21:43.203 --> 02:21:46.623
It is a journey that a community makes.

02:21:46.683 --> 02:21:48.304
It is a journey that an individual makes.

02:21:48.384 --> 02:21:50.104
It's not a journey that a species makes.

02:21:50.264 --> 02:21:59.207
And certainly not at the behest of a few members of the species that have elevated themselves to believe that survival of the wisest

02:22:00.373 --> 02:22:01.314
And I'm the wisest.

02:22:01.954 --> 02:22:02.854
They're the wisest.

02:22:03.315 --> 02:22:06.056
George Church is the wisest.

02:22:06.096 --> 02:22:14.781
This is an incredibly long video, and I'm not going to watch any more of it for now, because I think it's worthwhile for you to investigate it yourself.

02:22:16.582 --> 02:22:19.063
And let me see if I know what I'm doing over here.

02:22:19.103 --> 02:22:19.603
Where are we?

02:22:19.663 --> 02:22:21.404
We do this, then we what?

02:22:21.865 --> 02:22:24.666
Do I need to do this?

02:22:25.066 --> 02:22:25.306
Yes.

02:22:25.907 --> 02:22:26.467
And then this.

02:22:27.568 --> 02:22:27.808
Right?

02:22:28.068 --> 02:22:28.128
No.

02:22:29.514 --> 02:22:30.195
What am I doing here?

02:22:30.295 --> 02:22:31.116
Oh, that's the other one.

02:22:31.136 --> 02:22:32.637
That's right, I screwed that up.

02:22:32.717 --> 02:22:36.741
Okay, so this is this one, and this one, and this one, and this one, and that one.

02:22:36.881 --> 02:22:37.302
There we go.

02:22:38.063 --> 02:22:45.871
So I really think it's vital that everybody try to visit the website.

02:22:46.806 --> 02:22:57.909
this slide here in particular, because again, it is important to understand the details of the last five years and how the last five years was run on us.

02:22:58.649 --> 02:23:08.412
It's important to understand that actuarially, meaning that the population had a bump in it, that they expected to increase all cause mortality, and they twisted that around to be a crisis.

02:23:09.292 --> 02:23:13.113
They had to murder some people to do it, to make the spikes a little better in New York City.

02:23:13.614 --> 02:23:18.876
But a consensus of lying about that around the world has resulted in the perception of a pandemic.

02:23:19.456 --> 02:23:27.559
And that probably was done in concert with a pre-existing background signal that was misconstrued as something novel and new.

02:23:28.579 --> 02:23:40.782
and that could have been explained very well by any of these actors if they just explained how PCR is used to get very high fidelity results on the academic bench and that all of those

02:23:42.122 --> 02:23:52.312
let's say subsets of the methodology or advances in the methodology were not applied to any of the diagnostics for COVID in 2020, 2021, or 2022 that are all gone now.

02:23:52.833 --> 02:23:57.998
And the list and define the many ways that even in its purest form, the RNA products would have never been appropriate.

02:23:58.038 --> 02:24:02.002
And that has a lot to do with how biologics are manufactured and

02:24:02.482 --> 02:24:07.608
anion exchange chromatography and how that just is irrelevant when you're making an mRNA because it won't work.

02:24:08.109 --> 02:24:17.419
And so then all of these, you know, things that are there now, or the discovery of double-stranded DNA is just one of a long list of shortcomings that were already there at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:24:17.459 --> 02:24:18.000
And anybody

02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:33.487
that worked for a pharmaceutical company before the pandemic or sold a pharmaceutical company would have done known that that was the case and how biologics are produced and how this mRNA would be produced and none of the purification methodologies could be used on it.

02:24:33.947 --> 02:24:38.249
So defining the countermeasures as transformations and transfections is also something

02:24:38.749 --> 02:24:53.383
that Mike Yeadon could have done in the beginning of the pandemic but didn't and I at first you know and I still haven't really questioned that although I think it's really important to see it as a data point that none of them have done it and they still won't do it even those that have talked to me for months or years.

02:24:53.883 --> 02:25:12.352
and in defining what an infectious clone is by just pointing out that it's just transfection and transformation and cell culture would have been a great way for any of these no virus people to avoid having to do stupid control experiments or having to write FOIA requests to all of these different governments if you just say this

02:25:13.493 --> 02:25:14.514
you're already done.

02:25:14.554 --> 02:25:30.576
The illusion of virology and the high fidelity of RNA pandemics is gone once you explain that any of these gain-of-function experiments rely on the synthetic manufacture of DNA and RNA in a pure form that can't exist in nature, can't be dug up or filtered.

02:25:32.875 --> 02:25:37.136
And that's why talking about endemicity was the goal in the beginning.

02:25:37.176 --> 02:25:45.718
The scary part that Garrett talked about in the 2019 CNN documentary, it's all the same illusion.

02:25:45.798 --> 02:25:51.760
They can take a background signal and say that it's spreading everywhere if you don't have any data.

02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:52.880
And you don't.

02:25:53.921 --> 02:25:55.161
They don't either, they didn't need any.

02:25:56.189 --> 02:26:04.452
They just needed to coordinatedly lie about 2020 and 2021 until the clock had run out far enough so that nobody wanted to bother asking any questions.

02:26:05.472 --> 02:26:15.775
And saying the COVID shot is bad and screaming it from the top of the rooftops is the defining attribute of anybody that has risen in social media and has a voice.

02:26:15.955 --> 02:26:17.936
And that's the reason why you can see it's wrong.

02:26:18.971 --> 02:26:23.334
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, about transfection and about RNA.

02:26:23.874 --> 02:26:27.797
If you liked what you saw, please go to GigaOM Biological and find a way to support the stream.

02:26:27.837 --> 02:26:31.540
November 3rd, we're having a live live stream in Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh.

02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:34.382
If you'd like to come, please send me an email and figure out how to do it.

02:26:34.862 --> 02:26:37.204
I hope we can have hundreds of people there.

02:26:37.244 --> 02:26:39.405
We have the capacity for 250 people.

02:26:39.866 --> 02:26:42.488
I don't have that much room at my house or my backyard.

02:26:43.228 --> 02:26:45.869
there's a lot of problems that everybody's gonna need to solve on their own.

02:26:46.290 --> 02:27:03.419
But if you can come to the area of Pittsburgh in the first weekend of November and be around maybe for the Brownstone on the first and the second and wanna be present on the third, you know, you could come to the Brownstone meeting and just sit outside and carry a sign that says, clownstone is fake, prove me wrong.

02:27:03.479 --> 02:27:06.501
And that could be what you do on Friday and what you do on Saturday.

02:27:06.521 --> 02:27:08.802
You could see me outside, we could have lunch.

02:27:08.842 --> 02:27:10.243
And then on Sunday, we can all,

02:27:10.743 --> 02:27:13.665
gather in Bethel Park for the live live stream.

02:27:13.745 --> 02:27:14.886
Anyway, thanks for joining me.

02:27:15.787 --> 02:27:21.471
If you wanna share, stream.gigaohm.bio is working well, but it's starting to reach its capacity.

02:27:21.511 --> 02:27:23.892
So Ted and I need some more feedback.

02:27:23.912 --> 02:27:28.996
We're gonna probably turn on the metrics there so that we can see what's working hard and what's not working hard.

02:27:30.357 --> 02:27:36.241
I expect, for example, that two hours and 30 minutes is gonna test it a little bit on transcoding, but we'll see what happens.

02:27:36.281 --> 02:27:36.822
Thank you very much.

02:27:36.862 --> 02:27:38.543
And I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

02:29:35.011 --> 02:29:36.252
Thank you guys very much.

02:29:36.352 --> 02:29:40.397
Good to see you Vilma and Idaho, Garden Girl and all y'all.

02:29:41.578 --> 02:29:42.459
Really great to see you.

02:29:42.759 --> 02:29:43.620
I'll see you again tomorrow.
