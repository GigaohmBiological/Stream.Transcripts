WEBVTT

00:20.006 --> 00:36.336
I have no- I have no responsibility for the current- STOP LYING!

00:50.145 --> 00:57.867
This is a test.

01:02.248 --> 01:07.289
This is a test.

01:31.815 --> 01:37.237
So for what it's worth, I mean, it's such a chaotic scene right now.

01:37.397 --> 01:43.060
It seems like, you know, intentionally, obviously, it's only going to get worse with the election coming up.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.562
I still, you know, I don't follow very many people anymore.

01:48.022 --> 01:48.643
I just follow like 22.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.703
If I follow somebody, I trust them.

01:53.304 --> 02:06.834
As far as I know, as much as it depends on my knowledge and sense of things, it's not that I agree with everything that person says necessarily, but that person is, they are who they say they are.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.595
They are authentic.

02:10.197 --> 02:18.163
I admit that I'm biased because I know that, especially Jonathan Engler, I know him well.

02:19.051 --> 02:22.894
so and have, you know, for a year plus.

02:23.655 --> 02:35.064
So, you know, if Jonathan Engler turns out to be, you know, something that he's not or some kind of manipulator, I mean, I would be devastated.

02:35.084 --> 02:42.450
I would be absolutely devastated and probably, you know, quit this whole thing and be like, okay, then I don't know anybody, then I can't tell anything.

02:43.210 --> 02:58.256
So that doesn't mean that you have to see it the same way, you know Martin saying like as much as far as I know Martin and Norman Fenton are putting you know, they put their sub sacks over the past four years Into a book.

02:58.276 --> 03:12.041
I mean, I've read the I skimmed the book and the chapter or excuse me that paper that they that Jonathan and Martin just wrote where they included your work it's going into

03:12.779 --> 03:19.385
that book and content that I wrote with them is going into that book.

03:19.405 --> 03:22.208
Martin's in the academic world.

03:22.288 --> 03:25.511
He was finishing marking up papers this week.

03:26.912 --> 03:31.557
He does play things a little closer to the vest.

03:31.757 --> 03:34.680
That is the way he is on social media.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.850
My experiences with him have been very good.

03:38.110 --> 03:44.594
So yeah, if those guys are like playing me or using me or who knows, right.

03:44.674 --> 04:00.383
Again, I don't know what, I don't know what to say, but I would, I would continue if I were, I can't tell you what to do, but I would continue to give them, I recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt until there's really, really good reason not to.

04:02.489 --> 04:05.290
Catherine Watt's an interesting one for me.

04:05.490 --> 04:08.891
I mean, I replied to her on Sage Hanna's SubStack.

04:09.311 --> 04:16.372
I actually blocked Sage Hanna, but because he told me he didn't care if I got shot in the head or some kind of crazy nonsense.

04:16.412 --> 04:17.973
I have no idea who runs that SubStack.

04:18.773 --> 04:22.434
I think Catherine's legitimate.

04:22.514 --> 04:29.115
I don't understand the role of Sasha Latupova 100%, but I've been honest about that with people about what I think is going on there.

04:31.576 --> 04:31.816
Again,

04:33.101 --> 04:45.406
I head down, I'm, I'm really trying to focus on what I'm doing and what I do well as much as possible, because I believe that that will bring the best result.

04:45.586 --> 04:49.727
And you've been really formative, you know, for, for me.

04:49.768 --> 04:53.449
And I think a lot of other people, and you've taken the hits, not, not just with the clone.

04:54.016 --> 05:04.460
stuff or the possibilities of, you know, building a biological bridge there with the clone, but you've been helpful in helping people see who some of these players really are.

05:04.480 --> 05:09.723
You know, I think that in some ways is probably your best, you know, biggest contribution.

05:09.783 --> 05:12.924
And I've tried to honor that and cite you where and when I can.

05:13.044 --> 05:19.587
So, you know, I only know who I am and I'm legit.

05:19.607 --> 05:21.528
Okay.

05:21.548 --> 05:22.008
Have a good day.

05:35.496 --> 05:37.377
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

05:37.477 --> 05:42.779
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

05:43.640 --> 05:50.383
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

05:57.070 --> 06:02.691
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

06:02.951 --> 06:08.893
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

06:09.813 --> 06:13.974
Well, I guess I would ask myself, I mean, I lie.

06:13.994 --> 06:16.714
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

06:16.734 --> 06:18.715
I really try not to.

06:18.735 --> 06:20.695
I try never to lie on TV.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.475
I don't like lying.

06:22.595 --> 06:25.656
I certainly do it out of weakness or whatever.

06:28.891 --> 06:32.895
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

06:33.116 --> 06:34.677
That's a very nice compliment.

06:34.697 --> 06:35.358
Thank you very much.

06:35.418 --> 06:36.639
Can you hear me better now or not?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.521
Yes, much better.

06:38.602 --> 06:47.031
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

06:47.351 --> 06:50.875
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

06:57.805 --> 07:01.706
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:03.527 --> 07:04.227
And I have lied.

07:04.247 --> 07:05.288
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:05.308 --> 07:06.988
I don't want to lie, you know.

07:07.268 --> 07:08.069
I don't think I'm a liar.

07:08.169 --> 07:09.209
I try not to be a liar.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.089
I don't want to be a liar.

07:10.649 --> 07:13.430
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:17.052 --> 07:18.012
There are no ethics.

07:18.052 --> 07:20.773
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

07:22.073 --> 07:27.015
It is all about the utilitarian means justify the ends.

07:32.483 --> 07:46.927
The specialization should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious, and that's sort of my starting bias.

07:46.967 --> 07:58.471
The specialization should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious, and that's

07:59.011 --> 08:01.392
That's sort of my starting bias.

08:01.532 --> 08:10.276
Specialization should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

08:10.716 --> 08:12.657
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

08:12.697 --> 08:15.218
And that's sort of my starting bias.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.722
A condition that we will not call autism.

08:41.882 --> 08:43.422
I don't like the word autism.

08:44.302 --> 08:45.342
He was vaccine damaged.

08:45.703 --> 08:47.123
He was neurologically damaged.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.470
condition that we will not call autism.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.275
I don't like the word autism.

08:53.198 --> 08:54.181
He was vaccine damaged.

08:57.385 --> 08:59.467
condition that we will not call autism.

08:59.627 --> 09:01.168
I don't like the word autism.

09:02.089 --> 09:03.010
He was vaccine damaged.

09:03.771 --> 09:05.652
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

09:05.753 --> 09:18.725
His name is JJ Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

09:18.765 --> 09:20.827
He was vaccine damaged.

09:57.324 --> 09:57.604
you.

10:28.541 --> 10:47.076
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

10:47.376 --> 10:49.357
It's just a big hassle in the end.

10:49.978 --> 10:55.722
But no, when, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and

11:02.313 --> 11:05.658
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

11:05.718 --> 11:08.221
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.019
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

11:18.239 --> 11:18.699
It can't.

11:19.340 --> 11:23.103
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

11:24.003 --> 11:28.167
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

11:30.308 --> 11:33.611
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

11:33.831 --> 11:34.291
It can't.

11:34.932 --> 11:38.655
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

11:38.675 --> 11:43.679
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

11:45.709 --> 11:46.209
Actually, J.J.

11:46.229 --> 11:52.872
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.754
I think truth is good for kids.

11:58.194 --> 12:02.056
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

12:02.496 --> 12:04.717
We want everybody to feel good.

12:05.037 --> 12:06.497
That's not the way life is.

12:11.779 --> 12:12.520
He introduced

12:13.581 --> 12:32.095
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

12:32.115 --> 12:36.578
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

12:37.213 --> 12:38.514
a panel that we have.

12:38.614 --> 12:43.335
Each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

12:43.595 --> 12:49.737
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

12:49.777 --> 12:55.359
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

12:56.040 --> 13:04.323
He was one of the co-founders of Plastic, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

13:05.843 --> 13:18.689
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

13:20.041 --> 13:39.363
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

13:50.492 --> 13:54.604
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

13:55.248 --> 13:58.730
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

13:58.990 --> 14:00.031
But this one is pretty cool.

14:00.391 --> 14:03.132
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

14:03.852 --> 14:07.114
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.176
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the Queen.

14:10.216 --> 14:15.218
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

14:15.518 --> 14:17.960
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

14:17.980 --> 14:20.201
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

14:28.298 --> 14:34.440
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.542
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.135
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

14:56.175 --> 14:57.057
Welcome to the show.

14:57.117 --> 15:05.170
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist where we're seeking the truth together.

15:05.190 --> 15:07.413
Again, welcome to the show.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.335
My name.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.903
excuse me, is Jonathan Cooey.

15:11.943 --> 15:13.924
I'm chief biologist at GigaOM Biological.

15:13.964 --> 15:17.266
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

15:17.326 --> 15:23.368
Those photos were taken when I was still an Akata magician at the time in Norway.

15:24.009 --> 15:29.311
There you can see my inverted image in the eye of a halibut recently caught by myself.

15:30.432 --> 15:37.875
Anyway, if you want to find my long track record as an Akata magician, you can look on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

15:38.536 --> 15:51.077
Search for my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, my first initials, J-J, in that search bar and you will find all the publications associated with my work, including the one that got me involved in that group called Drastic, which

15:52.206 --> 15:53.307
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:53.347 --> 16:09.084
being on a national security script agreed was a great group of, you know, scientists and smart people whistleblowing on a gain-of-function virus leak, which of course is a national security narrative based in no real biology.

16:09.664 --> 16:13.788
I've tried to explain this at least three times to the group called Panda based out of

16:14.449 --> 16:34.078
South Africa, however they lost all three of those presentations and instead people like Germ Warfare and Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler have been masquerading as people with meaningful ideas and meaningful insight usually by pirating some small fractured

16:35.939 --> 16:38.760
piece of my ideas or my wordage, my verbiage.

16:39.521 --> 16:47.905
I presented to the NCI, but of course that's a ridiculous organization who has no message and has done no summary.

16:47.945 --> 16:52.847
I presented actually to the steering committee or whatever they were called of the wellness company.

16:52.887 --> 16:59.631
They offered me sponsorship a few times through a couple of their people, including Paul Alexander.

17:00.671 --> 17:01.772
I always turned it down.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.353
I've worked for Children's Health Defense.

17:04.393 --> 17:05.473
I didn't turn them down.

17:05.513 --> 17:07.574
I also did not turn Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.315
down when he asked me to help him write his book.

17:09.855 --> 17:15.477
However, in the process of writing that book, I also taught myself enough biology to know that RNA cannot pandemic.

17:15.997 --> 17:30.966
and tried to teach everybody involved with that book that that was true and unfortunately that didn't matter because the goal was to get me to be the guy that could go on podcasts and tell everybody all about how there was a lab leak and they covered it up.

17:31.066 --> 17:35.529
Instead I went on the Red Pill Expo and told everybody that I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:35.589 --> 17:38.251
is a scripted liar and I think behind him are

17:39.011 --> 17:59.996
people like Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project and of DITRA respectively and unfortunately that message went nowhere and so now I've been practicing basketball for the last year or so trying to get my 53 year old butt back in shape so that I can teach biology from the hardwood and maybe somewhere along the way we'll meet some

18:00.456 --> 18:15.532
patriots in America who are interested in dispelling the mythology that is public health and our ridiculous vaccine schedule in America, and dispelling the mythology behind the fake health freedom movement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:15.552 --> 18:15.753
and the

18:17.254 --> 18:21.336
Ridiculous people that are propped up on podcasts all around the internet.

18:22.316 --> 18:23.817
We know how this works.

18:23.897 --> 18:25.037
This is the way it works.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.358
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

18:27.418 --> 18:28.758
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

18:28.798 --> 18:30.159
Transfection is a crime.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.500
And population pyramids are real.

18:32.560 --> 18:38.882
If you like what you hear or like what you hear in the next two hours or so, please go to GigaOMBiological.com.

18:38.922 --> 18:40.623
Find a way to support the work.

18:41.683 --> 18:49.244
If you haven't already, download the PeerTube app and then direct that app to stream.gigaohm.bio as a platform.

18:49.905 --> 18:54.905
And then all of my work will be instantly on your phone with no personal data shared.

18:55.986 --> 19:03.987
One of the best ways to be on the internet without using corporate social media, which is of course a military social control suite.

19:05.127 --> 19:07.348
It is definitely a trap.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.828
So get you and your kids out

19:14.282 --> 19:35.312
I don't care how you get there.

19:35.332 --> 19:38.033
I don't care what you do to get there.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.614
The goal is to win.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.225
What time is it?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.010
Game time!

20:15.573 --> 20:38.460
I get so lost sometimes Days pass And this emptiness fills my heart When I want to run away I drive off in my car

20:43.922 --> 21:13.136
But whichever way I go I come back to the place you are All my instincts, they return The grand facade, so soon will burn Without noise, without my pride I'll reach out for means

21:22.595 --> 21:45.872
In your eyes, the light, the heat Your eyes, I am complete In your eyes, I see the doorway In your eyes, the thousand churches In your eyes, the resolution In your eyes, of all the fruitless searches In your eyes, I see the light and the heat In your eyes,

21:47.988 --> 21:56.918
Oh, I wanna be that complete I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

22:22.180 --> 22:47.483
I don't like to see so much pain So much wasted And this moment keeps slipping away I get so tired Working so hard for our survival

22:50.780 --> 23:10.578
I look to the time of year To keep me awake and alive And all my instincts, they return And the grand facade, so soon will burn

23:12.227 --> 23:38.555
Without a noise Without my pride I reach on from the inside In your eyes In your eyes In your eyes In your eyes In your eyes

23:45.526 --> 24:13.455
In your eyes I see the doorway To a thousand churches In your eyes The resolution In your eyes Of all the fruitless searches Oh, I see the light and the heat In your eyes Oh, I wanna be that complete In your eyes I wanna touch the light, the heat I see In your eyes

25:07.879 --> 25:08.780
Good evening, ladies.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.360
Good morning.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.301
Good afternoon.

25:10.742 --> 25:11.743
Good to see everyone.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.004
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

25:13.184 --> 25:14.185
Thanks for being here.

25:14.745 --> 25:27.877
There are few things more dishonorable than misleading the young, and make no mistake about it, by very careful military scripted design, we are essentially on the same team

25:28.858 --> 25:38.426
as the Soph character that played a role in Alex Jones' show in 2019, and Robert Malone.

25:38.466 --> 25:45.412
We are on the same team as these people by script, and they are all actually traitors to our children.

25:45.452 --> 25:51.637
And here you can see Brett Weinstein admitting that this is potentially the scripted end of the West.

25:52.958 --> 25:58.302
And he is, of course, a part of this, connected through his brother and Peter Thiel and their father.

25:59.821 --> 26:02.444
who's directly connected to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

26:02.424 --> 26:12.835
's dad, and of course, the probably murdered Estes Kefauver, who nobody wants to talk about, and that alone is an admission.

26:13.255 --> 26:15.778
They can only make admissions after many years of lies.

26:17.148 --> 26:19.691
Kevin McKernan being at the center of many of these things.

26:19.771 --> 26:26.737
Kevin McKernan... Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught with... Kevin McKernan would not otherwise exist if it wasn't for me.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.140
Someone else would be doing what he's done.

26:29.480 --> 26:38.208
And this November 2024 podcast, where he essentially admits that there is a script behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:38.929 --> 26:41.211
and Jay Bhattacharya that he is involved in.

26:42.092 --> 26:59.252
And the fact of the matter goes that his father already was involved in microwave technology, probably one of the reasons that enabled him to drop out of college and become the research and development director or something like that, under the tutelage of Matt Lander and

27:01.061 --> 27:04.403
or Mark Lander, excuse me, and Francis Collins.

27:05.124 --> 27:21.454
And this is Kevin McKernan, who I think is one of the smarter people behind the fake anti-vax movement that is best personified or exemplified by the organizations ICANN and Children's Health Defense.

27:21.774 --> 27:27.478
And at the start of the pandemic, I think the intention was to have ICANN and Children's Health Defense

27:28.298 --> 27:38.421
be the primary organizations that would play the role of EpiGirl and, you know, a limited spectrum of debate about the skepticism to the COVID vaccine.

27:39.082 --> 27:42.403
And instead, things went wildly out of control.

27:43.163 --> 27:54.907
And as a result, they were never able to recruit an actor that would be naive enough to play the role that they, in the end, put this guy on the Danny Jones podcast.

27:54.967 --> 27:55.587
Now, remember,

27:57.088 --> 28:15.121
Remember that Danny Jones is actually a guy who admitted why he went into podcasting on the Joe Rogan show like six months ago and that admission included being a down-the-street neighbor of Hulk Hogan who we know was a beneficiary of a

28:17.466 --> 28:27.234
lawsuit against a internet news source called Gawker that had outed Peter Thiel as the gay space vampire that he is.

28:27.954 --> 28:46.489
And because they outed him as an alien lycanthrope who's also a homosexual, he decided to burn that internet platform by suing on behalf of Hulk Hogan or paying for Hulk Hogan's lawyers

28:47.149 --> 28:53.935
because Hulk Hogan had previously had a video of some kind exposed by Gawker.

28:53.975 --> 29:06.127
And so, whereas the space vampire homosexual Peter Thiel had no claim against Gawker because he was indeed a homosexual space vampire,

29:08.021 --> 29:13.863
the release of this sex tape of Hulk Hogan gave him a valid claim against them.

29:13.903 --> 29:18.765
And so Peter Thiel paid his lawyers and he won a big lawsuit.

29:18.825 --> 29:28.309
And so Hulk Hogan was in debt to Peter Thiel and may explain why he spoke, for example, at the Republican National Convention.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.190
But nevertheless,

29:29.850 --> 29:55.023
It's interesting to note that he went into podcasting, you know, and kind of told a story kind of about Hulk Hogan and which kind of means that maybe he's part of this podcast network that's probably loosely organized around Austin and all the clowns in Austin that of course include a lot of the anti-vaxx movement, old school, OG, old gangsters are in.

29:55.823 --> 30:07.711
Austin including Paulie Tommy and Andrew Wakefield, but also Joe Rogan is there a lot of podcasts are there Eric Weinstein is there, you know, this is where Elon Musk moved.

30:07.771 --> 30:14.075
I mean, it's all just kind of weird Because it's all one show and then it's not so weird.

30:14.636 --> 30:16.017
And so what he's gonna do here is

30:17.136 --> 30:21.617
is basically discredit everything that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:21.757 --> 30:28.320
is, and specifically discredit a book which was released around the time of the election called The Wuhan Cover-Up.

30:29.000 --> 30:44.685
And he discredits it on its face by claiming that somebody who was fired during the writing of the book actually helped with the writing of the book, and then specifically making two claims, sort of explanatory claims that, curiously enough, are precisely

30:45.866 --> 30:50.142
two of six explanatory claims that I am quoted

30:51.247 --> 30:55.170
as delineating in the book of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:55.590 --> 31:01.935
Actually quoted, listed in the index as being ideas that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:01.995 --> 31:05.198
got from this guy listed as an expert in the book.

31:05.758 --> 31:19.789
And instead, he goes on a podcast with a dude who didn't go into podcasting until Hulk Hogan and the space vampire Peter Thiel decided to recommend that he do that instead of advertising and making films for advertisements.

31:21.874 --> 31:42.106
This guy goes on there to completely contradict that book and therefore completely discredit the Health and Human Services Secretary's book that is put out on behalf of Children's Health Defense, supposedly the premier non-profit in America that is, I guess, somehow or another acting on behalf of Children's Health.

31:43.829 --> 31:58.339
America is being undermined by actors on the internet and the absurdity of their script suggests to me that they never intended for any of these people to be on stage this long and maybe this guy never at all.

31:59.329 --> 32:03.073
but instead he found himself opposite Danny Jones.

32:03.293 --> 32:13.543
Again, a guy who can be directly, not using the Kevin Bacon game, but directly using Hulk Hogan to Peter Thiel connection to podcasting.

32:14.246 --> 32:24.534
You know, this network of fake people on fake scripts that are there to get you to ask the wrong questions and ponder very deeply the wrong answers.

32:24.654 --> 32:30.778
This guy who worked for the Human Genome Project is the best evidence that America as a whole

32:31.579 --> 32:51.529
has been undermined by a fake conservative movement just in the same way that before the pandemic there was this fake anti-vax movement that was for all practical purposes undermining any reasonable inspection of the current vaccine schedule that existed in let's say 2015.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.066
Brian Hooker was already there.

32:56.286 --> 32:57.367
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:57.407 --> 32:58.187
was already there.

32:58.767 --> 32:59.588
Democracy Now!

32:59.628 --> 33:00.328
was already there.

33:00.408 --> 33:01.709
Paul Offit was already there.

33:01.769 --> 33:03.170
Mary Holland was already there.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.491
Meryl Nass was already there.

33:04.531 --> 33:09.334
And those same actors are performing the same script now, 10 years later.

33:09.374 --> 33:10.754
And that's not by accident.

33:13.896 --> 33:20.320
It's because we were supposed to have gone all the way headlong into the trap during the pandemic.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.682
And there weren't supposed to be anybody outside of the trap anymore.

33:25.871 --> 33:37.377
So those few of us that are out here and that can see this and show it to other people can give evidence directly for there being a national security script behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.638
and Jay Bhattacharya and therefore

33:41.172 --> 33:47.414
that's all coffee, likely a national security script behind Donald Trump as well.

33:47.875 --> 33:48.735
This is a joke.

33:48.795 --> 33:54.417
And that would also explain the incredible incompetence of, of, of Harris and Biden.

33:54.897 --> 33:58.478
It's just all one national security theater.

34:00.419 --> 34:05.741
And they really needed somebody else besides this guy to do this because it's just a disaster.

34:05.821 --> 34:06.862
This is forever.

34:06.882 --> 34:10.343
This video right here is all the evidence you will ever need.

34:12.950 --> 34:14.291
how to create the coronavirus.

34:28.604 --> 34:38.467
And Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

34:38.507 --> 34:41.968
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan, it's going through some intermediary.

34:42.868 --> 34:54.671
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

34:55.772 --> 34:59.876
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

35:01.097 --> 35:05.761
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it, necessarily, from a laboratory.

35:06.602 --> 35:13.488
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

35:14.349 --> 35:16.791
If you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

35:16.872 --> 35:20.395
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

35:21.257 --> 35:26.635
And Charles Rixey's a marine and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

35:27.666 --> 35:30.288
And he was the one who leaked the diffuse proposal.

35:30.548 --> 35:31.989
Are you familiar with the diffuse proposal?

35:32.009 --> 35:32.649
No, what is that?

35:32.830 --> 35:45.778
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of, we need to build a vaccine against this, because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

35:46.279 --> 35:49.120
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

35:50.201 --> 35:51.362
You'll have something to leak from this.

35:53.083 --> 35:56.846
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.547
I've got like $30 million in grants from NIH.

35:59.927 --> 36:02.389
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

36:02.889 --> 36:04.209
It's just you.

36:05.650 --> 36:11.113
This is the first thing that I'm quoted in the book as saying, and again, it's one of the six actual quotes.

36:11.373 --> 36:15.535
I explain how, generally speaking, NIH grants are done.

36:16.416 --> 36:21.018
And so it's kind of comical that he says this because it's not an NIH grant that we're talking about.

36:21.038 --> 36:23.439
We're talking about a DARPA grant, which is quite a bit different.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.221
And again, if they could have had me,

36:27.347 --> 36:31.368
on the Danny Jones podcast saying this and claiming that RFK Jr.'

36:31.348 --> 36:41.491
's book is right, they wouldn't need to have him on the podcast opposite the Hulk Hogan, Peter Thiel puppet.

36:41.871 --> 36:45.452
They wouldn't have to have him opposite Danny Jones, they would have me.

36:46.693 --> 36:54.855
But instead they have him opposite Danny Jones in November of 2024 saying a fired Charles Rixey

36:55.618 --> 36:59.400
was actually the one who helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:59.440 --> 37:15.307
write his book, and then goes on to explain an exact sort of misquote as if it's his idea, when in fact it is the exact quote, one of only six, that I am quoted of as explaining in the book.

37:15.407 --> 37:20.830
And the other one, which is coming up, is how restriction enzymes work.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.811
And my explanation in the book is,

37:24.011 --> 37:28.112
It's choice, and what he says is just plain dumb.

37:28.592 --> 37:30.533
It works, but it's weak.

37:31.253 --> 37:39.856
And so, again, what we're dealing with here is a scripted actor, someone desperately trying to keep the car on the road.

37:40.476 --> 37:43.637
But it's off the road, and it's been off the road for years already.

37:46.239 --> 38:01.143
It's wonderful and it's also scary because any newspaper in America, any news source in America could have figured this out by now with my help or without my help, just watching my streams and checking my work.

38:03.144 --> 38:04.244
But no one's done it.

38:05.745 --> 38:10.306
No one has responded to my emails, my phone calls, my text messages.

38:10.406 --> 38:13.767
No one's seeing that this is the story right here.

38:15.100 --> 38:18.803
that the national security scripted actor Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:18.924 --> 38:36.600
and the absolute fraud Jay Bhattacharya at the head of NIH can be explained via Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and a network of people behind a fake health freedom movement and a fake anti-vax movement that is just part and parcel

38:38.786 --> 38:43.453
for the same national security script that ran the pandemic in the first place.

38:43.493 --> 38:47.539
That's why this resistance is so seamlessly neutered.

38:49.141 --> 38:51.665
So seamlessly lacking progress.

38:53.226 --> 39:08.116
and is culminating with a former Research and Development Director, supposedly, of the Human Genome Project, kinda sorta whistleblowing on a DNA contamination in the transfection that he, for six years, can't call a transfection.

39:08.516 --> 39:15.001
That he, for six years, has been bouncing from podcast to podcast to podcast to obfuscate the truth about.

39:15.902 --> 39:23.808
There's no way to explain six years of podcasting for this guy, except by national security script.

39:24.248 --> 39:33.776
The same goes for Jill Glasspool Malone, the same goes for Merrill Nass, the same goes for Robert Malone, and the same goes for Stephen Hatfield.

39:36.325 --> 39:53.932
There's no way to explain the presence of Stephen Hatfield on podcasts, the presence of Stephen Hatfield in international COVID summits like in Romania, on stage with a lot of these other people, except because they are national security actors.

39:55.919 --> 40:10.483
And if we don't wake up to this, if the world doesn't wake up to this, then whatever plan is being orchestrated and puppeted by the puppet hand inside of America is going to be executed flawlessly over the next five years.

40:10.563 --> 40:20.706
However, if you can wake up and apologize to your kids and realize that the only way Donald Trump is at the helm is if it's by national security script,

40:21.226 --> 40:30.849
that includes the controlled demolition of America, the destruction of American culture by Americans themselves, then I can't help you.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.489
Social media has trapped you.

40:32.529 --> 40:33.930
But here's your evidence right here.

40:34.050 --> 40:35.430
Kevin McKernan.

40:35.490 --> 40:42.913
There's nothing you can find on the internet that will support any other conclusion other than he is a scripted national security actor.

40:44.693 --> 40:50.135
And his specific interactions with me are just absolutely, they're just damning.

40:50.987 --> 40:54.271
He's a criminal, along with a lot of these other people.

40:55.832 --> 40:56.653
You're looking for the last 20%.

40:58.095 --> 40:59.757
Because you just can't.

40:59.777 --> 41:09.127
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows we can get X'd on, we've demonstrated this piece, we've demonstrated this piece.

41:09.528 --> 41:10.929
Now we just need to do this last piece.

41:12.190 --> 41:18.213
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

41:18.353 --> 41:21.515
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

41:22.835 --> 41:26.337
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

41:26.957 --> 41:32.540
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but- Now the absurdity is getting worse, right?

41:32.580 --> 41:41.084
Because as he talks about the diffuse proposal, it's important to realize that Charles Rixey supposedly is the guy who blew the whistle, but also Veritas.

41:42.179 --> 41:45.901
You know, the same guy that blew the whistle on Acorn, supposedly.

41:48.663 --> 41:49.623
Yes, that's correct.

41:49.683 --> 41:51.004
It's all the same script.

41:51.064 --> 41:54.186
It's all the same, it's all the same timeline.

41:55.546 --> 42:06.312
Actors put in place, stunts happening, then the stage is cleared, new scenery's put on, the same actors come out, they do the same shtick, and you don't see it.

42:08.413 --> 42:11.215
And in the pandemic, they just flooded the stage with actors.

42:12.153 --> 42:36.152
Flooded the stage with actors and they even put out side stages all over the place So there were opening bands and and side stages and performers over there and magicians over there And so the whole thing has been set up to be one giant fire hose of nonsense and if you get to the core of it anywhere you're gonna find one of these national security actors on a script and

42:37.506 --> 42:41.328
That's the design of social media, not the internet.

42:41.348 --> 42:44.409
The internet can be free, but social media cannot be free.

42:44.510 --> 42:46.210
It is by definition not free.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.391
And in fact, it's worse.

42:48.011 --> 42:58.356
It is a puppet show where they pretend that there's some algorithm over which they have no control that kind of decides how the content is distributed when that's absolute nonsense.

42:58.396 --> 43:04.980
He's been seen by millions of people, if not tens of millions of people all around the world by design.

43:05.580 --> 43:13.905
because he is an American national security actor that has been in the employ of the Department of Energy since he was a young man.

43:13.925 --> 43:17.167
And so was his father.

43:20.629 --> 43:30.675
As an American, I am pleading to you, whoever can hear this, if whatever country you're in, whatever planet you're on, whatever starship,

43:31.843 --> 43:38.727
Whatever galactic federation you serve, please come and help the Earth, because the Earth is under attack right now.

43:39.508 --> 43:53.237
We're under attack by some kind of nameless technocracy that has employed a lot of actors that have been connected to this mythology since the 50s, because their parents were connected to this stuff since the 50s.

43:53.377 --> 43:54.057
It's crazy!

43:54.157 --> 43:55.638
Sam Harris' mom!

43:56.219 --> 43:59.401
Why didn't somebody else figure out Sam Harris' mom?

44:01.314 --> 44:03.000
Why did Housatonic live?

44:03.040 --> 44:07.577
Why did Mark Kulak have to send me Sam Harris's mom's Wikipedia page?

44:13.512 --> 44:18.874
your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain letters.

44:19.534 --> 44:20.634
Those are what restrictions are.

44:20.814 --> 44:22.695
So imagine you can only cut and paste where there's a the.

44:23.536 --> 44:29.758
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

44:30.298 --> 44:37.001
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with their, which is a couple more letters.

44:37.721 --> 44:40.283
And we're going to use those enzymes to compute.

44:40.323 --> 44:41.805
By doing that, we can assemble this genome.

44:41.825 --> 44:48.190
Well, they had certain restriction enzymes in that diffuse proposal that are present in coronavirus that's currently circulating.

44:48.570 --> 44:52.433
And that was kind of the smoking gun that showed that, okay, this was in fact assembled.

44:52.634 --> 44:54.355
It was a product of the diffuse proposal.

44:54.435 --> 44:57.518
Someone eventually carried out that grant application to it.

44:58.118 --> 45:14.060
Final conclusion and that's why I'm actually circulating And Rixie has the whole story on this you want to talk to him and Alex Washburn Alex Washburn did some really interesting work Mapping out the frequencies of these cut sites in all other coronaviruses

45:15.077 --> 45:17.659
And only in SARS-CoV-2 do they exist.

45:17.919 --> 45:19.220
See, so that's really dumb.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.882
Why would Alex Washburn be the guy to do that?

45:21.922 --> 45:25.865
You can look at his academic record and you can see that he's not a virologist.

45:25.925 --> 45:37.393
And anyone, anyone who knows anything about working with DNA sequences using any one of the open source, you know, little softwares, it's just working with text files.

45:38.653 --> 45:39.214
Anyone.

45:40.373 --> 45:44.876
could do what Alex Washburn apparently was the only one who did it.

45:45.296 --> 45:52.280
He compared across coronaviruses and he found this signal where there is these, you know, little segments and it looks like they just put it together.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.641
Cause that's how that Noam Siem technique works.

45:54.721 --> 45:56.862
And you're just going to have to take my word for it.

45:56.922 --> 45:57.863
Wow.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.504
It's so amazing.

45:59.804 --> 46:01.005
Dang man.

46:01.025 --> 46:03.106
And it's just ridiculous.

46:03.306 --> 46:06.668
It's ridiculous because the one thing that that means,

46:09.721 --> 46:30.232
The one thing that that means is that they had a 100% reliable sequence upon which to analyze, because if this was a real virus, whatever that is, whatever it could have purported to be before the pandemic, it would have been a non-specific signal.

46:31.809 --> 46:41.822
where only the most conserved regions of the genome would be represented in high enough fidelity to be amplified and read.

46:43.686 --> 47:07.442
And so the idea that they have this sequence called SARS-CoV-2, and they can be, without a shadow of a doubt, certain about all these very specific sequences, which correspond to very specific restriction enzyme, you know, it's multiple bases, not necessarily overlapping that the sequences can be specific for.

47:07.482 --> 47:09.823
So we're talking about some pretty crazy things.

47:10.264 --> 47:13.446
And then to top that all off, there's a video of

47:15.609 --> 47:26.629
There's a video of Ralph Baric explaining the no-seum technique and explaining how it works and it's... well, it's not quite as simple as restriction enzymes and stuff like that.

47:27.898 --> 47:29.259
And that's unfortunate, right?

47:29.319 --> 47:47.434
That whole part of this is unfortunate because if Ralph Baric is on the same national security script that Tony Fauci is and that Peter Daszak of 60 Minutes fame is, don't forget that 60 Minutes just told us a whole hour about Jared Kushner being the hero of Gaza and Israel.

47:48.740 --> 47:52.021
Also told us that George Webb was a weirdo in February of 2020.

47:52.681 --> 47:55.282
Also told us that Peter Daszak was a virologist.

47:55.822 --> 47:59.604
Also even told us about Nathan Wolf being a virologist.

48:01.604 --> 48:14.069
And so don't be surprised if next year Kevin McKernan is on 60 Minutes and we're told that he's a geneticist who works on marijuana but found DNA contamination in the transfection that we won't call transfection.

48:14.529 --> 48:17.750
We'll call it a life-saving coronavirus vaccine and he will too.

48:18.823 --> 48:19.943
Don't be surprised.

48:25.905 --> 48:32.267
In a manner where they are almost perfectly spaced into, they build a thing back together in six pieces.

48:32.347 --> 48:39.649
So the Humpty Dumpty comes back together in a sort of an engineering way through only in SARS-CoV-2.

48:39.749 --> 48:45.331
If you look at where those restriction sites exist in all the other coronaviruses we know about, they're kind of randomly scattered.

48:45.987 --> 48:47.608
They don't look like someone designed them in.

48:47.848 --> 48:54.313
When you look in SARS-CoV-2, they're very perfectly spaced such that an engineer put it together.

48:55.174 --> 49:04.361
And there's a particular set of them near the fear and cleavage site that looks like it's designed to take that fear and cleavage site in and out and mutate it and swap it around.

49:04.821 --> 49:08.863
so that you can optimize this to actually hit ACE2 receptors.

49:09.623 --> 49:16.426
And what's remarkable about the zoonosis thesis is that this thing came out pre-optimized.

49:16.866 --> 49:22.568
Like when we first found SARS coronavirus, the binding affinity to ACE2 was already optimized.

49:22.688 --> 49:23.889
That's not normal.

49:24.049 --> 49:31.032
Like if this were a zoonotic event, the leap would mean it was unoptimized and would take maybe five or 10 years to become more optimized in the population.

49:31.832 --> 49:51.151
That's another signature that someone had to have a piece inside the design of this virus that they could swap in and out to put a library in there, to combinatorially screen for fear and cleavage sites in receptor binding domains that would effectively allow them to reach for optimization out of the gate.

49:51.894 --> 50:02.425
And so Charles and Alex have a good story around this, but how they use serial passaging and the engineering design that they have in this implicate this as being, in fact, a weapon that was built.

50:02.845 --> 50:05.828
And it's not something that hopped over from pangolins and bats and all that stuff.

50:05.848 --> 50:06.629
Jesus Christ.

50:06.969 --> 50:07.129
Yeah.

50:07.269 --> 50:12.472
Harvey Reich, I think, has another interesting like window on this, like the it's worth of.

50:13.012 --> 50:25.920
That's also an admission because Harvey Reich was on stage with Stephen Hadfield and Robert Malone and and Brett Weinstein and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass in Romania in November of twenty twenty three.

50:26.880 --> 50:35.585
Right before many of those same people, minus Stephen Hadfield, were in front of the Senate with Senator Ron Johnson in January of twenty twenty four.

50:37.130 --> 50:43.933
It's all one malevolent show, and it's being orchestrated by this guy and Robert Malone, as best as I can tell.

50:45.094 --> 50:54.458
Their connections make sense, their affiliations make sense, their history makes sense, and more importantly, their five-year recent history makes complete sense.

50:55.745 --> 50:57.046
They are scripted actors.

50:57.106 --> 50:59.188
They are behind CHD and ICANN.

50:59.228 --> 51:01.070
They are behind RFK Jr.

51:01.110 --> 51:04.093
and the fake health freedom movement, the fake anti-vax movement.

51:04.573 --> 51:11.600
They're probably in cahoots with the same people that script, you know, Paul Offit.

51:12.220 --> 51:12.961
It's all the same.

51:13.001 --> 51:17.485
They probably have steak dinners together or at least did 10 years ago before this all started.

51:19.775 --> 51:22.899
view on the Ron Johnson thing that I was at.

51:23.880 --> 51:29.247
Harvey gave his pitch on like alright where the hell did this all come from and how do we avoid doing this again.

51:29.267 --> 51:35.435
And he had the most compelling synopsis I think because everyone's been like can they be this evil?

51:35.475 --> 51:36.236
What the hell happened?

51:38.199 --> 51:45.825
I think his story makes the most sense, which is that the biodefense industry, if you will, has always kind of justified itself on that.

51:45.905 --> 51:49.488
We need to be doing gain-of-function research to protect against a particular weapon.

51:49.688 --> 51:51.250
And so we're going to preemptively do all this.

51:52.671 --> 51:57.415
Fast forward to 2020, they've never come up with something they've saved us from.

51:57.795 --> 52:02.299
And then the first thing that leaks is potentially from their own making, right?

52:03.300 --> 52:10.863
So that puts the biodefense industry on their heels, in that we have to be in control of the solution to this, otherwise we're non-existent when this is done.

52:11.123 --> 52:14.585
So let's get Fauci involved, because they had him on payroll.

52:15.185 --> 52:23.809
And of course, Fauci, I think you've probably seen some of those emails and conversations that have come out where it's like, you'll have orders, you have things to do.

52:23.849 --> 52:27.791
He's so arrogantly talking about, you won't, you'll get a vaccine or you'll lose your job.

52:28.391 --> 52:30.332
The kids will get kicked out of school.

52:30.732 --> 52:46.694
his his emails internally that leaked out of the NIH were were like you'll have things to do tomorrow you must read this paper this is a paper about you know potential leak right early on this like February and the pandemic where it first hit on him

52:47.334 --> 52:52.799
that this could have come from money from his pocket, like it could have come from the WIF, Wuhan Institute of Virology.

52:52.819 --> 52:57.663
And so suddenly Tony's now implicated in maybe funding the virus that leaked.

52:58.283 --> 53:04.448
And suddenly he's in panic mode, sending emails to everyone that night like, read all this stuff, you'll have assignments tomorrow, like we gotta get on this.

53:04.788 --> 53:12.275
And Francis Collins is in there talking about how we have to have a swift takedown of all these conspiracy theories that say it could be engineered.

53:13.155 --> 53:15.877
And so they're in high gear right now trying to cover this up.

53:16.678 --> 53:25.266
But his take is that the biodefense program then went to high gear trying to get the vaccine as the only solution to fix this.

53:25.326 --> 53:28.630
That way, they would have a justification for, yes, something leaked.

53:28.710 --> 53:33.915
Sorry, we don't really know who made it, but we happened to save the day with a biodefense program having this vaccine ready.

53:34.015 --> 53:36.037
See, this scan and function stuff really needs to happen.

53:36.057 --> 53:39.180
Otherwise, we would have been millions of people would have died without this.

53:40.270 --> 53:42.933
which is a narrative you hear people try to propagate in the news, right?

53:43.514 --> 53:46.497
That without this vaccine, it saves 20 million people.

53:46.537 --> 53:53.665
They conjure up all of these weird epidemiological studies that try to make that case in their own modeling studies that are easily dismantled.

53:56.428 --> 54:03.615
I think that is a lesson for us going forward, that this gain-of-function work is more dangerous than it can ever help.

54:04.356 --> 54:06.377
It is something they need to put a real tight lid on.

54:06.397 --> 54:15.226
I'm involved on a separate side of this, which is, okay, you found a contaminant in these machines, that could implicate fraud.

54:15.406 --> 54:17.448
Fraud might unwind the PREP Act.

54:18.588 --> 54:41.133
That therefore lawyers can now go after the FDA and the first trial that tried to do that was with Brooke Jackson and Brooke Jackson had evidence of the trials being fabricated like she was in that she was at Ventavia being asked to like, you know shift around the PCR numbers or shift around the data on Unblind this site and then blind that site that way they could they could play games with the clinical trial data, right?

54:41.193 --> 54:45.034
And she blew the whistle on that they brought that to court the judge ruled that this was not

54:46.174 --> 54:49.958
Yes, Pfizer lied, but they were told to lie by the DoD.

54:50.178 --> 54:53.421
This is not a typical manufacturing arrangement.

54:53.481 --> 54:56.303
This is actually a biological countermeasure.

54:56.363 --> 54:57.324
The DoD is running this.

54:57.584 --> 54:58.946
You have the wrong defendants.

54:59.826 --> 55:02.269
So they have to, like, re-steer their case, maybe.

55:02.409 --> 55:04.270
And so now we have this.

55:04.911 --> 55:07.213
This is all the same interview in November of 2024.

55:07.713 --> 55:10.276
Now, remember, right now, currently,

55:10.876 --> 55:37.205
The former lawyer of Scott Shara, Grace's dad, that lawyer is now podcasting, and he's podcasting the same thing that Sasha Latupova and Catherine Watt have been saying for a long time, that this is a DOD operation, it's a kill box, it was a bioweapon, the whole thing is the DOD, so that's the reason why Pfizer's not guilty, even though no one ever says Biontech.

55:37.945 --> 55:40.006
Biontech is the company that made it.

55:40.871 --> 55:41.572
like it or not.

55:41.772 --> 55:45.095
Pfizer put its name on it, but Pfizer didn't manufacture it.

55:45.135 --> 55:46.577
Biontech manufactured it.

55:46.597 --> 55:50.561
It's Biontech, that German company's technology.

55:51.061 --> 55:53.264
And so all of this is very strange.

55:53.344 --> 55:58.128
Sasha Latupova being in this is very strange because her daughter was on

55:58.849 --> 56:06.598
was on social media before the pandemic and not in a good way, not in a responsible way, not in a, wow, you're a great mom sort of way.

56:07.058 --> 56:14.546
And so for her to be behind this and part of Team Robert Malone on stage with him in multiple countries, she

56:15.547 --> 56:19.071
being a part of the same show that Kevin McKernan is a part of.

56:19.411 --> 56:20.372
Realize this.

56:20.492 --> 56:24.497
It's all one malevolent show.

56:24.657 --> 56:30.343
And Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project means that it's not your family's fault.

56:31.809 --> 56:40.552
If your family fell for the voice and charm of Andrew Wakefield, I can be very disappointed.

56:40.612 --> 56:55.636
But if your family member fell for Kevin McKernan, you can't be disappointed or upset in them because Kevin McKernan is a master class in what a real national security state actor on a script can do.

56:57.403 --> 57:02.465
You need to watch every podcast this guy has ever done that you have time for.

57:02.925 --> 57:14.828
You have to make sure you watch the one where he came on my show, when I was still trying to catch up and figure out what was going on and still hadn't realized that RNA virology was one giant fraud.

57:15.989 --> 57:23.631
I still assumed that the vast majority of people were telling the truth, including him, including Charles Rixey.

57:24.741 --> 57:32.657
And this is going on five years ago that this guy started meddling with my family, meddling with my business and my ability to make a living.

57:32.717 --> 57:35.423
He is a criminal from my perspective.

57:37.517 --> 57:42.861
If I had a lawyer out there, somebody that understood what was going on, we'd be taking money from this guy.

57:42.981 --> 58:06.257
I would own his house by now because he is a fraud who has directly meddled with my reputation, my ability to make a living, and that up into and including going on Danny Jones's podcast and lying about the Health and Human Services Secretary's book and the consultation that led to its creation and completion.

58:07.048 --> 58:17.280
This is a malevolent national security actor and he's your best window into the fraud that is the fake health freedom movement and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:17.320 --> 58:22.106
and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense and Brian Hooker.

58:23.612 --> 58:24.353
Toward the DoD.

58:24.393 --> 58:24.974
I mean, they don't know.

58:25.034 --> 58:26.575
This is how do you sue the DoD?

58:27.616 --> 58:32.382
The judge said that they were told to lie about the SB40 because of... No, not SB40.

58:32.402 --> 58:35.645
This is just fraud, a different form of fraud.

58:36.166 --> 58:39.730
But we expect if we approach them with the SB40 thing, they'll probably use the same excuse.

58:39.790 --> 58:40.631
Like it's a precedent.

58:40.751 --> 58:43.674
I can't believe this SB40 story isn't everywhere.

58:43.934 --> 59:09.072
So the SV40 story, of course, is Kevin McKernan on this show as a former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, claiming that one of the things that's contaminated in the shot is an intact SV40 promoter, which is an incredibly common molecular sequence used in virtually every university in the Western world.

59:10.472 --> 59:21.339
because it's used in cell culture and in bacterial culture to drive the copying of DNA plasmids that you want to make lots of copies of.

59:23.920 --> 59:27.983
It's actually so ubiquitous, it's kind of absurd.

59:28.063 --> 59:36.548
Anybody that's been through a medical institute and walked through the walls or walked through the hallways has probably gotten it on their shoes.

59:37.289 --> 59:38.169
It's a sequence.

59:38.469 --> 59:39.250
It's everywhere.

59:40.222 --> 59:54.820
And so for him to claim that it's a sequence that was nowhere until it was in the transfections that were thrown out by Pfizer, that is a very, very bold claim.

59:56.328 --> 01:00:11.949
And because that very, very bold claim is compartmentalized and completely isolated on the internet, you can again see it as an incredible piece of evidence that the internet is being used against us or this guy with all of his credentials

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:15.873
would be able to call someone and say, hey, this is Kevin McKernan.

01:00:15.894 --> 01:00:16.675
You remember me?

01:00:17.055 --> 01:00:19.758
We got a big problem and we got to tell people about it.

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:21.120
And it's not happening.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:30.212
Instead, he's going on podcasts and telling people, you know, and then the rest of the time he's spending his life doing conferences about marijuana.

01:00:37.036 --> 01:00:42.640
They have a lot of fact-checkers talking about it, which is a sign that they're worried about it.

01:00:42.821 --> 01:00:54.290
All the fact-checkers you see, if you dig into them, there's some connection of money either back to the Gates Foundation or to a pharmaceutical company one way or another.

01:00:55.411 --> 01:01:04.719
Even the government came out saying they had a billion dollars to spend on reducing vaccine hesitancy for basically marketing their narrative, if you will.

01:01:05.759 --> 01:01:16.049
When you can tell which topics worry them by how many fact-checkers are sick on it And we're probably right up there at the top if you look up the sv40 stuff They have gotten every one of the fact-checkers to write something

01:01:20.532 --> 01:01:48.949
And so again, I will stress that it is very important to see that all of the actors that have been put in front of us, including Mary Talley Bowden and Ryan Cole, soon to be candidate for the governor of Idaho, have exclusively agreed to participate in this spectacular commitment to lies, which at the heart of it is a consensus that PCR can be used as a diagnostic.

01:01:50.285 --> 01:02:05.775
Because even though there was this pretend resistance to PCR as a diagnostic during the first couple of years of COVID, we came out of COVID with PCR as an accepted diagnostic that the FDA is no longer concerned in regulating.

01:02:06.195 --> 01:02:19.344
And we have diagnostics that are being used all around the United States and all around the world that are supposedly capable of diagnosing up to 20 different viral pathogens using PCR alone.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.624
And this is not real.

01:02:23.904 --> 01:02:26.525
This is a spectacular commitment to lies.

01:02:26.745 --> 01:02:30.767
And they are regularly made to confirm their commitment to that lie.

01:02:31.188 --> 01:02:40.792
Here is Ryan Cole testifying under oath in the United States government in the Senate or somewhere about who he is.

01:02:41.252 --> 01:02:47.095
And he states very specifically that he's done hundreds of thousands of COVID tests.

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:56.962
We have been manipulated by these actors on social media, and many of them were recruited in 2020 by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:57.922
I'm certain of it.

01:02:57.962 --> 01:03:00.583
That's what Robert Malone meant when he spun his team up.

01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:04.364
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:05.045
I'm an MD.

01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:05.805
I'm a physician.

01:03:06.605 --> 01:03:11.227
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology, subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.427
I do molecular biology.

01:03:12.447 --> 01:03:15.108
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.929
That's an admission.

01:03:20.393 --> 01:03:24.357
It's an admission that all of these people are part of the same show.

01:03:26.339 --> 01:03:34.386
It's one malevolent technocracy show that is trying to take permanent control of the evolution of the species.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:43.295
And they've known since Joshua Lederberg, the only way to do that would be to put you guys

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:46.147
aside and take control.

01:03:46.888 --> 01:03:50.148
Not everybody is smart enough to be a part of this ruling elite.

01:03:51.989 --> 01:03:59.771
And so they've been having auditions for the last few months and these auditions have led to this group of people being behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:59.811 --> 01:04:04.992
They're all on a script, they all trust it, but they are all vulnerable because they're not all supposed to still be there.

01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:08.586
This was supposed to be a couple years, and then that was it.

01:04:09.126 --> 01:04:12.190
But we're still here, and that's really bad for them.

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.535
I really believe wholeheartedly that that's bad for them.

01:04:20.225 --> 01:04:22.347
I think this time it could be different.

01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:22.827
I do.

01:04:22.927 --> 01:04:24.768
I think this time it could be different.

01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:26.730
We can take the power back from these people.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.691
Let me make myself a little smaller there.

01:04:29.692 --> 01:04:31.854
That's my message of hope.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:36.037
It's not a message for everyone, but it is a message for anyone.

01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:37.718
We are right here, right now.

01:04:37.798 --> 01:04:39.299
We choose where we go forward.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:45.424
We choose if we're ever on social media again, if we ever listen to any of these people or engage in their theater.

01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:48.646
And I would suggest to you that the way out is biology.

01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:51.568
We can change this.

01:04:52.128 --> 01:04:53.948
All we got to do is stop participating.

01:04:53.968 --> 01:05:00.690
We got to get off of social media because the illusion requires your participation to sustain.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.331
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.192
Transfection in healthy people is nuts.

01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:09.773
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:15.394
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, biological men can only ever be trans men.

01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:18.155
Once you see the truth that the U.S.

01:05:18.195 --> 01:05:26.279
vaccine schedule is just plain ridiculous when compared to any other vaccine schedule on Earth, you can see it as a criminal enterprise.

01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:27.960
It's just a question of why.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.463
The real question is why, and none of these people really have a succinct answer for it.

01:05:34.483 --> 01:05:36.565
That's the way you can see they're full of baloney.

01:05:37.385 --> 01:05:41.288
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief.

01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:42.889
It's the 21st of October, 2025.

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:48.732
It is a message of hope that is for anyone, but not for everyone.

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:51.834
Because this is for all the marbles.

01:05:51.854 --> 01:05:54.716
It's for the children, the grandchildren of Earth.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.963
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder and lies hiding behind this is pure oxygen causes ARDS.

01:06:02.603 --> 01:06:05.304
PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool.

01:06:05.765 --> 01:06:08.866
And not using antibiotics for pneumonia is a crime.

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:10.327
You could explain that to your kids.

01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:13.929
And then you can also explain why in the world would they do this?

01:06:15.543 --> 01:06:22.645
They understand that there's only one chance in history to collect this diversity of genetic and medical data available on Earth.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:27.967
There will never be more experimental animals again, and so you've got to collect the data now.

01:06:28.647 --> 01:06:35.989
Even if the AI isn't ready, even if the machine learning algorithms are still in their baby stages, we've got to collect the data now.

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:38.830
because the data is only available now.

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:45.954
There's only a couple generations before 10 billion becomes half a billion and all that data is lost.

01:06:45.994 --> 01:06:47.915
The opportunity is lost.

01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:56.439
And so these actors were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure any damage from transfection could be blamed effectively on the novel virus.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.780
And that was all part of the Human Genome Project.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.221
That's really how to explain this.

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:02.022
They need all the data.

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:03.183
They need to store it.

01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:03.483
They're not

01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:08.205
They're not building all this data infrastructure to store videos for Netflix.

01:07:08.265 --> 01:07:13.309
They're doing it to store the medical data, store the data.

01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:18.614
It's all building an infrastructure that will eventually be turned on your children.

01:07:19.715 --> 01:07:22.498
And it needs to be accessible to the machine learning algorithm.

01:07:22.518 --> 01:07:24.860
They need to validate this over several times.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.764
And so the Human Genome Project is actually where we are.

01:07:28.804 --> 01:07:29.905
That's at the center of this.

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:33.740
That's what the murder and lies for what are all about.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.461
That's the question that everybody doesn't seem to have an answer for.

01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:42.262
It's Israel and the Jews are doing it or something like that, the bankers.

01:07:42.822 --> 01:07:45.843
No, it's gotta have a bigger ideal than that.

01:07:45.883 --> 01:07:47.203
It's gotta have a bigger idea.

01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:48.043
It ain't Satan.

01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:50.824
It ain't because Satan told people to do it.

01:07:51.184 --> 01:07:51.824
It's not.

01:07:53.244 --> 01:07:58.686
There is a very specific reason why we are being governed in this way and it's for the data.

01:07:58.766 --> 01:08:00.346
Moment to defeat cancer.

01:08:01.457 --> 01:08:13.726
So today is about you, the fighters and the survivors, the caretakers and the researchers, the philanthropists and the patient advocates.

01:08:14.607 --> 01:08:19.070
It's about the millions of Americans, their loved ones and all those.

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:23.113
So now remember this is again, this is when he's a vice president, this is 2016.

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:29.506
This is right at the end of the presidency, right?

01:08:29.546 --> 01:08:30.886
Because guess, you know, right?

01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:32.167
What's, what's going on here.

01:08:32.187 --> 01:08:36.989
This might be January or something like that.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:44.892
But the point is to see that this is one continuous narrative, Obama to Trump, to Biden, to Trump.

01:08:44.972 --> 01:08:47.753
It's one continuous national security thing.

01:08:47.793 --> 01:08:52.715
Maybe even Obama was just a puppet, a dude they put there.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:58.249
Everybody cheered because finally we have a black president and they all laughed.

01:09:00.014 --> 01:09:12.985
I mean, at this stage, we need to wake up and apologize to our children for having been asleep at the wheel for so long, believing that Pelosi and all of these other people had our best interests in mind and so we could just go on with our daily lives.

01:09:14.386 --> 01:09:18.409
Completely wrong, completely, completely wrong.

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:25.175
Let's listen to Jill and listen to, I guess that's Joe Biden, but I don't know, you know, there could be several, whatever.

01:09:25.616 --> 01:09:28.358
Around the world who are confronting cancer.

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:34.253
It's about hope, but ultimately it's about action.

01:09:35.775 --> 01:09:43.641
Because of all of you and many others watching at home, we've made incredible progress this year.

01:09:44.922 --> 01:09:47.504
Progress that Joe will talk about in detail.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:05.804
So now it's my pleasure to introduce a man of action, the man President Obama put in control, at mission control, of this moonshot, my husband, our Vice President, Joe Biden.

01:10:19.295 --> 01:10:31.231
Gina McCarthy, EPA, Dr. Francis Collins, NIH director and the guy who is most responsible for the Human Genome Project, an incredible achievement all by itself.

01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:35.716
The National Cancer Institute director, Doug Lowery, who has

01:10:36.587 --> 01:10:39.508
has been a great, great ally and educator of mine.

01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:51.074
FDA Administrator, Robert Califf, and Acting Administrator for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Andy Slavitt.

01:10:52.274 --> 01:10:59.718
We have a former colonel in the Turkish Army at the head of CMS right now, but he mentions Andy Slavitt.

01:10:59.818 --> 01:11:01.479
Andy Slavitt's got a great book.

01:11:02.316 --> 01:11:05.057
from 2021 called Preventable.

01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:10.958
If you want a good laugh at the fireplace, easy read, because it's like at the sixth grade level.

01:11:12.039 --> 01:11:14.299
This book is phenomenally shitty.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:27.103
Anyway, Andy Slavitt, great nod to one of these people who, you know, pretends to have expertise in public health and stuff like that, but they're really just scripted actors of the worst kind.

01:11:27.915 --> 01:11:29.116
the national security kind.

01:11:29.736 --> 01:11:34.600
Tyler Jacks, Elizabeth Jaffe, the co-chairs of the Blue Ribbon Commission.

01:11:35.361 --> 01:11:41.185
I wish I could, and the public deserves to know every one of you in this room.

01:11:42.185 --> 01:11:55.176
And I mean every one of you, because you're the ones that have done such remarkable work to date, and you're the ones that are going to be responsible for what I believe will be an enormous amount of progress we'll make soon.

01:11:56.116 --> 01:12:05.944
First of all, when Barack Obama asked me to head up this moonshot, there were some skeptics out there that said, well, here we go again.

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:08.727
Nixon declared a war on cancer in 1971.

01:12:08.767 --> 01:12:09.527
There's a big difference.

01:12:12.236 --> 01:12:20.360
In 1971, President Nixon's interest and concern was real and genuine, but he had no army.

01:12:21.221 --> 01:12:22.361
He had no resources.

01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:24.963
No clear strategy existed to win.

01:12:25.803 --> 01:12:39.090
But 45 years later, after decades and decades of funding, new research, training scientists and physicians, treating millions of patients because of so many of you,

01:12:39.895 --> 01:12:43.399
We now have a powerful new technologies and tools.

01:12:43.879 --> 01:12:44.500
We have an army.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.864
And with this moonshot, a clear strategy and road ahead.

01:12:49.985 --> 01:12:51.347
The moonshot does two things.

01:12:52.388 --> 01:12:59.014
One, first, it injects, and because of all of you, an incredible sense of urgency back into this fight.

01:12:59.966 --> 01:13:08.073
Part of it is that what I said to the President when I walked out in the Rose Garden that day and said, I regret — it was spontaneous.

01:13:08.153 --> 01:13:16.039
I said, I — the only thing I regret in not announcing I'm not running for President, I'd like to preside over the end of cancer as we know it.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:18.841
Not we'd solve it all, but the end of cancer as we know it.

01:13:19.842 --> 01:13:25.507
And some WAGs, particularly in some of your professions, said, you know, like, here we go again.

01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:26.848
Here we go again.

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:28.403
But you know what?

01:13:30.284 --> 01:13:37.850
What happened is that because of you, there is a fundamental new sense of urgency.

01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:40.092
I think you all can feel it.

01:13:40.132 --> 01:13:40.972
You've generated it.

01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:43.334
It's not only here, but it's around the world.

01:13:44.135 --> 01:13:52.521
And the second thing is, back in 1971, when there was no Army, there was not all this stuff.

01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:54.603
We didn't even know then there were 200 different cancers.

01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:56.525
What's happened?

01:13:57.418 --> 01:14:07.244
is that we had a set of rules, a culture that was established for research and cooperation that is not applicable to 2016.

01:14:08.305 --> 01:14:13.688
The change in the cultural system that's needed to win this fight is kind of what we're all about.

01:14:14.775 --> 01:14:17.157
Jill and I, as Jill mentioned.

01:14:17.897 --> 01:14:20.579
A cultural change is needed to win the battle.

01:14:20.619 --> 01:14:22.561
I wonder what cultural change is needed.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:29.466
Every family is facing, everybody knows someone, if not their own family, facing cancer.

01:14:30.126 --> 01:14:31.908
And we know what it does to a family.

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:40.474
Our family learned as much as we could, which all of you do, and some of you who are in the profession are survivors and or you've lost someone.

01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:44.931
And what do you do even if you have no background in cancer?

01:14:45.871 --> 01:14:47.833
It's your child, your husband, your wife.

01:14:48.814 --> 01:14:51.716
You try to learn everything you can.

01:14:52.076 --> 01:14:55.839
Trying to learn everything you can sounds like doing your own research.

01:14:55.919 --> 01:14:57.400
Be careful, Joe.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:08.189
Everything you can about the disease, both for purposes of hope and deciding on what you can do.

01:15:08.849 --> 01:15:09.830
What is it you can do?

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.011
Is there anything you can do?

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:20.592
It speeds the progress because the one thing that every single cancer patient needs is a little bit of hope.

01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:21.992
Hope.

01:15:23.213 --> 01:15:25.493
My mother used to say, where there's life, there's hope.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:41.657
What we learn from the world's best nurses, physicians, and researchers is that even if we couldn't save our son, the science, the medicine, the technology are progressing faster than ever.

01:15:43.362 --> 01:15:46.185
so he'd be able to save countless sons and daughters.

01:15:47.566 --> 01:15:54.874
As I've been saying repeatedly, I didn't realize this until Beau was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma.

01:15:55.595 --> 01:15:56.856
We knew it was the death sentence.

01:15:57.156 --> 01:15:57.977
We're not slow.

01:15:58.678 --> 01:15:59.098
He knew.

01:15:59.118 --> 01:16:00.800
We all knew.

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:03.202
But there was hope.

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:06.506
We just thought there was hope because

01:16:07.762 --> 01:16:14.267
Cancer in the last six years reached an inflection point that didn't exist seven, eight, 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.

01:16:15.408 --> 01:16:24.834
By inflection point, we found there's a recognition that the cancer system established five decades ago needs to be re-imaged for the 21st century.

01:16:25.775 --> 01:16:31.319
That too often our cancer culture and system still plays by the rules of 71, not 2016.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.161
But so much has changed.

01:16:34.842 --> 01:16:35.382
Let me explain.

01:16:35.462 --> 01:16:36.203
Five years ago,

01:16:37.105 --> 01:16:40.447
Oncologists weren't routinely working with immunologists.

01:16:40.587 --> 01:16:44.109
Immunology was sort of a voodoo science 10, 15 years ago.

01:16:44.749 --> 01:16:46.410
No, I'm not joking.

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:59.056
I'm a bit pejorative, but truly, truly, engaging the immune system to kill cancers, there were three things that were done routinely.

01:16:59.596 --> 01:17:00.937
Find the tumor, excise it.

01:17:01.657 --> 01:17:04.859
What you couldn't get out, make sure you radiate the margins.

01:17:05.868 --> 01:17:27.821
And number three, which kills a lot of healthy parts of your brain or your body, and then engage in significant doses, depending on the seriousness of the cancer, of chemotherapy, which kills an awful lot of those cells that we need to engage those T-cells to kill the cancer.

01:17:29.242 --> 01:17:33.585
So with immunologists and virologists, geneticists, chemical engineers, and others,

01:17:35.145 --> 01:17:38.927
They're now all working together and beginning to work even more closely together.

01:17:39.387 --> 01:17:42.569
It's becoming more routine than the exception now.

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:56.777
Today, there's a recognition that by aggregating and sharing data from millions of patients, genomics, family histories, lifestyles, treatment outcomes, we have now what we didn't have before.

01:17:56.837 --> 01:17:59.078
We have a supercomputing capacity.

01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:03.321
We can actually do a million billion

01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:19.752
a million — you all know it, but the press — a million billion calculations per second, enabling us, at least theoretically, if we aggregate enough data, to be able to find new patterns and causes in successful treatments of cancer.

01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:23.395
Why does one treatment work on you and not on me?

01:18:23.435 --> 01:18:24.356
We have the same cancer.

01:18:25.422 --> 01:18:28.743
Why does the same vaccine hurt you and not me?

01:18:28.823 --> 01:18:32.145
Why did your kid get autism?

01:18:32.605 --> 01:18:35.846
Why did Peter Hotez's kid get autism and not mine?

01:18:36.666 --> 01:18:38.287
He says it's a genetic thing.

01:18:40.748 --> 01:18:41.608
Can you see it yet?

01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:50.492
This is 2016, you know, three years after Joe Rogan did his deadly viruses program on sci-fi.

01:18:52.628 --> 01:19:04.312
That would be also 2013, the year that Brian Hooker went on a radio program and said he doesn't use the word autism, he doesn't like the word autism, his son was vaccine damaged.

01:19:04.332 --> 01:19:19.857
2016 in April was the year that ICANN was founded and the movie Vaxxed was released in America and the year that Robert De Niro went on Good Morning America twice in a week in order to say something about the movie Vaxxed.

01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:34.300
In the same year that Donald Trump was elected president, despite their best efforts, despite Hillary Clinton's best effort in the debate, Donald Trump won.

01:19:35.281 --> 01:19:36.803
That's what we're supposed to believe.

01:19:40.202 --> 01:19:44.364
Because of technological advances and analyzing cancer genes and other genes in the body.

01:19:44.584 --> 01:19:47.026
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Human Genome Project.

01:19:47.046 --> 01:19:52.949
They want you to think it's pharmaceutical companies or the DOD told the pharmaceutical companies to lie about it.

01:19:53.169 --> 01:19:56.851
No, no, no, no.

01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.573
It's the Human Genome Project.

01:19:59.593 --> 01:20:07.937
They want you to believe it's social media censoring people and it's not fair because the government asked them to censor people and that's all they did.

01:20:07.957 --> 01:20:07.997
No.

01:20:09.264 --> 01:20:10.925
They amplified actors.

01:20:13.606 --> 01:20:17.668
And they de-amplify real patriots and put other people in their place.

01:20:18.128 --> 01:20:30.593
And so like they did with the anti-vax movement before the pandemic, they have created a fake conservative movement in America that they can manipulate, fragment, and destroy.

01:20:31.812 --> 01:20:38.414
in exactly the same way that they have basically done with any meaningful anti-vax movement.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:50.437
They kill a few people, and then they fragment it and destroy it with bullshit narratives that never progress, and actors that agree to stay on that non-progressing script.

01:20:52.307 --> 01:20:57.370
It's very malevolent because the social media landscape is not free.

01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:04.613
It is a military landscape with military actors that are distributed with military precision.

01:21:06.814 --> 01:21:13.998
And the fake conservative movement in America is now in full swing and it was first in a microcosm

01:21:15.612 --> 01:21:19.678
visible in the anti-vax movement before the pandemic.

01:21:19.759 --> 01:21:24.827
And that's why I think all of these organizations are just a natural expansion of that.

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:26.790
Herding cats.

01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:30.516
It's not very easy, so you need lots of shepherds.

01:21:34.696 --> 01:21:47.423
Ladies and gentlemen, it's really ugly, but that's the reason why that genomics expert, Claire Craig, is at the head of Heart in the UK, and that's why she's promoted by all the people in Panda from South Africa.

01:21:47.463 --> 01:21:59.530
That's the reason why this guy says that he spun a team up and used AI and X-ray crystallography computer models of all the pharmaceuticals on the FDA register to scan for ivermectin and

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:17.526
and remdesivir that's why this lady was on a call with him in 2011 about the anthrax vaccine that's why that person there claims to have five post-secondary degrees which isn't even really a thing that's why that fake belgian guy over there who worked with this guy at solvay is now talking about the

01:22:18.206 --> 01:22:25.012
ever evolution of the virus and how eventually the vaccine people are really going to get sick because SARS-CoV-2 is going to come back and get them.

01:22:25.452 --> 01:22:33.559
And that's the reason why the glyphosate expert from MIT has been involved with trying to say that autism is caused by glyphosate since 2017.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:40.345
Yes, that person, Stephanie Seneff down there, it's all one show.

01:22:43.575 --> 01:22:45.878
It's crazy, but it's all one show.

01:22:45.938 --> 01:22:56.851
That's why in January of 2020, it is Lee Min Yan and Steven Hatfill on Steve Bannon's broadcast.

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:59.334
Steve Bannon calls Tony Lyons a genius.

01:22:59.394 --> 01:23:03.398
Tony Lyons is the guy behind Sky Horse Publishing that wrote the book.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:14.770
with Jesse Ventura, where the epilogue told the story about a Republican candidate taking an independent candidate named Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:17.633
as their vice president and then getting shot after the election.

01:23:17.673 --> 01:23:19.174
In 2008, that book is from this book.

01:23:25.379 --> 01:23:36.769
It's all one malevolent show and social media makes it really hard to see that these people have been at it since like really since the early 2000s, if not long before.

01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:45.737
That's the only way to explain the odd professional connection between Les Weinstein and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:23:45.717 --> 01:23:47.138
's dad, Robert F. Kennedy.

01:23:48.188 --> 01:23:53.172
It's the only way to explain the odd connection between Les Weinstein and Estes Kefauver.

01:23:53.192 --> 01:23:56.994
The only way to explain the odd connection between Les Weinstein and Thalidomide.

01:23:57.395 --> 01:24:01.258
The only way to explain the odd connection between Eric Weinstein and Peter Thiel.

01:24:01.618 --> 01:24:09.684
The only way to explain the odd connection between Danny Jones and Peter Thiel and Kevin McKernan and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:12.546
and Meryl Ness and Robert Malone and all of them.

01:24:12.566 --> 01:24:16.449
It can't be any other way.

01:24:18.021 --> 01:24:39.648
While Bobby is focused on ending the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies, I am going to assemble the best technologists and scientists in the world, and we will use the latest in AI and computation to examine the health records databases of our nation and those other nations who are also on a quest to solve chronic disease.

01:24:41.761 --> 01:24:43.562
It can't be by accident, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:43.602 --> 01:24:45.723
It simply cannot be by accident.

01:24:46.443 --> 01:24:49.224
Nobody and nothing is in this narrative by chance.

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:53.546
And once you understand that, then you understand that everybody has a timeline.

01:24:55.387 --> 01:25:04.951
My timeline is just an unblemished record of integrity where groups of people have meddled with my ability to make a living and care for my family for almost six years straight.

01:25:07.252 --> 01:25:10.454
And those people include the highest level of all this cast.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:22.584
this international traveling group of performers that includes all the way up to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Robert Malone, and Meryl Ness, and Jay Bhattacharya, Steve Kirsch, all of them.

01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:26.286
It's simply unexplainable.

01:25:26.326 --> 01:25:29.487
There's where that thing that she was talking about in the beginning.

01:25:29.607 --> 01:25:34.388
Go back to 2013 and see, this is him right here on my website.

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:38.030
This is, thank you, this is Brian Hooker.

01:25:39.284 --> 01:25:50.289
talking on a radio network thing, saying that he doesn't think that his son was, it's not, it's not, it's not right, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:50.969 --> 01:25:52.490
He doesn't say the word autism.

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:53.650
He says vaccine injury.

01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:56.171
He questions the entire idea of vaccination.

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:59.633
And that can't be, that can't be by accident.

01:26:01.353 --> 01:26:03.334
Just in the same way, it can't be by accident.

01:26:03.394 --> 01:26:05.035
Nobody knows who Brandy Vaughn is.

01:26:06.752 --> 01:26:18.076
that all these people stood in front of Brandy Vaughn, that Brandy Vaughn thought all these people were fake, that Brandy Vaughn didn't like any of these people, and then she got dead in 2020 and everybody forgot about her.

01:26:18.476 --> 01:26:23.958
But she was putting up, she was putting up billboards across from Paul Offit's hospital.

01:26:26.647 --> 01:26:28.768
That's a lot more than CHD has ever done.

01:26:29.269 --> 01:26:31.690
But then again, nobody's in this narrative by chance.

01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:39.795
Of course, don't forget, April 2016, we have, of course, the Vaxxed, and these people are all together.

01:26:39.835 --> 01:26:48.941
There's James Lyons Weiler, there's Judy Mikovits of CFS and AIDS fame, there's Del Bigtree, and there's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:53.564
These people are all scripted frauds, and some are unwitting participants, but in the end,

01:26:54.484 --> 01:26:56.426
Brandy Vaughn was dead in 2020.

01:26:56.546 --> 01:26:58.047
Tony Bark was dead in 2020.

01:26:58.388 --> 01:27:00.349
And these people are still in front of us now.

01:27:00.369 --> 01:27:02.691
Oh my gosh, it was so great.

01:27:02.991 --> 01:27:03.572
So great.

01:27:06.266 --> 01:27:24.898
And so if we listen to Brian Hooker in December of 2020, we're going to hear Brian Hooker talk about the safety studies being too short, vaccines causing sickness, 5G warfare, neutralizing antibodies and what they do.

01:27:24.938 --> 01:27:27.059
We're going to talk about asymptomatic carriers.

01:27:27.499 --> 01:27:31.202
We're going to talk about vaccines that target T cells don't exist right now.

01:27:31.582 --> 01:27:52.776
And we're not going to question PCR at all in December of 2020, you know, just a month or two, or maybe a week or two after Brandy Vaughn, somebody that he considered a hero was died or killed or dead just before the largest wave of murder that would occur in America in the, the, the winter of 2020 into the, the, into 2021.

01:27:56.297 --> 01:28:01.264
Brian Hooker is a scripted fraud because remember in 2013 he didn't use the word autism.

01:28:02.245 --> 01:28:03.506
He didn't like the word autism.

01:28:03.847 --> 01:28:05.249
His son was vaccine damaged.

01:28:07.351 --> 01:28:11.977
And now in 2020 he's part of an organization that says vaccines cause autism.

01:28:12.898 --> 01:28:20.942
His personal story is, is that his son had an ear infection and that's why five vaccines in one day caused autism in his son.

01:28:21.182 --> 01:28:22.843
But it doesn't have to be in everybody's son.

01:28:23.263 --> 01:28:25.984
And I don't know if he remembers whether he gave him Tylenol or not.

01:28:26.444 --> 01:28:29.726
Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrible where we are.

01:28:30.984 --> 01:28:33.305
Because I used to think Brian Hooker was a good guy too.

01:28:33.325 --> 01:28:38.527
But there's no way to explain his oration in that thing as a happy little accident.

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:43.248
There's no way to explain the track record of Jessica Rose as a happy little accident.

01:28:43.309 --> 01:28:48.670
Nor is there any way to explain any of these other people's track record as a happy little accident.

01:28:48.751 --> 01:28:49.571
It's all scripted.

01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:57.556
Electronic health records are now being regularly mined, they just need to be de-identified first, and this is already ongoing.

01:28:57.617 --> 01:29:01.860
Just like they did with Chess and Go, the real thing for the slavers was this.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.042
That's why they needed a worst-case scenario.

01:29:05.223 --> 01:29:13.391
And the worst-case scenario accomplished something that most people aren't even aware of, that PCR is used as a diagnostic in all places on Earth now.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.566
And that creates a remnant stream of sequencing data, sequencing data, sequencing data.

01:29:19.606 --> 01:29:28.936
Every time they swab your kid, every time they swab you, every time they take a swab to see what somebody has when they come into the ER, they are

01:29:29.617 --> 01:29:34.220
inevitably addressing, sorry, generating a medical remnant.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:43.886
Just the same way that circumcising a newborn baby, male baby in an American hospital generates a medical remnant that people will pay a lot of money for.

01:29:43.966 --> 01:29:48.309
Just like abortions generate a medical remnant that a lot of people will pay money for.

01:29:48.389 --> 01:29:53.672
Just like a C-section generates a medical remnant that a lot of people will pay a lot of money for.

01:29:53.732 --> 01:29:55.894
Do you understand the worst case scenario?

01:29:56.554 --> 01:30:02.939
Is that the United States population is already effectively nothing more than experimental animals?

01:30:09.984 --> 01:30:16.469
The vaccine schedule in the USA has been successfully insulated from any public scrutiny because they put clowns in front of us.

01:30:18.188 --> 01:30:19.909
They made us follow clowns.

01:30:19.969 --> 01:30:29.773
They made us ignore some of the clowns, but follow other of the clowns and fragmented us into a useless resistance by military precision.

01:30:33.415 --> 01:30:35.316
Please see it for what it is.

01:30:36.477 --> 01:30:44.100
The vaccine schedule will continue to expand younger and older, eventually to be replaced with transfection.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.821
That's genetic material.

01:30:47.381 --> 01:30:48.982
Because that's the gold standard, right?

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:51.485
And it's a personalized thing, potentially.

01:30:51.525 --> 01:30:57.711
Whereas, you know, the genetic vulnerabilities that everybody agrees underlie at least some of autism.

01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:05.778
Ladies and gentlemen, it's all accomplished for the slavers by the same group of people because they're all on the same script.

01:31:05.798 --> 01:31:08.220
There's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.902
There is a lot of evidence of murder.

01:31:11.437 --> 01:31:19.322
and there is an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that all these life insurance companies, actuaries knew about, all these people knew about.

01:31:19.362 --> 01:31:26.327
That's why they scripted the national security exercise to occur when the peak was expected.

01:31:27.028 --> 01:31:29.269
That's why they knew when to put people on the internet.

01:31:29.309 --> 01:31:31.391
That's why they knew when to put people in place.

01:31:31.451 --> 01:31:37.755
That's how they knew when this would happen because they've known it was coming since I was a senior in high school.

01:31:48.806 --> 01:31:53.490
And so, try to find another one of these clowns that has put together a succinct list.

01:31:53.970 --> 01:32:04.518
You know, a succinct list that the Health and Human Services Secretary could have had on a chart, had any one of the hearings that he's been involved in were hours and hours of questioning, he could have just started with this.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:10.961
that first we need to take into account the million Americans that were killed by opioids.

01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:34.369
First, we need to take into account the fact that critical care medicine teaches that supplementary oxygen can be dangerous and leads directly to ARDS, you know, that condition that's also tied to a coronavirus infection and a coronavirus name, but actually originates from ICU treatment using pure oxygen.

01:32:37.816 --> 01:32:38.656
Yes, that's right.

01:32:38.736 --> 01:32:49.578
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS, the original virus, cause ARDS is actually a national security narrative because ARDS is a condition that's caused by pure oxygen.

01:32:52.119 --> 01:32:54.739
Overventilation, you know, to stop spread.

01:32:54.799 --> 01:33:02.841
Lack of antibiotic use because as, you know, Griffin and all these other people like Red and Yellow say, there's a viral pneumonia.

01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:04.921
Stop lying!

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:25.000
Of course there's death certificate fraud and financial incentives and all this other stuff but a focus on that stuff when the totality of the numbers can be explained by the population pyramid plus opioids plus lack of antibiotic use plus supplementary oxygen and none of those three are ever said

01:33:28.632 --> 01:33:30.193
You can see how easy it is.

01:33:30.253 --> 01:33:32.053
You can see how easy it is.

01:33:32.213 --> 01:33:39.416
They have just put people in front of us who just happen to not be able to get the, you know, the bulk of the equation right.

01:33:39.836 --> 01:33:42.297
But all the other details they're really focused on.

01:33:42.997 --> 01:33:48.099
But Jessica Rose is sure that opioids haven't done anything to decrease life expectancy in America.

01:33:49.974 --> 01:33:54.936
This team of performers with elaborate costumes and effects all on the same script.

01:33:54.976 --> 01:34:04.660
Here's a video coming up that gets my channel roughly, gets me blocked right away because apparently this little video here is somehow copyrighted.

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.101
Anyway, this is what it looks like.

01:34:07.122 --> 01:34:12.584
This is a guy pretending to stop and start a train and I just want you to imagine if there were hundreds of that guy

01:34:13.164 --> 01:34:42.408
with fancy costumes on and a bunch of sound effects and maybe some fireworks it would be hard for you to dismiss that these people were actually involved in stopping and starting the train especially if they grunted and screamed and yelled and maybe even somebody got hurt while they were doing it and they needed you to replace them it would almost be impossible to resist that level of an illusion of consensus and that's what they can do on social media and that's why they did it and they do it with Israel and Gaza and Libya and the EU and

01:34:42.928 --> 01:34:45.229
and Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump.

01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:55.593
And they do it by putting these people on podcasts, putting these people on social media, putting these people on stage, and making it pretend like something real is happening.

01:34:57.294 --> 01:34:59.255
And it's not real things happening.

01:34:59.295 --> 01:35:01.316
These are real actors acting.

01:35:05.236 --> 01:35:12.190
That's why these three people were in Sweden and on stage with Robert Malone and Meryl Ness and Jessica Rose.

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:14.454
That's why the mother of Soph.

01:35:16.118 --> 01:35:17.960
is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.563
That's why this fraud is behind Maha.

01:35:21.623 --> 01:35:35.395
That's why that Canadian up there, Michael Palmer, lost my presentation to Doctors for COVID Ethics and didn't put it on their website, just the same way as Nick Hudson did with my three presentations to Panda in 2022.

01:35:37.711 --> 01:35:52.781
because they are all part of the same orchestrated theater around the world, loosely organized around, I don't know, NATO countries or UK countries, you know, countries that are still loyal to the crown.

01:35:54.822 --> 01:35:56.063
It's really interesting.

01:35:56.567 --> 01:36:08.352
It's really, really interesting to me to try and ponder how it is that they assembled these scripted frauds, but there is no question that these people are especially scripted frauds.

01:36:08.812 --> 01:36:11.333
Michael Palmer has a book with CHD.

01:36:12.609 --> 01:36:19.173
Asim Haltra is like a rock star in his little world of touring stages.

01:36:19.594 --> 01:36:32.102
And Sasha Latupova has a daughter that threatened to kill the YouTube CEO, had a million subscribers on YouTube before the pandemic, and got on Alex Jones three times in 2019.

01:36:32.542 --> 01:36:42.109
And now she's supposed to be some kind of whistleblower on the DoD retired pharma executive who sold her company to Pfizer, a Ukrainian

01:36:43.429 --> 01:36:45.110
behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:45.150 --> 01:36:45.950
and CHD.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:51.392
I mean, imagine how ridiculous it is to believe that any of these people are real.

01:36:52.892 --> 01:36:56.433
Imagine that Sasha Latupova is not in jail.

01:36:57.614 --> 01:37:02.755
Imagine that Asim Malhotra is respected in any forum that he shows up at.

01:37:03.416 --> 01:37:08.257
Imagine that Michael Palmer can even walk the street without getting hit by rotten vegetables.

01:37:10.138 --> 01:37:10.698
But it's true.

01:37:11.567 --> 01:37:23.132
We live in a world right now where the vast majority of people that engage in social media think those people are some kind of whistleblowers on their own money, on their own time traveling the world trying to save people.

01:37:26.153 --> 01:37:29.575
There are a team of performers in elaborate costumes and effects.

01:37:31.016 --> 01:37:31.936
It's easy to see.

01:37:32.896 --> 01:37:38.519
Remember Paul Offit was first presented to us on Democracy Now opposite Mary Holland

01:37:39.662 --> 01:37:54.192
In April of 2015, actually before the vaccine movie came out, by a whole year, these people were already put in place with an argument about MMR and MMR causing her autism and him saying that that's impossible.

01:37:54.232 --> 01:38:04.339
When MMR is one of the only subcutaneous vaccines and one of the more likely not to be responsible for the total toxicity that is the U.S.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:09.322
vaccine schedule because of its subcutaneous administration, if it's administered correctly.

01:38:09.762 --> 01:38:25.814
And so that's all part of the narrative that, of course, the absolute fraud, Andrew Wakefield, and the absolute fraud, Pauly Tommy, were on billboards in the UK, 90 billboards in the UK, swaying six million votes with autism awareness back in the 2000s.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:30.237
It's all one malevolent show, and Paul Offit has agreed to be a part of it.

01:38:30.297 --> 01:38:36.682
That's why the argument that he makes in 2025 is identical to the argument he was making in 2015, 10 years ago.

01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:37.403
Let's listen.

01:38:39.865 --> 01:38:51.659
2025.

01:38:40.626 --> 01:38:51.659
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

01:38:51.679 --> 01:38:52.761
Hi, Vincent.

01:38:54.366 --> 01:39:03.514
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack called Beyond the Noise, Cutting to the Chase on Important Health Topics.

01:39:04.255 --> 01:39:09.720
I don't know, Paul, when you started this column, did you have any idea that we would end up where we are today?

01:39:10.281 --> 01:39:12.022
No, I don't think anybody did.

01:39:12.343 --> 01:39:19.089
This is as worse than anybody would have ever imagined about how we have just shredded our public health infrastructure.

01:39:19.565 --> 01:39:25.697
Okay, so I would argue that this is all the same script and actually we expected to be here.

01:39:25.757 --> 01:39:29.003
We just wanted to be here like in a different form.

01:39:29.765 --> 01:39:31.107
We wanted to be here with a

01:39:31.707 --> 01:39:32.587
Well, we're all right.

01:39:32.687 --> 01:39:37.850
I mean, we have a pretty small skeptic group that's also skeptic of their leader, right?

01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:42.351
The Skeptical Health Freedom Movement is still skeptical of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:42.371 --> 01:39:44.552
because he hasn't done what he said he was going to do.

01:39:44.612 --> 01:39:52.255
And so we're actually maybe right where we're supposed to be, but maybe there's more people that are skeptical than they wanted to be.

01:39:52.355 --> 01:39:58.238
They wanted this to be a smaller movement than it is, but don't get me wrong, I'm not implying that it's half and half, because it's not.

01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:03.053
but it is still a larger minority than they wanted it to be.

01:40:03.634 --> 01:40:09.698
And so these people are working harder and longer on stage than they ever thought they would need to.

01:40:11.098 --> 01:40:18.843
And so I think it's an interesting place that we are right now because the orchestrated failure of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:18.883 --> 01:40:21.105
is going to be harder than they thought because

01:40:21.725 --> 01:40:23.306
people are so skeptical of him.

01:40:23.866 --> 01:40:27.688
It's gonna be harder than just burning Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:27.968 --> 01:40:35.192
and making him look like a fool and then now everybody else is just gonna have to eat crow when they've already kind of rejected him.

01:40:36.559 --> 01:40:39.481
And a lot of people have already rejected the Health Freedom Movement.

01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:41.102
It's actually pretty spectacular.

01:40:41.122 --> 01:40:46.024
The only place that the Health Freedom Movement actually exists is on these podcasts.

01:40:46.185 --> 01:40:53.769
And because Paul Offit and Vincent Racaniello and all of the people under Steve Bannon's banner say it exists.

01:40:53.929 --> 01:40:55.510
Otherwise, it doesn't exist anywhere.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.411
There's no Health Freedom Movement in Pittsburgh.

01:40:59.093 --> 01:41:07.319
Yeah, just every week something new, the destruction of the CDC, the destruction of public health, destruction of NIH and FDA.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.903
I never envisioned that any of that would happen.

01:41:13.204 --> 01:41:14.404
You know, I didn't think it could.

01:41:15.465 --> 01:41:20.049
Neither did I. You assumed that there were checks and bounces that wouldn't allow it to happen, but we were wrong.

01:41:21.209 --> 01:41:22.931
Well, today we're going to continue with

01:41:24.605 --> 01:41:36.410
It's a destruction of... I mean, if you really want to understand the destruction of public health in America, you have to see that Vincent Racaniello and Paul Offit and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:39.912
are all part of the same team that these six people are.

01:41:41.192 --> 01:41:51.737
The same team that Denny Rancor is on because Denny Rancor was on stage in Romania with Steve Hatfield and Robert Malone and Meryl Ness and Jessica Rose.

01:41:54.972 --> 01:41:59.215
and the no virus people because they've been promoted by CHD and all of them as well.

01:42:01.376 --> 01:42:02.297
It's all one show.

01:42:02.857 --> 01:42:09.021
America is the primary victim, but America is being used to manipulate the rest of the Western world via social media.

01:42:10.121 --> 01:42:16.425
And Americans are being manipulated by actors in those respective places on social media in America.

01:42:18.086 --> 01:42:20.228
And if you see that they are all in the same script,

01:42:21.078 --> 01:42:26.039
you can see that the way out is to get off of social media where their performance takes place.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.300
United States Public Health.

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.561
We're going to take a look at Paul's latest column called Vaccines Don't Save Lives.

01:42:33.162 --> 01:42:33.762
Oh, my gosh.

01:42:34.242 --> 01:42:42.204
So let's start with a hearing where Senator Maria Cantwell presented some information about vaccines.

01:42:42.224 --> 01:42:43.805
That was a finance committee hearing.

01:42:43.825 --> 01:42:44.385
What did she say?

01:42:45.421 --> 01:42:54.275
So she put up a chart that showed how vaccines have saved our lives, millions of lives, allowed us to live decades longer than we did before.

01:42:54.736 --> 01:43:00.085
And she went through sort of vaccine by vaccine by vaccine to show you how many lives were saved.

01:43:00.595 --> 01:43:02.577
The history on vaccines is very clear.

01:43:03.057 --> 01:43:04.739
This is the 20th century.

01:43:04.919 --> 01:43:08.763
That's how many people had vaccines and had illnesses.

01:43:09.163 --> 01:43:10.905
This is the 21st century.

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:13.267
This is the decrease, 99% down to 100%.

01:43:13.307 --> 01:43:15.149
This is what was delivered with vaccines.

01:43:18.945 --> 01:43:22.186
And I presume these charts were based on real data from CDC, right?

01:43:22.326 --> 01:43:39.333
I wonder what other things it would correlate with, like automobile abundance, cell phone abundance, or number of phone numbers in America, or area codes in America, or number of websites.

01:43:41.034 --> 01:43:47.737
I bet you there's 10,000 things that you could have put on that chart and said it correlates with vaccines.

01:43:48.829 --> 01:43:53.750
including sanitation, including nutrition, including lots of other things too.

01:43:54.251 --> 01:43:56.331
And so how will they counter that, right?

01:43:56.371 --> 01:43:59.952
Because of course, on our side, there's been lots of videos of people.

01:44:00.552 --> 01:44:08.235
There are whole books written by Skyhorse Publishing authors that say that Unvax Kids are better than Vax Kids at everything.

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.475
And so what's the big deal?

01:44:10.515 --> 01:44:12.516
Like, how are they gonna counter this?

01:44:13.376 --> 01:44:15.397
That's right, when we still had a CDC, yes.

01:44:15.737 --> 01:44:15.937
Yes.

01:44:17.509 --> 01:44:20.770
So I assume millions of lives had been saved on those charts, right?

01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:21.770
That's right.

01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:24.231
And what was RFK Jr.'

01:44:24.191 --> 01:44:26.772
's response to this presentation?

01:44:27.252 --> 01:44:33.214
Well, that presentation was largely for his benefit, because he has consistently expressed anti-vaccine points of view.

01:44:33.234 --> 01:44:36.435
She wanted to state the obvious, which is that vaccines are important.

01:44:36.455 --> 01:44:41.336
You wouldn't think you would have to say that to somebody who's now Secretary of Health and Human Services, but she did.

01:44:41.897 --> 01:44:45.658
His response was to make a seven-minute video on X

01:44:46.258 --> 01:44:48.280
that basically contradicted what she said.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.321
So he showed predominance.

01:44:50.341 --> 01:45:03.592
So here he is also agreeing that a video on X is a significant statement, a public communication, a relevant thing to discuss, and so a valid way for a public servant to communicate with

01:45:04.312 --> 01:45:17.254
the voting public, and that's kind of terrifying because as I will succinctly say here, PBS NewsHour also agrees that substacks are interesting, that substacks can be worth 150 million dollars.

01:45:17.334 --> 01:45:21.475
If you're a Jewish lesbian and have a right-wing substack, you might get lucky.

01:45:23.435 --> 01:45:30.337
And so he has a substack and agrees that substack is a great way to make money and get a thing out, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:45:30.296 --> 01:45:32.737
's organizations have substacks, so that sucks.

01:45:33.757 --> 01:45:37.200
and they can get on X and say whatever they want to.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:44.005
And so if their misinformation is enticing enough, they can make lots of money, like millions of dollars for a whole decade.

01:45:44.025 --> 01:45:46.787
And there's nothing that anybody can do about it, including me.

01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:55.454
And so we're just supposed to watch the X video because he says it's an X video we should watch.

01:45:56.235 --> 01:46:02.680
It's almost as if it's one national security narrative to get everybody to accept social media as the norm.

01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:06.633
You know, like a trap only two graphs.

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:20.687
He showed a graph of measles in this country over the past say hundred years, and he showed a graph of whooping cough or pertussis over the past hundred years to make the point that the incidence of deaths was declining.

01:46:21.127 --> 01:46:22.408
even before there was a vaccine.

01:46:22.648 --> 01:46:29.453
Well, you can see from this graph that in 1900, some 13,000 Americans a year were dying of measles.

01:46:29.833 --> 01:46:33.276
By 1960, however, this number had dropped to a few hundred.

01:46:33.836 --> 01:46:37.359
But the measles vaccine was not introduced until three years later.

01:46:37.819 --> 01:46:42.445
Therefore, almost all the measles mortality had disappeared before the vaccine.

01:46:42.765 --> 01:46:46.951
So the measles vaccine can't really claim the credit for saving all those lives.

01:46:47.231 --> 01:46:53.959
And that that decline was related to better sanitation, better nutrition, cleaner water, better hygiene, etc.

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:58.923
and to make the point that vaccines really aren't saving our lives.

01:46:59.023 --> 01:47:13.992
It is amazing to me that he felt compelled to do this when we have outbreaks of measles, whooping cough, and influenza that is killing children in this country, that now he wants to put out the notion that, you know, vaccines aren't really saving our lives.

01:47:16.095 --> 01:47:23.857
So, but these measures, sanitation, for example, probably contributed to reduction of deaths, right?

01:47:24.881 --> 01:47:25.582
Yes, it did.

01:47:25.642 --> 01:47:28.764
In the case of measles and whooping cough, yes, it contributed to it.

01:47:28.904 --> 01:47:37.371
But if you look at measles, when the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, we had 500, mostly children, who would die every year from measles.

01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:39.372
We've reduced that to virtually none.

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:46.958
When the whooping cough vaccine was introduced in this country in the late 1940s, we had 9,000 children dying every year from whooping cough.

01:47:47.399 --> 01:47:48.660
Now we have fewer than 10.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.803
So he neglected to mention those two facts when he was showing these charts.

01:47:53.203 --> 01:47:56.305
So this is another example of him lying to make his point.

01:47:56.906 --> 01:47:57.286
That's right.

01:47:57.326 --> 01:48:07.474
He misrepresents information so he can consistently try and make the point that vaccines aren't really that important and that what we should really focus in on is better nutrition.

01:48:09.695 --> 01:48:15.720
So the introduction of vaccines, he would argue

01:48:16.892 --> 01:48:21.995
The decline in deaths is just a continuation of improved sanitation.

01:48:22.055 --> 01:48:23.797
Refrigeration, I think, was one of them.

01:48:23.817 --> 01:48:26.639
I guess that has to do with preserving food, right?

01:48:26.659 --> 01:48:27.619
Right.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.624
So how would you argue that the effect of the vaccine is not just a continuation of those measures?

01:48:36.257 --> 01:48:48.060
Well, because we had sort of hit a nadir, where you would have every year, say for measles you would have three to 4 million cases you'd have 48,000 hospitalizations you'd have 500 deaths every year.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.642
If, after that dramatic improvement occurred, it wasn't until you introduced the measles vaccine you saw a precipitous decline.

01:48:55.442 --> 01:49:10.591
in in hospitalizations and that's the same thing was true with whooping cough so he was sort of ignoring that aspect and also i'm just going to go back one little bit in this thing because there are a number of infections hospitalizations and that's the same thing was true with

01:49:10.931 --> 01:49:37.619
So I would be interested to know between 1963 and 1980 what the trend and messaging in America was about circumcision, and also what the messaging was about cesarean section, also what the messaging was about birth control, and also what the messaging was about breastfeeding.

01:49:38.547 --> 01:49:43.770
because all of those could potentially play a role in this change right here.

01:49:43.850 --> 01:50:03.520
For example, if breastfeeding transitioned down in America around this time, there could be a reason why a measles vaccine might work or be necessary in a country where the trend is that women are stopping breastfeeding, then maybe, maybe,

01:50:05.101 --> 01:50:15.628
earlier cases of measles and therefore more dangerous cases of measles became more prevalent in America because the trend was that breastfeeding was declining.

01:50:15.728 --> 01:50:16.088
I don't know.

01:50:16.108 --> 01:50:26.254
I'm just throwing it out there because one of the reasons why we need to have such an early vaccine schedule is because the assumption is is that women are not going to be breastfeeding.

01:50:28.243 --> 01:50:46.214
And I know that to be biologically true because when we had our first two children in Norway, we were specifically briefed that they didn't even want to talk to us about vaccines until we were done breastfeeding, until the breastfeeding had stopped, then we can talk about vaccines.

01:50:46.274 --> 01:50:49.296
And so that could be as late as year two.

01:50:51.394 --> 01:50:55.078
And there are no widespread outbreaks in Norway.

01:50:55.138 --> 01:50:58.642
I know Norway is not a very crowded place, but come on, let's be reasonable here.

01:50:59.222 --> 01:51:09.213
They invest heavily, like three days in a hospital-sponsored hotel with midwives on a pull string.

01:51:09.733 --> 01:51:15.638
in order to get as many people to successfully breastfeed their newborn as possible in Norway.

01:51:15.758 --> 01:51:23.665
And they also don't push the vaccine schedule unless very specifically you're unable to breastfeed your kid or don't want to for very long.

01:51:24.266 --> 01:51:32.212
They also in that country will give you a C-section if you don't want to give birth and you want to save your breasts.

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:36.276
They will support that choice too in Norway.

01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:43.644
So it's a progressive country in all the bad ways that you imagine these countries are progressive.

01:51:43.664 --> 01:51:44.324
Yes, it is.

01:51:44.825 --> 01:51:47.226
But they haven't thrown out the basics.

01:51:50.128 --> 01:52:06.480
And I think America has more or less thrown out the basics and oversimplified this narrative to there is no limit to the amount of good that vaccines can do because there is no, you know, there is no limit

01:52:07.381 --> 01:52:30.022
to how many vaccines you can give because it's like uh it's the perfect medicine one of the best if not the best invention in human history and that's of course absurd it's got to be absurd because intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s and i have at least 20 books in this room that prove it

01:52:34.406 --> 01:52:36.768
So something is not congruent here.

01:52:36.888 --> 01:52:39.950
And I don't think the onus is on me to figure it all out.

01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:47.696
The onus is on me to be able to show my kids that Paul Offit is just as full of shit as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:52:47.796 --> 01:52:47.896
is.

01:52:48.256 --> 01:52:53.420
And there's no logical explanation for that other than a national security script.

01:52:55.404 --> 01:52:58.626
Dang, that is a dunk if I ever dunked in my life.

01:52:59.226 --> 01:53:02.048
Whooping cough, so he was sort of ignoring that aspect.

01:53:02.248 --> 01:53:10.812
And also, more importantly, there are a number of infections that have been dramatically reduced that had nothing to do with improved sanitation or hygiene.

01:53:11.633 --> 01:53:18.957
Could also argue that the recent introduction of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus has had the same effect, right?

01:53:18.997 --> 01:53:22.339
The same number of cases every year and now suddenly they're declining.

01:53:22.955 --> 01:53:23.515
Exactly right.

01:53:23.535 --> 01:53:44.680
So once over the past year, now that we have a maternal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, and we also have a monoclonal antibody that can be given in the first couple days of life that decreases the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus, just over the past year, you've had a more than 50% decrease in children less than two months of age being hospitalized.

01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.803
to the extent actually that it actually lowered infant mortality rates.

01:53:49.364 --> 01:53:53.507
That's only from the vaccine and the monoclonal antibodies, nothing to do with sanitation or hygiene.

01:53:54.448 --> 01:54:01.795
You also make the point in your column that it's not just about deaths that are prevented by vaccines, but people who survive have other problems, right?

01:54:02.495 --> 01:54:02.735
Sure.

01:54:02.995 --> 01:54:06.536
I mean, measles virus can cause blindness and deafness.

01:54:06.677 --> 01:54:08.817
Mumps virus can cause deafness also.

01:54:09.738 --> 01:54:18.701
Rubella or German measles can cause congenital rubella syndrome, which would cause 20,000 cases every year of blindness and deafness and heart defects in children.

01:54:19.261 --> 01:54:23.443
and also Haemophilus influenzae B, which certainly dominated my pediatric residency.

01:54:23.503 --> 01:54:24.944
I mean, I was a pediatric resident.

01:54:25.244 --> 01:54:31.508
Hibtiter is one of the worst vaccines that's ever been on the schedule, owned by Wyeth, bought by Pfizer.

01:54:32.549 --> 01:54:37.731
Lots of data out there, lots of kids injured, just like the DTP vaccine, lots of kids injured.

01:54:37.792 --> 01:54:46.737
But somehow or another, Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy and Del Bigtree decided to make a video about the MMR.

01:54:47.918 --> 01:54:49.719
Just as a pity, right?

01:54:50.419 --> 01:54:52.040
It's just a pity that they got it wrong.

01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:59.464
I mean, it's really a pity that they got it wrong, isn't it?

01:54:59.484 --> 01:55:00.184
It's just a pity.

01:55:01.212 --> 01:55:18.427
Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh from 1977 to 1980, when I was on call in the emergency department, I would do two to three spinal taps every night because most of what we saw was Haemophilus influenzae B, which was a bacteria that caused meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, epiglottitis.

01:55:19.168 --> 01:55:23.912
Now, most residents at our hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, don't know how to do spinal taps.

01:55:24.753 --> 01:55:29.335
have a person come in with meningitis, it's often the interventional radiologist that does the spinal tap.

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:36.097
Because we've gone from 20 to 25,000 cases every year of Haemophilus influenzae type B to virtually less.

01:55:36.157 --> 01:55:39.458
And here we are talking about vaccinating people against a what?

01:55:39.538 --> 01:55:40.359
A bacteria.

01:55:40.819 --> 01:55:42.059
Very, very different.

01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:51.203
The Hib-Titer vaccine was actually a very small Haemophilus influenzae B bacteria

01:55:52.199 --> 01:55:57.884
epitope tied to a ridiculously large portion of the diphtheria toxin, which is hilarious.

01:56:11.787 --> 01:56:16.190
One virus absent from his presentation was poliovirus.

01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:20.012
Why didn't he mention the effect of sanitation on that infection?

01:56:20.452 --> 01:56:22.454
Well, see, you know this story much better than I do.

01:56:23.414 --> 01:56:28.277
Polio was a common disease in the 1910s, 20s, 30s, 40s.

01:56:28.657 --> 01:56:37.963
And then what happened was probably because intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to cure a wide variety of ailments was very common in the late

01:56:39.013 --> 01:56:56.534
1800s and early 1900s, and I have about 10 books in the room that describe all the ways that an intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection that creates a good lump can resolve chronic pain, can resolve all kinds of ailments.

01:56:57.577 --> 01:57:15.012
And physicians around the world considered the invention of the hypodermic needle and the ability to put precise amounts and concentrations of substances anywhere you wanted in the body with precision to be the best invention in modern history.

01:57:16.413 --> 01:57:18.055
And so it's a weird thing, right?

01:57:18.115 --> 01:57:21.498
That they've almost got it, but they don't got it.

01:57:23.393 --> 01:57:25.777
Housatonic Live out of Boston, Massachusetts.

01:57:25.837 --> 01:57:33.989
Mark Kulak found an article where Paul Offit can be quoted as saying, you know, the ideal vaccine schedule would all be oral, but.

01:57:37.768 --> 01:57:41.492
I guess for now we're stuck with intramuscular injection because it's dumb, right?

01:57:55.706 --> 01:57:59.028
paralysis, mostly they suffered a summer gastroenteritis.

01:57:59.368 --> 01:58:02.390
So the mother would then transfer those antibodies passively to the baby.

01:58:02.631 --> 01:58:05.532
Because polio was common, the baby was often exposed.

01:58:05.873 --> 01:58:07.674
Oh, you mean by breastfeeding?

01:58:07.754 --> 01:58:14.518
You mean breastfeeding can protect babies from stuff so that you don't have to give them intramuscular injections when they're little tiny babies?

01:58:14.838 --> 01:58:24.965
Oh, that's interesting, because when they're little tiny babies would be when they're most vulnerable, you know, during the pattern, integrities, developmental trajectory through time.

01:58:26.681 --> 01:58:38.423
You know, the fundamental principle of biology that all these jackasses are scripted to ignore and instead only emphasize the central dogma that evolution is real because we found DNA and stuff.

01:58:39.787 --> 01:58:41.327
to polio early in life.

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:43.768
So it was kind of this passive active immunity.

01:58:44.068 --> 01:58:48.869
You would get exposed to the virus at the same time you were getting antibodies from the mother, which were protective.

01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:52.950
So the term infantile paralysis was always, I think, an incorrect term.

01:58:53.370 --> 01:59:02.792
As we got better and better at having better hygiene, better sanitation, now the mother's antibodies would have worn off by the time the child was finally exposed to the virus when he was five years of age.

01:59:03.332 --> 01:59:07.074
nine years of age, and then you saw an actually increase in paralysis.

01:59:07.094 --> 01:59:12.316
So sanitation and hygiene improvements only increase the instance of polio in this country.

01:59:12.656 --> 01:59:14.457
And so what stopped polio in this country?

01:59:14.477 --> 01:59:15.317
A vaccine.

01:59:15.517 --> 01:59:21.039
A vaccine that was introduced first in 1955 and that basically eliminated polio from this country by 1979.

01:59:21.079 --> 01:59:21.419
Nothing to do.

01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:41.461
that's a pretty funny graph it looks like polio was just going bananas for some reason for a little while there i just it's it's remarkable ladies and gentlemen it's remarkable because of course buried in the the canon of anti-vax stuff is this stupid book where this lady got on joe rogan last year and

01:59:41.881 --> 01:59:48.963
was gonna break the internet, but it didn't happen because she can't say that intramuscular injection's a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:59:49.423 --> 01:59:51.644
She can't say it because she's scripted not to.

01:59:51.704 --> 01:59:55.825
Instead, she's scripted to say some version of what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:55.845 --> 02:00:05.407
was scripted to say, something dumb, something nonspecific, something naive, something that could be used essentially to discredit us eventually.

02:00:05.467 --> 02:00:09.028
Instead of a meaningful resistance, a meaningful objection,

02:00:09.808 --> 02:00:14.590
Never mind a more useful model that could replace the old one.

02:00:15.871 --> 02:00:18.932
Sanitation or hygiene and everything to do, again, with that vaccine.

02:00:20.232 --> 02:00:30.717
I wonder if he knows this and he ignores it because it doesn't fit his narrative or he isn't actually aware of it.

02:00:30.737 --> 02:00:31.477
Most people are not.

02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:34.472
You're right, most people are not.

02:00:34.592 --> 02:00:42.277
I mean, what's interesting to me is when I published that sub stack about this particular issue, I had a number of infectious disease specialists in our hospital say, I didn't know that.

02:00:43.538 --> 02:00:52.084
Yeah, you would always assume that the impact of sanitation is a positive one, but in the case of polio, it interestingly was a negative one.

02:00:52.104 --> 02:01:02.571
I mean, all the positive effects outweigh it, but still, yeah, that was responsible for the increase post 1900 when we started to see bigger and bigger outbreaks in the US.

02:01:05.572 --> 02:01:12.515
So, there are many things that RFK says that are inconsistent.

02:01:12.895 --> 02:01:14.276
Surprise, surprise, right?

02:01:15.296 --> 02:01:21.359
For example, he's allowed the CDC to say you can get a COVID vaccine, you could get a flu vaccine.

02:01:21.859 --> 02:01:24.680
Why would he do that if he says they don't save lives?

02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:30.874
I can't imagine to understand how he thinks.

02:01:31.094 --> 02:01:31.614
I don't know.

02:01:31.634 --> 02:01:44.565
I mean, if you look at what he's done just regarding one aspect of the COVID vaccine, at the end of May, he stood up and did a one-minute video with Marty Makary, the commissioner of FDA on his right, and Jay Bhattacharya, the head of NIH on his left.

02:01:44.605 --> 02:01:52.111
And he said, we, Health and Human Services, are no longer going to recommend this COVID vaccine for healthy children or healthy pregnant women.

02:01:52.211 --> 02:01:52.811
That's what he said.

02:01:52.891 --> 02:01:55.974
And then he said, it's just good science and common sense.

02:01:56.474 --> 02:02:07.820
I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today, the COVID... Now remember, what I'm suggesting is, is that podcasting allowed them to justify Marty's appointment.

02:02:09.621 --> 02:02:11.382
Podcasting in a stupid book.

02:02:12.162 --> 02:02:25.189
And he was podcasting very specifically with two people related to the same network of Stanford, Vinay Prasad and ZDoggMD, Zubin, whatever his name is.

02:02:26.783 --> 02:02:42.477
They're all one malevolent show and their track record over the last six years reveals them as scripted actors that auditioned and honed their little shtick over six years in preparation for this in the same way that Jay Bhattacharya did.

02:02:43.157 --> 02:02:50.043
And Jay Bhattacharya told me to my face three times in 2024 that he was basically being promoted via

02:02:51.767 --> 02:02:54.449
Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:02:54.609 --> 02:03:01.055
to the Trump administration and for NIH secretary and predicted that he would get that job.

02:03:03.457 --> 02:03:19.330
Told me to stop talking about Robert Malone, stop naming names and to stick to the biology in hopes that this would get this far and that I would shut my mouth, that maybe I would be the lab leak, gain-of-function hero that they wanted me, descripted me to be.

02:03:20.010 --> 02:03:20.651
But I haven't.

02:03:23.891 --> 02:03:25.332
I threw everything, I'm all in.

02:03:25.993 --> 02:03:39.022
That guy scripted, that guy scripted, Jay Bhattacharya is definitely scripted and people involved in this made me meet him three different times during the course of the pandemic to try and set me up.

02:03:39.562 --> 02:03:49.870
Just in the same way they tried to pay me as a dissident for CHD, as a staff scientist under Brian Hooker and Mary Holland, two of the biggest frauds in American history.

02:03:50.799 --> 02:04:03.699
and definitely two of the worst Americans alive right now, tried to get me to be behind this fraud, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's definitely a scripted fraud, because he hasn't made any intellectual progress in 20 years.

02:04:05.819 --> 02:04:13.946
And I suspect that Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone have been behind him and his script since they killed Brandy Vaughn and before.

02:04:14.527 --> 02:04:16.689
Since they made Vaxxed and before.

02:04:16.769 --> 02:04:19.671
Since they recruited Brian Hooker and before.

02:04:20.152 --> 02:04:22.134
This is as shitty as it gets.

02:04:22.674 --> 02:04:44.665
And any of these foreign actors that are associated with these people are all part of a NATO-based network, or a Five Eyes-based network, that is responsible for the controlled demolition of American culture and the American system, the American economy, and the American dollar, so that the most can be blamed on the American dream.

02:04:45.225 --> 02:04:47.286
The most, so that they can demolish it.

02:04:47.326 --> 02:04:49.407
Maybe even bring in a North American union.

02:04:50.842 --> 02:04:59.145
vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.

02:05:00.366 --> 02:05:10.149
With these two heads of NIH and FDA nodding in agreement, then what he did was he took that off the CDC immunization schedule.

02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:13.430
So if you looked at COVID and pregnancy, it was a non-recommendation.

02:05:13.871 --> 02:05:14.791
Now more recently,

02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:26.407
the COVID vaccine is recommended for pregnant women under these sort of guise of individual decision-making or shared clinical decision-making.

02:05:26.687 --> 02:05:34.152
And so he's gone from not recommending it, putting it on the schedule, and now apparently it is recommended with shared clinical decision-making.

02:05:34.192 --> 02:05:36.654
So it's confusing, and I think that's the point.

02:05:36.934 --> 02:05:44.999
I think the point is to be confusing because as people are confused, immunization rates will erode, and that is his goal, to make vaccines less available

02:05:45.339 --> 02:05:46.761
less affordable and more feared.

02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:51.868
He thinks vaccines have simply replaced infectious diseases with chronic diseases.

02:05:52.128 --> 02:05:53.630
He says that over and over again.

02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:59.517
He thinks his mission is to eliminate chronic diseases, which in large part means eliminating vaccines.

02:05:59.658 --> 02:06:01.981
I don't think people realize how serious he is about this.

02:06:03.436 --> 02:06:10.464
What's unfortunate is that one person's view is controlling the narrative now in the US.

02:06:11.505 --> 02:06:18.192
He has, you know, the anti-vaxxer crowd behind him and a small handful of Americans.

02:06:18.212 --> 02:06:19.914
But I think most people realize that

02:06:20.675 --> 02:06:21.536
Vaccines are important.

02:06:21.576 --> 02:06:35.605
Just looking at the comments in this sub stack One lady said vaccines are the best things that you looking at the comments in sub stack so now we have vincent rack and yellow the preeminent earth's virologist and

02:06:36.465 --> 02:07:02.393
and longtime Vax proponent and expert vaccinologist Paul Offit, trained under Hilary Koprowski and under Stanley Plotkin, he is advocating for Substack as being a place where you can find the truth and even in Substack comments, you know, where all these people or let's say their cyber representatives

02:07:03.536 --> 02:07:06.318
interact with all of us all the time.

02:07:06.378 --> 02:07:16.044
And if you just argue with the right person on Substack, if you just get the right zinger in, in the right Substack comment section, you might change the world.

02:07:19.547 --> 02:07:22.409
And that is the biggest bullshit story ever.

02:07:23.289 --> 02:07:26.892
But these guys seem to agree just like everybody else, because they're scripted actors.

02:07:30.006 --> 02:07:30.486
Could be.

02:07:30.906 --> 02:07:34.187
So how can we let one person dictate this?

02:07:34.267 --> 02:07:35.307
I just don't understand it.

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:40.168
I thought our system was resilient enough that it wouldn't be affected in that way.

02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:54.392
So did I. I mean, if you look at polls of parents' attitudes about vaccines, if you sort of set aside the COVID vaccine, most parents, Republican or Democrat, more than 80 percent value vaccines, value school vaccine entry requirements.

02:07:54.852 --> 02:07:55.592
So he doesn't

02:07:56.152 --> 02:07:58.173
represent most parents, not at all.

02:07:58.353 --> 02:08:06.195
He represents a small part of very loud, vocal parents that have, at some level, kind of infiltrated this whole Make America Healthy Again movement.

02:08:06.835 --> 02:08:10.816
But he doesn't represent most parents, since you would think, since he doesn't represent most parents.

02:08:10.876 --> 02:08:16.898
And we have people who are in the House and people who are in the Senate who represent those parents, that they would stand up.

02:08:17.278 --> 02:08:18.718
Because I know that they're getting letters.

02:08:18.858 --> 02:08:20.159
They are getting letters from parents.

02:08:20.199 --> 02:08:21.919
I've had Congressmen tell me that.

02:08:22.339 --> 02:08:24.380
Yet still, they just refuse to stand up

02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:38.265
for the health of children in this country because they... Isn't it funny how all the letters of vaccine injured parents go to Aaron Seery and all the letters that are pro-vaccine go to Paul Offit?

02:08:38.665 --> 02:08:39.486
It's weird, right?

02:08:39.526 --> 02:08:42.987
Because you would think that if you were interested in changing the world,

02:08:43.507 --> 02:08:53.290
then you would take your case to Paul Offit if your kids developed autism, and you would take your case to CHD if you thought that vaccines were great.

02:08:53.730 --> 02:09:09.615
But instead, there seems to be this kind of unfortunate agreement that if we have a really compelling story about how our kid was damaged by a vaccine, we should take it to somebody like Aaron Seery, who already has a whole collection of these letters.

02:09:10.015 --> 02:09:11.876
Instead of taking it to somebody like this,

02:09:12.296 --> 02:09:14.838
who seems to think that it's really anecdotal.

02:09:15.498 --> 02:09:16.199
Isn't it funny?

02:09:16.839 --> 02:09:19.662
It's almost like they're on a national security bullshit script.

02:09:19.802 --> 02:09:24.005
They value their political career apparently more than they value the health of the children in this country.

02:09:24.045 --> 02:09:26.567
Until that changes, children are going to continue to suffer.

02:09:28.768 --> 02:09:30.169
Let's do a hypothetical, Paul.

02:09:30.209 --> 02:09:33.952
Let's say that at the next elections, Congress is flipped.

02:09:34.993 --> 02:09:37.234
Would that have any impact on what RFK Jr.

02:09:37.274 --> 02:09:37.615
is doing?

02:09:38.379 --> 02:09:39.039
I think it would.

02:09:39.059 --> 02:09:45.281
I think if they have a majority in the House, I do think they will be able to force play enough to at least get R.F.K.

02:09:45.301 --> 02:09:45.661
Jr.

02:09:45.701 --> 02:09:47.101
to be replaced.

02:09:47.201 --> 02:09:55.243
And so you can still have your Maha movement, about which there are many good things, but not have an anti-vaccine activist heading that Maha movement.

02:09:55.323 --> 02:09:56.384
I do think that's possible.

02:09:56.404 --> 02:10:00.225
But then again, I'm an optimist because, as you know, I'm a Philadelphia Eagles fan.

02:10:01.625 --> 02:10:11.833
Okay, well on that note I'll leave a link to this column in the show notes so you can go read it yourself Substance noise with dr. Paul off it.

02:10:12.113 --> 02:10:12.734
Thank you Paul.

02:10:13.054 --> 02:10:26.725
Thank you Of course you should be terrified because Andrew Huff was on

02:10:29.744 --> 02:10:35.286
Tucker Carlson, why is that important in 2025, in October of 2025?

02:10:35.386 --> 02:10:37.787
Because a wide variety of reasons.

02:10:38.768 --> 02:10:54.194
There is an early video with Andrew Huff and Robert Malone where Andrew Huff talks all about EcoHealth Alliance and the CIA and they use a lot of lingo like over and whatever.

02:10:57.395 --> 02:10:59.376
And that's a very damning video.

02:11:00.537 --> 02:11:05.302
But for me, what's a little more damning is that when I went to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:11:05.282 --> 02:11:09.345
's presidential announcement in Boston on invitation from CHD,

02:11:10.845 --> 02:11:15.729
And was backstage, I was in the third row of that announcement.

02:11:16.590 --> 02:11:21.674
I was one row in front of Meryl Ness and Abby Rockefeller.

02:11:22.195 --> 02:11:26.619
And just down the same row from Robert Malone.

02:11:26.699 --> 02:11:28.360
So it's an interesting place to be.

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:31.423
It was crazy actually in retrospect.

02:11:32.083 --> 02:11:48.354
And when I was walking into the hotel where that event would take place, this man, Andrew Huff, about six foot five, so good eye contact with me, came out of the revolving door, side door that I was going in.

02:11:49.715 --> 02:12:01.563
And in a very revealing, startling statement, Andrew Huff, of course, I recognized him and also kind of came to the thought like, well, I didn't think that Andrew Huff was so tall.

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:10.765
He, the very first words that came out of his surprised mouth were, oh wow, I didn't expect you to be this big.

02:12:12.006 --> 02:12:32.339
So in that admission in Boston in 2023, you know, in November of 2023, the same month that Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, Stephen Hatfield, Nick Hudson, and, and Denny Rancor and a bunch of other clowns would be on stage in Romania.

02:12:34.164 --> 02:12:35.784
at an international COVID summit.

02:12:36.365 --> 02:12:41.886
That same month, Andrew Huff met me in Boston at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:12:41.866 --> 02:12:47.247
's announcement with none other than Charles Rixey chasing him around.

02:12:47.787 --> 02:12:52.249
Yes, Charles Rixey, the guy that came to my house in January of 2022, about two weeks after

02:12:54.440 --> 02:13:01.363
the Health and, you know, the Human Genome Project Research and Development Director, Kevin McKernan, was on my stream.

02:13:02.544 --> 02:13:03.825
Charles Rixey came to my house.

02:13:04.225 --> 02:13:11.448
Then three years later, I saw them together at Boston, and he's running around like a little dog chasing Andrew Huff.

02:13:11.488 --> 02:13:14.250
And Andrew Huff didn't say, hey, I'm Andrew Huff.

02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:15.450
You're Jonathan Cooley.

02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:16.331
I'm happy to meet you.

02:13:16.711 --> 02:13:20.713
He just said in one sentence, wow, I didn't expect you to be so big.

02:13:23.171 --> 02:13:29.654
Which is, oddly enough, the same thing that Steve Kirsch said to me the first time he saw me in person.

02:13:33.996 --> 02:13:35.817
It's all hilarious, ladies and gentlemen.

02:13:35.877 --> 02:13:38.438
This is an admission that this is all one show.

02:13:38.458 --> 02:13:44.281
A Steve Bannon, Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:44.481 --> 02:13:46.062
Trump bullshit show.

02:13:47.398 --> 02:13:55.024
You want to save America, you want to save your country in the EU, you want to save your homeland in the EU, this is the way to save it.

02:13:55.885 --> 02:14:11.137
To realize that social media has been weaponized against us, and it's not the algorithm, it's not out of their control, it is precisely under their control, and specifically under the control of scripted actors.

02:14:16.184 --> 02:14:17.689
scripted actors, ladies and gentlemen.

02:14:19.423 --> 02:14:25.968
I think most people have concluded that the creation of COVID was probably not what they told us.

02:14:26.048 --> 02:14:30.071
It probably didn't evolve naturally out of a pangolin in a seafood market.

02:14:30.812 --> 02:14:34.114
And that the Wuhan Institute of Virology probably played a role.

02:14:34.234 --> 02:14:41.580
OK, so this is, I'm going to have to adjust this because somehow or another, they have so much base on there right now, it's hurting my ears.

02:14:42.421 --> 02:14:48.846
The US government played a role, but it is impossible to find anyone, or has been for us anyway, to find anyone

02:14:49.466 --> 02:14:54.090
who has kind of a direct connection to any of the main players here, and none of them will do an interview.

02:14:55.211 --> 02:14:55.451
None.

02:14:56.772 --> 02:14:59.795
You were the vice president of the EcoHealth Alliance.

02:14:59.815 --> 02:15:12.325
You're a former military guy, tied to the intel world, you worked at a federal nuclear lab in New Mexico for years, and then you wind up at your scientist PhD,

02:15:12.645 --> 02:15:16.608
He worked at a federal laboratory in New Mexico for years.

02:15:16.688 --> 02:15:21.071
The same laboratory where a lot of the sequencing algorithms were developed.

02:15:21.091 --> 02:15:22.992
You know that Los Alamos laboratory?

02:15:23.052 --> 02:15:35.060
The same place where Dan Saratkin of Harvard to the Big House that was first published in February or March of 2020 in Zero Hedge and promoted my lab leak bike ride.

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.082
That guy's dad also worked there.

02:15:40.748 --> 02:15:41.609
Carl Saratkin.

02:15:42.049 --> 02:15:44.410
Yes, at the same place where this jackass worked.

02:15:44.751 --> 02:15:46.292
And they're just going to state it out loud.

02:15:46.332 --> 02:15:59.000
Don't forget that in 2021, Tucker Carlson on his own Fox program announced that drastic was a real group and it was on Twitter and they were blowing the whistle on the lab leak.

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:09.487
And it was founded by some French guy and, and Metzl, the futurist.

02:16:10.626 --> 02:16:14.167
Like it's a joke, and that was also reported in Vanity Fair.

02:16:14.888 --> 02:16:24.371
At the time, I was actually in Drastic and livid that nobody in Drastic seemed to care that the founding of the organization was being attributed to somebody that clearly just joined.

02:16:25.992 --> 02:16:29.833
And this was even before Charles Rixey joined Drastic.

02:16:29.893 --> 02:16:31.194
That's the remarkable thing.

02:16:32.711 --> 02:16:47.264
This is an extraordinary admission and I think I'm going to have to leave the majority of this video for later because it's just so crazy and I'll play us out with chips in a few minutes but I'll just play a few more minutes so you get a taste for how absurd it is.

02:16:47.904 --> 02:16:50.585
that they can't come off of the script.

02:16:50.685 --> 02:16:55.267
That's the reason why Kevin McCairn in Japan or wherever the hell he is will not stop.

02:16:55.747 --> 02:16:58.548
That's the reason why Mary Talley Bowden cannot stop.

02:16:58.608 --> 02:17:03.269
That's the reason why the lawyer from Grace's dad is not stopping.

02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:12.053
That's the reason why Brooke Jackson is not stopping, why Peter McCullough won't stop, why Pierre Kory won't stop, why Steve Kirsch won't stop, because they can't.

02:17:12.213 --> 02:17:15.814
If they do, they will admit that this has been a scripted hoax

02:17:17.096 --> 02:17:18.717
and that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:17:19.277 --> 02:17:24.519
was part of it, that Trump is a part of it, that it's all just one malevolent shit show.

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:26.780
We never elected anybody.

02:17:27.681 --> 02:17:28.781
Nobody was shot.

02:17:29.662 --> 02:17:30.462
You wind up.

02:17:31.713 --> 02:17:34.754
working for EcoHealth Alliance in New York City.

02:17:35.354 --> 02:17:44.838
You think it's like this World Wildlife Fund operation designed to like track diseases among wildlife globally and protect the wildlife, protect the people.

02:17:44.918 --> 02:17:47.059
It's like kind of a crunchy outfit.

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:55.502
And they got on 60 Minutes despite 60 Minutes being a awesome, the gold standard of journalism.

02:17:55.542 --> 02:18:00.044
They were able to fool 60 Minutes into doing multiple specials on them over the course of 20 years.

02:18:04.532 --> 02:18:06.372
Come on, come on!

02:18:06.692 --> 02:18:07.493
...gooders basically.

02:18:08.393 --> 02:18:16.115
You show up there, you help them raise a bunch of money from the feds, and you become the vice president, and then you discover it's not what you thought.

02:18:16.255 --> 02:18:19.956
So that's the story that you told me at breakfast, which is an amazing story.

02:18:20.456 --> 02:18:21.837
Oh, he only told it at breakfast.

02:18:21.877 --> 02:18:35.367
You know, the story that I've heard him tell multiple times is that he was in a shootout with who he assumes is the Michigan state police, maybe the state patrol, possibly the FBI on his property in upper Michigan.

02:18:36.108 --> 02:18:38.590
And he shot over 150 rounds at this still identified, uh,

02:18:41.932 --> 02:18:46.714
unidentified group of law enforcement officers who were on his property for an unknown reason.

02:18:47.134 --> 02:18:51.535
He even ran back to the house where his wife and toddler were sheltering to reload.

02:18:53.316 --> 02:18:55.236
This is a real story that he told.

02:18:55.456 --> 02:19:01.178
So if he doesn't tell that story in this Tucker Carlson interview, it will be another admission.

02:19:01.258 --> 02:19:03.199
And if he tells the story, it's an admission.

02:19:04.838 --> 02:19:05.679
150 rounds.

02:19:06.299 --> 02:19:08.021
He ran back to his house to reload.

02:19:08.762 --> 02:19:11.746
Those cops or FBI agents, they just left.

02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:17.452
There was a helicopter and stuff and drones on his property.

02:19:19.354 --> 02:19:21.177
And Charles Rixey and him traveled together.

02:19:25.666 --> 02:19:28.568
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of the program for today.

02:19:28.628 --> 02:19:29.509
I will be on tomorrow.

02:19:29.569 --> 02:19:31.571
I apologize for not being here yesterday.

02:19:32.311 --> 02:19:37.695
I'm still getting my feet underneath me and still trying to transition into the new schedule.

02:19:38.496 --> 02:19:43.760
But I will be more and more regularly on to the point where you might start to get annoyed.

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:44.881
So just beware.

02:19:46.782 --> 02:19:47.563
We're almost there.

02:19:47.603 --> 02:19:49.384
We're almost completely there.

02:19:49.604 --> 02:19:53.227
And that's really exciting because that means that these people are in big trouble.

02:19:54.648 --> 02:19:55.550
Hoo-ha-ha!

02:19:56.291 --> 02:19:57.252
Gonna see you very soon.

02:19:57.653 --> 02:20:02.640
We'll just watch the rest of this tomorrow if we don't have anything else to do, so that'll guarantee that I'm there.

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.160
See you later.

02:20:29.022 --> 02:20:32.257
This is bad.
