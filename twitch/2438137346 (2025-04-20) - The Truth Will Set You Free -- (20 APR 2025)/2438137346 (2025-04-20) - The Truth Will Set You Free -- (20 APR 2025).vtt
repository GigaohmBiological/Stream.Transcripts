WEBVTT

02:20.677 --> 02:27.322
What's your reaction when you see, it seems like you have a fan base and a support, like the everyday guy loves you.

02:27.803 --> 02:31.145
It seems like all over the league now people are just kind of taking you.

02:31.166 --> 02:35.309
What's that kind of support and that affection like from the fans?

02:36.817 --> 02:38.638
Well, I definitely appreciate it.

02:38.658 --> 02:47.881
I feel like it comes because I look like an ordinary person and I feel like I give hope to everybody that is the same size as me.

02:48.881 --> 02:51.122
I'm not necessarily the most athletic.

02:52.702 --> 02:55.205
But with hard work, you can make it a long way.

02:55.265 --> 03:00.552
And I feel like I'm the prime example of that, that I never quit and I'll keep going.

03:00.612 --> 03:04.117
And anything you put your mind to in life, you can accomplish it.

03:04.217 --> 03:08.322
So I'm proud to give hope to those people.

03:12.535 --> 03:15.816
Where is he?

03:47.243 --> 03:50.826
It's real.

03:50.986 --> 03:51.606
It's real.

03:51.626 --> 03:53.367
It's real.

03:53.507 --> 03:55.309
Full speed, Kevin.

04:16.977 --> 04:21.099
think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.580
And I have lied.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.640
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:24.660 --> 04:25.601
I don't want to lie.

04:26.081 --> 04:27.442
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:27.542 --> 04:28.562
I try not to be a liar.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.443
I don't want to be a liar.

04:30.023 --> 04:32.744
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:34.906 --> 04:36.848
the specialization should make you suspicious.

04:37.508 --> 04:43.754
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

04:44.194 --> 04:46.156
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

04:46.176 --> 04:48.698
And that's sort of my starting bias.

05:23.397 --> 05:30.919
I've seen the toughest around.

05:33.440 --> 05:38.342
And I know, baby, just how you feel.

05:40.782 --> 05:45.524
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real.

05:55.078 --> 06:02.199
♪ I ain't the worst that you've seen ♪ ♪ Can't you see what I mean?

06:02.340 --> 06:15.582
♪ ♪ Might as well jump, jump ♪ ♪ Might as well jump ♪ ♪ Go ahead and jump, jump ♪ ♪ Go ahead and jump ♪ ♪ Oh, and you, who said that?

06:15.602 --> 06:18.363
♪ ♪ Baby, how you been? ♪

06:29.411 --> 06:33.372
I don't know until you begin Can't you see me standing here?

06:33.512 --> 06:53.777
I got my back against the wrecking machine I ain't the worst that you've seen Why can't you see what I mean?

06:53.857 --> 06:56.018
Well jump, jump Go ahead and jump

07:58.350 --> 07:59.015
you

08:37.361 --> 08:38.363
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

08:38.604 --> 08:39.064
I'm an MD.

08:39.125 --> 08:39.806
I'm a physician.

08:40.627 --> 08:45.236
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology, subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

08:45.256 --> 08:46.459
I do molecular biology.

08:46.479 --> 08:49.124
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

08:55.097 --> 08:57.399
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

08:57.439 --> 08:58.179
Welcome to the show.

08:58.199 --> 09:04.723
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:04.763 --> 09:06.645
These people are on stage together.

09:06.665 --> 09:10.647
And if you want to get your kids out, you got a few months left.

09:10.687 --> 09:14.050
You got a few years left to get your kids out of this trap.

09:14.590 --> 09:15.871
That's the reality of it.

09:16.071 --> 09:17.992
I don't like to breathe that message, guy.

09:18.012 --> 09:21.634
I don't want to do this on an Easter, but I've got a free Sunday.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.317
And I haven't been made to see this for nothing.

09:26.298 --> 09:31.462
I have not been gifted this royal flush of a hand for nothing.

09:32.223 --> 09:36.066
It is because we have this one chance to see the stage.

09:36.526 --> 09:44.152
We have this one chance to see the Lollapalooza of Liars as clearly as it has ever been visible in recent history.

09:44.232 --> 09:45.794
Our parents never had a chance.

09:46.474 --> 09:48.055
to see it like we can see it.

09:48.155 --> 09:53.058
Our parents never understood that their consciousness was already prime real estate when they were young.

09:53.819 --> 09:57.481
And certainly our parents don't understand it now, but we can.

09:58.002 --> 10:09.129
Because we are a generation that grew up understanding that everything wasn't as we were told on television, that we could see things that they lied about.

10:09.189 --> 10:12.452
But now you need to understand that this has expanded.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.053
It's gone all total.

10:14.753 --> 10:16.935
There is no truth available on television.

10:17.495 --> 10:24.461
There is no truth available on social media that isn't obfuscated and distorted enough to be useless.

10:25.711 --> 10:32.535
Gigon Biological represents some kind of hope in this, simply because we are trying to find the truth.

10:32.595 --> 10:38.058
Simply because we are trying to rule out the implausible and the impossible.

10:38.698 --> 10:51.745
Simply because we are trying to acknowledge all the people that came before us with these ideas, fighting these things to try and figure out how long has it been since this mythology has been our trap?

10:51.805 --> 10:53.386
How long have we been trapped here?

10:54.508 --> 10:59.790
Ladies and gentlemen, since I was a little kid, I've had a dream of maybe being a basketball player someday.

10:59.851 --> 11:08.415
And so I'm trying to take advantage of this situation and get myself back in shape and to start teaching biology on the basketball court.

11:08.455 --> 11:14.497
That is coming very soon, although it does take a certain degree of physical fitness in order to do that effectively.

11:14.537 --> 11:21.781
And so that's what I've been working on in the background, in addition to trying to get a basic biology book done, which is not an easy task.

11:22.821 --> 11:30.946
But I am very excited to tell you that I am making progress on all sorts of fronts, including an incredible amount of reading.

11:30.966 --> 11:32.727
Am I cutting to the right one?

11:32.747 --> 11:33.128
There we go.

11:33.748 --> 11:34.388
Hello, everybody.

11:34.429 --> 11:35.029
Welcome to the show.

11:35.049 --> 11:41.833
This is Gigaon Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of his garage.

11:41.853 --> 11:43.014
Happy Easter, everyone.

11:44.272 --> 11:45.574
It is the 20th of April, 2025.

11:46.534 --> 11:50.358
I think the 20th of April is also significant for some other reason.

11:51.358 --> 11:54.581
It's 420, I guess, is one of the reasons why it's significant.

11:54.721 --> 11:59.025
Anyway, however you decide to celebrate this day, please celebrate it with truth.

11:59.605 --> 12:01.127
Please celebrate it with your kids.

12:01.247 --> 12:03.389
Please try to make a connection between

12:04.847 --> 12:16.543
generations and between the people that you love and celebrate that community, celebrate that fellowship, celebrate that common desire.

12:17.585 --> 12:21.430
Remember that in a hundred years from now, everyone on this planet is going to be dead.

12:22.168 --> 12:28.390
And so it doesn't really matter all the things that you cheer about and which team you rooted for.

12:28.450 --> 12:35.891
It's gonna matter more about what you leave for your children and what children you leave behind and what they think and know, what they dream about.

12:36.012 --> 12:49.055
And so to all the people out there that decided not to have kids because you skillfully used social media or the malevolent messaging in mainstream media made you think that that was the right choice, I assure you,

12:49.815 --> 12:57.102
The simple fact that in a hundred years everyone living on this planet will be dead is the reason why that's a lie.

12:58.403 --> 13:12.596
The only thing we really have to contribute to the future are the children that we leave behind because of the simple fact that at best we are a 100 year candle that burns quickly and can be blown out in an instant.

13:14.332 --> 13:24.699
And so more than anything, I know for sure that I'm not going to waste another minute of my life pursuing the needs of a boss or the desires of a boss.

13:24.739 --> 13:36.667
But I am on a multi-generational time horizon now, trying to make sure that my children are prepared to raise children that can end this nonsense.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.564
And so that's the kind of hope that I'm trying to bring to the table.

13:40.584 --> 13:44.829
GigaOM is not for everyone, but it is for anyone in pursuit of the truth.

13:46.011 --> 13:52.940
And the truth really revolves around you and I understanding and our children understanding that this is for all the marbles.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.884
This is for the children of earth.

13:57.557 --> 14:02.385
And our children need to understand it's not just about Snapchat and social media.

14:02.505 --> 14:07.314
It's about the generation that comes after the generation that acquiesces to that.

14:08.510 --> 14:16.436
And so we are at a pivotal moment in human history where the destruction of whatever the West is, is eminent.

14:17.317 --> 14:19.078
And it is intentional.

14:19.198 --> 14:20.039
It is designed.

14:20.099 --> 14:28.005
It is a controlled demolition that is taking advantage of an anticipated rise in all cause mortality to create a mythology.

14:29.966 --> 14:33.909
And it has put actors in place in order to curate that mythology.

14:33.969 --> 14:35.911
And some of those actors have

14:37.017 --> 14:40.421
interests in power or in fame or in fortune.

14:41.823 --> 14:54.217
Many of those actors are very unwittingly involved because they're not sophisticated enough to understand the web of lies that they've been brought up to understand and the web of lies that they are now employed to reinforce.

14:55.987 --> 15:01.271
But I assure you there is a very simple explanation for what happened during the pandemic.

15:01.771 --> 15:06.374
And it is only a spectacular commitment to lives that is required in order to sustain it.

15:07.034 --> 15:09.376
That is the main issue that we have here.

15:09.916 --> 15:13.359
Pure oxygen causes acute respiratory distress syndrome.

15:13.379 --> 15:22.465
So anyone that went to the hospital in 2020 or 2021 and was first given at the door, supplementary oxygen could have potentially

15:26.255 --> 15:35.350
develop the symptoms that were called COVID simply by that one treatment choice, fueled by a narrative of running out of

15:38.826 --> 15:59.195
ventilators or the stopping of spread with masks, or simple narrative that people like the FLCCC and Peter McCullough and Pierre Kory and Ryan Cole all perpetuated with this idea that we should use these pulse oximeters that you can get on Amazon to measure whether or not we have COVID.

15:59.215 --> 16:02.016
And if it goes down to 96 or so, you better go to the hospital.

16:05.356 --> 16:07.557
And so I don't think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:07.597 --> 16:14.461
is sophisticated enough to understand how thorough the Truman Show is that he is experiencing.

16:14.521 --> 16:17.722
How many of these people are on a script that he's unaware of?

16:18.723 --> 16:22.265
How many of these people are singing harmonious lies to him?

16:23.348 --> 16:35.379
so that he thinks he's just regurgitating what all these experts have told him and doing his best to try and rise to the destiny that whatever these people have convinced him his destiny is.

16:35.439 --> 16:38.281
But he does not understand the basic biology.

16:38.321 --> 16:41.404
And if he does, then that makes him a traitor.

16:43.424 --> 16:52.289
And we need to be honest with ourselves in 2025 on Easter, at this kind of the start of spring.

16:52.669 --> 16:59.673
We need to understand something here, that even if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:59.733 --> 17:04.836
is not a fake anti-vaxxer, the people that are behind him most certainly are.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.018
And it is their unblemished track record

17:10.191 --> 17:14.433
of making no progress for the last decades that makes it obvious.

17:17.055 --> 17:19.676
They have been put in place to control the public health narrative.

17:19.696 --> 17:21.297
They were put in place decades ago.

17:22.178 --> 17:29.862
And many of the ones that are currently in front of us right now are curiously former prominent Democrats, Hillary voters.

17:32.682 --> 17:46.209
even people that have gotten grant money from Democratic administrations or served in Democratic administrations for Democratic appointed heads of these agencies.

17:46.269 --> 17:59.316
We are talking about traitors and liars that are willing to do these things in order to be a part of the controlled demolition of America and to position themselves in positions of power and fame and fortune.

17:59.356 --> 18:00.016
At the end of it,

18:04.033 --> 18:09.717
Some of them were brought into small rooms and told that, you know, if you don't choose this, then someone else will.

18:09.737 --> 18:14.601
So they said, well, I might as well, at least I'll get a book out of it.

18:16.543 --> 18:27.431
I don't think any of them understood that there would be a guy like me that would figure it out and start insisting that people just tell the simple truth.

18:29.460 --> 18:46.054
I don't think any of these people anticipated that someone would see through the chorus of liars, the Lollapalooza of liars that these people have put together, put in place and financed for them to be out there for five and a half years, longer even.

18:47.932 --> 18:51.255
It's not a message that everyone is prepared to hear.

18:51.876 --> 18:55.139
But the truth is absolutely simple, ladies and gentlemen.

18:55.899 --> 18:58.782
You must participate in order to sustain it.

18:59.763 --> 19:05.068
Transfection and transformation in healthy people was always a crime.

19:05.828 --> 19:08.471
And lying about it makes it worse.

19:10.251 --> 19:11.432
RNA cannot pandemic.

19:11.472 --> 19:26.458
There's no biological basis for this principle, except for a few stories about special enzymes and special viral proteins that have not in any way, shape, or form been proven to support such a ridiculous idea.

19:27.819 --> 19:30.920
And finally, intramuscular injection is dumb.

19:31.480 --> 19:37.543
It's kind of a hard and abrasive statement that a lot of people don't like, but I assure you it is important to use it because

19:38.641 --> 19:42.886
It challenges anyone to try and refute it.

19:44.728 --> 19:51.335
And anyone that actually starts their gears turning will see that this is actually a pretty difficult statement to refute.

19:51.695 --> 19:53.317
And it's not so obvious.

19:56.192 --> 19:57.813
And that's how we win.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.914
We get out of their slave speak.

19:59.934 --> 20:04.377
We stop arguing about the effectiveness of vaccines or the danger of adjuvants.

20:05.058 --> 20:11.962
And we start arguing about the fact that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

20:13.240 --> 20:25.126
We start to argue about the fact that calling them investigational vaccines, as both sides did, as all sides did, was part of the illusion that they should have called them transfections and transformations.

20:25.966 --> 20:41.494
And anyone that can be demonstrated to have reasonably known that terminology before the pandemic is essentially a traitor if they have risen or become prominent in social media, not saying these words.

20:42.887 --> 20:44.128
Like Brian Hooker.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.189
And like Kevin McKernan.

20:46.509 --> 20:51.452
Two guys with over 20 years of genetic modification experience in plants.

20:53.132 --> 20:57.975
Both of them know that transformation and transfection is a way to express proteins in plants.

20:58.115 --> 21:00.676
Even a way to alter the genome of plants.

21:01.217 --> 21:02.157
Brian knows that.

21:02.177 --> 21:09.161
He had over 16 years of experience prior to 2013 in the modification of plants to produce medicines.

21:09.960 --> 21:21.022
Kevin McKernan is the foremost authority on the genomic analysis of marijuana and it's bending toward privatized, sorry, personalized medicine.

21:21.082 --> 21:21.922
Think about this.

21:22.803 --> 21:39.006
These two guys alone being prominent for five years and reinforcing all of the state narrative about COVID, the effectiveness of PCR, the neutralizing antibodies, the asymptomatic spread, the fact that the FDA is in the way.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.631
This is not a mistake.

21:43.192 --> 21:46.962
This is a single group of meddlers on a unified script.

21:48.450 --> 21:56.436
And that unified script is primarily designed to make sure that there is no useful resistance to the U.S.

21:56.496 --> 21:57.477
vaccine schedule.

21:57.597 --> 22:11.067
No useful awakening to the idea that the vaccine schedule in America in particular is obviously criminal when compared to any other vaccine schedule in the developed world.

22:11.607 --> 22:12.268
Full stop.

22:16.249 --> 22:27.602
If you can see that anybody in Australia, anybody in the UK, anybody in the Netherlands, anybody in Denmark, anybody in Norway that really wanted to wake America up,

22:28.413 --> 22:50.847
to the fact that we are being attacked internally by traitors, and it's been for decades, could simply say, wow, you know, America, you should compare your vaccine schedule to Norway, to the Netherlands, to Holland, to Denmark, to anywhere in the developed world, and you will find a weird contradiction.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.250
Because America's kids aren't the healthiest.

22:55.390 --> 22:57.411
America's kids are not the smartest.

22:59.218 --> 23:01.559
America's health outcomes are not the best.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.561
And our vaccine schedule is incredibly different.

23:08.523 --> 23:17.168
And that simple fact, that simple biology that underlies these theaters can be learned.

23:17.248 --> 23:20.530
And it can be learned by everyone because it's relatively simple.

23:21.370 --> 23:24.532
Because it's relatively, it's close to common sense.

23:26.516 --> 23:27.937
Because it is for all the marbles.

23:28.037 --> 23:29.498
It is for the grandchildren of Earth.

23:29.538 --> 23:34.001
That is the exact reason why there's an American fake vaccine movement.

23:34.922 --> 23:38.264
A fake anti-vaccine movement that has gone international.

23:39.409 --> 23:59.853
a fake anti-vaccine movement that has its roots in the original fake anti-vaccine movement of Polly, Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield in the late 90s in the UK, including 90 billboards in a bra trying to get awareness of autism, but not stop it or prevent it or cure it.

24:01.534 --> 24:07.155
Just establish that it's real and that we should have more education about it.

24:09.505 --> 24:11.286
and that autism can sway voters.

24:12.327 --> 24:16.889
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is available because they haven't made progress.

24:17.289 --> 24:35.619
If Pauly Tommy was on billboards in 1999 and 2000, trying to draw awareness to autism, but not in any way trying to stop another child from suffering from this debilitating condition.

24:37.523 --> 24:39.323
You can see what's going on.

24:39.363 --> 24:41.544
She got to meet the prime minister.

24:42.484 --> 24:44.144
There is no progress there.

24:44.164 --> 24:59.668
There's 20 years of profiteering and fame and magazine pictures and book tours and movie tours.

25:00.970 --> 25:11.120
This is a fake anti-vaccine movement and you can see it if you go back to 2013 when Brian Hooker, his son was hurt and he wouldn't use the word autism.

25:13.382 --> 25:19.789
And that same guy now is part of the fake anti-vaccine movement because in 2020 he said everything he was told to say.

25:21.144 --> 25:24.247
And in 2021, he said everything he's told to say.

25:24.287 --> 25:30.793
In 2022, he said everything he was told to say, presumably because, I guess, he knew that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:30.833 --> 25:37.419
was gonna be running for president, and it was just a matter of time before they got their guy in position, and then they would score all the touchdowns.

25:38.786 --> 25:41.648
So let's just make a big top tent of health freedom right now.

25:41.748 --> 25:51.715
You start using the word autism, not like in 2013 when you knew what you were talking about, 16 years of molecular biology experience, modifying plants to make medicines.

25:51.795 --> 25:57.259
No, let's just make a big top tent of health freedom, because we don't really want to save any kids.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.821
We just want safe vaccines.

26:00.202 --> 26:02.063
And we want Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:02.103 --> 26:06.266
in the White House to give us those fake vaccines, safe vaccines, right?

26:07.086 --> 26:07.567
Right, Brian?

26:09.528 --> 26:14.775
That's why we're here in 2025 with Brian Hooker still thinking that he's solving something.

26:15.095 --> 26:18.079
With Polly Tommy still pretending like she's fighting something.

26:18.099 --> 26:25.949
With Mary Holland still pretending like she's fighting something by taking a quarter million dollar salary every year and actually doing nothing.

26:29.454 --> 26:38.521
Contrast that to Brandy Vaughn, who went from being a skeptic in 2015 to being able to succinctly compare injection versus ingestion.

26:38.541 --> 26:47.769
A mom with an unvaccinated child didn't need to be convinced by her child being injured temporarily associated with an injection.

26:50.010 --> 26:53.774
She got convinced because she saw her son was healthy.

26:54.608 --> 27:01.091
and felt guilty about it and then was being mandated to give herself, her son, something that she didn't think she needed.

27:01.571 --> 27:08.314
And then she discovered the autism thing, the vaccine thing, the lies.

27:09.034 --> 27:15.837
And then she met Brian Hooker and Polly Tommy and Suzanne Humphreys and all these people who completely ignored

27:16.297 --> 27:25.766
her very advanced understanding of this mythology and her very advanced ability to describe the contradictions in this mythology.

27:25.826 --> 27:39.638
Instead, Brandy Vaughn died on December 7th, 2020, and these people are still getting paid more than $200,000 a year to not say there's a big difference between injection and ingestion.

27:42.659 --> 27:44.801
That's what a fake anti-vaccine movement does.

27:45.241 --> 27:50.946
Brian Hooker would not say the term autism in 2013.

27:51.867 --> 27:54.910
I think because he understood that autism was bullshit in 2013.

27:55.130 --> 28:06.700
That's why in February, 2003, there are girls and boys about autism on the front of Newsweek.

28:07.677 --> 28:12.983
Yeah, 10 years before Brian Hooker would not say it's autism anymore.

28:14.004 --> 28:15.105
I don't use the word.

28:15.626 --> 28:22.954
Autism was on the front of Newsweek 10 years before Brian Hooker said, I won't use the word autism because it's not.

28:23.474 --> 28:26.357
It's a neurological injury due to vaccines.

28:28.720 --> 28:29.601
Can you see it yet?

28:30.945 --> 28:37.588
The illusion of autism, the mythology of autism has been in construction for decades.

28:38.508 --> 28:52.555
And it has been in construction in parallel with a fake anti-vaccine movement that was going to prevent a useful progression to understanding what, for example, Brandy Vaughn tried to teach us in 2016, 17, 18, 19, and 20 before she died.

28:52.575 --> 28:53.375
An employee of Merck

28:58.988 --> 29:00.549
You know who else works for Merck?

29:00.889 --> 29:02.789
You know who else made a lot of money with Merck?

29:03.170 --> 29:08.031
Paul Offit made a lot of money with Merck because his rotavirus vaccine is produced by Merck.

29:08.432 --> 29:10.272
You know who else made a lot of money with Merck?

29:10.612 --> 29:13.813
Robert Malone brokered a Ebola vaccine to Merck.

29:14.194 --> 29:23.977
I mean, we are talking about some weird red threads that run through all these people that are protecting the childhood vaccine schedule, which is incidentally dominated by Merck.

29:24.698 --> 29:25.378
Stop lying!

29:29.352 --> 29:51.509
So this guy with an injured son in 2013 named Brian Hooker won't use the word autism, but in 2020, not only will he use the word autism, but he'll tell you that it kind of might've coincided with giving vaccines when my kid was sick, which is now actually what Suzanne Humphreys is saying five and a half years later on the Joe Rogan podcast and on the CHD podcast that she's on now.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.593
That's zero progress.

29:55.354 --> 29:56.435
That's no progress.

29:56.875 --> 30:01.799
Since 2013, Brian has made no progress in saving anybody.

30:02.700 --> 30:02.940
None.

30:03.781 --> 30:04.962
No messaging change.

30:06.463 --> 30:10.907
Didn't learn a damn thing from his friendship with Brandy Vaughn, even though he made two movies with her.

30:14.488 --> 30:28.697
And instead in 2020, at the end of 2020, you can find podcasts where he is just reinforcing the narrative that Tony Fauci gave him, that Kevin McKernan gave him, that Robert Malone gave him, that Mary Holland insisted that he read.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.898
Asymptomatic spread my ass.

30:32.359 --> 30:34.340
Neutralizing antibodies my ass.

30:37.882 --> 30:40.764
Underpowered vaccine studies, Brian?

30:44.059 --> 30:47.820
And this guy hired me a couple years later and pretended not to know it then, too.

30:47.860 --> 30:49.520
What's transfection again, Jay?

30:53.041 --> 31:06.005
So the fake anti-vaccine movement is populated by a bunch of people, not just CHD and ICANN and people that pretend to be against one or more of the shots or want to retest them or think about placebo or even, you know, the adjuvants.

31:07.341 --> 31:21.713
It's also populated by fake health freedom people that are totally Novacs, like this guy right here, Tom Cowan, who had a book in 2018 called Vaccines, Autoimmunity, and the Changing Nature of Childhood Illness.

31:22.234 --> 31:24.856
Let me make one thing absolutely clear.

31:25.577 --> 31:31.542
If these people believe that the vaccine schedule is poisoning roughly 9,000 kids a day,

31:36.741 --> 31:38.342
They're not doing a whole hell of a lot.

31:40.664 --> 32:01.402
If they've known since before 2018 that vaccines were poisoning thousands of kids a day, damaging thousands of kids a day, that we are under some kind of apocalyptic, sort of genocidal, you know, it's, it's, they're, they're, they're, it's, they're killing us.

32:02.623 --> 32:04.004
They're poisoning children.

32:06.038 --> 32:07.319
then it should be an all in.

32:08.179 --> 32:09.580
It should be a full court press.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.582
It should be a no holds barred, no punches pulled kind of thing.

32:14.022 --> 32:23.207
But for 25 years, it has slowly evolved from autism awareness to maybe it's the MMR.

32:23.267 --> 32:25.308
Maybe we should do separate MMRs.

32:25.809 --> 32:27.289
Maybe it's the adjuvants.

32:27.349 --> 32:30.211
Is it aluminum or thimerosal or mercury?

32:30.271 --> 32:31.932
Or which form of mercury is it?

32:33.157 --> 32:36.881
And these same assholes have been arguing with each other for more than 20 years.

32:36.962 --> 32:49.917
Mary Holland, Paul Offit, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Measles, MMR, Wakefield, and Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance have publication on measles together.

32:53.450 --> 33:11.284
It's all one fake anti-vax movement that opposes medical mandates, that advocates for free speech and free choice, wants safe vaccines, and never actually gets to the heart of the matter, which is the biological truth that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.328
And we're supposed to believe that despite all of these people having books,

33:16.573 --> 33:24.578
and multiple books sometimes, they still haven't managed to distill it down to the absolute truths.

33:25.638 --> 33:41.688
They haven't been able to succinctly explain how the immune system and your body is organized, how the microbiome is organized, so that we can understand why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system would be dumb.

33:42.910 --> 33:59.118
Instead, they have focused on meaningless arguments and hamster wheels that have extended this to five years of nonsense while there was almost three full years of murder where they could have said something, where they could have, you know, I don't know, lost a job at a medical school?

34:00.519 --> 34:00.799
Nope.

34:01.319 --> 34:02.820
Lost a job at a hospital?

34:03.757 --> 34:04.117
Nope.

34:04.758 --> 34:09.583
Oh, just sold books, started businesses, gone on world tours.

34:10.544 --> 34:17.431
None of these people can claim to have actually acted like somebody should act if they believe what they say they believe.

34:20.529 --> 34:30.721
If you really think that the childhood vaccine schedule needs to be ended, then it's not a 10 year plan to get somebody in the White House and then do it.

34:31.201 --> 34:32.423
That's traitorous.

34:33.003 --> 34:34.245
That is cowardly.

34:34.665 --> 34:35.667
That is weak.

34:40.831 --> 34:41.891
And that's where they are.

34:41.991 --> 34:45.332
That's what this is about because it's much bigger than that.

34:45.873 --> 34:50.994
It can't possibly be just getting Bobby Kennedy in the White House, Brian Hooker.

34:52.415 --> 35:01.698
It can't possibly be just getting Bobby Kennedy in the White House with Kevin McKernan, with Robert Malone, with Meryl Nass.

35:02.657 --> 35:12.361
with Claire Craig, with Jessica Rose, with Peter McCullough, with Pierre Corey, with Ryan Cole.

35:12.902 --> 35:31.870
These people's five-year track record reveal a theater, and it must be a theater coordinated by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, because these are the only two people with the requisite experience, connections, and past mentors that lead them right to being these guys.

35:34.551 --> 35:51.819
that are getting ready to take advantage of a once in a multi-generational timeframe where there will be enough people to sample, enough variation to sample, enough data collection to be had and the infrastructure in place to collect that data once in a millennium.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.442
There will never be 10 billion people on the planet using cell phones again.

35:56.482 --> 36:00.804
There will never be 10 billion people on the planets using cell phones again.

36:00.844 --> 36:01.444
That's the truth.

36:03.374 --> 36:10.917
never be 10 billion people on the planet that would be available for a implant at birth.

36:13.618 --> 36:17.419
Never will there be this many experimental animals available again.

36:20.660 --> 36:30.264
And so they have to collect the data because their story that they've been telling each other for the last 100 years or so is that at some point there will be a computer and then they can do it.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.439
They can become gods themselves.

36:33.479 --> 36:37.846
They can learn to take control of the evolution of the species.

36:37.926 --> 36:47.701
And that is why an actor like Anthrax, Meryl Ness, or Merc Ebola, Ditra, David Hone,

36:48.587 --> 37:11.197
Robert Malone would be involved, or Miss Five Post-Secondary Degrees would be involved, or 100,000 Genomes Project would be involved, or the Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, or a Solvay colleague of this guy, or some MIT professor who's supposedly really speaking out about glyphosate.

37:13.858 --> 37:14.518
And autism.

37:14.799 --> 37:17.860
Don't forget, she's also spoken out about autism, thinks it's glyphosate.

37:21.843 --> 37:30.130
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but these people have been put in place, and the American populace is being spellbound by them.

37:30.210 --> 37:44.723
Whether or not you believe them, and you're fighting with them, and you're donating money to these people, or you think that all of these people are nuts, you have been fooled by design.

37:46.536 --> 37:56.202
It is imperative that everybody in America, regardless of what hat you think you're wearing and what team you think is winning, that you understand that both teams are losing.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.043
Both teams are traps.

37:58.584 --> 38:00.725
Both sides of this narrative is nonsense.

38:00.765 --> 38:05.088
And the gears don't mesh because you're on both sides of the line.

38:06.059 --> 38:13.185
Everybody believes some things on both sides of the line, but imagines that they're really predominantly red or blue.

38:13.706 --> 38:15.888
And this was all done on purpose.

38:16.148 --> 38:26.677
And much of the confusion, the frustration, the contradiction that people are holding in their heads is about this shit, about this nonsense, about these lies.

38:28.922 --> 38:31.648
And so if you want to see it, you need to acknowledge it right now.

38:31.869 --> 38:33.512
You need to acknowledge it right now.

38:44.073 --> 39:03.305
need to acknowledge it right now ladies and gentlemen this work is only supported by viewers like you the book that's going to come out is only going to be free and so if you want to think about this stream as just being kind of a placeholder right now for all the other work that i'm doing i've never read more in my life and i have a

39:05.529 --> 39:10.636
I have such an extreme focus on where I'm going right now that it's hard to do a stream like this.

39:10.756 --> 39:12.779
And so I apologize that I'm not on more.

39:12.839 --> 39:14.341
I know that that's for a lot of people.

39:14.401 --> 39:19.729
It's nice to just have a show there to watch because there isn't much on the internet anymore.

39:20.973 --> 39:34.096
But I think it's now become imperative that I finish this Biology 101 story at a high school level, at a high school teacher level, and get this PDF done and out, even if it's never going to be published, even if it's only just for free.

39:34.676 --> 39:45.978
And then we can start going forward with Biology 101 in a way where these big ideas won't necessarily be able to be obfuscated, able to be diluted, or able to be lost.

39:46.018 --> 39:48.158
And we can really just pass this on to our kids.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.559
I'm really confident that we're going to be able to do it.

39:51.079 --> 39:55.544
But the only way they're going to be able to do it is because of all the people that support this stream.

39:55.604 --> 40:01.290
And so for every one of you that has given $10 or $5 or even $2, I can't thank you enough for your belief to click.

40:06.118 --> 40:24.191
we do need more support but i'm also getting a couple day jobs now to make sure that this it's just got to be done and if if streaming every day isn't going to get people to you know subscribe for whatever reason i don't i don't i don't i don't subscribe to anyone either so it's

40:26.437 --> 40:27.438
The book's got to be written.

40:27.738 --> 40:29.419
The new biology's got to come out.

40:29.920 --> 40:37.186
And if you want it to come out right, you've got to understand that these people are on stage together.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.607
We can't change their script.

40:38.687 --> 40:52.178
And so if we drop this ball and allow them to obfuscate and to distort the ideas that we're trying to put out, they could still win.

40:53.669 --> 40:57.292
And so I think it's got to be available so that when it's ready, it's ready.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.154
And when people want it, they can have it.

40:59.214 --> 41:03.017
And it doesn't have to be something where, again, they have to look for the stream or look for the clip.

41:03.758 --> 41:05.940
It's got to be something that people can download and hold.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.501
And that's where I'm going.

41:09.743 --> 41:12.565
So I want to explain something here while my voice is still with me.

41:13.426 --> 41:20.032
The team worst case scenario is actually many separate teams that have been revealed in plain sight

41:21.855 --> 41:27.499
And it is an illusion of consensus that they create by working together, by getting each other's back.

41:27.719 --> 41:40.607
And when we were talking about Brian Hooker last week or the week before, Brian Hooker was on a stream at the end of 2020 where he was doing a, what I would call a callback exercise with someone by the name of Dr. Kendra.

41:41.627 --> 41:45.970
And basically they were asking each other questions that they already knew were coming.

41:46.900 --> 41:57.542
in a kind of act to make it seem like that they were having a consensus agreement about certain basic principles of the COVID pandemic.

41:57.602 --> 42:03.924
And so, you know, one Brian Hooker might say, what do you, Dr. Kendra, what do you know about asymptomatic transmission?

42:04.344 --> 42:12.445
And then Dr. Kendra would answer that question with a Fauci-like answer and then throw it back to Brian and say, what do you know about B cells, Brian?

42:12.465 --> 42:14.126
Isn't that B cells or T cells?

42:14.146 --> 42:15.466
And then Brian would say something.

42:16.624 --> 42:26.991
And so the illusion that the internet allows to be created is a group of people can go on Zoom and agree on something.

42:27.051 --> 42:28.692
And that's an illusion of consensus.

42:28.752 --> 42:33.155
It's like being in a room with four people and those four people talking about

42:33.855 --> 42:35.977
I don't know, a car that's in the garage.

42:35.997 --> 42:46.147
And if you're not a mechanic, or you're not familiar with what cars in the garage, you kind of just have to listen along and try to understand what they're talking about as they talk with each other.

42:46.187 --> 42:55.556
And what that can do is convince you that there's a certain car in the garage with a certain set of wheels and a certain amount of modifications and maybe a problem and a certain leak.

42:56.741 --> 43:06.471
And when you open the door, there might not be any car at all in the garage, but it's the agreement between the three people that were standing outside of the garage and their vivid explanation.

43:06.491 --> 43:08.132
And they're correcting each other.

43:08.192 --> 43:08.693
No, no, no.

43:09.073 --> 43:10.975
It wasn't the left cylinder that leaked.

43:10.995 --> 43:14.939
It was the right cylinder that leaked, but it's the, it's the C joint in the left side.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.309
Oh yeah, that's right, sorry.

43:17.729 --> 43:23.472
And so they have all these details and all this amazing understanding about the car that's in the garage.

43:23.812 --> 43:39.419
And it turns out there isn't a car in the garage at all, but it's their convincing banter, their limited spectrum of debate and their knowledge of the details, their confirmation of these details with one another that creates the illusion of consensus.

43:39.459 --> 43:45.522
And I'm about to show you something that I found on BitChute that will absolutely positively blow your mind.

43:46.621 --> 43:50.383
Now, I don't know if the, I put it in the chat there.

43:50.463 --> 44:02.571
I don't know if this video was originally released on April, April in 2022, but it was posted on BitChute in April of 2022.

44:02.871 --> 44:04.472
And so I'm just going to it now.

44:05.633 --> 44:16.020
And again, I want to remind you that this is a video with Tom Cowan and Tom Cowan has a book in 2018 by Chelsea Green Publishing, which is,

44:17.409 --> 44:20.411
I don't know if they're good guys or not, but they publish a lot of this stuff.

44:21.332 --> 44:24.695
Vaccines, autoimmunity, and the changing nature of childhood illness.

44:24.735 --> 44:41.068
Supposedly, he understands that vaccines are poison in 2018, that thousands of children are being poisoned, that thousands of pregnant women are being poisoned, that thousands and thousands of elderly people are being poisoned every day.

44:42.205 --> 44:44.006
So much so that he wrote a book about it in 2018.

44:44.507 --> 44:56.976
And now in 2022, after two full years of murder in America, this is what Tom Cowan and his colleagues have to say.

44:56.996 --> 44:58.737
Hello everyone, and welcome to Street M.D.

44:58.797 --> 45:04.822
versus the other doctors, including doctors Tom Cowan, Andrew Kaufman, and Dr. Mark Bailey.

45:05.382 --> 45:10.446
Now, Dr. Bailey, word has it that Samantha had some more important things to attend to.

45:11.229 --> 45:12.190
Yeah, sorry about that, Joe.

45:12.710 --> 45:16.732
We were hoping to both attend today, and we're delighted.

45:16.812 --> 45:22.696
But it's school holidays here, so we've got the whole team at home, including our eight-month baby.

45:23.276 --> 45:27.338
So one of us had to stay upstairs and keep an eye on the troops.

45:27.438 --> 45:35.243
But yeah, I'm not quite as pretty as Sam, but hopefully I can do an equal job on dismantling the virology for you.

45:35.945 --> 45:36.886
I'm totally fine with it.

45:37.026 --> 45:38.466
It's just the viewers aren't iconic, man.

45:38.486 --> 45:40.707
These guys are wild when it comes to their science.

45:40.747 --> 45:42.748
So I'm sure they'll be understanding as well.

45:42.788 --> 45:44.549
But right now, there's a war on science.

45:45.350 --> 45:48.951
And one of the things that I feel like is, I'm actually at the Hard Rock Hotel in Mexico.

45:49.472 --> 45:52.513
And I saw a sign, a little artwork by John Lennon.

45:53.133 --> 45:55.955
And it said, the more I see, the less I know for sure.

45:56.675 --> 45:57.756
And that's how I feel right now.

45:58.456 --> 46:13.072
To start off, may I just play you a little segment from Great scientists around the world have concluded via control studies that not only COVID-19 but viruses in general have never been isolated following a correct and proper scientific method and have never been proven to be contagious.

46:13.793 --> 46:14.714
Can you please speak on this?

46:15.785 --> 46:17.086
I disagree strongly.

46:17.106 --> 46:20.890
The virology here is well established.

46:21.110 --> 46:26.395
Okay, so let's just make sure you understand what you see here because it hasn't been seen very often.

46:26.975 --> 46:28.437
This is Ryan Cole.

46:28.457 --> 46:30.699
150,000 tests in my office, Ryan Cole.

46:34.505 --> 46:52.812
This is the spike protein of the viruses causing cardiac problems and collaborator with Jessica Rose in 2021, Peter McCullough, also the chief medical officer of the Wellness Company.

46:54.482 --> 47:02.605
who Robert Malone told me was a bad guy at the inaugural CHD conference in 2022, and that the wellness company was bad guys.

47:02.645 --> 47:14.048
But here they are all on the same podcast together, talking about Andrew Kaufman's idea of that there are no viruses.

47:14.228 --> 47:14.969
So weird.

47:16.550 --> 47:18.512
We have observed the agent.

47:18.672 --> 47:20.914
We have cultivated the agent.

47:21.435 --> 47:25.519
We have used the agent in infectious animal models.

47:25.979 --> 47:29.723
I'm not sure where this discussion thread comes from.

47:30.403 --> 47:31.544
Viruses are real.

47:32.545 --> 47:34.366
They can be easily demonstrated.

47:34.426 --> 47:36.726
They can be cultivated in the laboratory.

47:36.806 --> 47:37.867
They can be stored.

47:38.307 --> 47:39.547
They can be passaged.

47:40.027 --> 47:42.568
They meet all the criteria of Koch's postulates.

47:42.948 --> 47:50.291
There is the issue that it's difficult to reproduce the human disease in various animal models.

47:50.871 --> 47:55.832
And so sometimes that's considered to fail to meet Koch's postulates.

47:56.473 --> 48:00.034
But in my experience and that of many, many colleagues,

48:00.774 --> 48:03.135
This is a isolated virus.

48:03.875 --> 48:07.437
It can be reproduced in the laboratory to high titers.

48:07.517 --> 48:12.319
It can be purified, and it can be used to infect cells and animals.

48:12.979 --> 48:18.081
That response got a lot of people really pissed off, and they demanded that Drs.

48:18.141 --> 48:22.823
Cowan, Kaufman, and even Samantha Bailey come on, which we're happy to have you, Mark.

48:23.243 --> 48:28.785
So are we really to believe that a panel composed of Robert Malone,

48:29.787 --> 48:55.673
and Ryan Cole who had toured the United States Christian churches presenting Li Ming Yan as a whistleblower, that that's a spontaneous assembly with Peter McCullough, the guy who has been collaborating with Jessica Rose on cardiology and, and hydroxychloroquine and hearts or something like that.

48:56.749 --> 49:02.933
that those people requested these people in particular come and explain the opposite.

49:05.735 --> 49:18.785
And you, we are supposed to believe that it's between these two teams, that these two groups of people are the primary, like sort of potential saviors of our society.

49:19.746 --> 49:25.450
Going to save us from the globalists, going to save us from Bill Gates and, and Peter Daszak.

49:26.306 --> 49:36.529
Remember, these are supposed to be three doctors who have known for years that the medical system in America is corrupt.

49:37.269 --> 49:40.330
That the medical system in America is corrupt.

49:41.211 --> 49:45.832
So much so that Tom Cowan had a book in 2018 about the vaccine schedule.

49:46.272 --> 49:49.133
And yet, how will he open this?

49:50.374 --> 49:54.195
Will he talk about the two years of murder that have occurred?

49:55.157 --> 49:57.538
And how that two years of murder happened?

49:58.658 --> 50:00.218
Will he talk about it at all?

50:00.238 --> 50:07.360
Or will he only talk about isolation, purification, and culturing of viruses?

50:08.200 --> 50:15.402
And never once get to, well, if vaccines are poison, what should we do about it, Tom?

50:17.423 --> 50:20.383
And that's how you can see he's a liar and a traitor.

50:23.786 --> 50:27.670
So, Dr. Cowan, I'm sure you have a lot to say about that response.

50:28.070 --> 50:37.919
I have a drawer in my kitchen, and it has a bunch of silverware, and it has a corkscrew, and a knife, and a spoon, and a bunch of other things.

50:37.999 --> 50:44.225
And it has one cork top in it, the kind you put on olive oil and other things.

50:45.701 --> 50:55.344
If anybody who's actually thinking about this would say, can you isolate the cork top from... Does this sound like a guy who's had a book since 2018?

50:55.404 --> 50:57.424
That's five years.

50:58.605 --> 51:01.946
A book that supposedly says the vaccine schedule is poison.

51:03.606 --> 51:13.369
If the vaccine schedule is poisoning thousands of kids a day, don't you think he should start a little better than with a analogy about a utensil drawer?

51:16.468 --> 51:26.930
Don't you think that by now, after two years of speaking out about something, he would have a message better than an analogy about a utility drawer.

51:28.550 --> 51:29.291
Holy shit.

51:29.371 --> 51:32.651
Can you imagine him saying, well, the vaccine schedule is fake.

51:34.292 --> 51:46.094
And so they are murdering people and lying about it in order to make sure that our kids and most parents never wake up to the fact that what I've known already for many years is the vaccines are just poison.

51:47.366 --> 51:58.407
Can you imagine the difference between that and what this jackass has been saying for five years straight on almost every podcast he's ever done?

52:00.680 --> 52:06.523
the drawer and find out what it's made of, what is composed of, and what it does.

52:07.543 --> 52:21.631
Every single human being would say, okay, they would go in the drawer, they would take only the cork top out, and then they would do analysis of the chemistry and find out what it does.

52:22.231 --> 52:26.393
There's simply no explanation for how stupid this is other than he is a traitor.

52:27.705 --> 52:40.953
There's no way that someone can have an MD and a practice and patience and write a book like this and then talk this much stupid shit in 2022.

52:41.713 --> 52:42.654
There's no way.

52:46.676 --> 52:53.600
This is a fake anti-vaxxer, a traitor, a traitor to all American children.

52:55.612 --> 52:59.013
If I ever see this guy in person, I'll have a hard time not knocking him out.

53:00.734 --> 53:06.817
By everybody's definition who speaks English, that is the definition of isolation.

53:07.897 --> 53:11.099
And that has never been done for any virus.

53:11.759 --> 53:12.439
These are three

53:16.496 --> 53:26.221
These are three MDs who are unable, three MDs who are unable after years of being skeptical.

53:26.722 --> 53:28.342
Mark Bailey was so skeptical.

53:28.382 --> 53:30.964
He apparently stopped practicing medicine.

53:36.327 --> 53:40.429
So skeptical that he writes something called farewell to virology.

53:42.315 --> 54:00.660
But nowhere in there do these three MDs ever get around to saying, you know what, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb because there are no viral diseases, because viruses are fake, because they've never, do you see?

54:02.320 --> 54:04.601
Do you see why the logical,

54:06.031 --> 54:07.892
Action is not being taken.

54:07.972 --> 54:17.177
If you believe that vaccines are poison and that every child that is injected and is not obviously damaged got lucky, then this is not the tact.

54:19.038 --> 54:21.259
Joining the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.821
campaign for president and selling hats is not the tact.

54:26.442 --> 54:31.145
Building a big top tent of health freedom is not the tact toward winning.

54:34.568 --> 54:35.229
It's just not.

54:36.050 --> 54:37.712
It is throwing away your career.

54:38.173 --> 54:47.545
It is speaking out as clearly as possible, and it is saying it as succinctly as possible, as often as possible, until the vaccine schedule in America is ended.

54:50.290 --> 54:53.492
And they are not doing that by design.

54:53.913 --> 55:06.722
These people are the people that they are arguing with by design because they were put in place to protect the very vaccine schedule that I am trying to explain to you is criminal.

55:07.742 --> 55:18.110
And it is criminal because it is biologically ridiculous to think that we can augment a healthy human with intramuscular injection of any combination of substances.

55:19.380 --> 55:21.141
How many different ways can we say it?

55:21.161 --> 55:32.224
Or measles or chicken pox or something.

55:32.844 --> 55:35.665
They minimally filter it or centrifuge it.

55:36.397 --> 55:43.222
They immediately then mix it with a culture which has other particles and genetic material.

55:43.402 --> 55:52.529
Another way to think about it is, do you think it's more important to convince people that virology has a lot of weird, silly experiments or a lot of weird, direct

55:53.169 --> 55:56.871
and indirect observations or a lot of misinterpreted observations.

55:57.311 --> 56:06.436
Do you think it's more important to explain that to people or would it be more important to explain to people why the fundamental idea of intramuscular injection of medicine is dumb?

56:07.336 --> 56:10.558
As an MD or an MD or an MD.

56:12.539 --> 56:20.883
But instead, these MDs with patients are focused on virology terms, virology semantics,

56:23.226 --> 56:40.673
and perhaps misinterpreted biological observations or misconstrued or exaggerated biological observations without ever getting to the conclusion that vaccines are then a lie, a criminal enterprise, and we should just stop it all.

56:44.874 --> 56:48.756
In COVID case, they mix it with green monkey kidney cells.

56:49.704 --> 56:57.172
Then they put antibiotics, which are specifically toxic to the kidney, meaning amphotericin and genomicin.

56:57.847 --> 56:59.708
Then they withdraw the nutrients.

57:00.249 --> 57:08.515
They add fetal calf serum, also a source of identical particles and genetic material.

57:08.976 --> 57:10.557
And then they see what happens.

57:10.777 --> 57:16.982
And what happens is the monkey kidney tissue breaks down into thousands of little particles.

57:17.622 --> 57:21.265
And they say that is the isolation of the virus.

57:21.545 --> 57:24.246
Now, unfortunately, he's not totally correct.

57:24.286 --> 57:28.267
And this is another reason why he is an obvious liar.

57:28.887 --> 57:39.711
Because the other major way that RNA virology is done is by the manufacturing of a pure DNA clone of the said sequence that they found.

57:40.411 --> 57:42.752
And now I'm not suggesting that this is virology.

57:42.792 --> 57:50.514
However, I am suggesting that his limited explanation of how virology is done is by design.

57:52.458 --> 58:06.943
Because if he really wanted to arm you with the truth, he would explain to you that the vast majority of virology isn't even done by isolating a sample and then growing it on culture with antibiotics.

58:07.003 --> 58:17.886
They don't need to do any of that shit if they start with an infectious clone, a large pure quantity of DNA, and pretend that that's an equivalent to virology.

58:18.928 --> 58:27.635
And that is a fundamental lie that I tried to explain to these people in this year of 2022, when I finally started to figure it out.

58:28.676 --> 58:41.025
And then these people attacked me, all five together in one video, and tried to debunk the infectious clone idea without ever really talking about it.

58:41.766 --> 58:47.911
Just saying that, unfortunately, Jonathan Cooey didn't provide any papers, so I guess he's full of shit.

58:49.605 --> 58:59.314
This same guy, who apparently in 2018 knew it was bad enough to write a book about it, is just simply unable to explain it.

59:00.495 --> 59:01.336
It's by design.

59:01.856 --> 59:02.557
He's a traitor.

59:04.759 --> 59:05.519
He's a criminal.

59:05.940 --> 59:06.600
He's an actor.

59:06.620 --> 59:07.181
He's awful.

59:07.201 --> 59:15.889
That is the only way they have isolated viruses, and that is a English language and scientific fraud, period.

59:16.587 --> 59:23.230
because we now know that the brain... And the consequences of that are that the vaccine schedule is criminal.

59:23.790 --> 59:27.112
Why doesn't Tom Cowan ever say that?

59:30.353 --> 59:31.114
It's that simple.

59:31.154 --> 59:36.836
He could stop right there and say that and then say, that's why I wrote the book in 2018.

59:39.468 --> 59:44.812
The reason why Tom doesn't say that is not because he's just kind of dumb.

59:45.193 --> 59:46.814
It's because he's on a script.

59:49.416 --> 59:51.718
He's part of a fake anti-vax movement.

59:52.939 --> 59:54.740
He's no different than Mary Holland.

59:57.062 --> 59:58.924
Breakdown of the tissue happens.

59:59.502 --> 01:00:14.170
With nothing from the COVID patient or the measles patient or the chicken pox added, it's simply a result of starving and poisoning kidney cells and then showing that they break down.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.652
We have proof from Ender's paper.

01:00:17.148 --> 01:00:20.612
We have proof from Stefan Lanke's work, et cetera.

01:00:21.273 --> 01:00:30.102
Now, the next thing they do is they show you pictures of these articles and they say, see, that's SARS-CoV-2 or measles, et cetera.

01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:35.007
We know still hasn't saved a single kid from the vaccine schedule.

01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:38.812
Still hasn't really convinced anybody of anything, I don't think.

01:00:40.353 --> 01:00:51.003
that you cannot tell in an electron microscope whether that's just the breakdown particles from kidney cells or some so-called exogenous virus.

01:00:51.243 --> 01:01:03.635
In other words, all these particles that they're claiming are isolated viruses are just the breakdown of the kidney tissue or the fetal calf serum or whatever tissue they're growing it on.

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:14.523
And then finally, it couldn't be that they figured out that the end protein actually causes the packaging of RNA and the formation of exosomes.

01:01:14.563 --> 01:01:31.694
For example, it couldn't possibly be that it couldn't possibly be that there's some endogenous mechanism of genetic packet information that could be hijacked or misconstrued as something that it wasn't in an electron micrograph.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:42.156
It's just gotta be breakdown because, of course, the next part of their narrative is that there are no diseases that are caused by viruses.

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:47.299
That's just impossible.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:54.404
Unless you mean by the Vincent Rack and Yellow and Tony Fauci viruses, then that's fine.

01:01:55.714 --> 01:02:00.982
And that's the misconstrued and obfuscated truth that these people are employed to hide.

01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:02.584
They sequence this.

01:02:03.606 --> 01:02:07.872
Actually, they don't sequence it because they never have a genome to start with.

01:02:08.479 --> 01:02:12.062
And if you don't have a genome to start with, you can't sequence it.

01:02:12.623 --> 01:02:18.127
So they do what's called alignment, which is cutting all these little pieces together up.

01:02:19.008 --> 01:02:30.959
And they have no idea whether the pieces come from a so-called virus, or from the kidney tissue, or fetal cath serum, or something else in the snot of the person.

01:02:31.966 --> 01:02:44.097
Oh, and don't want to mention, you know, bacteria and bacteriophages, even though these two entities are almost immeasurably complex and, and, and immeasurably loud in the background.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:45.318
He just didn't mention them.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.521
Other stuff in the snot?

01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:52.344
You mean like bacteria and bacteriophages?

01:02:53.926 --> 01:02:57.169
You see, those are two things that these people never disagree exist.

01:02:59.053 --> 01:03:02.434
and bacteriophages are bacterial viruses.

01:03:02.494 --> 01:03:07.935
They are the most abundant packet information around.

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:24.859
The biological packet information that we are surrounded by, that some people have called or named viruses, this, actually, by far, the most abundant of that packet information are all kinds of different shaped bacteriophages, many of which are spheres.

01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:34.130
Not the little moon lander shaped phages that they show you from the Hershey experiments and the Delbruck experiment.

01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:35.332
No, no.

01:03:37.574 --> 01:03:38.475
Most of them are round.

01:03:40.537 --> 01:03:44.882
Indistinguishable under an electron microscope from any of these other so-called particles.

01:03:46.733 --> 01:03:50.374
Not that wrong in that sense, what Tom Collins says.

01:03:50.454 --> 01:04:13.438
But the point is that if he's known for five years that the vaccine schedule is criminal, then why not at some point very early in your interview, tell everybody that that's why or the consequences of there being no viruses or no diseases caused by viruses is that the vaccine schedule is therefore criminal.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.602
They can't get there because they are part of the script.

01:04:21.563 --> 01:04:22.884
And they piece it together.

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:32.112
They, in their mind, mentally come up with a sequence, which they then erroneously call the genome of the virus.

01:04:32.732 --> 01:04:44.723
Every time they do it, they get a different result, which is- Actually not, because every time they do it, after they find the sequence, they usually start with the same sequence again, because they just make a clone of it.

01:04:45.737 --> 01:04:55.282
That's the reason why there is a SARS Urbani strain that everybody starts with when they wanna study SARS in a culture or SARS in an animal model.

01:04:55.702 --> 01:05:07.948
They just request the pure DNA construct from UNC and the Barrick Laboratory and they get it sent and then they put that on a cell culture and the cell culture likely just packages it up.

01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:13.391
And now you can transfect anything you need to transfect with that DNA.

01:05:14.395 --> 01:05:15.776
and call it virology.

01:05:16.237 --> 01:05:27.145
And these people could have explained that to you in 2022, could have explained it to everyone in 2020, even I presume, because they probably knew it before I did, but they didn't.

01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:33.650
And once I started talking about it, these people went bananas and they still haven't said it.

01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:37.713
It makes them traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:52.642
why there's approximately, Andy might know this more than I, 5 million or 400,000 or 2 million different sequences because every time you do the experiment, you get a different sequence.

01:05:52.863 --> 01:06:06.606
So anybody who says that's proper isolation simply has not familiarized themselves with either what they do or with the English language.

01:06:07.355 --> 01:06:09.157
Now good doctors before anyone.

01:06:09.337 --> 01:06:13.422
He's got no problems with the English language when it comes to vaccines though.

01:06:14.523 --> 01:06:15.605
That's a normal term.

01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:19.629
He's got no problem with the English language when it comes to viruses.

01:06:22.192 --> 01:06:23.574
He just says they don't exist.

01:06:26.055 --> 01:06:26.795
Can you see it yet?

01:06:26.955 --> 01:06:33.018
That the limited spectrum of debate is pretending that he's really, he's really semantically specific.

01:06:33.058 --> 01:06:39.201
You know, he only uses the words with the right definitions and he is really insistent on it.

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:44.791
Gosh, this guy's a fraud.

01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:46.012
It is just awful.

01:06:46.432 --> 01:06:53.357
Let me play you the other clip to it, because the clip that you guys saw probably was on Rumble, I believe, but I don't think you guys saw this part.

01:06:53.858 --> 01:06:56.200
I can tell you clinically, it's different than the flu.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.743
People making this argument says, well, it's just misdiagnosis of influenza.

01:07:01.323 --> 01:07:03.565
I think it's a very different clinical syndrome.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:10.070
A misdiagnosis of influenza is actually something that a couple other people in the George Webb arena were doing.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:18.728
and made a killing on, including getting on Bret Weinstein to talk about it, arguing with Robert Malone about it in 2023.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.933
Cullen and Goodman, complete jokes.

01:07:24.455 --> 01:07:29.481
This is so damning to have these three people in a Brady Bunch shot.

01:07:30.973 --> 01:07:32.095
It's just ridiculous.

01:07:32.776 --> 01:07:44.172
It's an absolute admission that this narrative is being curated, that this script is being provided by people with 20 years of ties to all of these people.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:53.496
This guy worked with Rick Bright and spoke and then handed off the mic to Rick Bright in front of the Who in 2011.

01:07:53.556 --> 01:07:56.777
There is no way that Robert Malone is a good guy.

01:07:56.858 --> 01:08:02.801
And there, by association, there is no way that this guy or that guy are good guys anymore.

01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:03.941
It's just impossible.

01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:06.763
They have not made any progress in five years.

01:08:07.243 --> 01:08:12.046
They have stuck to the narrative that never contradicted the guy from DITRA.

01:08:13.243 --> 01:08:16.605
David Hone's best friend, who is supposedly vetted for U.S.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:36.798
Amarid where Sina Bavari works, and has been on multiple Tommy podcasts with Stephen Hatfield, the first suspect in the Anthrax letters, and the guy who was in Rhodesia for Ebola around the same time that Meryl Nass was in Rhodesia for Ebola, way back when.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.539
Stop lying!

01:08:43.903 --> 01:08:45.744
and CT patterns are distinct.

01:08:46.364 --> 01:08:52.525
The thrombotic aspect of the illness, the laboratory pattern, it's distinct from influenza.

01:08:52.926 --> 01:08:54.866
SARS-CoV-2 is a real virus.

01:08:55.226 --> 01:09:03.468
I don't know if you guys are familiar with Dr. Tom Cowan, Stefan Lanka, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, but these are three medical doctors that are talking about this kind of stuff.

01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:08.630
And they argue, why can't we isolate the virus through a density gradient centrifuge?

01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:13.254
versus the way they're doing it now, because they're putting all this other stuff in there, allowing it to decay.

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:17.557
And I think Stefan Lanka was able to... So it's a legitimate discussion.

01:09:17.597 --> 01:09:21.120
There are legitimate questions to be asked about why can't we do it this way?

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.181
Why don't we do it that way?

01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:24.763
Is it a direct measurement or an indirect measurement?

01:09:24.823 --> 01:09:26.244
Is the indirect measurement enough?

01:09:26.685 --> 01:09:32.730
And so now we're going to hear a pretty reasonable counter from the illustrious Robert Malone.

01:09:34.099 --> 01:09:37.122
isolates something that looks like COVID with yeast.

01:09:37.763 --> 01:09:40.385
So that's a big thing that people have been talking about.

01:09:40.545 --> 01:09:47.412
If they're producing something that has virus-like characteristics from yeast, it's likely to be a budded form or an exosome.

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:49.234
Oh, an exosome!

01:09:49.815 --> 01:09:51.136
Stop lying!

01:09:51.476 --> 01:09:55.701
Wow, it's weird that they were free to use that word, but don't use it anymore.

01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:57.863
What's an exosome, Robert Malone, I wonder?

01:09:59.272 --> 01:10:04.555
In terms of density gradient, you need a lot of virus to pull a density gradient.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:15.341
And the way that's typically done is you culture the virus for a long period of time, often in roller bottles, collect very small volumes of fluid.

01:10:16.121 --> 01:10:27.708
You may pass it through a filtration system to further concentrate the virus, and then put it on your gradient, whether it's a step gradient or a continuous gradient, and pull the band.

01:10:28.268 --> 01:10:30.388
That requires a heck of a lot of virus.

01:10:30.449 --> 01:10:35.770
That is absolutely not how you isolate a primary variant sample.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:44.492
The reason why you have to do it in the presence of the drugs is because you have the problem of contamination with mycoplasma, bacteria, etc.

01:10:44.872 --> 01:10:46.432
from primary clinical samples.

01:10:46.932 --> 01:10:50.513
And so you have to impose stringent criteria

01:10:51.053 --> 01:10:57.818
that will keep those things from overgrowing the cell layer while you're trying to grow out the virus and passage it.

01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:01.821
I don't wish to cast shade on my fellow colleagues.

01:11:02.441 --> 01:11:04.303
I don't know what their background is.

01:11:05.423 --> 01:11:08.786
So he doesn't want to cast shade on his former colleagues.

01:11:08.826 --> 01:11:10.667
He doesn't know what their background is.

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:12.529
Stop lying.

01:11:12.909 --> 01:11:14.050
I'm going to say it right here.

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.911
I think that's an absolute lie.

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:19.794
And the reason why is because I think they are actually on Robert Malone's script.

01:11:20.936 --> 01:11:31.585
I think it is most likely that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are the two people that have curated the script that all of these populist Bannonites are on.

01:11:33.306 --> 01:11:50.500
The script that Meryl Nass has been holding Children's Health Defense on, the script that Del Bigtree has been holding, the script that Wakefield has been running, was adopted and then modernized by Kevin McKernan and

01:11:51.815 --> 01:12:11.486
Robert Malone before the pandemic and deployed in very similar fashion to how it was deployed in the early 2000s when Polly Tommy was on 90 billboards in her bra, saving no one, just getting 6 million votes for the right prime minister candidate.

01:12:13.527 --> 01:12:16.709
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, these people probably wanted

01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:18.624
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:18.664 --> 01:12:21.366
in the White House and have settled for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:21.406 --> 01:12:24.108
being in the Trump administration, but they are still there.

01:12:25.089 --> 01:12:27.331
They are still ultimately behind this.

01:12:29.132 --> 01:12:33.155
And that means that we are still being sabotaged from inside.

01:12:33.775 --> 01:12:38.479
We are still being misled by a coordinated Lollapalooza of liars.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.961
And at the heart of it is Robert Malone.

01:12:44.124 --> 01:12:49.385
But these are classic virology isolation methods and techniques.

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.906
There's nothing idiosyncratic here.

01:12:53.626 --> 01:13:00.648
And to isolate a virus by density gradient, you're basically, you would require somebody to be incredible.

01:13:01.608 --> 01:13:08.270
Somebody says that the video is not there.

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:09.450
So I'm going to give you this one.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:12.831
This is the one on Rumble, Jeffrey.

01:13:14.005 --> 01:13:17.127
And then the Rumble video says that it's this one.

01:13:17.428 --> 01:13:20.550
So I copy, and the Rumble video says it's this link.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:23.232
So if that link doesn't work, let me see.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:25.354
I open that link, and I get a video.

01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:25.934
So let's see.

01:13:25.974 --> 01:13:28.496
Maybe I dropped the wrong link in there, but that's the right one now.

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:28.896
Let me see.

01:13:30.347 --> 01:13:30.627
I don't know.

01:13:30.687 --> 01:13:31.728
Anyway, I'm gonna let it go again.

01:13:32.928 --> 01:13:34.049
My voice is starting to die.

01:13:34.069 --> 01:13:35.309
I don't know why.

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:39.091
Just shedding very, very large amounts of virus.

01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:43.113
And you would have to have a body fluid that has that large amount of virus.

01:13:43.733 --> 01:13:45.554
And even then, I don't think it'd be possible.

01:13:45.914 --> 01:13:47.815
You would have loved to be in my seat at that moment.

01:13:52.503 --> 01:13:56.467
Dr. Kaufman, how would you have responded to what Dr. Malone said at that point?

01:13:57.848 --> 01:14:10.281
And to isolate a virus by density gradient, you're basically, you would require somebody to be incredibly virulent, just shedding very, very large amounts of virus.

01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:16.422
And so again, reinforcing the whole cartoon mythology of what a virus does, right?

01:14:16.462 --> 01:14:24.203
It makes lots of copies of itself and it goes through this lysogenic phase where it destroys cells and then all these particles spray everywhere.

01:14:24.704 --> 01:14:38.546
This is a cartoon that is borrowed from bacteriophages that likely has absolutely no basis in reality for whatever respiratory diseases they are trying to explain.

01:14:39.662 --> 01:14:51.827
And yet without even hesitation, he recites this ridiculous cartoon and then, you know, seeds the narrative of shedding of lots of viral particles, depending on how sick you are.

01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:55.749
And you would have to have a body fluid that has that large amount of virus.

01:14:56.369 --> 01:14:58.190
And even then, I don't think it'd be possible.

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:06.153
With Ryan Cole nodding and laughing his head as if that skin biopsy guy knows anything about this.

01:15:07.659 --> 01:15:09.540
You would have loved to be in my seat at that moment.

01:15:09.981 --> 01:15:13.963
Dr. Kaufman, how would you have responded to what Dr. Malone said at that point?

01:15:14.523 --> 01:15:27.812
Well, let me start off by saying that, you know, creating the appearance of a scary, deadly virus is a major tool in the toolbook of the, you know, globalist empire, like the people.

01:15:28.032 --> 01:15:31.373
And why not just say that Robert Malone works for that empire?

01:15:31.433 --> 01:15:40.075
Why not just say that Robert Malone has been involved with these people who are perpetuating this illusion for decades?

01:15:40.195 --> 01:15:41.695
Why not say that?

01:15:43.895 --> 01:15:46.356
And the reason why is because they're on the same team.

01:15:49.597 --> 01:15:56.358
The same reason why Robert Malone said very conspicuously, I don't know who these guys are or who's their background.

01:15:57.657 --> 01:16:01.563
Hmm, funny, I've never seen these guys before.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:11.196
Not since the last time we were sitting across the table from each other and shared a briefing lunch or a Zoom meeting before this started.

01:16:11.397 --> 01:16:13.740
People behind the World Economic Forum and

01:16:14.598 --> 01:16:16.820
agenda 2030 and other things like that.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.441
So they want to make sure.

01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:22.324
So wait, Robert Malone has been presenting in front of the who.

01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:32.831
Why not point that out instead of immediately evoking all of these ghosts and all of these amorphous entities that we could possibly never oppose?

01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:39.396
Why not just say that that actual asshole is the one we should be fighting?

01:16:41.049 --> 01:16:42.129
Because he works with him.

01:16:42.829 --> 01:16:43.330
That's why.

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:56.553
That's why there's a picture of this man, Andy Kaufman, shaking hands with Andrew Cuomo in 2019, accepting a grant to make a biometric monitoring system for prisons.

01:16:57.053 --> 01:16:58.313
Yes, this guy.

01:16:59.554 --> 01:17:00.154
That's why.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:02.854
Because they are on the same team.

01:17:03.315 --> 01:17:04.535
Otherwise you would dunk.

01:17:05.697 --> 01:17:07.758
He would say that the vaccine schedule is criminal.

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:08.698
These people have known it.

01:17:08.738 --> 01:17:09.798
We've known it for a while.

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:17.341
And they put somebody like Robert Malone out there specifically to make sure that nobody would usefully question this.

01:17:18.741 --> 01:17:21.002
But he doesn't say it at all.

01:17:22.663 --> 01:17:29.185
He's not worried about America being sabotaged or there being traitors on the internet that are lying about this.

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:39.075
He's going to have a very calm discussion despite the fact that there's two years of murder in his home state of New York.

01:17:41.639 --> 01:17:42.761
Or is he from Vermont?

01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:57.894
that even the people who maybe think it was been exaggerated or that they're concerned with health freedom, that they never spread this truth that there are no disease-causing viruses.

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:03.617
If there are no disease-causing viruses, then that makes the vaccine schedule pretty shitty criminal, doesn't it?

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.075
That makes the vaccine schedule one mega lie.

01:18:08.555 --> 01:18:15.998
That makes the vaccine schedule some pretty terrifying shit for thousands of parents a day, doesn't it, Andy Kaufman?

01:18:16.378 --> 01:18:24.601
And yet your dumb ass, your traitorous ass cannot say it for five years.

01:18:27.923 --> 01:18:33.625
This isn't the Easter stream that I would want to do if there was something to celebrate, but there isn't.

01:18:37.819 --> 01:18:46.885
We need our children to understand that the adults in this world are lost.

01:18:48.106 --> 01:18:55.251
They are lost because of skilled social media use and because they get ganged up on in social media.

01:18:55.872 --> 01:19:04.518
By acquiescing to social media, you submit yourself to conversations with four liars or three coordinated liars and a dupe.

01:19:06.052 --> 01:19:09.273
And what that results in is not good processing.

01:19:10.574 --> 01:19:13.495
You can't listen to three liars and then learn something.

01:19:15.176 --> 01:19:18.117
You can only listen to three liars and become trapped by them.

01:19:20.678 --> 01:19:22.059
And it's a hard truth.

01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:25.400
It's not for everyone, but it is for anyone that wants to see it.

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.182
That is how they intend to govern our children.

01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:32.403
That is how they intend to enslave them.

01:19:34.224 --> 01:19:40.967
because then they won't be able to run this program again with the next scary pandemic situation.

01:19:41.487 --> 01:19:48.330
They will be able to run this until the vaccine schedule is ended, Andy Kaufman.

01:19:50.011 --> 01:19:54.012
Nobody needs to understand the subtleties of virology.

01:19:55.093 --> 01:20:03.276
They only need to understand synthetic recombinant DNA can be made in quantity, and they only need to understand that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:20:03.905 --> 01:20:11.587
And then you can explain to them why it is obvious that the vaccine schedule, the vaccine idea is wrong.

01:20:12.048 --> 01:20:15.869
But no, Tom Cowan actually writes a book about vaccines.

01:20:16.849 --> 01:20:22.371
He doesn't explain that vaccines are dumb, why the word itself is stupid to use.

01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:31.634
Vaccine is one of the primary beautiful words in slave speak, just like autism is.

01:20:33.303 --> 01:20:40.726
Once you argue about what autism is and where it comes from, you are enslaved by Brian Hooker's lies.

01:20:41.647 --> 01:20:44.128
You are enslaved by Mary Holland's lies.

01:20:44.168 --> 01:20:46.869
You are enslaved by Pauly Tommy's lies.

01:20:46.889 --> 01:20:48.910
Autism is a lie.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:21:05.485
It's another thing that these guys could probably say if they wanted to, but they don't want to because they work for Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and this malevolent force that is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:06.426 --> 01:21:08.146
and the Health Freedom Movement.

01:21:15.615 --> 01:21:17.156
But also, like, it's important.

01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:34.804
So none of these responses really, either they responded with something that was just simply not true, like that the virus has been purified, that Dr. Malone said, that's simply not true, or they divert away from the actual subject.

01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:39.306
And part of that is because you didn't really ask a well-constructed question.

01:21:39.326 --> 01:21:42.888
Isn't it important that Robert Malone has a history

01:21:44.269 --> 01:21:51.975
Isn't it important that Robert Malone is not just the inventor of mRNA who retired to a horse farm in Northern Virginia?

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:56.879
Isn't it important to understand who it is that he's arguing with?

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:04.185
Are we really to believe that Robert Malone doesn't know Andy Kaufman and doesn't know what their background is?

01:22:05.302 --> 01:22:14.486
And Andy Kaufman doesn't know who Robert Malone is in 2022 when he spoke out already in 2021 on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:26.572
Are we really to believe that that is considered irrelevant to these guys that they could discredit him with his history?

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:37.810
They could discredit him with his 20 year history of working for the system that these people claim they've known for years is bullshit.

01:22:38.931 --> 01:22:39.652
But do they do it?

01:22:43.055 --> 01:22:45.778
No, it is because they are on his team.

01:22:48.139 --> 01:22:52.422
On his script like you didn't really know what dr. Lanka did in his experiment.

01:22:52.442 --> 01:23:15.819
So you described something that they didn't understand correctly like what he did is he ran the virus isolation experiment without a virus and Produced cytopathic effects, which is the proof of the virus's presence in the body fluid so how can you get the same result if there's no virus if the virus is the cause of the result that the result is the proof of a virus and

01:23:16.519 --> 01:23:27.166
So, you know, the question would be, hey, by those standard isolation procedures that you described, can you explain how that proves there's a virus in the person?

01:23:27.847 --> 01:23:33.370
Well, do these guys seem like they're trying to fight against something as nasty as a lie?

01:23:33.471 --> 01:23:35.372
Like, you know, vaccines are a lie.

01:23:36.453 --> 01:23:41.456
The whole medical foundation of medicine in America is just a scam.

01:23:41.476 --> 01:23:45.359
Do they really feel that important, that desperate?

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.989
Or do these guys feel like pretty comfortable on their script?

01:23:49.409 --> 01:23:52.671
A lot more like people just, you know, reading the lines they were given.

01:23:52.891 --> 01:23:54.012
I think that's what I see.

01:23:55.132 --> 01:23:58.694
Or can you address why they don't do control experiments?

01:23:59.114 --> 01:24:02.996
Isn't a control experiment a necessary part of a scientific experiment?

01:24:03.876 --> 01:24:05.517
Here's the real bullshit.

01:24:05.637 --> 01:24:09.319
He can't even tell you what that control experiment would need to rule out.

01:24:10.231 --> 01:24:13.233
And what would it need to rule out in the new Biology 101?

01:24:13.953 --> 01:24:27.980
A source of the signal that was not bacteria or bacteriophage, the two broadest, largest sources of noise in the world of microgenetic signals.

01:24:29.161 --> 01:24:34.444
If you want to talk about packet information, DNA and RNA packaged,

01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:39.855
and released as a general phenomenon that definitely exists in nature.

01:24:40.315 --> 01:24:49.763
By far and away, the biggest fraction of this observation is bacteriophages and bacteria.

01:24:51.984 --> 01:24:53.826
And so it would be pretty important for this

01:24:55.236 --> 01:25:02.403
person, if he was really serious about this fight, to explain that the background is hot.

01:25:02.984 --> 01:25:04.925
And why is the background hot?

01:25:05.026 --> 01:25:14.094
Because so much of those signals, so such a large proportion of those genetic packet signals are actually just bacteriophages.

01:25:16.657 --> 01:25:19.600
And he's not going to say that at all, not even close.

01:25:21.141 --> 01:25:24.583
But then he just, the answers kind of led.

01:25:24.943 --> 01:25:28.466
So first of all, the leading answer was, of course.

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:39.653
No control, he just says control experiments should be done, but he gives you no examples which would belie an understanding of what's happening here.

01:25:40.113 --> 01:25:41.134
It's just a script.

01:25:41.754 --> 01:25:42.895
That's well-established.

01:25:43.075 --> 01:25:45.137
Yes, I believe there are viruses.

01:25:45.617 --> 01:25:47.058
I believe this virus is real.

01:25:47.658 --> 01:25:50.380
Now that doesn't mean anything scientifically.

01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:51.281
Right?

01:25:51.321 --> 01:25:55.144
Because we can point to people who think they're real and people who don't think they're real.

01:25:55.324 --> 01:25:57.947
Why would they be lying, Andy Kaufman?

01:26:00.148 --> 01:26:01.990
Why would they say those things?

01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.451
Just because they're dumb?

01:26:04.152 --> 01:26:05.573
Just because they don't get it?

01:26:06.863 --> 01:26:09.786
Or is it because the vaccine schedule in America is criminal?

01:26:10.347 --> 01:26:17.093
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:26:17.113 --> 01:26:22.198
But they would like to convert our children to experimental animals, and so they're lying about it.

01:26:22.619 --> 01:26:29.666
They're even willing to murder people in hospitals using supplementary oxygen or withholding antibiotics for viral diseases.

01:26:31.317 --> 01:26:33.398
in order to accomplish that goal.

01:26:33.698 --> 01:26:36.899
And they put somebody like Robert Malone dead center to do it.

01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:40.901
But this guy can't say that because he's working for them.

01:26:42.721 --> 01:26:44.822
Well, it's meaningless.

01:26:44.902 --> 01:26:49.584
It's giving away your opinion to someone else or just saying, this is my opinion.

01:26:49.624 --> 01:26:52.085
I just stated outright, but I have nothing to back it up.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:55.298
Now with Dr. McCullough, he gave clinical evidence.

01:26:55.939 --> 01:27:05.136
So he said he thinks people have a different pattern of disease with the flu this year compared to other years, or whatever you want to call it, a respiratory acute syndrome.

01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:24.029
But this is a psychiatrist who doesn't seem to understand that a two year campaign on social media to convince people that there was something new with the combination of bad protocols and hospitals could easily convince people that there was something new.

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:31.170
A psychiatrist is not going to come to the

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:42.147
conclusion that a large portion of this might just be a sort of induced assumption, right?

01:27:42.628 --> 01:27:45.170
He can't get there because that would be crazy, right?

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:47.832
A psychologist, a psychiatrist would never know that.

01:27:47.992 --> 01:27:49.474
And that doesn't mean anything.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:51.135
It doesn't tell you what causing it.

01:27:51.215 --> 01:27:53.697
So let's say he did notice something different clinically.

01:27:54.618 --> 01:27:56.580
How do you know that's not a different flu virus?

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.623
If you believe in flu viruses, how do you know it's not a,

01:28:00.203 --> 01:28:06.248
a different toxin, maybe a new food trend, maybe a new plastic used in... A new plastic in the environment?

01:28:06.428 --> 01:28:08.650
A new food trend in the environment?

01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:17.157
Again, a guy who doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between the acute exposure to a toxin injected versus ingested or inhaled.

01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:26.325
These people are as bad as Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:28:27.031 --> 01:28:31.192
because they are on a script given to them by them.

01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:38.154
Consumer goods, you know, there's no way to know what causes it by observing what you see clinically.

01:28:38.954 --> 01:28:42.795
So that's not, you know, an argument that you can speak to this issue.

01:28:43.836 --> 01:28:55.039
Now, what Dr. Malone said there at the end about there's not enough material, you know, that you'd have to have someone with real large viral shedding.

01:28:55.814 --> 01:28:58.175
Well, that just kind of doesn't make sense.

01:28:58.475 --> 01:29:01.437
There's not enough material to show the thing is a real thing.

01:29:01.457 --> 01:29:03.318
You know, how could that not be?

01:29:03.398 --> 01:29:09.621
Like, if there's not enough in one person, couldn't you just get it from a group of people so that it's concentrated?

01:29:10.775 --> 01:29:14.680
And this thing about having to culture it, that also doesn't make sense.

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:30.638
But the problem is that even if there was a signal, Andy, you would be isolating it from an irreducible complex, irreducibly complex background of bacterial signals that include bacteriophages.

01:29:31.809 --> 01:29:42.393
And bacteriophages and bacteria provide an irreducible background of genetic signals from which they never attempt to differentiate.

01:29:46.054 --> 01:29:53.357
And the reason why he can't tell you this is because then there would be a lot of different explanations for contagious disease.

01:29:54.369 --> 01:30:02.335
There would be a lot of different explanations for what these people are lying about, and you might figure it out, that they are actually lying to you about bacteriophages.

01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:07.500
Bacteriophages are the most abundant signal in nature at that size scale.

01:30:08.921 --> 01:30:10.822
And they are pretending that they don't exist.

01:30:11.603 --> 01:30:18.909
They are pretending that they are not a confounding factor in the isolation of a coronavirus RNA, which they most certainly are the primary.

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:20.609
confounding factor.

01:30:20.649 --> 01:30:24.912
They are primarily and likely the source of the lie.

01:30:26.793 --> 01:30:44.605
And that is the reason why we have gut microbiome people involved in this since Andy Wakefield all the way up to Sabine Hazan talking about the bifidobacteria, but never once in all of the hours that she's spent on all of the podcasts she's ever been on has never mentioned bacteriophages.

01:30:45.405 --> 01:30:54.817
has never mentioned the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 signal, whatever it is, the spike protein, could be a signal that is being found in bacteriophages.

01:30:55.678 --> 01:30:58.241
And we make no effort to differentiate from that.

01:30:59.783 --> 01:31:00.864
He's not going to say it either.

01:31:01.365 --> 01:31:02.326
Neither is Tom Cowan.

01:31:03.746 --> 01:31:06.928
even though they all will acknowledge that bacteriophages are real.

01:31:07.248 --> 01:31:17.894
We know that because in a few months, Mark Bailey is going to go and argue on the Tim Truth podcast with none other than Kevin McCairn himself about viruses and virology.

01:31:18.695 --> 01:31:21.857
And there he will acknowledge that of course bacteriophages are real.

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:28.961
I never said that they weren't real, but there's not one disease on earth that's blamed on bacteriophages.

01:31:32.455 --> 01:31:36.197
And the only disease based on bacteria, I guess, is salmonella.

01:31:36.217 --> 01:31:41.939
Makes sense, because if there's not enough virus particles in a person... And anthrax, don't forget anthrax.

01:31:42.859 --> 01:31:44.160
How is it making them sick?

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.241
And TB, don't forget TB.

01:31:46.261 --> 01:31:48.061
And also, how could it spread to someone else?

01:31:48.161 --> 01:31:51.803
Because if it goes through some body excretion, it's gonna be diluted.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:57.189
So you have, if you have a very little to begin with, not even enough to purify.

01:31:57.329 --> 01:31:58.209
It's very simple.

01:31:58.269 --> 01:32:16.355
Ladies and gentlemen, these people are presenting to you a limited spectrum of debate using the old bad biology where bacteria and bacteriophages and all the things that they do as a part of our hyper symbiotic self is irrelevant.

01:32:17.295 --> 01:32:18.516
Don't need to think about that at all.

01:32:18.536 --> 01:32:21.717
We just need to answer the questions that Robert Malone posed.

01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:27.435
because he's on the Robert Malone script.

01:32:27.976 --> 01:32:30.560
It's sort of like, how are you going to have enough to spread the illness?

01:32:31.519 --> 01:32:34.281
or how are you good enough to spread throughout your lungs?

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:58.279
Well, actually, you can make a bunch using pharmaceutical grade recombinant DNA manufacturing techniques that are used as standard production of biologics, which is the reason why anybody that's worked in pharmaceuticals for any length of time would have known already that manufacturing a pure mRNA was bullshit, including Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:32:59.639 --> 01:33:02.382
Maybe even Jessica Rose, although I think she's kind of a stooge.

01:33:02.822 --> 01:33:03.503
To make you sick.

01:33:04.584 --> 01:33:06.906
Or all the other organs they say that it affects, right?

01:33:06.926 --> 01:33:11.390
They say it affects your olfactory, your sensory nerves, right?

01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:12.692
Your taste and smell.

01:33:13.513 --> 01:33:14.714
It can affect your kidneys.

01:33:14.734 --> 01:33:16.495
It can affect your blood system.

01:33:16.555 --> 01:33:20.099
How's it going to spread and cause all that damage if there's not even enough of it?

01:33:20.714 --> 01:33:25.039
to like show under an electron microscope, which shows things that are nanometers.

01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.042
Show under electron microscope.

01:33:27.082 --> 01:33:30.566
These guys, that other guy just got through telling us that those pictures are dumb.

01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:38.916
The contradictions that they do amongst the team is even part, it's even built into the script.

01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:40.771
It's that way on purpose.

01:33:40.851 --> 01:33:41.531
In size.

01:33:42.412 --> 01:33:43.932
It just doesn't really add up.

01:33:44.033 --> 01:33:50.816
Like the reason they use the isolation procedure that they use now is because they couldn't actually show these things are real.

01:33:52.437 --> 01:33:53.498
So they had to fudge it.

01:33:53.698 --> 01:33:54.599
And then it just caught.

01:33:54.759 --> 01:33:56.240
It's so funny, right?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.541
Why would they do this?

01:33:58.621 --> 01:33:59.802
Is it just for money?

01:34:01.623 --> 01:34:02.743
Why would they do it?

01:34:02.823 --> 01:34:05.285
Why would they be committing these murder and lies?

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.282
And why aren't they talking about the murder?

01:34:08.562 --> 01:34:11.224
They're just talking about the lies and then only a few of them.

01:34:12.125 --> 01:34:16.289
And then they're not trying to explain to you why in the world would all these people do it?

01:34:17.329 --> 01:34:20.352
Is it not significant that it's not just some random doctor?

01:34:20.752 --> 01:34:21.853
It's Robert Malone.

01:34:23.375 --> 01:34:26.037
Andrew Kaufman doesn't give a shit because he's getting paid by them.

01:34:29.889 --> 01:34:33.491
caught on because it was convenient and it made tons of money and it made.

01:34:33.691 --> 01:34:49.178
Don't forget that a year ago or so in 2024, right after, sorry, right before or right after I gave my red pill presentation in 2024, Andrew Kaufman did the Steve Kirsch podcast.

01:34:49.638 --> 01:34:55.641
Steve Kirsch is the guy who went on Brett Weinstein's podcast in June of 2021 with Robert Malone.

01:34:58.439 --> 01:35:05.125
Steve Kirsch is one of the largest private donors to the Democratic National Committee before the pandemic.

01:35:06.306 --> 01:35:14.973
Yes, this guy went on his podcast last year, right after I presented the Red Pill Expo, where I said, these people are all lying.

01:35:20.086 --> 01:35:21.287
in people's careers.

01:35:22.047 --> 01:35:27.431
And these guys, none of, they asked about the credentials, but none of them are virologists either.

01:35:27.491 --> 01:35:32.155
You know, Dr. Malone, he contributed to inventing this vaccine technology.

01:35:32.535 --> 01:35:35.577
That's pretty much what's being used to.

01:35:35.857 --> 01:35:37.378
A vaccine technology.

01:35:37.518 --> 01:35:42.102
Also a guy who doesn't seem to be able to say transfection because he's on Robert Malone's script.

01:35:43.543 --> 01:35:44.624
And he's giving credit.

01:35:44.664 --> 01:35:46.685
I guess he did invent the vaccine.

01:35:46.745 --> 01:35:47.626
That's pretty cool.

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:58.287
It's really obvious and it should be really obvious that this guy is not attacking Robert Malone at all.

01:35:58.407 --> 01:36:00.609
No, he's promoting him.

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:04.092
Harm and kill people right now.

01:36:04.812 --> 01:36:06.494
So, you know, you have to think about that.

01:36:06.534 --> 01:36:11.318
I don't know if that was his intention, but that's how the technology is being used at present.

01:36:11.598 --> 01:36:11.919
How?

01:36:12.499 --> 01:36:12.799
Why?

01:36:12.899 --> 01:36:15.682
How is the technology being used to kill and harm people?

01:36:15.762 --> 01:36:16.683
Why would they do that?

01:36:19.608 --> 01:36:21.069
Why isn't everybody dying then?

01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:39.014
They're not gonna suggest placebo, of course, because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is so dumb that they would never actually get away with it without placebo.

01:36:40.695 --> 01:36:42.896
Can I just add something here?

01:36:42.996 --> 01:36:46.217
The question to ask here is, so,

01:36:47.486 --> 01:36:50.629
So if you're saying you have to culture the virus.

01:36:50.849 --> 01:36:59.457
No, the question you have to ask him is why is intramuscular injection of a lipid nanoparticle coded RNA a good idea?

01:37:00.118 --> 01:37:04.402
How does that usefully augment a healthy human, whether elderly or a kid?

01:37:08.902 --> 01:37:21.439
But that's not at all what this guy who supposedly knows that the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise, a fake fraud and injuring thousands of kids a day.

01:37:24.343 --> 01:37:25.124
This is what he says.

01:37:27.236 --> 01:37:38.280
And you go into viral theory, which is you have this so-called particle that goes and uses your lungs as a culture, right?

01:37:38.961 --> 01:37:39.881
That's what they say.

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.562
Why isn't your lungs a culture?

01:37:43.762 --> 01:37:49.905
Why do you have to culture it in a Petri dish or a roller tube, right?

01:37:51.064 --> 01:37:54.267
And the answer is there's no sense in that at all.

01:37:54.907 --> 01:38:00.212
We, according to conventional viral theory, are a culture medium.

01:38:01.213 --> 01:38:02.373
That's the whole point.

01:38:03.194 --> 01:38:07.898
And nobody asks him, well, if you want to culture it, why isn't your lung the culture?

01:38:08.539 --> 01:38:12.102
Now, the other thing I thought of, and maybe Mark or Andy can help me with this,

01:38:13.044 --> 01:38:20.535
I don't know how much virus you would need to see or need to have in order to see a band.

01:38:21.496 --> 01:38:26.783
But let's say it's the droplets of a tenth of a pinhead, right?

01:38:27.264 --> 01:38:28.005
That's a guess.

01:38:28.834 --> 01:38:30.375
but it's a small amount.

01:38:31.096 --> 01:38:38.443
Now they tell us that viruses do their damage by mechanical disruption of the cells, right?

01:38:38.523 --> 01:38:40.845
It's not like arsenic where it's chemical.

01:38:41.766 --> 01:38:44.248
So let's say it was a pinhead.

01:38:44.488 --> 01:38:48.091
You could see a pinhead on an ultracentrifuge band.

01:38:49.232 --> 01:38:54.237
So there's the amount of virus that let's say is a pinhead.

01:38:55.512 --> 01:39:05.375
Now, if you just removed a pinhead... Does this really sound like a guy who has a big message, which is that we've got to stop injecting children for nothing?

01:39:06.735 --> 01:39:09.536
We've got to stop injecting children for nothing.

01:39:10.916 --> 01:39:13.717
It's damaging our children for nothing.

01:39:16.298 --> 01:39:18.959
Does this sound like a guy whose message is that?

01:39:19.818 --> 01:39:30.083
Or does this sound like a guy who's actually reading a script that will never get to the actual finish line, which would be public health is fake.

01:39:30.604 --> 01:39:32.244
The vaccine schedule is a lie.

01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:33.925
Viruses are a myth.

01:39:35.266 --> 01:39:36.227
Save your children.

01:39:39.008 --> 01:39:42.910
No utility drawer analogies would be necessary indeed.

01:39:44.909 --> 01:39:57.157
But for years and years and years, this fake person engaged in this limited spectrum of debate with pleasure, with a smile on his face, laughing about it.

01:39:57.277 --> 01:40:00.039
That amount of your lungs, you know what would happen?

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:01.460
Nothing.

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:04.042
Nothing.

01:40:05.122 --> 01:40:10.346
If you removed a baseball size amount of your lungs, you have a bad day and then you recover.

01:40:11.856 --> 01:40:27.904
There is no possible way that a particle that you cannot see in a band on an electron microscope that does its damage mechanically by bursting cells could possibly cause illness.

01:40:28.644 --> 01:40:29.565
It's nonsense.

01:40:29.805 --> 01:40:34.149
And that's where I think there's some confusion with around the different techniques that are used.

01:40:34.269 --> 01:40:40.415
Like the electron microscope can't tell you too much about the biological role of the particles.

01:40:40.555 --> 01:40:47.361
What can the electron microscope tell you about intramuscular injection relative to your understanding of human physiology, Mark Bailey?

01:40:48.081 --> 01:40:52.104
You were an MD before you quit because you didn't think that the system was right.

01:40:52.625 --> 01:41:02.052
So now that you've been reading on your own, what is your understanding of the human physiology that makes vaccines so dumb?

01:41:02.072 --> 01:41:06.036
I guess he doesn't have any opinion about that.

01:41:06.056 --> 01:41:08.297
He's just, you know, farewell to virology.

01:41:08.337 --> 01:41:09.638
Which is currently what they're doing.

01:41:10.099 --> 01:41:12.441
They're taking these pictures and saying, well, that's a virus.

01:41:13.191 --> 01:41:19.935
but there's no way from the... The consequences of this lie, Mark Bailey, are the vaccine schedule in the West.

01:41:20.915 --> 01:41:35.203
Every baby that gets injected in New Zealand is injected because you have failed to inform people that the consequences of what you say is bullshit is that vaccines are bullshit.

01:41:36.604 --> 01:41:40.326
That the idea of vaccination is bullshit.

01:41:42.244 --> 01:41:43.267
but they're not going to say it.

01:41:43.327 --> 01:41:46.837
They use the word vaccine repeatedly.

01:41:47.677 --> 01:41:56.182
because they are reinforcing the slave speak because they are employed and running the script of Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:41:56.302 --> 01:42:00.484
That they can demonstrate that that virus has a particular biological property.

01:42:01.025 --> 01:42:02.926
All they can do is talk about the morphology.

01:42:03.346 --> 01:42:09.049
Back in the day, with the purified particles, you would then perform your biological experiments.

01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:10.991
So then you try and infect something.

01:42:11.051 --> 01:42:12.732
But it was very, again, very specific.

01:42:12.912 --> 01:42:14.793
You had to have purified particles.

01:42:15.993 --> 01:42:23.116
So he's saying right here that there are examples where they have purified particles and then been able to show infection.

01:42:23.656 --> 01:42:24.957
He's saying it right here.

01:42:29.038 --> 01:42:33.040
A lot of those examples are bacteriophage, that's true, but there are examples.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:45.247
but with the cell culture, which contained all sorts of other material, antibiotics, et cetera, various cell line types, you had to have the absolute purified particles.

01:42:45.947 --> 01:42:48.509
And not only that, you had to perform control experiments.

01:42:48.749 --> 01:42:59.575
So you had to take a comparative control, go to another human or animal, take some samples, and show that you could not get the same results, that you couldn't get these same particles.

01:43:00.296 --> 01:43:03.378
And once they were purified, you wouldn't get the same biochemical

01:43:04.518 --> 01:43:06.620
results when you start doing the analysis.

01:43:07.661 --> 01:43:17.190
And at that point, once you've done all this, you try and infect a new animal or host and see if you can replicate the process all over again.

01:43:17.551 --> 01:43:23.176
But we all know that they're not even close to establishing these properties.

01:43:23.276 --> 01:43:27.660
So we can conclude that there is absolutely no evidence of SARS-CoV-2

01:43:28.641 --> 01:43:35.105
just as there is absolutely no evidence of any other pathogenic particles that behave like viruses.

01:43:35.585 --> 01:43:37.806
Dr. Kaufman, in hindsight, you're right.

01:43:38.206 --> 01:43:42.729
I should have asked certain questions differently, especially about the controlled group.

01:43:42.949 --> 01:43:45.170
Why wasn't there in any of these isolation processes?

01:43:45.551 --> 01:43:56.497
It is remarkable that now we have three MDs who have come to some conclusion that there are no viruses that cause contagious disease, but they are unable

01:43:57.659 --> 01:44:07.807
to then state that that makes the idea of vaccination dumb, especially intramuscular, they're unable to say it.

01:44:09.308 --> 01:44:22.579
And I think, without a doubt, I would put all my chips on the fact that this means that these people are traitorous saboteurs of what otherwise would have been a truth movement, would have otherwise been an anti-vaccine movement.

01:44:24.178 --> 01:44:32.983
These people are as bad as Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whether he's wittingly or unwittingly involved, that guy is part of this.

01:44:35.325 --> 01:44:48.753
Because by now, after this many years, and after having employed me for a year and a half, Brian Hooker can't say he doesn't know, Mary Holland can't say she doesn't know, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:48.793 --> 01:44:53.356
can't say he doesn't know that RNA cannot pandemic, that intramuscular injection is just plain dumb,

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:56.978
and that these were always transformation and transfections.

01:44:57.438 --> 01:45:07.904
And that's why everybody who knew those terms already, like Brian Hooker, like Merrill Nass, like Robert Malone, like Kevin McKernan, are traitors for not having used those terms in 2020 immediately.

01:45:12.188 --> 01:45:17.777
But do you guys generally think that these doctors have bad intentions though?

01:45:17.897 --> 01:45:26.611
Because I think that personally, when I look at the people in my neck of the woods, even my neighbors and some of my clients have been saying, wow,

01:45:27.612 --> 01:45:28.693
You're not crazy after all.

01:45:28.953 --> 01:45:31.055
I saw Robert Malone on Joe Rogan.

01:45:31.115 --> 01:45:36.138
So for those reasons, I actually think that these people have done some good for our movement.

01:45:36.919 --> 01:45:49.367
But I understand from your perspective that if the basis, the core basis of the argument is that this virus hasn't been isolated, so it doesn't exist, and these guys are perpetuating the lie here, I could see from your standpoint why that's not a good thing.

01:45:49.487 --> 01:45:55.972
But overall, if the endgame is for us to win, isn't it a good thing that they're waking up humanity?

01:45:57.193 --> 01:46:09.943
Well, Joe, you know, first of all, I don't think ill of anyone who is trying to talk about health, freedom, freedom in general, um, the ability to make your own choices about these things.

01:46:15.508 --> 01:46:16.909
Stop lying.

01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:18.571
Stop lying.

01:46:19.992 --> 01:46:21.393
Stop lying.

01:46:24.155 --> 01:46:24.996
There it is right there.

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:45.042
So even though thousands of children are being poisoned every day in America, and even though Tom Cowan has known it since at least the publication of his book apparently, since this guy's known it for like two and a half years he's been speaking out apparently,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.087
Up until this point, none of them have been able to succinctly explain why in the world would anybody lie about murder?

01:46:54.487 --> 01:47:00.033
Why in the world would anybody lie about intramuscular injection being called a vaccine?

01:47:05.157 --> 01:47:10.062
Gosh, I hope it's as obvious to you as it is to me that these people are so malevolently involved.

01:47:10.082 --> 01:47:19.833
And of course, you know, it's also very positive when people are telling at least some of the truths about the... So Robert Malone is telling some of the truth.

01:47:22.355 --> 01:47:25.519
Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole are telling some of the truth.

01:47:28.413 --> 01:47:40.083
And so it's a limited spectrum of debate being curated by one team, worst case scenario with little separate sub teams that Kevin McCarron agrees that this is the worst guy in the internet.

01:47:40.424 --> 01:47:47.109
Kevin McCarron makes memes about his wife, but then he's going to go on a stream with him and talk to him.

01:47:48.150 --> 01:47:53.375
Even though a guy made memes about his wife with hot dogs in her mouth,

01:47:56.178 --> 01:48:06.823
he went on a stream with him to discuss virology again, not the vaccine schedule, not just isolation, purification, and culturing of viruses.

01:48:07.924 --> 01:48:14.327
A few months after this video, as far as I can tell, in 2022, when all the murder was over,

01:48:15.353 --> 01:48:20.594
when I had already lost my job for two years, when I had just been hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:48:21.335 --> 01:48:33.158
to start working on this book, which would end up having an awful lot of the evidence in there, including the Sina Bavari Tortura paper, and including several statements by me explaining why they would never even need a virus.

01:48:33.698 --> 01:48:37.499
They just need the recombinant DNA and a spectacular commitment to lies.

01:48:37.959 --> 01:48:44.041
A spectacular commitment to lies that would include people like Tom Cowan, Mark Bailey, and Andrew Kaufman.

01:48:46.277 --> 01:48:50.380
you know, toxicity and danger of the injectable vaccine products.

01:48:51.521 --> 01:49:03.469
I mean, imagine going on a stream and discussing virology with somebody who had called your wife Bimbo Bailey for a year with multiple memes with hot dogs in her mouth.

01:49:03.949 --> 01:49:15.738
Because that's what Mark Bailey did when his handlers told him that he had to go on the Tim Truth podcast and talk to Kevin McCairn, the guy who had been making memes about his wife.

01:49:16.863 --> 01:49:23.628
that included Bimbo Bailey being a gift that came up when he got a donation.

01:49:27.632 --> 01:49:36.899
That's how you can see that Mark Bailey has capitulated to this multinational bullshit narrative that is being coordinated by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone.

01:49:37.519 --> 01:49:40.482
Because instead of defending the honor of his wife,

01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:51.472
and having a debate about the virus with anybody else, he did exactly what he was told and had a debate with Kevin McCairn on the Tim Truth podcast in 2022.

01:49:52.732 --> 01:49:55.632
That's how much of a coward script reader he is.

01:49:55.652 --> 01:50:11.015
And, you know, maybe there is some good to come out of some of these things, but I would also say, like, if you only think something is worth looking into because you see it on Joe Rogan, then there's really a deeper problem that we should be talking about.

01:50:11.462 --> 01:50:13.605
you know, which is how do you learn information?

01:50:14.347 --> 01:50:15.488
What's not from him.

01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:17.131
That's for sure.

01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:17.972
It's not from him.

01:50:19.418 --> 01:50:22.920
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I'm going to move on because they've made their point.

01:50:23.501 --> 01:50:25.142
I don't know how far that video goes.

01:50:25.162 --> 01:50:26.323
You can see it if you want.

01:50:26.543 --> 01:50:29.184
Together, these people are on a script.

01:50:29.204 --> 01:50:30.525
You're not going to be able to change it.

01:50:30.565 --> 01:50:34.748
You can even get on stage and interact with them, but they're going to stay on their script.

01:50:34.788 --> 01:50:36.569
The next act is the next act.

01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:42.893
And it is that spectacular commitment to that script that makes it obvious that these people are traitors.

01:50:42.953 --> 01:50:44.855
They will never explain to you

01:50:45.495 --> 01:50:48.817
that making a pure mRNA was never possible.

01:50:49.157 --> 01:50:58.021
They will never explain to you how advantageous it would be to everything in this narrative to have rolled out a huge majority of placebos.

01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:06.084
You can meet any manufacturing quota like that and you can make a perfect PCR positive with synthetic pure DNA.

01:51:06.625 --> 01:51:09.666
And that would be enough to seed all the narrative you'd need.

01:51:10.126 --> 01:51:14.128
You could even take that and misconstrue a background

01:51:15.302 --> 01:51:26.585
by putting that PCR pure product somewhere, you know, like in Wuhan with an agent and have her report the sequence that you wanted to claim was found and then go from there.

01:51:26.625 --> 01:51:33.027
Maybe even put somebody like Robert Malone on the internet with a couple of buddies like Andrew Kaufman to pretend to argue with him.

01:51:34.168 --> 01:51:35.828
Transfection was always a crime.

01:51:36.748 --> 01:51:39.049
Transformation in healthy people was a crime.

01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:42.971
And that's why these people are never going to say it.

01:51:43.351 --> 01:51:44.672
They're never going to say placebo.

01:51:44.732 --> 01:51:45.833
This is how it was done.

01:51:46.313 --> 01:51:49.614
They're never going to tell you that endemicity is really dumb.

01:51:49.694 --> 01:51:55.798
And that would be another thing that somebody like Tom Cowan, after five or six years of being aware, should have gotten to by now.

01:51:55.838 --> 01:51:59.059
But it's the lack of progress that shows you he's a liar.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:20.356
And so the background, to understand this beautiful background of bacteria and archaea and all of their bacteriophage communication that's going on, that covers us, surrounds us, and we bathe in.

01:52:21.777 --> 01:52:27.763
Ladies and gentlemen, with simple nonspecific PCR tests and a spectacular commitment to lie about what that background is,

01:52:28.895 --> 01:52:31.297
Never talking about bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:52:31.357 --> 01:52:34.579
Never talking about archaea and the phages that infect them.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.441
And just talking about bifidobacteria.

01:52:40.638 --> 01:52:42.580
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:44.181
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:52:44.242 --> 01:52:47.324
Healthy people should never have been transfected or transformed.

01:52:47.745 --> 01:52:53.170
And the population pyramid is a problem that needed managing and they took advantage of to create this mythology.

01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:55.512
Thank you very much for being here on an Easter.

01:52:56.453 --> 01:52:58.375
I'm sorry it wasn't more positive, but it is.

01:52:58.615 --> 01:53:02.779
It's positive because you can see it so clearly now and anybody can see it.

01:53:02.819 --> 01:53:03.179
The left

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:08.983
and the right can see it, your friends and family can see it, as long as you can show it to them.

01:53:09.104 --> 01:53:14.027
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOMBiological.com, where you can find a way to support this work.

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.388
It would really be appreciated.

01:53:15.808 --> 01:53:23.753
We are trying to get out a new Biology 101 in the form of lectures, in the form of journal clubs, and in the form of a textbook.

01:53:23.913 --> 01:53:26.615
So we got a lot of work to do and we need a lot of support.

01:53:26.995 --> 01:53:31.518
If you want to share this video, please share the video on stream.gigaom.bio because we pay for that.

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:34.521
I don't know.

01:53:34.981 --> 01:53:47.170
If you can support us and you can't support financially, please just try to share the work in a place that you haven't shared it before or try to get in a habit of sharing it regularly via email with all your family and friends.

01:53:48.811 --> 01:53:52.714
The only way out is for us to teach this to our kids so that they can teach it to their kids.

01:53:53.674 --> 01:54:00.119
Otherwise, they will inherit social media and they will inherit the slavery that's built within it.

01:54:00.679 --> 01:54:03.761
Thank you very much for being here and I'll see you again very soon, probably tomorrow.

01:54:14.786 --> 01:54:15.887
Look at this guy work!

01:54:17.388 --> 01:54:17.988
Rebound!

01:54:23.011 --> 01:54:23.711
Rebound tip!

01:54:28.951 --> 01:54:29.811
Never stop.

01:54:30.672 --> 01:54:32.433
Never stop, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:32.513 --> 01:54:34.213
Never stop until the ball's dead.

01:54:34.273 --> 01:54:35.054
Go, go, go.

01:54:35.234 --> 01:54:35.774
Yes!

01:54:37.095 --> 01:54:37.935
I love you guys.

01:54:38.855 --> 01:54:40.056
I'll see you again very soon.

01:54:44.018 --> 01:54:44.538
Yeah, baby.

01:54:59.434 --> 01:55:00.122
Thank you, everybody.

01:55:00.162 --> 01:55:00.971
I'll see you again soon.
