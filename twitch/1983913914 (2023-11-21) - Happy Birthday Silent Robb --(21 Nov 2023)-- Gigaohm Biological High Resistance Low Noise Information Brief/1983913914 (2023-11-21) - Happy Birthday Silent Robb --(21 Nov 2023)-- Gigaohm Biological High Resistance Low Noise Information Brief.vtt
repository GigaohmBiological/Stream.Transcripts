WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:14.000
Liam Sturgis in the audience I suspect you'll be turning over to another to another stream at nine o'clock

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
It's a pretty hot one going over there. I might even have to switch over to it. I'm not quite sure yet. I haven't decided what I'm gonna do

01:30.000 --> 01:50.000
Liam Sturgis the man the myth the legend. That's really it's good to see you man. Good to see you there

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
I don't have any water. I don't have any water. I have no drink. I have nothing. What am I doing?

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
How did I pull the trigger with no drink down here?

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Man, oh man, that's terrible. My voice has gotten even better Liam. I don't know what to tell you but

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The vocal cords are still recovering. Pretty cool.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
So damn hot.

03:36.000 --> 03:54.000
So this stream is brought to you by a patch clamp physiologist. What that basically means is that you make recordings from cell cultures or

03:54.000 --> 04:05.000
tissue preparations like brain slices and in my case you can make recordings between neurons that are synaptically connected with electrical connections that you can then stimulate and measure.

04:05.000 --> 04:18.000
You can look me up on PubMed by putting my last name C-O-U-E-Y hypon J-J into the top search bar and the articles that show up will all have my name in them.

04:19.000 --> 04:43.000
The reason why we call this the giga ohm biological high resistance low noise information brief is because the electrical recordings that I used to make as a biologist were made with borosilicate glass touching the phospholipid bilayer of the neuron and that would make a giga ohm seal which was indeed high resistance and very low noise.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And that's where giga ohm biological comes from.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
So let's get this thing started. I think this should be a pretty good.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
We should be in pretty good sync. You can let me know if that's true or not and then we'll get going.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm watching the chat all the time. I just don't react to it very much.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
How's that sound look?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Are we okay? Can I stop? Yes, good sync, good sound. That's what I like to hear.

05:19.000 --> 05:48.000
It is indeed a faith in a novel virus we are trying to dispel

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
because that faith doesn't need a lie.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
Just make you understand intramuscular injection of any combination of substance.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
The intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

06:03.000 --> 06:15.000
Transfection in healthy humans is crunally negligent and viruses are not pattern integrity.

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
So that's where we are asking these questions, trying to answer these questions because there is a spectacular commitment to lies going on.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
This is giga ohm biological.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes, happy birthday Silent Rob. I forgot I titled it Happy Birthday Silent Rob.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Wow, good thanks for reminding me of that. Wow, that's a little.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
It's the 21st of November, 2023 and my little brother Rob is at least it's his birthday today.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I don't know how old he is. I'd have to think about it for a little while.

07:00.000 --> 07:11.000
He hasn't spoken to me since he fired me back in February of 2021 for a series of problems that included me not wanting to wear a mask on set anymore.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.000
Anyway, that also resulted in basically my parents not talking to me anymore for the last few years.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
So happy birthday Rob. Thanks a lot for being silent Rob, the producer of this show.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
He provided one of the cameras and a bunch of the other things that were basically extra stuff that he had from his photography studio.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So, you know, everything works out in the end. So thanks for that.

07:38.000 --> 07:51.000
I just wanted to start with a few short clips to kind of remind you of where we are, where we've been, where we're going and make sure that you aren't confused about these things.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Let me just switch over here really quick and see if this works.

07:56.000 --> 08:10.000
So remember, first of all, on March 21, 2021, one year after the start of this fiasco, they had a little memorial.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Please welcome Mayor Bill de Blasio.

08:13.000 --> 08:23.000
And this memorial in New York City involves projections onto the Brooklyn Bridge and it involved this rather interesting speech.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
About 30,000 people who died, maybe 25,000 of them died or 21,000 of them died in four weeks.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Ask everyone together.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
Jessica Hockett's whole city together.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Let's have a moment of silence for all those we loved and all those we lost.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
It's lucky it's cold because he can, you know, confuse people with what sounds like emotion.

08:53.000 --> 09:02.000
These were the games that they played with us from the very beginning and now that you can see it from this distance with this much retrospective, you know, inside.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Every morning, it's shocking.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
The first thing I see is a list and there are numbers on it.

09:15.000 --> 09:28.000
But what it really means is how many people we lost, how many New Yorkers are gone, how many neighbors, how many members of our family.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Today, that number is more than 30,000.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It's a number we can barely imagine.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
We can barely find them.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
New Yorkers lost then in World War II.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We can barely keep track of where they are anymore.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Hurricane Sandy and 9, 11 put together.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
No death certificates, no, nothing.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
We don't know where we can't find anything in some way.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
And for so many families, a pain, a pain that is raw.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't even know if we have a list of names.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I don't think we do.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And yet New Yorkers are always there for each other.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
And tonight, so many people have gathered to show their love.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
To show their support of the family members left behind.

10:19.000 --> 10:42.000
I want to thank everybody who created this memorial as a labor of love, everyone who spoke, everyone who played a piece of music to comfort us, everyone who created something to give something back to their fellow New Yorkers.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, he walked up to the point of the past.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I have a vivid memory.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Last May.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
I went to visit Queensbridge Houses, Nica.

10:56.000 --> 11:10.000
And as I walked through the development, a resident came up to talk to me and then another member of the community came around and then another and another and I found myself a part of a circle.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And everyone in the circle was mourning.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Everyone in the circle had lost someone.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
They told me about an aunt or an uncle, a grandma.

11:22.000 --> 11:31.000
And then they told me the hardest part was they could not mourn together.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
And they felt the pain, the loss.

11:39.000 --> 11:47.000
And that moment was one of those times where it became clear just how deep this pain was for all of us.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
How much the virus has stolen from us.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
The virus, the virus has stolen from us.

11:54.000 --> 12:03.000
But then when people start telling the stories of those they loved, a little joy starts to come back into their voice.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Smile comes across their face.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Reminds me of a beautiful passage from Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And he said this about grief.

12:18.000 --> 12:40.000
No matter what, no one can take away the dances we've already had.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
I think about a dear friend, my college roommate, Tom.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
He fell in love with a renowned New Yorker, a legend, the playwright, Terrence McNally.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
And when he lost Terrence, I called him and he said he couldn't believe he was gone.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
But he knew that Terrence.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Those are COVID victims on the bridge.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Those are COVID victims on the bridge.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
They're COVID victims.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
They're lifted and enlightened.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
COVID victims.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
New Yorkers and people, the world brown.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
And he knew that joy, that hope would continue.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Doesn't it make the pandemic more real for you though?

13:27.000 --> 13:36.000
I guarantee you it makes it more real for all the people that donated their picture for this.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I guarantee you it makes it more real for them.

13:40.000 --> 13:49.000
For everybody that didn't know better back then that there was do not resuscitate orders or that there were protocols that they needed to be afraid of.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
That they shouldn't call the ambulance.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Like they didn't know.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
And so a lot of people in New York probably actually believe their relatives died of COVID still to this day.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That's how much work we have to do.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Everybody that put their picture up on that friggin bridge definitely does.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
We've got to take this seriously.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
There has been some massive, massive, massive psychological experiment.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Real enchantments cast on us.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That's why I wanted you to see this.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
I'm not sure how many of us really remember how remarkable it was back in 2020 and early 2021.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
This is right when they're trying to roll out the shots.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
So they need everybody on board with the worst case scenario.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Don't forget that lockdowns had some effect.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And otherwise it could be much worse than it is had we not locked down.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Had Brett Weinstein not shown us how to use a bandana to protect ourselves when we left the house.

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
Had Brett Weinstein not shown us this great example of how we stay home and isolate from our family and friends for nine or ten months.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
We might have had a much worse pandemic.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
And this is now the time when we don't want to let up our guard.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
We want to make sure that we're taking the shot when we're offered.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
That's how they were talking about it here with the free french fries and stuff.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Excuse me.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Single one of them.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Everyone we've lost, what they did goes on.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
What they contributed, what they created.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
The love they gave goes on.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
The teachers we lost, the educators.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
What they gave to young people.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's carried on every day.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Excuse me.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The faith leaders are clergy.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Excuse me.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And we lost them.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
Their congregations carried them on in their hearts and in their faith.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The healthcare heroes.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Those who were there for us no matter what.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And we lost some of those good souls.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Hey Elizabeth Rogers in the audience.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Nice to see you.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
We saved lives.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
And the people walking around today.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Because a doctor or nurse was there for them.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Or an EMT or a paramedic.

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
The people walking around today, they carry the hearts of those we've lost with them.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I still haven't figured out how all those grocery store workers didn't die.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
But you know, it was a really deadly virus spread like hell.

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
The moms, the dads, the grandparents.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
All that was great about them.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
All that was warm.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
Their souls continue on in their sons and daughters and in their grandchildren.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
There's something especially evil about invoking the memory of people's dead relatives.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
In a disingenuous way.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
There's something extremely.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Evil about misleading young people by provoking and evoking the memory.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Of their lost relatives.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
This is some extraordinary stuff.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
If you look back now and you see this for what it was, not as it happened.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
But we're talking about two and a half years later.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
This is March 2021.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
One year after the declaration of 15 days to slow the spread.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
When Paul Cantrell was talking for 16 days to crush the curve, to smash the curve.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
And so it is to all of us to do something very simple.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Very beautiful.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Very powerful.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
It is time to make them proud.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So I don't know.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
They are so lost.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm glad I waited for the second shoulder to shoulder.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
One for another.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
We've got to go some time and watch an old speech of Ronald Reagan so that you can see what it was like when adults used to talk at a decent place.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
And you didn't have to speed up the video on YouTube in order to make it digestible.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
These speeches that these politicians do are really aimed at such a low intellect level.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's scary.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I couldn't have a conversation with somebody who talked like this.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
And even if they sped it up double, I couldn't talk to a person who talked like this.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
So where are we?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
We're dealing with somebody like Mandy Cohen now.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
And I want to show you a couple examples in case you forgot how bad this is.

18:50.000 --> 19:02.000
This is right now 2023 that was just released by the CDC, which adds to the evidence that vaccinations during pregnancy helps protect patients and newborns.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Today I'm going to answer a few questions about getting vaccinated when you're pregnant.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Now let's just be really clear about what she's not going to answer questions about.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
If there's a fetus developing inside a young mother.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Developing fetus means development.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Development means cell division.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Cell division means whoa.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
There's a great big giant danger there.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
That's the reason why moms weren't allowed to eat.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Maybe think about not eating tuna fish.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Don't ever eat sushi.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh my gosh.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Unpassed your eyes.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Cheese.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
And so now we're talking about injecting some combination of substances to augment the immune system of the mother.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
And also protect the baby right after birth.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
As if they understand how these pattern integrity's work to the extent to which they can augment them in this way.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
It is absolutely ridiculous for them to talk like this.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
It is absolutely ridiculous for somebody to believe that this is the state of the art.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
And I honestly don't think that if we had a whiteboard on either side of a room.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
And one hour that this woman and I would end up with.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
She would have almost nothing on her whiteboard.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
And I would have it covered with facts that she can't dispute.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And I think there are quite a few people on our side who could do that to Mandy Cohen.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
Because I don't think Mandy Cohen really brings much expertise to her position.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
And if it is, it's an expertise in the shape of a very thin needle.

20:39.000 --> 20:49.000
You know, one PhD project and one little sliver of expertise that goes right to the edge of knowledge about one specific topic like.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
A subtype of G protein couple receptor and that's it.

20:54.000 --> 21:05.000
Now I I'm not saying I'm some kind of polymath, but I have spent my whole life trying to decide what part of biology was the most interesting and walking in all different directions for a long ways.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
And I dedicated my whole adult life to being a academic biologist.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
So I actually understand how it is to swim with these people and who swims with them.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
And I see them in a different light now than I have had in the past and did in the past.

21:20.000 --> 21:29.000
And I also think that 10 years ago when I was really in the heart of my career.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What I would call my academic career.

21:31.000 --> 21:45.000
There was still a preponderance of good intentions and good programs and largely just the real medical and nutrition sciences were starting to be corrupted.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Maybe a little psychiatry.

21:47.000 --> 21:57.000
But about the time that I started to try and get positions is when everything kind of went exponentially bad.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
The hiring process went exponentially bad.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
The the equity went exponentially bad.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
The the impetus to get patents went exponentially bad.

22:09.000 --> 22:22.000
The impetus to to have some kind of, you know, the the grants became much more pigeonholed in the, you know, all these different themed grants, which essentially means you can't come up with your own ideas, but you got to come up with.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
How does your idea fit into their to their grant proposal?

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
And so she is now the head of the CDC, an extremely important organization in the bureaucracy of America.

22:33.000 --> 22:51.000
And it frightens me to think that someone of her shallow biological knowledge could be allowed to on a professional level and basis advocate for the augmentation of pregnant women's immunity.

22:51.000 --> 23:04.000
The pregnant women's immune systems with really what appears to be no regard for the developing fetus and the absolute sacredness of this time.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
When a woman is pregnant, when she's not supposed to wear makeup, no lotion, don't use all those products anymore.

23:11.000 --> 23:26.000
When you're having a not when you're not when you have a baby developing and you what are you nuts?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
First question.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
When during pregnancy, should a person get a COVID-19 flu and RSV vaccine?

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
So the COVID and flu vaccines are recommended for everyone over six months and that includes moms who are pregnant.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
You can get a COVID or flu vaccine at any point during pregnancy.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
For the RSV vaccine, you can get that vaccine if you are between 32 to 36 weeks pregnant.

23:55.000 --> 24:04.000
When you get vaccinated during pregnancy, you pass on your antibodies to your baby and they are born with some protection through your vaccination.

24:04.000 --> 24:13.000
This is a great news for keeping yourself as healthy as possible during pregnancy and to protect the health of your baby.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Next question.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
Is getting vaccinated for COVID flu and RSV during pregnancy safe for me and my baby?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Another great question and one a lot of people are asking.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
The answer is yes.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Getting the COVID flu and RSV vaccine during pregnancy is safe for you.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Does anybody know what that symbol is around your neck?

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
Have not been linked to any increased risk of negative effects during pregnancy or for the baby.

24:40.000 --> 24:51.000
And the good news is when you get vaccinated during pregnancy, you pass on your antibodies to your baby and they're born with some protection through your vaccination.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
Born with antibodies from you and those antibodies apparently are protecting.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Case you.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Hi everyone.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
It's Mandy Cohen, CDC Director and I am here at Morris Brown College.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm here with the President Dr. James and I'm here with a great partner of ours from the conference of national black churches.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
This is Jackie Burton and she's amazing and they have been working with the CDC on vaccinations throughout the pandemic.

25:19.000 --> 25:30.000
They've done more than a million COVID vaccines and I can't tell you how important a partnership with our historically black colleges and partnerships with our black churches around the country has been.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I just wanted you guys to get a chance to meet them.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
So why don't I turn it over to Dr. James first and then I'd love to hear from Jackie as well.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Sure.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
My name is Kevin James.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I'm honored to serve as the President of Morris Brown College.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
HBCU founded in 1881, 142 years ago.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
We are related to partner with you all today to provide this service to our community.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
Continue to watch Morris Brown College as we continue to expand what we're doing here that will be called the hard reset.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Welcome.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Thank you.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
All right.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And Dr. Burton, tell us about your just a legend.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So first, thank you.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
But tell me about the work that you've been doing vaccinating the community.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Great.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The CDC contact.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
It's a really weird ego attack there with, you know, you're just a legend and you're amazing.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
Anytime anyone ever starts with that, I automatically assume that there's something going on.

26:18.000 --> 26:33.000
And obviously these two are being manipulated or their organizations are being manipulated by the CDC to take money to promote the health policy of the CDC.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
And it could be that these two are just not sophisticated enough to understand that this biology is a scam.

26:38.000 --> 26:46.000
That more and more vaccines are not a sign of progress.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
But we've got to start helping these people.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
We've got to start helping and reaching out to people who are already.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Back to us.

26:58.000 --> 27:07.000
At the CNBC, the Conference of National Black Churches, when the pandemic first started and said, can you help us get the word into the African American community?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Well, of course we can.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
Black churches are the center of our communities and it is work.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
They have, I won't give you the number, but multi millions of dollars since 2020.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And we are delighted.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
We're in our third year of funding and looking toward the fourth year, but it is a made a difference.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
Our churches through our sixth largest historically black denominations have worked very hard.

27:31.000 --> 27:40.000
And that's how we ended up with this over a million vaccines through our churches, through community centers, nursing homes, even some hospitals.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
But it has made a difference.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
We could not have done this unless CDC believed in us.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Well, we love that partnership and we've been talking a lot about building trust.

27:51.000 --> 28:00.000
And so making sure that we have access points for folks can get the vaccine close to their community as well as from people that they trust and hear from folks that they trust.

28:00.000 --> 28:19.000
So we are grateful again to be here at historically black because essentially they're using their these pastors, giving them money, buying them off and buying these churches off and using the trust that these people have in their church.

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
In order to give them a vaccine and it's a vaccine that they don't need that they could better off be giving them multivitamins.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
Or, or organic vegetables or, you know, I mean, it's just extraordinary what they're what we're doing here.

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
It might actually be better for instead of providing vaccines for everybody in this church that they provided an organic meal.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Or, I mean, I just, this is where we are though.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I mean, this is still going.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
This is like a day ago.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
They help officials are urging people to take some extra precautions.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
That's because the CDC estimates there have already been up to 1.6 million flu cases.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
RSV infections are also on the rides, especially impacting kids under the age of four and COVID-19.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
We're concerned for a lot of families, but only about 15% of adults have received that updated shot.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So let's break it down and see what it all means.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
How we can protect ourselves and our loved ones is the CDC's new director, Dr. Mandy Cohen, Dr. Cohen.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I'm so happy that you're here with us today.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
As we said, tons of people are on the road.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
People are going to be gathering.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
Not many people have gotten the flu shot or the COVID shot.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
So what's going to happen here is the two ladies that are asking questions will agree with the lady there questioning.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
And that creates an illusion of consensus.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
So they're all going to agree on what the good plan is for the Thanksgiving weekend.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm concerned to argue about these holiday gatherings.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, look, we love to gather during the holidays.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And first, it's wonderful to be here with both of you.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
So fun.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
But as we get into the holidays, we need to protect each other.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
And yes, too few people have gotten the vaccine so far.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
And I know folks are over COVID and they want to leave it in the rearview mirror, but it's here with us.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So the three reasons to get vaccinated.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
One, the virus has changed.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So you want the most updated protection you can get.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
Second, if you had COVID before or you've been vaccinated, that protection has decreased over time.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So you want the boosted up protection.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
And third, people are still getting long COVID, right?

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
The long symptoms from that virus, even if you get a mild case.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
So all three reasons, we don't want to be sick, but we certainly don't want to be sick for a long time.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
So getting vaccinated is still really the most important way you can protect yourself and your family.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It was hard to get the COVID vaccine in the early going.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
This more updated one.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
Do you feel like all those wrinkles have been kind of ironed out and it's pretty accessible now?

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah, so moving out of the emergency, the federal government wasn't purchasing and distributing.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
The private sector was doing it.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
They did have some hiccups right at the beginning, but that's all really been ironed out.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Plenty of supply of vaccine for COVID and flu.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Get your appointment now.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
It's not.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
I remember very clearly this idea that there was going to be a shortage.

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
And in fact, I think I have a video somewhere in my archive of like a local ABC news channel saying that.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
They had vaccinated 10 people at the hospital and then the next day they were going to vaccinate like 300 more and they were doing it really slow.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
But whenever you were offered your vaccine, you need to take it because.

31:21.000 --> 31:30.000
You were a part of this health care apparatus and then they were slowly going to roll out the protection of the vaccine first to these people.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Who had been risking their lives throughout the beginning of the pandemic.

31:33.000 --> 31:41.000
And so she, she seems to be re telling that story about how there was a shortage and now there's a new shortage of the.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Of the advanced by Vayland, you know, booster or whatever.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
And so it's that perceived shortage.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
It's a, it's a little bit of a scyop, right?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
You drive past the place.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
They have shots.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Well, I better get one while I can.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
And they have used that throughout these three years to motivate people that are vulnerable to that kind of suggestion.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Ever too late to get vaccinated.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Never too late.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It's already in the middle season.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
No, never too late.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Right now.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
So plenty of time to get back to the number of people who have the flu.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
It seems pretty high.

32:15.000 --> 32:23.000
Do you think this is all because we had been isolated for so much because now I feel like people have had these long coughs for months that's been going on and on.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
There are a lot of bugs that are circulating viruses and bacteria, but we have ways to protect ourselves.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Vaccine is one.

32:30.000 --> 32:37.000
But also if you get sick over this holiday season, make sure you're getting tested because testing allows you to know what you have so you can get treatment.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
We have treatment for flu and for COVID and that treatment could save your life.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
You can get for free tests, COVID tests at COVID test.gov right now.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
We actually just yesterday said you can get for free new ones.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
So get your test.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Take them with you if you travel so you know if you're getting sick.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Dr. Cohen, you're the new sheriff in town, the new head of the CDC.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
And I don't have to tell you there have been some questions about trust in the agency in the wake of the pandemic.

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
Public surveys will show you that the CDC is held in not low regard, but the trust is not there as it used to be.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
What are you doing to turn it around?

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah, so I'm about six months into the job.

33:12.000 --> 33:21.000
We're focused on transparency where I think that's important to build trust, communicating faster, more simply, making sure we're focused on giving folks simple ways to protect themselves.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Certainly building relationships.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
And I personally have been traveling all around the country so that folks can hear from me directly.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
So not just the CDC director or the mom.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
I have two daughters who are nine and 11 and I want them to know what I did for my own daughters.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
And I got both of them, the updated COVID vaccine and the flu shot because I wanted them to be protected.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Same with myself.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
I got myself vaccinated.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
My parents.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I wouldn't recommend something for the American people.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I wouldn't do for my own family.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
And I want them to hear from from me directly. So I've been all over the country sharing that message.

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
I want to make sure you understand that it is not impossible at all impossible for her to believe every word she says.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It's not at all impossible.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
This.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Her not understanding.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Her salary, her success in this.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Industry has probably completely been dependent on it.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
She would not have moved up the ladder.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
Had she shown any internal or external doubts, even if she just expressed them over drinks.

34:23.000 --> 34:32.000
They would have immediately said, Oh, no, we need a completely committed 100% vaccine cheerleader here.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
We need somebody who believes in them like.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
Like the Weinstein's do the best invention of all mankind, except for maybe.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
You know, the wheel and the airplane.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
So you remember that we talked about censorship.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I wanted to play this whole video.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
This was the World Health Summit.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
So it was a little while ago, but it's important to understand.

35:02.000 --> 35:11.000
That we're being warned from both sides of the narrative that the world needs locking down the world needs a global control mechanism.

35:11.000 --> 35:18.000
The world needs a way of coordinating global governance.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
And so you can listen first to these two guys make the argument that we have no choice.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
If we want to be prepared for a pandemic, we have to give countries money to establish the control mechanism.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Otherwise, they will govern themselves.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.000
And then we also need to establish some kind of, you know, technocratic message control system so that.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Oh, that's awesome.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Thank you.

35:47.000 --> 35:55.000
That some kind of control system that keeps everybody, you know, all the messages right on point.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
So that's pretty extraordinary as well.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
So first, let's listen to this guys.

36:01.000 --> 36:10.000
If we do not support these 40 companies and institutions that they govern themselves, then we will not be better prepared,

36:10.000 --> 36:17.000
but we may be worse prepared because we now have also the info in them, a pandemic against us.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
Well, let's say everything that we do is basically questions by a social media war,

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
which will make it very more difficult to organize a response towards the future pandemic.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
This is where we currently are.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Does it ever make you wonder when you hear him talking?

36:38.000 --> 36:46.000
When you hear this guy talking, does it ever make you wonder whether he sounds as annoying in German when he speaks as he does when he speaks in English?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I really find myself wondering that.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Listen carefully to how he says it again because it's important.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
If we do not support these 40 countries with money and institutions that they govern themselves,

36:58.000 --> 37:07.000
then we will not be better prepared, but may be worse prepared because we now have also the info in them, a pandemic against us.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
Well, let's say everything that we do is basically questions by a social media war,

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
which will make it very more difficult to organize a response towards the future pandemic.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
This is where we currently are.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
The other issue as we are with the virus is communication and disinformation.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And this is such a complex issue.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
There are many media people here who exactly know what I'm speaking about.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
And we know who this guy is, right? This is Jorston.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
This is the guy who developed a PCR test for the original SARS.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
And then was called upon to develop a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2,

37:47.000 --> 37:55.000
which was reviewed and approved and published in 24 hours and then circulated as the who recommended primer set.

37:55.000 --> 38:05.000
And so that paper was, of course, opposed by another publication that a number of really interesting people were on.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
The interesting combination of people.

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
And so this is where the entire pandemic started with this guy, with that guy in Germany.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
And so it's extraordinary to hear them talking post pandemic, if you will.

38:21.000 --> 38:28.000
Maybe it's not post pandemic yet, but it's interesting to hear them talking this year about the things they need to fix.

38:28.000 --> 38:37.000
It's not very different from listening to Mark van Rance, the guy from Belgium, talking at the Chatham House in 2011.

38:37.000 --> 38:46.000
And lamenting about how during the swine flu, he didn't have things like Facebook and Twitter and whatever to help control the messaging.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
He had to work with newspapers and the websites of newspapers.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.000
But now with Facebook and Instagram and stuff like that, he thinks it would be in 2011 already.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
He thought it would be much easier for the messaging to be powerful in that sense and controlling.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
And so here, this guy's talking about how even for this pandemic, it wasn't good enough.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
So that's pretty extraordinary because we know from the dissident side, according to Robert Malone,

39:14.000 --> 39:28.000
I mean, he was horribly censored. According to Brett Weinstein, he lost a huge amount of his income was just slaughtered away by the censorship of the pandemic.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
I mean, he was just, you know, his family income was just crippled.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
This is really the intervention in the beginning of a pandemic.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
So there are two interventions that are really efficient before we have a drug or vaccine.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
This is diagnostic testing and then it's political decision-making.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
And once this political decision-making...

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, they can't even find his PhD anymore.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
They can't find the actual publication in the library. It should be, and it's pretty funny.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
It's influenced and contorted by disinformation and propaganda we are lost.

40:05.000 --> 40:12.000
And there are roles that are not being fulfilled by the media themselves.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
They really have to look in the mirror.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.000
And there is another role that some sometimes ignored a little bit, which is the role of science itself.

40:21.000 --> 40:30.000
So we shouldn't have anybody who has some academic degree talking about the heart of the issue in the middle of a pandemic.

40:30.000 --> 40:38.000
We have to address the institutions of science to make some selection to set up panels of experts who are really experts

40:38.000 --> 40:47.000
and who wouldn't push into the media, but who are somehow qualified to summarize the state of knowledge.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
And this can only happen via the institutions of science.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
These institutions have to offer this function to society.

40:56.000 --> 41:04.000
And these institutions of science, they are actually consisting of scientists, of top scientists.

41:04.000 --> 41:14.000
And it's really about being a little bit less opportunistic as a scientist, being a little bit more of service to society.

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
A little bit more of service to society, society being the big S society, like big S science.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
If we do not.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Why is that going backwards?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
I was weird.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I don't know why I did that.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
What's happening here?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Oh, yeah.

41:31.000 --> 41:43.000
So I want you to compare that message to and what I'm trying to the point I'm trying to make here is that there's a very fine line between

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
warning and announcement.

41:46.000 --> 41:58.000
And I am starting to sense on our side that I could have seen it earlier that the difference between the, let's say the TV narrative

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
and the dissident narrative was that one was.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah.

42:07.000 --> 42:14.000
I really feel like one was sort of working hard to.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Announce.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
And one was working hard to warn.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
And the way that they switch those roles.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
It's like a game.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a performance.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
And so they switch from warning us about misinformation.

42:34.000 --> 42:51.000
To announcing that they're going to stop it or announcing that they're going to change it with a who treaty or announcing that they're going to change it because, you know, the, the WF is going to change it.

42:51.000 --> 42:58.000
The who's going to change it or CEP is going to change it or the government's going to change or the FDA is going to CDC is going to declare this.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
And so that's very clever words that result in what appears to be a warning.

43:04.000 --> 43:15.000
But it's actually just an announcement appears to be complaining about, about misinformation, but it's actually just an announcement that we're going to stop it.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
It is a complaining about fifth generation warfare when it's really just an announcement that this is what's being done to you.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
You can't do anything about it.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
And so when I, if I can, if I finally imparted that idea on you, listen to this next video, please.

43:32.000 --> 43:47.000
From a belief system that says that nation state is an obsolete idea and we have to have a one world government that is basically a fusion of the interests of corporations and politics, global politics.

43:47.000 --> 43:55.000
And we've got to start by finding out who they are, voting them out of office, making sure they are not part of our governments.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Two notable characters here in the United States are governors, Inslee and Newsome.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Okay.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
We've got to out these people.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
We've got to force them to account for whether or not they're Americans or are they globalists.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
And if they're globalists, they got to get out.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
We've got to get rid of them.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
We've got to take back ownership of our country.

44:14.000 --> 44:27.000
If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in the principles of free speech and personal autonomy, medical autonomy and autonomy at every level, other level, it's time to fight.

44:27.000 --> 44:36.000
You know, or your children are going to live in basically a technofascism for the rest of their natural lives as serfs.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
No, I don't necessarily disagree with that last warning part of the description.

44:41.000 --> 44:49.000
But what I want you to think very carefully about is, is there a fine line being walked here between the announcement and a warning?

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
I've watched hours of this guy's presentations about fifth generation warfare.

44:54.000 --> 45:04.000
And I've heard him say at least three times that fifth generation warfare, you're never going to figure out who's doing it.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
And of all the people he could have named, he named two governors.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
Of all the people he could have named, those are the people he chose.

45:18.000 --> 45:28.000
He could have said lots of other things that would have been closer to the mark of getting to the globalists versus the patriotic Americans.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
But he didn't.

45:32.000 --> 45:46.000
And I don't know what everybody's motivation is, but I do know that there is an illusion of consensus about a dangerous novel virus that killed millions of people and millions more were saved from.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
I do know that there is an illusion of consensus that gain of function is real.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
This virus may have come from it and a virus will come again.

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
That illusion of consensus is what we need to save our children from, because that is the basis for their upcoming slavery.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
I apologize for that lower, lower thing being wrong.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
So what are the things I want to point out about Robert Malone?

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
If you will recall from our previous discussions, Robert Malone was aligned with a company called Enovio.

46:17.000 --> 46:28.000
Enovio had a number of technologies including electroporation and DNA electroporation at the skin for vaccination.

46:28.000 --> 46:36.000
They were actually one of the two largest original players in the Warp Speed thing.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
It was Moderna and Enovio and those two got funding.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
And then they ended up choosing the mRNA.

46:44.000 --> 46:55.000
But if you look behind this guy's shoulder at the World Vaccine Congress in Washington in 2018, you can see on that board of ads the Enovio sign right there.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Can you see my arrow? That's Enovio.

46:59.000 --> 47:15.000
So Robert Malone wasn't a horse farmer in 2018. He was involved in a vaccine company that was positioning itself to be a world-class vaccine provider.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
And so let's make no mistake about this.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
It could be a guy who, there's Enovio again right there.

47:22.000 --> 47:38.000
It could be a guy who's putting his entire pharma career on the line or it could be a guy who's working to make sure that the illusion of consensus isn't broken about this novel virus that killed millions that millions more were saved from.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
The gain of function is real and a virus will come again.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
I think this is probably the case.

47:45.000 --> 47:58.000
And it could be that he believes in the novel virus that killed millions of people, but I'm skeptical, especially because he cut his teeth in the labs of the people who I think are responsible for this mythology.

47:58.000 --> 48:10.000
Gallo and Gardner and Baltimore and all of these people.

48:10.000 --> 48:17.000
They lied to us about the pandemic potential and bad caves and accessibility of it in cell culture.

48:17.000 --> 48:32.000
The accessibility of it with passage and animals like ferrets and they've definitely lied to us about how easy it is to stitch it together and have a new novel coronavirus start from a puddle and then cover the world with itself.

48:32.000 --> 48:40.000
They've lied to us about this potential so that they can invert the sovereignty of our children into permissions.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It's freedom to fascism.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
That's what this new world order is.

48:45.000 --> 49:01.000
And a lot of people are starting to use this term, but I tried to take it away from them very early in the pandemic with my JC on the woods videos because JC in the woods videos were really about identifying the new world order for what it really was.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
Which is what George H. W. Bush said in front of Congress or the UN or wherever it was he spoke.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
It's the new world order that all of these people have been talking about for a couple decades now at least.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
And that's why it's important to evoke it because it's not a new thing.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
It's an old thing.

49:21.000 --> 49:37.000
This is one continuous multi-generational plan to enslave our children and to make sure that the genetic data of the coming generations is accessible, collected, stored, and fed to their AI.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
And I can't help but play this again.

49:43.000 --> 50:01.000
I want you to imagine that we take a bunch of children into this subway station and we try to convince him that this guy is making up for the fact that the brakes don't work on this electric train and making up for the fact that the motor is weak and so he's also pushing the train to start it again.

50:01.000 --> 50:12.000
And depending on the age of those children, it wouldn't take very much more than a four or five year old kids to start to think that that's not what's happening here.

50:12.000 --> 50:29.000
And my analogy for the pandemic is instead of having one guy, maybe we should have 60 guys who are dressed in LED lined suits that make noise and they pretend like they're very strenuously working.

50:29.000 --> 50:44.000
Some of them grab onto the train early or have big wheels that they put against the train that shake while they pretend to stop it in big wheels that they put against the train to make it seem like it's going to go again.

50:44.000 --> 50:58.000
And now the kids would have a lot harder time believing that those people weren't physically stopping the train and physically starting it if they had these big machines that they were using or there was some other elaborate theater involved.

50:59.000 --> 51:16.000
And as long as the performers were all very coordinated in the way that they did it and didn't get in the way of the train or actually pull on the train and get dragged by it or if they did they used it in a way to mine stopping the train, they could make it really convincing.

51:17.000 --> 51:28.000
Think about that 60 or 70 minds, not this guy who's chalking his thing up, but minds, people that can really do fake movements and stuff like that, you know, really make it look good.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
Now what would those kids believe?

51:32.000 --> 51:41.000
Now that's a train. It's something you can understand. You can see it. You can hear it. You can feel the station shake has the train approaches.

51:41.000 --> 51:52.000
You can feel the station stop shaking as the train stops and you can feel it start to shake again when the train starts to move again.

51:52.000 --> 52:04.000
Pandemic wasn't like that. Pandemic was a bit more like a movie on your phone or a Netflix series.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
And a series of short videos on Facebook.

52:10.000 --> 52:23.000
But the number of people that were starting and stopping the train pretending to start and stop the train that was the pandemic were many more people.

52:24.000 --> 52:36.000
Some people were doing it unwittingly. Many more people were doing it wittingly, especially with regard to the people who were elevated on social media.

52:36.000 --> 52:53.000
All of them, all of them, all of them that were censored early in 2020 with much pomp and circumstance, including new apps like GAB and GEDR and whatever else.

52:53.000 --> 53:02.000
This was all baloney. It was all part of the train pulling and stopping and pushing act.

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
That went right along with the novel virus, meaning everybody's vulnerable. We got to agree on that. We got to all move with the train on that one.

53:12.000 --> 53:20.000
PCR and lateral flow testing are definitely high fidelity. That helps the train make it seem like we're stopping and starting it.

53:20.000 --> 53:45.000
And all of these stories were seeded and controlled for the purpose of this national security narrative where a huge bureaucracy, many bureaucracies around the world did a train stopping and starting exercise to convince their populations that a national security level pandemic had occurred.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
I just want you to digest this because I really think this is an apt analogy for what they did to us.

53:51.000 --> 54:11.000
I want you to think about 40 or 50 of those guys dressed in suits with lots of props, not just chalk, not just a skinny guy, but a bunch of big dudes making noise.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
That's what they did.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
That's what they did with this.

54:20.000 --> 54:28.000
That's why mystery virus doesn't equal excess deaths because you've got to subtract all the pulling and pushing of the train.

54:28.000 --> 54:42.000
The fake stopping and starting of the train that included do not resuscitate orders and ventilation and lack of antibiotics and poor use of steroids and remdesivir, medazlam and opioid deaths and death certificate fraud.

54:42.000 --> 54:48.000
And the list keeps going on and all of those have to be subtracted from excess deaths before you have any mystery virus.

54:48.000 --> 54:55.000
And guess what? There's nothing left.

54:55.000 --> 55:03.000
And so why are they doing this? Well, we're at a time point when they plan to reduce the amount of diversity on the earth.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
And before they do that, they need the AI to record it.

55:07.000 --> 55:14.000
I'm not saying it's going to work. Not saying it's a great idea. I'm not saying I believe in that transhuman crap.

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
But I am saying that in these secret meetings with lots of rich guys, they parade people up on stage.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
You know how actually they do it? You know what's crazy?

55:24.000 --> 55:37.000
And you should be thankful for this. But the guy who skateboard this is, I just pulled the green screen down.

55:38.000 --> 55:59.000
The guy who skateboard this is, Rodney Mullen used to have to go to TED Talks and food conferences and open the conference and make everybody think it's super cool how to learn skills and get into a flow state.

55:59.000 --> 56:08.000
And then the subsequent speakers would be talking about how AI is going to learn how to manipulate the genome and cure diseases.

56:08.000 --> 56:23.000
And then they would have, you know, after conference meetings where they did talk about more of these ideas in detail, more of the real plan in detail.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
So long story short, there are people everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, that know what's up.

56:28.000 --> 56:40.000
People as diverse as Rodney Mullen and Jonathan Cooley as diverse as Jessica Hockett and Mark Koolack.

56:40.000 --> 56:49.000
And we're going to start to make this network of people that is arduously working toward the truth.

56:49.000 --> 56:55.000
And listening to the people that they discuss things with.

56:55.000 --> 57:10.000
Not marching forward with certainty, marching forward with trepidation and with the flashlights facing up and forward, not back into the cave, but out.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
Arm straight.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
Because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
And without trying to be too repetitive.

57:30.000 --> 57:38.000
I am going to say that the one way that we can really unite the United States, I think, and be somewhat of a.

57:38.000 --> 57:50.000
Let's say, regain some of our respect in the world would be to cop to our role in this and make sure that we bring our system back into check.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
We reclaim our government exactly as Robert Mullen said we should.

57:54.000 --> 58:01.000
I don't want to be a broken record about this, but I think this is going to be GigaOM biologicals message for quite some time.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity.

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
This has been GigaOM Biological High Resistance, Illinois's information stream brought to you by a biologist.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
I'll see you again tomorrow night ladies and gentlemen.

58:31.000 --> 58:55.000
Music

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
96 people here good to see you thanks for joining Elizabeth.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
Thanks for joining again Pamela good to see you again Jeff.

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
Everybody that I'm not mentioning Jeff from Earth also there good to see you sir.

59:10.000 --> 59:20.000
Albert was there was your show canceled Albert I didn't see you this morning I thought you were going to be on CHD and then I didn't catch it you got to update me on that what did they do.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Anyway thanks guys see you tomorrow.

59:30.000 --> 59:35.000
