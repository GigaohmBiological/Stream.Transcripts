McKernan family and their journey from Packard Biologics or Packard Biosciences whatever the

03:05.520 --> 03:13.360
company was called all the way up until now where they are with medicinal genomics. It's a really

03:13.360 --> 03:25.120
incredible story of a successful family, a really cool father. His father died in 2019

03:25.120 --> 03:34.000
and God rest his soul. He seems like a really, really, really nice guy. The obituary that Mark

03:34.000 --> 03:43.040
has here on this website reads like he was a one-of-a-kind father. So that's pretty cool. All that

03:43.040 --> 03:49.440
stuff is there for you to read and check out. I think it's worth checking it out if you have any

03:49.440 --> 03:55.920
interest at all in trying to figure out who the players are in this narrative. It could just be

03:56.640 --> 04:03.600
that what you're going to find here is more evidence for your belief that Kevin McKernan is a real

04:03.600 --> 04:12.800
genuine expert in this field and representing the field well and that in many ways he has

04:12.800 --> 04:18.080
taken me and many other people to school. That could very well be the case. It's also possible

04:18.800 --> 04:24.000
that this history and the people that he is connected to in these newspaper articles and in

04:24.000 --> 04:31.280
this previous work will maybe, I don't know, lead you to think that there is a possibility that

04:31.840 --> 04:38.160
this is a sort of just the tip of the iceberg in terms of of his connections and his family's

04:38.160 --> 04:48.080
connections behind the scenes to a lot of the people and impetus behind the human genome project

04:48.080 --> 04:53.440
is the same impetus that was behind the special cancer virus program back in the 50s. It's the

04:53.440 --> 05:01.520
same impetus that is behind a lot of what is happening now with the shift to RNA and lipid

05:01.520 --> 05:08.560
nanoparticles and eventually moving forward from here. This was also a well-planned orchestrated

05:08.560 --> 05:18.000
shift and so even if he is just an innocent medicinal genomics pot marijuana genetics guy

05:18.640 --> 05:26.400
he is still someone whose father and brothers and career history took him very close and very

05:26.400 --> 05:33.200
often to the highest seats of power very close to the largest weaponized piles of money

05:33.840 --> 05:39.440
and very very close at least to these secret rooms where these secret meetings were happening

05:39.440 --> 05:47.280
about bioweapons and about bioterrorism and about biosecurity. Now he may not have been in any of

05:47.280 --> 05:51.760
those meetings he may not know any of those people really well he may not have gone to any of their

05:51.840 --> 06:00.480
poker games but the point is is that you try to connect me to someone in the human genome project

06:01.280 --> 06:08.480
knowing that the human genome project wasn't all NIH if you try to find a company that I started

06:08.480 --> 06:14.000
that was doing HIV testing if you try to find a company that I've started that did any kind of

06:14.000 --> 06:21.440
pathogenic or sorry pathogen testing PCR or otherwise I think you know maybe you should be more

06:21.440 --> 06:28.400
surprised. I think if you found out that I had spoken in front of the who in 2011 about flu

06:28.400 --> 06:33.840
vaccine fit and fill finish technologies I think you should be like whoa wait what

06:33.840 --> 06:45.040
and so it's really nice to imagine that the guy who had a a molecular biological technology

06:45.040 --> 06:51.440
called Longbow is actually just a hero coming to rescue us it would be great

06:52.800 --> 06:58.160
and it's also would be very sad if that's the only guy out of all of these people

06:59.040 --> 07:10.640
that is aware of this this problem this DNA in the shot thank goodness Kevin has alerted us to this

07:13.360 --> 07:20.080
but I do think it's worthy of consideration that this other side of the coin that these however

07:20.080 --> 07:25.280
you interpret these things what we're talking about is is every time a company of this size is sold

07:25.280 --> 07:31.760
we're talking about many many millions of dollars kinds of of sums of money that

07:31.760 --> 07:38.240
that don't happen randomly very often and certainly not back then and certainly not about these things

07:40.000 --> 07:45.440
these would have been the some of the highest security priority technologies of the day

07:48.000 --> 07:53.120
and certainly the trade secrets that were involved would have been very high security

07:54.080 --> 07:59.120
things it's not all open source technology here's how we do it here's the recipe

08:01.680 --> 08:06.000
and so what we're really dealing with here is something really important because it is

08:06.000 --> 08:12.960
interesting that rather than just you know having started out with saying that I'm a guy who

08:14.720 --> 08:21.040
who had a company that that used to do HIV testing right after I got out of the

08:23.280 --> 08:28.080
human genome project we just here we just heard about the human genome project for a couple years

08:29.120 --> 08:36.320
when he was even doing podcasts which he wasn't doing right away when he first merged on the

08:36.320 --> 08:44.000
scene remember that it was none other than this kind of pseudo objection to the PCR test complaining

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
that the PCR primers might not be right and who was on that paper and go find out who's on that

08:50.000 --> 08:55.840
corpsman jorston report objection paper with kevin mccurnan and go down that list of names

08:55.840 --> 09:04.000
find out who bobby mohaltreis and ask yourself what is kevin mccurnan doing on a paper with

09:04.000 --> 09:11.520
bobby mohaltre why is mike eden and and peter mcculla and thomas binder and claire crag what

09:11.600 --> 09:20.400
are they all doing on that paper who organized that paper and why wasn't it more about the whole

09:20.400 --> 09:27.440
idea of not using PCR as a diagnostic period rather than the incorrect use of PCR as a diagnostic

09:28.720 --> 09:33.680
and do you see the difference do you see how significant it is that this man

09:34.480 --> 09:39.760
after coming out of working for the human genome project started his own company in cooperation

09:39.760 --> 09:44.080
kind of sort of a support with his dad who already had a very giant company

09:46.800 --> 09:48.240
to make hiv testing

09:52.720 --> 09:57.840
have we not already through this last three and a half years of awakening not only have we figured

09:57.840 --> 10:03.520
out that maybe the the vaccine schedule in america for our children is is really terrible

10:04.400 --> 10:10.800
even when you just assume that some vaccines are okay and maybe even helpful but the way that

10:10.800 --> 10:17.440
they apply them in other countries is so different than the way that we apply them in our country

10:17.440 --> 10:21.680
there should already be red flags it should already be a point of discussion it should

10:21.680 --> 10:30.640
already be labeled as criminal and of course kevin is never going to touch that he's gonna

10:30.720 --> 10:36.880
keep your your mind raised or focused on whether or not mark got which cut which company bought

10:36.880 --> 10:44.000
which company after which company for which company sorry we didn't get the applied biosciences

10:44.000 --> 10:54.560
bought amgen bought which what you read that wikipedia it's not exactly clear when it is

10:54.560 --> 10:58.960
that perkin elmer split into two companies and blah blah blah and whatever happened in huha

11:00.960 --> 11:02.160
let's just put it this way

11:04.720 --> 11:11.200
the story of him dropping out of grad school to go work with eric lander on the human genome

11:11.200 --> 11:17.440
project and then making his own way through the world as an entrepreneur is a little bit hand waving

11:18.000 --> 11:25.440
because his dad was already a kingpin not a bad guy just a kingpin already a very

11:26.160 --> 11:36.480
established giant in in biotechnology this is not for nothing that that Kevin is cruising around

11:36.480 --> 11:41.440
like this it's not for nothing that he was in the white house before he was 30

11:42.640 --> 11:47.280
i mean he's a cool guy i'm sure he's very very smart but let's be face it ladies and gentlemen

11:47.280 --> 11:52.960
chances are very good that he's been walking around in some of these places where also people

11:52.960 --> 12:00.080
like Robert Malone or Thomas Monath or or or any of these people i mean if we can put him in the

12:00.080 --> 12:07.760
room with Craig Venner what more do you want i've never been in a meeting with Craig Venner

12:08.800 --> 12:16.720
i worked at Erasmus MC in in Rotterdam the Netherlands for four and a half years that i don't even think

12:16.720 --> 12:21.360
i ever saw Ron Fauciet in in a hallway i just saw him present once

12:25.840 --> 12:32.720
so it's a it's a strange thing if your career really intersects with these people on an intellectual

12:32.720 --> 12:41.040
property level on an on a on a corporate buyout level on a equity level i don't know

12:41.280 --> 12:49.840
on a stockholder level those are kinds of relationships that i don't have mark doesn't have

12:50.640 --> 12:56.320
so it's very strange that someone who's been running around in those circles working with

12:56.320 --> 13:01.920
that many zeros for this long spends any time at all with a person who's just trying to scratch

13:01.920 --> 13:09.920
together $2400 in rent every month and yeah it's $2400 a month in rent in Pittsburgh right now

13:10.000 --> 13:15.520
because a lot of LLCs and banks own houses and there's nothing to rent privately anymore

13:16.720 --> 13:22.720
when we moved to Pittsburgh we paid $1,500 a month in rent every month in 2016 and since

13:22.720 --> 13:30.800
it's gone up literally $1,000 a month because where that's that's without that's without utilities

13:31.600 --> 13:41.120
and yet you know let's just say the worst case scenario i'm here sitting in my garage with

13:44.000 --> 13:51.040
trying my best to fake people out of their money why would that guy even bother wasting his time with me

13:54.000 --> 13:58.480
why would he bother wasting his time with mark when he's getting 600 video views

13:59.280 --> 14:01.200
why would he even waste his time

14:06.960 --> 14:11.680
i think that's where we are i think you have to just realize that that the narrative isn't

14:11.680 --> 14:18.320
moving anymore because it can't move anymore in in the sense of we haven't pinned against the wall

14:20.800 --> 14:28.400
they can't talk about anything anymore without bumping into the wall of yeah but wait a minute

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
you haven't addressed the thing with excess deaths

14:32.720 --> 14:38.000
the last time that kevin mccurnan wrote a sub stack about me he tried to say that this is this

14:38.000 --> 14:43.120
sub stack he actually said it twice in the sub stack this sub stack isn't debating anything about

14:43.120 --> 14:49.120
the man-demik this sub stack isn't debating about what percentage of the of the covid deaths were

14:49.120 --> 14:57.360
due to the protocols in the atra atra-genic deaths this blog post isn't about that

14:58.080 --> 15:01.040
this blog post is about the swarm and clones

15:04.240 --> 15:10.560
because nobody wants to talk about it and i think when we listen to paul off it today paul

15:10.560 --> 15:15.520
off it will not also talk about it the reason why we're listening to paul off it is because

15:15.520 --> 15:22.640
actually he's going to talk about this time right here where we are we were at the beginning of the

15:22.640 --> 15:30.800
pandemic and where actually our commander-in-chief donald trump got covid and so it's very important

15:30.800 --> 15:39.840
in some ways to watch carefully and listen carefully to how someone like him um i actually

15:39.840 --> 15:44.880
watched the movie sling blade with my kids the other night my my voice and they really really

15:44.880 --> 15:51.760
enjoyed it a lot my son actually my oldest son at the at the table this afternoon said um i really

15:51.760 --> 15:56.960
liked that movie last night papa really wasn't bad i mean it wasn't an action movie but for a drama

15:56.960 --> 16:03.920
it was pretty good um and and that movie makes me really laugh because it feels very much as though

16:03.920 --> 16:11.680
paul off its chin is kind of coming out now in a way that billy bob's short thortons chin came out

16:11.680 --> 16:18.800
when he was playing carl in that and i can kind of see him staring in there like this in the camera

16:19.440 --> 16:27.520
and he's getting too old for this he's been lying so long that he's he's even becoming jaded about

16:27.520 --> 16:34.320
having to do it with his friend vincent and i'm not even sure vincent understands i really am not

16:34.320 --> 16:42.240
sure because he's so jovial and so happy about it that i'm kind of sort of thinking that maybe he

16:42.320 --> 16:49.440
doesn't get it but paul definitely paul definitely understands what was done paul definitely

16:49.440 --> 16:57.520
understands this whole list paul understands how distorted public health is relative to the

16:57.520 --> 17:02.720
numbers and how the messaging works how the messaging is more like something getting forced

17:02.720 --> 17:10.320
down your throat than it is like convincing you of anything and so this limited spectrum of debate

17:10.320 --> 17:16.880
i'm really interested to this take this little time this little evening video just to see

17:18.640 --> 17:25.280
what you and i see together as far as the limited spectrum of debate that he he outlines in this

17:25.280 --> 17:31.200
really short video remember um we got picked up by these people on the side of the road no matter

17:31.200 --> 17:37.360
who we got picked up by they were reciting the faith of a novel virus we heard we heard steve

17:37.360 --> 17:43.680
kirsch asking denny rankore over and over the other night um do you believe do you do you believe

17:43.680 --> 17:50.640
in that is that do you do you agree do you agree um and so that's really what it's come down to is a

17:50.640 --> 17:56.880
little bit of some people being responsible for misleading others and the others being

17:56.880 --> 18:04.320
unwitting participants in this in this illusion of a spreading risk additive pathogen which there is

18:04.320 --> 18:10.880
no evidence for um that might be the slide i'm going to stop on yeah we're going to stop right

18:10.880 --> 18:18.880
here and we're going to listen to mr pauly paul woofit where did i put him right here yes

18:21.200 --> 18:31.520
no right here yes from microb tv this is beyond the noise episode number 28

18:32.320 --> 18:42.320
recorded on january 31st 2024 i'm going to take some notes we'll laugh about it and then we'll

18:42.320 --> 18:46.320
say good night and i'll see you tomorrow i'm going to try and use some day time shows today is your

18:46.320 --> 18:50.560
host doc day time is going to work better i couldn't do it today because of some meetings i had

18:51.200 --> 18:58.000
this is the video version of paul's column on sub stack called beyond the noise cutting

18:58.720 --> 19:05.600
to the chase unimportant health topics and today we're going to have a look at paul's last column

19:05.600 --> 19:14.720
entitled trump's covid infection so maybe paul we can start by having you uh given overview of

19:14.720 --> 19:23.200
the course of his illness true so in mid- october um former president trump was diagnosed with covid

19:23.200 --> 19:30.640
and taken to the wall to read hospital um he had let his infection go on for fairly long so that by

19:30.640 --> 19:36.320
the time he got to the hospital he had pretty severe pneumonia he was considered for being

19:36.320 --> 19:41.040
ventilated which would have meant that probably um like pence would have taken over his commander

19:41.040 --> 19:47.600
in chief but he was sick and so um he was treated with a variety of medications he was given the

19:47.680 --> 19:54.720
anti-viral medication remdesivir he was given even though that actually um the anti-viral really

19:54.720 --> 19:59.760
wasn't licensed till the end of that month and he was given the monoclonal antibody regenaron

19:59.760 --> 20:05.920
which also wasn't really available at least for the general public until November and um and he

20:05.920 --> 20:13.600
was also given dexamethasone um the the he survived he would he was obviously um back in his office

20:13.600 --> 20:18.720
a few days later convinced that it was the monoclonal antibody regenaron that had saved his life

20:20.320 --> 20:27.360
now uh he tested positive but didn't do anything for seven days why is that you would think the

20:27.360 --> 20:33.840
commander-in-chief of the us would have physicians who would say let's do something immediately right

20:35.120 --> 20:40.160
i i don't know why he made that choice obviously it was the wrong choice had he um been able to

20:40.240 --> 20:46.640
identify uh with his or had he been able to admit i think to to the general public that he had

20:46.640 --> 20:52.880
covid that that he could have been treated earlier not in theory um the one thing that was available

20:52.880 --> 20:57.920
starting from the beginning of this pandemic and had been available for 100 years is convalescence

20:57.920 --> 21:03.840
era i mean convalescence era was was underutilized and wrongly used you know the the we tended to

21:03.840 --> 21:08.960
initially use convalescence era in that original Mayo Clinic study in hospitalized patients and

21:08.960 --> 21:13.440
it would be much better off giving it during the viral replication stage the first phase

21:13.440 --> 21:18.080
of illness which dr griffin has been very good at at explaining that that early stages compared to

21:18.080 --> 21:23.600
the immune stage later um could have really prevented him ever from being in the hospital

21:23.600 --> 21:28.160
but he didn't admit to either to himself or to the public that he was he had covid and in fact

21:28.160 --> 21:33.280
he proceeded to in fact other people like chris christie for example all right so you in this

21:33.280 --> 21:38.720
article you talk about what actually saved his his life so maybe we first we should talk about the

21:38.720 --> 21:44.560
two stages of covid to set up for that right so which is true for many viral infections the

21:44.560 --> 21:51.760
first stage viral replication is key and and so agents that decrease viral replication like

21:51.760 --> 22:00.000
monoclonal antibodies which prevent virus cell binding or um or antivirus like like remdesivir

22:00.000 --> 22:06.160
which is a um a replication so let's let's just pause it for a second here so he walked through

22:06.240 --> 22:12.720
quite a bit there of already the the narrative that they want to lay down so first

22:14.240 --> 22:19.840
yeah first trumps trumps covid infection is the title it happened in mid-October 20 he

22:20.960 --> 22:26.480
he let the infection go for too long i apologize this pen is not writing perfect i just put new

22:26.480 --> 22:33.840
ink in it um and he let the infection go too long and uh he had severe pneumonia so this is

22:33.840 --> 22:39.680
already a breaker here because for me severe pneumonia can't be viral they have told this story

22:39.680 --> 22:45.360
of viral pneumonia but that's really secondary pneumonia so that requires antibiotics and they

22:45.360 --> 22:55.520
don't mention antibiotics here so antibiotics are not mentioned and that's weird because i'm almost

22:55.520 --> 23:00.560
sure they would have given it to him but they're not mentioning it because they don't want you to

23:00.560 --> 23:07.760
think sorry it's got to dry they don't want you to think that um that antibiotics would have

23:07.760 --> 23:11.760
anything to do with it now again what are we talking about here why am i pushing this

23:12.560 --> 23:19.760
this idea i'm pushing it because i want you to consider the possibility that these people

23:20.880 --> 23:27.360
are misleading us and they're misleading us about this stuff right here this idea that

23:27.360 --> 23:36.480
that that's my arrow right there that that antibiotics that that steroids they're trying to

23:36.480 --> 23:42.240
mislead us with this stuff this isn't the slide i want it i want the one with the i want the one

23:42.240 --> 23:46.400
with the train would i start with that one did i show you the train one already i didn't start

23:46.400 --> 23:52.320
with that one i should have started with this one right here but this this is what we're we're

23:52.400 --> 23:58.240
dealing with here now and this is a continuation of it paul off it is still on this sort of

23:58.800 --> 24:04.880
enactment of what are the right questions to ask and then very very sternly answering the wrong

24:04.880 --> 24:11.520
questions and so he set us up with this idea again that that there is a

24:12.720 --> 24:19.360
oops that doesn't need i guess that could be there um he set us up with the idea that that he was

24:19.360 --> 24:26.160
given remdesivir regenaron and dexamethasone and that donald trump thinks that one of these things

24:26.160 --> 24:32.960
saved him but it's not the right one and so now we're already thinking in our head all remdesivir

24:34.960 --> 24:40.880
and that's all by design because if we're about to argue with this list and we're about to complain

24:40.880 --> 24:46.720
about this list then look what they got us to leave out completely the antibiotics the antibiotics

24:46.800 --> 24:52.640
which would have been the most appropriate thing for his general severe pneumonia that because he

24:52.640 --> 24:59.440
didn't do anything about it for so long which is very typical story of how people die of the

24:59.440 --> 25:03.840
protocols they get ventilated when they don't need to be get ventilated and more importantly

25:03.840 --> 25:09.840
they aren't given antibiotics because it's not on the protocol list because this is a viral

25:09.840 --> 25:15.520
pneumonia and antibiotics don't work on viruses we've heard everybody say that and especially in

25:16.080 --> 25:18.080
2020 and 21

25:23.840 --> 25:28.240
so let me get out of that and i'll go back to the video

25:30.080 --> 25:37.200
the application or oh yeah sorry so then he went on i forgot about that that's why i wanted to

25:37.200 --> 25:40.480
pause it so he went on to the viral replication

25:46.560 --> 25:51.280
and then there's some other phase right viral replication phase and then what did he say else

25:51.280 --> 25:57.120
previous inhibitors like backslope and i was just true for many but he didn't admit to either

25:57.120 --> 26:02.160
to the public that he was he had code and in fact he proceeded to in fact other people like

26:02.160 --> 26:07.680
Chris Christie for example all right so you in this article you talk about what actually saved

26:07.680 --> 26:12.800
his his life so maybe we first we should talk about the two stages of covid to set up for that

26:13.760 --> 26:21.200
two stages for many viral infections the first stage viral replication is key and and so agents

26:21.200 --> 26:27.280
that decrease viral replication like monoclonal antibodies which prevent virus cell binding or

26:28.000 --> 26:36.400
or antivirals like like remdesivir which is a a replication inhibits replication or

26:36.400 --> 26:42.320
where now we have protease inhibitors like backslope and i mean those early on clearly make a

26:42.320 --> 26:47.200
difference clearly decrease your chance of going on to develop severe disease but by the time you

26:47.200 --> 26:52.320
develop severe disease which takes time i mean it takes seven days ten days fourteen days to develop

26:52.320 --> 27:00.240
severe disease by that time viral replication is much less important as as as contributing to

27:00.240 --> 27:04.800
the pathogenesis of the illness at that point it's the immune response that's causing the symptoms

27:04.800 --> 27:09.440
and in the case of Donald Trump flooding his lungs with white cells so at that point in

27:09.440 --> 27:14.000
order to save his life you need to blunt the immune system you know you could argue this is

27:14.000 --> 27:19.200
something that's always sort of perplexing me at some level so where do you notice

27:20.160 --> 27:24.160
my slightly out of focus here maybe i need to focus my camera again

27:25.040 --> 27:31.440
um i wonder if you've noticed that uh it really feels as though

27:32.400 --> 27:39.120
um the second phase of covid is the cytokine storm and i haven't heard him say cytokine storm

27:39.120 --> 27:43.520
yet it's really weird don't you remember that for the first year there was this thing called the

27:44.080 --> 27:51.520
the cytokine storm wasn't it a cytokine or kind was it a cytokine i don't know a cytokine storm

27:52.160 --> 27:57.680
i mean i remember them talking about a cytokine storm all the time and a cytokine storm of course

27:57.680 --> 28:03.760
would be a immune system overreaction that would need something like dexamethasone to tamp it down

28:04.800 --> 28:10.560
which people like uh dr griffin on twiv have told us that it's completely inappropriate to

28:10.560 --> 28:19.200
use something like that for covid and so what i need you to see is that what needed to happen

28:19.200 --> 28:27.120
and what definitely needs to happen is that this this all needs to be absorbed right they need to

28:27.120 --> 28:36.960
move this this train they need to move this pantomime forward a little bit so that it slowly absorbs

28:37.040 --> 28:43.920
all of the objections of the narrative so that eventually the truth is accepted

28:45.840 --> 28:52.720
that's what we're doing over these years that's the whole process that we're involved in right now

28:52.720 --> 28:59.840
and the dominoes that we're trying to get ahead of and try to consistently point out

29:00.880 --> 29:05.520
how ahead we have been of these dominoes for the last three years we've been predicting that we

29:05.600 --> 29:10.640
were going to get here and for the last three years these people have been slowly shifting from

29:10.640 --> 29:18.160
denial to acceptance to saying yeah we were saying that all along obviously we couldn't know for sure

29:18.160 --> 29:24.240
but that's what we were thinking that's no different than having us right to know and

29:24.240 --> 29:30.800
Alex Washburn and a bunch of other people have podcasts about how well it's obvious it's a lab leak

29:30.800 --> 29:40.560
now what about all the people that were saying it was a lab leak in 2020 what about all the

29:40.560 --> 29:49.440
people that were saying there's no way something doesn't make sense because the sequence that they've

29:49.440 --> 29:58.240
shown us is fishy the tests they're using are fishy the symptomology is fishy the protocols are

29:58.240 --> 30:03.600
fishy and we can't figure it all out because everybody is spectacularly committed to the lie

30:03.600 --> 30:07.440
that it's all unknown that we don't know that there's no reason to look for a pattern because

30:07.440 --> 30:18.720
we don't have enough data yet this is the reason why we got here and the more different mistakes and

30:18.720 --> 30:22.480
reasons and misleading stories that were involved in getting us here the better

30:26.000 --> 30:30.480
so that as they clear the window that they themselves covered in dirt as they

30:31.040 --> 30:34.080
filter the water that they themselves made dirty

30:36.640 --> 30:40.480
and then show you look this is what clean water looks like yeah well no kidding

30:40.480 --> 30:48.240
we were trying to tell you that four years ago that's what this is it's supposed to be

30:48.240 --> 30:53.840
a little bit like exasperating it's supposed to make you feel that way because it's also

30:53.840 --> 31:00.000
supposed to be very comforting to the people on that side who had doubts who heard some of our

31:00.000 --> 31:05.040
arguments and thought wow I it makes sense to me but I can't distrust my television

31:05.440 --> 31:13.520
that's exactly where we are right now we may have had some of our family and friends on

31:13.520 --> 31:19.520
the fence for many years already now and it's people like Paul Offit that keep them from jumping

31:19.520 --> 31:28.400
over keep them from making the leap to understanding and Paul Offit does it exactly like this

31:29.040 --> 31:36.240
by absorbing little pieces of the narrative little pieces of the discussion in this case

31:36.240 --> 31:42.720
it's even more it's even more disturbing because he's not really absorbing anything yet he's

31:42.720 --> 31:45.760
actually just taking a different position on the train here

31:49.760 --> 31:54.480
he's now admitting that well dexamethasone was actually pretty handy and it may have had

31:54.480 --> 31:57.760
something to do with trump it couldn't have been the monoclonal antibodies

31:57.760 --> 32:02.880
because we can't even make ip out of those anymore so those couldn't possibly work in the future

32:05.600 --> 32:09.920
but dexamethasone might have worked and the reason why he says that is because that completely

32:09.920 --> 32:16.560
supports the narrative of a novel virus that causes a cytokine storm after a intense bout of

32:16.560 --> 32:23.680
viremia rather than reminding us that at the beginning of this story he said that

32:23.680 --> 32:26.640
dogged Donald Trump had severe pneumonia

32:29.600 --> 32:33.920
and there's not a doctor in the united states and maybe not a doctor in the free world that

32:33.920 --> 32:37.520
would have treated pneumonia with antivirals first

32:37.680 --> 32:46.560
let me say that again there's not a doctor on earth in the free world that would have treated

32:46.560 --> 32:54.480
pneumonia pneumonia with antivirals and not antibiotics before the pandemic not one

32:57.680 --> 33:02.400
and certainly none of them would have given remdesivir none of them would have given regenaron

33:02.400 --> 33:05.280
none of them would have given do you see

33:11.200 --> 33:18.160
so this is a really spectacular act because this is paul off it arguing with himself in a mirror

33:18.160 --> 33:24.800
about nothing covering topics that are they themselves that the whole idea of arguing about

33:24.800 --> 33:30.880
is irrelevant it's your immune system that killed you it's not the virus that you immune

33:31.760 --> 33:36.640
Donald Trump flooding his lungs with white cells so at that point in order to save his life you need

33:36.640 --> 33:40.800
to blunt the immune system you know you could argue and this is something that's always sort of

33:40.800 --> 33:46.400
perplexed me at some level it's your immune system that killed you it's not the virus that you immune

33:46.400 --> 33:52.160
response to the virus that kills you and so you're begging the question why why would it do that and

33:52.160 --> 33:58.080
there was an article years ago in the annals let me just try to look at that let me just before

33:58.080 --> 34:04.400
he digs his hole any deeper let me just tell you how stupid that statement is how just absolutely

34:04.400 --> 34:10.960
asinine that statement is relative to what we've been trying to teach on this program

34:11.600 --> 34:17.760
this little show of ours i don't want to get too harsh here but man oh man i can't believe he just

34:17.760 --> 34:21.040
said that okay let me throw up my favorite slide in my deck

34:23.920 --> 34:28.240
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

34:28.240 --> 34:34.320
immune system is dumb why do i say that from a 30 000 foot perspective what i'm saying is is that

34:34.320 --> 34:41.520
the immune system is so impossibly complex that it's absolutely absurd that we have been led to believe

34:41.600 --> 34:48.720
allowed ourselves to be led to believe that pharmaceutical companies without liability

34:48.720 --> 34:54.800
under the protection of the 1986 vaccines act and the protection of an emergency decolared

34:54.800 --> 35:02.800
under the prep act that companies that are producing a lipid nanoparticle coated RNA

35:04.560 --> 35:08.000
know enough about our immune system to usefully augmented

35:08.240 --> 35:16.640
i think it's ridiculous to think that murk without liability really gives a darn about augmenting

35:16.640 --> 35:22.000
our kids immune system against measles mumps and rubella i don't think they care at all

35:24.880 --> 35:30.400
and i'm more i think they know that what they're doing is not really nearly as effective as it could

35:30.400 --> 35:36.000
be if they give a darn if it mattered to them if they were held to strict liability that product

35:36.000 --> 35:40.560
would work in a very different way it would be applied in a very different way it would be applied

35:40.560 --> 35:48.480
in a very different time and in a very different number of times that's the reality

35:52.160 --> 35:56.320
and so i say intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of

35:56.320 --> 36:02.560
augmenting the immune system is dumb to try and make the point that it's probably a very rare case

36:02.560 --> 36:08.320
in our history where the augmentation of the immune system has been done in a very clever

36:08.320 --> 36:12.560
and wow wonderful way when it's been done intramuscularly

36:15.440 --> 36:20.160
not talking about subcutaneous i'm not talking about

36:20.880 --> 36:27.120
variation i'm not talking about oral vaccines can argue all you want about that stuff that's

36:27.120 --> 36:33.600
at least augmenting the immune system at a barrier at the epithelial cells that are normally

36:33.600 --> 36:40.240
affected but once you put it intramuscularly all bets are off it's just dumb

36:41.600 --> 36:46.960
and you better have a darn good immunological explanation and mechanistic understanding of

36:46.960 --> 36:51.600
what you think's happening besides well we put this really toxic substance right next to these

36:51.600 --> 36:56.480
proteins and we hope the toxicity of the substance will be sufficient to attract the immune system

36:56.480 --> 36:59.840
so that it processes those proteins and then we'll have immunity

37:03.840 --> 37:10.160
we don't understand the immune system well enough to usefully augmented and certainly not by

37:10.160 --> 37:14.720
intramuscular injections so think about how funny it is what he says here

37:16.800 --> 37:22.560
question and they they posited that your body gives you a certain period of time to rid yourself

37:23.440 --> 37:27.920
on the immune system you know you could argue this is something that's always sort of perplexed me

37:27.920 --> 37:32.640
at some level it's your immune system that killed you it's not the virus it's your immune

37:32.640 --> 37:38.720
response to the virus it kills you and so and so what he's saying is that the immune system if it

37:38.720 --> 37:47.440
if it goes incorrectly can kill you if the immune system responds incorrectly it could kill you

37:48.320 --> 37:54.000
and so if my argument is correct we don't really know how to usefully augment the immune system

37:54.000 --> 37:59.600
and especially not with intramuscular injection of a combination of substances then why in the world

38:00.240 --> 38:07.840
what a guy who thinks it's kind of funny it's ironic that in the end it's not the the bugs that

38:07.840 --> 38:14.240
kill you it's not the virus that kills you it's the immune response to the virus that we would be so

38:14.320 --> 38:19.360
arrogant in our understanding to think that we could augment it with transfection

38:20.880 --> 38:28.400
expressing a viral protein with a chemically altered codon optimized version of this

38:30.800 --> 38:32.240
produced by bacteria

38:35.680 --> 38:37.520
spectacular arrogance

38:37.840 --> 38:45.600
spectacular arrogance that's based on spectacular arrogance that goes back decades

38:47.120 --> 38:52.400
all the way to when they said we're gonna you know sequence dogs and cats and and genomes

38:54.240 --> 38:59.760
and once we have all these genes you know it's just gonna be a we're it's gonna be a free for all

38:59.760 --> 39:05.600
how many things we're gonna fix and in ten years we'll be using retroviruses to cure childhood

39:05.600 --> 39:13.360
diseases it's all part of the same arrogance it's all part of the same illusion the same

39:13.360 --> 39:22.160
long list of promises made and not kept sales pitch is done by by a generation before this one

39:22.160 --> 39:27.440
by a postdoctoral generation before that one by a postdoctoral generation before that one

39:28.800 --> 39:34.560
writing grants making promises about where we'd be in ten years and why this needs to be done

39:34.640 --> 39:36.080
why this is so important

39:38.720 --> 39:44.240
and the predictions are always about a coming understanding a coming epiphany a coming breakthrough

39:44.960 --> 39:47.920
holy cow where's the breakthrough

39:50.080 --> 39:55.680
where is it where's the cure for cancer the cure for AIDS the cure for malaria where's the cure

39:58.000 --> 40:02.880
where are the cures for all the understanding of all these chronic diseases where is all this

40:03.520 --> 40:04.640
breakthrough happening

40:08.480 --> 40:09.440
where's the evidence

40:11.840 --> 40:14.640
is it all hidden away in the in the patent office

40:18.000 --> 40:26.240
is it all stored away in patents for methodologies at big tech companies pharmaceutical companies

40:26.240 --> 40:31.280
genetics companies sequencing company where where are these advances that are supposed to

40:31.280 --> 40:33.040
make everybody's life so much better

40:38.240 --> 40:42.320
what part of our health reflects this advancement

40:43.680 --> 40:49.520
what part of the the people that you see at target the people that you see at walmart the

40:49.520 --> 40:55.440
people that you see at the gas station what part of that reflects this advanced health care system

40:55.520 --> 40:58.880
of ours it's advanced understanding of our biology

41:02.080 --> 41:08.560
it's nowhere because there is no advanced understanding of our biology here he's he's admitting to it

41:09.440 --> 41:13.280
we don't really know how it works but eventually it's your immune system that kills you

41:14.160 --> 41:15.360
isn't that ironic

41:16.960 --> 41:21.920
begging the question why why would it do that and there was an article years ago in the

41:22.320 --> 41:26.400
internal medicine that sort of tried to look at that question and they they posited that

41:26.960 --> 41:32.400
your body gives you a certain period of time to rid yourself in this case of a virus and if

41:32.400 --> 41:38.560
you're losing then you sort of get culled from the herd so that you don't then affect other people

41:39.520 --> 41:46.160
so we now know that uh it's important look at his smile antiviral look at his smirk

41:46.160 --> 42:00.240
what is this 70 year old man smirking about what is that smirk for get culled from the herd

42:00.240 --> 42:06.160
so the virus and if you're losing then you should have get culled from the herd so that you don't

42:06.160 --> 42:11.120
then affect other people so what he's saying is is that if you don't fight off the virus then

42:11.200 --> 42:16.560
your immune system kills you so that you don't kill the rest of the herd that's what he just said

42:19.520 --> 42:25.040
it seems like a system it's kind of a system to make sure that you know if you're not good enough

42:25.040 --> 42:26.560
you get culled from the herd

42:29.280 --> 42:30.320
look at that face

42:30.640 --> 42:41.440
sorry but that looks like Carl from sling blade yeah i reckon i reckon he culled from the herd if

42:41.440 --> 42:44.640
you he can't find that virus i reckon you be dead

42:50.720 --> 42:55.600
i'm not down with this guy i don't like him i'm sorry i will admit that i don't like him but

42:55.600 --> 43:01.840
more importantly i don't like his message i don't the the commitment the absolutely

43:01.840 --> 43:05.040
spectacular commitment to what he knows our lies

43:10.960 --> 43:16.960
it's really like an unspoken thing they they they they probably never ever say it anymore

43:17.360 --> 43:27.200
but it is a criminal enterprise in america the fda the cdc and the vaccine schedule together

43:27.200 --> 43:39.760
are a criminal enterprise and if you believe that the children are the future then this is the the

43:39.760 --> 43:44.080
awakening that needs to occur as a result of the pandemic nothing else matters

43:47.840 --> 43:52.640
because if we take that out if we take that pillar out if we restore

43:54.240 --> 44:00.800
the 1986 vaccine act to its original form and then augment it to make it better

44:01.760 --> 44:10.400
and we wholly remove the prep acts to strike it from existence as unconstitutional we can rid

44:10.400 --> 44:16.480
ourselves of the who in one fell swoop we can step out of the un whenever we want to we can elect

44:16.480 --> 44:23.200
someone to do that separately but right now the pivotal moment in our history is this pivotal

44:23.200 --> 44:29.280
moment in our history is whether or not we realize that our vaccine schedule when compared to all

44:29.280 --> 44:34.800
other vaccine schedule is absurd and therefore criminal

44:40.560 --> 44:46.080
if your kid goes to school and he starts asking around and says hey how many how many times

44:46.080 --> 44:51.040
a date is your or how many times a week does your dad kick you in the head before bed

44:54.640 --> 44:59.200
and for him the answer is three times a week but for everybody else at school it's like dude my

44:59.200 --> 45:04.560
dad never kicks me in the head well that would be a pretty good sign that what your dad is doing to

45:04.560 --> 45:11.440
you every three or four nights a week is not necessarily very normal and if you compare the

45:11.520 --> 45:18.800
vaccine schedule for American children to the vaccine schedule in Norway or the Netherlands

45:19.440 --> 45:28.720
or Sweden or Spain or Greece Italy what do you find

45:31.840 --> 45:36.320
how many shots before six months how many shots before 64 hours

45:41.520 --> 45:46.080
now you look in closer and closer and closer and you will find that our children are treated

45:46.080 --> 45:51.040
in a way that no other children are treated in the western world

45:54.240 --> 45:59.040
and this man is involved intimately involved in that system for decades

46:00.400 --> 46:05.200
he should be retired but he can't retire because the secret is safe with him

46:05.200 --> 46:13.120
and the people that are coming up that don't understand are all they got they don't have

46:13.120 --> 46:18.400
anybody like him who knows and is willing to do what he's doing right here which is make that

46:18.400 --> 46:25.440
yeah I reckon that reckon face mm-hmm I like french ride taters

46:25.440 --> 46:37.840
oh my gosh it's just disturbing because this is the narrative this is the illusion

46:39.120 --> 46:47.760
so we now know that it's important to give antivirals early in infection to curtail the viral

46:47.840 --> 46:56.320
phase as you say so why even though he was seven days after testing so why are we discussing what

46:56.320 --> 47:01.440
happened with Donald Trump and why are we still going back to remdesivir he's still going back

47:01.440 --> 47:08.320
to the antiviral part of this this whole thing already pushing it back to remdesivir why did we

47:08.320 --> 47:15.440
give him antivirals after after seven days so again here we are we're stopping the train we're

47:15.440 --> 47:20.560
arguing about where we should stand in order to pull the train to a stop where we should chalk

47:20.560 --> 47:29.040
our hands up so that we can push it back going again and so it's this really interesting spell

47:29.040 --> 47:37.120
binding discussion about nothing what had been since again why did we do it after seven days if

47:37.120 --> 47:43.120
we know that we'd already know that antivirals don't work after the viral phase right the viral phase

47:43.680 --> 47:48.960
talking about it as if though it's some kind of textbook fidelity precision we know already

47:48.960 --> 47:55.600
now that the viral phase lasts between 72 and 75 hours and it generally starts in the upper

47:55.600 --> 48:01.520
lungs and blah blah blah they're getting ever more confident in their presentation about what

48:01.520 --> 48:11.600
they know about how this works and it's nonsense listen to this in infection to curtail the viral

48:11.680 --> 48:19.680
phase as you say so why even though he was seven days after testing positive why did they give

48:19.680 --> 48:24.960
him these the remdesivir and the monoclonal so late that's a great question and i think the

48:24.960 --> 48:29.200
answer is because we have very little experience with either of those products even the monoclonal

48:29.200 --> 48:34.880
antibody regeneran or the antiviral remdesivir neither which had been licensed or authorized yet

48:34.880 --> 48:39.760
so you didn't have much data in fact if you look at the early data with remdesivir

48:40.320 --> 48:44.480
one of the first hundred patients or so that was all in hospitalized patients i mean you would have

48:44.480 --> 48:48.880
argued that if you're going to use it you should use it early in people who are at highest risk

48:48.880 --> 48:53.040
of developing severe disease i.e. those people who have the kind of comorbidities that put

48:53.040 --> 48:56.880
them in high risk that's not the way those original studies were done the same thing for

48:56.880 --> 49:01.520
monoclonal antibodies that that's not the way those studies were done so you saw some benefit but

49:01.520 --> 49:07.520
a very mild benefit and so i think we learned as we go but people look at this they think you know

49:07.520 --> 49:12.160
here now we know i got to listen to that again because i've heard him say something silly you should

49:12.160 --> 49:17.680
use it early in people who are at highest risk of developing severe disease so he's arguing there

49:18.000 --> 49:26.400
that remdesivir should be used early

49:32.800 --> 49:38.560
on people at greatest risk

49:42.480 --> 49:46.400
so what does that mean does that mean that he wants to take people into the hospital and

49:46.400 --> 49:51.360
force them to get on an IV of remdesivir for a couple weeks to protect them from COVID

49:51.360 --> 49:58.080
is he kind of thinking like Steve Kirsch was on the Brett Weinstein podcast on June 11th 2021

49:58.080 --> 50:05.600
where he said that if we just forced everyone to take ivermectin and a fluvoxamine for 60 days

50:05.600 --> 50:11.280
that we would be ending the pandemic is that what he's basically saying that if we had done this

50:11.280 --> 50:15.040
we would have saved a bunch of people and if we had to put them on remdesivir we would have saved

50:15.120 --> 50:19.200
a bunch of people is that what he really said because i think that's what i just heard

50:19.760 --> 50:24.400
that's what i reckon i heard him just say we general honor the anti-viral remdesivir

50:24.400 --> 50:28.960
neither which had been licensed or authorized yet so you didn't have much data in fact if you

50:28.960 --> 50:34.480
look at the early data with remdesivir um one of the first hundred patients or so that was all

50:34.480 --> 50:38.160
in hospitalized patients i mean you would have argued that if you're going to use it you should

50:38.160 --> 50:43.200
use it early in people who are at highest risk of developing severe disease i.e. those people

50:43.280 --> 50:47.040
who have the kind of comorbidities that put them in high risk that's not the way those original

50:47.040 --> 50:51.520
studies were done i'll say the thing from monoclonal antibodies okay so what are we talking about

50:51.520 --> 50:57.520
the studies or how they actually should have been used remdesivir was used first on the sahomish

50:57.520 --> 51:04.880
county man the compassionate use of remdesivir was justified by a lot by the paper that was written

51:04.960 --> 51:13.360
by cena bivari and allis and totura in late 2000 or early 2019 about the broad spectrum antivirals

51:13.360 --> 51:17.920
and coronavirus pandemics in predicting every single thing about this narrative including the

51:17.920 --> 51:23.840
fact that remdesivir would be useful and here we are four and a half years later still talking

51:23.840 --> 51:30.960
about remdesivir being useful are you kidding me and then debating about well did it really help

51:31.040 --> 51:37.680
him and i didn't kill trump i guess huh and it wasn't regenerant we barely knew what we were

51:37.680 --> 51:42.240
doing with that stuff i mean you know i think joe really even gave joe rogan that stuff

51:44.880 --> 51:52.480
listen to the way these people talk so that you can hear how the narrative is still being protected

51:52.480 --> 51:57.680
and more importantly this train this train is still being stopped

51:57.680 --> 52:04.480
they are still pretending to discuss things that are relevant that are on this list

52:07.680 --> 52:09.120
that are on this list

52:11.840 --> 52:19.760
and it's crazy but they really are on this list with dexamethasone right here steroids they are

52:19.760 --> 52:26.160
on the list with dexamethasone they are on the list with ventilators and they are on the list

52:26.160 --> 52:35.440
with remdesivir there is not one inkling not one inkling of a hint

52:37.520 --> 52:42.480
in office voice or any of this discussion that remdesivir might have been a mistake

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
that remdesivir might have killed people

52:47.040 --> 52:52.000
that remdesivir might have been combined with other things to kill people there there is no

52:52.960 --> 53:00.640
no no no even not even a remote chance that that's ever going to come up in this discussion and

53:00.640 --> 53:05.600
quite frankly it's shocking if you think about it but it doesn't come up in very many other

53:05.600 --> 53:11.040
discussions either never mind the opioid epidemic that's gone crazy for the last three years never

53:11.040 --> 53:16.960
mind all of the other things that have gone crazy for the last three years never mind the horrible

53:17.840 --> 53:22.000
horrible things that we've done to our college kids over the last three years

53:22.000 --> 53:24.320
this guy's not going to talk about any of that

53:27.680 --> 53:34.560
he wants you to discuss trumps covid and what really happened during trumps covid

53:36.880 --> 53:42.880
I mean that's incredible that's not the way those studies were not said so you saw some benefit

53:42.880 --> 53:48.800
but a very mild benefit and so I think we learn as we go but people look at this they think you

53:48.800 --> 53:54.400
know here now we know that this is not these products the antiviral the monoclonal are not

53:54.400 --> 53:59.520
going to work well late notice so why did we do that because we learn as we go and I think that

53:59.520 --> 54:03.440
we're largely intolerant of that kind of learning curve it's interesting because

54:04.640 --> 54:09.520
we have a lot of experience with other viral infections we know you have to for influenza you

54:09.520 --> 54:16.960
have to give antivirals within 24 to 48 hours so this whole story during covid really was

54:16.960 --> 54:23.840
fascinating to me that we did clinical trials late in hospitalized patients before I don't

54:23.840 --> 54:29.760
understand why the the light didn't go on earlier I agree with you for me the thing it was much

54:29.760 --> 54:35.440
let's see this is also absorbing the narrative listen to the the the idea that Vincent Rancio's

54:35.440 --> 54:41.760
laughing I don't know why we did these clinical trials so late but of course that this is what

54:41.760 --> 54:47.760
I'm explaining this is what I'm really trying to emphasize with you they did these clinical trials

54:47.760 --> 54:55.600
so badly so that people could argue about them at the time and so that it would make sense for us

54:55.600 --> 55:00.560
to look back and go wow that was really crazy and it would be very easy for somebody like Paul to

55:00.560 --> 55:06.960
say yeah but we didn't know any better that's what we had to work with we were trying to keep

55:06.960 --> 55:11.920
people out of the hospital so that the disease wouldn't spread and we wouldn't get overwhelmed

55:12.560 --> 55:17.440
and so our priorities were different and we were thinking differently and so when we did the trials

55:17.440 --> 55:22.560
we only really had these severe cases to work with because everything else was at home and so

55:22.560 --> 55:27.280
these people were already ready to justify this they just weren't going to justify it two or three

55:27.280 --> 55:34.400
years ago they were going to justify it this year while two or three years ago people on our side

55:34.400 --> 55:40.960
were arguing about the validity of these claims now that the people on our side of Altman convinced

55:40.960 --> 55:44.800
that they're right about the validity of these claims it's time for these people to admit that

55:44.800 --> 55:51.920
some of these claims are right but we couldn't have known back then we didn't know anything back then

55:51.920 --> 55:57.920
and and Vince it makes it funny we knew this about influenza so it's crazy that we didn't know it

55:57.920 --> 56:04.080
about COVID but everybody at the CDC and everybody else was telling us that this was a novel virus

56:04.080 --> 56:10.080
that we knew nothing about and even Paul was telling us that we weren't sure whether we could

56:10.080 --> 56:18.560
build lasting meaningful natural immunity to a virus like this and people on the darkest parts

56:18.640 --> 56:23.440
of the internet were telling us that the spike protein was obviously an amyloidogenic

56:23.440 --> 56:30.320
prionogenic gain-of-function engineered protein tinkered to have parts of the HIV virus in it

56:30.320 --> 56:36.240
and so therefore therefore therefore we were in big trouble

56:39.680 --> 56:47.200
that's how this works look at that smile late in hospitalized patients before I don't understand

56:48.080 --> 56:53.120
why the light didn't go on earlier I agree with you for me the thing that was most upsetting in

56:53.120 --> 56:58.160
that year because that was a terrible year right 2020 I mean the virus came into this country early

56:58.160 --> 57:03.360
in 2020 at least at the first recorded death of sometime around the end of February of 2020

57:03.360 --> 57:07.200
and then a thousand people were dying a day two thousand people were dying a day three thousand

57:07.200 --> 57:11.600
people are dying we had we had two hundred thousand deaths by May we had five hundred thousand deaths

57:11.680 --> 57:18.400
in this country by December I mean we were helpless we had nothing again it was the the antivirals in

57:18.400 --> 57:25.040
October the the monoclonals in wow so he says that we had five hundred thousand deaths by the

57:25.040 --> 57:32.240
December 2020 that's I think that's the craziest number I've ever heard because we're supposed to

57:32.320 --> 57:40.400
have had a million dead at some point but five hundred thousand in 2020 is

57:43.680 --> 57:44.560
that's a lot that's a lot of people let me hear it again

57:44.560 --> 57:49.120
that's a lot of people let me hear it again thousand people were dying a day three thousand

57:49.120 --> 57:53.600
people were dying we and then a thousand people are dying a day two thousand people are dying

57:53.600 --> 57:57.520
a day three thousand people are dying we had we had two hundred thousand deaths by may we had

57:57.520 --> 58:02.880
500,000 deaths in this country by December. I mean, we were helpless. We had nothing.

58:03.520 --> 58:08.960
Again, it was the antivirals in October, the monoclonals in November, and not vaccines,

58:08.960 --> 58:14.560
not until December. So what did we do? We isolated, we quarantined, we masked, we tested.

58:14.560 --> 58:21.200
We wore bandanas, we isolated, we wore goggles in combination with bandanas. We talked about

58:21.200 --> 58:28.960
bushmeat. We got really everybody fired up about the secret formula of prophylactic ivermectin.

58:31.360 --> 58:38.480
Isn't that what you guys were doing? I thought, you know, Alexandros Maranos thought he didn't

58:38.480 --> 58:44.240
really tell anybody this, but in retrospect, it makes a lot of sense that during an emergency,

58:44.240 --> 58:49.040
if you don't have principles, then you don't have principles ever. And it only matters if you

58:49.040 --> 58:55.200
have principles in an emergency. He never really told anybody that, and he didn't have principles

58:55.200 --> 59:02.240
during it, but if he worked it out later, then the right thing would have been to have principles

59:02.240 --> 59:08.880
during the emergency. And so I'm not blaming anybody for giving up their principles because

59:09.440 --> 59:16.240
these people were brutal, and they had us before the pandemic already. We didn't even really know it.

59:17.200 --> 59:23.040
But what I find very frustrating is the people who are doubling down and tripling down on this idea

59:23.040 --> 59:28.400
that we need to be governed by this mythology, that they won't either won't see through it or,

59:28.400 --> 59:35.360
more importantly, are very happy not to see through it for their overlords, for their slavers that they work for,

59:35.360 --> 59:38.480
whoever it is that they've decided to sell their soul to.

59:38.480 --> 59:52.080
I've given my soul to my wife, if there was anything to give, and a long, long, long, long, long, long,

59:52.080 --> 59:56.240
long, long, long, long, long, long time ago, when I was a very little kid, I already gave my soul to God.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:03.040
So I know exactly what I'm fighting for.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:12.000
And I'm totally fine with whatever anybody, however anybody made their hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.240
I'm all fine with it. I don't care, Paul,

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.920
but I do care if my kids grow up thinking that that's not that that's an okay guy.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:31.200
I do care if my the college kids grow up thinking that this is an okay guy,

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.320
the college kids grow up thinking that that these technologies are high fidelity,

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.480
that these ideas are well understood, that these concepts are well founded.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.040
We can't let that happen.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.680
We're never going to be able to change the mind of somebody who's been in this field for 35 years.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.080
We're never going to be able to change the mind of somebody who's millions of dollars

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:00.080
are dependent on these ideas remaining intact. We're never going to change their mind. And in fact,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.080
the more that there are hundreds of millions of dollars are dependent on this mythology,

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.040
the more likely they are to behave irrationally, the more likely they are to call you something

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.240
like chemtrail retarded, the more likely they are to be connected to people like Mitt Romney

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.800
through their business, the more likely they are to connect to Tom Ridge through their business,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.440
the more likely they are to be connected to health and human services contracts for pathogen tests,

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.280
the more likely they are to be connected to anything to do with this biotechnology,

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.880
biosecurity state that we are being ushered into that started all the way back in the

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:50.080
special cancer virus program, transitioned into the HIV stuff, transitioned into the human genome

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:58.080
project. It's all one continuous line of parallel investigation between biotechnology and bioweaponary

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:05.120
and biosecurity technology. Trying to crack the human genome has been our goal for a very, very

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:12.800
long time. And we've needed to have the computing power and the sampling power and the algorithmic

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.920
power and the sequencing capabilities in order to even attempt to get to the starting gates.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.640
And this guy's been around for a long time, probably not involved in that stuff, but involved

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:37.920
in the security measure control measures that is public health. 25 years he's been working on

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:48.640
vaccines like a rotavirus vaccine. Really? Really? I mean, really?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:02.160
I'm just tired of the fake altruism. I'm tired of the fake sainthood. I'm tired of the the fake

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.640
respect and love for the sacred. I'm tired of the fake reverence. There's no reverence here.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.520
There's no reverence in many of the people that I oppose.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.840
And that's the part that I find most frustrating. You know, you look at a guy like Jim Thorpe,

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.760
you know, he might be wrong about some of the biology. He might be deceived by a lot of these

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.840
people because his details and his biological understanding are not really there. But man,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.360
oh man, does that guy have an appreciation for the sacred? As a man has been taking care of

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.160
pregnant women and birthing babies his whole life, the guy knows what sacred is.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.760
And so he's a very dangerous card in this deck too because if he starts to figure out what we know,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.280
he could be incredibly dangerous because he will be able to express that reverence for the

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.400
sacred in a way that few others can. And right now they have him pretty well locked into the idea

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.800
that there was a novel virus that really meant something to lots and lots and millions of people

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:15.360
like he just said. 500,000 people in a year were killed by the coronavirus according to Paul Offit

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:27.120
today. 500,000 people in United States in a year. Wow. Where are the bodies? That's a really

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.920
big stadium full of bodies, like a really big stadium full of bodies.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.880
All right, let's listen to the rest. I gotta do a bit.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.400
It's fantastic. We shuttered schools. We closed businesses. We restricted travel. That's all we

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.920
could do was try and limit human human interaction for a virus. It was transmitted largely asymptomatically.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.960
We were stuck. But the thing that upsets me the most was the convalescent sera

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.280
because we hadn't expanded. I wanted to just point out something in a textbook I was reading

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.760
today. I just thought it would be kind of cool now that he says that particular thing.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.400
I wonder if you would allow me to read a little bit of a textbook for you today.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.960
I don't know if I'm going to be able to find this thing right away. Let me see.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.480
Where was this part? Maybe I have to look it up by that number letter.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:41.680
I almost saw it, including there, Nate, there, Nate. Oh man, where am I going to find it? Am I

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:47.360
going to be able to find it? I gotta look up this one. Okay, I'll just, I'll look it up. Hold

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:58.000
out. I'm going to find it. What did it say? Control F and I don't want that one.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.840
Okay, look for that one. Okay, and that.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:18.800
Let me see. Come on, Jay. You had it all tagged out and now I don't have it tagged out anymore.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.960
Maybe I have to open the other one. Did I save the other one?

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.000
That's the huge PDF. I don't have the small PDF. So I have a whole, it's a whole book. It's

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.280
28 chapters and I'm looking at the coronavirus chapter and there was a part in the coronavirus

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:47.120
chapter. Might be at the top here. This is coronavirus, right? It's 28, 20, I just do. I'm

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.400
going to wait too far. Okay, I'm going to move it over here so you can see what I'm doing. This is

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:58.240
probably really annoying. Here we go. This is a PDF. I'm going to get to chapter 28 here.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.840
How did I get so far away? What is this?

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:30.160
Well, come on. Really? I didn't mean to get this far. Here we go. Okay. This is coronavirus.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:37.680
What it says here, maybe I have to go up this far. So first of all, they've got the clones in here

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.720
that we can talk about a little bit and how they're made. They talk a lot about how it's done. They

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:51.600
talk about why it's necessary and why it's so handy. There's a prevalence thing in here somewhere

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.400
where I read, which I thought was really cool. It's said that

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:09.360
look at this. The remaining four just listen, I mean, just get this. The remaining four human

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:16.960
coronaviruses, the alpha coronaviruses, human coronavirus 229E and NL 63 and the beta coronaviruses, OC 43

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.440
and HKU 1 typically cause common colds. Remarkably,

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.760
human coronavirus NL 63 and human coronavirus HKU were only discovered recently in the post

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.880
SARS era despite the fact that each has a worldwide prevalence and has been in circulation for a

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:49.040
long time. So how would we differentiate between a novel spreading pathogen and a pathogen that

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.560
already had previous indemnicity that was already in the background that we didn't even notice that

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:02.080
we didn't even detect until recently? And how would we know how many of these viruses had been

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.440
detected in the background as part of a compliment of RNA signals that are just there all the time

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.200
that we still really haven't been able to get a good solid read on because people like Nathan

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.600
Wolf of Tonus said it's just like a dark matter of life down there, dark matter of DNA and RNA,

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:27.280
genetic noise inside of which are hidden new life forms. How do we know that they haven't

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:34.480
hyper characterized that whole background signal at that size scale? Just like that says right there

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:40.320
that these viruses were there in the background. Did I spin it out of control and lose it?

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.000
Remarkably, they were only discovered recently despite the fact that each has a worldwide prevalence.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:10:00.000
Well, how could something have a worldwide prevalence in us not know it? How many more things could

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.880
be have a worldwide prevalence, but we wouldn't have known because we just didn't pay attention

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.760
because we have common colds all the time. How many of them are enteric viruses that work in our

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.480
guts that we never notice because a little diarrhea is not a big deal in America where half the time

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.360
you're eating from fast food or restaurants, right? Hello? So how would you know if you had

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:33.760
an entera virus that was a coronavirus and how would you really know? I mean, if you're drinking

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.440
five nights a week after work, you're drinking lots of coffee during the day, I don't know what you do,

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.320
I don't know what you eat, but how many people would ever think that, wow, maybe I have a little gut

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:51.440
virus. Maybe I have a a phage working in my microbiome. Maybe that's why I have diarrhea.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:59.040
Nobody ever thinks that. And yet here's a here's a whole here's a whole chapter about how half of

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.600
the coronaviruses in the world are actually gut coronaviruses. They replicate in the gut

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:12.960
endothelium and epithelium rather, not not in the skin, not not in the in the lungs, but in the gut

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.760
because there's a lot of there's a lot of epithelium there too.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.880
And now this this whole chapter has all kinds of hidden gems in it, all kinds of hidden gems

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:31.680
which make it very obvious that what what has been done in this argument is a confounding

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.680
where they claim such a high fidelity of understanding of coronavirus and a high fidelity

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.600
understanding of everything at this size scale with regard to DNA and RNA as pathogenic as

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:53.440
external signals. And they have been lying about it for decades, even as their understanding has

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.680
ever expanded into also this size scale, including all kinds, maybe even a predominance of endogenous

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:08.560
signaling. We don't care because the public health mythology under which we are intended to be

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.160
governed has no room for those signals has no room for that biology.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:23.600
We are going to be exclusively taught the biology of of correlates of immunity, the biology of

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:34.720
vaccines being a a a masterwork of human ingenuity and the literal cutting edge of of evidence so

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.360
evidential understanding of how our body works and it's an absolute absurdity.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.080
But that's what we're teaching our kids that's what we're teaching our kids in in medical school.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.840
So it is it is a red alert situation right now and Paul Offit is the great example of it where

01:12:51.840 --> 01:13:01.040
they have this really beyond retirement age person selling what should have been already a retired

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.480
version of immunology from a bygone era.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.600
And that's why they have him and Vincent still selling it. There are no young people who can

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.200
understand this in a coherent way. They need people like this to keep them on track,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.640
otherwise they will eventually reason their way out of it just like we did.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:31.280
Access program for that people did give that give generously I think it's one of the many

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.240
bright lights of this pandemic people were perfectly willing to give their blood and serum to help

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.800
others but we didn't do those studies the right way that original Mayo Clinic receiving study was

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.000
in hospitalized patients. There's no reason we couldn't have done that done that earlier and the

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.200
estimates are that we probably would have saved at least 20 to 30,000 lives early on.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.720
Hopefully the next pandemic will remember that you know.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.720
I hope so. The next pandemic. So I'm actually impressed that his physicians gave him dexamethasone.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.640
So what were they thinking for? Right. The thinking was let's suppress his immune system.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.720
And you know it's a slippery slope because on the one hand it is your immune system

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.760
that saves you in the sense, right? I mean antibodies you know prevent virus cell binding,

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.000
antibodies were made by B cells. The T cells T helper cells help B cells make antibodies

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.440
and then cytotoxic T cells which also respond fairly rapidly and well when you're severely ill.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.480
Also kill virus infected cells. And so that's something that he didn't say in 2020.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.800
Nobody on his team even in 2021 was talking about cytotoxic T cells.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.200
And in fact I think I did my first real twib presentation about him saying the cytotoxic T cells

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:59.600
were most important in 2022. After I'd been teaching it for two years because why was I teaching it?

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:09.360
Because Stanley Perlman really is his seminal papers in 2003 and five after the SARS outbreak

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.040
were papers that demonstrated that T cells and cytotoxic T cells aimed at conserved regions.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:24.400
The end protein and and open reading frame one A were the site though the cells that were important

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:32.320
in my surviving a laboratory infection of SARS and without those T cells antibodies didn't matter.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.200
Stanley Perlman the guy who sat on the who's committee on coronavirus Stanley Perlman is the

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.800
the elder statesman of coronavirus in America and that guy never ever ever talks about this stuff

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:55.040
because he is intimately aware that the immunology has been wholly misrepresented inverted as though

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.560
antibodies are first when antibodies are last and he knows that he's in he's a sufficiently

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:08.080
well well studied coronavirus biologist that he understands the immunology he did the T cell

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.560
studies. That's probably why Stanley's not involved in this stuff because Stanley's own

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.880
research shows that they're immune correlate their correlate of immunity antibodies is irrelevant

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:29.520
and couldn't save the mice in any of his papers so here we are again absorbing a little bit or at

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.320
least turning around and saying yeah I always said that of course their response of course T cells

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:42.240
are important but he still said it in the wrong order he still told you antibodies before B cells

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:49.280
before T cells and then finally he said cytotoxic T cells even though cytotoxic T cells are

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.200
activated pretty early in the chain and definitely earlier than B cells because B cells need the

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:02.000
circulation of the antigen that activates them before T cells can help them to get fully activated

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:10.320
and go into plasma division plasma cell divisions. This is the linked recognition part that we covered

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.800
again already three years ago many many many many many times for a year and a half

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:22.720
to try and explain how the basic immune system works the basic immune response to an antigen

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.440
set works because that's pretty darn important it's much more important than saying amyloid and

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:36.560
prion over and over again and pointing at little sections of the spike protein saying that this

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.120
program or that program says that these sequences are amyloidogenic

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.640
without ever doing any experiment at all you know something really easy like let's say

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.200
make a synthetic spike protein without those sequences in it because that's pretty easy to do

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.920
and then do the same experiment with the spike protein getting transfected in cell culture

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.040
and show me there's nothing like you showed in the other culture but they don't do those kinds

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.640
of experiments here we don't do control experiments here

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.600
because control experiments would reveal the fraud

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:24.720
so we don't do controls on vaccines and we hide behind ethics we don't can do controls on the

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:34.880
transfection because we hide behind ethics and they paid people they encouraged people to come

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:41.280
out and talk about how bad the spike protein was how it was evidence of a laboratory pathogen how

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:50.160
hey fear and cleavage site is just so so freaking important so important is the spike protein so

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.880
so very important

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.120
oh i closed it sorry but in that same in that same

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:14.160
chapter number 28 in fields virology sixth edition where you can find all kinds of discussion about

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.440
how important it is that they finally learned how to make infectious material using DNA clones

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.360
how it's revolutionized the study of RNA viruses and coronaviruses in particular

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.680
there's a couple different paragraphs about how it's very common in several different sub-families

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:39.520
for there to be an s1 s2 junction that's cleavable by a fear and like cleavage fear and like protease

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:47.600
now it may be true that in this particular group of coronaviruses like SARS coronaviruses given

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.360
their genetic classification scheme have never shown a fear and cleavage site but the idea that

01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:04.800
it's odd the idea that it's crazy in that book in that book there are 815 different references

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:11.360
to fear and proteases fear and proteases are important in so many different viruses it's actually

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.280
kind of absurd to think that you would ever argue that a fear and cleavage site in a coronavirus is

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:25.120
definitely an indication of a of a lab leak

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.040
what's really absurd is the people who said it at the beginning of 2020

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.080
wasn't virologists it wasn't innocent virologists all around the world

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.760
it was weirdos

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.720
it was people that had no business knowing that

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:51.760
people that are now messing with with families that were that that that lost a member of their family to

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.680
remdesivir are being messed with and manipulated by people who at the very beginning somehow knew

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.520
that the spike protein and its fear and cleavage site was a real big thing to talk about

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:09.040
some people were absolutely convinced that the fear and cleavage site of the spike protein was

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:15.920
the thing to talk about from february 2020 onward and they didn't talk about anything else

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.080
it's not that i think that luke montenier is wrong he was shown the sequence and said well

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.480
that sequence was obviously made on a keyboard made in a laboratory designed exactly the way

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.760
they wanted it to and he was already aware that they could use just PCR they could just kind of print

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:40.640
it we have that technology we can make it that's why there was a process one in a process two and

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.360
they're now making a big deal about the fact that process one would have been a lot cleaner than

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:52.560
process two these aren't surprising things these are things that kevin mccurnan knew from the very

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:57.360
beginning could have known from the very beginning has known from the very beginning brought out

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.440
incrementally from the very beginning that's why he was on my podcast twice

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.960
because he kept bringing it out a little more letting a little more out trying to give a

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.200
little bit more rope hoping that's all i would need so that i would shut up and stop looking

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.320
into this anymore and focus on the fact that the shots were going to hurt people because the

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.560
RNA wasn't pure and eventually oh my gosh there's DNA in it too

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:29.360
and maybe they could finally get me off the idea that transfection by itself in its

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:37.520
purest form is really really dumb for healthy humans maybe they could just keep me focused on

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.080
the spike protein and gain a function long enough so that they could get this through

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.080
and that that i would get in the book and then i would just shut my mouth and take the fame

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:53.200
but no they were wrong i decided to shoot myself in the foot admit that i got it wrong and admit

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.440
that i was trying to get it in the book but i couldn't get it in the book because it was too

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.560
late and when i figured it out it just didn't it didn't work that that's not the narrative

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.680
they want to tell they didn't want to end the book with but it's all a lie

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.840
or don't don't forget that you have to consider that it's all a lie that's in there and it's a

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.840
quote from me that they wouldn't even need a virus anymore to do this and they didn't need

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:28.880
a virus in 2020 because as the book fields of virology in the chapter written by Stanley

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.880
Perlman chapter 28 there is a sentence that says remarkably these two coronaviruses were

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:45.360
discovered after SARS even though they have a worldwide prevalence and have been in circulation

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:55.840
for a long time so just the insistence alone that Paul Offit would make that Kevin McCurnan would

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:02.880
make that this virus wasn't around until 2019 and it's just a matter of how early did it come out

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:11.760
so that we can explain some of this phylogeny that is wrong we have evidence in the virology

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.360
textbooks that tell us that there are coronaviruses in circulation that we were never aware of that

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.640
we never found that we never tracked that have always been there that have a worldwide prevalence

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.480
and Kevin McCurnan himself admitted it in a stream with me that all we had to really do is

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.880
turn on the PCR and we would have seen patterns of viruses moving through the population and so

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:44.080
that's what we did you can't discount that that's what we did you can't discount that that's what we

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:50.480
did then you look in his blog and you will see that he's talking about how this is not a blog about

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.440
whether or not the pandemic was more significant than the pandemic or whether the iatrogenic murder

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:04.160
was more significant than the the virus this is about clones and about the swarm

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:11.040
because he knows that that discussion is a losing discussion that discussion is a losing discussion

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.880
because it involves doing this math that i keep telling you none of these people will ever do

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.000
they won't do this math here

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:29.280
do you think that that that that we're ever going to do this math with Kevin McCurnan

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.120
i mean he's gonna he's gonna wave away the idea that no i mean yeah but there was def i mean

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:46.560
there's 15 million sequences that he says prove that there was a novel virus that millions of

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.640
people died from and millions more were saved from and probably came from gain of function

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:58.240
because clones can spread forever or clones can spread or do the same thing that natural viruses

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.400
do i guess is his argument and since there's no swarm because the swarm is pretty high fidelity

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.160
then Jay's argument about clones is wrong and that they don't end up not even related to each other

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.880
if i find four coronavirus textbooks behind me that say that coronaviruses are high enough

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:22.080
fidelity so that the quasi-species swarm is just a theory that's never been confirmed

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.200
it's not going to change my mind about the fact that clones are a really really really really

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:34.240
easy handy proven existing way already existing for many many years maybe even decades

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.280
of getting the same sequence in the same and multiple places at the same time

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.720
which whether you like it or not whether Kevin McCurnan Karen or Kevin McCurnan like it or not

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.360
that is the basis of the pandemic the basis of the pandemic is simultaneous molecular signals

01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.920
around the world that confirmed or conformed to the virus signal that was purported to be found in

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.880
Wuhan they sequenced the guy in Washington state and said that it was a sequence that was exactly

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.160
the same as the one in Wuhan therefore ergo pandemic started

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.760
that's how that worked

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:28.160
and you'll find other examples that are the same thing they justify this is further evidence that

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:35.920
a pandemic is underway and how would we differentiate that between that and HKU1 turning on the

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.560
testing we couldn't just like Kevin McCurnan or Kevin McCurnan admitted we couldn't that's

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.800
exactly what we could have done that's exactly what we probably did the only question is did we use

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.960
clones to make the signal stronger did we use the clones to to craft the signal to push it around

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.640
to amplify it to have it show up in a couple places to make an excuse to orchestrate mass

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.600
casualty events and to put the military wherever those sequences showed up I don't know

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.280
but we definitely need to ask all those questions we definitely need to ask all those questions

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.640
because these people are going to make it until they're going to keep going until the live becomes

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:27.120
the truth so when you give steroids you're suppressing the immune system and so so there is

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.760
that sort of double-edged sword there but they did give that that's not which saved his life

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.280
I don't think that's what Dr. Dr. I don't think that's what former president Trump thought saved

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.520
his life I think he said he thought it was the Regeneron but it was a that that's a method

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.320
of theory you had these two products which were not and so there he's serious he's totally dead

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:53.440
serious it wasn't remdesivir it wasn't the monoclonal Regeneron it was actually dexamethasone

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:59.440
and so here we are four years into this discussion we're not talking about the fact that he also

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.840
took hydroxychloroquine I believe and so that will be something that behind the scenes we're

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.880
supposed to argue about hey wait a minute I thought I thought Donald Trump was on hydroxychloroquine

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.200
I think that that that they're covering that up I bet they're covering that up you know

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.200
Stephen Hadfield's writing a book about that I'm sure that they're covering that up it was

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:24.560
probably hydroxychloroquine that would be the ideal response from the perspective of the narrative

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:30.800
controllers for us to think we're extra clever for seeing this one thing that wasn't there this

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:37.360
is part of the Scooby-Doo as well following the fake footprints following the fake set of clues

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.960
and adding it up to the come to the conclusion that they want us to come to

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.120
where is the discussion about the antibiotics when the very first thing that he admitted was

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:55.040
Trump had severe pneumonia they Trump had severe pneumonia that they treated with remdesivir

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.160
Henry Genaron

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.720
and dexamethasone

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.800
think about that

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:13.040
liars quite yet authorized but you had another product which was available since 1957

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:18.080
that ultimately probably saved his life so even though the use of decks in

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:24.960
covid was not very uh established the physicians knew from other infections that it could be useful

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:31.520
right exactly and it is it universally suppresses your immune system it suppresses all aspects of

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:37.200
your immune system B cells T cells neutrophils all aspects of your immune system would say blunt

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:43.360
instrument if you will but in this case an effective one and so if they had given it to him early that

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.160
would have been bad right exactly because early you want you know what that's right

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:54.080
Vilma that is right they were on video laughing about how dexamethasone was killing people you

01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:01.680
are right wow that's a really good catch thank you very much for that that's a really good catch

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.720
i need to find that video again because you're totally right about that

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.000
come on dumpin

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.960
yeah they were really laughing about that wow we're so glad you remembered that that is crazy indeed

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:37.600
that is crazy viral replication is king king um you want to be able to make antibodies you

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.600
want to be able to make you know T cells that you know kill virus affected cells and i think

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.120
the degree that you suppress that is the degree which you only allow viral replication to continue

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:54.960
massively now if president trump were to be infected today test positive what what should

01:31:55.040 --> 01:32:00.800
be done so if former president trump were infected today i think what what he should do

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:07.680
because he is he's older he's now 77 he is um he's overweight he should take pax lobin as soon

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:13.360
as he knows that he's infected personal he should he should test immediately if he has respiratory

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:19.120
symptoms and if he's if he's coven positive he should treat himself with pax lobin and so that

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.320
would need he would need to take pax lobed what within the first five days of testing is that the

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:30.400
guidance yes and the preferably in the first three days yes right now as you know very well

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:36.880
there's a lot of backlash against pax lobin there's this idea that somehow it's involved in

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:42.000
what's been called rebound which is no nothing other than the inflammatory phase of the infection

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.880
so do you think that his his physicians would be immune to that uh that that bias i hope we've

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.280
learned enough now to realize that as you move into the second stage of illness and your immune

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.440
system starts to take over and then your symptoms works and that that's what's happening when you

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.080
when you finish your course of pax lobin you're just entering your second stage of illness um

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.880
there is no such thing as pax lobin rebound there's you can call it coven rebound but it's not even

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:11.520
rebound really you're just moving into that second stage of illness i hope we we've uh put

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:16.240
an end to that i think with where pax lobin um where we suffered with pax lobin because there are

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.960
a lot of people who are admitted to the hospital and a lot of people who die who whose deaths could

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.040
have been prevented by treating early so i think one is what you said this sort of

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.920
fear of this false notion of pax lobin rebound but the others pax lobin does have many drug

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.200
drug interactions and i think for for some physicians they think you know let's just just

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.120
forget it there's all these drug drug interactions but it's always a matter of relative risk and

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.640
is it okay to stop one of those drugs for a few days while you're taking you know pax lobin because

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.680
pax lobin was going to have a greater chance of saving your life and stopping those drugs would

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:55.920
cause you to to die so i think we're not in that way relative risk or benefits because i think

01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:02.080
there are a lot of that is just spectacular he is actually advocating for pausing other

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:11.280
perhaps effective medications useful medications addictive or or medications that their bodies

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:18.400
are used to for a short period of time in order to take pax lobin to avoid drug and drug to drug

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:25.680
interactions with it well that's just that's just hilarious because that's also just making

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:31.760
this spectacular assumption that you know i'm taking pills i'll just stop taking those pills and

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.960
then they're really gone from my body and and then i can take some other pills that if they combine

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.920
those two pills at the same time they'd be really scary but if i just stop taking one pill and

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.840
start taking the other pill and then stop taking that pill and start taking the other pill again

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.440
everything will be fine and it makes perfect sense to paul to to kind of just generally

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.320
recommend that to all the doctors that are listening if you're if your patients are on

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:01.760
regular medication or medication for a sick condition but then they get covid you need to

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:07.200
really consider very carefully whether or not covid plus their old medication is going to be

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:13.920
more deadly than covid plus pax lobin and not their old medication can you imagine can you

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.800
imagine the absolutely spectacular arrogance that this vaccine salesman

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:29.280
wow wow people whom you could stop a drug for a few days while you're giving pax lobin and we

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:36.720
don't do that it's interesting you wrote a few columns on how the words can be misleading right

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.360
and i think rebound is the wrong word in this case it's not rebound implies that there's a

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.960
recurrence of replication but that's not the case at all right right not at all and and we

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:54.560
did contribute to that i don't remember early on uh dr faltry had taken pax lobin and then had you

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.640
know as he moved into the second phase of illness started to have more symptoms um he then took

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.680
a second course of pax lobin pax lobin later in his illness which sent in many ways the false message

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.760
that um continued viral replication was the problem when the problem was really an

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.480
increase in his immune response and so that second course of pax lobin probably did little

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.320
to nothing for him but this still happens i mean i was on service a couple weeks ago and

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.600
you know we had a patient who was 10 days into illness and still you know the instinct was

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:29.280
to start an antiviral even though at that point there was probably very that the viral replication

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.680
was really not a critical part of the pathogenesis for the illness anymore i think rebound is

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.680
unfortunate for reasons you said and it seems to be i mean so much of this is in there

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.160
imagination right like jeffrey said if you just believe it then you just believe it and when

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:53.280
they're talking about viral replication with with i would guess all absolutely all of the patients

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.840
that he's ever worked on he's never had look at that that that french fried tater face he's got

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:10.080
there that that he's never had a time course of viral load measured by anything molecular

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:17.200
biologically meaningful nothing that could give you a real quantification of viral load he's just

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.880
going on the cartoon brochure that he was handed all those many years ago about how this works

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.440
and going by the cartoon brochure that they handed out at the beginning of the pandemic because

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:35.280
there are no ways of measuring the up and down of of the viral load except for with regular QPCR

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.680
and then you would need to use nested primers and you'd need to target something that was really

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.600
designed specifically for the virus that had infected that person and the expected variation

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:51.760
in the swarm that would be present so you'd want to pick some pretty clever primers that weren't

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.320
designed by the who they weren't designed by some private company or aren't proprietary

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.640
information and then you'd want to design a nested primer pair

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:10.480
and then you'd want to monitor on a daily basis maybe even multiple samples done in

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:16.080
triplicate from three different places in the body like let's say the the throat and the nasal cavity

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:24.080
in the saliva and then show me somebody who's not sick that you measure from at the same time in

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:30.720
parallel and then maybe I'll believe that you know something about the onset of and the peaking of

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.120
the viral copy load or the RNA levels of a person that is expressing this kind of pathogen

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.960
but just like the no virus people I am firmly on this area where these people are talking about

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.680
something they don't have information about they don't have data for they are just making

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:55.120
gigantic assumptions based on a cartoon brochure that they themselves have never done experiments

01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.560
to validate they've done experiments that they've been told validate the cartoon but they don't

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.040
validate the cartoon you see that's also something

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:14.480
that's very hard to explain but you know it really is one of those things where

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.280
a clever mechanic could tell you all about how your car works and never give you any information

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:28.560
at all a very clever mechanic could tell you even hours of information about your car and

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.040
never give you any information at all but an extremely clever mechanic could give you that

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:39.200
same presentation and give you information that would actually raise the amount of money

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.080
that he could charge you for the repairs that would inevitably result a very clever mechanic

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.960
could make you think that he was a very good mechanic while at the same time creating problems

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.920
that otherwise wouldn't be there or maybe even helping having you create the problems that he

01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.760
needs in order to run his business a very clever mechanic would know how to get repeat service

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.800
a very clever mechanic is never going to tell you that changing your oil

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:13.200
or never going to tell you that your car should not burn oil

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.960
even though we know that in the 80s in the 90s we all had cars that didn't burn oil

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:27.120
I had a Chevy citation that would never lose a drop of oil the oil would change color and turn

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.960
black but it would always be at the same place on the dipstick

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:41.040
and so these people because the immune system is complicated because our understanding of it is

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:48.400
unsophisticated and because the information is purposefully not very available these people

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:54.160
have been has been misleading us about how our immune system works and how they can protect us from

01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.400
how we need protection from mother nature and they've been doing it for generations

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:07.120
that's the that's the wake-up stage that we're at here and Paul Offit has been doing it for his

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.560
entire career and that's why his face looks the way it looks because he should be retired

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.600
he's lied more than than anyone else should lie about children

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:30.480
and it has a toll it has a cost that's what you see here with us because people mention it all

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:36.880
the time and I think once a word like that gets into circulation it's very hard to pull it out

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:44.160
I think that's exactly right all right we'll put a link to this column in the show notes

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.800
and you can read more about it that's beyond the noise with Dr. Paul Offit thank you Paul

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:59.200
thank you it must be very hard to live in a world where you pretend to or really believe that

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.480
everyone around you is kind of an idiot and that a good portion of the people that you meet every day

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.280
think that you're a charlatan it must be a very very hard life to live where the two responses

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:22.800
that you get from people are either absolute hatred and disgust or a sort of obviously obscene

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:30.720
worship that you yourself know you're not worthy of what I what I absolutely awful space to occupy

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.720
but that's what happens when you

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.080
choose to lie for a living then that's all that you get back from the universe just lies

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.360
because the universe is kind of a mirror right it's an echo chamber of sorts

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:54.240
and so I'm really hopeful that the work that we're doing here is something that will

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.440
echo with you and your friends that will echo in a way that that benefits you that gives you hope

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:09.200
for the future that that that they are so out on a limb now that that the absurdity that you hear

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.640
when they talk is it's just so obvious it's patently obvious that they are out on a limb and so we

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:20.320
just have to keep pushing and I know that I've been promising for a while now but we don't want to

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:26.960
we don't want to we don't need to rush at this stage okay there there they are

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.080
the udoh throw that we do now that we already have them off balance we have our hands in the

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.480
right place we have our feet firmly planted on the ground and they are off balance so

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.000
it's just really a question of when do we want their head to hit the floor

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.960
and I want to make sure that when it hits the floor they don't get up again and so over the

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.720
next couple weeks we're still going to be doing some preparing I did get a little tiny consulting

01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.400
gig in the background that I think is also a really important work but it will also put a

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.640
little extra money in circulation in the house for a little while and that's really a blessing

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:11.360
and I'm very thankful for it but that doesn't mean that I still am not on a mad recruit for

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.240
subscribers and so I know that most of the people that are watching right now are probably already

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:22.400
subscribed you've already seen that I have a sub stack and if you have subscribed on my website

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.320
you should have already seen that you've been given a lifetime subscription to that sub stack

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.480
a paid subscription so you get all the there's never going to be anything behind a paywall but

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.320
that's how a sub stack works and if you want to you of course you can also subscribe to sub stack

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.360
but I don't I'm not encouraging anybody to do that I just want to give as many opportunities to

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:47.760
support as possible and I don't want anybody to give more than they can I do believe that this

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.680
work is important for thousands and thousands of people to see and that means that there's lots and

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.280
lots of of people that have enough money to support that can do it and all we got to do is find them

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.240
because I do think that this is priceless information it's priceless work we're doing

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:10.400
and much more important the stuff that's to come the virology that's to come the lessons that are

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:16.320
to come are going to be the lessons that kind of once and for all build a bridge I believe between

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.720
the no virus people and the virus people the people that just want to know the truth I really

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.440
hope that at some point we're going to be there's going to be a lot of new friendships that are made

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.880
as a result of us all collectively coming together and understanding that somehow we all got fooled

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:39.280
we all got fooled on every part no one had it right and even when we were we thought we were doing

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.040
it right there was somebody in front of us or somebody uh making it difficult for other people

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.520
to understand us as well as we could have been understood in my case I've had people like Kevin

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:54.720
McCarron and Kevin McCurnan constantly trying to pretend as though they don't understand

01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.320
or trying to pigeonhole me into one particular explanation or another and then claiming at some

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.240
point that I'm being a chameleon or I'm changing my arguments all the time when we you know if

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.240
you've been here long you know that we've always been saying that this is about expanding the

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:17.040
possibility space expanding the the considered possibilities of how the the pandemic was done

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:24.480
and once you add infectious RNA clones as a methodology to the equation in terms of how

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.800
important it is to RNA virology in general but more importantly how easily any combination of

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.000
methodologies under that rubric could be used to create the illusion of the pandemic that would

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.840
include high fidelity molecular signals maybe even millions of sequences could be done with clones

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.080
that's it that's the that's the theory and I don't know why everybody gets so angry about it I

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:56.480
surely don't know why people with with many many many more zeros to worry about than me need to

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:02.240
get worried about somebody like me with 3 000 followers on the worst platform in the world

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:09.600
hey 2 122 people here thank you very much I'm gonna bid you good night at this stage and I will be

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.400
on tomorrow but it's probably gonna be during the day if I get my get my ducks in a row we're

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:20.880
gonna be doing a 215 14 14 show and we'll do a couple hours in the afternoon before my kids get

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.960
home and we're gonna try and make that a steady thing and then at night we're gonna try and do

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.760
extra streams like this when we have time and energy I'll be very much thank you for joining me

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:45.680
i'll see you again tomorrow

01:47:46.560 --> 01:48:00.480
it clips party april eighth no actually i think i'm gonna go um we could we could organize

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:06.960
something though what i'm thinking about doing for the eighth of april is going to um the show

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:17.760
title is wrong says beyond the noise that's that's the that's his uh that's his uh that's his vlog

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:24.240
i'm thinking about going to lake eerie for the for the for the eclipse because it goes right

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:29.040
through lake eerie we could all meet at lake area there's like a couple campgrounds there

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:35.200
we could have like a giga home biological eclipse meeting that could be kind of really cool

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.760
anyway we'd have to talk about that um thank you very much for joining me and see you guys again

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:45.200
tomorrow

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:19.920
so

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.640
i didn't change that title but i'll change it now thank you guys
