WEBVTT

00:08.677 --> 00:08.738
you

00:40.794 --> 00:47.040
or behind, you know, proper testing, or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right?

00:47.060 --> 00:49.102
This technology that had never been used widely.

00:49.602 --> 00:51.444
None of that is over.

00:51.544 --> 00:59.872
And as Sasha Lateefa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

01:00.152 --> 01:02.755
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

01:03.255 --> 01:07.417
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

01:07.477 --> 01:11.478
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

01:11.898 --> 01:19.541
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

01:20.021 --> 01:21.482
All of that was on a global basis.

01:30.334 --> 01:32.195
It looks like Arthur's first in the chat.

01:32.235 --> 01:33.435
Congratulations, sir.

01:33.915 --> 01:35.116
The check will be in the mail.

01:35.416 --> 01:36.996
I do already have your address.

01:37.036 --> 01:40.357
So congratulations on winning there, Arthur.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.479
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:48.119 --> 01:49.840
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:51.684 --> 01:52.384
And I have lied.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.445
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:53.465 --> 01:54.405
I don't want to lie.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.226
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.387
I try not to be a liar.

01:57.407 --> 01:58.287
I don't want to be a liar.

01:58.828 --> 02:01.949
I think it's like really important thing.

02:01.969 --> 02:05.871
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:07.692 --> 02:08.372
And I have lied.

02:08.392 --> 02:09.433
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:09.453 --> 02:10.413
I don't want to lie.

02:10.873 --> 02:12.254
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:12.354 --> 02:13.375
I try not to be a liar.

02:13.395 --> 02:14.255
I don't want to be a liar.

02:14.815 --> 02:17.577
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:39.881 --> 02:43.665
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:44.186 --> 02:45.867
We want everybody to feel good.

02:45.947 --> 02:48.130
That's not the way life is.

03:16.024 --> 03:17.226
I don't care how you get there.

03:17.246 --> 03:19.910
I don't care what you do to get there.

03:19.931 --> 03:22.575
The goal is to win.

03:39.847 --> 03:41.448
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.008
Good morning.

03:42.109 --> 03:43.550
Good afternoon, wherever you are.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.551
Six girl, don't worry.

03:45.591 --> 03:46.832
You're always first in my book.

03:47.672 --> 03:53.516
We're trying to stay focused on the biology, not chase these mystery viruses down, not chase these mysteries down.

03:54.537 --> 03:59.940
These mystery adjuvants, these mystery explanations for mythologies that don't exist.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.222
We got to get off social media, ladies and gentlemen.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.943
We've got to pull our heads out.

04:04.063 --> 04:06.145
More importantly, we've got to pull our kids heads out.

04:07.185 --> 04:09.527
Don't underestimate how important this work is.

04:10.407 --> 04:23.871
Autism spectrum disorder is, in fact, a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason or an answer.

04:24.711 --> 04:28.052
You can be said the same thing about pandemics and gain of function.

04:29.212 --> 04:32.553
You can say the same thing about a lot of ways that we have been governed.

04:32.613 --> 04:36.994
Essentially, there's a myth, and people argue about that myth, and it protects the truth.

04:38.134 --> 04:42.937
by chasing these ghosts, by using their tests to find their ghosts, et cetera, et cetera.

04:43.638 --> 04:48.921
And now the trick is, is that they are getting us to pass this mythology onto our kids.

04:48.981 --> 04:50.042
Our teachers are doing it.

04:50.082 --> 04:50.662
We're doing it.

04:51.263 --> 04:52.283
The news is doing it.

04:52.364 --> 04:54.365
Social media influencers are doing it.

04:54.945 --> 05:04.812
And if you don't understand that this trap has multiple sides and it doesn't matter which one you're on, if you don't understand why the cheese is free on all social media platforms,

05:05.853 --> 05:07.876
then you're not gonna escape, and neither will your kids.

05:09.199 --> 05:12.825
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, the biology that they ignore.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.670
I am very, very, very happy.

05:18.126 --> 05:19.247
that you guys are here.

05:20.647 --> 05:22.148
Oh, that's very sweet.

05:23.108 --> 05:27.030
We used to have them nesting in our backyard, these pileated woodpeckers.

05:27.351 --> 05:29.672
Beautiful monkey sound that they make.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.373
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

05:32.393 --> 05:37.175
I want to give a shout out to Houstatonic Live, houstatonicits.com.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.798
That guy is doing some crazy work for a very long time.

05:42.518 --> 05:48.561
has sacrificed an awful lot to put together a website that it seems like nobody can find or use appropriately.

05:49.621 --> 05:57.644
You would have assumed that something like that would have already kicked off a million different investigations and made a few careers already, but it hasn't.

05:58.245 --> 05:59.685
And neither has this Substack.

05:59.725 --> 06:04.967
This Substack, biologyphenomenon.substack.com has not made any headlines.

06:05.007 --> 06:07.969
There's no, you know, this is at least known in Scotland, you would be...

06:08.689 --> 06:10.414
You would be wrong about that.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.544
So anyway, you will know the truth.

06:14.086 --> 06:15.751
The truth will eventually set you free.

06:17.189 --> 06:18.410
That's still true.

06:19.310 --> 06:43.322
It's a question of whether you can find it though It's a question of whether you can find it if you like this giga ohm biological symbol And the idea that biology is the way and you don't mind having my website at the bottom there you like a sticker for a window a for a water bottle Maybe for the back of your laptop or your toolbox or if you want a

06:44.361 --> 06:50.247
A Velcro-backed patch that's not perfectly made, but the G and the ohm is okay.

06:51.809 --> 06:52.890
And you want that for free?

06:52.910 --> 06:57.435
You can just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Dr. J at P.O.

06:57.475 --> 06:59.797
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102.

07:00.898 --> 07:04.101
And we'll turn that right around right away.

07:04.141 --> 07:05.062
We got a box of them.

07:05.783 --> 07:11.410
that I spend probably more money than I should have because not very many people have bothered to get one.

07:12.031 --> 07:12.631
So let me know.

07:13.893 --> 07:19.840
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a message coming out of you out of the United States of America, specifically in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:19.860 --> 07:23.264
If you've been here for a while, you might be at the top of the wave.

07:24.625 --> 07:37.909
If not, you might be a skilled TV watcher who needs to learn how to stay focused on the biology, how to not take the bait on social media even when you go there, and to make sure that you're loving your neighbor, who they are, you know, etc.

07:39.990 --> 07:43.791
And so don't get me wrong, I am not so

07:46.505 --> 08:00.869
Enamored with myself that I think I'm as good a teacher as this gentleman is doing here on this artificial wave Instructing this young man how to catch Wow, this is just awesome, isn't it?

08:01.749 --> 08:06.291
But I do think that we need to do this for our kids from a figurative perspective

08:07.451 --> 08:23.680
with regard to their ability to navigate reality, their ability to see reality, and their ability to avoid the pitfalls of social media, which we ourselves are not as vulnerable to as they are because, like it or not, we didn't have this shit when we were young.

08:23.980 --> 08:31.425
And you cannot underestimate how much damage is being done on a daily basis to our children because they're on Snapchat.

08:32.225 --> 08:38.169
You cannot underestimate how much damage is being done because they're on TikTok or these other things.

08:38.189 --> 08:46.335
Even watching YouTube shorts is doing damage that the cartoons on Saturday morning probably didn't do to us.

08:46.475 --> 08:53.219
Even if we ate several bowls of Lucky Charms while we watched those cartoons, it's not the same.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.160
It's not the same.

08:55.361 --> 08:56.722
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

08:56.742 --> 08:57.663
Let me switch over here.

08:59.904 --> 09:00.945
Should work like that.

09:02.314 --> 09:03.135
Good morning, everybody.

09:03.175 --> 09:03.756
Welcome to the show.

09:03.796 --> 09:07.899
This is Gig Owen, Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:08.920 --> 09:15.425
We are trying to stay focused and not take the bait on social media, but it has been difficult because the bait's been there a while.

09:15.465 --> 09:17.527
They've been misleading the young for a while.

09:19.989 --> 09:34.969
The most egregious example of this that has manifested itself in the head of the FDA and the head of CBER is this absolute clown show that started with ZDogg and Vinayak

09:37.722 --> 09:50.677
doing presentations on YouTube and kind of being this duo that occasionally, not that seldomly, had this guy, Marty McCary, on as a guest.

09:51.738 --> 09:59.083
And now they, you know, it seemed like they were promoting his book and stuff like that and just being innocent faculty members or innocent YouTube producers.

09:59.983 --> 10:01.364
But it's not the way it is at all.

10:01.785 --> 10:07.728
These people were put in place and have been auditioning for the last five years for the

10:08.709 --> 10:13.851
for the puppetry that they're doing now, the performance, the role that they are playing now.

10:14.531 --> 10:20.453
That's why you can only go back and see these earlier videos as scripted bullshit, and you have to do this homework.

10:21.113 --> 10:28.736
If you don't go back and try to really absorb how absurd it is that these people were doing what they were doing in 2021, you won't see it.

10:31.417 --> 10:58.594
and it's important to see it because if you were to try to do the same thing with me by this time already you would find me saying that transfection is crazy and why won't anybody say it and these people are lying about a background they're misconstruing a background signal with spread i was already saying that when these guys were performing this act on social media and that's terrifying in my humble opinion it's terrifying because what it what it means

10:59.671 --> 11:03.192
is that we are under attack as a country.

11:03.252 --> 11:27.976
We are essentially under attack by a group of performers which has promoted themselves and auditioned on podcasts and rehearsed their narrative on podcasts, critique each other's performances on podcasts, and collectively have orchestrated this illusion of consensus on social media that many people are captured by, even quite intelligent people, because that's how

11:29.540 --> 11:30.861
Our social brains work.

11:32.863 --> 11:36.666
And it takes special people to be able to see through a group lie.

11:37.247 --> 11:38.428
Really special people.

11:39.489 --> 11:42.451
Usually those special people have been beaten when they are younger.

11:43.492 --> 11:49.677
Maybe they got thrown on the floor a few times by their hair or by their ears.

11:49.737 --> 11:55.863
Those are the kinds of people that grow up knowing that groups of adults will lie.

11:56.823 --> 12:06.531
groups of adults are capable of looking the other way, even when something really egregious is occurring, or seems to be occurring, or is about to occur.

12:07.572 --> 12:07.993
And once

12:09.071 --> 12:20.798
a young person learns that, then they can grow up into an adult that has a really good perspective on what adults are capable of, just for the simple fact that they don't have the courage to always open their mouth.

12:20.858 --> 12:29.943
Because apparently, according to the adult behavior that I've seen throughout my whole life, there are situations where it's just not appropriate to speak up, apparently.

12:32.025 --> 12:37.268
And in the case of children and abused children, maybe even, you know,

12:39.938 --> 13:05.591
in a marriage where one parent or the other parent is especially abusive and then one parent just kind of lets it all happen and goes along with it, this is a situation where you create a person like me, where in the end now, when I see this and when I think about this, it's very easy for me to imagine people that would be willing to go and lie about shit.

13:06.621 --> 13:13.348
It's very, very easy for me to believe that people will lie about shit because I've worked in academic science.

13:15.050 --> 13:15.591
I've seen it.

13:16.312 --> 13:17.373
I know how people think.

13:18.254 --> 13:20.036
I know how easy it is to do it.

13:22.458 --> 13:26.320
I mean, these data sets are based on Excel files sometimes.

13:26.361 --> 13:28.582
So Excel files are very easy to edit.

13:28.662 --> 13:38.648
Sometimes you see people, and I have seen people who use Photoshop on figures to reduce the size of error bars.

13:38.708 --> 13:40.810
I mean, these people are jokes.

13:42.391 --> 13:49.135
So they don't think it's really that bad because they reduce the error bars, but they leave the numbers the same in the caption.

13:51.957 --> 14:02.262
I mean, we are talking about people that will do anything to get ahead because they perceive any advantage as being something that's worth taking.

14:03.442 --> 14:17.489
These are the people who are now these scripted narrative curators, these people that are performing on the internet and taking the script that they're given and reading the promotions that they're given, selling the products that sponsor them.

14:23.621 --> 14:25.902
It's very dire what we have in America right now.

14:25.942 --> 14:28.604
The situation right now is extremely dire.

14:38.710 --> 14:44.694
And the situation is, is that America is captured by people who are doing an elaborate performance.

14:46.172 --> 14:53.596
I mean, we have, there's a whole list of people who just perform on Substack and X for a living.

14:55.257 --> 14:56.938
And you have to come to terms with that.

14:56.998 --> 14:59.220
They're not on Blue Sky.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.301
They're not trying to talk to anyone.

15:02.322 --> 15:12.828
They are making their living by perpetuating narratives specifically on what you might think of as our side of the narrative, the people who were skeptical from the beginning.

15:13.908 --> 15:19.113
And every time we identify ourselves with that team, then we are already shot.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.134
We're not part of that team either.

15:22.295 --> 15:34.706
GigaOM Biological and the Independent Bright Web are part of a separate narrative, a narrative that does not acknowledge that a pandemic occurred in some form or another.

15:35.887 --> 15:39.911
We are the victims of a very elaborate hoax, a long con.

15:41.499 --> 15:42.620
That's the way you need to see it.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.980
It's a long con.

15:44.020 --> 15:50.323
It's very hard to see coordinated actions and plans that extend across decades.

15:50.363 --> 15:51.604
It's hard to see those things.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.065
There's only one meeting a year.

15:54.345 --> 15:57.387
You know, there's only one phone call every couple of years.

15:57.487 --> 16:03.890
There's only one or two emails required to keep a multi-decade plan on course.

16:03.990 --> 16:07.132
As long as everybody knew from the very beginning what that course was.

16:09.198 --> 16:26.333
And one of the things that was on that course was the eventual usurping of, co-opting of, or evolution of the FDA to make room for the idea that we're not just one species with one genotype.

16:26.413 --> 16:31.818
And so that's the reason why all these previous strategies haven't worked so well on everybody.

16:32.560 --> 16:39.730
And so that means that we have to study all the variation that's present in our population in order to get a handle on how real medicine works.

16:40.251 --> 16:43.035
And that's where the idea of personalized medicine comes from.

16:43.075 --> 16:45.398
And these people are all scripted on that already.

16:46.584 --> 16:58.833
And that's why they choose two cancer doctors to be the head of the FDA, so that they have this whole script and vocabulary list of things and improv possibilities that they can go into.

16:59.653 --> 17:05.538
If Vinayak decides to throw out T cell therapy, you know,

17:06.747 --> 17:09.048
Marty can just go bing, bing, bing, bing, bang.

17:09.088 --> 17:11.910
And if he gets something out of that, then yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:11.990 --> 17:12.830
I worked on that too.

17:12.870 --> 17:15.071
And I have this special way of analyzing that data.

17:15.632 --> 17:23.776
And so these guys have been practicing their juggling act for five years on social media with the help of this clown and others.

17:26.013 --> 17:32.738
And there's been a lot of people, there's been a lot of people doing that for more than a decade and a half.

17:32.838 --> 17:46.849
And Mary Holland actually started perfecting the public facing version of her story in 2015 on Democracy Now with these two ladies opposite Paul Offit.

17:47.569 --> 18:10.742
Yes, 10 years ago, Mary Holland was opposite Paul Offit on Democracy Now with these two host ladies and a Jewish lawyer talking about vaccines and the fact that one of the untested components of the MMR vaccine probably gave autism to Mary Holland's son.

18:10.842 --> 18:16.765
And now 10 years later, we're supposed to believe that this is the state of the argument.

18:18.547 --> 18:20.268
Bobby is HHS secretary.

18:20.348 --> 18:24.189
Bobby has fired the ACIP members and replaced them with other people.

18:24.989 --> 18:35.153
And the entire world is about to go through a Vesuvius-like disaster soon because, you know, it's going to be so much, so much infectious disease.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.654
You're not even really going to be able to move around.

18:37.974 --> 18:41.095
You're, you know, they might just drift your door shut like snow.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.256
Mimi Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.

18:43.937 --> 18:46.219
We turn now to public health and vaccines.

18:46.499 --> 18:49.581
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.323
has withdrawn a U.S.

18:51.403 --> 19:01.291
pledge to fund the world's preeminent international vaccine organization as the Trump administration takes its campaign against vaccinations led by RFK Jr.

19:01.511 --> 19:01.892
Global.

19:02.532 --> 19:25.517
The organization known as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is the world's largest funder of life-saving vaccinations and says it's helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 lower income countries, preventing... Okay, so I'm going to listen to this, don't worry, but I see that my friend in the chat has very few woodpeckers over there.

19:25.537 --> 19:27.137
I want to get another video up for him.

19:28.585 --> 19:38.745
The woodpecker I showed you is a pileated woodpecker and they are like the biggest woodpecker in North America, unless you count like the ivory-billed woodpecker, which I think is supposed to be kind of extinct.

19:39.814 --> 19:59.926
Um, and they are fantastic because they actually, they, they hit the wood a few times with their head and then they, they really just hold their head down and let the muscles of their, their neck, um, kind of resonate.

20:00.306 --> 20:01.627
And, and they're loud.

20:01.727 --> 20:05.269
Like when they're, when they're hunting for a larva, they are loud.

20:05.670 --> 20:06.550
Um, it's sweet.

20:07.351 --> 20:07.891
Listen to this.

20:09.875 --> 20:34.712
hold on one second I'm gonna get it get it up there come on get me the arrow right there it is so check this out see he's listening for the movement of the of the larva in there and then he'll bump it try and make it move

20:43.092 --> 20:43.933
See that last part?

20:46.155 --> 20:47.676
That's him bouncing his head on it.

20:48.297 --> 20:48.957
It's pretty dope.

20:52.921 --> 20:56.504
And it sounds so cool when you hear it live because it's just like this.

20:56.564 --> 20:57.124
It echoes.

21:01.568 --> 21:04.931
They're really a really monster cool bird.

21:05.552 --> 21:06.873
Anyway, back to the show.

21:08.274 --> 21:10.955
nearly 19 million future deaths.

21:11.755 --> 21:18.878
On Wednesday, Kennedy claimed, without any evidence, that Gavi, quote, ignored the science in its global immunization.

21:19.078 --> 21:23.299
I can tell you that I'd rather hear Heather Haines' voice than this voice.

21:23.339 --> 21:24.560
This one is really amazing.

21:24.940 --> 21:25.420
Campaign.

21:26.678 --> 21:34.625
Unfortunately, in its zeal to promote universal vaccination, it has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.

21:35.145 --> 21:38.828
When the science was inconvenient, Gavi ignored the science.

21:39.789 --> 21:48.316
I call on Gavi today to re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion that America has provided in funding since 2001.

21:49.893 --> 21:52.256
Also Wednesday, scientists at the U.S.

21:52.276 --> 21:58.743
Centers for Disease Control rallied outside the agency's headquarters in Atlanta to protest the Trump administration.

21:59.124 --> 22:01.006
That's the scientist rally.

22:01.306 --> 22:01.867
That's awesome.

22:02.810 --> 22:12.893
This newly reconstituted vaccine advisory panel—it's called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP—RFK Jr.

22:13.433 --> 22:19.855
stacked the committee with new appointees, fired most of the others, many of them holding anti-vaccine views.

22:20.235 --> 22:25.776
He fired all 17 formerly seated members of the panel and replaced them with a— She said that kind of funny.

22:25.836 --> 22:32.098
It sounded like he fired people with anti-vaccine views, which was not, I don't think, what she meant to say.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.619
smaller group of his own.

22:33.759 --> 22:37.161
Wednesday was the first day of the new committee's meeting.

22:37.582 --> 22:50.230
This is former CDC worker Peter Higlowski, who is Bella umbrella here every Tuesday since the maybe since March.

22:50.310 --> 23:00.497
But today is especially important because this is the first meeting of this new and I would say bogus advisory committee for immunization practices.

23:00.517 --> 23:01.457
A.C.I.P.

23:02.798 --> 23:07.562
Kennedy, as most people know, fired the previous members of ACIP.

23:08.603 --> 23:13.227
And the few people that he's put on it are not competent.

23:13.688 --> 23:16.770
For more on these developments, we're joined by Dr. Paul Offit.

23:16.830 --> 23:25.478
He's the director of the Vaccine Education Center, attending Physician Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, also serves as an advisor to the FDA.

23:26.078 --> 23:44.764
Dr. Offit is the co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, recommended for universal use in infants by the CDC, author of numerous books, including Autism's False Prophets, Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and The Search for a Cure, as well as the book Deadly Choices, How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All.

23:45.464 --> 23:54.867
Why didn't they list that other one, which is called Vaccines from, from, why, why, what, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:56.598 --> 23:57.959
Why didn't they list this one?

23:58.099 --> 24:04.705
Vaccinated from cowpox to mRNA, the incredible story of vaccines written in 2007.

24:06.266 --> 24:08.808
Why didn't, why didn't they do this one?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.009
Why didn't they do this book?

24:12.451 --> 24:16.815
How come they didn't tell you about this one that he predicted mRNA back in 2007?

24:17.235 --> 24:18.917
It sounds like it was a plan already.

24:19.844 --> 24:20.764
That's so weird.

24:20.804 --> 24:21.984
These guys are so weird.

24:22.024 --> 24:23.525
I don't know why they leave that book out.

24:23.585 --> 24:24.885
That's something so weird.

24:25.405 --> 24:27.285
They're not very good journalists, I don't think.

24:27.426 --> 24:29.686
Dr. Offutt, thanks so much for joining us again.

24:29.846 --> 24:32.987
If you can start off by talking about this two-day meeting.

24:33.047 --> 24:34.287
The first was yesterday.

24:36.107 --> 24:43.149
She's really not that excited about this, but she's been coached to make sure that she gives Paul Offutt a good send-off.

24:48.470 --> 24:49.490
Wow, that was forced.

24:50.267 --> 24:58.800
whole issue that the people on this committee are saying they're just reexamining the whole roster of vaccines.

24:59.281 --> 25:00.482
What does that mean?

25:00.883 --> 25:05.991
How does that affect kids in this country, adults, as well, and people around the world?

25:07.588 --> 25:11.871
Well, so anti-vaccine activists have been shouting from the sidelines for decades.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.612
Now they're making policy.

25:13.792 --> 25:26.161
We have an anti-vaccine activist and science denialist as the Secretary of Health and Human Services who basically fired 17 people who were members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices.

25:26.261 --> 25:29.203
Now, I want you to start doing the mental exercise.

25:29.243 --> 25:35.567
Those of you who are in the chat or are live right now, I want you to do the mental exercise about how he's going to explain

25:36.624 --> 25:42.250
that we got here, that now there is anti-vaccine skepticism in America.

25:42.350 --> 25:45.173
What, what will have pushed this over the edge?

25:45.213 --> 25:46.474
Was it the movie Vaxxed?

25:47.295 --> 25:48.577
Was it the movie Vaxxed 2?

25:49.097 --> 25:56.345
Maybe it was that, that Suzanne Humphreys chick and her, her book that she wrote with that Roman Bozanski guy.

25:56.765 --> 25:57.226
Is that it?

25:57.366 --> 25:57.946
Bozankik.

25:58.735 --> 26:10.184
Is that the reason, what's he gonna blame for the tipping point when, you know, we had everything going well and everybody understood the science and then suddenly this bullshit happened.

26:11.325 --> 26:13.106
Just start doing that mental exercise.

26:13.126 --> 26:14.828
You should already know what he's gonna say.

26:15.609 --> 26:22.915
who went through the proper vetting process, made sure they didn't have conflicts of interest, made sure they had the expertise to give us the advice we needed.

26:23.255 --> 26:24.396
He fired all those people.

26:24.716 --> 26:34.004
Then what he did is he brought in eight people, now one of them backed off, so it's seven people, who would have never passed the confirmation process.

26:34.464 --> 26:36.566
There is no confirmation process.

26:36.606 --> 26:37.466
That's so dumb.

26:37.486 --> 26:39.008
That's the whole point of this, right?

26:39.048 --> 26:40.168
That's what's dumb about it.

26:40.209 --> 26:41.109
Why does he say that?

26:42.210 --> 26:47.714
It almost opens him up for critique from our side, as long as you don't show that to the mainstream people.

26:48.254 --> 26:54.599
You know, Tucker Carlson can laugh like that, or maybe Bret Weinstein will say something like, there's no confirmation for this.

26:54.659 --> 26:56.640
That guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

26:58.075 --> 27:20.696
don't have the expertise we need to get to give good advice and what they're doing is they're just putting forward what is typically anti-vaccine tropes like kids are getting too many vaccines too soon so we need to read so that's a trope that kids are getting too many vaccines too soon that's a trope that would mean that that would be impossible that would mean that there's no there's no

27:22.029 --> 27:27.231
reason to think that there might be a good time and a bad time to get a vaccine.

27:27.711 --> 27:37.114
His argument is, is that in theory, if people weren't so, such pussies, we could give all these vaccines in the first three minutes of their life.

27:39.154 --> 27:45.956
And I don't think we're too far off in terms of the stance that this guy is taking with regard to vaccines.

27:46.016 --> 27:47.377
There's no real danger.

27:49.087 --> 27:58.091
There's no real danger from any of the modern vaccines because we could put tens of thousands of antigens in one injection and it would be okay.

28:00.272 --> 28:00.932
Evaluate that.

28:01.332 --> 28:04.934
Why are we giving a hepatitis B birth dose, et cetera, et cetera.

28:04.994 --> 28:10.536
And so you're now just seeing anti-vaccine activism move into the center of public health.

28:11.815 --> 28:20.060
And Dr. Offit, in fact, the panel chair, Dr. Robert Malone, said he considers the label anti-vaxxer to be high praise.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.881
I mean, you've worked in.

28:21.901 --> 28:26.043
Now, what you have here again, remember, is who are we agreeing to talk about?

28:26.103 --> 28:28.264
Whose names are we saying out loud?

28:28.885 --> 28:38.230
She is reading a script that says Robert Malone's name because Robert Malone is now the chairperson of the ACIP that we're all afraid of now.

28:40.856 --> 28:45.020
And he is the guy who says, I'm proud to be an anti-vaxxer.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.662
Do you see how they trapped us?

28:50.765 --> 28:54.929
This was never going to be any useful resistance.

28:54.989 --> 28:59.993
It was only going to be a way of pivoting to an FDA that was blamed.

29:01.021 --> 29:08.089
to a vaccine schedule that gets updated, maybe they're going to say take out all the adjuvants and then the vaccine won't work anymore.

29:08.129 --> 29:19.021
And so then they'll all just say, well, then we'll replace it all with an mRNA version, or that's an impetus to replace it with all mRNA because we can't just take the adjuvant out of the old stuff or the old stuff won't work.

29:20.202 --> 29:25.043
So if you're gonna make us take the adjuvant out, then well, the only way to do that is to move to mRNA.

29:25.083 --> 29:31.325
That's all coming right now in the script, right now, like I called it in 2021 already.

29:32.565 --> 29:37.926
And I don't wanna be a shit about telling you that I said it.

29:38.366 --> 29:44.628
What I want you to understand is that in 2021, I was explaining to them that this was the trap that we were walking into.

29:45.575 --> 29:53.478
that they could do a bait and switch over years and blame something on rushing and whatever and whatnot, but then also say, you know what?

29:53.778 --> 29:55.659
The old stuff wasn't that good anyway.

29:59.080 --> 30:10.885
And the idea that the same people are gonna be wrestling, it's still Hulk Hogan versus, you see, how can it still be Macho Man and Hulk Hogan up here after this many years?

30:15.249 --> 30:19.251
of vaccine information, the director of the Vaccine Education Center.

30:20.231 --> 30:31.756
What do you think explains this transformation in the perception of the effectiveness of vaccines, and not just the effectiveness, but what they're propagating, which is the danger of vaccines?

30:33.777 --> 30:38.321
Six girl in the chat is tweeting about Christine Stibel Ben.

30:38.382 --> 30:41.004
She's done a lot of work out of Denmark.

30:41.985 --> 30:44.928
I also covered Christine Stibel Ben very early on.

30:46.389 --> 30:49.492
And I I'm surprised that she.

30:55.178 --> 30:57.560
I'm surprised that she isn't.

31:00.823 --> 31:03.405
There's something about her that it's allowed to go on.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.846
I'm not really sure why it is.

31:04.906 --> 31:08.027
I guess it's because she doesn't make the leap, right?

31:08.108 --> 31:20.295
She still can see this imaginary trade-off between, well, the people who are vaccinated don't get the diseases that they were vaccinated against, according to the people studying the vaccines.

31:22.532 --> 31:29.977
but the ones that get those vaccine preventable deaths, quote unquote, vaccine preventable diseases, rather, don't die from them.

31:30.057 --> 31:33.880
So then it's really like, okay, I don't really get it.

31:33.940 --> 31:41.104
And then the argument gets made, well, if you weren't vaccinating these kids, then more of the kids would die or something like that.

31:42.706 --> 31:48.509
It's always falling just short of saying that, you know what, intramuscular injection is just plain dumb.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.752
You know, we have books this big

31:52.682 --> 31:58.624
This big about vaccines written by Plotkin, Orstein, and Paul Offit.

31:58.704 --> 32:00.944
Books this big that's called Vaccines.

32:02.425 --> 32:07.086
We have two volume books this big called Infectious Disease.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.946
These are gray, green books, sorry.

32:08.966 --> 32:10.347
So the green screen loses them.

32:12.867 --> 32:19.669
Fields Virology is on its like seventh edition and it's two giant volumes of virology.

32:21.687 --> 32:32.333
And so for you to even have a discussion with Paul Offit, you need to read like, I don't know, 1200 textbook pages and kind of know it all more or less well enough to argue with him about it.

32:33.654 --> 32:38.717
Otherwise you don't know enough about vaccinology or infectious disease or epidemiology or virology.

32:41.879 --> 32:44.101
Nevermind the prion books you got to read over there.

32:47.563 --> 32:49.524
That's the situation we're in right now.

32:51.124 --> 33:06.549
These people hide behind a mythology that has been perpetuated and complicated by the rampant acceptance of the assumption that evolution because DNA.

33:07.849 --> 33:12.851
And because transfection works, I guess we understand how everything works.

33:13.959 --> 33:19.283
I guess because we can put a sequence here and get a protein there, I guess we know how everything works.

33:19.403 --> 33:21.244
And that's really the illusion.

33:22.385 --> 33:41.099
Because both, you can put sequences in cells and get them to make proteins and still not know jack shit about how the pattern integrity that is your newborn son is going to evolve into the West Point graduate that makes you so proud.

33:42.284 --> 33:46.808
You don't know anything about anything, and all you can hope is to not get in its way.

33:49.550 --> 34:07.126
And the idea that these people are selling us that intramuscular injection is not only a useful way to augment that kid, but it guarantees their success moving forward in the future is not supported by any biological evidence, least of all that of Christine Stibel Ben.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.767
Again, shout out to the chatter there.

34:10.751 --> 34:16.696
I think that we, to some extent, lost the trust of the American public early in the COVID pandemic.

34:17.236 --> 34:18.598
And I think two things happened.

34:18.618 --> 34:32.209
I think in 2020, when we didn't have anything, we didn't have antivirals until October, we didn't have monoclonal antibodies until November, we didn't have vaccines until December, to try and stop the spread of a virus that was spread asymptomatically.

34:33.129 --> 34:33.969
And so what did we do?

34:34.309 --> 34:38.511
We shuttered schools, we closed businesses, we restricted travel.

34:38.811 --> 34:42.052
What part of that narrative would Mary Holland disagree with?

34:43.272 --> 34:47.433
None of that, none of that narrative would Mary Holland disagree with.

34:47.953 --> 34:55.075
What part of that narrative would 2020 Brian Hooker have disagreed with when he was doing the back and forth with Dr. Kendra?

34:55.835 --> 34:58.756
Not one damn thing.

35:00.802 --> 35:02.723
because there's no murder in that story.

35:02.823 --> 35:04.805
Or should I say manslaughter, right?

35:04.865 --> 35:09.327
Because these people don't have like a plan to kill everybody.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.808
So they're not murderers.

35:10.848 --> 35:12.570
They're just guilty of manslaughter.

35:12.590 --> 35:22.796
You know, if you just turn on the oxygen and walk away, it's kind of like negligence or it's something, you know, like it's, it's yucky, but you didn't really murder him.

35:23.697 --> 35:26.098
So maybe I should say manslaughter and lies.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.981
You know, that's all that they're really covering up is manslaughter and lies.

35:31.052 --> 35:34.755
We masked, isolated, quarantined, social distanced, and tested.

35:35.316 --> 35:41.941
And I think there was a percentage of this population that thought that was massive government overreach, especially the shuttering of schools and closing of businesses.

35:42.462 --> 35:48.287
I think the following year when we had a vaccine, which we did by December of 2020, and that was available by January of 2021,

35:50.249 --> 35:57.013
We very quickly vaccinated 70% of this population by July of 2021, but 30% of this population didn't want to be vaccinated.

35:57.394 --> 36:02.517
First of all, people didn't like it that you had to have your vaccine passport, which is to say, unless you were vaccinated.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.138
I mean, how is this for a summary?

36:05.359 --> 36:08.001
Are you not entertained?

36:09.542 --> 36:15.807
This is the exact summary that any one of my family members would be able to regurgitate point for point.

36:16.977 --> 36:28.823
This is the exact summary that Mary Holland would grant would regurgitate point for point that Robert Malone would regurgitate point for point that Robert F. Kennedy would regurgitate point for point.

36:28.863 --> 36:30.804
There's no critique of anything.

36:30.864 --> 36:31.845
They're useful.

36:33.385 --> 36:40.529
It is just the narrative where Rand Paul and Tony Fauci are yelling at each other about a lab leak coverup.

36:42.908 --> 36:49.291
You couldn't go to your favorite bar or restaurant or a place of worship, or you may be fired from your job.

36:49.612 --> 36:53.153
That, too, was, I think, seen as massive government overreach.

36:53.173 --> 36:56.915
And I think we leaned into a libertarian left hook, and I think we're feeling that punch.

36:56.935 --> 36:59.056
So everything sort of fell out.

36:59.116 --> 37:04.339
I mean, people said, well, COVID's not that big of a deal, or, well, the vaccine is really much more dangerous than they're telling you.

37:04.739 --> 37:08.083
They lost the trust in the government, and they were very quick to see conspiracy.

37:08.363 --> 37:10.005
And that's how RFK Jr.

37:10.366 --> 37:11.467
rose into this position.

37:11.587 --> 37:13.870
I mean, what did he say when he fired those 17 people?

37:13.890 --> 37:17.294
He said they were rife with conflicts of interest, which wasn't true.

37:17.554 --> 37:23.481
He couldn't name one person on that committee who had a conflict of interest that in any way affected their vote, not one.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.462
So instead, he just

37:24.602 --> 37:45.854
How is it possible that I worked for the guy in the middle for more than a year, then I worked for his supposedly non-profit or whatever for another almost nine months afterward for Mary Holland and Brian Hooker, and then was fired by them for talking about Robert Malone, the guy who's now on the ACIP, head of that committee.

37:46.866 --> 37:59.461
And how is it that I've been at at least four, three barbecues, I'll say three conservatively because I know for sure it was three, barbecues where I met Jay Bhattacharya in person and could talk to him as long as I wanted.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.267
And you can imagine I wasn't talking about baseball.

38:05.488 --> 38:06.850
I wasn't talking about basketball.

38:12.776 --> 38:30.706
How is it possible that we're here right now, that that guy who has been streaming with super jackass ZDogg and, and the Indian like Doogie Howser, Vinayak Prasad, like how is this possibly real?

38:31.706 --> 38:37.029
That that guy in the middle has been fighting this guy from CHOP for 15 years.

38:40.014 --> 38:43.535
Tell us more, please tell us more that we haven't heard before.

38:43.555 --> 38:47.237
It's had this broad sweeping, you know, they're all in the pocket of industry.

38:47.277 --> 38:52.579
They're all on duly influence and then to extend this to Gavi to the global alliance vaccine initiative.

38:52.599 --> 38:54.379
You couldn't be more short-sighted.

38:54.919 --> 38:59.081
How do people think measles comes into this country periodically and can start outbreaks.

38:59.141 --> 39:01.702
It's coming from often from outside the country because

39:02.322 --> 39:04.084
Every year, there's millions of cases of measles.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.828
There's almost 150,000 deaths from measles in this year.

39:07.308 --> 39:14.757
And the Global Alliance Vaccine Initiative has done a lot of good at sort of stopping the spread of things like measles and German measles, et cetera.

39:14.797 --> 39:16.560
So it's hard to watch all this.

39:17.559 --> 39:21.482
Dr. Afet, I want to ask you to respond to RFK Jr.'

39:21.462 --> 39:26.006
's appointee, the co-chair, Martin Koldorf, who kicked off Wednesday's panel.

39:26.426 --> 39:33.271
He said he's appointing a working group to look at the, quote, cumulative effect of the children's vaccine schedule.

39:34.913 --> 39:39.596
If you have questions or concerns about the safety or efficacy of vaccines, we want to hear them.

39:41.157 --> 39:45.481
That is the scientific method, and it is natural to ask questions.

39:46.772 --> 39:48.393
That is what the CDC said.

39:48.474 --> 39:55.860
Could they have chose a worse person to put at the head or chair of this thing?

39:56.561 --> 40:00.604
Besides Robert Malone, they put a foreign guy with a foreign accent.

40:01.604 --> 40:10.872
And I don't care how long he's been living in America, he's been going back to Sweden enough and speaking Swedish enough that his accent hasn't changed since he got off the plane the first time.

40:11.873 --> 40:17.859
So for me, I know Dutch people who can speak almost in an American accent if they want to.

40:20.265 --> 40:25.469
If he's been teaching at Harvard for that long, he would have gotten a little bit better at speaking English.

40:26.089 --> 40:28.331
And if not, I'm not insulting him.

40:28.391 --> 40:45.784
I'm just saying, if you're choosing somebody to try to help unite the country and try to bring this in a way that people can't easily write off, why in the Sam hell would you choose this guy with this voice, with this, you know, like what's going on?

40:47.008 --> 40:50.452
We're a country of 300 million plus people, you know?

40:51.573 --> 40:52.213
...experts do.

40:53.375 --> 40:56.938
It's what the public does, and it is what we will do.

40:57.739 --> 40:59.781
No questions should be off limits.

41:02.664 --> 41:06.728
Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee.

41:07.910 --> 41:14.355
issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro or anti vaccine box.

41:15.857 --> 41:23.823
Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry and it further feeds the flames of vaccine hesitancy.

41:26.666 --> 41:33.892
As secretary Kennedy has eloquent, there are flames of vaccine hesitancy, which can be flamed.

41:35.635 --> 41:38.216
Understand that that's a enchantment there.

41:38.657 --> 41:40.297
There are vaccine.

41:40.317 --> 41:46.901
Hesitancy flames that can be, that can be fanned.

41:47.541 --> 41:49.802
Okay.

41:50.643 --> 42:00.228
Opposing mercury in fish does not make you anti fish and opposing mercury in fish does not make you anti fish.

42:02.315 --> 42:08.357
which is something he's been saying since they were gonna green the vaccines of America all those many years ago.

42:08.477 --> 42:13.579
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the hamster wheel turns, but it doesn't go anywhere.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.440
It stays in exactly the same fricking spot.

42:18.901 --> 42:21.902
Posing mercury and vaccines that don't make you anti-vaccine.

42:22.903 --> 42:31.306
In fact, to thoroughly scrutinize and ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.

42:32.435 --> 42:37.198
So, Dr. Offit, Martin Koldorf is just saying we're just looking at all of this.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.801
I believe that Paul Offit is genuinely pissed.

42:41.542 --> 42:41.862
I do.

42:42.702 --> 42:46.225
I believe that genuinely Paul Offit believes everything that he says.

42:47.686 --> 42:50.428
And it's necessary for him to believe everything he says.

42:50.488 --> 42:53.910
But I don't think he's that sophisticated of a biologist.

42:55.892 --> 42:56.312
I don't.

42:56.612 --> 42:59.834
I don't think that he's done any work in his life

43:00.734 --> 43:10.598
that has approached the edge of what we understand, and therefore he's very unaware of the ground on which he stands or doesn't stand.

43:10.938 --> 43:19.161
It's like a guy who thinks he's standing on the most solid mountain in the world overlooking

43:20.001 --> 43:38.935
you know, a peaceful small town in northern Wisconsin, when in reality, you know, he's actually standing on a really shitty board on the edge of a really crappy roof, overlooking the ghetto of somewhere in Rio de Janeiro.

43:42.778 --> 43:46.660
And it's just because he's stayed on that roof his whole life,

43:47.837 --> 43:50.758
and the food's good, that he doesn't realize it.

43:50.878 --> 43:56.159
And as long as he keeps his cool and sticks to the narrative, he's going to be fine.

43:59.079 --> 44:04.400
And with some of these people, I just don't think it's possible for them to see through it.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.621
They're surrounded by other people who also can't see through it.

44:07.721 --> 44:11.182
And so it's not that dissimilar to being in a church.

44:12.502 --> 44:16.043
I'm not saying you need to see through something in a church, but in a church,

44:17.542 --> 44:45.133
You can you understand how there the faith is never questioned there whatever they believe in that church Once you're inside of the church the whole discussion of is it true or not doesn't happen And so where he works and where doctors work and where nurses work you don't even question it, you know, there's no talk of of things being exaggerated or or you know, we exaggerate the effectiveness of these things just so we don't have to have the stupid argument and

44:45.638 --> 44:51.063
Nobody says that because nobody can have that idea inside of a church.

44:53.565 --> 44:55.287
You can't have skepticism.

44:55.327 --> 44:57.769
You think Jesus was really the Son of God?

44:58.029 --> 44:59.370
Do you think He really was?

44:59.731 --> 45:00.151
Really?

45:00.171 --> 45:09.700
Then you can't stop a mass in the middle of the mass and raise your hand and say, yeah, but...

45:12.495 --> 45:36.190
And so the commitment with which Robert Malone and Ratziff-Levy and Martin Kulldorff and Paul Offit, the commitment with which they will argue about these two sides of a debate wherein both sides accept the effectiveness of vaccines, the immense contribution of vaccines to human health,

45:37.290 --> 45:41.613
the advancement that vaccination as a methodology in general is.

45:42.173 --> 45:45.515
And none of them can or will ever question that.

45:45.715 --> 45:51.039
Not even Retsif Levy, the guy with six kids who's, you know, just thinking like a father.

45:51.819 --> 45:53.220
Stop lying.

45:56.162 --> 46:06.088
Comes from the most vaccinated country in the world that whose leader told them that, uh, you know, we want to be Pfizer's vaccine for the laboratory for the world.

46:08.274 --> 46:09.495
And this guy, come on.

46:09.975 --> 46:10.716
Come on.

46:12.998 --> 46:13.418
Come on.

46:15.219 --> 46:16.480
What is your response?

46:16.640 --> 46:23.185
And talk not only what it means here, again, you are referring to Gavi, what this means globally.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.227
She is hysterical.

46:25.267 --> 46:28.409
Like, what is this going to do to the world?

46:30.230 --> 46:36.395
Why saying evaluation is perfectly innocent and reasonable and scientific?

46:38.459 --> 46:39.420
Well, that's true.

46:39.620 --> 46:44.444
I think evaluation is perfectly reasonable, but you don't necessarily need to evaluate things that are already clear.

46:44.824 --> 46:56.654
So, for example, when he talks about this notion that we're just getting too many vaccines, that we need to look at the entire vaccine schedule, it shows you that he really doesn't understand the immunology of vaccines, which is true of most of the people sitting around that table.

46:56.994 --> 47:00.417
They don't have the expertise in virology or immunology or vaccinology.

47:00.457 --> 47:05.581
So, for example, people say, look, I mean, we're asking so much of parents of this country, and it's true.

47:06.642 --> 47:10.025
It's them to give vaccines that prevent 14 different diseases in the first.

47:10.065 --> 47:16.551
You just don't have You don't have the requisite expertise to question this asshole diseases.

47:16.591 --> 47:23.256
Most people don't see using biological fluids most people don't Understand so there's understandable skepticism and that's fair.

47:23.697 --> 47:30.582
But if you it's not really the number of vaccines that you get that matters It's the number of immunological components in vaccines that matter.

47:30.682 --> 47:34.706
So by immunological component, I mean for example a viral protein

47:35.126 --> 47:44.129
He just said it's what matters is the amount of immunological components in a vaccine and I know exactly where he's gonna go.

47:44.149 --> 47:45.950
You know where he's gonna go?

47:46.530 --> 48:00.776
Well, where do you think he's gonna go that the live attenuated vaccines had so much more shit in them than the recombinant vaccines that really only have one protein or two proteins that we chose because we're smart and then the rest is nothing.

48:01.678 --> 48:09.810
So the old vaccines that we used to give people that were live, you know, like Robert Malone said, the yellow fever was one of those vaccines.

48:09.850 --> 48:10.310
Here it comes.

48:13.462 --> 48:15.983
or bacterial protein that induces an immune response.

48:16.023 --> 48:17.444
That's an immunological component.

48:17.744 --> 48:22.466
If you add up all the immunological components in vaccines today, it adds up to about 170.

48:23.226 --> 48:26.487
That's less than the one vaccine that we got a hundred years ago.

48:26.547 --> 48:26.967
Thank you.

48:26.987 --> 48:27.868
Smallpox vaccine.

48:27.928 --> 48:28.448
I knew it.

48:28.488 --> 48:33.290
Largest of the mammalian viruses, which had about 200 immunological components.

48:33.850 --> 48:42.774
200 give or take immunological components in the smallpox vaccine means that, you know, the shit we're doing to our kids, now we can do it all in one afternoon.

48:44.679 --> 48:46.060
Holy crap.

48:46.701 --> 48:52.326
So we have a lesser challenge to the immune system today in vaccines than we did 100 years ago.

48:52.727 --> 48:54.889
So I don't think he understands any of that.

48:55.189 --> 49:00.414
And I think what he brings these things up is look, we're just asking questions and brings up the mercury issue again.

49:00.734 --> 49:06.999
I mean, I was on the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices between 1998 and 2003 when this all came up.

49:07.439 --> 49:08.981
And this has been well studied.

49:09.461 --> 49:20.910
We now have looked at children who get these vaccines that contain this mercury, so-called ethyl mercury preservative, compared it to children who got the same vaccines that didn't contain this mercury-containing preservative.

49:21.291 --> 49:30.238
And you know, because we live on this planet, and that mercury is in the Earth's crust, and that we drink methyl mercury every day, and that we all have methyl mercury in our bloodstreams, all of us,

49:30.798 --> 49:32.339
Methylmercury is an infant formula.

49:32.439 --> 49:33.159
It's in breast milk.

49:33.219 --> 49:35.159
It's anything made from water on this planet.

49:35.399 --> 49:44.582
What you learned about so-called thimerosal, this ethylmercury-containing preservative, is that it doesn't in any way contribute to a detectable amount of mercury in your bloodstream.

49:44.862 --> 49:45.342
You knew that.

49:45.382 --> 49:53.725
And then there's now been nine studies showing that if you get these vaccines as compared to vaccines that don't contain this preservative, there's no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome.

49:53.925 --> 49:57.793
So when he says, well, we're just asking questions, we're just looking, we've already looked at this.

49:57.933 --> 50:00.919
What he's saying is he doesn't trust what's happened before him.

50:02.268 --> 50:07.791
And Dr. Offit, the question about the global impacts of this, first, the U.S.

50:07.871 --> 50:26.440
cutting funding to Gavi, the vaccine alliance, and then this coupled with the fact that for multiple reasons, vaccination rates in many parts of the world, including poorer countries, have come down in part because of- I really think that the Muppet Beaker

50:30.139 --> 50:48.818
the assistant to the scientist on the Muppets would be the ideal Muppet to put in front of him, because their mouths are almost identical, although he doesn't make the beep-beep-beep-beep of vaccine misinformation that spread, and the impact on that on possible future deaths.

50:50.893 --> 50:51.273
Certainly.

50:51.393 --> 50:53.114
I mean, we export our fears.

50:53.394 --> 50:54.715
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:54.755 --> 50:56.436
has been a big exporter of fears.

50:56.456 --> 51:04.199
I mean, since he's been an anti-vaccine activist for 20 years through his program, Children's Health Defense, he puts out... So it's weird, right?

51:04.219 --> 51:07.701
Because they are happy to tell you Robert Malone's name more than one time.

51:07.741 --> 51:11.242
They are happy to tell you that it's Children's Health Defense.

51:11.322 --> 51:12.503
Let me say it very straight.

51:12.983 --> 51:14.544
Children's Health Defense.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.144
So you can find it on the Internet.

51:16.184 --> 51:17.245
Make sure you can look it up.

51:18.294 --> 51:20.157
a lot of misinformation and disinformation.

51:20.517 --> 51:23.220
And so, for example, Samoa is a perfect example.

51:23.701 --> 51:27.025
There was a tragedy in Samoa where- I can't believe it.

51:27.085 --> 51:28.867
Is there something that happened in Samoa?

51:28.908 --> 51:30.049
It's hard for me to remember.

51:30.089 --> 51:31.531
Does anybody ever talk about it?

51:31.591 --> 51:34.735
I think maybe there was a Rolling Stone article or something.

51:34.915 --> 51:35.376
I don't know.

51:35.476 --> 51:36.697
I heard it once somewhere.

51:37.358 --> 51:47.445
Or maybe I heard it a thousand times from every time that this asshole has ever said anything about RFK since RFK started running for president or got appointed anywhere.

51:47.886 --> 51:49.727
It's what everybody says all the time.

51:49.827 --> 51:53.790
Also, Hotez says it because it's a script.

51:56.192 --> 51:57.553
That's why it happened.

51:58.073 --> 52:00.175
That's why there was a Rolling Stone article.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.743
because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:02.783 --> 52:08.515
was always going to be put here so that we could always have this argument and it would never be effective.

52:12.972 --> 52:13.872
I need you to see it.

52:14.113 --> 52:15.413
It's a long con.

52:15.433 --> 52:16.334
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, M.D.:

52:16.334 --> 52:23.697
: The measles, mumps, rubella vaccine is in powdered form there, so you need to dilute it in a or reconstitute it in a diluent.

52:24.418 --> 52:31.401
Two nurses independently made a mistake, where, instead of using just the sort of saltwater diluent that should have been used, they used a muscle relaxant.

52:31.701 --> 52:33.202
They injected independently two

52:33.362 --> 52:44.107
I wonder how dangerous rotavirus is to a successfully breastfeeding mom and her baby, because my guess is it's pretty hard to dehydrate a baby that can drink as much as it wants from mom.

52:44.767 --> 52:46.568
Just following the chat there a little bit.

52:46.588 --> 52:52.371
12-month-old children, both of whom died almost immediately when they stopped breathing.

52:52.871 --> 53:02.897
So what he did immediately through Children's Health Defense, as he said in his website and then elsewhere, a measles vaccine is killing children in Samoa when it wasn't a vaccine at all.

53:03.197 --> 53:04.117
He then went to Samoa.

53:04.397 --> 53:05.938
He met with anti-vaccine activists.

53:06.098 --> 53:06.939
He met with the president.

53:07.239 --> 53:08.660
He tried to, again, influence people.

53:08.940 --> 53:10.120
Measles is killing your children.

53:10.180 --> 53:13.882
Immunization rates dropped from about 75 percent to 30 percent.

53:14.123 --> 53:17.925
And there was a massive measles outbreak in this country of 200,000 people.

53:18.565 --> 53:20.066
Now, it's crazy, right, because

53:21.291 --> 53:23.613
They're both pretty rich professional guys.

53:23.653 --> 53:32.502
They both have a fairly big media presence and they have been saying the same thing for 15 years.

53:32.622 --> 53:40.849
So either it happened like Paul says it happened or it happens like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:40.909 --> 53:41.710
said it happens.

53:42.351 --> 53:44.453
But either way, one of them is lying.

53:45.819 --> 53:47.260
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:47.340 --> 53:52.602
is lying, then this guy should be a lot more pissed off that he's at HHS than he is.

53:55.143 --> 53:56.503
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:56.563 --> 54:07.068
is actually telling the truth and they're exaggerating about his role in that outbreak and what he did or said or speculated about and how much reach he had when he said it,

54:08.069 --> 54:17.595
instead amplifying his role in that to make it seem as though he had that much influence all the way back then that he could get in a Rolling Stone article.

54:18.216 --> 54:18.596
You see?

54:18.616 --> 54:32.545
It's got to be an illusion if they keep agreeing to promote the same things about each other and not really go all the way to you're a liar or you're not a liar.

54:33.166 --> 54:35.027
You're a criminal or you're not a criminal.

54:39.792 --> 54:41.533
You can't have it both ways.

54:41.573 --> 54:53.175
You can't be a lawyer and the son of a very rich family and a very successful nonprofit and also have this guy slandering you and not take the opportunity to put him away.

54:53.195 --> 54:58.376
To take millions of dollars away from him for lying about you.

55:02.137 --> 55:03.437
He won't do it.

55:03.497 --> 55:04.498
Why won't he do it?

55:04.558 --> 55:05.678
Because it's the show.

55:06.960 --> 55:13.804
Robert Malone suing people for $25 million because they said that he said mass psychosis something something.

55:14.525 --> 55:16.446
Come on guys, do you believe that?

55:18.347 --> 55:28.574
Or do you see the absurdity both in Robert Malone suing anyone as a horse breeder and emu farmer turned world savior and Vatican advisor?

55:30.782 --> 55:32.143
That's one side of the absurdity.

55:32.163 --> 55:45.915
The other side of the absurdity is a successful lawyer descended from a very royal family in America being slandered for 10 years by a guy who works at CHOP and doing nothing about it.

55:48.617 --> 55:50.319
Even though he's supposed to be saving the kids.

55:52.130 --> 55:57.593
cases of measles, 83 deaths, mostly in children less than four years of age.

55:57.733 --> 55:59.074
He had a lot to do with that.

55:59.334 --> 56:07.619
So that's what misinformation can do, not only in this country, where we're, again, seeing the biggest measles outbreak we've probably seen in 30 years, but in the world.

56:08.419 --> 56:13.702
So, finally, 30 seconds, how are you responding to this two-day meeting and what's going to come out of it?

56:16.421 --> 56:19.944
You're just standing back and watching what is frankly a clown show.

56:20.104 --> 56:24.148
I mean, I think the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Susan Kressley, said it best.

56:24.248 --> 56:25.750
We're not going to this meeting anymore.

56:25.850 --> 56:26.811
We're ignoring this meeting.

56:26.871 --> 56:35.599
I think most of the medical and scientific community is just seeing this for what it is, which is just another forum for anti-vaccine activists to talk about their misinformation.

56:36.072 --> 56:38.573
Thanks for watching Democracy Now on YouTube.

56:38.813 --> 56:41.534
Subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications.

56:41.554 --> 56:43.054
Oh, it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen.

56:43.074 --> 56:43.674
It definitely gets worse.

56:43.694 --> 56:47.795
The new members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will continue their first week.

56:47.855 --> 57:02.560
So first of all, before you see who are here, who our guest is, I want you to realize that on Brett Weinstein's podcast, him and his illustriously intelligent wife, Heather Haying, were discussing a clip from this video and Heather Haying

57:03.300 --> 57:06.262
didn't know who this guy was, which I think is pretty funny.

57:06.642 --> 57:11.565
I think it shows you exactly who we're dealing with with regard to Brett and Heather Weinstein.

57:12.166 --> 57:17.189
These two are becoming more and more like real frauds every day to me.

57:17.889 --> 57:28.556
Now that they are not being given regular script updates, they are revealing themselves to be real, real like Bush League amateurs.

57:29.076 --> 57:30.958
And they're even having a hard time

57:31.960 --> 57:39.682
pretending to be the biologists that they pretend to be in their very little narrow field of, I don't know, complex systems or some shit like that.

57:39.882 --> 57:41.022
Meeting later today.

57:41.042 --> 57:45.583
The seven newly appointed members of the panel discussed childhood vaccines yesterday.

57:46.184 --> 57:53.085
And joining us now ahead of day two is former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served in the first Trump administration.

57:53.565 --> 57:57.306
He's a board member with Pfizer and Illumina and a CNBC contributor.

57:57.586 --> 57:59.667
And Dr. Gottlieb, thanks for being here.

57:59.707 --> 58:00.027
Thanks a lot.

58:00.327 --> 58:02.110
So walk us through what this means.

58:02.150 --> 58:06.337
There was a lot of fanfare when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:06.458 --> 58:08.201
fired basically the 17 people.

58:08.281 --> 58:12.769
Every time I see him, I really want to do like a soprano's impression and say something like, how you doing?

58:13.928 --> 58:15.970
I know that that's on that vaccine panel before.

58:16.511 --> 58:17.812
There are seven new members.

58:18.032 --> 58:19.093
What are we in for today?

58:19.193 --> 58:24.859
Well, there was eight, but one dropped out because they didn't want to sell his stock, so he couldn't get through the conflicts check.

58:24.919 --> 58:31.046
Look, these are individuals who've been unabashed about their anti-vaccine views, for the most part, the members who've been appointed.

58:31.486 --> 58:32.407
All of them?

58:33.008 --> 58:33.608
Most of them.

58:33.648 --> 58:34.829
I mean, the ones who aren't

58:35.450 --> 58:40.252
You know, sort of considered anti-vaxxers, I think, have been skeptical, at least of the COVID vaccine.

58:40.692 --> 58:44.574
They deferred a lot of the decisions, the controversial decisions, from day one to day two.

58:44.634 --> 58:48.155
So I think day two is when we're going to see some of those sentiments become manifest.

58:48.175 --> 58:50.276
And the two places they're focusing, I think, today

58:51.016 --> 58:55.759
is on the MMR vaccine, which is the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine.

58:55.779 --> 59:02.124
So it's a combined chicken pox MMR vaccine, which has long been a bugaboo of the anti-vax movement because there's a small risk of seizures.

59:02.624 --> 59:08.988
That risk can be fully mitigated if parents check the temperature of children between day 5 and 14 and treat any fever above 100.5.

59:09.028 --> 59:12.811
There's sort of a delayed febrile reaction to that vaccine.

59:13.291 --> 59:15.013
That's a pretty remarkable statement.

59:15.073 --> 59:18.917
So I've heard this one before, but essentially the MMR vaccine is not dangerous.

59:18.997 --> 59:25.343
It's just the dumbass parents after the MMR vaccine aren't really monitoring for fever and they let it go.

59:25.784 --> 59:27.806
And that's why these kids have these problems.

59:30.290 --> 59:31.950
Only about 10% of kids get it.

59:31.971 --> 59:33.051
10% of kids get it?

59:33.111 --> 59:35.412
But anti-vaxxers have wanted to bring this off the market.

59:36.372 --> 59:41.733
The other issue that's going to come up today is thimerosal, which is a preservative that used to be used in vaccines.

59:41.833 --> 59:43.134
It was largely taken out.

59:43.394 --> 59:44.514
I didn't think it was there.

59:44.594 --> 59:44.834
Right.

59:44.874 --> 59:47.335
So this happened when I was at FDA in the early 2000s.

59:47.375 --> 59:53.937
We pulled thimerosal out of the vaccines and moved from multidose vials, where the preservative was, to single dose vials that didn't need a preservative.

59:54.477 --> 01:00:06.142
largely not because we thought Dimerosol was unsafe, but because there was so much speculation among the anti-vax movement that it was linked to autism, we felt we would never get out from under that cloud, so we reformulated those vaccines.

01:00:06.182 --> 01:00:09.844
But it's still in about 4% of vaccines that get delivered.

01:00:10.124 --> 01:00:11.705
So let me get this straight.

01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:16.967
He's on NBC now, and he was part of the FDA when they did this stuff.

01:00:17.007 --> 01:00:19.509
You see how it's just one script.

01:00:20.649 --> 01:00:42.675
and you just couldn't see it because your time horizon is so narrow because of our use of social media but if you could see the plan and knew what it was then you would see why all these people just move from one side of the stage to the other and show up again because it's just a human hamster wheel and the rungs of the hamster wheel are made with these jackasses

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:46.428
in flu vaccines, mostly for adults.

01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:49.729
Most children do not receive a vaccine from the multidose vial.

01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:54.810
But certain clinics still use that multidose vial, about 4% of the administered vaccines.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.491
They want to withdraw that from the market as well.

01:00:58.231 --> 01:01:04.413
The other issue that's going to come up, but I think it's been largely deferred to a subsequent meeting, is that there is a movement among

01:01:05.373 --> 01:01:11.637
the Secretary, Kennedy, and others in the anti-vax movement to take alum out of vaccines.

01:01:11.717 --> 01:01:13.979
So alum is an aluminum salt.

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:18.742
It's used in about seven different pediatric vaccines, including one by Pfizer as an adjuvant.

01:01:18.782 --> 01:01:20.643
So it helps stimulate an immune response.

01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:21.784
Adjuvant.

01:01:22.144 --> 01:01:26.007
I guess that's how you say it when you also eat your Milky Way with a knife and fork.

01:01:27.082 --> 01:01:30.886
So they want to force manufacturers, I believe, to reformulate those vaccines.

01:01:31.327 --> 01:01:34.590
That would be a major issue, because this is a very safe ingredient.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:35.951
It's been used for 70 years.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.653
There's really no alternative.

01:01:38.034 --> 01:01:46.743
And if they force manufacturers to have to reformulate all those pediatric vaccines, I think you'd see a lot of vaccines potentially come off the market, because there is no good alternative.

01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:48.504
meaning that they would no longer be effective.

01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:49.644
They wouldn't stimulate the immune system.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:54.265
There is no good, the other adjuvants that you could potentially use probably aren't as safe.

01:01:54.846 --> 01:01:57.606
The other adjuvants are not so safe, you see.

01:01:58.387 --> 01:02:06.209
And anyway, the hilarious part for me is, again, what he's leaving open is the possibility of what would the alternative be.

01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:10.451
The alternative, of course, would be a personalized mRNA vaccine.

01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:11.551
You know, we could try them all.

01:02:12.952 --> 01:02:17.917
But if you had to reformulate those vaccines, it would create a real dislocation in the market.

01:02:17.998 --> 01:02:20.240
That was supposed to be on the agenda for this meeting.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:20.981
They took it off.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:23.644
So I think they've deferred that discussion by and large.

01:02:24.004 --> 01:02:27.448
But I would expect it could come up today as well as a prelude to future meetings.

01:02:27.873 --> 01:02:31.475
So the MMR and varicella, the idea of treating a fever.

01:02:31.495 --> 01:02:37.618
First of all, I'll say I didn't realize that 10% of kids get a seizure reaction or a fever reaction.

01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:39.639
No, so 10% of kids get the MMR vaccine.

01:02:39.679 --> 01:02:50.965
So most kids who get vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella get the MMR vaccine and a separate varicella vaccine, largely because there is a small risk of febrile seizure associated with the combined vaccine.

01:02:51.485 --> 01:02:52.426
That risk, again, could

01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:57.591
Oh, so the MMRV vaccine has the risk of seizures, I see.

01:02:58.011 --> 01:02:58.952
Be fully mitigated.

01:02:59.372 --> 01:03:06.679
Most parents wouldn't... But don't forget, 15 years ago, Mary Holland started her career as an anti-vaxxer on Democracy Now!

01:03:06.899 --> 01:03:14.707
opposite Paul Offit, saying that one component of, or another, of the untested components in the MMR vaccine, because they're not tested,

01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:28.671
is responsible for the autism in her kid and she has saved no one and moved the needle not one inch since because autism spectrum disorder is a mythology.

01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:32.237
no to check temperature five or 14 days out.

01:03:32.257 --> 01:03:34.558
I was just gonna say, having four kids, I've never heard that.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.939
It's a delayed febrile reaction.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:42.602
That's why some kids get in trouble, because you get a fever day 10, it doesn't get recognized, doesn't get treated, and then you can get into trouble.

01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:49.205
So the people in Kennedy's orbit have wanted to pull this vaccine off the market.

01:03:49.245 --> 01:03:50.206
It is on the agenda.

01:03:50.346 --> 01:03:58.470
I need somebody to vote in the chat about whether if you could touch his hair, would it be wet or would it be crispy, like, you know, hairspray dries?

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.071
Uh, wet or crispy?

01:04:01.211 --> 01:04:03.612
That's what I want to see in the chat today.

01:04:03.812 --> 01:04:05.772
So I think they're either going to vote.

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:09.374
If they pull it off the market, though, you would still be able to get those two vaccines separately.

01:04:09.394 --> 01:04:09.534
Right.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:10.214
You'd still have the alternative.

01:04:10.234 --> 01:04:10.994
MMR and varicella.

01:04:11.154 --> 01:04:18.737
Yeah, I think, you know, if you take a step back, look, if they pull the MMR vaccine, it's not going to have a dramatic impact on availability of vaccines.

01:04:18.777 --> 01:04:23.679
If they pull the multidose vial of the flu vaccine, like I said, it's only 4% of people who get that.

01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:32.433
But I think this is a prelude to them demonstrating their ability to go in with this committee now, make recommendations to pull some of these vaccines and force those decisions.

01:04:33.014 --> 01:04:37.322
And if they're able to do that here, it's setting up a decision around alum.

01:04:38.123 --> 01:04:44.025
Okay, I would say the ones you told me about today don't concern me as much because you'd be able to- But instead, remember what happened, right?

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:45.766
They're making a big deal about it this morning.

01:04:45.806 --> 01:04:52.068
They took all of the thimerosal-containing flu vaccines off of the market.

01:04:52.468 --> 01:04:59.191
We're not gonna use any of the thimerosal-containing flu vaccines anymore, and we're all supposed to be super happy about that.

01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:12.462
I mean, I guess if you've got a five-year-old and you don't want to give them all the shots that you're supposed to be getting, you'd have to take two for the varicella without.

01:05:12.982 --> 01:05:17.727
What... It's the precedent, because it's the idea of ASIP unilaterally acting to do this.

01:05:17.767 --> 01:05:21.971
These are typically decisions that would have been left to regulators to determine the safety and effectiveness.

01:05:22.191 --> 01:05:27.736
ASIP has... Seriously, the best donuts are actually soft and sweaty on the side but crispy on the top.

01:05:27.796 --> 01:05:28.397
I'm not kidding.

01:05:28.877 --> 01:05:32.438
is the capacity to make recommendations about who should and shouldn't get these vaccines.

01:05:32.918 --> 01:05:39.220
But the fact that they're wading into these issues that have long been considered settled science, particularly thimerosal.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.882
I remember the, back in the early 2000s, the bugaboo was that thimerosal was linked to autism.

01:05:45.222 --> 01:05:46.862
We took thimerosal out of the vaccines.

01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:47.662
Everything for children.

01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:48.863
Now they've moved to alum.

01:05:48.923 --> 01:05:51.884
So now the arguments are, well, it must be the aluminum hydroxide.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:56.265
So they're just going to keep chipping away at what's in the vaccines and say, this is what causes autism.

01:05:56.785 --> 01:06:01.628
That's what's been created over the last 10, 15 years, is you just move from one issue to the next.

01:06:01.688 --> 01:06:04.229
And look at how convincing his act is.

01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:13.195
That from the perspective of someone who assumes what I assumed five years ago, that vaccines are just, they just work.

01:06:15.776 --> 01:06:17.737
And that's why they give them at some point.

01:06:18.237 --> 01:06:18.958
I mean, I get it.

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:25.445
But I had my kids in Norway, so nobody was stabbing my kids when they were first born.

01:06:25.525 --> 01:06:28.386
Nobody was advocating for what they needed in the first months.

01:06:28.426 --> 01:06:31.367
They were helping my wife and I learn to breastfeed.

01:06:32.067 --> 01:06:38.529
And only in my third child had here in America did I suddenly realize what in the F is going on here.

01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:43.330
And if it wasn't for the absolute

01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:46.882
How do you say it?

01:06:46.922 --> 01:06:57.916
I mean, insistence that my wife breastfeed my daughter as long as my daughter wanted, that I think my daughter is as healthy as she is, despite the shots that we gave her.

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:04.524
And I think there's a lot of biology to back up that possibility that the immuno

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:19.231
protection and damping that you get from breastfeeding can protect a baby from a lot of exposures that would otherwise cause their immune system to go kilter, off kilter.

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:21.313
Excellent, never get in front of this.

01:07:25.566 --> 01:07:26.807
I wonder what you think.

01:07:26.847 --> 01:07:32.671
I mean, there was a Tyler Winklevoss had a post today on X or maybe last night.

01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:35.654
It was it was related to it was related.

01:07:35.674 --> 01:07:36.955
How do you follow your Bitcoin?

01:07:36.975 --> 01:07:44.120
What's happening in New York City with something about a post on X is not by accident.

01:07:45.421 --> 01:08:00.594
These people are scripted, creating the relevance and maintaining and reinforcing the relevance of those platforms because that's where these narratives are controlled and people are compartmentalized into them.

01:08:02.401 --> 01:08:02.841
the mayor.

01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:05.943
And it's a strange thing for me to see the connection between the two.

01:08:05.983 --> 01:08:11.867
But he basically says, look, you have all of these young voters who don't realize what happens.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:19.152
They don't remember the crime in the cities in the 1980s and the squeegee guys and what happened before.

01:08:19.972 --> 01:08:22.035
you had the crackdown on some of these things.

01:08:22.075 --> 01:08:34.432
So he thinks it's a bad idea for this mayor to get elected, but he says maybe it's what they need to see, a little bit of socialism to see what the outcome is and what that might mean for safety on the streets.

01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:36.455
And I wonder if it's the same story with vaccines.

01:08:36.495 --> 01:08:37.156
People forget

01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:53.108
Wow, so now she's saying that just like with electing a socialist mayor in New York City might be the lesson these people have to learn, maybe getting rid of some vaccines and having people die from disease again is a lesson that people have to learn.

01:08:53.228 --> 01:08:54.028
Holy shit.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:57.371
If you don't think this is scripted... I'd like to have measles run rampant.

01:08:57.431 --> 01:08:58.572
People forget what it was like.

01:08:58.632 --> 01:09:00.753
Even chicken pox, which you can survive.

01:09:00.793 --> 01:09:02.254
I mean, I had chicken pox as a kid.

01:09:02.294 --> 01:09:03.035
It's a bad disease.

01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:03.955
It's a bad disease.

01:09:04.216 --> 01:09:05.016
You don't want to see

01:09:07.037 --> 01:09:08.258
It's not a bad disease.

01:09:08.818 --> 01:09:09.779
It's so stupid.

01:09:09.999 --> 01:09:11.080
It's not a bad disease.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.941
You just gotta not pick the scabs.

01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:14.322
Come on, this is so stupid.

01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:17.564
All of these childhood diseases that we have forgotten what they do.

01:09:18.565 --> 01:09:27.731
Yeah, you certainly don't want to see that happen, that there is a backlash to this anti-vax movement because we've seen the consequences of it because a lot of people are going to be harmed in the process.

01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:35.296
But the problem is that the... Okay, now, if you don't believe that this is scripted bullshit, like you don't believe that these guys are scripted bullshit, right?

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:36.397
Let me remind you

01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:59.291
First of all, that the CDC, after many, many years of allowing doctors, even encouraging doctors to prescribe opiates in a way that were never prescribed before, because they're commercial opiates, because the commercial grade opiates are not as addictive as their natural counterparts.

01:10:01.718 --> 01:10:03.619
that they can be prescribed.

01:10:03.739 --> 01:10:15.046
And so in a world where when I grew up, prescribing Valium was something that you almost didn't do on purpose because you didn't want to take any risks with somebody like that.

01:10:16.427 --> 01:10:23.631
Now we went through an era where prescription opioids were a way for chronic pain to be solved.

01:10:23.711 --> 01:10:30.315
People in motorcycle accidents, back pain, whatever neglect in their adult life could be fixed.

01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:33.303
and we let it go wild.

01:10:34.323 --> 01:10:37.145
We let at least one company make a lot of money.

01:10:39.307 --> 01:10:54.217
And then the CDC decided to change the directive at the same time that they changed the penalties and the methods of watching pharmacies and doctors prescribe and distribute these substances.

01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:58.440
And so going from a free-for-all to controlled

01:11:00.439 --> 01:11:26.015
with substances as powerful as opioids created a situation among a, let's say, forgotten section of the population, a pitiless section of the population that put them in a crucial situation once that policy change traveled through the system and resulted in them having to find another means of coping with their pain.

01:11:28.666 --> 01:11:40.469
And I try to remind you over and over again that at the same time, Donald Trump decided that he was going to crack down and make sure that opioid overdoses would go down, that this was not going to happen anymore.

01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:51.251
Because what was happening during that free-for-all was that pills were being given to people in too large of quantities so that they could give them to other people, that they could sell them.

01:11:52.512 --> 01:11:58.253
Pharmacists and pharmacies were losing them and selling them because they were there.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.421
And people wanted him.

01:12:02.082 --> 01:12:04.183
Now, make no mistake about it.

01:12:04.944 --> 01:12:16.091
I'm suggesting that this is a long con, and that means that people needed to be put in place, including people on the internet to put the right memes out there.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:25.778
And so remember, this guy, this guy who's at the head of the FDA, that guy over there, that child, Vinayak, his head of CBER,

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.143
And they were doing podcasts with this asshole.

01:12:32.429 --> 01:12:33.051
This asshole.

01:12:43.041 --> 01:13:02.439
No appointment, I walk into your clinic Complaining of pain, doctor shopping once again When I found you I thought, oh my god, you really get me And your last name's followed by an MD You're my ticket to ecstasy Uh, I mean pain relief

01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:22.275
Stethoscope, coat and tie I can play you like the lottery Tears flow, crocodile As I tell you about my three slipped discs Chronic migraine, RSD, and abdominal pain I define secondary gain Did I mention I have allergies to Toradol and Motrin?

01:13:22.555 --> 01:13:24.537
Don't try to give me no NSAIDs

01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:27.360
Won't take a seat to mend a fin.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.942
You ain't dealing with a novice, son.

01:13:30.223 --> 01:13:32.425
My pain scale starts at 10.

01:13:32.705 --> 01:13:34.928
Got a long list of ex-doctors.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.690
They'll tell you I need help.

01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:42.716
Just give me my pain meds, baby, or I'll screw you on you.

01:13:42.776 --> 01:13:43.236
I was young.

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:44.217
I was reckless.

01:13:45.308 --> 01:14:02.615
I took things way too far Never thought I'd get addicted Now I'm higher than a shooting star I've got a long list of ex-doctors They'll tell you I'm insane You've got a blank script, baby And I've got some pain

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:24.627
through my clothes and my brain doesn't want to work it's not running down my nose stomach cramping I got the squirts I puke to my throat's raw this must be what it's like to withdraw wait the worst is yet to come

01:14:29.821 --> 01:14:34.804
I don't know how to explain what I see here other than to know that if this is your audition

01:15:00.342 --> 01:15:02.483
You are one malevolent asshole.

01:15:03.423 --> 01:15:07.085
If this is your audition, you are not a patriotic American.

01:15:07.826 --> 01:15:11.807
You are celebrating something that shouldn't be celebrated.

01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:17.790
And he's also right on script with the cross-dressing.

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:18.631
You know, why not?

01:15:18.811 --> 01:15:19.511
It's 2015.

01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:22.512
It's really a sketch right now.

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:25.174
You know, it's really risque or nouveau or whatever.

01:15:25.194 --> 01:15:26.314
I don't know what they would call it.

01:15:31.357 --> 01:15:33.180
It's scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:39.390
These people have been auditioning for a very, very long time, and they've been put in place because that's how this works.

01:15:42.014 --> 01:15:42.755
Thanks for being here.

01:15:42.795 --> 01:15:43.737
I'll see you guys in a minute.

01:19:50.403 --> 01:19:50.484
you

01:20:19.246 --> 01:20:19.346
do

01:21:07.118 --> 01:21:09.671
Let's see here if I can do something like that.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.117
Welcome to the second half of the show.

01:21:13.197 --> 01:21:15.758
This is obviously scripted bullshit here.

01:21:15.798 --> 01:21:19.940
We know that already for a while, that Bret Weinstein is nothing but scripted bullshit.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.421
I'm calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:27.483
And of course, we know that back in 2022... He actually gave me some insistence, and I think he's right.

01:21:27.763 --> 01:21:31.145
I'm calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:21:31.425 --> 01:21:40.069
Heather already admitted that they were talking to me for quite some time there, already in a signal chat with me for quite some time, where they learned almost everything that you know.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:47.480
by the end of 2021 and they went on to ignore me for going on five years now.

01:21:48.984 --> 01:21:58.770
And really fraudulently representing themselves as people that are somehow making useful progress when in fact They are sticking to the script that Robert Malone has provided them now.

01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:14.480
I just want to show you how far this absurd bullshit acting has gone on their new set with the Shit-rolling beetle right in front of them and and it's it's pretty remarkable so let me just switch back down here and

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.644
I'll make my head a little smaller and let's be entertained.

01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:27.431
Are you kidding me?

01:22:29.013 --> 01:22:30.174
Did I really not do that?

01:22:30.454 --> 01:22:32.296
Okay, I forgot to move this one up.

01:22:32.396 --> 01:22:33.137
Sorry about that.

01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:36.340
There we go.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.621
I should start now.

01:22:39.815 --> 01:22:41.616
Yeah, so I didn't start it exactly.

01:22:41.636 --> 01:22:42.797
It's going to go back a little bit.

01:22:42.877 --> 01:22:49.703
So much going on, and frankly, I think there are some interesting connections between topics that do not seem in any way connected.

01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:52.105
This is like a day ago, okay?

01:22:52.325 --> 01:22:53.826
So this is very recently.

01:22:53.926 --> 01:22:55.687
This is state-of-the-art.

01:22:56.568 --> 01:23:01.532
understanding of what's happening with the enchantment called the Health Freedom Movement.

01:23:01.593 --> 01:23:09.479
Remember that from our perspective the Health Freedom Movement doesn't exist really anywhere except for in the place where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:18.587
is or where a significant number of these jackasses get together or maybe at best can be described as existing only on social media.

01:23:19.468 --> 01:23:21.890
Let us start with the

01:23:24.335 --> 01:23:31.680
remarkable facts of Bobby Kennedy's testimony in Congress.

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.122
There were a couple of interesting moments.

01:23:36.223 --> 01:23:50.653
Let me say there was one extraordinary moment in which he pushes back on a committee member regarding an apparent change of stance that they had since they had last discussed an issue.

01:23:50.853 --> 01:23:51.513
Jen, do you want to

01:23:52.734 --> 01:23:53.335
show that.

01:23:53.475 --> 01:23:54.736
So they do have a producer.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:24:00.722
I think Jen also does their outfits and their hair and that's why Brett's hair looks so spectacular.

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:06.207
It's almost like he brings a blow dryer to the gym if he went to the gym.

01:24:06.327 --> 01:24:15.876
But the producer is named Jen and Jen doesn't really have much of a script because later on she's not going to know what video he wants.

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:16.497
Video?

01:24:19.844 --> 01:24:24.386
And I'll address you, Congressman Pallone.

01:24:24.406 --> 01:24:26.027
15 years ago, you and I met.

01:24:26.167 --> 01:24:31.770
You were, at that time, a champion for people who had suffered injuries from vaccines.

01:24:32.811 --> 01:24:34.132
You were very adamant about it.

01:24:34.232 --> 01:24:36.593
You were the leading member of Congress on that issue.

01:24:37.493 --> 01:24:44.237
Since then, you've accepted $2 million from pharmaceutical companies in contribution, more than any other member of this committee.

01:24:45.338 --> 01:24:47.319
And your enthusiasm for

01:24:49.170 --> 01:25:00.559
supporting the old ACIP committee, which was completely rife and pervasive with pharmaceutical conflicts, seems to be an outcome of those contributions.

01:25:01.239 --> 01:25:02.640
Mr. Chairman, point of order.

01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:04.402
Point of order.

01:25:04.802 --> 01:25:05.583
Point of order.

01:25:05.723 --> 01:25:09.085
The gentleman is impugning the reputation of a member of Congress.

01:25:13.689 --> 01:25:14.950
Stop the clock.

01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:16.871
Stop the clock for a second.

01:25:17.352 --> 01:25:18.753
Can you state the point of order?

01:25:19.926 --> 01:25:20.086
Yeah.

01:25:21.187 --> 01:25:23.029
He was impugning Mr. Pallone.

01:25:23.049 --> 01:25:24.910
Mr. Chairman, I didn't hear it.

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:26.772
Oh, you weren't paying attention.

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:27.352
That's why.

01:25:27.572 --> 01:25:30.575
Well, you know, it's hard to pay attention here when we're not getting any response.

01:25:30.695 --> 01:25:30.815
OK.

01:25:33.397 --> 01:25:33.597
All right.

01:25:33.977 --> 01:25:35.939
Now, I find that utterly extraordinary.

01:25:36.059 --> 01:25:38.961
That is not the way committee hearings usually go.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.275
I have not seen the full clip.

01:25:41.315 --> 01:25:42.156
Who is he responding?

01:25:42.196 --> 01:25:42.896
Who is he addressing?

01:25:43.297 --> 01:25:45.298
Is he addressing either of the people who are speaking there?

01:25:46.299 --> 01:25:49.362
That I couldn't tell you, but what he's doing... Think about that.

01:25:49.682 --> 01:25:57.088
He's representing, he understands what this context is, but he doesn't know who he's arguing with or whether he was arguing with one of the people speaking there.

01:25:58.590 --> 01:26:08.378
This is the level of bullshit that these people are portraying as five years of evolution as people on the internet who are trying to save America.

01:26:10.515 --> 01:26:15.519
These are scripted bullshitters and of the worst kind because they are traitors.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.805
To many Americans who tried to get out and are still trying to get out, they are traitors.

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:37.953
is he is pointing out the degree of corruption and then the pandemonium that breaks out in the committee that is not sure how to handle this.

01:26:38.033 --> 01:26:41.735
I mean, is this Secretary?

01:26:41.795 --> 01:26:46.957
Also, most of the data from Christine's to Bell-Benn is actually on the DTP vaccine.

01:26:46.997 --> 01:26:53.760
So you are not wrong when you suggest that the MMR could have easily been something they focused on

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.322
as a way of focusing on something that worked.

01:26:58.243 --> 01:26:59.284
Yes, I'm gonna say it.

01:26:59.424 --> 01:27:04.228
Maybe the measles vaccine works or maybe the rubella vaccine works.

01:27:04.328 --> 01:27:08.891
I don't know, but just think about that.

01:27:09.652 --> 01:27:13.915
And it's not a terrible thought to have because that's how this game is played.

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:17.258
And they run you into that wall as fast as you can go.

01:27:17.738 --> 01:27:21.381
Sprint into the wall, into the tunnel.

01:27:23.018 --> 01:27:31.222
That's exactly what Polly, Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield, and Brian Hooker, and Mary Holland, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:31.242 --> 01:27:32.403
have caused to happen.

01:27:34.163 --> 01:27:38.546
Where all these patriots who thought they were fighting for something ran into the wall.

01:27:40.006 --> 01:27:41.387
The Health Freedom Movement.

01:27:44.988 --> 01:27:54.411
the secretary of the largest department in the federal government entitled to go after a member of Congress over... Is that true?

01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:55.071
What you just said?

01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:55.652
Yeah.

01:27:55.692 --> 01:27:56.792
Largest department in the federal government?

01:27:56.812 --> 01:27:57.612
Larger than defense?

01:27:57.652 --> 01:27:57.932
Yes.

01:27:58.713 --> 01:27:59.693
Amazingly enough.

01:27:59.713 --> 01:28:00.833
HHS is larger than defense?

01:28:00.914 --> 01:28:04.255
I know, it's... How in the Sam hell can she not know that?

01:28:07.376 --> 01:28:12.598
Her husband has been as far as Romania to try and save humanity from this Goliath.

01:28:15.558 --> 01:28:24.584
How can she not know that this highly complicated but not complex system, the biggest functioning part of it is HHS?

01:28:25.085 --> 01:28:28.007
How is it possible unless she's a fraud?

01:28:29.648 --> 01:28:36.213
Unless they're both scripted frauds and she's even more clueless than this jackass.

01:28:38.612 --> 01:28:39.593
incredible, but it is.

01:28:40.213 --> 01:28:43.696
So in any case, is he allowed to do this?

01:28:43.876 --> 01:28:49.000
Well, on the one hand, you might imagine that it's very impolite and that we don't do impolite things.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.423
And so now they're going to have a 10-minute discussion about how, in fact, it's great.

01:28:52.463 --> 01:28:53.904
This is exactly what we wanted.

01:28:53.924 --> 01:28:56.086
We got somebody in there calling shit out.

01:28:56.586 --> 01:29:04.052
So again, because these people are on script, it's not very surprising that they actually don't realize that this particular little

01:29:05.133 --> 01:29:17.986
bait-and-switch on an irreducibly complex genetic background was pulled to be timed extremely well with an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and then sculpted with manslaughter and lies.

01:29:18.907 --> 01:29:22.851
Of course they're not gonna know that because they are scripted fools.

01:29:23.531 --> 01:29:24.933
They only know what they're told.

01:29:25.313 --> 01:29:26.995
They only know what the script says.

01:29:28.174 --> 01:29:43.702
And because the script was given to them by people that they believe have super connections or super powers or are connected to the Venetian elite, then they believe that every time they get a script update, they just better stick to it because so far, every bet has won.

01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:48.905
And so these two biological frauds,

01:29:49.980 --> 01:30:03.528
these absolute fraud of human beings, some of the shittiest Americans alive right now, are simply unaware that there is population pyramid data, that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality coming.

01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:10.291
And so not only was it timed with that, but it was timed with that so the minimum amount of murder and lies would be required.

01:30:10.731 --> 01:30:17.435
The minimum amount of manslaughter and lies would be required because the dam was already gonna overflow for a few years.

01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:18.636
Don't you understand?

01:30:19.909 --> 01:30:28.612
And so it didn't take very much more than supplementary oxygen and one bullshit trial like Grace Shara's trial in order to hide it all.

01:30:33.233 --> 01:30:37.155
And now we have a template for how to fight this and it's a losing template.

01:30:37.215 --> 01:30:43.377
So thanks a lot, Scott and Mr. Mendenhall and Bobby and Cox and all the other failures.

01:30:46.581 --> 01:30:49.342
because I guess now we're just gonna get the story out anyway.

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:50.383
What's the story?

01:30:51.043 --> 01:30:55.845
The story is manslaughter by oxygen, manslaughter by protocols.

01:30:55.965 --> 01:30:58.306
The story is not informed consent.

01:30:58.746 --> 01:31:00.487
The story is consent.

01:31:02.147 --> 01:31:10.951
And so I'm gonna help Scott out here by saying, Scott, your main message is that once you go into a hospital, you have given consent for them to kill you.

01:31:12.352 --> 01:31:13.973
And so don't go into hospitals anymore.

01:31:14.013 --> 01:31:14.433
There you go.

01:31:14.513 --> 01:31:17.134
Now you don't need to do 4,000 more hours of research.

01:31:18.114 --> 01:31:23.677
Now you don't need to start a new crusade or another new nonprofit, Scott.

01:31:24.077 --> 01:31:30.060
You can just tell people not to go to hospitals without some arrangement with consent.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.862
Because if you don't have an arrangement with consent, then consent will be implied.

01:31:35.902 --> 01:31:38.003
This is consent to do things.

01:31:38.063 --> 01:31:40.023
This is not informed consent.

01:31:40.443 --> 01:31:47.685
And so I think, Scott, your lawyers have fucked you up in the head about what informed consent is versus what giving consent is.

01:31:48.066 --> 01:31:51.346
And informed consent is not something that is in the law.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.608
There's no informed consent about going to the doctor.

01:31:55.648 --> 01:32:00.509
The doctor doesn't have to make sure you understand exactly what he's gonna do before he can do it.

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:03.110
You have to give consent.

01:32:04.119 --> 01:32:09.805
Informed consent is a principle that any moral and just person would insist on.

01:32:13.008 --> 01:32:20.696
But it's not something that's guaranteed in very many laws and certainly not part of HIPAA or something like, this is all part of the fraud.

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:27.763
That's why Grace Shar's case was so promoted by CHD, because it was burnt on purpose.

01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:31.393
Anyway, it's okay.

01:32:31.413 --> 01:32:32.454
Maybe it's stuff.

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.916
It's really a powerful.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.838
Are you making new in favor?

01:32:36.858 --> 01:32:37.158
Okay.

01:32:37.238 --> 01:32:39.940
That's very nice in favor of making dump that out again.

01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:41.542
So absolutely what we voted for.

01:32:41.642 --> 01:32:43.243
And you know, just so beautiful.

01:32:43.604 --> 01:32:52.712
On the other hand, in the same hearing, we also have this other announcement, which caught the entire medical freedom movement off guard.

01:32:53.433 --> 01:32:56.015
Um, so let's, uh, let's play that.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.102
the wearables, yeah.

01:33:05.623 --> 01:33:14.529
Secretary Kenney, my first question is that there is a tremendous amount of research that shows that greater engagement with one's health leads to better outcomes.

01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:28.599
In recent years, American innovators have created and improved wearable devices so that not only are consumers able to better engage with their health through monitoring data, but they are able to share that data with providers.

01:33:29.588 --> 01:33:37.539
I believe American consumers, in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, should be able to access these innovative wellness tools.

01:33:37.599 --> 01:33:42.266
Secretary Kennedy, do you agree that consumers should continue to have access to these tools?

01:33:43.157 --> 01:33:43.757
Absolutely.

01:33:43.817 --> 01:33:54.839
In fact, we're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history to encourage Americans to use wearables.

01:33:55.319 --> 01:33:58.980
It's a way people can take control of their own health.

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.021
I had an Apple Watch while I was doing JC on the Bike and before.

01:34:04.161 --> 01:34:11.342
So when I was biking to and from the University of Pittsburgh from Shaler, which was about eight and a half or nine miles through the hills,

01:34:12.203 --> 01:34:14.008
on an electric bike that I had to pedal.

01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:27.160
I had this, you know, thing for my iWatch and it had two spikes in it every day where I, you know, had this incredible half an hour of cardio.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.140
It was awesome.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:34.161
And a lot about having that data can be very motivating.

01:34:34.261 --> 01:34:41.242
A lot of that, you know, just being able to scroll backward and see a calendar with a bunch of red dots on it is also very motivating.

01:34:41.722 --> 01:34:44.483
And so a lot of ways these claims are not wrong.

01:34:45.233 --> 01:34:50.521
You know, knowing what your glucose level is, especially if you're a diabetic, is not a bad thing.

01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:52.123
It's nice to know that stuff.

01:34:52.203 --> 01:34:53.686
It's interesting.

01:34:53.766 --> 01:34:55.949
It's whatever, but it's not curing anything.

01:34:56.049 --> 01:34:57.912
It's not forwarding anything.

01:34:57.972 --> 01:35:00.576
And more importantly, it's creating data.

01:35:02.011 --> 01:35:13.881
Now, what you need to understand right now, and I know it's going to be hard, but I think I can make these points over the next year or so and get people to understand it, is that this is iterations.

01:35:13.901 --> 01:35:20.346
You got to go on longer time horizons before they can collect the real data that they want.

01:35:21.027 --> 01:35:25.569
They need to establish an infrastructure that allows them to collect the data.

01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:28.311
They need to, wow, that's incredible, dude.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:29.231
I don't know what to say.

01:35:29.512 --> 01:35:30.272
That's awesome.

01:35:30.312 --> 01:35:30.912
Just set it here.

01:35:30.952 --> 01:35:31.333
It's fine.

01:35:31.473 --> 01:35:31.993
Or on the floor.

01:35:33.953 --> 01:35:35.034
The kid makes coffee.

01:35:35.094 --> 01:35:36.075
Thank you very much, sir.

01:35:37.716 --> 01:35:52.328
It is hard really to imagine that anybody is going to be getting useful data from glucose measurements or from heart rate, but what you're doing is establishing the network of devices

01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:55.371
that would be necessary to collect that data.

01:35:55.411 --> 01:36:05.679
And you're establishing the network of connectivity, the network of storage, and the potential, you know, what can we process on this device?

01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:09.662
What can we process after this device puts the data farther?

01:36:10.223 --> 01:36:15.747
All of that stuff has to be tested through many iterations before they're going to be ready for what?

01:36:20.322 --> 01:36:24.544
before they're gonna be ready to collect data from something that's implanted.

01:36:26.485 --> 01:36:38.810
Before they're gonna be ready to collect data from several things implanted in you, feed that data back to a local computer that would then have the connectivity to feed that data in real time back to the cloud.

01:36:39.851 --> 01:36:48.535
And the cloud didn't exist five years ago because they're building it now, not for our videos, not for all the photos on your iPhone.

01:36:50.327 --> 01:36:57.333
It is to establish the infrastructure necessary to collect data from caged experimental animals.

01:36:59.615 --> 01:37:09.763
The wireless communication necessary, the local processing necessary, the local transmission necessary, and the local low range transmission, right?

01:37:09.903 --> 01:37:12.265
Bluetooth isn't about earphones, kids.

01:37:13.783 --> 01:37:25.315
Bluetooth earphones are about getting you to accept the low amplitude, low energy signals that Bluetooth is using so that when they're used for all these other things, you won't give a shit.

01:37:30.321 --> 01:37:32.163
It's the boiling of the frog here.

01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:40.217
And so they're going to get us all excited because KC means and Cali means have conflicts of interest because they have wearables.

01:37:40.837 --> 01:37:49.799
And so they're going to benefit a lot from, you know, getting to be like, like, like they're, they're, they're like Surgeon General and stuff.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.181
They can take responsibility.

01:37:55.221 --> 01:38:03.063
They can see, as you know, what food is doing to their glucose levels, their heart rates, and a number of other metrics as they eat it.

01:38:04.454 --> 01:38:11.162
And they can begin to make good judgments about their diet, about their physical activity, about the way that they live their lives.

01:38:12.383 --> 01:38:18.309
We think that wearables are a key to the Maha agenda of making America healthy again.

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:24.897
My vision is that every American is wearing a wearable within four years.

01:38:27.344 --> 01:38:33.690
All right, now, I will tell you there was just a wave of shock that ran through the medical freedom movement.

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:37.633
A wave of shock ran through the health freedom movement.

01:38:37.653 --> 01:38:44.339
A lot like a wave goes around a stadium in the old days, you know, like in the fans when they do the wave.

01:38:44.739 --> 01:38:47.742
It was just like that, except it went through the health freedom movement.

01:38:47.822 --> 01:38:48.362
I felt it.

01:38:48.823 --> 01:38:50.084
It went right under my chair.

01:38:52.023 --> 01:39:09.158
at hearing this announcement about not only a favorable view of wearables, which, you know, reasonable people could disagree about that, but the universality of it, the idea that every American should be wearing one within four years.

01:39:09.718 --> 01:39:14.783
Now, I've done a lot of thinking about it since I've seen that, and I must tell you, I have mixed emotions here.

01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:18.186
You know, well, here's the thing.

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:25.415
I wasn't brought into the administration.

01:39:25.816 --> 01:39:26.758
I totally get that.

01:39:27.078 --> 01:39:32.892
You can only have a certain number of skunks at the garden party, and I'm probably better out here, you know.

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:37.515
He's sad that he didn't get invited into the administration.

01:39:37.555 --> 01:39:38.816
He should be at HHS.

01:39:39.176 --> 01:39:42.497
I'm convinced he should be like assistant to the director of NIH.

01:39:42.737 --> 01:39:48.680
But I don't know if Bobby Kennedy realizes this, but I have 50 years experience with advertising.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.081
And I did not get a phone call on their campaign.

01:39:52.121 --> 01:40:02.345
And I'm a little hurt, because with 50 years experience in advertising, mostly avoiding advertising, but nonetheless, 50 years of experience with advertising, I think I have some insight into how to sell this wearables campaign.

01:40:02.365 --> 01:40:03.606
But my phone is not ringing.

01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:08.707
Um, so I want to unveil a kind of a prototype of a campaign.

01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:13.909
Uh, so I have a, I've developed a spokesperson, well, spokes creature.

01:40:14.429 --> 01:40:14.629
Okay.

01:40:14.649 --> 01:40:18.270
This is a Warner's the wearables werewolf.

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:20.691
He didn't check with Heather Warner.

01:40:20.971 --> 01:40:25.292
He didn't check with Heather and he, his, uh, she's doesn't find this funny.

01:40:25.812 --> 01:40:27.032
It's later than you think.

01:40:28.093 --> 01:40:31.854
So I think that that's gonna put a lot of wearables on a lot of people.

01:40:32.774 --> 01:40:33.014
You don't.

01:40:34.011 --> 01:40:35.972
you don't feel favorable about this idea.

01:40:39.393 --> 01:40:40.314
All right.

01:40:40.494 --> 01:40:47.297
So I mean, number one, this is the use of AI as art, right?

01:40:47.357 --> 01:40:48.718
He can't draw this picture.

01:40:49.775 --> 01:40:57.997
He, he, so he, he used AI to do something and then he's making a very, very bad dad joke that he probably didn't even make up himself, but it gets worse.

01:40:58.677 --> 01:41:06.419
In any case, I do think that there's room for, you know, uh, honesty in advertising and, uh, a werewolf is the perfect spokesperson for that was hot.

01:41:06.739 --> 01:41:09.980
Uh, spokes caned really.

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:10.720
Yeah.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.421
Spokes caned.

01:41:12.241 --> 01:41:12.301
Um,

01:41:13.277 --> 01:41:23.462
Now, I will say also, wearables, you know, the idea of every single American having a wearable in four years, I think, is preposterous.

01:41:24.703 --> 01:41:28.365
It runs counter, I think, to many of the things that Kennedy believes.

01:41:28.405 --> 01:41:33.147
There are, of course, cases in which a wearable is a perfectly appropriate tool.

01:41:34.208 --> 01:41:39.470
Jen, you want to show the image of the use case that I actually think wearables are perfectly justifiable?

01:41:40.451 --> 01:41:41.091
It's a little dark.

01:41:43.206 --> 01:41:44.367
He's wearing an ankle monitor.

01:41:44.487 --> 01:41:45.648
That's Anthony Fauci.

01:41:45.948 --> 01:41:47.169
So another use of A.I.

01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:56.237
here to make a picture of Anthony Fauci wearing an ankle monitor again, thinking he's very clever, surprising his wife with his cleverness.

01:41:59.091 --> 01:42:06.415
Again, it's very hard to see this as anything other than people who used to be scripted and now aren't.

01:42:07.516 --> 01:42:13.379
And that lack of script is really, wow, they are clowns.

01:42:13.639 --> 01:42:14.359
He's wearing an ankle.

01:42:14.399 --> 01:42:15.440
Oh, this is AI again.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.603
Yeah, this is an image I mocked up to show a use case that I think these things would be valuable in.

01:42:21.303 --> 01:42:25.785
But OK, so jokes aside, let's get to the heart of the matter here.

01:42:26.305 --> 01:42:34.229
First of all, there is an interesting connection that I think we need to be aware of and trying to understand what Kennedy is up to here.

01:42:35.509 --> 01:42:39.671
And I will make an argument for what I suspect is going on a little later on.

01:42:39.711 --> 01:42:39.831
But

01:42:42.105 --> 01:42:42.925
It is the case.

01:42:43.045 --> 01:42:48.268
Let me summarize first by telling you that in the end, he's going to tell you that it's 5D chess and he trusts Kennedy.

01:42:48.348 --> 01:42:52.129
Kennedy's giving something to get something with the wearables.

01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.890
I shit you not.

01:42:53.943 --> 01:43:05.715
that the nominee for Surgeon General, Casey Means, is actually the founder or one of the founders of a company in which wearables are a key element.

01:43:05.735 --> 01:43:09.018
So she is the founder of a company called Levels.

01:43:09.618 --> 01:43:14.323
Can we show the screenshot of this is the tagline at the top of the level?

01:43:14.343 --> 01:43:15.925
So now he's promoting their company.

01:43:17.985 --> 01:43:18.405
website.

01:43:18.446 --> 01:43:21.047
It says, uh become an expert in your own health.

01:43:21.207 --> 01:43:31.635
Levels helps you understand your body through comprehensive lab testing, glucose monitoring, and AI powered habit tracking so you can take daily action and improve what matters most.

01:43:32.495 --> 01:43:38.499
Now, what I wanna uh and uh here's uh another another one on their website.

01:43:38.519 --> 01:43:39.400
It says, uh reach your

01:43:43.903 --> 01:43:45.504
Oh yeah, I might've stopped it there, sorry.

01:43:45.544 --> 01:44:00.534
So I have one more video to watch of them, but it's not very surprising then that this group of people, this group, this, this husband and wife couple that in 2020, in 2020 was talking about a lab leak.

01:44:01.275 --> 01:44:10.721
In 2021 had Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone on his podcast right before they went on Joe Rogan's podcast.

01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:17.138
In 2022, already had talked to me for a year.

01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:24.944
And so the reason why Brett Weinstein hasn't gotten anywhere is because he's on a script.

01:44:25.705 --> 01:44:32.069
He was chosen because his dad was involved at the same table as Bobby Kennedy's dad.

01:44:33.871 --> 01:44:37.934
The updating of the FDA with Estes Kefauver's work.

01:44:39.298 --> 01:44:40.558
and the thalidomide scandal.

01:44:40.598 --> 01:44:41.939
It's all one story.

01:44:41.999 --> 01:44:49.220
That's why these bozo biologists are never going to tell you that endemicity is a myth as a process and an endpoint.

01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:54.221
They can't even explain that idea to you because it's not in their script at all.

01:44:54.261 --> 01:45:01.543
Their script depends on this being both an accepted phenomenon as a process and an endpoint.

01:45:03.353 --> 01:45:21.006
That's also why they're never going to tell you that the PCR tests were bullshit because they had no means of differentiating from the rest of the irreducibly complex background of genetic signals that they would have had to differentiate from in order to be a high-fidelity diagnostic.

01:45:22.247 --> 01:45:28.852
They still believe that we should use their tests to find their ghosts because their ghosts are real and because they are Ghostbusters.

01:45:30.153 --> 01:45:31.654
That's why they talk like this.

01:45:34.045 --> 01:45:34.265
things.

01:45:34.666 --> 01:45:40.153
One, it's always your best option, but you cannot arbitrarily start it late.

01:45:40.494 --> 01:45:48.404
The point is, you may get a tumor because of something you were exposed to, and then, you know, the surgeon may well be your best option, or maybe even the chemo.

01:45:49.085 --> 01:46:03.917
But the point is, your best option was to live in such a way that you were exposed to mutagens that were only of the sort that your body is well accustomed to dealing with evolutionarily, not the novel stuff that we're constantly exposing them to.

01:46:05.888 --> 01:46:08.931
The other thing, though, is you... I'm trying to remember your formulation.

01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:13.354
You said something about you cannot transhuman your way out of this.

01:46:13.475 --> 01:46:14.596
Yeah.

01:46:14.676 --> 01:46:15.556
I think you're right there.

01:46:15.596 --> 01:46:21.441
And the idea is you can't transcend your humanity out of it.

01:46:21.461 --> 01:46:21.842
That's right.

01:46:22.002 --> 01:46:27.447
So the question is, is it transhuman or are we going to humanize our way out of it?

01:46:28.087 --> 01:46:41.196
I mean he really thinks he's like Robert Frost right here you know he's like cracking the puzzle and rearranging these words is the way that he's going to crack the puzzle and he's super proud of himself because he's never said anything freaking profound in his whole life

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:50.325
He's never said anything profound, you know, like opioids can reduce the life expectancy of a country all by themselves.

01:46:50.725 --> 01:46:54.986
He's never said anything profound, you know, like RNA can't pandemic, actually.

01:46:55.386 --> 01:47:00.528
He's never said anything profound, you know, like endemicity is a myth, both as a process and an endpoint.

01:47:00.848 --> 01:47:06.230
He's never said anything profound, like transfection would have always been a crime if you'd have just told me what it was.

01:47:08.531 --> 01:47:13.514
They can't say anything profound because they're on a shitty script.

01:47:15.575 --> 01:47:15.775
Right?

01:47:15.835 --> 01:47:25.681
Going back to an environment in which we are well suited is a reasonable thing and you don't need to understand the details of the complex system to get there.

01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:30.744
You need to understand the distortions to the environment and how to mitigate their influence.

01:47:31.284 --> 01:47:57.656
and the benefit there is that if you if you can understand the distortions and mitigate their influence as you so understanding the distortion and mitigating their influence let me just help you be catch you up to the bullshit level that they're at here they're trying to explain to you that you're supposed to be a naked hunter-gatherer hanging out with like 30 people wearing skins

01:47:59.108 --> 01:48:14.845
and and hunter and gathering thingy and you're not you now live in a world with cars and more people and and zoos and schools and the internet and so you gotta mitigate

01:48:15.632 --> 01:48:19.495
the influence of all of these things that aren't supposed to be your environment.

01:48:19.515 --> 01:48:26.001
Your environment is supposed to be like some kind of Savannah jungle thing with like other Savannah jungle things.

01:48:26.121 --> 01:48:30.725
And you're supposed to be in your bare feet or like, I don't know, with handmade sandals or some shit.

01:48:32.503 --> 01:48:38.186
And we're going to try to go back to that, but not really, kind of, sort of.

01:48:38.386 --> 01:48:41.008
And so that's really the goal of the Maha movement.

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.989
There's a couple different ways to Maha.

01:48:44.710 --> 01:48:47.531
But one of the ways to Maha is to do it like that.

01:48:47.631 --> 01:48:51.574
The other way is to use wearables and computers and stuff.

01:48:52.254 --> 01:48:54.855
And these guys want to go back to the hunter-gatherer thing.

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:56.296
That's what their book is about.

01:48:57.237 --> 01:48:59.178
That's how stupid these people are.

01:49:00.157 --> 01:49:05.641
say, such that your body is responding to an environment that it has some evolutionary history with.

01:49:06.282 --> 01:49:28.420
The benefit is that you get to use your senses and you get to become a sensual being that is actually tasting and feeling and touching and hearing and seeing all of the beauty of the world and responding appropriately to it, as opposed to having all of these screens and artifice between you and the world and being assured that you have to take that pill and then that pill to deal with that and that because you can't possibly know

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:34.324
Well, you can't possibly know in this modern world, most of us can't, because we can't taste anything anymore.

01:49:34.344 --> 01:49:37.106
And then of course, the food itself doesn't taste like what it used to.

01:49:37.466 --> 01:49:48.053
So if we can, if we can get back to just an environment in which we have some evolutionary history, and then can rely more completely.

01:49:48.634 --> 01:49:51.976
So what environment do we have an evolutionary history with?

01:49:53.493 --> 01:49:54.754
You see what they're doing here?

01:49:54.834 --> 01:49:57.476
It's all about evolution because DNA is real.

01:49:58.036 --> 01:50:02.379
Because transfection works, then evolution is real.

01:50:02.439 --> 01:50:05.821
And so you have to accept all the premises of evolution.

01:50:07.415 --> 01:50:10.417
including that you didn't evolve to be here.

01:50:10.477 --> 01:50:12.159
You didn't evolve to be here.

01:50:12.219 --> 01:50:15.621
So we gotta change things because it's all about evolution.

01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:27.570
And as long as we use the word evolution and hyper-complexity or hyper-novelty, then we can be the experts because we're the experts in hyper-novelty and in complex systems.

01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:30.252
Because evolution is a complex system.

01:50:31.161 --> 01:50:37.224
completely, but more completely on our senses to perceive the environment and what is in fact good for us.

01:50:37.524 --> 01:50:46.989
While recognizing that, our senses will lead us astray in some regards because no person 5,000 years ago had access to endless honey every day.

01:50:47.429 --> 01:50:52.373
or maple syrup and didn't have access to, you know, or cane or sugar cane, right?

01:50:53.113 --> 01:51:04.843
So, you know, recognizing that there are, you know, still some things that are accessible to modern humans that need to be that you need to recognize as the things that your senses think they want.

01:51:05.683 --> 01:51:06.003
But if you

01:51:07.204 --> 01:51:27.518
Boy, if you begin to think through your senses to some degree and also keep track of the time scale on which you are receiving pleasure through them, I like... She is going to get so philosophical here right now, she's almost going to float off her chair.

01:51:27.959 --> 01:51:29.880
And it is such a joke.

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:39.938
This insight that she's about to expound on is the insight that my son, who's a freshman going in sophomore in high school would have.

01:51:40.599 --> 01:51:53.549
Not to insult my son, I'm insulting her as a person who supposedly has 50 years of experience on this planet and has a podcast whose viewers she thinks need this revelation.

01:51:56.252 --> 01:51:56.452
Sure.

01:51:57.606 --> 01:51:58.587
Ice cream tastes good.

01:51:59.188 --> 01:52:03.132
A scoop of ice cream sometimes tastes good and doesn't leave me feeling bad.

01:52:04.373 --> 01:52:14.243
If I'm traveling and if I, as I just was, if I'm in Portland and Salt and Straw is there and it's they make great ice cream and I go get ice cream for them three days in a row, I don't feel good.

01:52:15.031 --> 01:52:34.669
Yeah, the pleasure of the ice cream I then I then try to think about the fact that the pleasure of the third scoop of ice cream in three days is Making me not feel as good and therefore I should not be taking as much pleasure from the eating of it Wow, so really that's all we have to do see if you just

01:52:35.489 --> 01:52:45.494
you know, would take less pressure in what you eat and understand that the pleasure you're taking is very short-lived, most of Americans' problems would be over.

01:52:47.174 --> 01:53:00.460
And you can train yourself to actually be more sensorily engaged on a longer time horizon that then allows you to take more pleasure in more things all of the time.

01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:01.421
All right.

01:53:02.714 --> 01:53:03.274
couple things.

01:53:03.915 --> 01:53:07.017
One, I don't even know what she's talking about.

01:53:07.117 --> 01:53:09.259
It's so dumb and it's going to get worse.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:16.084
They are going to repeat the name of salt and straw a few times because I guess they're doing the Joe Rogan kind of promotion.

01:53:16.325 --> 01:53:19.947
And you say senses and I agree your senses are

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:22.549
first pass reliably.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.722
I can't even believe that he's able to sustain a marriage with anyone.

01:53:42.942 --> 01:53:44.543
In an environment like the one you came from.

01:53:44.583 --> 01:53:49.747
But the environment like the one you came from doesn't have salt and straw in the sense that we have it now.

01:53:49.807 --> 01:53:54.970
So you have to understand that salt and straw's ability to capture your attention is novel.

01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:59.633
It may be one of the things you can't control because our need for markets to solve.

01:53:59.653 --> 01:54:01.274
Did she just say something was novel?

01:54:01.374 --> 01:54:02.135
Did he say novel?

01:54:02.155 --> 01:54:03.676
Because that's coming.

01:54:03.816 --> 01:54:06.798
If you want to start the drinking game, now we start the drinking game.

01:54:07.358 --> 01:54:08.699
when they use the word novel.

01:54:08.859 --> 01:54:12.722
And if they use the word hyper novel, you have to drink like one, two, three.

01:54:13.362 --> 01:54:13.743
Here we go.

01:54:14.143 --> 01:54:19.347
Problems where we can't centrally plan our way out of stuff, which is to say almost everywhere.

01:54:20.928 --> 01:54:23.830
You know, we have to accept salt and straw will be there.

01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:26.452
So you have to correct something because you're not in your native environment.

01:54:26.512 --> 01:54:27.672
But the

01:54:29.065 --> 01:54:36.669
I would say, and this is in our book, too, it's really a question of your senses.

01:54:36.689 --> 01:54:37.849
This is my camping flask.

01:54:37.909 --> 01:54:38.369
It's empty.

01:54:38.650 --> 01:54:39.090
It's empty.

01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:45.913
And the thing that I've made this point land with as far as I know, it's not one of the things that people reflect back.

01:54:46.073 --> 01:54:49.795
So maybe this time it'll work in the context of this conversation.

01:54:51.581 --> 01:54:57.487
when your environment is sufficiently healthy by virtue of two facts.

01:54:57.827 --> 01:55:01.471
One, it looks a lot like an ancestral environment in the ways that matter.

01:55:02.192 --> 01:55:10.860
And two, it is not different from... Please understand that part of the grift, part of the bullshit that they're doing here is this idea that

01:55:11.701 --> 01:55:17.685
The ancestral environment is something that you can take for granted, that they can just define in a few sentences.

01:55:17.725 --> 01:55:19.026
They're just assuming.

01:55:19.066 --> 01:55:25.070
It's like the ship-in-a-bottle operator that his dipshit brother uses to complete his equation of everything.

01:55:28.091 --> 01:55:32.374
It's really, really ridiculous how these people talk and get away with it.

01:55:32.414 --> 01:55:42.619
And the only reason why they're able to get away with it is because they're on a stupid podcast, on stupid social media, with nobody watching that actually has the requisite knowledge to check them.

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.783
And I, on the other hand, am begging someone, somewhere, the phone is up there.

01:55:48.863 --> 01:55:50.144
The phone is up there.

01:55:50.204 --> 01:55:51.524
All you gotta do is call it.

01:55:51.605 --> 01:55:52.785
It'll ring live.

01:55:54.106 --> 01:55:55.187
Nobody ever calls.

01:55:56.192 --> 01:56:04.886
Call 412-423-6343 right now and it'll ring live right now on my, it could have rung any time in the last three months.

01:56:05.768 --> 01:56:07.150
Nobody's bothered to call.

01:56:07.931 --> 01:56:08.552
It's a joke.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.960
Nobody has anything to say.

01:56:11.021 --> 01:56:12.681
There are no corrections to be made.

01:56:12.741 --> 01:56:22.985
Gigome Biological has basically dismantled this narrative and identified several of the bullshitters responsible for maintaining this script.

01:56:23.165 --> 01:56:27.766
And Brett Weinstein is one of these really, really dumb ones.

01:56:28.927 --> 01:56:29.747
He'll say anything.

01:56:30.486 --> 01:56:31.567
from the one you grew up in.

01:56:31.807 --> 01:56:40.274
So you, as an adult, are living in an environment that works because it's like an ancestral environment, and it's not different, so you're native to it.

01:56:40.915 --> 01:56:46.640
When that is true, what you really can go on is your intuition.

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:50.002
Not because your intuition comes from some mystical place.

01:56:50.102 --> 01:56:58.830
It's just that you will have trained in the very environment, and so you look at something, and it looks appetizing because it's good for you, and it looks unappetizing because it's not.

01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:08.246
And that intuition then does exactly what you're suggesting, which is it frees your conscious mind from the...

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:11.984
never ending puzzle of modernity.

01:57:12.204 --> 01:57:13.925
How should I feel about that?

01:57:14.806 --> 01:57:22.272
The never ending puzzle of modernity is something that your mind is not equipped for, but he's not a neurobiologist.

01:57:22.312 --> 01:57:24.554
He's not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

01:57:24.594 --> 01:57:31.339
He is a evolutionary biologist and an expert in complex systems and also has 50 years of advertising experience.

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:36.103
This is one of the biggest traitors to American children on Earth.

01:57:37.353 --> 01:57:47.626
only exceeded by people with longer time contributions to this long con like Andrew Wakefield and Mary Holland and Pauly Tommy and Brian Hooker.

01:57:49.568 --> 01:57:54.635
Like seriously, this guy is one of the new real all-stars of this shitshow.

01:57:56.307 --> 01:57:57.267
This is exactly right.

01:57:57.367 --> 01:58:01.889
And you hone your intuition through developmental experiences and through learning in adulthood.

01:58:02.529 --> 01:58:17.394
And why is it at this point, and it's going to be a slightly different answer for the two of us, but neither you nor I, when we go past a McDonald's or a Wendy's or an Arby's or anything, it just doesn't render as food for us.

01:58:17.434 --> 01:58:19.135
There's nothing there at all.

01:58:19.815 --> 01:58:21.056
And there's no interest.

01:58:21.116 --> 01:58:24.517
I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that if they left

01:58:25.592 --> 01:58:35.359
civilization and went camping for two weeks and then came back to the trailhead in Lander, Wyoming and the only thing that was available for fast food was Burger King.

01:58:35.539 --> 01:58:38.561
These two would eat hamburgers like you were going out of style.

01:58:40.142 --> 01:58:40.942
I guarantee it.

01:58:43.206 --> 01:58:46.188
And it's just a joke to me that they talk with such arrogance.

01:58:46.949 --> 01:58:52.093
Because nobody, I mean nobody, can say that fast food tastes like shit.

01:58:52.153 --> 01:58:54.054
If you don't like one, you'll like another.

01:58:54.215 --> 01:58:55.936
If you've never tried it, how do you know?

01:58:56.396 --> 01:58:58.918
These people, you don't see food there.

01:59:00.039 --> 01:59:04.683
That's like saying you don't have to buy the potato chips in the aisle of the chips.

01:59:04.723 --> 01:59:06.944
Yeah, that's true, you don't have to buy the potato chips.

01:59:07.365 --> 01:59:09.947
But you're not gonna tell me that when you eat a Dorito, you gag.

01:59:11.152 --> 01:59:14.814
You're not gonna tell me that sour cream and onion potato chips taste like shit.

01:59:18.537 --> 01:59:25.421
And you're never gonna convince me that the curly fries are, you know, it's just something I can't get to go down.

01:59:26.142 --> 01:59:27.042
Give me a break.

01:59:28.283 --> 01:59:33.186
You eat at salt and straw, but you can't eat fast food.

01:59:33.646 --> 01:59:36.068
I seriously want to swear it's so stupid.

01:59:37.882 --> 01:59:47.265
no tugging at the edges of consciousness, whereas a gelateria, for me, a good bakery or a good ice cream- A gelateria?

01:59:47.605 --> 01:59:49.906
What if they're using the wrong flour?

01:59:52.167 --> 01:59:58.909
Then I know a lot of people who could go into a great bakery with lots of shit that looks really good and have diarrhea for days.

02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:03.211
It won't be any different than eating the shitty pizza at Domino's.

02:00:03.731 --> 02:00:06.992
This is so frickin' disingenuous, it's gross.

02:00:10.891 --> 02:00:15.533
Now we're going to be talking about the equity that not everybody has a gelateria in their neighborhood.

02:00:15.573 --> 02:00:16.814
Maybe we should work for something.

02:00:16.894 --> 02:00:18.195
We should start a nonprofit.

02:00:18.215 --> 02:00:20.636
So every neighborhood has a gelateria.

02:00:22.208 --> 02:00:22.468
store.

02:00:22.668 --> 02:00:32.753
And, you know, frankly, knowing more and more about all the gums and all the all the ingredients makes it easier again, because, you know, my first job, my first retail job was at Baskin Robbins.

02:00:32.773 --> 02:00:36.055
I used to eat a lot of Baskin Robbins back when I was also playing a lot of volleyball.

02:00:36.075 --> 02:00:38.396
So it didn't have any ill effects on me as far as I could tell.

02:00:38.897 --> 02:00:45.620
But now I think it didn't have any ill effects on you because you didn't inject it intramuscularly, you stupid buffoon.

02:00:47.081 --> 02:00:50.583
Not because you were doing volleyball, because you were moving.

02:00:51.741 --> 02:00:53.383
exercising every day.

02:00:55.465 --> 02:00:56.926
The volleyball didn't save you.

02:00:56.966 --> 02:00:58.928
It's because you didn't inject it, you dumb ass.

02:01:00.489 --> 02:01:05.094
Oh, I don't need to eat that ice cream ever again because it's filled with so much garbage.

02:01:05.194 --> 02:01:06.075
Too much xanthan gum.

02:01:06.655 --> 02:01:13.642
Too much, yeah, I'm not even all that concerned about the xanthan gum, but yeah, but- A minute ago she was talking about honey.

02:01:15.202 --> 02:01:20.024
and cane sugar, and how our ancestors didn't have any of this shit.

02:01:20.104 --> 02:01:22.065
Now it's the fricking xanthem gum?

02:01:25.546 --> 02:01:29.408
I mean, it's impossible that they can be this stupid, except they are.

02:01:30.388 --> 02:01:37.251
They're talking to themselves and they're saying stupid shit back and forth with no script.

02:01:37.711 --> 02:01:40.412
So it has to be that they are this stupid.

02:01:41.052 --> 02:01:42.453
It can't be something else.

02:01:44.451 --> 02:01:47.816
Too many other things that don't belong in good ice cream.

02:01:49.078 --> 02:01:56.109
So all that concern about the xanthan gum, but too many other things that don't belong in good ice cream.

02:01:57.378 --> 02:02:02.902
So everyone's going to have their particular things that appeal to them.

02:02:03.203 --> 02:02:07.506
I don't feel any virtue for not being interested in going to KFC.

02:02:08.007 --> 02:02:08.767
I just never did.

02:02:09.368 --> 02:02:11.209
And so it doesn't look like food.

02:02:11.509 --> 02:02:18.155
And so you don't get points for not doing the things that don't appeal to you for some developmental reason or some wisdom that you've already acquired.

02:02:19.449 --> 02:02:43.042
Now the trick is honing your intuition such that, and keeping track of your senses, all of them, including how your gut feels for days afterwards, such that your intuitions are better honed and you don't look at the ice cream store the second day in a row that you passed it when you just got some the day before.

02:02:43.683 --> 02:02:45.644
That's not actually going to bring me pleasure, net.

02:02:48.407 --> 02:02:52.428
I mean, we're talking with such a specificity that it's stupid.

02:02:52.508 --> 02:02:58.750
For example, I assume that when she was playing volleyball and eating Baskin-Robbins all day, it wasn't the only thing she ate.

02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:12.433
Whereas when you become an adult and you're not growing anymore and you don't have this ravaging appetite that's also driven by your athletics and your growth and your development,

02:03:13.735 --> 02:03:16.457
then you can get away with just eating a few calories a day.

02:03:16.477 --> 02:03:25.123
And if those calories are empty calories or come from shitty calories, then they have a different effect than when you're in development and burning energy all the time.

02:03:25.143 --> 02:03:39.953
And then in addition to having four square meals a day that included a nice breakfast and a healthy lunch at the diner and also a turkey sandwich at night, then it's stupid to talk about scoops of ice cream.

02:03:41.104 --> 02:03:52.791
but an adult that skips breakfast sometimes, doesn't exercise and eats a shitty lunch at work, coming home and having a not so great dinner and then having ice cream, it's a larger percentage.

02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:55.892
You see how sad they are?

02:03:57.593 --> 02:04:01.796
How sad they are that they think they're doing something useful for anyone?

02:04:03.652 --> 02:04:11.497
And how sad it is that there are Americans and people around the world who think that this is a useful discussion because they were so lost to begin with.

02:04:13.999 --> 02:04:15.260
That this is all they can handle.

02:04:18.302 --> 02:04:20.163
They're not ready to jump out of the plane yet.

02:04:22.825 --> 02:04:26.147
And in fact, that's what these people are supposed to make them feel like they're doing.

02:04:26.227 --> 02:04:28.009
It's supposed to feel very brave.

02:04:28.973 --> 02:04:30.034
These guys are brave.

02:04:30.054 --> 02:04:36.580
They're saying brave things because they're really brave and they're independent and they're not part of the administration so they can be critical.

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.621
They're so brave.

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:41.105
They're so scripted and they're so full of shit.

02:04:41.605 --> 02:04:53.630
The dividend on having your conscious mind freed from playing over all sorts of modern stuff, especially stuff built to fit in your blind spot.

02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:54.070
Yeah.

02:04:54.411 --> 02:04:54.631
Right.

02:04:56.652 --> 02:04:59.033
So much specificity, it hurts.

02:04:59.133 --> 02:05:02.894
We still, we're not even talking about anything yet except for xantham gum.

02:05:03.534 --> 02:05:06.876
Like this is some seriously malevolent bullshit.

02:05:08.103 --> 02:05:09.185
And they are paid.

02:05:10.948 --> 02:05:15.676
They are paid handsomely, so handsomely they were able to move to a better house on an island.

02:05:19.887 --> 02:05:31.152
Ladies and gentlemen, we are being usurped by a group of actors on social media that are connected to Steve Bannon and to Tony Lyons and to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:05:31.832 --> 02:05:38.075
and to all these assholes that are part of the health freedom movement that is a joke on our grandkids.

02:05:39.955 --> 02:05:46.438
And I've tried to show you in the first part of the program, the rest of the country in the world is laughing.

02:05:48.066 --> 02:05:58.955
The rest of the country and the world is laughing while the people in this conservative health freedom movement sit in their own little bubble on social media and don't even know it's happening.

02:05:59.455 --> 02:06:00.796
And this is part of the bubble.

02:06:01.237 --> 02:06:06.381
This asshole and all these intellectual dark web people are part of that bubble.

02:06:06.761 --> 02:06:10.524
If you watch them, it sounds like the word is getting out and it's not.

02:06:12.986 --> 02:06:13.867
We are trapped.

02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:21.757
that that dividend of having your conscious mind freed to dedicate to other things is uh priceless.

02:06:21.897 --> 02:06:37.264
I mean, like, yes, literally, you couldn't put a price on it and we don't live there because you constantly have to look at every single thing and you know, it's gone even from I don't know what to think of that thing that I just saw on my screen to oh, I have no idea if that even happened, right?

02:06:37.445 --> 02:06:37.945
Precisely.

02:06:38.565 --> 02:06:40.406
Um so, you know, this problem is going to get worse.

02:06:40.446 --> 02:06:40.506
The

02:06:45.882 --> 02:06:51.703
at probably your best shot is mild agnosticism about every single damn thing.

02:06:52.183 --> 02:06:55.824
And that is, you know... And that's exactly what they need.

02:06:56.584 --> 02:06:58.804
Complete intellectual chaos.

02:07:00.485 --> 02:07:01.565
That is the goal.

02:07:02.145 --> 02:07:04.185
Complete intellectual chaos.

02:07:04.285 --> 02:07:08.826
Not a rejection of the system, not united non-compliance.

02:07:10.026 --> 02:07:12.147
The goal is confusion.

02:07:13.095 --> 02:07:16.140
and agnosticism to the existence of anything.

02:07:17.188 --> 02:07:19.789
since I can't know, I'm just going to give up.

02:07:20.290 --> 02:07:24.152
And giving up means we're going to pass on the giving up to our kids.

02:07:24.352 --> 02:07:24.912
Oh, I don't know.

02:07:24.932 --> 02:07:26.093
I don't know what's going on.

02:07:26.573 --> 02:07:31.156
You cannot abdicate your responsibility to know what the fuck is going on.

02:07:31.636 --> 02:07:35.838
You cannot abdicate your responsibility to know what the fuck is going on.

02:07:36.198 --> 02:07:40.280
You need to wake up and you need to get in control of your family.

02:07:40.621 --> 02:07:43.082
You need to get in control of your community again,

02:07:43.482 --> 02:07:47.184
And you need to make your children realize that you know what's going on.

02:07:48.345 --> 02:07:52.807
Not that you're just some adult who's going along to get along.

02:07:52.867 --> 02:07:55.168
Not just some adult who doesn't know what's going on.

02:07:55.648 --> 02:07:57.889
You are an adult that knows what's going on.

02:07:57.949 --> 02:08:02.151
We all need to be adults that knows, who know what's going on.

02:08:02.211 --> 02:08:08.134
These are not adults who know what's going on and they are not making adults who know what's going on.

02:08:10.155 --> 02:08:12.557
And I want to make adults who know what's going on.

02:08:13.706 --> 02:08:21.133
I want adults that understand that there is a fake anti-vax movement in America and who it is and what damage they are doing.

02:08:21.854 --> 02:08:23.915
I want them to know about the people in the U.S.

02:08:23.935 --> 02:08:29.440
government who do not have just one passport and ask themselves, why in the hell are those people there?

02:08:29.881 --> 02:08:30.982
And how did they get there?

02:08:31.022 --> 02:08:34.245
And why are all of them in pictures with Jonathan Cooey?

02:08:36.195 --> 02:08:42.123
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:08:42.683 --> 02:08:47.309
Transfection in healthy humans was always a crime and viruses are not pattern integrities.

02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:50.673
They are collecting your DNA because they are setting up

02:08:51.374 --> 02:09:00.780
the next iteration of this network of processors and of collection devices and transmitters so that eventually this will work.

02:09:01.201 --> 02:09:02.762
It's not gonna work now.

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:07.205
It's not the data they need yet, but they've gotta do iterations of it.

02:09:07.265 --> 02:09:10.427
So they're doing it right now because the grandkids are the goal.

02:09:10.827 --> 02:09:12.468
The grandkids are the target.

02:09:12.768 --> 02:09:17.512
You can see this paper and the fact that all these people are on it together is an admission.

02:09:18.092 --> 02:09:20.573
It's an admission that they were always put in place.

02:09:21.193 --> 02:09:26.196
This picture is an admission that they were always put in place, that these people are actors.

02:09:26.836 --> 02:09:28.697
And that is Jason Kristoff.

02:09:29.017 --> 02:09:30.418
I couldn't come up with his name.

02:09:30.938 --> 02:09:31.838
And so I left it.

02:09:33.479 --> 02:09:34.600
And now I know his name.

02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:37.621
And so if that's not spelled right, I apologize, but that's his name.

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:39.701
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:09:39.741 --> 02:09:40.601
Thank you for being here.

02:09:40.641 --> 02:09:41.242
It's Friday.

02:09:41.262 --> 02:09:43.783
Thank goodness it's Friday.

02:09:43.843 --> 02:09:45.144
I am taking the weekend off.

02:09:45.204 --> 02:09:45.724
It is hot.

02:09:46.224 --> 02:09:49.966
I have a list of things that I would like to accomplish that my wife is not aware of.

02:09:50.066 --> 02:09:55.149
And so if I accomplish any of them, I think actually she'll be really happy.

02:09:55.209 --> 02:09:57.550
So hopefully I'll get more than one of them done.

02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:59.531
Hopefully the weekend will be somewhat dry.

02:09:59.551 --> 02:10:02.493
I hope your weekend is safe and peaceful.

02:10:02.853 --> 02:10:04.594
And I will see you again on Monday.

02:10:05.154 --> 02:10:06.375
Thank you very much for being here.

02:10:06.795 --> 02:10:08.276
Thank you very much for sharing this work.

02:10:08.997 --> 02:10:11.299
If you're curious who I am, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

02:10:11.359 --> 02:10:14.721
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

02:10:14.742 --> 02:10:21.667
You can find the work of my academic career on the National Library of Medicine PubMed under my name, JJ Cooey.

02:10:22.267 --> 02:10:26.871
You can also see my work in the Wuhan cover-up book by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

02:10:27.271 --> 02:10:30.634
I used to be a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense and

02:10:31.054 --> 02:10:36.160
I used to be a good barbecue buddy of Jay Bhattacharya before he got the NIH.

02:10:36.821 --> 02:10:39.944
And yes, I am the man who is stealing Chief Woohoo.

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:41.326
My name is Jonathan Couey.

02:10:41.646 --> 02:10:43.568
Thanks very much and I will see you again on Monday.

02:10:43.929 --> 02:10:49.355
There's a YouTube channel and you can also share this video on YouTube if that's your preferred platform.

02:10:49.395 --> 02:10:50.036
It's not mine.

02:10:50.476 --> 02:10:54.258
But it's probably better than Twitch, so that's why I started putting it on JC in the Woods.

02:10:54.738 --> 02:10:57.279
It's not easy to find, but it's not impossible.

02:10:58.079 --> 02:10:59.120
Thank you very much for being here.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:01.240
This is how it works, right?

02:11:01.361 --> 02:11:02.141
Sharing my work.

02:11:02.361 --> 02:11:04.142
If you can share it, it would really be great.

02:11:04.182 --> 02:11:05.402
That's the only way this works.

02:11:05.422 --> 02:11:06.943
That's the way that people are going to wake up.

02:11:07.883 --> 02:11:13.226
So if you haven't sent around the links from stream.gigaohm.bio, please get in the habit of doing that.

02:11:13.246 --> 02:11:18.068
You can find all the hits, all the ways to do that at gigaohmbiological.com.

02:11:18.128 --> 02:11:19.288
Thanks very much for joining me.

02:11:19.308 --> 02:11:22.950
Have a great weekend and see you again soon.
