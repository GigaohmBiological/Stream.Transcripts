WEBVTT

00:40.988 --> 00:42.630
and and

01:09.568 --> 01:11.931
music music

01:38.796 --> 01:41.858
All units, we have a signal 10-7-Niner.

01:42.339 --> 01:43.419
Officers are in pursuit.

01:43.860 --> 01:46.361
A black and white 1974 Dodge sedan, southbound on 4-7.

01:46.401 --> 01:47.943
Respond to signal 10-7-Niner.

01:48.103 --> 01:51.525
Occupants of vehicle, one Joliet Jake Blue, one Elwood Blue.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.826
Considered... Hey, Jake.

01:52.866 --> 01:53.066
Jake.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.107
I gotta pull over.

02:29.263 --> 02:29.363
Hi.

02:30.244 --> 02:34.006
Want to hand me the mic?

02:34.046 --> 02:34.746
Thanks a lot.

02:34.986 --> 02:40.169
Hi, this is car, um... What number are we?

02:40.189 --> 02:40.529
Five-five.

02:40.709 --> 02:40.949
Car 55.

02:41.089 --> 02:42.050
Um, we're in a truck.

03:58.701 --> 03:59.508
Buzzing

04:33.072 --> 04:37.234
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:37.734 --> 04:41.916
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:43.877 --> 04:45.458
I think truth is good for kids.

04:45.898 --> 04:49.680
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:50.180 --> 04:51.781
We want everybody to feel good.

04:51.801 --> 04:54.182
That's not the way life is.

04:56.723 --> 05:00.585
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:02.415 --> 05:03.136
And I have lied.

05:03.156 --> 05:04.178
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:04.198 --> 05:05.139
I don't want to lie.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.002
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

05:07.082 --> 05:08.124
I try not to be a liar.

05:08.144 --> 05:09.005
I don't want to be a liar.

05:09.566 --> 05:12.290
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

05:16.087 --> 05:34.772
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:35.872 --> 05:44.314
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

05:48.120 --> 06:06.631
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

06:06.932 --> 06:08.933
It's just a big hassle in the end.

06:09.533 --> 06:15.697
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and

06:19.744 --> 06:25.227
It's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

06:25.287 --> 06:27.788
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

07:01.471 --> 07:02.352
so so

07:30.504 --> 07:33.305
Somebody said pump it up, so I pumped it up.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.648
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:39.668 --> 07:48.131
It's been a long time since I've worked this little rig here, so give me a second to reorient myself.

07:48.191 --> 07:49.551
Wow, that feels really loud.

07:49.591 --> 07:50.472
Maybe that's that knob.

08:57.939 --> 08:58.725
Okay, here we go.

08:58.765 --> 08:59.410
Sorry about that.

09:00.356 --> 09:01.596
Welcome to the show, everybody.

09:03.577 --> 09:09.619
Trying to break the bamboozlement one day at a time, these charlatans that we inherited from our parents.

09:11.539 --> 09:22.822
The only way we're going to get rid of them is to keep repeating the truth as we try to navigate away from this mythology and we try to make gentle the life of this world at the same time.

09:22.842 --> 09:27.944
Not very many people are saying peace might be one solution.

09:29.385 --> 09:30.612
Peace might be a solution.

09:30.632 --> 09:32.261
Why doesn't anybody use the word peace?

09:34.215 --> 09:44.900
I think it's because there is a manufactured illusion of consensus on social media and on TV that can be metaphorically represented by this wave, which is going the wrong way.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.822
It's going away from the shallow water, and it's nearly perfect.

09:49.643 --> 09:51.424
And that's a really great surfing teacher.

09:52.444 --> 10:00.989
But if we're going to surf this manufactured wave of social media illusion of consent, we're going to need to help our children surf it too.

10:02.189 --> 10:04.150
Because they're only going to get better at it.

10:05.511 --> 10:09.854
And if you don't have this surfboard of truth, I don't think you're going to be able to get through.

10:10.414 --> 10:11.375
I don't really like this.

10:11.555 --> 10:12.636
This doesn't work for me.

10:12.836 --> 10:13.696
I've got to change this.

10:13.776 --> 10:14.297
I'm sorry.

10:14.317 --> 10:18.199
This is Skilled Surfboard.

10:23.896 --> 10:40.056
And so then if I guess we were to do something correct here, if we were to do something correct here, what we would do is take and insert a text box like this and say like an illusion of consensus.

10:41.755 --> 10:42.456
How about a wave?

10:42.956 --> 10:44.377
A wave of consensus, huh?

10:44.417 --> 10:45.979
That would be, that's a good one for this one.

10:46.399 --> 10:48.060
Oh boy, getting creative now.

10:48.801 --> 10:50.543
Look out, feeling sharp.

10:51.543 --> 10:53.125
Let me see if I can do this here.

10:53.145 --> 10:54.986
There we go, like that.

10:55.006 --> 10:57.709
We can even like go, oops.

10:59.653 --> 11:06.617
We could even do something like rotate it a little bit, and then set it up over here.

11:06.637 --> 11:07.237
See, like that.

11:07.337 --> 11:07.937
Oh, look at that.

11:08.057 --> 11:08.718
Whoa!

11:09.278 --> 11:10.258
Now that's impact.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.579
All right, there we go.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.881
So welcome to the show, everybody, where we stay focused on the biology.

11:14.901 --> 11:17.242
We don't take the bait on social media.

11:17.942 --> 11:19.063
And we love our neighbor.

11:21.325 --> 11:24.889
Thank you very much for spreading the word about this work.

11:24.929 --> 11:28.213
Thank you very much for being patient for me and getting back online today.

11:28.233 --> 11:34.601
This is definitely gigaohm biological high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

11:36.813 --> 11:38.014
I think the horns are coming.

11:38.034 --> 11:38.855
I got to fix this one.

11:38.895 --> 11:44.600
It's a little slow I didn't have a lot to say today because I just really want to get started and you might say well Why don't you just get started?

11:44.660 --> 11:56.831
But it takes a little while to organize one of these little slide deck so it's just kind of easier to start from the place where you know you want to get to and it gives me time to ever getting straightened out, you know, like the and the

11:58.248 --> 12:02.332
That needs to be turned up a little bit, see, depending on what music I'm using.

12:02.372 --> 12:10.520
There is a paradigm shift happening, ladies and gentlemen, because these people are... The illusion that they were creating is starting to break.

12:11.721 --> 12:16.665
This idea that there were these different factions on Twitter and stuff is really... We have to get off that.

12:17.026 --> 12:18.167
We have to just get off Twitter.

12:18.807 --> 12:23.232
I don't know how much longer I'm going to stay there because it's really, really not very handy.

12:24.312 --> 12:25.293
and it is an illusion.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.216
And we only, if we participate in it, then we're vulnerable to it.

12:29.236 --> 12:31.477
If we don't participate in it, we're not vulnerable to it.

12:31.537 --> 12:33.559
So I'm getting really close.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.761
I'm just warning you to not really tweeting at all anymore, just to say it.

13:04.141 --> 13:06.442
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

13:06.502 --> 13:11.263
This is Giga Ohm Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

13:11.303 --> 13:15.224
I think my camera's a little out, which makes me look extra tired.

13:15.264 --> 13:17.744
I just got back from the gym though, so I have an excuse.

13:19.104 --> 13:20.925
Had to get basketball in before this.

13:30.455 --> 13:35.718
The work lights in the back will change the way that the camera exposes me.

13:35.738 --> 13:38.000
I look pretty tired.

13:38.060 --> 13:38.320
Okay.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.242
Anyway, it's June 18th, 2024.

13:41.842 --> 13:43.103
I'm glad to be back on the air.

13:43.163 --> 13:45.244
I had a really great trip to South Dakota.

13:45.284 --> 13:45.905
I got to hug

13:46.826 --> 13:47.886
G. Edward Griffin.

13:47.926 --> 13:49.227
I got to meet a lot of people.

13:49.327 --> 13:53.848
I just got a phone message saying that I'm going to be on Dr. Merritt's podcast next Thursday.

13:54.108 --> 13:56.609
If you know Dr. Lee Merritt, we met while we were there.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.070
We had a good connection.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.251
And so, I'm going to be on her stream or on her broadcast.

14:02.271 --> 14:05.932
We're going to make a pre-recording next week on Thursday, which is pretty exciting.

14:06.372 --> 14:09.213
And there's lots of other details I could give away later.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.814
For now, I just want to move forward.

14:12.115 --> 14:13.656
Don't forget, I'm a human just like you.

14:14.757 --> 14:20.241
In this talk that I gave on the 15th of June, everything is not perfect.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.383
There's a couple things in the talk.

14:22.423 --> 14:23.003
I had to watch it.

14:23.043 --> 14:24.765
I was going to watch it live with you.

14:24.785 --> 14:29.428
And then I watched about 15 minutes of it or so.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.110
And then I got kind of nervous about that.

14:31.190 --> 14:32.891
So I watched the whole thing myself.

14:34.072 --> 14:36.494
I'm still going to be a little bit cringey.

14:39.141 --> 14:47.984
There's one part in particular that's a little personal to me that I would rather edit out, but I can't or won't because I don't like to play those games.

14:48.104 --> 14:59.607
But I don't think I, I very, I think I in a certain way dishonestly represented why I wasn't present at my friend Nathan's funeral.

14:59.687 --> 15:01.968
So I just want to say that right up front.

15:02.068 --> 15:07.430
I was pretty aggressive in my language about why I didn't go there and I didn't take very much credit for it.

15:07.470 --> 15:08.910
And so, um,

15:10.291 --> 15:14.095
I don't know why those are the words that came out of my mouth.

15:14.615 --> 15:22.163
Yes, I had conversations with my friends about me not being able to go to the funeral without telling everybody that I think it's the shot.

15:22.203 --> 15:24.185
And so therefore I won't go to the funeral.

15:24.305 --> 15:25.446
I shouldn't go to the funeral.

15:25.506 --> 15:31.211
But when I was presenting in the Red Pill, it made it seem like all of them told me not to come.

15:32.131 --> 15:40.475
And so when that part comes in the film, it's going to be pretty cringy for me because that's not how it should be represented at all.

15:41.595 --> 15:43.596
And so I apologize for that.

15:44.036 --> 15:47.437
It was the one real trip up that I don't like.

15:48.018 --> 15:55.601
But I was very fired up and I was very nervous and saying a lot of things that I didn't think I was going to say and somehow or another I just

15:56.929 --> 15:58.069
I didn't represent that well.

15:58.089 --> 16:04.591
So you'll see those, those, that language there, and maybe it won't seem so significant to you, but it seems significant to me upon reviewing.

16:04.651 --> 16:07.571
And so I wanted to be right up front with that right away.

16:08.411 --> 16:15.553
Um, so that that can't be misconstrued in any way as me not being very, very, um, humble about that.

16:16.053 --> 16:23.735
Um, so anyway, there's that, um, it's pretty, it's a pretty, um,

16:27.868 --> 16:30.091
I go pretty hard in the paint, so to speak.

16:31.393 --> 16:41.547
And I think you're going to be a little bit more than satisfied with what I did in some respects.

16:41.687 --> 16:44.771
And in other respects, I've made some small errors that I can correct today.

16:45.785 --> 17:00.184
I can show you where the the laser pointer was because you can't see it on the live stream and there's a couple times where maybe I could have been on screen when I wasn't or whatever but the live stream people that were there they had like three cameras and they had lots of screens to control because they had a

17:00.825 --> 17:16.379
had a clock in front of me and my presentation was in front of me plus they had these two screens plus me in the middle and then they were also live streaming and deciding whether they needed to put me in the corner and the slides over there or me in the corner and the slides over there and that's really hard for them too and I didn't pay very much.

17:16.399 --> 17:16.980
I didn't

17:18.925 --> 17:27.832
I didn't quite stick to what the guy asked me to do, which is that if I decide to look at the slides, always look at it from the same side of the screen so that he can put me in the same corner all the time.

17:28.952 --> 17:30.694
And so I don't think I helped him with that either.

17:30.714 --> 17:32.395
It made it harder for them to change.

17:32.435 --> 17:34.036
So they did a really wonderful job.

17:34.737 --> 17:42.703
And the lady who actually did it and helped me by letting me change my slides after I figured out after the first night how to

17:43.798 --> 17:50.580
I dropped them off the night before, but then on the day of my talk, I wanted to change my talk because I had figured out how to embed the fonts.

17:52.080 --> 17:56.561
So anyway, here it is in its pure form.

17:57.161 --> 18:03.163
I will pause it occasionally, but only if I need to correct.

18:03.223 --> 18:04.243
Otherwise, I'll just let it go.

18:06.004 --> 18:06.344
Here we go.

18:10.365 --> 18:11.845
And the next guy we're going to bring up

18:12.671 --> 18:15.036
is going to bring some of that truth based on a lot of facts.

18:15.376 --> 18:20.687
He's got a very detailed, intense science background, neurobiology, PhD level.

18:21.457 --> 18:28.941
worked with University of Pittsburgh Medical School, Carnegie Mellon, and he knows some stuff, and he knows not to wear three masks.

18:29.061 --> 18:31.502
How is it that these other doctors and PhDs didn't know that?

18:31.702 --> 18:32.463
We're going to find out.

18:32.963 --> 18:41.347
And his talk, why the COVID narrative is biologically impossible, not implausible, impossible, let's find out all about it.

18:41.848 --> 18:45.109
Let's welcome to the stage, Red Pill Expo stage, J.J.

18:45.149 --> 18:46.550
Cooey, PhD, J.J.

18:47.230 --> 18:47.591
Thank you.

18:48.051 --> 18:49.031
That was really crazy.

18:49.071 --> 18:49.692
Thank you very much.

18:51.973 --> 18:53.974
Thank you very much for having me here.

18:54.494 --> 18:57.556
Of course, I owe Mr. Griffin a great big thank you.

18:58.076 --> 19:00.437
I actually, when he called me, I didn't believe it was him.

19:01.078 --> 19:05.220
And then I asked him if I get Saturday or Sunday, and he told me I only get an hour.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.582
So I'm going to have to be a little bit of a biological auctioneer here.

19:09.663 --> 19:12.926
I want to justify why it is that I'm standing in front of you.

19:13.386 --> 19:19.973
If you google gigaohm biological on the net, you will find lots of things that don't have anything to do with me.

19:20.914 --> 19:26.059
Gigaohm actually refers to the resistance of the electrical seal

19:26.679 --> 19:32.942
that I used to make when I was a neurobiologist recording from individual neurons and brain slices of mice and monkeys.

19:33.543 --> 19:42.207
I actually also worked on material that was taken out of cancer patients that had glioma, and so I've made recordings from individual human neurons as well.

19:43.908 --> 19:46.790
The reason why I'm up here is a little bit odd.

19:48.531 --> 20:05.402
I have a 20-year career as a neuroscientist, which means I was trying really hard to become a professor in a university, and I was trying very hard to learn that craft, which I've come to understand as more of a bit of like a cat of magic rather than science.

20:06.602 --> 20:14.705
At the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, after 20 years of work, I moved to the United States from the Netherlands and Norway.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.026
Actually, I'm a Wisconsin boy.

20:17.046 --> 20:21.127
I did my undergraduate in Chicago, and then I moved away for 15 years.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.167
I married a Dutch woman.

20:22.327 --> 20:23.588
We went to Norway.

20:24.248 --> 20:25.409
We had two boys there.

20:25.670 --> 20:30.414
I worked for two neurobiologists that were awarded the Nobel Prize the year after I left.

20:30.614 --> 20:32.596
I went to the Netherlands to try and get tenure.

20:33.097 --> 20:39.003
Four years later, after not getting tenure in the Netherlands, we moved to the United States, kind of reluctantly on behalf of my wife.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.845
And we moved to the University of Pittsburgh.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.026
I'd never been there before.

20:43.106 --> 20:45.488
I hated Pittsburgh because of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

20:46.869 --> 20:48.310
I'm Wisconsin boy, what do you want?

20:49.470 --> 20:55.275
And so coming to Pittsburgh was a little bit reluctant, but the guy that was recruiting me took me to a baseball game and I was sold.

20:55.815 --> 20:56.855
It's a beautiful city.

20:57.536 --> 21:03.518
It's got a really rich history in America, and I was really proud to be working for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

21:03.958 --> 21:09.500
At the start of the pandemic, I had actually already done about 20 episodes on my bicycle.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.001
I was riding my bicycle to and from the University of Pittsburgh.

21:13.301 --> 21:14.622
It was about a nine-mile ride.

21:14.662 --> 21:18.983
If you know Pittsburgh, there's lots of big hills, and so I'm not a master.

21:19.024 --> 21:20.144
I just had an electric bike.

21:20.604 --> 21:37.596
But what the electric bike allowed me to do was I started teaching on my bike I got this really crazy idea because I was filming traffic and at some point I realized when I was reviewing this footage that I could clearly hear myself yelling at the cars and I thought well Maybe I should think of something else to do here.

21:37.636 --> 21:47.843
And since I was teaching some students and I was doing Journal Club I thought one of the things I could do is Journal Club on the bike and I called it JC on the bike and so it started to become this little thing and

21:48.283 --> 21:54.789
Well, then the COVID pandemic started and my boss said that you're one of these, what do they call them?

21:56.010 --> 22:00.775
Essential employees because I had animals that needed feeding and I had experiments that needed doing.

22:01.155 --> 22:03.738
And so I'm biking in with these empty streets.

22:04.318 --> 22:08.002
And so I thought, wow, I might as well do a review about coronavirus.

22:08.082 --> 22:09.763
I'm a guy who can read papers.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.886
So I read about 30 papers or so and I started

22:13.687 --> 22:39.694
Talking about coronavirus on my bicycle and I was getting all kinds of things wrong the first bike ride I said that the flu and and the common cold were all coronaviruses and I got a lot of stuff wrong The third bike ride though by the third bike ride I had already pretty much ironed it all out tonight Some people were emailing me and telling me I was making mistakes And then suddenly I got this email from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is the

22:40.554 --> 22:46.060
name for the private hospital that uses the name of University of Pittsburgh to sell stuff.

22:46.981 --> 22:50.365
And they said, the media company said, that we've seen your bike ride.

22:51.086 --> 22:57.072
And the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine would like to formally declare that that's not your expertise.

22:57.112 --> 23:01.436
And so if a paper, newspaper, were to call, you're not allowed to talk to them.

23:02.253 --> 23:11.957
And so the reason why this happened was because the week before I was quoted in the Washington Times, which is not a very good newspaper, but they quoted me right underneath Tony Fauci.

23:12.417 --> 23:15.258
And I just said, well, I mean, it wouldn't be crazy if it was a lab leak.

23:16.405 --> 23:23.749
And that reaction spurred me to go on for almost a year and a half, assuming that they were covering up a lab leak.

23:24.610 --> 23:27.111
And that's what Gigome Biological on Twitch was.

23:27.151 --> 23:36.937
And that's what actually led to a call in April of 2022, sitting in the lawn of my house with my wife, just kind of wondering what we're going to do next.

23:37.637 --> 23:40.359
And this guy calls me with this really crazy voice.

23:41.119 --> 23:44.301
And he says, Hey Jay, this is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:45.433 --> 23:47.334
And I fell down into the mud.

23:48.494 --> 23:49.374
I was crying.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.295
I couldn't believe it.

23:51.855 --> 23:54.256
I thought, my gosh, somebody's finally heard my message.

23:54.276 --> 23:58.558
10 minutes later, a guy by the name of Ron Johnson called me.

23:59.678 --> 24:01.399
And Ron Johnson said, well, you know what?

24:01.439 --> 24:04.500
Robert Malone sat me down and had me watch your stream.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.881
And I'd really like you to make a brief for my staff.

24:08.361 --> 24:10.862
It was basically the same story that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:10.882 --> 24:11.162
told me.

24:11.182 --> 24:12.943
He said that Robert Malone sat him down,

24:13.832 --> 24:17.776
had him watch a January stream of mine, and he wanted me to help him write this book.

24:19.397 --> 24:24.302
So this is the book that Robert released at the end of last year.

24:24.342 --> 24:28.165
It's called The Wuhan Cover-Up, the Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race.

24:29.266 --> 24:31.949
If you open this book up to the Acknowledgments page,

24:33.924 --> 24:38.285
And I'm just doing this because I don't have anything else to prove to you why I'm here.

24:38.925 --> 24:42.086
The second, I don't have anything to sell.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.066
I don't even know how to do that stuff.

24:45.046 --> 24:46.607
This book would not have been possible.

24:46.627 --> 24:48.287
This is the second paragraph here.

24:48.727 --> 24:54.968
This book would not have been possible without the expertise and invaluable insights provided by Jonathan J. Cooey and then a bunch of other people.

24:55.989 --> 24:57.229
First name that he mentioned.

24:58.226 --> 25:02.129
Not only that, but I'm in the index, and I'm quoted in that book six times.

25:02.189 --> 25:06.253
The last quote in that book is that they wouldn't even need a virus to do this.

25:07.214 --> 25:18.223
Now, the thing that he won't tell you and won't talk to me about anymore and Children's Health Defense, I believe, actually fired me for is that I think that these people are covering this up.

25:19.064 --> 25:19.905
I taught them

25:20.799 --> 25:32.304
Before this book was published, I taught all of the people that worked on this book the biology that I'm going to teach you now in much more detail, with much more questions and many more arguments.

25:33.044 --> 25:33.964
And I won them all.

25:34.945 --> 25:41.887
And you're not going to find any evidence of that in this book, because as Bobby told me to my face, this is not the book for those answers.

25:42.928 --> 25:46.149
And I'm sorry, but if we're going to save America, we need those answers right now.

25:50.552 --> 25:52.593
And so as it says up there, I was fired.

25:52.653 --> 25:58.577
So first he paid me for a whole year, and then the Children's Health Defense hired me.

25:59.217 --> 26:06.342
And when you get hired by Children's Health Defense, you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement because you might hear stuff and learn stuff, and you're not supposed to tell anybody that.

26:07.222 --> 26:16.608
At some point when they decided to fire me in December of 2023, right before the start of this year, they said that I was interfering with their ability to interact with their partners.

26:16.648 --> 26:17.609
I don't know what that means.

26:19.301 --> 26:20.162
but they let me go.

26:20.882 --> 26:23.504
Now, I didn't sign an NDA agreement when they let me go.

26:23.564 --> 26:26.847
They offered me $8,000 in an NDA, and I said no.

26:26.927 --> 26:31.110
So that means I can tell you those people pay well.

26:32.151 --> 26:36.555
I got $120,000 a year salary when they hired me there.

26:37.355 --> 26:46.443
They paid me for six months with the best insurance my family's ever had, and they threw me out with little more than an offer of nothing.

26:47.475 --> 26:59.230
Now, this started all based on the fact that they interviewed me for this book while I was a staff scientist for them, and they tried to record the video again because they said that the video doesn't sell the book.

26:59.290 --> 27:01.612
Well, that's because the biology's not in the book.

27:02.699 --> 27:04.960
So that's enough of that.

27:06.221 --> 27:07.201
Sorry, I got to point this way.

27:07.241 --> 27:08.161
They told me that already.

27:08.221 --> 27:12.603
So just in case you think that I'm full of it, they all know me.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.665
They've all given me private hugs.

27:15.745 --> 27:20.227
They've all told me how wonderful we think it is that somebody as clever as you is teaching immunology.

27:20.267 --> 27:21.427
We need more people like you.

27:21.747 --> 27:24.649
You should be teaching at every medical school in America.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.090
All of these people ignore me.

27:27.690 --> 27:29.291
How many times have you had

27:30.649 --> 27:39.951
a chance to take a picture with these people and have them write a little note that says, we think you're so awesome, or offered you a contract to write a book and then ignored you afterward.

27:40.932 --> 27:45.633
So I want to teach you in four movements why these people are liars.

27:45.713 --> 27:53.755
Biology is the way, and I mean this from the perspective of the irreducible complexity of biology that was present when your kid was born.

27:54.635 --> 27:55.876
It didn't need any fixing.

27:56.356 --> 27:57.416
It didn't need any shots.

27:58.979 --> 28:01.782
And that irreducible complexity is not there anymore.

28:01.842 --> 28:03.224
They don't want us to see that.

28:03.885 --> 28:06.027
And I am a biologist from a child.

28:06.088 --> 28:07.990
I'm a biologist because of my grandmother.

28:08.030 --> 28:09.712
I'm a biologist because I was a bird watcher.

28:09.732 --> 28:11.594
I'm a biologist because I used to keep snakes.

28:11.694 --> 28:18.042
I'm a biologist because ever since I was a child, I could look outside and see how complicated it was.

28:19.781 --> 28:24.764
Now, if we want to face these people, we have to be able to oppose them correctly.

28:24.844 --> 28:30.127
So first of all, we have to understand how they got us to teach our children this, because that's the goal of the pandemic.

28:30.908 --> 28:32.770
They don't want to tell you what happened.

28:32.790 --> 28:35.192
They want you to figure it out and teach your kids.

28:35.833 --> 28:36.894
That's how they've trapped you.

28:38.035 --> 28:43.960
And so, this is a slide that I'm stealing from my friend Veera Sharav.

28:44.481 --> 28:50.206
This is a statement that was made by a guy by the name of Edward Bernays in 1924.

28:51.407 --> 28:54.910
They didn't have any social media on your 12-year-old's phone.

28:55.851 --> 29:11.659
When they didn't have you following around a bunch of fake accounts on Twitter, they already knew that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the habits and opinions of us was not only necessary, but formed the basis for our governance.

29:12.559 --> 29:18.422
You can translate this to say that they can lie to you and they do it together in concert, and that's how they govern us.

29:19.181 --> 29:21.102
Now, you might have known that about 9-11.

29:21.142 --> 29:22.582
You might have known that about whatever.

29:22.802 --> 29:34.525
I did not know they were doing this with biology, and I was there in the midst of it, trying hard to figure out how to be the best biologist I could, and I failed, because this is how they do it.

29:37.566 --> 29:42.767
So these are the charlatans that you think have power over you, but they're not the only charlatans.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.448
These are the forward-facing ones.

29:44.528 --> 29:48.289
There are also these guys, like the intellectual dark web.

29:49.116 --> 29:53.138
put in place at the beginning of the pandemic to control the narrative.

29:53.178 --> 29:54.959
They don't even know what was going to happen.

29:54.979 --> 29:58.201
They just know that they were elevated before they should have been.

29:58.681 --> 30:02.143
Some of those people have been in signal chats with me.

30:02.263 --> 30:03.764
They have talked to me over the years.

30:03.824 --> 30:09.387
Brett Weinstein, for example, is somebody that has been learning biology from me for over three years, but you'd never know it.

30:10.167 --> 30:14.030
So I want you to understand how they got you to do this.

30:15.110 --> 30:18.232
They made it a mystery, like a Scooby-Doo mystery.

30:19.335 --> 30:23.938
That Scooby-Doo mystery was, is it a lab leak or is it a natural virus?

30:24.939 --> 30:28.642
Tony Fauci and Rand Paul were very good at arguing about that.

30:28.682 --> 30:30.343
You're so lying.

30:31.404 --> 30:32.524
And we all bought into that.

30:32.704 --> 30:41.351
It was a real big argument, such a big argument that none of us ever realized that the suppositions of the state were being enforced by that.

30:41.611 --> 30:42.952
You accepted the virus.

30:43.552 --> 30:46.254
As soon as you got into that argument, you accepted the virus.

30:46.754 --> 30:48.756
Unfortunately, once you argued about it,

30:49.970 --> 30:51.312
Novel treatments.

30:51.512 --> 30:53.654
You also were arguing about the novel virus.

30:53.694 --> 30:54.815
You're actually accepting it.

30:55.656 --> 30:58.019
And this is an organized thing.

30:58.759 --> 31:04.485
These people agreed that there are bat caves that have viruses that can go around the world.

31:04.526 --> 31:06.548
They agreed about it for decades.

31:06.728 --> 31:11.373
Peter Daszak was on 60 Minutes telling us about how this is just real.

31:12.622 --> 31:20.184
That's an illusion of consensus between the 60 Minutes guy, who says that Daisak is smart, and Daisak, who says he's smart.

31:20.625 --> 31:21.945
It's an illusion of consensus.

31:22.005 --> 31:37.670
It's two people agreeing to lie to you about pandemic potential in bat caves, or in cell culture, or in animal passage experiments, or God forbid they start stitching these genes together and make stuff that Mother Nature never knew existed.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.591
I know this is hard to hear.

31:41.530 --> 31:42.490
But these are all lies.

31:42.510 --> 32:06.636
These are all lies that are based on a wonderful couple decades of bamboozling you about what was accomplished with the Human Genome Project, bamboozling you about what's being accomplished with the National Cancer Institute, and bamboozling you about what's being accomplished with the National Institutes of Disease, and whatever they're called, NIDA.

32:07.576 --> 32:09.577
So this is the faith.

32:10.777 --> 32:12.918
This is the faith that Tony Fauci believes in.

32:12.938 --> 32:14.979
This is the faith that Peter Daszak believes in.

32:15.019 --> 32:22.964
But, oh yeah, this is also the faith that Robert Malone and Pierre Kory and Judy Mikovits all believe in, too.

32:23.964 --> 32:25.145
There is a novel virus.

32:25.725 --> 32:28.707
Millions of people died from it, but millions more were saved.

32:29.107 --> 32:35.671
And gain-of-function is so real that even if this virus wasn't a gain-of-function, the next one obviously could be.

32:36.151 --> 32:37.192
So what are we arguing about?

32:38.345 --> 32:45.244
And it's really interesting that all the people that have traveled the world for all these COVID summits and all these places, I've got photographs with all of them.

32:47.284 --> 32:49.906
And they all ignore me because this is the real truth.

32:49.986 --> 32:53.849
This is Noam Chomsky saying it a different way than Edward Bernays said it.

32:53.869 --> 33:02.436
The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of an acceptable opinion, but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum.

33:02.476 --> 33:03.937
Shoot, you can even write books about it.

33:04.937 --> 33:05.198
You know?

33:05.978 --> 33:07.199
You can even write books about it.

33:07.559 --> 33:10.722
And they can be very vigorous and very critical.

33:12.401 --> 33:15.002
but they reinforce the actual narrative of the state.

33:15.522 --> 33:17.142
And it is not fun for me.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.443
Please understand that.

33:18.643 --> 33:20.503
I don't expect to ever get to do this again.

33:21.424 --> 33:23.724
It's one of the reasons why I'm happy everybody's here.

33:23.764 --> 33:26.325
I wish there was a thousand more people.

33:26.385 --> 33:29.766
No one's ever going to give me a chance to speak like this again except for maybe Ed.

33:30.888 --> 33:32.168
So how was the pandemic created?

33:32.188 --> 33:33.528
I'm only going to do this once.

33:33.929 --> 33:44.691
I'm not going to use this much text anymore, but I want to say it once because I want you to understand that what I'm about to teach you with biology has hundreds of hours of study behind it.

33:45.351 --> 33:57.593
Like you spent four years passively and actively trying to solve the mystery of the lab leak gain-of-function virus, I need to inspire you

33:58.513 --> 34:03.176
to solve the mystery of these three statements that I'm going to make after this explanation.

34:03.216 --> 34:04.516
So how was the pandemic created?

34:04.596 --> 34:06.517
First of all, I told you it's Peter Daszak.

34:06.557 --> 34:09.079
I told you Ralph Baric.

34:09.139 --> 34:13.801
They seeded a gain-of-function narrative with scientific programs.

34:13.841 --> 34:14.682
What do I mean by that?

34:15.242 --> 34:18.584
They published papers with pandemic potential in the title.

34:20.745 --> 34:20.985
That's it.

34:22.301 --> 34:23.662
There's nothing else necessary.

34:23.942 --> 34:25.103
They've never found it.

34:25.123 --> 34:27.424
They don't prove it in those papers.

34:27.544 --> 34:30.686
I've spent four years trying to find it.

34:31.686 --> 34:34.448
And like a lot of these no-virus people, I didn't find it.

34:34.528 --> 34:40.871
I'm going to clear up the fact that the no-virus position is incorrect, but it's not completely wrong.

34:41.051 --> 34:42.892
That's the reason why it was so enticing.

34:42.952 --> 34:44.453
So first, they seeded the narrative.

34:44.853 --> 34:47.415
Don't forget, they also seeded the narrative in events like 201.

34:47.715 --> 34:51.197
I know you're all aware of it, but this also creates

34:51.937 --> 34:55.579
an illusion of consensus behind the scenes among these people in the suits.

34:55.639 --> 35:07.346
Everybody that gets to wear a lanyard gets confused if they show up at a meeting like this, and instead of being a red pill conference, it's a conference about everybody in the room agreeing that coronaviruses have pandemic potential.

35:07.986 --> 35:09.487
That's an illusion of consensus.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.209
If you walk into a room like that, you're not going to be able to fight it.

35:13.369 --> 35:19.253
So the next thing they did, these are really critical, because this is something that takes me many, many hours to teach.

35:20.194 --> 35:32.209
They actually put people on the Internet to talk about the crazy things that COVID does, because they already knew that then when they transfected you with the mRNA, that some of those crazy things would happen.

35:33.311 --> 35:49.023
They actually had people that were arguing with me for three years, making sure that I stayed on the right subject and never realized that they were actually trying to set up a narrative about a virus that had all these extra factors, extra problems.

35:49.063 --> 35:53.206
The one you may have heard the most of is amyloidosis or prions.

35:53.846 --> 35:55.426
That was seeded in March of 2020.

35:56.126 --> 36:00.167
And the reason why is coming up, because they always knew it was going to happen.

36:00.527 --> 36:04.528
The other thing that they did was, I guess that was number three, this was number four.

36:04.968 --> 36:12.350
So the other thing that they did, that team of people that had these stories in place, they also had mass casualty events.

36:12.370 --> 36:18.871
You may not be aware of it, but there's really no evidence in New York City that 24,000 people died in four and a half weeks.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.152
And if anybody in here is a fireman or a policeman, you know that if

36:23.672 --> 36:32.296
New York City had, instead of the normal 600 to 800 bodies every week, they started to have 5,000 bodies every week.

36:32.336 --> 36:34.177
A few more people would have seen those bodies.

36:34.638 --> 36:35.718
Now, we don't know what they did.

36:35.858 --> 36:36.939
We don't know if they're fake.

36:36.979 --> 36:38.940
We don't know if they move deaths around.

36:39.400 --> 36:43.602
But the bottom line is, is that it looks like a bomb went off in New York City.

36:44.143 --> 36:48.205
25,000 people were killed over five weeks, and then it went back to baseline for the rest of the

36:49.025 --> 36:50.547
I guess the lockdown stopped it.

36:51.228 --> 36:53.431
So these were actually seeded.

36:53.912 --> 37:02.483
If you look into New York City, you will find, number one, they never resuscitated anyone for stroke or heart attack in New York City for a month and a half.

37:02.663 --> 37:04.265
They just stopped.

37:04.285 --> 37:04.345
Why?

37:04.685 --> 37:07.349
Because if you give compressions, it might spread COVID.

37:08.706 --> 37:14.494
Now that was of course put on the news and they said that COVID's got this weird thing where it gives people heart attacks.

37:15.115 --> 37:21.063
But that was a lie and it was a lie told specifically about murders, murders in New York City.

37:22.972 --> 37:33.155
So making the response a national security crisis is how they got Pierre Kory, how they got Peter McCullough.

37:33.515 --> 37:35.016
And I know I'm saying names here.

37:35.056 --> 37:36.156
It's not about the names.

37:36.216 --> 37:38.016
I just want you to understand what has happened.

37:38.196 --> 37:43.418
I honestly believe, after many conversations with Peter McCullough, that he's got to have a gun to his head.

37:44.494 --> 37:56.399
Pierre Corey is another guy who, I don't know how many people are aware of it, but he was the witness which decided that George Floyd had suffocated and did not die of an overdose.

37:56.779 --> 37:58.520
He's not even certified in Minnesota.

37:58.580 --> 38:02.441
Why the hell was that guy in June of 2020 the witness?

38:02.921 --> 38:08.784
And also the guy who testified in the same month to the Senate that something crazy happened in New York City.

38:09.727 --> 38:17.853
Now, if you hear my voice breaking up, it's because I'm actually getting pretty scared now, because I'm saying stuff that I knew I was going to say, but I've never said before.

38:19.074 --> 38:21.236
The bottom line is that last line.

38:21.296 --> 38:30.703
They have conflated the toxicity of what they knew that transfection would do to you with this imaginary virus.

38:31.283 --> 38:37.287
Now, it's pretty hardcore to say that it's an imaginary virus, so I want you to understand how they did it.

38:38.128 --> 38:39.029
It's really important.

38:40.620 --> 38:45.642
Now, this is a guy in Italy who's trying to do a little schtick.

38:46.003 --> 38:48.984
He's trying to pretend that he's stopping the train, right?

38:49.284 --> 38:51.925
The train's run out of gas or it's, you know, brakes don't work.

38:52.486 --> 38:54.587
And he's going to go over here, he's going to chalk his hands up.

38:55.647 --> 38:56.808
He's going to push that train again.

38:57.848 --> 39:20.612
Now, I want you to think about the biology of disease and about pandemics, and I want you to imagine there's not one of those guys, but there's a Robert Malone, and a Meryl Nass, and a Mary Holland, and a Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and a Pierre Kory, and all these guys are together pretending to stop that train, and then you walk into the station, and they say, hey, hey, hey, can you help us?

39:21.272 --> 39:22.973
This train won't stop without our help.

39:22.993 --> 39:23.733
Can you help us?

39:25.319 --> 39:26.259
That's how they got you.

39:26.279 --> 39:27.240
That's how they got me.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.641
Can you help me write this book?

39:29.981 --> 39:31.982
We got to write this book to save the world.

39:34.243 --> 39:36.364
Can you help me spread the word of ivermectin?

39:36.384 --> 39:38.105
Because we got to save the world.

39:39.345 --> 39:41.306
It's all the same bullshit thing.

39:41.386 --> 39:45.388
I can tell you another great story that will make this really focus you.

39:46.168 --> 39:49.210
The Milgram experiment is something that a lot of people talk about.

39:50.011 --> 39:54.992
where people, three guys say that one line is one line and then the fourth guy's like, what?

39:55.572 --> 39:58.533
And he kind of agrees with them because he's confused by them.

39:59.353 --> 40:00.774
Nobody ever explains that right.

40:02.894 --> 40:03.815
Okay, so what?

40:04.295 --> 40:05.875
The Ash Experiment is the same way.

40:05.915 --> 40:09.456
It's not explained correctly because they use a lot of big terms.

40:09.556 --> 40:10.856
What are those experiments?

40:11.276 --> 40:12.817
This is how I teach my children.

40:13.962 --> 40:20.585
It's two people or more, excuse the explosion of spit, it's two people or more agreeing to lie to you.

40:21.005 --> 40:23.406
I want to give you a very good example of this.

40:23.586 --> 40:27.748
I have a 14-year-old son, a 12-year-old son, and a 7-year-old daughter.

40:28.388 --> 40:37.452
I'm trying very hard to keep her off of all the screens, but they have this thing with Minecraft, and the boys play Minecraft, and so they got the idea the other day.

40:37.852 --> 40:41.054
We're going to basketball, and I hear them talking in the thing.

40:42.314 --> 40:53.197
I made this world, and I want you to bring Freddy in it, and then you're gonna go in your room and you're gonna pretend that you hacked, you're some third person in the world that's not supposed to be there.

40:53.918 --> 40:58.659
And so, I'm saying to my sons in the car, I'm like, you know this is how they did the pandemic, right?

41:00.969 --> 41:03.471
I said, but listen to you, you're planning to lie to your sister.

41:04.251 --> 41:05.592
Do you think she stands a chance?

41:06.032 --> 41:06.612
She loves you.

41:07.152 --> 41:08.073
She trusts you guys.

41:08.593 --> 41:12.815
And you're going to stare at her and lie to her face saying you don't know who this third player is?

41:13.535 --> 41:14.756
Your brother's in the other room.

41:15.296 --> 41:18.617
And then when your brother comes in the room, you're going to agree to say, no, it wasn't me.

41:18.637 --> 41:19.858
It wasn't him.

41:20.198 --> 41:21.539
Wow, Freddie, who was it?

41:22.415 --> 41:24.537
I'm like, how long do you think you can keep her going?

41:24.577 --> 41:25.918
Well, we could keep her going forever.

41:26.458 --> 41:31.962
How long do you think Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Mary Holland, and Bobby Kennedy could keep me going?

41:34.344 --> 41:34.764
Pretty long.

41:36.025 --> 41:36.946
Especially if they pay you.

41:39.488 --> 41:47.054
So what I'm suggesting to you is that these people, if they coordinatedly lie to you and they do it well, you are done.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.976
So, these are the people.

41:51.297 --> 41:53.981
The ones I circle in yellow, I've had personal interaction with.

41:54.021 --> 41:59.408
I would step in front of a train knowing that the train would disappear because I'm telling the truth.

42:00.689 --> 42:05.656
Now, it doesn't matter about these people because I want to teach you how you can beat them.

42:07.395 --> 42:10.336
So how can we oppose an effective consensus?

42:10.496 --> 42:12.617
You know, vaccines just work.

42:12.657 --> 42:13.497
How can we oppose it?

42:13.537 --> 42:16.138
Well, we've got to learn the biology that defines it.

42:16.218 --> 42:16.658
This is it.

42:17.598 --> 42:18.718
You don't need to say anything else.

42:19.699 --> 42:21.599
This statement's been around for more than a year.

42:21.679 --> 42:27.401
This is one of the statements that I tried so hard to get somebody at CHD to frickin' use.

42:28.621 --> 42:30.282
Because this is what it's all about.

42:30.302 --> 42:33.963
It's saying it so that biologists can't argue with you.

42:35.080 --> 42:40.365
saying it so that people who understand the immune system are made to understand that this is the way it is.

42:41.706 --> 42:46.970
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

42:47.270 --> 42:47.551
Why?

42:47.571 --> 42:49.713
Well, because we don't know how the immune system works.

42:50.613 --> 42:51.494
And we never have.

42:52.115 --> 42:54.537
It's the most complicated system in your body.

42:54.577 --> 43:00.362
It's more complicated than your brain, because your brain, all the cells stay in the same place and they're connected to each other.

43:01.192 --> 43:07.775
The immune system is actually a symphony of independent cells that all communicates in ways we don't even fully understand.

43:07.815 --> 43:13.377
We have a few ideas, but it's a very, very poorly understood system.

43:13.457 --> 43:18.519
It is part of the irreducible complexity of our body that they can claim they get it, but they don't.

43:20.380 --> 43:26.943
Now, this is a way of teaching you the biology you need to understand to defend that last statement.

43:27.603 --> 43:29.024
This is a picture of your immune system.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.526
This is your body without a head, without legs.

43:33.467 --> 43:38.747
This is just the inside of your body is green, the outside of your body is black.

43:39.028 --> 43:41.688
Notice that the outside of your body includes this part, right?

43:41.788 --> 43:50.069
If I go to the next slide and color the outside all red, you will see that everywhere in your body is a barrier that's formed by epithelial cells.

43:50.709 --> 43:54.990
On the inside, barriers are formed by endothelial cells, but it's basically the same thing.

43:55.590 --> 43:59.391
They keep stuff in, they keep stuff out, and those barriers are real.

44:00.658 --> 44:06.922
And if those barriers break down, if your brain barrier is leaky, if your gut's leaky, we all know that that's not good.

44:08.242 --> 44:11.144
But we don't really understand it in the context of vaccination.

44:11.184 --> 44:13.685
So I want you to understand it in the context of vaccination.

44:13.725 --> 44:14.426
That's your lung.

44:15.386 --> 44:19.569
That's air and food coming in, and then, you know, stuff coming out the other end, right?

44:19.609 --> 44:21.350
This is a very simple diagram.

44:23.311 --> 44:26.413
So epithelium is organized from the inside out.

44:27.512 --> 44:31.395
Your whole immune system is organized from the inside out.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.518
It's like an army that's facing the enemy.

44:36.800 --> 44:44.987
And so endothelium, and that's the epithelium inside, the endothelium lines all of your vessels, is dynamically regulated.

44:45.007 --> 44:45.808
What do I mean by that?

44:45.868 --> 44:48.230
It's opened and closed by your immune system.

44:49.031 --> 44:51.012
If it wants stuff to get through, it will open it.

44:51.783 --> 44:52.804
And then it will close it again.

44:52.824 --> 44:55.505
And T-cells are the ones that do that.

44:55.566 --> 45:01.169
T-cells open and close local regions of endothelium so that immune cells can go in and fix stuff.

45:01.810 --> 45:03.071
And otherwise, they can't go there.

45:03.531 --> 45:04.752
It's called licensing.

45:06.193 --> 45:09.095
So barriers is another way to say it.

45:09.115 --> 45:11.896
And I think this is for the people that don't do biology.

45:11.976 --> 45:12.797
It's the barriers.

45:12.837 --> 45:14.978
They're organized from the inside out.

45:16.235 --> 45:19.016
And the barriers are also dynamically regulated.

45:19.056 --> 45:21.858
They're opened and closed by the immune system.

45:23.118 --> 45:24.079
So lung and gut.

45:24.919 --> 45:28.021
Can I explain disease as best I can?

45:28.301 --> 45:28.821
Let's try.

45:29.481 --> 45:30.482
So let's imagine

45:31.690 --> 45:35.692
The biology that they tell you of replicating RNA is somewhat real.

45:36.572 --> 45:39.113
So the RNA replicates in your lungs, right?

45:39.153 --> 45:40.273
That's what's supposed to happen.

45:40.973 --> 45:42.054
Then you start coughing.

45:42.074 --> 45:47.096
It gets coated in mucus and that RNA and those proteins go down into your gut.

45:48.056 --> 45:49.216
And what happens in your gut?

45:49.297 --> 45:50.397
What's happening in your gut?

45:51.633 --> 45:52.614
Everybody knows, right?

45:52.634 --> 45:53.655
You're absorbing food.

45:54.336 --> 45:59.061
Well, if the immune system is there, this is something that they're not teaching you ever.

45:59.522 --> 46:08.352
If the immune system is lining here, it's got a very different job than the immune system that lines here, because the immune system that lines the lungs is a no-go.

46:09.513 --> 46:12.777
The immune system that lines the gut is a all-go.

46:14.443 --> 46:23.146
What you don't realize is that the T-cells that are present in the lung are opposed by T-cells in the gut.

46:24.126 --> 46:41.632
In other words, when your T-cells in your lungs are activated by any stimulus, let's not call it a virus right now, let's just call it a stimulus, that stimulus response results in mucus and protein going down to the gut, which activates tolerant T-cells.

46:42.512 --> 46:49.556
Those tolerant T-cells are what's responsible for turning off these cells that were activated by your inflammation in the first place.

46:50.256 --> 46:56.560
It is a crescendo and decrescendo that happens in a concert of several different immune cells.

46:57.480 --> 47:03.444
Now what I want you to ask is, if you tried to teach your immune system by putting something there, what would it learn?

47:05.925 --> 47:11.028
If you put a combination of really toxic chemicals that they call adjuvants

47:11.733 --> 47:16.557
and you put a couple recombinant proteins there, what would your body, what kind of signal would that be?

47:16.577 --> 47:18.018
It's not a very good one.

47:19.039 --> 47:27.685
It's so bad, actually, that once I realized this, I was yelling at people at CHD, because I'm like, why aren't we teaching this?

47:28.566 --> 47:33.070
Why don't we teach people why intramuscular injection of vaccines is awful?

47:33.570 --> 47:36.052
Smallpox was scratched onto your skin.

47:39.145 --> 47:44.937
to be a skin subcutaneous vaccine but that's hard to do it needs more skill than

47:51.212 --> 47:52.153
Did I need to repeat that?

47:52.213 --> 47:52.513
Sorry.

47:53.674 --> 47:55.495
Intramuscular injection is really easy.

47:55.535 --> 47:56.536
It takes no skill.

47:58.357 --> 48:00.398
Smallpox was scratched onto your skin.

48:00.438 --> 48:01.659
That was called variolation.

48:02.380 --> 48:08.064
And the measles vaccine used to be a subcutaneous vaccine, but that's hard to do because the skin's very thin.

48:08.924 --> 48:13.207
So the way they fix this problem is they tell you a story that intramuscular injection is just as fine.

48:13.247 --> 48:13.648
It's fine.

48:13.688 --> 48:14.268
It's the same.

48:14.448 --> 48:14.949
It's not.

48:15.629 --> 48:17.010
It's not even close to the same.

48:17.110 --> 48:21.154
You can't teach your immune system from the inside where that's where it protects you.

48:21.814 --> 48:24.316
Sorry, I should have had a different slide up there, but that's okay.

48:25.237 --> 48:26.158
So, transfection.

48:27.999 --> 48:29.520
You've heard me say this word a couple times.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.902
I need to make this point really good, really well.

48:32.723 --> 48:36.166
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent, and it always was.

48:36.846 --> 48:37.106
Why?

48:38.817 --> 48:40.118
Because it's actually two words.

48:41.439 --> 48:44.762
And both of these words were on Robert Malone's resume for 15 years.

48:45.622 --> 48:48.144
They were on my resume for 10 years.

48:48.985 --> 48:54.249
Transfection is the use of RNA to express a protein where it's not supposed to be.

48:55.209 --> 48:58.192
Transformation is using DNA to do the same thing.

48:59.016 --> 49:16.065
And every biologist in America and in the EU that ever worked on an academic bench and wrote a grant has transfected a mouse, or has transfected their cell cultures, or has transfected a monkey, and knows darn well what those two words mean.

49:16.886 --> 49:32.422
And yet at the beginning of the pandemic, none of them, except for me, unfortunately, stood up at a medical school and said, hey, just in case you're unaware, the investigational vaccines that they're talking about on PBS NewsHour, they're just transfections.

49:33.843 --> 49:36.186
Mr. Cooey, we don't want you to come in anymore.

49:36.786 --> 49:39.089
Please turn in your badge and keys and don't come back.

49:40.165 --> 49:41.287
That's how fast it happened.

49:42.028 --> 49:44.111
All I said was, it's transfection.

49:44.151 --> 49:46.495
Why don't we just tell everybody we already know how this works?

49:47.696 --> 49:48.758
Nobody wanted to say that.

49:48.798 --> 49:49.920
Well, they must have fixed it.

49:50.080 --> 49:53.986
Robert Malone told you that Peter Cullis told them that they fixed the lipid nanoparticle.

49:54.026 --> 49:54.727
That's why he took it.

49:57.430 --> 49:58.811
All of these people should have known this.

49:59.211 --> 50:01.012
I mean, I can't say it any simpler.

50:01.392 --> 50:05.935
There were products in 1990 that were called lipofectamine.

50:06.495 --> 50:11.618
It's actually called the best transfection agent money can buy.

50:12.718 --> 50:13.499
This is the same.

50:13.999 --> 50:16.440
It's a lipid nanoparticle with an RNA in it.

50:16.540 --> 50:18.501
I used it on my mice all the time.

50:19.041 --> 50:24.644
I kept paper after paper of transfecting the brain of mice with an RNA in a lipid nanoparticle.

50:26.328 --> 50:29.594
with an adenovirus, the other thing they used at the beginning.

50:36.653 --> 50:37.813
I just want to butt in here.

50:38.053 --> 50:39.954
I actually said that completely backwards.

50:40.014 --> 50:41.254
I looked at my stuff again.

50:42.674 --> 50:48.395
Almost all of my experiments were adenovirus transformations of neurons in the brain.

50:48.855 --> 50:51.636
And I've only used mRNA once that I'm aware of.

50:51.676 --> 50:53.356
So that should have been said the other way.

50:53.376 --> 50:56.916
I don't think that really changes anything about the talk, but I just thought that I should say that.

50:57.376 --> 51:00.237
In case somebody diligently looked it up, you could see that that was wrong.

51:00.377 --> 51:06.418
Shouldn't because it uses RNA, but that's a technicality that only every medical school faculty in America should know.

51:08.163 --> 51:09.144
But they didn't know.

51:10.224 --> 51:10.905
So that's it.

51:11.165 --> 51:12.226
That's as easy as it is.

51:12.646 --> 51:17.689
To oppose that, you just have to tell them that these are technologies they all knew.

51:17.769 --> 51:18.689
They were all using them.

51:19.150 --> 51:27.295
So to call it an investigational vaccine, and then to go along with the illusion of consensus, essentially these people are criminally negligent as well.

51:27.315 --> 51:28.255
I'm sorry, but they are.

51:28.755 --> 51:31.237
Any one of them could have spoke up, and I was the only one.

51:31.257 --> 51:32.658
And I'm not tooting my own horn.

51:33.058 --> 51:34.139
I want you to see how...

51:35.748 --> 51:39.489
We're in a pretty bad place because these people continue to ignore me.

51:39.529 --> 51:42.010
They can't argue with me, so they ignore me.

51:43.150 --> 51:46.111
Now, how can we avoid our children accepting this pandemic?

51:46.171 --> 51:48.712
Mythology is probably the hardest part to teach.

51:48.752 --> 51:51.733
It takes me the longest, so I'm going to just try and do it as best I can.

51:52.253 --> 51:55.994
I still have 30 minutes, so I'm probably going to be able to circle back on a lot of this stuff.

51:57.196 --> 51:58.857
Viruses are not pattern integrities.

52:00.198 --> 52:04.160
The easier way to say that would be RNA cannot pandemic, but pattern integrity I really like.

52:04.220 --> 52:10.383
This is a term that comes from Buckminster Fuller, who was one of the coolest scientists that nobody talks about.

52:11.104 --> 52:15.346
Buckminster Fuller explained a pattern integrity with an analogy.

52:16.266 --> 52:26.432
He said that you can take three types of rope and you can weave them together so that you have a nylon rope that flows directly into a cotton rope and then flows directly into a hemp rope.

52:27.312 --> 52:36.820
And if we tie a knot at the top of this, a simple knot, and we slide this simple knot through the three materials, the knot is a pattern integrity.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.483
It's not nylon, it's not cotton, it's not hemp.

52:40.744 --> 52:42.845
The pattern integrity is the knot.

52:43.426 --> 52:52.694
And what you are, what your child is, what that bird outside is, what a cactus is, what a pine tree is, this is a pattern integrity because chemicals and materials come in,

52:53.454 --> 52:58.299
And they're reorganized, and they're a part of that pattern integrity for a little while, but not forever.

52:58.339 --> 53:03.724
You've heard these discussions about, I guess, everybody has one water molecule that was once part of Napoleon.

53:04.224 --> 53:07.026
This is the same kind of idea, a pattern integrity.

53:08.288 --> 53:14.673
An RNA or a DNA molecule inside of a lipid membrane is not a pattern integrity.

53:15.774 --> 53:19.137
It's really important to understand that, because they have told you a story

53:19.838 --> 53:24.961
about a virus that can come into your cells and make them do something they don't already do.

53:25.741 --> 53:31.304
This is the biggest lie of all, and it's the one where, really, when it hit me, I fell to the floor.

53:31.364 --> 53:33.425
The best way I can explain it is really simple.

53:34.625 --> 53:40.388
If you have a cuckoo clock, you cannot hijack a cuckoo clock and make it make toast.

53:41.249 --> 53:44.831
There's nothing in a cuckoo clock that can be rearranged for it to make toast.

53:44.871 --> 53:49.353
You could make it read the wrong time, you could make it cuckoo too loud or not enough,

53:49.972 --> 53:51.614
You could even make it turn backwards.

53:53.015 --> 53:58.259
But you can't hijack a cell to make it do something that it doesn't already do.

53:59.140 --> 53:59.901
What does that mean?

54:00.281 --> 54:10.650
Well, as a biologist, I knew immediately because I was working in the brain where two years before, a guy, I was working on this protein for a very long time.

54:10.711 --> 54:13.353
It's going to be kind of tough to follow, but I think you can do it.

54:14.082 --> 54:18.644
We have these proteins in our brain that come on immediately when a neuron is activated.

54:18.704 --> 54:20.965
The way we found them is we gave mice cocaine.

54:21.826 --> 54:30.930
And then we killed the mice very quickly and we stained their brains and we found that certain places in the brain lit up very hot with this protein called ARC.

54:31.932 --> 54:35.516
And ARK is a protein that rearranges the skeleton of neurons.

54:35.556 --> 54:38.119
And so it basically makes them able to change shape.

54:38.759 --> 54:50.892
And so the hypothesis was is that cocaine makes these mice learn really fast because it mobilizes these neurons all at the same time and then they learn in one exposure that cocaine is great and now I'm addicted.

54:52.099 --> 54:57.885
Now, what's interesting about that is that that ARC protein was then used for 15 years.

54:58.085 --> 55:06.773
In every lab around the world that was working on the brain, they would just stain for ARC and say, these are the neurons that were activated by our experience.

55:06.853 --> 55:08.875
So if they scared the mice, they would look for ARC.

55:09.375 --> 55:13.219
If they gave them, let them breathe, they would look for ARC.

55:13.339 --> 55:16.342
If they taught them, maybe they showed them

55:17.763 --> 55:25.190
Stimulus from above that was supposed to scare them and then they would kill them animal and look for arc and say that these are The neurons that were activated by this gene.

55:25.671 --> 55:27.072
Why am I telling you this story?

55:27.653 --> 55:34.038
because in 2018 Neuroscientists found out that this arc protein was actually packaged in

55:34.779 --> 55:47.894
in small viral-like particles and shed from the neurons that expressed it to other neurons so that they too could remodel their synapses even though they weren't activated to express the gene.

55:48.908 --> 55:49.769
That's a mistake.

55:50.749 --> 56:06.578
I said there that the protein was packaged and is sent to other neurons and it's not the protein, it's the RNA for Arc protein, which is pretty significant because a protein packaged up is not a genetic signal that can be an exosome or endosome.

56:07.098 --> 56:09.780
And so I did make that, that's a mistake.

56:09.880 --> 56:15.263
It should have said the RNA because it's definitely the RNA that's packaged in that observation.

56:17.685 --> 56:27.532
This became a really big story because it was an endogenous virus in the brain associated with learning that I had just assumed was a protein that you could stain.

56:28.693 --> 56:37.600
Now it turns out that we had to remodel the way we studied these circuits because some of the neurons were expressing that gene because they got it from the neuron next to them.

56:38.420 --> 56:39.601
Now why am I telling you this?

56:39.661 --> 56:41.503
Keep in mind, the cuckoo clock

56:43.717 --> 56:47.302
You can't make your cells do something they don't already do.

56:47.842 --> 56:59.978
Now, what if every living mammal, every living tree, every living fungus, anything that was a pattern integrity would shed genetic signals?

57:00.919 --> 57:02.021
In fact, we already know.

57:02.734 --> 57:09.677
There are whole departments around the world, biology departments, that study something that are called exosomes.

57:10.518 --> 57:11.478
What are exosomes?

57:12.419 --> 57:20.042
Exosomes are viral-like particles that are released by your cells all the time, and some people will try to tell you that they're just garbage, but they're not.

57:21.023 --> 57:22.544
It's not just from cancer cells.

57:22.964 --> 57:29.207
It's also from every tissue in your body, communicating with each other and the immune system.

57:30.185 --> 57:50.194
Now what I want you to see here that's starting, I'm trying to develop, is that David Baltimore, Bob Gallo, Stanley Plotkin, Hilary Kaprowski, all these people that are two or three mentors back in the chain that invented all of these ideas, vaccination to polio, vaccination to yellow fever.

57:51.134 --> 57:55.576
These people all put this in our outside.

57:56.917 --> 57:59.558
These people all teach a biology, and I know you know it,

58:00.197 --> 58:01.118
You have DNA.

58:01.258 --> 58:02.939
It gets translated to RNA.

58:03.079 --> 58:05.740
It goes through a ribosome, and you get protein.

58:06.380 --> 58:06.781
That's it.

58:07.801 --> 58:09.242
But then they tell you this story.

58:09.302 --> 58:11.523
David Baltimore calls it the Baltimore Scheme.

58:12.044 --> 58:21.309
There are DNA viruses, single-stranded DNA viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses, negative-strand RNA viruses, positive-strand RNA viruses.

58:21.749 --> 58:28.473
And all these things are forms of genetic signals that we just don't use.

58:29.229 --> 58:30.310
We've never bothered to.

58:31.110 --> 58:42.518
But somehow they tell you that these non-pattern integrities have developed all kinds of ways to use single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, negative, positive-stranded.

58:42.999 --> 58:46.421
They all got these special enzymes, and they can do stuff that you can't.

58:47.962 --> 58:52.826
But it turns out that if you actually go into the literature, you will find that we do copy RNA.

58:53.737 --> 59:03.230
We do package it, which means that the viruses aren't making us do something that we don't do, which means they've told us a story about how our immune system works that's wholly a lie.

59:04.191 --> 59:09.058
And the only person that I heard up here over this whole day say lie was David Webb.

59:10.325 --> 59:17.648
Just like when they explain the Milgram experiment or the Ash experiment, they don't just say that it's three people agreeing to lie to you, and it's pretty hard to see through it.

59:18.788 --> 59:19.528
But that's what it is.

59:20.449 --> 59:24.490
And now imagine if Tony Fauci and Robert Malone agreed to lie to you.

59:25.492 --> 59:27.613
where they actually look like they're opposing each other.

59:28.514 --> 59:31.896
Now imagine there's 10 or 15 of those people, because there are.

59:32.377 --> 59:42.243
And they all have agreed for 20 years never to tell you that your body signals with RNA and DNA, and that these signals are all around us.

59:42.643 --> 59:46.606
What they want you to believe is that when they test for something, what they find is what they find.

59:47.066 --> 59:51.189
And this is where the PCR test, again, was totally misconstrued.

59:51.889 --> 59:53.150
What does everybody think it was?

59:53.430 --> 59:54.131
Cycle count.

59:55.168 --> 59:58.430
Well, anybody at a university knows that that's just ridiculous.

59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.912
PCR is extremely accurate if used correctly.

01:00:03.773 --> 01:00:06.554
And there are lots of ways to make it even more accurate.

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:19.141
So the idea that they told you this very simple story, that we just cycle it farther and then we get positives, is still a story that assumes that there's just one thing to look for, and it's new.

01:00:19.621 --> 01:00:20.742
And so it's very easy to find.

01:00:21.843 --> 01:00:27.446
And so what they are agreeing, and I mean it, Robert Malone is agreeing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:27.526 --> 01:00:32.068
and is agreeing with Tony Fauci to tell you, is that this stuff is all outside of you.

01:00:32.688 --> 01:00:33.989
And we can measure it all.

01:00:34.649 --> 01:00:39.392
And you have none of it, you do none of it, and none of these signals could possibly be yours.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.193
And that's a fundamental lie.

01:00:41.713 --> 01:00:45.595
Because again, you cannot make a cuckoo clock do something that it doesn't already do.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:50.073
So let me explain why this works.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.636
Anybody here not familiar with the idea of giving your girlfriend a mixtape?

01:00:55.397 --> 01:00:57.078
I think this will work with you guys.

01:00:57.159 --> 01:00:59.420
Sometimes there are adults that are a little too young.

01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:01.622
But I used to do this all the time.

01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:05.305
And if you know how this works, it's very similar in biology.

01:01:05.646 --> 01:01:06.226
Trust me.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:11.207
They have shown you, Brian Artis showed it to you.

01:01:11.888 --> 01:01:17.432
Brian Artis showed you pictures of how they're making that venom, but he didn't tell you what they started with, and that's probably not his fault.

01:01:17.492 --> 01:01:20.474
He's got his own story to tell, but I'll tell you what they start with.

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:21.695
They always start with DNA.

01:01:22.856 --> 01:01:25.598
So, the mixed tape there is RNA.

01:01:25.978 --> 01:01:28.620
That's what they find in the wild, in the anuses of bats.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.181
They find signals of RNA.

01:01:30.802 --> 01:01:34.967
But when they put that RNA in culture, it never copies.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:36.529
It doesn't grow.

01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:38.312
It just doesn't work.

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:42.116
And the reason why it doesn't work is because RNA is not easy to copy.

01:01:42.237 --> 01:01:43.698
RNA doesn't copy very well.

01:01:43.899 --> 01:01:48.625
And when you copy it, it makes errors because DNA is double-stranded.

01:01:49.426 --> 01:01:54.891
That means when you open it up, you have two copies, and that means when you put it together, if it doesn't go back together, you've made a mistake.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:02:01.256
RNA's single-stranded, so when you make copies, you don't know if you've made a mistake, because you never check it with the original.

01:02:01.557 --> 01:02:02.978
I was doing that on stage, that's why I did that.

01:02:02.998 --> 01:02:14.688
So RNA, no matter how it's used in your cells or anybody else's cells, we've known for 40 years that RNA's not as accurate as DNA, and that's why when they make venom, as Brian Artis showed you, they start with DNA,

01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:21.480
And they have that bacterial culture, and those big steel vats make as much of that DNA as possible.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:30.605
Then they lyse the bacteria, they destroy them, they extract the DNA, and then they convert that DNA to RNA if they need it, for example, like Moderna or Pfizer.

01:02:31.865 --> 01:02:42.451
Same process that they make monoclonal antibodies with, except instead of going one step further from mRNA to a monoclonal antibody, which is a protein, they just stop at the mRNA.

01:02:43.303 --> 01:02:44.063
Now, here's the deal.

01:02:44.663 --> 01:02:47.104
mRNA can't be copied.

01:02:47.124 --> 01:02:55.307
That's why virology of RNA is probably a complete hoax, and nobody will argue with me about it.

01:02:56.287 --> 01:03:01.189
The reason why it's a hoax is because, like a mixtape, you can't make a good copy of RNA.

01:03:01.249 --> 01:03:09.712
So if you take four genes that you find in the wild and you use Barrick's wonderful no-see-um technique to stitch all those together,

01:03:10.632 --> 01:03:15.757
It still is not going to grow in a culture until you make a large copy of it in DNA.

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:18.359
Because that copy doesn't work, right?

01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:25.786
If you remember mixtape, if you made a mixtape for your girlfriend that she really liked, she couldn't make a copy of it for her girlfriends because it would be too hissy.

01:03:26.527 --> 01:03:27.567
It wouldn't sound very good.

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:30.050
And I know that's a kind of poor analogy,

01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:34.149
When you translate RNA, there are always errors.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:38.640
It is several orders of magnitude worse to copy RNA than DNA.

01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:40.524
And that's why when you make venom,

01:03:41.266 --> 01:03:46.610
You make the DNA first, and then change it into the venom by going to mRNA and protein.

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:49.193
So Brian could have told you that, but he didn't.

01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:49.813
But that's all right.

01:03:50.213 --> 01:03:53.216
The point is that DNA is a CD.

01:03:53.336 --> 01:03:57.559
So if I make the mixed CD, now I can make as many copies of that as I want to.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.223
Understand the same thing is happening with virology.

01:04:02.263 --> 01:04:08.048
If you think about the RNA virus as a mixtape, they cannot grow it in culture.

01:04:09.465 --> 01:04:11.566
But they can definitely make a DNA copy of it.

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:18.508
Kevin McKernan has told you that the ability to make synthetic DNA has gone from thousands of dollars to pennies.

01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:24.111
Brian Artis showed you that they can make these conatoxins by the ton.

01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:28.392
Well, they make it from DNA to RNA to protein.

01:04:29.312 --> 01:04:32.914
The same way they made DNA to RNA to Moderna.

01:04:33.054 --> 01:04:35.495
The same way they made DNA to RNA to Pfizer.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:40.725
This is all the same process that Robert Malone has been an expert in for 10 years.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:51.357
There's no possible way that Merrill Nass doesn't know that this is the same way that they make monoclonal antibodies, in the same way that they make venom, in the same way that they made these shots.

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:55.341
And this is the way they do virology.

01:04:55.722 --> 01:04:57.644
They make a DNA copy of it.

01:04:59.147 --> 01:04:59.647
That's this.

01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:08.312
And because, as Kevin McKernan and all the people that work for the Human Genome Project will tell you, we don't know how the genome works, but we can sure make DNA cheap.

01:05:10.293 --> 01:05:11.414
So we make that DNA.

01:05:12.474 --> 01:05:13.075
That's the CD.

01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:18.136
And they use a bacterial culture with viruses.

01:05:18.156 --> 01:05:24.158
They told you the story that viruses are so big we have to make smaller plasmids and then we have to stitch them all together.

01:05:24.198 --> 01:05:25.439
They made a whole story.

01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:32.201
And there's all kinds of people that are sure they figured it out because there are these linkages there and they can see that they stitched it all together.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:33.242
That's this.

01:05:34.192 --> 01:05:35.933
They make five DNA molecules.

01:05:35.953 --> 01:05:38.155
They grow them in five different cultures.

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:39.896
Then they lyse those things.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.117
They take that DNA out.

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.538
And there's lots of ways to do it.

01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:48.702
They could use commercial RNA polymerase, which is just an enzyme that takes DNA and makes RNA.

01:05:49.162 --> 01:05:51.404
That's the way they did the Pfizer and the Moderna shot.

01:05:51.844 --> 01:05:54.606
They could also take that DNA and put it on cell culture.

01:05:55.286 --> 01:06:02.151
And then as Andy Kaufman has told you for four years, they'll just scrape that supernatant off there and say, there they are.

01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:02.992
Those are the viruses.

01:06:03.749 --> 01:06:04.189
That's it.

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:10.510
It is literally transforming and transfecting cell culture, and they call it virology.

01:06:12.211 --> 01:06:16.652
And so, unfortunately, a lot of these no-virus people have not been able to explain this to you.

01:06:17.552 --> 01:06:22.093
They have stopped at the, they don't isolate, they don't purify, they don't culture.

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:25.453
But then explain what they do and why it's a giant lie.

01:06:26.134 --> 01:06:28.494
Why they had to murder people in New York to hide this.

01:06:29.474 --> 01:06:32.595
Because virology is based on synthetic DNA.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.701
made in large quantity that you cannot get from an anus of a bat.

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:45.023
Look, they do this in cell culture, they do it in mice, they do it to share with each other.

01:06:45.323 --> 01:06:47.064
But understand this, please.

01:06:48.184 --> 01:06:56.606
If you start with the virus that you find in a bat, there is no way, not one methodology,

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.048
to produce enough of that to share with five labs.

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:16.574
But the CDC says that they have a sample from Washington, from February of 2020, from the Sohomish County man, that they are still distributing virus from, has a control for all the experiments around the world.

01:07:16.774 --> 01:07:17.915
That's not a lie, that's real.

01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:23.417
And they want you to believe that they're just growing that virus from that dude that we just let go.

01:07:24.215 --> 01:07:25.156
We don't even know who he is.

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:30.358
The Sohomish County man, the very first case in America, in Washington.

01:07:30.939 --> 01:07:31.399
You don't know him.

01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:34.240
He was the first one.

01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:36.302
They did monoclonal antibodies from him.

01:07:36.342 --> 01:07:36.962
They did everything.

01:07:36.982 --> 01:07:38.643
But we didn't bother to take a picture of him.

01:07:38.683 --> 01:07:39.383
We don't know who he is.

01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:43.686
Now, the reason why this is important is what I've been hinting at.

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:48.488
The same process that Brian Ardis showed you that they make venom, they made the mRNA.

01:07:50.436 --> 01:07:55.742
They made a big vat of DNA, and they took that DNA out, and they converted it to RNA.

01:07:56.103 --> 01:08:01.770
And instead of making a protein like they would if they were making antibodies, they just put that in a lipid nanoparticle and said, here, it's done.

01:08:02.471 --> 01:08:03.552
Now, why is this important?

01:08:06.075 --> 01:08:13.522
Because they could have made it like they do all other pharmaceuticals, just like they make, what Bryan Artis said, they make venom.

01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:19.107
They could make the PCR product that they looked for.

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:20.648
Make it cheap.

01:08:21.589 --> 01:08:22.870
DNA does not degrade.

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:25.773
You want to find it on a cruise ship?

01:08:26.253 --> 01:08:27.354
We can make it for pennies.

01:08:28.976 --> 01:08:30.417
You want to find it in a bat?

01:08:30.757 --> 01:08:32.058
Well, that's tough.

01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:35.281
But you want to make it synthetic, you can do whatever you want.

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:36.903
Now understand what this means.

01:08:37.523 --> 01:08:45.590
This means that this story, that you can stitch things together and then all of a sudden lose control of a molecule, is a mythology.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:51.375
The only way this works is if they create a purity that they cannot create in nature.

01:08:52.055 --> 01:08:59.862
I hope everybody is hearing it, because here, when you're doing these experiments, sorry, up here, they can't even make a gram.

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:12.221
But here, we can make tons, tons of a DNA that's pure, which means that that's a PCR test gold standard.

01:09:13.262 --> 01:09:20.644
If they put it in the water and said, oh, wow, the coronavirus is rising in the sewers, that is so cheap to do.

01:09:21.877 --> 01:09:32.799
that is so easy to do, to plant these signals somewhere, to say that we've found something, to claim that it is circulating, requires a couple big assumptions.

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:37.581
Number one, no exosomes, no RNA, no signals other than viruses.

01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:39.901
All outside of you, nothing else.

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:45.442
Never mind the fact that sometimes you kiss somebody and it feels really good, and other times it's like, whoa.

01:09:46.262 --> 01:09:47.683
You think that's just smell?

01:09:48.323 --> 01:09:48.583
Come on.

01:09:49.798 --> 01:09:54.899
We're talking about a high level of chemical communication that occurs through all of us all the time.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:56.520
They would love you to ignore it.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:01.001
And this is just the tip of the iceberg here because it's only synthetic DNA.

01:10:01.621 --> 01:10:10.923
And that's why certain people, like people of the Human Genome Project, like people that have been speaking in front of the WHO for 10 years, are the only ones that are coming to save us.

01:10:12.064 --> 01:10:17.285
Because the legacy of virology is alive from AIDS,

01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:20.863
It's a lie from them.

01:10:22.144 --> 01:10:23.764
That virus was never isolated.

01:10:23.804 --> 01:10:25.185
That virus was never found.

01:10:25.385 --> 01:10:26.325
We know that now.

01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:28.406
But these same people are in charge.

01:10:28.986 --> 01:10:35.528
These same people are still pushing this biology that I will go to my grave knowing is a lie.

01:10:36.029 --> 01:10:38.049
And it's not because there are no viruses.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.770
It's not because there are no signals.

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:48.613
It's because they have taken a very beautiful and irreducible complexity of genetic signaling around us and told us it's viruses.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.061
Virus, the Greek word for poison.

01:10:53.143 --> 01:10:54.024
This is just lying.

01:10:54.845 --> 01:10:59.509
And you have to distill it down to lying because that's how you explain it to your kids.

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:06.935
Now, if we go farther, remember that they call these infectious clones.

01:11:07.676 --> 01:11:08.737
I want to challenge you.

01:11:08.837 --> 01:11:14.101
One of the mysteries you should solve is go home and start using PubMed and search for infectious clones.

01:11:14.121 --> 01:11:15.963
You will find a thousand papers

01:11:17.028 --> 01:11:22.190
where they tell you that, well, we found this RNA in the wild, but it didn't really grow in culture.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:30.293
So we made a synthetic pure quantity of it, and we applied it to a cell culture, and now we're studying viruses.

01:11:32.093 --> 01:11:32.533
No, you're not.

01:11:32.573 --> 01:11:36.675
You're studying synthetic transformation or transfection of your cell culture.

01:11:36.715 --> 01:11:37.095
That's it.

01:11:38.447 --> 01:11:50.370
And these virologists are either not sophisticated enough to understand because of the way that academia is, and some of them that are sophisticated enough to understand are doing very, very well for themselves.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.411
So this is also infectious clones, but just bigger.

01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:57.032
Now, if you don't use virology's terms, but you use my terms, you would just say this.

01:11:58.072 --> 01:12:07.135
Synthetic DNA and RNA in quantity can give you a PCR positive, but even better, the illusion that they really got you on was the sequencing.

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:13.268
Did you know that before the pandemic, we had less than 200 full sequences of coronavirus?

01:12:14.269 --> 01:12:14.629
Less than 200.

01:12:14.809 --> 01:12:17.630
We tried really hard to find them.

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:24.392
And the claims of 200, I would go so far as to say really only 50 or 53 of them were full genomes.

01:12:24.412 --> 01:12:27.512
The rest of them were kind of like, yeah, we didn't find everything, but we said we found enough.

01:12:28.493 --> 01:12:27.512
200.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.353
But it's really about 50.

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:36.495
They tell you that they have been tracking this virus for a year, and they're at 16 million sequences.

01:12:38.237 --> 01:12:43.332
So one molecule or I do want to clarify here that I'm

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:49.831
I'm specifically referring to papers that have published a novel virus.

01:12:49.891 --> 01:12:57.355
So there's lots of viral sequences that predate the pandemic that were uploaded, but a lot of them weren't published.

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:58.836
And so then what does that really mean?

01:12:59.577 --> 01:13:08.162
If it's an illusion of consensus that the national security state has been creating, then one of the ways to create that would be to upload sequences, right?

01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:08.942
It's real easy.

01:13:09.022 --> 01:13:13.745
So we don't need to take their word on anything at this stage, but I just want to clear that up.

01:13:15.081 --> 01:13:16.863
Wow, I look tired, holy cow.

01:13:17.023 --> 01:13:19.185
A mud puddle in a market.

01:13:19.905 --> 01:13:40.762
This molecule, without any enzymes of its own, without any energy needed, without any metabolism, without any form of pattern integrity, has somehow managed to perpetuate itself around the world in high fidelity for five years, such that we can sequence it with a fidelity never demonstrated with any virus before.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.244
But, you know, Peter Daszak was trying.

01:13:48.243 --> 01:13:49.564
And so I'm kind of off here.

01:13:49.584 --> 01:14:03.033
I have like seven minutes left, and I really feel as though it is important to try to revisit this, because I don't want us to teach it to our kids.

01:14:03.093 --> 01:14:10.678
This is the most important thing, because all of us are being egged on to teach this to our children.

01:14:11.391 --> 01:14:23.381
That's why Mary Holland says that we want to have a big top tent of health freedom, and that we want to fight for... against mandates, or we want to fight for free speech, or we want to fight for free choice.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:26.243
I'm sorry, but this is not how we win.

01:14:26.844 --> 01:14:35.591
We win when we say that the vaccine schedule in America, when compared to any other country in the free world, is a criminal enterprise.

01:14:36.632 --> 01:14:39.094
That's what we have to say, and nobody will say it.

01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:49.263
How easy would it be for Bobby Kennedy to have said that once instead of saying, I just want placebo trials or something like this?

01:14:52.304 --> 01:14:55.385
And it goes on and on, because this is what they lied to you about.

01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:58.786
This is the graph they showed you, showed you this on the news.

01:14:59.206 --> 01:15:03.307
And they said that all this excess death is from the virus.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:08.008
What you see there is COVID in red, and what you see there in blue is pneumonia.

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:18.657
Since 2014, between 5,000 and 2,500 people have died every week to pneumonia.

01:15:19.197 --> 01:15:26.720
And then suddenly at the beginning of the pandemic, we somehow forgot how to treat pneumonia, and three or four times as many people started dying of pneumonia.

01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:28.121
That's murder.

01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:29.882
Why is that murder?

01:15:30.751 --> 01:15:32.072
because they lied about it.

01:15:32.513 --> 01:15:37.316
This is the picture that they should have shown you, because this is all-cause mortality since 2014.

01:15:39.438 --> 01:15:44.482
It's 55,000 to 70,000 people in America every week dying.

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:45.783
Did you know that?

01:15:46.384 --> 01:15:49.927
Three million people die every year in America, and that's freaking normal.

01:15:50.828 --> 01:15:56.092
And yet somehow or another, by not showing you this graph, they convince you that something crazy was happening.

01:15:58.829 --> 01:16:00.530
They'd lost control of nothing.

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:11.217
They lied about the fact that they created a lot of fear and uncertainty and doubt by sending a bunch of old doctors home because this virus might affect old people.

01:16:11.257 --> 01:16:14.839
We're going to have to leave the ERs to the attendings no more.

01:16:15.519 --> 01:16:17.321
Let the young kids run it.

01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:19.122
Do not resuscitate orders in New York.

01:16:19.602 --> 01:16:21.903
This one is the one that no one will talk about.

01:16:22.784 --> 01:16:25.926
If there's doctors here, please help me with this because this one is killing me.

01:16:27.465 --> 01:16:28.786
They killed everybody like this.

01:16:29.747 --> 01:16:31.749
There are studies that you can find.

01:16:32.249 --> 01:16:33.650
ICU doctors knew this.

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:41.376
If you give somebody high flow oxygen, they don't need it, and you give it to them for a few hours, do you know what happens?

01:16:42.037 --> 01:16:45.199
They know because they did a monkey study about it in 1989.

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.824
80% pure oxygen over two hours is enough to give you something called ARDS.

01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:53.300
Interesting.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.464
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:16:57.385 --> 01:16:58.586
I don't know where I heard that before.

01:16:59.227 --> 01:17:02.671
Anyway, the point is, is that by the time you got on the ventilator, this was done.

01:17:03.572 --> 01:17:10.181
A lot of people think they were killed by the ventilator, or by Merdesivir, or by Midazolam, but the whole way they got everybody on that train,

01:17:11.129 --> 01:17:15.976
was they showed up the hospital, they said they had COVID, their pulse ox was a little low.

01:17:16.396 --> 01:17:22.505
Half LCCC told you to go to the hospital if you had a pulse ox less than 94.

01:17:25.248 --> 01:17:27.752
That's pretty funky because if you go to the hospital and they give you

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.692
high flow oxygen, which they've done to thousands.

01:17:31.932 --> 01:17:39.437
Everybody that I've ever looked at their medical records, that's where they started, even though that's not why they died, because that was weeks later.

01:17:39.477 --> 01:17:41.398
That's how they got the progression to happen.

01:17:42.276 --> 01:17:47.840
People got progressively sick in the hospital because of that, because of supplementary oxygen.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.101
You're supposed to have a monitor on that.

01:17:50.141 --> 01:17:56.365
There's supposed to be all kinds of humidity and, you know, you're supposed to have a monitor so that it changes concentration.

01:17:56.765 --> 01:18:00.948
And these people were complaining in New York City about running out of oxygen.

01:18:00.988 --> 01:18:06.291
There's even videos of these people saying that we're giving people 60 liters a minute.

01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:07.051
60 liters a minute!

01:18:11.195 --> 01:18:15.876
That's not your grandfather sitting in front of the TV with a little thing in here.

01:18:17.097 --> 01:18:17.797
That's not that.

01:18:18.017 --> 01:18:20.598
That's wind, 60 liters a minute.

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:25.499
Now, the other things that they lied about, of course, the list is very long.

01:18:26.099 --> 01:18:28.780
They put people on ventilators, but they had to get them there first.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.002
One of the ways that they got them there was they said, well, we don't want COVID to spread, so maybe we can use the ventilators to stop that.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.282
The lack of antibiotics use is probably the worst thing that they did.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:39.902
They did that around the world.

01:18:40.243 --> 01:18:40.903
Because why?

01:18:40.923 --> 01:18:47.247
Because viral pneumonia doesn't respond to antibiotics.

01:18:47.567 --> 01:18:49.468
What a complete lie that is.

01:18:49.508 --> 01:18:50.108
That's murder.

01:18:50.248 --> 01:18:52.810
That's just secondary bacterial pneumonia being ignored.

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:54.831
They sent people back to...

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:58.313
old folks' homes with secondary pneumonia, and they lied about it.

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.354
Do you know why I know that?

01:18:59.415 --> 01:19:13.350
Because Robert Malone was on a podcast in 2011 with a fake doctor by the name of Paul Cottrell, and he said that they're actually killing people by giving them dexamethasone, which is actually a hammer for the immune system, and then they send them back to the care homes and they die.

01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:16.293
So Robert Malone knew they were murdering people,

01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:23.283
He didn't really tell anybody, not really anybody that mattered, because he was on that silly podcast and nowhere else.

01:19:24.504 --> 01:19:27.626
Poor use of steroids, that's dexamethasone the wrong way.

01:19:28.287 --> 01:19:33.771
Remdesivir and midazolam, you're all familiar with that, but lots of people died of urinary tract infection.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:38.415
My father-in-law died of urinary tract infection in the Netherlands in the beginning of the first year.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:48.185
My mother-in-law took the vaccine just so that she could go see him in a hospital and watched him die of a urinary tract infection, which is not pretty.

01:19:49.565 --> 01:19:56.287
I lost an ex-girlfriend who took the shot to be on a Hollywood set and then got advanced brain cancer and died.

01:19:57.188 --> 01:19:59.128
And I actually also lost my best friend.

01:19:59.368 --> 01:20:01.509
I could not tell him this stuff.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:06.671
He was in my house in December, sorry, October of 23.

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:14.862
And he laughed at me in my garden when I told him that your whole family may be in danger because you've all taken this.

01:20:14.922 --> 01:20:16.803
And it wouldn't surprise me if one of you dropped dead.

01:20:17.504 --> 01:20:19.326
And on December 4th, he did drop dead.

01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:22.829
And I was not invited to the funeral because they didn't want to argue about why it happened.

01:20:23.945 --> 01:20:31.089
And so I'm doing this really just for Nathan and for Annie and for the people that I know for sure died, and for the people that lied to me.

01:20:32.489 --> 01:20:33.550
There's more, right?

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:41.914
They're not talking about the opioid deaths, but the opioid deaths have gone through the roof since 2019, and these are not excess deaths.

01:20:42.014 --> 01:20:46.037
These are the reason why the life expectancy in America has gone down.

01:20:46.077 --> 01:20:50.639
It's not because of COVID, it's because we're letting people die on the street that are not supposed to be dying.

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:58.256
We lost 500,000 people to the opioid pandemic in three years, and we're not counting them as opioid deaths.

01:20:58.276 --> 01:20:59.777
We're talking about excess deaths.

01:21:00.698 --> 01:21:02.600
And opioids are not on the radar.

01:21:03.161 --> 01:21:05.864
Even when Bobby Kennedy talks about it, he uses the wrong numbers.

01:21:07.719 --> 01:21:10.560
So death certificate fraud was another big time.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.781
I'm up with time, so I'm going to go really quick now.

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:14.562
Death certificate fraud was big.

01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:16.183
There were financial incentives.

01:21:16.223 --> 01:21:17.663
They paid people to call it COVID.

01:21:17.703 --> 01:21:20.725
There were whole, of course, stories about that that I don't need to tell you.

01:21:21.205 --> 01:21:24.626
Track and trace convinced people that there was something happening.

01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:30.269
And of course, there was PCR fraud, lateral flow test fraud, and the sequencing fraud that I've talked about before.

01:21:31.329 --> 01:21:35.531
Going very quickly, there's zero epidemiological evidence of spread.

01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:37.652
We went through that before.

01:21:37.972 --> 01:21:47.097
Keep in mind, you guys are old enough to remember that in the 1990s, they were already talking about the pending Medicare crisis, that Medicare was gonna cost us so much money that America was gonna go broke.

01:21:47.477 --> 01:21:51.919
It cost $500,000 for the last six months of most Medicare patients.

01:21:52.299 --> 01:21:53.480
They've known this for a decade.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:57.122
What an easy way to avoid that big bump in costs.

01:21:57.542 --> 01:22:02.925
The last thing I would like to say is that Children's Health Defense is a group of lawyers that never says strict liability.

01:22:03.425 --> 01:22:05.386
That should tell you right away that they're lying to you.

01:22:05.806 --> 01:22:15.709
Strict liability is the legal term for when you're responsible for the products that you make, and we should just restore strict liability to all pharmaceutical products in America, and we'll be done.

01:22:16.209 --> 01:22:21.031
The Seventh Amendment violation is another thing that these lawyers don't talk about, including Aaron Seery.

01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:30.293
The Seventh Amendment is your ability to sue for any damages over $20, which the PREP Act and the VICP and the CICP completely prevent you from doing.

01:22:30.314 --> 01:22:45.718
Yet Aaron Seery uses those fake kangaroo courts to pursue vaccine damage instead of saying, hey, wait a minute, we only need one case in one state to have go up to federal court and the federal courts say, well, the PREP Act is actually unconstitutional.

01:22:45.738 --> 01:22:46.498
I guess we'll strike it.

01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:54.512
Yet, where is CHD with a case in every state trying to get up to circuit court to get a Seventh Amendment throwout?

01:22:54.852 --> 01:22:55.393
They're nowhere.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:57.535
And I'm being kicked off the stage.

01:22:58.095 --> 01:23:01.659
Transfection in healthy humans was rushed, but it worked.

01:23:01.999 --> 01:23:05.863
An RNA can cause a pandemic is exactly what they want you to teach to your kids.

01:23:05.903 --> 01:23:09.487
And what I want you to teach to your kids is these charlatans need their power taken away.

01:23:09.947 --> 01:23:11.989
because you inherited it from your parents.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:16.492
These are the same charlatans, and this is the truth.

01:23:16.973 --> 01:23:19.395
It was always criminally negligent, and it can't pandemic.

01:23:19.435 --> 01:23:21.236
If you want to find out more, please find me.

01:23:21.276 --> 01:23:22.397
I want to teach high schoolers.

01:23:22.437 --> 01:23:23.118
I want to teach you.

01:23:23.138 --> 01:23:24.619
I want to help lawyers.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.220
Thank you.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.023
Bye-bye.

01:23:29.043 --> 01:23:30.364
Thank you.

01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:31.705
Man, you are amazing.

01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:32.685
Thank you.

01:23:32.786 --> 01:23:33.226
Yes, JJ.

01:23:34.787 --> 01:23:35.608
Beautifully done.

01:23:40.748 --> 01:23:43.910
So that is, yeah.

01:23:44.691 --> 01:23:47.852
I'm gonna leave myself off here a little bit.

01:23:53.255 --> 01:23:53.756
Let's see.

01:23:55.577 --> 01:23:57.698
Yeah, so that's the talk.

01:23:57.738 --> 01:24:00.720
I didn't watch it all, so I watched the last bit I didn't see.

01:24:04.093 --> 01:24:06.795
Yeah, anyway, I hope you enjoyed it.

01:24:06.835 --> 01:24:11.860
I think I'm going to leave it right here and just kind of relax and think about that a little bit.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:17.365
I will be on tomorrow as usual and we've got to start this pattern again because

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:23.046
Very soon, I want to start these mini courses so that we can all be better at arguing this.

01:24:24.066 --> 01:24:30.787
And that's got to happen really soon because we don't have much time, I think, to get that far ahead, especially because we have so much momentum.

01:24:32.207 --> 01:24:44.450
And so, yeah, if you want to help me out, make sure that you're also sharing Mark Kulak's work and sharing Mark Kulak's website, that database, and his work.

01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:45.730
I've really made a...

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:51.813
a big difference in my ability to do what I did up there on that stage.

01:24:52.494 --> 01:25:01.279
A lot of discussions with him, a lot of talk with him has really propelled my understanding of this forward and really propelled my ability to explain it.

01:25:01.339 --> 01:25:07.003
So, hat tip to Mark Kulak and I will see you guys again tomorrow, I guess.

01:25:28.735 --> 01:25:31.937
I think somebody put the link in the chat of the Odyssey thing.

01:25:31.957 --> 01:25:34.399
I don't have it on hand right now.

01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:38.222
But I know it's there.

01:25:38.242 --> 01:25:40.063
Let me see if I can see it in my history.

01:25:40.143 --> 01:25:43.445
I can put it in if somebody doesn't beat me to it.

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:45.046
I got it right here.

01:25:46.087 --> 01:25:47.448
This one looks right.

01:25:48.889 --> 01:25:49.890
I don't know who did this.

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:51.931
If you want to cop to it, that would be great.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:59.565
because, I don't know, somebody, I guess, recorded the stream and then put it up on Odyssey.

01:25:59.605 --> 01:26:02.447
So whoever you are, thank you very much for doing that.

01:26:02.888 --> 01:26:04.649
So far, I don't think there's another copy of it.

01:26:04.689 --> 01:26:06.051
So now we have this.

01:26:07.912 --> 01:26:09.133
We'll see where we go from here.

01:26:10.835 --> 01:26:12.216
But I'll definitely be here tomorrow.

01:26:12.236 --> 01:26:13.637
I need a shower.

01:26:14.298 --> 01:26:14.598
Yikes.
