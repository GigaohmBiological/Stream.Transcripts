WEBVTT

00:01.982 --> 00:02.103
you

00:45.049 --> 00:46.610
but you can tell if someone's lying.

00:47.270 --> 00:49.031
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

00:50.813 --> 00:51.313
And I have lied.

00:51.413 --> 00:52.674
I'm sure I'll lie again.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.375
I don't want to lie, you know?

00:54.435 --> 00:55.435
I don't think I'm a liar.

00:55.535 --> 00:56.576
I try not to be a liar.

00:56.596 --> 00:57.997
I don't want to be a liar.

00:58.017 --> 01:00.779
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

01:05.421 --> 01:07.423
I think truth is good for kids.

01:07.443 --> 01:11.165
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:11.676 --> 01:13.658
We want everybody to feel good.

01:14.239 --> 01:15.620
That's not the way life is.

01:31.903 --> 01:35.145
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

01:35.505 --> 01:35.985
It can't.

01:36.605 --> 01:40.367
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:41.287 --> 01:45.389
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

01:45.409 --> 01:51.212
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

01:51.292 --> 01:51.752
It can't.

01:52.313 --> 01:56.094
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:56.975 --> 02:01.057
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:03.806 --> 02:30.134
So, how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?

02:33.161 --> 02:34.007
Senator, we run ads.

02:46.289 --> 02:54.716
One thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:54.937 --> 03:03.264
One thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

03:05.867 --> 03:18.775
Now, what we do have evidence for are these plasmids are in there without any question that this has been replicated in many places around the world and there are consequences for having these residual pieces of DNA left inside the vaccines.

03:22.517 --> 03:28.040
That doesn't look fake and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

03:28.661 --> 03:33.924
That doesn't look fake and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

04:18.823 --> 04:19.144
you.

05:13.750 --> 05:32.900
Hey, guys, it's ZDoggMD, VP, MD, Vinay Prasad, Marty McCary, 3Ms, 3Ms.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.501
Good to see you guys.

05:35.521 --> 05:39.383
Dude, we're the three horsemen of the COVID apocalypse according to pretty much everyone.

05:41.061 --> 05:42.222
Big financial ties.

05:42.242 --> 05:48.327
Probably the worst, historically, was Paul Offit, University of Pennsylvania professor.

05:48.367 --> 05:49.448
Listen to this.

05:49.468 --> 05:50.629
Big financial ties.

05:51.150 --> 05:56.594
Probably the worst, historically, was Paul Offit.

05:56.835 --> 06:03.400

And Marty and Jay are operating in a very complicated political landscape and they just don't have the latitude to act unilaterally.

06:33.867 --> 06:38.432
Secretary Kennedy and Marty and Jay

06:39.266 --> 06:48.508
are operating in a very complicated political landscape, and they just don't have the latitude to act unilaterally.

06:49.909 --> 06:59.871
You know, we have like an 80-year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection, and this has never been a problem for any other vaccine, and I just don't see why it would be for these vaccines.

07:01.098 --> 07:11.084
You know, we have like an 80-year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection, and this has never been a problem for any other vaccine, and I just don't see why it would be for these vaccines.

07:14.686 --> 07:16.467
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:17.047 --> 07:17.948
Welcome to the show.

07:18.008 --> 07:23.151
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.412
I have some apologizing to do.

07:26.492 --> 07:30.655
I see some comments in the chat about the last stream was excellent.

07:31.616 --> 07:33.037
I tend to disagree.

07:33.057 --> 07:39.522
I made a very, very big error in watching that podcast live.

07:41.944 --> 07:43.586
I feel awful about it.

07:44.286 --> 07:46.308
I watched the show back a couple times.

07:46.628 --> 07:55.875
And while I agree, there are a few analogies and explanations in there that are spot on, dead on, balls accurate, that I will never forget and always use.

07:57.276 --> 08:08.585
There is a level of rawness in my reaction to the video, which is inevitable because it was fifth generation warfare.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.727
Because the whole script

08:12.076 --> 08:25.823
that got us here broke down in front of me as I listened to Brett and Heather talk to one another on what clearly was a script in which they wholeheartedly believe.

08:25.863 --> 08:32.427
This is the part that really broke my heart after the stream and after I watched it and prevented me from being able to do anything on Friday.

08:34.548 --> 08:39.651
Because I finally could see it, that if they are naive podcasters,

08:41.032 --> 08:42.709
than actually Brett and Heather?

08:44.238 --> 09:11.481
are in some twisted way victims of the same fifth generation warfare that is censoring Mark and I, is also promoting Brett Weinstein and preventing him from realizing how far over his skis he is, how malevolently he's been used to corral hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people into behaving on what would otherwise be considered obviously irrationally.

09:13.928 --> 09:23.491
And it is a combination of ego attacks and payment and whispers in his ear and trusted friends that are actually having people whisper in their ear.

09:26.532 --> 09:43.117
I suddenly had pity for Brett and Heather because I realized that as much as I've been meddled with, I must presume that Brett and Heather are also being meddled with or are somehow just not even at the level to play there.

09:44.349 --> 10:02.358
And either way, it means we're in a much more malevolent trap than I thought we were, because it's not just scripted actors, but it is their victims between whose social media feeds we are trapped, within whose social media podcasts we are trapped.

10:02.478 --> 10:05.000
A lot of these people are scripted, but indirectly,

10:06.127 --> 10:10.550
A lot of these people have been on a script for so long they don't even know it anymore.

10:10.991 --> 10:15.174
And so many of these people simply aren't sophisticated enough to see it.

10:18.836 --> 10:28.864
And so all of this anger that I've had for the last four or five years has been a result of the fifth generation warfare convincing me that these people have to know.

10:30.100 --> 10:37.863
convincing me that these people are just ignoring me because they want their fame and fortune, but it's much worse than that.

10:39.804 --> 10:51.809
There might only be a very few, select few actors that really get it and the rest are just trying to keep their job or keep their heads on straight.

10:53.549 --> 10:57.311
The vast majority of people haven't even read 50 hours of books in their lifetime.

10:58.024 --> 11:01.846
never mind in their adult lifetime, never mind in the last five years of COVID.

11:04.328 --> 11:15.255
And all of us, all of us as social animals are going to constantly be vulnerable to the many biases that this, that we have as social animals.

11:15.335 --> 11:22.359
And so I have to be humble enough to say that I still don't know what's going on either, but I am quite certain that I'm close.

11:23.911 --> 11:35.578
The only mistake that I've been making is overestimating how much everybody knew and overestimating the obvious bad motives that these people must have if they're ignoring me when in reality, I don't know.

11:36.679 --> 11:44.163
Maybe Brett Weinstein was told that from the very beginning that Jonathan Couey was a problem that needed controlling.

11:44.844 --> 11:47.545
And so that you needed to talk to him and ask him what he knows.

11:47.605 --> 11:49.326
And if you don't understand it, it doesn't matter.

11:49.366 --> 11:51.748
Just get him to fill up this signal chat and we'll do the rest.

11:54.727 --> 12:07.774
and attributing a mastermind status level or a national security agent level to Brett Weinstein or Jessica Rose or John Baldwin, that's absurd.

12:08.135 --> 12:10.676
Even Steve Kirsch would be absurd.

12:11.857 --> 12:22.803
There only need to be a few central players and a few central script accepting employees that will do exactly what they're told and nothing else, and then the rest can just be spontaneous.

12:24.588 --> 12:32.078
And so had I performed up to speed, had I performed how it was necessary, I would have been rotated on stage for a little while.

12:34.721 --> 12:46.652
But I do still think that at the core of this, there are actors who know full well they are acting and have accepted the role of actor as part of the governance mechanism on social media.

12:47.453 --> 12:52.838
And so it is with righteous anger that we seek those people out and want to identify them.

12:53.418 --> 12:56.000
But we must do it with very, very much care.

12:56.901 --> 13:05.123
understanding that even those that are the deepest inside of this illusion could actually be just innocently trapped there.

13:07.143 --> 13:17.425
That's the part of it that became so difficult to process over the weekend that I had grossly overestimated and I couldn't see it for what it was.

13:17.465 --> 13:19.066
There's no other explanation

13:20.123 --> 13:31.046
for how it's possible that these kinds of events could be organized where somebody like Brett Weinstein could be there or Brian Hooker or Jessica Rose.

13:31.146 --> 13:36.428
People who, by their own admission, don't know.

13:37.848 --> 13:42.450
Brett Weinstein's wife doesn't know what she's doing, otherwise she would have never

13:43.697 --> 13:51.003
put out a podcast where she said that I kind of agree with Jonathan Cooey who insists we should call this transfection and then never said it again.

13:52.684 --> 13:56.307
She was told not to say it again, but I don't really know why.

13:56.487 --> 14:12.519
I presume it has to do with Brett's father and the intellectual property that was reset when everybody decided to call these things gene therapies instead of their old name, which would be transformation or transfections, in which case there's no intellectual property to be had here.

14:13.541 --> 14:17.644
But that doesn't mean that Brett and Heather understand why they're being told to say that.

14:22.006 --> 14:29.031
And they could have been told a complicated lie that I'm not aware of or can't come up with that makes it justifiable in their mind.

14:30.912 --> 14:41.999
Some imaginary goal that they're moving toward that they believe Robert F. Kennedy is moving them toward their old friend that they know through their dad who worked for his dad.

14:44.977 --> 14:55.825
But I do know that there are central figures like Robert Malone and his wife, Jill Glasspool Malone, who cannot be discarded as unwitting participants or people who have been played.

14:55.905 --> 14:58.807
This is one of the central players.

14:59.908 --> 15:02.690
Kevin McKernan is another central player.

15:03.030 --> 15:08.554
His connection to the Human Genome Project means that he knows the extent to which the

15:10.236 --> 15:14.500
The genetic fallacy of RNA viruses has been exaggerated.

15:14.780 --> 15:34.297
The genetic fallacy of high, high fidelity sequencing has been exaggerated for a long time and how the seemingly deep, the seeming exponential decreased in the cost of sequencing has been misconstrued as progress in understanding the human genome itself.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.309
And that's definitely something that they have done over the last 10 years.

15:39.369 --> 15:42.769
Wow, we can make photocopies of Chinese books better and better and better.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.270
And that means we're getting closer to understanding Chinese.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.411
And so these people don't all have to know.

15:51.891 --> 15:53.571
Ryan Cole doesn't have to know.

15:54.571 --> 15:56.792
Big Tree even doesn't really have to know.

15:56.852 --> 15:58.692
You know, he wanted to be on TV his whole life.

15:59.212 --> 16:00.813
Brett Weinstein doesn't have to know.

16:00.873 --> 16:03.193
He could just be kind of an unsophisticated guy.

16:05.043 --> 16:09.928
who got involved with people that are way over his head, with concepts that are way over his head.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.970
The guy's not a real biologist.

16:12.510 --> 16:14.152
He's a guy who's been told he is.

16:17.415 --> 16:27.926
And so we are at a crossroads here, but it is a crossroads where some people need to be, rather than outed, just ignored, just forgotten, just left behind.

16:29.895 --> 16:49.610
What we need to do is get starting on building the foundation of something new, a new model of biology that gets us out of this mess completely and sets us up with the right questions to ask when people try to push us back toward this bad biology evolution because DNA, where pandemics happen and can happen again.

16:50.905 --> 17:18.239
And so this premise that I have, and this is something that I have to apply 100%, just like I'm trying to suggest to you, if you really believed at the beginning of the pandemic, like I did, that the two-party theater was a theater, then you have to also accept the fact that it's very likely that elections, more or less, are also theaters, and that the outcome of elections is not really left to chance, even though it is portrayed as such on television.

17:19.215 --> 17:34.158
If you accept that, which I think is not a very far jump to make, then from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, to Joe Biden, to Donald Trump has all been a national security theater.

17:34.778 --> 17:37.058
At the heart of which has been this pandemic.

17:37.679 --> 17:44.760
The heart of which has been this population pyramid signal, which was threatening to

17:46.121 --> 17:55.967
potentially bankrupt many of the Western economies because of this overload of old people that would stop paying taxes and start pulling away from the system, costing the system money.

17:57.288 --> 18:06.353
And so we have been putting in place on social media and on regular media and in the movies, people into clear view.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.455
That's a trademarked word for me, clear view.

18:11.195 --> 18:13.736
meaning their narrative started to get seeded.

18:13.796 --> 18:18.718
Donald Trump got in, in home alone, not by accident, but because they were going to use him.

18:21.819 --> 18:31.643
That guy Fetterman in Pennsylvania was an extra in a movie a couple of years before he ran for Senate, not by accident, on purpose.

18:33.749 --> 18:40.090
Bret Weinstein wasn't fired by Evergreen and then put in front of the Senate to whine about it on accident.

18:40.170 --> 18:41.110
That was on purpose.

18:42.751 --> 19:00.634
Just like Vinay Prasad wasn't promoted in 2017 as a going-against-the-grain doctor and faculty member who did his high school in DeKalb or La Porte, Illinois, Indiana, but actually that was scripted.

19:01.835 --> 19:03.415
And so people were put in place,

19:04.960 --> 19:16.725
And of course, if you see Obama, Trump, Biden, Trump, and then you see what all these people were doing during the Trump, Biden, Trump period, it's actually pretty shocking.

19:18.346 --> 19:29.291
Because it's during the first Trump administration that Brett Weinstein is put in place, that Sam Harris is put in place, that all these podcasts are put in place, that Joe Rogan is put in place.

19:31.977 --> 19:41.920
And so all of these people that are in clear view are in need to know basis scripted actors, meaning they give, they're given talking points and they have agreed to talk about them.

19:43.900 --> 19:55.804
Maybe they're given some tips about how not to wax intellectual about them, but more likely they're given scripted talking points and sub talking points, and they're told to stick to them and everything is going to be great.

19:57.014 --> 20:00.236
And I don't think that any of them knew what they were going to be used for.

20:00.276 --> 20:07.441
I don't think any of them knew how long they would be on stage and how long they would have to be a need-to-know basis scripted actor.

20:07.482 --> 20:13.065
But that's the only explanation for why in 2022, we can hear Heather say one thing.

20:13.506 --> 20:19.230
And then in 2025, we can see her say something completely absurd and wrong.

20:22.930 --> 20:28.232
And that's how we get here with the obvious murder and lies that nobody seems to be able to talk about.

20:28.292 --> 20:35.914
So I really think this resetting of my language is important.

20:35.994 --> 20:37.775
It's important also for my heart.

20:37.855 --> 20:40.836
It's important for the way I feel every day when I wake up because

20:41.974 --> 20:59.568
Feeling like I am being ganged up upon by people who know what they're doing is a lot more awful feeling to wake up to every morning than waking up to what is effectively a scripted national security theater on social media that by definition can't know who I am.

21:01.070 --> 21:04.312
And by definition, its effectiveness is defined by me.

21:05.373 --> 21:06.074
In other words,

21:07.506 --> 21:12.189
their ability to keep Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:12.229 --> 21:30.980
and Mary Holland from seeing the truth that I'm telling about them and from my work having any effect on the narrative they are trying to establish is the best evidence for the effectiveness of the military social media programming.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.901
It's the best example.

21:32.941 --> 21:34.282
There is no other example.

21:35.171 --> 21:52.886
What other example would you point to besides Mark Kulak, of people, or Joe Marshall, of people, or maybe even Dan Cohen, of people who are trying to get a message out, have followers that follow them, but when new people show up and new people share them, or new people hear the story, it doesn't seem to affect them.

21:54.547 --> 22:02.494
No matter what Dan does to tell people that it's a giant theater run by people who just want to kill, it doesn't work.

22:03.865 --> 22:04.926
It's not going anywhere.

22:06.046 --> 22:11.329
And instead, we get these amplified protests in the street, all over the place, yada, yada, yada.

22:11.389 --> 22:19.052
And even somebody like Rabbi Shmuley gets more coverage than Dan Cohen has an American trying to be an American about it.

22:21.053 --> 22:27.676
And I think this is the reality, is that social media is highly effective, but it's effective on both sides.

22:27.756 --> 22:28.417
It protects

22:29.454 --> 22:38.739
the puppets that it's using, and it also prevents the people that it's not using from becoming equivalent to the puppets.

22:40.180 --> 22:57.590
And so everybody on social media that's just relaxing thinks that social media is comprised of people who have risen because of a lot of hard work and persistence, when in reality, social media is comprised of people who have been put in place.

22:58.951 --> 23:09.656
And people who are putting in the time and the effort to try and rise on social media are selected from and then scripted in their fake rise.

23:09.916 --> 23:21.561
And no one is allowed to spontaneously rise unless maybe they are doing something completely innocuous like making review videos about fast food or something like that.

23:24.105 --> 23:24.586
Actually, J.J.

23:24.626 --> 23:31.273
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

23:31.793 --> 23:38.841
I think there was just something about, that doesn't look fake, and... We're not pretending to be experts, we're trying to figure it out.

23:39.261 --> 23:40.261
just like all of you are.

23:40.321 --> 23:45.924
And we bring a particular evolutionary toolkit that most people don't have, but we'd love for everyone to have it.

23:46.004 --> 23:58.429
And we bring particular experiences that happen to mean that we know stuff about science funding and bats and such and public health that the so-called experts probably didn't see coming.

23:58.709 --> 23:59.589
Yep.

23:59.769 --> 24:10.131
So, okay, so, so I need to ask for forgiveness for you from you, my viewers, my supporters, and everybody that would potentially not watch me because I blew it last week.

24:11.752 --> 24:19.653
Because what I could see in that face in my imagination was a smug know it all, who knew she was lying and happy about it.

24:19.693 --> 24:22.914
But of course, that's not the most parsimonious explanation.

24:24.554 --> 24:32.317
The most parsimonious explanation is what I put on that other slide up there, that they actually do believe they were censored.

24:34.277 --> 24:42.460
They actually do believe that they were fighting for truth and that they had some of it, and that's why they were even more sure that the censorship happened.

24:44.661 --> 24:46.962
It's not possible to act this well.

24:48.561 --> 24:50.603
That's what made me so sad over the weekend.

24:50.763 --> 24:53.185
All of this anger has been horribly misplaced.

24:53.225 --> 25:04.373
It's also the explanation that makes the most sense for why Brett Weinstein was able to walk up to me at the Pittsburgh Brownstone Conference and pick up my name tag, read it, and then walk away.

25:06.775 --> 25:11.919
Because he was never in that signal chat with me listening and trying to figure out what I was saying.

25:11.959 --> 25:17.223
He was in that signal chat just to respond and make sure that somebody else could read what I was saying and use it.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.762
And am I mad that he was letting himself being used?

25:23.822 --> 25:26.463
I guess so, but you know, he's got a connected dad.

25:26.503 --> 25:28.724
His dad worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

25:28.704 --> 25:33.387
's father, was around when the FDA was modernized.

25:33.467 --> 25:40.471
I mean, his dad is like the biological patent law dude in the United States.

25:40.591 --> 25:44.373
Like he's one of the most, in terms of arbitration, this is the man.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.662
So his brother is connected directly to Peter Thiel's finance company.

25:49.702 --> 25:59.287
So why wouldn't Bret Weinstein be somehow privy to some information and use it to try to monetize a podcast?

26:01.888 --> 26:08.151
Bret Weinstein told me that he was the scientific advisor of Joe Rogan, more or less, him and his brother.

26:08.791 --> 26:12.153
So if he believes that, which I think he does,

26:13.206 --> 26:33.372
then it could just be that, you know, between Brett Weinstein's dad and a few other people that lie to them regularly about how wonderful and smart they are and why they should persist and start a podcast despite all of the currents of social whatever working against them, then five or six years later, this is where we get.

26:35.287 --> 26:43.094
And so it's quite frightening to think that actually it's far fewer that are really scripted and have accepted their acting, even though they know people are dying.

26:45.597 --> 26:54.305
It's much more malevolent to think that there are layers of people behind Brett Weinstein that make sure that he never sees me or understand what I really represent and mean.

26:55.717 --> 27:06.307
It's remarkable to think that they might even be using Sasha Latupova and Mike Yeadon and John Campbell and all of these people like that on each other.

27:09.881 --> 27:19.103
And that with careful nudging from a few people in a few different directions all the time with few people behind you, you know, it doesn't matter if it's just Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:19.143 --> 27:25.985
and Veer Sharav and Meryl Ness and Mary Holland and Del Bigtree that are ultimately the whisperers.

27:27.386 --> 27:36.108
If those people have whisperers that they can send over to whisper, at some point in time, most of the whispers that these people hear will be, wow, you're doing really good, keep it up.

27:39.562 --> 27:48.286
And after six years, they could be fairly lost and not know who Scott Gottlieb was and not know what BARDA was if that's how they got there.

27:51.187 --> 27:53.408
And suddenly my anger is gone.

27:53.468 --> 27:54.909
My frustration is gone.

27:54.989 --> 28:04.713
My, now it's a little more, it's a little more uneasiness and a little more anxiousness because I understand how this is much more like a lemming situation.

28:04.733 --> 28:06.654
It's much more like being in a stampede.

28:08.109 --> 28:16.593
an intellectual stampede that is being governed and controlled by actors and programming on social media.

28:18.294 --> 28:34.561
And I think, unfortunately, Heather Haying is as much of a victim as I would have been had I gone forward with the Wuhan coverup and the lab leak thing and tried to be Alex Washburn and help to elevate Charles Rixey to hero status.

28:37.406 --> 28:41.108
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection as medicine is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

28:41.188 --> 28:43.670
And I think there are several books that support this idea.

28:43.690 --> 28:48.593
I think the timeline supports the idea that intramuscular injection was never a good idea.

28:49.934 --> 28:56.077
Autism Spectrum Disorder is also a mythology that was more recently created.

28:57.518 --> 28:58.079
And it is a

29:00.771 --> 29:05.373
a two-sided simple version of autism on the left and the right that allows that to continue.

29:05.833 --> 29:11.115
Very similar to the pandemics and gain of function, two-sided myth of laboratory leak or natural viruses.

29:11.815 --> 29:21.039
These are two-sided mysteries, myths that trap people in the argument because the two sides of the coin accept the existence of the coin itself.

29:21.079 --> 29:25.321
The coin being autism spectrum disorder or pandemics or gain of function.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.562
And maybe the most

29:29.887 --> 29:35.188
malevolent of all these things is this insistence that vaccine describes something quite accurate.

29:35.248 --> 29:42.349
And now we're going to have this discussion about how they changed the definition of vaccine at the beginning of the pandemic, and that's why they got away with it.

29:42.389 --> 29:55.091
And of course, that's the inversion, the absolute inversion of saying that they took intellectual property that already had a name and it was already 20 years old, and they renamed it so they could pretend it was new.

29:57.232 --> 29:58.592
And yet that's what we're doing right now.

30:00.805 --> 30:08.627
Another way to get away from this would be to say something like, natural pandemics don't exist or pandemics cannot naturally occur.

30:09.127 --> 30:14.949
That would also be a way of trying to sort of say this without actually saying it usefully.

30:15.069 --> 30:22.991
So don't, don't misunderstand the accuracy with which these words are deployed here on this stream is unique on earth.

30:24.255 --> 30:44.240
Nowhere else on the internet will you find somebody who is trying to use the English language in a way which is impossible to distort and also forces a direction of thought.

30:46.249 --> 31:02.888
So, pandemics cannot naturally occur actually is a nicely worded group of words which forces a particular direction of thought which accepts the fact that pandemics are real but they can only be caused rather than naturally occur.

31:04.284 --> 31:17.075
And so as you learn how this language is used against you and watch me or follow along with me as I figure out how this language is used against us, you're going to be told that it's neurolinguistic programming.

31:17.095 --> 31:20.798
You're going to be told that it's all kinds of these magical things that you have to understand.

31:21.398 --> 31:22.760
When in reality, it's not.

31:23.040 --> 31:27.884
It's just the thousand plus year old art of persuasion.

31:29.335 --> 31:31.717
So there were other people on this 2018 project.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.298
There was a professor in North Carolina.

31:33.878 --> 31:43.585
When he saw that COVID had this special furin cleavage site to let it enter into cells, why wasn't he ringing up Fauci and saying, holy crap, they did it.

31:43.945 --> 31:44.565
They did it.

31:44.645 --> 31:47.127
They finally did what we asked for the money.

31:47.147 --> 31:49.169
We got denied the money because it was too dangerous.

31:49.509 --> 31:50.389
They did it anyway.

31:50.790 --> 31:53.972
Guys, I'm off the grid for August, but Rand Paul makes

31:55.251 --> 31:56.612
Rand Paul makes sense.

31:56.632 --> 32:13.628
So this is Dave Rubin, one of the original guys sitting at the table with Peterson, Rogan, Shapiro, Weinstein, and Weinstein for the Intellectual Dark Web, that group of podcasters that was going to control the alternate narrative for Peter Thiel.

32:14.449 --> 32:27.368
funded by Peter Thiel and sort of supporting a network of podcasters, supporting the relevance of and the sort of the the the king Joe Rogan.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.508
That's kind of how it got organized, right?

32:31.648 --> 32:36.972
And so they became guests on Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan has guests that go on their podcasts.

32:37.032 --> 32:45.558
And so it was a nice little network of controlled conversations that could be scripted, that could have advertisements in them.

32:45.578 --> 32:46.979
And of course, that's how they started.

32:47.719 --> 32:55.408
with testing the way that these ideas could be put in there and deployed in sort of kind of covert fashion.

32:55.489 --> 33:03.779
But once the pandemic started, they used that stuff for real ideas and real questions that forced people in certain directions away from the truth.

33:04.929 --> 33:13.715
And so here we are six years later with Dave Rubin pushing you to listen to Rand Paul and a guy from England.

33:14.836 --> 33:28.665
It's oftentimes an American with a guy from England talking about the mystery virus and the lab leak coverup, which is of course, again, a central part of the mythology here that they want us to pass to our children.

33:29.727 --> 33:36.151
On January this year with the new administration, I gave subpoenas to 14 agencies and these are now friendly people.

33:36.211 --> 33:41.814
I know most of the people at these agencies and yet six months in, it's taken me six months and I'm still trying to get information.

33:42.214 --> 33:45.556
I've recently gotten some and I think I'm going to have a breakthrough in the next couple of months.

33:46.616 --> 33:47.577
I do think that

33:48.257 --> 33:49.218
there was a cover up.

33:49.378 --> 33:56.764
And I love the way, or a conspiracy, I love, my favorite is, you know, people think, oh, if you believe in a conspiracy, you're an absolute nut and a fool.

33:57.284 --> 33:59.886
And I said, well, George Carlin described this the best.

34:00.306 --> 34:06.832
George Carlin said, it's not necessary to believe in a conspiracy, only to believe in a convergence of interest.

34:07.532 --> 34:16.196
So the way I imagine the COVID conspiracy is, you might have 250 people involved in the COVID conspiracy, all worked in government, and maybe they never met each other.

34:16.696 --> 34:21.399
But their convergence of interest is, holy s**t, we funded this.

34:21.919 --> 34:23.980
If word was out that I reviewed this.

34:24.040 --> 34:34.165
Now think about how absurd it is that he's suggesting that the main convergence of interest during the pandemic was a group of people that are responsible for it and trying to cover their tracks.

34:36.420 --> 34:44.182
That's opposed to what Mark and I are suggesting, which is a multi-generational operation, which really starts from the Manhattan Project.

34:44.262 --> 34:57.087
It starts from the idea that radiation can cause mutation, that mutation is the fundamental stepping stone of evolution, and that mutations occur in DNA are the stepping stones of evolution.

34:57.147 --> 35:01.228
So we might be able to use radiation to accelerate evolution.

35:02.988 --> 35:04.709
Radiation can cause cancer.

35:06.243 --> 35:11.107
And so these things were all tied together before we actually even discovered DNA.

35:11.127 --> 35:23.136
And when we discovered DNA, that instantaneously the entire world was forced to basically accept that, well, evolution is obviously proven because we've found DNA.

35:24.337 --> 35:25.818
And I think my

35:27.625 --> 35:35.657
The reason why I got put on earth or what I'm doing here, one of the reasons why I'm here is because I think I can see pretty clearly why that's nonsense.

35:35.697 --> 35:43.268
And I know that there are lots of other people who have seen why it was nonsense too, but have been unable to really paint a useful picture for high school kids.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.189
And I think I can do it.

35:45.851 --> 35:48.694
I've already taught my kids and they already see it.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.655
And it's not very hard to see.

35:51.236 --> 35:57.121
But these people are all trapped in that model where DNA and genes and heredity are a thing.

35:57.161 --> 35:59.183
And it's not to say that that doesn't occur.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.165
You can see it in the face of all of your children.

36:02.205 --> 36:03.447
You can see it in puppies.

36:03.487 --> 36:04.668
You can see it in chickens.

36:04.708 --> 36:05.949
You can see it in plants.

36:06.689 --> 36:08.551
It's not that heredity doesn't exist.

36:08.611 --> 36:10.953
It's that we understand it because we found DNA.

36:11.013 --> 36:11.774
That's the lie.

36:14.235 --> 36:18.898
that because DNA is in bacteria and in plants and in people that we understand everything.

36:18.938 --> 36:29.924
Maybe one of the best analogies that has hit me recently is this idea that, okay, well, we found gears inside of this watch and the gears are really important to how the watch works.

36:29.984 --> 36:33.426
In fact, if you take a few gears out of here, the watch doesn't work anymore.

36:35.199 --> 36:38.981
And then we looked in cars and we found out that cars actually have gears too.

36:39.001 --> 36:41.643
They're slightly different shape, but their teeth still mesh together.

36:41.683 --> 36:44.264
And if you remove those gears, the cars don't work anymore.

36:46.025 --> 36:46.606
Therefore...

36:48.209 --> 36:55.417
All mechanic things on earth use gears and now we understand how everything on earth that's mechanical works.

36:55.857 --> 37:11.313
We don't understand all the details yet, but essentially we understand everything from fine Swiss watches all the way to F1 race cars because we understand that gears are a common mechanism employed in these machines.

37:13.171 --> 37:23.282
And that's not that dissimilar to saying that we found DNA and it gets translated into RNA and then RNA is translated by ribosomes into proteins and we're mostly made of proteins.

37:23.342 --> 37:34.374
And since that's true in bacteria and also seems to be true in higher organisms, then we understand everything there is essentially to know about life and evolution is real.

37:36.550 --> 37:52.036
And these people are trapped inside of that illusion because that's all they know, that's all they understand, that's all they've been taught, and they haven't done the long, long requisite work necessary to pull one's own head out of that hole.

37:54.119 --> 38:12.486
And with your support and your help and you sharing this work, I believe I can start helping people pull their heads out of that hole by throwing a rope down and really explaining to people why that shortcut, evolution because DNA, is something that even somebody like Max Delbruck knew wasn't true.

38:15.268 --> 38:19.089
That Lederberg, Joshua Lederberg, died knowing that wasn't true.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.651
And the national security state let that

38:25.996 --> 38:36.542
truth disappear with Hilary Koprowski and with Joshua Lederberg and with all of these very, very insightful biologists from the last generation.

38:38.083 --> 38:52.451
And now we are left with people like Robert Malone and Paul Offit and Vincent Rackin-Yellow, people that were trained by those biologists who knew better, trained by those biologists who had seen all the shortcomings but trained not to see them.

38:55.407 --> 39:01.010
These are apprentices of illusionists that don't know that they were apprentices to illusionists.

39:01.050 --> 39:06.573
They thought they were apprentices to magicians, to biologists, to scientists.

39:09.034 --> 39:19.200
And so there's going to be a very, very big tumbling of the collective consciousness of humans as this whole illusion is shattered.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.741
But if it's shattered the right way,

39:22.105 --> 39:45.483
I think our kids and even some of the people that are alive now can be snapped out of it in a healthy and happy and freeing way rather than a debilitatingly, psychologically torturing way that these people would like to have happen that has to do with your surrendering and feeling helpless because the government and all these weaponized piles of money are trying to destroy you.

39:49.139 --> 39:54.804
I funded it, so it's like, I'm putting this at the bottom of the stack, or I'm erasing this, and that's what happened.

39:55.124 --> 40:06.374
So it was a conspiracy where some of them knew each other, and some of them were involved in a cabal, but most of them had a common interest of cover-up, because 15 million people died, and they made the foolish decision to fund this.

40:07.054 --> 40:09.495
And it's extraordinary what we have found.

40:10.076 --> 40:13.638
Almost everything is from whistleblowers and from freedom of information.

40:14.138 --> 40:19.401
There was a major Murphy who worked in DARPA, which is part of our defense industry research.

40:19.981 --> 40:21.202
He revealed that

40:21.624 --> 40:25.988
Of course, Major Murphy is the whistleblower for the Diffuse Proposal.

40:26.048 --> 40:39.621
The Diffuse Proposal that supposedly, according to the former Human Genome Project Research and Development Director Kevin McKernan, was actually released to the public by one Charles Rixey, the same guy who supposedly helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:39.661 --> 40:43.765
write his book, although didn't get his name in it, unlike I, myself.

40:44.670 --> 40:52.592
who's in it as a expert listed on the acknowledgements page that Kevin McKernan says is chemtrail retarded.

40:55.252 --> 40:57.193
America is under attack, ladies and gentlemen.

40:57.213 --> 40:59.013
I don't think Rand Paul understands it.

40:59.033 --> 41:00.873
I don't think, I mean, come on.

41:01.653 --> 41:03.954
Russell Brand definitely doesn't understand it.

41:03.994 --> 41:09.835
That guy reads all the talking points he's given and talks as much shit as possible.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.355
That's why he gets paid so much.

41:12.656 --> 41:13.716
I wouldn't, I shouldn't,

41:15.051 --> 41:19.215
I shouldn't have to explain Russell Brand any more than I would have to explain Alex Jones.

41:19.695 --> 41:24.560
But this guy is more difficult to understand and more difficult to explain.

41:26.782 --> 41:29.805
And it's very, very possible that he just doesn't understand.

41:31.767 --> 41:35.730
The research that led to this was applied for in 2018.

41:37.895 --> 41:39.456
by the people in Wuhan, China.

41:39.616 --> 41:44.098
They didn't get it in 2018, but it was almost exactly what COVID began.

41:44.559 --> 41:49.141
What it became was what they had applied for in 2018, but nobody came forward.

41:49.601 --> 41:51.983
So there were other people on this 2018 project.

41:52.023 --> 41:53.564
There was a professor in North Carolina.

41:54.144 --> 41:59.107
When he saw that COVID had this special furin cleavage site to let it enter into cells,

41:59.867 --> 42:03.830
Why wasn't he ringing up Fauci and saying, holy crap, they did it.

42:04.190 --> 42:04.811
They did it.

42:04.891 --> 42:07.373
They finally did what we asked for the money.

42:07.393 --> 42:09.435
We got denied the money because it was too dangerous.

42:09.755 --> 42:10.656
They did it anyway.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.579
This mirrors what our research proposal was going to do.

42:15.019 --> 42:17.281
And yet he met with Fauci in February of 2020.

42:18.162 --> 42:19.342
He's been at the White House.

42:20.103 --> 42:21.684
How come he never mentioned anything?

42:22.725 --> 42:26.367
15 different agencies heard this proposal and when they found out.

42:26.547 --> 42:28.109
So this kind of gets frightening, right?

42:28.149 --> 42:35.494
Because it sounds like he's trying to suggest that Ralph Baric should have spoken up and said, Hey, we submitted a proposal and now it looks like that's out there.

42:35.554 --> 42:40.857
Now that sounds like a national security theater that's about to be executed.

42:40.897 --> 42:43.159
And this bothers me a lot because I don't think

42:44.300 --> 42:48.161
Ralph Baric is guilty of anything other than a lot of acting.

42:48.201 --> 42:49.962
The virus had this special cleavage site.

42:49.982 --> 42:56.764
They should have been going, holy cow, last year I heard a presentation from the same people in China wanting to do this.

42:57.084 --> 43:05.826
And now the virus just coincidentally starts in Wuhan, China and has the special cleavage site in that they were proposing doing in an experiment in 2018.

43:06.847 --> 43:07.587
Nobody did that.

43:08.047 --> 43:19.597
Because there was a conspiracy of cover-up from people all had a convergence of interest that said, we don't want anybody to know that we were forewarned and we still made a stupid decision to fund this research.

43:19.837 --> 43:29.346
Now, what we're suggesting, of course, is that there is a conspiracy across Western nations, which is at the center of which is probably

43:31.551 --> 43:34.353
current manifestation of the Human Genome Project.

43:34.393 --> 43:36.854
The Human Genome Project is under the Department of Energy.

43:36.914 --> 43:39.935
The Human Genome Project is the highest level of national security.

43:40.435 --> 43:45.557
The Human Genome Project is a cooperative effort between many countries around the world, including China.

43:46.137 --> 43:58.923
BGI, the company that provided a lot of the PCR testing and lateral flow testing for the UK and the United States, is a company that was a close collaborator of the Human Genome Project since its inception.

44:00.000 --> 44:14.863
And so it is very, very much more likely that the conspiracy behind the COVID and the pandemic is the Human Genome Project and the necessity to convert humans on earth to experimental animals.

44:14.923 --> 44:27.266
The reason being because you can't learn anything about human genetics and human biology beyond a certain level because we don't share a lot of our biology with any other animals on earth.

44:28.891 --> 44:33.630
And this is part of understanding the real biology double zero one.

44:35.589 --> 45:04.773
that will free our children when they understand that and what that means from a fundamental level, then they won't be thinking of themselves as white or black or Hispanic or Latino, and they won't be thinking of themselves as some spectrum of gender, but they will have a real biological and spiritual conception of who they are, which starts with something that is irreducibly complex and sacred, rather than something that can be boiled down to a molecule and the expression that it causes.

45:05.857 --> 45:11.619
And this guy is one of the worst people on the planet.

45:12.740 --> 45:15.141
One of the worst actors on the planet.

45:15.181 --> 45:20.523
And what bothers me most about him is that he's lying a lot about Christianity.

45:20.583 --> 45:23.964
And it's not my place to judge.

45:26.905 --> 45:32.848
But there's no way this guy is... He's not a good example.

45:33.837 --> 45:39.715
I would not want my kid to take Russell Brand as an example of anything.

45:41.132 --> 45:43.334
and certainly not as an example of a Christian.

45:43.374 --> 45:45.356
I don't think he's a good example of a Christian.

45:45.396 --> 45:52.582
I think he's just as focused on himself as he ever was because I don't think he actually converted to Christianity.

45:52.642 --> 46:05.834
I think he's an actor and I think you need to accept the fact that there are some people on earth who are so cynical and so dark and so materialistic and believe in so many other things that

46:07.338 --> 46:19.776
They would be willing to say that all modern religions are a lie, they're useless, they're bullshit, and the real thing is Kabbalah, or the real thing is Satanism, or the real thing is Luciferianism.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.439
There are people like that.

46:21.499 --> 46:22.821
I don't know if he's one of them.

46:23.365 --> 46:51.430
But any of those people would be more than willing to go on TV in their underwear or social media in their underwear and pretend to be baptized and then talk about all about the Christ inside of himself and all this other stuff that has nothing to do with reading the Bible, nothing to do with the humility required to be a Christian, but just to do with distorting Christianity so that Christianity would be even more dismissible

46:52.406 --> 46:53.967
by those who have already left it.

46:56.029 --> 47:12.501
This is the part that actually becomes very scary about Polly Tommy and Judy Mickiewicz and all these other people who purport to be Christians and purport to be, you know, Sherry Tenpenny heard the voice of the Lord.

47:15.003 --> 47:20.787
And so it's very easy for the other side to turn around and say, look at these liars, these blasphemous

47:22.367 --> 47:25.930
egocentric actors are must be full of shit.

47:29.293 --> 47:31.895
We have been walked into a trap, ladies and gentlemen.

47:31.955 --> 47:36.580
It is impossible for you to underestimate how precarious a position we are in.

47:37.200 --> 47:46.028
We have been walked into a trap by people who are the most fraudulent of frauds, and we are about to be dropped on our heads.

47:50.351 --> 48:12.901
one scandal with robert f kennedy jr that reveals him very specifically to be a guy who was just reading whatever script was put in front of him including an ineffectual half-assed anti-vax script about the mmr vaccine handed to him originally by polly tommy and andrew wakefield as this gets out and people understand

48:13.666 --> 48:20.610
the breadth and the depth of the incompetence that we have fallen for, it will be us that suffers, not them.

48:22.651 --> 48:25.673
It will be the conservative right that suffers because of them.

48:25.733 --> 48:27.955
The Christian right that suffers because of them.

48:28.015 --> 48:38.761
The people that actually have been trying to live an honest and life with integrity will be the ones that get smashed because we put our lot in with them.

48:39.402 --> 48:41.543
We put our lot in with them.

48:43.444 --> 48:49.585
And so unless you're ready to really admit it, America is doomed.

48:51.226 --> 48:53.926
It's not going to get better with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:53.966 --> 48:55.666
and Donald Trump in the next couple of years.

48:55.726 --> 48:57.687
It's not going to get better after the midterms.

48:57.747 --> 48:58.707
It's going to get worse.

48:58.787 --> 49:00.247
The theater is going to get worse.

49:01.007 --> 49:07.129
The trap is closing right now on us because we still don't know it.

49:07.189 --> 49:08.089
We don't see it.

49:08.129 --> 49:09.049
We don't feel it.

49:13.516 --> 49:16.937
We need to elect other people in America and we need to elect them now.

49:17.157 --> 49:19.158
Every governor needs to be a nobody.

49:19.358 --> 49:25.761
Every congressman and senator and, and councilman needs to be a nobody.

49:25.801 --> 49:27.402
And I know that's an impossibility.

49:27.462 --> 49:29.422
I know that's not going to happen, but that's the way out.

49:31.503 --> 49:35.665
And if all of us were to show up in Congress and not know what the hell to do, well, that's the start.

49:38.717 --> 49:47.743
because if you elect 250 people and you put them in that room and somebody hits the gavel at the right time, then supposedly people can get shot because you made a decision in there.

49:48.223 --> 49:50.665
So that's how they are governing us right now.

49:50.705 --> 49:58.030
And in the meantime, we are spinning our wheels because supposedly podcasters on the internet are trying to figure it out.

49:58.930 --> 50:04.294
Supposedly, Russell Brand is trying to figure it out, prevent totalitarianism.

50:07.523 --> 50:10.585
And this is absolutely positively not true.

50:11.365 --> 50:13.286
I don't know how to be positive about that.

50:13.387 --> 50:14.207
It's not true.

50:14.827 --> 50:18.710
But the result is there's a lot of people who have been fooled.

50:19.590 --> 50:20.571
And so they're not evil.

50:21.672 --> 50:25.714
They could even be with their whole heart and mind trying to do the right thing.

50:27.108 --> 50:30.389
But if they think that this guy is trying to figure it out, they're screwed.

50:30.509 --> 50:33.769
If they think that Rand Paul is trying to figure it out, they're screwed.

50:34.189 --> 50:35.369
And that's where we are.

50:35.389 --> 50:37.550
That's why it's so frightening to me now.

50:37.590 --> 50:46.591
Yes, if you met Lee Harvey Oswald at a dry shooting range and he was practicing shooting from a shop window via branches and trees at a grassy knoll.

50:46.771 --> 50:47.812
It's just a coincidence.

50:47.912 --> 50:52.032
So, but, although ironically, he was likely not working alone.

50:58.015 --> 51:02.396
Hey everyone, as you know, I debunk charlatans and science deniers of all varieties.

51:02.696 --> 51:07.058
But there is a special sense of urgency when- I cannot stress enough, right?

51:07.158 --> 51:11.179
This guy is the best example I have of the other side.

51:12.399 --> 51:14.600
This is like the other side's Bret Weinstein.

51:14.680 --> 51:17.561
Not everybody watches him, he's only got a couple million followers.

51:18.481 --> 51:20.282
But what he does is that he teaches

51:21.496 --> 51:35.044
Chemistry and physics and biology pretty well, but he teaches the standard fare including vaccines work best ever invention ever Pandemics and gain-of-function are real yada yada yada But he does hate Brett Weinstein.

51:35.804 --> 51:43.308
He does think Sam Seder is really smart and kind of a kindred spirit He does think that Jordan Peterson is a fraud.

51:43.348 --> 51:47.971
He does think that Eric Weinstein is a fraud so he's the opposite side of the show and

51:49.335 --> 51:51.336
And he's very, very effective.

51:51.617 --> 51:57.320
So what you have to see is that the conservative right, many of whom think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:57.340 --> 52:16.833
has got good plans and means well, that Mary Holland has good plans and means well, that Brett Weinstein has good plans and means well, that Steve Bannon has good plans and means well, this is the other side of the coin in how far we've gone and how easy it is for them to dunk on us.

52:19.520 --> 52:26.362
And your family and friends might be watching a guy like this tell your family and friends exactly how bad it is.

52:26.382 --> 52:29.943
And such characters are in positions of political power.

52:30.383 --> 52:35.264
And thus, by overwhelming popular request, we arrive at RFK.

52:35.644 --> 52:45.007
If you are someone who is not aware of what a massive fraud this guy is, or just how harmful he is to America and the world, please watch this video.

52:45.367 --> 52:46.087
Let's get started.

52:46.917 --> 52:59.328
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of Robert F. Kennedy Sr., the attorney general and senator who was assassinated in 1968, and nephew of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States who was assassinated in 1963.

53:00.809 --> 53:12.699
Remember that Brett Weinstein's dad, Les Weinstein, worked with these two guys, was appointed by these two guys to the Department of Justice, and played a seminal, pivotal role in the modernization of the FDA in the 60s.

53:13.940 --> 53:19.163
along with a guy by the name of Senator Kefauver who was killed about three weeks before that dude was killed.

53:20.044 --> 53:27.348
And we don't talk about Senator Kefauver, we don't talk about Brett Weinstein's dad, and yet Brett Weinstein and the kid

53:28.817 --> 53:49.329
you know, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are now kind of at the center of this fake populist movement that's about to get smashed, face-planted on its face in America as part of the controlled demolition of the American culture, the American citizenry, the American people, the American fabric of society is being ripped apart

53:49.949 --> 54:02.626
because the conservative populist right has been fooled into believing that Russell Brand and Jordan Peterson and all these shitheads are actually trying to figure it out and they're not.

54:03.888 --> 54:05.991
They were purposefully running us off a cliff.

54:08.484 --> 54:11.227
And some of them don't even know that's the problem.

54:11.287 --> 54:27.525
That's what makes it harder for me now, because I can't really even be angry at any of them because I know, and I understand now that it was a military operation to run us off that cliff, to run the populist right in America off a cliff of credibility.

54:30.748 --> 54:31.969
That's where we are right now.

54:32.009 --> 54:40.755
If we don't hit the brakes, we are gonna drive off a cliff of credibility, just like those two women in that silly movie, Thelma and Louise.

54:43.537 --> 54:50.942
And it'll be Trump in the driver's seat and Bobby Kennedy in the passenger seat and a couple people in the back row.

54:53.404 --> 54:59.248
Kash Patel and, I mean, Tulsi Gabbard cannot be a real person.

55:03.280 --> 55:07.561
It's not by accident that she surfs and Jessica Rose surfs.

55:07.781 --> 55:15.602
It's not by accident that Whitney Webb and Claire Craig and all these people just kind of have a general resemblance to each other.

55:18.203 --> 55:30.445
And it's not by accident that these people are exactly on the same script that Brett Weinstein and all these other people are on, that it looks like a conspiracy that started in the Kennedy administration is now all the way here.

55:31.570 --> 55:41.157
instead of the idea that the Kennedy administration was a brief blip in resistance to what was already in existence before they took office.

55:42.118 --> 55:43.119
See the subtle difference?

55:44.079 --> 55:53.126
But Brett Weinstein is convinced that the conspiracy starts then, instead of this just being evidence of its existence before then.

55:54.267 --> 55:59.311
And Rand Paul and Russell Brand seem to think exactly the same thing.

56:02.190 --> 56:04.532
is an apple that has fallen quite far from the tree.

56:04.912 --> 56:23.167
In contrast with his uncle, who prioritized scientific advancement and integrated it into his policies, from funding scientific research and education all the way to the legendary Apollo missions and the space race, RFK holds a plethora of bafflingly regressive and objectively erroneous views on a variety of topics.

56:23.667 --> 56:32.512
He thinks vaccines cause autism, Wi-Fi fries your brain, measles outbreaks are no problem, and in fact, germs might not even be a thing in general.

56:32.852 --> 56:34.714
Now can you see how bad it is?

56:34.854 --> 56:39.816
Because you cannot sit down at your Thanksgiving table and defend this shit.

56:41.377 --> 56:46.340
In fact, if you're following along with the work that we're doing here, you shouldn't want to.

56:47.241 --> 56:51.043
Because autism itself can't be defended.

56:52.395 --> 57:01.220
what Polly Tommy and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker share in common is not an autistic kid.

57:01.420 --> 57:11.707
It is a toxically, neurologically damaged kid that also had, for at least some time, extreme dysregulation of their bowel.

57:14.448 --> 57:16.950
And instead of being very precise about that,

57:18.885 --> 57:21.546
they get more and more imprecise.

57:21.746 --> 57:31.590
Instead of being where Brian was in 2013, where he didn't use the word autism, didn't like the word autism because his son was vaccine damaged, neurologically injured.

57:32.290 --> 57:35.251
And now he uses autism to describe all kinds of things.

57:35.411 --> 57:37.812
Some of which might be caused by vaccines.

57:37.852 --> 57:38.752
That's the problem.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.014
If we go over here,

57:46.309 --> 57:49.110
And you see, sorry, I should have done this.

57:49.370 --> 58:05.494
If you go over here and you see the idea that here's Brian's kid, and here's Polly's kid, and here's Mary's kid, and here's my friend's kid named Elijah.

58:06.314 --> 58:13.176
And coincidentally, I do have a friend who has a real kid who is actually autistic and has a lot of these problems.

58:13.216 --> 58:14.496
The kid will eat carpet.

58:15.726 --> 58:23.548
Um, and then his, you know, cause he can't eat anything and whenever he eats stuff, he has pain and he can't talk, but he's a really sweet kid.

58:24.049 --> 58:29.050
And he made friends with my son and he has all this thing, you know, he shits his pants all the time.

58:29.070 --> 58:36.612
It's exactly what, what Brian's kid has and what Polly's kid supposedly had before she got secreted injections or some shit.

58:37.152 --> 58:42.374
And also what Mary's kid supposedly had before he was institutionalized or whatever, wherever he is now.

58:44.602 --> 58:47.785
But these kids are a very small number of kids.

58:47.845 --> 59:01.637
And then we have all these other people with autism and it's all kinds of things, including Rain Man autism and Asperger's and all these other kids.

59:03.038 --> 59:06.782
And these could be a wide variety of causes, right?

59:06.842 --> 59:07.803
That's the whole point.

59:07.883 --> 59:11.145
And so if autism is this big circle,

59:12.188 --> 59:19.992
Then you can write a book like James Lyons Wyler wrote, which is the environmental and genetic causes of autism in 2016.

59:20.692 --> 59:34.158
Because if you're, if the thing that requires you to define it as autism is this great big definition where, you know, kids can lose language or not make eye contact or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

59:34.518 --> 01:00:00.003
you know, very aspecific kinds of things, then you will be able to get, if there's people on YouTube who can self-diagnose as autistic as adults, then again, you know, we have this situation where we're casting an ever wider net, which means that the real kids in the middle who are actually the rare kids that are injured by intramuscular injection of a combination of substances,

01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:13.838
and that injury shows up very temporally related and severely related to the onset of the deployment of the injection of the vaccine, then we might have a problem here.

01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:16.822
But they're not trying to be specific like that.

01:00:18.979 --> 01:00:20.300
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:40.010
and Mary Holland are very, very, very, very careful not to be specific, but instead to cast a very wide net of health freedom, which includes the idea that some cases of autism, if you have a very broad definition of autism, are caused by vaccine injection.

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:53.057
And so it's very easy for somebody like Professor Dave to say that autism is being diagnosed more often now because we have different ways of diagnosing it.

01:00:53.137 --> 01:00:58.620
And that increase in autism has nothing to do with intramuscular injection.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.221
Although he doesn't say that, he says vaccines.

01:01:02.502 --> 01:01:03.942
Just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:03.982 --> 01:01:05.623
says he's not against vaccines.

01:01:06.984 --> 01:01:08.745
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:10.509 --> 01:01:15.392
Gigon Biological is arguing that it is intramuscular injection that is very specifically dumb.

01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:34.545
And so the vaccine word is so aspecific and so not capable of precision that within the big term vaccines, there are several different kinds of injections and pharmaceutical products, some of which are intramuscular injection.

01:01:34.585 --> 01:01:40.249
And for me, if I'm going to be specific, it is my belief that those are the injections.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.372
which are responsible for hurting people.

01:01:43.412 --> 01:01:46.034
And those are the injections which are irresponsible.

01:01:46.114 --> 01:01:48.837
Those are the injections that don't make any biological sense.

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:51.480
And we should start there.

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:56.265
And if we started there, I think we would be doing pretty well.

01:01:56.565 --> 01:02:07.988
Although it may be that in the end, we will find that many of the injections that we have done, the hypodermic injections we've done, irrespective of the place we've put them, have been a little bit ham-fisted.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:11.669
But I can tell you, the worst place to put it would be the muscle.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:20.551
Because from a causal perspective, you have the least chance of knowing what you did.

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:24.738
and that's why those kids are rare.

01:02:25.999 --> 01:02:26.639
Do you see it?

01:02:27.639 --> 01:02:30.040
Do you see why those kids are so rare?

01:02:31.401 --> 01:02:46.367
If it was an intramuscular injection and it was always IV, if it was an intramuscular injection and it was always oral, if it was an intramuscular injection and it was always subcutaneous, then these kids would be less rare.

01:02:47.868 --> 01:02:48.809
That's my projection.

01:02:51.604 --> 01:03:01.069
And so while Pauly Tommy and Brian Hooker and all these other people want you to believe that because autism is so prevalent, that vaccine injury is so prevalent.

01:03:02.149 --> 01:03:03.310
And that is the trap.

01:03:05.046 --> 01:03:12.588
I hate to break it to you as an anti-vaxxer, but I don't think severe vaccine injury is very common at all.

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.668
I think Paul Offit is exactly right.

01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:16.148
It's extremely rare.

01:03:16.489 --> 01:03:27.511
And as we've gone to single-use needles and sterilized-use hypodermics and all this other stuff, the injuries due to intramuscular injection have gone down even further.

01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:43.751
And I would argue that when we were using little kits like this and there was only two needles for the whole town, that intramuscular injection was much more dangerous than it is now that we have disposable needles and disposable hypodermics.

01:03:47.974 --> 01:03:50.256
And so this is not, it is not,

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:54.839
the anti-vax message of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:55.419
refined.

01:03:55.439 --> 01:03:59.563
It is not the anti-vax message of Suzanne Humphreys refined.

01:03:59.704 --> 01:04:01.866
It is a new message.

01:04:01.946 --> 01:04:13.157
It is a different message which takes into account a biological foundation of understanding and applies that to the ideas, the methodologies, and then reinterprets them.

01:04:16.056 --> 01:04:31.449
I still think that this work reveals that intramuscular injection is dumb and that they have done things like this illusion of the autism spectrum disorder very specifically to make sure that we never come to that realization.

01:04:31.949 --> 01:04:35.812
That for 90 years, we have been doing something that we kind of knew didn't work.

01:04:36.232 --> 01:04:37.594
We hoped that we could fix it.

01:04:37.634 --> 01:04:38.895
We hoped we could figure it out.

01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:45.340
But all we've really done is discover a list of things that we can inject that cause very little damage.

01:04:49.704 --> 01:04:58.186
Because we started with sperm oil and wool oil and other kinds of oils that were dissolving things.

01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:03.608
And we started with many, many, many CCs, you know?

01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:11.170
Like, can you imagine going into your doctor's office and your kid having this pulled out of a box?

01:05:21.943 --> 01:05:45.580
This would be business as usual if he were just some random jerk with a podcast, but in this nightmare of a universe, he's been appointed by President Trump to head the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, which oversees federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:06:07.232
Since being appointed as head of HHS on February 13th of this year, it's been a non-stop train wreck that in certain timelines could end as disastrous as Stalin's backing of Trofim Lysenko, a dark chapter that I described in a previous video, which illustrates how dictatorial power destroys science when it forces science to adhere to a predefined political agenda.

01:06:07.592 --> 01:06:18.595
Nearly every single day since RFK's service began has been a circus sideshow of breathtaking ignorance and monolithic damage being dealt to the American people, which will have generational effects.

01:06:19.015 --> 01:06:24.416
While there will surely be more buffoonery to address as his term unfolds, let's cover what's happened so far.

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:34.999
First, we can start with a brief overview of Bobby's background, career, and how the guy with the worm in his brain became the guy with the worm in his brain running America's health programs.

01:06:35.439 --> 01:06:38.422
More on the worm later if you aren't familiar with this little tidbit.

01:06:38.843 --> 01:06:46.350
After his father's assassination, Bobby dabbled in heroin and environmental activism before recovering from addiction and eventually becoming a lawyer.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:58.022
He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1985 and began taking on environmental cases on behalf of a non-profit organization called Hudson River Fishermen's Association, renamed to Riverkeeper in 1986.

01:06:59.403 --> 01:07:06.429
He won cases that forced cleanups of the Hudson River, punished polluters, and set precedent for environmental legal standards at the time.

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.731
It seemed like he was doing great work at first.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:18.779
But in the year 2000, during a board meeting for Riverkeeper, he took a detour onto Batshit Boulevard when he pushed for hiring someone who had just served three and a half years in federal prison,

01:07:19.179 --> 01:07:26.166
for running an international wildlife smuggling operation, including smuggling eggs of endangered cockatoo birds from Australia.

01:07:26.586 --> 01:07:36.216
Some recurring themes that we will see throughout this piece are Bobby's association with grifters, playing fast and loose with scientific data, and being called out by his own family members.

01:07:36.576 --> 01:07:38.978
His own sister Rory nailed it in an interview.

01:07:39.318 --> 01:07:49.085
He can say some crazy shit, even though he might come across as an expert, remarking how thoroughly all of his interviews have to be fact-checked because he just says pretty much anything.

01:07:49.586 --> 01:07:57.712
Before the Senate hearing on his nomination to head of HHS, his cousin Caroline Kennedy sent a letter to Congress urging them to reject his nomination.

01:07:58.132 --> 01:08:10.689
She wrote in her letter that Bobby is a predator who preys on the desperation of parents and sick children, using anti-vaccine rhetoric, and that both his father and uncle would be disgusted by his conduct.

01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:14.093
I'm sure she's just paid off by big pharma or something, right?

01:08:14.614 --> 01:08:22.660
Moving along, in 2015, he became the chair of Children's Health Defense, or CHD, a group that has been pumping out vaccine disinformation.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.540
So that's wrong.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.564
That was actually in 2018 when the World Mercury Project changed its name.

01:08:28.664 --> 01:08:29.725
So this is a mistake.

01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:32.587
I don't know why he's making this mistake, but it's a mistake.

01:08:32.647 --> 01:08:33.528
In 2015, CHD didn't exist.

01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:43.888
In 2016, ICANN is formed, and ICANN is formed before CHD is formed, and makes the movie Vaxxed in 2016, so this is wrong.

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:48.569
at Mach 5 speed for a long time.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:09:00.059
The organization's revenue, primarily consisting of individual donations, grew from $13,000 in 2014 to $470,000 in 2015 when Bobby joined the board, and ramped up unimaginably during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching $6.8 million in 2020, $15 million in 2021, and a peak of $23.5 million in 2022.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:22.478
Now it's really weird because I'm wondering if some of these numbers are wrong on purpose so that people on our side could say that Professor Dave gets it wrong.

01:09:22.518 --> 01:09:23.339
But this is right.

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.181
This is frighteningly correct.

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:33.577
And they don't tell you where all their money comes from, but it comes from a lot of rich people, you know, retired people giving a million dollars.

01:09:33.657 --> 01:09:34.558
It's gross.

01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:36.360
It's really gross.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.261
And you know how gross it is?

01:09:38.281 --> 01:09:47.670
I actually helped them with a few donors by escorting them around a conference and telling them how great everything was and escorting them to their table.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:51.173
And oh my gosh, was I a fool.

01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:55.339
Hot damn, who knew lying could be so profitable?

01:09:55.919 --> 01:10:04.849
In 2023, revenue dropped to $16 million, coinciding with Bobby's leaving for his presidential campaign, demonstrating how influential he is in positions of power.

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:10.615
While running for president, he spread his gospel to millions of people on platforms like the Joe Rogan Experience.

01:10:11.115 --> 01:10:33.315
Since Trump despises credentials and rewards loyalty in quid pro quo fashion, RFK endorsed Trump in 2024, to then find himself being handed the keys to the HHS earlier this year, where he currently chairs the Make America Healthy Again Commission, or MAHA, pushing policies based on complete whimsy or science fiction at best.

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:37.819
All of this should be no surprise because, once again, Bobby is a lawyer.

01:10:38.119 --> 01:10:43.143
He has no scientific training of any kind and couldn't pass a 9th grade biology quiz.

01:10:43.503 --> 01:10:51.270
The level to which he is deluding himself into thinking he's in the right versus just straight up grifting for cash is something for a psychologist to dissect.

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:53.852
Here we just set the record straight on the science.

01:10:54.173 --> 01:10:59.117
But it seems to be the case that Bobby is unaware of what an incompetent moron he is

01:10:59.537 --> 01:11:08.182
and how damaging it is to steer research funding for the entire country based on his own science illiteracy rather than assembling a panel of experts to advise him.

01:11:08.522 --> 01:11:13.144
But this is the defining theme of the current administration, so it's not even remotely surprising.

01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:28.312
In this video, we will dive into more of the specifics than most people want to hear, but in general, much of what we can expect out of his misinformation revolves around a misunderstanding of dosage, an over-reliance on anecdotes, and just making shit up out of thin air.

01:11:28.672 --> 01:11:47.247
He claims that he wants to remove all of the nasty toxins in our food, medicine, and vaccines, but apart from him definitely not knowing what the word toxin means, we will see that he bases his worldview not on the totality of evidence, but rather cherry-picked evidence or even complete falsehoods that already have had real-world consequences.

01:11:47.867 --> 01:11:58.710
This includes a recent resurgence of measles, a disease that was declared eliminated from the US in 2000 by the World Health Organization because of the success of the MMR vaccine.

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:11.814
Now, I'm suggesting to you a pretty big step here to believe that the measles outbreak and the Rolling Stone article and the MMR thing in the UK, it's all interrelated.

01:12:12.654 --> 01:12:16.975
And the reason why it's interrelated is because the MMR shot is subcutaneous.

01:12:22.099 --> 01:12:27.641
The measles vaccine is a subcutaneous vaccine, a cutaneous vaccine.

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:29.021
It's not intramuscular.

01:12:31.342 --> 01:12:38.605
And so they chose a vaccine that wasn't the DTP vaccine, which was the first one that had a book.

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:40.805
It wasn't the HPV vaccine.

01:12:40.825 --> 01:12:50.909
They chose the MMR vaccine because the MMR vaccine doesn't share the worst of the methodologies.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:55.395
And we're still in that trap right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:55.415 --> 01:12:56.215
We're still there.

01:12:56.336 --> 01:12:57.697
We're still in that trap.

01:12:57.737 --> 01:13:00.939
We're still chasing around those ghosts.

01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:17.231
Many of Bobby's claims are completely incompatible with high school-level science, while others that appear more robust at face value crumble under even mild scrutiny, since they are always built on debunked pseudoscience, fabricated statistics, or brainworm-induced absurdities.

01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:34.337
All of this combined with his actions, like fueling deadly outbreaks, hiring discredited disgraced former researchers, and pushing overreaching claims about drugs like ivermectin and methylene blue, make him not only unfit, but legitimately dangerous as head of HHS.

01:13:34.937 --> 01:13:39.979
Are you ready to dive into the weird wild world of Bobby's gold standard science?

01:13:43.476 --> 01:13:49.182
The first stop on our Bobby Kennedy pseudoscience tour is the so-called chronic disease epidemic.

01:13:49.582 --> 01:14:01.594
Bobby's got a wild theory that America's kids are sicker than ever, and it all started in 1989 because vaccines and junk food flipped some magical disease switch, like bright light and water for a mogwai.

01:14:02.074 --> 01:14:16.945
In reality, it's just a bunch of half-truth falafels wrapped in a fear-mongering pita pocket, since he conveniently neglects to mention our increased understanding of genetic contributions to disease, as well as the massive decrease in child mortality that has occurred over the past century.

01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:19.607
Remember when half of all kids died?

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:22.489
Me neither, since we don't live 150 years ago.

01:14:22.789 --> 01:14:24.330
Hopefully we can keep it that way.

01:14:24.651 --> 01:14:30.335
Let's get to Bobby's wild claims on the internet, starting with, who the hell else, Joe Rogan.

01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:32.036
You know, all of those things.

01:14:32.096 --> 01:14:36.998
Now, we went from 6 percent of Americans having chronic disease.

01:14:38.158 --> 01:14:46.121
By 1986, we're starting to have the vaccines and we got an 11.8 percent of kids now.

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:46.901
So it's doubled.

01:14:48.002 --> 01:14:50.643
By 2006, 54 percent.

01:14:51.143 --> 01:14:55.725
These are kids who are permanently disabled and they have to be on medication their whole lives.

01:14:56.411 --> 01:15:10.995
That's right, in 2023, Bobby claimed that chronic diseases, including obesity, autism, ADHD, diabetes, and allergies, exploded from 6% in the 1960s to a whopping 54% by 2006, implying that it is caused by an expanded vaccine schedule.

01:15:16.696 --> 01:15:28.239
He's doubled down on this claim in his HHS Senate confirmation hearing, stating that Americans' overall health is in grievous condition, and pinning 1989 as the start of this epidemic.

01:15:28.759 --> 01:15:38.421
His Maha report from this year echoes this, claiming that 40% of kids have chronic conditions, blaming ultra-processed foods and chemicals of one variety or another.

01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:39.901
Sounds scary, right?

01:15:40.182 --> 01:15:41.762
I mean, it seems like it must be true.

01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:49.664
The big bad corporations are poisoning us, we all know that intuitively, so why would we need to verify any of that or use critical thinking in any way?

01:15:50.144 --> 01:15:51.264
Because we're not sheep.

01:15:51.704 --> 01:15:58.826
First let's talk about what prevalence means in the first place, because Bobby is throwing around big numbers like 54% to scare you.

01:15:59.266 --> 01:16:06.528
Prevalence is just the percentage of people in a population who have a specific disease at a given time, like a snapshot of who's affected.

01:16:07.028 --> 01:16:14.154
For chronic diseases, it's higher today, partly because we're better at spotting them, thanks to genetic testing and fancy diagnostics.

01:16:14.935 --> 01:16:23.622
Genetic testing and fancy diagnostics, like PCR, like lateral flow, like antibodies, like all this stuff.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:26.644
So see, he kind of knows, but he doesn't know.

01:16:27.445 --> 01:16:29.427
But what does he say three times now?

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:31.368
Genetic stuff is handy.

01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:33.130
Genetics, genetics, genetics.

01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:35.792
So you can start to hear it, right?

01:16:36.052 --> 01:16:38.494
Actually, Professor Dave is also scripted.

01:16:40.155 --> 01:16:48.461
Professor Dave is scripted with exactly the bad biology 101 needed to hammer this Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:50.002
into the ground like a tent stake.

01:16:50.828 --> 01:16:55.832
and also because kids are living longer since they're not dying from smallpox or polio.

01:16:56.313 --> 01:17:01.677
Bobby pretends it's all vaccines and Froot Loops, but prevalence isn't a boogeyman, it's science.

01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:04.519
So is there a chronic disease crisis?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:14.748
CDC says about 40% of US kids aged zero to 17 have at least one chronic condition, like asthma, allergies, obesity, or behavioral disorders.

01:17:15.329 --> 01:17:16.930
Autism is at one in 31 kids.

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:20.373
Obesity hits 20% of kids.

01:17:20.953 --> 01:17:26.718
So Bobby's not making this up entirely, chronic diseases are a problem, and their prevalence is rising.

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:28.780
But here's where he goes off the rails.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:36.687
He blames vaccines, toxins, and ultra-processed foods for this sudden 1989 spike, with a mixed bag of legitimacy.

01:17:37.187 --> 01:17:44.734
Once again, Bobby is obsessed with the year 1989, claiming the vaccine schedule exploded and triggered an epidemic.

01:17:45.134 --> 01:17:50.919
The vaccine schedule did gradually expand in the 80s and 90s, from three vaccines to 16 by 2000.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.524
But in case you weren't aware, Bobby, correlation isn't causation.

01:17:55.864 --> 01:18:00.068
There's zero evidence linking vaccines to a chronic disease surge.

01:18:00.228 --> 01:18:07.114
And so his argument here, of course, is that correlation doesn't equal causation, and he's right.

01:18:08.015 --> 01:18:10.497
But there would be a very easy way to solve that problem.

01:18:10.537 --> 01:18:15.201
We could go look at the unvaccinated kids and see the prevalence of any of these diseases there.

01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:16.522
And in fact, that's been done.

01:18:17.963 --> 01:18:20.525
And that guy's not going to cite any of those papers.

01:18:21.926 --> 01:18:22.167
Right.

01:18:22.387 --> 01:18:25.229
And in reality, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:27.691
isn't very good at pointing that out either.

01:18:27.731 --> 01:18:30.073
And that's why this guy isn't having to say it.

01:18:32.182 --> 01:18:43.958
because the unvaccinated population and their health outcomes are irrelevant to this, are irrelevant to this discussion because we must accept pandemics and public health.

01:18:45.339 --> 01:18:46.219
take autism.

01:18:46.559 --> 01:18:58.182
Studies show that the rise is due to broader diagnostic criteria and better awareness, not thimerosal or aluminum as he's repeatedly parroted, and which has been debunked to death at this point.

01:18:58.502 --> 01:19:11.005
When thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative Bobby loves to hate, was yanked from most childhood vaccines by 2001 out of precaution due to public outcry, rates of autism diagnosis kept climbing.

01:19:11.565 --> 01:19:34.651
so clearly that wasn't it nor any other chemical substance but do you see why it's it's bad do you see why the corner we've been run into is bad and it's bad because of this it's bad because vaccine injury is actually quite rare it is actually very hard to detect because the vast majority of vaccine injury is probably really sub

01:19:36.349 --> 01:19:48.255
sub symptomatic or something that nobody would associate, especially because it's said onset three months later, or didn't onset in the same part of the body or has nothing to do with what they thought they were being vaccinated against.

01:19:48.915 --> 01:19:53.637
Ladies and gentlemen, the very rare examples of kids that are permanently or, or

01:19:57.006 --> 01:20:04.373
long-term damage in their GI tract and in their social interactions in their mental state and in their pain.

01:20:05.194 --> 01:20:12.081
These kids are rare and these are not the kids that they're fighting for at all otherwise they would say that.

01:20:15.356 --> 01:20:26.123
but instead they go along with this national security narrative which allows people like Dave to dunk on them and make them look like fools because it's definitely true.

01:20:26.544 --> 01:20:34.289
They're not being specific enough if they say vaccine causes autism, but then don't say that what we really mean are kids like these.

01:20:38.111 --> 01:20:38.872
That's the problem.

01:20:39.761 --> 01:20:48.267
It's just one of the many problems that you will find if you really start to be able to see what this National Security State Theater is and how it is composed.

01:20:49.327 --> 01:21:02.276
It is composed of cul-de-sacs, intellectual cul-de-sacs that you can't escape because the people that are in there are driving around so fast that you have no chance of getting to the exit.

01:21:02.296 --> 01:21:08.460
You're stuck in the middle and all these other people are spinning around you so fast you can't merge out.

01:21:10.452 --> 01:21:18.146
You're stuck in a traffic circle with these jackasses and it's Brian Hooker and Pauly Tommy and Mary Holland specifically causing it.

01:21:19.749 --> 01:21:23.575
And of course, their scripted hero, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:30.273
And so now we can script people to dunk on them and we are getting dunked on as we speak.

01:21:30.713 --> 01:21:34.055
It's just that social media is protecting you from seeing it.

01:21:34.075 --> 01:21:42.260
It's simply a broad trend in finally putting attention towards properly diagnosing and treating autism, which is a neurological condition.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:53.047
The whole vaccines cause autism thing stems exclusively from a singular fraud named Andrew Wakefield and one fraudulent retracted study he was bribed into producing from personal injury lawyers.

01:21:53.448 --> 01:21:55.649
That is explained in extreme detail.

01:21:56.009 --> 01:21:57.651
And what if he's not wrong about that?

01:21:57.691 --> 01:21:58.851
Do you see the problem here?

01:22:00.052 --> 01:22:09.479
What if he's not wrong about Andrew Wakefield being a fraud like like the the mother of Colin would tell you he is Paula Aitken?

01:22:11.557 --> 01:22:19.244
one of the original parents in that that study that I've interviewed on my stream and she's very convinced that these people are frauds.

01:22:19.304 --> 01:22:20.485
What if it is a fraud?

01:22:22.527 --> 01:22:29.814
If Andrew Wakefield is a fraud, Pauly Tommy's a fraud, that means all of their their Cal Jam shit was a fraud.

01:22:29.954 --> 01:22:35.158
All of them standing in front of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark was a fraud.

01:22:35.936 --> 01:22:40.840
And that's why they're still here and Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn are not, because they are frauds.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.262
That's why they get to go on Joe Rogan.

01:22:44.322 --> 01:22:53.469
That's why they have ranches in Austin and estates in the UK, because they are national security state actors.

01:22:54.369 --> 01:23:03.596
And it is because of these very malevolent soulless people that we have a lot of innocent people that think they're fighting for good when they're not.

01:23:05.836 --> 01:23:14.179
And I beg your forgiveness for being mad at you or angry at you or calling you a traitor if indeed you are one of those people who was fooled by this show.

01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:19.420
Like I was fooled by this show when I started to work for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.561
in children's health defense.

01:23:20.601 --> 01:23:27.843
But it is a group of liars on a script of the most malevolent kind.

01:23:30.882 --> 01:23:34.525
And so we've got to do this weird juggling act, almost like Michael Motion.

01:23:34.565 --> 01:23:38.388
I've got to have like six balls in my hand going like this in between them.

01:23:38.428 --> 01:23:40.870
And 50% of them have to be forgiveness.

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:43.632
And the other 50% have to be like righteous anger.

01:23:44.212 --> 01:23:48.816
And I have to juggle this very, very, very, very well in order to not lose my mind.

01:23:50.796 --> 01:23:57.538
Because within this theater, there are malevolent actors who have known all along it's a lie.

01:23:57.898 --> 01:24:11.922
And then there are a bunch of people that got pulled on stage because they raised their hand, because they wanted to do what was right, and they got sucked into the theater, not knowing that getting pulled on stage was the point when they lost control.

01:24:16.656 --> 01:24:20.257
in this video here, so please watch that if you need more information.

01:24:20.698 --> 01:24:25.759
In short, vaccines unequivocally do not cause autism, period.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.981
Then there's ultra-processed foods, or UPFs.

01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:37.924
The Maha report claims that 70% of kids' calories come from nutrient-poor, additive-packed snacks, fueling obesity and diabetes.

01:24:38.544 --> 01:24:40.285
In fact, studies do back this up.

01:24:40.646 --> 01:24:46.611
Ultra-processed diets lead to excess caloric intake and health issues like obesity and type 2 diabetes.

01:24:47.211 --> 01:24:53.116
Additives like Red 40 might mess with behavior in some kids, but the evidence is spotty and more research is needed.

01:24:53.636 --> 01:24:55.397
So, yeah, junk food is bad.

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:56.557
That's not news.

01:24:56.837 --> 01:24:57.997
It's also not relevant.

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:04.620
There's no legal basis for banning less nutritious foods, and he can't physically force kids to eat broccoli or play soccer.

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:05.440
Do you see this?

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.900
Do you see where we are?

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.601
Do you see how frightening this is?

01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:15.483
We are being made fools of by the other side, and we can't see it because social media is so incredibly effective.

01:25:17.537 --> 01:25:19.958
That's my message for the day.

01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:21.878
I really think that's true.

01:25:22.038 --> 01:25:26.720
And I think we've got to be very, very careful about where we are and where we find ourselves.

01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:30.401
We need to stay focused on the biology.

01:25:30.441 --> 01:25:31.802
We need to start learning it together.

01:25:31.882 --> 01:25:34.983
We need to not take the bait on social media and we need to love our neighbors.

01:25:35.023 --> 01:25:36.243
Thank you very much for being here.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.064
Thank you very much for sharing the stream.

01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:41.565
And I'll see you in a few minutes, I think.

01:25:48.479 --> 01:25:49.680
I don't care how you get there.

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.363
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:25:52.383 --> 01:25:55.005
The goal is to win.

01:26:07.406 --> 01:26:10.867
Yeah, it's an interesting time right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:10.907 --> 01:26:11.487
Welcome to the show.

01:26:11.527 --> 01:26:15.868
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:22.209
Few things are more dishonorable than misleading the young, and if there's anything these people are guilty of, it is misleading the young.

01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:25.010
And they need to pull their heads out and apologize.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:29.971
And we need to start working harder to identify the people that are actually on the script.

01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:32.212
So we can steer our kids away from it.

01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:37.416
This is social media We've got our kid teach our kids to surf on it safely.

01:26:37.536 --> 01:26:40.318
Otherwise, you know, this is not gonna work.

01:26:40.358 --> 01:26:52.587
We almost need to Teach our kids to build a new social media and get them off of the corporate social media that they're on right now I think that's the best way forward this illusion and the people behind it will be broken.

01:26:52.747 --> 01:26:55.168
I assure you It will be broken

01:26:57.631 --> 01:27:03.616
They are on a script, they don't all have to understand it, but the ones that do understand it are very malevolent actors.

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:11.924
And so I'm not willing to just throw forgiveness all around, but I am willing to accept that a lot of these people are just not sophisticated enough to understand.

01:27:12.564 --> 01:27:17.389
I do think that Jay Bhattacharya is a traitor to American grandkids and likely a foreign actor.

01:27:17.789 --> 01:27:22.053
I do think that Marty McCarry is likely a traitor to American grandkids and a foreign actor.

01:27:22.473 --> 01:27:26.715
And I do think that they are part of the group of people that has played Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:40.640
over the last 5, 10, 15, 20 years culminating in this nonsense where they curated a narrative to make sure that any damage from transfection could be blamed on the novel virus or its spike protein.

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.921
And that's how we have this ghost of health freedom.

01:27:43.961 --> 01:27:45.062
That's why they were here.

01:27:45.662 --> 01:27:47.022
They are sticking to the script.

01:27:47.503 --> 01:27:50.444
And we have successfully solved the Scooby-Doo mystery.

01:27:51.445 --> 01:27:54.788
The Scooby-Doo mystery was the cover-up of the Lab League.

01:27:54.888 --> 01:27:56.129
The diffuse proposal.

01:27:56.249 --> 01:27:58.190
All these people trying to get out the truth.

01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:03.314
And it turns out that Tony Fauci and that guy that was on 60 Minutes was guilty after all.

01:28:04.215 --> 01:28:05.256
That's not of course true.

01:28:05.296 --> 01:28:10.160
The real ghosts of health freedom are named Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.103
And we would be very, very blessed if these ghosts would visit us this Christmas.

01:28:16.064 --> 01:28:19.286
Ladies and gentlemen, why would there be a fake health freedom movement in America?

01:28:19.326 --> 01:28:23.730
It's because intramuscular injection as medicine is a dumb idea that originates in the 1800s.

01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:31.856
It is because autism spectrum disorder is a myth, that pandemics are a myth, and that gain of function is a myth.

01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:32.897
That's how we got here.

01:28:32.937 --> 01:28:34.078
That's why we are here.

01:28:34.818 --> 01:28:37.499
And sticking to the script is all that's required.

01:28:37.839 --> 01:28:39.939
And they don't even need to know the details.

01:28:39.979 --> 01:28:41.020
That's the frightening part.

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.800
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.121
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.341
And I think that this is really the trick.

01:28:48.361 --> 01:28:49.982
You got to get off of social media.

01:28:50.022 --> 01:28:56.603
These organizations that were on the previous slide, these organizations are all part of the fifth generation warfare.

01:28:57.624 --> 01:29:00.024
These podcasters are most likely naive.

01:29:00.044 --> 01:29:00.885
They're given a script.

01:29:00.925 --> 01:29:02.105
They know that they're important.

01:29:02.887 --> 01:29:06.211
but they don't realize that they're working for the people they think they're fighting against.

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:07.152
I don't think they do.

01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:08.934
I think that's what's so sad about it.

01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:16.882
That's what gets me very sad about it, is that there's nothing, those people can be woken up, but probably will not be woken up.

01:29:20.268 --> 01:29:23.490
It's much more frightening if you think that most of these people don't get it.

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:33.938
It becomes much more frightening if you realize that this is a lemmings kind of situation rather than a really malevolent kind of thing.

01:29:34.418 --> 01:29:37.139
There are malevolent actors that have gotten us to run.

01:29:37.619 --> 01:29:40.139
And there are malevolent actors that keep us running.

01:29:40.659 --> 01:29:50.041
But in general, most of the people around us and most of the people that we are allowed to pay attention to on social media don't know why they are running in the direction they are running.

01:29:52.022 --> 01:29:57.143
And if we could get them to understand these simple truths and really explore them in their head,

01:29:58.723 --> 01:29:59.544
We would escape.

01:29:59.624 --> 01:30:01.185
Our kids will definitely escape.

01:30:01.245 --> 01:30:05.027
If we teach this simple biology to our kids, they will escape for sure.

01:30:06.488 --> 01:30:22.519
Make no mistake about it, Jonathan Cooey is one of the few people who has gotten this far, who can tell you that everyone from Suzanne Humphreys to Polly Tommy to Brian Hooker are all people that have accepted the national security script.

01:30:22.559 --> 01:30:23.800
It doesn't make them all bad.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:30.323
It doesn't make them all terrible, but it does make them all actors, and it does make them all participants in this.

01:30:30.483 --> 01:30:34.125
And so, in one way or another, you're going to have to judge them based on that decision.

01:30:34.945 --> 01:30:35.946
Because I was offered it.

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:42.869
I was offered it in the form of the book, and an expert, and as a staff scientist position, and I refused to take it.

01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:48.232
I effectively got myself fired by refusing to take the advice of shutting up.

01:30:49.395 --> 01:30:51.056
stop, talk about Robert Malone.

01:30:51.136 --> 01:31:01.782
Lots of people asked me to do it, including Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Jay Bhattacharya, all in the months warming up to my firing.

01:31:02.422 --> 01:31:03.843
So I understood what I was doing.

01:31:04.043 --> 01:31:06.884
I understood what I was doing because I also understood what they did.

01:31:07.685 --> 01:31:15.829
They were put in place to script a narrative which would effectively hide the fact that we knew a bunch of new people, old people were going to die.

01:31:15.889 --> 01:31:17.610
We knew it was coming since

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:33.733
We knew this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was coming since the 90s, because people came home after World War II and had more babies than they've ever had before.

01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:50.179
That Brady Bunch era of prosperity was going to result in an extraordinary increase in the number of old people that would go from being very productive, highly paid taxpayers, landowners,

01:31:51.246 --> 01:31:54.610
to being Medicaid recipients.

01:31:55.591 --> 01:31:58.294
And that's a pretty big economic inversion.

01:31:58.354 --> 01:32:10.127
That's a pretty big economic inversion that in places where there's a national health service, like in the UK or Canada, or in the Netherlands, that could have been a pretty serious economic disaster.

01:32:11.581 --> 01:32:25.937
And so they needed a narrative excuse to manage them in the hospital, anybody that approached the need for end-of-life care, which before the pandemic for Medicaid, the last six months of end-of-life care for Medicaid was about a half a million dollars.

01:32:26.997 --> 01:32:43.350
So everybody that they could put on supplementary oxygen or terrible ventilator settings and allow to die from bacterial pneumonia because viral pneumonia shouldn't be treated with antibiotics would be saving a half a million dollars each.

01:32:47.153 --> 01:32:51.076
This is the primary driver of the pandemic narrative.

01:32:51.096 --> 01:32:52.718
It is the primary opportunity.

01:32:53.823 --> 01:33:07.218
It is a significant biological signal which could be anticipated and timed with and even sculpted using manslaughter in order to create the illusion of something that didn't exist.

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:12.784
And of course, at the center of that illusion would be PCR testing.

01:33:13.914 --> 01:33:16.196
and would be manslaughter in hospitals.

01:33:16.236 --> 01:33:24.442
And so if you went into a hospital and thought you had COVID, the chances of you being murdered were very high in this time period.

01:33:25.243 --> 01:33:26.584
And the numbers reveal it.

01:33:28.005 --> 01:33:35.731
And it wouldn't necessarily just have to be because of a DNR order or because you decided to take supplementary oxygen or because you got pneumonia.

01:33:36.351 --> 01:33:37.072
It could also be

01:33:43.962 --> 01:34:06.612
It could also be, of course, because it was an opioid death that was flipped around, because death certificate fraud was committed, because they used dexamethasone to get you out of the hospital and send you back to an old folks home, or they gave you remdesivir, or maybe they gave you midazolam, or they just didn't treat a urinary tract infection like they did to my father-in-law.

01:34:08.871 --> 01:34:20.696
And so the list that should have been assembled by anybody that was purporting to be a dissident, but anybody that was trying to fight for justice for Americans would have assembled a list like this.

01:34:20.776 --> 01:34:30.781
But unfortunately, Mark Kulak and myself are the only two people that I know of who have attempted to assemble a list of ways that people died that weren't the mystery virus.

01:34:33.257 --> 01:34:49.548
because anybody that's tried to assemble this list has quickly come to the conclusion that there's no need for a mystery virus if we're gonna tell everybody the antibiotics are inappropriate, if we're gonna tell everybody that dexamethasone is a great hammer for the immune system, use it, apply it, send them home.

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:59.375
It would be impossible for us to anticipate the idea that we would let opioids run wild and that would kill a lot of young people under the age of 40

01:35:00.476 --> 01:35:10.019
and that with a careful orchestration of that narrative, that math could be essentially applied to or put in the column of COVID.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:27.586
And so then, with carefully scripted actors like Pierre Kory or Jessica Rose saying that the decrease in life expectancy in America is really stunning, but it doesn't have anything to do with the opioid pandemic, would be sufficient to cover it.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:51.449
sophisticated lies and they're not some of the lies aren't even sophisticated you just have to say something like jessica rose did that i by my calculations as far as i can see it's not the opioid pandemic same with denny rancor saying that there was no anticipated rise in all-cause mortality i don't know what a population pyramid is stop lying

01:35:56.385 --> 01:36:01.369
And so we have this list of things that no one will talk about and this list will never be touched.

01:36:01.429 --> 01:36:05.952
There are people who have inspired a lot of thoughts from you.

01:36:06.072 --> 01:36:08.474
People like JJ Cooley.

01:36:09.235 --> 01:36:10.736
This list will never be touched.

01:36:10.836 --> 01:36:12.197
No one will ever talk about it.

01:36:12.277 --> 01:36:15.639
No one will ever debunk it or work through it.

01:36:15.719 --> 01:36:22.024
Nobody like Nick Hudson or John Campbell or anybody will ever get to this list.

01:36:22.084 --> 01:36:25.647
And in fact, I will tell you tomorrow in my show

01:36:26.983 --> 01:36:34.028
a list that I can assemble which would allow you to seem like you're talking about any of these things when you're not.

01:36:35.509 --> 01:36:38.711
And I expect that to be the end point of the dissident narrative.

01:36:39.707 --> 01:36:47.612
where you say things as dumb as saying that pandemics, natural pandemics don't occur, or pandemics don't occur naturally.

01:36:48.032 --> 01:36:53.076
That would be the opposite of the precision of RNA cannot pandemic.

01:36:53.096 --> 01:36:56.458
It would be the opposite of the precision intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:36:56.878 --> 01:37:07.305
Just like it is the equivalent of saying that I'm not against, I'm not anti-vax, I'm not against vaccines, I want safe vaccines, is just as stupid and uninformed and

01:37:08.729 --> 01:37:17.072
militarily, diabolically trapping your brain as saying something like pandemics can't occur naturally.

01:37:20.233 --> 01:37:34.537
And I guarantee you that's where the no virus, natural something, you know, dissident movement is going to go where pandemics don't occur naturally, which is not the same thing as saying RNA cannot pandemic.

01:37:34.597 --> 01:37:36.398
It's saying that some of the bad guys can do it.

01:37:38.615 --> 01:37:54.481
And so I'm going to make a concerted effort in the next few days to really lay out all the ways that you can pretend to be talking about this biology and not talking about it, so that once and for all we can end this debate about who has an explanation and who has a script.

01:37:55.101 --> 01:37:58.543
Because I really believe, unfortunately, that this is true.

01:37:58.563 --> 01:38:04.185
There's only one person on earth right now, unfortunately, and his name is Jonathan Cooey, that has a list.

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:12.073
has a list of the ways people were murdered and a list of the lies and deceptions that were used in order to hide that murder.

01:38:13.534 --> 01:38:14.674
No one else has a list.

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:23.138
No one else has a succinct list of biological incongruencies and can defend them.

01:38:24.138 --> 01:38:33.102
And no one else has had the coordinated attention of so many of these people and then subsequently had them ignored other than me.

01:38:34.517 --> 01:38:41.419
You can't name one person that's been on a podcast with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Malone, and Nass, and Laurie, and Rose.

01:38:41.459 --> 01:38:47.381
You can't mention one other person that's got all the no-virus people get together to talk shit about them.

01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:53.463
You can't mention one other person that's had Kevin McKernan, Stephanie Seneff, John Bodwin, and

01:38:54.103 --> 01:38:58.144
and Jessica Rose stream with them to learn what they have to say.

01:38:58.664 --> 01:39:07.186
No one else has been invited to speak five or six or seven times to medical doctors for COVID ethics, just Jonathan Cooey.

01:39:07.586 --> 01:39:11.767
No one else has been invited to speak to Panda three times other than Jonathan Cooey.

01:39:12.187 --> 01:39:19.049
No one else in this dissident movement is listed as an expert in the Wuhan coverup book except for Jonathan Cooey and Brett Weinstein.

01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:23.912
who I say is a fraud.

01:39:28.914 --> 01:39:38.819
We are at the end, ladies and gentlemen, and it's been very, very hard work to get here where we realize that it's just murder and lies and it's not very complicated at all.

01:39:39.439 --> 01:39:40.980
It's not a bunch of algorithms.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.100
It's not AI.

01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:43.921
It's not a bots.

01:39:44.241 --> 01:39:45.582
It's, it's really actors.

01:39:46.783 --> 01:39:51.027
It's been a long, strange trip, but most of the people in this picture are actors.

01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:58.495
They are scripted actors who, after meeting me and telling me how great I was, went on to follow the script and act.

01:40:00.017 --> 01:40:04.001
Everybody from these two shitheads all the way to Jay Bhattacharya, Jayanta,

01:40:07.622 --> 01:40:11.685
This Indian guy, that guy, they're all in on it.

01:40:11.925 --> 01:40:13.387
And they've all come to visit me.

01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:19.391
That's also another thing you can't say about any of these other people that claim to be fighting.

01:40:22.434 --> 01:40:24.115
They are all scripted actors.

01:40:24.175 --> 01:40:25.697
They are all on the same team.

01:40:25.817 --> 01:40:33.163
From George Webb, to Robert Malone, to Sasha Latupova, to her daughter Soph, to Alex Jones, all the way to David Icke.

01:40:35.424 --> 01:40:37.346
It's all one malevolent show.

01:40:40.578 --> 01:40:43.759
And the actors are chosen from people who stand up.

01:40:44.559 --> 01:40:46.460
If you don't stand up, you'll never be chosen.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.201
If you stand up and say the wrong things, you'll just be ignored.

01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:52.842
So it's like an ash experiment on steroids.

01:40:55.963 --> 01:40:59.164
And only the people that stand up and have an answer need to be meddled with.

01:40:59.224 --> 01:41:03.626
And only the people that have the right answer that's on the script get promoted.

01:41:04.724 --> 01:41:06.344
And it's very easy to do it that way.

01:41:06.444 --> 01:41:11.546
Once you see that that's the way it's done, it's very, very easy to stay to the provided script.

01:41:11.566 --> 01:41:23.389
And if you find somebody like me who was willing to sacrifice their faculty position in order to speak out about a lab leak, then you can promote them until they start saying that they think a lab leak isn't what happened.

01:41:23.409 --> 01:41:32.391
And then you just stop promoting and you approach somebody else like Charles Rixey or Alex Washburn or, or any other person that, that agrees with the lab leak that was already started.

01:41:34.735 --> 01:41:45.117
And as long as you keep Rand Paul and Russell Brand having 100,000 more followers than anybody else, then all this other stuff is just noise.

01:41:46.678 --> 01:41:49.478
And the provided script is maintained.

01:41:51.679 --> 01:42:00.461
And so we have Brett Weinstein telling us that a false AI theater is the danger, that AI production is the danger, when in reality, it's scripted liars that is the danger.

01:42:01.901 --> 01:42:04.262
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:07.582
It is the scripted lie that it's the danger.

01:42:07.662 --> 01:42:09.103
Are we going to be talking about excrement today?

01:42:09.763 --> 01:42:14.907
We are going to be talking about certain friends of ours who are rolling the excrement offstage.

01:42:15.728 --> 01:42:18.890
And so I really think it's possible that these two don't, they don't get it.

01:42:19.811 --> 01:42:28.597
And that the same weaponized social media that prevents me from reaching more people prevents them from realizing how they're being used.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:37.484
how they're being scripted to trap, and maybe they're even glad to trap the people that they're trapping, but this dude is used.

01:42:38.205 --> 01:42:56.254
And it's not by accident that this same video is being promoted by so many people, including Mary Holland on Jimmy Dore and other things about how we've dealt a blow to the deep state by banning mRNA products for future respiratory diseases.

01:42:56.314 --> 01:42:56.974
It's really scary.

01:42:59.349 --> 01:43:01.071
So let's do a timeline again.

01:43:01.131 --> 01:43:15.465
Remember, my argument is the health freedom movement in America needed to get rid of Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn in 2020 and they murdered them and effectively replaced them with Judy and Paul and Brian and Mary and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:15.945 --> 01:43:17.607
And that was the plan for quite some time.

01:43:20.874 --> 01:43:25.036
And so not only that, but I think a lot of these people are liars and I've named them by name.

01:43:25.096 --> 01:43:30.319
I think these people are definitely scripted and have accepted the role as being scripted liars.

01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:34.321
I think Mary Holland is definitely an actor.

01:43:34.461 --> 01:43:37.102
I think that Robert Malone is definitely an actor.

01:43:38.863 --> 01:43:42.604
I think that Jay Bhattacharya is definitely an actor.

01:43:42.684 --> 01:43:46.886
I think Brian Hooker has accepted the role even though at one point in time I think he was a good guy.

01:43:47.346 --> 01:43:52.247
I think Kevin McKernan has definitely accepted the role and Nick Hudson has definitely accepted the role.

01:43:52.787 --> 01:43:56.228
Jessica Rose has accepted the role even if she doesn't like it anymore.

01:43:56.788 --> 01:44:00.510
And even Mike Eden has accepted the role and accepted it from the very beginning.

01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:01.530
That's why he talked about

01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:05.734
a novel virus, but overlapping natural immunity.

01:44:06.194 --> 01:44:08.696
So he never really questioned the virus from the very beginning.

01:44:08.716 --> 01:44:11.579
And so these are all the same kinds of scripts.

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:14.082
Let's just watch one example.

01:44:14.142 --> 01:44:16.764
This is Mary Holland, and we're just gonna do 2019, 2021, 2025, and see if it makes any sense.

01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.970
Thank you very much.

01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:26.390
My name is Mary Holland.

01:44:26.511 --> 01:44:28.292
I teach at NYU School of Law.

01:44:28.672 --> 01:44:36.637
For the last 18 years since my son suffered a severe neurological injury after an MMR vaccine, I have studied vaccine law and policy.

01:44:37.018 --> 01:44:42.921
I want to specifically address questions of community immunity or herd immunity, which are the basis for compulsion.

01:44:43.482 --> 01:44:51.067
As many have pointed out, we need to have a 94 or 95 percent uptake in order to reach a level of what's considered herd immunity.

01:44:51.487 --> 01:44:54.189
And yet we know that vaccines are not perfect products.

01:44:54.349 --> 01:44:58.351
So are we mandating vaccines because herd immunity?

01:44:58.371 --> 01:45:02.673
Or are we mandating vaccines because they don't hurt anybody and they help everyone?

01:45:04.194 --> 01:45:06.255
So she's already failing miserably.

01:45:06.335 --> 01:45:09.177
Instead, she's throwing out a new mythology.

01:45:09.217 --> 01:45:12.278
The mythology of herd immunity is worth talking about.

01:45:12.338 --> 01:45:14.119
That's the statement she's making here.

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.262
Instead of saying that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea is worth talking about.

01:45:19.322 --> 01:45:20.783
Instead of saying that

01:45:21.383 --> 01:45:23.784
RNA camp pandemic or something else like that.

01:45:23.844 --> 01:45:42.354
I think at this time, that would have been a little absurd, but in 2019, after 18 years of studying vaccine law and policy, she might've been able to get to the stage where she said intramuscular injection is just kind of dumb, but remember her son was hurt by the MMR, which is a subcutaneous injection.

01:45:45.976 --> 01:45:47.117
Do you see the trap we're in?

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.001
Do you see how screwed we are once they open the trap door and we start falling?

01:45:52.021 --> 01:45:55.242
We're not going to be able to grab onto the edge and pull ourselves out of the hole.

01:45:55.642 --> 01:45:58.663
We're going to be sliding down the slide all the way to what's ever at the bottom.

01:46:01.884 --> 01:46:04.324
We know that up to 10% of vaccines fail.

01:46:04.384 --> 01:46:09.386
They simply don't induce immunity in some people or some people get immunity and the immunity wanes.

01:46:09.686 --> 01:46:12.787
You cannot achieve herd immunity here in Washington state.

01:46:13.087 --> 01:46:15.507
So you must look at control for 60 years.

01:46:15.547 --> 01:46:17.508
We've had mandates since the early sixties.

01:46:17.848 --> 01:46:19.510
and yet we still don't have herd immunity.

01:46:19.530 --> 01:46:28.057
If somebody comes from Israel with measles or they come from Philippines, we have measles outbreaks and it includes people who've been vaccinated as Dr. Bark points out.

01:46:28.397 --> 01:46:35.724
So what you can realistically achieve as legislators is disease control and I support you absolutely to do that.

01:46:36.184 --> 01:46:41.787
One of the myths around the need for community immunity is that you have free riders out there.

01:46:41.807 --> 01:46:47.329
You have people who are seeking to avoid these mandates and not take the risks of vaccines.

01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:51.492
You have hundreds of people who lined up this morning before 7 a.m.

01:46:51.852 --> 01:46:53.432
to hear what's going on here.

01:46:53.713 --> 01:46:54.953
These are not free riders.

01:46:54.993 --> 01:47:00.516
These are people who have strong religious and conscientious and philosophical objections to mandates.

01:47:00.925 --> 01:47:11.995
So a religious or a philosophical or a conscientious objection to mandates is not the same as making a biological argument of implausibility.

01:47:15.038 --> 01:47:21.123
Because none of those objections assault the idea that the whole idea is dumb, that it's not effective, it doesn't work.

01:47:21.163 --> 01:47:26.308
She's saying that up to 10% of vaccines fail, which means 90% of vaccines don't fail.

01:47:31.092 --> 01:47:33.674
You will not get those people to vaccinate their children.

01:47:33.974 --> 01:47:38.878
Those people will move out of the state or they will simply go underground, but they will not comply.

01:47:39.018 --> 01:47:44.642
So I urge you to control rationally and not do things that are coercive, that violate informed consent.

01:47:45.023 --> 01:47:45.823
Thank you very much.

01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:46.824
Okay.

01:47:46.884 --> 01:47:49.246
And violate informed consent.

01:47:49.286 --> 01:47:49.886
House bill 1638.

01:47:50.527 --> 01:47:55.151
They'll be violating informed consent, but what is informed consent?

01:47:55.331 --> 01:47:58.193
If intramuscular injection is not a good idea to begin with.

01:47:59.591 --> 01:48:10.457
What is informed consent if that Mary Holland in 2019 has already seen Brandy Vaughn present over and over the idea that there's a huge difference between injection and ingestion.

01:48:13.099 --> 01:48:22.204
She's already heard Suzanne Humphrey say in 2018 on a stage she probably shared with her that she didn't think there was any way to create a good vaccine.

01:48:22.284 --> 01:48:23.585
She used to say that.

01:48:24.966 --> 01:48:40.576
And yet here she is in front of a legislature, the Washington state legislature, not making a very cogent argument against vaccination in general or vaccines in general, but saying that she supports them.

01:48:40.636 --> 01:48:46.699
She believes in them, that 90% of them work, but we're just not going to get to herd immunity.

01:48:48.921 --> 01:48:50.141
Let's listen to 2021.

01:48:50.662 --> 01:48:52.983
Maybe it'll get better after the start of the pandemic.

01:48:53.223 --> 01:48:54.084
Maybe she'll get better.

01:48:55.792 --> 01:48:59.574
I'm Tony Perkins, your host, along with Meg Kilgannon, our co-host today.

01:49:00.414 --> 01:49:14.482
On Monday, Parental Rights Foundation and Children's Health Defense filed a lawsuit against Washington DC, arguing that a 2020 law permitting minors to obtain vaccinations without parental consent is unconstitutional.

01:49:15.022 --> 01:49:25.067
The DC Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020 allows minors 11 years and up to consent to vaccines, including the COVID shot.

01:49:25.527 --> 01:49:36.394
without parental knowledge or consent if the health care provider believes the minority is capable of meeting the informed consent standard.

01:49:36.675 --> 01:49:36.955
Wow.

01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:42.779
Well, joining us to talk about this is Mary Holland, president and general counsel of Children's Health Defense.

01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:53.586
She is also the co-author and co-editor of the books Vaccine Epidemic and the HPV Vaccine on Trial Seeking Justice for a Generation Betrayed.

01:49:53.946 --> 01:49:55.367
Mary, welcome to Washington Watch.

01:49:56.169 --> 01:49:57.513
Thank you so much for having me.

01:49:59.258 --> 01:50:02.869
Mary, can you tell us about what to do to file the lawsuit?

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:08.333
So this is a very dangerous law that the Washington, D.C.

01:50:08.353 --> 01:50:11.635
City Council passed, and Congress did not override it.

01:50:11.735 --> 01:50:13.757
So we were sort of watching this process.

01:50:14.137 --> 01:50:16.178
This is potentially precedent-setting.

01:50:16.598 --> 01:50:25.544
The pharmaceutical industry had tried this in many states, but they have bicameral legislatures, and they did not succeed because parents opposed it.

01:50:25.984 --> 01:50:30.847
But in D.C., with only a unicameral legislature, they were able to get this through.

01:50:31.307 --> 01:50:37.280
This is so dangerous for children because parents won't know what vaccines their children get.

01:50:38.246 --> 01:50:40.647
It goes beyond just the parents don't know.

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:44.609
This is active concealment required by this law.

01:50:44.729 --> 01:51:03.376
So what's weird about this is, is that as a person who was supposedly advocating for children's health and educating parents, it seems pretty trivial to educate your kid who's 11 years old, that doctors do this and that vaccines are X, Y, and Z, and that you're not going to get any because you don't need any.

01:51:03.436 --> 01:51:06.097
And the doctor might try to convince you to it, but don't take any.

01:51:08.783 --> 01:51:16.088
I wouldn't worry about my 13-year-old being convinced by the doctor that his parents don't know what's best for him.

01:51:17.208 --> 01:51:19.850
I'm not worried about that with my 16-year-old either.

01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:21.831
And I'm not worried about that with my 8-year-old.

01:51:21.891 --> 01:51:25.994
But I'm a pretty competent parent, I think, after the third one.

01:51:27.575 --> 01:51:30.077
And so this is a little weird because it's also...

01:51:31.013 --> 01:51:40.838
It suggests later in the interview that even if you file an exemption, the doctors can still do it, but I guess that would mean that your child would have to ask for it.

01:51:44.212 --> 01:51:51.214
The doctor wouldn't, it's remarkable the kind of smoke and mirrors that's going on in 2021.

01:51:51.254 --> 01:51:55.916
They're already rolling out the shots that she should already be very clear in 2021.

01:51:56.456 --> 01:52:09.760
There's this guy in Pittsburgh who's already saying, and already lost his job at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine for saying that they're lying about a background and that transfection would have been inappropriate for anybody that's healthy.

01:52:12.153 --> 01:52:15.795
I wrote a review about three months before this video takes place.

01:52:15.855 --> 01:52:17.695
So the review was out there.

01:52:17.775 --> 01:52:22.497
The people knew I was already saying it and people were getting in front of me to say other things.

01:52:23.838 --> 01:52:30.961
And this same month is when Tucker Carlson goes on to say that drastic is the one who solved the lab leak.

01:52:31.001 --> 01:52:36.523
And the drastic was started by, uh, by Jamie Metzel and some guy from France.

01:52:39.741 --> 01:52:46.246
So Mary Holland has a podcast opportunity to talk about something and she talks about something very specific.

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:56.295
She's selling her books and she doesn't think little kids should be able to give consent for vaccination, which of course is easy to see, would be silly.

01:53:00.178 --> 01:53:07.424
But it's a show, it's a national security theater getting you to argue about mandates instead of getting you to argue about the whole

01:53:08.354 --> 01:53:16.225
ridiculous schedule to begin with, the whole ridiculous idea of intramuscular injection to begin with, the whole idea of augmenting a healthy child at birth.

01:53:16.645 --> 01:53:25.978
Those are all things that get juggled around like a big hamster wheel and never, you know, packed together into a really nice ice snowball and then thrown at the target.

01:53:31.527 --> 01:53:49.819
So the parents who filed religious exemptions will not know that their children got vaccines, whether it's the human papillomavirus vaccine, or whether it's a COVID shot, or whether it's a meningitis shot.

01:53:50.139 --> 01:53:56.743
The kids allegedly can consent to any federally recommended vaccine on their own

01:53:57.310 --> 01:54:02.192
and the parents won't even find out about it from their health insurer.

01:54:02.292 --> 01:54:04.333
It will be concealed from the parents.

01:54:04.413 --> 01:54:08.435
The school will have access to this information and the healthcare prep.

01:54:09.255 --> 01:54:13.257
The sad part is, is that this law is probably changing the age from 14 to 11.

01:54:15.407 --> 01:54:18.108
And so it's, again, it's semantics, it's bullshit.

01:54:18.288 --> 01:54:21.448
It's not really effectively fighting anything.

01:54:21.468 --> 01:54:23.969
And then we're talking about Washington, D.C.

01:54:24.089 --> 01:54:26.670
as being a potentially precedent-setting law.

01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:27.950
Come on.

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:30.430
She's a scripted fraud.

01:54:30.811 --> 01:54:37.092
But the healthcare practitioner and the school are disabled from giving that information to the parents.

01:54:37.592 --> 01:54:39.193
This is unconstitutional.

01:54:39.233 --> 01:54:45.415
It also violates the federal statute that put in place the vaccine program that we have today.

01:54:45.475 --> 01:54:55.300
But never mind the fact that the PREP Act being able to suspend all kinds of fundamental rights on the whim of an unelected official is unconstitutional.

01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:56.860
Let's talk about this.

01:54:57.901 --> 01:55:02.503
And that's exactly what Aaron Seary and CHD and ICANN have done for the last 15 years.

01:55:04.059 --> 01:55:05.743
So we strongly oppose it.

01:55:05.763 --> 01:55:06.245
prevail on this.

01:55:06.285 --> 01:55:06.666
We have

01:55:11.505 --> 01:55:15.807
on behalf of their children who are enrolled in the DC public school system.

01:55:16.408 --> 01:55:22.010
And we think that we feel that this is an incredibly important law to challenge.

01:55:22.211 --> 01:55:31.195
It's incredibly important to challenge this, just like it's incredibly important to defend the legal rights of Meryl Nass and her use of ivermectin.

01:55:31.695 --> 01:55:35.457
And that's not fair that she lost her license or something like that.

01:55:35.537 --> 01:55:37.158
So we got to defend her too.

01:55:38.619 --> 01:55:40.000
Because it is so potentially

01:55:41.161 --> 01:55:46.786
We just add that four cities have already sort of declared this mature minor act.

01:55:46.886 --> 01:55:55.575
And so Seattle and in New York City and in Philadelphia, they have been inviting children without their parents' knowledge to come and get COVID shots.

01:55:56.075 --> 01:55:58.918
This is tremendously concerning.

01:55:59.454 --> 01:56:05.096
It's tremendously concerning, but if the COVID shots end up to work pretty well, I guess it won't be so bad.

01:56:05.577 --> 01:56:11.719
If there really is a bad virus around there that the COVID shot could protect these kids from, maybe it won't be so bad.

01:56:12.139 --> 01:56:18.422
It's really just a question of whether it's their choice or not and whether they can make the choice without their parents or not.

01:56:18.782 --> 01:56:25.565
So they're not really questioning anything, not really questioning anything that's occurring other than whose choice it should be.

01:56:27.842 --> 01:56:30.864
She is a scripted national security state actor.

01:56:31.145 --> 01:56:36.489
And although I'm not upset with Heather Haying and Brett Weinstein, I am upset with her.

01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:44.895
There is no explanation for Mary Holland's 20 plus years of failure other than it being scripted.

01:56:45.435 --> 01:56:48.898
Just like Andrew Wakefield is scripted and Pauly Tommy is scripted.

01:56:49.618 --> 01:56:54.882
And it requires people like Mary Holland and Meryl Nass to exist in order for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:56:55.623 --> 01:56:56.844
to be who he is.

01:56:58.297 --> 01:57:03.362
essentially a puppet, not responsible for what he does, actor.

01:57:05.124 --> 01:57:20.479
I mean, if a guy on a Star Trek set is scripted to commit genocide using the transporter room and failing to transport people to another ship and they get lost and they're dead, that's not the actor's fault.

01:57:22.219 --> 01:57:23.540
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:31.143
is scripted to get rid of respiratory mRNA but approve a universal flu vaccine, then that's not the actor's fault.

01:57:33.764 --> 01:57:42.728
And these scripted people will respond in turn to make sure that Bobby feels like following the script is still the best choice.

01:57:43.828 --> 01:57:50.411
And maybe some of these podcasters will have to improvise their reactions to it, their confusion by it,

01:57:52.179 --> 01:57:55.881
But when the script comes in the mail, they'll realize they have no choice.

01:57:56.782 --> 01:58:02.926
This would appear to me, as you've described it, Mary, intentionally designed to deceive parents.

01:58:04.266 --> 01:58:11.010
And with this being concealed, I mean, it's so crazy that they choose language like that because it applies directly to CHD.

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:14.913
They are designed to deceive parents.

01:58:15.753 --> 01:58:19.696
Del Bigtree was put in place to deceive parents.

01:58:20.871 --> 01:58:25.355
And like it or not, Brian Hooker has a job deceiving parents.

01:58:25.435 --> 01:58:28.538
They all lie about why people die.

01:58:28.898 --> 01:58:37.086
They all lie about why people get sick and why people and what autism is and what pandemics, they all are.

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.821
are paid to lie about why people die.

01:58:40.442 --> 01:58:42.944
To think about, you know, there could be complications.

01:58:43.724 --> 01:58:47.387
You know, when you get this, the COVID, let's just take the COVID.

01:58:47.407 --> 01:58:49.449
There's others that this would open the door to.

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:51.650
So it's not limited to the COVID shot.

01:58:52.191 --> 01:59:00.837
But let's say they get the COVID shot and we already know that there have been some health complications for some who have gotten these shots.

01:59:01.397 --> 01:59:05.781
And a parent doesn't know all of a sudden their child could be deathly ill and they don't know why.

01:59:06.946 --> 01:59:10.689
Tony, there have been over 9,000 reported deaths.

01:59:10.829 --> 01:59:14.312
There have been over 400,000 reported injuries.

01:59:14.933 --> 01:59:19.377
The COVID shots in particular are very serious medical interventions.

01:59:19.875 --> 01:59:24.438
But every vaccine, like every drug, carries potential benefits.

01:59:24.458 --> 01:59:26.139
Do you see how imprecise that is?

01:59:26.479 --> 01:59:30.201
How every drug contains potential benefits and side effects.

01:59:30.642 --> 01:59:33.423
These are really serious medical interventions.

01:59:33.483 --> 01:59:39.447
They are already old technology being renamed now in 2021.

01:59:40.248 --> 01:59:42.649
And Mary Holland is scripted not to say it.

01:59:46.051 --> 01:59:47.272
And potential risks.

01:59:47.742 --> 01:59:51.686
That's why parents have to play a role in these decisions.

01:59:52.026 --> 01:59:52.927
These are minors.

01:59:53.087 --> 02:00:01.356
It is inconceivable to me that an 11-year-old can adequately research and understand the potential benefits and risks of a COVID shot.

02:00:01.576 --> 02:00:02.617
This is nonsense.

02:00:02.697 --> 02:00:06.581
This is the pharmaceutical industry coming in and exploiting children.

02:00:07.536 --> 02:00:17.186
you know, at the children's expense and trying to cut parents out of... This is a national security actor swooping in to take advantage of parents.

02:00:17.647 --> 02:00:20.109
That's what's so gross about Mary Holland.

02:00:21.391 --> 02:00:22.472
It's just unacceptable.

02:00:22.492 --> 02:00:26.256
It's un-American, it's unconstitutional, and it violates federal law.

02:00:27.062 --> 02:00:29.222
We're really grateful that you filed this lawsuit.

02:00:29.602 --> 02:00:47.706
I think it's incredible to me that a governing body, which in this case is the school board and the city council, that they would think that 11-year-olds could know their medical history sufficiently to actually form intelligent consent to any medical procedure, never mind a vaccine.

02:00:48.686 --> 02:00:49.486
That's it, Meg.

02:00:49.566 --> 02:00:50.706
This is dangerous.

02:00:50.866 --> 02:00:53.827
Children can potentially die from this law.

02:00:53.927 --> 02:00:55.867
That's what parents have to understand.

02:00:56.485 --> 02:00:59.149
your child could die from shots to its school.

02:00:59.169 --> 02:01:00.350
And what the shot was.

02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.550
They s

02:01:07.475 --> 02:01:11.097
And then the mom or the dad takes the kid to get two more COVID shots.

02:01:11.477 --> 02:01:12.878
We don't know what that would do.

02:01:13.078 --> 02:01:14.039
It might be within a shot.

02:01:14.279 --> 02:01:24.625
Also now this law prevents like, you know, maybe the parents will give the kids two shots and then because they were at school and could give consent at school, they might give consent.

02:01:25.105 --> 02:01:27.887
Do you see how stupid that argument is?

02:01:29.045 --> 02:01:42.203
When in reality it's an old methodology called transfection that's being renamed by a bunch of scripted actors so that the IP clock can be reset and so that they could be called untested countermeasures.

02:01:44.735 --> 02:01:58.042
Do you see how dark it is that they put an anti-vax movement, a mom that claims to be a anti-vaxxer trying to help other moms understand the pros and cons of vaccination?

02:01:58.062 --> 02:02:00.804
They put those people out there to tell us this?

02:02:02.665 --> 02:02:06.807
Do you see how nasty that is and the kind of trap that we're in?

02:02:06.827 --> 02:02:11.550
For a period of time.

02:02:12.136 --> 02:02:17.422
I just can't bring across enough how dangerous this is and how exploitative this is.

02:02:18.883 --> 02:02:30.896
And I would add that, to add insult to injury here, is that they're going to bill the parent's health insurer without them even knowing what the service provided was?

02:02:30.916 --> 02:02:32.518
I mean, this is incredible.

02:02:33.266 --> 02:02:34.767
It's that's the point, Tony.

02:02:34.887 --> 02:02:35.688
It's incredible.

02:02:35.988 --> 02:02:50.337
We could not believe this as this passed through the City Council and then it sat on the mayor's desk and we tried to get people to call into the mayor and there were there was hundreds of thousands of emails and phone calls, but that.

02:02:52.725 --> 02:02:53.426
RFK Jr.

02:02:53.526 --> 02:02:58.331
just dropped a hammer on Bill Gates and his mRNA vaccines that he has funded.

02:02:58.351 --> 02:03:00.373
And we're going to tell you how, because the U.S.

02:03:00.393 --> 02:03:07.621
Department of Health and Human Services announced it will stop developing new mRNA vaccines because, according to RFK Jr.,

02:03:08.502 --> 02:03:19.827
mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract and paradoxically encourage new mutations that can actually prolong pandemics.

02:03:20.247 --> 02:03:23.328
Well, that's interesting and nice of them to finally admit.

02:03:23.388 --> 02:03:28.530
What they're not admitting is what are some of the health concerns about mRNA.

02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:36.093
And what they're also not saying is that mRNA vaccines will still be available to be developed through private vaccine makers.

02:03:36.413 --> 02:03:37.834
They just won't be government funded.

02:03:38.474 --> 02:03:43.395
Also, that they will continue to be in what they call late-stage vaccines.

02:03:43.455 --> 02:03:49.756
So there are plenty of cancer vaccines that have mRNA in them, which may still hit market.

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:59.438
So are we witnessing a quiet retreat from the mRNA revolution or the beginning of a new phase with maybe even fewer guardrails and even less public accountability?

02:04:00.218 --> 02:04:01.818
Mary Holland joins us to discuss.

02:04:01.878 --> 02:04:04.879
She's the CEO of the Children's Health Defense and one of the editors

02:04:05.619 --> 02:04:12.561
of the amazing book, Turtles All the Way Down, which in my opinion is the most comprehensive review of vaccine research that you can find.

02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:14.641
So thank you for joining us today.

02:04:17.742 --> 02:04:18.402
It's a pleasure.

02:04:18.943 --> 02:04:27.965
So can you explain this HHS announcement and maybe tell us what they are not admitting about the mRNA technology?

02:04:28.624 --> 02:04:32.305
So the way that we see this is it's a step in the right direction.

02:04:32.465 --> 02:04:34.365
It is not the full story, right?

02:04:34.405 --> 02:04:41.947
So as you're pointing out, it doesn't say that these shots have been injurious and deadly on a scale never before seen.

02:04:42.707 --> 02:04:47.189
In the past, these products, these mRNA products were considered gene therapies.

02:04:47.509 --> 02:04:48.689
They were not vaccines.

02:04:48.769 --> 02:04:52.470
They had to change the definition of vaccines to bring these on the market.

02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:55.590
That's exactly wrong.

02:04:55.790 --> 02:05:00.372
It is not that they changed them that before they were gene therapies.

02:05:00.432 --> 02:05:04.074
And so they had to change the definition of vaccine in order to get them in.

02:05:04.134 --> 02:05:05.675
That's exactly wrong.

02:05:06.235 --> 02:05:07.796
That is exactly wrong.

02:05:09.937 --> 02:05:11.698
They were transfections.

02:05:11.898 --> 02:05:13.379
They had an old name.

02:05:13.479 --> 02:05:20.103
They'd already been used widely across every bench in academic America and the West and

02:05:20.683 --> 02:05:26.505
They were part of the standard manufacturing process for protein biologics.

02:05:27.806 --> 02:05:30.207
Transfection was used all the time.

02:05:30.587 --> 02:05:38.851
So this idea that they used to be called gene therapies and then they changed the definition of vaccine to allow it is wrong.

02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:39.871
Stop lying!

02:05:40.271 --> 02:05:42.472
It is scripted wrong.

02:05:42.872 --> 02:05:44.233
Stop lying!

02:05:47.864 --> 02:05:50.667
I'm going to try and push it back a little bit because you really need to hear.

02:05:51.187 --> 02:05:52.729
That's exactly wrong.

02:05:53.243 --> 02:05:57.644
So it doesn't deal with all of this, but it's a step in the right for considered gene therapies.

02:05:57.964 --> 02:05:59.164
They were not vaccines.

02:05:59.224 --> 02:06:02.985
They had to change the definition of vaccines to bring these on the market.

02:06:03.465 --> 02:06:22.368
So it doesn't deal with all of this, but it's a step in the right direction in that this order a couple of days ago from HHS Secretary Kennedy cuts off $500 million of funding that was primarily gonna go to Pfizer and Moderna, the two main manufacturers of about 97% of the COVID shots that were administered.

02:06:22.828 --> 02:06:27.793
From our point of view, this mRNA platform is not ready for prime time, right?

02:06:27.873 --> 02:06:31.397
It needs a lot, a lot, a lot more research to begin.

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:39.005
Does that sound like somebody that thinks that hundreds of thousands of people were injured and thousands of people were killed by it?

02:06:39.085 --> 02:06:40.807
It's not ready for prime time?

02:06:42.401 --> 02:06:48.288
Does it sound like she takes seriously the murder of hundreds of thousands of Americans over the last five years?

02:06:48.728 --> 02:07:01.984
Does it sound like she takes seriously the injuring of thousands of children over the last 25 years by the vaccine schedule that she became woefully aware of 18, 25 years ago when her son was injured by an MMR shot?

02:07:03.817 --> 02:07:07.485
Does this sound like a lady who's really serious?

02:07:07.545 --> 02:07:10.872
Or does this sound like a lady who's getting paid about $270,000 a year to work off of Zoom?

02:07:17.981 --> 02:07:19.582
giving this to all people.

02:07:19.722 --> 02:07:23.324
It basically creates a kind of an autoimmune condition.

02:07:23.584 --> 02:07:29.827
This RNA instructions then creates the antigen in your body and you defend against it, right?

02:07:29.847 --> 02:07:35.629
So in the COVID shot, it gave you the instructions to form the spike protein, only they don't know how long it lasts.

02:07:35.849 --> 02:07:37.530
They don't know what the dosing should be.

02:07:37.890 --> 02:07:38.631
Everybody's different.

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:41.672
And the evidence- So shout out to Catherine Organic.

02:07:41.732 --> 02:07:45.114
I'm not gonna make a slide for this because I think I wanna hold it for the book.

02:07:45.914 --> 02:07:54.660
But I want to shout out to Catherine and I want to shout out to all of my followers and people that are following the stream regularly so that you really understand what the cutting edge of this biology is.

02:07:55.740 --> 02:08:06.007
But it is a universal error that everybody from Redacted and Mary Holland all the way up to Kevin McKernan are now making.

02:08:06.227 --> 02:08:12.671
And the scripted error is they keep referring to the mRNA as having pseudouridine.

02:08:12.791 --> 02:08:15.053
And this is absolutely positively wrong.

02:08:16.092 --> 02:08:20.874
Number one, pseudouridine is the natural alternate uracil.

02:08:21.754 --> 02:08:29.498
And pseudouridine is used by our own RNAs to help with regulation and other things that we don't fully understand.

02:08:29.578 --> 02:08:32.039
But that pseudouridine is a thing.

02:08:33.519 --> 02:08:39.442
And one methyl pseudouridine is an analog nucleotide that is synthetic.

02:08:42.188 --> 02:08:50.211
And so one of the things that they have achieved here, I'm afraid, is that they have rolled out different analogs of nucleotides.

02:08:51.354 --> 02:08:58.119
and tested the expression length and temporal lasting effects of the transfections.

02:08:58.559 --> 02:09:07.625
And that's why they have people like Peter McCullough out there on social media saying that I have a patient who I can find spike protein in her body after three and a half years.

02:09:08.086 --> 02:09:18.433
That sounds like the perfect gene therapy for somebody who's missing an enzyme, who has a genetic disorder where an enzyme is malfunctioning or missing or knocked out.

02:09:19.298 --> 02:09:33.830
we could transfect them once every three or four months and get sustained expression of the protein we're missing, it sounds like we've made a pretty good step forward in terms of genetic curing of genetic maladies.

02:09:35.748 --> 02:09:42.832
And so we can tell everybody in the world that it's all about the spike protein, and it's terrible the spike protein's around so long.

02:09:43.252 --> 02:09:57.761
But what the people on the inside are most likely hearing is that some of the batches with some of the analog nucleotides are producing an extraordinary long-lasting transfection, maybe even longer than any of them ever hoped.

02:10:00.017 --> 02:10:24.734
And since they know where the placebos are, and they know where the pseudouridine is, and they know where the N1 methyl pseudouridine is, and they know where all the other analogs went that nobody ever talked about, there could be a whole host of experimental data sets that have been created and a whole host of different levels of progress that have been made in terms of understanding transfection in the context of humans.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:49.271
And we're all waving our hands about the DNA contamination and about the inappropriateness of the spike protein or the fear and cleavage site, when in reality, they have taken advantage of the pandemic to carefully orchestrate the release of different analog nucleotides to see which ones of these types of transfections would be the most long lasting, the least toxic, yada, yada, yada.

02:10:51.496 --> 02:11:13.110
And that gets hidden behind scripted actors who are unable to point out that it's really weird that Bret Weinstein doesn't know it's N-1-methyl pseudo-uridine, that Kevin McKernan, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project, goes on huge podcasts and just can't seem to say it right, and also doesn't seem to point out that that's a big deal.

02:11:14.138 --> 02:11:20.260
Because had they just enriched it for pseudouridine, they wouldn't have technically been doing anything that was chemically unnatural.

02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:30.082
But if they enriched it for N1 methyl pseudouridine, now they are using a synthetic analog of RNA and testing it in humans.

02:11:32.322 --> 02:11:41.245
Once again, shout out to Catherine Organic in the chat, because she is the one that has hammered this home to me in the chat and behind the scenes for a long time.

02:11:41.305 --> 02:11:41.925
And it is her.

02:11:42.938 --> 02:11:50.680
her sharing with what she's reading and learning that has brought me to the level of understanding that I think I can hit that home run whenever I want to.

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:54.761
And I just haven't hit it yet because I don't want any of these scripted fools taking it.

02:11:56.142 --> 02:11:58.002
And I think it's not very likely.

02:11:58.062 --> 02:12:00.103
I think because they are scripted not to take it.

02:12:01.143 --> 02:12:11.926
But I assure you, we are on that like flies and we will be on it like flies because it is one of the biggest weaknesses of their fake dissident stance is that

02:12:12.967 --> 02:12:21.612
A specificity, that lack of specificity with regard to the modification of the RNA cannot be by accident.

02:12:25.267 --> 02:12:27.508
Hey, Catherine Organic is in there, nice.

02:12:27.748 --> 02:12:29.748
Glad to see you there, good, good, good.

02:12:29.888 --> 02:12:34.249
It's very strong that the more shots you got, the more likely you were to get COVID.

02:12:34.269 --> 02:12:37.150
I mean, that's what a Cleveland Clinic study says.

02:12:37.170 --> 02:12:41.391
So I am hopefully a step in the right direction, but this is not everything we want.

02:12:41.551 --> 02:12:46.192
Children's Health Defense is on record with many other groups that these products should not be on the market.

02:12:46.232 --> 02:12:46.932
They're unsafe.

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.192
They're just not safe.

02:12:48.212 --> 02:12:49.412
They're not really vaccines.

02:12:49.433 --> 02:12:51.273
They don't prevent transmission full stop.

02:12:52.045 --> 02:12:55.086
Did regulators know about this before the COVID rollout?

02:12:55.206 --> 02:12:56.226
And I mean, RFK Jr.

02:12:56.266 --> 02:13:01.907
says that there's manipulations in- They don't stop transmission full stop.

02:13:01.947 --> 02:13:12.710
You see, there again, we are with this ineffective rhetoric, which leaves the door open for all kinds of possibilities, like they could still help people.

02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:17.351
Maybe they save old people from having severe COVID, which is what they all say anyway, right?

02:13:18.712 --> 02:13:32.375
And so how is it possible that somebody that's been supposedly fighting this illusion for 20 years is still incapable of seeing that that statement right there was so weak, it was useless.

02:13:33.675 --> 02:13:35.355
They didn't stop transmission.

02:13:35.655 --> 02:13:36.015
Come on.

02:13:36.835 --> 02:13:40.536
Gene manipulations and it prolongs the pandemic, it makes it worse.

02:13:40.576 --> 02:13:41.976
So do regulators know about this?

02:13:42.036 --> 02:13:44.697
And what evidence do we have now that they were fully in the tank on this?

02:13:46.239 --> 02:13:47.981
It's a great question, Clayton.

02:13:48.462 --> 02:13:59.114
What we do know is that a spokesperson for Pfizer said to the European Parliament, to the European Union, we never tested really whether it stopped transmission.

02:13:59.174 --> 02:14:00.997
I mean, that's kind of incredible.

02:14:01.497 --> 02:14:20.241
I do think the research that Catherine Watt and Sasha Letypova have done that basically is based on the lawsuit of Brooke Jackson against Ventavia and against Pfizer really made clear that this was an operation that was led by the Department of Defense.

02:14:20.361 --> 02:14:21.921
It's not really negotiable, right?

02:14:21.981 --> 02:14:25.882
It was not led by HHS or the pharmaceutical makers.

02:14:25.942 --> 02:14:30.183
It was led by the Department of Defense under very weird kind of

02:14:30.583 --> 02:14:31.304
protocols.

02:14:31.544 --> 02:14:36.949
And so what did DOD know about what was going to happen with these shots?

02:14:37.309 --> 02:14:39.331
I don't think we have the full story.

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:45.476
As Kennedy's statement basically makes clear, we don't fully know what all the ingredients are in these shots.

02:14:45.536 --> 02:14:49.160
Remember, these were rolled out under emergency use authorization.

02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:50.641
They might be effective.

02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:55.045
People could not give full informed consent because they didn't know what was in them.

02:14:55.425 --> 02:14:57.506
So I don't think we have the full story.

02:14:57.566 --> 02:15:05.549
My personal view is that we have to get to the bottom of what was known by whom and when, or we're going to fall for this again.

02:15:06.049 --> 02:15:17.454
Brian Hooker knew they were transfections because he was using transfection for 16 years as the employee of a government lab, transfecting and transforming plants to produce medicine.

02:15:18.686 --> 02:15:32.275
So her chief science officer at Children's Health Defense knows that these weren't gene therapies, they had a real name, they were transfections and lots of people were using them before the pandemic and he used them in plants.

02:15:34.076 --> 02:15:43.202
So we don't need to get the bottom of anything except for how in the hell is it possible that Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:15:43.262 --> 02:15:45.804
who is in now our HHS secretary.

02:15:47.045 --> 02:15:48.885
We are under attack, ladies and gentlemen.

02:15:48.905 --> 02:15:53.527
America's being undermined by scripted actors, and she is one of them.

02:15:53.687 --> 02:15:56.507
People are gonna fall for this again, and we can't let that happen.

02:15:56.848 --> 02:16:13.672
This pandemic should be, the pandemic, whatever, this COVID experience should be the wake-up call of we are headed on a path towards medical tyranny unless we look at what happened, punish the people who committed crimes, and then deal with the reality of

02:16:14.192 --> 02:16:16.954
Punishing people who commit crimes is not the way out.

02:16:19.636 --> 02:16:25.320
There aren't very many crimes if it's a complex theater of actors and unwitting participants.

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:32.845
There's not very much crime if everybody that really is working in this doesn't understand that intramuscular injection's just dumb.

02:16:33.305 --> 02:16:38.629
It's not a crime if Brian Hooker had to pay the bills.

02:16:38.689 --> 02:16:42.652
It's not a crime if, like, there's just a lot of gray area here now.

02:16:44.491 --> 02:16:48.195
And I'm very, very humbly submitting that I see it.

02:16:49.356 --> 02:16:51.238
There's no gray area around Mary Holland.

02:16:52.019 --> 02:16:53.921
There's no gray area around Meryl Nass.

02:16:53.961 --> 02:16:56.043
And there's no gray area around Brian Hooker.

02:16:56.123 --> 02:17:06.274
I know that those three people know for sure that at some point they took the role that they are now in, and they knew that their role was acting.

02:17:09.127 --> 02:17:14.511
Brian Hooker may have thought that he was doing something like getting Bobby Kennedy to the White House, but she didn't.

02:17:15.291 --> 02:17:16.292
Meryl Nass didn't.

02:17:17.212 --> 02:17:18.273
Robert Malone didn't.

02:17:19.294 --> 02:17:20.394
Jessica Rose didn't.

02:17:20.575 --> 02:17:21.835
Kevin McKernan didn't.

02:17:22.536 --> 02:17:24.157
Kevin McCairn didn't.

02:17:24.277 --> 02:17:25.418
Charles Rixey didn't.

02:17:26.999 --> 02:17:29.080
You know, these people are malevolent.

02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.461
They were recruited.

02:17:30.721 --> 02:17:31.622
They joined up.

02:17:31.982 --> 02:17:37.866
And even if they were told that there was a pandemic that needed their help, by now,

02:17:39.093 --> 02:17:46.700
if they were who they claim to have been at the start, should have pulled themselves out of the operation by now.

02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:51.844
And because they haven't pulled themselves out, they have to know by now they've accepted the script.

02:17:54.327 --> 02:17:57.429
Most of them have never even seen me or know who I am.

02:17:57.710 --> 02:18:00.112
What should be the medical paradigm?

02:18:01.812 --> 02:18:09.876
Now, what do you think of the fact that private companies will still be able to use mRNA technology to their heart's delight?

02:18:10.537 --> 02:18:18.361
Now, we saw Dr. Marty Macari saying, we're gonna do better at clinical trials because I made a list, I think a year or two ago.

02:18:18.401 --> 02:18:21.803
Now remember, Marty Macari has just gotten rid of animal testing.

02:18:21.843 --> 02:18:27.225
It used to be mice and then non-mice and then maybe non-human primates and then humans.

02:18:27.726 --> 02:18:29.667
We're getting rid of animal testing

02:18:30.347 --> 02:18:35.129
And we're doing what is called post-market surveillance, which is just basically testing in humans.

02:18:35.609 --> 02:18:38.771
And so Mary Holland should be thoroughly against that.

02:18:40.391 --> 02:18:49.615
Of all the vaccines that had received either emergency use or somehow rushed through, skipped trials, basically skipped full trials.

02:18:50.315 --> 02:18:54.497
So we know that mRNA is in several late stage cancer vaccines.

02:18:57.122 --> 02:18:58.563
So I guess a two-part question.

02:18:58.764 --> 02:19:02.647
One, is there a possibility that it is effective in a cancer vaccine?

02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:09.654
And two, can we trust that it will get a full clinical trial with full explanation?

02:19:12.028 --> 02:19:13.550
Well, I think they were used.

02:19:13.950 --> 02:19:19.397
mRNA shots have been used as explicit gene therapy for cancer patients for some time.

02:19:19.577 --> 02:19:29.869
Obviously, the calculus for somebody who has an otherwise potentially fatal disease is a completely different calculus than a healthy six-month-old, right?

02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:30.730
Or a healthy 40.

02:19:31.391 --> 02:19:31.651
world.

02:19:47.407 --> 02:19:51.230
These are going to continue to be, obviously, the powers that be.

02:19:51.350 --> 02:20:00.536
The major biopharmaceutical, the biomedical pharmaceutical industries have invested trillions, probably, in this platform because it's fast.

02:20:00.856 --> 02:20:06.260
No, actually, the Human Genome Project and the NIH invested trillions of dollars.

02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:10.402
You see, this is such a monumental fail.

02:20:10.503 --> 02:20:15.986
She just said that pharmaceutical industries invested all this money in this technology.

02:20:16.186 --> 02:20:16.667
Wow.

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:19.476
I mean that is just wow.

02:20:20.339 --> 02:20:22.487
That is remarkably scripted dumb.

02:20:27.213 --> 02:20:32.374
You can make this in like 100 days and it's specific, at least they think.

02:20:33.454 --> 02:20:37.955
I don't believe right now that the private sector is gonna stop all development.

02:20:38.335 --> 02:20:49.637
I do believe that it's absolutely Kennedy's idea that there can be no future vaccine products put on the market without true inert placebo controls.

02:20:49.857 --> 02:20:50.977
That was never the case.

02:20:50.997 --> 02:20:55.858
They were used in some respects in COVID, but those clinical trials were highly manipulated.

02:20:56.338 --> 02:21:06.385
I think there is going to be a different level of scrutiny around clinical trials for vaccines than there ever has been for any kind of vaccines going forward.

02:21:06.405 --> 02:21:14.330
So I do think that mRNA shots to get licensed through the FDA are going to have to meet a much higher level.

02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:18.573
But I don't expect that all research using this platform is going to stop.

02:21:19.674 --> 02:21:26.558
Arguably it shouldn't, it just shouldn't be forced on people and it shouldn't be forced on people with lies, which is what happened to us during COVID.

02:21:27.679 --> 02:21:48.691
The unfortunate thing is, very succinctly said by my friend Mark, is that the people who are responsible for getting everybody to be afraid in 2020 and responsible for getting everybody to accept the novel virus and its potential to kill billions, but also the potential for zero COVID,

02:21:50.410 --> 02:21:57.613
Those people are now the same people who are telling you that the mRNA is bad and that RFK is saving us.

02:21:59.833 --> 02:22:00.914
That's the irony of it.

02:22:01.014 --> 02:22:13.058
If those people would have had their heads in the right place in 2020, most people would have never taken transfection because they would have known what it was and they wouldn't have taken it.

02:22:13.962 --> 02:22:22.146
But because these people were where they were, and because in 2021 she's not saying it very precisely, people still think it might work.

02:22:22.266 --> 02:22:23.067
It might save them.

02:22:23.107 --> 02:22:25.188
It might be for me if it's not for everybody.

02:22:25.248 --> 02:22:28.029
I'm not the healthiest guy in the world, so maybe I should take it.

02:22:28.569 --> 02:22:34.412
This imprecision labels Mary Holland as a scripted traitor to our grandkids.

02:22:34.472 --> 02:22:39.095
And Mary Holland deserves ire and anger and frustration.

02:22:40.129 --> 02:22:44.155
She is not a fooled person like Heather Hain.

02:22:45.617 --> 02:22:48.621
I don't like Heather either, but Heather is really fooled.

02:22:49.502 --> 02:22:51.325
Mary is really scripted.

02:22:53.746 --> 02:22:55.827
The thing that's being forced on us is all this advertising.

02:22:56.047 --> 02:22:58.027
And I know we're getting ready for the NFL season.

02:22:58.047 --> 02:23:05.249
You're going to see, as the World Series games and playoffs unfold, all of the commercials, you're going to see big Pfizer.

02:23:05.549 --> 02:23:10.011
You're going to see Travis Kelsey rolling up his arm saying, hey, I got two shots.

02:23:10.051 --> 02:23:12.411
I got my flu shot, and I got my other Band-Aid here.

02:23:12.511 --> 02:23:13.471
Go get your COVID shot.

02:23:13.511 --> 02:23:14.612
You can get it for two for one.

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:16.252
Just go down to Walgreens and grab them.

02:23:16.572 --> 02:23:21.114
So they're going to be met with this big advertising onslaught as we head into the fall and the Christmas season.

02:23:23.612 --> 02:23:27.115
Yeah, I agree with you.

02:23:27.555 --> 02:23:33.580
You know, the US is one of two countries in the world with direct to consumer prescription pharmaceutical drug advertising.

02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:35.602
We are absolutely aberrant on this.

02:23:35.702 --> 02:23:42.287
It is ridiculous to be advertising medical products and not you know, with no controls essentially.

02:23:47.511 --> 02:23:49.193
No, that's the wrong song.

02:23:49.213 --> 02:23:49.593
This one.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:55.920
you

02:25:29.704 --> 02:25:29.785
do

02:26:51.285 --> 02:26:54.307
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

02:26:54.347 --> 02:26:56.289
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:26:56.309 --> 02:27:00.712
You can find the stain of my academic work on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

02:27:00.732 --> 02:27:11.078
He was my last name, Cooey, and the first initials J and J. You would be able to see three presentations to the group called Panda, but those were lost and not on their Rumble site.

02:27:11.499 --> 02:27:19.404
You can also see my work horribly misrepresented on a substack called Woodhouse 76, and also a substack written by Sasha Latopova.

02:27:19.444 --> 02:27:20.645
I don't know what the name of that one is.

02:27:21.505 --> 02:27:24.807
I used to work for Children's Health Defense under Brian Hooker, who I think is a fraud.

02:27:25.408 --> 02:27:27.789
I used to work for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:27:27.989 --> 02:27:31.392
as a scientific advisor, and I think he's just a scripted actor.

02:27:32.052 --> 02:27:41.578
And I think Jay Bhattacharya is a guy who tried to play me over three years as a fool, but is actually just somebody also on a script provided by Robert Malone.

02:27:42.518 --> 02:27:45.360
Ladies and gentlemen, I know what I'm saying is not easy to swallow.

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:45.881
I do have a

02:27:46.681 --> 02:27:51.643
a YouTube channel called JC on the Bike, which documented my original entry into this mess.

02:27:52.164 --> 02:27:56.245
I also have a JC in the Woods channel, which is just my alternative that I'm not using right now.

02:27:56.766 --> 02:28:02.188
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to support this work and you want to do it consistently, please share it.

02:28:02.288 --> 02:28:03.609
The best way to do it

02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:06.451
is to download the PeerTube app.

02:28:06.531 --> 02:28:11.934
I know it sounds crazy, but PeerTube is a YouTube clone.

02:28:12.535 --> 02:28:16.797
The code is open source, and it is available on GitHub.

02:28:17.558 --> 02:28:19.739
And I have a website.

02:28:19.839 --> 02:28:29.626
It is stream.gigaohm.bio, where I stream live, and I also store all of these videos for free, or you can download them as videos or as audio.

02:28:29.666 --> 02:28:31.567
There, you can see it there, live.

02:28:31.867 --> 02:28:34.029
And actually, it's crazy.

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:40.551
But PeerTube actually has an app and the app works spectacularly.

02:28:40.651 --> 02:28:44.233
The YouTube, sorry, the PeerTube website is glitchy.

02:28:44.293 --> 02:28:51.395
The YouTube, the PeerTube website stops every once in a while, but the, the, um, why isn't that running?

02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:55.137
That should be like this and get rid of this.

02:28:56.237 --> 02:29:00.279
The PeerTube website is extraordinary because it, um,

02:29:02.583 --> 02:29:03.104
It works.

02:29:03.384 --> 02:29:04.486
It's nice for sharing.

02:29:04.526 --> 02:29:06.629
You can download the stuff and watch it later.

02:29:06.689 --> 02:29:10.234
But the PeerTube app works almost flawlessly.

02:29:10.454 --> 02:29:15.421
And it puts Gigaohm Biological on any device you want, an iPad or a phone.

02:29:15.882 --> 02:29:17.064
It is a small app.

02:29:17.144 --> 02:29:18.205
It is called PeerTube.

02:29:18.726 --> 02:29:21.668
It looks like a squid with orange and brown and white.

02:29:22.089 --> 02:29:27.953
If you install it, you can find a way to enter, to input the URL stream.gingom.bio.

02:29:28.373 --> 02:29:30.715
And all of these videos will just populate.

02:29:30.755 --> 02:29:31.516
They will be there.

02:29:31.576 --> 02:29:32.877
The app works perfectly.

02:29:33.337 --> 02:29:34.738
There is no login.

02:29:35.699 --> 02:29:37.120
There is no login.

02:29:38.749 --> 02:29:48.719
There is no login, there is no email address needed, there is no algorithm, there is no personal data stored.

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:53.684
And this makes it something that no one else on the internet is offering you.

02:29:53.925 --> 02:29:57.548
No one like Robert Malone is offering you something like that.

02:29:58.189 --> 02:29:59.090
No one like...

02:30:00.603 --> 02:30:15.668
Any of these people is producing what Mark and I are now doing, which is a separate platform without a login, without email requirement, without registration that provides our information, our productions for free.

02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:21.150
See how incredible it is that no one else does that.

02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:23.931
Rumble app, do you want the Rumble app on your phone?

02:30:24.892 --> 02:30:36.039
Do you want a special app for Substack on your phone or do you want an open source, tiny, freely available to modify app that requires nothing from you?

02:30:37.102 --> 02:30:40.345
other than a website, and then you can watch me for free on your phone.

02:30:40.445 --> 02:30:45.029
I don't think there's a better offer out there, especially for the work that Mark and I are doing.

02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:59.842
And what I plan to do by the end of the year is start a non-profit that will allow me to take the money that I raise and put peer tubes out there for people like Dan Cohen, and people like Joe Marshall, and people like Mark Kulak, who deserve his own peer tube.

02:31:00.382 --> 02:31:09.044
And then you can populate your PeerTube app with separate channels, separate websites that are all independent parts of the bright web.

02:31:09.824 --> 02:31:12.564
I hope you're ready for the future because the future is right now.

02:31:13.005 --> 02:31:14.725
This is bullshit, okay?

02:31:15.205 --> 02:31:18.686
Telling us that this is still not right.

02:31:18.766 --> 02:31:19.706
It's so annoying.

02:31:20.606 --> 02:31:25.807
This should be automatically and it should loop and tell start and it should be muted.

02:31:28.568 --> 02:31:29.448
Muted, I said.

02:31:33.689 --> 02:31:35.210
This is bullshit, okay?

02:31:35.930 --> 02:31:43.955
DOD is deploying a kill box is exactly what Mary Holland told you by citing Catherine and by citing Sasha.

02:31:44.075 --> 02:31:44.715
It's bullshit.

02:31:45.376 --> 02:31:46.796
And we'll talk all about it tomorrow.

02:31:47.137 --> 02:31:51.539
The shot was a bioweapon is also a bullshit argument that doesn't get your kids free.

02:31:51.959 --> 02:31:58.123
And also pandemics do not occur naturally is a stupidly bullshit argument scripted by

02:31:58.903 --> 02:32:03.646
Malevolent actors and and and promoted by malevolent actors.

02:32:03.707 --> 02:32:07.970
We are going to produce the list that will break it forever We'll do that tomorrow.

02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:26.723
Thank you very much for joining me The basic gist of it is is that you can make a really long list and not tell anybody the truth And the truth is very simple intramuscular injections a dumb idea from a long time ago Transfection in healthy humans was always a crime because these are old technologies renamed and RNA cannot frickin pandemic

02:32:28.581 --> 02:32:29.341
Thanks for being here.

02:32:29.361 --> 02:32:30.022
See you tomorrow.
