WEBVTT

00:10.377 --> 00:11.297
Testing 1-2.

00:11.377 --> 00:14.757
My son just brought me a couple eggs so it's actually perfect timing.

00:15.518 --> 00:17.518
I'm gonna let this intro run.

00:19.158 --> 00:24.899
The intro is going to be mostly musical for the first part.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.000
I just gotta find my song again.

00:27.160 --> 00:27.420
Shoot.

00:29.810 --> 00:30.871
Good to see everybody.

00:30.971 --> 00:41.757
I hope people are in a good mood and I hope people aren't getting swept away by the kinds of things that are happening in the news right now.

00:41.797 --> 00:42.657
Good to see everybody.

00:42.697 --> 00:43.358
Free mayonnaise.

00:45.058 --> 00:46.119
Arthur, good to see you.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.360
Please share it out.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.222
I think I should also be live on the tube.

00:52.623 --> 00:54.103
Let me just check that quick.

00:54.183 --> 00:58.326
It says excellent connection, so I think that looks pretty good as well.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.451
See you in a few minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02.471 --> 01:03.252
Thanks for being here.

01:03.332 --> 01:04.212
Feel free to share it.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.076
Shouldn't just be a few people that are leaders.

01:10.176 --> 01:13.118
Everybody has to figure out their own leader inside themselves.

01:13.499 --> 01:18.842
If they're too shy to go approach somebody in person, then stick a card or a flyer on someone's car next to you.

01:18.963 --> 01:24.186
Every time you park your car, stick a card inside of a gas station credit card slot.

01:24.346 --> 01:29.550
Every time you get gas, if everybody that is aware of the truth and awake to the truth

01:30.060 --> 01:31.461
started to do these things.

01:31.761 --> 01:36.623
We can touch people, the hearts and minds of people, one person at a time in day-to-day living.

01:36.663 --> 01:42.106
We don't need these echo chambers online where we're all repeating to the same followers most of the time.

01:42.426 --> 01:49.970
We get a few new people, but I think we really need more people to take what they're learning and get out there and touch the people that they're in a community with.

01:51.971 --> 01:57.974
By about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen

01:58.516 --> 02:02.138
spinsters, and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

02:02.678 --> 02:06.420
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore, they must believe.

02:08.642 --> 02:11.183
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes.

02:11.223 --> 02:12.744
And I know that you don't read them.

02:13.371 --> 02:16.852
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

02:17.112 --> 02:18.152
But this one is pretty cool.

02:18.512 --> 02:21.252
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

02:21.973 --> 02:25.233
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

02:25.853 --> 02:28.314
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

02:28.354 --> 02:33.335
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

02:33.615 --> 02:36.055
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

02:36.075 --> 02:38.356
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

02:39.016 --> 02:40.476
I mean, can you be any more

02:41.778 --> 02:46.943
ridiculous in your self-lampooning or maybe it was just an absolute admission.

02:48.125 --> 02:51.048
He says it right at the beginning of his course.

02:52.229 --> 02:59.276
And he leaves out part of the quote that says, when I was your age, I always did it for a half an hour a day.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.980
It's not accidental, ladies and gentlemen.

03:04.079 --> 03:27.276
So that is what I've been predicting all the time, that ultimately this evolution would inevitably lead to the emergence of a highly virulent variant that would cause waves of hospitalization and severe disease in highly vaccinated countries.

03:27.416 --> 03:32.059
Of course, always the same, only in highly vaccinated countries, right?

03:33.541 --> 03:33.901
So that's a relief.

03:33.921 --> 03:35.022
It's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

03:35.042 --> 03:37.204
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:37.224 --> 03:39.827
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:39.847 --> 03:41.988
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:42.008 --> 03:44.351
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:44.371 --> 03:46.432
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:46.472 --> 03:48.894
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:48.915 --> 03:51.317
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:51.337 --> 03:53.659
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:53.699 --> 03:56.401
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:56.421 --> 03:59.724
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:59.744 --> 04:00.805
I'm afraid that the latest data tells

04:02.555 --> 04:03.256
And I have lied.

04:03.276 --> 04:04.316
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:04.336 --> 04:05.257
I don't want to lie.

04:05.277 --> 04:07.118
I don't think I'm a liar.

04:07.218 --> 04:08.239
I try not to be a liar.

04:08.279 --> 04:09.119
I don't want to be a liar.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.461
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

04:14.703 --> 04:16.504
Specializations should make you suspicious.

04:17.184 --> 04:23.428
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

04:23.869 --> 04:25.830
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.371
And that's sort of my starting bias.

04:44.795 --> 05:07.327
You know our love was meant to be The kind of love to last forever And I want you here with me From tonight until the end of time

05:09.537 --> 05:14.462
But Jesus said that R&E can't end in it, it can't.

05:33.957 --> 05:35.498
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

05:35.538 --> 05:36.198
Thank you very much.

05:36.238 --> 05:37.459
Can you hear me better now or not?

05:37.799 --> 05:38.679
Yes, much better.

05:39.420 --> 05:47.823
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

05:58.863 --> 06:06.325
tape analogy because that really really hit home for me and I think people will would love to hear that analogy.

06:24.608 --> 06:50.407
You loosen up everywhere I go Always on my mind, you're in my heart, in my soul You're the meaning in my life, you're the inspiration You bring feeling to my life, you're the inspiration

06:53.659 --> 07:01.591
I wanna have you hear me say it No one needs you more than I do

07:18.211 --> 07:20.912
I wanna have you near me.

07:21.112 --> 07:31.876
I wanna have you near me and say, yeah, no one needs you more than I need you.

07:32.797 --> 07:34.377
You're the meaning in my life.

07:34.617 --> 07:36.218
You're the inspiration.

07:36.258 --> 07:39.219
You bring feeling to my life.

07:39.279 --> 07:41.160
You're the inspiration.

08:15.987 --> 08:17.708
Good morning, everybody.

08:17.729 --> 08:19.010
Excuse me.

08:19.110 --> 08:20.090
Welcome to the show.

08:20.151 --> 08:25.215
That is indeed Chicago, the voice of Peter Cetera, among others.

08:26.256 --> 08:32.381
I'm not sure if at that time also was the drummer already that famous dude, too.

08:32.521 --> 08:35.083
And and like the Chicago is a really cool band.

08:36.633 --> 08:40.354
Good to see everybody.

08:41.214 --> 08:42.514
How not to say murder?

08:43.995 --> 08:49.556
Not to mention supplemental oxygen induces acute respiratory distress syndrome, step one.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.177
Step two, not to mention a lack of antibiotic use.

08:53.297 --> 08:57.798
Step three, do not mention the multi-year opioid crisis.

08:59.618 --> 09:02.799
Not explain PCR as a fraud.

09:02.839 --> 09:05.640
Do not mention injection versus ingestion.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.583
And do not mention the population pyramids of the West.

09:10.263 --> 09:14.867
Definitely, definitely do not mention Brandyvon.

09:23.305 --> 09:25.686
I'm really, really happy to be here.

09:26.407 --> 09:29.988
I do have this book of his and I did get it signed by him.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.249
That's a real picture there.

09:32.710 --> 09:37.672
This is a supporter of the stream, a good friend of mine, Jeff.

09:37.912 --> 09:38.533
Good to see you.

09:40.387 --> 09:48.173
Ladies and gentlemen, the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

09:48.253 --> 09:58.761
In fact, those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.

10:00.322 --> 10:05.927
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what to say other than you need to process this as a statement that someone made in 1924.

10:08.632 --> 10:16.339
And if you find yourself skillfully using social media in 2025, this is a message for you.

10:16.359 --> 10:20.603
You cannot escape if you think the truth is available there.

10:20.683 --> 10:25.387
It was never available on TV, and it is certainly not available there now.

10:25.427 --> 10:31.713
What you see in this slide, for example, are at least one, two, three,

10:32.634 --> 10:56.669
three insiders that are talking to somebody who likely doesn't understand that these three are coordinating their actions, their questions, their focus, and making him feel like he is speaking out and being heard, when in reality they are manipulating him to make sure that his opinions are used only in the way that this invisible

10:57.765 --> 10:59.766
government would like it to be used.

10:59.846 --> 11:07.191
There's also in this one probably one, maybe two, maybe only one person who knows better.

11:07.651 --> 11:14.055
And the rest of them are just not sophisticated enough to see that there are liars out there.

11:14.695 --> 11:25.122
Liars like probably David Baltimore, probably like Robert Malone, probably like Jessica Rose, probably like a lot of biologists that actually know.

11:25.922 --> 11:28.644
but none of these people that in front of us need to know.

11:29.705 --> 11:41.033
And when you see two actors on stage like this and accept the fact that they're asking the right questions and coming up with reasonable answers, you are already enslaved.

11:41.473 --> 11:44.175
And that's why I choose these two guys in particular.

11:44.795 --> 11:52.381
I think Steve Bannon has been wonderfully identified as somebody who is part of this little orchestrated theater.

11:53.222 --> 11:59.662
And I think his long track record IE resume would reveal that if anybody cared to see it.

12:04.465 --> 12:06.908
The voice you hear is the voice of Jonathan Cooey.

12:06.948 --> 12:10.071
I come to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

12:10.551 --> 12:12.894
I am the chief biologist of GigaOM Biological.

12:12.954 --> 12:18.700
I spent about, I don't know, more than 15 years chasing tenure as an academic biologist.

12:19.200 --> 12:25.767
You can find the work or the evidence of that work on the PubMed website of the National Library of Medicine.

12:26.828 --> 12:36.970
There's even some evidence of my early contributions to the Lab League Scooby-Doo Theater, of which I was an unwitting participant for almost three years.

12:37.910 --> 12:43.452
I have presented my thoughts and perspectives to the group PANDA no less than three times.

12:44.612 --> 12:49.753
Once to the National Citizens Inquiry in Canada, once to the trustees of the wellness company

12:50.753 --> 13:04.263
countless times behind the scenes to Children's Health Defense employees and staff, as well as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and that culminated in me being listed as an expert responsible for helping to write this Wuhan book.

13:05.464 --> 13:11.149
I was also able to present at G. Edward Griffin's Red Pill Conference last year,

13:12.169 --> 13:19.156
Perhaps that was one of the highlights of this very sort of macabre theater that I've been an unwitting participant in.

13:20.017 --> 13:30.928
I don't necessarily say that G. Edward Griffin is part of that theater, but I do think that a vast majority of the people that are in this are playing along.

13:31.568 --> 13:36.712
If you want to support this work, you can go to GigaOMBiological.com and I very much appreciate those that do.

13:37.212 --> 13:44.657
I just got an envelope from Rick in the Pennsylvania area, who I think is usually in the YouTube chat.

13:44.697 --> 13:45.718
Thank you very much, Rick.

13:46.698 --> 13:49.741
And also a letter from Jen this week.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.082
Thank you very much, Jen.

13:51.122 --> 13:57.366
You guys are both very generous and that will probably be spent at the local co-op this week.

13:59.227 --> 14:03.008
If you want to send anything directly to me, it's JJCooey at P.O.

14:03.048 --> 14:05.408
Box 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102.

14:06.488 --> 14:11.069
The stream is usually archived at stream.gigaohm.bio.

14:11.109 --> 14:15.490
Sometimes that's not a perfect connection, but you can download those videos and watch them offline.

14:16.270 --> 14:22.551
And you can communicate with me via email there or else via the open chat at gigaohm.bio.

14:22.631 --> 14:25.392
Thank you, Ted, for helping me keep those going.

14:30.847 --> 14:51.220
I don't care how you get there.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.941
I don't care what you do to get there.

14:55.842 --> 14:56.523
The goal is to win.

15:01.287 --> 15:02.642
What time is it?

15:02.682 --> 15:03.309
Game time!

15:33.496 --> 15:34.877
Good morning again, everybody.

15:34.897 --> 15:36.858
We are definitely at interesting times.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.019
People behaving in very interesting ways.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.320
You gotta watch for patterns.

15:41.021 --> 15:42.441
You gotta hold them to account.

15:42.481 --> 15:44.203
You gotta listen to the words they use.

15:44.283 --> 15:47.825
And more importantly, you gotta pay attention to the words they don't.

15:50.526 --> 15:52.327
They've been occupying a lot of our time.

15:52.347 --> 15:54.369
They've been occupying a lot of our thoughts.

15:55.210 --> 15:56.791
And it hasn't been useful for us.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.472
It hasn't been useful for our family.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.536
Because they're occupying our consciousness for the slavers.

16:03.576 --> 16:04.417
That's what they're doing.

16:05.317 --> 16:08.580
They've been teaching us slave speak for a couple generations now.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.222
Our parents taught us slave speak unwittingly.

16:12.062 --> 16:15.805
And right now we are not really worried about what's true anymore.

16:17.472 --> 16:19.632
governed by what is perceived to be true.

16:19.712 --> 16:23.873
That's what social media has allowed to become the method of governance.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.134
It's no longer just this illusion of fiat currency.

16:28.194 --> 16:31.075
It's now also the illusion of information.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.715
Nobody's reading the books.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.936
Nobody's taking responsibility for their own understanding.

16:36.756 --> 16:40.657
And that's why our history is in danger of being lost, being erased.

16:41.997 --> 16:44.878
I think that there are people, patriots, that are trying to

16:46.252 --> 16:50.474
archive that history and make sure we don't miss it as we drive by.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.596
One of my favorites, of course, is my friend in Boston, Mark Kulak.

16:55.656 --> 16:56.936
He is traveling home today.

16:57.457 --> 16:59.638
Hopefully we'll get a live stream from him tomorrow.

17:00.838 --> 17:03.939
There's a lot of good work being done by the Liberty Perspective on Rumble.

17:03.959 --> 17:05.020
There you can see the link.

17:06.441 --> 17:15.189
There's also a lot of good work being done by the father of Grace, Grace's dad, deprogramming with Grace's dad on Rumble.

17:16.090 --> 17:19.052
And I also have a couple substacks to recommend.

17:19.273 --> 17:21.415
One is from my friend in Germany.

17:21.915 --> 17:26.059
Mr. Altschner is on substack as Never Again is now global.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.902
And also a friend of mine named Ned who is an excellent artist.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.284
and produces a lot of work lately that's just really great.

17:35.125 --> 17:35.925
I love it a lot.

17:36.145 --> 17:41.447
And so please, that might be one of the ways that you can bring people to share this.

17:41.787 --> 17:43.108
Oh, I wanted to do that.

17:44.768 --> 17:48.310
I wonder how many people remember this song.

17:50.856 --> 17:53.719
It is, yeah, wow, it's crazy.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.263
The beginning of March is really when all this really started.

17:57.323 --> 18:06.153
I had just done one bike ride, maybe two, and it's been a long, long, long time.

18:18.052 --> 18:21.314
They are still creating the illusion of consensus.

18:21.414 --> 18:23.515
I could change that, you know, I mean, it really is.

18:23.575 --> 18:28.518
They are creating the illusion of consensus.

18:29.279 --> 18:30.639
They are definitely creating it.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.121
And this has been a plan for a while, right?

18:34.161 --> 18:36.483
This has been a plan for a while.

18:39.845 --> 18:46.649
Before they had anything they could justify as the means and methodologies to do it, it's already been a plan.

18:47.917 --> 18:53.180
And that's why the message of some of these messengers has been the same.

18:54.541 --> 19:00.104
They are allowing a very lively debate within a spectrum which reinforces the presuppositions of the system.

19:03.542 --> 19:10.969
And that goes so far as to making very beautiful computer graphics, which imply a level of fidelity of understanding that they don't have.

19:11.749 --> 19:20.457
That's what a lot of these computer-generated molecular cartoons do, is they make it seem like, oh, wow, we really understand stuff.

19:20.497 --> 19:28.044
And that's just a spectacular commitment to lies, in the same way that it is that all of these people that were involved in creating the

19:28.684 --> 19:42.149
illusion of worst case scenario also just seemed to ignore the fact that Sasha Latapova's daughter was on Alex Jones three times in 2019 and that she made videos about shooting the president.

19:43.790 --> 19:51.633
It's absurd to think that that girl behind there is connected directly to our Health and Human Services Secretary.

19:52.836 --> 19:59.938
It's absolutely absurd to think that these two people down here in the corner are connected directly to our Health and Human Services Secretary.

19:59.978 --> 20:06.620
This guy over here that now comes up in this video is also connected directly to our Health and Human Services Secretary.

20:07.041 --> 20:11.042
And he's happy to announce the potential end of the West.

20:12.179 --> 20:14.482
But ladies and gentlemen, it's not the end of the West.

20:14.522 --> 20:16.524
You don't have to be sad about it.

20:16.564 --> 20:18.286
It's just a natural phenomenon.

20:18.326 --> 20:28.699
It's an eclipse that was coming, that these coordinated liars are inverting into something else, into a loss of sovereignty because of public health.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.001
It is no different than murder and an eclipse.

20:33.121 --> 20:42.104
This is a anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that Kevin McKernan is standing in front of.

20:42.124 --> 20:44.205
It is an anticipated rise.

20:45.085 --> 20:46.106
Listen carefully.

20:46.226 --> 20:54.428
It is an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that Kevin McKernan is standing in front of and telling you it was a novel virus.

20:54.508 --> 20:55.709
Look at him right here.

20:58.052 --> 21:00.034
He's just committed.

21:00.674 --> 21:02.856
Spectacularly committed.

21:03.496 --> 21:11.922
That's all it takes to tweet one year ago that no one cares about Scooby-Doo's definition of a pandemic.

21:12.843 --> 21:16.726
People got sick and it correlated with various molecular tests.

21:17.687 --> 21:27.414
Scooby is Barrick's boy, paving the way for further gain of function to be funded by your taxes and deployed on you.

21:28.502 --> 21:37.048
If this isn't the biggest admission that this show was actively curated by him and people

21:38.394 --> 21:49.240
let's say, coordinated by him, that were queued up by him, even scripted by him, and Robert Malone and whoever else is involved.

21:49.440 --> 22:01.507
I'm not sure we know all the people who are involved, but I am sure that these people really, really, really, really, really, really need us to teach this to our children.

22:01.567 --> 22:02.608
That's what they really need.

22:03.908 --> 22:04.709
I'm just going to play it again.

22:08.484 --> 22:13.131
It's one of the most embarrassing things he's ever said in a long time.

22:13.151 --> 22:14.252
It definitely is.

22:14.372 --> 22:16.956
And it's the crazy part is that the internet doesn't forget.

22:16.976 --> 22:20.621
The emails are not ever going to disappear.

22:20.641 --> 22:22.424
The texts are never going to disappear.

22:23.533 --> 22:31.839
The videos are never gonna disappear and so we can justify a united non-compliance because of the nature of these people's own track record.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.621
We don't have to listen to them about bird flu.

22:34.641 --> 22:36.683
We don't have to listen to them about measles.

22:37.163 --> 22:38.124
It's not a thing.

22:39.929 --> 22:42.450
And I'm not telling you that measles is not a thing.

22:42.870 --> 22:45.471
I'm telling you that their stories are not a thing.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.212
Their drama is not a thing.

22:47.913 --> 22:53.075
Whatever smoke and mirrors they're making is probably based on some biology.

22:54.107 --> 23:03.175
But the bottom line is that all their smoke and fire and sparks and elaborate show was to make this picture possible.

23:03.996 --> 23:10.321
To make adults submit so that the kids' consent could be claimed.

23:10.802 --> 23:11.722
That's what it was about.

23:12.463 --> 23:22.166
That's why they don't want you to know the real history of the MMR shot in the UK and the role that Andrew Wakefield and Polly played in that.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.407
They don't want you to know that history.

23:24.907 --> 23:40.573
Otherwise, you might know that some of these people are responsible for them being brought to the United States and recycled to pull the same political scam that they pulled in the UK just a few years before.

23:43.308 --> 23:49.730
But I think this time could be different because I think these people are more exposed than they ever imagined they would be.

23:50.270 --> 24:04.553
I think a lot of these people thought that they were in a two-year plan, a two-year orchestration, a two-year operation, and then they would be, you know, able to go back to doing their own thing, whatever that was, fly fishing or surfing.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.774
But they're on year six.

24:08.163 --> 24:10.748
And year six is not gonna be fun, ladies and gentlemen.

24:10.788 --> 24:14.917
If I have anything to say about it, year six is not gonna be fun for a lot of these people.

24:15.902 --> 24:38.184
least I have hope that it's not gonna be fun for them anymore because it shouldn't be it shouldn't be fun to cover up for murder and the truth of this biology is coming there's not gonna be any avoiding it anymore it was already coming before they probably dispensed with with Brandy Vaughn and now the big fish is gonna eat the little fish that's for sure

24:39.105 --> 24:41.426
It's time to begin with the truth, ladies and gentlemen.

24:41.466 --> 24:51.690
We are starting with the truth at Gigahome Biological, where intramuscular injection is probably dumb, where transfection in healthy people was definitely a crime, and where RNA cannot pandemic.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.330
Year six.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.711
They thought it would be quick.

24:54.931 --> 24:55.291
Ha ha!

24:55.991 --> 24:59.412
I'm sorry, but the truth is catching up fast now, ladies and gentlemen.

25:00.193 --> 25:03.454
And before you know it, the U.S.

25:03.754 --> 25:07.576
vaccine schedule will be exposed as the criminal enterprise that it is.

25:07.596 --> 25:12.197
And even foreign governments that weren't aware of it will become aware of it.

25:14.738 --> 25:15.579
Hey, look at that.

25:15.659 --> 25:18.320
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.

25:18.420 --> 25:18.600
Cut.

25:19.713 --> 25:19.953
get it?

25:19.993 --> 25:20.213
Yes.

25:20.433 --> 25:21.734
Hello, welcome to the show.

25:21.754 --> 25:26.776
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

25:27.396 --> 25:28.577
My name is Jonathan Cui.

25:29.457 --> 25:30.417
Let me test this quick.

25:31.838 --> 25:33.199
No, that didn't work.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.019
What was that?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.060
I have no response.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.221
No, that's not working.

25:38.261 --> 25:40.442
See, that's exactly what I was testing.

25:46.704 --> 26:07.922
not queuing up i'm just gonna click this out once quick and click this back in just pardon me for a second um it is march 4th 2025 it is the sixth year of this pandemic theater and you may be mistaken if you think that the pandemic theater is over because there is a good chunk of american

26:08.883 --> 26:10.224
you know, active.

26:10.544 --> 26:11.465
That's the point here.

26:11.525 --> 26:16.969
So how can I start this show in a way that will try to give the same message in a different way?

26:19.010 --> 26:31.038
American politics and politics at the national level in a lot of these Western nations at this time is now based on what can be more seen as herding cats.

26:31.138 --> 26:37.883
Now, if you look at a country like the Netherlands, what you're going to see, let me just test this quick.

26:40.827 --> 26:41.828
I have no reason.

26:41.868 --> 26:48.515
I don't know why it won't queue up.

26:49.215 --> 26:50.516
I don't know why it's not queuing up.

26:50.556 --> 26:51.337
That's so weird.

27:01.406 --> 27:03.088
Anyway, I guess I don't need a buzzer today.

27:04.668 --> 27:11.413
If you look at the Netherlands, one of the ways that their populace is fragmented is that they just have a lot of political parties.

27:11.473 --> 27:12.694
Germany does the same thing.

27:12.734 --> 27:23.221
And so these political parties can have one thing that they focus on, and that allows the populace to have a sufficient fractionization so that any

27:25.288 --> 27:31.870
any sort of coming together at the top can be easily governed by the people who do the theater of coming together.

27:31.930 --> 27:45.374
Now, I think in the Netherlands they must be aware that more or less this is what happens because of the way that they've been played, that now their former prime minister, who is just a scoundrel, is the head of NATO.

27:48.255 --> 27:57.718
It's just so hard for me to believe that a lot of these countries, even Germany, can be so bamboozled by this false reality that is only present on social media.

27:58.318 --> 28:09.121
And in America, we are not aware of, and I have only recently become aware of, the fact that the anti-vaccine movement in America has been hijacked

28:09.981 --> 28:27.307
as a political movement and turned into a sort of health, freedom, populist movement, not that dissimilar to what they did with the Tea Party or the whatever those people were called in 08 and what they do with the people on where they were camping out for Wall Street.

28:27.947 --> 28:32.429
These little political movements just need to be co-opted.

28:33.009 --> 28:38.171
And so they infiltrate, they get on the back of with, you know, with

28:40.938 --> 28:49.342
planted non-profit organizations in which there are saboteurs, and then you just kind of co-opt the whole movement.

28:49.882 --> 29:02.309
And so this is done quite regularly, and we have to understand, as Edward Bernays and Noam Chomsky and lots of other people would agree, historically this is how it's always been done.

29:03.447 --> 29:13.411
It's just that with social media, we, I think, need to be brought to understand how malevolent it can be done on social media.

29:13.431 --> 29:28.136
Because if in the 1980s, in order to control a guy like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you needed to own a television station, and several of the people that worked there, and also the anchors, and everybody had to be in on it.

29:28.596 --> 29:31.358
in order to fool Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:31.398 --> 29:41.983
into thinking that he was on a real talk show answering real questions and responding to real things, when in reality it was all a scripted thing to make him look like this or look like that.

29:42.904 --> 29:50.087
That's how I imagined things would be done in the 80s when you just had TV and radio and magazines.

29:50.368 --> 29:50.868
You had to

29:52.142 --> 29:56.245
you had to move more stones around in order for people to go, hey, what's going on over here?

29:56.806 --> 30:11.258
On social media, because the stones are all imaginary, and because the stones on my phone can be rearranged separately from the stones on your phone, you can manipulate people in a way that was never possible before.

30:12.078 --> 30:19.805
And so I can scroll on my phone and imagine that I'm seeing an illusion of consensus that you cannot see

30:20.629 --> 30:31.200
by definition because you follow different people and the illusion of consensus that you see is as compelling as the one that I see, even if it is the polar opposite of it.

30:32.782 --> 30:35.485
And you might think of this as being very

30:37.597 --> 31:03.969
very mundane uh from the perspective of a sports uh team where because i follow the chicago cubs then i'm the one who gets all the chicago cubs stuff and i think the whole world is always arguing about the chicago cubs and somebody in st louis um who likes the st louis cardinals is thinking the exact same thing about the st louis cardinals except the st louis cardinals are winning and the cubs aren't and so in some ways one guy's more right than the other but

31:05.249 --> 31:14.912
it's an illusion, right, that's created in our minds by the convenience of our choices and the algorithm and the personalized representation of reality.

31:14.952 --> 31:25.596
But if you start to understand that that exact same algorithmic precision can be applied to misleading you about things, and then more importantly, the

31:26.934 --> 31:38.039
that the more compartments there are, i.e., the example being America or the Netherlands, the Netherlands is a harder illusion to see through.

31:38.799 --> 31:46.703
Because in the Netherlands, they still imagine that their multi-party thing is not infiltrated enough to essentially be fake.

31:47.183 --> 31:55.147
Whereas in America, a lot of people are willing to accept the idea that, well, I mean, they're both just parties of the corporate powers or the rich people or whatever.

31:56.636 --> 31:58.037
That's easier to believe.

31:58.818 --> 32:12.169
And so America, in a lot of ways, needs to have this overlaying media landscape so that people can be fragmented in a significant enough way so that they can still be controlled.

32:12.229 --> 32:19.435
And I think one of the best examples of this that's become very visible in the last two years is the use

32:20.336 --> 32:32.641
of the concept of health freedom, the concept of vaccine hesitancy, and the hijacking of it by our ruling powers, just like they hijack anything else.

32:33.321 --> 32:49.608
Hijack the opinions about what's happening in the Middle East, hijack the opinions about what's happening in Africa, hijack the opinions about what's happening with climate change, hijack the opinions about what's happening with the pole shift, and play games about all of that on social media, because again,

32:50.896 --> 33:03.696
Each of our perception of reality, if we use social media, can be manipulated separately, independently, even though we are not using social media with that in mind.

33:04.940 --> 33:11.042
It's like if you looked out the window and assumed that everybody saw your backyard, that would be a really weird assumption, right?

33:11.082 --> 33:21.844
But what I'm suggesting to you is, is that your children and people that use social media skillfully are looking out their back window and assuming that everybody sees the same backyard.

33:22.344 --> 33:25.485
And that's not what social media does at all, okay?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.066
That's message one.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.106
I hope I'm not...

33:29.229 --> 33:31.950
Hope I didn't mean to beat that up there too badly.

33:31.970 --> 33:36.492
It is March, March 4th, 2025.

33:37.152 --> 33:44.755
And I'm just trying to, again, be repetitive as I possibly can with a message of hope that is not for everyone, but it is for anyone.

33:45.235 --> 33:49.797
And part of the, the heart of that message is we got to get off of regular social media.

33:50.970 --> 33:56.094
Now, it may not be that you choose to join our soapbox, but there's a lot of Mastodon servers.

33:56.115 --> 33:57.796
They're all federated.

33:58.176 --> 33:59.137
They're all separate.

34:00.018 --> 34:08.946
And so you can get your message out in lots of ways that has nothing to do with, and then you need to seek more and find more.

34:09.586 --> 34:24.018
but it will be sources that you trust and evaluate on a regular basis based on their behavior, rather than allowing some mechanism of randomness, which is not random, to provide thoughts that you entertain during the day.

34:25.139 --> 34:28.562
We must get our children off of social media.

34:29.522 --> 34:32.966
And the way to do that is to set the example of not being on it ourselves.

34:33.507 --> 34:39.334
We can't have it be a part of us unless it's a website that we ourselves create.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.057
That's really how I think it should be.

34:42.097 --> 34:44.600
It's more like MySpace in a way, but not really.

34:44.620 --> 34:48.866
You should never need to sign into anybody's website, that kind of thing.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.080
But we're not here to talk about that.

34:51.120 --> 35:01.083
I'm just, but the message of hope starts there because if you start interacting with the internet in that way, it will fundamentally change its effect on you.

35:02.103 --> 35:14.588
And a lot of us right now, I think grossly underestimate how much of our day is ruined or wasted or polluted by our skillful use of social media.

35:14.628 --> 35:15.748
And that's myself included.

35:18.092 --> 35:20.615
And it's for all the marbles, it's for the grandchildren of earth.

35:20.655 --> 35:25.920
And that's why I say we have to get our kids off of social media by getting ourselves off of social media.

35:26.440 --> 35:30.164
Maybe even reestablishing this idea that everybody should have their own website.

35:30.985 --> 35:32.646
Because in the end, that's what you want.

35:33.907 --> 35:34.848
you really want that.

35:35.128 --> 35:49.738
And so encouraging people to have soapbox instances that they connect to ours, encouraging people to have PeerTube channels or PeerTube instances that they connect to ours and that we can mirror on theirs.

35:50.338 --> 35:56.943
This is how we strengthen our own network so that what they have to do is delete us from these servers rather than

35:58.063 --> 36:07.007
You know, just simply make it so that only if your followers scrolls for an hour and a half do they finally see one of your posts, which is what it is right now.

36:10.549 --> 36:17.132
And so the concept that I want to get in today, which I'm not sure, did I set that up right?

36:17.192 --> 36:18.412
Let me just check this quick.

36:20.173 --> 36:21.454
That one is there.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.754
This one is not up, I bet.

36:25.265 --> 36:26.646
Let me just check these two things.

36:26.746 --> 36:44.874
The thing that I want to do today, and this might switch over something, but that's okay, I can fix that quick, is what I would like to do today is talk about how franchise players are riding the bench in this game and what that really means to me.

36:46.060 --> 36:53.665
So first of all, you kind of have to know what a franchise player is and that's gonna switch that yes Do that and this one.

36:53.705 --> 37:12.237
I want to be a Look who snuck up behind me So a franchise player is a guy like Michael Jordan a franchise player is like the guy who just got traded to the the Lakers I

37:15.963 --> 37:16.804
from the Mavericks.

37:20.567 --> 37:20.907
Luka.

37:21.888 --> 37:22.569
Luka Doncic.

37:23.850 --> 37:28.754
And the idea is that a franchise player is somebody that you build a team around.

37:30.475 --> 37:41.124
And one of the things to see with respect to how these organizations work is that when franchise players are found, they ride the bench.

37:42.205 --> 37:44.447
So one example might actually be

37:49.212 --> 37:49.813
Brian Hooker.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.094
Sorry, I was drawing a blank there.

37:51.114 --> 37:51.875
I could see his face.

37:51.935 --> 37:52.695
I couldn't say his name.

37:53.756 --> 38:06.508
Brian Hooker is a guy who's been at Children's Health Defense for a long time, is famous for a story about driving across the United States to take the testimony of someone from the CDC, and apparently knows that at least that data reveals that

38:07.449 --> 38:13.377
young black male children have an extra vulnerability to some vaccine schedule thing, I don't know what.

38:14.278 --> 38:22.569
But the point is, is that that guy also has a book that they very rarely sell that only came out in 2023 called Vax Unvax.

38:22.649 --> 38:22.769
Now,

38:23.630 --> 38:30.552
keeping in mind that he probably worked for them for quite some time, and that they also had this guy, Paul Thomas.

38:31.272 --> 38:53.079
It's just very strange how, rather than coming out with a very strong message from the start, with some fundamental biology that maybe they heard from somebody like Brandy Vaughn, or from Brian Hooker, or from Pauly Tommy, they are very consistently promoting other people, because again, franchise players ride the bench.

38:55.424 --> 38:58.185
And I think that it's really very simple.

38:58.225 --> 39:13.908
If you have somebody like Brandy Vaughn with the credentials that Brandy Vaughn has, and the charisma on stage that Brandy Vaughn has, and the razor sharp language that Brandy Vaughn has, then you don't stand in front of her and use other language and speak longer.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.929
You don't get in her way.

39:18.249 --> 39:19.049
You promote her.

39:21.462 --> 39:26.604
You say, I really like the way she says it because it is the way it should be said.

39:27.004 --> 39:30.145
If you don't believe that, then you get in front of her.

39:31.846 --> 39:40.769
If it's your job to make sure that people don't hear her, then you get in front of her and you say other things when somebody is saying it more cleverly than you.

39:41.269 --> 39:46.751
Imagine a scenario where you draft Michael Jordan, but then leave him on the bench.

39:48.809 --> 39:52.551
Only bring him in every once in a while for people to see, wow, that was a great dunk.

39:52.591 --> 39:53.371
Oh, nevermind him.

39:53.651 --> 39:55.693
He's also good, but that's cool.

39:58.974 --> 40:02.616
Imagine that because essentially that's what you have with Brandy Vaughn.

40:02.656 --> 40:06.798
That's what you have with, unfortunately, somebody like me.

40:06.898 --> 40:13.782
I'm not trying to be overly focused on myself, but it's a story that I feel really rings true.

40:15.078 --> 40:22.840
I was hired by CHD and used for nothing public, used for nothing internal.

40:24.341 --> 40:31.302
No teaching of biology anywhere, no making of a curriculum anywhere, no making of a fact sheet anywhere.

40:33.303 --> 40:43.926
They used me in the most ridiculous way possible, behind the scenes, trying to put together a database of something from medical records.

40:45.598 --> 40:46.678
I mean, think about that.

40:47.619 --> 41:02.045
Think about how much they paid me over $100,000 a year equivalent salary per month, which was like almost $8,000 a month to do that and to be on a Zoom meeting a couple hours a week.

41:03.586 --> 41:13.070
It's an extraordinary, ridiculous scenario that I was in, where I was just absolutely breathless with the idea that, wait, really, this is all?

41:14.104 --> 41:15.746
We're gonna have a meeting next week again?

41:15.766 --> 41:17.428
That's it?

41:18.349 --> 41:19.991
I have to figure out a database?

41:20.811 --> 41:22.113
And then I'm supposed to do what?

41:26.097 --> 41:30.002
That's really what they did with me and how much they paid me.

41:31.143 --> 41:35.748
And I am able to say that because I didn't sign the NDA that I was offered when I was fired.

41:38.168 --> 41:45.272
I think there are a lot of other people who probably can't talk because for whatever reason they were not able to say no to an NDA.

41:47.053 --> 41:48.814
Maybe they were offered much more money than me.

41:50.655 --> 41:52.816
But this is really about the grandchildren of earth.

41:52.856 --> 41:55.938
So at this point in time, there's no more punches pulled here.

41:55.958 --> 42:03.182
We're not going to stop talking about this because it is the American history that needs recording.

42:04.414 --> 42:26.883
because somewhere in here, the legitimate objection to intramuscular injection was substituted for by a Andrew Wakefield recycled theater that had already been used to its fullest in the UK a few years before and then restarted and recycled in America.

42:27.383 --> 42:33.566
And it has culminated with Andrew Wakefield currently being kind of a hero amongst this populist movement

42:34.326 --> 42:44.589
At the top of which are people like Bannon and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I think they really wanted to be vice president and not health and human services secretary.

42:44.629 --> 42:47.570
That's the extraordinary place that we are right now.

42:50.271 --> 42:53.152
I hear a door opening or I don't know if that's a door opening or what.

42:53.272 --> 42:53.512
Anyway.

42:55.640 --> 43:10.952
Okay, so I am being very serious when I say that franchise players ride the bench, because again, there's no explanation for why CHD was founded and then didn't use Brandy as like a chief scientific officer.

43:14.415 --> 43:15.796
I mean, what are we talking about here?

43:16.717 --> 43:25.264
CHD goes from being the World Mercury Project in 2018 to Children's Health Defense, and then who did they hire, Mary Holland?

43:29.500 --> 43:34.443
Who's a whistleblower about a component of the MMR that heard her kid years before?

43:35.904 --> 43:39.007
That she didn't really speak out about when it actually happened?

43:41.028 --> 43:42.569
I mean, what are we talking about here?

43:43.250 --> 43:44.571
How obvious can it be?

43:46.992 --> 43:53.197
ICANN was founded in 2016 after the making of the movie Vaxxed and ICANN what?

43:55.518 --> 43:57.920
They just decided to ignore the language of Brandy?

44:02.079 --> 44:15.448
It's been a long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen, because I've really, I've had to go through the same, the same hard truths that Brandy probably had to learn as she believed every one of these people was a hero and then found out otherwise.

44:16.369 --> 44:19.831
Individual by individual betrayal.

44:20.832 --> 44:23.473
Individual by individual betrayal.

44:24.974 --> 44:28.036
And when I show this picture, I'm not proud.

44:30.658 --> 44:31.759
I think it's awful.

44:34.236 --> 44:41.684
I think I sometimes I'm, I'm, I'm just shocked that this is all I've got.

44:43.826 --> 44:52.315
All I've got at this point is my own experience to validate the fact that I'm taking up a fight that no one else apparently will take up.

44:54.426 --> 45:22.035
It's only my experience with Jay Bhattacharya, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Veer Sharma, and Kevin McCairn, and Pierre Corey, and Ryan Cole, and Robert Malone, and Paul Alexander, and Asim Malhotra, and it's only because of my experience with these people that I have the gumption

45:23.476 --> 45:29.279
to stand up for the idea that the United States vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

45:30.780 --> 45:36.943
And that I think even that guy was recruited specifically to sort of meddle with me.

45:37.203 --> 45:41.326
Otherwise, him being involved with the rest of these people makes no sense at all.

45:41.746 --> 45:52.952
And yet, like a month ago, he was on Steve Kirsch's podcast with the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, Kevin McKernan.

45:54.051 --> 46:02.375
After all these years, they finally came together, no less on Steve Kirsch's own Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.

46:02.415 --> 46:02.956
You know why?

46:03.416 --> 46:06.978
Because the American vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

46:10.319 --> 46:17.583
And these people have been working for five years to make sure that America never comes to that conclusion until it's the right time to demolish her.

46:18.063 --> 46:19.164
That's what this is about.

46:19.969 --> 46:29.053
until all the other aspects of American society and its system have been destroyed or discredited.

46:29.073 --> 46:35.877
And it makes me very sad because most of these people are unwitting participants.

46:35.957 --> 46:44.461
Most of these people have to be unwitting participants and just not aware of the fact that if you just look at the graph, you can see it's murder.

46:46.084 --> 46:57.812
There's no way to explain how we lost control of pneumonia the way that it shows in this bright red graph, except to show that there's no other explanation for this right here.

46:58.472 --> 47:06.678
This is a two year loss of control of something that can otherwise be controlled by antibiotics.

47:08.199 --> 47:10.761
Because pneumonia is bacterial.

47:12.714 --> 47:16.055
just like urinary tract infections are bacterial.

47:16.795 --> 47:40.024
But if people are treated as though they have a viral syndrome, and therefore antibiotics are inappropriate, which is something that somebody has said often, many people have said often in 2020 and 2021 during the time when this murder was going on, then the application of pure oxygen

47:41.448 --> 47:49.872
coupled with the idea that a viral syndrome cannot be treated by antibiotics could easily explain how we lost control.

47:53.134 --> 48:08.022
Nobody's ever gonna talk about that though because these over-class people have placed highly trained acolytes in positions of influence using the military social control programs called social media

48:09.795 --> 48:13.138
so that we ask the wrong questions and come to the wrong conclusions.

48:13.198 --> 48:16.281
And they made us figure out a mystery about a virus.

48:17.261 --> 48:24.628
And that's why all of these people are united in never telling you that PCR is actually a fraud as a diagnostic tool.

48:25.769 --> 48:28.431
That's because the background is so impossibly hot.

48:29.011 --> 48:31.894
There's no way to use it as a diagnostic tool.

48:33.985 --> 48:37.726
not the way that it's employed in viral diagnostics.

48:38.207 --> 48:40.327
Pure oxygen causes ARDS.

48:40.367 --> 48:44.149
This is just something that any MD should be able to wake up to.

48:44.269 --> 48:52.632
And the idea that any MD listens to this video and doesn't pause it right here and go to PubMed and start reading and going, oh my gosh.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.041
Well, we have to answer a question.

48:55.121 --> 49:00.485
How many people were given pure oxygen when they came to the hospital in 2020 and 2021?

49:00.565 --> 49:08.010
Because I've just found a whole pile of papers that shows that pure oxygen is really awful for people.

49:09.171 --> 49:11.233
And I didn't know that because I don't work in the ICU.

49:13.783 --> 49:22.789
There should be hundreds of doctors a day potentially coming to this realization with just a very simple critical thought going through their head.

49:22.829 --> 49:24.370
Wow, I don't know if he's right about that.

49:24.430 --> 49:30.754
And then they could go to the internet and find out that there are textbook chapters about this.

49:34.497 --> 49:36.978
And there are also videos of Pierre Kory.

49:38.520 --> 49:43.463
Videos of nightly news showing oxygen tanks being pushed

49:44.591 --> 49:48.233
from the ship Comfort that was brought to New York City.

49:48.314 --> 49:48.594
Why?

49:48.674 --> 49:50.295
Because it had an oxygen plant.

49:51.215 --> 49:54.298
And they were running out of oxygen, says Kyle Seidel.

49:55.699 --> 49:57.300
Says Nurse Erin.

50:00.402 --> 50:04.184
Not using antibiotics for the pneumonia that they themselves created is a crime.

50:04.464 --> 50:05.305
It's called murder.

50:07.967 --> 50:12.510
And that's why we have people who you can say it on the internet and no one's gonna see it.

50:13.860 --> 50:18.844
I've said it correctly a thousand times and everybody sees them.

50:19.905 --> 50:23.448
That's the way it will always be because social media is their tool.

50:23.628 --> 50:27.471
It's not the town square, it's their tool.

50:30.013 --> 50:35.898
And these people have used it to create a new kind of governance.

50:35.938 --> 50:40.261
They're taking some power away from the traditional sources of this power.

50:40.882 --> 50:42.863
The newspapers, the magazines,

50:43.720 --> 50:45.461
the network television.

50:46.141 --> 50:47.682
They're taking it away from them.

50:49.964 --> 50:58.369
And so you're seeing some friction and some resistance and some changing as people change alliances, as people realize that the power is shifting.

51:01.553 --> 51:03.834
And one of those characters is Elon Musk.

51:03.854 --> 51:06.275
He's just a character, but he represents something.

51:06.315 --> 51:21.481
You can use him as a landmark to see what's happening here, because his rise to power partially has to do with the influence that X can have, that Telegram can have, even if it's only a perceived level of influence.

51:24.997 --> 51:27.940
And this has all been accomplished by team worst case scenario.

51:27.980 --> 51:43.134
These are the people that stand in front of the real heroes, the real truth tellers, the real investigative reporters, the real journalists are all stood in front of by people who are pretending to be those people.

51:44.215 --> 51:49.080
Oh, I just happened to have a press pass to the White House and you just happened to not be able to get one.

51:50.205 --> 51:54.912
Oh, I just happen to have a lot of followers on Twitter and you just happen to not.

51:57.196 --> 52:00.681
I just happen to have 180,000 followers on YouTube.

52:01.102 --> 52:03.085
I'm still just as naughty as you are.

52:03.976 --> 52:05.337
And that's not how this works.

52:05.397 --> 52:09.540
The slavers make it feel like that because social media is their tool.

52:10.040 --> 52:15.264
And Team Worst Case Scenario is who I believe we need to blame for our own predicament.

52:15.424 --> 52:29.615
If you are following Alex Jones, and you are following Brett Weinstein, and you're following Chris Martinson, or you're following Jordan Peterson, or you're following some of these other people that are at the heads of these organizations, then you are enslaved.

52:30.967 --> 52:36.211
because you're engaged in a limited spectrum of debate that reinforces all the presuppositions of the state.

52:36.691 --> 52:43.436
That's why today and yesterday people have finally become kind of surprised that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:43.456 --> 52:46.058
is not standing up to the measles vaccine after all.

52:47.599 --> 52:57.647
Yet Mary Holland was against the measles vaccine or some component of it since I guess 2015 when she was first on Democracy Now opposite Paul Offit.

52:59.949 --> 53:02.950
It's always been about measles for these people.

53:03.270 --> 53:06.791
That's why Robert Malone was, I mean, sorry, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:06.831 --> 53:14.413
was featured in a Rolling Stone Magazine and Salon Magazine article all those years ago about measles.

53:15.753 --> 53:24.656
Because we are still in the show, even if it's been altered, even if it's been adjusted, the script has been adjusted, the script is still obvious.

53:24.736 --> 53:27.497
It's obvious that they make all of these

53:28.587 --> 53:38.798
Ridiculous organizations full of saboteurs, funded saboteurs that can afford all the airfare in the hotels that Brandy never could.

53:41.041 --> 53:45.325
That Mark can't afford, that I can't afford, that a lot of these people can't afford.

53:45.405 --> 53:50.391
And that's why there are all these gatherings at all these places all on the same weekends.

53:51.869 --> 53:59.292
because it's not about organizing a resistance useful in getting America's grandchildren free.

53:59.412 --> 54:03.674
It's about fragmenting a resistance to make sure that nothing actually happens.

54:05.055 --> 54:07.216
And it has been that way for a long time.

54:11.598 --> 54:15.199
And so this guy who declared the lab leak in January of 2020 is responsible.

54:17.386 --> 54:28.712
Just like this guy who is just connected to this for decades is responsible for creating the illusion of a health freedom movement.

54:29.092 --> 54:39.477
This guy who's connected by father to that guy's father, and they're both connected to the foundational forming of the FDA, he's not here by accident.

54:41.138 --> 54:46.461
These people all don't think of themselves as intellectual property experts by accident.

54:48.134 --> 54:55.721
They are there for some reason that is not in the best interest of our grandchildren in America.

54:55.801 --> 54:56.602
I'm sure of it.

54:57.923 --> 55:03.129
Other than that, this is a crime scene and we have to see these people for who they are.

55:03.189 --> 55:05.451
They are traitors to America's grandkids.

55:06.027 --> 55:13.249
And they created and are creating ongoing the illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

55:13.749 --> 55:20.890
At any moment in time, one of these people could stand up and say, how did it also all of a sudden become about the MMR shot?

55:25.752 --> 55:29.572
This is about something bigger, but they're not gonna do that.

55:30.773 --> 55:31.833
And it's not political.

55:32.987 --> 55:36.409
It's because they are sabotaging our grandchildren's future.

55:37.309 --> 55:52.956
And there is evidence in their track record in the last five years, their behavior, their world travel, and the coinkydinks, you know, the happy little accidents of them all being in Romania, and then months later, all being in front of the Senate saying the same shit.

55:55.637 --> 55:57.098
It is the manipulation.

55:59.392 --> 56:03.113
the organized habits and opinions of the masses, the masses being us.

56:04.513 --> 56:14.856
And if they have to, even people that are really, really fighting can be easily absorbed into this lively debate within that limited spectrum.

56:15.816 --> 56:18.417
Some of them wittingly, some of them unwittingly.

56:19.477 --> 56:25.199
And if those two ways don't work, then they just ignore you like they ignored Brandy and they ignore me.

56:28.857 --> 56:35.099
Now, I am not at the stage of courage where Brandy was who put up billboards with her own money.

56:37.159 --> 56:43.581
And I'm trying very hard to find ways to get to the stage where maybe I could act like that.

56:44.521 --> 56:49.582
And action is what I think is necessary for us to make progress against this illusion.

56:50.462 --> 56:55.924
I think action is what is necessary in order for us to

56:57.662 --> 57:04.587
get past this illusion, where the better your message is, the less likely people will hear it.

57:05.788 --> 57:13.954
And the more that you point out that these people don't grow in their messaging, they don't progress in their messaging, they don't get sharper in their messaging.

57:14.454 --> 57:26.003
And the more you point out that they've been on the same wheel for so long, that the idea that in 2025, we're about to have a discussion about adjuvants is absurd.

57:28.035 --> 57:31.476
The idea that we're having a discussion about measles is absurd.

57:34.657 --> 57:50.362
It's almost like it was scripted to hide something else, you know, like an anticipated rise in expected deaths, like an eclipse, and used it to convince our grandchildren of something that never happened.

58:04.600 --> 58:08.602
So if you're not aware, Gigome Biological is supported only by viewers like you.

58:08.622 --> 58:09.642
I have no sponsors.

58:10.162 --> 58:13.663
I've got a couple very generous supporters.

58:14.684 --> 58:16.204
I'm gonna switch over here really quick.

58:16.844 --> 58:18.685
Hey little buddy, how are you?

58:19.901 --> 58:23.145
If you don't know who this is, this is little Mike.

58:23.785 --> 58:24.966
He's now six months old.

58:26.748 --> 58:27.449
He's a good boy.

58:28.931 --> 58:32.014
He had an accident the last couple days, which is a little lame.

58:32.054 --> 58:33.455
But other than that, he's a good boy.

58:33.476 --> 58:35.077
He barks a lot.

58:36.319 --> 58:38.381
He's a good boy.

58:40.377 --> 58:46.262
We're very happy that he's such a sweetheart, but he's not as big as I want him yet I think he's only about 50 pounds.

58:46.862 --> 58:49.424
I'm hoping for about 220 pounds.

58:49.524 --> 58:59.032
I don't know if we're gonna get that But he's a good boy You don't want to come up here and say I know okay.

59:00.213 --> 59:01.694
No you don't want to come up here.

59:01.714 --> 59:01.754
Oh

59:02.955 --> 59:04.175
I can't tell how big he is.

59:04.595 --> 59:06.756
He looks the same every time I get up in the morning.

59:06.796 --> 59:08.056
I'm like, dude, please grow.

59:08.076 --> 59:11.938
Um, but anyway, uh, thanks Kira.

59:13.218 --> 59:14.878
Um, I'll switch back over here.

59:14.978 --> 59:15.899
I think I can do this.

59:15.999 --> 59:17.219
No, that's not the right one.

59:17.439 --> 59:17.759
This one.

59:18.439 --> 59:18.659
Yes.

59:20.240 --> 59:20.380
Um,

59:23.729 --> 59:26.490
So the timeline I think is always really important.

59:26.550 --> 59:29.951
I got to adjust this a little bit to make 2025 have a little more room now.

59:31.791 --> 59:37.173
I really think it is vital to keep repeating this, especially for college kids.

59:38.873 --> 59:40.534
I think as an older adult, I'm 53.

59:42.514 --> 59:53.498
I think it's harder for us to remember how little perspective we had as, let's say, a 22-year-old or a 21-year-old.

59:54.038 --> 01:00:05.542
And so a lot of these kids that we left in the lurch in 2020 and 2021 and just allowed them to go back to college and absorb whatever bullshit the college had to throw at them,

01:00:08.115 --> 01:00:12.538
Those kids don't have a really good perspective on what actually happened here.

01:00:12.578 --> 01:00:20.984
And the idea that all of these people could have been in place, could have been like been put in place while they were in high school.

01:00:21.464 --> 01:00:25.867
So that when they got to college, all these people who were speaking out were actually just actors.

01:00:26.347 --> 01:00:33.892
It's a lot harder for a 20 year old kid to see that than somebody who's 53, nevermind somebody who's 60.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:42.133
who I think at that stage, once you have that time horizon, you can start to see these patterns in a very different way.

01:00:42.853 --> 01:00:54.919
And since I have been seeing some, but not all of this behavior for a long time, when the pandemic hit, I was already not checked in.

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:57.940
And I just joined Twitter because somebody told me to.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:00:59.841
Think about that.

01:01:00.861 --> 01:01:04.083
I was just on YouTube and somebody told me to join Twitter.

01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:12.454
So that's really the extent to which this whole narrative can be orchestrated.

01:01:12.474 --> 01:01:15.536
It's just a simple acquiescence to social media.

01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:18.197
And that's what a lot of these people also did.

01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:21.639
Convinced us that, you know, on Twitter was where the truth is.

01:01:21.699 --> 01:01:25.262
And you can actually, you don't have to do too much work.

01:01:25.302 --> 01:01:28.624
If you just take that group of people that I show you

01:01:29.484 --> 01:01:51.140
and you take them and you look at what they were doing and what they were saying, you're going to find that it goes back years and years that people are put in place and part of this theater where they're determining what questions we're debating and they're occupying this sort of extreme end of that or extreme end of this that we all accept the middle of.

01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:57.358
And so I've tried to give you lots of examples, you know, not the more obvious one.

01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:58.599
This is an interesting.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.223
So tell us what RFK.

01:02:02.624 --> 01:02:09.271
What I'd like to try to do here, though, is really illustrate how I think spectacularly scripted this is.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:12.675
So what you have here is a very recent

01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:20.264
It is a very recent TWIV episode for the substack of Paul Offit.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:30.408
Remember, Paul Offit was on Democracy Now with Mary Holland already in 2015, around the same year that Brandi was really gaining traction, starting to put her billboards up.

01:02:31.669 --> 01:02:38.312
And a couple years later, she would have billboards in like eight states, like 30 billboards in eight states.

01:02:39.573 --> 01:02:45.757
Anyway, what does he talk about on this podcast in February 2025?

01:02:45.837 --> 01:02:50.101
Remember, just to recall, I showed you this yesterday, but this is just to recall.

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.703
He doesn't believe in that explains a lot of his positions.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.025
So what he holds.

01:02:58.967 --> 01:02:59.468
But he won't.

01:02:59.948 --> 01:03:00.148
So.

01:03:01.249 --> 01:03:03.491
Tell us what RFK Jr.

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:06.313
doesn't believe in that explains a lot of his positions.

01:03:07.597 --> 01:03:11.640
So what he holds tightly to is the miasma theory.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:15.443
And you can read about this in his book, The Real Anthony Fauci.

01:03:15.823 --> 01:03:18.685
Now, he sells Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:03:18.645 --> 01:03:28.192
's book as an example of the, let's say, chicanery of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that he believes in the miasma theory.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:35.317
Now, what I find interesting, personally, from my own experience in this timeline, is that this debate

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:44.417
about the germ theory and whether the germ theory is true or not was seeded as fundamental

01:03:46.519 --> 01:04:11.566
by a number of very conspicuous players early in my own story, including Kevin McCairn in Japan, who after five years found himself on the same stream as Kevin McKernan and Steve Kirsch talking about amyloid like he was talking in 2020 when he said it was the worst case scenario and a billion people were gonna die.

01:04:13.652 --> 01:04:30.796
And so what's more interesting is that not only was Kevin McCairn saying that that discussion had to be headed off at the pass so that nobody was led down that false path, but he identified a number of players very early on as being really important in that game.

01:04:31.316 --> 01:04:36.597
The Bailey's and Andrew Kaufman is the first guy that he ever mentioned.

01:04:37.758 --> 01:04:38.918
Now, interestingly,

01:04:41.215 --> 01:04:59.093
Interestingly, now in 2025, we have him, let's say, acknowledging that debate in some way or another, even if he's acknowledging it and calling it silly, he is acknowledging that that debate exists, that that discussion exists, and that people have that discussion, even if it's a dumb discussion.

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.935
He's acknowledging that it's happening.

01:05:00.955 --> 01:05:01.996
Okay.

01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:05.904
pages 285 to 288, which is titled.

01:05:06.184 --> 01:05:10.268
And he even gives a citation for that, shows the book.

01:05:10.288 --> 01:05:11.889
Let me tell you what he believes first.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:18.494
He believes in miasmas, which are sort of Greeks to loosely mean poisons.

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:22.077
And so now he's going to characterize it, probably mischaracterize it.

01:05:22.117 --> 01:05:24.379
And Bobby can say, I don't believe in miasmas.

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:25.260
That's ridiculous.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.120
I never said that.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.141
I just explained it.

01:05:27.682 --> 01:05:30.123
But that's what we're going to see here as the theater.

01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:30.964
Now, let's move on.

01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:35.447
The reason why this I find especially revealing.

01:05:35.507 --> 01:05:38.408
He wants to keep some of the tax cuts he had originally said.

01:05:38.448 --> 01:05:41.650
And what Bannon stands for, which breaks with Elon Musk.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:58.039
Now while this is happening, while Paul Offit says that it's crazy for people to have any doubt in the germ theory, even though this doubt and that debate was already seeded five years ago by a number of these meddlers specifically,

01:05:59.011 --> 01:06:04.033
And I mean Kevin McCairn, Paul Cuttrell, Hendrick Kaufman, Tom Cowan.

01:06:05.334 --> 01:06:16.539
Tom Cowan, who has a book with one of these companies two years before the pandemic, was conveniently part of this, again, limited spectrum of debate where nobody learned anything, nobody progressed.

01:06:17.566 --> 01:06:20.749
in their engagement in noncompliance.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:33.721
They just ran in circles with FOIA requests and culturing and isolation and purification and did not make progress with, then they're murdering people.

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:37.385
And that's extraordinary in hindsight.

01:06:38.359 --> 01:07:00.277
Now what you see here is a 2025 video of The View, where one of the members of that pseudo discussion, that fake discussion, that discussion between actors on a script, maybe they're improvising within a script, is acknowledging that Steve Bannon is a very interesting character, a patriotic character.

01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:03.600
And that, I find, I'm gonna turn this one,

01:07:09.628 --> 01:07:26.359
I find that to be very interesting because again, like a hamster wheel, every few years, the same characters come back and the same questions come back and the same debates come back with reinforced new, new adjusted narratives and, and a few more pieces of evidence.

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:28.640
It is really like a hamster wheel.

01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:38.046
And so the guy who said it was a lab leak in 2020 is now back and he's not going to talk about that anymore because he assumes that's already well decided.

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:38.827
That's obvious.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:45.273
And these people are willing to talk about him as a relevant guy.

01:07:45.874 --> 01:07:51.959
And that is not by accident, ladies and gentlemen, that is a scripted mention of Steve Bannon.

01:07:52.259 --> 01:07:53.320
Don't tax overtime.

01:07:53.941 --> 01:07:55.462
Don't tax social security.

01:07:55.682 --> 01:07:59.185
Don't tax, give the money to the people that need it the most.

01:07:59.205 --> 01:08:00.326
Who, Bannon says that?

01:08:00.366 --> 01:08:01.027
Bannon, Steve Bannon.

01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:02.268
Wow, that sounds like a lefty.

01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:03.789
Why do you think I said I agree with Steve?

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:05.391
Wow, Bannon says that?

01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:16.312
Do you honestly, can we honestly say to our children that we believe that is a spontaneous conversation where Ms.

01:08:16.372 --> 01:08:20.473
Midler is just coming to the realization that Bannon might not be a bad guy after all?

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:28.215
Or is it possible that our governance is dependent on our belief that that's the case?

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:36.929
that these women are just talking and their questions are relevant, their conclusions are relevant, and what they figure out is relevant.

01:08:36.989 --> 01:08:38.529
How they learn is how I learn.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.130
I have no response.

01:08:42.431 --> 01:08:45.972
Darn it, it won't do it.

01:08:46.012 --> 01:08:46.972
That's what I'm sad about.

01:08:47.032 --> 01:08:52.814
That's what makes me the most sad because that's what's incorrect about the way that this works.

01:08:53.534 --> 01:08:57.996
And what we have to pass on to our children is a knowledge

01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:12.636
that these people are not genuine, that their script exists, and that even their reference to other people is scripted on purpose to control the masses.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:14.598
And that's what's beautiful about it now.

01:09:14.678 --> 01:09:15.980
You can see that they are

01:09:17.429 --> 01:09:31.156
Witting or unwitting, even if they just read, you know, stick to the talking points on their little blue pieces of paper, they are unwitting participants in this show that people like Steve Bannon are orchestrating.

01:09:32.617 --> 01:09:40.901
Former Goldman Sachs employee, former Navy intelligence officer, former movie producer, guy who says he's going to make a movie about Epstein pretty soon.

01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:43.563
I mean, it's just absurd at this point.

01:09:44.909 --> 01:09:50.115
that no one sees this except for Mark and me and the people watching our show.

01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:08.410
And so, of course, one of the other things that is revealed this week is that I probably was right that, you know, other people that told me these stories, it's true.

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:26.677
I heard multiple stories from multiple people who I think are very credible, who have been on sets around the world during the pandemic, especially in 2020 and early 2021, where people were vaccinated before the vaccine was released to the public.

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:34.996
And so I'm talking about secretly at Hollywood parties, people were vaccinated.

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:39.639
And at on set, people were vaccinated.

01:10:39.659 --> 01:10:43.621
You were basically forced to choose to take it if you wanted to keep working.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:44.862
And Hollywood did that.

01:10:45.523 --> 01:10:49.805
And a lot of Hollywood did it without really it becoming a big deal.

01:10:49.866 --> 01:10:52.587
And I do think that people probably died.

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.028
People probably were injured.

01:10:54.569 --> 01:10:56.370
And one of them was my friend, Annie Wershing.

01:10:59.525 --> 01:11:19.077
And I do know that I have one other source that I think is very, very, very much real, who is on a movie set in London, actually, who experienced the same kind of pressure to get vaccinated and the intense thing that Woody Harrelson is going to explain here in a second.

01:11:21.379 --> 01:11:22.800
Hey, what the hell?

01:11:25.641 --> 01:11:26.342
Why didn't that play?

01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:29.786
Can I play media?

01:11:29.866 --> 01:11:30.266
Oh, sorry.

01:11:30.306 --> 01:11:31.087
Okay, I gotta get out.

01:11:32.448 --> 01:11:33.068
And this one.

01:11:34.109 --> 01:11:34.970
It should have played right away.

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.711
That's what was weird.

01:11:37.612 --> 01:11:38.313
Still not gonna play.

01:11:38.353 --> 01:11:43.797
Well, you know, I mean, I don't know how many sets you visited, but everybody was like, you know, in masks.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:44.678
Yeah.

01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:46.460
And then there'd be different zones.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:47.380
Yeah.

01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:56.088
And then, you know, you get, the closer you get to the actual set where the shooting is, and then that red zone, people, put your mask on.

01:11:56.368 --> 01:11:58.109
Now understand what that does.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:04.213
That is just like whatever Ash or Milgram experiment or illusion of consensus.

01:12:04.313 --> 01:12:18.902
If everybody is induced, enticed and coerced into performing the ritual, then everybody that encounters those people performing the ritual will be sucked into it.

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:23.685
And it doesn't matter if the ritual is putting underwear on their head or wearing a mask.

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:26.310
People will do that.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:28.191
That's what social animals do.

01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:30.512
And the pressure is incredible.

01:12:31.492 --> 01:12:38.775
That's why it feels so good to go to high school wearing clothes that you're comfortable in.

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.636
Maybe even clothes that you know everybody thinks are cool.

01:12:41.676 --> 01:12:48.339
Or maybe it's even the best is to go on a day when everybody's wearing their jersey because there's a big game.

01:12:48.399 --> 01:12:51.560
And so everybody really fits in today.

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:57.978
There's no possible way that anybody's gonna be judging your shoes today because it's that kind of a day.

01:12:58.438 --> 01:13:00.439
That social pressure is very real.

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:07.283
Anybody that's gone to an American high school understands that social pressure is very real and it can be based on almost anything.

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:15.732
In the early 90s, when I was in the late 80s, sorry, I graduated in 1990 from high school.

01:13:16.233 --> 01:13:23.635
In the late 80s, it was cool to have guest jeans, but guest jeans were fricking expensive, so I never had guest jeans.

01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:32.678
But you can imagine, and I think anybody that grew up in an American high school like that, you can imagine how these little things matter.

01:13:33.198 --> 01:13:37.280
Having Air Jordans or not having Air Jordans can make you feel comfortable or not.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:49.107
but it's not a question of, it's an imaginary social pressure that is created and alleviated all in our mind.

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:58.198
That's why some of the coolest kids in your high school never cared about guest jeans or Michael Jordan's shoes.

01:14:00.097 --> 01:14:12.885
And that's the magic of this is that if you start to see that in a health care setting, it really only takes the CEO and the head of operations and the head of your department to insist that you follow protocol.

01:14:13.445 --> 01:14:15.367
And if you want to keep your job, you're going to do it.

01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:21.951
And then by keeping your job and doing it, you are part of an illusion of consensus that all

01:14:23.027 --> 01:14:31.089
of the medical students that work under your faculty will see as an illusion of consensus that, well, who am I to question all these guys?

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:38.892
And the same thing happens at every school board meeting and at every council meeting.

01:14:41.152 --> 01:14:49.675
And it's the unwitting participation of people who are not engaged in critical thought that make it so powerful.

01:14:52.202 --> 01:15:10.145
And so all the people on a movie set that just want to make it, that just dream of being an actor, that just go along because they'll do anything, are the same people that create the illusion of consensus with only a few witting participants being required.

01:15:14.906 --> 01:15:16.707
And I just say, I never bought it.

01:15:20.956 --> 01:15:25.498
And so all these things are pretty safe to say.

01:15:25.698 --> 01:15:27.239
The death of the germ theory.

01:15:27.299 --> 01:15:42.047
So here's a video from early 2021 with Sasha Stone, who you can Google your way to understand why it's so weird that this guy is hosting this meeting and who's in this meeting and what gets said in it.

01:15:43.267 --> 01:15:44.388
I'm just going to let this roll.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.583
Artist Sasha Stone grew up in Rhodesia, Zimbabwe during the War of Independence.

01:15:51.103 --> 01:15:54.546
He is an activist, speaker, publisher, author, and filmmaker.

01:15:55.066 --> 01:16:06.593
Stone has initiated peace initiatives and... Okay, so AncientRelic32 has just made a statement in the chat that in my mind is almost kind of frightening.

01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:09.015
There was only like a year and a half

01:16:09.978 --> 01:16:28.435
where people were safety pinning the rolled up pants because you can tight roll them if you have long enough pants you can tight roll them and you don't need a safety pin and it was really this time when actually people were there was a time when people actually also just pinned them at the back it's nuts wow what a nice mention that's cute

01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:40.518
and educational programs, stood up against human rights abuses in various parts of the world, and continues to stand out for the protection of pioneering innovators, scientists, and doctors.

01:16:41.238 --> 01:16:58.171
In an online video conference in early 2021, he talks with Dr. Christiane Northrup, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Carrie Marday, Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, Dr. Tom Cohen, and Dr. Andrew Kaufman about the issue, the death of the germ theory.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:07.385
I'm fairly sure that that woman, Northrup, was just on Steve Kirsch's podcast the other day, but I'd have to look.

01:17:07.726 --> 01:17:10.388
I think we as clinicians need to go back to our roots.

01:17:11.289 --> 01:17:22.939
And when I was training in medical school and residency in the 80s and 90s, the pediatricians who were training us had been practicing pediatric medicine in New York City since the 1940s.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:32.366
and they would say someth They would say that when practice would have their their measles, moms, chi colds, coughs, runny nos

01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:44.075
they would actually have a developmental growth spurt after the illness was over.

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:54.104
And so we forgot that after the 1990s when we started to say that every disease needs to be wiped out.

01:17:54.525 --> 01:17:58.929
Every disease is an infection that needs either antibiotics or antiviral.

01:17:59.369 --> 01:18:02.752
And every disease needs to be stopped with vaccines.

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:09.778
And so somewhere in the 1990s, I heard the term that the body has the innate capacity to heal.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.921
And Western medicine has no concept of that at all.

01:18:14.922 --> 01:18:16.083
And I searched for it.

01:18:16.323 --> 01:18:17.624
The chiropractors talked about it.

01:18:17.664 --> 01:18:18.925
The homeopaths talked about it.

01:18:19.426 --> 01:18:29.354
Acupuncturists, Ayurvedic specialists, all of the what we call alternative practitioners clearly understood that the body had the innate capacity to heal.

01:18:30.154 --> 01:18:53.968
If we go into the science of the body, if we look at the immune system, if we look at the autonomic nervous system, if we look at the lung system, the heart system, the kidney system, the gastrointestinal system, the dermatology system, if we look at every system, we can understand in the basic science of the body that the body works to heal itself if given the right tool.

01:18:55.049 --> 01:18:57.571
And so over the last 20 plus years,

01:18:58.763 --> 01:19:04.826
I have been practicing that an acute illness in children is actually not a cause of a problem.

01:19:05.347 --> 01:19:07.588
It's actually the resolution to a problem.

01:19:08.288 --> 01:19:20.475
And that stress and toxicity and poor diets and poor sleep and injections with poisons and inappropriate or unfortunate emotional environments, all of these things,

01:19:21.212 --> 01:19:28.897
will increase stress in t will create increased wa has so much capacity to g it has to explode.

01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:30.798
And t is the acute illness.

01:19:31.319 --> 01:19:32.619
The resolution of problem.

01:19:41.505 --> 01:19:58.545
So we need to start practicing that children getting sick is actually a way for them to resolve stress, to clear out waste, to get rid of toxins, to utilize the bacteria, the viruses, the protozoa, the amoeba, the parasites that are in their body.

01:19:59.246 --> 01:20:05.027
that are capable of assisting in the expelling and the extermination of wastes and toxins.

01:20:05.427 --> 01:20:20.991
And then what we see is pruning of the nervous system, pruning of the immune system, advancement of the human ecosystem, and a stronger, more vital, and more developed child into their adulthood.

01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:28.493
If you look at where this video roughly is placed relative to, sorry, relative to the

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:29.920
the murder.

01:20:31.001 --> 01:20:40.044
It's very curious at this point in time to be so, I don't know, it doesn't seem very precise to me.

01:20:40.064 --> 01:20:46.247
It doesn't really have a very good message in light of the amount of murder that's gone on for the last year and a half.

01:20:47.447 --> 01:20:52.069
The amount of, you know, regular PCR testing that's going on, the regular, uh,

01:20:54.036 --> 01:21:04.604
acknowledgement of the ritual, and instead we're actually talking about infection being an inflection point where afterward we go through a growth spurt.

01:21:05.885 --> 01:21:08.007
So we're not really questioning anything here.

01:21:09.048 --> 01:21:09.908
Just keep that in mind.

01:21:10.956 --> 01:21:15.477
He's not questioning anything with regard to pathogens doing anything.

01:21:15.517 --> 01:21:16.337
You get infected.

01:21:16.537 --> 01:21:24.059
So the only way I feel is for us to change institutions is for us to change it on the ground.

01:21:24.559 --> 01:21:39.302
And that is to start teaching parents and teaching other practitioners how to reduce wastes coming into the body, how to fix an emotional environment, how to understand children's needs on a spiritual level,

01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:49.705
how to feed them correctly on body, mind, and spirit, and how to maximize their potential rather than suppress everything that we do in society.

01:21:49.966 --> 01:21:58.308
We suppress their emotions, we suppress their symptoms, we suppress everything because we don't like discomfort.

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:00.289
And I think on the ground,

01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:03.896
we can do it and the instituions won't change.

01:22:04.197 --> 01:22:04.957
They'll just dissolve.

01:22:05.358 --> 01:22:06.038
Absolutely.

01:22:06.498 --> 01:22:07.839
I'd love to introduce that.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:17.807
And I think this is a really, really key time that we're in because we're on the verge of a major paradigm shift in healthcare and in true healing.

01:22:17.867 --> 01:22:19.689
And that's what we're really talking about.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:25.073
Germ theory is the theory that's been around for over a hundred years and has been the main

01:22:25.914 --> 01:22:29.537
model for disease throughout our Western health care system.

01:22:30.137 --> 01:22:42.927
And essentially what it proposes is that there are these microscopic organisms that exist all around us, and they have evil intent to come into our bodies and attack us and cause disease.

01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:46.049
And our medical model of

01:22:46.694 --> 01:22:53.720
providing pharmaceutical drugs and being dependent on professionals is really based around this theory.

01:22:54.140 --> 01:23:10.233
Now remember, what's really interesting is that Kevin McCairn was very adamant in the five consecutive weekend streams that I did with him and Paul Cutrell and Addy Adds, all associates of Mr. George Webb, in the beginning of 2020.

01:23:12.202 --> 01:23:19.470
were adamant that this guy, Andy Kaufman, was the bad guy of all bad guys on the no virus team that had to be opposed.

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:26.117
This guy who was doing prison biometrics with Andrew Cuomo before the pandemic.

01:23:27.478 --> 01:23:28.219
It's just the truth.

01:23:30.201 --> 01:23:30.702
This guy.

01:23:36.158 --> 01:23:48.296
But when you go and look for the primary evidence to actually show that this is true, what you find is that it's full of fault and fraud and that there's really no scientific basis.

01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:55.091
And terrain theory is the other theory that was discovered only shortly after germ theory was proposed.

01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:56.811
Thank you.

01:23:57.131 --> 01:24:00.692
Terrain theory wasn't discovered and it is proposed.

01:24:00.832 --> 01:24:01.992
Theories are proposed.

01:24:02.092 --> 01:24:03.072
Theories are tested.

01:24:03.132 --> 01:24:09.394
Theories, hypotheses probably because theories need a little more evidence than a hypothesis does, but okay, go ahead.

01:24:10.654 --> 01:24:11.714
I'm being nitpicky here.

01:24:11.834 --> 01:24:17.095
By some very rigorous scientists like Antoine Béchamp and Gunther Enderlein,

01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:45.863
And essentially, it's familiar to everyone already, because when you talk about the gut microbiome or the microbiome and gut bacteria, what you're really talking about is terrain theory, which says that the microorganisms actually function in a way that they do out in nature, where they break down dead and dying tissue and debris and remove it, and that they're actually an integral part of our healing process.

01:24:46.585 --> 01:24:51.757
and that they're not the cause of disease but actually part of our response to it.

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:58.210
And you know, we all know that health fails when our bacteria that live in our body are not healthy.

01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:03.532
And that those... And so that's him obfuscating the truth here, right?

01:25:03.572 --> 01:25:05.873
He's kind of talking out of both sides of his mouth.

01:25:05.933 --> 01:25:17.238
If he says the germ theory is based on the fact that there are these little organisms that are out to get us, when in reality, it is a fine line between that reality and the truth.

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:20.860
Because if our gut is leaky,

01:25:21.835 --> 01:25:40.880
than the proteins and toxins and waste and whatever that is produced by this bacterial symbiotic ecosystem in our gut is not well controlled in its ability to reach our insides and our blood and our circulation, then it can cause all kinds of problems.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:50.482
So this is incredibly disingenuous with a level of sort of arrogance and certainty that hides it.

01:25:51.567 --> 01:25:54.488
And it's very, very, very skillfully done.

01:25:55.648 --> 01:26:01.951
That's why I think he's probably part of it, because that's why all of them agree to mention him.

01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:09.293
And then when you go to him, you find somebody who is malevolently persuasive in his obfuscation.

01:26:09.533 --> 01:26:17.056
But if you know the biology, then you can hear it plainly for what it is, because he keeps talking out of both sides of his mouth.

01:26:19.172 --> 01:26:22.695
Cells outnumber our own cells by some estimates 10 to 1.

01:26:23.936 --> 01:26:39.328
So terrain theory is really talking about a natural integration of all the organisms into an ecosystem within our own bodies that works in a collaborative manner to restore and bring about lasting health.

01:26:40.546 --> 01:26:46.931
So essentially everything we think we know about germs is essentially in front.

01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.172
Look at that smile.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:52.515
What role did Louis Pasteur play in the germ fiction?

01:26:53.656 --> 01:26:56.038
Well, Louis Pasteur was a central figure.

01:26:56.459 --> 01:27:07.167
And what he did was really copy some scientific experiments done by others, such as Antoine Béchamp and Claude Bernard.

01:27:08.004 --> 01:27:14.847
but sensationalized them in such a way to appeal to the French royalty and aristocracy.

01:27:15.468 --> 01:27:19.009
And he became their, you know, favorite prodigal son.

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:27.253
And that's why they called upon him to solve problems with like silkworm diseases and things like that.

01:27:27.313 --> 01:27:28.634
And he rose to prominence.

01:27:29.226 --> 01:27:38.552
But we know later from uncovering his diaries and such that much of the science that he did was actually fraudulent and misleading.

01:27:38.572 --> 01:27:41.194
He was really about self-promotion.

01:27:41.694 --> 01:27:53.122
But the medical establishment that was being formed at the turn of the century with respect to influence of the Rockefeller system really

01:27:54.227 --> 01:28:15.556
seized upon that model and what's his eyes what are his eyes scanning there because it's not he's not just talking right he's scanning either a talking point list or an outline it's it's it's obvious um and it you know helped him rise to prominence such that we all know his name right because we know about pasteurization for example which is named after him

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:19.102
I started to study on my own and it worked.

01:28:19.382 --> 01:28:30.255
People got better and I ultimately found that the causes of disease were really toxins or lack of nutrients or lack of your building blocks and that any infection anybody could get over.

01:28:30.275 --> 01:28:33.719
I didn't see any infection that was that powerful that could overcome anybody.

01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:37.982
I found them more opportunistic because the body was imbalanced.

01:28:38.162 --> 01:28:40.383
The body was weakened by something.

01:28:40.443 --> 01:28:46.748
And so my job was to educate and help the person find out what those blockages were, what happened, whether it's emotional or physical.

01:28:46.968 --> 01:28:52.312
And so now imagine how many of these people need to be in on it for the other three to go along.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:57.735
to get a private call beforehand saying, this is what we're gonna cover, can you contribute something?

01:28:58.435 --> 01:28:59.736
How many of them need to be in on it?

01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:03.817
Just Dr. Carey and Dr. Andrew Kaufman and Dr. Tom Cowan?

01:29:03.917 --> 01:29:04.257
Maybe.

01:29:05.477 --> 01:29:13.699
But the more that are in on it, the scarier it is because these people then spread out over time because of this, right?

01:29:13.759 --> 01:29:17.120
And because of the podcasts they go on and they keep spreading around.

01:29:18.191 --> 01:29:47.258
then a few years later they'll come back together again then they'll spread around again and that's how it works as long as two or three of these people are in any given group it's always I don't know why that's not working it's really strange let me see for a second if I can fix that I need that file here right there

01:29:49.878 --> 01:29:50.078
No.

01:29:50.359 --> 01:29:50.619
Oh no.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.122
I want it right.

01:29:54.607 --> 01:29:54.827
No.

01:29:55.589 --> 01:29:56.150
Dog on it.

01:29:58.334 --> 01:29:58.574
There.

01:30:00.358 --> 01:30:00.818
There we go.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:01.840
Okay.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:02.502
So let's get going.

01:30:04.068 --> 01:30:05.168
and environmental.

01:30:06.228 --> 01:30:09.189
And I still believe in that to this day, that's the terrain theory.

01:30:09.849 --> 01:30:19.031
And one thing to know, everybody should know this fact, bacteria and other infections, people think of infections, other organisms, they're very, very important.

01:30:19.511 --> 01:30:28.092
Because the human body, our genomes are one of the smallest genomes of all the animals on the planet, but we have the most genes of just about any animal on the planet.

01:30:28.372 --> 01:30:32.313
What an interesting thing for her to be talking about so precisely.

01:30:34.031 --> 01:30:40.554
while at the same time just a few seconds ago was saying some nonsense that didn't seem very precise at all.

01:30:40.654 --> 01:30:43.155
So much so that I feel like we've got to go back a little bit.

01:30:43.175 --> 01:30:44.275
Listen to this.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.244
I started to study on my own and it worked.

01:30:57.504 --> 01:30:58.225
People got better.

01:30:58.445 --> 01:31:04.610
And I ultimately found that the causes of disease were really toxins or lack of nutrients or lack of your building blocks.

01:31:05.271 --> 01:31:07.212
And that- Lack of your building blocks?

01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:08.373
Anybody could get over.

01:31:08.393 --> 01:31:11.876
I didn't see any infection that was that powerful that could overcome anybody.

01:31:12.296 --> 01:31:16.100
I found them more opportunistic because the body was imbalanced.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:19.502
The body was- It's such an imprecise discussion.

01:31:19.522 --> 01:31:22.465
And then suddenly she's going to switch to tell you all about genes.

01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:24.048
weakened by something.

01:31:24.088 --> 01:31:31.614
And so my job was to educate and help the person find out what those blockages were, what happened, whether it's emotional or physical, environmental.

01:31:32.695 --> 01:31:34.536
And I still believe in that to this day.

01:31:34.576 --> 01:31:35.637
That's the terrain theory.

01:31:36.277 --> 01:31:45.425
And one thing to know, everybody should know this fact, bacteria and other infections, people think of infections, other organisms, they're very, very important.

01:31:45.945 --> 01:31:50.568
Because the human body, our genomes are one of the smallest genomes of all the animals on the planet.

01:31:50.688 --> 01:31:54.491
But we have the most genes of just about any animal on the planet.

01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:55.471
So how is that possible?

01:31:56.092 --> 01:32:01.135
Well, the genes come from the bacteria and other organisms that are in us and on us.

01:32:01.636 --> 01:32:02.416
We need that.

01:32:02.496 --> 01:32:04.437
We need them desperately or we would die.

01:32:04.898 --> 01:32:05.978
So they're not bad.

01:32:06.339 --> 01:32:06.899
We need them.

01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:11.242
We are in a symbiosis with everything around us and inside of us teeming, right?

01:32:11.842 --> 01:32:13.764
So you can't sanitize everything.

01:32:13.784 --> 01:32:14.944
You're killing the good stuff, too.

01:32:14.984 --> 01:32:15.845
You're killing the things that

01:32:16.025 --> 01:32:16.606
make you healthy.

01:32:17.086 --> 01:32:18.247
And so it's good, right?

01:32:18.407 --> 01:32:20.049
Some of this is real.

01:32:20.249 --> 01:32:21.890
Some of it is nonsense.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:30.238
And that's what makes it so frustrating to listen to the certainty of these people and look at their smug smile after a year and a half of murder.

01:32:32.827 --> 01:32:37.590
You have to understand who we are, what we are, and what science truly is.

01:32:37.670 --> 01:32:43.834
We've been taught the wrong science, and we're teaching our med students the wrong science now.

01:32:44.134 --> 01:32:44.934
It's a script.

01:32:45.135 --> 01:32:46.035
Can you not hear it?

01:32:46.195 --> 01:32:47.116
It is a script.

01:32:47.516 --> 01:32:49.097
She's too happy about this.

01:32:49.757 --> 01:32:58.483
If she really believes some of the things that she's purporting to believe, then she would be very unhappy, because she would be very sad for America's grandkids.

01:33:00.438 --> 01:33:01.999
You have to understand those points.

01:33:02.019 --> 01:33:11.707
So I hope that we can see a revolution now in medicine and we bring back true science and start teaching people and others about educating them how to be healthy.

01:33:11.928 --> 01:33:22.356
And that viruses are not pathogens, they are genetic debris that comes from the- Is he really on camera and also talking into a phone?

01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:24.378
That is fabulous.

01:33:24.478 --> 01:33:26.640
Breakdown of the cells and tissues.

01:33:28.101 --> 01:33:31.882
And I actually once heard Sherry say this in a wonderful way.

01:33:32.362 --> 01:33:38.944
The reason we get sick is we don't have enough of the good stuff, and we have too much of the bad stuff.

01:33:39.584 --> 01:33:51.748
So you put bad stuff in you, and then you break down, and the little garbage, the little pieces of paper, some of them with Dusty Epstein's name on them, we call those viruses.

01:33:52.429 --> 01:33:56.910
when they're nothing of the sort of pathogenic viruses.

01:33:57.230 --> 01:34:07.013
So our next step in this process, because everything everybody's saying is absolutely correct, there is no, quote, vaccine here.

01:34:07.553 --> 01:34:11.534
There's just a toxic mechanism of harm.

01:34:12.274 --> 01:34:14.135
And it all comes back to something

01:34:16.004 --> 01:34:22.232
And so we're arguing about the vaccine right now, but not really because he could call it transfection.

01:34:23.093 --> 01:34:25.917
I had already been calling it transfection for almost a year.

01:34:27.358 --> 01:34:27.999
It's weird.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.964
And you hear it now, and you see how late they are.

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:54.012
There's already a year and a half of murder here where an MD like Tom Cowan could have spoke up about the absolutely irresponsible use of ventilators, the irresponsible omission of antibiotics, the irresponsible willy-nilly use of supplementary oxygen in response to a dime store Amazon bought pulse oximeter.

01:34:55.984 --> 01:35:09.590
They could have been already as MDs getting mad about the fact that the FLCCC is sending people to the hospital if they have a 94 or less percent pulse ox while they're wearing N95 masks.

01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:13.691
But none of these people are gonna speak to that now.

01:35:15.172 --> 01:35:17.373
None of these people are gonna stop the murder.

01:35:17.853 --> 01:35:19.174
They're gonna run out the clock.

01:35:19.554 --> 01:35:21.575
He's barely even got Zoom figured out.

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:24.416
He's gotta use a phone at the same time that he's on camera.

01:35:26.519 --> 01:35:42.673
If you can't see how malevolent it is that these people are together in 2021 while people are being murdered and they're not talking about the murder, but instead barely addressing the new vaccine out there.

01:35:44.595 --> 01:35:48.218
No one has said that intramuscular injection in general is dumb.

01:35:52.199 --> 01:35:56.302
he's implying that there might be a combination of things they could inject, which is good.

01:35:56.322 --> 01:35:58.764
But in this case, that's a combination of toxic stuff.

01:36:01.426 --> 01:36:03.928
So Tom and Andy, why are you harping on this?

01:36:04.589 --> 01:36:06.010
Uh, that there's no virus.

01:36:06.090 --> 01:36:14.437
The reason is because once we really see the facts and the science, they can't do this to us again.

01:36:15.678 --> 01:36:20.482
They've been doing this to us with measles and AIDS and you know,

01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:25.953
AIDS is the same as Ebola is the same as measles.

01:36:26.033 --> 01:36:27.254
And there's the danger, right?

01:36:28.095 --> 01:36:29.116
There's the danger.

01:36:31.497 --> 01:36:41.645
Because a lot of what this is happening here could easily be the mislabeling of the the over labeling of imagine a scenario where anything

01:36:42.685 --> 01:36:44.866
that a gay man caught was HIV.

01:36:45.706 --> 01:36:55.769
Imagine the ever list, ever expanding list of possible symptomologies or, or, or manifestations of HIV.

01:36:56.589 --> 01:37:00.590
Because if you go through that history, you will see that it starts with a small list.

01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:07.132
And by the end, there are a lot of things that only can happen in women like uterine cancer can be connected to HIV.

01:37:09.192 --> 01:37:15.513
And the only way to test if anybody is HIV positive for many, many, many, many years was the presence of antibodies.

01:37:20.017 --> 01:37:33.707
Ladies and gentlemen, the imprecision of the retelling, the imprecision of the objection, the imprecision of the language chosen by these people is not by accident in 2021.

01:37:34.207 --> 01:37:40.812
It is by design, by script, and at least half of these people know that they are following a script.

01:37:41.772 --> 01:37:42.713
They're happy to do it.

01:37:44.935 --> 01:37:48.097
And Zika, over and over again, because

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:59.616
The entire world, including the scientific community and the medical doctors, unfortunately, are illiterate, essentially, about the science of viruses.

01:38:00.597 --> 01:38:07.521
As actually was I until I opened my big mouth and Andy said, you gotta look at this a little more.

01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:12.324
I mean, I've known about HIV and AIDS for 30 years.

01:38:13.705 --> 01:38:18.228
Anybody who honestly looks at the science will come

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:24.083
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna make a statement right here that might seem pretty bold, but I don't think it is.

01:38:24.843 --> 01:38:26.944
That's got to be a lie.

01:38:28.024 --> 01:38:29.885
And do you know why I think it's a lie?

01:38:31.106 --> 01:38:40.110
Because if you actually knew the story of AIDS before the pandemic, then you're nothing but a scoundrel.

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:42.661
and a failure.

01:38:43.342 --> 01:38:58.417
If you knew the story of AIDS for almost 30 years, and you only wrote this book in 2018, and it's this big, and it doesn't say that intramuscular injection is dumb, then you're just a scoundrel, Tom Cowen.

01:38:59.418 --> 01:39:01.760
You're a fake scoundrel.

01:39:02.557 --> 01:39:15.782
Because if you've known that AIDS was fake for 30 years, yet at the start of the pandemic, you had a book and in 2025, you still can't say that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:39:17.042 --> 01:39:20.143
You still can't say that it was murder.

01:39:21.184 --> 01:39:24.385
And that's how they convinced us that something was happening here.

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:27.746
You can't say it as an American, you're a traitor.

01:39:29.076 --> 01:39:31.757
And I think this video reveals him as a traitor.

01:39:31.817 --> 01:39:35.719
If he says that he thought that AIDS was fake for 30 years, I didn't.

01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:39.081
I didn't think it was fake.

01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:50.687
I didn't learn that AIDS was fake until after I realized that I was bamboozled by the vaccine schedule and my doctor was too, and that I failed to protect my daughter.

01:39:54.366 --> 01:40:04.688
These people who claim to have known for this long but have gotten nowhere and gotten the message nowhere and have no billboards that say it are traitors to our grandchildren.

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:11.230
And the smiles on their face as they tell us reveals them.

01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:14.611
I can't do this with a smile.

01:40:14.751 --> 01:40:15.411
Conclusion.

01:40:16.069 --> 01:40:18.910
that they haven't isolated pathogenic viruses.

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:20.850
Viruses aren't pathogens.

01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:25.091
There's a whole nother mechanism, as Sherry said, why we get sick.

01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:26.531
We get poisoned.

01:40:26.591 --> 01:40:29.472
We have too much bad stuff, not enough good stuff.

01:40:30.232 --> 01:40:32.232
And that's kind of all there is to it.

01:40:32.412 --> 01:40:39.614
And let's all move on and build a better life, because we don't need to keep focusing on viruses, because there's nothing there.

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:45.455
So after all that shit, he still didn't say we should stop injecting our kids.

01:40:46.516 --> 01:40:47.597
Do you see it yet?

01:40:47.617 --> 01:40:52.520
Thanks for listening, everybody.

01:40:52.901 --> 01:40:55.002
Thank you, Tom.

01:40:56.043 --> 01:40:57.104
Randy, you want to add anything?

01:40:57.824 --> 01:41:01.427
Even the laughter is an illusion of consensus.

01:41:02.988 --> 01:41:05.410
It's like a laugh track in Seinfeld.

01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:06.710
Without it, it doesn't hit.

01:41:06.771 --> 01:41:07.611
So these people know that.

01:41:11.803 --> 01:41:13.265
These people know that game.

01:41:13.385 --> 01:41:15.608
Intelligence people would know that game.

01:41:15.628 --> 01:41:24.179
And so if there are people that are playing along here, some of them are laughing along because they're unwitting, and that's what people do when they don't get the joke.

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.066
Other people are laughing to make sure that the spell is successfully cast.

01:41:30.458 --> 01:41:36.921
Well, you know, I want to add that it's really hard to follow Tom because he said everything in such a great way.

01:41:37.441 --> 01:41:40.682
But I do have a few other things to offer.

01:41:40.862 --> 01:41:47.045
And one is just to actually to back up what has been said in terms of the word germ itself.

01:41:47.915 --> 01:41:51.738
that the real meaning of the germ is a new growth.

01:41:51.818 --> 01:41:57.723
So is anybody else seeing him as kind of the leader here, the little coordinator, the little curator of the whole debate?

01:41:57.803 --> 01:42:02.026
And Tom Cowan is just kind of following along, learning how it goes.

01:42:02.787 --> 01:42:10.392
Maybe Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is also just not aware of the fact that everybody is ignoring Brandy Bond's message.

01:42:11.673 --> 01:42:15.236
Even though Brandy Bond died like two months before this, it's February, 2021.

01:42:18.865 --> 01:42:19.726
Think about that.

01:42:20.366 --> 01:42:23.789
Brandy Vaughn died two months before this video was made.

01:42:30.674 --> 01:42:32.755
New life budding out.

01:42:33.636 --> 01:42:42.082
And when we conflate that term to mean some agent of disease, we're really actually turning it completely upside down.

01:42:42.943 --> 01:42:46.606
And so to understand that germ really means life.

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:50.300
and that we need those germs for our lives.

01:42:51.884 --> 01:42:54.385
Um, I just want to add a little bit.

01:42:54.925 --> 01:43:05.827
Um, and this is not for fear mongering purposes, but just kind of as to shed some light on what I think is the real intent of this, you know, quote unquote vaccine technology.

01:43:05.907 --> 01:43:11.208
And of course, um, I agree with everyone that what is the intent of the technology?

01:43:11.288 --> 01:43:12.628
Are you ready to hear this?

01:43:12.708 --> 01:43:13.629
Holy cow.

01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:20.270
It's not a vaccine in any traditional sense, but I would say that it's closest to being a gene therapy.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:35.110
And what I think that this actually heralds is a new era of virus discovery and vaccine development that is going to be extremely accelerated compared to the past paradigm.

01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:38.672
But what is virus discovery if it's fake then?

01:43:40.754 --> 01:43:45.457
And so what are these people doing other than confusing the people that are listening?

01:43:46.991 --> 01:43:48.753
They are not at all consistent.

01:43:48.913 --> 01:43:50.875
Tom Cowen just said, forget it all.

01:43:50.935 --> 01:43:51.936
It's all nonsense.

01:43:51.996 --> 01:43:55.060
But he's saying that this is a long-term plan.

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.983
They're going to discover more viruses and have more vaccines.

01:43:58.083 --> 01:43:58.684
What is this?

01:44:00.418 --> 01:44:12.487
In the past, we had vaccines being manufactured from essentially toxic cell cultures, the same kind of procedure that they use to, in their quote, you know, virus isolation.

01:44:12.927 --> 01:44:14.068
See how bad it is?

01:44:14.869 --> 01:44:29.480
Is that in 2021, these guys already had a year to figure out that what they actually do, it's not just a toxic, it's not just a toxic cell culture, it's actually transfection of a cell culture.

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:51.040
by pure DNA or RNA and then whatever happens is what they call virology and you could say that and you could say that these vaccines are really just transfections too because it's all just one big bullshit methodology that we've been using on the bench for a long time it's just become really cheap but they don't say it

01:44:52.466 --> 01:44:53.847
because it's not their job.

01:44:54.267 --> 01:44:56.427
They're not trying to save our grandchildren.

01:44:57.008 --> 01:44:58.268
They are running out the clock.

01:44:58.308 --> 01:45:02.170
They have to run the clock out on this murder that's gonna go on for another year yet.

01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:07.892
Which is not isolation.

01:45:08.852 --> 01:45:18.436
But now we're entering an era where they're more and more claiming that just because they can piece together millions of fragments of RNA,

01:45:19.412 --> 01:45:33.955
of unknown origin into a computer model of a genome, that they're going to exploit that and use this gene therapy platform going forward with every time that they pretend to discover a new virus.

01:45:34.696 --> 01:45:44.978
And the reason that this is so easy and the reason that they were able to get this product to market so much faster than has ever been done before,

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:51.045
is because they had the platform already designed and ready to go.

01:45:51.766 --> 01:46:03.837
No, it's because they already made protein-based biologics and making mRNA is stopping short of that, minus the very expensive purification process.

01:46:03.917 --> 01:46:04.458
That's why.

01:46:05.851 --> 01:46:17.014
Because they already had all the materials and all of the infrastructure necessary to make huge quantities of DNA that could be converted using commercial enzymes to huge quantities of RNA.

01:46:17.475 --> 01:46:25.437
Because that's steps involved in making any protein biologic, the most expensive kind of pharmaceutical product.

01:46:27.796 --> 01:46:50.227
And if you don't have to do the most expensive part of the most expensive part of the most expensive pharmaceutical product, and you don't have to do and pass the purity test of the most expensive pharmaceutical product, but you can still use all of the apparatuses that you already have to make the DNA and the RNA precursors to that most expensive product, instead market this as a vaccine.

01:46:50.587 --> 01:46:52.048
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

01:46:52.388 --> 01:46:55.509
And these people were unable to explain that to you.

01:46:56.029 --> 01:47:00.411
M.D., M.D., M.D., Ph.D., M.D., M.D., Ph.D., 21.

01:47:00.952 --> 01:47:03.473
And if they would have had me on, I would have explained it already.

01:47:04.213 --> 01:47:08.275
The first time I explained it was in my own podcast in July of 2020.

01:47:10.868 --> 01:47:21.416
And of course, if you look at Moderna, they have tried to get this platform approved to treat cancer and such, but they've never actually had a product on the market before.

01:47:21.456 --> 01:47:23.497
Yet they are swimming in cash.

01:47:24.278 --> 01:47:35.486
But with this platform, all you have to do, because what it is, is it's basically like a synthetic exosome made out of some kind of lipid membrane.

01:47:35.686 --> 01:47:38.508
Why not just call it a transfection, you traitor?

01:47:40.247 --> 01:47:41.108
that easily.

01:47:41.168 --> 01:47:43.689
There's a product called lipofectamine.

01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:46.411
It's exactly the same thing.

01:47:46.631 --> 01:47:48.533
It's just a joke to me at this point.

01:47:49.313 --> 01:48:05.064
These people are masquerading as patriots and dissidents and they were all along playing a theater of titration where they slowly rolled us to the inflection point where the murder would end and everybody would say, oh, the COVID shots are obviously bad.

01:48:05.144 --> 01:48:05.904
I always said.

01:48:05.964 --> 01:48:06.765
Into ourselves.

01:48:07.515 --> 01:48:13.359
and it delivers a gene that we don't know what it is, as Tom pointed out, right?

01:48:13.379 --> 01:48:16.221
They say it's a spike protein, but it could really be anything.

01:48:17.601 --> 01:48:21.164
But there's a vehicle, a plasmid or in another tech.

01:48:21.604 --> 01:48:24.906
My goodness, it could also be just placebo, couldn't it be?

01:48:24.986 --> 01:48:30.530
But if you said that, then it would be easy to dismiss the lack of injuries.

01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:34.012
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:40.354
It's from an adenovirus, and it basically just delivers that gene to our cells.

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:53.324
So if they discover or pretend to discover a new virus and have a new gene sequence of an important protein, they can just pop that right into the platform in hours.

01:48:54.225 --> 01:48:56.187
Oh, and so he's selling it for him too.

01:48:56.807 --> 01:48:57.347
Interesting.

01:48:57.387 --> 01:48:59.089
That's exactly the argument they make.

01:49:00.171 --> 01:49:09.897
Like in hours, as long as it takes to synthesize that piece of mRNA on their RNA synthesizer machine, they can pop it in and then boom, have a new product.

01:49:10.318 --> 01:49:12.099
I'm sorry, they're not doing that.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.021
You see the problem there?

01:49:16.101 --> 01:49:21.265
They're not using RNA synthesis machines for making the huge batches.

01:49:22.425 --> 01:49:25.708
They use recombinant genetics and bacterial cultures to do it.

01:49:26.553 --> 01:49:39.706
And so again, here we have imprecision that amounts to obfuscation of the truth that it is murder that was used to coerce people into accepting transfection as a vaccine.

01:49:39.766 --> 01:49:42.588
And these people aren't helping anybody understand that.

01:49:43.029 --> 01:49:47.433
It's real simple, Tom, but for some reason, these jackasses can't say it.

01:49:49.615 --> 01:49:50.716
For any new vaccine.

01:49:51.562 --> 01:50:05.020
And I think that this is really the plan, that there's going to be first mutations of SARS-CoV-2 that are fake, that they'll make new gene therapies for, and then maybe they'll introduce other viruses.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.586
And that each time they have an opportunity to influence our genetics.

01:50:10.314 --> 01:50:17.518
and also claim property rights over us because these sequences are patented and then they're part of our body.

01:50:18.438 --> 01:50:22.020
Oh, so now it's about patenting people and changing them.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:30.844
And so again, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but it's one of those limited spectrums of debate that sure makes it seem like the overclass has got all the cards, doesn't it?

01:50:31.284 --> 01:50:33.745
We're screwed going one way and the other way.

01:50:35.306 --> 01:50:36.727
All powerful leaders

01:50:37.782 --> 01:50:46.308
So there are all sorts of implications if you allow this technology to go further forward and if you participate in this.

01:50:46.789 --> 01:50:58.317
And we're talking about, you know, for the individual, as has been pointed out, this is a time that we need to resume individual responsibility over ourselves, our families, and our domain.

01:50:58.838 --> 01:51:06.163
And if we decide, and we always have the power to decide, okay, no one is holding us down at gunpoint.

01:51:06.795 --> 01:51:09.598
at least at the present moment, to make these decisions.

01:51:10.058 --> 01:51:31.197
But if we decide to take an experimental genetic treatment for a viral illness that doesn't exist, and we have the potential of modifying our own identity as humans as a result, then it would be obviously quite foolish and very much against our interests.

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:51.093
So not to end on such a downer, I want to just say that I am just so pleased and really tickled to be part of this amazing group and to see that such a, you know, group of physicians has come together to

01:51:52.088 --> 01:51:53.588
announced that we want to help.

01:51:53.809 --> 01:52:03.491
I would argue that it's very specifically he pitched for the idea that RNA printing would work, which is also what Vincent Ransom Yellow seeded in these years.

01:52:04.352 --> 01:52:16.535
The gist of it is, is that Vincent Ransom Yellow said that it's just crazy to think, right, that they're making like, when we are working on our bench, we work with nanograms of RNA, and they're now making kilograms of RNA.

01:52:16.555 --> 01:52:17.316
Isn't that nuts?

01:52:17.376 --> 01:52:18.156
It's mind blowing.

01:52:20.748 --> 01:52:23.411
And so the idea is that this isn't going to work.

01:52:24.171 --> 01:52:27.975
That's why there's been an immunologist on Jay Bhattacharya's podcast.

01:52:28.015 --> 01:52:30.737
That's why these guys are talking about RNA printing.

01:52:30.797 --> 01:52:40.747
Because remember, the problem is, is that when you use the DNA construct in a bacterial culture, and then use a commercial RNA polymerase to change that to RNA,

01:52:41.367 --> 01:52:42.528
It's an impure RNA.

01:52:42.568 --> 01:52:52.655
It's got all kinds of impurities from this process and that process, but also from the imperfect nature of the translation from DNA to RNA, yada, yada, yada, all these shortcomings.

01:52:55.057 --> 01:52:57.979
And so they're going to tell us that that's one of the many shortcomings.

01:52:58.019 --> 01:52:59.040
We were very naive.

01:53:00.161 --> 01:53:08.847
Actually, what we should have done is first looked at your immune system, looked at your own genetic background, and then sculpted the vaccine just for you.

01:53:11.172 --> 01:53:17.017
That's where this is gonna be in 10 years or 15 years when they have bamboozled our children into accepting it.

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:20.420
If we are unsuccessful at freeing them.

01:53:22.021 --> 01:53:30.247
And these people are seeding that narrative just like Robert Malone did and lots of other people did by hinting at the fact that they can print RNA.

01:53:31.428 --> 01:53:35.592
He said that they just can print it right now and then they can just put it in their platform.

01:53:35.632 --> 01:53:36.753
Yeah, in theory.

01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:44.744
They can, but they're not using that technology to produce any of the billion batches that are going out, they can't.

01:53:45.925 --> 01:53:50.547
And he might not be sophisticated enough to know it, but his script put that in there, not me.

01:53:51.268 --> 01:53:52.568
And that's not by accident.

01:53:52.928 --> 01:54:04.374
It's there because that's gonna be one of the future fixes because they are gonna use RNA printing and it's ever decreasing cost to design a vaccine just for you and your family.

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:07.406
produce it on need, maybe.

01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:16.929
Maybe they'll just have an RNA printer in every doctor's office and they'll just make the vaccine right there on the spot, safe as sugar.

01:54:20.890 --> 01:54:31.393
Usher in a new era of true healing where we look at the truth about biology and medicine and we promote personal responsibility and we empower people.

01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:34.190
It's just an amazing opportunity.

01:54:34.451 --> 01:54:36.852
I don't want to promote personal responsibility.

01:54:36.912 --> 01:54:40.774
I want to stop the vaccine schedule because intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:54:41.455 --> 01:54:42.535
It is not medicine.

01:54:42.636 --> 01:54:50.881
And I think it is responsible for almost all of the damage that we see around us in the less than optimal health of our children and ourselves.

01:54:52.642 --> 01:54:56.024
Because ingestion is very different than injection.

01:54:56.897 --> 01:55:07.622
And the more times you've allowed somebody to trick you into taking an injection, the more likely it is that whatever's not optimum about you can be traced back to that.

01:55:08.663 --> 01:55:10.684
Of course, it would be great if you were eating better.

01:55:10.744 --> 01:55:13.065
Of course, it would be great if all of us were triathletes.

01:55:13.125 --> 01:55:19.628
Of course, it would be great if we had a lifelong track record of being active, but none of us do.

01:55:21.049 --> 01:55:24.951
But we do have a lifelong record of taking injections when we're told.

01:55:26.795 --> 01:55:29.537
and the youngest among us have taken the most.

01:55:31.438 --> 01:55:40.082
And that is a frightening place to be right now, where they have taken this population pyramid and made it even worse, almost like they chopped the bottom right out of it.

01:55:41.203 --> 01:55:55.491
Because not only do we have a non-replacement population of young people, but that young people is going to be more, probably more unhealthy than any generation America's ever seen by orders of magnitude.

01:55:58.237 --> 01:56:01.878
So my gratitude, I want to extend to all of you.

01:56:02.759 --> 01:56:05.440
We're delighted to have you with us, Andy and Tom.

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.541
Hope you will join us for our weekly Mastermind.

01:56:07.941 --> 01:56:10.962
I do want to do another plug for the Clubhouse app that we're exploring.

01:56:11.022 --> 01:56:19.226
Not that I'm promoting that, because we are working on our own private platform that will be encrypted and not with some of the connections that we have.

01:56:19.946 --> 01:56:22.767
So that's kind of a precursor, but I think these

01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:26.909
DMSO is something that when you work with it on the lab, you have to use gloves to use it.

01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:29.691
I don't understand how people are taking DMSO.

01:56:29.771 --> 01:56:30.712
I don't get it.

01:56:31.252 --> 01:56:33.994
I don't understand why people are taking methylene blue either.

01:56:35.175 --> 01:56:40.678
I don't understand the ivermectin craze except for the way that I understand it is that people get tricked into doing it.

01:56:40.738 --> 01:56:49.784
If they see enough people on social media that say ivermectin works, if they read enough books that say ivermectin works, if they see enough books on sale,

01:56:50.484 --> 01:56:51.666
that say Ivermectin works.

01:56:51.746 --> 01:56:55.951
If they see enough ads on Rumble that says Ivermectin works, maybe then they get it.

01:56:56.532 --> 01:56:57.093
I don't know.

01:56:58.835 --> 01:56:59.716
It's gotta be that.

01:56:59.756 --> 01:57:07.446
What else can it possibly be other than people just making the wrong decisions based on the wrong information provided by bad people?

01:57:13.826 --> 01:57:15.847
I really see it that way, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:15.888 --> 01:57:16.668
I see it that way.

01:57:16.708 --> 01:57:34.080
There's no explanation for why Kevin McCairn, who predicted a billion dead, who said this was worst case scenario and never says murder in America, has never said the opioid crisis, makes fun of me and Mark Kulak with a thumbnail at least every week for the last five years.

01:57:34.641 --> 01:57:41.446
Just recently on a podcast with Steve Kirsch and Kevin McKernan talking about amyloids,

01:57:42.699 --> 01:57:46.821
A thing he obviously knows nothing about other than whatever was given to him to read.

01:57:48.622 --> 01:57:50.123
Hand-pushing prions, of course.

01:57:51.664 --> 01:58:04.391
This guy told me five years ago in five consecutive streams that that dude was a bad guy, that this chick was awful, and made memes about this guy, and memes about that guy, and memes about these people.

01:58:07.012 --> 01:58:09.054
And these people have never come back to him.

01:58:09.154 --> 01:58:11.295
In fact, Mark Bailey had a very

01:58:12.546 --> 01:58:29.274
astute conversation with him in 2022 about exactly what, curiously enough, Paul Offit says that Robert F. Kennedy believes and that all of those people thought was worth debating all the way back then.

01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:31.835
It's a hamster wheel.

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:35.180
with rungs that you can start to recognize.

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.822
And as they come back, you can start to predict the ones that are gonna come again.

01:58:39.442 --> 01:58:47.567
And none of the rungs on this wheel are intramuscular injection is dumb, RNA cannot pandemic, or this was always transfection and thus criminal.

01:58:47.907 --> 01:58:49.287
None of it, none, no, none.

01:58:50.048 --> 01:58:59.853
The pandemic based on a false narrative of the population pyramids, it's never gonna come up on this hamster wheel of these people.

01:59:00.779 --> 01:59:05.668
You know, even if they could all win right now by just pointing out that, you know what they did?

01:59:06.249 --> 01:59:13.682
They knew all these people were gonna die and they swept them together a little bit and then told us a story about the fake viruses because viruses are fake.

01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.242
These guys could actually say that.

01:59:17.302 --> 01:59:18.443
You realize that, right?

01:59:18.823 --> 01:59:29.732
They could make all their arguments about why there are no viruses, and then they could edify that argument by saying, there's a real easy biological explanation for what happened.

01:59:30.253 --> 01:59:33.175
In the West, the population pyramids predicted this.

01:59:34.256 --> 01:59:35.357
We knew this was coming.

01:59:36.458 --> 01:59:44.004
And we told our kids a story about it being something else other than what it was, especially with regard to how we murdered people.

01:59:45.339 --> 02:00:00.189
So you can't absolve these people from their performances because those same people also completely ignore Jessica Rose, a person with orders of magnitude more influence on more cats than I will ever have contact with.

02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:08.555
And yet these people agreed to lambast me and attack my family and prevent my family from thriving.

02:00:12.878 --> 02:00:21.941
The same way that Jessica Rose, after a couple of years of telling me how smart I was and how great I was and how amazing my presentations are, goes on to ignore me.

02:00:23.142 --> 02:00:33.365
It's the same way that Jessica Hockett did it, the same way that Nick Hudson does it, the same way that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current Health and Human Services Secretary, apparently has been advised to do it.

02:00:36.106 --> 02:00:41.768
The unfortunate mistake is, is that I was able to hang on long enough to get my name in this book.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:01:06.450
Forever after it's gonna be a pain in the ass because I'm not shutting up Are you going to do these CD and so she used to just love me and used to just think I was brilliant and these people ignore her attacked me and now she ignores me and

02:01:07.299 --> 02:01:13.344
and hangs around with, you know, Kirsch and Burr Weinstein and all these people that she's been touring with for the last six years.

02:01:13.404 --> 02:01:22.310
And so that's her role, to make you feel heard in a Zoom meeting, make you feel heard in a Rumble video that no one will ever see and she will never share.

02:01:23.811 --> 02:01:33.699
And in the meantime, she's going to go testify in front of the Canadian NCI about VAERS five years later, just like Epigirl's script required.

02:01:35.365 --> 02:01:37.266
Nobody is in this narrative by chance.

02:01:37.866 --> 02:01:49.111
That's why we see that at the start of the pandemic, at the same church that this lady is at, is also Judy Mikovits, is also Robert Malone, is also, sorry, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:50.371 --> 02:01:51.612
And so it's all one big show.

02:01:55.339 --> 02:02:01.822
And so she's like a friendly opposition to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:02:02.442 --> 02:02:08.565
in the sense that she agrees with her 180,000 followers on YouTube that he's somebody to talk about.

02:02:09.506 --> 02:02:11.887
That he's somebody that might save us or might not.

02:02:12.447 --> 02:02:14.248
Maybe he's somebody that needs persuading.

02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:22.332
And this lady is just an unwitting participant who has a very lucrative substack.

02:02:22.392 --> 02:02:25.053
And so she just goes along with it, because, I mean, it's killing, right?

02:02:27.278 --> 02:02:29.939
It's great to be part of their little show.

02:02:30.459 --> 02:02:33.660
I don't know who this guy is, but he was recruited in the last year or so.

02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:36.501
Some epidemiologist named Nick Hustler.

02:02:37.081 --> 02:02:37.641
Hustler!

02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:38.082
Almost.

02:02:43.482 --> 02:02:50.849
And so that's also what we have here going on with the Weinsteins and with that guy Sam Seder and this person.

02:02:50.869 --> 02:02:59.237
They're just being put in place to have the discussions that they're supposed to have and test their SAG acting skills with their reactions.

02:02:59.257 --> 02:03:00.118
No way.

02:03:03.697 --> 02:03:04.478
And that's how they did it.

02:03:04.498 --> 02:03:14.069
They fooled us into solving this mystery by acting this out on podcasts and on TV and on Tucker Carlson and on Bill Maher.

02:03:15.691 --> 02:03:17.253
And it's all one malevolent show.

02:03:17.293 --> 02:03:29.705
And that's the reason why my understanding progresses so quickly in that five years, progresses during the murder, and all of their timelines do not progress at all.

02:03:30.426 --> 02:03:38.654
Their timelines could have started here in 2019, where Brandy Vaughn, a franchise player, was already able to say it better than all of them.

02:03:39.455 --> 02:03:57.206
and the CHD could have recruited her as a spokesperson, could have recruited her and promoted her as a hero, but instead they stood in front of her and collected money that would have otherwise gone to her, just like that guy Larry Cook did with his still-existent campaign, stopmandatoryvaccinations.com.

02:03:59.228 --> 02:04:04.231
Some of these slime balls even slept with people in order to absorb them.

02:04:11.161 --> 02:04:17.463
It's a very gross place that we're in right now where these people have been ignoring Brandy for so long.

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:25.965
2016 is when she first said it right on a billboard.

02:04:26.705 --> 02:04:29.306
2016 is when she first said it right on a billboard.

02:04:32.467 --> 02:04:35.807
And these people have been ignoring this franchise player ever since.

02:04:36.748 --> 02:04:37.928
Michael Jordan on the bench.

02:04:39.155 --> 02:04:40.315
Let's put other people in.

02:04:40.916 --> 02:04:42.216
Luke Longley can play.

02:04:43.397 --> 02:04:52.160
We can have some clown like this say it's a combination of genetic and environmental causes and never wanna, I don't wanna single anybody out or blame it on the parents' genetics.

02:04:53.081 --> 02:05:03.005
We can have this guy say that he has a reduced schedule or a graduated schedule, or we'll just give it a little later because vaccines are great, kinda, right?

02:05:03.065 --> 02:05:08.827
I don't have a firm stance on that at all, even though that's what you should have a firm stance on to begin with.

02:05:10.657 --> 02:05:12.998
And this lady believes that it's just glyphosate.

02:05:13.018 --> 02:05:14.159
It's for sure glyphosate.

02:05:14.179 --> 02:05:19.622
It has nothing to do with the idea that injection is so much more dangerous than ingestion.

02:05:20.003 --> 02:05:21.523
It's actually glyphosate.

02:05:21.583 --> 02:05:23.745
And she actually says that in 2017.

02:05:24.225 --> 02:05:28.848
And so Polly Tommy says it correct.

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:35.792
Well, make no mistake that the other side, without a doubt, do not want

02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:40.834
the public, the people, the parents, to hear the stories of the unvaccinated.

02:05:41.635 --> 02:05:45.679
They want us to talk about MMR, autism, Andrew Wakefield.

02:05:45.699 --> 02:05:47.480
They want that to go down.

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.183
Now, remember, Brandy's kid is an unvaccinated kid.

02:05:50.243 --> 02:05:55.147
Brandy's message was partially inspired by the fact that she was so surprised that her kid is so healthy.

02:05:55.167 --> 02:05:56.268
And these other kids are like, whoa.

02:05:57.941 --> 02:06:00.282
same path every single time because they can attack us.

02:06:00.662 --> 02:06:01.142
But you can't.

02:06:01.382 --> 02:06:07.545
And she's saying here that they want us to go there every time with autism and Andrew Wakefield because then they can attack us.

02:06:08.625 --> 02:06:14.688
And so this is a woman in 2019 who has been working with Andrew Wakefield for 20 years.

02:06:16.228 --> 02:06:17.249
Or maybe it's 15.

02:06:18.489 --> 02:06:19.450
Already had a book.

02:06:22.091 --> 02:06:23.031
And there's another book.

02:06:25.205 --> 02:06:25.446
Right?

02:06:25.946 --> 02:06:32.759
So she's still saying it correct in 2019, mostly because I think Brandy got her to say it right.

02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:34.803
Brandy gave her these words.

02:06:36.104 --> 02:06:46.254
that Andrew Wakefield is an op, that talking about autism is an op, that talking about it is always arguing things that won't convince anybody.

02:06:46.274 --> 02:06:50.878
It would be much better to go for the unvaccinated population and show how healthy they are.

02:06:51.459 --> 02:06:54.262
That is a talking point of Brandy Vaughn, I'm sure of it.

02:06:54.302 --> 02:06:56.624
That's why they had to have Paul Thomas absorb it.

02:06:57.245 --> 02:06:59.046
That's why they have, uh,

02:07:00.187 --> 02:07:02.368
James Lyons Weiler around to absorb it.

02:07:02.408 --> 02:07:05.630
That's why they're now promoting Sabine Hazan as somebody who matters.

02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:09.591
That's why they never promote Susan Humphreys.

02:07:12.433 --> 02:07:19.196
Cannot attack the generations and generations of the health of the unvaccinated.

02:07:19.956 --> 02:07:23.697
Vax2 doesn't even begin to cover the health of the unvaccinated.

02:07:23.778 --> 02:07:25.238
We uncovered so much.

02:07:25.718 --> 02:07:29.380
We uncovered generations and generations standing there saying,

02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.920
We've never had any cancer in our family.

02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:35.041
We've never had rheumatoid arthritis in our family.

02:07:35.241 --> 02:07:36.421
We've never had diabetes.

02:07:36.441 --> 02:07:39.742
We've never had any of these things that you see.

02:07:39.782 --> 02:07:47.703
So she's suggesting that a lot of these things that have been justified as genetically caused are not genetically caused.

02:07:48.223 --> 02:07:51.804
And so the flip side is, of course, that they're not genetically caused.

02:07:51.824 --> 02:07:53.624
They're caused by exposure.

02:07:54.845 --> 02:07:56.165
They're caused by disruption.

02:07:56.265 --> 02:07:57.365
They're caused by injury.

02:08:00.495 --> 02:08:07.721
So that would go against all things, you know, all things, personalized medicine go out the window then.

02:08:08.841 --> 02:08:10.983
And so she's still off message right here.

02:08:11.043 --> 02:08:15.567
She's still basically saying Andrew Wakefield is a waste and a distraction.

02:08:15.787 --> 02:08:19.550
And it's remarkable because she'll never say this again, not for five years.

02:08:20.911 --> 02:08:26.215
And she'll never be on screen again, unless she's got somebody there like Mary Holland.

02:08:26.595 --> 02:08:28.937
That are just common elderly conditions.

02:08:29.497 --> 02:08:30.318
They don't have.

02:08:30.862 --> 02:08:32.384
them in their families.

02:08:32.844 --> 02:08:42.153
And as we went deeper and deeper into the world of the unvaccinated, I could see, the team could see, this is why they don't do the vaccine study.

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:52.644
This is why they're trying to censor us and stop us, and they're petrified of these people talking, speaking out, because when the world knows about the health of the unvaccinated,

02:08:53.444 --> 02:08:54.024
Game over.

02:08:54.705 --> 02:09:07.131
Imagine saying that at the beginning, before the pandemic started, saying that, and then in the start of the pandemic, being coerced into accepting that the only message you can have is about censorship and health freedom.

02:09:10.213 --> 02:09:11.554
Because that's what happened to Polly.

02:09:11.594 --> 02:09:14.795
I don't know how or why or whatever, but she went all in.

02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:21.146
Maybe because she never dreamed that it would be this long of an operation.

02:09:21.206 --> 02:09:24.570
She thought she could move to America and it would all end.

02:09:25.712 --> 02:09:28.255
Instead, her whole schtick got recycled.

02:09:28.295 --> 02:09:34.564
Everything that she had to do for votes in the UK, she's essentially done for whatever network she's done it for here.

02:09:36.559 --> 02:09:40.841
Apparently it's the same network that really wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:09:40.861 --> 02:10:00.729
to be president, like since 2008 when they released this book with Jesse Ventura, where in the 16th chapter epilogue it is headline, Ventura spells out independent platform, challenges two leading parties to debate, Kennedy joins the debate, nuclear bombs allegedly in Iran,

02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:22.849
President declares martial law after Iranian terror bombs and then leading protesters to the White House gates Ventura is shot by a lone gunman and former governor clinging to life officials denying plight or pot and then all of a sudden you have Of course the vice president being Robert F. Kennedy jr.

02:10:22.889 --> 02:10:26.011
That's actually in this book this book right here

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:29.494
These are the headlines of the epilogue.

02:10:29.514 --> 02:10:30.114
Let me just read it.

02:10:30.194 --> 02:10:30.535
Epilogue.

02:10:30.575 --> 02:10:31.355
Glimpse of the future.

02:10:31.415 --> 02:10:31.816
Headline.

02:10:31.876 --> 02:10:34.357
Ventura says presidential candidacy is real.

02:10:34.958 --> 02:10:35.418
Headline.

02:10:35.959 --> 02:10:38.220
Ventura sets date for Iraq withdrawal.

02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:39.761
The day he takes office.

02:10:40.582 --> 02:10:40.982
Headline.

02:10:41.042 --> 02:10:43.304
Ventura spells out an independent platform.

02:10:46.566 --> 02:10:47.126
You want to see it?

02:10:47.146 --> 02:10:49.168
I think I'm full of it.

02:10:50.749 --> 02:10:51.209
Headline.

02:10:51.289 --> 02:10:54.652
Ventura challenges leading two-party contenders to a debate.

02:10:55.833 --> 02:10:56.253
Who is it?

02:10:57.108 --> 02:10:59.929
Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, McCain, Huckabee.

02:11:00.690 --> 02:11:01.470
This is in 08.

02:11:03.991 --> 02:11:10.154
Headline, as two party conventions near Maverick Independent, Ventura rises in the polls.

02:11:11.735 --> 02:11:12.775
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:11:12.835 --> 02:11:17.437
leaves Democratic Party, agrees to join Ventura as a running mate.

02:11:22.019 --> 02:11:23.600
You see why you need to buy this book?

02:11:26.152 --> 02:11:27.652
This is a Skyhorse book.

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:37.235
So you're telling me that a Skyhorse book written in 2008 is just randomly saying in an epilogue that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:11:37.275 --> 02:11:40.456
leaves the Democratic Party and agrees to join Jesse Ventura.

02:11:40.977 --> 02:11:48.019
So now it says, headline, Ventura Kennedy ticket surges in the polls.

02:11:48.339 --> 02:11:48.879
Sweet.

02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:54.441
Other candidates back down, invite Ventura and Kennedy to join the debates.

02:11:55.732 --> 02:11:56.072
U.S.

02:11:56.172 --> 02:11:59.535
bombs alleged nuclear sites in Iran.

02:12:04.239 --> 02:12:08.803
President declares martial law after Iranian terror bombs go off in five cities.

02:12:15.748 --> 02:12:19.171
Leading protesters to the White House, Ventura is shot by a lone gunman.

02:12:22.474 --> 02:12:23.875
I'm not laughing anymore, guys.

02:12:27.614 --> 02:12:29.095
I'm not, I'm not laughing anymore.

02:12:29.115 --> 02:12:31.255
This book is a sky horse book published in 2008.

02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:39.899
And a lot of these other books that titrate the truth of Brandy Vaughn were all published way before the pandemic.

02:12:39.939 --> 02:12:41.340
These people could have said it better.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:47.342
They've never been able to say it better because they've always been misled.

02:12:47.422 --> 02:12:49.943
Maybe she was misled by Wakefield for a decade too.

02:12:50.023 --> 02:12:50.483
I don't know.

02:12:50.563 --> 02:12:52.384
I don't know how to figure it out anymore.

02:12:53.104 --> 02:12:54.745
I want other people to work on this.

02:13:02.694 --> 02:13:17.082
Because these same people who, again, could have acknowledged the franchise player and the franchise player's excellent language, instead got to step in front of her and stepped in front of her at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:13:19.103 --> 02:13:21.504
And by the end of December, she would be dead, right?

02:13:21.544 --> 02:13:25.587
The December, in December, the 7th of December in 2020, she'd be dead.

02:13:26.047 --> 02:13:27.688
So these people were put in place.

02:13:27.728 --> 02:13:29.609
It's not Brandy who's out there in front.

02:13:30.666 --> 02:13:32.968
It's these people podcasting all over.

02:13:33.328 --> 02:13:38.913
It's Kevin McKernan who's on podcast after podcast talking about the PCR test.

02:13:38.993 --> 02:13:44.798
Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project and Judy Mikovits being promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:44.838 --> 02:13:46.780
from his own house in 2020.

02:13:47.681 --> 02:13:51.764
That's not using the franchise player available to you.

02:13:52.184 --> 02:13:53.986
Why isn't Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:54.026 --> 02:13:55.988
at this table with Brandy Vaughn right now?

02:13:57.242 --> 02:14:21.195
Instead at the table with somebody who collaborated with Tony Fauci and Francis or Rischetti and Gallo she ran in all the same circles that Robert Malone ran around in in those days of AIDS and Yet instead of promoting Brandi Vaughn while she's still alive in 2020.

02:14:21.856 --> 02:14:25.678
He sits down in her in his house with Judy Mikovits

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:38.502
These people took us for a ride and we are still riding with them.

02:14:40.283 --> 02:14:42.345
And the franchise players, they sit on the bench.

02:14:42.405 --> 02:14:44.026
They have to sit behind these people.

02:14:44.086 --> 02:14:46.368
These people will never help my family.

02:14:47.129 --> 02:14:52.493
These people will never help your family and they will not save our grandchildren.

02:14:52.533 --> 02:14:53.614
They are traitors to them.

02:14:54.687 --> 02:15:01.449
They are traitors to them for not telling you and explaining to you that this is murder.

02:15:01.509 --> 02:15:03.530
No, it is related, Pamela, and let me say why.

02:15:04.130 --> 02:15:08.532
Because the entire... No, it is related, Pamela, and let me say why.

02:15:08.612 --> 02:15:17.735
Now, remember, we watched this the other day as an example of what the left is going to do with this, because, again, the whole measles narrative has been set up over a decade.

02:15:19.397 --> 02:15:48.278
That's why Mary Holland was on a TV program in 2015, why the Vaxxed movie came out in 2016, and 17 came two, and 18 came two, and the World Mercury Project changed its name in 2018 to Children's Health Defense, and that's why in all that time, you never hear about Brandy Vaughn and her very simple message that ingesting a pharmaceutical is a lot safer than injecting one, and yet for some reason, we assume that injecting them is great.

02:15:49.502 --> 02:15:52.343
and we're mandating it, and we're making them more and more abundant.

02:15:52.363 --> 02:15:53.143
What are we doing?

02:15:56.465 --> 02:16:07.489
And so now we have another false good guy being inserted into the narrative that might even believe that he's good guy and just finally got his chance, but he's got the wrong message.

02:16:08.729 --> 02:16:18.073
So he's either, again, in the right place at the right time with the wrong words, or he's working against us happily as part of this team.

02:16:19.591 --> 02:16:22.974
coverage of Bobby Kennedy is around measles.

02:16:22.994 --> 02:16:26.576
The Democrats said the word measles 25 times in the first hearing.

02:16:26.797 --> 02:16:28.258
And so that's not by accident.

02:16:28.378 --> 02:16:30.459
And him pointing it out is not by accident.

02:16:30.559 --> 02:16:47.593
It is exactly what was intended and scripted all those years ago, putting Bobby Kennedy in a position about measles and his anti-vax stance to be framed in the context of the measles as a disease and the measles as a live attenuated vaccine.

02:16:47.633 --> 02:16:49.174
The whole thing was planned

02:16:49.634 --> 02:16:55.877
Because again, the limited spectrum of debate reinforces the idea that what?

02:16:56.017 --> 02:16:59.919
That intramuscular injection can be a really great way to administer medicine.

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:02.940
And that's a lie.

02:17:04.141 --> 02:17:14.405
And so this argument presupposes that there is a combination of substances that can be injected and have wonderful medical results.

02:17:14.485 --> 02:17:15.966
It's just that maybe not this one.

02:17:19.451 --> 02:17:22.273
said the words obesity, diabetes, and chronic disease, zero time.

02:17:22.613 --> 02:17:29.258
The HHS priority document under President Biden said the word equity 25 times, said the word vaccines.

02:17:30.199 --> 02:17:34.983
I really get frustrated hearing people like this talk and think they should be muzzled.

02:17:35.283 --> 02:17:36.824
And think they should be muzzled.

02:17:36.864 --> 02:17:41.667
You see, and what I want to show you with this is how far the left has gone with these young people.

02:17:41.728 --> 02:17:43.809
These are the kinds of young people I'm talking about.

02:17:44.329 --> 02:17:46.191
Although she's an actor, he's probably not.

02:17:47.284 --> 02:17:49.906
And even if they are, they kind of believe what they're saying.

02:17:50.686 --> 02:17:53.027
Otherwise they couldn't act with this much emotion.

02:17:54.909 --> 02:18:08.137
And it's terrifying really, if you think about it, because it is done precisely by the malevolent coordination of this limited spectrum of debate that it goes between Paul Offit and Callie Means.

02:18:14.659 --> 02:18:20.966
And so of course this guy then has portrayed it as being a complete win and obviously the truth is finally out there.

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:24.389
But he still is not saying intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:18:26.792 --> 02:18:28.033
And this guy's not American.

02:18:28.914 --> 02:18:34.319
But he's all over American YouTube and American social media just like John Campbell was.

02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:36.822
And just like a lot of these other foreigners were.

02:18:38.615 --> 02:18:52.466
And at some point you're going to have to realize that American social media and American discussions should not be dominated artificially by people like Russell Brand or, or Jordan Peterson or Jessica Rose or any of these other clowns.

02:18:56.789 --> 02:18:58.531
And yet it was for five years.

02:19:02.318 --> 02:19:06.101
And so nobody and nothing is in this narrative by chance.

02:19:06.161 --> 02:19:09.064
You must start there, start with that truth.

02:19:09.564 --> 02:19:14.649
And then you can start to see it because everyone has a timeline and it doesn't matter who you look at.

02:19:14.749 --> 02:19:24.077
If you just look at their timeline objectively, you're going to find out whether they progressed, who they interacted with and how that resulted in progression or not.

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:41.085
And how is it possible that Jessica Rose could have been on so many podcasts with so many people in so many groups and now be a fellow of the Brownstone Institute and a fellow of the International Medical Alliance or Independent Medical Source or whatever the hell they are.

02:19:41.905 --> 02:19:47.849
And all these other accolades and awards and whatever and have not progressed at all in her understanding of what occurred.

02:19:49.721 --> 02:19:58.947
How is it possible that Mary Holland was against the MMR vaccine or some component of it in 2015 and hasn't progressed at all in 10 years?

02:19:59.487 --> 02:20:12.255
How is it possible that Polly was saying it so well in 2019 and now, for the last five years, has said it so ham-fistedly, shittily, that she's not done anything?

02:20:14.167 --> 02:20:15.168
if not by design.

02:20:15.788 --> 02:20:38.139
How is it possible that Meryl Nass has been involved in this stuff for so long that Robert Malone and Stephen Hatfield acknowledged on Tommy's podcast that they both know her, have a long history with her, and Hatfield even said, I don't even want to talk about her.

02:20:38.199 --> 02:20:38.759
I don't like her.

02:20:40.137 --> 02:20:43.539
It's all admissions, ladies and gentlemen, that it's one big show.

02:20:43.619 --> 02:20:44.460
It's a theater.

02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:50.644
It is a mystery science theater 2025 that we are currently involved in.

02:20:50.984 --> 02:21:02.171
For the last couple of years, I've been harassed by people from Panda coordinating with somebody by the name of Jessica Hockett, because they kept making me believe that they understood what I was saying when I said RNA cannot pandemic.

02:21:02.572 --> 02:21:07.655
And it culminated in a couple of sub stacks that are going to go in a book and a lot of fake links.

02:21:08.956 --> 02:21:22.747
and a lot of citing other people and anonymous accounts and other meddlers in it that don't deserve to be cited for anything, like Vinay Prasad from Stanford, because it's all one show.

02:21:24.589 --> 02:21:28.232
And these happy little accidents are evidence of the malevolence.

02:21:29.144 --> 02:21:35.330
It's not a happy little accident that Robert Malone was testing out his schtick with Paul Cattrell in 2021.

02:21:35.850 --> 02:21:41.695
It's not some happy little accident that Kevin McCairn showed up in my town, wanted to meet me.

02:21:42.896 --> 02:21:52.105
It's not some happy accident that Charles Rixey just happened to join Drastic and want to come to my house and explain to me that the defuse proposal was definitely real.

02:21:52.505 --> 02:21:55.588
It's not by accident that my name is in this book.

02:21:58.126 --> 02:21:59.046
It's a mistake.

02:22:00.467 --> 02:22:02.127
It's a mistake that they have made.

02:22:02.227 --> 02:22:03.148
And it's an admission.

02:22:03.228 --> 02:22:21.373
And if you see all of these happy accidents, not as happy accidents, but as admissions, and then try to line them up, what really lines it up is the fact that none of them have progressed in their understanding, in their ability to message this, or in their priority of messaging.

02:22:23.152 --> 02:22:28.916
Anybody who doesn't have a priority story at this point is very suspect.

02:22:30.096 --> 02:22:35.960
And I can respect people who think that the priority story right now is the murder and lies that's happening in the Middle East.

02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:36.701
I'm fine with that.

02:22:37.501 --> 02:22:38.682
It's just not the one for me.

02:22:39.943 --> 02:22:44.726
For me, it is the long, long list of lies.

02:22:45.802 --> 02:22:50.366
about the biosecurity state and its role in our governance.

02:22:50.526 --> 02:22:52.148
That to me is most important.

02:22:52.308 --> 02:23:03.178
And this message or list of messages is most important for me to pass on to my children and those children that are around my children, because this performance is gonna go on.

02:23:03.238 --> 02:23:11.045
As long as social media is being used skillfully by our children, then they will be vulnerable to the same performance that we were vulnerable to

02:23:11.525 --> 02:23:16.146
only a much more rehearsed and reiterated and fine-tuned version of it.

02:23:16.746 --> 02:23:20.647
Every time this kind of thing is rolled out on us, it's going to be better.

02:23:22.167 --> 02:23:24.108
And that's why we just have to get off.

02:23:24.268 --> 02:23:29.209
Get off of social media or we are already trying to play their script.

02:23:32.489 --> 02:23:36.450
And so you can get off of social media and then they can't use an eclipse against you.

02:23:37.912 --> 02:23:44.556
They can't take a known natural phenomenon and fool you with it, which is what they did here.

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:58.584
They knew that the population pyramid predicted that there would be a lot of old people dying for the next decade or so, and that we didn't have a lot of people replacing them, and so that was gonna fundamentally change the economic structure of all the West.

02:24:00.165 --> 02:24:04.248
They've seen this coming for a long time, and they've planned to invert it

02:24:05.816 --> 02:24:09.879
to steal our sovereignty of our grandchildren for many decades.

02:24:09.899 --> 02:24:19.325
This is a multi-generational plan and you need to have a long enough time horizon to see that Bill Gates' father had seen it coming.

02:24:21.086 --> 02:24:24.828
That Kevin McKernan's dad was probably recruited by people who've seen it coming.

02:24:24.868 --> 02:24:29.371
That somebody like Joshua Lederberg was smart enough to see it coming.

02:24:35.239 --> 02:24:38.260
And so I'm sorry I didn't let that play, but that's basically what is happening here.

02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.481
These people performed a dinner theater and we've accepted it as real.

02:24:42.161 --> 02:24:54.345
And that dinner theater has taken a known biological phenomenon and repurposed it to teach our children a mythology about what RNA can do that it can't do.

02:24:54.865 --> 02:25:00.647
And that myth is perpetuated by these traitors because they don't address the murder.

02:25:01.806 --> 02:25:07.131
And they lie about this novel virus and how it's detected, how it's monitored.

02:25:08.592 --> 02:25:09.433
It's all the same.

02:25:10.534 --> 02:25:20.924
It's all lying about a phenomenon that there's lots of data about, just shown in very obfuscating sort of ways instead of with clarity.

02:25:21.985 --> 02:25:22.865
That's what we have here.

02:25:23.366 --> 02:25:25.388
And that's what social media allows them to do.

02:25:26.377 --> 02:25:30.861
That's what all these organizations help them to do and coordinate it on social media.

02:25:30.901 --> 02:25:31.581
That's all it is.

02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:34.744
It's a limited spectrum of debate curated by these people.

02:25:35.104 --> 02:25:47.295
And if there are a few innocent people in this picture, then those innocent people will feel the pressure that we are creating and they might finally realize what's going on and be part of the way that this gets broken.

02:25:47.975 --> 02:25:53.238
Because Denny Rancourt is curating the idea that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:56.639
He's just not telling you that there's a population pyramid signal.

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:00.641
He's pretty sure that doesn't exist, even though I can show it on a very simple graph.

02:26:00.681 --> 02:26:02.242
You can see the slope.

02:26:03.243 --> 02:26:08.445
All they had to do was sweep a little bit of this together with a little bit of murder to make it sharp.

02:26:09.166 --> 02:26:11.287
Maybe even forge some death certificates.

02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:15.603
Murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen, creates the myth of a pandemic.

02:26:15.643 --> 02:26:16.063
That's it.

02:26:16.644 --> 02:26:19.486
And a bunch of happy little accidents hides it for five years.

02:26:20.827 --> 02:26:22.369
You can see it in their timelines.

02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:26.652
The timeline of Brett Weinstein reveals it all the way up until his latest podcast.

02:26:27.193 --> 02:26:31.196
The timeline of happy accidents of Kevin McKernan also reveals it.

02:26:31.236 --> 02:26:33.779
The happy accidents of all this promotion.

02:26:34.099 --> 02:26:35.580
It's all happy little accidents.

02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:37.422
Kevin McKernan's

02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:43.121
These guys in Pananda losing my videos, it's all just happy accidents.

02:26:44.002 --> 02:26:51.324
Jessica Hockett blocking me all over the place, but saying almost everything that I'm saying, except for murder, is a happy accident.

02:26:51.904 --> 02:26:54.485
Kevin McKernan's role in this, just a happy accident.

02:26:55.984 --> 02:27:06.210
Kevin's promotion by CHD in 2024 by Mary Holland, just a happy accident that he doesn't say that intramuscular injection is dumb or that Mary doesn't question him about it.

02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:08.451
Because that would be crazy, right?

02:27:09.132 --> 02:27:10.773
It would be crazy if Mary had the

02:27:11.973 --> 02:27:19.177
Human Genome Research and Development Director on the mic and said, hey, what about the vaccine schedule in general?

02:27:19.217 --> 02:27:20.097
What do you think about that?

02:27:20.137 --> 02:27:25.500
Because I've been campaigning against some aspect of the MMR shot since 2015 and before.

02:27:32.554 --> 02:27:50.447
And instead, one month later, we have Kevin McKernan on the Danny Jones podcast lying about the writing of this book and editing me out and inserting some character that actually showed up at my house three years ago, meddled with my family three years ago.

02:27:50.768 --> 02:27:52.169
This guy's lying about it.

02:27:53.342 --> 02:27:54.463
And I want to know why.

02:27:54.543 --> 02:27:56.224
And I think you should want to know why too.

02:27:56.304 --> 02:27:58.486
I think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:27:58.526 --> 02:27:59.367
should want to know why.

02:27:59.447 --> 02:28:10.755
I think that the seller and printer of the book Skyhorse Publishing and Children's Health Defense ought to know, want to know why this guy's lying about Charles Rixey's role in the writing of that book.

02:28:10.795 --> 02:28:12.136
But instead they're promoting him.

02:28:13.838 --> 02:28:14.198
Everyone.

02:28:17.096 --> 02:28:17.897
That's how you see.

02:28:18.457 --> 02:28:23.941
Because the reason why they're doing it is because Children's Health Defense and ICANN will never tell you that the U.S.

02:28:24.001 --> 02:28:26.003
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

02:28:26.403 --> 02:28:34.590
They will never compare it to other vaccine schedules in the West and show you how it's a criminal enterprise because that would break the illusion.

02:28:36.071 --> 02:28:38.853
Like Brandy would have broken the illusion had they just put her in front.

02:28:39.972 --> 02:28:46.875
Like the list of murder would have dispelled the illusion if they would have just put it in front.

02:28:46.975 --> 02:28:50.356
If they would have just talked about the opioid crisis the other day.

02:28:50.877 --> 02:28:55.799
And for example, as my friend Mark Kulak said, if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:28:55.819 --> 02:29:03.002
would have just gone on the news and said, you know, I'm really sad that somebody has died of measles in Texas.

02:29:03.722 --> 02:29:04.983
I'm not absolutely sure.

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:06.984
Uh, what's going on there.

02:29:07.064 --> 02:29:13.726
It's a real tragedy, but a bigger tragedy is, is that 300 Americans will die today of opioids and nobody cares.

02:29:14.287 --> 02:29:20.709
And that a hundred thousand, roughly between a hundred thousand and 120,000 have died every year for the last five years.

02:29:20.769 --> 02:29:21.410
And nobody cares.

02:29:21.450 --> 02:29:27.112
So I do think that there are problems that we could address that would save more American lives than this one.

02:29:28.172 --> 02:29:29.413
And he could have just dunked.

02:29:31.121 --> 02:29:38.283
but instead he allowed Fox News to write something that looks like RFK's opinion is, is that everybody should just boost up on their measles.

02:29:39.103 --> 02:29:44.605
Even though it's not what he said, it's what Fox wrote underneath the title, RFK's Opinion.

02:29:46.445 --> 02:29:48.186
That's how we're being played here.

02:29:50.006 --> 02:29:52.667
By these people who claim to solve the mystery.

02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:56.521
And yet none of them are telling you the truth right now.

02:29:56.641 --> 02:30:04.022
None of them are telling you the truth about injection versus ingestion that, you know, you could say it like me, an intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:30:05.103 --> 02:30:14.205
They're not even gonna tell you that I exist, even though I'm listed in the book, even though they all have met me, all have podcasted with me, all have sent me love notes and letters.

02:30:16.015 --> 02:30:18.417
Because they don't want the truth to get out, ladies and gentlemen.

02:30:18.457 --> 02:30:23.061
They do not want the truth that intramuscular injection is dumb transfection and healthy humans was always criminal.

02:30:23.441 --> 02:30:27.224
That there's no safe vaccine, that intramuscular injection of medicine is a lie.

02:30:27.865 --> 02:30:29.406
They don't want you to realize.

02:30:30.107 --> 02:30:37.974
And the way that you can figure it out is look at their time, look at their calendar, fill it out for every one of them and you will find the truth.

02:30:38.614 --> 02:30:40.456
And then you can pass that on to your grandkids.

02:30:41.271 --> 02:30:43.773
That's what I hope this stream will inspire everybody to do.

02:30:44.313 --> 02:30:48.956
I hope it will inspire you to double check what these people really did because they haven't done anything.

02:30:49.577 --> 02:30:51.238
They are working for the slavers.

02:30:51.298 --> 02:30:54.741
They speak slave speak because this is about your grandchildren.

02:30:54.781 --> 02:30:55.741
It's for all the marbles.

02:30:56.162 --> 02:31:00.205
That's why they've never told you the truth about ingestion versus injection.

02:31:00.645 --> 02:31:02.626
That's why they've never told you the truth.

02:31:03.067 --> 02:31:06.349
That's why they won't tell you that PCR is a diagnostic, is a fraud.

02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:07.790
That's why they won't explain that.

02:31:08.310 --> 02:31:15.655
all of these companies already could make synthetic recombinant genes and genetics and grow stuff because that's how biologics are made.

02:31:16.075 --> 02:31:18.817
And so making a transfection would have been really easy.

02:31:19.197 --> 02:31:30.844
In fact, also planting any sequence they wanted to and guaranteeing that you would find it wherever they wanted to find it could have been done simply using a synthetic recombinant pure signal made in quantity

02:31:31.384 --> 02:31:33.565
and released by an agent in Wuhan.

02:31:34.065 --> 02:31:37.207
They did this because transfection would be a crime otherwise.

02:31:37.247 --> 02:31:38.307
They had to do it this way.

02:31:38.347 --> 02:31:39.368
They had to lie about it.

02:31:39.848 --> 02:31:42.629
And the way they got away with it, I think, has to do with placebo.

02:31:42.649 --> 02:31:46.611
That's why the no-virus people like Andy Kaufman didn't explain it right.

02:31:46.651 --> 02:31:48.772
That's why Kevin McCarran didn't explain it right.

02:31:48.832 --> 02:31:50.493
Kevin McKernan didn't explain it right.

02:31:50.953 --> 02:31:52.094
And why the VAERS queen

02:31:53.415 --> 02:31:57.398
Jessica Rose has never explained it right because they don't want to tell you the truth.

02:31:57.479 --> 02:31:58.580
They can't tell you the truth.

02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:01.302
And if they did, this whole thing would be over.

02:32:01.442 --> 02:32:11.551
Even the no virus people can't succinctly explain that endemicity is a joke because endemicity means that an RNA can start in a mud puddle and then be everywhere forever.

02:32:13.493 --> 02:32:15.335
And that would only be true if we were doing it.

02:32:16.044 --> 02:32:18.506
would only be true if those signals were actually our own.

02:32:19.026 --> 02:32:22.888
They can't be pattern integrities on their own because RNA is not a pattern integrity.

02:32:22.928 --> 02:32:23.969
They can't pandemic.

02:32:24.409 --> 02:32:28.232
And they could have done this with nonspecific PCR tests that pick up the background.

02:32:29.032 --> 02:32:30.393
And all of these people know it.

02:32:31.214 --> 02:32:34.035
And that's why I call them liars, because I think that's what they are.

02:32:34.656 --> 02:32:35.817
They're all just liars.

02:32:36.297 --> 02:32:38.879
And it's really unfortunate, but they really are.

02:32:38.919 --> 02:32:41.000
They're all just plain and simple.

02:32:42.739 --> 02:32:43.800
They're all just liars.

02:32:44.861 --> 02:32:45.722
It's so depressing.

02:32:46.002 --> 02:32:46.603
It really is.

02:32:46.683 --> 02:32:47.944
Sometimes it's really depressing.

02:32:49.225 --> 02:32:49.986
I don't know what to do.

02:32:51.687 --> 02:33:01.637
But I guess I gotta just keep going and I gotta hope that more people will support and keep this going until we can pivot to teaching the Biology 101 and know that these people are exposed.

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:09.508
I can't stop until this past is guaranteed not to fade away, until it is recorded and archived and becomes common knowledge.

02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:12.171
Thank you very much for being here.

02:33:12.191 --> 02:33:16.817
I will see you again as soon as I have a slide deck worthy of presenting.

02:33:17.017 --> 02:33:17.338
Thank you.

02:33:17.378 --> 02:33:17.618
Thank you.

02:33:35.302 --> 02:33:36.824
Thank you very much for being here, guys.

02:33:40.888 --> 02:33:42.149
I really appreciate it.

02:33:44.151 --> 02:33:46.914
I got a lot of good books to read in the next coming weeks.

02:33:47.594 --> 02:33:51.739
The History of Virology by Waterston and Wilkinson is a good book.

02:33:53.829 --> 02:33:59.774
Virus Diseases by Rivers Stanley Kunkel Schoep.

02:33:59.874 --> 02:34:03.056
Horse Fall and Ruse is a really interesting book.

02:34:04.037 --> 02:34:06.239
Rinderpest.

02:34:06.639 --> 02:34:09.461
This is a book from very early 1900s in America.

02:34:09.481 --> 02:34:16.347
And then this Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology book about virology from the early 80s.

02:34:17.488 --> 02:34:19.569
A coronavirus meeting in the Netherlands.

02:34:20.570 --> 02:34:30.278
These books are going to help us to figure out where this illusion started to become just an assumption and how it was weaponized against us.

02:34:30.939 --> 02:34:34.922
I'm really optimistic that this is far from over.

02:34:35.803 --> 02:34:38.866
It's just sometimes so hard to swim in this.

02:34:39.726 --> 02:34:42.750
It's really like a nasty taint that I feel after I'm here.

02:34:43.371 --> 02:34:47.695
And so I need to go to the gym right now and get a couple hundred jump shots in.

02:34:47.735 --> 02:34:48.436
Thank you very much.

02:34:48.556 --> 02:34:49.958
I'll see you again as soon as possible.

02:34:49.998 --> 02:34:50.478
I promise.

02:34:50.979 --> 02:34:53.302
I just don't want to just stream to stream.

02:34:53.862 --> 02:34:58.628
I want to have a succinct message even if it takes two hours and 31 minutes to get it out.

02:34:58.688 --> 02:34:59.449
Thanks very much guys.
