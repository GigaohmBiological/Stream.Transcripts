WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
Okay, we're going to try something here.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.560
I may have figured it out.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.720
Something may have happened with the monitor.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
How are we looking?

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
Is that okay?

00:15.720 --> 00:17.360
Talk to me, Goose.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
Yeah?

00:18.360 --> 00:20.720
Did we figure it out?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.320
Oh, bless your heart.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.880
Thank you, sir.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.880
All right.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.760
I'm just going to run in a quick introduction here then.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.880
That's great.

00:32.880 --> 00:50.880
What do you mean no video?

00:50.880 --> 01:04.880
The family says it's perfect.

01:04.880 --> 01:08.960
I know this start, no one's kind of lame, but I like the video to be okay for the next

01:08.960 --> 01:12.000
person that falls on and I'll do a real quick intro, I promise.

01:20.880 --> 01:26.880
Still looking good?

01:26.880 --> 01:30.880
Still looking good?

01:30.880 --> 01:33.440
All right.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.240
Sweet.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.440
I figured it out.

01:37.440 --> 01:44.880
I think that might have been a problem for longer than all of you people have been telling

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
me.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.880
What kind of chumps are you?

01:47.880 --> 01:51.120
You were telling me that it was out of sync.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.760
You should have been telling me a long time ago, I think.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.760
Darn it.

01:55.760 --> 02:02.800
Maybe not a long time ago, but a little while ago I changed settings on my big monitor and

02:02.800 --> 02:10.840
I didn't realize that that was challenging OBS to render it at a greater resolution on

02:10.840 --> 02:11.840
my screen.

02:11.840 --> 02:22.560
So that was actually taxing OBS just for this, just for me to see it, which is really funny.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.960
I totally built.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
So that was what it was.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.960
Zoinks.

02:28.960 --> 02:34.120
I used to be able to do that before my voice was destroying my mic.

02:34.120 --> 02:40.120
Well, thanks for coming back.

02:40.120 --> 02:47.840
Rodney Mullen recently had some surgery and is recovering and feeling like a million dollars

02:47.840 --> 02:52.520
and has had less pain in his legs and hips than he's had in years.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.080
I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you that, but I'm telling you anyway.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.000
I love that man.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.120
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to GIGO and biological.

03:05.120 --> 03:10.480
This is take three.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.840
Take three on the 12th of October, 2023.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.960
And yeah, I do sound different from JC on a bike because my voice is destroyed.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.240
I don't have the voice that I had when I was JC on a bike.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.040
It was deeper and louder and more powerful.

03:29.040 --> 03:34.080
I could blow the windows out of a car and now I can barely talk.

03:34.080 --> 03:40.240
I'm pretty sure it happened after I shook hands with Andrew Huff, but I don't know.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.480
I'm not going to blame it on anybody.

03:43.480 --> 03:50.760
But they are misleading the young.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.760
It was all that shouting in the corridors, perhaps indeed.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.560
Learn your history, ladies and gentlemen.

03:58.560 --> 04:05.400
Learn your biology is really important because the bricks at the back of the theater are

04:05.400 --> 04:16.360
visible and these things are true and I'm just going to flip through these real quick

04:16.360 --> 04:20.640
because, you know, I made a mistake a couple of times with this setup.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.200
It takes a while to learn how to do all this stuff.

04:25.200 --> 04:32.480
I don't want to, you know, toot anybody's horn for streaming.

04:32.480 --> 04:38.600
But you know, there's a little bit of finesse, there's a little bit of power point, there's

04:38.600 --> 04:41.440
a little bit of this, there's a little bit of that.

04:41.440 --> 04:47.320
It's an investment in time and energy that not everybody tends to put in.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.360
And I had it a little bit here and a little bit there.

04:50.360 --> 04:54.400
Thanks to my friend Hunter, I've been able to get a bunch of stuff out of the garbage

04:54.400 --> 04:59.840
can and that has really led to me having a pretty decent setup, but it acts funny

04:59.840 --> 05:05.400
because these items are not supposed to sing together the way they're singing together.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.840
And I keep making little changes that make it necessary to for me to relearn the thing

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
a little bit.

05:11.840 --> 05:20.240
But don't take the bait on social media and on TV, the bait is, of course, this enticing

05:20.240 --> 05:22.760
mystery that we need to solve.

05:22.800 --> 05:32.480
And it is really, it is something that we have been lured into by a very elaborate theater.

05:32.480 --> 05:39.320
And so it is this elaborate theater that once we have identified it, once you see the bricks

05:39.320 --> 05:45.400
at the back of the theater, it's our job to take apart the scenery and try to argue for

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
a refund, right?

05:46.400 --> 05:52.200
I mean, that's really where we should be thinking we are.

05:52.200 --> 06:03.520
And I started the previous two untimed streams with this idea that there were influencers

06:03.520 --> 06:14.080
on both sides of the narrative that were courting and coercing and cajoling people to believe

06:14.080 --> 06:20.360
what they wanted them to believe, not just on our side, not just the people that I've

06:20.400 --> 06:22.800
been talking about over here.

06:22.800 --> 06:28.280
But there are also people on the Fauci side who got into arguments.

06:28.280 --> 06:34.280
And on the Fauci side with with with Z dog that got into arguments about who's right

06:34.280 --> 06:37.920
and who's wrong and who's extreme and who isn't.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.080
And those people, as they argued, agreed that those people over there who are arguing are

06:43.080 --> 06:45.800
really crazy.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.120
And so when I show this illusion of consensus about gain of function viruses and about a

06:50.120 --> 06:56.800
lab leak, I'm really only showing you half of the, of the, in a cartoon, it would be

06:56.800 --> 07:02.840
this cloud of smoke and dust with like spiraling things going around it.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.560
It's this argument over here and then an argument over here and the agreement that you were

07:07.560 --> 07:11.800
in the right argument there in the wrong argument.

07:11.800 --> 07:17.440
So it's much more enticing than even just natural virus or lab leak, but it's the argument

07:17.440 --> 07:21.240
that occurred over here that was different than the argument that occurred over on our

07:21.240 --> 07:24.520
side.

07:24.520 --> 07:30.000
And parts of this illusion have been revealed as we've, we've tried to push through the

07:30.000 --> 07:32.120
weeds here.

07:32.120 --> 07:39.200
And you know, it, it, it happens that we've made very good friends with Denny Rancour

07:39.200 --> 07:46.440
and that he's doing a really good job of dispelling this mythology of a spreading viral

07:46.440 --> 07:49.600
pathogen.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.880
And we've had him on the show a couple times and more recently he was actually on Kim

07:53.880 --> 07:54.880
Iverson's show.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.560
And so I just wanted to play this again.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.480
I know if you've seen it, I apologize, I won't play much.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.480
It's only like four minutes.

08:02.480 --> 08:08.240
But it's really important to get it on here because Kim really does push back and actually

08:08.240 --> 08:13.640
does try to bait him about, you know, is there a virus or not and to get him to defend

08:13.640 --> 08:15.560
that position.

08:15.560 --> 08:21.200
And almost like an a keto master like Steven Segal, Kim Iverson is just on the mat.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.800
You don't even really know how it happened.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.320
And I am making a little joke there.

08:25.320 --> 08:31.520
Of course, I don't think Steven Segal and his I keto are, I don't know what they are.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.000
But anyway, I just started throwing it in there.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.440
I want to debate about that.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.440
I love a keto.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.800
Were there areas that had massive spikes of the virus the same as let's say Northern

08:40.800 --> 08:45.360
Italy or New York, but who did not use any of those treatment protocols, but stuck with

08:45.360 --> 08:48.880
the tried and true of how you deal with the respiratory illness.

08:48.880 --> 08:56.840
And yeah, okay, so that spike that initial spike you caused it due to the virus.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.600
You understand I'm arguing it's not due to a virus at all.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.600
It's due to the what with the measures that were applied.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.400
That's what killed people.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.160
What I'm saying though is that but but we did see a spot.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.960
I mean, are you I guess first we have to ask, do you believe that COVID-19 as a virus exists

09:13.960 --> 09:17.680
at all that SARS-CoV-2 exists?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.240
I think that question is irrelevant.

09:19.240 --> 09:26.040
What I'm trying to say is all the data that is a firm hard all-cause mortality data is

09:26.040 --> 09:31.120
inconsistent with the idea of a particularly virulent at the gym that spreads.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.200
It's inconsistent with that.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.080
So you can believe that there's a whole spectrum of viruses and bacteria, whatever

09:38.080 --> 09:44.320
you want, but there was nothing special or new in terms of these pathogens that did anything

09:44.320 --> 09:47.440
that spreads that the data is inconsistent with that.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.400
So you don't have to get into the question of whether or not viruses exist and all these

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
exotic things.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.640
I don't even want to touch that.

09:54.640 --> 10:02.800
I'm just saying my view of the data is that this is not a spreading pathogen period.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800
It's inconsistent with that.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.960
It's disproved by the data.

10:06.960 --> 10:12.800
But you asked the question, well, were there places where they weren't applying these these

10:12.800 --> 10:16.480
these very horrendous protocols and that still had spikes?

10:16.480 --> 10:22.440
Well, our data we've done studies about this and for example, Germany did not apply these

10:22.440 --> 10:23.840
fancy protocols.

10:23.840 --> 10:28.760
Germany did business as usual and had zero peak at the beginning of the pandemic.

10:29.240 --> 10:33.840
There is no signal there whatsoever in the entire territory of Germany.

10:33.840 --> 10:40.520
So when you make a map of Europe and you put colors on for the intensity of that peak,

10:40.520 --> 10:46.560
it's red in northern France, for example, around London, around Madrid.

10:46.560 --> 10:52.440
There's these horrible red spots and it does not cross the border into Germany whatsoever.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.440
Germany stays white on the map, if you like.

10:54.440 --> 11:00.080
But I guess what I'm saying is that, you know, as they were tracking the virus itself

11:00.080 --> 11:04.920
and the spread of the virus, they were saying then that the answer to that would be, well,

11:04.920 --> 11:08.440
because Germany had taken all these measures that they weren't getting the virus into their

11:08.440 --> 11:11.000
country yet, that it hadn't spread into Germany.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.480
So if it was spreading in Italy, but not in Germany, then of course, Italy would see the

11:15.480 --> 11:18.800
spikes in Germany, wouldn't you can wave your hands like that.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.840
Okay, first of all, I don't believe that they were they weren't tracking mortality.

11:23.840 --> 11:30.800
They may have been tracking something that they call, you know, cases of COVID or whatever

11:30.800 --> 11:35.480
with these very suspicious tests that they were using and so on.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.880
They can do all of that and they can count cases.

11:37.880 --> 11:42.440
I put all that aside and I look at mortality because it's the only thing that I'm sure

11:42.440 --> 11:48.040
of and it's something you can measure and be certain of and all the jurisdictions do it.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.680
And when I look at mortality, there is no evidence of any spread.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.880
There's evidence of bursts of mortality when you start doing something.

11:57.880 --> 12:03.360
So right right at the beginning, when you started applying these aggressive protocols,

12:03.360 --> 12:08.920
you had certain hotspots that had peaks, that mortality did not spread.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.280
It didn't then spread throughout the end.

12:12.280 --> 12:16.680
So you're saying it doesn't matter if there was a virus or not circulating because you're

12:16.680 --> 12:20.280
not even looking at that you're looking at deaths and only deaths.

12:20.280 --> 12:25.200
And when you look at mortality and the deaths in areas, you're not seeing deaths spread

12:25.200 --> 12:30.080
from one region to a next to a next that would indicate that something was spreading around

12:30.080 --> 12:31.080
killing people.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
That's right.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.200
Now, Kim, in fact, I see the opposite.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.200
That's what's important.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.280
I see the opposite.

12:37.280 --> 12:44.720
I see the US, which has a very large number of very vulnerable people that did die in

12:44.720 --> 12:53.400
the US, the excess mortality during the COVID period correlates perfectly with the poverty,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.520
the number of people living in poverty in the state.

12:55.520 --> 13:00.360
You get this incredible correlation line that goes through the origin of Pearson correlation

13:00.360 --> 13:05.720
coefficient of 0.86, which is unheard of.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.400
And so it was poor people who died, and especially in the southern states.

13:09.400 --> 13:14.720
Now, you cross this thousand kilometers of border between Canada and the US, and there

13:14.720 --> 13:18.520
were no deaths in Canada in that whole period, virtually none.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.440
You can hardly detect the excess mortality in Canada compared to the United States.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.440
That's impossible.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.960
These are two of the biggest trading partners in the world.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.280
The highways were open.

13:29.280 --> 13:34.800
It's impossible that a virus that is said to have been spreading did not want to cross

13:34.800 --> 13:36.200
the border to Canada.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
Same thing.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.960
You'll have the Trudeau's of the world and all the Trudeau's supporters saying, well,

13:41.960 --> 13:47.120
that's because we implemented some serious protocols that prevented people from traveling.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.640
You couldn't even travel in Canada.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.400
You guys were in major lockdown, unlike what we were here in the United States.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.200
Lockdown levels that you guys experienced was much harsher.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.680
So they would say, I would think that you can always wave your hands and say that kind

14:00.680 --> 14:01.680
of thing.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.560
If you believe that it is a pandemic causing virus, you cannot believe that it will refuse

14:08.560 --> 14:10.440
across a border like that.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
That's just incredible.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.000
There's no signs that makes any sense if you want to believe that.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.480
But also, in one of our studies, which I co-authored, the lead author was John Johnson from Harvard

14:21.480 --> 14:26.520
University, and we authored a paper where we looked at states in the United States and

14:26.520 --> 14:30.720
we compared neighboring states that share a border, one that locked down and the other

14:30.720 --> 14:32.200
didn't.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.080
And they were comparable otherwise.

14:34.080 --> 14:39.760
We found 12 pairs of states like that that you could directly compare, and we found unambiguously

14:39.760 --> 14:45.040
that the lockdowns states have these large excess mortalities, which were not present

14:45.040 --> 14:50.400
in the non-lockdown neighbor that shared a border with it, and that was republished.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.960
So that makes sense to me, except how do you explain that my guess is the hospitals were

14:56.960 --> 14:58.720
not overwhelmed in Canada, right?

14:58.720 --> 15:05.120
So it's like, the people still have to show up, I mean, they don't magically, they can't

15:05.120 --> 15:07.960
magically use a ventilator, right?

15:07.960 --> 15:13.240
Canada has large cities and large hospitals, and they were claiming the same kinds of problems

15:13.240 --> 15:18.400
of overwork and over this and over that in Canada as anywhere, any other major city in

15:18.400 --> 15:19.400
the world.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.240
So, just because it's a big country and a relatively small population doesn't mean

15:25.240 --> 15:29.280
still, but the population is concentrated in cities, right?

15:29.280 --> 15:34.440
So there's no way to explain.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.240
He goes on there to explain further, you can find that.

15:37.240 --> 15:45.080
Maybe I should just drop this quickly in the chatty chat here for you, or did somebody

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
already do that?

15:46.080 --> 15:55.600
I didn't see anybody had done that yet, so let me see if I can do that.

15:55.600 --> 16:03.040
There you go, that's the rumble we just watched.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.760
So another thing happened that I thought was really cool, yesterday you will recall that

16:06.760 --> 16:17.560
I did a second video of Campbell and Gleesh that was talking more about the immunology,

16:17.560 --> 16:22.440
but more about the origins of the virus and how they were locked dead Scooby-Doo mystery

16:22.440 --> 16:29.920
100% dead on balls accurate, to the point where actually he admitted the other guest

16:29.920 --> 16:36.320
of Campbell that he had been on board with Dr. Quay for a very long time early on.

16:36.320 --> 16:46.520
And I can't express adequately how it is that I am skeptical of everybody who zeroed

16:46.520 --> 16:52.040
in on a fear and cleavage site in February or even January of 2020.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.200
It's just absurd.

16:54.200 --> 17:02.800
And what I also said in that video yesterday was that there were a few parts of that video

17:02.800 --> 17:12.520
that these two people would cue in on and not even 24 hours later, Dan Wilson releases

17:12.520 --> 17:17.400
a video, what went wrong with John Campbell with none other than Susan Oliver.

17:17.400 --> 17:22.920
Now, you can actually see a conspiracy here because it's almost impossible for him to

17:22.920 --> 17:26.400
have produced this yesterday.

17:26.400 --> 17:33.320
I guess he could have, but it's almost like we communicated like he it's crazy and I just

17:33.320 --> 17:37.000
want to play a little bit of Susan Oliver's story.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.480
I don't know how much we can take, but it's really instructive that all of these people

17:44.480 --> 17:49.440
basically have the same story.

17:49.440 --> 17:54.520
They wandered into biology with no good idea of what they were going to do.

17:54.520 --> 18:00.080
They wandered into biology with the idea of making money and they learned very quickly

18:00.080 --> 18:06.000
that you can't make money as a postdoc and so neither of them did a postdoc.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.040
And they went on to work in some industry and Susan Oliver will at the end of this video

18:12.040 --> 18:17.880
even admit that she saved up so much money during her time and industry that she's able

18:17.880 --> 18:22.120
to sell fund her YouTube escapades.

18:22.120 --> 18:28.000
I think it's instructive to listen to this because again, these two are two that might

18:28.000 --> 18:33.880
have a disagreement about Ibermectin and yet because they agree that everybody should be

18:33.880 --> 18:38.720
vaccinated and then Australia should have locked down and that's why they saved so many lives

18:38.720 --> 18:40.880
and yada yada yada.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.160
They can disagree about something in order to make it seem as though there's a healthy

18:45.160 --> 18:49.080
debate going on even on YouTube.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
Even carefully.

18:50.080 --> 18:57.640
The internet was or on YouTube I should say was this week in virology, this week in virology

18:57.640 --> 19:01.640
and I'd actually got that via Facebook and so it started.

19:01.640 --> 19:06.920
So she's saying that the first people that she found during the pandemic on YouTube was

19:06.920 --> 19:12.720
this week in virology which is already sketchy and then she's going to go on to say how she

19:12.720 --> 19:18.120
got mixed up with John Campbell and then eventually decided to make her own YouTube channel.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.960
It's really compelling.

19:19.960 --> 19:23.120
I subscribed to that and started watching it and prior to that I'd never watched YouTube

19:23.120 --> 19:27.880
at all and then slowly YouTube started recommending other channels.

19:27.880 --> 19:33.240
One of them of course was yours which I also started watching but the other one was Dr.

19:33.240 --> 19:39.640
John Campbell and at the time he was being quite reasonable.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.400
He was pretty much just presenting stats from around the world.

19:43.400 --> 19:48.800
It wasn't particularly technical but it was a fairly good way to keep up to date with

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
exactly what was happening.

19:49.800 --> 19:55.320
So I started watching his channel and he said something about Australia and he just got

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
it completely wrong.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.760
It wasn't intentional, he just didn't understand basically.

20:00.760 --> 20:05.680
So I thought why don't I just send him a little email and let him know what he got wrong.

20:05.680 --> 20:10.600
So I sent him an email explaining that what he said wasn't actually correct.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.000
And sort of misinterpreted what our chief medical officer had said and I said no he

20:15.000 --> 20:17.800
didn't actually mean this, explain what he meant.

20:17.800 --> 20:25.240
And then at the time Dr. Campbell was also, he'd been sort of showing us a photo of people

20:25.240 --> 20:29.000
wearing masks at the end of his video site that they sent him.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.200
So I'd also sent him a photo of me in the lab, I had a pig lab coat on and I was wearing

20:33.200 --> 20:37.200
a pig mask and I said look I'm not sure if you're still showing photos of people but

20:37.200 --> 20:39.080
if you are he's one of me.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.000
So anyway the next day he did correct himself, he did show the photo of me in the mask.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.960
So I don't know why it's breaking up, maybe the recording didn't go very well but here

20:49.960 --> 20:57.800
you see her tell the story that she actually became interested in being an internet personality

20:57.800 --> 21:05.480
upon interacting with John Campbell and sending him a picture of her with a mask on so that

21:05.480 --> 21:08.640
he could use it in his stream.

21:08.640 --> 21:12.000
Here you're going to find that he made some mistakes and then she realized that he was

21:12.000 --> 21:19.360
an idiot but at first it was kind of her idol, she was excited and here at the end maybe

21:19.360 --> 21:24.240
if it's not too horrible we can hear the end of this video.

21:24.240 --> 21:31.840
Many many videos have been removed by YouTube, many men were actually debunking it so I thought

21:31.840 --> 21:37.440
this time I'll because I think I sort of think it was something like calm, the initial title

21:37.440 --> 21:42.800
was something like effective being monkey kidney cells or something so I think maybe

21:42.800 --> 21:47.280
they probably read the title and said oh she's saying it's effective without actually realizing

21:47.280 --> 21:51.920
this is her first YouTube video I got pulled from YouTube and I did quite a few more and they

21:51.920 --> 21:57.920
all stayed up and here we are although obviously during that time many many videos have been

21:57.920 --> 21:59.760
removed by YouTube.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.920
So what a weird story right many many videos have been removed from YouTube, her first

22:03.920 --> 22:08.480
YouTube video which is about Ibermectin was removed and then she did many videos that

22:08.480 --> 22:13.840
didn't get removed so she kept doing it but in the meantime many many videos got removed.

22:14.720 --> 22:19.360
It's such a weird story that it almost sounds like a lie.

22:20.480 --> 22:25.200
So I thought this time I'll because I think I sort of think it was something like calm,

22:25.840 --> 22:31.440
the initial title was something like effective being monkey kidney cells or something so I

22:31.440 --> 22:36.000
think maybe they probably read the title and said oh she's saying it's effective without actually

22:36.000 --> 22:40.480
realizing what else what I was doing so the next one stayed up and I did quite a few more

22:40.480 --> 22:46.960
and they all stayed up and here we are although obviously during that time many many videos have

22:46.960 --> 22:54.400
been removed by YouTube. Many many appeals have been rejected but luckily the...

22:54.400 --> 23:02.720
Do you see it? It's this illusion that even she has suffered from the censorship even he has

23:02.720 --> 23:08.240
suffered from the censorship. It's not like the censorship was just applied to one side.

23:08.240 --> 23:16.320
We these people also got censored because they're part of this healthy debate and the evidence for

23:16.320 --> 23:25.680
it is their censorship. Don't you see? It's the same evidence that we have. It's the same evidence

23:25.680 --> 23:32.720
that we have that Robert Malone is obviously correct because of his censorship. The reason why

23:32.720 --> 23:40.320
Steve Kirsch is obviously correct is because he gets censored and labeled as the biggest misinformation

23:40.320 --> 23:49.280
spreader on the internet. Do you see it? They're all playing the same cards and it doesn't matter

23:49.280 --> 23:55.600
whether they're playing to the MSNBC crowd or the Fox News crowd or the Glenn Beck crowd.

23:55.600 --> 24:03.920
It's the same crowd. You should believe in me because I was censored. You should understand

24:03.920 --> 24:09.280
that I'm a critical thinker because critical thinking is censored and believe it or not

24:09.280 --> 24:15.120
the people that watch the view are being fooled by the same narrative as the people who watch

24:15.120 --> 24:23.040
Tucker Carlson. Censorship points to the answer. Do you see it? It's extraordinary.

24:24.720 --> 24:29.520
Such a media team on Twitter seemed to be reasonably booked now at getting them reinstated and they

24:29.520 --> 24:34.720
did eventually even reinstate the whole other marketing video that was my best video so that's

24:34.720 --> 24:42.720
now back after all this and so that's a rather long story to as to how I did it and I wanted to

24:42.720 --> 24:49.360
why I ended up not getting another job when Australia reopened again was I realized how much I love

24:49.360 --> 24:57.040
not working. That is true to be fair I was also censored but I believe the trick is to see what

24:57.040 --> 25:03.840
was censored because YouTube never ever ever and still hasn't censored any of my stuff.

25:05.520 --> 25:10.640
We're gone the bike. All the stuff about gain of function on the bike all the stuff about a

25:10.640 --> 25:16.960
lab leak on the bike it's still there. Never once did I get a strike on that stuff. What I got a

25:16.960 --> 25:22.720
strike on was when I started teaching immunology in my backyard what I got a strike on is when I

25:22.720 --> 25:28.400
started walking through the park here in Pittsburgh talking about the New World Order

25:28.560 --> 25:38.480
but definitely when I started talking about the biology on my back in my backyard on my table

25:39.680 --> 25:44.080
that that's when I got censored and I started taking a lot of things down because I wasn't

25:44.080 --> 25:49.280
sure what was going to get my next strike and if you get three you're done and that's why I

25:49.280 --> 25:56.400
pretty much have left JC on a bike the channel alone it's the only evidence I've got of where I

25:56.480 --> 26:06.960
was in March or February of 2020 so yeah you're right but I was being censored once I started

26:06.960 --> 26:13.120
speaking out about certain things and then I sort was led to believe that that censorship

26:13.120 --> 26:18.640
might be because I was speaking out about a lab leak but I kind of knew in my gut it was because

26:18.640 --> 26:25.520
I was speaking out about the the irrelevance of a lab leak and the fact that immunology says

26:25.600 --> 26:29.680
that we're going to be fine because RNA viruses are RNA viruses let's listen to her finish because

26:29.680 --> 26:36.400
it's really comical I just love the fact that I no longer set my alarm in the morning I do actually

26:36.400 --> 26:41.280
have it said it's seven thirty as I could fail say so that I don't just waste too much time in

26:41.280 --> 26:46.160
Ben but I used to get up when I was working like about ten to six every morning and I was away

26:48.160 --> 26:54.480
and so I'm really loving the fact that I just don't have to do that anymore and so yes I thought

26:54.480 --> 27:00.320
I don't actually I sort of when when I was working I was fairly smart we're investing my

27:00.320 --> 27:04.720
money and everything so which is obviously why I could afford to go back and get a PhD because

27:04.720 --> 27:10.320
as you know you don't want to get paid a lot of money when you're doing a PhD so I didn't need

27:10.320 --> 27:16.000
to work for money like even so the last three years when I was on the contract everything I

27:16.000 --> 27:22.800
learned is in the back I didn't spend any of it so I figured I don't actually need the money so

27:22.800 --> 27:29.040
I'm really enjoying not working so I'm not gonna work anymore that's totally understandable and

27:29.040 --> 27:36.880
that's all great I mean so so she's not working anymore she's just uh just making sure that they

27:37.200 --> 27:40.240
stay on narrative right that's what she does

27:53.120 --> 28:02.560
we're gonna go um we're gonna go into the archives of jc on a bike and we're gonna open up a video

28:02.560 --> 28:12.000
that I put on private in march of 2020 and we're gonna watch where I was this is taxi in case you

28:12.000 --> 28:27.920
care

28:32.240 --> 28:37.040
now you guys are all talking about the taxi song so I got to let it play out

28:42.880 --> 28:52.800
so let's bring this window up over here and this window and we'll go to

28:54.400 --> 29:00.560
I'll just float over here quick bring this up I don't know what I'm gonna reveal if I do that but

29:00.560 --> 29:08.880
I'm gonna do it anyway and we'll go over here and we'll go to youtube studio and we'll go to content

29:09.840 --> 29:16.640
and we'll go down here and we're gonna look for jc in the woods episode one

29:24.880 --> 29:32.240
now this is not going to be a typical show um because jc on jc in the woods episode one is not

29:32.240 --> 29:38.800
about biology but it's just you know where was I what was I doing besides this and this is

29:40.000 --> 29:46.240
what day is this I believe this is march let's just look at this on youtube here

29:48.160 --> 29:50.080
I believe this is

29:55.920 --> 30:01.520
march 18th 2020 now the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go back to youtube studio

30:02.400 --> 30:09.920
we're gonna go back to channel content and we're gonna take this youtube jc on a bike and we're

30:09.920 --> 30:23.680
gonna take it from private and we're gonna make it public public public publish and now we're

30:23.680 --> 30:27.920
gonna go back over here and we're gonna take this and we're gonna copy it out and we're gonna put

30:27.920 --> 30:35.920
it down here so that you guys can share it and here we go let's see what this video is all about

30:40.240 --> 30:46.560
hi this is jc on a bike oh you're fast start a new series holy crap look at how fatty is this

30:46.560 --> 30:51.040
series is going to be a storytelling series it's a little bit of american history and a little bit

30:51.040 --> 30:56.800
of modern history and the idea is to try and relay some of the things that I've been studying and

30:56.800 --> 31:02.640
reading about since I was a teenager a lot of these things in history are called conspiracy

31:02.640 --> 31:07.440
theories but actually what they are a real history so what does the new world order want

31:07.440 --> 31:12.480
they want to end nation states they've always wanted to end nation states and bring in one world

31:12.480 --> 31:19.520
government that one world government has always been spookily attached to the united nations and

31:19.520 --> 31:24.560
so it wouldn't surprise me if that's in the end the way that we go we will crash the euro a fiat

31:24.560 --> 31:31.440
currency newly instituted about 20 years ago we will crash the american dollar because that's

31:31.440 --> 31:37.360
also a fiat currency and then we will have most of the population of the western world asking for

31:37.360 --> 31:42.160
a solution and that solution will be a one world government with a new one world currency

31:42.960 --> 31:48.400
let's talk about it in the woods holy crap there's my little boy

31:49.360 --> 31:54.240
I can almost start crying if I see him that small

31:59.760 --> 32:03.760
so I want to tell you this story about my roommate the conspiracy theorist

32:05.760 --> 32:11.600
he told me a story about the new world order the new world order is a cabal of loosely organized

32:11.600 --> 32:17.600
groups which use the power of fractional reserve banking to control governments around the world

32:18.160 --> 32:22.640
fractional reserve banking is the idea that a bank only needs to have x amount of money

32:22.640 --> 32:28.800
in its vaults in order to loan out x times 10 amount of money to people in charge interest

32:28.800 --> 32:32.800
if you're not familiar with how fractional reserve banking works I suggest you google it

32:32.800 --> 32:38.240
before you watch the rest of this film simply because the whole story that I'm about to tell

32:38.240 --> 32:43.680
you is based on the idea that governments around the world are controlled by fractional reserve

32:44.160 --> 32:49.920
I want to tell you guys a story and it's a story about a roommate of mine that I had in college

32:50.560 --> 32:56.880
in the early 90s I graduated from high school in 1990 and so I met this guy in Chicago when I

32:56.880 --> 33:04.720
went to university there and this guy was already a very big conspiracy theorist at 18 years old

33:04.720 --> 33:11.840
and he got me really into trying to read about alternative interpretations of modern political

33:11.840 --> 33:19.120
events he got me into JFK into the Oklahoma City bombing he introduced me to Ted Gunderson

33:19.120 --> 33:24.800
and guys like Mike Rupert who were guys that seemed pretty credible sources that had either

33:24.800 --> 33:31.120
worked for the FBI or in Mike Rupert's case had worked for the LAPD for a long time and had come

33:31.120 --> 33:37.440
out as sort of anti-government conspiracy people that were suggesting that law enforcement and

33:37.440 --> 33:45.360
the FBI and the government were working together to sort of control society by alternative means

33:45.360 --> 33:53.840
mostly by using fractional reserve banking and other means of control like drugs and sex and this

33:53.840 --> 34:00.000
kind of thing to control Congress and to control the government where this story begins is with

34:00.000 --> 34:06.160
things like the Bilderberg group and the Bohemian Grove these kinds of conspiracy theories that

34:06.160 --> 34:11.440
revolved around a pyramid of groups that a lot of times ended with the Illuminati at the top

34:11.440 --> 34:17.840
these groups the council on foreign relations these the trilateral commission these groups exist

34:17.840 --> 34:25.120
and they exist in some sort of organizational structure which has for a long time been documented

34:25.120 --> 34:29.520
by a number of different people in a number of different books and these have always been labeled

34:29.520 --> 34:34.480
as kind of crazy but the interesting thing is and through all of these conspiracy theories

34:34.560 --> 34:41.120
it's a cabal of people that are controlling the left and the right and so all the conspiracy

34:41.120 --> 34:46.560
theories that I knew when I was younger and including the one that this roommate of mine told me about

34:46.560 --> 34:52.240
were conspiracy theories that involved a group of people controlling the left and the right

34:52.240 --> 34:57.360
and so conspiracy theorists were outside of the dichotomy that was the functioning

34:57.360 --> 35:02.480
you know United States government theater that we all are sort of bamboozled by at the moment

35:05.120 --> 35:12.640
how would these things get me thinking about you know what would my old roommate have said

35:12.640 --> 35:18.560
what's going on right now if he were experiencing the coronavirus quarantine

35:22.960 --> 35:28.320
and I think it has to come back to the NWO what is the new world order what was the new world order

35:28.880 --> 35:34.960
and by the new world order we're talking about the thing that George H.W. Bush spoke about in

35:34.960 --> 35:39.360
front of the United Nations way back when it might have been 1996 already

35:47.840 --> 35:53.600
and as we think about this stuff you really need to remember your history if you don't remember

35:53.680 --> 35:58.480
your history then none of this stuff will make sense but if you remember your history

35:59.440 --> 36:03.680
and you go back piece by piece this stuff just falls together and the most

36:03.680 --> 36:09.520
parsimonious explanation is that the theater is still in business and it's the same theater

36:10.240 --> 36:30.240
now you can go back 20 or 40 years and find books which talk about the step-by-step process

36:30.240 --> 36:35.040
by which they were going to introduce the new world order and it started a long time ago

36:35.600 --> 36:39.760
with putting the dollar as a fiat currency rather than having it tied to gold

36:41.600 --> 36:46.560
one of the parts of this story that's really interesting is that for a long time people have

36:46.560 --> 36:51.920
claimed that one of the reasons why Kennedy was shot was because he was trying to put the dollar

36:51.920 --> 36:56.080
back on a silver standard and they didn't want that

37:04.800 --> 37:09.440
anyway the point is is that back in the 90s they were telling all kinds of stories about how

37:09.440 --> 37:15.520
this cabal of rich people connected people were controlling governments using a combination of

37:15.520 --> 37:23.280
pedophilia sex drugs and money and that through bribery and blackmail most of the

37:23.280 --> 37:29.360
US congress was controlled this was the conspiracy theory that was going around in the 1990s

37:29.360 --> 37:35.760
and this was tied together with the Oklahoma City bombing as being largely staged and later on

37:35.760 --> 37:42.560
has 9-11 being largely staged number of people don't know some of those details about 9-11 that

37:42.560 --> 37:48.000
still strike us all as odd to this day because we don't talk about them anymore there's no footage

37:48.000 --> 37:52.240
of the plane that hit the Pentagon there's no evidence that a plane did hit the Pentagon because

37:52.240 --> 37:57.280
there were no seats or no engines removed from the crash even though these are things that usually

37:57.280 --> 38:02.640
don't get destroyed when a plane hits the ground and furthermore there was this building 7 problem

38:02.640 --> 38:06.960
that no one ever really talks about anymore but building 7 is one of the best examples

38:06.960 --> 38:11.600
of a part of a story that gets eliminated the moment that it doesn't really jive

38:11.600 --> 38:16.560
with the intended narrative and building 7 is probably one of the more interesting structural

38:16.560 --> 38:20.320
failures ever caught on film so if you haven't seen it google it it's really fun

38:21.440 --> 38:25.360
if you're not really familiar with the 9-11 conspiracy theories i'm not really gonna

38:25.920 --> 38:30.720
rehash those here but if you want to get started with it you want to look for the plane listen to

38:30.720 --> 38:36.880
that voice like he's not even trying he's just talking and it comes out like that isn't that

38:36.880 --> 38:44.000
crazy at the Pentagon and you want to look for what happened with building 7 most of the current

38:44.000 --> 38:49.120
accounts of 9-11 don't really talk about building 7 anymore and building 7 is the one where really

38:49.120 --> 38:55.280
the laws of physics are broken if you want to search it specifically look for the size of the

38:55.280 --> 38:59.840
steel beams that were used in that building and why they were used and what was underneath that

38:59.840 --> 39:06.960
building and why that building was so strongly built like it or not the effects of 9-11 were

39:06.960 --> 39:13.440
a very big boon for all of those industries that Eisenhower warned us about all those years ago

39:18.560 --> 39:22.960
then you say to yourself well jay come on that's not a very scary conspiracy

39:23.760 --> 39:30.320
that rich people use money to control politicians that's no big deal but it's not just controlling

39:30.320 --> 39:34.960
politicians the story and the conspiracy theory is that they control governments

39:35.680 --> 39:43.680
and by governments then they control society societies are the world so global governance

39:43.680 --> 39:50.320
in this NWO conspiracy model has a group of people not connected to the democrats or the

39:50.320 --> 39:56.640
republicans or the labor party or the Tories but that work above and beyond these silly divisions

39:56.640 --> 40:03.440
that we fight about and the thing that is really creepy about this is that the new world order

40:04.320 --> 40:11.680
as it was codified in the 80s and 90s when i was into this when i was younger the new world order

40:11.680 --> 40:17.440
wanted a few things already back then i think one of the things that you can really look up

40:17.440 --> 40:23.840
if you haven't seen it is Aaron Russo's movie if you don't know who Aaron Russo is he's a director

40:23.840 --> 40:29.600
from the 90s and made a lot of movies he directed trading places with Eddie Murphy friends with

40:29.600 --> 40:39.600
one of the Rockefellers and the Rockefellers boy told him the plan and that plan is to chip us all

40:39.600 --> 40:45.840
to get rid of cash and to have us have a chip under our skin that is our identification chip

40:46.400 --> 40:52.000
it also has our money on it with the idea that if they wanted to make us drop out of society if

40:52.000 --> 41:01.360
they wanted to turn us off they could this is in that movie i can't remember what it's called america

41:02.880 --> 41:08.160
i'm flashing it up on the freedom to fascism not before i posted america freedom to fascism in

41:08.160 --> 41:16.000
the case you forgot and coronavirus easily fits into this narrative it's one of the things that

41:16.000 --> 41:24.480
was suggested already ten years ago as a method of ushering in the last two bits of the new world

41:24.480 --> 41:33.680
order the last two bits of the new world order are the craziest ones the last two bits are a cashless

41:33.680 --> 41:39.200
economy and of course they want to get rid of end-to-end encryption that's what the earn

41:39.200 --> 41:45.680
and act is if you look up the earn it act right now you already find that congress is working on

41:45.680 --> 41:53.440
it right now to get rid of end-to-end encryption on our phones so that they can read and monitor

41:53.440 --> 41:59.920
your messages all the time but the other thing that the new world order wants is a cashless economy

42:00.880 --> 42:07.680
and they want to get rid of nation states whoa wait now you're talking about the united nations

42:07.680 --> 42:12.960
conspiracy yeah yeah that's the same one the one that we've been talking about for 40 years

42:13.600 --> 42:19.760
that the united nations was going to be called in to take over america and we would surrender our

42:19.760 --> 42:26.800
sovereignty to the united nations will imagine a scenario where a global pandemic takes down the

42:26.800 --> 42:35.600
EU and america all at once and we're begging them for a global government led by the united nations

42:37.680 --> 42:43.840
they're going to get rid of the elections because of course we can't have an election now it's

42:43.840 --> 42:56.320
already happening the primaries are being canceled and so i think it started i mean

42:56.800 --> 43:02.080
what a wonderful exciting time to be in america when this kind of stuff when everything aligns

43:02.080 --> 43:09.600
so well with the history conspiracy theory that people have been telling for 40 or 80 years

43:11.440 --> 43:17.040
about how the federal reserve bank is just actually a cabal of privately owned banks

43:18.000 --> 43:28.320
controlled by privately owned banks and these private owners of our banks control all the world's

43:28.320 --> 43:39.680
governments with a combination of money drugs and women now they've let out a nice convenient

43:39.680 --> 43:46.960
bio contagion and they are amplifying the panic of it as much as they possibly can

43:50.560 --> 43:56.400
and we will be left with china and russia against the rest of the world

43:58.080 --> 44:03.280
if you don't think it's happening just watch and make sure it doesn't i hope it doesn't happen

44:03.280 --> 44:08.480
but i'm telling you that's what they want to happen they want to chip you they want to put

44:08.480 --> 44:13.360
a chip in your hand so that they can scan you whenever they want to scan you and your medical

44:13.360 --> 44:18.800
records will be there your behavior records will be there they will be able to track where you go

44:18.800 --> 44:24.080
follow your movements and turn off your money in contact with society whenever they want to

44:24.960 --> 44:31.520
and that's their plan that's the big scary part of the nwo now if you don't think that's happening

44:31.520 --> 44:36.640
then you don't have to worry about the coronavirus being a hoax it's probably just a virus and we

44:36.720 --> 44:45.680
need to be terrified but what if it's not what if this is a plan what if this is the final

44:45.680 --> 44:53.200
stage of that plan the plan that people have been talking about since the 50s and 60s oh my gosh

44:53.200 --> 44:58.800
i remember that plan that people have been talking about since i remember that i got stung by a bug

44:58.800 --> 45:04.400
on my bike it got when that helmet and stung my ear and it's swollen there i remember that wow

45:04.480 --> 45:10.800
that's so weird entity was shot the plan that people have been talking about sorry i'll go back

45:10.800 --> 45:18.400
about that plan the plan that people have been talking about since the 50s and 60s the plan that

45:18.400 --> 45:24.160
people have been talking about since Kennedy was shot the plan that people have been talking about

45:24.160 --> 45:29.920
since the oklahoma city bombing the plan that people have been talking about since the league of

45:29.920 --> 45:34.480
of nations was instituted followed by the United Nations.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.640
The plan that people have been talking about

45:36.640 --> 45:41.640
since the IMF was first instituted, and the World Bank.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.880
Plan that everybody's been talking about

45:44.880 --> 45:47.220
that originated with the Rothschilds.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.800
What if this plan is real?

45:51.880 --> 45:54.800
And what if the coronavirus is a part of it?

45:54.800 --> 45:59.160
That's the scary story of real human history.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.000
Holy crap.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.880
Can you believe that J.C. on a bike was actually doing that?

46:06.880 --> 46:09.880
In March of, and look it, we can show you the date.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.720
We'll show you the real date on that video.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.760
Is March 18th, 2020.

46:17.760 --> 46:20.120
And so there were five in that video series.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.460
So we'll watch them on successive Thursdays,

46:22.460 --> 46:26.040
but we also have to catch up on a few other things,

46:26.040 --> 46:27.840
including America Freedom to Fascism,

46:27.840 --> 46:29.480
which I mentioned in this video.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.560
I don't want to keep you too much longer.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.520
I actually was looking forward to going upstairs

46:36.520 --> 46:39.040
and hanging out with my fam Damilly tonight.

46:40.200 --> 46:45.200
I did end up deciding to coach basketball for the sixth grade.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.280
And that means that I am going to try and shift

46:47.280 --> 46:50.080
my show forward in time.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.320
I don't know how far forward

46:51.320 --> 46:52.760
if it's going to go all the way to the morning

46:52.760 --> 46:55.080
and then I'm going to work in the afternoons,

46:55.080 --> 46:57.120
or if I'm going to start getting up early in the morning

46:57.160 --> 46:59.960
to work so that I can fulfill my obligations

46:59.960 --> 47:03.800
and get stuff done in stills three before dinner

47:03.800 --> 47:07.600
or during dinner, as you saw my best friend

47:07.600 --> 47:09.200
brought me some gnocchi for dinner,

47:09.200 --> 47:11.160
which is just like, what, are you kidding me?

47:11.160 --> 47:12.000
I win.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.040
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen,

47:16.040 --> 47:18.640
I think we have an emergency on our hands

47:18.640 --> 47:21.800
that we all understand very well.

47:21.800 --> 47:25.160
And that is that all cause mortality was converted

47:25.200 --> 47:28.320
to some kind of mythology on the basis

47:28.320 --> 47:29.880
that there was a novel virus,

47:29.880 --> 47:32.760
a novel virus in and of itself was a mythology.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.440
The way that we detected it was a mythology

47:35.440 --> 47:37.120
and the way that we forced people to change

47:37.120 --> 47:39.800
the way that they treat respiratory disease

47:39.800 --> 47:43.640
resulted in deaths that reinforced

47:43.640 --> 47:45.720
the mythology of a novel virus.

47:45.720 --> 47:49.520
It may be that an infectious RNA clone was used

47:49.520 --> 47:52.080
in order to seed the sequence around the world,

47:52.080 --> 47:55.120
but it's likely that those clones didn't spread very far.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.040
And if they were resulting in disease,

47:58.040 --> 48:00.200
they still didn't result in spread

48:00.200 --> 48:04.280
as Denny Rancor and others have shown with their data

48:04.280 --> 48:07.360
or the analysis of all cause mortality around the world.

48:07.360 --> 48:10.360
And it is the idea of inverting your kids

48:10.360 --> 48:14.840
and your grandchildren's sovereignty to that of permissions.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.800
They want to bring in from freedom to fascism.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.040
That's why we got to watch that movie.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.880
It is about the diversity that's on the planet,

48:23.880 --> 48:25.160
but they don't need everybody.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.400
They just really need the inversion

48:27.400 --> 48:30.040
of how you think about yourself,

48:30.040 --> 48:32.040
how you see your biology,

48:32.040 --> 48:34.960
so that when they decide to start sampling it

48:34.960 --> 48:37.960
or tell you how it works, you'll believe them.

48:37.960 --> 48:41.400
Just like we all believe that antibodies were the thing,

48:41.400 --> 48:43.800
and just like we believe that the virus was novel

48:43.800 --> 48:45.520
and that everybody was vulnerable.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.680
I have redone the website.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.280
It actually doesn't look quite like this anymore.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.400
I got rid of the support link at the front.

48:53.400 --> 48:57.160
I got rid of the brief, sorry, there's my arrow.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.840
I got rid of the brief link here.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.920
I got rid of the support link here.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.360
You can scroll down and if you click on this link,

49:03.360 --> 49:04.560
instead of going to support,

49:04.560 --> 49:08.520
you go to the last episode that needed correction.

49:09.720 --> 49:12.760
And so hopefully, is the timing still good?

49:12.760 --> 49:15.200
Are we still good here with the timing?

49:15.200 --> 49:16.680
That would be spectacular.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.200
Anyway, so you can now scroll down

49:22.200 --> 49:24.560
to become a supporter if you'd like.

49:24.560 --> 49:27.320
You can also join us on soapbox still.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.720
And not supporting my work there anymore,

49:29.720 --> 49:31.240
but you're just finding the last stream

49:31.240 --> 49:33.240
that I put on the archive.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.640
And I'm gonna try and be a little better about that,

49:35.640 --> 49:38.800
I promise, because I do think it's valuable

49:38.800 --> 49:41.160
to have those things permanently on Vimeo.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.120
And once they're on Vimeo,

49:42.120 --> 49:44.680
you can actually download them as well from the link.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.360
Transfection is not immunization.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.560
If you wanna say it with more words,

49:48.560 --> 49:50.720
you can say the intramuscular injection

49:50.720 --> 49:52.200
of any combination of substances

49:52.200 --> 49:55.760
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

49:57.280 --> 50:00.320
Hey, anyway, stop transfections in humans

50:00.320 --> 50:01.960
because they're trying to eliminate the control group

50:01.960 --> 50:02.800
by any means.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.440
And necessary, don't forget to go to the

50:04.440 --> 50:06.960
Broken Science Initiative and share their work.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.040
You can see my friend Matt Briggs

50:09.040 --> 50:11.760
also discussing the recent lampooning

50:11.760 --> 50:14.440
of the transfection by giving them

50:14.440 --> 50:16.360
a Nobel Prize tongue and cheek.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.080
This has been gig ombiological,

50:18.080 --> 50:20.040
and you guys like this song,

50:20.040 --> 50:22.560
so I'm definitely gonna play it.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.960
Thanks, guys.

50:23.960 --> 50:27.040
I'll see you again tomorrow night, as usual.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.560
The streak will continue.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.000
Weak voice or not, thanks for joining me.

51:02.000 --> 51:27.600
BEY car

51:27.600 --> 51:30.160
I can't believe we fixed this bit ray thing.

51:30.160 --> 51:33.160
I didn't drop a single frame now.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.800
It's crazy.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.080
I mean, I really was blowing it.

51:36.080 --> 51:39.560
I totally changed the resolution on the monitor

51:39.560 --> 51:42.800
that I was monitoring the show from.

51:42.800 --> 51:47.800
And then it made OBS completely barfed up all the time

51:48.320 --> 51:51.520
because it couldn't render that many pixels fast

51:51.520 --> 51:53.400
and it'll be something like that.

51:53.400 --> 51:57.400
I'm an idiot, but you know, you make a...

52:00.240 --> 52:01.320
You can make a deal with what you got.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.160
Eventually you figure it out.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.320
At least I didn't bump my head or something.

52:05.320 --> 52:06.160
Thanks guys.
