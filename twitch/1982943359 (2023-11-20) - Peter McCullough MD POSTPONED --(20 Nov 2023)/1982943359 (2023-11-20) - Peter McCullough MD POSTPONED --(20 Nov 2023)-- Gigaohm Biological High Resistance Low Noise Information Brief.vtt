00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
I should be live now.

00:02.560 --> 00:03.680
Peter just called me.

00:03.680 --> 00:06.000
I talked to him on Zoom for about five minutes.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.280
His voice sounds awful.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.120
He can't always get sound out

00:10.120 --> 00:12.040
and you can hear that there's all kinds of stuff in there.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.360
You can see that he looks very tired

00:14.360 --> 00:15.680
and he's been working all day.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.100
So I told him absolutely not.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.680
We can reschedule this.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.360
What I wanted to talk to him about today was two things.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.360
He had a poster, I believe.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.200
I'm just going to zoom through these really quick.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.040
Sorry about that.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.480
I should have pulled that out.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.480
He's got a poster about the autopsy findings

00:44.480 --> 00:45.800
that was actually presented

00:45.800 --> 00:48.320
at a University of Michigan meeting

00:48.320 --> 00:53.320
and then also labeled as misinformation.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.640
And then he also, we also have this

00:58.160 --> 01:00.440
tell him honey and vinegar indeed.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.400
Hey, we got a package from you today, Pamela.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.360
That's very sweet.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.600
I'm supposed to say thank you.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.200
And apparently at least one person in the house

01:09.200 --> 01:11.360
is very happy with that package.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.920
And the other thing that I wanted to talk about with him

01:14.920 --> 01:19.760
is this paper about a mild cardial assessment

01:19.760 --> 01:24.280
of function in the heart of vaccinated

01:24.280 --> 01:25.960
and unvaccinated people.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.040
And I thought one of the reasons why it might be nice

01:28.040 --> 01:29.720
to talk to him about this is to try

01:29.720 --> 01:34.240
and understand exactly how this paper was done.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.960
And so I did talk to him for about five minutes.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.880
And the gist of it is that they can use PET scanning

01:41.880 --> 01:46.880
to see a shift from fatty acid metabolism

01:47.360 --> 01:48.760
to glucose metabolism.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.600
And in general, if your heart is damaged or ischemic,

01:53.600 --> 01:55.160
usually it's ischemic.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.200
And there is a shift,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.480
so ischemic means it's low on oxygen.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.560
There's a shift from fatty acid metabolism

02:01.560 --> 02:02.920
to glucose metabolism.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.520
And people that have taken the shot

02:05.520 --> 02:09.880
seem to have shifted their heart to glucose metabolism.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.480
And then they can see some correlation

02:12.480 --> 02:15.080
with pain in the arm and the more pain in the arm,

02:15.080 --> 02:17.560
you have the more likely arm to have this uptake

02:17.560 --> 02:19.560
of this dye, which indicates this change

02:19.560 --> 02:21.880
in metabolic state of those cells.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.760
So he said it was a really striking finding

02:25.760 --> 02:30.200
because of the signal was so incredible and uniform it.

02:30.200 --> 02:35.200
So I think it's an interesting observation

02:36.040 --> 02:38.200
that I think Peter is just willing to add

02:38.200 --> 02:41.960
to one of the many reasons why he would probably agree

02:41.960 --> 02:46.960
that that, come on, man, what's going on?

02:49.480 --> 02:53.360
Oh, that's a window, I forgot, that's a window, my bad.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.560
That's probably why he would agree that,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.880
and now that's moving, why is that moving?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.400
Goodness sakes, it's just dumb.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.600
I'm losing my mind here after having J Balacharion,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.020
that was a really intense conversation.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.160
I don't think that at this stage,

03:15.160 --> 03:18.920
Peter would argue with the statements on this screen,

03:18.920 --> 03:20.200
except for maybe the bottom one,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.880
simply because he's not a virologist

03:22.880 --> 03:26.280
or a biologist in that lane.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.600
But I think that Peter Makala has recently taken the position

03:29.600 --> 03:33.160
that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

03:33.160 --> 03:35.400
with the intent of augmenting the immune system

03:35.400 --> 03:40.480
is unadvisable, and transfection in healthy humans

03:40.480 --> 03:43.200
is criminally negligent, and he may have found

03:43.200 --> 03:46.040
another aspect of the evidence,

03:46.040 --> 03:49.680
which I think is his conclusive at this stage,

03:49.680 --> 03:52.520
that they had to, had to have known

03:52.520 --> 03:55.640
that the damage that would be done by this

03:56.640 --> 03:58.200
was simply unjustifiable.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.800
So there must have been some other national security priority,

04:01.800 --> 04:05.080
some other objective that they wanted to accomplish

04:05.080 --> 04:09.200
with this maneuver, other than just responding to a pandemic,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.400
which we all understand now,

04:11.400 --> 04:14.480
the claim for a pandemic is dubious at best.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.840
And the reason why they're doing this

04:17.840 --> 04:22.040
is because they want to invert our sovereignty to permissions.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.280
Stop all transfections in healthy humans

04:24.280 --> 04:26.240
because they are trying to eliminate the control group.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.080
I hope you won't be disappointed

04:28.080 --> 04:33.080
if I just leave you to redigest the JB interview with J.C.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.080
And we'll come back to Peter McSee MD

04:38.080 --> 04:42.080
as soon as we can with Dr. J.C.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.080
And so thank you very much for joining me.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.080
And I think I will sign off now

04:48.080 --> 04:51.080
and try to help keep peace in the house this evening.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.080
So thank you very much.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.080
I'll see you guys again soon.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.080
Good to see you again, Jeff.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
Thanks for following

05:09.080 --> 05:14.080
and the other Jeff to their UGG-001.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.080
Pamela, again, thanks for the package.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.080
And garden variety human, thanks for showing up.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Thanks for the kudos.

05:22.080 --> 05:27.080
I hope that I hope you enjoyed that interview with JB

05:27.080 --> 05:28.080
as much as I did.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.080
I felt some friction or some resistance or some disconnect,

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
but I didn't...

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
Well, I don't know.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.080
I just know that I've met him a few times in person.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
I really like the guy a lot,

05:39.080 --> 05:42.080
and I think he's also really trying to solve the process.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.080
So I hope with further discussion we can get him

05:45.080 --> 05:51.080
either to push back harder against what we're hypothesizing.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.080
To either push back more effectively

05:55.080 --> 05:57.080
on what we're hypothesizing

05:57.080 --> 06:00.080
or digest a little bit more about what we're hypothesizing

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
and help us evaluate it better.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.080
So either way, I think we made a lot of progress with Jay.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.080
Can I know that Peter has come a long way since the last time

06:08.080 --> 06:09.080
we talked to him?

06:09.080 --> 06:12.080
So I'm really excited about getting his insight into this paper

06:12.080 --> 06:14.080
and also just talking to him about

06:14.080 --> 06:17.080
how his views about immunology

06:17.080 --> 06:21.080
and the vaccinology have changed over the past three years.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.080
I think it's a really unique opportunity

06:24.080 --> 06:28.080
to talk to another person who has essentially had a few changes

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
apart over the last three years,

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
not unlike yours truly.

06:32.080 --> 06:37.080
So it's been a very humble regret

06:37.080 --> 06:39.080
that I say that I can't talk to him today

06:39.080 --> 06:41.080
but I will talk to him soon.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.080
Thanks guys.
