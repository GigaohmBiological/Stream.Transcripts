These streams are all from: https://twitch.tv/gigaohmbiological

_Note: Twitch streams disappear after something like 2-4 weeks, so they are not permanent streams. Rumble and Peertube should be permanent streams._

_Note: Not all captions are timed to the Twitch stream (due to technical issues) so sometimes they are timed to another stream (usually the one in the middle of the drift range). The usual difference is usually < 1 min between the shortest and longest streams unless one was cut off while streaming to a particular platform._
