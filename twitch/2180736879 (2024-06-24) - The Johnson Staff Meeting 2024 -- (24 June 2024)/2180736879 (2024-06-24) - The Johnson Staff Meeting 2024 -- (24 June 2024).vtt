00:37.458 --> 00:41.901
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:42.121 --> 00:46.323
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:46.523 --> 00:51.226
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:51.526 --> 00:55.988
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:56.109 --> 01:01.191
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

01:01.211 --> 01:02.372
I'm afraid that the latest data...

01:32.048 --> 01:38.030
Hey, folks, here's a story about Minnie the Moocher.

01:38.170 --> 01:42.451
She was a low-down huge-a-coocher.

01:43.131 --> 01:51.353
She was the roughest, toughest frail, but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

02:12.088 --> 02:16.893
She messed around with a bloke named Smokey.

02:16.913 --> 02:21.678
She loved him though he was kokey.

02:21.759 --> 02:29.567
He took her down to Chinatown and he showed her how to kick the gong around.

02:50.615 --> 02:53.977
She had a dream about the King of Sweden.

02:55.518 --> 02:59.620
He gave her things that she was needin'.

02:59.680 --> 03:06.944
He gave her a home built of gold and steel, a diamond car with the

03:22.436 --> 03:46.159
He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses Each meal she ate was a dozen courses Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes She sat around and counted them all a million times

03:51.499 --> 04:11.092
Ho dee ho dee ho dee ho He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he dee he dee he He dee he

04:29.372 --> 04:31.696
We heard your handles were pretty tight.

04:31.716 --> 04:32.978
It takes a lot of practice.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.882
Practice at breakfast.

04:34.922 --> 04:36.164
Left hand works the drill.

04:37.406 --> 04:38.648
Right hand gets the serve.

04:39.690 --> 04:40.892
Do you practice in the theater?

04:57.344 --> 04:59.785
I know that guy did not win the NBA championship.

04:59.865 --> 05:04.886
It's a funny commercial from the late, early 2000s, rather.

05:04.966 --> 05:06.746
So, it's just a little flashback.

05:07.426 --> 05:09.047
It's just my love of basketball.

05:09.087 --> 05:09.927
Don't have to correct me.

05:10.007 --> 05:12.948
I know he didn't pull it off.

05:13.668 --> 05:14.708
But, anyway.

05:16.169 --> 05:17.369
Mini the Moocher, indeed.

05:17.389 --> 05:19.810
Heidi, Heidi, Heidi, ho!

05:21.370 --> 05:24.511
From the Blues Brothers soundtrack, ladies and gentlemen.

05:24.531 --> 05:25.431
Good to see you all.

05:52.304 --> 06:12.494
Snow in summer 950 might be catching on to something that's not really quite congruent with other things on the game board and we're gonna peel just a little bit of that onion back today but not very much because I don't want to cry.

06:40.229 --> 06:44.553
Oh, yes, Steve Kirsch called me as if he didn't know me and never talked to me before.

06:44.593 --> 06:50.217
And in fact, the first time we ever met in person, he behaved the exact same way when I was still... I think the truth is good for kids.

06:50.677 --> 06:54.520
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.622
We want everybody to feel good.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.984
That's not the way life is.

06:59.224 --> 07:00.245
This is how they behave.

07:00.405 --> 07:01.466
This is liars.

07:01.486 --> 07:02.987
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:03.608 --> 07:05.349
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:07.179 --> 07:07.900
And I have lied.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.941
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:08.961 --> 07:09.902
I don't want to lie.

07:10.403 --> 07:11.744
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:11.845 --> 07:12.866
I try not to be a liar.

07:12.906 --> 07:13.747
I don't want to be a liar.

07:14.327 --> 07:17.031
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:20.882 --> 07:39.438
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

07:40.559 --> 07:49.006
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

07:52.756 --> 08:01.460
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

08:02.540 --> 08:05.662
It's measles plus.

08:05.762 --> 08:11.284
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

08:11.584 --> 08:13.525
It's just a big hassle in the end.

08:16.667 --> 08:29.820
When we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality, it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these three.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.442
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

09:16.118 --> 09:16.179
you

09:38.123 --> 09:45.127
I would be very careful to attribute what is not smart but actually just a lot of money thrown at a problem.

09:45.147 --> 09:55.493
If I watch Soph's videos, what I see is an incredible amount of content brought together in an incredibly efficient way and then edited in a very efficient way.

09:56.553 --> 09:59.335
These are sometimes conversations happening between her

09:59.935 --> 10:05.543
and somebody else off screen and then these are edited to near perfection sometimes as long as an hour long.

10:06.063 --> 10:17.018
I think you're grossly underestimate the amount of material that's out there that you can still download and archive and it is not a this is a person who did this when she was a minor.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.480
supposedly going to high school.

10:20.880 --> 10:29.383
And these are just things that even if I had all the material in front of me, it would still take me many, many days to put together a video like this.

10:30.024 --> 10:39.787
So I don't think you should see it as something that can just be the result of rich kids and a lot of books in a room.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.488
Look for more videos then.

10:42.148 --> 10:52.375
because there are hours, hundreds of hours, I've wasted an entire hard drive on that little girl, and it's because it is disturbing what it represents as parents.

10:52.936 --> 11:00.141
Because as far as I can tell, I feel as though there might be essentially child abuse captured on those videos.

11:01.282 --> 11:11.249
You're looking at a minor in a lot of those videos, and allowing a minor child to behave, or worse yet, be used that way,

11:12.029 --> 11:14.852
on the internet just because they got a million followers.

11:16.274 --> 11:19.477
I just don't know that what I see there is sound.

11:21.359 --> 11:26.504
What I see there is something much more sinister in my mind and it has nothing to do with her.

11:26.584 --> 11:34.112
I have very much pity for what I see in those videos and that young lady that I see in those videos.

11:36.084 --> 11:41.305
And I have a feeling that the more people look into that, the more they will feel the same way.

11:42.406 --> 11:48.967
It's just a question of how does that happen if that's your kid and you're rich, as you said in the chat.

11:50.188 --> 11:57.790
How do rich parents, why would a rich parent allow their child to behave that way online and to say those things online?

11:58.690 --> 12:19.595
especially allowed her child to be exploited by Alex Jones at least twice in 2019, if not three times he was allowed to raise money using her as a guest on his show, which I guess means that they think that Alex Jones is a legitimate patriot.

12:21.015 --> 12:28.097
I do not think that Alex Jones at this stage, in the illusion, can be a legitimate patriot.

12:28.397 --> 12:33.199
He may have been at one time, back when he was a young guy and broke into the Bohemian Grove.

12:33.559 --> 12:35.679
I think it's very possible that he was a good guy.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.521
But now, since your consciousness has become prime real estate,

12:41.481 --> 12:53.664
Anybody that is able to stake a meaningful claim to any part of your consciousness through social media is almost assuredly someone that they have chosen and permitted to do so.

12:53.724 --> 12:59.585
There are no random rising stars in social media anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

12:59.605 --> 13:04.486
That's part of the illusion of social media, that there's an algorithm that they have no control over.

13:04.986 --> 13:08.607
That there's an algorithm that could be gamed if you're viral enough.

13:08.667 --> 13:11.467
This is absolutely, positively a lie.

13:13.548 --> 13:16.568
And that's why all of these ideas are not being talked about.

13:16.608 --> 13:18.289
It's not because they're not good ideas.

13:18.769 --> 13:24.890
It's because the ideas that rise on social media rise with the people who rise on social media.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.251
And it's not an algorithm or an AI they can't understand.

13:28.751 --> 13:30.211
It's a really basic program.

13:31.463 --> 13:33.904
and you are not programmed to rise within it.

13:34.044 --> 13:34.504
That's it.

13:34.764 --> 13:35.084
Done.

13:35.905 --> 13:51.230
And the reason why they do it is so that it's very easy to attribute bad motives to the people that disagree with others online, and they have created an illusion that this is the going rate, the going currency of intellectual discussion.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.132
And that's how they're going to control, demolish America.

13:56.693 --> 13:58.416
We are the dumbed-down people.

13:58.816 --> 14:00.078
That's what you have to realize.

14:00.419 --> 14:07.909
I am part of the dumbed-down adults that could not see this at the beginning the way that we should have seen it.

14:07.969 --> 14:12.075
We're seeing it already before they open the cage.

14:15.489 --> 14:22.754
But I see it now, and I'm trying as best I can to show as many people as I can over the next couple months.

14:23.635 --> 14:31.781
As we move forward, trying to learn our history as fast as we can before they erase it, it's lost forever so that we can reclaim the power that these charlatans have over our children.

14:34.183 --> 14:35.363
That's what we're trying to do here.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.681
Not just these charlatans though, ladies and gentlemen, there are other charlatans at play.

14:41.161 --> 14:47.403
And in fact, these other charlatans are much more dangerous because they are wolves in sheep's clothing.

14:50.124 --> 14:52.344
They're not really wolves, they're just traitors.

14:54.245 --> 14:58.306
And they are pulling an amazingly traitorous trick on us now.

15:00.416 --> 15:20.781
And in order to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of their immunomythology and away from their illusions, we're gonna have to show our kids exactly how this wave of lies, this wave of consensus, this illusion of consensus is created, and then give them a surfboard of truth with which to navigate it.

15:21.921 --> 15:28.163
These fake waves go the wrong way anyway, so it's time to, it's time really, it's really time.

15:33.378 --> 15:36.661
This introduction is going a little long, I guess because I'm babbling too much.

15:37.542 --> 15:39.644
But welcome to GigaOM Biological.

15:39.684 --> 15:48.732
You are here, if you've been here for a while, at the top of the wave of consensus, where we stay focused on biology, we don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

15:49.232 --> 15:54.817
We're trying to rescue skilled social media users, but also you've got to come to realize... Just hold on one second.

15:55.629 --> 16:03.135
You gotta come to realize, aha, see, I knew something was happening there, and that's why you couldn't see me before.

16:03.175 --> 16:08.759
I'm just gonna focus on the head of the chair first, and then after I do that, I will be able to speak to you.

16:12.602 --> 16:14.744
That looks pretty good.

16:15.620 --> 16:24.373
So please don't underestimate how many of these skilled social media users are actually fake accounts being run by other people.

16:25.174 --> 16:31.182
Sometimes being run by other people with the intention of creating an illusion of consensus around what they just posted.

16:31.923 --> 16:48.670
Imagine if some people actually have a room full of hired people that run anonymous accounts that create an illusion of consensus or even create the debate that they want to have happen after they tweet their snarky tweet or they hashtag their snarky hashtag.

16:49.090 --> 16:52.992
Because that's most likely how to explain a lot of the accounts that we see

16:53.792 --> 17:06.781
on Twitter, and most likely the way to explain the reason why Addy Ads and Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn all decided in April of 2020 that the place to hash this biology out was on Twitter.

17:06.801 --> 17:09.262
And that's, in fact, why drastic the group was there.

17:09.843 --> 17:23.472
And it was probably the reason why I ended up spending so much time on Twitter, because it seemed to be that place where you could have these, you know, direct message discussions with people all around the world that were trying to solve this and remain anonymous.

17:23.992 --> 17:41.833
Which seemed attractive at first and now just seems like a really easy way for people to lie about who they are So again, welcome to the show America really needs to stay focused on the biology and start loving their neighbor because the trick is really gonna be played on us

17:47.697 --> 17:50.259
lights on or anything like that behind me.

17:50.799 --> 17:53.240
I just got back from the gym a little while ago.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.121
I apologize.

17:54.201 --> 18:01.125
We're trying to play a lot of basketball in the next two weeks before my kids go to see their grandma.

18:02.626 --> 18:06.408
Please share the work and thank you very much for everybody that is supporting.

18:06.428 --> 18:08.510
We lost a lot of subscribers over the last week.

18:09.490 --> 18:18.358
But that's the way this is gonna work truth-telling is not for everybody and not everybody that has been supporting Not everybody that's supporting this stream is good.

18:18.419 --> 18:29.569
I know that I'm aware of that and so, you know eventually some of these people are gonna pull their support and that's alright because That's what we expected to happen

18:58.072 --> 19:01.334
Gotta pull your hands down from your face, ladies and gentlemen.

19:01.354 --> 19:03.675
We gotta pull our phones away from our face.

19:03.695 --> 19:06.136
We gotta get off this social media, especially Twitter.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.738
I think Twitter is right now the worst one.

19:09.878 --> 19:17.443
And I think that's the one I'm gonna most try to get off of over the next month or two as we transition to using it for our own purposes only.

19:18.403 --> 19:21.904
But no discussions will happen on Twitter very much longer.

19:22.004 --> 19:22.684
That's for sure.

19:23.125 --> 19:28.266
It's one way for us to really take our power back is to deny them that.

19:57.003 --> 20:00.143
Yeah, I'm just letting you know that I'm not fooling around.

20:00.163 --> 20:04.104
I am an old school conspiracy theorist.

20:04.184 --> 20:13.847
Back when a company by the name of Fear and Clothing was out there, and I have a couple, three shirts from that era.

20:13.867 --> 20:14.467
These are about 25 or

20:16.400 --> 20:36.233
Don't know how many years old they are 23 years old I have a whole set of them like the building 7-1 and I also have that looks like the the 7-eleven logo and then this one So I know What Alex Jones was doing all the way back then I saw that video I was there when that happened or at least not there, but you know, it's a

20:37.600 --> 20:46.403
I know the role that Alex Jones has played over the last 20 years of American history, and that's an important thing to understand in the context of the history.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.043
You have to have lived it.

20:48.223 --> 20:53.605
Otherwise, some young teenager finding out about Alex Jones doesn't understand.

20:53.925 --> 20:57.866
Somebody just finding out about David Icke doesn't understand what they did with them.

20:59.346 --> 21:18.343
doesn't understand how those people were used to seed these ideas in an incredulous way, so that some people would be tempted enough to think about them, and other people would be very free to ignore them, as if it was a velvet curtain that hid nothing, or as if it was something that they weren't supposed to know anyway, and either way,

21:19.738 --> 21:22.359
Those ideas have been out there for really 20 years.

21:22.419 --> 21:44.905
And that's the foundation of this, which everybody needs to start to understand that seeding these ideas in academic meetings, seeding these ideas in bureaucratic meetings where lanyards are required and seeding these ideas in the backwoods of the internet and crazy books about breaking into secret meetings or worse about reptile aliens.

21:47.714 --> 21:59.389
And in so doing, they have established these people who have just free reign to say whatever they want now, and most of those people are telling us that America's bad, America's gotta go, or American empire's already going.

22:01.092 --> 22:01.933
Wake up, wake up.

22:03.581 --> 22:07.704
And nobody's really talking about the fact that America is being destroyed by traitors.

22:08.584 --> 22:19.811
And nobody's talking about the fact that the pandemic was started by murder and then lying about it and calling it an impending biosecurity crisis, when in reality, it was just murder and lies.

22:21.411 --> 22:34.156
And then those murder and lies were compounded by the opioid epidemic and by all the other ways that they've turned the knobs up on all cause mortality and just kind of shrugged their shoulders and been like, well, I don't know.

22:34.196 --> 22:35.076
We didn't know what to do.

22:35.096 --> 22:36.217
It was a novel virus.

22:36.917 --> 22:39.038
And almost anything falls under that rubric.

22:41.799 --> 22:45.500
And yet somehow or another, none of these people are able to enunciate this.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.641
I'm a human just like you.

22:46.681 --> 22:49.622
Sometimes it frustrates me to the point where I can't even push the button.

22:50.598 --> 23:01.643
I wanted to do a stream yesterday, but I was at wit's end as to how awful it is where we are with these people that are just absolutely spectacularly committed to lying.

23:04.704 --> 23:09.466
And to think that we're in the middle of 2024 and I still have people lying to me.

23:09.546 --> 23:16.829
I still have coordinated people lying to me in the backwoods of Twitter on direct message threads.

23:18.132 --> 23:29.880
lying to me about how they want to help me, lying to me about how they want me to write a chapter in their book or write a substack with them so they can promote my ideas, lying to me about who they trust and why they trust them.

23:32.362 --> 23:34.943
And some of them are Americans and that makes them traitors.

23:39.386 --> 23:45.671
And so, yeah, I'm tired of saying intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

23:45.791 --> 23:46.171
Oh, I got my

23:46.860 --> 23:48.001
Volume way too low here.

23:49.662 --> 23:53.406
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.889
There's other ways to say it.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.832
You can say that the old vaccine schedule was injuring and killing thousands every year.

24:01.393 --> 24:04.776
You can also say that we don't need to fear free-range RNA molecules.

24:04.816 --> 24:10.500
And you can also say that weaponized piles of money murdered people and convinced people to argue about it being a lab leak.

24:11.241 --> 24:17.126
And they were on this convincing people about it being a lab leak or a bioweapon attack or something like that.

24:17.146 --> 24:18.527
They were on it very early.

24:18.987 --> 24:27.794
And they had people going around very early urging and nudging people to, hey, that was a good report, man, you should do that again.

24:28.174 --> 24:29.996
And then they had English people

24:31.394 --> 24:37.456
coordinatedly trying to antagonize those people so that there was a push and pull on everybody.

24:37.676 --> 24:45.819
And inevitably, it's a push and pull that involves an American with some people from England or somewhere in the Five Eyes countries.

24:45.879 --> 24:46.799
It's always that way.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.141
I've got one of the earliest examples queued up right here.

24:51.681 --> 24:57.083
An American with somebody from a Five Eyes country messing with another American.

24:59.222 --> 25:10.489
that Fort Belvoir, an American, a sergeant from Fort Belvoir, that's the intelligence command, that's INS com, that's just over the river here in Virginia.

25:10.949 --> 25:16.652
That's the first person, that's the first person that's infected with coronavirus in where?

25:17.973 --> 25:18.894
Wuhan, China.

25:19.534 --> 25:20.594
Huh, now how could that be?

25:20.655 --> 25:23.696
How could an intelligence officer from Fort Belvoir

25:31.826 --> 25:32.386
Sorry about that.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.967
I want to fix this scroll here before it drives me bananas.

25:36.027 --> 25:37.227
It's too low here.

25:38.567 --> 25:39.227
I want to move it up.

25:39.507 --> 25:40.428
Sorry, my bad.

25:42.028 --> 25:42.788
Okay, that goes right there.

25:42.808 --> 25:43.028
Thank you.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.028
There we go.

25:46.449 --> 25:51.570
Which is in the intelligence command, be the first person that's infected with the coronavirus.

25:51.630 --> 25:52.970
Well, it's called the World Games.

25:53.910 --> 25:55.410
The World Games is like an Olympics.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.290
It's a huge thing.

25:56.470 --> 25:58.551
Mark Kulak did an excellent special on this.

25:58.651 --> 25:59.871
It's very much like

26:02.560 --> 26:07.081
So George just mentioned someone called Mark Kulaks did a special on this.

26:08.882 --> 26:09.922
And this is Mark Kulaks.

26:09.982 --> 26:12.323
Now this video has been deleted by Mark Kulaks.

26:13.243 --> 26:14.223
I'd like you to watch this.

26:14.684 --> 26:19.505
This was probably around either the 10th or the 12th.

26:19.545 --> 26:23.526
It has been deleted off of his website.

26:25.007 --> 26:25.887
Okay, let's watch it.

26:27.507 --> 26:28.668
Do I need to rewind it first?

26:33.880 --> 26:38.342
Now, let's do a little bit of the case analysis here.

26:38.362 --> 26:42.923
So what are the odds that the virus was spread at this event?

26:42.963 --> 26:53.687
Well, it just so happens that the first case that was observed in Virginia was a military person, military personnel from Fort Belvoir.

26:55.908 --> 26:58.509
It was someone who is a cyclist.

27:00.222 --> 27:01.583
Someone who's really into sports.

27:02.404 --> 27:05.526
Someone who recently participated in some international travel.

27:06.326 --> 27:23.879
Matter of fact, holy cow, the very first person in Virginia, the very first person in Virginia who caught the coronavirus, the very first person was at the 2019 CISM Military World Games in Wuhan, China.

27:36.195 --> 27:36.695
Here I am.

27:36.755 --> 27:43.298
I'm going to be going to my friend Martha's house tomorrow and doing some drywall, which I love to do.

27:43.318 --> 27:44.258
I love doing carpentry.

27:44.318 --> 27:45.239
Got to pay some bills, right?

27:45.259 --> 27:46.019
Got to get a little bit of money.

27:48.380 --> 27:55.403
How is it that I can figure this out, but CNN, Fox News?

27:56.784 --> 27:58.704
By the way, I mean, One Forever Seeking, thank you.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.745
I don't mean to cut you off.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.106
You really found that article for me.

28:04.324 --> 28:13.866
So there is Mark Kulaks talking about Mbenassi saying thank you OneForeverSeeking you really found that out for me.

28:15.066 --> 28:16.867
So who is OneForeverSeeking?

28:18.147 --> 28:27.949
OneForeverSeeking is somebody who tweets and they were dot connecting is one of the independent amateur

28:28.894 --> 28:30.915
amateur hour research tool.

28:30.935 --> 28:33.036
Okay, so first, let's look at the pattern here.

28:33.577 --> 28:42.041
The pattern is an American working another American in cooperation with somebody outside of the UK.

28:43.502 --> 28:50.226
A lot like, let's say, Addy Ads and Paul Cottrell working me with Kevin McCarran.

28:52.107 --> 28:57.710
It's a lot like George Webb and Addy Ads and other people working Mark Kulak.

28:59.531 --> 29:14.072
And there are other examples of Americans cooperating with people from the UK or people from South Africa or people from Australia also more or less corralling me.

29:16.212 --> 29:21.234
And I can make a pretty good list of these kinds of meddler groups.

29:22.034 --> 29:35.518
I would suggest that somebody like Jessica Rose has been involved in a lot of these meddler groups, somebody with such impeccable NATO credentials as Jessica Rose, who doesn't really have a job.

29:35.558 --> 29:37.479
I don't know if she's ever really had a job.

29:37.519 --> 29:45.281
She's just been kind of post docking and surfboarding until the pandemic started all on NATO's dime.

29:46.980 --> 29:56.247
And yet now she is the prominent expert on VAERS, even ignores somebody like Albert on the Eagles guy.

29:58.589 --> 30:02.592
And so then the examples do not end anymore.

30:02.772 --> 30:08.557
And this is again, in early 2020, funneling people toward Twitter.

30:09.995 --> 30:13.378
A guy from England funneling people toward Twitter.

30:13.418 --> 30:15.860
We know that England has the 77th Brigade.

30:15.900 --> 30:19.784
We know they have buildings full of people screwing around on the internet.

30:19.804 --> 30:32.715
So how in the world is it possible that all of these people like Robert Malone and Merrill Nass will tell you that, you know, fifth generation warfare is just something you're never going to figure out because they don't want you to figure it out.

30:32.775 --> 30:36.418
If they wanted you to figure it out, they would tell you that, well, I don't only have one account.

30:36.918 --> 30:57.175
I've got this whole, you know, support group of people that runs other accounts that makes me look like a pimp every time I'm on Twitter and makes me look really smart because they immediately retweet and they immediately reply with positive compliments while you're a hero and it only takes a few of those before there's no place left to scroll.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.484
Let's listen to the rest of this video.

31:02.525 --> 31:06.866
It's a good example of evidence all over the internet of things that were happening.

31:06.886 --> 31:08.286
It's Joining Dots on Google.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.807
So this person is Joining Dots.

31:11.187 --> 31:22.951
They are investigating, as far as they're concerned, events during March the 7th, 2020, talking about the fact that there is a Wuhan Institute of Virology.

31:24.952 --> 31:27.833
How did they not know about the CISM military war games in Wuhan?

31:29.090 --> 31:30.151
with ministry people.

31:30.191 --> 31:38.875
So the idea is to kind of motivate people to think that this is a good question or a bad question and to create controversy over answering this question.

31:39.715 --> 31:43.037
It's seeding the impetus for the Scooby-Doo.

31:43.097 --> 31:44.597
It's supposed to motivate Mark.

31:45.998 --> 31:49.340
It's supposed to motivate anybody that might be interested in finding out

31:50.287 --> 31:53.512
who these people are and what they've done, whether they're lying or not.

31:53.572 --> 32:01.884
And there was a 60 Minutes episode featuring George Webb around this same time that Robert Malone has been shamelessly plugging.

32:01.904 --> 32:06.131
Like, think about that.

32:07.705 --> 32:24.073
Think about the fact that Robert Malone, who's been in more than one music video with Judy Mikovits, has never done a program with her, never said that she's good or bad, that Judy Mikovits knows a little or a lot about viruses, and Judy Mikovits has never said anything about whether Robert Malone is a good or bad guy.

32:25.313 --> 32:29.895
What an interesting lack of crossover event there, right?

32:29.935 --> 32:33.557
When they both are basically descended from the same virology grandfathers.

32:35.031 --> 32:47.515
And yet nobody will talk about it except for Mark and I. Nobody will mention Judy Mikovits' previous role in trying to seed a narrative about latent viruses that could be activated by vaccines.

32:49.015 --> 32:57.138
Very similar to what Hilary Koprowski was talking about and Lederberg have talked about and all these other people have talked about erroneously.

32:58.755 --> 33:07.619
trying to find the right narrative about viruses that would really get us to believe wholeheartedly in the model of public health, and this is where we are.

33:08.959 --> 33:13.101
Coercion through mythology, and a mythology created by a chorus of liars.

33:13.461 --> 33:22.285
Well, a contracting coronavirus, and there's an example of a military person contracting coronavirus at March the 7th.

33:23.446 --> 33:23.986
And another.

33:25.208 --> 33:30.591
member of the military, and this one links to an article about the US Army, Fort Belvoir.

33:30.611 --> 33:47.960
It's also interesting to note that one of the people that was involved in DRASTIC that supposedly found the PhD and the master's thesis that led to the discovery that there was this cave in Mohan, or Moyang province, is a very similar name called The Seeker.

33:51.536 --> 34:02.414
And so you can see already here where basically you got all these accounts with very similar themes and very similar levels of insight into what's going on about a lab leak.

34:03.496 --> 34:05.057
And some of them were in drastic.

34:05.177 --> 34:10.019
Others of them were chasing around and following the direction or supporting the work of George Webb.

34:10.099 --> 34:12.180
Other people were supporting the work of other people.

34:12.220 --> 34:18.562
And before you know it, you have got an illusion of Scooby-Doo mystery solvers all over the internet.

34:18.582 --> 34:21.824
And no matter where you go, you find people involved in solving the mystery.

34:27.526 --> 34:28.607
I don't know who this guy is.

34:28.647 --> 34:30.227
I don't think he did very many videos.

34:30.267 --> 34:31.728
That's what's really interesting about it.

34:32.972 --> 34:46.822
So underneath that, or above it, I can't remember which order these come, this is March 14th, this is later, this is talking about 2020, Military Games, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

34:46.842 --> 34:55.729
So talking about Military Games, member of the military, and connecting, look, someone connected these two together, and that person was Mark.

34:56.283 --> 34:59.267
Yeah, and connecting those two together, but the dates are always wrong.

34:59.327 --> 35:00.228
So it's funny, right?

35:00.268 --> 35:11.962
This is probably a meddler here, a meddler account on Twitter, seeding similar, or let's say seeding useful questions with the wrong answers, seeding useful questions with the wrong leads.

35:12.623 --> 35:17.106
And making it so that you could be debunked very easily if you shared these tweets.

35:17.206 --> 35:18.066
That's what's happening.

35:18.106 --> 35:19.387
That's what's always happening.

35:19.847 --> 35:25.710
And that's what I get frustrated with the most is that people don't seem to be able to see through that.

35:26.010 --> 35:28.892
And now we really need to help people see through it.

35:29.352 --> 35:32.394
And I really think that's what my plan is going forward.

35:32.834 --> 35:38.017
It's trying to help people see how weaponized piles of money murdered people and convince people to argue about it.

35:38.377 --> 35:44.699
They convinced people like me to argue about it, and that participating in that argument was being patriotic and brave.

35:48.140 --> 35:54.361
And if you got out of that argument by suggesting that there was no virus, you were never going to evolve in that understanding.

35:54.401 --> 35:56.482
You were just going to say, no viruses, period.

35:57.662 --> 36:00.623
And that was also a trap, because of course we know they can make

36:01.440 --> 36:15.233
recombinant DNA and RNA in quantity, in relatively high purity, and they can put it in places that they want to, and they have lots of ways to deliver it, including virus-like particles that are patented by Sina Bavari and David Hone.

36:17.035 --> 36:18.356
They look a lot like Ebola.

36:21.058 --> 36:38.352
And so the no virus position, if it is not properly curated and isn't properly wielded as a weapon to destroy the public health state, it is used as a weapon to prevent people from understanding it.

36:40.113 --> 36:49.601
And it should have been a tool that got everybody, it should have been a ladder that got everybody out of the cave, and instead it was a tool to make sure that they never got out, that they always were stuck in it.

36:52.250 --> 37:18.821
And so over the next few weeks, I really hope that I'm gonna be successful in convincing a lot more people that what we have here is a coordinated group of liars, a Lollapalooza of liars, and they work with people outside of the United States, and they work with people outside of the United States that are manipulating social media accounts to create an illusion of consensus that we don't need to talk about 2020, because nothing was really happening then but a bunch of mistakes.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.611
and we need to talk about things that happened after that.

37:22.631 --> 37:34.139
You know, like in 2021 or 2022, when we finally decided that we had principles, and we have to ignore everybody that had principles in 2020, and more importantly, ignore what they were saying.

37:35.280 --> 37:43.745
It's actually okay to talk about Wolfgang Wodach or Mike Eden, as long as you talk about what they most recently said and not what they were saying in 2020.

37:45.706 --> 37:47.848
That's also part of the trick that's being pulled now.

37:49.744 --> 37:52.685
And there are still liars that we have not exposed yet.

37:52.785 --> 37:55.966
And probably most, but not all of them are foreigners.

37:57.027 --> 38:03.009
Because they all essentially won't enunciate these truths in the most efficient form.

38:03.049 --> 38:07.371
And they definitely won't tell you that we don't need to fear free-range RNA molecules.

38:07.411 --> 38:18.935
They will say that there was no pandemic, but they won't definitively say the things that need to be said so that academic biologists and armchair biologists alike are challenged to think about that statement.

38:22.714 --> 38:30.744
And so yesterday, or the day before, or Friday, we looked at Steve Kirsch and the Andy Kaufman crossover.

38:30.844 --> 38:34.588
Andy Kaufman, I'm sure, is one of the deeper traders in this.

38:35.850 --> 38:38.913
And he is probably one of the guys that's responsible for

38:39.594 --> 38:42.796
the curation of the no virus position.

38:43.657 --> 38:59.708
And I have good reason to believe that because one of the people that was lying to me in 2021 also claimed to have phone access to Andy Kaufman and claimed to have talked to him more than once on my behalf about possibly coming on my broadcast.

39:00.168 --> 39:08.314
So I'm pretty sure that that person was lying to me, which means that that also means that this person is a liar and is connected to this, you know,

39:08.954 --> 39:12.637
this real central core group of people that I don't know who they work for.

39:12.677 --> 39:19.002
Do they work for the State Department or the FBI or CIA or or HHS or who they work for?

39:20.203 --> 39:34.134
But they are all coordinatedly lying and there's there's something about them that leads me to believe that they're definitely not DOD because a lot of times they do things that my my friends tell me is really are really stupid.

39:34.534 --> 39:35.615
So they may not have

39:36.175 --> 39:37.816
as much information as we think.

39:37.876 --> 39:42.820
It may be limited to the stuff that they can glean off of social media and off of Twitter.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.784
And that would mean, for example, that they don't have access to our NSA files.

39:46.824 --> 39:51.627
They can't read my text messages, even if the NSA is reading them.

39:52.068 --> 39:55.851
These characters are not being run by people who can do that.

39:56.775 --> 40:07.649
So maybe it's Palantir, maybe it's just Elon Musk and Peter Thiel trying to demonstrate the power that they have or don't have to create these illusions.

40:08.150 --> 40:13.978
I'm sure that, for example, they're behind the sneaker things that are happening over the last year or two.

40:14.398 --> 40:17.520
and the fancy watch things that are happening over the last year or two.

40:17.580 --> 40:29.988
These trends of extreme gaudiness and extreme extravagance are being driven by the same stupid programming that's driving these people to their prominence in our society.

40:30.469 --> 40:38.914
And we have to become aware of the fact that also these two were not able to, after four and a half years, come together and have a useful discussion about anything.

40:39.555 --> 40:41.376
It was an hour and a half of bullshit.

40:42.441 --> 40:47.187
They argued about a controlled experiment to prove whether or not a golf club hits a golf ball.

40:48.989 --> 40:52.833
These are monsters and they are more importantly, traitors to America.

40:56.397 --> 40:58.580
Traitors to American children, our children.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.051
And the spread of these dangerous ideas has always been the problem.

41:05.111 --> 41:07.272
It's never been an RNA molecule.

41:07.292 --> 41:08.732
It's never been an RNA molecule.

41:08.752 --> 41:10.973
It's never been an RNA molecule.

41:11.013 --> 41:20.236
And so this show that just happened in the House of Representatives or in the Senate or wherever the hell it happened with Rand Paul was just absurd and also obnoxious.

41:23.076 --> 41:30.999
Because the bottom line is, is that if we were to sit down at a table and talk about this stuff, the only people who would agree are people that are millionaires

41:33.151 --> 41:38.194
People that are retired millionaires would agree on this stuff and everybody else would disagree with them.

41:39.855 --> 41:42.357
And that's why retired millionaires are on stage.

41:43.137 --> 41:47.680
That's why people that have a connection to the new money are on stage.

41:47.740 --> 41:56.205
That's why people that are coerced are on stage and only talk about one thing and never talk about murder.

41:58.837 --> 42:04.904
These people are on stage and they have one song to sing and it's about one subject and that's it.

42:05.485 --> 42:10.511
None of these people are able to integrate across the story and it's very significant.

42:17.099 --> 42:23.101
Because you will notice that every one of these people basically sticks to this and doesn't question this.

42:23.661 --> 42:27.783
And if they do question it, it's only, you know, on its surface.

42:28.503 --> 42:30.784
Because they really have an important message.

42:31.404 --> 42:33.745
Like, VAERS, VAERS, VAERS, and that's it.

42:34.866 --> 42:38.147
Or Massachusetts, Massachusetts, Massachusetts, that's it.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.989
Or I invented the RNA, I invented the RNA.

42:44.389 --> 42:49.753
Or I'm a systems, a complex systems guy, a complex systems guy.

42:50.174 --> 42:53.056
I understand complex systems because I do evolution and that's it.

42:54.568 --> 42:57.750
They can never integrate across the whole narrative.

42:57.790 --> 43:02.494
They can never summarize across the whole narrative, and they will never question any of these things.

43:03.054 --> 43:06.557
They won't question the fact that we've used vaccination to win in the past.

43:06.957 --> 43:10.560
They're not gonna question the fact that novel coronaviruses exist and can jump.

43:10.940 --> 43:18.126
They're never gonna question the fact that PCR false positives are evidence of something, and variants are evidence of evolution.

43:18.386 --> 43:20.988
Brett knows, he's a complex systems guy.

43:24.226 --> 43:26.247
The only debate is how many people were killed.

43:27.327 --> 43:27.908
And by what?

43:28.948 --> 43:29.728
Just not murder.

43:30.049 --> 43:30.549
Accidents.

43:30.769 --> 43:31.329
Rushing it.

43:31.489 --> 43:33.530
Protocols that were meant to help but didn't.

43:35.751 --> 43:39.213
And gain-of-function is definitely real because we have to fear RNA molecules.

43:39.253 --> 43:43.234
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with, essentially, a worst-case scenario.

43:43.755 --> 43:47.877
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with, essentially, a worst-case scenario.

43:47.977 --> 43:50.218
A worst-case scenario of prions now, of course.

43:51.538 --> 43:53.019
We're still in the car with these people.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.451
We haven't made any progress, we've just changed seats.

43:57.292 --> 44:08.659
We pulled over at a couple stops, we had restroom breaks, and we got to sit on the left side or the right side of the car, but the same bullshitter is driving, and the same bullshitter's in the passenger seat navigating us to nowhere.

44:09.399 --> 44:10.200
That's where we are.

44:10.580 --> 44:19.806
They have changed the way that we think, they've changed the way our kids think, they've changed the way the adults around us think, and if we don't get out of this frickin' car soon, we will be enslaved.

44:22.734 --> 44:42.189
My best example for you is Kevin McCairn, who I met at the very beginning of the pandemic over five or six weeks of continuous weekend streaming, where he, on the alternative days, was streaming with any ads alone or himself alone, already knew that this was a worst-case scenario coming.

44:43.584 --> 45:06.756
And the most important thing to see that has happened very recently is that this liar, Kevin McKernan, intimately connected to the Human Genome Project was out in front of the narrative already at the beginning of the pandemic and knew exactly what to say and how to get us into the groove of solving the mystery of the novel virus and where it came from and how to define it.

45:08.137 --> 45:15.101
An expert in the PCR space, he spent many hours on podcasts already at the beginning of the pandemic.

45:15.141 --> 45:24.186
And not because he didn't have a company or didn't have enough money, because he was already rich and already had a house on the Atlantic Ocean and already had $10,000 cats.

45:24.227 --> 45:30.930
So he had no reason to get into PCR, except he thought that, you know, eventually the CDC would want to test all the weed.

45:31.011 --> 45:34.753
And since he's in weed, he decided to start testing with PCR.

45:35.831 --> 45:38.120
for coronavirus on marijuana.

45:41.601 --> 45:42.882
And so why is this important?

45:42.922 --> 45:53.487
Well, number one, because he was also on in December in 2020 and still hadn't figured it out, still was dead on balls narrative for the Scooby-Doo mystery solving.

45:53.847 --> 46:10.755
And then he was involved with calling Mary Holland and making it hard for me to earn a living there, actually facilitating Mary Holland being able to create the illusion that there was some pretense for letting me go as a bad employee at CHD and he was part of it.

46:11.798 --> 46:24.628
Also other meddlers that worked with Kevin McCairn on the Vajon Health platform in the UK, the guy with the silly bow tie that always has Gerrit van den Bosch on.

46:24.648 --> 46:27.550
One little tiny network of clowns.

46:28.711 --> 46:33.075
And these two guys got promoted in the same LifeSite News article.

46:33.495 --> 46:39.760
The same LifeSite News that introduced us to Robert Malone and a lot of these other meddlers early on in the pandemic.

46:41.394 --> 46:48.138
They got featured in the same article where Kevin McCairn is presenting to the Health Alliance Australia.

46:52.421 --> 46:55.964
And on the next page you got Kevin McKernan in front of the U.S.

46:56.024 --> 46:56.324
Senate.

47:00.339 --> 47:06.741
And it's the perfect chorus of liars populated into the internet at the very beginning of the pandemic.

47:07.281 --> 47:09.502
Neither one of them had any business talking about it.

47:10.002 --> 47:12.403
They were both semi-retired for shit sake.

47:14.583 --> 47:23.386
And the striking thing about it is, is that this monkey right here has spent no less than four and a half years chasing me around like a little lap dog.

47:25.285 --> 47:39.774
You can find actually hours and hours of him dedicating all of his time to ridiculing me in some very ineffective and racist way while he vapes himself into oblivion.

47:42.676 --> 47:43.757
This is where we're at.

47:44.457 --> 47:50.841
They had no other choice but to cross over Kevin McKernan with Kevin McCairn already in 2024.

47:50.901 --> 47:54.464
That's how bad it is because they've all lied to me.

47:55.543 --> 47:58.545
They thought they were gonna get me with Bobby's book and it didn't work.

48:00.567 --> 48:02.969
They thought that they were gonna get me with this bullshit.

48:03.989 --> 48:15.198
That I wouldn't be upset if I didn't get my whole hour, that I only got seven minutes because now this preeminent panel of experts will respond to my latest distillation.

48:18.775 --> 48:22.176
It's not very fun for me to admit that I was taken by these people.

48:22.216 --> 48:31.898
It's not very fun to admit to me that if they give you enough salary and they tell you enough times that you're freaking awesome, that it's pretty hard to see through the coordinated group of liars.

48:32.378 --> 48:34.038
But it looks like Tess can see through it.

48:38.159 --> 48:41.200
But we got NATO epigirl over here, we got

48:42.092 --> 49:11.034
NATO Ebola and anthrax lady over here and we got Ditra Ebola Zika Everybody loves Rick bright up there at the top Plus some guy in the middle there who's got like a really good story about patriotism and also like seven different vices That could be used to control and manipulate him as a player in this charade

49:13.786 --> 49:14.806
And I still believed it.

49:16.587 --> 49:22.328
I believed it right until this woman yelled at me in person and got up from the table and left.

49:23.088 --> 49:27.009
I believed it right before this guy said that he didn't know me.

49:30.370 --> 49:31.910
I took longer to figure her out.

49:31.970 --> 49:36.131
I took longer to figure him out because he actually never lied to me, just sometimes didn't say anything.

49:38.652 --> 49:40.754
And so they've done the same thing to Byron Bridle.

49:40.774 --> 49:44.318
That's the whole reason why Byron Bridle has been always where he is.

49:44.478 --> 49:45.819
And this guy's part of it too.

49:45.899 --> 49:56.250
He was raised up by the PBS news hour already in 2008 to be put on the internet in place to, you know, speak out and tell us that fiat currencies were going the way of the wind or something.

49:58.803 --> 50:00.344
Just a retired pharma exec.

50:00.604 --> 50:02.805
Not much different than that retired pharma exec.

50:02.885 --> 50:09.188
Not much different than that guy who couldn't think his way out of a wet paper bag, but supposedly is a serial entrepreneur.

50:14.167 --> 50:16.128
And you know, they have the other half of this.

50:16.188 --> 50:26.953
Half of these people in this thing are not clever enough to know that Vincent Rancid Yellow is wholly lying for the same group of people that Mikovits is lying for, and that Malone is lying for.

50:27.013 --> 50:29.614
He descends from the same coffee table of monkeys.

50:30.834 --> 50:40.198
It's all Gallo, and it's all Kaprowski, and it's all Plotkin, and it's all Gardner, and it's all Hone, and Sina Bavari.

50:40.218 --> 50:43.420
It's all these people that nobody ever talks about.

50:44.394 --> 50:48.176
that all the mice really, how come you guys never talk about Daisak and Fauci?

50:48.196 --> 50:50.157
Because Daisak and Fauci are stupid.

50:50.878 --> 50:57.382
Daisak and Fauci are the fricking Scooby-Doo unmaskings that everybody's supposed to feel proud they figured it out.

50:58.422 --> 51:05.727
So we never get to Sina Bavar, we never get to David Hohn and all the other list of foreigners.

51:07.762 --> 51:11.823
Like the guy at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and his wife that Mark has reported about.

51:11.883 --> 51:14.183
Like Hilary Koprowski that Mark's reported about.

51:14.623 --> 51:22.185
Like that lady in the jungle and her husband that got, they got murdered because they probably figured out that Ebola wasn't what they said it was.

51:25.266 --> 51:26.806
He just did a show about it today.

51:26.846 --> 51:29.786
Like come on guys, at this stage you have to see.

51:30.327 --> 51:34.527
We gotta get off this train, you gotta get out of this car because it doesn't matter what car you got in.

51:34.547 --> 51:35.908
What I want is high morbidity.

51:36.468 --> 51:37.408
I want people to complain.

51:38.231 --> 51:38.671
So what do I do?

51:38.711 --> 51:46.732
They had control of the entire internet, and not in the simple way that this guy explains it, where, oh yeah, I'm a terrorist organization, we take credit for it.

51:46.852 --> 51:48.273
No, no, no, no, no.

51:50.033 --> 51:54.554
Yes, I'm a whistleblower, and I'm helping you to decide what happened.

51:54.974 --> 51:55.834
That's what they did.

51:56.214 --> 52:00.255
They convinced us that there was a mystery to solve, that these people were coming to the rescue.

52:02.715 --> 52:07.456
And as long as you don't talk about what they were doing in 2020, it sure will seem like they're coming to the rescue.

52:08.407 --> 52:15.509
But if you talk about what they did in 2020 and what they say in 2020, you're going to find out that they didn't do a whole hell of a lot.

52:18.409 --> 52:22.930
Because they want our kids to believe that they have to fear free-range RNA molecules.

52:23.410 --> 52:24.491
These people right here.

52:24.631 --> 52:25.791
These people right here.

52:28.632 --> 52:29.812
That guy over there is awful.

52:36.101 --> 52:38.282
You gotta start naming names, ladies and gentlemen.

52:38.302 --> 52:42.163
These people are playing for keeps, and these are globalists.

52:42.203 --> 53:01.248
They're playing for some other global interest that's not American, that's not for America, it's not patriotic, it's something gross, and it's something traitorous, and they need to be exposed, because this is how it's been done for decades, and social media has allowed them to do it very, very effectively the last four years.

53:02.408 --> 53:05.069
It's not the censorship of the government.

53:05.876 --> 53:22.890
It is the programming that has allowed these people right here to rise in a way that is not natural, to rise in prominence in a way that is not based on their truth-telling ability or their patriotism or their sacrifice.

53:23.831 --> 53:25.673
None of these people have lost a job.

53:27.046 --> 53:35.695
None of these people have sacrificed anything to get the truth out in a meaningful way, and none of these people had principles when we needed them to have principles.

53:36.856 --> 53:50.289
And yet now, because of careful programming of social media, the appearance that these people are the ones that had principles, and the appearance that these people are the ones on white horses, is being weaponized against us.

53:51.829 --> 54:03.735
And everyone, including these anonymous accounts, have been weaponized against us to convince us that if you're not gonna let these people be heroes, then you must definitely be working for somebody else.

54:07.096 --> 54:12.219
Are any of these guys gonna mention Joe Marshall and his book called Last Call for Liberty?

54:13.279 --> 54:16.561
You know that guy on Rumble that I mentioned the other day?

54:17.981 --> 54:19.222
Are they ever gonna mention him?

54:19.952 --> 54:31.959
Are they ever going to talk about him and him pointing out that all these people seem to be oriented around the UN and around globalist powers and talking about UNESCO and human rights instead of individual rights?

54:32.480 --> 54:33.640
Because that's the difference.

54:34.981 --> 54:36.822
Human rights is collectivism.

54:37.603 --> 54:39.564
Individual rights is individualism.

54:39.984 --> 54:44.667
Individualism is where the state protects the rights of the individual.

54:45.688 --> 54:49.370
In a collectivist state, the state protects the rights of the state.

54:51.704 --> 54:57.686
And I'm not an expert in this, but I can tell you for sure that the big picture is that these people are collectivists.

54:57.766 --> 54:59.486
They want collectivist medicine.

54:59.886 --> 55:01.887
They want collectivist data collection.

55:02.247 --> 55:03.808
They want collectivist laws.

55:04.248 --> 55:05.288
And that's all it is.

55:05.368 --> 55:09.909
And it doesn't matter whether you call it fascism or communism or totalitarianism.

55:09.929 --> 55:15.751
It's all about the state being more important, the group more important than the individual.

55:16.191 --> 55:19.592
And that is a fundamental inversion of everything that was American.

55:19.612 --> 55:21.353
And all of these people know that.

55:22.793 --> 55:24.274
And that's why they are traitors.

55:25.495 --> 55:34.081
And if they're foreigners, they're foreign meddlers, participating in a limited spectrum of debate that's about to enslave our children.

55:37.103 --> 55:46.730
And if they're attributing bad motives to me and my allies, they are doing it in a disingenuous way because they don't want to talk about the biology that we've already established

55:47.870 --> 55:49.171
is what needs to be talked about.

55:49.211 --> 55:59.159
They want you to participate in this hamster wheel where Zuby is up in Canada meeting with Steve Kirsch and meeting with Jay Bhattacharya.

55:59.179 --> 56:04.063
Did you see that?

56:04.163 --> 56:05.544
I didn't even put that in the thing.

56:05.604 --> 56:05.985
I had it.

56:06.045 --> 56:07.106
I think I had it somewhere.

56:07.146 --> 56:08.707
Let me see if I can find it really quick.

56:10.088 --> 56:14.652
I had a picture of Bhattacharya and, and,

56:18.237 --> 56:22.659
I mean, first of all, let's look at this picture, which I find very, very interesting.

56:28.562 --> 56:29.423
Can I copy that?

56:30.663 --> 56:32.604
Copy it, and then can I paste it here?

56:35.226 --> 56:36.867
Paste it, paste, yeah.

56:37.067 --> 56:38.387
So look at this picture right here.

56:38.908 --> 56:43.230
This is Peter McCullough, and this is Pierre Cory, and they're down in Australia.

56:45.151 --> 56:47.713
presumably testifying about what happened in America.

56:47.753 --> 56:56.159
Why would they need Pierre Kory and Peter McCullough to go down to Australia and testify down there with a beer in their hand?

56:56.179 --> 56:58.941
I wonder if there's a shoe picture from this.

57:01.062 --> 57:03.324
So let's see, I'll get rid of that picture.

57:05.966 --> 57:07.307
And then find another picture.

57:07.327 --> 57:11.410
I think I also had a picture of the dude.

57:13.011 --> 57:14.752
And hold on, I'll find it if I have it.

57:15.796 --> 57:17.517
Or maybe I didn't save it in this folder.

57:17.597 --> 57:18.157
I'm sorry.

57:18.217 --> 57:20.659
I should have looked before I did it.

57:21.779 --> 57:25.701
I don't see it.

57:26.001 --> 57:27.102
Don't see it.

57:28.042 --> 57:28.683
Hold on.

57:30.484 --> 57:31.024
Oh, there it is.

57:31.104 --> 57:31.524
I got it.

57:31.644 --> 57:34.005
So this one's funny, first of all.

57:34.025 --> 57:36.927
Oh, it's scary.

57:37.767 --> 57:40.729
So let's copy this, and then let's put this here.

57:44.414 --> 57:44.634
Right?

57:44.834 --> 57:45.895
So there's that one.

57:45.935 --> 57:50.997
That's Zuby and Elon Musk again.

57:51.137 --> 57:52.358
So, you know, I'm not saying anything.

57:52.398 --> 58:04.604
I'm just saying that Zuby and Dan Wilson have a series of videos that are staying up on YouTube as a legitimate debate between vaxxers and non-vaxxers or skeptics and non-skeptics or whatever the hell it is.

58:05.124 --> 58:09.947
And so then the final picture, of course, is this one, the most recent one that makes me want to vomit because

58:10.547 --> 58:18.991
Again, remember that Jay Bhattacharya has seen me in person no less than three or four times at Broken Science Initiative meetings.

58:20.612 --> 58:30.117
And at all of those meetings, he's told me that he doesn't really, you know, he's not a biologist, so he can't evaluate

58:30.817 --> 58:32.919
the biological claims that I'm making.

58:32.979 --> 58:39.624
But interestingly, I found a podcast where he was on a few days ago, The Rubin Show, actually.

58:39.664 --> 58:48.851
And he's got a lot to say that sounds a lot like biology and a lot like expertise that doesn't have anything to do with economics or epidemiology.

58:48.891 --> 58:49.292
So, you know,

58:49.932 --> 58:54.414
Call me weird, but it feels weird how these people are behaving.

58:54.494 --> 59:02.258
Because again, it's a very closed group of people that is allowed to rise in social media and allowed to argue with each other.

59:02.358 --> 59:07.601
And the limited spectrum of debate is actually composed of these liars.

59:07.661 --> 59:13.443
And it doesn't matter what stage on this Lollapalooza of liars you go to, you're always just gonna see a liar.

59:13.704 --> 59:18.166
And maybe some people that are harmonizing along with it because they don't know any better.

59:19.124 --> 59:23.127
because that person or those persons asked them to help us stop this train, would you?

59:23.668 --> 59:27.311
Can you grab along onto that next door there and just hold on?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.813
And then can you chalk up and help us push the train to start again?

59:32.915 --> 59:36.378
And the more people that participate, the harder it is to see through the illusion.

59:36.418 --> 59:42.443
The more people that were participating when you came down into the station, the harder it would be to see through the illusion.

59:43.444 --> 59:48.508
And the more noise they made, the more grunting they did, it would be harder to see through the illusion.

59:48.908 --> 59:50.390
And that's all these people are doing.

59:52.191 --> 01:00:07.624
That's why you have somebody like Claire Craig of The Heart Group in the UK saying something as absolutely absurd as you can believe there was a virus, you can believe that virus killed people, you can believe gain-of-function played a role, and in fact, it's all easier when a virus is spreading too.

01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:10.536
This is the mythology.

01:00:10.576 --> 01:00:15.218
It doesn't matter what is true if everybody perceives that the virus was there.

01:00:15.598 --> 01:00:26.843
And she's got to know that by now because of course she's very good friends with Jonathan Engler, who claims to have learned so much from me over the last couple of years.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:36.728
And the three times I presented at Panda and all the private conversations we've had and DMs we've shared on Twitter, he claims to really understand that I'm really dead on this thing.

01:00:37.128 --> 01:00:45.275
and yet here's this liar in 2021 or 22 talking bullshit about PCR testing and driving everybody into the trap

01:00:49.798 --> 01:00:51.980
Now testing itself can fail.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.942
Every test involves a compromise.

01:00:53.982 --> 01:00:54.862
You have to choose.

01:00:55.243 --> 01:00:59.746
Do I want to find every possible case or do I only want to find the definite cases?

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:03.209
And at the beginning of an epidemic, when cases are growing.

01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:05.331
Now you ought to understand, I've played this before.

01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:07.133
I won't play it now, but it's on YouTube.

01:01:07.233 --> 01:01:11.776
It never got struck from YouTube because it's part of the trap.

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:18.062
The heart group is part of the trap and their co-chairs are both liars.

01:01:20.239 --> 01:01:27.741
I know that Claire Craig is a liar because she says stuff this dumb this long into the pandemic, and because that video makes her a liar.

01:01:28.241 --> 01:01:38.264
I know that Jonathan Engler is a liar because he tried to get me to write with him for like three or four or five or six months, and other people agreed that, wow, he's a great guy.

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:39.204
He's awesome.

01:01:39.264 --> 01:01:40.665
I've known him for so long.

01:01:40.725 --> 01:01:41.945
I trust him with my life.

01:01:42.345 --> 01:01:44.586
You should write something with him because he'll help you.

01:01:50.988 --> 01:01:51.609
What did they do?

01:01:52.989 --> 01:02:13.844
They wrote this absolutely absurd review that an intrepid high schooler could have written with fields virology, basically usefully questioned nothing, did not start with any evidence that they're aware that AIDS was also kind of a hoax.

01:02:15.563 --> 01:02:40.866
not even close to aware that other shit happened with chronic fatigue syndrome and Judy Mikovits, completely unaware of Robert Malone's 20-year history and all these other people's histories with this illusion of virology, just, you know, well, according to virology, according to virology, Jonathan Engler and Professor Martin Neal say that there's not a really good explanation for this.

01:02:42.847 --> 01:02:46.289
And the funny thing is, is that they really wanted me to share it with everybody.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.729
They really wanted me to write it.

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:50.130
They really wanted me to contribute to it.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:03:01.955
But then they wrote it themselves and put me in, like, page 16, and then so terribly represented the biology that I've tried to teach them, it was absolutely absurd.

01:03:02.956 --> 01:03:09.499
And I've shown you these messages, and I'm probably going to put them on Substack so everybody can read them for themselves at their own pace.

01:03:10.444 --> 01:03:16.927
to show you how absurd it is that these people have claimed they wanted to help me for six or nine months.

01:03:18.948 --> 01:03:32.654
All the communication on Twitter, anytime we tried to take it to email like ProtonMail, it all went fizzled out because these characters like to work on Twitter because I'm assuming that means that other people

01:03:33.837 --> 01:03:41.099
with added administrative privileges or super user privileges can see how we're being manipulated and contribute to it usefully.

01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:47.841
Don't reply to Jonathan Cooey until you check our DMs first so you know what we've been telling him to expect.

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:53.282
It's that kind of operation that these liars are involved in.

01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:58.679
And I'm sorry, but I'm not afraid to say it anymore.

01:03:58.719 --> 01:04:10.381
I think all of these people are working against America and the Americans that are working with them are working with NATO or working with Five Eyes intelligence agencies or weaponized piles of money that are working with Five Eyes.

01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:11.021
I don't know.

01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:12.141
It's a crime.

01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:15.462
These people are liars and they're definitely not patriots.

01:04:15.502 --> 01:04:20.223
And the meddlers that spend all of their time, think about Sky News Australia.

01:04:20.703 --> 01:04:35.639
that can spend a whole half an hour segment, not on the screwed up place that Australia is with the screwed up laws and the lack of rights and the lack of weapons and the lack of freedom, but they can spend a half an hour a night making fun of the political system of America.

01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:36.940
That's not by chance.

01:04:37.381 --> 01:04:40.804
That's part of the same operation that I think Jiki Leaks is a part of.

01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:59.570
It is a coordinated five eyes and traitorous Americans lying festival that is being essentially amplified and honed and focused on America by these social media organizations, primarily Twitter.

01:05:01.138 --> 01:05:02.639
That's what we're dealing with here.

01:05:03.019 --> 01:05:12.205
It is a very dark place because we thought Twitter was something that we could use, but it was being used against us in the most malevolent way that we never thought possible.

01:05:12.545 --> 01:05:22.991
That the anonymous accounts and these coordinated liar groups were all working together to create the illusion of a whirlwind of discussion.

01:05:24.512 --> 01:05:29.115
And each one of us was probably isolated inside of every discussion we've ever been in.

01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:34.673
And every time we thought we figured out another liar, there were two more liars behind them.

01:05:34.733 --> 01:05:38.794
And so we were never actually peeling black the scenery meaningfully.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:47.838
And that's why in 2024, these two posers wrote an article that basically says Virology 101 doesn't have an easy explanation.

01:05:47.898 --> 01:05:49.078
That's the best they can do.

01:05:50.599 --> 01:05:55.861
After countless hours of me trying to teach them what clones are and why it's significant, this is the best they could do.

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:08.871
They can't come to understand the conflated background signal and how that might've been used with disingenuous testing to represent something that wasn't there.

01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:13.239
They just can't quite figure that out because they are liars.

01:06:16.887 --> 01:06:24.470
because Claire Craig, Jonathan Engler, Martin Neal, and anybody associated with them is basically liars.

01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:30.934
The Hart Group has been exposed as being co-chaired by two liars.

01:06:31.034 --> 01:06:34.295
And now I would like to present you the Johnson staff meeting.

01:06:34.335 --> 01:06:39.198
Now, the reason why the Johnson staff meeting is interesting is because the last time I heard from

01:06:39.918 --> 01:06:47.961
Jessica Hockett, who is somebody who actually is responsible for me having a relationship with Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal.

01:06:48.001 --> 01:06:53.322
The last time I heard from her was when she was going to release this video on Twitter.

01:06:53.822 --> 01:06:57.343
And since then, she hasn't done a substack and she hasn't really done a tweet.

01:06:57.704 --> 01:06:58.804
And I don't know what's going on.

01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:10.948
Now there is a little clue that we have because Mark got some message that he decided to post on his sub stack and you can see what Jessica sent to Mark on his sub stack.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:13.429
That's all I know.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:22.050
Now for me, that's a little bit strange, but I wanna watch this staff meeting.

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.951
Now, the reason why I need to put it into a little bit of context first,

01:07:29.751 --> 01:07:36.793
is that it's important for you to understand that Ron Johnson actually is in my phone.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:42.895
And Ron Johnson actually contacted me on the same day that Bobby Kennedy contacted me in April of 2022.

01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:48.837
And they both told me the same story that Robert Malone made them watch my podcast.

01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:56.159
And in fact, made them watch my podcast where Charles Rixey had come to my house and done a podcast stream with me.

01:07:58.191 --> 01:07:59.852
or maybe it was the second one we did.

01:08:01.694 --> 01:08:12.302
But the point is, is that I was made to believe that a podcast that I did with Charles Rixey about the diffuse proposal was important enough that Robert Malone told Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:08:13.803 --> 01:08:17.206
and Senator Ron Johnson to sit down and watch that.

01:08:17.246 --> 01:08:22.690
And then that spurred both of them to call me and actually spurred Bobby to ask me to be a consultant for his book.

01:08:24.107 --> 01:08:30.829
This is very significant part of the reason why I am where I am and doing what I'm doing right now.

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:36.651
So if you don't understand this one little fact and how significant it is, that that's what Bobby told me.

01:08:37.651 --> 01:08:41.372
That's what Senator Ron Johnson told me in April of 22.

01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:42.933
I can't change that.

01:08:43.073 --> 01:08:45.714
I was on my, in my lawn with my wife.

01:08:45.974 --> 01:08:48.074
Both phone calls happened within a half an hour.

01:08:48.094 --> 01:08:50.195
I was absolutely floored.

01:08:51.863 --> 01:08:54.264
I thought I was about to get a trip to D.C.

01:08:54.324 --> 01:08:54.764
or something.

01:08:55.985 --> 01:08:57.465
But of course, that's not what happened.

01:08:57.485 --> 01:09:07.470
And in fact, I was in and out of contact with Senator Ron Johnson, but we never had a Zoom meeting or a phone call really, other than, you know, very briefly to say, wow, that's really great, let me know.

01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:14.820
Now that makes this in context a little different, right?

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.886
Because I was already in contact with Senator Ron Johnson for two and a half years.

01:09:20.387 --> 01:09:27.596
And then this person that I recently met on the Internet named Jessica Hockett was able to get the attention of his staff on Twitter.

01:09:29.642 --> 01:09:36.645
and arranged a meeting where she and a colleague of hers and myself would be able to present.

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:44.389
And the way that I was told that it was going to be was we each take about 10 or 15 minutes and then there would be time at the end for them to ask questions.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:49.173
And so let's see what happened in that meeting.

01:09:49.454 --> 01:10:03.388
And I think this meeting is, I copied down the meeting that Jessica put up on Twitter, because putting these things up on Twitter, see, the other thing that's really funny is that my name is spelled wrong.

01:10:03.428 --> 01:10:04.690
A lot of times they do that.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:07.112
I don't know why that is, but yeah.

01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:09.155
It's just very strange.

01:10:09.295 --> 01:10:09.635
I don't know.

01:10:09.695 --> 01:10:12.479
It's, you know, it can be hard to spell a five letter name.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.681
Um, so let's go full screen.

01:10:15.222 --> 01:10:17.024
I'm also, oh yeah, sorry.

01:10:17.044 --> 01:10:17.525
I got to switch.

01:10:19.935 --> 01:10:23.116
I also, I'm gonna leave it at normal speed because it's only an hour.

01:10:24.076 --> 01:10:25.236
And so I think we can handle it.

01:10:25.276 --> 01:10:28.377
And all the questions are fast forwarded out.

01:10:28.517 --> 01:10:35.139
So it's gonna be a little difficult to always right away pick up on what question that she's asking.

01:10:35.179 --> 01:10:40.581
So now remember, I was told that we were each gonna present for about 15 minutes or 10 minutes.

01:10:41.281 --> 01:10:44.502
And so I guess I kind of knew that I was gonna go last.

01:10:46.718 --> 01:10:53.772
But from the perspective of message, I have to say that in retrospect, I'm

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:56.371
I'm underwhelmed.

01:10:57.992 --> 01:11:00.613
And so I wonder how you will feel about it.

01:11:00.633 --> 01:11:02.414
I actually really liked the middle guy a lot.

01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:10.739
He's actually, John Kadamy actually does a really nice presentation as well, and some data that I hadn't seen before.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:16.843
But it's kind of redundant relative to what Jessica says.

01:11:16.943 --> 01:11:24.588
But anyway, you'll see there's Senator Ron Johnson's staff occasionally might be visible, but for the most part, it's just the presentation.

01:11:24.608 --> 01:11:24.868
Here we go.

01:11:26.823 --> 01:11:38.671
All right, so the title of this content that we're going to show to you, New York City Spring 2020 Mass Casualty Event Without, that should say without proof or explanation, pardon my typo here.

01:11:39.171 --> 01:11:56.263
And the reason that we're here, one of my overall points and sort of the impetus for my independent investigation into the NYC event is that I'm contending that the federal government has not explained or substantiated with even the most basic proof

01:11:56.857 --> 01:12:00.602
the biggest mass casualty event in the history of a U.S.

01:12:00.662 --> 01:12:02.084
city or history of the U.S.

01:12:02.545 --> 01:12:04.067
as far as I can tell.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:09.394
So as we go through this, we've divided this into three sections.

01:12:09.454 --> 01:12:14.701
I'll begin and highlight some things about the magnitude and scale of the New York City event.

01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:21.804
and give some, just a few examples of contradictions between the official narrative and the official data.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:33.313
Then I'm gonna transition to Dr. Kidemi and he's going to show some other kind of bigger picture statistics and place New York City in the context of the United States.

01:12:33.874 --> 01:12:38.798
I'll talk a little bit about the lack of proof that we have for this event.

01:12:39.218 --> 01:12:49.744
And then we'll go to Dr. Cui and he'll make some comments and points about the biological plausibility of the New York City event in the context of what I've shown.

01:12:51.345 --> 01:13:04.312
So I wanna start out with what's probably the most striking visual as just a reminder and an illustration of what is being purported to have occurred in the spring of 2020.

01:13:05.646 --> 01:13:13.148
This is deaths occurring daily in New York City from January 1st, 2019 through the end of 2020.

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:25.072
And I think it's fair to say that if somebody didn't have dates on this graph or you just showed it to them and said, hey, what do you think happened here?

01:13:25.112 --> 01:13:26.572
What do you think happened in this city?

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.692
People might say things like, well, it looks like a bomb went off.

01:13:31.113 --> 01:13:35.175
Looks like there was an earthquake and some aftershocks afterwards.

01:13:35.736 --> 01:13:44.001
But one thing that it doesn't really look like is a spreading virus or even a deadly coronavirus.

01:13:44.582 --> 01:13:54.769
We have nothing going on in mortality, in daily deaths in the city whatsoever until the federal government announces

01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:57.220
15 days to slow the spread.

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:01.883
And that announcement is almost like a trigger.

01:14:03.224 --> 01:14:12.290
In the deaths, we see a base to peak jump in a matter of about 15 days of about 750 or so percent.

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.632
We go from around 150 deaths or so a day to a peak of 1,200 deaths in one day.

01:14:22.486 --> 01:14:28.108
almost as inexplicable as that rise is the drop.

01:14:29.009 --> 01:14:44.415
So we peak, then we drop back down to baseline by the end of May, and then we basically have no sign of anything unusual going on until the end of the year after the COVID shot

01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:55.785
is implemented or after it's available, it starts to creep up a little bit, really not more until January or February, Dr. Kademi can talk more about that.

01:14:56.445 --> 01:15:02.126
But we have an event here that is unlike anything that we've ever seen.

01:15:02.306 --> 01:15:07.487
It's unlike anything that we see anywhere else in the United States or that New York has ever experienced.

01:15:08.388 --> 01:15:10.428
And a lot of these deaths

01:15:11.363 --> 01:15:18.927
most, not all, but a lot of the deaths in that event attribute COVID-19 as underlying cause.

01:15:18.968 --> 01:15:28.333
And when we separate out the COVID-19 underlying cause from the non-COVID, we see that there is non-COVID excess, about 6,000, 7,000 deaths there.

01:15:28.913 --> 01:15:33.696
Interestingly enough, we have non-COVID excess lasting for less time.

01:15:33.716 --> 01:15:37.198
It was a shorter event than the COVID event.

01:15:38.779 --> 01:15:40.340
But both, both

01:15:40.765 --> 01:15:55.671
categories of death here effectively disappear for the rest of the year in terms of excess, which is pretty remarkable when you consider that after the spring, New York still had a lot of mitigations in place.

01:15:56.072 --> 01:16:06.476
We had a lot of, I would say some modest chaos going on, not only in New York City, but in cities around the United States with different protests and unrest things are going on.

01:16:06.906 --> 01:16:10.849
But it's like nothing was happening at all in New York City.

01:16:10.909 --> 01:16:16.713
And it really just, it defies, on its face, prima facie, it defies belief.

01:16:17.854 --> 01:16:23.058
The official government story and media story goes something like this.

01:16:24.153 --> 01:16:31.199
New York City got hit harder than everywhere else, except maybe Northern Italy, by a spreading coronavirus.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.705
They didn't know how to handle it, but they really learned very quickly and basically defeated the virus.

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:41.948
They showed everybody how to handle it, everybody else.

01:16:42.248 --> 01:17:02.874
So here's a good place to say that Kyle Seidel was the top pinned tweet of Kevin McCairn in April of 2020 and that Kyle Seidel was the guy who had a video posted where people were being given 60 liters a minute and he was complaining about the lack of oxygen that some hospitals might have.

01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:12.896
And so this is an interesting thing to leave out here because of course, we know it wasn't just ventilators or remdesivir.

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:19.180
And so it's not really clear why there isn't any mentioned of the protocols here yet as to why people might've died.

01:17:19.721 --> 01:17:21.382
Learned from New York experience.

01:17:22.883 --> 01:17:28.948
Cuomo gets an Emmy, later taken away, but yay Rob, bravo, bravo, New York.

01:17:30.069 --> 01:17:31.290
A lot of the mortality

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:36.100
is blamed on spread in nursing homes.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:50.706
And part of that narrative is- And we know that in nursing homes, we had somebody, Robert Malone, tell us in August of 2021, that they were killing a lot of people in New York and elsewhere by giving them dexamethasone at the hospital and sending them back to care homes.

01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:53.908
And dexamethasone being a hammer for the immune system.

01:17:53.928 --> 01:17:58.170
So getting rid of any symptoms so that they could be sent home and they would die of pneumonia.

01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:01.191
That is something that could be on this slide too.

01:18:01.391 --> 01:18:05.413
is that we had COVID positive patients discharged from nursing homes.

01:18:05.493 --> 01:18:10.835
Nursing homes had to accept them and it spread COVID everywhere and killed nursing home residents.

01:18:11.095 --> 01:18:16.058
That's pretty contradictory to the data as I'll show in a little bit, but that's part of the story.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:23.943
And also the idea is, well, you know, mistakes were made, but it would have been a lot worse if there was no response.

01:18:24.384 --> 01:18:26.685
And the response came just in time.

01:18:27.085 --> 01:18:36.392
The virus was silently spreading, and whoo, the federal government like shut things down, you know, death takes off, but it would have been a lot worse.

01:18:36.672 --> 01:18:40.195
So we should appreciate the prescience of the government.

01:18:40.275 --> 01:18:42.437
That's sort of the narrative that we see.

01:18:42.457 --> 01:18:44.538
And I think- Go ahead, go ahead.

01:18:46.539 --> 01:18:52.321
I think it had the effect of an executive order telling everybody we're shutting it down for 15 days.

01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:54.742
Now, does that actually have the weight of law?

01:18:55.422 --> 01:19:02.245
Not necessarily, but I do find it really interesting and I'll show this in other data as well that in New York City,

01:19:03.165 --> 01:19:16.390
really anywhere in the United States, and John can confirm this, but we don't see anything going on in any kind of mortality data, any kind of rise in 911 calls, nothing until 15 days to slow the spread.

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:21.212
It's like it all hinges on that, which is ridiculous, right?

01:19:21.492 --> 01:19:24.553
But that's when the data starts to go up.

01:19:24.913 --> 01:19:27.775
So that's, it's like a hinge point, so to speak.

01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:31.256
So I understand what you're saying entirely, but that's,

01:19:31.994 --> 01:19:33.696
That's the point where things start to rise.

01:19:34.297 --> 01:19:34.537
Thanks.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.981
And yeah, whenever you have questions like that, please, please jump in.

01:19:38.622 --> 01:19:44.769
So part of our pushback on that would be that a Corona viruses, no matter what they are, don't hit.

01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:48.194
that they're not bombs, they don't have the effect of a bomb.

01:19:48.495 --> 01:20:02.132
We don't see a sign of any risk, I would say risk additive pathogens silently spreading before that declaration, which there could be some explanations for that, but none of them have to do with viral spread.

01:20:03.348 --> 01:20:12.074
I would say that most, if not all, legitimate excess deaths in New York City were iatrogenic and caused by the response, so to speak.

01:20:12.894 --> 01:20:22.601
The data we have don't allow primary blame to be placed either on COVID positive patients being put into nursing homes or some of the other explanations that you hear, like use of ventilators.

01:20:22.881 --> 01:20:29.285
We don't even have the data to show how many people were put on and off

01:20:29.895 --> 01:20:30.716
ventilators.

01:20:30.736 --> 01:20:32.357
The census max, I think, is around 2,700.

01:20:32.618 --> 01:20:37.963
That is a far cry from what the hospital toll is purported to be.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:47.872
And I think there's good reason to suspect, and I know Dr. Khademi and I agree on this, that the curve is at minimum manipulated.

01:20:48.252 --> 01:20:50.897
Now, that could mean that there's some fabrication.

01:20:51.017 --> 01:20:54.322
It could mean that there's some time shifting going on.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:21:01.053
Deaths from the past, classified, reclassified, deaths from the future, all kind of put into this

01:21:01.601 --> 01:21:05.444
you know, fantasy, I would call it a fantasy of a spike.

01:21:05.604 --> 01:21:11.329
And so really we're, she's emphasizing the fact that they're not using the word murder.

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:13.711
Murder really wasn't done, it doesn't seem like.

01:21:13.792 --> 01:21:17.975
Some excess deaths were iatrogenic, were caused by the response.

01:21:21.858 --> 01:21:25.462
But for the most part, she's advocating that this is fraud, which is interesting.

01:21:25.522 --> 01:21:28.024
And it's also, yeah, it's interesting.

01:21:30.697 --> 01:21:36.979
Just a couple more illustrations of magnitude, because I think a lot of people... Go ahead, go ahead.

01:21:37.039 --> 01:21:38.339
I'll clarify that more further.

01:21:38.359 --> 01:21:47.462
Yes, I think it's a lie, and I'll clarify what I mean by that exactly, because I don't necessarily mean that there's 10,000 fabricated deaths in there.

01:21:48.423 --> 01:21:51.025
I wrote an article about that last week that I could forward to you.

01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:53.748
Like, what do I mean when I say that the curve is fraudulent?

01:21:53.988 --> 01:21:59.634
That it's a misrepresentation and doesn't reflect what actually occurred on the ground in real time.

01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:01.976
So that's a great question.

01:22:01.996 --> 01:22:03.037
I'll come back around to that.

01:22:03.658 --> 01:22:07.822
in terms of scale, because I think a lot of people are like, well, 8 million people live in New York City.

01:22:07.862 --> 01:22:13.527
So of course, 27,000 extra people died in 11 weeks.

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:19.512
It really is astounding to consider the number of bodies that they are saying that were handled.

01:22:20.173 --> 01:22:20.934
It's incredible.

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:22.775
I call this one the Aprils.

01:22:23.236 --> 01:22:26.479
And we have like a normal April is around 4,500 deaths, right?

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:36.914
And then April 2020, we have 20,000 extra people that are purported to have died.

01:22:38.114 --> 01:22:39.835
We also see, let me illustrate.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:40.915
I don't know why this isn't doing this.

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:41.776
There we go.

01:22:41.936 --> 01:22:48.859
If we look at the, in terms of the number of bodies that are purported to be handled and we compare it

01:22:49.434 --> 01:22:55.118
to the scale of death in the World Trade Center disaster, which is around 2,800, between 2,700 and 2,800 deaths in that particular event.

01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:59.100
We can see in this graph that only shows the amount above increase, so the amount above normal.

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:26.162
New York City is saying, I would say the federal government has officiated this and is saying, or validated this and is saying, that New York City experienced eight World Trade Center disasters in six weeks, with most of those being in the first four weeks or so.

01:23:26.943 --> 01:23:32.807
It's incredible to think about the number of people they're saying that have died.

01:23:36.024 --> 01:23:41.187
Another comparison that's worth considering is just New York City versus Chicago.

01:23:41.807 --> 01:23:44.868
Demographically, these cities are very comparable.

01:23:45.008 --> 01:23:52.772
It's true that New York City- It would be very interesting, I think Janet Reno is right, it would be very interesting to see when she actually started talking about this.

01:23:52.792 --> 01:23:55.714
Because again, I don't know who she was until very recently.

01:23:56.634 --> 01:23:59.495
And we first came into contact when she contacted me.

01:24:00.756 --> 01:24:04.778
And so then right away, I was put in touch with some of these people from Panda again.

01:24:05.358 --> 01:24:10.401
Remember that Panda is an organization that I presented at no more than no less than three times.

01:24:11.061 --> 01:24:15.123
And in fact, the second time I presented at Panda was the first time that

01:24:15.743 --> 01:24:22.926
Jennifer and Mary the virologist showed up at that meeting and followed me around at those meetings until I decided not to come back.

01:24:23.466 --> 01:24:28.889
And Mary the virologist actually also did a couple podcasts with Kevin McCarran around the same time.

01:24:29.409 --> 01:24:38.093
And so I'm genuinely interested to know how long she has been pushing the

01:24:39.752 --> 01:24:42.694
the idea that we should revisit New York City.

01:24:42.754 --> 01:24:57.206
Because if it's after all these people that could be prosecuted are out of office and after all these people that ran these nursing homes are already gone, it's interesting to note that maybe not a lot could be done with this information.

01:24:58.046 --> 01:25:04.892
It is denser insofar as where people live or how many people live in a square mile.

01:25:05.412 --> 01:25:06.313
But Chicago

01:25:06.937 --> 01:25:11.320
announced its first case in January, January 24th, 2020.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.902
New York City announced its first case on March 1st, 2020.

01:25:17.823 --> 01:25:29.270
In both cases, mortality- I would encourage anybody who's interested in looking into Jessica Hockett to look into, first and foremost, see what Mark posted on his sub stack.

01:25:30.611 --> 01:25:30.991
Because

01:25:32.075 --> 01:25:35.417
I don't know anything about what was posted on his substack.

01:25:35.677 --> 01:25:39.518
But what was posted on his substack apparently has something to do with me.

01:25:41.019 --> 01:25:44.461
And she said that she's not going to talk to him anymore because of me.

01:25:45.461 --> 01:25:48.282
But I'm not aware of this.

01:25:49.723 --> 01:25:53.845
The last message I have of her is actually really interesting because

01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:01.658
if I were to play it right now, which some people would say that's kind of crappy.

01:26:02.677 --> 01:26:05.558
But if I were to play it right now, I think you'd actually be really surprised.

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:12.019
Because it's the day before she released this video on Twitter, she sent me a really nice message.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:17.720
And the message only had content in it, actually, that's notable.

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:28.242
The content was her urging me once again to give Jonathan Engler and Martin Neil the benefit of the doubt.

01:26:30.655 --> 01:26:40.758
even though I have a couple weeks of, and maybe even longer of time when I'm trying to tell her I don't trust them, I think they're bad guys.

01:26:41.218 --> 01:26:43.218
And she keeps insisting that I should trust them.

01:26:43.979 --> 01:26:53.341
And then she released this video on that Thursday, and then you get a message, Mark gets a message that you see on his sub stack.

01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:56.131
We don't know what's going on.

01:26:56.151 --> 01:26:58.193
We just know that something's wacky here.

01:26:58.774 --> 01:27:03.838
And that absolutely positively coincides with her disappearance on Twitter and Substack.

01:27:06.641 --> 01:27:15.969
Unless some miraculous maneuver is made, I don't see how this isn't a catastrophic nosedive.

01:27:18.888 --> 01:27:35.225
Now, remember, this is us supposedly getting a chance to present to two staffers of Senator Ron Johnson, who I've been in contact, personal contact with, since Senator Ron Johnson was recommended to watch my podcast by Robert Malone.

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:41.452
And yet somehow or another, I can't get an audience with this staff until Jessica Hockett comes along.

01:27:42.898 --> 01:27:47.983
And now her and her friend are gonna present first, and then I'm gonna present afterward.

01:27:48.023 --> 01:27:49.224
That's what we're watching right here.

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:56.330
Does not rise until that 15 days to slow the spread.

01:27:56.971 --> 01:28:02.416
But the magnitude of Chicago versus New York, it's not even close.

01:28:03.096 --> 01:28:09.322
So the idea that a coronavirus of any kind, doesn't matter where we wanna say it came from,

01:28:09.773 --> 01:28:13.416
that it caused such differential damage.

01:28:13.556 --> 01:28:14.877
That's pretty extraordinary.

01:28:14.937 --> 01:28:18.360
That is making sure not to question the narrative.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.662
It doesn't matter, it's a coronavirus.

01:28:20.682 --> 01:28:23.204
It doesn't matter what kind of coronavirus it is, it couldn't do this.

01:28:24.665 --> 01:28:30.249
In Chicago versus New York City, it's almost borderline.

01:28:30.309 --> 01:28:33.292
July 2021 is already a whole year late, just so you know.

01:28:34.929 --> 01:28:44.244
It's a whole year late that July, 2021 is a month after Brett Weinstein, Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone podcast.

01:28:44.304 --> 01:28:49.932
And it's a month after Naomi Wolf spoke out for the first time about the shots.

01:28:51.144 --> 01:28:56.648
all the same couple of months window where everybody decided to find principles.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:57.389
Isn't it funny?

01:28:57.689 --> 01:28:58.970
I'm insulting.

01:28:59.190 --> 01:28:59.971
There have to be.

01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:07.036
Keep in mind that I had already lost my job a whole six months before any of these people pulled their head out of their ass.

01:29:07.096 --> 01:29:07.837
It's weird.

01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:15.823
It's really weird how all of them have 10 times as many followers as us, even though they're supposedly censored too.

01:29:16.163 --> 01:29:17.544
Other explanations.

01:29:19.076 --> 01:29:29.625
Yes, that's not in this presentation, but my colleague Jonathan Engler from the UK and I have each, he did it first, but he's taken a really close look at that.

01:29:30.045 --> 01:29:37.592
Northern Italy is the only area or city that we, like smaller geographical unit, that we've been able to tell

01:29:38.672 --> 01:29:41.934
exceeds New York City only by a little bit.

01:29:42.034 --> 01:29:46.216
And it was timed about two weeks sooner than New York.

01:29:46.236 --> 01:29:57.262
So if Senator Johnson is interested in the in-depth analysis of that, Dr. Engler, Dr. Engler and I can certainly send that to him or accommodate any questions about that.

01:29:58.343 --> 01:29:59.023
Great question.

01:30:00.904 --> 01:30:03.265
Just a quick comparison.

01:30:03.305 --> 01:30:06.087
Like I said, Dr. Kademi, we'll get into this a little bit later.

01:30:07.214 --> 01:30:16.429
When we look at other metro areas through the summer, again, we see, and this isn't adjusted for population, but that's not what I'm trying to show.

01:30:16.509 --> 01:30:20.295
I'm trying to show here just the increase from baseline.

01:30:21.551 --> 01:30:29.355
to a metro area's own baseline, New York City, head and shoulders by quite a bit of everybody else.

01:30:29.395 --> 01:30:32.417
We just never saw that scale of event again.

01:30:32.497 --> 01:30:49.366
And the sheer scale of magnitude and speed of that event, both by itself and versus other locations, just, I mean, even just for a high schooler, you don't even have to have an advanced degree to say like, I'm not sure that this was really a spreading coronavirus that was the cause of this.

01:30:50.046 --> 01:30:51.848
A couple other quick points about that.

01:30:52.329 --> 01:31:01.760
I think when we consider spreading anything, we expect to see signals in at least two places.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.907
There's more than this, but at least two I think are worth highlighting that we don't see anything in.

01:31:07.645 --> 01:31:15.289
We would expect to see maybe a rise or certain age groups that are more susceptible to this pathogen.

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:24.495
We would maybe see a signal in their deaths first in all-cause mortality, like in the 80 plus or 75 plus.

01:31:25.475 --> 01:31:26.936
That's not what we see.

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:36.041
Instead, we see a simultaneous rise and significant excess death in all adult age groups from the 20s

01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:37.901
on up.

01:31:38.662 --> 01:31:39.583
It's really astounding.

01:31:39.623 --> 01:31:50.833
Now I put these on two different graphs and two different axes, you know, so that- It's not really like she's arguing that this is evidence that there wasn't a spreading pathogen.

01:31:50.873 --> 01:31:53.215
She's just saying that it was across age groups.

01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:57.039
I think Pierre Corey would agree that it's across all age groups.

01:31:57.079 --> 01:31:59.541
He told us that it was all across all age groups.

01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:02.484
All these people had low pulse ox.

01:32:04.858 --> 01:32:06.580
that you can see the scale.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:12.785
Obviously, normally younger adults don't die at the same magnitude as older adults do, right?

01:32:13.126 --> 01:32:19.432
But New York, as far as myself and Jonathan Engler, my colleague I mentioned earlier, we can tell

01:32:19.972 --> 01:32:23.735
New York City is a global outlier with the younger deaths.

01:32:23.995 --> 01:32:29.559
And by that, I mean like under age 65 all at once in any period.

01:32:29.739 --> 01:32:35.243
And a lot of those are blamed on COVID-19 underlying cause, which is pretty astounding.

01:32:35.943 --> 01:32:39.386
We also see all places of death rose at once.

01:32:39.466 --> 01:32:43.029
This is from CDC wonder on every death certificate.

01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:45.610
It says the kind of place where people die.

01:32:46.031 --> 01:32:47.232
You might expect to see

01:32:48.274 --> 01:32:51.016
nursing homes maybe rise sooner.

01:32:51.116 --> 01:32:55.439
You might expect to see something of a signal, maybe in hospital, inpatient.

01:32:55.479 --> 01:32:56.539
It just kind of depends.

01:32:56.599 --> 01:33:04.364
I could argue different ways on that with where we might expect to see a spreading coronavirus, a signal of it come up.

01:33:04.404 --> 01:33:11.789
But that- The other interesting thing to note here, and I would like somebody who's got the time and the effort to do it to find out how long the

01:33:12.589 --> 01:33:21.717
the executive order that Cuomo ordered for New York State, where he said that, you know, there was no malpractice for COVID cases or something like that.

01:33:21.757 --> 01:33:23.098
There was a special order.

01:33:23.638 --> 01:33:29.203
And so it'd be very interesting to note if the special order expired around the same time that the deaths were expiring.

01:33:29.223 --> 01:33:30.424
That's not what we see here.

01:33:30.824 --> 01:33:37.770
We see all places of death simultaneously rise as soon as that 15 days to slow the spread is called.

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:40.212
I think there's a misconception

01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:53.248
about where the number of people and the magnitude of people and where they died, because so much attention was put on Governor Cuomo and his so-called nurse, what people call the nursing home policy.

01:33:53.948 --> 01:34:00.492
But the most number of people by far died in hospitals and in hospital inpatient.

01:34:00.836 --> 01:34:03.699
And to this day, this is really important, I think, for the senator to know.

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:09.887
To this day, we have no idea how many nursing home residents total died in this period.

01:34:10.307 --> 01:34:13.851
Because you could be a nursing home resident and die in the nursing home.

01:34:14.212 --> 01:34:16.735
You could be a nursing home resident and die in the hospital.

01:34:17.296 --> 01:34:19.979
I know somebody whose father

01:34:20.936 --> 01:34:30.910
got sick in the nursing home or was really deteriorating in the nursing home in New York City in the spring and then ended up coming home to his home to die, right?

01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:32.953
So we need that data.

01:34:33.153 --> 01:34:36.618
We need to know total how many nursing home residents died.

01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:44.397
But right now we've got death, not just in nursing homes, but in other places of death as well.

01:34:45.017 --> 01:34:54.942
The most death that attributed COVID as underlying cause, again, was not in hospitals, or excuse me, was not in nursing homes, it was in hospitals.

01:34:55.043 --> 01:35:03.447
And I don't think I need to remind anybody on this call that hospitals received incentives for, I would call them incentives,

01:35:03.837 --> 01:35:10.564
received payment for COVID patients during that period and for a long time afterwards.

01:35:11.104 --> 01:35:24.178
So if for no other reason, we need investigation of what occurred here, because I feel like what happened in hospitals is being kept inside a black box, even though that's where the most death and the most COVID death occurred.

01:35:26.138 --> 01:35:38.350
I want to highlight a couple other pieces of data before I turn things over to Dr. Kodemi, and that is with deaths concerning deaths at home, and then also go back to deaths in hospitals.

01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:45.576
We had that, I would call it a national campaign that launched telling people to stay home and save lives.

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:49.380
But the fact is we had a lot of people die at home.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:36:03.531
And it was during a time when emergency department visits in New York City plummeted 60% as deaths at home skyrocketed 400% from base to peak.

01:36:04.312 --> 01:36:10.998
Now, some of this people have, and I would say the government was, this was the government messaging at the time too.

01:36:11.038 --> 01:36:17.103
It was that, well, people are staying away from the hospital because they're obeying orders or they're afraid.

01:36:17.403 --> 01:36:18.464
They're afraid of the virus.

01:36:18.817 --> 01:36:20.618
But you know what's funny about New York City?

01:36:21.598 --> 01:36:27.601
Calls, 911 calls and ambulance dispatches went up about 25%.

01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:34.224
Again, right when they call 15 days to slow the spread, they go up.

01:36:34.804 --> 01:36:37.925
So people were calling for help.

01:36:38.846 --> 01:36:46.649
I'm not saying some people weren't staying away from the hospital too, but we've got a ton of calls going on and ambulances being dispatched.

01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:56.195
But at the same time, we have a drop in ambulances that brought patients to the hospital.

01:36:57.056 --> 01:36:58.577
So people are calling for help.

01:36:59.438 --> 01:37:00.758
Ambulances are going out.

01:37:01.159 --> 01:37:04.221
But people aren't being brought to the hospital.

01:37:04.301 --> 01:37:08.383
Some are, obviously, but not as much as we would expect.

01:37:09.684 --> 01:37:11.786
Another data point along these lines.

01:37:12.106 --> 01:37:12.366
Go ahead.

01:37:12.406 --> 01:37:12.806
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:12.966 --> 01:37:13.647
Go ahead.

01:37:18.257 --> 01:37:19.619
Well, hold on a second with that.

01:37:19.639 --> 01:37:20.721
I'm going to get to that.

01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:26.690
But first, I want to say, and I don't have it in this presentation, 911 calls did go up in New York.

01:37:26.970 --> 01:37:28.132
They didn't in Chicago.

01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:30.856
I think that's really interesting.

01:37:30.896 --> 01:37:32.638
In fact, they went down a little bit in Chicago.

01:37:36.124 --> 01:37:40.827
Yes, but I also know what emergency medical services was being told.

01:37:41.308 --> 01:37:47.852
Emergency medical services in New York and elsewhere actually was being told to keep people away from hospitals.

01:37:48.313 --> 01:37:54.978
They were given different directives about how to handle people in cardiac arrest, and I'll get to that data in a second.

01:37:55.398 --> 01:37:55.838
So I think-

01:37:57.737 --> 01:38:17.400
but let's and I'm not saying I've looked more in more granular data on on the calls there is some suggestion that there's some worried well but there was also a massive cardiac worried well worried well is a term used by by uh by James Giordano

01:38:20.331 --> 01:38:23.735
arrest event that I'll show you in just a second.

01:38:24.255 --> 01:38:26.197
I think we have all the answers here.

01:38:26.257 --> 01:38:36.408
Really, I've been on this inquiry for a couple years, and what we need is investigation of this because the explanations that are given, well, people are just panicking.

01:38:37.869 --> 01:38:45.693
A lot of this conflicts with the data and with first responders that I've spoken with and that I've interviewed firsthand.

01:38:46.133 --> 01:38:50.755
Now, a little bit to your point, there was a massive rise.

01:38:51.055 --> 01:39:04.602
It seems that the dispatches, this is two different scales here, but a lot of it is driven, not all of it, but a substantial number is driven by dispatches where medical aid was refused.

01:39:05.562 --> 01:39:06.743
Now, normally,

01:39:07.981 --> 01:39:12.384
final disposition code, these are people that were not taken to the hospital.

01:39:13.005 --> 01:39:14.866
Now, it's not clear.

01:39:15.206 --> 01:39:20.230
Refused medical aid could be a refusal on the patient's part.

01:39:21.251 --> 01:39:24.333
Were there refusals on the EMT's part?

01:39:24.553 --> 01:39:28.196
There is some qualitative evidence to suggest that.

01:39:28.576 --> 01:39:31.218
And when you look at the orders that EMT's were

01:39:34.315 --> 01:39:47.279
Well, I can tell you this, 20,000 or so of these refusals of medical aid dispatches were calls that were coded one or two in severity level.

01:39:47.839 --> 01:39:48.899
That's the highest level.

01:39:49.759 --> 01:39:59.362
We need some investigation of this because I'm not really sure why anybody who was determined to be level one or two in severity

01:40:00.146 --> 01:40:03.187
is not being brought to the hospital.

01:40:03.267 --> 01:40:04.888
That's really disturbing to me.

01:40:04.948 --> 01:40:07.489
So again, I'm not saying that there's not worried well here.

01:40:08.409 --> 01:40:12.051
There's- This really feels odd to me now.

01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:17.453
When I was listening to the presentation, it felt odd, like, you know, get on with it already.

01:40:17.513 --> 01:40:19.693
Like all these details don't really matter.

01:40:19.733 --> 01:40:20.874
Where's your main point?

01:40:21.514 --> 01:40:30.312
I thought we were supposed to give an elevator pitch and now we're on refusal of aid dispatches and we're not really explaining what it means or why it's significant.

01:40:34.485 --> 01:40:39.248
I mean, I can tell you when I was listening to this live, I was already like, dude, are you kidding me?

01:40:39.929 --> 01:40:45.212
Like, we're already, according to my timer, we're 20, you know, we're really far in.

01:40:45.712 --> 01:40:48.354
She cut out all the questions, we're 21 minutes in.

01:40:48.814 --> 01:40:53.538
So if those questions were another five minutes, we're 25 minutes into the hour we're already gonna get.

01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.361
And it's not done yet.

01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:08.771
Plenty of data to suggest there's a portion of that as, as we would expect, but looking at the orders that EMTs were given.

01:41:09.793 --> 01:41:20.821
under the auspices of we have to control spread and hospitals are overwhelmed, which they were not by the way, it paints a really unsettling picture.

01:41:21.021 --> 01:41:24.604
Again, I'm not saying I have all the answers, but it needs to be investigated.

01:41:25.084 --> 01:41:28.366
And I think, let me skip that for one second, it's pretty much the same as this.

01:41:28.686 --> 01:41:39.154
What's most disturbing about this is that we have, from what I can tell, is the biggest cardiac arrest event in homes

01:41:39.710 --> 01:41:46.236
that is documented anywhere, doesn't, again, nothing's going on in cardiac arrest.

01:41:46.256 --> 01:41:50.099
This is patients that were pronounced dead at the point of pickup.

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:56.484
So they didn't go anywhere except, you know, to a morgue, to a funeral home.

01:41:56.825 --> 01:42:03.330
But nothing's going on, 15 days to slow the spread, and then we have a massive cardiac arrest event.

01:42:03.871 --> 01:42:06.333
Now, if media is triggering

01:42:06.837 --> 01:42:16.083
cardiac arrest in thousands of New Yorkers, we better investigate that and somebody better study it, because that's a heck of a correlation.

01:42:18.305 --> 01:42:26.110
Yes, so we've looked at Italy, we've looked at London, we've looked at Paris, we've looked at Detroit, and there might be some other place.

01:42:28.717 --> 01:42:32.561
The scale is not the same, that New York is above all of those.

01:42:32.762 --> 01:42:39.369
And so Denny Rancor is also somebody who should have been able to collaborate with these guys to show that New York was an anomaly.

01:42:39.989 --> 01:42:46.637
But Denny Rancor doesn't seem very interested in talking about New York as an anomaly, which is also just, you know, it's a data point.

01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:47.337
places.

01:42:47.458 --> 01:42:53.284
Italy comes somewhat close, but New York, as far as we can tell, is an outlier.

01:42:54.025 --> 01:42:56.848
When she says we, she means her and Jonathan Engler.

01:42:56.868 --> 01:42:59.631
Even if it weren't, this still warrants explanation.

01:43:00.051 --> 01:43:01.353
What the heck happened here?

01:43:01.473 --> 01:43:06.699
Again, if media can trigger this, that needs to be studied.

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:09.523
Media didn't trigger this, okay?

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:23.314
Whatever this is was used as a justification for models in the UK, for lockdowns in America where they could be implemented, and for the debate on TV about whether people were taking this seriously or not.

01:43:24.130 --> 01:43:34.306
And I'm not really sure she's actually said that yet, which is interesting because she's asking for an investigation, but not really suggesting what this, the implications are.

01:43:34.406 --> 01:43:39.294
If they lied about deaths or they murdered people, then the pandemic was faked.

01:43:41.584 --> 01:43:49.232
And that kinda is like a real succinct way of saying it, which after 20 minutes of presentation, she hasn't managed to do yet.

01:43:49.813 --> 01:43:50.273
Big time.

01:43:50.874 --> 01:43:52.055
So that's just one.

01:43:52.315 --> 01:43:58.562
I mean, right now it's being blamed on COVID, COVID-19 and healthcare avoidance and stress.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:02.406
But again, people were calling, help was coming.

01:44:02.947 --> 01:44:05.067
Help was not transporting a lot of people.

01:44:05.548 --> 01:44:10.609
So we have some conflicting, and this graph captures all of what I just.

01:44:11.049 --> 01:44:19.090
Okay, make sure that when you say don't let the enemy be perfect, be the enemy of good, make sure you understand what I am evaluating here.

01:44:21.151 --> 01:44:31.313
We had a chance to speak to Senator Ron Johnson's staff, and it's supposed to be because she got their attention on Twitter.

01:44:32.685 --> 01:44:37.587
And now she has chosen me to present with her and some guy that I've never met.

01:44:39.288 --> 01:44:44.211
And it seems as though her message and her friend's message are more important than mine.

01:44:45.591 --> 01:44:46.352
Which is fine.

01:44:47.461 --> 01:45:00.787
Except, remember, in the context of me having gotten a phone call from Senator Ron Johnson two and a half years ago, it's strange that in two and a half years, Senator Ron Johnson's never bothered to have a Zoom meeting with me.

01:45:01.387 --> 01:45:08.610
But now, within a matter of a few days of a Twitter spat, she's able to get two staffers to listen to us.

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:12.751
I mean, Robert Malone told him to sit down and listen to me.

01:45:12.811 --> 01:45:16.353
That's a little different than catching his attention on Twitter.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:26.004
And there are also things that we haven't told you yet about Jessica and how she's communicated with us.

01:45:26.084 --> 01:45:30.407
And so there are more reasons to believe that she might be a traitor.

01:45:32.769 --> 01:45:43.137
Look at the sub stack of Mark Housatonic and see the message that she sent last week and try to explain it.

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:48.801
Try to remember in my stream if I've ever mentioned any of her family members.

01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:56.872
try to remember in my streams if I've ever talked about her at length at all, except for when she's been in the chat.

01:46:00.114 --> 01:46:11.344
And she is the one who hooked me up with the heart group guy, Jonathan Engler, and urged me to write something with him about virology because that was the way to get it out.

01:46:15.538 --> 01:46:27.360
but my message isn't nearly as important as hers and all of the little details that she has about her message has not been summarized yet in 20 plus minutes of this talk.

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.841
23 minutes with the questions added out.

01:46:29.941 --> 01:46:34.942
So we're at a half an hour here where she told me we were all gonna give 10 minute elevator pitches.

01:46:36.102 --> 01:46:42.483
Said, two different scales here, so be aware of that, but massive home death event

01:46:43.405 --> 01:46:53.432
not really a reasonable explanation and data that's incongruent with what we might expect, in my opinion.

01:46:53.712 --> 01:46:55.894
Just a quick comparison.

01:46:55.954 --> 01:47:01.117
Ebola, those outbreaks are very, geographically, they're very contained too.

01:47:01.938 --> 01:47:06.681
Yes, but I don't have it in this presentation, but I have compared New York.

01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:11.324
Did Ebola just get a nod of, yeah, Ebola checks out.

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:22.836
Did she just say that Ebola checks out like she I think she did, which is a pretty interesting thing for someone from Chicago Public Schools to say, I two different scales here.

01:47:22.896 --> 01:47:24.297
So be aware of that.

01:47:24.577 --> 01:47:31.825
But massive home death event, not really a reasonable explanation and data that's

01:47:32.890 --> 01:47:37.952
incongruent with what we might expect in my opinion.

01:47:38.213 --> 01:47:39.633
Just a quick comparison.

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:45.636
Ebola, those outbreaks are very geographically, they're very contained too.

01:47:46.437 --> 01:47:52.680
Yes, but I don't have it in this presentation, but I have compared New York City spring 2020 to New York City 1918.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.200
New York City 2020 is about double.

01:47:59.218 --> 01:48:02.180
So I have questions about that.

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.322
I mean, there's also the possibility.

01:48:04.382 --> 01:48:05.223
But yeah, we do that.

01:48:05.283 --> 01:48:09.205
There's also the possibility that these foreign meddlers have meddled with Jessica.

01:48:10.667 --> 01:48:17.291
Jessica was the one who was absolutely convinced that Jonathan Engler is just the sweetest guy and she trusted him.

01:48:18.132 --> 01:48:20.514
And so it's possible that she was meddled with.

01:48:22.022 --> 01:48:35.353
and that bringing us together was supposed to be some kind of controlled little orchestrated thing where these two Americans would be effectively neutralized through their association with these meddlers from outside of the United States.

01:48:36.755 --> 01:48:48.465
But given what you see on Mark's substack and given what you might see on my substack in a couple of days, I'm gonna suggest to you that you might wanna reorient your interpretation of events.

01:48:49.315 --> 01:49:07.111
because it feels very much like she, like Matt Crawford tried to do to us a year and a half ago, tried to separate Mark and I by lying about me and making Mark make the choice between her and me.

01:49:07.552 --> 01:49:15.399
And at the same time, interestingly enough, it would be crazy, right, if she tried to make me make the choice between Mark and her.

01:49:16.561 --> 01:49:21.344
It'd be crazy if I had an email where she tried to do that on the exact same day that she did it to Mark.

01:49:21.384 --> 01:49:22.364
Wouldn't that be nuts?

01:49:23.225 --> 01:49:30.309
Would that make you reconsider my interpretation of this meeting a little bit and make you reconsider why she might be off of Twitter for a month?

01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:34.052
Because that's where we are.

01:49:39.795 --> 01:49:44.498
I feel like we're in that rounders scene where it's finally revealed that

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.442
Check, check, check, check, check.

01:49:49.103 --> 01:49:50.084
He trapped me.

01:49:52.166 --> 01:49:53.968
Pay that man his money.

01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:57.812
He beat me straight up.

01:50:00.394 --> 01:50:03.778
That's what happens when you lie and you bluff and then you get caught.

01:50:07.261 --> 01:50:08.082
You lose the pot.

01:50:09.991 --> 01:50:23.655
And so it doesn't matter how many more cards we wait for or how many more weeks we wait to show you all of the DMs and all of the communications that these people have had with me in order to demonstrate that I'm not crazy.

01:50:25.736 --> 01:50:27.496
We have all those communications.

01:50:27.676 --> 01:50:30.657
I have not been an idiot for a very long time.

01:50:31.377 --> 01:50:36.799
And in fact, I've saved every chat that I've ever had with anyone because I know most people are liars.

01:50:38.373 --> 01:50:47.840
The only ones I don't have are from early 2020, and I do regret that because the book would be just a little bit better, the one that I'm going to write, if all of those chats were available.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.042
But boy, 2021 onward is rich.

01:50:52.924 --> 01:51:00.269
And there are even whole chapters with whole characters that I haven't even bothered to expose yet, because what's the point?

01:51:02.503 --> 01:51:05.204
They know they're exposed, that's why they stopped contacting me.

01:51:05.724 --> 01:51:11.686
They know they're exposed, that's why because they stopped mentioning me, because they know they can't do anything anymore.

01:51:12.446 --> 01:51:18.128
They revealed themselves in private messages that contradict, in behaviors that contradict.

01:51:19.268 --> 01:51:24.950
And when they go for trying to wreck a friendship that's based on trust,

01:51:28.379 --> 01:51:33.664
and they underestimate the power of that friendship, oftentimes, you know, they run into a problem.

01:51:35.825 --> 01:51:48.716
And that's why Matt Crawford failed, and why Matt Crawford a year later finds himself in a Bitcoin chat of his own making on Signal, where him and Doc Malek

01:51:49.628 --> 01:51:58.741
the meddler from the UK are constantly talking about how JJ is really dividing and lost his mind and is going psychotic.

01:51:59.802 --> 01:52:03.227
The same Bitcoin chat that I was supposed to stay in, please come back.

01:52:06.533 --> 01:52:26.876
And so just like other teams of meddlers have lied to me about their relationships with each other, another team of meddlers worked me for about nine months in the backwoods of Twitter on direct messaging, pretending to be a bunch of good guys from Panda, and it turns out that they're traitors, most likely.

01:52:27.875 --> 01:52:37.884
It's also possible that Jessica is a good American that has been cooperating with these meddlers and doesn't yet realize that who she should be cooperating with is me and Mark.

01:52:37.964 --> 01:52:44.029
Because we spent a lot of time pushing this message and leveraging it to leverage our own message.

01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:47.633
Because that's what a good, truthful message does.

01:52:48.053 --> 01:52:52.297
It synergistically works with the rest of the truth that we already have.

01:52:54.383 --> 01:52:57.427
And so we don't have to focus exclusively on New York.

01:52:57.827 --> 01:53:02.593
We can say that Jessica has a lot of data that suggests New York was fake.

01:53:02.933 --> 01:53:10.022
We have a lot of data that suggests they murdered people with oxygen and ventilators and remdesivir and midazolam from all over the world.

01:53:11.892 --> 01:53:14.854
And so if they did that in New York, Jessica might have a neat story.

01:53:14.894 --> 01:53:20.077
But if we integrate across the whole story, we also have to talk about virology and the history of it.

01:53:20.097 --> 01:53:22.179
We also have to talk about PCR testing.

01:53:22.539 --> 01:53:24.580
We also have to talk about the sequencing lies.

01:53:25.001 --> 01:53:26.802
We have to talk about all of these things.

01:53:28.464 --> 01:53:57.943
And yet, curiously enough, just like a lot of these people, she's focused on one thing and one thing only, even when Pierre Kory's testimony for the George Floyd thing and Pierre Kory's testimony about what happened in New York and at the Senate could easily be used as a bookend hearing to say, by the way, the authority on what happened in New York City is none other than somebody who's gotta be a liar because he was also an expert witness in a Minnesota case about a guy who was killed by a cop.

01:54:00.782 --> 01:54:03.485
and the best timeline about Pierre Cory is hers.

01:54:04.066 --> 01:54:11.635
Because of course, she is the authority on New York and on her timeline, there's nothing about Pierre Cory being the expert witness in the Floyd trial.

01:54:12.016 --> 01:54:18.623
And in fact, if you look very closely at the substack of Mark, you will see that it looks like Jessica made a mistake.

01:54:19.685 --> 01:54:30.989
and thought that Mark was accusing her of something when Mark was just saying, holy shit, I didn't know that George Floyd's case had an expert witness named Pierre Corey.

01:54:31.029 --> 01:54:32.130
You must have known that.

01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:33.250
That's crazy.

01:54:34.571 --> 01:54:37.832
And she took that as an accusation and then panicked.

01:54:38.666 --> 01:54:40.567
and then lied to Mark about me.

01:54:41.548 --> 01:54:54.337
And then at the same time sent an email to lie to me about what she said to Mark in hopes that we would both choose to be her friend or one of us would choose to be her friend instead of Mark or Jay's friend.

01:54:55.037 --> 01:55:02.002
Which is interesting because Mark and I have a little longer history than one year of friendship now.

01:55:04.039 --> 01:55:08.641
We have more than one piece of evidence as to why we trust each other.

01:55:09.762 --> 01:55:18.727
We have a long pattern of integrity with each other behind the scenes and in public.

01:55:20.288 --> 01:55:22.329
We've shared rental cars in hotel rooms.

01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:32.334
I mean, it's just laughable to me that at this stage somebody thought that they could play me like this.

01:55:36.414 --> 01:55:38.796
And so who else has been played here?

01:55:38.916 --> 01:55:39.436
Is it her?

01:55:39.456 --> 01:55:41.658
Or is she playing us?

01:55:42.538 --> 01:55:55.508
The most likely explanation, given what Mark put on his substack and given what I will put on my substack later this week, it's very hard for me to conceive a situation where she is bamboozled.

01:55:57.611 --> 01:56:17.411
And if she is, then she better be pulling herself out of this nosedive pretty quick once she realizes the depth and the breadth of the deception of these foreign meddlers that tried to absorb the actual truth of virology that I'm trying to teach, which is that virology is just based on transfection and transformation of cell cultures and animals.

01:56:18.254 --> 01:56:19.894
using synthetic DNA and RNA.

01:56:20.275 --> 01:56:21.155
It's really simple.

01:56:21.755 --> 01:56:27.636
And the no virus people could have said this four years ago, but they also didn't because they're also part of the same group of meddlers.

01:56:29.677 --> 01:56:34.198
They don't all have to know they're on the same team to be on the same team paid by the same rich people.

01:56:34.858 --> 01:56:43.340
They don't all have to know that they're on the same team if they're elevated by the same fake mechanisms that they say as, I don't know, it's the algorithms.

01:56:44.369 --> 01:56:47.130
a lot, especially Dr. Engler and I look at like past events.

01:56:48.170 --> 01:56:54.112
Denny Rancor, I know has looked a lot at that comparing mortality events over time.

01:56:55.073 --> 01:57:02.975
If we look at just another quick comparison, another quick point about the home deaths, this is from CDC Wonder Federal Database.

01:57:02.995 --> 01:57:05.036
This is Cook County, which is Chicago.

01:57:05.856 --> 01:57:11.518
There, any kind of heart related death at home during this period versus New York City?

01:57:13.199 --> 01:57:15.440
It's not even close.

01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:22.683
So an explanation I think is warranted about what could have occurred.

01:57:22.703 --> 01:57:27.366
So how long is she gonna talk and not say they murdered people and lied about it?

01:57:27.466 --> 01:57:36.730
Or they manufactured death rate and lied about it to cause the whole pandemic thing to happen.

01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:37.930
When is she gonna say that?

01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:41.592
Heard in New York or what factors are involved because

01:57:42.683 --> 01:57:46.547
Are we going to have to wait for New York State to decide to investigate this?

01:57:46.587 --> 01:57:48.168
Do you see what the problem is here?

01:57:48.348 --> 01:57:51.531
Coronavirus can't possibly be the reason.

01:57:51.871 --> 01:57:59.798
So if it's media messaging, if it's what was going on with EMTs and first responders, that needs to be uncovered.

01:58:00.459 --> 01:58:02.821
Also during this time, really alarming,

01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:10.032
is that the medical examiner seems to have abandoned their duties.

01:58:10.292 --> 01:58:22.696
Now, I know what the party line explanations of this are, oh, we're overwhelmed, there was so much going on, but Chicago didn't see this kind of drop, but there was a drop in home deaths that received offers.

01:58:22.876 --> 01:58:30.439
I do think it's silly for Mike Eden to be saying that they designed this to reduce fertility.

01:58:31.468 --> 01:58:42.032
I think that's a silly thing to say because again, it's committing to a specific explanation where we don't have to commit to a specific explanation.

01:58:42.072 --> 01:58:48.815
A subset of the mRNA shots could have been designed to reduce fertility and another subset were placebos.

01:58:49.813 --> 01:59:07.337
Like the idea that Mike Yeadon is now being promoted as a guy who says that it's designed to kill us or designed to harm us is already too simple of an explanation because even if some of them were designed to kill us, others of them were placebo to make sure that we wouldn't figure it out.

01:59:10.034 --> 01:59:12.736
So we need to get Wolfgang Wodach on the show again.

01:59:12.776 --> 01:59:29.530
We need to get Mike Eden on the show again to talk to them about these incongruencies and these weaknesses in their current rhetoric, because they are playing right back into the hands of the slavers if they are now gonna tell us these stories that they don't need to tell us.

01:59:31.431 --> 01:59:32.052
Autopsies.

01:59:33.086 --> 01:59:34.287
Now, they shouldn't drop.

01:59:34.307 --> 01:59:37.891
I would at least expect it to stay the same, if not increase.

01:59:37.911 --> 01:59:45.218
So massive home death event, the biggest in New York City history, but we don't have people being autopsied.

01:59:45.458 --> 01:59:49.422
I think that's a pretty big red flag and it warrants explanation.

01:59:50.506 --> 01:59:52.327
couple more points about hospitals.

01:59:52.347 --> 01:59:55.609
I mean, and I'm glad you said this, like, I think that's probably right.

01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:58.470
Mike Eden can't say certain things without going to prison.

01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:59.411
That's probably right.

01:59:59.451 --> 02:00:02.252
I think Janet usually has a pretty good insight on these things.

02:00:02.352 --> 02:00:05.694
And I respect her opinion in the chat.

02:00:06.345 --> 02:00:08.146
The media was covering New York.

02:00:08.606 --> 02:00:09.887
They absolutely were.

02:00:10.287 --> 02:00:15.730
And I live in Chicagoland, and I remember like, we have to do something because New York is on fire.

02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:19.293
That's basically the message that was being conveyed.

02:00:19.333 --> 02:00:23.655
We were told about an apocalyptic surge at Elmhurst Hospital.

02:00:23.715 --> 02:00:29.939
President Trump was on the White House lawn talking about how there's refrigerator trucks there, et cetera, et cetera.

02:00:30.879 --> 02:00:35.522
What's funny is, I mean, it's actually not funny, but I obtained Elmhurst's data,

02:00:36.892 --> 02:00:54.579
In that period, there was a slight rise in emergency department visits, but it was before really the emergency period began, and then huge drop for the rest of the year.

02:00:55.509 --> 02:00:56.490
for the rest of the year.

02:00:56.670 --> 02:00:58.491
Go ahead.

02:00:58.771 --> 02:01:04.574
So I have asked New York City and New York State for daily hospital admissions.

02:01:04.874 --> 02:01:06.795
They both actually asked New York City first.

02:01:06.835 --> 02:01:08.196
They said, no, ask the state.

02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:10.497
The state says, no, we don't have that.

02:01:11.238 --> 02:01:17.061
So your intuition is correct that we need daily hospital admissions.

02:01:17.657 --> 02:01:26.059
If for no other reason, because we need to know how many hospital inpatients who died during this event were admitted before the event began.

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:27.820
Like that's really important.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.741
What if a huge proportion of hospital inpatients who died were admitted in January?

02:01:33.582 --> 02:01:35.762
I think that's a big deal, right?

02:01:35.822 --> 02:01:41.284
Because these numbers are being used to show that there was a virus suddenly attacked the city.

02:01:42.222 --> 02:01:54.391
Now, some of these calls, I mean, you might be thinking this too, or some of this decline, I think with emergency department visits, maybe due to increases in telehealth and calls being directed to telehealth.

02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:55.973
Now, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

02:01:56.013 --> 02:02:07.641
I guess we could debate that, but Elmhurst was called the epicenter of the epicenter hospital and their emergency departments do not show that they're overwhelmed.

02:02:08.022 --> 02:02:10.764
The other day, I've been waiting on other data for a year

02:02:11.754 --> 02:02:15.510
on nursing home resident transfers into hospitals.

02:02:22.731 --> 02:02:35.481
I mean, again, like I told you earlier, we don't even have in the United States numbers on the number of nursing home residents who die every day or every month, every year, regardless of place of death.

02:02:35.621 --> 02:02:39.064
And I think there's some shell games going on there.

02:02:39.164 --> 02:02:48.412
And I think, I know in Chicago, because I have that data, that more COVID nursing home deaths died in the hospital than in the nursing home.

02:02:48.732 --> 02:02:57.976
So I think that's really good to know because nursing homes to a certain extent I think have been scapegoated or they've gotten a lot of attention.

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:08.041
So I agree with you, but I've had trouble getting just basic data from city and federal agencies as well.

02:03:08.682 --> 02:03:17.946
Something about the emergency departments though, remember that we were told and media was trying to tell us that emergency departments were overwhelmed.

02:03:18.730 --> 02:03:21.731
So if nothing else, this is like, no, it wasn't.

02:03:21.971 --> 02:03:28.452
This was the apocalyptic hospital and their data shows the opposite of what the media was saying.

02:03:29.072 --> 02:03:32.833
And if I, I mean, I have this, I got this data going all the way back to 2007.

02:03:34.013 --> 02:03:43.234
I mean, Elmhurst Hospital has experienced busier emergency department visit days and weeks than spring 2020.

02:03:43.275 --> 02:03:43.675
I mean, look at-

02:03:48.683 --> 02:03:54.468
Well, specific to Elmhurst, first of all, well, I'll get to that in a second.

02:03:54.488 --> 02:03:57.391
We've got some missing data, first of all.

02:03:57.951 --> 02:04:07.240
Elmhurst, I was able last year to get from New York City H&H, which is the agency that runs the 11 public hospitals in New York City.

02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:14.927
I was able to get historical data for Elmhurst Hospital, ICU, and non-ICU.

02:04:16.272 --> 02:04:24.547
Again, we do not see a hospital that was experiencing the highest patient occupancy it ever experienced.

02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:36.713
What's really troubling about that, again, okay, this is actually just a news story, little clip, just a reminder, Elmhurst, 13 deaths in a day, apocalyptic surge at NYC Hospital, right?

02:04:36.733 --> 02:04:38.293
This is why your kid in East St.

02:04:38.333 --> 02:04:39.854
Louis, Illinois has to stay.

02:04:40.014 --> 02:04:41.414
I'm gonna be really honest with you.

02:04:41.454 --> 02:04:45.815
At this stage in the presentation, I was going bananas.

02:04:47.035 --> 02:04:50.216
I was screaming like, what is going on here?

02:04:50.836 --> 02:04:52.056
What are we doing?

02:04:52.176 --> 02:04:54.037
Why am I not speaking yet?

02:04:56.195 --> 02:04:58.857
I was going bananas and I couldn't understand it.

02:04:58.937 --> 02:05:02.240
I didn't understand what we were doing here and why we were still talking.

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.402
We are, in this video, 30 minutes in.

02:05:05.982 --> 02:05:12.847
That would mean we are much farther into the hour than 30 minutes because she's been fast forwarding through the questions.

02:05:13.248 --> 02:05:19.973
We could be 40 minutes into the hour already where she told me we were each gonna do an elevator pitch.

02:05:22.148 --> 02:05:24.829
Does it seem like she was gonna do an elevator pitch here?

02:05:24.849 --> 02:05:26.389
We're still throwing slides.

02:05:28.150 --> 02:05:30.310
I lost my mind in the background.

02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:36.632
And that's probably why you'll see when I come on screen, I don't have a very good presentation.

02:05:36.652 --> 02:05:43.354
I don't have a very good energy because I'm already convinced that something very, very, very screwy is going on here.

02:05:43.955 --> 02:05:45.795
Cause this is not an elevator pitch.

02:05:46.475 --> 02:05:48.076
Oh, it's just, it's just ridiculous.

02:05:48.956 --> 02:05:50.217
But, you know, we do.

02:05:51.778 --> 02:05:57.421
It was reiterated by the president on the White House lawn and reiterated by Ron Johnson.

02:05:57.661 --> 02:05:59.141
What happened in New York City?

02:05:59.221 --> 02:06:00.662
He said on May 6, 2020.

02:06:01.082 --> 02:06:02.243
I mean, I think.

02:06:04.864 --> 02:06:15.010
I think we would like to be able to finish the content that we've prepared to present so that you understand the bigger picture of what we're but I but I'm OK with you interjecting because

02:06:16.285 --> 02:06:21.809
A lot of this is disturbing because it's counter narrative and it's counter what we were told.

02:06:22.650 --> 02:06:26.553
Elmhurst Hospital does report a ton of death.

02:06:26.633 --> 02:06:35.079
In fact, they report losing more than every occupied bed in a very short timeframe.

02:06:36.079 --> 02:06:36.920
Hold on one second.

02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:41.183
What's troubling about this is that I asked for this is all cause death.

02:06:41.969 --> 02:06:45.411
I asked for the deaths from New York City Health and Hospital.

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:47.992
I asked for the daily deaths back to 2017.

02:06:48.712 --> 02:06:55.776
They said, we can only give you 2020 because 2017 to 2019 is in another system.

02:06:55.896 --> 02:06:59.138
I'm sorry, but if you're going to use graphs, you need to explain them.

02:06:59.158 --> 02:07:09.403
You can't put a graph up on the screen that no one's seen before and not explain to them what's on the y-axis, not explain to them what's on the x-axis, and why you're showing it.

02:07:10.143 --> 02:07:10.704
You can't.

02:07:11.124 --> 02:07:12.345
That's not how this works.

02:07:12.745 --> 02:07:27.158
It's just as stupid as Andy Kaufman's presentation at the Red Pill Conference where it was just slide after slide of the top half of a publication with some portion of the text of the abstract highlighted.

02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:34.165
You are just asking people to try and read a slide and figure out why you put it up there.

02:07:35.407 --> 02:07:43.231
Just like right now, you're asking her to look at this graph and interpret it while you're listening to the shit that you're saying that has nothing to do with the graph.

02:07:43.291 --> 02:07:45.192
It's just indirectly related.

02:07:45.292 --> 02:07:50.875
I'm showing you another Elmhurst Hospital graph, but I'm not gonna tell you specifically why I chose this one.

02:07:51.396 --> 02:07:52.256
And we can't get it.

02:07:52.916 --> 02:07:54.037
Basically is what they said.

02:07:54.257 --> 02:08:03.222
That's disturbing because I have a feeling that perhaps, or I have a theory, that some of these deaths may have been pulled from the past.

02:08:04.491 --> 02:08:09.772
and put in- And so at 30 minutes in, she's saying that some of them might've been pulled from the past.

02:08:10.293 --> 02:08:23.156
Is it just me, or you could summarize this in 10 minutes with bullet points and say, I've got data for every one of these things, and I've looked at this, this, and this, and I think we have a big problem that we have to investigate, or did we need to do 40 minutes like this?

02:08:23.715 --> 02:08:25.576
and put into this spike.

02:08:25.656 --> 02:08:30.017
So when agencies are hiding data, it's not a good sign.

02:08:30.397 --> 02:08:36.459
It's a really, really bad sign, especially when an event of this scale is purported to have occurred.

02:08:36.759 --> 02:08:38.480
Notice, again, we don't really see anything

02:08:39.632 --> 02:08:45.176
abnormal going on at Elmhurst until 15 days to slow the spread is called.

02:08:45.656 --> 02:08:53.821
So the portrait of this event, all of these data points at once, I know it's a lot to take in, but this is like, what the heck happened there?

02:08:54.002 --> 02:08:56.523
Did they kill a bunch of people who were already in the hospital?

02:08:57.044 --> 02:09:05.289
Because if so, Americans deserve to know that because this hospital was held up as a spectacle of doom and what could happen to everybody.

02:09:05.569 --> 02:09:10.156
So how many people do you think watched this video on Twitter all the way to the end to catch my part?

02:09:16.041 --> 02:09:17.901
and the data doesn't add up.

02:09:18.241 --> 02:09:19.222
It doesn't make sense.

02:09:19.682 --> 02:09:23.923
Even if you look at the city overall, this is just emergency department visits.

02:09:23.963 --> 02:09:33.125
And I know we said there could be reasons why that plummeted and there could have been other transfers, but pandemic- I can't believe I didn't see that before.

02:09:34.125 --> 02:09:37.626
Why aren't HIPAA laws even in the discussion here?

02:09:37.666 --> 02:09:38.426
That's very,

02:09:39.386 --> 02:09:40.866
astute of you, Janet.

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:41.707
Thank you very much.

02:09:42.127 --> 02:09:46.628
...of the century, and we have nobody in the emergency department.

02:09:47.108 --> 02:09:52.869
Ambulances aren't transporting people to the hospital, but unprecedented levels of death.

02:09:53.689 --> 02:10:03.371
New York City's system reports losing the near equivalent of every occupied bed in the city, about 20,000 people in a matter of weeks.

02:10:04.771 --> 02:10:07.172
And there's just no proof that this occurred.

02:10:07.725 --> 02:10:09.766
And we've got some incomplete data sets.

02:10:09.866 --> 02:10:15.608
This is just one example of the New York City Hospital bed availability and occupancy census.

02:10:16.468 --> 02:10:18.829
The state told me they don't have the rest of the data.

02:10:18.869 --> 02:10:21.290
Now this data set starts March 26th.

02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:25.192
Well, that's funny because that's the day after the CARES Act is passed.

02:10:25.912 --> 02:10:27.473
So where's the rest of the data?

02:10:28.313 --> 02:10:29.153
We have no baseline.

02:10:29.173 --> 02:10:30.554
That's really disturbing.

02:10:31.877 --> 02:10:33.919
You know, finally, before I pass it on.

02:10:33.999 --> 02:10:45.687
And so someone in the chat is clearing up the idea or suggesting that HIPAA laws had to be waived in order for this data to be reported and hospitals had to be given the green light in order to report this data.

02:10:46.168 --> 02:10:57.796
So she may be over-representing the significance of the lack of data here simply because before those dates, it may have been illegal for them to report it and still protect it under the HIPAA laws.

02:10:57.836 --> 02:10:58.797
So that's interesting.

02:10:58.857 --> 02:11:00.899
It's not something that I saw at the time

02:11:01.579 --> 02:11:03.600
So again, kudos to Janet.

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:05.900
It's been a long time since you've been in the chat there, lady.

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.221
Over to Dr. Kademi.

02:11:07.801 --> 02:11:15.743
One of the most disturbing data points about New York City hospitals is the scale of younger adult hospital inpatient deaths.

02:11:16.884 --> 02:11:20.005
And almost all of them are blamed on COVID-19.

02:11:21.105 --> 02:11:24.846
Now, COVID-19 does not kill younger adults.

02:11:25.766 --> 02:11:27.407
And Chicago doesn't look like this.

02:11:28.399 --> 02:11:37.353
So what I would say to any US Senator, including Senator Johnson, is we need some investigation into what happened in these hospitals, if only on the basis of this data alone.

02:11:38.735 --> 02:11:44.163
It's inexcusable that we don't have answers about what the heck happened here and why.

02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:46.901
I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Kademi.

02:11:47.101 --> 02:11:48.141
Go ahead, John.

02:11:48.221 --> 02:11:51.363
OK, so 34 minutes minus the questions.

02:11:51.443 --> 02:11:54.584
So she definitely presented for at least 40 minutes.

02:11:55.224 --> 02:12:01.067
And it was supposed to be a 15-minute elevator pitch for each of us that would have gotten us to 45 minutes.

02:12:01.547 --> 02:12:03.588
And then there would have been 15 minutes of questions.

02:12:03.648 --> 02:12:09.070
So I don't know exactly what she planned there, but that was definitely not a elevator pitch.

02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:12.452
And in the end, she didn't even have summary slides.

02:12:16.127 --> 02:12:24.768
And so a person who's supposed to be a professional educator of educators, she's actually called herself a teacher of teachers, which is what I was.

02:12:26.029 --> 02:12:45.272
When I graduated from college, I spent a couple years teaching science teachers in elementary schools of Chicago public schools on the South side of Chicago, in some of the poorest districts of CPS, teaching those or helping to teach those teachers to teach science better.

02:12:48.351 --> 02:12:50.131
I was actually a teacher of teachers.

02:12:50.171 --> 02:12:58.013
So it's very strange that one of the resume points that kind of got us connected was being a teacher of teachers.

02:12:58.414 --> 02:13:02.395
And in fact, again, I'm just gonna hand it over to Dr. Kademi.

02:13:02.435 --> 02:13:05.855
So this is the final slide from here to there.

02:13:07.676 --> 02:13:10.077
Amazingly succinct presentation.

02:13:13.817 --> 02:13:15.878
Hi, Colleen, thank you for your time.

02:13:17.515 --> 02:13:24.482
The overarching message is what happened in New York was not some sort of natural event like New York got hit harder.

02:13:25.483 --> 02:13:29.448
The hand of man is really, really clear in what happened in New York.

02:13:29.488 --> 02:13:33.773
It just doesn't fit any kind of... So wait, he's going to present about New York too?

02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:49.514
Would you have been surprised about that as well, seeing as we had three people that were supposed to each have a story, and now the second person that I haven't met yet until this meeting is going to present New York City too?

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:50.935
Really?

02:13:50.955 --> 02:13:55.159
It's a natural explanation, and it needs to be investigated.

02:13:55.719 --> 02:13:57.281
And we're getting stonewalled.

02:13:58.551 --> 02:14:05.317
This is a picture of excess mortality across 15 years now, and you can see exactly when it started.

02:14:06.178 --> 02:14:11.522
And if we look in the little, right where the red, the bright red and flex up, we can see that U.S.

02:14:12.223 --> 02:14:23.292
excess mortality in basically April of 2020 was about 100,000, which includes about half of that from New York City, which is about fourth and the tri-state area was about a half.

02:14:24.199 --> 02:14:34.631
And 100,000 excess deaths in a year is actually, it's at the edge, but it's within random variation of what we could expect in a flu season.

02:14:34.791 --> 02:14:41.279
Over this time period that's in here, we have had flu seasons that have had close to that number of excess.

02:14:41.299 --> 02:14:43.702
Go ahead and go to the next slide, Jessica, because you're driving.

02:14:45.464 --> 02:14:52.729
Okay, so this again, this just shows the same thing about half of those excess deaths were in New York and tri-state area.

02:14:52.929 --> 02:14:56.711
I wonder if you can possibly imagine what I was doing off camera right now.

02:14:58.072 --> 02:14:58.873
I don't think you can.

02:14:58.893 --> 02:15:04.677
I would be embarrassed to tell you what I was doing off camera right now.

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:06.098
Okay, head again.

02:15:07.509 --> 02:15:09.651
She's got my slide deck, okay?

02:15:09.871 --> 02:15:16.676
So again, New York City, tri-state area, you can see what the baseline looks like and what their excess desks look like.

02:15:16.936 --> 02:15:20.159
But I want to frame this in context of what this looked like in the rest of the country.

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:21.680
Click ahead one more again.

02:15:23.522 --> 02:15:24.482
Okay, so here we go.

02:15:25.163 --> 02:15:29.847
As this slide fills in, as it pictures in, we've got this light blue line.

02:15:30.993 --> 02:15:34.854
At least he's trying to explain it, but I can tell you, you can't read any of that text.

02:15:35.054 --> 02:15:38.936
I've got the screen right in front of me and I can't read really any of that text.

02:15:39.496 --> 02:15:42.737
It says, what does this chart show?

02:15:42.797 --> 02:15:50.480
This chart shows what the country would have looked like spring 2020 without the reported mass mortality event in New York state.

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.961
So he's really gonna focus on the New York thing.

02:15:54.909 --> 02:15:56.451
We've got this, I've got someone coming in.

02:15:56.712 --> 02:16:01.959
We've got this light blue line that shows the all cause mortality going across recent history.

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:07.567
And we see 2017 and 2018 with that flu peak.

02:16:08.168 --> 02:16:09.630
Guys, go in the back.

02:16:10.611 --> 02:16:10.792
Yeah.

02:16:11.721 --> 02:16:25.726
And then we see the arrows pointing to what the United States would have looked like, those two arrows, what the United States would have looked like had we not had 50,000 excess deaths in the tri-state area.

02:16:25.786 --> 02:16:32.429
And it would not have even risen to the level of, shall we say, the unremarkable 2017, 2018 season.

02:16:33.789 --> 02:16:38.691
So if you pull New York out, if you pull tri-state out of the United States and you put in

02:16:39.315 --> 02:16:41.557
we'll call them reasonable numbers for New York.

02:16:41.617 --> 02:16:45.479
What I did was I used 2018 and 2019.

02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:48.401
2018, 2019, nothing happened.

02:16:48.421 --> 02:16:51.343
There was nothing going on in the rest of the country.

02:16:51.364 --> 02:17:05.153
And of course, we see the subsequent mortality waves, that's all real data there, all reported data, are much, much larger than the original mortality wave if we pull out that New York event.

02:17:05.253 --> 02:17:06.034
Look ahead for me, Jess.

02:17:08.123 --> 02:17:21.136
The Z-scores really- So it's now started to strike me as something that I need to mention here is that we could be being led to believe that this excess mortality is exclusively the shot.

02:17:22.076 --> 02:17:23.157
but it's probably not.

02:17:23.337 --> 02:17:25.158
It's still iatrogenic death.

02:17:25.258 --> 02:17:27.600
It's still supplemental oxygen.

02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:29.521
It's still inappropriate ventilation.

02:17:29.561 --> 02:17:31.843
It's still inappropriate use of bremdesivir.

02:17:31.883 --> 02:17:33.885
It's still inappropriate use of midazolam.

02:17:33.925 --> 02:17:39.789
It's still inappropriate use of protocols that are meant to respond to a virus that probably doesn't exist.

02:17:40.289 --> 02:17:50.977
So in this scenario, we are still going to be led to one particular conclusion, I believe, which is the vax begins right there.

02:17:52.423 --> 02:17:57.007
And so we are about to be told that it is the vaccine that is giving us excess deaths.

02:17:57.087 --> 02:17:58.228
It's not the COVID.

02:17:59.709 --> 02:18:00.610
It's the vaccine.

02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:02.771
It's not the opioids.

02:18:03.392 --> 02:18:04.333
It's the vaccine.

02:18:04.873 --> 02:18:11.799
It's not suicides and all-cause mortality going up for a million different reasons.

02:18:12.079 --> 02:18:13.060
It's the vax.

02:18:17.663 --> 02:18:20.986
If we pull out that New York event, look ahead for me, Jess.

02:18:23.072 --> 02:18:28.633
The Z-scores really are what paint the picture of this not being a natural event.

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:32.274
Click ahead one more and I'll go over it, because I got another slide and I want to give JJ some time.

02:18:32.834 --> 02:18:36.335
So this is what the Z-scores of Tri-State and New York.

02:18:36.475 --> 02:18:39.436
He met me for the first time and he calls me JJ already.

02:18:41.476 --> 02:18:45.957
Why do all these people for the first freaking time they meet me already call me JJ?

02:18:49.304 --> 02:19:02.795
I asked people to stop calling me JJ when I was 14 years old, but every one of these people, from the first time they meet me, even when they're not sure who I am in the airport of O'Hare two days ago, ho, are you JJ?

02:19:05.817 --> 02:19:08.639
Now it's totally fine if you call me JJ in the chat.

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:10.701
It's totally fine, I don't care.

02:19:11.802 --> 02:19:15.525
I'm talking about these people that should have some respect.

02:19:17.093 --> 02:19:20.376
that I would have called him mister until I was told otherwise.

02:19:21.177 --> 02:19:22.938
I never said, yeah, you can call me JJ.

02:19:22.979 --> 02:19:30.285
And if I did, I did it because I already was annoyed you even asked me that was my name.

02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:40.315
Nobody's ever calling Jessica Rose, Rosie or Jessie.

02:19:43.467 --> 02:19:43.967
look like.

02:19:44.768 --> 02:19:54.315
And if we have the United States with the reported tri-state in New York, we have a Z-score of about seven, which is, it's just, it's impossible.

02:19:54.695 --> 02:19:55.796
So what's a Z-score?

02:19:57.417 --> 02:20:02.501
Do the Johnson staff, are they familiar with what a Z-score means and why it should be significant?

02:20:03.102 --> 02:20:07.125
You don't need to teach them the statistic that you're saying is significant here.

02:20:08.021 --> 02:20:09.762
to have that kind of excess mortality.

02:20:09.782 --> 02:20:15.203
But New York at 200 and Tri-State at 262, absolutely not.

02:20:15.283 --> 02:20:19.004
There's no way that this can be explained as a man-made event.

02:20:19.684 --> 02:20:25.686
And if we pull the Tri-State out, the United States Z-score is well within historical limits.

02:20:25.726 --> 02:20:28.147
The only thing that's off is the timing.

02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:41.956
So this is in my mind, this is probably one of the most compelling charts that I have to say that whatever went on in New York, whatever went on Tri-State, it was not some sort of spread of a novel deadly pathogen.

02:20:42.396 --> 02:20:47.599
The hand of man is absolutely involved in this in one way or another.

02:20:47.679 --> 02:20:58.925
Either those people were killed, they made up deaths, they pulled deaths, something about the hand of man happened in New York and happened in Tri-State that did not happen elsewhere.

02:20:59.315 --> 02:21:00.195
Click ahead for me again.

02:21:02.936 --> 02:21:05.356
Also, 15 days to slow the spread.

02:21:05.476 --> 02:21:14.559
So based on the mortality curves, we can back project what the cases would have looked like at an arbitrary infection fatality rate.

02:21:15.059 --> 02:21:16.799
So you can pick something like 0.2 or 0.4.

02:21:17.239 --> 02:21:19.220
It doesn't matter what that is.

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:24.081
But based on those mortality curves, we can back project when those patients

02:21:24.521 --> 02:21:32.725
would have had gotten, shall we say gotten COVID with about a 23, about a three week latency between getting COVID and dying of it.

02:21:32.745 --> 02:21:40.308
And of course, we see that to have created that mortality, we would have had about a half a million cases in early March.

02:21:40.868 --> 02:21:47.711
And by the time 15 days to slow the spread was announced in the middle of March, New York City would have had 1.65 million cases.

02:21:48.031 --> 02:21:48.651
Wait a minute.

02:21:48.711 --> 02:21:49.852
So this is a model.

02:21:50.839 --> 02:21:56.162
back projected cases using an ICFR of 2% and a latency of 21 days.

02:21:56.583 --> 02:21:57.843
It's a fricking model.

02:22:01.545 --> 02:22:06.348
And he's not even telling anybody what the parameters of the model are or what he's doing here at all.

02:22:06.528 --> 02:22:10.191
It's extraordinary what you see now in retrospect, is it not?

02:22:11.211 --> 02:22:13.753
And this was a big share last week for Jessica.

02:22:18.186 --> 02:22:18.666
alone.

02:22:19.226 --> 02:22:20.707
And by the time this, go ahead.

02:22:24.147 --> 02:22:24.788
No, you're doing great.

02:22:25.068 --> 02:22:28.989
So this is actually not a testing driven curve.

02:22:29.589 --> 02:22:31.509
This is a death driven curve.

02:22:31.949 --> 02:22:36.590
So to have created those deaths, I have those charts.

02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:38.931
They're not in that deck and I can send it to you.

02:22:39.071 --> 02:22:45.893
And in fact, actually is even earlier than that, which is coming up in a couple of slides here.

02:22:46.273 --> 02:22:46.853
Click ahead, Jess.

02:22:48.291 --> 02:22:48.731
This slide.

02:22:49.112 --> 02:22:57.599
Okay, so here we have, this is getting tinfoil hat, I get it, but what we have here- Can we clarify- Go ahead, JJ.

02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:01.022
Can we clarify what Colleen's saying before we move on?

02:23:01.062 --> 02:23:03.985
Because what you're suggesting, Colleen, is that the

02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:13.403
ability for whatever was circulating before the declaration to cause death didn't cause any deaths until the declaration.

02:23:13.463 --> 02:23:29.568
So your observation is actually huge edification for what we're talking about because you're holding a very big contradiction in your head if you assume that it's been circulating for longer but didn't start to kill anybody until somebody announced it.

02:23:29.608 --> 02:23:30.609
That's absurd.

02:23:31.209 --> 02:23:32.309
Exactly what you just said.

02:23:34.251 --> 02:23:38.081
Clarify again what you said then so I can point out how it is contradictory.

02:23:42.403 --> 02:23:52.510
I'm trying to help you understand that even though some cases are something that you assume, because we didn't have testing, so you have to assume it, because that's what they told you to assume.

02:23:52.530 --> 02:24:02.636
And that assumption is making you miss the fact that that assumption is contradictory, because if you assume that, then there should also be... I couldn't stand it anymore.

02:24:02.696 --> 02:24:09.421
I had to interrupt here, because she was asking crazy dumb questions about the fact that, wait, I understand that

02:24:09.961 --> 02:24:13.424
We think we have sequences from like September or October of 2019.

02:24:13.904 --> 02:24:19.830
And then this guy who was presenting wasn't gonna use it for a dunk.

02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:24.193
So I had to interrupt and say, no, no, no, you don't understand.

02:24:24.874 --> 02:24:31.239
You're holding a giant contradiction in your mind if you're talking to him and not realizing what you just said.

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:33.141
And he wasn't gonna point it out.

02:24:34.242 --> 02:24:35.283
That's what's happening here.

02:24:37.861 --> 02:24:52.512
this is this is getting tinfoil hat I get it but what we can we clarify what Colleen's saying before we move on because what you're suggesting Colleen is that the the the

02:24:53.644 --> 02:25:00.707
ability for whatever was circulating before the declaration to cause death didn't cause any deaths until the declaration.

02:25:00.767 --> 02:25:16.875
So your observation is actually huge edification for what we're talking about because you're holding a very big contradiction in your head if you assume that it's been circulating for longer but didn't start to kill anybody until somebody announced it.

02:25:16.915 --> 02:25:17.915
That's absurd.

02:25:18.516 --> 02:25:19.616
Exactly what you just said.

02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:25.432
Clarify again what you said then so I can point out how it is contradictory.

02:25:29.694 --> 02:25:38.978
I'm trying to help you understand that even though some cases are something that you assume, because we didn't have testing, so you have to assume it because that's what they told.

02:25:39.178 --> 02:25:43.680
So Jessica was referring to him as Dr. Kemeny all the time.

02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:48.542
Dr. Kemeny, Dr. Kemeny, Dr. Engler, JJ.

02:25:49.603 --> 02:25:50.343
That's what I hear.

02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:54.302
I didn't, I don't, that's what I hear.

02:25:54.462 --> 02:26:06.950
I hear lots of people giving respect, repeating names over and over again, saying Jonathan Engler's name, Dr. Jonathan Engler, three times, Dr. Kasemi a couple times, but JJ, it's fine.

02:26:07.010 --> 02:26:10.412
I'm not crying about it from an ego perspective.

02:26:10.452 --> 02:26:13.174
I'm showing you a pattern that has existed for four years.

02:26:13.615 --> 02:26:16.276
And it's not a pattern that is accidental.

02:26:16.336 --> 02:26:21.680
It's a pattern that's designed to be deprecating and designed to be condescending.

02:26:22.641 --> 02:26:34.591
And that's why when Andy Kaufman remembered my name in the airport three days ago, he defaulted to JJ, not Dr. Cooey or Mr. Cooey or Jonathan Cooey or Jonathan, you to assume.

02:26:35.031 --> 02:26:44.279
And that assumption is making you miss the fact that that assumption is contradictory, because if you assume that, then there should also be deaths and there weren't.

02:26:45.609 --> 02:26:47.470
Well, our deaths never stop.

02:26:47.850 --> 02:26:49.211
No.

02:26:49.391 --> 02:26:56.275
So why didn't, if it's a novel source of death, why didn't it show up until we announced it?

02:26:58.156 --> 02:26:58.856
What spike?

02:26:58.936 --> 02:26:59.757
The one in New York?

02:26:59.817 --> 02:27:01.058
Because that's the only one there is.

02:27:01.118 --> 02:27:01.798
That's the only spike.

02:27:01.818 --> 02:27:02.598
I don't want to interrupt.

02:27:02.658 --> 02:27:04.159
I'll stop, and I'll stop.

02:27:04.199 --> 02:27:05.060
Oh, it's OK.

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:05.400
It's OK.

02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:14.455
Well, I think all of us are on the same page that there was no spread of a novel deadly risk additive pathogen.

02:27:14.495 --> 02:27:16.937
It had been circulating for years, if not decades.

02:27:17.397 --> 02:27:19.299
And this chart suggests that.

02:27:19.779 --> 02:27:20.399
So we're here.

02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:25.183
Let me say it a different way for somebody like Graham HG, for example.

02:27:25.203 --> 02:27:28.365
I'm not saying that you calling me JJ is the problem.

02:27:28.385 --> 02:27:31.227
What I'm saying is, is that if I was meant to rise

02:27:33.499 --> 02:27:40.601
then these people would introduce me like they introduced Jessica Rose and list all four of her degrees.

02:27:41.322 --> 02:27:43.762
Or they would call me Dr. Cooey all the time.

02:27:44.042 --> 02:27:55.946
Or, as has so eloquently been said in the chat, they could have settled on Dr. J a long time ago and it would have been a really jazzy thing to call me for four years.

02:27:56.766 --> 02:27:58.267
Oh, we're getting Dr. J on again.

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:13.258
but they didn't, they settled on JJ, which from my perspective is a name that I've told many times on my stream and elsewhere that people called me JJ when I was a kid and I kind of asked them to stop, but you can call me that if you want to.

02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:16.061
That's all I'm saying.

02:28:34.073 --> 02:28:36.095
Wow, did you hear that?

02:28:36.215 --> 02:28:37.036
I missed that.

02:28:37.056 --> 02:28:40.078
I was too freaking out in the background to hear this shit.

02:28:40.658 --> 02:28:41.980
Holy cow.

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:48.365
On the same page that there was no spread of a novel deadly risk additive pathogen.

02:28:48.425 --> 02:28:50.827
It had been circulating for years, if not decades.

02:28:51.307 --> 02:28:53.188
and this chart suggests that.

02:28:53.688 --> 02:29:01.450
So what we're here is we see, and I have a matching chart that shows vaccinations too, and it's exactly what you expect.

02:29:01.890 --> 02:29:13.493
Vaccinations go up, and we note that when we start gain of function about a dozen years ago, we see a sustained elevation in influenza-attributed mortality.

02:29:13.673 --> 02:29:14.173
Holy shit!

02:29:14.333 --> 02:29:16.794
In spite of an increase in the vaccination.

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:18.475
Wow, I can't believe it!

02:29:18.495 --> 02:29:19.755
And we also note we have

02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:26.732
an elevation in unspecified coronavirus mortality, which starts, guess what, with gain of function.

02:29:27.312 --> 02:29:30.554
So one of our big contentions is there was no spread.

02:29:30.794 --> 02:29:33.415
One of our big contentions is what?

02:29:33.635 --> 02:29:35.735
Of a novel deadly risk additive.

02:29:35.775 --> 02:29:39.977
The five coronavirus mortality, which starts, guess what, with gain of function.

02:29:40.557 --> 02:29:46.699
So one of our big contentions is there was no spread of a novel deadly risk additive pathogen.

02:29:46.959 --> 02:29:48.440
It had been circulating

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:54.507
for years, if not decades, and we have multiple lines of evidence on that.

02:29:54.987 --> 02:30:04.117
And the increase in mortality spike in the spring of 2020 was a New York only event with nothing else happening in the rest of the country.

02:30:05.139 --> 02:30:07.021
And then everything went sideways from there.

02:30:08.191 --> 02:30:12.794
So that's where I'll finish up, because I've got a patient here now, and I'll let JJ.

02:30:12.914 --> 02:30:15.016
I can stay on for a little longer than this.

02:30:15.036 --> 02:30:17.477
43 minutes minus the questions.

02:30:17.537 --> 02:30:21.760
So we're talking about an hour, and we're like 10 minutes left.

02:30:22.521 --> 02:30:24.082
And the staff is already done.

02:30:24.322 --> 02:30:26.023
The staff is already tired of listening.

02:30:26.904 --> 02:30:34.749
Staff has already been absolutely bamboozled with stupid graphs that have never been explained, with axes that were never explained.

02:30:34.789 --> 02:30:37.051
There's no cursor on the screen here at all.

02:30:38.021 --> 02:30:40.802
It's really extraordinary when you see it in retrospect.

02:30:41.122 --> 02:30:41.603
JJ.

02:30:43.163 --> 02:30:49.046
I mean, part of that too, I'll come back to kind of what we're- Oh, we're gonna give JJ some time?

02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:49.906
Oh no, not yet.

02:30:50.027 --> 02:30:51.887
Jessica's got a few more things to say.

02:30:52.308 --> 02:31:06.074
Asking for after JJ goes, but I know for me, after two plus years of looking at this, it is highly unlikely that this daily death curve and the curves that underlie it represent a real time event.

02:31:06.886 --> 02:31:10.188
And the burden of proof is on those who are making the claim.

02:31:10.789 --> 02:31:12.350
And we have no proof.

02:31:12.390 --> 02:31:15.272
We don't even have basic proof that this occurred.

02:31:15.312 --> 02:31:17.493
We have digits in a spreadsheet.

02:31:18.093 --> 02:31:27.239
And my question is, did the number of people purported to have died on each day all die on... She's reading to the right of her or to the left.

02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:29.041
I can see her eyes moving over there.

02:31:29.121 --> 02:31:30.461
All die, period.

02:31:31.282 --> 02:31:32.343
All die on that day.

02:31:32.363 --> 02:31:35.745
Die in the setting or place that's claimed and die only once.

02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:40.954
I mean, this is the biggest mass casualty event in US history, but we don't have any proof.

02:31:41.034 --> 02:31:43.476
We don't even have names of the people who died.

02:31:44.016 --> 02:31:45.698
Go ahead, JJ, you switch over.

02:31:45.758 --> 02:31:48.560
I'll stop sharing my screen and I'll go back when we're wrapping up.

02:31:52.483 --> 02:31:53.744
Oh, you're muted, JJ.

02:31:54.645 --> 02:31:58.548
I'm gonna use my own tech, so you gotta watch me as the speaker, otherwise you won't see my screen.

02:31:58.829 --> 02:32:02.672
And if that's a problem, I apologize, but it should work, okay?

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:20.115
So I want to do a 30,000 foot summary of what they're talking about so that you understand that if you don't understand the biology of RNA viruses, then you can't exercise informed consent when somebody tells you you need a medical countermeasure to protect yourself from it.

02:32:20.735 --> 02:32:27.880
And from the very beginning of the pandemic, none of us could exercise informed consent because we were misled about what's happening.

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:43.051
And this is the overarching role that New York City played for the United States and a lot of the world, is that a mass casualty event in New York City was misconstrued as evidence of some spreading novel pathogen that we all had to act on.

02:32:43.371 --> 02:32:48.795
And so wouldn't that have been a great thing to say sometime in the last 45 fricking minutes?

02:32:49.758 --> 02:32:52.340
Wouldn't that have been a great place for Jessica to start?

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:58.984
And what did that other guy even have to say that assisted in our understanding of what happened in New York City?

02:32:59.024 --> 02:32:59.805
Do you really know?

02:32:59.825 --> 02:33:00.545
I don't.

02:33:02.947 --> 02:33:06.009
He might just be a useful idiot that Jessica's also playing.

02:33:07.574 --> 02:33:17.962
And I want you to understand very clearly that there are people that are organized, very well organized to assure that we cannot exercise informed consent.

02:33:17.982 --> 02:33:19.743
This is known since the 20s.

02:33:19.783 --> 02:33:29.530
This is a quote from Edward Bernays, which says, the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element of democratic society.

02:33:29.971 --> 02:33:35.715
What we are suggesting is that we have been manipulated to believe a pandemic occurred when in fact it did not.

02:33:36.275 --> 02:33:39.177
and they know that pandemics actually cannot occur.

02:33:39.737 --> 02:33:52.065
The entire biosecurity state understands that coronavirus cannot do what they said it did, but they have succeeded in creating the illusion that it has, and the illusion is very, very good.

02:33:52.686 --> 02:34:02.412
And it is founded on the principle that the most important question to ask since 2020 is whether it was a bat cave virus or whether it was a gain-of-function lab leak.

02:34:02.972 --> 02:34:12.982
And as long as you keep asking this question, which Senator Ron Johnson has been asking since 2020, you never questioned the existence of the spreading pathogen in the first place.

02:34:13.503 --> 02:34:18.528
Now, the reason why this is important is because, as you said, Colleen, so nicely,

02:34:19.048 --> 02:34:24.252
Firefighters and EMTs were all misled by the idea that a novel virus was around.

02:34:24.292 --> 02:34:27.334
So they changed the way that they decided to transport people.

02:34:27.715 --> 02:34:31.998
Because of this fear and uncertainty and doubt, they don't want to risk getting this novel pathogen.

02:34:32.378 --> 02:34:36.762
They would rather follow the do not resuscitate orders than risk bringing it home to their family.

02:34:37.222 --> 02:34:41.826
And they were using things like pulse oximeters to describe who was sick.

02:34:42.631 --> 02:35:01.890
So this led to the misuse of ventilators, the lack of antibiotic use, because they don't work on viruses, poor use of steroids, because that would be crazy, the implication of remdesivir and midazolam as we moved through the pandemic, the misconstruing of 500,000 opioid deaths, which have occurred over the last three years.

02:35:02.430 --> 02:35:04.933
No one talks about, but they went up starting in 2019.

02:35:06.855 --> 02:35:07.836
and started to peak in 2020, 21, 22.

02:35:08.497 --> 02:35:12.661
There was death certificate fraud, financial incentives.

02:35:13.382 --> 02:35:15.404
The opioid deaths have not been acknowledged.

02:35:15.444 --> 02:35:18.808
There are 500,000 of them in the last three years.

02:35:18.848 --> 02:35:19.749
Have you heard about them?

02:35:21.391 --> 02:35:25.515
you hear numbers that are very, very much lower than what are the real numbers.

02:35:25.555 --> 02:35:34.602
When you know people and families who have lost people and we count them, the numbers that the federal government reported for 2020 and 21 are ridiculous.

02:35:34.642 --> 02:35:39.727
So what I'm suggesting to you is thousands since the pandemic started.

02:35:39.807 --> 02:35:47.573
So again, to confound the fact that this is a long list of sources of death that have all been misconstrued as excess,

02:35:48.454 --> 02:35:51.937
excess that has been generally blamed on a novel virus.

02:35:52.477 --> 02:36:15.316
And you will notice that all of these people that were in a meeting in Bucharest, Romania in 2023 saw the presentation of Denny Rancourt, who since the beginning of the pandemic has been saying that there is no spread of a novel virus, but instead excess mortality on any national level or any state level only started after the rollout of

02:36:15.836 --> 02:36:16.757
the transfections.

02:36:16.817 --> 02:36:27.665
Now, what's really interesting about that is, is that a number of people who saw this presentation in Bucharest were also in front of Senator Ron Johnson, not even a month ago.

02:36:28.125 --> 02:36:34.089
And they had nothing to say other than transfection in healthy humans was rushed, but it worked.

02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:37.432
And they said that an RNA caused this pandemic.

02:36:37.452 --> 02:36:39.153
It was probably a gain-of-function virus.

02:36:39.173 --> 02:36:41.315
That was their explanation for what happened.

02:36:42.426 --> 02:37:01.277
And what I would suggest to you is that they are covering up for the fact that academic biologists all around the United States should have known and did know, as I did, because I got fired as a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine because I spoke out that transfection is not vaccination.

02:37:01.337 --> 02:37:08.601
And in fact, every academic biologist and any academic biologist that was in front of Senator Ron Johnson in that hearing knows this.

02:37:09.201 --> 02:37:11.463
and that RNA itself cannot pandemic.

02:37:11.503 --> 02:37:20.990
You shouldn't misconstrue different words like virus and all this other stuff to mean anything other than this, which is RNA can pandemic.

02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:24.873
RNA cannot do that, but they have told you that an RNA molecule

02:37:25.413 --> 02:37:39.500
with no other enzymes, no mitochondria, nothing, spilled in a mud puddle in Wuhan, China, can spread around the world consistently for five years, and we can track it with over 15 million sequences.

02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:51.366
This is a biological absurdity that is so ridiculous that it's absurd that these four people, after seeing Denny Rancourt's presentation and knowing all of these things,

02:37:51.886 --> 02:38:08.553
decided to go in front of your boss and tell you that there was a novel virus that killed over 7 million people in the world and over 1 million people in the United States, and then to go on to tell you that although we saved a lot of people with transfection, we also hurt some of them because there's some DNA contamination in it.

02:38:08.994 --> 02:38:11.555
And what I need you to understand is that's not true.

02:38:12.475 --> 02:38:32.086
The best hypothesis that I have, and I think these people will mostly agree with me, is that the WHO declared a dangerous novel pathogen was spreading around the world, and that enabled our national security state to change what was normally pneumonia and influenza into a national security threat.

02:38:32.546 --> 02:38:40.712
And by doing so and telling everyone to use protocols that actually killed people, they were able to create a mass casualty event in New York City.

02:38:41.493 --> 02:38:48.418
And that's not only the incentives, but also the lies and also the lack of testing and all of these things combined.

02:38:48.438 --> 02:38:49.699
You don't have to pick one.

02:38:50.139 --> 02:38:50.919
And that's the point.

02:38:50.999 --> 02:38:54.622
A lot of the people that have been in front of your boss have picked one and wrote a book about it.

02:38:54.982 --> 02:38:56.884
And they don't summarize across the

02:38:57.324 --> 02:39:00.885
the narrative, which is that there is no way this could have occurred.

02:39:01.325 --> 02:39:02.305
It's not possible.

02:39:02.405 --> 02:39:10.486
More likely it is that what was a background, which is what the previous speaker said, what was a background was misconstrued as spread.

02:39:10.847 --> 02:39:21.368
You have to think of an analogy, and it's a very difficult analogy to come up with, but imagine that you gave cops a new way to test drivers to find out if they're drunk driving, and that drunk driving could be asymptomatic.

02:39:21.408 --> 02:39:24.069
You could actually not be drinking and still be drunk driving.

02:39:24.489 --> 02:39:30.374
And anybody who tested positive would be put in the hospital, or not put in the hospital, put in jail for 30 days.

02:39:30.714 --> 02:39:35.098
How many people would lose their job for being a drunk driver unnecessarily?

02:39:35.198 --> 02:39:38.781
How bad would that go if there was a financial incentive for cops to do it?

02:39:38.821 --> 02:39:46.627
How bad would it go if it was a national security priority to get all drunk drivers, even the ones that are asymptomatic, off the streets as fast as possible?

02:39:47.127 --> 02:39:48.248
That's what they did.

02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:49.790
And this is an attack

02:39:50.270 --> 02:40:04.285
It is an attack on the United States citizenry to get them to believe that the national security state is necessary for the future going forward and that transfection is a new way for us to get medical treatments that we never would have gotten before.

02:40:04.345 --> 02:40:07.709
These two lies are the reason why this is all happening.

02:40:07.729 --> 02:40:08.489
I don't need to go there.

02:40:08.509 --> 02:40:09.010
I won't go there.

02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.591
I'll just leave it here.

02:40:10.191 --> 02:40:30.323
that's really important to see though this this has been a deception that is all based on new york i should have went there it's too bad i didn't go there but i already was running out of time so i didn't go to the last slide i left it here that was too bad but i did bring the heat i think right i did bring the heat city and the things that you were commenting on in the end

02:40:30.979 --> 02:40:49.409
which is including we didn't really have clarity about what was happening in the beginning, was part of the illusion that these people need to insist that you never question those things so that you never get to the actual root cause, which was the lies that were told in 2020 and that were stuck to hook, line, and sinker.

02:40:49.609 --> 02:40:59.234
Everybody insisted that those lies were true right up until they stood in front of your boss in the Senate, not even a month ago, and still insisted that those lies are true.

02:41:01.311 --> 02:41:03.373
Damn, come on now.

02:41:03.433 --> 02:41:04.253
Agreed, JJ.

02:41:05.114 --> 02:41:14.141
So let me wrap this up and then state pretty clearly or hopefully pretty clearly what we're asking for, at least what I'm asking for.

02:41:15.362 --> 02:41:21.086
Just to reiterate what JJ just said, why does this New York, pardon me a second,

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:24.915
Why does this New York event even matter?

02:41:25.055 --> 02:41:26.076
Like, why do we care?

02:41:26.136 --> 02:41:38.166
Well, I think we're contending that without the New York event, there would have been no selling Americans or even the rest of the world on the WHO pandemic declaration, or the story of a novel spreading virus in need of new treatments and a dedicated shot.

02:41:38.946 --> 02:41:44.131
Senator Johnson has been really great about hearing victims of

02:41:45.987 --> 02:41:49.888
the COVID shot and people who've had adverse effects.

02:41:50.468 --> 02:41:59.311
I humbly submit that a shot was never needed, that no proof of spread or an emergency was ever given to the American people.

02:41:59.391 --> 02:42:00.672
Instead, it was presumed.

02:42:01.292 --> 02:42:06.254
And then plans to make a shot and deliver it to everybody just went right ahead.

02:42:07.354 --> 02:42:13.376
If the curve is manipulated or fraudulent in any way, and there's multiple ways that that could

02:42:13.766 --> 02:42:15.547
could occur on the practical level.

02:42:16.027 --> 02:42:23.351
But if it is, it presents a serious challenge to there was a pandemic and everything that came afterward.

02:42:23.671 --> 02:42:27.553
And the New York curve underlies the US curve.

02:42:28.053 --> 02:42:36.658
So there is no way for the US daily death curve to be accurate for 2020, at least, if the New York City curve is not accurate.

02:42:37.898 --> 02:42:42.361
We have no proof, you know, unlike the World Trade Center disaster.

02:42:42.561 --> 02:42:43.542
Oh my gosh, I don't even remember this.

02:42:43.582 --> 02:42:52.248
There are no witnesses to a single event or phenomenon in spring 2020 that would obviously or logically result in 26 to 27,000 extra bodies.

02:42:52.928 --> 02:42:56.611
There is no list of names, unlike the World Trade Center disaster.

02:42:56.971 --> 02:42:58.352
There's no documentary.

02:42:59.052 --> 02:42:59.993
There's no memorial.

02:43:00.799 --> 02:43:07.562
And there is a dearth of authentic on-the-ground testimonies that fit with official data or with the magnitude of death.

02:43:07.662 --> 02:43:08.662
And yes, that occurs.

02:43:08.922 --> 02:43:28.150
That includes Pierre Corey, who arrived, I just want to point out, was in New York, but arrived on the scene April 27, 2020, post-peak, and then nine days later was sitting in front of Senator Johnson testifying at the Homeland Security Committee meeting.

02:43:28.351 --> 02:43:29.431
I find that interesting.

02:43:30.455 --> 02:43:36.600
These numbers that we're showing you, they are not proof of death or proof that a death event occurred.

02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:46.888
Unlike some states and jurisdictions, New York laws conveniently do not permit the request or release of death certificates under freedom of information requests.

02:43:46.908 --> 02:43:49.570
And unlike Chicago, unlike Milwaukee,

02:43:50.926 --> 02:43:52.507
Actually, I'm sure this is true of all of Wisconsin.

02:43:52.567 --> 02:43:53.768
It's true for all of Illinois.

02:43:54.048 --> 02:44:01.672
The medical examiner's determinations for the deaths that the medical examiner handles, they're not subject to public scrutiny.

02:44:02.612 --> 02:44:03.753
What is that about?

02:44:03.973 --> 02:44:09.416
So we basically have this closed system event in a black box.

02:44:09.436 --> 02:44:13.257
I recently obtained data from FEMA

02:44:14.890 --> 02:44:30.457
on the deaths, the dates of death of people, I should say survivors of people who died during this event, New York City residents who died during this event, who had applied for the FEMA funeral assistance, applied and received.

02:44:30.697 --> 02:44:41.302
So what you're seeing here- Funeral assistance was something that Alex Berenson and Joe Rogan talked about for like 20 minutes.

02:44:41.942 --> 02:44:43.423
Is the all cause per,

02:44:44.431 --> 02:44:51.896
Then you see COVID deaths of New York City residents that identified COVID-19 as underlying cause.

02:44:52.936 --> 02:44:55.318
Any cause would be a little higher than that.

02:44:55.878 --> 02:45:02.462
The blue line is the deaths for which assistance was applied.

02:45:03.262 --> 02:45:06.925
And then the purple line is people who received the assistance.

02:45:07.165 --> 02:45:09.006
So here's why this is important.

02:45:09.526 --> 02:45:14.029
Gage said to me in the elevator of the hotel in front of people in their dripping,

02:45:14.585 --> 02:45:35.784
dripping uh they got into the they were from the pool so there were three ladies from the pool that knew me from the red pill and then there was Richard Gage and myself in the elevator and the elevator closed i had already pushed six for him and we go up the elevator and he looks at me in front of those ladies who said thanks for your red pill conference talk and he says so you had to call people liars today huh

02:45:37.637 --> 02:45:40.900
And I was like, wow, I didn't know what to say.

02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:47.787
And then the ding went off and the door opened and Richard Gage walked kind of out of the elevator, still looking back at me.

02:45:48.407 --> 02:45:51.430
And I said, I have to tell the truth while I can so my kids know it.

02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:53.772
And he said, oh, okay.

02:45:54.433 --> 02:45:55.554
And then he walked to his room.

02:45:56.715 --> 02:46:00.218
That was my interaction with the great Richard Gage.

02:46:00.639 --> 02:46:01.780
Very, very awesome.

02:46:02.168 --> 02:46:08.331
It's important because when you apply for this aid, you have to submit a death certificate, right?

02:46:08.891 --> 02:46:22.896
So in my mind, at most, we have a very, very small number of corroborated proofs of death from another federal agency.

02:46:23.697 --> 02:46:28.599
This is pretty surprising that New Yorkers would leave so much money on the table.

02:46:29.059 --> 02:46:30.299
I have a hard time believing that.

02:46:30.559 --> 02:46:31.480
Go ahead, JJ.

02:46:32.829 --> 02:46:40.753
I just wanted to make sure that it's very hard for me to hit a 30,000 foot home run with you guys on the biology.

02:46:40.873 --> 02:46:46.595
Any of the things that I stated in the general statements that I made, I can back up with any amount of

02:46:47.876 --> 02:47:14.487
Primary literature that you want and the second thing to make sure that this doesn't that won't really do you very much good But yeah, I can show you what to I can I can give you a clue but the point and so then they asked for papers well any papers you could send me would be great and again, I get very frustrated with that because it is a It is a really cheap out that also the no virus people were using all the time when I was talking about infectious clones Well, send me some papers that talks about clones.

02:47:14.547 --> 02:47:15.187
It's like dude.

02:47:15.707 --> 02:47:16.448
Are you kidding me?

02:47:17.406 --> 02:47:24.756
Like, this is not something where I can send you a few papers and by the time you get done with a few abstracts, you're gonna know what I'm talking about.

02:47:25.196 --> 02:47:31.985
And it's extremely obvious to me now that that was one of the games that was played from the very, very beginning.

02:47:32.506 --> 02:47:52.770
that a single abstract of a single pre-print or a single pre-print or a single published paper in some weird cell culture model was enough to say amyloid or prion or mitochondrial damage or whatever other bullshit that they wanted to say.

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:54.450
One paper's enough.

02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:56.010
One figure's enough.

02:47:56.170 --> 02:47:59.871
One pre-print was enough for anyone to argue about anything.

02:48:02.591 --> 02:48:05.235
And so when you say, oh yeah, I can back this stuff up.

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:10.423
What I'm suggesting to you is, is you should spend hours with me so I can teach you this.

02:48:10.503 --> 02:48:13.568
Not so I can send you a couple of newspaper articles.

02:48:16.576 --> 02:48:20.619
Because what you're suggesting, I mean, you really need to learn virology, right?

02:48:20.639 --> 02:48:22.140
You need to learn molecular biology.

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:24.742
You need to actually have a PhD in biology.

02:48:24.862 --> 02:48:31.907
Not saying that you can't, but that's the reason why these people can stand in front of Senator Ron Johnson and fool him.

02:48:31.967 --> 02:48:38.551
Because it takes technical expertise to understand when somebody who's worked for the Human Genome Project is lying and when they're not.

02:48:39.052 --> 02:48:40.192
It takes a real... Bam!

02:48:43.255 --> 02:48:45.317
but they've been available for 20 years.

02:48:45.357 --> 02:48:51.004
I mean, you can read about it, you can start anywhere you want, but let me just get back to my main reason why I interrupted.

02:48:51.184 --> 02:48:59.694
I hope that somewhere in your notes, you can write down that in no way, shape or form are any of the three of us saying that there are no viruses,

02:49:00.475 --> 02:49:03.616
We are not saying that viruses don't exist.

02:49:03.696 --> 02:49:14.878
We are not saying that anything about isolation or any of these other stories, what we are suggesting to you is that a mass casualty event occurred and it was misconstrued as something that it was not.

02:49:15.438 --> 02:49:25.180
And there is a lot of biology that they have told us on television that is entirely contradictory to the 50 plus years of biology that preceded the pandemic.

02:49:27.861 --> 02:49:40.870
I find myself right now is trapped in this area where people are getting in front of your boss and still perpetuating these biological ideas which are absolutely implausible and not supported by any of the data that comes before the pandemic.

02:49:41.892 --> 02:49:44.994
And my point of view, I'm not a biologist.

02:49:45.014 --> 02:49:46.655
I have a PhD, but in a different field.

02:49:46.995 --> 02:49:51.418
And I'm coming at this from the point of view of a citizen, a mom.

02:49:51.898 --> 02:49:57.842
And I'm just demanding some basics here, that the government prove that an event occurred.

02:49:58.462 --> 02:50:19.143
but you know like the data the fact that kevin mccairn is rinsing me on his streams after four and a half years of 2 000 views a video should be all the evidence you need that i'm right because someone has had a full-time job in japan or wherever that liar lives and he's had a full-time job because of me

02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:23.523
There's no other reason for him to exist.

02:50:23.623 --> 02:50:23.843
Why?

02:50:23.883 --> 02:50:27.127
Because Stephanie Seneff needs a place to talk?

02:50:27.147 --> 02:50:32.834
Or because that Joachim, whatever his name is from Germany, needs a place to sell his supplements?

02:50:35.089 --> 02:50:58.583
If you can't see that every minute that Kevin McCarron can't stop mentioning my name is like putting great big giant shoulder pads with stripes and eagles and stars and sparkly shit on there because that just means that I'm so right that there's some clown show going on.

02:50:58.991 --> 02:51:07.456
that has existed exclusively for me, just like probably, believe it or not, George Webb probably exists largely because of Mark.

02:51:10.858 --> 02:51:23.406
But of course, anybody who doesn't know that Mark was responsible for Peter Strzok even making the news would also discount Mark's contribution to the pandemic narrative falling apart the way it is.

02:51:24.782 --> 02:51:27.465
None of these people will touch his website.

02:51:28.086 --> 02:51:28.747
None of them.

02:51:29.748 --> 02:51:38.679
Not Liam Sturgess or any of these other intrepid interviewing people will use Mark's website for anything.

02:51:42.196 --> 02:51:56.157
They won't even mention that it exists, even though it's just an objective collection of newspaper articles that seems to show a bunch of liars behind this that have coordinated their illusion about what biosecurity means and why we need to be afraid of it.

02:51:59.977 --> 02:52:06.980
And somehow or another, I'm getting a shit sandwich here in this presentation, and it's always circling back to the bread.

02:52:07.281 --> 02:52:10.342
And I'm not saying that no mass casualty event occurred.

02:52:10.462 --> 02:52:12.223
I'm not saying that there wasn't excess death.

02:52:12.783 --> 02:52:17.066
I'm saying I shouldn't have to go to all this trouble to try to find out what occurred.

02:52:18.266 --> 02:52:21.529
It's not substantiated by the FEMA funeral data.

02:52:23.230 --> 02:52:23.850
That's for sure.

02:52:24.451 --> 02:52:25.031
That's for sure.

02:52:25.912 --> 02:52:27.433
So what are we asking for?

02:52:27.533 --> 02:52:31.837
Well, I mean, overall, I think I at least am asking for proof.

02:52:31.977 --> 02:52:36.100
There should be some way, and I know New York has its own laws, but

02:52:36.876 --> 02:52:46.219
There's gotta be some way or some lawyer, I don't know, some effort, some legislator that has an interest in verifying and proving this event.

02:52:46.279 --> 02:52:54.122
As a matter of course, the US government should not be able to make a claim about an emergency and say, oh, this many people died and just show us numbers on a screen.

02:52:54.182 --> 02:52:58.563
It's just- Actually, the way the PrEP Act is worded, they don't have to show you shit.

02:52:59.764 --> 02:53:05.525
The way the PREP Act is worded, the Health and Human Services Secretary can go on a whim.

02:53:06.126 --> 02:53:09.806
They don't need to have any rational basis for declaring the emergency.

02:53:09.826 --> 02:53:15.308
And I bet you $1,000 that Janet Reno in the chat will 100% confirm that's true.

02:53:15.348 --> 02:53:17.968
There's no rational basis necessary.

02:53:17.988 --> 02:53:20.349
They don't need one number, nevermind 1,000.

02:53:22.009 --> 02:53:24.050
The only people that needed that number were the TV news.

02:53:26.018 --> 02:53:27.359
because they didn't need shit.

02:53:27.939 --> 02:53:29.540
All they needed to do was declare it.

02:53:31.101 --> 02:53:36.325
It's just absurd, and I hope that offends all of us, regardless of where we stand on this issue.

02:53:36.925 --> 02:53:51.275
I think I'd also like to see acknowledgement that the New York event played an outsized role in convincing Americans that a pandemic emergency existed, hasn't been substantiated, and it has to be investigated, including not just nursing homes, but hospitals.

02:53:51.715 --> 02:53:52.616
What happened there?

02:53:53.183 --> 02:53:57.788
and with whatever went on with deaths at home and emergency medical services.

02:53:58.328 --> 02:54:00.070
Ultimately, we want accountability.

02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:03.053
We have people talking about the next pandemic.

02:54:03.233 --> 02:54:08.598
Well, can we talk about whether there was a pandemic even occurred back here in 2020?

02:54:09.359 --> 02:54:14.664
Because all three of us, I think, would say the evidence is very, very thin, if not none.

02:54:18.135 --> 02:54:20.577
So we've got more to talk about.

02:54:20.617 --> 02:54:24.841
We've got more to explore, but 252 is probably enough for me.

02:54:26.122 --> 02:54:28.664
Ladies and gentlemen, these people are lying.

02:54:28.704 --> 02:54:30.746
They're lying about the worst case scenario.

02:54:30.806 --> 02:54:43.477
They're lying about not being able to understand what I mean when I say that a background signal was conflated and that they could easily use a clone to put a signal anywhere they wanted to.

02:54:44.758 --> 02:55:04.371
And that's why I find it hilarious that Jonathan and Martin and these other people adjacent to Panda claim that they couldn't get a virology explanation down about clones that made any sense, that couldn't contribute to a rebuttal to Kevin McKernan, but instead wrote the shittiest virology 101 review ever.

02:55:05.251 --> 02:55:16.077
and they wrote it just a couple weeks ago, it's no different than just saying that there's bat cave viruses and gain-of-function viruses and they can stitch stuff together, but we're not really sure it's a good explanation for anything.

02:55:17.218 --> 02:55:22.281
When in reality, this lie is based on the idea that they can make synthetic DNA.

02:55:22.701 --> 02:55:32.367
They can find sequences in bats and they can make that sequence and then transfect cell cultures with it and then tell you at the end of the third passage that the virus is different.

02:55:33.171 --> 02:55:53.515
They can also make those same sequences and put them in animals and those animals might shed those sequences to other animals because of proximity or maybe even because there's limited form of replication that you can detect a PCR positive and sequence something with metagenomic sequencing in the last animal that you put in the first animal.

02:55:53.975 --> 02:55:56.116
But because you're starting with a purity,

02:55:56.696 --> 02:56:06.966
and a concentration that cannot be generated any other way other than synthetically, then none of these experimental models recapitulate what they claim is virology.

02:56:07.802 --> 02:56:27.213
And therefore, all of the biology upon which pandemic potential is based, is based solely on synthetic biology and specifically transfection and transformation of these various laboratory models, and not actually infection by a native natural agent.

02:56:27.914 --> 02:56:32.016
Because those are extremely hard, if not impossible to isolate and to study.

02:56:33.629 --> 02:56:47.702
And once you realize that that's what all of these people are hiding, that's what all of these people need to stand in front of me for, because I'm the one who can explain this succinctly where Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan and all these other people cannot.

02:56:48.383 --> 02:56:50.265
Because they are hiding this.

02:56:50.865 --> 02:56:54.208
They are hiding the fact that synthetic biology is real.

02:56:55.180 --> 02:57:06.468
that synthetic biology has become cheap and that means transfection and transformation for any purpose in any way shape or form can be used against us and misconstrued has virology.

02:57:07.269 --> 02:57:12.793
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:57:13.253 --> 02:57:17.196
Transfection in healthy humans has always been criminally negligent and RNA

02:57:18.096 --> 02:57:34.339
Cannot pandemic and you can say it any way you want to as long as you say it You don't have to give credit to me as long as you say it ladies and gentlemen stop all transfections and humans they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary and Thank you very much for joining me.

02:57:34.359 --> 02:57:42.241
This has been giga home biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists There will be some sub stack

02:57:42.921 --> 02:57:47.445
There will be some Substack support for the conclusions that I'm reaching.

02:57:48.265 --> 02:57:50.027
And so stay tuned for that coming up.

02:57:50.447 --> 02:57:52.369
I'm going to try and populate Substack more.

02:57:52.429 --> 02:57:56.432
It's just, it's very hard right now in summer vacation with all the kids at home.

02:57:56.812 --> 02:57:57.693
I'm trying to be done.

02:57:57.713 --> 02:57:59.094
I'm trying to do it right.

02:57:59.474 --> 02:58:00.996
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

02:58:01.096 --> 02:58:02.737
Every day, we're going to do a little work.

02:58:02.797 --> 02:58:05.039
Tomorrow, I'll try to be on in the morning again.

02:58:05.739 --> 02:58:10.301
Keep your arms straight, ladies and gentlemen, and keep your flashlights facing forward.

02:58:10.341 --> 02:58:11.962
Thanks for being in the chat, Janet.

02:58:12.322 --> 02:58:13.502
It's always great to see you.

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:15.823
And everybody, thank you very much.

02:58:15.903 --> 02:58:16.864
I'll see you again tomorrow.
