WEBVTT

00:14.817 --> 00:16.698
Test 1-2, testing 1-2.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.621
Test 1-2, testing 1-2.

00:20.641 --> 00:24.103
Hey, good afternoon, good evening.

00:24.203 --> 00:26.545
It's 6-16 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:26.585 --> 00:30.467
My name is Jonathan Cooley coming to you live for the second time today to finish up the show.

00:30.587 --> 00:34.470
I promised you I'd come back after basketball and I am back after basketball.

00:35.090 --> 00:40.154
I just wanted to make sure that everybody understands that if you're interested in learning how to do this,

00:41.032 --> 00:42.233
if you want to learn how it's done.

00:42.273 --> 00:49.898
If you just want to verify that it's actually done by one guy in one place with some Craigslist stuff, you're welcome to sit over there on that couch.

00:49.939 --> 00:59.025
You're welcome to come and visit the house and I'll tell you everything that I'm doing and show you how it's done so that you too can stream from the back of your garage.

00:59.045 --> 01:00.947
Not everybody's going to be lucky enough to have

01:01.667 --> 01:03.629
a wood shop in the back of their garage.

01:03.689 --> 01:12.636
But my family sacrificed a couple bedrooms in order to rent this house so that I would have this workspace that I could make noise in and do all of my nonsense.

01:13.477 --> 01:14.477
And so that's where we are.

01:15.218 --> 01:16.359
I'm very excited to be here.

01:16.439 --> 01:17.680
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:17.740 --> 01:18.881
It's gonna be a great show.

01:20.262 --> 01:24.646
I'm really looking forward to sharing what I have with you, for you.

01:26.027 --> 01:28.749
And yeah, anyway, I don't know.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.390
We'll see you again soon, I guess.

01:30.430 --> 01:31.071
We'll see you soon.

01:33.686 --> 01:34.787
Don't take Tylenol.

01:35.327 --> 01:35.967
Don't take it.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.648
With Tylenol, don't take it.

01:38.249 --> 01:38.949
Don't take it.

01:39.189 --> 01:40.470
Don't use Tylenol.

01:40.610 --> 01:41.590
Don't take Tylenol.

01:41.951 --> 01:43.552
Don't take Tylenol.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.353
Fight like hell not to take it.

01:45.553 --> 01:46.613
I think you shouldn't take it.

01:46.753 --> 01:47.974
Don't take Tylenol.

01:48.194 --> 01:51.616
The baby goes, gets a shot, they say, here, take a cup of Tylenol.

01:51.696 --> 01:52.637
I've heard that for years.

01:52.697 --> 01:53.497
Take Tylenol.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.198
Don't take Tylenol.

01:55.278 --> 01:56.939
Don't have your baby take Tylenol.

01:57.099 --> 01:58.440
Don't give Tylenol.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.261
to the baby.

02:00.541 --> 02:02.402
Don't give Tylenol to the baby.

02:02.642 --> 02:04.303
Don't give your baby Tylenol.

02:04.643 --> 02:05.944
Don't take Tylenol.

02:06.244 --> 02:08.406
Don't take Tylenol.

02:08.866 --> 02:11.148
Don't take Tylenol.

02:11.468 --> 02:12.128
Don't take it.

02:12.348 --> 02:13.009
Don't take it.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.891
So that's it.

02:16.611 --> 02:17.952
There's nothing much to say.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.853
Don't take Tylenol.

02:19.873 --> 02:20.654
Just don't take it.

02:21.154 --> 02:23.035
And I just say it again.

02:23.255 --> 02:25.737
Don't take Tylenol.

02:26.137 --> 02:26.638
Don't take it.

02:59.151 --> 03:24.931
I don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too Thursday, I don't care about you It's Friday, I'm in love Monday you can fall apart Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart Oh, Thursday doesn't even start It's Friday, I'm in love

03:30.498 --> 03:36.220
Monday always comes too late, but Friday never hesitates.

03:37.200 --> 03:43.282
I don't care if Monday's black, Tuesday, Wednesday, hard to tell.

03:44.122 --> 03:46.883
Thursday, never looking back.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.564
It's Friday, I'm in love.

04:05.714 --> 04:08.095
Monday, you can hold your head.

04:08.776 --> 04:12.817
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed on Thursday.

04:13.197 --> 04:15.198
Watch the walls instead.

04:15.318 --> 04:17.819
It's Friday, I'm in love.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.281
Saturday, wait.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.723
Sunday, always come to me.

04:26.423 --> 04:27.984
But Friday never has it.

04:39.253 --> 04:42.637
It's Friday

04:59.402 --> 05:24.665
I don't care if Monday's blue Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too Thursday, I don't care about you It's Friday, I'm in love Monday you can fall apart Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart Thursday doesn't even start It's Friday, I'm in love

05:59.532 --> 06:01.514
Welcome to the show again, ladies and gentlemen.

06:01.554 --> 06:02.735
Welcome to the backyard.

06:03.376 --> 06:04.457
Welcome to the garage.

06:04.777 --> 06:07.920
It's a little bit of both right now with the back door open, the nice sun.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.742
We had a few days of pretty hard rain.

06:11.463 --> 06:15.966
I'm trying to do a little bit of an impression of the Twiv show where they tell everybody about their weather.

06:16.967 --> 06:17.688
Welcome to the show.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.730
Thank you again for joining me this evening.

06:20.070 --> 06:20.711
It's Friday.

06:20.771 --> 06:21.972
I'm very excited about that.

06:22.672 --> 06:25.193
I hope The Cure isn't something that annoys.

06:26.213 --> 06:46.841
It's a long time ago since I dated a girl in college who was absolutely obsessed with The Cure and I never really understood it and now for some reason I actually enjoy that music and it's strange because at the time I did not enjoy The Cure and I didn't understand him and also because of I still don't understand him.

06:46.881 --> 06:49.482
I mean he's a guy who dressed all crazy and whatever but

06:50.182 --> 06:51.363
Anyway, I don't know much about it.

06:51.403 --> 07:00.808
I just know that at the time during college I thought that it wasn't that great of music and it was kind of goofy and now I In in in the nostalgia of it all I like it a lot.

07:00.828 --> 07:11.514
So anyway, we're still seeking the truth here We're still, you know busy lost in the pandemic and trying to figure out exactly what stories they told us and who told us the stories because

07:12.617 --> 07:15.179
Americans were murdered in order to pull this off.

07:15.259 --> 07:22.465
Americans were murdered in order to create the momentum necessary to get us to where we are right now.

07:23.346 --> 07:26.388
I know it sounds pretty harsh, but it's actually the truth.

07:26.428 --> 07:29.111
If you haven't heard it before, it's absolutely true.

07:29.191 --> 07:33.494
Over the last six years, nearly a million Americans were murdered.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.296
I think that's a rough calculation.

07:35.396 --> 07:36.337
It's not too bad.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.980
And yeah, it was, it's not, it's not,

07:42.017 --> 07:42.598
It's not.

07:43.819 --> 07:46.601
And it's also not, no, it's not this either.

07:47.281 --> 07:48.042
It's really not.

07:50.524 --> 08:00.392
It is an elaborate mythology that's based on this idea that evolution because DNA, which is the foundation of Bad Biology 101, it's called the central dogma.

08:02.348 --> 08:23.216
And this argument that we are very insignificant in the grand scheme of evolutionary time because our species has been around for so long and is the culmination, the pinnacle product of a process that started with a lightning bolt in a mud puddle, this has to be unlearned.

08:24.991 --> 08:31.998
There's no possible way to explain our existence by evolution because DNA.

08:32.018 --> 08:34.180
Yet that is what we are teaching our children.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.882
That is what we inherited.

08:36.242 --> 08:38.284
That is what I learned from academia.

08:38.725 --> 08:41.988
And that assumption is horribly wrong.

08:43.269 --> 08:48.674
And it is an assumption that also can be a set of blinders which makes you

08:49.944 --> 08:56.289
unable to see the irreducible complexity of life, the pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

08:56.329 --> 09:04.596
It all becomes invisible, hidden behind this rubric of nonsense, that everything is DNA.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.778
We just don't understand it all yet.

09:06.858 --> 09:15.125
But the assumption is that when we do, it'll all be about the hundred genes that are responsible for autism or something like that.

09:15.965 --> 09:17.507
This has to be broken now.

09:18.854 --> 09:22.395
before it is passed on as an assumption to our children.

09:23.555 --> 09:33.217
And so we need to come together with our kids with a collective understanding of what happened during the pandemic and why it happened.

09:34.338 --> 09:39.939
The motivation stemming all the way back to the Human Genome Project and before.

09:41.440 --> 09:48.848
And the idea that this fake health freedom movement is just a small gear in a much larger machine.

09:49.588 --> 10:01.100
And that's why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel and Alex Karp and Mark Zuckerberg and Bobby Kennedy and Donnie Trump are so ridiculous.

10:03.151 --> 10:15.090
because we are in the midst of a decades long theater that has ramped up exponentially during the pandemic because of our acquiescence to social media, but that too was by design.

10:19.764 --> 10:25.671
And so nobody says it more succinctly than we do, and that's not a bragging point anymore.

10:25.731 --> 10:33.780
That should be a very big red flag for you about all of these other people, because we aren't trying to trademark these ideas.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.223
We haven't ever tried to trademark these ideas.

10:37.263 --> 10:40.847
We just try to get people to say them correctly.

10:41.710 --> 11:06.624
And after a little struggle there in 2023, the vast majority of these people have just vanished and are still unable to make progress to differentiate between various strategies for immunization and realize that intramuscular injection might be the dumbest of all, completely derived from a time in history when we knew jack shit about immunity, the 1800s.

11:08.325 --> 11:11.446
Transfection of healthy humans was a crime in 2020.

11:11.966 --> 11:27.750
And there was a whole crew of people out there on social media and on mainstream media scripted to make sure that we would never come to that realization, especially in academia, where there were plenty of experts that should have done known better.

11:29.588 --> 11:30.789
RNA cannot pandemic.

11:30.849 --> 11:41.453
Anybody that's taken an oral exam for their PhD was probably asked about the central dogma and asked to explain how genes work and result in proteins and stuff.

11:42.214 --> 11:45.255
And so all of those people, this should ring true.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.757
RNA cannot pandemic should be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

11:51.058 --> 12:01.683
And yet it is still in the midst, it is still in the process of pandemicing, still in the process of going endemic now, according to all of our experts on any side.

12:04.722 --> 12:26.307
And autism, being a meaningless word by design, spans the entire spectrum of academia from neuroscience to psychology, and is also edified almost exclusively by this idea that everybody agrees on, that it's a complex interaction between a whole bouquet of genes and environmental exposures.

12:30.492 --> 12:35.937
Coincidentally, all of these same health freedom organizations that are probably against

12:37.659 --> 12:50.621
the transitioning of children are unable to reach the point where they realize a very simple semantic game has been played with us, that a transitioning man is now called a trans woman, and that's just stupid.

12:51.322 --> 13:02.264
In fact, I bet if we could get into a time machine and go back to the early or late 80s, 1980s, I bet you'd find that drag queens were also called trans men.

13:02.664 --> 13:04.164
And then somewhere they flipped it.

13:04.898 --> 13:09.721
And it's just so stupid and it can only be so stupid as to be by design.

13:10.162 --> 13:16.606
The fact that none of the people that are in front of us in social media or on mainstream media have ever come to this conclusion.

13:17.106 --> 13:30.535
No one in academia, no one in the discussion of this topic has ever come to the realization that, you know, we just have to call a transitioning man, a transitioning man and stop calling them a trans woman.

13:30.555 --> 13:34.438
And then this whole problem of the definition of a woman would disappear.

13:35.038 --> 13:54.980
poof just like the whole discussion about whether vaccines cause autism would disappear if we would define it correctly just like the problem of pandemics would go away if we would just define them correctly just like the problem of objecting to i don't know what would go away if we defined them correctly

14:00.638 --> 14:08.803
And so here we are, back again on the Star Trek Enterprise, trying to figure it out, fighting against the podcast model of governance.

14:09.163 --> 14:10.604
And so these are not real people.

14:11.204 --> 14:13.566
They've been put in place for a long, long time.

14:15.799 --> 14:26.127
And at first it seems funny to go back to 2013 and realize that... There was a Robert Malone... A Robert Malone character... Right there...

14:45.618 --> 14:52.665
And in 2013, this is happening in preparation for an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

14:56.789 --> 15:02.655
Joe Rogan is the person that helped them discover what a podcast could do, what a scripted conversation can do.

15:03.476 --> 15:11.978
And this episode of this sci-fi show actually shows very well how they were discovering how a conversation can convince people.

15:12.038 --> 15:16.040
Just sitting across the table from each other and discussing our recent experiences.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.020
I sent you one place, you sent me another.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.201
That's magic that they discovered in 2013.

15:22.181 --> 15:24.162
Now that all by itself might be okay.

15:25.131 --> 15:41.185
but this is an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that they've known since I was in high school, which means putting Joe Rogan there with the pandemic narrative, with a couple of characters that look like Robert Malone, you know, the DOD and DITRA advisor that's behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:41.345 --> 15:47.091
and the fraudulent organization, Children's Health Defense, they've known this is coming.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.843
That's why they put these organizations in place.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.925
That's why they put these people in place so that the narrative can be controlled.

15:53.445 --> 16:04.814
We can all go back to 2015 and see that Rand Paul, Mary Holland, and Paul Offit were already opposite one another about measles and about vaccination and about MMR and about autism back in 2015.

16:04.894 --> 16:06.516
So it is not possible.

16:09.818 --> 16:24.018
that after 10 years none of these extraordinary people have made any progress either in describing the problem nor in rationalizing their correctness in it relative to their antagonists.

16:24.058 --> 16:25.761
He can look as angry as he wants to.

16:27.284 --> 16:43.612
It doesn't change the fact that he has failed to make progress, just like Rand Paul has failed to make progress, like Mary Holland has failed to make progress, like the hosts of Democracy Now have failed to make progress for more than 12 years.

16:46.153 --> 16:47.713
And so the story keeps going, right?

16:47.733 --> 16:49.534
Because RFK is in this story too.

16:49.594 --> 16:53.116
The measles is in this story too, and it's planned this way.

16:55.433 --> 16:59.337
Again, a military exercise is on a completely different time horizon.

16:59.377 --> 17:03.481
It becomes invisible to people who are thinking on social media timescales.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.986
But you can see it if you know what to look for.

17:08.226 --> 17:10.128
ICANN was established on

17:12.842 --> 17:20.710
April Fool's Day 2016 and two weeks later as a result of the Vax movie being pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival.

17:20.730 --> 17:25.494
You know, pulled like Jimmy Kimmel was pulled from ABC News a couple days ago.

17:26.455 --> 17:31.781
So that a certain type of person would seek out that movie.

17:32.594 --> 17:37.078
A certain type of person would seek out that movie and show up at the movie theater and see it.

17:37.118 --> 17:43.645
And in the meantime, these people needed two days on the Today Show to correct the little mistake that they made.

17:43.665 --> 17:47.809
And apparently he's got an autistic son.

17:50.680 --> 17:58.365
Now this alone would be okay, except in 2018, we also have children's health defense being established by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:58.505 --> 18:12.655
and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker, all of whom were in this movie, all of whom were stepping in front of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker at the time, both of whom could say ingestion versus injection, and none of these people say that.

18:13.836 --> 18:18.039
Now we fast forward to 2025, and here is Jimmy Kimmel with

18:19.565 --> 18:28.110
Robert De Niro, again, essentially playing the same role, a part in this conversation about vaccines and autism.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.392
This time, not such a great role, maybe making up for what he did in 2016.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.015
And so these are not real people.

18:38.095 --> 18:39.996
They're on a long-term script.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.418
They are old friends from the man show.

18:43.739 --> 18:44.219
It's gross.

18:47.133 --> 18:51.915
And so this murder and lies is really a podcast kind of thing.

18:51.955 --> 18:56.276
America has been fooled by a decades long theater, a transition to podcasting.

18:56.836 --> 19:04.979
And you can see the transition to podcasting happening across the internet as people go from CNN to their own show, from CNN to Rumble.

19:05.039 --> 19:06.500
It happened all through the pandemic.

19:06.560 --> 19:10.761
All these people knew it was going to happen and you can call them savvy or you can call them scripted.

19:11.994 --> 19:18.139
Because PBS NewsHour now promotes sub-stack authors and sub-stack people as like, that's the normal way to get paid.

19:18.559 --> 19:23.082
They promote X as a very impactual platform that we really need to tune into.

19:23.102 --> 19:26.765
And PBS NewsHour promotes podcasts.

19:29.207 --> 19:37.413
And so if the military industrial complex, if the national security state decided to put actors on podcasts, what would happen?

19:38.499 --> 20:05.379
not just scripted actors that have a military uniform or a lab coat, but scripted actors that accept updates and are willing to sign on for a need-to-know basis that start to behave and support the notion that real things are happening because they agree to stick to a limited spectrum of debate, to argue very vigorously about certain questions and ignore others.

20:09.195 --> 20:11.017
The Joe Rogan Experience.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.742
Join my day Joe Rogan podcast by night or day.

20:17.925 --> 20:18.966
Welcome, dude.

20:19.307 --> 20:20.048
Very nice to meet you.

20:20.088 --> 20:20.688
Good to be here, man.

20:21.129 --> 20:23.051
So let's take first of all.

20:23.979 --> 20:25.401
Why do we love conspiracy so much?

20:25.441 --> 20:26.642
Cause I fucking love them.

20:26.922 --> 20:27.443
I love them.

20:27.623 --> 20:34.811
I love finding out the dirty little tactics and secrets and how the government does things and what the fuck's really going on.

20:35.171 --> 20:36.032
Why is it so exciting?

20:36.533 --> 20:39.776
I think it's something like deep down in humanity is like, we love storytelling.

20:39.956 --> 20:40.157
Yeah.

20:40.297 --> 20:43.480
And, and these, so what this is, is an audition.

20:44.261 --> 20:55.655
Remember that Ian Carroll had been on TikTok for a very long time with his mustache talking shit and very popular and very viral on X for the entire pandemic.

20:56.913 --> 21:01.634
Um, and he's a big Epstein dude and whatever, but he was only on Joe Rogan in March of 2025.

21:01.714 --> 21:09.716
These days, conspiracy theories are like we, I mean, 10 years ago, conspiracy theories were fringe and they were problematic.

21:09.756 --> 21:10.397
Tell me about it.

21:10.457 --> 21:10.677
Right.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.978
I was a conspiracy theorist way back in the day when you were a fucking nut.

21:15.018 --> 21:16.018
You're a conspiracy theorist.

21:16.038 --> 21:23.120
When I was not even here yet, I was arguing with people about the moon landing on the radio before the fucking, before there was any podcasts.

21:23.300 --> 21:31.626
I mean, I maybe there's some of the mystery element, but the thing is that so many of them are it's it's a knowledge It's a thirst for knowledge because some of them are of total bullshit.

21:32.026 --> 21:35.308
Yes, some of them are clearly there's something there clear, right?

21:35.428 --> 21:46.716
Yeah, and realistically if you had like the journalists of integrity from 1960s era Alive today and they hadn't been bought out and shot in the head and whatever else happened, dude They would be in the 60s.

21:46.756 --> 21:48.657
They were compromised while they were getting bought out.

21:48.677 --> 21:48.697
I

21:48.917 --> 22:06.605
the big one is woodward with the watergate story oh yeah did you see bill murray when i had bill murray in here i haven't watched it yet no bob woodward wrote wired which is about john belushi bill murray read five pages of it and he said holy shit they framed nixon

22:07.745 --> 22:12.168
He said the Bob Woodward story about Belushi was so full of shit.

22:12.769 --> 22:17.693
It was so exaggerated and fake and just filled with nonsense.

22:17.973 --> 22:29.162
He's like... So they're ready to accept a completely different narrative about John Belushi and the idea that somebody wrote a completely ridiculous narrative about him.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.684
They're totally willing to accept that.

22:31.704 --> 22:34.406
Uh-oh.

22:35.847 --> 22:37.048
We may have a problem.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.292
John Belushi was a lightweight.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.934
He goes, John Belushi would drink three beers and he'd be drunk.

22:42.714 --> 22:46.415
He goes, he was probably the first speedball he ever took and died from it.

22:46.475 --> 22:52.978
Like this whole thing about him being this raving drug-fueled maniac was totally fabricated.

22:54.078 --> 22:58.340
It's a good example of how the mainstream narrative had Nixon as a crook.

22:58.360 --> 23:04.943
Joe Rogan podcast, check it out.

23:06.650 --> 23:12.197
The Joe Rogan Experience.

23:14.080 --> 23:14.761
Sorry about that.

23:14.781 --> 23:15.762
I'll just let it play.

23:16.243 --> 23:17.524
Dude, very nice to meet you.

23:17.544 --> 23:18.145
Good to be here, man.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.508
So let's take first of all.

23:21.437 --> 23:22.838
Why do we love conspiracy so much?

23:22.878 --> 23:24.119
Cause I fucking love them.

23:24.379 --> 23:24.899
I love them.

23:25.079 --> 23:32.023
I love finding out the dirty little tactics and secrets and how the government does things and what the fuck's really going on.

23:32.043 --> 23:38.327
One thing I noticed just now is that he's a lot, Ian is a lot skinnier in March of 2025 than he is now.

23:39.047 --> 23:41.729
So I guess at some point, if they picked him up,

23:42.529 --> 23:48.350
onto the team, they had to get him on a little testosterone and get him lifting weights.

23:49.851 --> 23:50.711
Why is it so exciting?

23:51.211 --> 23:53.592
I think it's something deep down in humanity.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.452
We love storytelling.

23:54.972 --> 24:01.814
And these days, conspiracy theories are like... I mean, 10 years ago, conspiracy theories were fringe and they were

24:02.614 --> 24:25.115
problematic tell me about it right i was a conspiracy theorist way back in the day when you were a fucking nut you're a conspiracy theorist when i was not even here yet i was arguing people about the moon landing on the radio before the fucking before there was any podcasts i mean i maybe there's some of the mystery element but the thing is that so many of them are it's it's a knowledge it's a thirst for knowledge because some of them are total bullshit

24:25.715 --> 24:28.817
Some of them are clearly there's something there clear, right?

24:28.917 --> 24:38.904
Yeah, and realistically if you had like the journalists of integrity from 1960s era Alive today and they hadn't been bought out and shot in the head and whatever else happened, dude.

24:38.924 --> 24:42.206
They would be in the 60s They were compromised while they were getting out.

24:42.426 --> 24:46.528
The big one is Woodward with the Watergate story.

24:46.889 --> 24:47.329
Oh, yeah

24:47.509 --> 24:49.912
Did you see Bill Murray when I had Bill Murray in here the other day?

24:49.932 --> 24:50.773
I haven't watched it yet, no.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.176
Bob Woodward wrote Wired, which is about John Belushi.

24:54.597 --> 25:00.102
Bill Murray read five pages of it, and he said, holy shit, they framed Nixon.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.681
He said the Bob Woodward story about Belushi was so full of shit.

25:06.262 --> 25:11.183
It was so exaggerated and fake and just filled with nonsense.

25:11.483 --> 25:13.684
He's like, John Belushi was a lightweight.

25:13.924 --> 25:16.325
He goes, John Belushi would drink three beers and he'd be drunk.

25:17.105 --> 25:20.786
He goes, he was probably the first speedball he ever took and he died from it.

25:20.866 --> 25:27.088
Like this whole thing about him being this raving drug-fueled maniac was totally fabricated.

25:28.208 --> 25:36.092
It's a good example of how the mainstream narrative had Nixon as a crook, and he's just one of many examples, right?

25:36.212 --> 25:42.955
And when you really start to look into it, you realize, I mean, probably not the greatest guy, but what was the real story there?

25:42.995 --> 25:43.755
What were they framing?

25:43.775 --> 25:44.976
Why were they trying to get him out?

25:45.296 --> 25:47.157
Yeah, this is not a defense of Nixon.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.358
Nixon was not a great guy.

25:48.878 --> 25:54.681
But Tucker thinks that Nixon knew too much about the JFK assassination and wanted to talk about it.

25:55.381 --> 25:58.783
And he started saying, I know who killed JFK.

25:58.883 --> 26:00.103
And he started yapping.

26:00.203 --> 26:02.465
And they were like, let's get this motherfucker out of here.

26:02.785 --> 26:08.848
And also, one of the terms that he had agreed to run for president was General Ford.

26:09.488 --> 26:10.909
Who was on the fucking Warren Commission?

26:11.350 --> 26:13.332
Gerald Ford as his VP.

26:13.712 --> 26:17.256
So Gerald Ford becomes the first ever non-elected president.

26:17.656 --> 26:21.880
He slips in, he becomes president for kind of a bullshit term.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.063
He does a whole bunch of war party things and just a whole bunch of bullshit.

26:25.103 --> 26:28.166
And we decide that Nixon was the real problem with the country.

26:28.166 --> 26:37.331
I mean, how often is it that they're allowing someone that they aren't sure about to get to president, and they're sticking them with a VP that is their guy, right?

26:37.451 --> 26:38.251
Oh yeah, Dick Cheney.

26:38.271 --> 26:40.132
Like LBJ with JFK.

26:40.292 --> 26:42.093
Dick Cheney.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.254
Dick Cheney.

26:43.334 --> 26:44.735
Mike Pence.

26:44.755 --> 26:46.716
I don't know what the hell to think about Mike Pence.

26:46.756 --> 26:47.056
I have no idea.

26:47.096 --> 26:47.696
Pence is like a preacher.

26:47.716 --> 26:49.997
I think he was good to get the fucking religious people.

26:50.017 --> 26:52.098
Just a super rhino, super like, yeah.

26:52.138 --> 26:52.739
Weird guy.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.463
I mean Trump is a weird guy to like who knows what's going on with Trump right now.

26:56.503 --> 26:58.725
He's an animal Yeah, he's the most fun.

26:59.526 --> 27:12.522
I love conspiracy theories because people get so riled up and it's so partisan and political but within it there's all this like juicy like meat for For thinking about it's like not even conspiracy theories.

27:12.562 --> 27:13.663
It's just like his history and

27:14.183 --> 27:20.671
And especially with the Epstein stuff now and his history with Epstein, it just gets me so interested in, you'll never know the real story.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.274
But here's the thing about theories and stuff.

27:23.574 --> 27:31.764
There's so many things that are so weird that you would think, wait a minute, well this can't be real, this is fake.

27:31.984 --> 27:32.184
Yup.

27:32.865 --> 27:42.091
And and then it's connected to real life events in some sort of a way that you would think there's a conspiracy Like here's the one of my favorites is a little baron trump's.

27:42.452 --> 27:42.992
Yeah, dude.

27:43.032 --> 27:43.913
I just got the book.

27:43.973 --> 27:45.814
It just came in the mail Have you read it?

27:46.114 --> 27:46.675
No, dude.

27:46.715 --> 27:47.275
I'm gonna read it.

27:47.375 --> 27:47.935
I just got it.

27:48.015 --> 27:49.797
I should buy it I should buy the book before it gets bought.

27:49.837 --> 28:01.385
I got it in a three-part series that so that was That was just an advertisement for baron trump's book that wasn't anything else but an advertisement that they kind of improvised through

28:02.276 --> 28:03.717
Joe Rogan cued it off.

28:04.177 --> 28:05.378
He said he just got it.

28:05.478 --> 28:06.118
I haven't read it.

28:06.278 --> 28:07.499
I'm totally gonna read it.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.781
That's what you're seeing here.

28:11.321 --> 28:12.762
They're practicing.

28:12.822 --> 28:17.605
They're testing how well he can bounce things off.

28:17.685 --> 28:27.851
Now, the thing to realize about improv, if you've never done any theater or you've never worked at a theater-based high school like I have and known people in theater and whatever,

28:29.113 --> 28:36.859
You might not understand the basic rule, the number one of improv, but the basic rule number one of improv is to say yes, not no.

28:38.580 --> 28:38.941
And so.

28:41.559 --> 28:49.283
You can hear it when they're doing it because they will agree with each other before they know for sure what they're agreeing about.

28:49.323 --> 28:52.625
Again, because they're following the rule of improv that you always agree.

28:52.645 --> 28:59.469
You don't disagree because that disagreeing, saying no can often end it unless the other actor is very good.

28:59.589 --> 29:03.171
As the Baron Trump one, and then the last president, and there's one other one.

29:03.331 --> 29:08.394
And then how about the Wernher von Braun one about a guy named Elon that takes us to Mars.

29:08.935 --> 29:13.077
Wernher von Braun, the fucking Nazi who ran, you know, the operation.

29:13.117 --> 29:30.668
The one thing that I like about Wernher von Braun is that for whatever reason, I remember very distinctly being told by John Baldwin that he has a photograph of his dad and Wernher von Braun.

29:33.453 --> 29:39.699
I could be completely Looney Tunes but I sure remember him bragging about that more than once actually.

29:53.231 --> 30:00.876
Like you would think there's no way simultaneous to us kind of getting like some version of UAP disclosure that implies time travel.

30:01.036 --> 30:01.336
Yeah.

30:01.376 --> 30:02.977
Which is like, Lord knows what that is.

30:03.338 --> 30:03.478
Right.

30:03.498 --> 30:07.720
It's just so fun to speculate because it's like, how would we know?

30:07.940 --> 30:08.261
Yeah.

30:08.401 --> 30:09.241
How would we know?

30:09.481 --> 30:13.464
And the whole UAP thing, boy, he's listed.

30:13.484 --> 30:21.589
Ian Carroll is listed as a researcher, an entrepreneur in the description of this podcast.

30:24.437 --> 30:26.158
I do have a reason for playing this.

30:26.178 --> 30:28.059
We're not going to listen to this segment much longer.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.661
You want to find a cauldron of bullshit.

30:30.681 --> 30:32.122
That's the cauldron.

30:32.142 --> 30:35.063
Do you know who's got the best take on it?

30:35.083 --> 30:36.784
It's Jacques Vallée.

30:37.505 --> 30:41.287
I'm in the middle of my third book of his right now.

30:41.767 --> 30:43.448
I'll tell you what it's called.

30:43.768 --> 30:44.569
Yeah, I should read some.

30:45.309 --> 30:49.410
He's the best why do you say how bright was your phone?

30:49.510 --> 31:04.475
Holy crap this one confrontation look at how bright is Human interactions that have been documented with some sort of an invader from some other dimension or planet or whatever the fuck it is he

31:05.974 --> 31:07.535
is the most rational.

31:07.935 --> 31:09.557
He's the most analytical.

31:09.657 --> 31:13.980
He's the least likely to buy into horseshit, but not dismissive.

31:14.060 --> 31:16.261
That's like the critical balance, right?

31:16.301 --> 31:16.601
Yes.

31:16.721 --> 31:21.945
Well, he's the guy that they modeled the French scientist in Close Encounters of the Third Kind after.

31:22.425 --> 31:26.348
So he's been in this game since the 60s investigating these things.

31:26.448 --> 31:29.070
And time in the game counts for a ton.

31:29.110 --> 31:29.871
It counts for so much.

31:29.931 --> 31:34.515
And that's my greatest weakness in a lot of ways, among several, is that I'm just really new to the game.

31:34.535 --> 31:45.065
And so I'm constantly like catching up on shit and as stuff breaks, like like Pambondy, for example, I have no history on who Pambondy is because I wasn't paying attention when Pambondy was in Florida.

31:45.385 --> 31:47.788
And so I'm having to like play catch up on what was going on.

31:48.568 --> 31:50.229
And the people that have been here for forever.

31:50.469 --> 31:51.669
That's not playing catch-up.

31:51.729 --> 31:54.631
Playing catch-up is what went on during the Clinton administration.

31:54.691 --> 31:57.172
Playing catch-up is what happened during the 9-11.

31:57.692 --> 31:59.893
Playing catch-up is what happened before 9-11.

32:00.433 --> 32:03.834
That's all history that this dipshit doesn't know anything about either.

32:07.856 --> 32:10.777
Not paying attention to when Pam Bondi was in Florida.

32:10.837 --> 32:13.638
He wasn't doing anything until he got recruited.

32:13.939 --> 32:14.719
That's the point.

32:15.379 --> 32:17.240
He's an actor on a script.

32:19.964 --> 32:26.893
the Alex Joneses of this world, the Jacques Valets, the people that watch things break live, you just get a different level of context.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.537
And then you get the David Ikes that are like,

32:33.533 --> 32:34.694
It's fucking reptiles, dude.

32:34.714 --> 32:35.756
They're all reptiles.

32:36.356 --> 32:39.240
David, have you seen David coming after me on Twitter recently?

32:39.280 --> 32:40.441
He came after me too.

32:40.501 --> 32:43.024
He said I make fun of the reptile thing.

32:43.104 --> 32:44.786
And it's like, why won't you have me on?

32:45.026 --> 32:46.748
I genuinely really appreciate it.

32:46.788 --> 32:47.629
It's like a good time.

32:48.170 --> 32:49.492
But it's like maybe there are reptiles.

32:49.532 --> 32:50.072
I don't know, man.

32:50.092 --> 32:52.775
He went too far in a time where there was no internet.

32:52.936 --> 32:53.156
Yeah.

32:53.396 --> 32:54.457
You know, he went too far.

32:54.477 --> 32:55.959
You get too certain of yourself, right?

32:56.059 --> 32:58.622
You think you have the answers and you just keep going?

32:58.782 --> 32:59.844
A little bit of a grift.

33:00.064 --> 33:00.244
Yeah.

33:00.384 --> 33:01.285
With some of these folks.

33:01.345 --> 33:09.695
I'm not saying necessarily him, but it's... But he's not grifting when he takes $250 million contracts for this work.

33:10.076 --> 33:10.937
He's not grifting.

33:11.721 --> 33:18.149
He's not grifting when he scripts in some little improv nod to Donald Trump's son's book.

33:18.189 --> 33:19.570
He's not grifting at all.

33:19.871 --> 33:27.620
No, no, none of these people are grifting by them saying that Ike is a little bit of a grifter.

33:27.980 --> 33:30.203
It almost makes these guys seem like normal.

33:31.035 --> 33:32.155
It's a little bit of a grift.

33:32.296 --> 33:35.497
Well, it's an easy temptation to fall into, especially with the internet.

33:35.537 --> 33:43.320
Like every single day, people in my position, I mean, people in your position too, like we have- People in Joe Rogan's position?

33:43.380 --> 33:45.081
Who's in Joe Rogan's position?

33:45.581 --> 33:55.285
Who's in his position getting falsely promoted by social media because they have a military operation?

33:55.905 --> 33:59.547
What are they talking about other than trying to create an illusion?

34:01.380 --> 34:03.382
They are creating an illusion.

34:05.583 --> 34:08.325
They are some of the worst actors on the internet.

34:08.465 --> 34:15.151
The ability to just like, I'm going to get views and money if I drop deep down this grift, but a lot of them are not like a lot of them.

34:15.171 --> 34:17.993
When you look into them, you realize, oh, there's like literally nothing there.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.581
There's a bunch of stuff that's clickbait horseshit, for sure.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.362
Or at least there's probably nothing there.

34:23.882 --> 34:27.504
I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea of quantum computing.

34:27.604 --> 34:31.465
It's exciting, but complex and difficult to understand.

34:31.505 --> 34:38.908
What I do know is that quantum computers can process exponentially more data than the ones you and I use every day.

34:39.128 --> 34:45.031
And so I just want you to hear after the ExpressVPN announcement or whatever this is,

34:46.572 --> 34:49.073
what they say, and then we'll go on to the next clip.

34:49.093 --> 34:50.434
We currently consider secure.

34:50.934 --> 35:02.462
That's why ExpressVPN upgraded their encryption to use MLKEM, the strongest available protection from post quantum threats.

35:02.742 --> 35:09.026
With ExpressVPN, all your online activity is rerouted through secure encrypted servers.

35:09.566 --> 35:27.011
even though all your data is still being handled by your internet provider or whoever the provider is for the random public Wi-Fi network you're on, none of these third parties will be able to read your data or hijack your connection for proofing your XyExpressVP.

35:27.071 --> 35:34.093
If you want to get the highest the banner or extra months for watching on you clicking the link, you know the story that in the description.

35:34.713 --> 35:41.038
The one that I just recently kind of was reminded of is, you know, the story that that Disney sent kids to Epstein Island?

35:41.999 --> 35:45.662
Yeah, it's like a perfect, like, oh, such a money conspiracy.

35:45.702 --> 35:46.542
Yeah, it's not true.

35:46.642 --> 35:51.406
That's it's when you look it up, you realize that that I mean, a lot of the information is kind of gone.

35:51.446 --> 35:54.889
It's hard to even tell if it's legitimate websites and information, which is already a red flag.

35:54.949 --> 36:01.734
But the ones that are still up, they just sent them into like the like they were going on cruises that happened to be in the vicinity of the island.

36:01.754 --> 36:02.755
That's totally different.

36:02.955 --> 36:05.716
which is a very popular vacation destination.

36:05.856 --> 36:06.036
Yeah.

36:06.136 --> 36:07.436
And so it becomes this leak.

36:07.597 --> 36:09.897
And and that's kind of I think that's the fun part of the game.

36:09.977 --> 36:11.138
We thought about buying the island.

36:11.438 --> 36:13.799
Dude, the island was for sale.

36:13.819 --> 36:15.019
We talked about for a second.

36:15.559 --> 36:18.180
Let's put some of that Spotify money to use.

36:18.220 --> 36:18.880
They'll be funny.

36:19.100 --> 36:26.602
I think they would let's put some of that Spotify money to use, you know, before the pandemic, he signed a $200 million contract in 2024.

36:26.803 --> 36:30.404
He signed a new contract for $250 million.

36:30.444 --> 36:38.426
So I don't know how much money he's got, but I, I think it's probably a metric shit ton and he doesn't need it.

36:40.950 --> 36:41.990
But he's not a grifter.

36:42.711 --> 36:46.132
He's actually just the guy that gets people to pay for their Spotify.

36:46.593 --> 36:50.854
And he's the guy who sells a lot of, you know, he's, he's, he's a great advertiser.

36:50.914 --> 36:51.995
That's why he's so rich.

36:52.855 --> 36:59.718
And he's such a great conversationalist that Spotify can pay him almost a half a million, half a billion dollars.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.819
You know, that makes total sense.

37:02.580 --> 37:03.820
He's not a liar.

37:04.741 --> 37:05.241
Come on.

37:07.304 --> 37:09.385
He just works a lot harder than you.

37:29.079 --> 37:30.180
What's under the dirt?

37:30.260 --> 37:32.001
I'd scan the fucking floors.

37:32.201 --> 37:32.962
I would light.

37:33.362 --> 37:36.905
It's probably all buildings with unfinished drywall.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.147
That's how fricking stupid this is.

37:39.627 --> 37:40.248
Ocean floor.

37:42.410 --> 37:44.311
Come on, come on, you can do it.

37:47.674 --> 37:48.014
Darn it.

37:48.034 --> 37:50.056
OK, I'll figure out where we are, though.

37:51.557 --> 37:52.437
Come on, sweetheart.

37:53.758 --> 37:54.419
You can do it.

37:57.481 --> 37:58.002
Weird thing.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.121
Yeah, I should read some.

38:07.841 --> 38:09.202
He's the best.

38:09.322 --> 38:13.645
He kind of was reminded of is, you know, the story that that Disney sent kids.

38:13.665 --> 38:14.745
Oh, maybe that's where I ended it.

38:14.926 --> 38:15.226
Sorry.

38:15.506 --> 38:19.168
Yeah, it's like a perfect like, oh, such a money conspiracy.

38:19.188 --> 38:20.029
Yeah, it's not true.

38:20.189 --> 38:21.310
It's on that island.

38:21.370 --> 38:22.030
It's incriminating.

38:22.090 --> 38:23.051
And also, what?

38:23.071 --> 38:24.031
Oh, yeah, that's where I ended it.

38:24.152 --> 38:25.092
OK, so here we go.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.915
Second, when you shoot things, but some things are super consistent.

38:29.275 --> 38:33.838
And one thing that's super consistent is when you hit something, it goes in the direction that you hit it.

38:33.918 --> 38:34.078
Right.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.199
So, back and to the left.

38:36.699 --> 38:38.120
Hicks used to talk about that all the time.

38:38.140 --> 38:38.900
Back and to the left.

38:39.760 --> 38:44.703
Make it fun of the fact that the Zapruder film clearly showed that it wasn't a shot from the back.

38:45.303 --> 38:47.284
But the head goes spray, too.

38:47.304 --> 38:49.525
It goes spray like this, back and to the left.

38:49.745 --> 38:50.225
Can we see it?

38:50.965 --> 38:51.666
Let's see it real quick.

38:51.706 --> 38:59.669
Yeah, something I love about the JFK story is that there are so many deep experts that have really done the dig, and they don't all come to the same conclusions.

38:59.689 --> 39:00.890
Well, here's the thing about Lifton's book.

39:00.910 --> 39:03.011
He also documents how many witnesses were murdered.

39:03.939 --> 39:04.699
And it's astounding.

39:04.719 --> 39:07.261
That's the, that's the part that often gets left off too.

39:07.301 --> 39:15.885
Their cars got parked on railroad tracks and they died of heart attacks when they were 30 and they got fucking shot in a robbery and they committed suicide.

39:15.945 --> 39:18.106
The gas, they fell asleep in their car.

39:18.126 --> 39:19.967
Man, Hillary Clinton sure got started early.

39:20.027 --> 39:20.907
Yeah.

39:22.748 --> 39:23.828
Back into the left.

39:24.889 --> 39:25.349
Watch this.

39:25.989 --> 39:26.410
Watch this.

39:26.590 --> 39:27.410
The explosion.

39:28.230 --> 39:28.371
Yeah.

39:28.391 --> 39:29.331
Cause he's already hitting the neck.

39:31.257 --> 39:31.957
You're totally right.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.938
It's like a cloud, right?

39:34.178 --> 39:36.139
I mean, it could be that.

39:36.439 --> 39:43.883
Are these two clowns really watching footage that Jamie has pulled up from the internet and going, oh, wow.

39:43.923 --> 39:44.823
Yeah, you're right.

39:44.943 --> 39:45.423
Wow.

39:46.104 --> 39:46.664
Crazy.

39:47.264 --> 39:52.987
Are they really working on their fine tuning of their understanding of this historical event now live?

39:53.467 --> 39:55.548
Because that's absolutely absurd.

39:55.688 --> 39:58.049
The top of his head exploded right there.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.590
And the force drives him back.

40:02.017 --> 40:15.588
It also could, there's another possibility, and the possibility is spontaneous nerve reaction of your body shutting down, which could cause you to go back and to the left, even if you get shot in the front.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.629
Back and to the left.

40:17.950 --> 40:19.451
Which could cause shutting down.

40:20.471 --> 40:24.835
Spontaneous nerve reaction of your body shutting down.

40:25.355 --> 40:27.137
Weird things happen when you shoot things.

40:28.601 --> 40:29.622
back into the left.

40:41.658 --> 40:44.400
It also could, there is, there's another possibility.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.642
And the possibility is, and they got fucking shot in a Lifton's book.

40:48.682 --> 40:54.246
He also documents that all the road track, a fucking car, man, Hillary Clinton sure got started early.

40:54.306 --> 40:55.126
Yeah.

40:55.767 --> 40:57.267
Why am I got my mouth open?

40:57.307 --> 41:01.110
Because that's what Charlie Kirk did when he was shot.

41:02.951 --> 41:06.313
He went back into the left with some hands up like this.

41:07.392 --> 41:15.597
And Joe Rogan in March of 2025 is gonna talk about that in reference to JFK with this jackass?

41:16.458 --> 41:17.499
And really?

41:18.559 --> 41:18.839
Really?

41:18.859 --> 41:22.342
Oh my gosh.

41:22.642 --> 41:26.404
I'm a little annoyed here.

41:27.425 --> 41:27.885
Watch this.

41:28.526 --> 41:29.967
Watch this, the explosion.

41:30.747 --> 41:31.868
Yeah, cause he's already hitting the neck.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.500
You're totally right.

41:34.581 --> 41:36.462
It's like a cloud in the front, right?

41:36.722 --> 41:43.686
I mean, it could be that the top of his head exploded right there, and the force drives him back.

41:45.067 --> 41:58.656
It also could, there's another possibility, and the possibility is spontaneous nerve reaction of your body shutting down, which could cause you to go back and to the left, even if you get shot in the front.

41:59.296 --> 42:01.798
But the thing is, the spray

42:03.503 --> 42:07.224
or if you get shot in the back rather, the spray looks like it's going forward.

42:07.585 --> 42:09.125
Like we'll watch when he gets hit.

42:10.386 --> 42:10.766
See that?

42:11.166 --> 42:11.386
Yep.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.167
It's just weird.

42:13.387 --> 42:26.752
But that could- Now if we fast forward to the shooting of Charlie Kirk, it turns out that Ian Carroll has decided to do some analysis of his own in his highly produced, very popular podcast.

42:26.772 --> 42:30.513
So I thought I'd watch a little bit of that quick and see if anything interesting happens there.

42:34.065 --> 42:39.829
a handgun round, time to cross a 100 foot field of view would be 83.3 milliseconds.

42:39.869 --> 42:44.452
So Patriot, look at this fake through which the bullet would pass.

42:45.192 --> 42:45.913
The bullet would appear.

42:45.953 --> 42:59.902
He's calculating whether or not they could find the bullet in any of these, these films and deciding, you know, what frame rate you need to catch what size or what speed of bullet, which is already retarded.

43:01.320 --> 43:07.586
And then he's going to make an admission, which means that he's nothing but Team Robert Malone.

43:07.626 --> 43:13.111
That it's against a dark background with enough light bouncing off of it that you can see the bullet against its background.

43:13.192 --> 43:20.238
And in this case, both frames that we have the bullet appearing in, it's against Charlie's black pants in the light ladder frame.

43:20.559 --> 43:23.722
And in the frame before it impacts, it's against a man with a black shirt.

43:26.860 --> 43:29.661
We would expect it in three to five consecutive frames.

43:29.982 --> 43:38.045
And we see it in like one frame behind him, one frame on impact, maybe a frame inside of his neck and a frame coming down past his knee.

43:40.026 --> 43:40.247
Right?

43:40.267 --> 43:43.108
Like that kind of lines up.

43:45.629 --> 44:00.915
He's saying that he was shot from behind and that we have footage of the bullets, which is just so retarded, I can't- So, as a general rule of thumb, anytime that someone gets shot in public in America and it's a big conspiracy and it seems like we're being lied to, it's probably worth following along with John Cullen.

44:01.345 --> 44:07.588
He broke a whole bunch of stuff while I was in Las Vegas shooting.

44:07.708 --> 44:09.348
And he certainly did get involved in this.

44:10.069 --> 44:12.389
It's going to be a bit of a pain.

44:12.870 --> 44:14.070
I'm going to ask online.

44:14.350 --> 44:17.311
He said John Cullen's name.

44:17.572 --> 44:20.793
Inside of his neck and a frame coming down past his knee.

44:22.794 --> 44:23.234
Right, like.

44:24.815 --> 44:25.875
That kind of lines up.

44:28.570 --> 44:38.307
So, as a general rule of thumb, anytime that someone gets shot in public in America and it's a big conspiracy and it seems like we're being lied to, it's probably worth following along with John Cullen.

44:38.740 --> 44:42.263
he broke a whole bunch of the stuff wide open about the Las Vegas shooting.

44:42.743 --> 44:50.529
What this means is that Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:50.849 --> 45:05.381
and Steve Bannon and Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey and George Webb and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Nick Hudson and

45:06.161 --> 45:22.847
and Jessica Hockett and Jessica Rose and all of these people all the way down to John Goodman and freaking Paul Cuttrell are all one great big shit cast working for the National Security State of America.

45:23.887 --> 45:26.888
That's my best estimation, probably the State Department.

45:29.486 --> 45:36.013
or affiliated organizations, funded organizations, who knows, maybe even USAID paid for some of them.

45:36.474 --> 45:44.683
The fact that he is promoting John Cullen is an admission that he's on the same team as George Webb, as Jane Ruby,

45:45.403 --> 45:54.430
As the Breggans, as CHD, and ICAN, and that fraud Pauly Tommy, and that fraud Andrew Wakefield.

45:54.850 --> 45:59.813
It's all one malevolent shitshow, and he was just recruited a little later.

45:59.873 --> 46:00.474
That's all.

46:06.318 --> 46:08.439
It's all one malevolent shitshow.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.822
These people are all part of the same scam.

46:13.820 --> 46:20.203
All of them, all these people around the world down here on the bottom, absolute monsters.

46:20.723 --> 46:23.224
The next row, scripted monsters.

46:23.304 --> 46:25.845
The next row, shameless actors.

46:26.426 --> 46:33.989
And the row after that, people who are in the club and for whom money doesn't really matter anymore.

46:36.334 --> 46:38.716
No one else has gotten this far, ladies and gentlemen.

46:38.816 --> 46:42.298
No one else has gotten this far.

46:42.378 --> 46:44.079
Just make sure you realize that.

47:07.523 --> 47:12.747
I am I am I am to you I am I am I am to you

47:48.281 --> 47:51.584
I want my MTV.

48:24.487 --> 48:34.134
Look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it

48:53.652 --> 49:17.787
Play the guitar on the MTV That ain't working, that's the way you do it Money for nothing and your cheeks are free Now that ain't working, that's the way you do it Let me tell you, damn guys ain't dumb Maybe get a pistol on your little finger Maybe get a blister on your thumb

49:18.697 --> 49:25.551
We've got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries.

49:25.671 --> 49:28.076
We've got to move these refrigerators.

49:28.116 --> 49:30.060
We've got to move these refrigerators.

49:42.432 --> 49:46.656
Yeah, the little faggot got his own jet airplane.

49:47.116 --> 49:49.719
The little faggot, he's a millionaire.

49:50.680 --> 49:57.806
We got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries.

49:57.887 --> 50:00.249
We got to move the refrigerator.

50:00.529 --> 50:03.692
We got to move these color TVs.

50:32.356 --> 50:51.444
I shoulda learned to play the guitar I shoulda learned to play them drums Look at that momma, she's got it stickin' in the camera man

50:54.696 --> 50:55.416
And he's up there.

50:55.857 --> 50:56.277
What's that?

50:56.677 --> 50:57.597
Hawaiian noises.

50:57.657 --> 51:00.879
He's banging on them bongos like it's his best.

51:01.599 --> 51:02.519
Oh, that ain't working.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.060
That's the way you do it.

51:05.141 --> 51:06.901
Get your money for nothing.

51:06.941 --> 51:08.322
Get your chicks for free.

51:09.402 --> 51:12.304
We've got to install a microwave oven.

51:13.164 --> 51:16.025
Custom kitchen deliveries.

51:16.545 --> 51:19.487
We've got to move these refrigerators.

51:20.067 --> 51:22.468
We've got to move these color TVs.

51:39.858 --> 52:02.963
Listen here, now, that ain't workin' That's the way you do it You play the guitar on your MTV That ain't workin' That's the way you do it Money for nothin' and your chicks for free Money for nothin' Chicks for free Money for nothin'

Money for nothing Chicks for free Money for nothing Chicks for free Money money money for nothing Chicks for free

52:51.155 --> 52:51.969
Look at that, look at that.

53:20.954 --> 53:24.639
Easy, easy money Easy, easy chicks for free Easy, easy money

53:56.590 --> 53:59.755
It is imperative that we unlearn Biology 101.

54:00.476 --> 54:03.741
It's imperative that we understand the trap that we are in.

54:04.362 --> 54:06.605
Ladies and gentlemen, if you fell for this...

54:07.734 --> 54:25.009
If you fell for the anti-vaxx movement, the health freedom movement, any of these people like Brian Hooker, Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or Del Bigtree, or Pauly Tommy, or Andrew Wakefield, at any point in time, if you fell for these people during the pandemic, you're not alone.

54:25.690 --> 54:26.650
It's not your fault.

54:27.271 --> 54:29.373
They are part of a military operation.

54:29.973 --> 54:33.134
But the trap is closing very, very quickly.

54:33.154 --> 54:38.176
I want you to feel how quickly it's closing with this next video.

54:38.236 --> 54:39.016
It's not good.

54:49.299 --> 54:58.502
So, first of all, by a show of hands, how many of you in the audience think that there's a link between vaccines and autism?

55:00.740 --> 55:00.920
Wow.

55:00.940 --> 55:01.480
About 23 of you.

55:01.500 --> 55:01.600
Wow.

55:01.700 --> 55:02.060
Interesting.

55:02.120 --> 55:06.102
And how many of you don't believe there is a link?

55:06.142 --> 55:06.382
Hands up.

55:23.618 --> 55:24.519
About 18.

55:25.239 --> 55:26.340
So that's amazing.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.162
I'm glad that we have this kind of mix in the audience here tonight.

55:29.222 --> 55:30.563
This is what Penguin is all about.

55:30.964 --> 55:34.786
Getting us all together to have good faith helpful conversations.

55:35.487 --> 55:45.314
Now I don't know if they chose Dave because of the way he looks and because he's a short pudgy ugly guy with a big nose and black hair.

55:47.256 --> 55:48.157
He's an asshole.

55:49.395 --> 55:51.157
And he's a scripted asshole.

55:51.217 --> 55:52.018
That's the problem.

55:52.058 --> 56:13.697
He's a dick on purpose He's scripted to be kind of this extremely arrogant know-it-all and he's probably extremely good at memorizing things So that he can for example Maybe sit down and memorize 40 pages of facts and then for the next hour and a half be a dick recalling them but that skill is still just acting and

56:15.382 --> 56:32.529
And regardless of whether he applies his acting memorization skills to chemistry, or to biology, or to the facts of the central dogma, or to the vaccine schedule and the CDC lines on it, it doesn't make him smart.

56:32.589 --> 56:34.990
It makes him very good at memorizing things.

56:36.616 --> 56:51.815
And of course, those are the people that do very well in academic biology because so much of it is trying to catch up and understand what was already said and argued about and who did that, which is essentially remembering things.

56:51.975 --> 56:55.159
And the more you can remember, the more names you can remember.

56:55.632 --> 57:09.558
The more powerful you feel in a conversation, even though the concepts might be vapid, even though your understanding of the concepts might be vapid, somebody with an extreme memory can make it feel as though they really know what they're talking about.

57:09.598 --> 57:21.743
Another example is somebody like Peter McCullough, who spends a great deal of time talking about papers, and the way that he bamboozles you is that he tells you all the authors, as if that matters.

57:22.554 --> 57:30.018
but he'll refer to the paper as the McCullough and Rose paper from 2024 is not that dissimilar from the Corey McCullough paper.

57:30.439 --> 57:33.380
And so that kind of thing is an illusion.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.442
You don't need to remember anyone's names.

57:35.522 --> 57:47.389
If you can't remember that it was Max Delbruck who failed to solve all the problems of life using bacteria and bacteriophages after years of working together with the greatest minds in physics, that's okay.

57:47.729 --> 57:50.991
As long as you understand the concept that they didn't succeed.

57:52.273 --> 57:59.900
And in this case, what we are dealing with is at least one guy with a really good memory and scripted to be an absolute dickhead.

58:00.280 --> 58:13.691
And then this guy who's actually quite a bit less intelligent than Dave, but he is also really good, really good at being that kind of teaching assistant level dickhead.

58:14.412 --> 58:17.435
And so basically we have two teaching assistants,

58:18.428 --> 58:22.532
Um, who have been teaching the same stupid basic course for a very long time.

58:23.053 --> 58:31.582
This guy was scripted to go on the internet and teach courses on chemistry and organic chemistry and, and basic biology already many years before the pandemic.

58:31.622 --> 58:33.924
And there's no question that he was scripted to do it.

58:34.365 --> 58:35.486
He was scripted to do it.

58:35.526 --> 58:36.547
He was scripted to do it.

58:36.587 --> 58:39.410
There's no way that this guy is just an accident.

58:42.580 --> 58:46.702
So we've been at this for 10 years at Pangburn, producing events.

58:46.762 --> 58:51.804
We produced the four-part Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson series in 2017.

58:52.204 --> 58:55.325
If you guys haven't seen our recent God debate.

58:55.486 --> 58:58.927
The Jordan Sam Harris series.

59:02.409 --> 59:07.151
It's hard for me to imagine a series I would more or

59:09.119 --> 59:13.682
I would less like to see, like I can't even express how awful that sounds.

59:13.702 --> 59:20.065
Between Alex O'Connor and Dinesh D'Souza, that's one of my favorite debates we've ever produced.

59:20.465 --> 59:21.186
Check that one out.

59:21.366 --> 59:25.788
Also Dillahunty versus Jordan Peterson's fantastic discussion.

59:27.449 --> 59:34.693
So in our 10 years of operation, I'm not sure that we've ever produced a live discussion with stakes this high.

59:36.234 --> 59:38.055
There are people literally dying

59:39.033 --> 59:41.954
and living sick due to misinformation.

59:42.334 --> 59:49.115
Now, depending on who you ask, that misinformation exists on the other side.

59:50.335 --> 59:53.796
We have both sides represented here tonight.

59:54.536 --> 01:00:03.958
On the quote-unquote pro-vaccine side, we have Professor Dave Explains, Dave Farina, and Debunk the Funk, Dr. Dan Wilson.

01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:10.815
on the quote-unquote anti-vaccines.

01:00:11.436 --> 01:00:22.460
So Dan has a PhD from Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and I've done one stream with him and at the time I wasn't prepared.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:35.485
At the time I wasn't ready but I still cleaned the floor with him but now I think Dave and Debunk the Funk would have a really hard time with me but

01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:38.372
Just gonna spoil it for you.

01:00:38.773 --> 01:00:41.740
They're not gonna have a hard time with those two dipshits over there.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:01:01.760
The sad thing about this video is it looks like Pierre Cory is completely unaware that despite the $250,000 salary from a nonprofit and despite the book deal, he got taken by these people and now he's about to play the role of jackass.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:11.705
Can you imagine if these two guys knew that he was a medical, testifying medical witness to the George Floyd killing?

01:01:12.912 --> 01:01:13.872
Can you imagine?

01:01:13.892 --> 01:01:17.114
I mean, it's shocking right now.

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:20.255
We have Steve Kirsch and Dr. Pierre Corey.

01:01:26.977 --> 01:01:37.561
Like many of the labels that are grafted onto me by others, the debaters may reject these labels, but they do exist in the culture.

01:01:38.726 --> 01:01:41.908
As moderator tonight, my name's Travis Pangburn, by the way.

01:01:42.548 --> 01:01:47.651
As moderator tonight, I plan on saying as little as possible and simply allow the dialectic to flow.

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:55.155
At Pangburn, we always hope to produce a good faith, helpful, passionate discussion, even when the stakes seem dire.

01:01:56.295 --> 01:02:01.678
I will ask you, the audience, to please not interrupt these important exchanges.

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:03.379
Don Dunn here.

01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:08.082
Keep in mind, what this is supposed to be is apparently our two best

01:02:10.236 --> 01:02:15.001
Going up against their two mediocres, you know, everybody's good on that side.

01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:17.283
They all know, they all know the right answer.

01:02:17.343 --> 01:02:19.966
It's this side that really needs the good guy here.

01:02:20.026 --> 01:02:21.307
Who should we have had here?

01:02:21.748 --> 01:02:23.330
Maybe James Lyons-Weiler?

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.891
Maybe Mary Holland?

01:02:25.312 --> 01:02:26.373
How about Pauly Tommy?

01:02:26.393 --> 01:02:27.254
Would she have been good?

01:02:27.294 --> 01:02:28.555
How about Andrew Wakefield?

01:02:29.976 --> 01:02:31.518
Why do we have Pierre Cory?

01:02:32.475 --> 01:02:36.376
I think we have Pierre Corey because he's actually not a military actor.

01:02:36.416 --> 01:02:41.077
I think we have Steve Kirsch there because he's not actually a military actor.

01:02:41.137 --> 01:02:47.498
These guys are like recruited by the military actors.

01:02:47.678 --> 01:02:50.058
They were recruited by the operators.

01:02:50.338 --> 01:02:59.140
And so these guys are safe to put on stage for them to get their clock cleaned by these two guys because they don't have anything.

01:03:00.148 --> 01:03:03.532
They just have the big top tent of health freedom.

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:06.859
They just have what CHD has.

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:09.661
They just have what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:09.701 --> 01:03:09.961
has.

01:03:10.422 --> 01:03:14.725
And when you see how little they have, you will be shocked, right?

01:03:14.785 --> 01:03:19.208
Because this is supposed to be the vaccine debate to end all vaccine debates.

01:03:19.268 --> 01:03:22.010
And no, no one will use the word transfection even once.

01:03:22.691 --> 01:03:30.637
To my right, we'll be playing timekeeper to ensure each side has equal amount of time on each topic.

01:03:31.753 --> 01:03:34.736
Six topics have been agreed upon for tonight's discussion.

01:03:35.216 --> 01:03:38.820
The goal is to try to allow enough time for each topic.

01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:45.106
The side that doesn't get to start the topic will get the final words on that topic.

01:03:45.846 --> 01:03:48.349
The topic... Okay, I'll go along with Vilma.

01:03:48.489 --> 01:03:52.152
I think it's very possible because I don't think he invented the optic mouse.

01:03:52.373 --> 01:03:55.436
So Steve Kirsch very well could be an operator.

01:03:55.996 --> 01:03:58.617
Very similar level operator as Robert Malone.

01:03:58.657 --> 01:04:01.498
Very similar level operator as Elon Musk.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:04.739
Very similar operator level as Kevin McKernan.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:15.523
Although, admittedly, probably a lot less technically savvy, he's nonetheless kind of a fake person in a fake position with a fake level of some kind of authority.

01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:23.446
When in reality, he's just a guy that's been given a weaponized pile of money, and then he's just working with these jackasses to grift.

01:04:25.085 --> 01:04:29.008
He's the largest private donor to the DNC before the pandemic.

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:33.932
Yes, Steve Kirsch.

01:04:34.813 --> 01:04:37.375
Extremely professional liar.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:39.176
The topics are as follows.

01:04:39.757 --> 01:04:42.199
Number one, vaccines and autism.

01:04:42.739 --> 01:04:43.520
Is there a link?

01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:47.179
Number two, new measles outbreak.

01:04:47.219 --> 01:04:49.559
Of course, that's already a losing argument, right?

01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:55.121
Because vaccine is not a specific term and autism is a myth, but they're gonna debate it anyway.

01:04:57.342 --> 01:04:59.123
Is misinformation to blame?

01:05:00.243 --> 01:05:03.724
Number three, did the COVID vaccines save lives?

01:05:04.244 --> 01:05:07.346
And there's also a sub question to the third question.

01:05:07.806 --> 01:05:08.606
RFK Jr.

01:05:08.646 --> 01:05:11.987
pulls $500 million in funding for vaccine development.

01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:13.948
Is this good for the USA?

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:23.747
Number four, are kids better off being fully vaccinated according to the CDC vaccination schedule or fully unvaccinated?

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:29.929
Number five, should we eliminate liability protection for vaccine manufacturers?

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:34.912
And number six, is ivermectin effective against COVID-19?

01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:44.531
The speakers have provided five references per topic that everyone can have access to during this debate.

01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:50.575
You just need to go to pang- So they were given papers, so they exchanged papers, okay?

01:05:50.595 --> 01:05:52.536
So that's an important thing to say here.

01:05:55.779 --> 01:05:57.600
Because it establishes something, right?

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:03.504
Here are the papers that I want to use, here are the papers they want to use, and then they supposedly prepared, right?

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:06.246
I guarantee you that Dave prepared.

01:06:07.188 --> 01:06:18.374
I guarantee you that Dan prepared, so I sure hope Corey and Kirsch prepared.

01:06:20.075 --> 01:06:25.919
We are going to start with quick introductions and thoughts on tonight's debate before we jump into the first topic.

01:06:26.419 --> 01:06:27.700
Let's start with Dave and Dan.

01:06:31.903 --> 01:06:40.887
Okay, so it's... I cannot tell you how disheartening it is to hear so many people still falling for this vaccine's autism bullshit.

01:06:41.287 --> 01:06:49.530
It started with Andrew Wakefield in the 90s in the retracted Lancet study, and it's been a plague on mankind ever since.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.672
Now if we just stop here and we remind you that in the early 2000s, Pauly Tommy

01:06:57.955 --> 01:06:58.516
The hell is that?

01:06:58.596 --> 01:07:06.025
Polly Tommy was on billboards, over 90 billboards, bringing awareness to autism in the UK.

01:07:06.085 --> 01:07:10.350
Not trying to stop the vaccine schedule, but just bringing awareness to them.

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:18.099
Her model daughter actually was doing TED Talks about how there should be more job programs for kids with autism.

01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:22.920
And so we were not fighting a vaccine schedule.

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.921
We weren't exposing a vaccine schedule.

01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:33.345
Polly Tommy was in a newspaper at some point saying that her son was cured by secretin injections in 2005, three.

01:07:33.505 --> 01:07:40.609
I don't know when it happened, but all of that predates her work with Mary Holland and Brian Hooker from 2015 on in America.

01:07:43.783 --> 01:07:57.833
You know, when they started establishing ICANN and CHD and stepping in front of Brandy Vaughn, who had all kinds of billboards around the United States and was even getting coverage on Dateline in Australia about it.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.074
And that was in 2018.

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:06.903
And so yes, this has been a very long con.

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:14.747
It has been recycled and agents put in place with a story, and now they have ranches in Austin.

01:08:16.528 --> 01:08:18.889
And so he's 100% right about this.

01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:31.636
No matter how many studies are done, no matter how many hundreds of thousands or millions of children that are studied, where absolutely zero correlation is found,

01:08:32.805 --> 01:08:38.110
anti-vaxxers continue to push this myth which is absolutely insane and utterly unfounded.

01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:49.862
Not only is there zero data to support this link and a mountain of data disproving the link, it also just completely betrays any understanding of what autism even is.

01:08:50.383 --> 01:08:51.844
Autism is an inborn

01:08:52.725 --> 01:09:10.363
gene genetic based neurological condition you can't catch autism you can't and so what he's saying is is that vaccine injury can't cause autism by definition if autism is a genetic disorder and he's again not wrong if you give him that definition

01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:13.565
So here we are juggling like three balls, right?

01:09:13.585 --> 01:09:17.507
Because you're juggling whose definition are we using for autism?

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:18.787
Is it their definition?

01:09:19.267 --> 01:09:35.354
Or are we going to go to profound autism and not profound autism or other stupid nomenclature tricks that just simply walk around the elephant in the room, which is autism is a stupid word by design.

01:09:37.642 --> 01:09:43.124
and he accepts it, just argues about it in the way that those people don't want to argue about it.

01:09:43.204 --> 01:09:44.324
And it's amazing, right?

01:09:44.364 --> 01:09:48.605
Because Dr. Pierre Khoury is not going to be able to explain the nuance here.

01:09:49.026 --> 01:09:53.947
And certainly the egghead fake Steve Kirsch is not going to be able to explain it.

01:09:54.327 --> 01:09:55.228
Get autism.

01:09:55.528 --> 01:09:59.449
You are born autistic and then symptoms show up.

01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:03.051
And he has an autistic son, just so you know.

01:10:03.171 --> 01:10:21.706
So one of the reasons why I'm pretty sure he was recruited for this very operation and why he worked so damn hard over the last decade and a half to be a part of this operation is because his son has autism and he wants desperately to believe that he had nothing to do with it.

01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:29.913
People say, oh my God, it's the vaccine and it's just completely... Except the fact, of course, that he passed on the genes to his son.

01:10:32.075 --> 01:10:34.898
There's essentially nothing to discuss here.

01:10:34.938 --> 01:10:38.922
We're going to discuss it anyway, apparently, but that's how it is.

01:10:40.163 --> 01:10:41.384
All right.

01:10:41.424 --> 01:10:42.005
Thanks, Dave.

01:10:42.465 --> 01:10:43.026
Go ahead, Dan.

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:46.228
Yeah, that's what we're doing right now.

01:10:48.188 --> 01:10:49.648
Yep, I'll echo that.

01:10:50.489 --> 01:10:53.629
And just a general comment about this debate.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:11:00.571
I think that the evidence is very clear for what the right answers are for each of these topics.

01:11:01.312 --> 01:11:12.174
And to be on stage with two people who have profited so much and gained so much from saying the complete opposite of what the facts demonstrate is

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.240
frankly, just a little bit frustrating.

01:11:17.421 --> 01:11:25.402
But we are here to have a debate, and we are going to educate these two people who are anti-vaccine for your all entertainment.

01:11:25.942 --> 01:11:28.243
And I think you all should enjoy.

01:11:28.263 --> 01:11:32.444
That's Dan Wilson, debunk the funk, who I streamed with in 2021.

01:11:32.484 --> 01:11:32.804
2021, I think.

01:11:32.884 --> 01:11:33.364
Thanks, Dan.

01:11:33.384 --> 01:11:33.784
All right.

01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:39.501
Pierre, how about you?

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:53.649
He went on to have a new YouTube channel that was sponsored by some like, you know, publicity organization in Canada, you know, like some, you know, public health messaging organization.

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:54.269
He's a shithead.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:12:17.920
nice and hot on the mic pierre i think we already have the answer so and um he's actually a guy who worked for you know went from academia to immediately work for a testing company well um anyway i the opening statement for me is i'll just say that um you know my background uh i have three daughters all of them fully vaccinated according to the cdc schedule

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.643
I'm a physician, uh, that went pretty high in academic medicine.

01:12:22.663 --> 01:12:29.487
Uh, I was the chief of the critical care service, uh, and the director of the main ICU is one of the largest academic medical centers in the country.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:33.830
I also, uh, published over 50 papers, maybe 60.

01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:39.314
And one of my textbooks has translated the seven languages, uh, and it's in third edition.

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:48.560
But he's not aware that 60 liters of minute of pure oxygen during COVID might've been toxic or lead to ARDS, even though he's got a textbook about critical care.

01:12:49.338 --> 01:12:50.119
Stop lying!

01:12:50.961 --> 01:12:53.264
I mean, this man is a monster.

01:12:55.387 --> 01:12:57.411
He is a monster on a script.

01:13:00.224 --> 01:13:04.747
I was known as a leader in several fields, one of which was critical care ultrasonography.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:07.349
Another one was therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest.

01:13:07.389 --> 01:13:14.234
In fact, I was one of the leaders who launched the program here called Project Hypothermia.

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:19.238
My protocol, my hospital was the first one in all of New York City to cool patients.

01:13:19.618 --> 01:13:21.739
And by the time I was done, every hospital had a protocol.

01:13:21.759 --> 01:13:23.180
So I have a long history in medicine.

01:13:24.081 --> 01:13:27.724
So how did I get to this purported anti-vax position?

01:13:28.615 --> 01:13:31.857
Well, let's be clear on what an anti-vaxxer is, right?

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:38.980
And also let's be clear on what disinformation and misinformation is, because already I'm hearing things so completely inaccurate.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.421
Let's be clear.

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:44.863
Misinformation is something said out of ignorance or error.

01:13:45.123 --> 01:13:47.544
This almost sounds like a Robert Malone script.

01:13:47.584 --> 01:13:59.549
And it's funny, if we were to go back to that Ian Carroll and Joe Rogan two and a half hour podcast, at one point in time they're talking about Epstein, and Joe Rogan says, what if it's just a negotiation?

01:14:00.692 --> 01:14:23.093
what if it's not blackmail but if it's just a negotiation you know that they say that we have some pictures of you and why don't you just shut up for a while and ian carroll's kind of a little surprised because he's like i think that's just blackmail no no no no but what if it's not blackmail and if it's just negotiation and then ian has to say i don't think there's any difference between those two things you just described it is

01:14:23.653 --> 01:14:31.596
Two ridiculous jackasses pretending to have a conversation that is ridiculous because it's scripted, but improvised.

01:14:33.856 --> 01:14:35.777
And it's part of a national security script.

01:14:35.857 --> 01:14:38.678
This guy is trapped in a national security script.

01:14:39.238 --> 01:14:47.300
And because he's trapped in a national security script, he's going to get his clock cleaned by the people who have the opposite part of his script.

01:14:47.841 --> 01:14:49.001
He can't get off stage.

01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:51.283
He can't walk away.

01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:56.370
He can't change his script to say something, I don't know, that Jonathan Cooley told him.

01:14:58.834 --> 01:15:02.960
Disinformation is something said with the intent to mislead.

01:15:04.645 --> 01:15:09.946
If anti-vaxxers are disinformationists, what is their incentive to mislead?

01:15:10.487 --> 01:15:13.808
Why are they so up in arms against people getting vaccinated?

01:15:14.148 --> 01:15:15.608
It's because they want to protect them.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:19.289
There's only two ways you get to be a purported anti-vaxxer.

01:15:19.569 --> 01:15:26.111
One is through the direct lived reality of your child's life getting destroyed within days to a week of a vaccine.

01:15:26.671 --> 01:15:33.473
Or two, you are highly educated and you've done sufficient research into the background and history of the vaccine and vaccine industry.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:43.619
There is very well described that anti-vax positions, patients who choose not to vaccinate their children are always highly educated.

01:15:43.979 --> 01:15:45.901
They're critical thinkers who do deep research.

01:15:46.621 --> 01:15:48.823
And coming from where I told you I came from,

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:57.266
I found out that in my research in COVID, in my advocacy in COVID, I came out, I told the world to use corticosteroids in the hospitalized phase of this disease.

01:15:57.566 --> 01:15:58.727
I did it months before everyone.

01:15:58.747 --> 01:15:59.767
I got attacked.

01:15:59.807 --> 01:16:01.088
My whole university went after me.

01:16:01.108 --> 01:16:02.648
It became standard of care worldwide.

01:16:03.088 --> 01:16:07.910
When I said the same thing about ivermectin, my life went completely sideways, sideways.

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:09.111
I've lost four jobs.

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.812
I've been without income at times, but yet apparently I'm a grifter.

01:16:12.272 --> 01:16:13.232
Well, you did get $250,000 a year from

01:16:15.593 --> 01:16:22.677
from the, you know, the COVID, the IMA, which before that was called the FLCCC.

01:16:23.197 --> 01:16:30.841
And the FLCCC is the one that had the protocol that said if your pulse ox is below 96, you should go to the hospital.

01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:33.496
So Pierre Cory is a monster.

01:16:33.536 --> 01:16:39.081
He's a monster on a script, even if he just accepted the script that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan gave him.

01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:40.022
He's still a monster.

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:40.943
He's still a coward.

01:16:41.403 --> 01:16:46.108
And he still didn't have principles when we needed him to have principles because he's a piece of shit.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:47.249
Excuse my language.

01:16:48.387 --> 01:16:49.767
But I'm just tired of this guy.

01:16:50.568 --> 01:16:54.529
I'm tired of Pierre Kory and his emotionality and his whininess.

01:16:55.329 --> 01:16:56.630
Because he's on a script.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.470
He's got a best-selling book.

01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:05.673
He got a quarter million dollar salary for a few years from a non-profit that should have never existed in the first place.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:14.478
Just like Mary Holland is getting a quarter million dollars a year from a nonprofit that it should have never existed in the first place.

01:17:14.518 --> 01:17:21.604
Just like Brian Hooker is getting a quarter million dollars a year in great insurance from a nonprofit that it should have never existed in the first place.

01:17:22.024 --> 01:17:23.245
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:28.469
got paid a half a million dollars a year by a nonprofit that should have never existed in the first place.

01:17:28.549 --> 01:17:32.652
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in trouble if we do not wake up right now.

01:17:34.175 --> 01:17:39.008
Because these guys are scripted to fail, and we are scripted to go down with them.

01:17:42.451 --> 01:17:44.593
And how did I get to this position on vaccines?

01:17:44.653 --> 01:17:52.361
Because I found that I was living in a world where a lie could be told and everyone believed it around the world that ivermectin was ineffective at COVID.

01:17:52.881 --> 01:18:02.351
And when I saw that happening before my eyes with one of the greatest disinformation campaigns ever perpetrated by pharma, I asked myself, what other lies could they do?

01:18:03.071 --> 01:18:03.952
And that's how I'm here.

01:18:04.092 --> 01:18:04.313
Thanks.

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:07.654
And that's how I'm here.

01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:09.555
So I have no real message.

01:18:09.835 --> 01:18:10.995
I didn't have a message.

01:18:11.135 --> 01:18:25.799
I told you more about misinformation and disinformation than I did about the immune system or my objection to augmenting the immune system by the injection of a combination of substances because he's on a shitty script.

01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:34.421
All right, Steve, go ahead.

01:18:35.097 --> 01:18:41.119
You know, I was hugely pro-vaccine before the COVID shots.

01:18:42.079 --> 01:18:49.402
And if you asked me, should you get the COVID shot, I was like saying, of course, you'd be insane not to get the COVID shots.

01:18:49.922 --> 01:18:53.403
So I got my two, my wife got four, my kids are all vaccinated.

01:18:54.003 --> 01:19:00.586
How many times has he told this story about his house cleaner that had like three people die in her family or some bullshit like that?

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.386
And it's so unlikely.

01:19:02.706 --> 01:19:04.387
It's statistically ridiculous.

01:19:05.609 --> 01:19:10.876
How many times has he told this story that we're supposed to listen to this anecdote and then believe that he's right.

01:19:10.936 --> 01:19:15.923
And now we're supposed to let him analyze whatever data sets he wants to analyze and he's gotta be right.

01:19:16.463 --> 01:19:23.492
This MIT fraud is as fraudulent as Stephanie Seneff from MIT.

01:19:28.407 --> 01:19:29.768
And then I started hearing stories.

01:19:30.529 --> 01:19:31.810
Who else is from MIT?

01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:32.951
Oh yeah, Meryl Ness.

01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:34.692
She's another fraud from MIT.

01:19:34.912 --> 01:19:40.797
And started seeing, hearing stories, and some of them were of friends who had their relatives die.

01:19:40.857 --> 01:19:46.561
I heard one story from a friend who said that, she asked me, are the COVID vaccines safe?

01:19:46.621 --> 01:19:48.062
And I said, of course they're safe.

01:19:48.102 --> 01:19:50.624
I had a friend, I thought this was his house cleaner.

01:19:50.724 --> 01:19:52.205
What is this bullshit?

01:19:53.406 --> 01:19:54.187
Safest thing ever.

01:19:54.567 --> 01:19:57.629
I'm like repeating what I've been hearing from the CDC.

01:19:59.152 --> 01:20:01.674
And I said, why are you asking me such a dumb question?

01:20:02.054 --> 01:20:03.455
And I was a little bit more polite than that.

01:20:04.035 --> 01:20:08.538
And she said, well, three of my relatives were perfectly healthy.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:11.580
And a week after they got the COVID vaccine, they're dead.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.721
And I said, that's impossible.

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:15.722
The COVID vaccines are perfectly safe.

01:20:16.302 --> 01:20:17.803
It's like one in a million chance.

01:20:18.164 --> 01:20:20.825
You can't be one in a trillion here.

01:20:20.865 --> 01:20:24.267
I mean, that's statistically unlikely.

01:20:25.048 --> 01:20:27.189
And she said, yeah, but they're dead.

01:20:28.772 --> 01:20:33.934
And so that was the trigger that got me to go and start to look at the data.

01:20:34.794 --> 01:20:38.395
And there were other stories, by the way, for other people who are getting vaccine injured.

01:20:38.435 --> 01:20:40.656
I've never heard these stories before for any vaccine.

01:20:41.176 --> 01:20:42.556
So I started looking at the data.

01:20:42.636 --> 01:20:46.157
He sounds kind of like a Jessica Rose epigirl.

01:20:46.337 --> 01:20:48.938
I had never heard this for any other vaccine.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:54.140
And then I looked at VAERS and I found a signal in VAERS that never existed before.

01:20:54.702 --> 01:21:19.328
stop lying wow this is such shit but it's scripted shit at the various data i looked at all sorts of uh papers and so forth and i ended up writing 150 page article on whether i'm questioning whether you should get the covid shots or not this published in trial site news got a lot of um a lot of readers super popular and after i trial site news is a joke

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:27.259
that article, people on my scientific advisory board, which I had for finding early treatments for COVID.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:43.369
Oh, early treatments for COVID, just like Robert Malone, just like Pierre Kory, just like Peter McCullough, almost as if they were all on a script to make sure that they never questioned the existence of the novel virus, just how we responded to it.

01:21:43.769 --> 01:21:44.510
Stop lying!

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:49.473
It's just a joke.

01:21:50.393 --> 01:21:54.697
I resigned and they said they never wanted to speak to me again and I was a bad person.

01:21:54.757 --> 01:21:58.260
I said, well, was there something that I said that was wrong in the article?

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:04.025
Because if I'm wrong, I just would like to be corrected because I'm I don't want to be spreading misinformation.

01:22:04.465 --> 01:22:06.206
And they said, we never want to talk to you again.

01:22:06.246 --> 01:22:06.647
Goodbye.

01:22:07.067 --> 01:22:11.151
And so people were never willing to tell me why I was wrong.

01:22:11.751 --> 01:22:13.573
And that's probably just a lie.

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:16.063
I mean, this is just really sad.

01:22:16.303 --> 01:22:24.029
Best that I can get is people who, you know, tried to tell me, Oh, you're wrong, but they don't provide any reason that I'm wrong.

01:22:24.049 --> 01:22:25.130
That's backed by evidence.

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.072
There's just a hand waving attacks.

01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:31.475
So, um, it's, it's been a frustrating experience for me.

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:36.179
People saying that I'm wrong, but nobody, is this really what they prepared to say?

01:22:36.519 --> 01:22:39.862
Pierre Cory and Steve Kirsch couldn't do better than this.

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:47.809
This is even shittier than what he did when he went to MIT and supposedly gave a presentation that was going to stop the planet from spinning.

01:22:48.349 --> 01:22:54.054
Be willing to actually show the data that actually confirms that I'm wrong and they're right.

01:22:54.614 --> 01:22:59.699
So I'm hoping to find someone who can do that someday.

01:23:00.379 --> 01:23:04.603
But in the meantime, I've been calling for data transparency and

01:23:05.558 --> 01:23:14.903
There's no study that was ever done, published in a peer-reviewed journal, saying that if you withhold the data from the public, you're going to get better public health outcomes.

01:23:15.643 --> 01:23:28.450
Don't forget that right before the election was over, and it was decided, Steve Kirsch was on Stu Peter's podcast and said that in five years, RFK was going to give us all safe vaccines.

01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:29.431
That was his whole thing.

01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:30.767
He knew.

01:23:30.827 --> 01:23:31.268
He knows.

01:23:31.328 --> 01:23:32.128
He's great.

01:23:32.168 --> 01:23:33.970
This Steve Kirsch, he's a great guy.

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:34.970
He's a really good guy.

01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:35.951
And you know what?

01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:36.732
He's on your team.

01:23:37.648 --> 01:23:54.074
If you're on Donald Trump's team, you know, Steve Miller's also on your team, and Alex Jones is on your team, and Kevin McKernan's on your team, and Robert Malone's on your team, and all the people behind RFK, all the fake people like Mary Holland, and Meryl Nass, and Brian Hooker, they're all on your team.

01:23:54.654 --> 01:23:56.094
Laura Loomer's on your team.

01:23:56.174 --> 01:23:58.815
Sasha Latupova's daughter, Soph, is on your team.

01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:03.417
It is just one giant van full of shitty people.

01:24:04.946 --> 01:24:08.027
And yet somehow or another we made the excuse to cheer for them.

01:24:09.727 --> 01:24:12.588
And it's because it was a military operation.

01:24:14.928 --> 01:24:15.848
That's your excuse.

01:24:16.869 --> 01:24:20.249
That's how you apologize to your family and friends for having bought into it.

01:24:20.309 --> 01:24:21.510
They bought into it too.

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:24.030
They just bought into the easier side of it.

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.111
Both sides are bamboozled.

01:24:27.991 --> 01:24:29.831
It doesn't mean that the blue team is right.

01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:32.552
It just means that the red team was set up.

01:24:33.689 --> 01:24:34.289
Listen to me.

01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:36.410
It doesn't mean the blue team is right.

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:38.071
It means the red team was set up.

01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:43.094
And if we don't pull our heads out, the red team is about to get absolutely destroyed.

01:24:43.114 --> 01:24:49.897
The public deserves seeing the public health data.

01:24:50.397 --> 01:24:51.878
It's always being withheld.

01:24:52.338 --> 01:24:54.719
It's being withheld from everybody in the United States.

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:56.020
It's always been kept secret.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.020
RFK Jr.

01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.101
is going to change that.

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:02.463
But calling for data transparency, why can't we have the data and let everybody decide from the data?

01:25:03.291 --> 01:25:04.712
Why does it have to be hidden?

01:25:05.773 --> 01:25:06.114
All right.

01:25:09.977 --> 01:25:10.278
All right.

01:25:10.378 --> 01:25:11.919
Thank you, Steve, so much.

01:25:12.279 --> 01:25:14.521
We're going to get to the first question right away here.

01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:15.743
Let's get into it.

01:25:17.124 --> 01:25:19.486
Dave and Dan, you guys are going to be able to start this one.

01:25:19.506 --> 01:25:23.069
That means Steve and Pierre are going to get the last word on this question.

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:27.614
So the question is, vaccines and autism, is there a link?

01:25:28.484 --> 01:25:31.886
So it's funny to me because it's always the same story, right?

01:25:32.106 --> 01:25:34.328
I was pro-vax and my kids are vaccinated.

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:35.728
It's just the COVID vax.

01:25:35.989 --> 01:25:40.431
But if it was just the COVID vaccine, why are we here talking about the entire vaccine schedule, right?

01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:42.413
Why are we talking about vaccines and autism?

01:25:42.693 --> 01:25:45.274
Is there a vaccine in the schedule that you think is good?

01:25:46.755 --> 01:25:54.360
How is it that we're always fixating on the COVID vaccine and then all of these people here that are supporting you are just magically against all vaccines, right?

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.482
That is the perfect question, the perfect contradiction to point out.

01:25:59.702 --> 01:26:00.582
It is magical.

01:26:01.522 --> 01:26:11.946
It's absolutely magical because remember, 10 years ago, Mary Holland said that the MMR vaccine gave her son autism.

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:22.349
20 years ago, or sorry, not 20 years ago, 12 years ago, Brian Hooker said that his son got five vaccines on the same day when he had an ear infection and that got him autism.

01:26:23.649 --> 01:26:25.033
and go back about 20 years.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:30.810
And Polly Tommy says her son got autism after the MMR shot, but she also gave him Tylenol afterward.

01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:44.784
So you would think that Pierre Corey and Steve Kirsch would be prepared to answer this and be prepared to speak to this nuance.

01:26:45.344 --> 01:26:57.971
And the way to speak to this nuance would be, of course, that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting our immune system, as we understand it, organized around epithelial barriers would be absurd.

01:26:58.472 --> 01:27:03.915
And that's why a lot of vaccines, which are implied intramuscularly, are probably injuring people.

01:27:05.123 --> 01:27:13.485
Many of these injuries go undetected because they are smeared across time and space and they don't necessarily show up in a way that's predictable.

01:27:14.725 --> 01:27:28.788
And so it is kind of rare and it is hard to find and it is hard to track, but the fundamental principles that we understand as far as how our immune system work do not suggest that intramuscular injection is a great way to access it.

01:27:30.922 --> 01:27:39.646
And so it is a little hard because again, there have been people who think that it's a specific shot when actuality it's probably not a specific shot.

01:27:39.987 --> 01:27:42.488
It might not even be a specific component.

01:27:42.888 --> 01:27:54.274
It might just be the exposure to things you're not supposed to be exposed to intramuscularly and the absolutely astronomically unpredictable results that might occur from it.

01:27:56.383 --> 01:28:03.706
And if these people were capable of saying that, then this guy wouldn't have such an easy time dunking on them.

01:28:04.767 --> 01:28:07.848
If you're not anti-vaxxers, how did that happen exactly?

01:28:07.888 --> 01:28:08.869
Yeah, it's all of them.

01:28:09.029 --> 01:28:09.429
Keep going.

01:28:09.809 --> 01:28:09.989
Huh?

01:28:10.249 --> 01:28:10.870
It's all of them.

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:11.230
Keep going.

01:28:11.530 --> 01:28:12.530
Okay, so he admits it.

01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:22.715
So it's all of them, but it can't be all of them because the measles vaccine and the MMR vaccine is actually applied subcutaneously, so it's different.

01:28:23.717 --> 01:28:27.079
the oral polio vaccine is probably not causing autism.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:44.689
And so already Pierre Cory has lost because he has been hanging around with Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and all these other jackasses who can't get it right.

01:28:46.684 --> 01:28:47.765
who've never gotten it right.

01:28:47.785 --> 01:28:53.892
You know, Sherry Tenpenny, who's been working on vaccines for 25 years and still hasn't figured it out.

01:28:53.952 --> 01:28:55.474
But God told her to keep working.

01:28:56.936 --> 01:28:57.837
She heard his voice.

01:28:57.857 --> 01:29:01.341
So you are just against all vaccines.

01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:02.522
Yeah.

01:29:02.742 --> 01:29:03.483
It's your turn.

01:29:03.683 --> 01:29:04.384
Go ahead.

01:29:04.484 --> 01:29:07.388
So you listed a lot of accolades in your introduction.

01:29:10.052 --> 01:29:13.293
Let's, you guys in the audience, please don't heckle the stage.

01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:15.854
We need to let the information come out.

01:29:16.094 --> 01:29:17.755
Let these guys have the conversation.

01:29:18.255 --> 01:29:30.919
Okay, Pierre, so you listed a lot of accolades in your introduction, and the common line that a lot of people who think that vaccines cause autism say is that autism has greatly increased in the past few decades.

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:34.200
You two would agree with that line of reasoning, right?

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.982
That's not the primary line of reasoning, but yes.

01:29:37.002 --> 01:29:38.163
But it's necessary, right?

01:29:38.283 --> 01:29:40.585
That's one of the things, but that's not the primary thing.

01:29:40.605 --> 01:29:49.351
But if autism was not increasing over the past few decades, that would... So why isn't Pierre being precise?

01:29:49.431 --> 01:29:56.797
That if it's vaccines, then it correlates directly with the rise in the vaccine schedule.

01:29:56.837 --> 01:29:59.719
The more shots, the more autism.

01:30:00.549 --> 01:30:10.135
So he's allowing Dan to just kind of hand wave about when this occurred instead of being very specific about it, which he could be if he was prepared.

01:30:12.296 --> 01:30:13.177
Be interesting to you?

01:30:13.677 --> 01:30:14.698
Yes, absolutely.

01:30:14.718 --> 01:30:16.399
Okay, so do you have any?

01:30:17.518 --> 01:30:30.576
knowledge, any mechanism, any scientific reasoning as to why there is a biological reason why autism is increasing as opposed to a diagnostic criteria reason.

01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:32.058
Yes, we do.

01:30:32.378 --> 01:30:33.179
Okay, let's start.

01:30:33.199 --> 01:30:33.759
Lay it on us.

01:30:34.079 --> 01:30:35.380
So, should we go now?

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.180
Yeah, go ahead.

01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.460
It's back and forth.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.301
It's back and forth.

01:30:38.501 --> 01:30:39.721
Let me be clear.

01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:44.363
So, vaccines have a number of adjuvants.

01:30:44.923 --> 01:30:48.424
Many of them have been shown to be neurotoxic and producing neuroinflammation.

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:48.944
Which one?

01:30:48.964 --> 01:30:50.485
It's in all of the inserts.

01:30:50.505 --> 01:30:50.825
Which one?

01:30:51.818 --> 01:30:54.361
anything with mercury, thiamine, thimerosal, aluminum.

01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:55.202
No neurotoxins.

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:55.703
Are those in the MMR?

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.744
Are those in the MMR?

01:30:56.764 --> 01:30:56.984
Yeah.

01:30:57.024 --> 01:30:58.346
So mercury was never in the vaccines?

01:30:58.366 --> 01:31:00.148
But why'd they take it out?

01:31:00.168 --> 01:31:00.148
2001.

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:00.789
Quite a long time ago.

01:31:00.829 --> 01:31:01.450
Why'd they take it out?

01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.810
There it is.

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:03.332
They already completely failed.

01:31:13.186 --> 01:31:23.004
They already completely failed on your behalf, on RFK's behalf, on Jay Bhattacharya's behalf, on Marty McCary's behalf, on Donald Trump's behalf.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:24.547
They just failed.

01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:49.221
Because rather than having the exorbitantly long list of excipients and preservatives and adjuvants that are in the vaccines, and when they were asked, what do you think does it, they would say, well, a combination, any combination of these substances injected intramuscularly could potentially do it, and then start listing them.

01:31:49.881 --> 01:31:54.167
You know, like Brandy Vaughn did on billboards in 2016, 17, and 18 before she was killed in 2020.

01:31:54.427 --> 01:31:56.009
Instead, he regurgitates thimerosal.

01:32:05.290 --> 01:32:08.733
Is he really unaware that that's no longer in any shots?

01:32:08.793 --> 01:32:10.774
It was only in one flu shot?

01:32:11.315 --> 01:32:12.896
Is he really unaware of that?

01:32:12.916 --> 01:32:21.763
Did he really come here on our behalf to represent Robert Malone and team Worst Case Scenario this shittily?

01:32:24.525 --> 01:32:25.405
With his frickin...

01:32:26.491 --> 01:32:28.776
No socks and gay shoes on.

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.342
What in the nine hells is going on here?

01:32:31.843 --> 01:32:37.054
Other than a scripted failure and Steve Kirsch is just monitoring it.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.761
Because of the public fervor.

01:32:40.282 --> 01:32:43.064
It had never been demonstrated to be harmful at all.

01:32:43.304 --> 01:32:44.725
They took it out because of public fervor.

01:32:45.246 --> 01:32:46.526
But the point is 2001.

01:32:46.887 --> 01:32:50.349
And when they took it out, did autism rates decline or did they go up?

01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:54.272
It's not just mercury.

01:32:54.332 --> 01:32:55.453
It's not just mercury.

01:32:55.493 --> 01:32:58.616
Then why in the hell did you mention it first, dumbass?

01:33:01.761 --> 01:33:04.203
I mean, wow, is this terrible?

01:33:05.023 --> 01:33:14.369
And his attitude really suggests to me that he is woefully unaware how dumb of a position he's in right now.

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:20.333
Woefully unaware that CHD and Brian Hooker and all those people didn't prepare him for this.

01:33:20.953 --> 01:33:23.355
He's about to get his clock cleaned.

01:33:24.741 --> 01:33:27.102
Hey Marisol, check them out.

01:33:27.182 --> 01:33:29.503
I said many of the adjuvants.

01:33:29.523 --> 01:33:29.963
So which one?

01:33:30.003 --> 01:33:30.964
Hang on, so you said mercury.

01:33:31.004 --> 01:33:31.684
Which one?

01:33:31.744 --> 01:33:32.984
Here, you said mercury.

01:33:33.044 --> 01:33:34.905
First of all, that's not an adjuvant.

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:36.506
First of all, mercury is not an adjuvant.

01:33:36.566 --> 01:33:37.026
What is it?

01:33:37.046 --> 01:33:37.766
What does it do?

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:50.486
It's an ingredient in the vaccine.

01:33:50.526 --> 01:33:51.187
What does it do?

01:33:51.848 --> 01:33:52.889
See how they do it?

01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:53.730
What does it do?

01:33:54.732 --> 01:33:56.794
So again, you can memorize things.

01:33:56.874 --> 01:34:02.342
It's strange that Pierre Corey doesn't know that mercury and thimerosal were in there as a preservative.

01:34:02.402 --> 01:34:03.884
It's strange that he doesn't know it.

01:34:04.665 --> 01:34:05.366
You don't know, do you?

01:34:05.626 --> 01:34:06.646
I don't care.

01:34:07.187 --> 01:34:09.909
It's a preservative.

01:34:10.049 --> 01:34:15.293
We are now going to have to educate them on what the ingredient they think is dangerous does.

01:34:16.013 --> 01:34:21.157
Why does he need to use his hands unless he's trying to pretend like he's very smart?

01:34:21.217 --> 01:34:26.260
Because if you use your hands and it doesn't really say anything, then you're forcing it.

01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:34.046
And Mr. Dipshit here, Dr. Dan Wilson, will force it all the time because he is an absolute scripted fraud.

01:34:35.287 --> 01:34:38.950
He looks up to Dave because Dave has been in this little script longer than him.

01:34:42.513 --> 01:34:45.275
It's also not elemental mercury.

01:34:45.335 --> 01:34:49.518
I wonder if we've heard Paul Offit talk about this at all.

01:34:49.698 --> 01:34:50.479
I think we have.

01:34:50.599 --> 01:34:51.940
Maybe for 10 years straight.

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.982
Maybe the same talking points for 10 years straight.

01:34:55.442 --> 01:34:56.063
No shit.

01:34:57.979 --> 01:34:59.219
Let's let Steve get in here.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:00.840
Steve, you want to add something?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.641
It's just that he's just talking about one of the ingredients.

01:35:05.461 --> 01:35:06.821
It's not just the adjuvants.

01:35:06.882 --> 01:35:10.562
It's anything that's in the vaccine that is getting injected.

01:35:10.743 --> 01:35:12.623
Yeah, thimerosal is not an adjuvant again, by the way.

01:35:12.643 --> 01:35:16.264
So aluminum, for example, can get into you through injection.

01:35:16.284 --> 01:35:17.064
Is that in MMR?

01:35:17.224 --> 01:35:17.684
Hang on.

01:35:17.704 --> 01:35:19.365
We'll get to aluminum, but let's stay on mercury.

01:35:19.765 --> 01:35:22.106
Did autism... Is that in MMR?

01:35:22.186 --> 01:35:26.827
Can you imagine coming to this and not knowing what was in MMR, knowing that

01:35:27.327 --> 01:35:36.455
You know, Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and all the other people on your team have probably, at least mistakenly, blamed MMR for everything.

01:35:38.997 --> 01:35:39.477
But no.

01:35:40.638 --> 01:35:42.800
They don't know what's in those shots.

01:35:43.561 --> 01:35:48.625
They don't know what antigens are there, what conjugate proteins are in there.

01:35:48.665 --> 01:35:51.267
They don't know what preservatives or excipients are in there.

01:35:51.307 --> 01:35:51.888
They know nothing.

01:35:53.442 --> 01:35:58.989
That's how prepared they are to defend their position, that they're so serious about it.

01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:00.431
So serious.

01:36:01.793 --> 01:36:03.315
So serious is Steve Kirsch.

01:36:03.415 --> 01:36:05.017
So serious is Pierre Kory.

01:36:05.037 --> 01:36:06.219
Boy, they're very serious.

01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.605
...go up after 2001 when it was taken out of the childhood vaccines.

01:36:11.363 --> 01:36:11.623
Yes.

01:36:12.825 --> 01:36:19.132
So would you expect autism to go down if an ingredient that causes autism got out of vaccines?

01:36:19.152 --> 01:36:21.395
The thing that causes autism isn't in there anymore.

01:36:21.935 --> 01:36:23.177
What do you expect is going to happen?

01:36:23.998 --> 01:36:26.661
It doesn't quite work that way because... How does it work?

01:36:26.921 --> 01:36:27.382
How do you know?

01:36:29.087 --> 01:36:31.949
Do you know what else happened after they took mercury out of the vaccines?

01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:34.550
The number of vaccines continued to explode.

01:36:34.951 --> 01:36:35.371
Not really.

01:36:35.651 --> 01:36:38.113
And what's... No, not by that much.

01:36:38.133 --> 01:36:39.193
But also, what's in them?

01:36:39.213 --> 01:36:40.654
We're still looking for the ingredient, right?

01:36:40.674 --> 01:36:42.495
You don't know what they do, but... I don't care about the ingredient.

01:36:42.515 --> 01:36:45.737
So guys, we're talking about the association between vaccines and autism.

01:36:45.797 --> 01:36:46.017
Yes.

01:36:46.118 --> 01:36:47.438
You guys are asking for mechanisms.

01:36:47.779 --> 01:36:50.961
I will tell you the associations between vaccines and autism.

01:36:51.001 --> 01:36:55.283
But you mentioned mercury, and I'm asking for a mechanism there, and you're not able to do that.

01:36:55.383 --> 01:36:56.064
So we can move on.

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.666
There's got to be a compound that does it, right?

01:36:58.706 --> 01:37:00.187
I'll give you a mechanism, aluminum.

01:37:02.309 --> 01:37:03.650
Are you familiar with Chris Exley?

01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.990
Yes.

01:37:04.771 --> 01:37:05.091
Okay.

01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:08.934
So you know he's like the world expert on toxicology.

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:09.415
He's not.

01:37:09.455 --> 01:37:10.015
Oh, he's not.

01:37:10.035 --> 01:37:10.476
Then who is?

01:37:11.243 --> 01:37:14.046
There is no single world expert in toxicology.

01:37:14.086 --> 01:37:15.987
You like to paint this caricature of science.

01:37:16.007 --> 01:37:16.848
There is no one single expert.

01:37:16.868 --> 01:37:16.908
So?

01:37:16.928 --> 01:37:18.049
He's been producing slop for 46 years.

01:37:29.239 --> 01:37:31.922
So he's been doing it for 36 years.

01:37:32.282 --> 01:37:36.245
There's nobody doing more research on that.

01:37:36.585 --> 01:37:47.855
And he finds kids, like a 12-year-old, with aluminum concentration in their brain that is off the charts, never seen before, and the kid is autistic.

01:37:48.035 --> 01:37:48.215
Great.

01:37:48.275 --> 01:37:52.640
So let's start with, I'm assuming you're talking first about the 2017 Exley paper, right?

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:52.880
Yes.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:53.200
Right.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.922
Because they sent them papers.

01:37:55.122 --> 01:37:56.704
They sent each other papers.

01:37:56.784 --> 01:38:00.948
So here again, did Dan and, and Dave prepare?

01:38:01.369 --> 01:38:02.330
Of course they did.

01:38:04.131 --> 01:38:04.372
Okay.

01:38:04.392 --> 01:38:08.976
So did you look at the numbers there in his table of aluminum measurements?

01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:10.358
Uh, no.

01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:13.142
You didn't look at them?

01:38:13.483 --> 01:38:14.403
You didn't look at the numbers?

01:38:14.423 --> 01:38:16.265
They're off the charts but you didn't look at the numbers.

01:38:17.746 --> 01:38:26.634
There's a lot of stuff that I haven't... It's your source that you provided for this debate and you don't know anything about the data in it?

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.636
Here, I'll give you some quotes from Chris Exley.

01:38:29.196 --> 01:38:32.899
Since you don't know the paper that you brought, we can teach you what's in the paper.

01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:35.381
The numbers are all fucking over the place.

01:38:35.781 --> 01:38:37.002
There's no clear trend.

01:38:37.443 --> 01:38:41.806
And second of all, there's absolutely no way to mechanistically and causally link that to anything.

01:38:42.187 --> 01:38:50.734
Even if the data was good, how do you rule out the idea that there's a neurological condition that just makes the brain not clear aluminum as well, right?

01:38:50.754 --> 01:38:54.877
There's no way to mechanistically link that to a causative agent of autism.

01:38:54.977 --> 01:38:59.300
So Chris actually has published over 200 peer-reviewed papers.

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:00.060
Data.

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.001
On aluminum.

01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:02.382
Let's get to the data.

01:39:03.723 --> 01:39:07.405
He's published over 200 peer-reviewed papers.

01:39:07.425 --> 01:39:08.465
Many of which are retracted.

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:15.590
What he says is, I did not see such high aluminum content in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:17.131
This was extraordinary.

01:39:17.511 --> 01:39:23.215
These are some of the highest values ever measured in human brain tissue.

01:39:23.806 --> 01:39:27.528
Now, it's not that you can't argue this effectively.

01:39:27.668 --> 01:39:34.030
It's that Steve Kirsch and Pierre Kory cannot argue this position effectively.

01:39:34.110 --> 01:39:35.391
That's what you need to see here.

01:39:35.871 --> 01:39:41.353
They are scripted and whether Pierre Kory knows it or not, this guy is awful.

01:39:42.073 --> 01:39:43.074
I mean, awful.

01:39:44.414 --> 01:39:48.096
His entire performance for the last five years has been awful.

01:39:50.523 --> 01:39:52.004
Go ahead and dispute that.

01:39:52.024 --> 01:39:58.607
Tell me your source for someone who has higher levels of aluminum than what he's measured.

01:39:58.947 --> 01:39:59.468
I'll do you better.

01:39:59.748 --> 01:40:01.889
So let's go to that table that you didn't read.

01:40:02.289 --> 01:40:07.672
So let me read off some of the measurements that he got of aluminum in a child's brain.

01:40:07.712 --> 01:40:10.934
Do you know what a technical replicate of an experiment is?

01:40:12.705 --> 01:40:26.803
Sorry a technical replicant Because you guys don't even read the studies that you I'm sorry Pierre Pierre I I think I Pierre I think Let me just make an idea what you're talking about

01:40:31.988 --> 01:40:33.489
Let's recap for a minute.

01:40:33.989 --> 01:40:35.329
Pierre brought up Mercury.

01:40:39.051 --> 01:40:41.192
You need a positive agent.

01:40:41.272 --> 01:40:42.732
What are we dealing with here?

01:40:42.812 --> 01:40:51.256
I just hope it's clear to you that the primary thing we're dealing here with is that all of these people, wittingly or unwittingly, have accepted the fact

01:40:55.427 --> 01:41:10.067
They have accepted the fact that since the late 1800s, we have had doctors that were using the same needles and the same syringe on an entire town.

01:41:11.007 --> 01:41:24.945
to cure all kinds of things back when we didn't know enough about anything to know what we could do because it didn't leave a scar and it didn't cause pain and so therefore they thought that this was the best medical tool that had yet been invented.

01:41:25.783 --> 01:41:42.979
So much so that there was a physician supply company in Pittsburgh already making little boxes like this at the turn of the century that contained a single syringe along with several glass little vials full of dissolvable things that you could then inject with a pair of needles.

01:41:47.731 --> 01:42:01.215
What I want you to understand is that intramuscular injection and even subcutaneous injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a human's health has been around for about 120 years, maybe 140 years.

01:42:01.255 --> 01:42:04.215
And it originates from a time when we did not know better.

01:42:14.511 --> 01:42:18.053
It originates from a time when we did not know better.

01:42:19.654 --> 01:42:22.876
We have not been injecting ourselves for centuries.

01:42:24.457 --> 01:42:26.078
It's about 140 years.

01:42:28.399 --> 01:42:35.503
And for the first 60 of those years, we didn't know jack about Diddley.

01:42:43.996 --> 01:42:46.979
You said mercury, you said aluminum.

01:42:47.559 --> 01:42:49.781
This is descending into nonsense.

01:42:49.941 --> 01:42:53.444
It's descending into us showing that you have no idea what you're talking about.

01:42:53.684 --> 01:42:55.886
You guys, let's recap the time here.

01:42:56.246 --> 01:43:00.930
But we do need to finish this real quick because we didn't bring up the point that it didn't parse the study.

01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:04.774
There was no data on whether the patients were vaccinated or unvaccinated.

01:43:05.515 --> 01:43:20.435
The the study was shit you finish that because you you read it better than I sure so I mean watching first of all Pierre I understand you're getting upset, but I think it's reasonable to expect you to know certain things about the topics you claim to know better than the world's leading experts on Yeah, let's let Pierre get in yeah

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:28.858
So this request for mechanisms is one of the oldest tricks in the book that's perpetrated by the academics.

01:43:29.058 --> 01:43:29.438
Okay.

01:43:29.538 --> 01:43:34.040
So this is what they do when they see associations that they cannot dispel.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.580
They do one, a few things.

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.001
And let's talk about the Institute of medicine.

01:43:37.021 --> 01:43:38.701
Cause you guys actually put that in as a reference.

01:43:39.182 --> 01:43:41.062
Do you guys know the history of the Institute of medicine?

01:43:41.082 --> 01:43:41.482
What it is?

01:43:41.502 --> 01:43:43.683
So I can ask you these little questions.

01:43:43.723 --> 01:43:44.744
What is the Institute of medicine?

01:43:44.764 --> 01:43:46.244
It's an independent body of experts.

01:43:46.524 --> 01:43:47.004
Oh, it is.

01:43:47.144 --> 01:43:47.424
Okay.

01:43:47.965 --> 01:43:48.685
How did it get funded?

01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:50.081
Not aware.

01:43:50.521 --> 01:43:50.661
What?

01:43:51.241 --> 01:43:51.541
Not aware.

01:43:52.102 --> 01:43:53.302
You're not aware?

01:43:53.322 --> 01:43:53.402
Okay.

01:43:53.682 --> 01:43:55.523
Pierre is not good at this.

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:57.683
Steve is not good at this.

01:43:57.743 --> 01:44:00.124
This script makes them look like children.

01:44:00.244 --> 01:44:01.264
It's kind of sad.

01:44:01.444 --> 01:44:04.285
You rely on their, you rely on what they say?

01:44:04.325 --> 01:44:05.585
Let me school you a little bit.

01:44:05.765 --> 01:44:08.746
You guys supplied IOM data, you don't even know how to fund it.

01:44:08.926 --> 01:44:12.727
So I care more about the integrity of data than I do about the funding sources.

01:44:12.767 --> 01:44:13.927
But we can get the funding sources if you want.

01:44:13.947 --> 01:44:19.629
The Institute of Medicine is a private organization funded by industry and government.

01:44:20.489 --> 01:44:29.472
They have produced numbers of reports on various toxins plaguing our society, beginning with Agent Orange.

01:44:30.332 --> 01:44:34.573
Here we are 40 years later, numbers of reports of Agent Orange each time

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.661
They say insufficient data.

01:44:37.961 --> 01:44:40.322
Finally, in 2018, they said, you know what?

01:44:40.342 --> 01:44:41.763
We need studies on veterans.

01:44:42.223 --> 01:44:42.663
30 years later.

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:43.123
Okay.

01:44:43.783 --> 01:44:49.606
They were investigated by a congressional committee and found is asking for a mechanism and he won't give it to him.

01:44:49.686 --> 01:44:50.626
Isn't it scary?

01:44:50.666 --> 01:44:52.587
Because the mechanism is really simple.

01:44:52.627 --> 01:45:00.150
Intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system, which is organized around epithelial barriers,

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:05.793
is really a dumb idea that stretches back to when medicine was really just morphine.

01:45:07.995 --> 01:45:17.400
How simple would it be to educate these two scripted dipshits about the medicine that isn't medicine?

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:20.902
Except this is also a scripted dipshit.

01:45:23.424 --> 01:45:27.106
Witting or unwitting, Pierre Cory is a traitor to our children.

01:45:28.703 --> 01:45:32.526
deserves rotten vegetables thrown at him for the rest of his life.

01:45:33.587 --> 01:45:38.951
Steve Kirsch deserves rotten vegetables thrown at him for the rest of his life.

01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:47.277
None of these people should be able to go in public without needing a see-through umbrella to protect them from the vegetable rain.

01:45:52.921 --> 01:45:55.003
that they manipulated and misled the public.

01:45:55.083 --> 01:45:57.145
That's just on Agent Orange.

01:45:57.585 --> 01:46:09.076
They've gone on over the next few decades to address a number of toxins for which the government would be having to pay out massive compensation claims, including Gulf War Syndrome.

01:46:09.676 --> 01:46:20.363
The anthrax vaccine, where veterans, chronically ill, lives destroyed from Gulf War syndrome, they tested for squalene, an ingredient in the anthrax vaccine.

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:22.985
95% of those ill had squalene antibiotics.

01:46:23.445 --> 01:46:24.786
Anyone healthy had none.

01:46:24.846 --> 01:46:25.907
Okay, so let me finish.

01:46:25.927 --> 01:46:26.868
I'm finishing my point here.

01:46:26.908 --> 01:46:31.771
So you have Gulf War, you have anthrax, you have Agent Orange, nothing to see here.

01:46:32.272 --> 01:46:35.534
Asbestos in baby powder, baby food, nothing to see here.

01:46:36.074 --> 01:46:36.615
Autism.

01:46:37.395 --> 01:46:38.076
We don't know.

01:46:38.096 --> 01:46:39.939
We don't have the evidence to say yes or no.

01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:41.260
There's a pattern.

01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:47.709
This is an organization that gets hired by industry and government to literally kick the can down the road.

01:46:48.029 --> 01:46:50.553
And even when they find an association, they do what you guys do.

01:46:50.913 --> 01:46:52.355
Elaborate the mechanisms.

01:46:52.475 --> 01:46:53.677
Show me the mechanisms.

01:46:53.937 --> 01:46:55.578
It's not my job to show you the mechanism.

01:46:55.618 --> 01:46:59.021
My job is to show you that they will kill and injure people and make them ill.

01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:07.586
Where this conspiracy falls apart is that you're relying on the American government, ignoring the fact that there are hundreds of other countries that also do science.

01:47:07.887 --> 01:47:17.773
So if you can't provide any studies from other nations that aren't under the tyrannical American government, that can produce any kind of data to establish these connections, then what are we even doing here?

01:47:18.714 --> 01:47:21.376
I'd like to add on this point about mechanisms,

01:47:21.676 --> 01:47:24.237
When we ask, oh, don't you hear what he missed?

01:47:24.777 --> 01:47:46.785
Wouldn't it be great for Pierre Cory or Robert Malone or Meryl Nass or Brian Hooker or any of these other fake dipshits to ever bring up the fact that the vaccine schedules all around earth are a fraction of the vaccine schedule that's recommended by the CDC?

01:47:50.649 --> 01:48:02.353
Wouldn't it just be great if you just pointed out that, well, ask these guys, what's the difference between the vaccine schedule in America and the vaccine schedule in the Netherlands?

01:48:02.833 --> 01:48:07.295
What's the difference between the vaccine schedule in America and the vaccine schedule in Norway?

01:48:07.935 --> 01:48:15.738
And what's the difference between the prevalence of the diseases in those populations that apparently America vaccinates better for?

01:48:17.799 --> 01:48:20.600
have that data ready to go, but no one's ever done it.

01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.701
Sherry Tenpenny in 25 years has never done it.

01:48:25.762 --> 01:48:29.403
Aaron Seery in 20 years has never done it.

01:48:32.684 --> 01:48:43.548
In fact, Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Brian Hooker, all these people with apparently their entire lives and careers on the line have never bothered to do that.

01:48:46.681 --> 01:49:14.261
stop lying it's just ridiculous all these easy home runs all these easy answers have been missed for 15 years with no progress and just because they handed that deflated football to the fat man over here and he's holding it so that the bald man can kick it

01:49:15.026 --> 01:49:16.527
It doesn't mean they're playing football.

01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:21.992
For mechanisms, we expect an answer.

01:49:22.633 --> 01:49:27.838
And I don't know is a fine answer because scientists, we don't expect a mechanism in every single case.

01:49:27.878 --> 01:49:31.061
There are plenty of things that we know there are known associations, but no known.

01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:40.849
I mean, can't you turn it around and say that, you know, Peter Hotez and professor Dave say that this is a genetic disease with over a hundred genes.

01:49:40.889 --> 01:49:41.110
Well,

01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:44.052
Aren't genes subject to development?

01:49:44.572 --> 01:49:47.774
Aren't gene expression patterns dictated by development?

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:52.417
And isn't development a complex interaction between genes and the environment?

01:49:52.818 --> 01:50:11.310
So then how can you rule out the possibility that it's not just genes, but it's actually exposure to things and that that exposure to things, the worst kind might be injection, you know, like a rattlesnake bite or an insect bite or a fricking intramuscular injection of a, I don't know, a couple milliliters of shit.

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:13.691
but they can't do it.

01:50:14.311 --> 01:50:38.667
They have no ability to argue because he spent more time on misinformation and disinformation, more time on, you know, where I studied and what I know and how many languages my textbooks are in instead of preparing something intelligent to say that would beat the standard bullshit narrative that also hasn't changed in 15 years that might as well be Paul Offit over here.

01:50:38.727 --> 01:50:42.290
But again, you got to hand the football over to younger people.

01:50:43.233 --> 01:50:46.753
Otherwise it really will just be the same people arguing the same points.

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:49.600
nailed down mechanism.

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.022
So to be mad that we're asking for a mechanism is a little weird.

01:50:54.262 --> 01:51:06.608
But if we want to get back to Illumina- Autism spectrum disorder, according to Peter Hotez, is a spectrum because it is the consequence of a combination of over a hundred developmental genes.

01:51:07.288 --> 01:51:14.032
So how in the Sam hell, if we accept any of that bullshit, are we supposed to come up with a fricking mechanism?

01:51:15.421 --> 01:51:32.678
but because this guy is scripted to be a cunt, scripted to say this shit and act like he knows, and because he's talking to people who are scripted not to know, wittingly or unwittingly, it looks like he's winning, but it's complete bullshit.

01:51:35.434 --> 01:51:39.217
which is the topic that you guys wanted to talk about, we can do that.

01:51:39.257 --> 01:51:42.360
You guys wanted to talk about it because you asked for a mechanism.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.501
I want to talk about the Verstraeten study.

01:51:44.922 --> 01:51:45.542
You get a vaccine.

01:51:45.562 --> 01:51:47.443
I want to talk about the William Thompson study.

01:51:47.824 --> 01:51:55.510
And then the child falls into dense, life-altering, nonverbal autism for the rest of their life, either beginning that day or the next day.

01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:57.171
That's not a mechanism.

01:51:57.191 --> 01:51:58.472
That's not a mechanism.

01:51:58.512 --> 01:52:01.134
You're relying on bullshit anecdotal evidence.

01:52:01.154 --> 01:52:03.836
You have no studies to support that whatsoever.

01:52:04.176 --> 01:52:08.059
And this guy is really into it because he has a son with autism.

01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.961
He's going to get mad about it at some point.

01:52:10.021 --> 01:52:11.903
And that's why he's so invested.

01:52:12.864 --> 01:52:14.225
That's why he's so angry.

01:52:15.384 --> 01:52:20.308
Cause he really doesn't like it if it's vaccines and it could have been avoided for his son.

01:52:20.749 --> 01:52:22.270
It's definitely not vaccines.

01:52:22.670 --> 01:52:28.876
He probably even has a story under his hat that it actually was about a week after some vaccines or some shit like that.

01:52:29.416 --> 01:52:31.298
This man is scum.

01:52:32.159 --> 01:52:38.044
And the reason why he's scum is because he's actually coordinating his work on the internet with the Weinsteins.

01:52:38.908 --> 01:53:00.591
and making a lot of money in views going against the Weinsteins, who are also very much a part of this script, which comes from their dad and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and all of these other, you know, scripted actors that are being basically scripted to do what they're doing by the national security state.

01:53:02.102 --> 01:53:06.406
Elon Musk is not getting all these DOD contracts because he's so smart.

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:07.587
That's impossible.

01:53:08.068 --> 01:53:13.953
Otherwise there would be at least one video of him saying something profound.

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.276
The same goes for Peter Thiel.

01:53:17.386 --> 01:53:21.408
He's just an overrated gay man who plays chess very well.

01:53:21.749 --> 01:53:22.689
He's not smart.

01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:26.852
And there is no video footage of him saying anything profound.

01:53:27.712 --> 01:53:33.956
Actually, Alex Karp is on video saying a few things quite profound that amount to admissions.

01:53:34.356 --> 01:53:42.081
But think about Jeff Bezos and how little he's on camera at all, probably because he never says anything profound.

01:53:45.438 --> 01:53:47.839
These are scripts, these are scripted actors.

01:53:48.259 --> 01:53:49.299
We have been fooled.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.421
Can we talk about the Verstratten study?

01:53:53.941 --> 01:53:54.361
The what?

01:53:54.521 --> 01:53:55.542
The Verstratten study.

01:53:55.862 --> 01:53:57.262
This is the VSD study.

01:54:00.643 --> 01:54:05.125
It's done in 1999 by CDC epidemiologist Thomas Verstratten.

01:54:05.605 --> 01:54:06.305
You know what he found? 11.

01:54:11.667 --> 01:54:17.390
over 11 risk ratio for thimerosal and autism.

01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:18.891
So what did they do?

01:54:19.351 --> 01:54:20.532
They had a secret meeting.

01:54:21.072 --> 01:54:27.315
So again we're talking about autism and thimerosal even though there's no more thimerosal in the schedule since 2001.

01:54:29.076 --> 01:54:57.345
does steve really think that this is a winning argument or is he following a shitty script designed to fail don't forget this is a anti-rfk tour the posters say anti-rfk tour with special guest pierre corey and steve kirsch because these other two characters have been on an anti-jfk tour or rfk tour all around the united states

01:54:59.403 --> 01:55:14.517
So why would Pierre Kory and Steve Kirsch go on a anti-RFK tour and be on stage and allow themselves to be buffoonerized with no prep and no notes and no forethought?

01:55:18.161 --> 01:55:20.063
Unless it was part of the script.

01:55:21.364 --> 01:55:23.366
Unless it's part of the demoralization.

01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:33.419
Because the longer you root for RFK and this fake movement, the more likely it is that you're gonna be dropped on your face.

01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:37.465
This should be the first taste of it for some people.

01:55:38.834 --> 01:55:56.268
But a lot more is coming, and if you don't turn and face the right direction right now, and start telling people that they blew it too, and explaining how they blew it too, explaining why it worked on you one way, but it worked on them the other way, and they think that Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:56.348 --> 01:56:03.294
are acting very uncontrollably, and they're out of our control, and that is falling for it as well.

01:56:04.295 --> 01:56:18.620
because they are national security scripted actors they just do and say what they're told and improvise on that script and they're very good at it that's why they're there because they've been there for like 10 years now

01:56:25.915 --> 01:56:26.715
Oh, Simpson-Wood?

01:56:27.016 --> 01:56:30.597
At Simpson-Wood, right, to talk about how do we massage this?

01:56:30.637 --> 01:56:31.657
How do we tell the public?

01:56:32.277 --> 01:56:47.183
And there were people, there were some quotes, it's a huge transcript, but out of that transcript there are some choice quotes, things like, wow, linear relationship, dose-response relationship, you increase the dose, the association

01:56:47.603 --> 01:56:50.145
He's still talking about thimerosal.

01:56:50.245 --> 01:56:51.166
Keep that in mind.

01:56:51.186 --> 01:56:59.411
Might as well be, you know, shooting an automatic rifle with the trigger pulled and held into his foot and digging a hole.

01:56:59.851 --> 01:57:01.112
Like, it's ridiculous.

01:57:01.333 --> 01:57:01.913
Increases.

01:57:02.333 --> 01:57:07.817
People were aware of that and they talked about, oh shit, you know, we're going to be in huge legal trouble.

01:57:08.037 --> 01:57:09.578
How are we going to message this to the public?

01:57:09.638 --> 01:57:13.040
It's a cute story, but again, thimerosal was taken out of the MMR vaccine in 2001.

01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:13.921
Did autism go down?

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:30.087
but wait a second he found the association so how do you get an 11 to 1 risk how is it possible that steve kirsch is so stupid to be hammering on this unless it's scripted how is it possible

01:57:33.373 --> 01:57:36.274
How has he not mentioned Brian Hooker's Vax Sun Vax book yet?

01:57:36.314 --> 01:57:42.537
How has he not mentioned, you know, the autism case of Hazelhurst?

01:57:42.617 --> 01:57:44.818
And how has he not talked?

01:57:44.838 --> 01:57:52.622
I mean, there are so many different ways that this could have gone and so many different ways that they could have at least addressed things in the right way.

01:57:52.662 --> 01:58:00.746
But of course, now you can see plainly that this whole health freedom movement, this whole anti-vax movement was always fake.

01:58:01.656 --> 01:58:09.578
That's why Brandy Vaughn is dead and her slides about ingestion versus ingestion never made it past her death.

01:58:10.679 --> 01:58:14.340
You know, Brian Hooker didn't pick up that and start teaching it.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.302
Mary Holland never says that on any program that she's ever on because she's scripted.

01:58:21.742 --> 01:58:30.265
She's part of a national security operation full of actors that were put in place before the pandemic.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.361
and are in place now.

01:58:33.022 --> 01:58:39.848
And America is under their spell and a lot of other skilled social media users around the world are under their spell.

01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.412
And it's part of the controlled demolition of America.

01:58:44.452 --> 01:58:49.957
They have to control, demolish the American culture by making us ashamed of who we are.

01:58:50.397 --> 01:58:51.839
And this fraud is part of it.

01:58:53.919 --> 01:58:57.761
on something where there's no cause and effect.

01:58:57.901 --> 01:59:03.564
And why did they have that off-site meeting to talk about it?

01:59:03.644 --> 01:59:06.166
Why did they need to do that if it's just a coincidence?

01:59:09.167 --> 01:59:11.028
Yeah, so... That is data.

01:59:11.048 --> 01:59:14.150
A risk ratio... No, you're spinning a conspiratorial narrative.

01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:15.731
Steve, slow down.

01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:18.392
Let Dan respond to the bullshit that you said.

01:59:18.412 --> 01:59:22.674
You know what the risk ratio is for if you smoke a pack a day and lung cancer?

01:59:22.694 --> 01:59:24.135
Do you know what the risk ratio of that is?

01:59:24.155 --> 01:59:26.356
It's a well-known association.

01:59:26.737 --> 01:59:28.698
Risk ratio is 10 to 1.

01:59:29.438 --> 01:59:31.079
This was 11 to 1.

01:59:31.319 --> 01:59:35.441
So what kind of confounders do they control for in that experiment that you're talking about?

01:59:37.415 --> 01:59:39.956
Oh, why are you trying to scrutinize the bullshit?

01:59:39.976 --> 01:59:42.157
That's a very important research that we try.

01:59:42.177 --> 01:59:46.839
So do you know what kind of confounder, what kind of confounder Dan causes?

01:59:46.919 --> 01:59:56.302
See, it really feels like Pierre is not aware that there is a script here that he, and it's possible that Pierre doesn't really get it.

01:59:56.823 --> 01:59:58.783
It's possible that Pierre doesn't really get it.

02:00:00.424 --> 02:00:02.505
Um, but, but they are scripted to lose.

02:00:03.772 --> 02:00:08.599
And that kind of, what are they, what are the confounders that they test for in that paper?

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.263
It's kind of a funny question.

02:00:11.443 --> 02:00:12.685
It's a legitimate one.

02:00:12.765 --> 02:00:19.475
It's a nitpicky one, but it's funny because again, their reaction is what makes them lose.

02:00:21.351 --> 02:00:25.013
an 11 to 1 odds ratio.

02:00:25.213 --> 02:00:26.574
What's the confounder on that one?

02:00:26.594 --> 02:00:28.155
Steve, do you know what ascertainment bias is?

02:00:28.535 --> 02:00:29.116
Yes, I do.

02:00:29.336 --> 02:00:43.885
So if I were to survey a room full of crotchety old men on, let's say, whether or not they have type 2 diabetes, and then survey a room full of soccer players on the same question, you think that there would be a huge

02:00:44.685 --> 02:00:46.006
risk ratio difference there?

02:00:46.246 --> 02:00:46.586
Of course.

02:00:47.307 --> 02:00:49.968
But what they did is they used... Why?

02:00:50.208 --> 02:00:54.711
They used over 100,000 people in the VSD database.

02:00:54.731 --> 02:01:03.076
They were trying to find out, the whole mission for Stratton was to go and get the data to do the study to discredit

02:01:04.013 --> 02:01:05.734
this whole association.

02:01:06.094 --> 02:01:11.878
Now Verstraeten is very skilled in the art of manipulating numbers in order to make the signal go away.

02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:15.280
He's still talking about the thimerosal paper.

02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:17.182
It's really so stupid.

02:01:17.342 --> 02:01:18.883
And so he went through five rounds.

02:01:18.923 --> 02:01:20.163
It took him four years

02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:25.590
four years, Dan, to make the signal go away.

02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:33.112
And there's a famous email he sent off saying, I can't make the signal go away.

02:01:33.772 --> 02:01:36.933
The title of the subject line was, it won't go away.

02:01:36.973 --> 02:01:37.673
It's a cute story.

02:01:37.693 --> 02:01:38.193
Yeah, I know.

02:01:38.513 --> 02:01:41.914
See how everything relies on anecdotal evidence for you?

02:01:42.334 --> 02:01:48.996
Why isn't there a study from some other country that you can point to that's not under the tyrannical American government that reproduces what you're talking about?

02:01:49.796 --> 02:02:11.644
Dave and Dave and Dan you guys have your final thoughts on this particular topic and then there is one even Pierre get the last word on this topic okay there's one very important point that we didn't bring up and that's diagnostic criteria and I would ask you guys do you have any idea how autism is diagnosed and how that has changed in the past 30 to 40 years yeah how so like how

02:02:14.825 --> 02:02:17.747
Because they want to make the signal go away, so they broadened it.

02:02:17.767 --> 02:02:18.388
No, no, no.

02:02:18.408 --> 02:02:18.468
How?

02:02:18.888 --> 02:02:22.331
They want to make the signal go away, so they broadened it.

02:02:25.613 --> 02:02:42.966
Maybe you could be more specific and better and just say that it's a signal of neurotoxicity and they're calling it and misconstruing it as a genetic environmental disorder.

02:02:44.033 --> 02:02:46.475
when it is just acute toxicity.

02:02:47.316 --> 02:02:55.962
And acute toxicity and acute neurological damage, acute neurological poisoning, his acute neurological poisoning, it's not autism.

02:02:56.362 --> 02:02:59.285
They could have started there, but they didn't.

02:03:00.385 --> 02:03:02.027
And it's by design, it's by script.

02:03:02.087 --> 02:03:06.850
That's the actual script that Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:03:06.930 --> 02:03:10.233
are in charge of and in place for reinforcing.

02:03:11.428 --> 02:03:19.052
The whole damn organization of CHD is not able to make any progress, even if you sit in a Zoom meeting and tell them the progress they could be making.

02:03:20.053 --> 02:03:22.314
You offer to teach an immunology class.

02:03:22.334 --> 02:03:23.535
You offer to do these things.

02:03:23.575 --> 02:03:24.375
They don't want it.

02:03:25.596 --> 02:03:26.877
They've already got their message.

02:03:26.897 --> 02:03:28.478
They're not trying to do that.

02:03:28.538 --> 02:03:38.203
They were building a big top tent of health freedom that's also about the chemtrails and is also about 5G and electromagnetic radiation.

02:03:38.263 --> 02:03:38.884
Don't you see?

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.023
does a professional in the field diagnose autism and how has that changed?

02:03:48.663 --> 02:03:53.386
It's not about whatever data you're trying to talk about.

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:56.248
When was autism spectrum disorder added to the DSM?

02:03:56.488 --> 02:03:58.930
When was autism spectrum disorder added to the DSM?

02:04:01.992 --> 02:04:05.254
When was autism spectrum disorder added to the DSM?

02:04:05.715 --> 02:04:06.575
What, DSM-1?

02:04:06.796 --> 02:04:07.396
Pierre, do you know?

02:04:07.416 --> 02:04:08.637
You were in the medical field.

02:04:08.657 --> 02:04:08.937
Do you know?

02:04:09.217 --> 02:04:09.538
Do you know?

02:04:09.578 --> 02:04:11.319
You were in the medical field.

02:04:11.339 --> 02:04:11.319
1994.

02:04:11.959 --> 02:04:16.863
1994.

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.863
So how do you imagine that impacted... Into the mic there, Pierre.

02:04:20.285 --> 02:04:20.785
Why not?

02:04:20.865 --> 02:04:34.532
Wouldn't it be great if they were able to say that the impetus for testing kids at birth or right after birth and genetically screening them started right after the Genome Project was announced and they kind of encouraged it to start then.

02:04:35.133 --> 02:04:36.874
Again, this is all like

02:04:37.654 --> 02:04:45.824
There's all kinds of opportunities here, but because they're on the shitty script that Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:04:45.884 --> 02:04:53.372
and Del Bigtree and Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield are on, they have no hope of arguing back against these guys.

02:04:54.013 --> 02:04:55.215
It's designed that way.

02:04:57.564 --> 02:04:58.825
I'm not going to do this.

02:04:58.845 --> 02:04:59.526
This is just silly.

02:04:59.606 --> 02:05:02.769
You're not going to talk about one of the most important aspects of this?

02:05:02.789 --> 02:05:03.490
You're not making an argument.

02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:05.051
You're asking me random questions.

02:05:05.111 --> 02:05:06.532
It's not a random question.

02:05:06.572 --> 02:05:09.935
You're saying autism rises correlating with vaccines.

02:05:10.176 --> 02:05:12.578
And I'm telling you that it's just diagnoses.

02:05:12.618 --> 02:05:19.124
Because prior to these diagnostic criteria, level 1 and 2 autistic children were not getting diagnosed.

02:05:19.364 --> 02:05:20.064
And now they are.

02:05:20.245 --> 02:05:21.045
Do you know why I know this?

02:05:21.225 --> 02:05:22.387
Because I have an autistic son.

02:05:23.047 --> 02:05:24.688
See, you know how I know this?

02:05:24.788 --> 02:05:31.211
Because I have an autistic son, who I guess wouldn't have been autistic before these diagnostics were changed.

02:05:31.631 --> 02:05:40.895
But now, I'm lucky enough to have an autistic son that's disabled that I can point to and use as a trump card.

02:05:43.527 --> 02:05:44.468
You know how I know?

02:05:44.568 --> 02:05:46.109
Because I have an autistic son.

02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:53.976
So now you understand why this guy is such a dickhead and why he was so gung-ho about doing what he's done for the last 12 years.

02:05:54.916 --> 02:05:56.418
It's not his love of science.

02:05:57.619 --> 02:06:08.448
He's using a gift of memory to help the system get back at these people that he thinks genuinely are charlatans.

02:06:08.508 --> 02:06:09.488
And that's probably right.

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:12.411
They are, but not in the way that he thinks.

02:06:15.188 --> 02:06:19.433
It's because they got on the train of Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:19.653 --> 02:06:32.047
and Brian Hooker, all these frauds, and adopted their thinking and adopted their arguments and then now are only finding out that they are losing arguments by design.

02:06:34.031 --> 02:06:37.372
Okay, so I know about how this is diagnosed.

02:06:37.452 --> 02:06:38.532
And I'll complete these thoughts.

02:06:40.033 --> 02:06:49.436
Pierre wants us to just... But his son is autistic even though autism is a complex interaction between a hundred some genes and the environment.

02:06:49.836 --> 02:06:54.838
His son is autistic and therefore he knows exactly how the diagnosis is occurring.

02:06:54.858 --> 02:06:56.618
So it's just so stupid.

02:06:57.118 --> 02:06:58.299
It's just so stupid.

02:07:04.022 --> 02:07:08.164
tell him the facts instead of quiz him on what he should know.

02:07:08.204 --> 02:07:09.124
Let me explain.

02:07:09.464 --> 02:07:14.046
So we know that autism is genetic.

02:07:14.066 --> 02:07:17.707
70% to 80% of autism cases are genetic.

02:07:18.047 --> 02:07:21.889
A mountain of data versus bullshit.

02:07:22.009 --> 02:07:26.931
So there are several genome-wide association studies showing that autism is genetic.

02:07:27.151 --> 02:07:32.773
There are several twin and familial studies showing that genetics is an extremely strong component.

02:07:33.713 --> 02:07:42.918
Also, there is data looking at rates of non-profound autism versus profound autism in the past 16 years.

02:07:43.458 --> 02:07:56.005
It has been shown, convincingly, that the lion's share of the increase in autism that RFK says is an epidemic is due to non-profound autism cases, cases that are being caught by the expanded diagnostic criteria.

02:07:57.546 --> 02:07:58.006
in the past.

02:07:58.546 --> 02:08:06.530
Doctors are not looking at kids for 10 seconds and looking for an autism diagnosis because they're flapping their hands or being non-verbal.

02:08:07.130 --> 02:08:08.250
It's expanded.

02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:09.991
It's much more broad than that.

02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:26.518
Which makes the argument that vaccine injury is getting lost in that sea of nonsense, that sea of aspecificity, that sea that lacks fidelity of understanding or even classification.

02:08:29.019 --> 02:08:39.907
And yet, neither Pierre Cory, nor Steve Kirsch, nor Mary Holland, or Meryl Nass, or Robert Malone, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:39.967 --> 02:08:45.951
are able to say it, even after a decade or more of trying to learn it.

02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:48.913
It's scripted failure.

02:08:50.396 --> 02:08:52.217
or catastrophic failure.

02:08:52.237 --> 02:08:53.418
I mean, it could be that too.

02:08:53.558 --> 02:08:56.640
Mary Holland could just be a catastrophic failure.

02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.240
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.222
could be a catastrophic fraud.

02:09:00.742 --> 02:09:04.344
It's possible, but then I don't think they would have gotten as far as they've gotten.

02:09:05.525 --> 02:09:18.532
Being surrounded by all the people they're surrounded by and believed by supposedly all the people they're believed by, that is only explainable by a very elaborate theater and a well-honed script.

02:09:20.004 --> 02:09:22.265
can be functional and autistic.

02:09:22.585 --> 02:09:24.827
That was not recognized 20 years ago.

02:09:25.227 --> 02:09:28.869
Okay, final thoughts on the topic by Pierre and Steve.

02:09:28.929 --> 02:09:34.591
All right, let me say three things about this.

02:09:34.651 --> 02:09:39.334
Kennedy, RFK Juniors, talks very often about this.

02:09:39.774 --> 02:09:44.096
You know, when he was growing up, never saw an autistic kid.

02:09:45.017 --> 02:09:49.299
Today, he still can't find an autistic person of his age.

02:09:50.416 --> 02:09:56.618
That's because the autistic people that you would be talking about that are damaged like that are dead.

02:09:58.118 --> 02:10:00.178
They don't live to be 70 or 80.

02:10:03.459 --> 02:10:09.561
I'm not sure that we can expect Paula Aitken's child, for example, to live to be 70 or 80.

02:10:10.501 --> 02:10:11.221
Bless his heart.

02:10:12.942 --> 02:10:14.222
Because they're sick kids.

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:20.566
And so this is just kind of silly, right?

02:10:20.626 --> 02:10:27.493
It's just kind of silly to talk like this, that there are no autistic kids the age of RFK.

02:10:27.533 --> 02:10:32.538
There are no old people with as many muscles as RFK either.

02:10:32.598 --> 02:10:35.882
He doesn't know anybody else his age that has his musculature.

02:10:35.942 --> 02:10:37.824
But, you know, that's okay, I guess.

02:10:38.404 --> 02:10:39.686
I mean, this is just stupid.

02:10:40.748 --> 02:10:43.270
This is just stupid for so many different reasons.

02:10:43.831 --> 02:10:52.979
Also because, again, it just belies a lack of understanding that these people are just scripted and acting.

02:10:53.059 --> 02:10:56.863
So it's not the diagnostic criteria that has changed.

02:10:57.563 --> 02:11:00.986
So that's definitely knows autistic people his age.

02:11:01.907 --> 02:11:09.132
The second thing is there has never been a before and after study looking at the timing for.

02:11:09.413 --> 02:11:10.914
Did you hear what he said, by the way?

02:11:10.974 --> 02:11:11.594
Did you hear that?

02:11:11.694 --> 02:11:12.215
That's funny.

02:11:15.317 --> 02:11:16.899
Is it really only that far in?

02:11:17.039 --> 02:11:17.459
No way.

02:11:17.479 --> 02:11:18.180
Oh, wow.

02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:18.740
That's great.

02:11:20.081 --> 02:11:25.746
Rapid onset autism, about 25 percent of the cases of autism never saw autistic kid.

02:11:26.738 --> 02:11:31.042
today, he still can't find an autistic person of his age.

02:11:31.943 --> 02:11:35.767
So it's not the diagnostic criteria that has changed.

02:11:36.448 --> 02:11:39.671
So that's, he definitely knows autistic people, his age.

02:11:40.052 --> 02:11:43.135
He definitely knows autistic people, his age.

02:11:43.215 --> 02:11:45.878
So they're actually having an argument.

02:11:47.538 --> 02:11:57.746
about whether or not autism is present in Bobby Kennedy's age group, even though they don't themselves agree on the definition of autism.

02:11:59.087 --> 02:12:11.537
One guy thinks that autism can be a verbal and normal person with lack of eye contact or maybe ADHD or some other bullshit, whatever his son has.

02:12:13.376 --> 02:12:17.179
And that's autism, just like, just like other people's autism.

02:12:17.219 --> 02:12:18.319
It's all the same.

02:12:18.339 --> 02:12:20.141
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:12:22.963 --> 02:12:26.045
And both sides are just as stupid as the other.

02:12:26.085 --> 02:12:27.666
It's just a mirror image of them.

02:12:28.867 --> 02:12:29.948
It's remarkable to me.

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:34.471
I actually thought Dave would do better, but Dave is really obviously a scripted buffoon.

02:12:35.413 --> 02:12:43.516
And his links to the Weinsteins now really make complete sense if I listen to his lack of nuance here, lack of insight.

02:12:43.536 --> 02:12:48.098
This is really a high school senior level argument at best.

02:12:48.178 --> 02:12:51.899
And these guys are losing to a high school senior in biology.

02:12:51.979 --> 02:12:52.720
It's kind of sad.

02:12:54.301 --> 02:13:03.128
The second thing is there has never been a before and after study looking at the timing for rapid-onset autism.

02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:09.614
About 25% of the cases of autism, plus or minus, happen very rapidly, within a week.

02:13:10.154 --> 02:13:19.903
Did you know that every single case that we can find, about, sorry, at least 80% of those cases happen within... 20%, 80%, you know, this is all bullshit!

02:13:23.322 --> 02:13:25.283
He's not doing anyone any favors.

02:13:26.363 --> 02:13:28.763
He's hurting everybody whose side he's on.

02:13:28.803 --> 02:13:34.665
It's like when Laura Loomer opens her mouth and discredits everybody that follows her.

02:13:35.085 --> 02:13:40.306
When Alex Jones opened his mouth and everybody that follows him is discredited.

02:13:40.366 --> 02:13:43.047
That's the same thing that's happening here right now.

02:13:43.487 --> 02:13:44.868
And it's by design.

02:13:46.128 --> 02:13:49.629
We've got to call these people the criminals and the frauds that they are.

02:13:51.001 --> 02:13:57.209
because they are part of the same fraud that the other side didn't see through.

02:13:58.351 --> 02:14:06.482
They are part of the same fraud that drove all of our family and friends to believe in the virus, to believe in the panic.

02:14:07.323 --> 02:14:08.725
These people were in on it too.

02:14:10.592 --> 02:14:12.213
two sides of the same coin.

02:14:12.954 --> 02:14:16.516
It's just that right now, the red team has been set up to fail.

02:14:16.937 --> 02:14:19.398
See it for what it is and get out while you can.

02:14:19.919 --> 02:14:25.083
A week after a vaccine, 20% happen a week before the vaccine.

02:14:25.503 --> 02:14:34.610
So if it's not related to the vaccine, then why are 80% of those cases happening after a vaccine rather than

02:14:35.370 --> 02:14:56.628
right the week before nobody's been able to explain that nobody in the world has ever done that study and they never will because they don't want to know the truth and that's the most important thing that you should know about this and the third thing is that when William Thompson who led the CDC study

02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:00.503
on autism and linking it with vaccines.

02:15:00.763 --> 02:15:01.804
And they found a link.

02:15:02.165 --> 02:15:02.945
You know what happened?

02:15:03.206 --> 02:15:06.329
His bosses told him, destroy that.

02:15:06.529 --> 02:15:09.373
That's the story that Brian Hooker was given.

02:15:10.373 --> 02:15:13.595
That's the story that Brian Hooker was gonna be the whistleblower on.

02:15:13.635 --> 02:15:17.118
That's the story that Brian Hooker has been the whistleblower in the past.

02:15:17.698 --> 02:15:20.820
And this looks like a substitution of Steve Kirsch for him.

02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:23.982
And it's a terrible failure and I called it two years ago.

02:15:24.503 --> 02:15:28.786
Now they're gonna bring this up as if this is further evidence of covering up the evidence.

02:15:29.466 --> 02:15:31.709
Ladies and gentlemen, the trap is closing.

02:15:31.809 --> 02:15:33.150
Get out while you can.

02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:34.532
Steve Kirsch is a fraud.

02:15:35.013 --> 02:15:36.514
Pierre Cory is a fraud.

02:15:36.614 --> 02:15:37.936
Robert Malone is a fraud.

02:15:38.437 --> 02:15:39.618
RFK is a fraud.

02:15:39.718 --> 02:15:41.160
Jay Bhattacharya is a fraud.

02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:42.902
Jessica Rose was a fraud.

02:15:43.322 --> 02:15:45.445
They are all scripted frauds.

02:15:46.909 --> 02:15:48.449
Traitors to our grandchildren.

02:15:48.509 --> 02:15:54.011
So it will never see the light of day and let's publish the paper as if we had never seen that link.

02:15:54.271 --> 02:15:56.172
Stories and lies, data.

02:15:56.752 --> 02:15:59.913
This is how corrupt the CDC has been.

02:16:00.333 --> 02:16:02.734
Thompson was called to testify in front of Congress.

02:16:03.094 --> 02:16:07.715
He was subpoenaed to answer questions.

02:16:07.975 --> 02:16:10.356
Imagine if they were to have started right here.

02:16:11.056 --> 02:16:30.716
with autism spectrum disorder being an elaborate myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason, and that we think that pandemics and gain-of-function viruses are also myths used to accomplish the exact same bullshit.

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:43.469
And so yes, we are against vaccines, but if specifically we're against the intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to augment the immune system, because the immune system is much more than antibodies.

02:16:48.248 --> 02:16:57.033
Recognize that the modern biology assumes the central dogma rather than testing it while it has never been proven by beyond its most basic formulation.

02:16:57.633 --> 02:17:03.917
Identify new foundations of molecular and systemic complexity upon which to base models of understanding.

02:17:04.417 --> 02:17:05.477
And here's a good start.

02:17:05.878 --> 02:17:11.981
We need to reimagine the immune system as a molecular and cellular interface with our own microbiome.

02:17:13.646 --> 02:17:22.330
We also need to imagine that mitochondria are part of that microbiome, because they probably are, at least insofar as regulation and cellular communication by phage, etc.

02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:28.673
And reimagine the development as an opportunity for optimization and maximization of inherited potential.

02:17:29.393 --> 02:17:44.844
Rather than inherited potential being already predetermined and just a reading of a tape which it certainly is not We are a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time and that's how we get out of this bad biology And we also must recognize it for many of us.

02:17:45.545 --> 02:17:58.474
It's it's shocking You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails

02:17:59.861 --> 02:18:00.961
There's no consent.

02:18:02.782 --> 02:18:04.342
I can't listen to Malone anymore.

02:18:04.422 --> 02:18:05.943
Look, they knew that this was coming.

02:18:06.203 --> 02:18:16.286
It was a background, a very complex background that Nathan Wolf had been grifting on for a long time, that Peter Daszak was out there designed to make it seem like we knew what was back there.

02:18:16.666 --> 02:18:19.927
And in the meantime, this biological signal was on its way.

02:18:19.947 --> 02:18:23.969
A biological signal that you can actually see it.

02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:25.169
You can see it right there.

02:18:26.890 --> 02:18:27.690
See it rising.

02:18:29.424 --> 02:18:30.504
Ooh, look at it coming.

02:18:31.045 --> 02:18:31.925
They saw it coming.

02:18:32.525 --> 02:18:34.346
They saw it coming around the world.

02:18:35.326 --> 02:18:41.087
And once these people retired and stopped paying taxes, well, I mean, how are we going to manage all those people?

02:18:41.548 --> 02:18:45.789
How are we going to manage this population pyramid, which was the same all around the Western world?

02:18:45.809 --> 02:18:50.510
Well, we managed it with a bunch of sculpting, manslaughter, and lies.

02:18:51.791 --> 02:18:56.352
That anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is invisible even in the CDC data.

02:18:57.455 --> 02:18:59.676
We've got a whole list of ways that they sculpted it.

02:19:00.277 --> 02:19:19.009
Supplementary oxygen being number one and probably the primary reason why Pierre Cory, the textbook writer on emergency medicine or critical care medicine was recruited because he would be present to bullshit about 60 liters of pure oxygen a minute being something that could be used.

02:19:20.979 --> 02:19:24.002
Anybody that's risen into clear view is an actor in this theater.

02:19:24.062 --> 02:19:35.292
This theater is about a 15 year, an orchestrated 15 years, 10 years of extreme full court press, and then five years of insanity.

02:19:37.234 --> 02:19:39.156
It's a two-party theater, ladies and gentlemen.

02:19:39.196 --> 02:19:44.921
If you accept that, then you can also see how social media has been militarized using podcast actors.

02:19:44.941 --> 02:19:47.043
And they just go from podcast to podcast.

02:19:48.447 --> 02:20:02.506
talking shit and saying the narrative and asking the dumb questions about pandemics and public health and climate change and religion and morality and parental rights and responsibilities and relevant threats to our democracy and what it means to be liberal or conservative.

02:20:03.127 --> 02:20:04.188
That's Robert Malone.

02:20:05.236 --> 02:20:07.519
That's Sasha Latipova and her daughter, Soph.

02:20:07.559 --> 02:20:08.641
That's Alex Jones.

02:20:08.701 --> 02:20:10.664
That's Brett Weinstein.

02:20:10.704 --> 02:20:13.087
That's all these people.

02:20:13.568 --> 02:20:15.911
The list is endless, all the way to Candace Owens.

02:20:16.512 --> 02:20:19.256
I mean, it's Charlie Kirk.

02:20:19.437 --> 02:20:20.178
It's all of them.

02:20:23.652 --> 02:20:28.234
And so if they rose into clear view, then they rose into clear view by permission, by design.

02:20:28.274 --> 02:20:30.515
They are need-to-know basis scripted actors.

02:20:31.155 --> 02:20:32.456
Trump's shooting was fake.

02:20:32.536 --> 02:20:39.539
I don't think there's any reason why Steve Kerr, sorry, what was his name?

02:20:39.659 --> 02:20:45.021
Charlie Kirk's shooting couldn't also have been faked, but I just don't care because they're all actors.

02:20:45.081 --> 02:20:48.503
And if necessary, they'd take an actor off stage with a bullet, no problem.

02:20:49.534 --> 02:20:59.299
But they'd also fake a shooting like they did with Donald Trump an hour north of here and blame it on a high school kid that supposedly went to the same high school as my kid, which is just bullshit.

02:21:00.619 --> 02:21:02.960
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is one of those things.

02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:06.722
It's also a myth, both as a process and an endpoint.

02:21:08.163 --> 02:21:10.584
You know, they just used a background and confused us about it.

02:21:13.542 --> 02:21:14.022
I don't know.

02:21:14.042 --> 02:21:17.344
I'm getting tired of saying it, but it's true.

02:21:17.604 --> 02:21:21.325
Get yourself and your children off social media now because this is for all the marbles.

02:21:21.526 --> 02:21:24.307
This is for the children of Earth.

02:21:24.407 --> 02:21:25.507
These are hamster wheels.

02:21:25.567 --> 02:21:26.228
Don't believe them.

02:21:26.288 --> 02:21:27.348
Just try to get out of them.

02:21:28.188 --> 02:21:29.149
Hoo-ha, I'm tired.

02:21:29.189 --> 02:21:30.449
I wish I was going to the beach.

02:21:30.529 --> 02:21:31.490
Wow, that's kind of nice.

02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:32.911
I guess you're on the West Coast.

02:21:35.526 --> 02:21:37.468
Get out of the hamster wheels, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:37.488 --> 02:21:42.153
Get your family and friends out of the hamster wheels by throwing down a ladder.

02:21:43.214 --> 02:21:48.901
Hopefully I still can catch the famdamily awake on Friday night.

02:21:52.267 --> 02:21:53.288
Your children are trapped.

02:21:53.348 --> 02:21:53.909
You're trapped.

02:21:53.949 --> 02:21:54.770
But we can get out.

02:21:54.991 --> 02:21:55.431
We can.

02:21:55.451 --> 02:21:56.733
I'm going to get to bed.

02:21:57.414 --> 02:21:58.636
Thanks for using PeerTube.

02:21:58.716 --> 02:21:59.677
It's working really well.

02:21:59.737 --> 02:22:00.458
Thanks for being there.

02:22:00.498 --> 02:22:04.443
I'll change the thumbnail as quick as I can once it gets rendered.

02:22:05.465 --> 02:22:06.246
Thanks for being here.

02:22:07.767 --> 02:22:10.568
I'll try to get on on the weekend, but I can't promise anything.

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:17.131
We have basketball tryouts on Monday again and If there's nice weather, there's stuff to do in the backyard.

02:22:17.272 --> 02:22:30.277
I don't know for sure but I'm gonna try and get this the pace and the consistency up a little bit and Make it easier for V to give you a notification that means something So thanks very much for being here.

02:22:30.297 --> 02:22:31.078
Thanks for your patience.

02:22:31.658 --> 02:22:34.999
That's been a great week and Hopefully next week will be a better one.

02:22:35.039 --> 02:22:35.600
Thanks for being here
