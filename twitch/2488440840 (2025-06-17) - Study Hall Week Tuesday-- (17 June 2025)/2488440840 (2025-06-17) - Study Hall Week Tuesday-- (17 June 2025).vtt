WEBVTT

00:06.027 --> 00:09.270
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.963
I have no responsibility for the current.

00:24.704 --> 00:25.385
Stop lying.

00:25.585 --> 00:26.286
Stop lying.

00:39.969 --> 00:41.230
I have no responsibility.

01:09.349 --> 01:10.690
Testing one, two, test.

01:11.290 --> 01:12.211
Test one, two.

01:13.911 --> 01:14.852
Good morning everybody.

01:14.912 --> 01:15.712
Welcome to the show.

01:15.772 --> 01:19.814
Just let me get everything set up here and I'm going to watch a video right away.

01:20.655 --> 01:27.559
Plugging a good guy in the grand scheme of things first and then we'll pick up where we left off yesterday.

01:27.619 --> 01:28.339
Thanks for being here.

01:36.363 --> 01:46.851
When we tour bases, you see pieces of equipment that can be upwards of two, three million dollars that will be unused for a year at a time because it's something that we can 3D print for a cost of $2 to $20.

01:47.031 --> 01:52.436
The American soldiers see that and they're not able to use it and that is incredibly demoralizing.

01:52.636 --> 01:53.436
I need your help.

01:53.557 --> 02:00.082
We are at a very unique inflection point in the United States where right to repair and right to own can be brought into the public consciousness in a very big way.

02:00.382 --> 02:05.186
What I've noticed over the past 13 years is that nobody cares about your problems and they most certainly don't care about mine.

02:05.646 --> 02:07.767
People care about problems when they're personally affected by them.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.669
I can talk about right-to-repair until I'm blue in the face, nobody gives a shit.

02:10.969 --> 02:18.573
I talked to a senator who was told by the Genius Bar they have to spend $900 to fix their computer when the only issue with it is a broken fan, and that's a senator co-sponsoring a right-to-repair bill.

02:18.813 --> 02:21.214
People care about problems when they're personally affected by those problems.

02:21.534 --> 02:36.686
And right now, people are being personally affected by those problems that are much more powerful and influential than you or I. That is at the Army and the Navy within the United States, and we are starting to get some traction, not just in the House, but also in the Senate, where people are just listening to these stories, and they are aggravated by them.

02:36.726 --> 02:41.510
I want you to listen to this piece of testimony while the United States Secretary of the Navy is speaking to the Senate Armed Services Committee.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.671
What we do makes no sense to me.

02:44.212 --> 02:44.632
Okay.

02:44.772 --> 02:48.674
And so I am a huge supporter of right to repair.

02:48.895 --> 02:50.936
I went on the Ford carrier.

02:51.496 --> 02:52.737
They had eight ovens.

02:53.157 --> 02:57.040
This is a ship that serves 15,300 meals a day.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.741
Only two were working, six were out.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.603
And I said, you've got 5,300 people on the ship.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.055
You're telling me someone can't fix an oven?

03:06.135 --> 03:07.255
We got a lot of engineers.

03:07.695 --> 03:10.316
We can, but we need to wait for the contractor to get out.

03:10.477 --> 03:13.018
I asked the question about our elevators.

03:13.038 --> 03:14.658
If an elevator go out, what happens?

03:15.199 --> 03:16.559
We've got to call Huntington.

03:16.919 --> 03:18.660
They've got to call the four other people.

03:18.980 --> 03:22.842
They have to come out and diagnose the problem, and then they'll fix it.

03:23.562 --> 03:24.342
It is crazy.

03:25.143 --> 03:26.403
We should be able to fix this.

03:26.664 --> 03:37.049
We need to really try to ensure going forward we control our IP and we have the ability to fix things because if we're in a fight, how do we not, how do we fix it then?

03:37.269 --> 03:40.691
Senator, I agree we need to repair, I have the right to repair our ship.

03:40.731 --> 03:48.915
Do you support Congress passing a law that will help you negotiate repair rights at a fair and reasonable price?

03:49.665 --> 03:50.165
Yes, I do.

03:50.185 --> 03:50.606
Okay.

03:50.666 --> 03:51.907
You hear the tone in his voice?

03:52.087 --> 03:53.368
You hear how much he dislikes this?

03:53.428 --> 03:56.110
Now listen to the Secretary of the Army speaking to the House Armed Services Committee.

03:56.290 --> 03:59.873
I kind of talk about this line of effort, which has strong bipartisan support.

03:59.913 --> 04:05.537
Monopolies and corporate abuses of power in our defense sector have undermined our military readiness.

04:05.697 --> 04:11.842
They have been a prolific driver of waste, fraud, and abuse, and they've really hurt American small businesses.

04:12.122 --> 04:20.907
You, Secretary Driscoll, have prioritized one of the most pernicious corporate practices, the monopolization of repair in the Army Transformation Initiative.

04:20.947 --> 04:30.532
You have committed to ensuring that existing or future contract is going to include a right to repair for our military and our service members.

04:30.572 --> 04:31.052
Is that right?

04:31.753 --> 04:39.217
Very explicitly, Congresswoman, on a go-forward basis, we have been directed to not sign any contracts that don't give us a right to repair.

04:39.855 --> 04:44.979
On a go-back basis, we have been directed to go and do what we can to go get that right to repair.

04:45.419 --> 04:55.727
And I can say on a personal, how important I think this is, we hope that anyone listening to us who hopes to pitch us a contract going forward will look back at their previous agreements they've signed with us.

04:56.067 --> 05:00.030
And if they're unwilling to give us that right to repair, I think we're going to have a hard time negotiating with them.

05:00.150 --> 05:04.814
When we tour bases, you see pieces of equipment that can be upwards of two, three million dollars.

05:05.234 --> 05:10.257
that will be unused for a year at a time because it's something that we can 3D print for a cost of $2 to $20.

05:10.497 --> 05:20.322
And beyond just the sinfulness of not using that asset, the American soldiers see that and they're not able to use it and that is incredibly demoralizing.

05:20.722 --> 05:24.144
And so this is a virtuous cycle that I think benefits us in a lot of ways.

05:24.504 --> 05:32.408
And can you commit that you'll work with this committee on a bipartisan basis to codify a right to repair for our military and service members?

05:32.688 --> 05:37.712
I can commit that it is an incredibly important topic and I would do whatever I can personally and in this role to help.

05:54.102 --> 06:12.850
sorry about that now the reason why i'm doing this video is because i really like this guy and i'm really i just want to promote lewis and his work and i respect what he's done but i don't think he sees that actually he's fighting against exactly the same kind of a theater that we are facing

06:13.610 --> 06:40.795
with the pandemic but on a much smaller and more micro scale because it only requires a few people to perform in order for him to feel like something's happening and people are listening and there was a hearing and stuff like that but he doesn't seem to realize that this lack of progress is is built into the system it's by design there he's being undermined now if that happens on such a

06:42.935 --> 06:48.501
A scale is this on an issue like this, understand one thing and one thing very clearly.

06:49.081 --> 07:05.698
If it wasn't for this one guy, this one guy from New York, making a YouTube channel about repairing MacBooks, none of what you just saw would even be happening.

07:06.559 --> 07:13.628
None of the theater of, oh, right to repair is something that we care about and our military should fight for it after the whole...

07:17.216 --> 07:30.267
How much of the deficit that America is supposedly in is a result of the absolute incompetence with which our DoD has been run for the last 40 years?

07:30.988 --> 07:41.357
How is it possible that there are people on the internet that are claiming that the COVID vaccine and the COVID narrative and the whole COVID operation was in a US DoD operation?

07:42.017 --> 07:50.210
Like that doesn't even make any sense in an organization that's so screwed up that they can't even fix their own ovens on a ship.

07:52.274 --> 07:54.618
They can't fix their own elevators on a ship.

07:56.874 --> 08:01.719
I mean, this guy is one of the only Americans fighting for this.

08:01.779 --> 08:04.502
And if it wasn't for him, this whole issue would disappear.

08:04.922 --> 08:09.127
And the whole theater in the government wouldn't even be happening.

08:09.147 --> 08:15.713
And that one representative might be the only person who's doing anything to respond to Lewis.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.216
And other than that, those two people, it's it.

08:21.069 --> 08:48.151
And what I am imploring you to understand is that besides Mark and I and maybe Joe Marshall, there's nobody else on the internet that is trying to move the ball forward with respect to the murder and lies that were committed in America in order to bamboozle the world about the existence of and the necessary responses to a global RNA pandemic.

08:51.724 --> 08:53.025
It's the same nonsense.

08:53.945 --> 08:56.486
And it's an emergency, just like you hear in the background.

08:57.447 --> 09:16.155
There should be sirens on all the time because this theater has now become so macabre and so malevolent that they have a whole cadre of theatrical performers on the internet that are there to assure that the useful resistance

09:17.079 --> 09:24.204
to the mythologies that they use to govern us never ever amount to anything.

09:25.925 --> 09:29.647
Much in the same way that they have successfully neutralized this dude.

09:32.809 --> 09:35.931
And what you see here is the result of only one dude.

09:36.511 --> 09:40.974
If it wasn't for this one dude, there'd be nothing about right to repair.

09:42.195 --> 09:43.676
I assure you, there'd be nothing.

09:44.741 --> 09:48.925
This guy's YouTube channel is the only reason why any of that shit's going through.

09:49.025 --> 09:53.869
And it might not go through, and then he'll whine about it for another five years because he's that committed.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.095
And that's why I think he's worth promoting.

10:00.775 --> 10:07.061
Because if people believe what they say, their actions should belie that.

10:09.266 --> 10:31.153
And what's happening in the health freedom movement right now is a bunch of people are talking all kinds of shit, and they've been talking it for a very long time, but it doesn't seem like the stuff that comes out of their mouth is congruent with the stuff that their body does, with the stuff that they put in their slide decks, with the actions that they've taken over the past 10 or 15 years.

10:31.174 --> 10:35.295
There's no, this guy's track record of unblemished

10:36.676 --> 10:52.543
Integrity is there on the internet to see this guy's been fighting, his arguments have evolved, his understanding of the issue has evolved, and his narrowing it down to very small talking points has really made him annoying to them.

10:54.163 --> 10:55.444
And so I promote Lewis.

10:55.664 --> 10:57.145
I think you should support Lewis.

10:57.205 --> 11:00.186
And if you believe in what he's fighting for, which is freedom,

11:02.415 --> 11:06.357
not indentured servitude, like you buy something but it's not really yours.

11:07.018 --> 11:12.501
That's the model that would otherwise be already the default.

11:12.601 --> 11:21.006
If it wasn't for this one dude, and if it wasn't for Mark Kulak, none of us would know anything about Robert Malone.

11:22.824 --> 11:28.128
If it wasn't for Mark Kulak, none of us would know who Hilary Koprowski was in a useful way.

11:28.609 --> 11:31.791
None of us would know who Joshua Lederberg is in a useful way.

11:32.352 --> 11:52.328
And if it wasn't for me, there'd be almost no one on the internet usefully questioning both the Scooby-Doo, which is the trick about a lab leak coverup, and the theater surrounding that to make as many people as possible to believe that that's not only possible, that's probably what happened, so we should put Fauci in jail.

11:53.578 --> 11:57.700
but also this little nonsense cadre over here that says there are no viruses at all.

11:59.381 --> 12:07.785
Without backing it up with a alternative model of understanding most of what we know of biology, but just in a different way.

12:08.625 --> 12:13.208
The only one who's even attempted to do that, that's still alive and kicking is me.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.449
And I'm not trying to toot my own horn.

12:16.910 --> 12:21.232
What I'm trying to do is show you how desperate the situation is.

12:22.039 --> 12:26.402
You want to go right to repair on social media?

12:26.462 --> 12:27.403
This is your guy.

12:27.823 --> 12:28.784
There's nobody else.

12:29.585 --> 12:30.846
He defined the movement.

12:31.386 --> 12:36.650
You want to go anti-COVID, anti-pandemic narrative?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.371
I'm the only guy you got.

12:38.831 --> 12:40.553
Everybody else is in on it.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.355
I'll let Lewis continue.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.687
This was from the Secretary of the Army a few months ago.

12:49.007 --> 12:50.127
This is in a memo.

12:50.248 --> 12:53.370
It says, identify and propose contract modifications for right to repair provisions.

12:53.890 --> 12:57.352
And there's also a bill that has recently been brought up.

12:57.572 --> 12:59.774
This, unfortunately, I believe had a no vote on it.

13:00.334 --> 13:01.535
This didn't really go anywhere.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.016
This was in December of 2024.

13:04.136 --> 13:06.558
However, we are going to be getting a new one soon.

13:06.978 --> 13:15.604
This is something that I'm very, very happy about because there's a lot of waste in the military budget when it comes to right to repair or just in being able to source things in general.

13:17.365 --> 13:20.407
7,493% markup on a soap dispenser.

13:20.427 --> 13:21.028
$71 for a pin.

13:21.789 --> 13:39.883
There are two senators that could not be further opposites from each other, Tim Sheehy and Elizabeth Warren, and they are going to be proposing a bipartisan bill that I would like to get some support behind because if we can get right to repair in the military, then maybe it's easier to start shifting the culture and getting more people to understand the issue and actually start getting right to repair for normal devices.

13:39.963 --> 13:40.904
This is a sad article.

13:41.044 --> 13:44.367
The inside story of how the Navy spent billions on a little crappy ship.

13:44.947 --> 13:47.309
Like, this is, it's just, it's just bad.

13:47.550 --> 13:48.470
It's all bad.

13:48.591 --> 14:00.501
I would like to see this bill gain some traction, because A, I'm a taxpayer, which means I don't like seeing the military budget go up by $300 billion and not having a clue what the hell we're getting for it, and B, I like the idea of being able to fix what we bought and paid for.

14:00.782 --> 14:10.591
If people that own wheelchairs can fix their stuff, if people that fix medical devices can fix their stuff, if people that own farms can fix tractors, if people can fix their military equipment, it all bodes better for right to repair as a whole.

14:10.811 --> 14:13.472
At the end of the day, we're all under the same umbrella and we're all getting fucked.

14:13.552 --> 14:16.954
If I stop my brother from getting screwed, I too one day may stop getting screwed.

14:17.214 --> 14:17.895
That's the way I see it.

14:18.235 --> 14:21.156
If you take a look, this is going to be a bit of an uphill battle.

14:21.216 --> 14:27.840
It's going to require some convincing because when you see the people donating to the politicians on these armed services committees, we got Lockheed Martin, need I say more?

14:28.140 --> 14:31.863
some of the names you may not be familiar with, Huntington Ingalls, primary builder of U.S.

14:31.923 --> 14:38.168
Navy aircraft carriers and submarines, which you may have heard the Secretary of the Navy mention there, Siemens Composites, manufacturer of advanced composites for U.S.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.170
military vessels, General Dynamics, top UF5 U.S.

14:41.190 --> 14:46.534
defense contractors, APAC, I'm not even gonna fucking get into that one in this video.

14:46.594 --> 14:57.163
Needless to say, they are gonna need some convincing if they are going to vote yes on this, and at the end of the day, no matter how much money they get towards their re-election campaign from these companies, they don't get voted into office unless you vote for them.

14:57.543 --> 15:05.705
So what I would like you all to do, if you could help me, go to the video description, scroll down, you're going to see a list of names, and then you're going to see URLs to how you can contact them.

15:05.945 --> 15:09.766
What you're going to do is, A, you're going to go, do I live in any of these states?

15:10.286 --> 15:11.487
If you do, you click.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.247
B, you are going to then take their contact information.

15:14.607 --> 15:16.868
And then C, you are going to write them something.

15:16.928 --> 15:18.788
You are going to say something along the lines of this.

15:19.349 --> 15:20.629
Dear Senator whatever the hell,

15:21.369 --> 15:22.349
I believe in right to repair.

15:22.770 --> 15:25.450
Right to repair says that you should be able to fix what you bought and paid for.

15:25.851 --> 15:27.171
This is being taken away everywhere.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.392
I can't fix what I bought and paid for, and now the military can't either.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.193
We don't like fraud, waste, and abuse.

15:32.393 --> 15:34.594
We are trying to find ways to cut down on fraud, waste, and abuse.

15:35.214 --> 15:38.955
Being able to fix things means not wasting billions of dollars on things that are not working.

15:39.455 --> 15:41.716
I would like to see right to repair for the military.

15:42.256 --> 15:42.796
I believe in this.

15:43.276 --> 15:50.299
Kindly let me know how you will be voting on this one or two months from now when a bill comes out so that I know how to vote in the next primary or general election.

15:50.799 --> 15:52.421
Thank you very much, have a nice day.

16:09.617 --> 16:10.678
It doesn't have to be genius.

16:10.718 --> 16:11.898
It doesn't have to be eight pages.

16:12.159 --> 16:13.099
Just something very simple.

16:13.519 --> 16:14.640
I am a voter in your district.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.041
I believe in right to repair.

16:16.461 --> 16:18.882
I do not like to see that the military is getting screwed in this way.

16:19.383 --> 16:21.224
I see that there is a right to repair bill coming up.

16:21.584 --> 16:22.725
I would like to know how you are voting.

16:22.985 --> 16:23.725
I hope you vote yes.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.046
Signed, a voter.

16:26.867 --> 16:27.988
I'm gonna ask you to do that for me.

16:28.448 --> 16:30.929
Because that's the only way that this is gonna get any better.

16:31.009 --> 16:34.932
Something I've noticed, and I know a lot of people are gonna say, eh, push back, but it is true.

16:35.052 --> 16:38.314
Politicians will actually vote the way that their constituents want them to vote.

16:38.939 --> 16:42.860
The problem is that nobody shows up and tells them this, so they just don't care.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.841
Most of the rights repair hearings I've been to, there's two people there.

16:46.861 --> 16:49.302
There's like me, Nathan Proctor, and one other dude.

16:49.662 --> 16:51.102
And sometimes there's just nobody there to begin with.

16:51.422 --> 17:00.565
So when you have 15 lobbyists that show up that explain why it is they should not do something, and they are coming from all of these different groups because they are very well organized.

17:02.591 --> 17:05.315
And then you have us, with nobody who shows up.

17:05.675 --> 17:06.356
Who do you think wins?

17:06.997 --> 17:08.298
Look at the lies that they are telling here.

17:08.399 --> 17:09.760
Like one of the things that I found interesting.

17:18.231 --> 17:22.833
Many large OEMs do not sell parts directly, but rather rely on authorized dealers to serve customers in their local communities.

17:23.193 --> 17:30.476
Section 828's price mandates on OEMs would ultimately fall on these dealers, significantly altering the economics of the dealer distribution model by effectively eliminating dealer margins.

17:30.796 --> 17:40.080
This would harm the network of manufacturers and authorized dealers, many of whom are small and medium-sized businesses that the Department ultimately relies on, compromising the very readiness this provision is ostensibly intended to enhance.

17:40.998 --> 17:41.878
This is complete bullshit.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.681
When I talk about what the issues are in my industry, I don't want to pay $1,000 for a motherboard.

17:45.901 --> 17:47.381
I want to pay $15 for the broken chip.

17:47.822 --> 17:54.185
When I pay $15 for the broken chip, Mouser, who has bought that chip for $1 from Texas Instruments, is happy to sell it to me for $15 because they make them $15.

17:54.806 --> 18:01.069
Texas Instruments, who's making that chip for $0.02, is happy to sell it to Mouser.com for $1 because that means that they have just made 1,000% profit.

18:01.349 --> 18:06.332
It is very, very simple for there to be a supply chain where people are making money and

18:06.792 --> 18:08.393
people are able to fix their products.

18:08.473 --> 18:09.693
Most likely, they are lying.

18:09.813 --> 18:15.095
And if they are not lying, that means that we have a completely fucked supply chain that needs to change.

18:15.255 --> 18:22.478
I guarantee you the more that you dig into any of these individual issues and investigate them, you will find fraud, waste, abuse, and bullshit.

18:22.578 --> 18:30.121
The next thing I'm gonna ask you is if you are a member of the military that has experience with how any of these repair issues have affected readiness, email me.

18:30.461 --> 18:31.702
YouTube at RossmanGroup.com.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.003
I'm going to include the email down below.

18:33.243 --> 18:36.426
I'm going to ask for information from you because I'm going to want to write up articles on this.

18:36.766 --> 18:44.112
Pushing this forward is going to help a group of people that are also going to be able to help me when it comes to other right to repair and right to own issues that I bring up on this channel.

18:44.632 --> 18:49.136
The Fulu Foundation that I announced starting in this video is a foundation that's looking to restore ownership.

18:49.396 --> 18:54.280
There are laws in this country that make it illegal to break a lock in what you bought and paid for, a digital lock.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.121
That is insane.

18:55.161 --> 18:57.083
There should not be digital locks on what you bought and paid for.

18:57.383 --> 19:03.429
And if there are, you should have the ability and the right to reverse engineer those locks and get around them, because that is freedom.

19:03.929 --> 19:05.071
We don't have that freedom right now.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.692
It's a freedom that's been taken away from us.

19:06.933 --> 19:12.858
And I'm working as hard as I can to get that freedom back, which means making friends with people who are like-minded, who want to do this type of stuff.

19:13.039 --> 19:14.040
Now, I know what some of you are going to say.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.862
Elizabeth Warren, Tim Sheehy, I don't like it.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.985
I don't give a fuck what you like, bro.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.887
I don't fucking care.

19:22.227 --> 19:27.491
The military budget goes up 20 to 50 billion fucking dollars every year, and what do we get for it?

19:27.832 --> 19:28.252
Nothing.

19:28.472 --> 19:34.577
We get broken shit while military contractors get richer and richer off of the backs of ordinary average everyday taxpayers.

19:34.977 --> 19:35.618
It's bullshit.

19:36.078 --> 19:41.142
Do you want to cry about the fact that you don't like the person writing the bill, or do you want to help us fix it?

19:41.903 --> 19:46.264
These two politicians could not be at each other's throats over more issues if they tried.

19:46.784 --> 19:53.446
But they are coming together here because it doesn't matter where you are on the political spectrum in the United States of America or the world.

19:53.766 --> 19:58.307
You know that a 7,000% markup on a soap dispenser is bullshit.

19:58.727 --> 20:05.029
You know that you should not have a ship that serves food to over 5,000 people that has over 70% of its stoves out of order.

20:10.131 --> 20:10.671
That's insane.

20:10.751 --> 20:19.694
The same thing that I've been talking about on this channel, when it comes to cell phones and MacBooks and everything else, is a microcosm of what's been happening in the overall world.

20:19.854 --> 20:21.074
And I want to try and do something about it.

20:21.094 --> 20:26.055
In starting this new Fulu Foundation that I talked about here, we're not just going over right to repair, we're going over right to own.

20:26.355 --> 20:31.597
We're going at the heart of laws that make it illegal to break a digital lock in which you bought and paid for.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.397
Something that just makes me sick.

20:33.457 --> 20:35.798
The idea that reverse engineering or math can be illegal.

20:36.118 --> 20:48.924
There's a lot of work that we have to do over the next five to six years if we're truly going to get ownership back as a society, culturally and legislatively, which means making friends with people who are doing this type of work so that they are going to help us when we need it.

20:51.778 --> 20:54.700
I understand that he does have a cat, okay?

20:55.020 --> 20:57.102
And that's not necessarily great.

20:58.743 --> 21:01.364
I have a friend in the chat named Jeff from Earth.

21:02.265 --> 21:05.827
He also has a cat that he's kind of enthusiastic about.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.469
I forgive him every day for that.

21:09.170 --> 21:10.751
So I also forgive Louis for this.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.591
It's not bad.

21:11.651 --> 21:13.172
Cats aren't necessarily bad.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.193
They're just, I don't know.

21:16.294 --> 21:17.075
They're not dogs.

21:18.035 --> 21:18.896
So do me a favor.

21:19.977 --> 21:23.258
Put down your aggravation with the names of the individual politicians.

21:23.719 --> 21:28.200
Put down your cynicism that everything is pointless and there's no point in even bothering.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.342
Because you thinking there's no point in even bothering is why you don't show up.

21:31.682 --> 21:33.562
You not showing up is why your neighbor doesn't show up.

21:33.823 --> 21:35.983
Your neighbor not showing up is why everybody else doesn't show up.

21:36.244 --> 21:38.084
And when all of you don't show up, you know who does?

21:38.104 --> 21:41.526
AdverMed, all these other motherfuckers, and you know what they do?

21:41.866 --> 21:42.266
They win.

21:42.666 --> 21:44.207
So you're going to go into the video description.

21:44.787 --> 21:48.670
You're going to ask yourself, do I live in the state of any of these politicians?

21:48.990 --> 21:51.192
If you do, you're going to click onto the website.

21:51.512 --> 21:54.214
After you do that, you're going to find the contact info.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.375
You're going to call them.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.916
You're going to leave them a voicemail.

21:57.096 --> 21:58.217
You're going to write them a letter.

21:58.237 --> 22:02.641
So what I'm saying is that it's always about herding cats.

22:02.761 --> 22:04.762
He shows you that list of organizations.

22:04.882 --> 22:10.547
That's no different than the list of organizations that I show you that are supposedly part of this health freedom movement.

22:11.252 --> 22:12.574
Lewis Rossman's a good guy.

22:12.614 --> 22:15.076
He's been working on something I think's worth working on.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.820
He stumbled into it, and it's become his life's work.

22:19.801 --> 22:20.863
I wish him all the best.

22:21.183 --> 22:23.826
I hope he succeeds in all of his endeavors.

22:24.827 --> 22:28.051
We need more people like him, more people like an independent bright web.

22:28.351 --> 22:29.452
I'll see you all in the next video.

22:29.953 --> 22:30.213
Bye now.

22:37.812 --> 22:58.236
I don't care how you get there.

22:58.256 --> 23:00.977
I don't care what you do to get there.

23:02.857 --> 23:03.537
The goal is to win.

23:08.335 --> 23:09.265
What time is it?

23:09.325 --> 23:10.053
Game time!

23:17.102 --> 23:18.423
Well, good morning, everybody.

23:18.483 --> 23:19.324
Welcome to the show.

23:19.364 --> 23:24.128
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

23:24.628 --> 23:29.072
Very happy to be here today, trying not to interrupt your rhythm too much.

23:29.772 --> 23:32.334
I need to be out of here by 1230 on the button.

23:32.375 --> 23:37.258
So I'm going to work hard to get there, and I hope that will make everything efficient for you, too.

23:37.799 --> 23:42.062
Don't forget, our main goal here is to ultimately get off of social media.

23:42.162 --> 23:43.323
I love your cats, too.

23:43.363 --> 23:44.725
Don't worry, I'm just teasing you.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.308
We will not call autism.

23:48.508 --> 23:50.070
I don't like the word autism.

23:50.911 --> 23:51.752
He was vaccine damaged.

23:51.772 --> 23:52.573
Brian, Brian, Brian.

23:52.613 --> 23:53.433
I know, I know, I know.

23:53.453 --> 23:59.620
Intramuscular injection is something we should question as a methodology.

23:59.660 --> 24:02.963
Virology is definitely something we should question as a science.

24:03.504 --> 24:07.067
And public health is definitely, almost never, a good reason for anything.

24:07.888 --> 24:17.539
And yet from autism spectrum disorder to pandemics to gain of function, these myths are used to make sure that we never question intermuscular injection, virology or public health.

24:18.500 --> 24:23.766
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, then you probably believe a lot of these things.

24:25.648 --> 24:34.033
And I don't know what to say other than the only way out is biology and getting off of that whole military social control suite.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.874
This is the biology that they ignore.

24:36.914 --> 24:37.835
Welcome to the show.

24:38.675 --> 24:44.879
I want to give a special shout out to my friend Mark Kulak who made a really wonderful program yesterday.

24:44.899 --> 24:52.124
I really think this guy's work is top-notch and I really think his website archive is second to none.

24:52.584 --> 24:53.805
I think that work itself

24:54.925 --> 24:58.808
represents something that I just think needs to be admired.

24:59.508 --> 25:06.493
I also want to give a special shout out to this substack, biologyphenom at substack.com.

25:07.634 --> 25:09.475
I really like this substack a lot.

25:09.515 --> 25:18.941
This is the substack which has been keeping track of the craziness in Scotland that everyone seems to ignore, including all these people in the UK.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.103
It's remarkable.

25:21.783 --> 25:22.664
Welcome to the show.

25:22.724 --> 25:23.705
Thank you for being here.

25:24.805 --> 25:28.909
Biology is the way, and I'm really, really excited.

25:29.670 --> 25:31.051
My voice is feeling a little better.

25:31.652 --> 25:35.595
I don't know if it's the four liters of honey I drank last night or what it is.

25:35.635 --> 25:39.399
This is a message that if you've been hearing it for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

25:39.459 --> 25:48.827
If not, you might need to be coached how to stay focused on the biology and not take their bait on social media and to love your neighbor.

25:50.930 --> 25:52.397
Skilled TV watchers are lost.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.851
Skilled social media users could, in theory, still be saved.

25:58.186 --> 26:12.611
But how this is working is that there are a few people that put their money where their mouth is, so to speak, and have supported this stream in a very generous way, from $10 a month all the way up to hundreds of dollars a month.

26:13.711 --> 26:14.491
It's remarkable.

26:14.831 --> 26:20.853
We even have a couple supporters that have given us, some of whom continue to give us,

26:22.935 --> 26:25.318
Yeah, it's crazy.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.199
We are very grateful.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.002
Family of five renting our house in Pittsburgh.

26:30.062 --> 26:33.646
And so the way this works is that viewers are spreading the word every week.

26:34.727 --> 26:38.111
And people that are moved by our biology are supporting the work.

26:40.029 --> 26:41.990
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooley.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.971
I'm Chief Biologist at Gig Owen Biological.

26:44.011 --> 26:46.932
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

26:47.532 --> 26:51.954
You can find some of my work on the substack called Woodhouse 76.

26:52.334 --> 26:57.356
You can find some of my work on the National Library of Medicine website, PubMed.

26:57.396 --> 27:04.859
You can find some of my work and quotes in the Wuhan Cover-Up book, a book written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,

27:06.243 --> 27:08.845
Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America.

27:08.885 --> 27:15.489
You can find an article or two that I contributed to at Children's Health Defense and their Defender website.

27:15.689 --> 27:22.453
And I used to be buddies with Jay Bhattacharya, but he doesn't really, I don't know, I guess I've said too much.

27:23.974 --> 27:32.639
Anyway, you can also find my original YouTube channel on YouTube, JC on a Bike, where you can see all the trouble I got into as a

27:34.060 --> 27:37.845
a biking faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

27:37.865 --> 27:41.009
Then you can find my JC in the Woods channel where I am live right now.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.972
That's the only place where I'm allowed to be live.

27:43.012 --> 27:45.495
I'm kind of just trying to stay under the radar there on YouTube.

27:45.555 --> 27:49.280
So if you need to watch on YouTube, there is a place to do it.

27:50.762 --> 27:51.143
And yeah.

27:52.421 --> 28:06.143
If you want to support the work, you can go to gigalombiological.com, or you can also find links to everything else, including all the stuff that we've been distributing and encouraging people to start reading so that we can make some serious progress in understanding a new Biology 101.

28:06.183 --> 28:08.124
That would be the link stuff there in the corner.

28:08.184 --> 28:11.064
Also at the bottom, I put it in a number of places.

28:11.104 --> 28:14.925
If you scroll down, there is a schedule we're going to start following pretty soon.

28:15.005 --> 28:19.746
Links to all the places where we're streaming, and then, of course, links, different ways to support.

28:20.987 --> 28:24.310
Thank you very much for maybe even thinking about doing that.

28:26.853 --> 28:31.017
So yeah, this is Gigaohm Biological.

28:34.741 --> 28:35.562
Why don't I hear that?

28:35.582 --> 28:36.343
Oh, there it is.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.986
Yeah, welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

28:40.046 --> 28:42.149
I'll click over here and say good morning.

28:43.735 --> 28:48.537
People's brains are broken from six plus years of military grade cognitive dissonance.

28:48.557 --> 28:49.637
There's no question about it.

28:50.398 --> 28:51.518
We've been blasted by it.

28:52.118 --> 28:55.240
I'm coming to you Team USA here.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.120
I'm really bummed.

28:58.581 --> 29:02.362
This is a legit Team USA practice jersey.

29:02.542 --> 29:06.584
Not from the original Dream Team, but from like a year or two later.

29:07.384 --> 29:10.926
And as I put it on, the champion logo came off.

29:12.298 --> 29:13.499
It was ironed on, I guess.

29:14.039 --> 29:19.264
And I can show you, it's actually real, because there's a Champion logo on the yellow side, too.

29:19.624 --> 29:23.928
And for you kids out there who don't know who Champion is, they used to make the best stuff.

29:24.048 --> 29:27.350
Their sweatshirts and their sweatpants were thick and swoft.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.591
And they were tasty.

29:30.732 --> 29:33.712
And so yeah, this is legit old school, 90s stuff.

29:34.512 --> 29:35.933
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

29:35.953 --> 29:37.353
This is Giga Home Biological.

29:37.413 --> 29:49.175
We're coming to you live as a Team USA kind of thing in the sense of I'm trying to get more Americans on the page of there isn't a good team and a worse team.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.776
There isn't a okay team and a bad team.

29:52.836 --> 29:57.057
There's not a white nationalist team and a rainbow team.

29:57.757 --> 30:07.188
This theater has fractured America in a way where if you're not willing to try and find Team USA, then you're already lost.

30:08.709 --> 30:09.871
And that's really the truth.

30:11.705 --> 30:34.830
I grew up in a time in America where there was a Team USA that was not questioned, a Team USA that everybody was behind, when racism wasn't really a thing anymore, and where telling your preferences or your sexual desires to everybody as the opening pitch of who you are would just have been ridiculous.

30:36.010 --> 30:38.570
And now I live in an America where that's not the case.

30:38.610 --> 30:44.932
And I think all of these things are, are different facets of the illusion that we need to shatter.

30:45.912 --> 30:52.473
Um, and the way that I want to shatter it is a lot of times trying to go back in time to when, when things were different in America.

30:52.513 --> 31:03.395
And one of the ways to do that is go back and think about if you're old enough, think about how America thought about the dream team and what America was talking about when the dream team was assembled and went over

31:04.099 --> 31:11.785
What, what was the point of taking pictures and putting them on the cover of sports illustrated of like white guys and black guys playing together?

31:13.487 --> 31:14.207
What did it mean?

31:14.247 --> 31:18.731
Did they talk about, was there any white or black problems on the, on the dream team?

31:18.751 --> 31:29.300
Were they worried about whether or not the racist guy from Indiana was going to be, you know, able to play with the, with the guys from now they would.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.970
Now they would be worried about that.

31:32.050 --> 31:39.955
Now they would be worried about whether or not we had to have a trans male or a trans female or whatever they call them nowadays on the team.

31:41.176 --> 31:42.017
Which one's gay?

31:42.777 --> 31:44.218
Are there any gay guys on there?

31:47.080 --> 31:51.563
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but we've got to wake ourselves up and then we've got to wake our children up.

31:51.623 --> 31:57.868
Some of the illusions that they have cast upon us, enchantments that we have accepted, include this idea of endemicity.

31:58.786 --> 32:06.009
The idea that an RNA molecule could go from a mud puddle to everywhere in the world and then just kind of perpetually be there in the background forever.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.730
That's an illusion.

32:08.791 --> 32:14.953
And the weird thing about it is that illusion can't be dispelled unless you understand that it can't be proven.

32:15.954 --> 32:24.018
Because there's no way to prove that something went endemic if you have no evidence of it being absent before you found it.

32:25.238 --> 32:26.679
And so a background signal

32:27.708 --> 32:36.572
with nonspecific PCR tests could be called endemicity and the process and endpoint could become real if you believe that enchantment.

32:36.612 --> 32:57.320
But if you understand that there's an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals, and on that background, they rolled out ridiculously useless tests under the pretense of an emergency and using EUA authorizations that only Kevin McKernan whined about in 2020 on obscure podcasts only.

32:59.423 --> 33:05.388
And here we are, six years later, using their tests still to find their ghosts and calling ourselves Ghostbusters.

33:06.368 --> 33:11.052
Chasing the variants around, as if we're watching evolution in real time.

33:12.253 --> 33:17.917
And so this illusion and mythology of endemicity was then weaponized in the form of a pandemic.

33:18.991 --> 33:28.719
And in order to make sure that the mythology of pandemics is passed on to our children, they even put together a very elaborate anti-vaccine movement in America.

33:28.739 --> 33:36.546
They even killed some people in America to make sure that at the start of the pandemic, there would be no useful resistance to this concept.

33:47.315 --> 34:01.286
And that's really what this is supposed to portray, is the idea that you could take a background signal and change it into a red one, you know, if you make them equivalent with a PCR test.

34:02.227 --> 34:16.899
Now, the most important thing to understand is that if you look at the population pyramid of the United States, when I graduated from college in 1994, failed to get into medical school and started teaching high school,

34:20.066 --> 34:24.250
you can see the expected rise in all-cause mortality coming.

34:24.330 --> 34:29.815
You can see an easily anticipatable rise in all-cause mortality right here.

34:30.295 --> 34:35.440
It's the people that are just like at this time, are about 10 years older than me.

34:37.002 --> 34:41.386
The kids of the baby boomers, the real kids of the baby boomers, right?

34:43.868 --> 34:44.789
These people right here.

34:46.755 --> 34:53.019
And if we let this play, you will see very clearly that it's an anticipatable rise in all-cause mortality.

34:54.479 --> 35:02.584
And this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was timed perfectly with this claim of a novel virus.

35:03.084 --> 35:10.068
This claim that we could track something in the background that we had no idea was there, but now we're tracking it because now we know it's there.

35:10.469 --> 35:12.450
It was timed perfectly with this.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.119
And that's how malevolent this is.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.103
Because it was time to manage a problem they saw coming.

35:22.624 --> 35:24.946
That's why they needed so many people in place.

35:26.407 --> 35:27.288
And you can see it.

35:28.069 --> 35:30.571
You can see it very clearly in the slope of this graph.

35:30.591 --> 35:33.554
You can see very clearly they didn't need to murder very many people.

35:33.594 --> 35:36.057
You can see that they lost control of pneumonia.

35:36.117 --> 35:36.938
Lost control.

35:37.318 --> 35:38.399
And then they got it back.

35:38.439 --> 35:39.380
Look at the bright red.

35:42.782 --> 35:47.805
It's an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies.

35:47.865 --> 35:50.667
And now Brett Weinstein is talking about narrative sculpting.

35:54.649 --> 36:08.497
Just like Jay Bhattacharya a couple of years ago started a blog with some Canadian guy that he met through Brett Weinstein, and he called his blog, you know, illusion of consensus.

36:10.560 --> 36:14.502
Ladies and gentlemen, there is an illusion of consensus that this list doesn't matter.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.565
There's an illusion of consensus that murder didn't happen.

36:19.045 --> 36:29.291
There's an illusion of consensus that there was a novel virus that was weird and made weird symptoms, including cardiac symptoms and other kinds of symptoms.

36:30.831 --> 36:38.776
And all of these people are testifying to the existence of the novel virus, despite the fact that the math doesn't seem to leave any room for a novel virus.

36:40.319 --> 36:52.807
The only people who seem to provide evidence for the novel virus are all listed on the early COVID survivors list that Mark Kulak put together.

36:57.651 --> 37:00.753
It is remarkable because every one of these people has a track record.

37:00.793 --> 37:02.114
Every one of these people has a

37:04.818 --> 37:15.146
a calendar that you can put together and you can see whether or not they had principles because right here in the timeline that I'm looking at right now, right here is where the murder started.

37:15.906 --> 37:17.787
Right here is where the murder was the worst.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.849
Right here is where the murder ended.

37:22.273 --> 37:37.665
My intellectual progression from the beginning of the pandemic to now included thinking it was a lab leak, included thinking they were covering it up, but by the time the main peak of murder was happening, I was saying that they were lying about a background.

37:37.705 --> 37:40.107
They were misconstruing a background as spread.

37:40.548 --> 37:42.129
And so this is really nasty.

37:46.636 --> 37:59.961
I wasn't using the word murder yet, but I definitely was saying that they are just misconstruing a background as spread in order to justify the rollout of transfection and calling that a vaccine was a crime.

38:03.062 --> 38:06.223
The intellectual progression of somebody like Mary Holland.

38:12.625 --> 38:12.865
Right?

38:13.746 --> 38:14.766
That's what we have there.

38:16.815 --> 38:17.535
I have no response.

38:17.555 --> 38:19.136
Oh man, it's not working again.

38:19.176 --> 38:20.437
I don't know why this doesn't work.

38:20.497 --> 38:21.858
Do I have to update it or what?

38:22.178 --> 38:24.839
It always is running through the sounds now.

38:24.859 --> 38:29.782
Ha ha ha, equipment is lame.

38:29.802 --> 38:32.723
See, it's still running through the sound.

38:32.743 --> 38:33.724
You should be queued up.

38:35.545 --> 38:38.306
I guess I can hit Q, but that's double pushing then.

38:42.603 --> 39:09.543
current current yeah that's lame i don't know what to say that's i'm sorry i gotta i gotta not worry about the technical stuff so yeah we we really have to consider everybody now and we cannot we cannot not look back because that's what they want us to do they don't want us to look back on the murder they don't want us to figure it out and i'm getting more and more worried that the

39:10.618 --> 39:14.504
Grace Shara story is going to be an anecdotal one.

39:15.525 --> 39:26.702
And that none of these doctors are going to be able to usefully turn around Grace Shara as an example of what they need to check and make sure didn't happen to anybody else.

39:29.363 --> 39:41.186
that the very simple parts of that protocol and any variant of it didn't happen to anybody else, but instead it's gonna be like, oh, at least we got justice for grace, which I think we need.

39:42.786 --> 39:53.069
But if that doesn't mean that every case in the hospitals in 2020 gets reopened and re-examined for the possibility of intentional euthanasia.

40:04.226 --> 40:05.146
That's how we got here.

40:05.587 --> 40:07.327
We're on a script from these guys.

40:07.387 --> 40:14.551
The only one that would write the words intentional euthanasia are people like Robert Malone, the bioethicist expert.

40:16.331 --> 40:23.935
The only one who would say that combination of words is somebody as malevolent as Kevin McKernan or maybe Steve Bannon.

40:25.387 --> 40:34.455
That combination of words would even be somewhat contradictory to someone as boneheaded as Brett Weinstein, although I bet he'd use those words if he was scripted to.

40:34.475 --> 40:46.525
I can't believe that Mary Talley bowed and went on Joe Rogan and used those words, intentionally euthanized.

40:46.885 --> 40:47.786
That's a doctor.

40:50.831 --> 41:02.058
who apparently doesn't understand basic bioethics and doesn't understand the definition of basic words that are kind of crucial to the bioethics of being a doctor.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.499
What a tremendous failure.

41:06.801 --> 41:19.529
What a tremendous failure and opportunity for Joe Rogan to be like, you know, I thought that euthanasia required like, I thought that required informed consent, but if,

41:21.013 --> 41:38.949
If Grayshara's dad didn't know, and his family didn't know that they were gonna do it, and nobody gave permission, I'm just sneaking out loud here, but doesn't that mean that it was murder?

41:45.362 --> 41:50.208
Now, what we do have evidence for are these plasmids are in there without any question now.

41:50.288 --> 41:57.837
This has been replicated in many places around the world and there are consequences for having these residual pieces of DNA left inside the vaccines that we're going to touch on.

41:59.307 --> 42:00.988
This is not conspiracy theory.

42:01.028 --> 42:10.030
This has been published in the BMJ by Retsef Levy, and they go through this process one where they ran these vaccines in the trial.

42:10.230 --> 42:12.771
Okay, I'm gonna let him, I'm gonna have to start this over.

42:12.811 --> 42:16.993
But okay, first of all, realize this is just a clip taken out of a recent interview.

42:17.813 --> 42:24.255
You can see it's a recent interview because one of the worst Americans alive, Kevin McKernan, has now grown a beard.

42:25.255 --> 42:31.180
So he's hard to distinguish from Andy Kaufman, except he's a little more overweight than Andy Kaufman.

42:32.161 --> 42:34.222
They all look the same nowadays.

42:34.943 --> 42:45.351
Anyway, this poser, and I would say career liar at this point, working against the American public to make sure that the Human Genome Project is never understood to be behind

42:46.051 --> 42:56.157
the COVID-19 pandemic narrative and never understood to still be going on as we speak, and actually the motivation for making all these data centers that everybody's all excited about.

42:56.517 --> 43:11.325
You know, the military building data centers, the NSA building data centers, the government building data centers with Larry Ellison, the guy who ran Oracle and donated to Stanford, where Stanford has an internet observatory funded by Palantir.

43:11.745 --> 43:13.406
You know, all of that stuff,

43:15.131 --> 43:16.292
That guy works for them.

43:18.193 --> 43:23.857
And we have been bamboozled by him for five years plus on the right side of America.

43:23.897 --> 43:25.979
And the left side of America has never heard of this guy.

43:26.019 --> 43:32.384
And they're about to, if the plan that I think is about to happen happens, they're about to hear about him.

43:32.424 --> 43:33.605
That's why he grew his beard.

43:34.745 --> 43:37.928
The idea is to make sure that he's ready for prime time.

43:39.710 --> 43:41.551
And the prime time is about the DNA.

43:41.591 --> 43:44.692
It's not going to be about the fact that the RNA was never pure.

43:45.672 --> 43:51.495
It's not going to be about the fact that tiny RNAs have all kinds of biological consequences.

43:53.356 --> 44:03.139
It's not going to be about the fact that the endotoxins are also impossible to remove from the manufacturing of mRNA through process one or process two with the

44:05.595 --> 44:10.457
use of recombinant DNA and bacteria to manufacture the RNA.

44:10.737 --> 44:11.757
That's process two.

44:12.197 --> 44:16.699
Process one is making pure RNA through this RNA printing thing that I talked to you about before.

44:17.139 --> 44:24.722
So as I told you before, the whole point of bringing up process one and process two in this particular interview is what I predicted at least three years ago.

44:25.558 --> 44:29.363
that they're going to show you that there was an alternative, and the alternative was better.

44:29.803 --> 44:38.293
But unfortunately, Pfizer decided that when the DoD ordered 10 billion doses, that they couldn't make it with process one, so they used process two.

44:38.694 --> 44:42.758
And they were very naughty for not telling us that they were going to use process two.

44:43.139 --> 44:45.502
And process two is where the DNA comes from.

44:49.642 --> 44:51.824
And I did predict this three years ago.

44:52.004 --> 44:53.785
I scripted this out three years ago.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.146
It had to be what they were gonna do.

44:55.206 --> 44:57.428
I just didn't know how they were gonna do it.

44:57.488 --> 45:00.270
Now, the interesting thing is, is what paper is he promoting?

45:00.290 --> 45:04.153
He's promoting a paper by a guy that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:04.253 --> 45:18.084
just put on the ACIP, just promoted to the ACIP, a MIT professor where also Steve Kirsch is from and where also Stephanie Seneff is from, where also he is from.

45:20.316 --> 45:29.780
where also Rodney Mullen is from, and also where the guy who does gene drives is from, that nobody talks about as if gene drives are nothing.

45:29.820 --> 45:30.880
We don't have to worry about them.

45:30.920 --> 45:37.002
Gain-of-function viruses and supply chains and seed oils are what we got to worry about.

45:37.042 --> 45:43.645
And Callie and Casey Means being at the surgeon general position is just, I mean, it's crazy.

45:45.526 --> 45:51.191
So he's never gonna tell you that the purification of biologics is a standard procedure that couldn't be applied.

45:51.611 --> 46:01.699
There are many methodologies for making proteins pure when you're making a biologic that you couldn't apply to the RNA, hence they couldn't apply to the RNA like ever.

46:01.779 --> 46:03.921
They didn't figure that out during the pandemic.

46:03.961 --> 46:05.382
They've known that for decades.

46:05.902 --> 46:10.106
That's one of the reasons why process two using it would have been bad.

46:10.566 --> 46:12.508
He's trying to say that they didn't know that.

46:12.548 --> 46:13.529
Of course they knew that.

46:13.589 --> 46:15.090
They knew that from the very beginning.

46:17.068 --> 46:20.611
And using process two results in an RNA that isn't pure.

46:20.771 --> 46:30.039
All kinds of small fragmented RNAs that he came to my stream and talked to me about at the end of 2021, a couple of weeks before Charles Rixey came to my house.

46:31.974 --> 46:42.990
The endotoxins are also something you talked about on my stream that's not gonna say anymore because that would all reveal that process two was already a standard way to make these things.

46:43.451 --> 46:47.256
You know, what a lot of virologists call infectious clones.

46:48.188 --> 46:54.254
just large pure quantities of DNA or RNA that you can transfect a cell culture with and call virology.

46:55.115 --> 47:06.125
All of these illusions are connected and all of these lies must have the spectacular commitment of Kevin McKernan, the only guy who can really walk on this thin of ice.

47:06.923 --> 47:15.168
Because one wrong move, and suddenly you realize that every academic in America that was worth their salt knew what transformation and transfection was.

47:15.608 --> 47:20.671
Many of them were already using adenovirus-driven vectors to do optogenetics in their animals.

47:21.732 --> 47:28.236
Many of them were already transforming their cells to create proteins, or to apply proteins, or to overexpress proteins.

47:29.454 --> 47:31.716
And so they were told that this was a new thing.

47:31.776 --> 47:42.963
Robert Malone and Peter Cullis and all these people assured us that this was a new thing when it was no different than the product lipofectamine with fancier ways of shaking the bottle or drying them out.

47:45.845 --> 47:50.888
Because lipid nanoparticles are nothing new and the dangers of them aren't anything new either.

47:52.509 --> 47:55.071
And it's a compound problem, it's not just the DNA.

47:55.896 --> 47:58.096
It's not just process one or process two.

47:58.556 --> 48:03.957
The ultimate problem is, is that all of these jackasses knew this before the pandemic.

48:03.997 --> 48:18.240
And that's the reason why the pandemic narrative had to exist in the first place, because otherwise there would have been no excuses to forget or to imagine that these things aren't true.

48:19.100 --> 48:22.181
You know, it's a new thing, this technology that had never been tried.

48:22.241 --> 48:24.321
Isn't that what Mary Holland says repeatedly?

48:25.199 --> 48:27.995
These are all coordinated liars on the same...

48:29.401 --> 48:42.211
same provided script, and the only people who are sophisticated enough in their understanding to stay on that script without a lot of help or a lot of guardrails are Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

48:42.251 --> 48:44.713
That's why Jessica Rose only talks about bears.

48:44.813 --> 48:48.155
That's why Matt Crawford only talks about Scientology.

48:48.195 --> 48:51.538
That's the reason why Charles Rixey only talks in Excel files.

48:51.938 --> 48:58.503
That's the reason why all of these people have a single little thing that they stick to but never progress on.

49:01.738 --> 49:05.481
and how they changed that when they decided to go and inject the rest of the world.

49:06.282 --> 49:11.365
This is traditionally immortal sin in vaccine manufacturing or in any sort of biologic manufacturing.

49:11.385 --> 49:12.646
The process is the product.

49:12.686 --> 49:15.228
You change the process, you have to go through trials again.

49:15.969 --> 49:19.232
And the EMA even asked them to do that, although they failed to.

49:20.172 --> 49:25.897
They asked for another trial of 250 people once they changed the process, and that data was never delivered.

49:26.877 --> 49:50.588
So this bait-and-switch is very important for you to understand why the trial data is of absolute... The bait-and-switch is important for you to understand as a bullshit story to make sure that you don't understand that this liar, traitor to our grandchildren, could have told you all of this in 2020 and could have actually taken the risk that would have belied having principles that a patriot would have.

49:51.128 --> 49:54.110
But instead, this mealy-mouthed poser

49:54.730 --> 50:07.552
was arguing that the FDA was in the way of proper PCR testing and that the WHO had distributed a PCR test that was bullshit and that's not fair because they got peer review in 24 hours and it's not fair.

50:08.412 --> 50:09.493
The FDA is lame.

50:11.693 --> 50:12.893
This man is a criminal.

50:13.753 --> 50:23.955
And once the American public understands the lies that he told in 2020 and how his logical progression belies that he is a state actor,

50:25.336 --> 50:26.516
They'll want him in jail too.

50:27.817 --> 50:30.618
Zero consequence to what we're actually seeing in the field.

50:30.938 --> 50:36.199
Those numbers are a caricature of what they're actually doing with these injections.

50:37.200 --> 50:46.742
And so he's a liar and he's going on doing the same lies that include, of course, promoting clowns and promoting clown ideas.

50:46.762 --> 50:51.744
There are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me.

50:51.864 --> 50:54.665
People like JJ Cooey, you know,

50:55.285 --> 50:59.808
This is the voice of Nick Hudson, who I also think is on Team Robert Malone.

51:00.929 --> 51:12.917
My best evidence I have for that is that he lost the three presentations that I gave to Panda and never posted them on their Rumble channel and instead has taken all that information and tried to pretend it's his or theirs.

51:14.498 --> 51:25.707
Perhaps his worst sort of anecdotal story is that he got invited to go on a cruise off of the coast of Turkey with Robert Malone and his wife in 2022.

51:26.328 --> 51:33.934
And after he came back from that cruise, he tried to convince me that Robert Malone and his wife were good guys because they were fighting the whole time they were on that boat.

51:33.954 --> 51:38.017
And there's no way that they could be operators, otherwise they would have never done that.

51:38.297 --> 51:40.980
So as far as I can tell, they're just good guys.

51:42.372 --> 51:43.373
And I laughed at him.

51:44.173 --> 51:45.995
And then Jessica Hockett was called in.

51:46.735 --> 51:48.917
And Jonathan Engler was called in.

51:49.097 --> 51:51.259
And Professor Martin Neal was called in.

51:51.299 --> 51:55.762
And I was supposed to write some kind of substack with them because they really like me.

51:56.503 --> 51:58.484
And they wasted another year of my time.

52:01.546 --> 52:04.148
When I had already had it down to like 15 words.

52:04.248 --> 52:05.790
Population pyramids are real.

52:05.850 --> 52:07.011
That's a pretty big signal.

52:08.172 --> 52:12.033
RNA can't pandemic because there's no biological evidence for that bullshit.

52:12.714 --> 52:18.196
Intramuscular injections are not medicine because there's no real biological evidence that that bullshit works.

52:18.856 --> 52:35.202
And transfection is a crime because it's an old dated methodology that is used so widely in academia that no one should have taken this seriously except for the fact that they put all these liars out on the internet and called it new gene therapy.

52:40.461 --> 52:45.283
And so yesterday I watched these two poor excuses for men.

52:47.143 --> 52:55.066
I watched a little bit and I showed you how they danced around the transfection, they danced around the population.

52:57.006 --> 53:01.948
But the video gets worse, so I want to watch a little bit more of it, but I'm going to take it out of

53:02.688 --> 53:28.023
this context I'm going to put it in VLC directly and play it faster and just take a few notes and make sure that you digest exactly how malevolent and more importantly exactly how many admissions are made in this podcast because there is so much in this podcast that is a consequence of what I'm doing or what Mark Kulak is doing just like the

53:29.401 --> 53:37.926
the work of Lewis Rossman is making lawmakers do things and making lawmakers perform in Congress.

53:40.007 --> 53:42.909
These people are being made to perform by me.

53:43.970 --> 53:47.572
They are being made to perform by their handlers because of me.

53:48.132 --> 53:53.375
There are table meetings that are occurring only because of Mark, only because of me.

53:54.176 --> 53:55.697
Everybody else is nothing.

53:56.017 --> 53:57.658
Everybody else is their tool.

54:00.020 --> 54:01.921
Everybody else is working on their team.

54:01.982 --> 54:03.723
This guy might be unwitting.

54:03.803 --> 54:07.165
He might be that soft, but think about this for a second.

54:07.205 --> 54:09.107
I didn't know this when I first watched him.

54:09.527 --> 54:21.496
He's from Scotland, where they murdered people in 2020, in 2021, in 2022, in order to convince the rest of the world that there was a pandemic.

54:21.576 --> 54:27.701
In order to convince the rest of the world that it was worth using, taking the risk of transfection or maybe ivermectin.

54:29.960 --> 54:34.383
They murdered people in Scotland, like really, really murdered them.

54:39.327 --> 54:40.648
And there's testimony of it.

54:42.429 --> 54:43.350
And nobody cares.

54:44.151 --> 54:47.313
Nobody in the UK media, nobody in the alternative media.

54:47.413 --> 54:58.722
Scotland is one of the best examples of a population pyramid that was cut off at the top on purpose and then shown to the rest of the world as evidence of a pandemic.

55:02.079 --> 55:08.002
And the fact that these two monsters never even got there in their two hour discussion is just so gross.

55:08.062 --> 55:09.462
I can't, it makes me want to puke.

55:11.643 --> 55:15.665
So I'm going to put this up anyway, because I really think this is work we have to do.

55:15.805 --> 55:16.366
I'm sorry.

55:16.386 --> 55:19.827
I know it's not the best work, but it is work we have to do.

55:20.027 --> 55:21.368
Where did I download this thing?

55:23.769 --> 55:25.450
Um, what, where did it go?

55:25.970 --> 55:27.871
Did I put it in the wrong hole here?

55:30.871 --> 55:32.411
Sorry, I will find it in a second.

55:32.471 --> 55:34.212
I mean, maybe I still have it in the downloads.

55:36.593 --> 55:37.573
It's got to be in this one.

55:38.573 --> 55:39.314
Why isn't it here?

55:39.434 --> 55:40.634
Oh, I must have downloaded it.

55:40.654 --> 55:41.114
There it is.

55:41.154 --> 55:41.454
Sorry.

55:41.634 --> 55:41.974
Gotcha.

55:42.635 --> 55:43.075
Hey, folks.

55:43.435 --> 55:46.816
Welcome to the Dark Horse Podcast Inside Rail.

55:47.016 --> 55:51.677
I have the distinct pleasure of sitting with my good friend, Neil Oliver, this morning.

55:51.817 --> 55:53.858
Well, for him, it's this afternoon.

55:55.345 --> 56:01.110
Neil, for those who don't know him by training, is an archaeologist.

56:02.271 --> 56:06.736
He's probably better known these days as the Coast Guy.

56:08.898 --> 56:11.881
He hosts a program on GB News in Great Britain.

56:12.341 --> 56:13.863
In any case, Neil, welcome to Dark Horse.

56:14.283 --> 56:15.324
It's lovely to be with you.

56:15.644 --> 56:16.945
I always enjoy our conversations.

56:17.026 --> 56:18.327
My only regret is that they don't happen often enough.

56:20.250 --> 56:20.990
Yeah, I feel the same way.

56:21.131 --> 56:23.312
I'm very glad to have you back on.

56:23.692 --> 56:29.696
Of course, this is a moment at which things are going so well on planet Earth that there's probably not that much for us to talk about.

56:30.276 --> 56:30.656
Job's a good one.

56:31.217 --> 56:31.817
Yeah, right.

56:32.117 --> 56:34.819
This episode of the Dark Horse Inside Rail is sponsored by Bandman.

56:34.999 --> 56:37.020
We absolutely adore Bandman.

56:38.481 --> 56:47.467
Where do you think we are relative to the crises that we were so concerned with in the last several years and anything new that has arisen?

56:48.277 --> 56:50.539
I think it's been deliberately attritional.

56:51.459 --> 57:11.094
I feel a certain fatigue, a general exhaustion, not least because I think a couple of years into, let's say this kicked off for me around 2020, a couple of years into it, I felt as if... He seems already to be aware of the phenomenon that Mark and I have been pushing, that they're running out the clock.

57:11.134 --> 57:13.756
But the question is, what are they running the clock out on?

57:14.952 --> 57:32.299
And this traitor to Scotland, if he had his eyes open or he took his head out of the, if he took his head out of the holes that it's been in for the last five years, he would know that in Scotland people were murdered.

57:33.939 --> 57:41.842
And that if we don't get justice for those people now, but wait for five more years or 10 more years, they will never get justice.

57:41.882 --> 57:43.243
Their relatives will never get,

57:44.310 --> 57:54.055
This is what's happening and this guy is from Scotland where they murdered old people in a way that they did it in few other countries.

57:55.256 --> 57:59.378
Scotland that's been brought to a immigration crisis state.

58:01.499 --> 58:05.621
A lot of their elders are gone because of murder and this dude

58:06.744 --> 58:17.069
is not going to make any useful progress in understanding how they might have been murdered, you know, by supplementary oxygen leading to a pneumonia that was viral, so we can't use antibiotics.

58:17.710 --> 58:21.111
We have a way to get justice for Scotland.

58:21.511 --> 58:26.154
There is a blog that he should have plugged the moment that he got on.

58:26.214 --> 58:34.478
Brett, I just want you to be sure you're aware that in Scotland, like in few other places in the West, people were murdered, but he didn't.

58:37.093 --> 58:41.274
that makes him wittingly or unwittingly complicit in that murder.

58:41.334 --> 58:42.214
He's awful.

58:43.195 --> 58:44.855
Solutions were crystallizing a little.

58:45.375 --> 58:52.117
I felt as if enough people might be drawing conclusions that were close enough that we might affect change.

58:52.517 --> 58:57.039
I thought that there might be consequences for things that had been done.

58:57.419 --> 58:58.519
I thought lessons might have been learned.

58:58.559 --> 59:01.120
I thought there might have been a commitment never to allow certain things to happen again.

59:01.220 --> 59:05.601
But there has been an incessant barrage of crises

59:06.261 --> 59:34.444
you know the thing that was sold to us as a pandemic then morphed into war in Europe uh was then bloodied you know in in the most horrifying terms by what happened in Israel and Gaza and was continuing to happen in Gaza the horror there um and people also at the same time because of things as banal in a sense as cost of living crises uh that is remarkable because again he he he his imprecision

59:36.263 --> 59:39.245
It shows how overwhelming this has been for everybody.

59:39.285 --> 59:41.947
And I'm not saying that he's wittingly on a script right here.

59:41.987 --> 59:43.768
I think this is exactly how he feels.

59:43.848 --> 59:45.029
It's just too much for me.

59:45.669 --> 59:47.130
My heart is collapsing.

59:48.531 --> 59:49.631
It's just too much for me.

59:49.712 --> 59:52.313
I don't know what to care more about.

59:53.674 --> 01:00:03.020
And that is definitely by design, but I'm going to give you some, I think you should care more about the murder that happened in your country.

01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:22.637
You should care more about the murder that happened to people around you, in the system that you're in, because you have more responsibility to them, both for letting it happen and for advocating for justice now, than you do for what's happening in Israel, for example.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:27.460
Is what's happening in Israel and in Iran tragic?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.381
Yes, of course it is.

01:00:30.387 --> 01:00:36.429
And we can find individual stories in all places, under all myths, and under all narratives that are tragic.

01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:51.855
But American history being contorted and distorted into a history that, if you don't understand it, will result in everyone rejecting the idea, is a disaster.

01:00:52.742 --> 01:01:00.465
And it appears to be that these people in the UK, these weirdos that everybody is promoting, they seem to all have that idea.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:11.950
That Great Britain and America, if that's the way that the world needs to see it, is responsible for what's happening in Israel because we give them money, because we give them stuff, because they buy stuff from us.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.531
I know it's all real.

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:28.238
But they want you to believe that that's the same kind of incompetence and evil and malevolence that brought us the gain-of-function virus that killed millions of people, that gave them the excuse to roll out a shitty transfection.

01:01:28.639 --> 01:01:30.580
Hopefully they'll fix it the next time around.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:34.202
But goodness sakes, we better regulate gain-of-function virus research.

01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:37.724
And goodness sakes, can we get on to solving the problem in Iran?

01:01:37.784 --> 01:01:39.785
Or are they going to get nuclear weapons?

01:01:39.805 --> 01:01:42.266
Or are they just making nuclear fuel for China?

01:01:45.421 --> 01:01:47.402
Are they just providing oil to China?

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:48.402
And we don't like that.

01:01:48.522 --> 01:01:54.464
So we're going to use the excuse that we had already 15 years ago, which is Iran is three years from a bomb.

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:58.946
Oh no, wait, maybe it's 17 months or 14 months, but they're almost there.

01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:05.563
I think Mark's analysis was dead-on balls accurate.

01:02:05.603 --> 01:02:06.823
I thought it was a great show.

01:02:07.744 --> 01:02:15.128
Inflation, increased taxation, people are finding it harder and harder just to keep their heads above water, far less to contemplate looking at the bigger picture, which I understand, because I feel it myself.

01:02:15.988 --> 01:02:25.634
But I feel a certain despondency, if not hopelessness, that wrongs that were committed in the past, and for which there is now such ample evidence, have no consequences.

01:02:26.974 --> 01:02:33.358
He's still talking about the people as though he's not a part of the people, but he does feel it because he feels it too.

01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:38.322
It's a very, very important thing to hear there.

01:02:39.662 --> 01:02:43.965
He's talking to Brett like he's one of the same group that Brett is.

01:02:44.465 --> 01:02:51.390
He's talking about the people, that's us, as somebody else, and they're under a lot of pressure.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:52.891
But I feel it too.

01:02:56.684 --> 01:03:05.930
And likewise, the bigger picture about, say, war in Ukraine is there for anyone that wants to spend a couple of minutes getting a back story on what continues to happen in Ukraine.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.151
And yet nothing changes.

01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:08.052
Nothing changes.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:13.595
I feel... So is it really... Is the truth of Ukraine really just available with a few clicks?

01:03:15.577 --> 01:03:18.258
Is the truth about Israel available in a few clicks?

01:03:18.839 --> 01:03:21.981
Is the truth about the pandemic available in a few clicks?

01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:23.662
Does he really believe that?

01:03:25.282 --> 01:03:28.266
because that is the most naive statement I've ever heard.

01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:33.093
Some kind of existential fatigue, I think is my answer to your question.

01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:35.156
He's looking down over there.

01:03:36.017 --> 01:03:37.820
He might be on a script after all.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:37.920
Wow.

01:03:39.329 --> 01:03:52.703
Yeah, I feel that fatigue too, and I think I infer from your answer that you feel that the fatigue is intentional, that the idea is to get us to tune out because it's just too exhausting to try to track the morphing crisis through all of its various incarnations.

01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:53.704
Exactly that.

01:03:53.725 --> 01:03:58.810
I think we're almost, I feel as if we're almost at a point, I've been describing it recently as just like living with organized crime.

01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:01.273
I think this is literally accurate.

01:04:01.733 --> 01:04:19.423
you know i just i just feel that for people like me i just thought we lived in a rules-based society if not a rules-based world and or think a rules-based order is that something i've heard other people say before what a weird choice of language that you ought to do and and and and if you did if you transgress that from highest to lowest richest to poorest

01:04:20.003 --> 01:04:20.684
powerful to powerless.

01:04:20.704 --> 01:04:22.006
If you did certain things, there'd be consequences.

01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:30.636
And now, evidently, all that's happening is that the drugs running, the human trafficking, the arms sales, the prosecution of dirty wars, is just a turf war.

01:04:31.657 --> 01:04:35.121
They do what they like without consequences, and there are only consequences for people that stumble into their turf.

01:04:35.862 --> 01:04:39.324
that dare to sell drugs where they sell drugs or traffic people where they traffic people.

01:04:39.884 --> 01:04:42.045
And so he sometimes gets it right, right?

01:04:42.105 --> 01:04:50.870
But it's the imprecision and it's the lack of progress in terms of understanding the consequences of the words that they say.

01:04:54.332 --> 01:04:55.692
And that's the remarkable part.

01:04:55.732 --> 01:05:02.216
They say all these words that belie an understanding that would then have consequences for their action.

01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:04.117
And they don't do anything but podcast.

01:05:05.967 --> 01:05:07.869
They don't say anything of consequence.

01:05:07.909 --> 01:05:09.430
They just say that what they see.

01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:11.632
I see birds.

01:05:11.932 --> 01:05:13.593
They're dead all over my backyard.

01:05:13.633 --> 01:05:14.494
You know, I'm counting them.

01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:15.335
That's cool.

01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:17.517
Did you see the dead birds too?

01:05:17.557 --> 01:05:18.558
Yeah, they're everywhere.

01:05:18.598 --> 01:05:19.118
It's nuts.

01:05:19.578 --> 01:05:23.702
I got, I had like 10 dead Cardinals on my, on my porch this morning.

01:05:23.742 --> 01:05:24.002
Cool.

01:05:24.523 --> 01:05:25.884
I swept them up, cleaned them away.

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:26.845
It's nuts.

01:05:26.905 --> 01:05:28.106
The whole place is falling apart.

01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:42.181
If you actually saw and believed that the ecosystem was collapsing so much that you had to sweep dead birds off of your porch every morning, wouldn't you take more action than sweeping up the dead birds?

01:05:45.102 --> 01:05:51.604
If you believe all the things that you're saying right now, wouldn't you do more than just podcast with Brett Weinstein?

01:05:53.545 --> 01:05:54.325
It's not about right and wrong.

01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:56.066
It's about whether you have the impunity that comes with power.

01:05:57.972 --> 01:06:00.274
Yes, and this puts us in a very uncomfortable spot.

01:06:01.414 --> 01:06:06.778
So let me just put a couple of concepts on the table that I'm juggling in this neighborhood.

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:10.821
One of them, you and I will have talked probably multiple times about what I call Goliath.

01:06:11.664 --> 01:06:17.026
And you might remember that my definition for Goliath is, Goliath is the force that opposes all meaningful change.

01:06:17.946 --> 01:06:21.647
It allows change, but meaningful change is not allowed because you are at the pinnacle of power.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:34.492
Now we're supposed to be working with his model of reality that includes something called Goliath, which is kind of as well-defined as the ship-in-a-bottle variable in his brother's theory of everything.

01:06:37.373 --> 01:06:40.934
And so he is conjuring something here, Goliath.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:46.027
Conjuring something that he's never gonna bother to define.

01:06:46.187 --> 01:07:12.458
In fact his definition of it has not changed And so if you have a model with a couple moving parts But you never make any progress and understanding those moving parts and whether they have Other parts or a phenomenon underlying them or they're an emergent property of something else, but you just keep saying there's two parts You know, it's complex systems different than then then then then then complicated systems

01:07:13.646 --> 01:07:26.129
And then you say Goliath, and you say the health freedom movement, but these things remain, you know, rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:38.172
Occasionally a few specific details about what they believe, but then right back to rise and resist people over profits, courage over fear, and truth over lies.

01:07:40.413 --> 01:07:41.373
These are frauds.

01:07:42.332 --> 01:07:49.556
They are performing a shitty script, and that's why this podcast, even at 1.5 speed, is a shitty podcast.

01:07:50.296 --> 01:07:53.478
You have only to lose when things that are unpredictable are introduced.

01:07:53.538 --> 01:08:00.442
So Goliath is effectively a force that prevents that meaningful change, which has terrifying implications.

01:08:00.842 --> 01:08:08.867
But the predicament it puts us in is, I think you and I are both feeling that there is an amorphous something that manifests as crises as different as

01:08:10.142 --> 01:08:13.944
An amorphous something that manifests as crises.

01:08:16.045 --> 01:08:19.207
Think about how aspecific and stupid that is in 2025.

01:08:19.487 --> 01:08:24.029
He is such as a pathetic pseudo intellectual.

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:26.570
It's kind of, it's worth pitying him.

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:31.492
You kind of have to wonder if this guy is actually this dumb.

01:08:33.633 --> 01:08:34.434
Actually this,

01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:42.285
unsophisticated and unable to see through such a shitty script that he seems to have been provided.

01:08:43.447 --> 01:08:53.019
That he's not done any legwork on virology or any legwork on microbiology or any legwork on molecular biology in six years

01:08:53.872 --> 01:09:04.837
as a posing biologist because his field is evolution and he works on complex systems and no one can teach him anything about that.

01:09:05.197 --> 01:09:09.959
The only person that he knows who works on complex systems like that is Paul Cattrell.

01:09:12.156 --> 01:09:23.218
a war in Ukraine and a spreading infection and emergency procedures that are deployed ostensibly to control it, those two things are not alike in one regard.

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:34.680
But in another regard, to the extent that they feel like they are either tools cut from whole cloth for Goliath's purpose or events that are co-opted by Goliath, it amounts to the same thing.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.021
Are we always, is the rules-based society that you and I thought that we lived in

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:47.093
kind of illusion that is fed to our the rules based society again, which I just you know, is he a history teacher?

01:09:47.293 --> 01:10:01.967
Is he a civics teacher is, you know, he seems to be a polymath in his own mind, but I assure you he's not naive and hopeful parts in order to distract us from what is actually wielding power over our lives.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:05.992
That's, I suppose, to some extent, what I find most frightening.

01:10:06.493 --> 01:10:10.254
Or, if not frightening, most discombobulating.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:20.620
I would put it almost akin to if you'd been in a decades-long marriage that you had every reason to believe was happy and mutual and all the rest of it.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.543
And then you were to find out that your spouse, from before day one, had been maintaining a second family and had been betraying you in every way imaginable.

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.305
So none of this was ever real.

01:10:34.006 --> 01:10:34.887
None of what?

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:37.168
See, this is the problem.

01:10:38.188 --> 01:10:41.030
What specifically don't you think was real?

01:10:42.511 --> 01:10:48.274
Because if you can't say that, then you're not offering an alternative explanation.

01:10:48.314 --> 01:10:55.898
You're not offering an alternative model for the history of the last five years, which is what they purport to be discussing.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.760
These two malevolent turds

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:05.099
These absolute abominations of grown men.

01:11:06.199 --> 01:11:09.261
Pathetic intellectual frauds.

01:11:13.763 --> 01:11:20.606
They might as well, I mean, they'd be better off drinking whiskey and talking about what they know about whiskey because at least they probably know something.

01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:21.646
Maybe one of them does.

01:11:21.746 --> 01:11:29.350
Discombobulation is such that not only do I think that we live, that we don't live in a rules-based society and that we're under the thrall or the yoke of organized crime, I have no idea how long it's been going on.

01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:36.712
may have always been going on, into periods of time to be measured in centuries, if not millennia.

01:11:37.152 --> 01:11:39.214
So for millennia, it's been going on.

01:11:39.374 --> 01:11:41.175
Oh no, it might be the Venetians.

01:11:42.336 --> 01:11:44.798
I'm gonna give you a clue right now, you dipshits.

01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:45.979
Okay?

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:52.784
Everybody out there who thinks that that matters, the only people who matter are the people who are alive right now.

01:11:53.404 --> 01:11:58.068
Because we're the only people who can teach these kids the truth before we're dead.

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:12.812
If this theater's been going on for 400 years, the only way that the theater is sustained is by the actors that are alive promoting the books of the actors that are dead at best.

01:12:15.353 --> 01:12:18.854
So again, he's trying to make you feel overwhelmed.

01:12:18.894 --> 01:12:21.835
You're supposed to agree, wow, I know it's so overwhelming.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:25.436
It's like so old that what could I possibly do?

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:29.017
It's the DOD, so what could I possibly do?

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:39.452
If the DoD is poisoning everybody on earth, and it's the Venetians who are running the DoD since before the inception of America, then what am I gonna do?

01:12:39.472 --> 01:12:44.413
I look out at what I took for reality, and I think, was any of it ever real?

01:12:44.933 --> 01:12:51.475
And now I'm 58 years old, and I think, have I just been tricked, and duped, and been behaving like a hapless patsy for the whole of my life?

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:56.977
If you believe that, then what's the logical thing to do?

01:12:57.967 --> 01:13:21.077
to podcast with Brett Weinstein, to take sponsors and read sponsorships, to ignore the old people that were murdered in the care homes and hospitals of Scotland, instead promote yourself and your wardrobe with your super stupid scarves that you threaded your ear...

01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:26.062
That's what I find particularly alarming.

01:13:26.082 --> 01:13:27.222
You know, you alluded to the Goliath thing.

01:13:27.242 --> 01:13:41.388
You immediately make me think of, there's a poem by Ted Hughes called Hawk Roostant, which I can't remember much of it verbatim, but it's basically the ruminations of a hawk holding onto a branch with its talons and telling itself that the way things are are the way I want things to be.

01:13:41.808 --> 01:13:48.851
And it's in my power to keep things like this, that I am the apex predator, and I will not be displaced, because after all, who's going to do it?

01:13:50.154 --> 01:14:00.217
I suppose that's the way I think of, that would be my analogy for your Goliath, that there's just power, power in the talents, and it does what it does to perpetuate its status quo.

01:14:00.617 --> 01:14:03.917
Okay, so again, it's power, it's an amorphous hawk.

01:14:04.678 --> 01:14:06.278
Do I have to go out back and look at it?

01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:08.538
That's one of the reasons why I got on late.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:09.719
I just want to give you a tip.

01:14:11.431 --> 01:14:22.544
You know, right now is a really good time to watch birds in North America and in Europe on the north side of the earth because the babies are out right now and the babies are chasing around their parents.

01:14:22.944 --> 01:14:24.486
And so there's a lot of

01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:26.064
How can I say it?

01:14:26.104 --> 01:14:36.472
There are a lot of bird calls out there that if you don't watch birds or haven't been watching birds since your grandma raised you, then you wouldn't be aware of how the bird calls change in the spring and early summer.

01:14:36.512 --> 01:14:37.893
But right now, they're very different.

01:14:38.233 --> 01:14:46.258
And if you listen carefully, you can hear all these juvenile birds chirping back to their parents, calling for food or calling for mom's help.

01:14:47.539 --> 01:14:58.007
And it's very different than what was happening in the spring and it'll be very different than what's happening after these babies are out of the nest and the next round starts.

01:14:58.507 --> 01:15:10.836
So in case you're, you know, need some encouragement to go outside and you forgot you can go outside, there's a good reason to go outside if you have any interest in seeing birds.

01:15:10.896 --> 01:15:16.780
If you just have to go outside to get fresh air, maybe it's not quite so motivating because you don't want to look across the street.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:41.472
But if you're gonna look across the street into the trees or look into your garden into the trees It might be more appealing to you get outside Get into nature and stop listening to Brett Weinstein at some point seriously just trash this guy for the anti-intellectual anti-patriot anti-american awful person that he is Well, I wonder

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:44.372
I want to put a thought out there.

01:15:44.412 --> 01:15:48.576
I don't know whether I feel like offering it as a kind of solace, whether there's any solace in it or not.

01:15:49.116 --> 01:15:49.597
I'm not sure.

01:15:50.117 --> 01:15:55.462
But I have the sense that the world that you and I thought we lived in is not entirely fictional, but it's a layer.

01:15:56.583 --> 01:16:01.948
We are effectively allowed to live in a layer that does have some of this rules-based nature, or at least it did.

01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:06.132
And that, as you describe it,

01:16:06.943 --> 01:16:13.906
The crime, from the point of view of the powerful something that lives above that strata, is to compete with it in a zone that it has declared off limits, right?

01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:19.949
So I would use the analogy of currency.

01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:23.470
You and I deal with something called money.

01:16:24.711 --> 01:16:28.592
And that money is simultaneously an illusion and very real.

01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:33.069
buy remarkable things with it.

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:41.788
You can place it in an investment and lose it all, and your capacity to do things in the world will be radically changed by the fate of your money.

01:16:43.097 --> 01:16:44.298
I got a quick one for you.

01:16:44.358 --> 01:16:51.503
For all you math people out there, you know, like Matt Crawford and Dodd and Nick Hudson seems to be interested in math.

01:16:51.864 --> 01:16:56.547
I mean, applied mathematician is one of the five degrees that Jessica Rose has.

01:16:57.468 --> 01:17:02.272
So all the mathematicians out there, you know, Steve Kirsch, that guy is super into numbers.

01:17:02.732 --> 01:17:10.398
I wonder if any of you can tell me why there is both a limit at casinos and also a minimum.

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:16.000
I wonder if anybody can tell me why that is the case.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.945
I bet you can't.

01:17:20.585 --> 01:17:21.667
I bet you don't know why.

01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:27.934
And I didn't know why, but I'm learning all the time.

01:17:29.656 --> 01:17:30.817
Just a math problem for you.

01:17:30.837 --> 01:17:31.718
Why is there a limit?

01:17:32.279 --> 01:17:33.620
And why is there a minimum?

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:38.127
in a casino.

01:17:38.467 --> 01:17:39.368
So it is real in this sense.

01:17:39.928 --> 01:17:43.030
But it is also the kind of thing that you cannot protect.

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:49.374
You can put it in a bank that will monitor the quantity of it that you have with precision.

01:17:50.154 --> 01:17:54.237
And you can't prevent the central bankers from devaluing it.

01:17:55.257 --> 01:17:56.818
So it is simultaneously real and protected.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.619
And there are certain things you can say about its value.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.000
There are certain rules.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.242
Economists study the rules that affect its value.

01:18:04.448 --> 01:18:09.369
But there's a loophole where something about power renders it, to them, monopoly money.

01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:15.730
They have ways of effectively printing it that devalue the money that's locked behind a vault door in the reality we live in.

01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:18.511
And so the point is, it would be wrong to say money isn't real.

01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:28.453
And it would be wrong to imagine that it is the object whose value is naturally defined by forces that we study scientifically.

01:18:29.813 --> 01:18:30.354
It is both things.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.354
It's both a fiction and a reality at the same time.

01:18:33.949 --> 01:18:35.571
I would say that's a perfect analogy.

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:38.694
I think a lot about money, not for the obvious reason, because I don't have any and I want some.

01:18:39.134 --> 01:18:45.901
I think about it as a useful analogy often, because a currency is a circulating security.

01:18:46.862 --> 01:18:51.646
For most of us, it's bits of paper, or at least a number on a statement on your phone or in hard copy.

01:18:54.469 --> 01:18:59.073
It works, or it works traditionally because it was a security in as much as it was one step removed from something of actual value.

01:18:59.093 --> 01:19:01.375
So notionally, you could redeem it in the form of gold or whatever.

01:19:02.016 --> 01:19:03.337
Obviously, those days are long gone.

01:19:03.377 --> 01:19:05.599
But nonetheless, it's still a circulating security.

01:19:05.799 --> 01:19:07.761
It's one step removed from something of value, from proof of work.

01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:14.026
But the reason that it works so well as an analogy for what we're talking about is that it's fundamentally about confidence.

01:19:14.126 --> 01:19:19.111
You and I have to accept that the $50 bill or the 100 pound note or whatever means the same thing.

01:19:19.711 --> 01:19:21.073
We place the same value upon it.

01:19:21.653 --> 01:19:31.637
So look at how awful they are at using this analogy, and listen to how easy it would be to use this analogy better.

01:19:33.297 --> 01:19:45.262
Because if money is fiat, and the fiat only comes from them, it's very similar to how you either have cash,

01:19:46.434 --> 01:19:47.394
Or you have digital.

01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:50.435
And then digital, you don't really know what's going on anymore.

01:19:50.475 --> 01:19:51.475
It's a complete illusion.

01:19:51.876 --> 01:20:07.180
You'd rather have paper newspapers that are printed and distributed and read than you would rather have mobile phones with infinitely many anonymous accounts and infinite actors

01:20:08.956 --> 01:20:18.779
providing what appears to be the world at your fingertips, when in reality, it's just a bunch of corrupt information drowning out anything useful.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:35.565
You know, like a bunch of corrupt money drowning out all of the money in your pocket, so that all of the communication that you might usefully have on social media is overwhelmingly dominated by bullshit and bullshitters on scripts provided by them.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:40.202
Instead, I don't know what they're using this analogy for.

01:20:40.562 --> 01:20:49.026
I don't know what they mean with the currency thing and that it's a commodity or a certificate or whatever.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:52.087
They still haven't really gotten anywhere.

01:20:52.127 --> 01:20:55.889
They've made it more complicated to understand that the world is fraudulent.

01:21:00.111 --> 01:21:06.619
I think we can transact usefully and happily and we can trust one another that when I give you this, you know what you've got in the form of that note.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:13.687
And I think where I actually find optimism actually, because I endeavor not, you know, I have a tendency more and more to be bleak and I try not to be and I try to find optimism.

01:21:15.222 --> 01:21:18.824
that the Ponzi scheme of the currency is on the point of collapse.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:27.470
And likewise, I think that it's no bad thing if the Ponzi scheme of our reality is allowed to collapse as well.

01:21:27.871 --> 01:21:32.013
Because what's real always was, always is, and always will be real.

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:35.356
All the things of value in the world and the proof of work

01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:43.860
and the gold and the crops and the skills and the knowledge are all still, everything that ever was on the planet is still here as this blue marble hurtles through infinity.

01:21:44.841 --> 01:21:46.342
We've had an illusion placed over it.

01:21:46.922 --> 01:21:52.885
And if that illusion is no longer something that we can trust, if that is a debased currency, well, we're better off without it.

01:21:52.905 --> 01:22:01.290
If it's finally gone from being worth 100% to worth 1% and soon to be 0% of its cover price, then that might be no bad thing because you don't want to deal with a Ponzi scheme indefinitely.

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:09.954
Wow, it sounds like he's ready for collapse, he's all about it, might as well flush it down the toilet and punish nobody, who are we gonna punish?

01:22:10.915 --> 01:22:12.275
Who's responsible for it?

01:22:12.335 --> 01:22:17.638
Who are we gonna hold accountable if it was, you know, 400 years ago already people were doing it?

01:22:18.885 --> 01:22:20.766
Those people are ultimately responsible.

01:22:21.026 --> 01:22:25.308
And it might be that the value of pulling the Band-Aid off is greater than the pain.

01:22:25.989 --> 01:22:26.969
But I have a concern.

01:22:27.069 --> 01:22:44.798
I think what you've said is logically true, but past its sell-by date, in the sense that let's say that we run your experiment in a town 300 years ago, where let's say that the town exists in some sort of a nation that destroys its own currency through reckless policy or corruption.

01:22:46.274 --> 01:22:52.039
Well, the townspeople who discovered that the notes that they were using in exchange are not, have gone from being.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.843
Are we gonna pretend that we don't ever have, this has never happened anywhere before?

01:22:56.844 --> 01:23:10.977
Is this monster fraud going to try and tell a historic antidote when there are actual historic examples in Dutch history?

01:23:12.139 --> 01:23:15.780
Argentinian history, Venezuelan history, German history.

01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:22.963
What in the nine hells is this guy doing other than obfuscating any truth that might be available?

01:23:24.464 --> 01:23:25.524
This is the worst.

01:23:26.064 --> 01:23:27.225
It's just awful.

01:23:27.805 --> 01:23:35.368
And the reason why we are covering it is because this is an American who's being put in front of anybody that will watch him.

01:23:36.365 --> 01:23:51.631
and therefore is a threat to our children, is a threat to our college kids, is a threat to anybody who can tolerate him, because he is a scripted liar on a script provided by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, if at all anymore.

01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:57.474
As bad as he is, it could be that he's been let loose, and this is a moron out of control.

01:23:58.094 --> 01:24:04.937
A circulating security, as you put it, to a circulating insecurity, may at some point be better off just realizing, you know what, forget those things.

01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:15.263
You know, I'm a blacksmith and I make these tools, and you raise meat, and you need these tools, and we can go back to doing this in some way where there's no mystery about what the exchange involves.

01:24:15.403 --> 01:24:18.644
So I wonder what Brett's gonna offer in that exchange.

01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:20.625
Will he fix somebody's motorcycle?

01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:24.126
Will he teach anybody's kids?

01:24:27.047 --> 01:24:28.327
Is he gonna offer something?

01:24:28.407 --> 01:24:31.489
What are his services that this little man can offer?

01:24:31.549 --> 01:24:33.709
I bet he can't even lift his own body weight.

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.950
Give me a break.

01:24:36.021 --> 01:24:36.261
false.

01:24:38.022 --> 01:24:44.166
Now run that scenario again with a modern American or British town chosen at random.

01:24:46.107 --> 01:24:48.589
Well it doesn't have all of the elements necessary for life.

01:24:49.129 --> 01:24:49.749
It may grow nothing.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:54.372
It may only grow things and not be able to manufacture the tools with which to do the growing.

01:24:54.672 --> 01:25:00.456
And so the problem is, does a collapse become so catastrophic that even

01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:14.697
your point about it returning us to some kind of reason isn't allowed, it isn't possible for that to happen because the peril is so great in the getting from A to B. It confronts us with, or it asks us to confront.

01:25:14.817 --> 01:25:16.858
What is getting from A to B in their mind?

01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:22.661
I think getting from A to B means that after society collapse, how long does it take for all the zombies to die?

01:25:24.295 --> 01:25:28.398
How long does it take for all the useless eaters to kill themselves or each other?

01:25:29.199 --> 01:25:31.741
This is actually what they're talking about here.

01:25:32.662 --> 01:25:43.871
They are contemplating what's gonna happen when the useless eater's system of compliance and system of subservience and system of acquiescence is gone.

01:25:46.093 --> 01:25:51.358
Will the internet be enough to entertain them until they starve or die of something else?

01:25:52.554 --> 01:25:54.295
These are all questions that they're asking.

01:25:54.335 --> 01:25:58.236
That's one of the reasons why that coward moved to an island.

01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:11.582
That's one of the reasons why these very rich people have houses on different places like New Zealand and Hawaii, because they understand and are anticipating a societal collapse.

01:26:11.642 --> 01:26:18.005
And they probably are putting people in place right now to make sure that that collapse is catastrophic and violent.

01:26:19.076 --> 01:26:23.320
so that they can produce solutions to that catastrophic violence.

01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:27.564
They're already testing that shit all around the United States.

01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:30.366
And that's what you probably saw in LA already.

01:26:32.408 --> 01:26:41.217
And they'll do it elsewhere as long as their actors are put on social media and people use social media skillfully to try and figure out what's going on.

01:26:42.558 --> 01:26:44.780
But social media could also be their downfall.

01:26:46.087 --> 01:26:57.415
but it will require manual sharing and manual use of social media, going only where you want to go, seeing only what you want to see, and sharing only what you want to share.

01:26:57.475 --> 01:27:03.939
That's why I've established a PeerTube channel and a Soapbox, because those have no algorithms.

01:27:03.999 --> 01:27:07.682
Those are open, federated, and free.

01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:11.438
You can download things and watch them on your own.

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:13.640
You can download things and send them to other people.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.944
You can download my videos and make your own YouTube channel.

01:27:18.086 --> 01:27:19.327
Your own Rumble channel.

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:20.729
Your own BitChute channel.

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:23.452
Your own Spotify podcast.

01:27:25.214 --> 01:27:26.336
And I encourage you to do it.

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.084
I think we mean by evolution.

01:27:32.806 --> 01:27:35.349
I do mean as organisms or so on.

01:27:35.369 --> 01:27:46.380
I'm not going to stray into your biological territory unwittingly, but evolution societally, we call it progress, but I think we have to confront what we've actually accepted and what we've done.

01:27:46.901 --> 01:27:51.285
Science and technology and so on have gifted us lives of comparative ease.

01:27:52.372 --> 01:27:57.197
compared to the lives of people living in even the recent past, you know, we've all got the wisdom of the ages in our pockets.

01:27:58.098 --> 01:28:00.280
And, you know, we have convenience and everything.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.323
The wisdom of the ages in our pockets?

01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:04.744
You see, that's bullshit.

01:28:05.985 --> 01:28:07.547
We have nothing of the sort.

01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:36.513
a click away but in terms of progress we're all stupid and without skills most people don't know anything unless they look up and even at that you have to know a certain amount to know what to look up and we don't have any skills I mean nobody could fix a lawnmower far less their car people can't make clothes for their clothes see who they're talking about they're talking about people and we because these are exactly that kind of man

01:28:37.398 --> 01:28:41.941
He's never fixed anything himself, never got his hands dirty, maybe never even dug a hole.

01:28:42.742 --> 01:28:44.443
Has he had calluses on his hands?

01:28:45.104 --> 01:28:54.250
Ever had any blisters from working with a tool like a shovel or a pick or maybe a bush axe?

01:28:55.792 --> 01:28:57.853
Do they even know the shape of a bush axe?

01:28:58.073 --> 01:28:59.354
Do they know what that is even?

01:28:59.975 --> 01:29:02.837
Have they ever done a job where they needed steel toe shoes?

01:29:05.267 --> 01:29:07.308
Like I said before, have they ever baled hay?

01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:09.750
Have they ever worked in the barn or on the wagon?

01:29:11.511 --> 01:29:14.413
These people are not Americans.

01:29:14.473 --> 01:29:16.114
They're not UK people.

01:29:16.174 --> 01:29:17.195
They're posers.

01:29:18.175 --> 01:29:19.516
These are not commoners.

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:22.058
These are not one of us.

01:29:23.819 --> 01:29:25.981
They are auditioning to be one of them.

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:30.784
And that's why they don't know how we live.

01:29:31.084 --> 01:29:32.545
They don't know how we grew up.

01:29:33.655 --> 01:29:36.758
and they know nothing about the country we're trying to restore.

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:41.842
Brett knows nothing about the country we're trying to restore.

01:29:42.282 --> 01:29:56.694
The last time that guy was even close to what I would call an American was when his dad bought him a house in Ann Arbor, Michigan so that he could go to the University of Michigan as an undergrad.

01:29:57.995 --> 01:30:01.838
And so that's why I have, ow, dang it.

01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:03.299
That didn't work.

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:05.654
my Michigan shorts on.

01:30:08.597 --> 01:30:15.326
I got Michigan shorts on because I got shorts for every one of these meddlers for my show.

01:30:16.886 --> 01:30:25.532
And once I start shooting on the basketball court and doing shows about them on the basketball court, I'll be wearing shorts that match the clown that I'm talking about.

01:30:25.592 --> 01:30:38.180
So in this case, I've got shorts from the University of Michigan on because that clown, when he was a kid, went to the University of Michigan, where he met Heather, where his dad bought him a house.

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.762
The dad that worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:40.782 --> 01:30:46.646
to update the FDA, despite Estes Kiefoff for his best try to make it better.

01:30:48.707 --> 01:30:49.347
Yeah, that guy.

01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:53.049
Nakedness, people can't hunt.

01:30:53.089 --> 01:30:54.429
I'm coming for them all.

01:30:54.589 --> 01:30:57.110
You know, we've become an interesting question.

01:30:57.170 --> 01:31:01.092
I definitely think as well that we've passed the point where you used to be able to say, well, medicine has given us longer, healthier lives.

01:31:01.592 --> 01:31:03.073
I think we've even passed the tipping point on that one.

01:31:03.173 --> 01:31:04.033
I think we're living shorter lives.

01:31:04.053 --> 01:31:06.895
We're certainly unhealthier, even if we're keeping us alive for 70, 80, 90 years.

01:31:07.275 --> 01:31:08.935
Even if we're living longer, though.

01:31:09.055 --> 01:31:12.597
I think cumulatively, for all of the aforementioned reasons, we are less alive than we used to be.

01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:14.071
I agree.

01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:20.737
And we are degrading the quality of our lives through processes that are effectively... So it's all our fault.

01:31:21.617 --> 01:31:22.738
We are doing it.

01:31:22.919 --> 01:31:25.721
We are less alive than ever is an enchantment.

01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:28.603
It's demoralizing the people that listen to this.

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.005
And it's also an agreement between these two guys.

01:31:31.025 --> 01:31:31.946
Yeah, it's really true.

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:33.447
It's really true.

01:31:33.507 --> 01:31:34.208
We suck.

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.170
People suck.

01:31:37.811 --> 01:31:38.872
The world sucks.

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:43.611
And that concerns me greatly.

01:31:43.891 --> 01:31:56.236
That, for example, the enlightened perspective these days seems to be that the population bloom and doomers were wrong, which they were, and that actually there's no population problem at all, and that the more the better.

01:31:56.896 --> 01:32:01.298
So we're gonna skip this part because we talked about this one already.

01:32:02.419 --> 01:32:06.001
Populations in some instances are falling faster than a piano out of a window.

01:32:06.421 --> 01:32:06.581
Sure.

01:32:07.141 --> 01:32:12.544
So is population pressure really the burgeoning problem in this medium-term future?

01:32:12.984 --> 01:32:14.685
Is it not the loss of population?

01:32:14.745 --> 01:32:17.267
And so now I just want to show you that it presents a little bit further.

01:32:17.287 --> 01:32:18.547
The quality of life on planet Earth

01:32:21.929 --> 01:32:23.370
and we got life.

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:29.752
But that's a really good analogy for birth control and what it does to human that it has.

01:32:30.152 --> 01:32:32.273
I'm very much in favor of birth control in terms of what it has accomplished.

01:32:32.993 --> 01:32:35.974
But it has also destroyed the logic of being a person.

01:32:35.995 --> 01:32:37.895
What did it accomplish by doing so?

01:32:38.255 --> 01:32:39.396
What did it accomplish?

01:32:39.576 --> 01:32:47.399
And it has inverted the fundamental logic of being a human birth control has inverted the fundamental logic of what it means to be human, but he's not going to explain it.

01:32:48.789 --> 01:32:54.893
Further along in this interview, they're gonna debate about whether Nick Hudson is a good guy or not, but this one is especially awful.

01:32:56.294 --> 01:33:16.646
Because what did birth control accomplish other than creating that temporary bump, that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was caused after World War II that we needed to get in control of, that we did get in control of by writing books like this and by promoting birth control?

01:33:18.868 --> 01:33:27.590
which created an anticipated temporary rise in all cause mortality that they managed with murder and lies and called a pandemic.

01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:32.830
And this guy is employed to make sure that no one ever realizes that.

01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:46.773
That other guy is employed in the UK to make sure that no one ever realizes that he's in Scotland with one of the worst population pyramid managing crimes on earth.

01:33:50.908 --> 01:33:57.753
It has created exactly the kind of chaos in which people do not understand that the future and getting into it is the entire point of the exercise.

01:33:57.953 --> 01:33:59.355
People have become solipsistic.

01:33:59.475 --> 01:34:00.415
They've become narcissistic.

01:34:00.876 --> 01:34:04.338
They have become confused about the centrality.

01:34:04.559 --> 01:34:05.619
It's by design.

01:34:05.739 --> 01:34:07.361
It's because of social media.

01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.762
Social media did that.

01:34:08.942 --> 01:34:09.602
Nothing else.

01:34:09.863 --> 01:34:13.986
This guy is a malevolent traitor to our grandchildren.

01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:16.189
I'm going to just go forward.

01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:22.467
Because you're doing the things you do, driving the cars you drive, exams that my parents' generation... That's the main thing that matters.

01:34:23.482 --> 01:34:27.584
So it used to be that people enjoyed sport.

01:34:28.044 --> 01:34:29.705
This is an ancient thing.

01:34:29.805 --> 01:34:30.305
Did you see him?

01:34:30.325 --> 01:34:31.306
He's looking at a script.

01:34:31.906 --> 01:34:33.287
Built to enjoy sport.

01:34:33.827 --> 01:34:42.271
But the idea that somebody who's into sport went from somebody who plays the sport to somebody who watches the sport and follows it on a screen, we have gone from producing sport to consuming it.

01:34:42.811 --> 01:34:44.872
And yet it feels, oh, he's really into football, right?

01:34:45.192 --> 01:34:50.955
That sounds like the same person, but it is, in fact, the inverse activity, producing versus consuming.

01:34:51.435 --> 01:34:52.636
People used to make music.

01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:55.330
The number of people who now make music is very small.

01:34:55.951 --> 01:34:57.931
What everybody else does is they consume music.

01:34:58.151 --> 01:34:59.031
Music used to be universal.

01:34:59.351 --> 01:35:02.472
Everybody in your tribe would gather and you would raise your voices together.

01:35:02.772 --> 01:35:05.733
And the songs were living entities that went on and changed over time.

01:35:05.913 --> 01:35:08.273
It's funny because I'm a scientist who did science.

01:35:08.413 --> 01:35:10.114
I'm a musician who made music.

01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:12.234
I'm a kite flyer who's also built them.

01:35:14.035 --> 01:35:18.435
I'm a motorcycle rider who's also repaired them and maintained them.

01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:20.536
Hmm.

01:35:23.137 --> 01:35:42.791
It's interesting because he's describing himself as part of this sad human race and all the attributes that he shows because since he supposedly got fired or lost his job and was paid half a million dollars, what has he done?

01:35:43.712 --> 01:35:44.492
What has he learned?

01:35:45.053 --> 01:35:47.815
How much progress has he made in fighting Goliath?

01:35:51.744 --> 01:35:55.610
And you can now see him playing his day as the fraud that he is.

01:35:56.471 --> 01:36:05.684
Bret Weinstein is such a fraud that in a few minutes these two guys are going to discuss whether Nick Hudson is smart enough, is clear enough.

01:36:07.628 --> 01:36:17.158
The same guy, of course, that would plug me as somebody to follow or to understand or something like that.

01:36:17.759 --> 01:36:18.680
I've got to go to the gym.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.422
This timing is a little bad, so I don't have a play out.

01:36:21.462 --> 01:36:23.004
We're not going to be able to do music.

01:36:23.064 --> 01:36:24.305
I need to get on even earlier.

01:36:25.345 --> 01:36:26.745
I don't see any other way to do it.

01:36:26.845 --> 01:36:29.606
I think I'm going to have to move the starting time even earlier.

01:36:29.626 --> 01:36:32.687
I need to get back to 1010 or something like that.

01:36:33.868 --> 01:36:35.768
So I apologize for ending so abruptly.

01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:38.009
I'm not going to watch the rest of this.

01:36:38.069 --> 01:36:40.890
I'm frustrated because it's so easy to dissect.

01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:41.790
It's kind of painful.

01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:46.531
But I assure you that in a few minutes, they're going to talk about Nick Hudson.

01:36:46.631 --> 01:36:50.892
And actually, it's the Coast guy who says, there's a guy that you might know, Nick Hudson.

01:36:50.912 --> 01:36:52.033
And then Brett says, well,

01:36:52.893 --> 01:36:57.757
Nick Hudson doesn't really understand what complex is versus complicated.

01:36:58.177 --> 01:37:02.020
And so let me explain complex systems versus complicated systems.

01:37:02.461 --> 01:37:03.882
And it is so awful.

01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:13.369
It is so pseudo-intellectual and so pathetic that it made me sad.

01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:15.110
It made me sad for him.

01:37:15.391 --> 01:37:16.511
It made me pity him.

01:37:16.572 --> 01:37:18.113
But it also made me sad for

01:37:19.394 --> 01:37:41.646
for either social media being so hyper-effective that when given few alternatives, people will actually watch him, or even worse, that we have so acquiesced to using social media that we've become so undiscerning with our time that actually a lot of people don't mind listening to this guy.

01:37:42.642 --> 01:37:44.704
Which is a very, very depressing idea.

01:37:45.665 --> 01:37:47.827
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigaohm Biological.

01:37:47.907 --> 01:37:51.010
It's a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:53.312
I'm going to be back on tomorrow at around 10.10.

01:37:54.293 --> 01:37:58.076
As early as possible so that I can get enough time to really put a show together.

01:37:58.096 --> 01:37:59.057
This is 1.37.

01:37:59.618 --> 01:38:00.819
It should be around two hours.

01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:02.680
That's the reason why it feels like I'm cutting it short.

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.404
There was a few more things they were going to say and then I could have done a little music break and everything.

01:38:06.804 --> 01:38:07.525
I'll figure it out.

01:38:07.705 --> 01:38:08.205
I promise.

01:38:08.325 --> 01:38:10.147
And I will definitely be here again tomorrow.

01:38:10.607 --> 01:38:11.307
Thanks for being here.

01:38:11.788 --> 01:38:13.669
My voice feels better than it did yesterday.

01:38:13.749 --> 01:38:15.711
So, you know, there's something to be optimistic about.

01:38:16.631 --> 01:38:18.993
I definitely can breathe better than I could breathe yesterday.

01:38:19.033 --> 01:38:20.054
So I had a swollen throat.

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:20.774
Don't worry about it.

01:38:20.815 --> 01:38:21.495
It's not the same.

01:38:21.515 --> 01:38:26.158
It's not the same as that that lump that came out a couple years ago that nobody cares about.

01:38:26.199 --> 01:38:26.879
Thanks for being here.

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:27.980
See you soon.
