WEBVTT

00:18.104 --> 00:19.965
and and and and

00:57.219 --> 01:00.441
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:09.585 --> 01:18.949
And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, I need a caretaker.

01:22.211 --> 01:23.151
So God made a farmer.

01:26.027 --> 01:34.857
God said, I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board.

01:34.937 --> 01:35.858
So God made a farmer.

01:39.617 --> 01:44.179
I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.

01:44.459 --> 01:54.563
Somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to wait lunch until his wife's done feeding visiting ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon and mean it.

01:54.883 --> 01:55.824
So God made a farmer.

02:00.706 --> 02:08.989
God said I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt and watch it die and dry his eyes and say maybe next year.

02:10.871 --> 02:26.722
I need somebody who can shape an axe handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make harness out of hay wire, feed sacks, and shoe scraps, who planting time and harvest season will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then pain in from tractor back put in another 72 hours."

02:26.802 --> 02:27.763
So God made a farmer.

02:30.345 --> 02:40.372
God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor's place.

02:41.892 --> 02:42.893
So God made a farmer.

02:44.854 --> 02:56.584
God said, I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to yeen lambs and wean pigs and tend the pink-combed pullets who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow lark.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.815
It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners.

03:01.055 --> 03:12.239
Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake, and disc, and plow, and plant, and tie the fleece, and strain the milk, and replenish the self-feeder, and finish a hard week's work with a five-mile drive to church.

03:13.660 --> 03:26.805
Somebody who'd bail a family together with a soft, strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says,

03:28.046 --> 03:32.294
that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does.

03:34.438 --> 03:35.500
So God made a farmer.

04:20.220 --> 04:20.340
I'm

04:52.602 --> 04:52.663
you

05:19.781 --> 05:26.584
And here we reside now in the midst of the first evolutionary church on earth.

05:29.985 --> 05:35.367
Recognizing that the structure of win-lose democracy

05:36.437 --> 05:53.051
through voting, great as it was for its time, cannot coordinate us toward a planetary sense of connectivity, wholeness, oneness, and liberate the creativity of ourselves when we join.

05:53.972 --> 06:00.738
We've hit a structural impasse because the wind

06:06.749 --> 06:17.565
I'm just taking this mark for right now as an announcement that the evolutionary church is a seedbed for evolutionary democracy.

06:18.407 --> 06:21.351
The seedbed is a church.

06:23.517 --> 06:29.041
that is growing in the consciousness of the people founding this church.

06:29.462 --> 06:37.268
We are the first church to announce the origin and fulfillment and dedication to synergistic democracy.

06:37.728 --> 06:38.028
Amen.

06:41.084 --> 06:56.953
What is synergistic democracy being announced by the First Evolutionary Church, whose text is the sacred story of evolution, allurement quark to quark to quark all the way on up to

06:57.353 --> 07:03.016
to single cells, to multi-cells, to animals, to humans, to humanity, to us in this sacred church.

07:03.856 --> 07:10.799
So let everybody feel for the moment the awesome generation of capacity that we have.

07:11.479 --> 07:13.760
Democracy as it functions today is not working.

07:14.481 --> 07:16.341
We need an evolution of democracy.

07:16.381 --> 07:19.943
We need to include and transcend into the next stage.

07:20.603 --> 07:24.085
The evolution of democracy is the evolution of love, which is the evolution of God.

07:25.044 --> 07:38.333
If democracy is a thought form in the mind of God, and the mind of God is the infinite creativity and value that animates reality, then the evolution of that mind form is the evolution of democracy.

08:03.734 --> 08:17.264
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

08:17.404 --> 08:19.346
I don't know crash the dollar.

08:19.546 --> 08:24.470
I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value We have left.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.732
I don't know But I know for sure

08:28.120 --> 08:45.565
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

08:59.991 --> 09:00.053
you

09:31.929 --> 09:32.550
Washington.

09:32.931 --> 09:33.351
Lincoln.

09:33.832 --> 09:34.313
Jackson.

09:34.854 --> 09:36.296
Susan B. Anthony.

10:09.883 --> 10:24.825
Underneath the dim lights in a dirty hall A woman stands her back against the wall Back at home, her kids to feed So she lives off someone's greed People will do anything, anything

10:35.431 --> 10:50.547
Some people build and dine and dance Then trade last, given half a chance Empires built on someone's gold Don't think twice while they count the gold People will do anything, anything

12:02.492 --> 12:17.566
Politicians have a way to get paid Make a stand if a profit can't be made Everyone, it's time to pass a plate Hurry up, don't be late The people will do anything, anything

12:54.830 --> 12:59.875
Don't forget we're having a live event on November 3rd here in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

13:00.535 --> 13:04.239
Send me an email, figure out how to get in contact with me, drop something in the chat.

13:04.979 --> 13:06.801
It's a pretty fly-by-night kind of thing.

13:06.861 --> 13:14.848
No tickets are being sold, so you can't have any expectations for there to be carnival rides or a famous band there.

13:16.089 --> 13:24.216
But I will be there, Mark will be there, Scott will be there, Joe will be there, and a few other people, including somebody from Switzerland.

13:24.916 --> 13:29.420
So, I don't know, if you can drive there, man, I highly recommend it.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.124
This may be the first meeting of the roundtable, so to speak.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.316
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

14:01.377 --> 14:06.099
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.261
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

14:10.841 --> 14:11.582
It's embarrassing.

14:32.799 --> 14:34.581
Hello from Pennsylvania.

14:34.641 --> 14:35.683
Hello to Michigan.

14:36.424 --> 14:45.735
Unfortunately, Uggs0001, you've already bought your ticket to come to Pittsburgh, so you no longer have any leverage as far as a bouncy house goes.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.780
Had you waited, maybe we would have had to have organized a bouncy house.

14:50.861 --> 14:52.602
But yeah, that's not going to happen now.

14:53.122 --> 14:56.743
Your consciousness is still the prime real estate that these people are competing for.

14:57.003 --> 15:01.125
And now that you've become aware of it, I hope you're taking control back.

15:01.625 --> 15:10.127
And that includes staying off of this thing called X as much as possible, except when you go there to throw things.

15:11.228 --> 15:14.029
And make sure that you are working hard to

15:15.109 --> 15:22.598
all the time enunciate this to your family and friends about how these charlatans are a group of people that we've inherited from our parents.

15:23.319 --> 15:28.144
It's really important to understand that although there are lots of people involved,

15:30.046 --> 15:34.588
You know, all of the people that are involved understand one or two things really well.

15:35.349 --> 15:39.451
And one or two of those things are definitely found on this screen right here.

15:39.831 --> 15:44.974
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

15:45.534 --> 15:47.875
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal.

15:48.556 --> 15:53.498
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses aren't pattern integrities.

15:53.538 --> 15:54.659
That's just the way it is.

15:56.499 --> 16:15.087
It's fun because now that we can say it so succinctly, you can see how they're left with no alternative but to ignore us because these ideas are firmly outside of the little spinning motorcycle inside of the flaming wheel that's being tilted on the mechanical arm.

16:16.067 --> 16:20.189
We're way outside of their very lively debate within that limited spectrum.

16:21.009 --> 16:24.431
We're way outside of it with those basic statements.

16:25.171 --> 16:44.920
And so breaking this trap that was described by people like Edward Bernays and after him, Noam Chomsky, it's just a matter of trying to find language and ideas which are firmly outside of the trap.

16:45.080 --> 16:51.803
So that no matter how you address them, the only way to talk about them is to acknowledge that they're outside of the trap.

16:52.463 --> 16:55.924
And that's what I think this previous page really is here.

16:55.984 --> 16:57.705
I think that's what this list is.

16:57.885 --> 17:12.831
It is a combination of ideas that is so outside of the trap of the Scooby-Doo, the trap of climate change, the trap of the red and the blue pill, that we're really just now unaddressable.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.612
People can't even talk about it.

17:15.392 --> 17:19.414
And that's a sign that this limited spectrum of debate is now

17:20.194 --> 17:42.030
visible once you get outside of it you can see it and so no matter how malevolent the way that they got us into the trap was no matter how malevolent this car ride has been for the last four and a half years where people have been trying to convince us that well I had something strange everybody had something strange that I know of so something had to happen

17:44.301 --> 17:56.650
This is all something that we've been managing to shake because we started at the foundation of the narrative, the idea that there was a mystery virus that can explain the excess deaths that we're having.

17:57.050 --> 18:05.076
And actually, we've come up with a whole list of better explanations for the increase in all-cause mortality that was observed.

18:05.556 --> 18:11.979
and even a better explanation for the patterns in that all-cause mortality that was observed.

18:12.039 --> 18:20.864
And although we agree that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread, I think there are better ways to explain it than how some people who have risen

18:21.744 --> 18:23.585
to prominence are explaining it.

18:24.065 --> 18:33.588
And with regard to the legal arguments, these are the words that you should be using if you're going to usefully tweet back against any of these people.

18:34.148 --> 18:40.610
You should ask them to define the rational basis test and where it is used in laws that matter for this.

18:41.910 --> 18:44.371
You should ask them what strict scrutiny is.

18:45.311 --> 18:47.614
That's not the same as strict liability.

18:47.714 --> 18:48.855
Make sure you know the difference.

18:49.555 --> 18:58.924
You should ask them why the Seventh Amendment might be an interesting way to attack this narrative, and you should ask them what jurisdiction stripping might have to do with this.

18:59.545 --> 19:04.730
Because if they're not talking about these things, then they're not talking about what the Federalist Society would talk about.

19:05.191 --> 19:07.132
They're not talking about what, you know,

19:07.853 --> 19:14.902
fed a very, very, very conservative law school like maybe, I don't know, is Northwestern a conservative law school?

19:14.982 --> 19:18.266
Is probably University of Chicago is a conservative law school?

19:18.326 --> 19:25.855
That one, you know, think about, think about these concepts and how the, how the Federalist Society would define them.

19:26.676 --> 19:36.741
and the kinds of legal arguments that they have played a role in, especially jurisdiction stripping, especially strict scrutiny versus the rational basis test.

19:37.201 --> 19:44.484
If you understand those things, and you understand that essentially many of these lawyers are not evoking

19:46.451 --> 20:03.701
they are not evoking the requirement for strict scrutiny under certain circumstances, not screaming and yelling about the only requirement being the rational basis test, then they're not really fighting against the things they purport to fight against.

20:03.781 --> 20:08.664
And it doesn't matter who gets on and says, we should fight against the PrEP Act.

20:08.764 --> 20:09.785
Make sure you hear this.

20:13.024 --> 20:14.986
Oh, I got to focus that in.

20:15.006 --> 20:15.967
Hold on one second.

20:16.007 --> 20:24.294
You're going to see the back of my chair first, because that's how I focus it in when I'm not able to sit behind it.

20:24.374 --> 20:25.975
So here comes the back of my chair.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.177
Let me see if that's working.

20:28.217 --> 20:29.458
Wait, that's not working.

20:29.498 --> 20:31.520
Hold on a second.

20:32.141 --> 20:33.101
Big head in the way.

20:33.121 --> 20:33.902
There we go.

20:34.182 --> 20:35.463
Focus on chair.

20:36.224 --> 20:37.765
Make sure that's in focus.

20:37.986 --> 20:38.566
That's it.

20:38.686 --> 20:39.587
See, it's real chain mail.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.595
Gotta have armor when you're doing this work.

20:44.315 --> 20:47.757
So, yes, what did I wanna say?

20:47.837 --> 20:52.760
Oh yeah, so these words up here really actually mean something in the American legal system.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.102
And so right now is just a time to draw a line in the sand.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.424
And it doesn't matter what law you wanna talk about.

20:59.464 --> 21:01.005
It's okay, there are lots of laws.

21:02.365 --> 21:03.566
Mark has some laws.

21:05.007 --> 21:06.788
Catherine Watt has some laws.

21:07.068 --> 21:08.268
All of these laws need to be

21:10.313 --> 21:20.517
evaluated under this general rubric of whether or not fundamental rights are being suspended or fundamental rights are being effectively turned off, if you will.

21:20.597 --> 21:34.922
If fundamental rights are being suspended for some reason or another, emergency or exception, then we need to decide whether or not it's okay for the government to do that.

21:36.172 --> 21:48.722
We need to understand that very much similar to how someone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, there are certain situations where the government should be presumed to be right.

21:49.827 --> 22:00.937
because we elected those people, and we thought they were good people when we elected them, so we should assume that they have good intentions for what they're doing, even if what's on its face seems like, well, this is inconvenient.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.380
An example might be zoning laws.

22:04.000 --> 22:15.491
If they suddenly decided to change some of the streets nearby you to zoning differently so that some business could move in there, you wouldn't hold them to what is called strict scrutiny.

22:16.457 --> 22:33.223
under those cases, you would assume, and the courts would say that they only need to have a rational reason for what they're doing, a hypothetical reason even, like, we think that this area in the future would be a great place for businesses, so we want to seed that activity now, would be enough.

22:33.804 --> 22:40.466
They don't need to say and have a long-term study and all kinds of other things to justify the rezoning of something.

22:41.267 --> 22:44.688
Because you can also elect new people next year and they can rezone it back.

22:45.700 --> 22:55.629
But if they were going to, for example, say your kids, you know, I don't know, had to get in a van and take a ride and come back in a week without explanation.

22:56.701 --> 23:05.428
with no justification, with no good explanation for it, then you might say, well, the government might not be just assumed to be right on that.

23:05.548 --> 23:19.419
Because a fundamental right of my child and a fundamental right of me as a parent is being violated if I have to put my kids in a van at gunpoint and then they're gone for a week and they come back with a haircut and new clothes, that's not

23:20.160 --> 23:21.480
That for me is too much.

23:21.580 --> 23:39.106
So then you would hold the government to what is called strict scrutiny, where the government would have to have a very good explanation and a list of circumstances that they would say in the event of X, Y, and Z, we might need to take your kids in a white van away for a week and they would come back with a haircut and new clothes.

23:40.109 --> 23:45.715
And then we would evaluate the decision to do it based under this strict scrutiny.

23:45.755 --> 23:56.786
And we would be due some kind of process, some substantive due process to justify that the government was going to suspend our fundamental rights and the fundamental rights of our children for a week.

23:59.246 --> 24:17.116
And so the real legal argument to be made by Aaron Siri about the PREP Act, or the legal argument to be made about any of these laws is, A, a fundamental right is being violated, and B, the government should not be allowed to do this

24:18.359 --> 24:20.622
passing the rational basis test alone.

24:21.362 --> 24:27.469
The government should be held to strict scrutiny and strict scrutiny would require substantive due process.

24:27.549 --> 24:38.922
Something should have to happen, you know, have a meeting, have more than a signed declaration that I think we are in trouble and I need an emergency declaration.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.088
And so I'm not a lawyer.

24:44.588 --> 24:46.089
I don't know what I'm talking about.

24:46.769 --> 24:56.874
And it would be great if Aaron Seery would take this little video right here, a little clip of this, and then do a whole 45-minute presentation about how the Seventh Amendment has nothing to do with it.

24:56.894 --> 24:58.995
Jurisdiction stripping doesn't mean anything.

24:59.495 --> 25:01.936
And the rational basis test is just fine here.

25:04.605 --> 25:07.866
or strict scrutiny, he doesn't understand what that means.

25:07.906 --> 25:19.069
It would be great if there would be some actual response to this argument, this discussion, instead of a, yeah, let's take the PREP Act down because it's unconstitutional.

25:19.109 --> 25:28.831
If you're going to do that, you need to be able to describe why, perhaps on its face, just as it's written, it's unconstitutional.

25:28.911 --> 25:31.932
And the only way to do that in American law

25:32.452 --> 25:34.575
You're gonna need to use some of those words.

25:35.876 --> 25:51.116
The Federalist Society, or lawyers that are members of it, ought to understand what I'm talking about, so any of the friends that you have at work, or your partners at work, or some dude that you know from your bowling league or whatever that's a lawyer, send them the clip.

25:52.298 --> 26:04.985
Who is this clown with the upside-down flag, the distress signal in America that claims that he knows how to constitutionally challenge these laws, but no one's listening to him?

26:06.265 --> 26:16.071
That claims that he also knows some much more biologically plausible and parsimonious explanation for what's going on here, and everybody's just ignoring him.

26:16.651 --> 26:18.072
Actually, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:18.112 --> 26:20.173
is even ignoring him, and he's got him in his book.

26:22.950 --> 26:28.473
We need to break this threshold now because the elevator pitch is good enough for anyone to hear it.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.975
Anybody that genuinely wants to hear it.

26:31.875 --> 26:35.097
We are at that stage right now where the sword is sharp.

26:35.157 --> 26:38.039
All we have to do is hand it to someone and watch them go.

26:39.860 --> 26:42.781
Nobody needs to hat tip giga ohm.

26:42.822 --> 26:50.606
They just need to say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system was actually dumb before the pandemic.

26:53.649 --> 26:55.730
and that murder was used to cover that up.

26:55.790 --> 27:14.558
Murder was used to sculpt a perfect little narrative about a spreading novel pathogen that allowed us to sell products, to move money, to set up programs, to bamboozle whole departments, universities, and governments.

27:16.172 --> 27:28.498
There are lots of people who are not sophisticated enough to understand what happened, but we at GigaOM Biological actually have a slide deck that can kind of explain it.

27:29.299 --> 27:35.462
It's a really long ladder that can go all the way down to the bottom of the cave if somebody dares to start climbing it.

27:36.642 --> 27:37.763
It's not that painful.

27:37.963 --> 27:43.606
It's got good cushy rungs on it, but it's still climbing a rope ladder.

27:43.646 --> 27:44.426
It's still work.

27:44.926 --> 27:45.967
Nobody can do for you.

27:50.697 --> 27:53.218
And so, yeah, we need a new consensus about these things.

27:53.258 --> 27:54.039
I'm not going to do that.

27:54.059 --> 27:57.100
I don't know where I was spun all out of control there for a second.

27:57.140 --> 28:04.324
I don't even know what happened, but that's what happens when you're talking about this new kind of totalitarianism and you had your head in this bag for so long.

28:05.465 --> 28:19.032
And, and with so many of these people, I had to explain who Jessica Hockett was again, to somebody who was getting into her and thinking she was funny and a good writer and noticing that Michael Yeadon is, is, uh, is promoting her.

28:23.328 --> 28:28.592
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm no longer that surprised.

28:30.553 --> 28:33.675
It's just one coordinated operation.

28:33.795 --> 28:45.303
Most of whom, most of the people that matter and that have been substantially deviant from the Scooby-Doo story are outside of the United States.

28:46.783 --> 28:49.605
The only significant ones, I guess you could say,

28:52.073 --> 28:55.014
They all had books before the pandemic.

28:55.074 --> 29:03.097
So it's, it's, it's, uh, for me, it's very, very obvious that what we're watching is an elaborate performance.

29:03.197 --> 29:05.417
The stage is a lot of times social media.

29:05.457 --> 29:07.058
It's a lot of times podcasts.

29:08.812 --> 29:16.960
And it is these acolytes that we've all been promoting for these years, thinking that these were the people that were really fighting and risking it all.

29:17.020 --> 29:33.095
These are the ones that are hired by and supported by the people behind the scenes of Locals and Substack and X. And the sponsors that also pay into these platforms are also supporting these people.

29:33.956 --> 29:36.979
And so you really have, oh, I like the way you think.

29:38.160 --> 29:53.335
You really have these people that pretend to be censored on the very platforms that are promoting them, pretend to be being punished on the very platforms that are allowing them to rise.

29:55.149 --> 30:05.679
and very much allowed to complain about the so-called censorship on LinkedIn or the censorship of the demonetization of their YouTube channel.

30:06.620 --> 30:10.324
It's all the same story with these people and none of them have lost anything.

30:11.665 --> 30:15.629
Was Jessica Rose trying to get tenure somewhere before the pandemic?

30:16.130 --> 30:19.112
What was she doing before the pandemic and what is she doing now?

30:20.236 --> 30:25.859
As far as I can tell, she enjoys a very lucrative sub stack business at this point in time.

30:26.259 --> 30:40.747
And anybody who has a lucrative sub stack right now must be very, very thankful that all they really need to do is dictate a few thoughts into a text or speech to text program and correct the grammar and hit send.

30:43.228 --> 30:51.390
Some people, like Robert Malone, probably have a small staff of people that's using AI and feeding it previous text and having it spit things out.

30:53.550 --> 31:03.253
We're dealing with the utmost in malevolence here, under the pretense that anybody that gets on social media and thinks that it's real is a sucker.

31:04.413 --> 31:07.754
And I think that's what all of these people operate under the principle of.

31:08.473 --> 31:14.120
That anybody that thinks that social media is not just a military program is a sucker.

31:17.524 --> 31:26.376
And in order to be a member of the elite, governing elite, or audition for the governing elite, you're going to need to be able to understand that difference.

31:27.608 --> 31:39.999
The difference between the masses and this group that you're trying to audition to join or participating in their little charade in hopes that they'll take you in on the next show.

31:40.700 --> 31:41.821
That's what you see here.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.243
I have no doubt about it in my mind.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.667
And some of them are amateur contractors spinning their teams up.

31:49.167 --> 31:53.011
Others of them have been recruited during the course of this little maneuver.

31:56.308 --> 32:05.473
and every one of them seems to have a book or two or a substack and none of them really has a great track record leaning into the pandemic.

32:06.173 --> 32:06.633
None of them.

32:07.934 --> 32:23.722
None of them was minding their own business, you know, working as a zookeeper or I don't know, as a shopkeeper or I don't know, and maybe, you know, I would believe it a lot more if there was somebody that didn't have a highly dubious record

32:26.587 --> 32:29.468
A highly dubious record, a highly dubious background.

32:29.528 --> 32:32.650
I mean, Jessica Rose, incredibly ridiculous.

32:33.690 --> 32:41.094
Ahmed Malik didn't even emerge on the scene until half the planet had been coerced into taking a shot.

32:43.281 --> 32:56.614
George Webb was on 60 Minutes in February of 2020 crying about some American Air Force lady taking and seating the whole pandemic in Wuhan with a bicycle.

33:00.700 --> 33:06.062
And the crazy part is, is that George Webb had blocked me at the beginning of the pandemic when I joined Twitter.

33:06.662 --> 33:14.486
One of the first weird things that happened to me in like the first couple of weeks of my membership of drastic is that somebody sent me a tweet of someone that I couldn't see.

33:15.426 --> 33:17.267
I didn't even understand what that meant.

33:17.347 --> 33:20.628
And then they explained to me, oh, you can go and make a different, like a log out or whatever.

33:20.668 --> 33:23.649
And then if you log out, you can see the tweet and it was George Webb.

33:24.910 --> 33:30.452
And what was happening at this time, of course, I was streaming with Kevin McCairn and

33:31.184 --> 33:45.979
and Addie Adds and Paul Cattrell, who was George Webb's go-to MD hero for the next three years of the pandemic.

33:46.700 --> 33:47.641
And he had blocked me.

33:49.286 --> 34:06.791
So in retrospect, it's very easy to see that in 2022, and I finally kind of could see that, and then found out from Mark that this guy was meddling with Mark before the pandemic, and that he was like on all these podcasts with all these people before the pandemic, then it just, it all clicked.

34:06.871 --> 34:08.691
Like, wow, that is so bizarre.

34:08.772 --> 34:13.573
Then what are Kevin McCairn and Paul Cuttrell, what's going on with them?

34:14.602 --> 34:34.598
And then the years go on and the performance kept going and the only thing that really happened was is that they all kind of were fake fighting each other and all agreed that I was no one to be paid attention to, that I was an idiot, that I was a fool, that I was lost, that I was controlled, that I was an egomaniac.

34:35.913 --> 34:37.714
And they all played that same game.

34:37.754 --> 34:38.835
They all did it to us.

34:38.875 --> 34:52.624
We all lost our minds on this and we need to make sure that we do not lose sight of this as we move forward in the next couple of weeks and some major crazy bait is thrown our way.

34:54.155 --> 34:59.259
That's why I'm getting all fired up about this, because I do think there's going to be some crazy bait thrown our way.

34:59.279 --> 35:02.081
I don't think it's going to be that significant in reality.

35:02.121 --> 35:08.266
I don't think it has actually the potential that they want it to be perceived as having.

35:08.286 --> 35:14.631
It's not going to be a civil war in America, but boy, would they love it if we did that stupid stuff.

35:15.952 --> 35:20.255
But weaponized piles of money are using their acolytes on social media

35:21.482 --> 35:22.842
And they will continue to do it.

35:22.922 --> 35:25.163
So will Donald Trump win?

35:25.243 --> 35:26.183
Will Kamala win?

35:26.223 --> 35:29.204
It doesn't really matter, because this is how we are being governed.

35:29.244 --> 35:49.848
And if you see it this way, then when the stage changes, and the flashing happens, and the scenery moves up, and these things come in, and whatever happens, and then the motorcycles in the steel sphere fire back up and start going around like this again, and everybody's arguing about what the motorcycles, which one's going to crash,

35:51.653 --> 35:53.515
You can remain calm in your seat.

35:53.555 --> 35:55.076
You don't have to run for the exits.

35:55.096 --> 35:59.160
You don't have to, you know, just keep eating your popcorn.

36:01.742 --> 36:07.087
Worst case scenario, we might have to take a couple of weeks off because of whatever they're doing.

36:07.988 --> 36:09.569
But they are gonna be doing something.

36:09.629 --> 36:10.690
I'm very convinced of it.

36:10.730 --> 36:14.454
They're gonna be doing something to get us to make mistakes.

36:14.674 --> 36:16.756
And those mistakes are only gonna be

36:18.305 --> 36:30.254
They're only going to be possible if we are actively engaged in social media and thinking that somehow we are gleaning real useful information to make choices about the future.

36:30.294 --> 36:32.716
And it's not going to be available for a while there.

36:32.976 --> 36:36.459
It's really not going to be available for a while there.

36:37.099 --> 36:42.323
And once you see that and understand that, then it'll make more sense what I show you today.

36:45.538 --> 36:49.602
Wow, so I really got off my track there somehow.

36:50.523 --> 36:52.005
I'm not going to go through all that again.

36:52.505 --> 36:54.547
Let's just do this right here.

36:56.910 --> 36:57.170
Ha!

36:57.190 --> 37:01.394
37 minutes of nothing.

37:01.595 --> 37:02.996
Sorry about that.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.739
Sometimes I just need a warm up.

37:08.819 --> 37:10.400
Sometimes I just need to decompress.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.240
This is a Monday.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.282
And this is a don't take the bait thing.

37:15.322 --> 37:17.383
This is the first video I'm going to start out with.

37:20.024 --> 37:23.346
It's something that you might not watch and that's okay if you don't watch it.

37:23.586 --> 37:26.888
It's actually better if you don't watch it because it'll be a little bit more...

37:28.854 --> 37:34.759
It'll be a little more unnerving when you hear it then because realize that lots and lots of people do watch it.

37:34.799 --> 37:36.300
Lots of young people watch it.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.622
I'm not sure really what the demographic is.

37:40.124 --> 37:45.548
But I do, I will confess that I am looking for these mid-level

37:46.755 --> 37:49.338
Let's call them influencers for lack of a better word.

37:50.199 --> 37:52.461
Performers, auditioners, performers.

37:53.902 --> 37:59.108
I'm looking for these different performing shows, auditioning shows, looking to make it to the next level.

37:59.648 --> 38:02.311
And so they usually have between 250,000 and 750,000 people subscribing.

38:02.331 --> 38:03.392
Tim Poole's not that kind of guy.

38:08.820 --> 38:13.164
but the guys that are on Tim Pool's podcast often are.

38:13.645 --> 38:22.113
And so it's very, it can be very instructive in my imagination, at least, to go on and listen to these people with that filter in place.

38:22.213 --> 38:30.120
The filter is that there's this demographic of college kids, demographic of recent college graduates that really need

38:31.201 --> 38:31.801
distracting.

38:31.861 --> 38:43.103
They really need a very effective hamster wheel with lots of lights and rewards and fun music and an essential oil sense.

38:43.563 --> 38:58.586
Otherwise, they might get off the wheel and find somebody like me, find somebody like Mark, find somebody like Scott Shara or Joe Marshall, and we would then very quickly have a problem because these kids are smart.

38:59.466 --> 39:02.309
They've been bored for a while and they know that they've been lied to.

39:03.170 --> 39:07.254
It's just a question of will they meet someone that will tell them the truth or just another liar?

39:08.555 --> 39:09.516
Because there's plenty of them.

39:10.577 --> 39:12.478
And so you need to see what the bait is.

39:12.518 --> 39:17.283
You need to see how bad it is right now and how close they want us to come.

39:17.984 --> 39:22.448
So I'm just going to, you know, this is just instructive and then we're going to move on to biology after this verse.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.222
I don't even know how long we'll watch this video.

39:25.242 --> 39:42.947
Yes, Huberman, Chris Williamson, that's... Chris Williamson is an excellent example of that mid-level auditioner that actually gets quite promoted a lot on, you know, by Joe Rogan or the people that are in that circle are going through his show a lot.

39:42.987 --> 39:47.908
Like, Eric Weinstein has been on that guy's show like five times in the last four years.

39:51.857 --> 39:58.585
Huberman is a real advanced enchanter like he's impressive Are you sick you're saying?

39:58.625 --> 40:02.430
How do you think a civil war or a breakdown of the United States would begin you have a theory?

40:02.450 --> 40:02.670
Yes?

40:02.770 --> 40:04.092
Yes, I have multiple.

40:04.132 --> 40:05.253
I've now real quick.

40:05.273 --> 40:07.295
Sorry, so I just want to make sure I'm clear here

40:08.516 --> 40:15.305
Following the election, you have already said you think there will be 1,000 deaths, politically motivated deaths by April, is that correct?

40:15.325 --> 40:15.465
Yes.

40:15.866 --> 40:23.036
And either this will be the effect of or the beginning of what may be a collapse or breakdown?

40:24.494 --> 40:25.935
I think it'll be a war.

40:26.055 --> 40:28.217
I think you'll still probably get your groceries.

40:28.237 --> 40:29.037
You'll still be able to watch.

40:29.238 --> 40:30.719
And so who is this guy?

40:30.779 --> 40:32.660
Does he have a faculty position?

40:32.820 --> 40:34.442
Or is he an academic?

40:34.582 --> 40:37.624
Or is he a pilot?

40:39.205 --> 40:41.147
Is he an advanced Fortnite player?

40:42.147 --> 40:44.209
Is he a ranked Call of Duty player?

40:44.869 --> 40:46.110
Who are we dealing with here?

40:46.230 --> 40:48.993
Listen to the language of certainty.

40:49.753 --> 40:53.974
And listen to the kind of pseudo checkmate bombing run he goes on here.

40:54.474 --> 40:56.695
It is absolutely absurd.

40:56.735 --> 40:59.056
This can't be anything other than a shithead.

40:59.516 --> 41:03.037
Yet, this is what a lot of young people are listening to.

41:03.117 --> 41:03.757
This is a lot.

41:04.137 --> 41:08.218
And if you listen to this, it's already thoughts going through your head.

41:08.338 --> 41:16.440
It's already adding to the noise that's rising to the level of full attention, which is not good.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.261
So I'm not doing this to you

41:19.261 --> 41:23.924
for any other reason than to illustrate the dangers that are out there right now.

41:23.964 --> 41:25.005
How bad it really is.

41:25.045 --> 41:33.430
You have already, most of you already have a very finely tuned filter and are very good at sorting this whole thing out.

41:33.891 --> 41:35.932
There are children in the world that are not.

41:36.212 --> 41:37.493
Lots and lots of them.

41:40.789 --> 42:03.353
Netflix keep in mind in Syria or Ukraine people the horrible thing is you'll still have to go to your job you'll still have to pay your bills you'll still watch Netflix with the kids it's just Chicago's being shelled and and I want to I do want you to begin with your scenario and I want to stress this too it's a point that I like to make when I was in Egypt in 2013 across the street from the Hilton was McDonald's yeah

42:03.433 --> 42:09.016
There's a guy sitting down eating a cheeseburger and watching soccer, and three blocks away was the revolution.

42:09.036 --> 42:12.598
APCs were surrounding, Blackhawks were flying overhead.

42:13.179 --> 42:18.422
We got in a car and drove to Heliopolis and went to the mall where everybody was going about their days and nothing was happening.

42:18.802 --> 42:25.906
So with that in mind, people seem to think that a war starting means literally you're in your home and bolts are flying.

42:26.387 --> 42:29.288
But explain to me what you think is going to happen in the next couple of months.

42:31.340 --> 42:37.524
I've studied dozens of different historic crises, and the reason I think we're going to have a war is partly intuitive.

42:37.564 --> 42:53.276
You just look outside, but it's also I've studied almost every single model of the science of history where people have been trying to develop models to predict history, and about five different historic models, most of them dating to the 20th century, say that in the 2020s America would have a civil war.

42:54.156 --> 42:56.797
And I was like this is like Strauss house generational.

42:56.837 --> 43:00.338
So Strauss how David Hackett Fisher, Peter Turchin.

43:01.198 --> 43:02.158
There's a handful of others.

43:02.178 --> 43:03.959
There's Goldstein is a really terrible author.

43:04.899 --> 43:09.781
The ones I pull on the most are Peter Turchin and David Hackett Fisher.

43:09.861 --> 43:12.361
They really get into the data computer science level.

43:13.042 --> 43:15.342
And so now imagine where we are here.

43:15.422 --> 43:17.443
Is this any different than a Kevin McKernan?

43:18.410 --> 43:26.114
who can just go around and say, yeah, you know, in the Burkhalter lab, they've already screened several different subjects for, you know, advanced nanopore.

43:26.574 --> 43:30.997
And they see, you know, replicates of 45, blah, blah, blah.

43:33.078 --> 43:42.563
And it could be all of it very technically accurate and completely scientifically irrelevant to the point of where we're going and what we need to teach our children.

43:42.603 --> 43:44.464
Because of course, it's just a hamster wheel.

43:45.322 --> 43:55.754
And anytime you grab onto any of these little rungs of the wheel, if it's cycle count or if it's, I don't know, the primer dimers or whatever.

43:55.834 --> 44:01.361
And in this case, if you grab onto any of these things, well, I don't know any of those authors, so I better Google those things.

44:01.381 --> 44:04.004
You've just grabbed onto the wheel and started running again.

44:06.141 --> 44:15.410
You don't need to waste even five minutes of your time trying to figure out who those people are or what models of human history he's talking about.

44:16.531 --> 44:21.435
Models of human history that can predict something bad will happen every couple hundred years?

44:22.016 --> 44:24.838
Oh wow, those models must be very sophisticated.

44:28.442 --> 44:29.763
See what we're dealing with here?

44:33.203 --> 44:39.467
And kids watch this, you know, with their headphones on so they can't be distracted and they can hear it perfectly.

44:41.188 --> 44:43.169
But their phone turns sideways.

44:46.031 --> 44:56.217
And so if something happens on social media that is hyped up to be the beginning of something terrible, they've been primed.

44:58.541 --> 45:01.624
So I'm not saying anything is terrifying or it's scary.

45:01.664 --> 45:03.706
I want you to see how clownish this is.

45:03.746 --> 45:05.607
Cause this isn't going to motivate anyone.

45:05.667 --> 45:07.529
This guy can't motivate anybody.

45:08.430 --> 45:13.014
Is somebody really listening to this guy and going, wow, he's really opening my eyes.

45:13.094 --> 45:17.198
I trust this dude because of, because why?

45:19.320 --> 45:22.883
Because of what I said earlier, because he looks like a very skilled Fortnite player.

45:28.069 --> 45:30.210
I think that's a blower or something across the street.

45:31.590 --> 45:32.090
Oh, darn.

45:34.051 --> 45:35.512
I might have already spoiled that.

45:35.552 --> 45:35.832
Sorry.

45:35.872 --> 45:38.893
I want to listen to a little bit more of the model part, because it's really funny.

45:39.253 --> 45:43.735
The Fall of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, Fisher, Peter Turchin.

45:44.595 --> 45:45.555
There's a handful of others.

45:45.595 --> 45:47.376
There's Goldstein, who's a really terrible author.

45:48.296 --> 45:50.177
The ones I pull on the most are

45:50.777 --> 45:55.762
Peter Turchin and David Hackett Fisher, they really get into the data computer science level.

45:56.442 --> 46:09.955
And there's a handful of, there's like four variables, there's three variables that Peter Turchin looked at, where if you look at these variables, and he's used this for over a dozen crises over history, you can predict the years these historic crises happen in.

46:10.315 --> 46:12.157
Those are average wages,

46:12.977 --> 46:15.580
income inequality, and competition for elite jobs.

46:15.640 --> 46:24.669
Those three variables were able to predict the fall of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, the Black Death, the French Wars of Religion, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution.

46:25.049 --> 46:28.132
So see the spell casting that's happening here?

46:28.192 --> 46:34.658
It's the absolute, it's a battleship size mountain of bullshit being thrown at you at once.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.621
Models of world history,

46:39.458 --> 46:44.986
using three variables alone, have predicted x, y, and z.

46:48.430 --> 46:57.656
Now, I don't know if we have to argue about whether human history and its cataloging and archiving are high fidelity or not.

46:57.757 --> 47:16.830
I don't know if we need to discuss the idea that the victor writes the history, or if we have to discuss the idea of our history being a lie, or he just thinks that he has access to the accurate history, I guess, and he also has access to all these models, and it only needs, think about this, kids,

47:18.473 --> 47:27.878
Products of our school system are very vulnerable right now to this kind of stuff and they don't have any adults to listen to and that's what we need to start providing them.

47:29.279 --> 47:32.661
We need to throw a lifeline to the kids that watch this.

47:33.982 --> 47:36.623
25,000 people watch this guy live.

47:37.404 --> 47:40.645
Sometimes it's as high as 50,000 if he has the right guest.

47:40.665 --> 47:41.866
50,000 people live.

47:50.026 --> 47:51.206
Did he say four variables?

47:51.266 --> 47:51.566
Sorry.

47:51.787 --> 47:52.447
So many more.

47:52.647 --> 47:52.847
Wow.

47:52.927 --> 47:56.408
And these crises happen every 250 years like clockwork.

47:56.828 --> 48:00.709
The last real version in the Western world was the French Revolution.

48:01.089 --> 48:06.651
Before then, the wars of religion in the mid 1600s that killed a third of Europe's population.

48:06.751 --> 48:11.172
Before then, the Black Death in the 1300s, which killed half of Europe's population.

48:11.532 --> 48:14.313
So these are patterns that we have computer models to study.

48:14.653 --> 48:15.654
They're very consistent.

48:15.674 --> 48:19.635
And so I'm looking to all these historic examples to inform my analysis of what I'm about to say.

48:21.977 --> 48:41.419
oh darn it we're gonna spoil it again so that's pretty impressive right he's he's said he's stacked up all these chips in front of him like you know i got this i know this i checked this i checked that i read this book you didn't read i know these models you didn't read plus computers computers computers ai

48:42.600 --> 48:44.502
What are you going to do at that point?

48:45.163 --> 48:49.187
This guy must know more than anyone on earth.

48:50.528 --> 48:53.391
He's just because he decided to read the right things.

48:53.471 --> 48:56.655
I guess this is the dude that everybody's going to talk to.

48:56.695 --> 48:57.836
Do you know who talked to him?

48:57.896 --> 48:59.558
Tim Bilyeu, for example.

49:01.553 --> 49:05.455
Another one of these mid-level guys, the impact factor or whatever it's called.

49:05.515 --> 49:07.657
That guy also is one of these dudes.

49:07.997 --> 49:10.799
He had Rodney on his show before the pandemic.

49:10.839 --> 49:12.860
That guy's been rising for a while now.

49:15.261 --> 49:17.242
And he's been on there very recently.

49:17.262 --> 49:22.906
He's doing the rounds just like the guy with the curly hair and the everyday spy shit.

49:23.286 --> 49:29.550
There's three variables that Peter Turchin looked at where if you look at these variables, and he's used this for over,

49:30.330 --> 49:31.991
a dozen crises over history.

49:32.031 --> 49:35.454
You can predict the years these historic crises happen in.

49:35.854 --> 49:41.118
Those are average wages, income inequality, and competition for elite jobs.

49:41.198 --> 49:51.145
Those three variables were able to predict the fall of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, the Black Death, the French Wars of Religion, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and so many more.

49:51.645 --> 49:55.126
And these crises happen every 250 years like clockwork.

49:55.546 --> 49:59.407
The last real version in the Western world was the French Revolution.

49:59.807 --> 50:05.389
Before then, the wars of religion in the mid-1600s that killed a third of Europe's population.

50:05.469 --> 50:07.689
Before then, the Black Death in the 1300s.

50:08.029 --> 50:12.670
My guess is that people like this would actually fail at starting a fire in a wood stove.

50:13.731 --> 50:14.771
And I'm not even joking.

50:15.757 --> 50:21.661
I think that you could get this person to smoke out a house by just closing the damper.

50:21.681 --> 50:28.926
I mean, we're dealing with some very, very malevolent, like this is terrible now.

50:29.625 --> 50:32.547
And so we need to have pity for our neighbor.

50:32.587 --> 50:34.568
We need to look with kindness to them.

50:34.668 --> 50:36.570
Kind words don't cost us anything.

50:37.130 --> 50:47.617
And as much as I would love to be and embrace that kind of energy, it has become very clear to me that that's not the way forward now.

50:49.259 --> 51:00.727
I and we all have to let go of that energy and focus on trying to embrace the people that are willing to go forward with this truth that they murdered a lot of people and lied about it.

51:01.187 --> 51:02.948
And it's a very simple explanation.

51:02.968 --> 51:05.670
You only need to look at the opioid crisis.

51:05.710 --> 51:12.335
You only need to try to figure out whether they got pure oxygen or high flow oxygen at the start of their protocol.

51:13.455 --> 51:23.220
And you only need to realize that these products already had names before the pandemic and calling them investigational vaccines and going along with that is what these people did.

51:23.720 --> 51:36.966
And by doing that and going along with this narrative of something bad happening in the background, these people can directly contributed to the murder of thousands of people in America and maybe around the world.

51:37.026 --> 51:37.346
I don't know.

51:38.871 --> 51:48.617
And so now the new hamster wheels are being rolled out so that as people get tired of running in the COVID wheel, there are other hamster wheels to run in.

51:48.657 --> 51:51.679
I don't know if you've noticed, I think some people in the chat have already mentioned it.

51:51.699 --> 51:57.803
I thought I saw something solar, but there's even solar weathermen on the YouTube now.

51:58.911 --> 52:11.437
and extreme weathermen on the YouTube now that have rolled out these multi-screen, multi-webcam to monitor hurricanes and monitor the solar flares.

52:11.538 --> 52:13.579
It's extraordinary what's going on right now.

52:13.619 --> 52:15.440
And that's also not spontaneous.

52:16.400 --> 52:23.002
This is by design because we are being ruled by these military programs and the content that's being forced on them.

52:23.202 --> 52:25.143
It's what killed half of Europe's population.

52:25.523 --> 52:28.324
So these are patterns that we have computer models to study.

52:28.644 --> 52:29.644
They're very consistent.

52:29.684 --> 52:33.685
And so I'm looking to all these historic examples to inform my analysis of what I'm about to say.

52:33.705 --> 52:35.246
So how does it begin?

52:35.706 --> 52:38.387
So I have a tier list of multiple variables.

52:38.627 --> 52:44.189
My top... Did you see the way that he handed it off to Tim and Tim says, so how does it begin?

52:44.209 --> 52:45.269
Did you see the smile?

52:47.025 --> 52:50.187
In case it's not obvious, they are performing for the young.

52:51.228 --> 52:59.153
They are actively engaging in theater that is directed by and scripted by the people that make them rise.

53:03.716 --> 53:09.721
I don't care if they know, I don't care if they're smart or not, this is a problem.

53:10.961 --> 53:14.024
And it is a very, very clear example

53:14.926 --> 53:18.068
that can be used to illustrate how we are being manipulated.

53:18.168 --> 53:20.850
These two guys are working together.

53:20.930 --> 53:26.934
Tim Pool provides the platform, this guy provides the script, and they go off on it together.

53:26.994 --> 53:31.437
He has rehearsed this on other people's podcasts and laid it out now.

53:32.057 --> 53:34.259
on one of the biggest ones, Tim Pool.

53:34.439 --> 53:35.560
Listen again, please.

53:50.012 --> 54:05.506
so how does it begin so i have a tier list of multiple variables my top one was a financial crisis and now he almost paused with his hands like this so i have this tier list of variables he handed the mic like

54:09.537 --> 54:11.238
And Tim Pool said, so how does it start?

54:11.738 --> 54:17.901
And then he went like this, almost like Mr. Evil or some shit, and then very quickly corrected himself.

54:18.021 --> 54:22.484
Watch it again, because it is absolutely malevolence.

54:22.684 --> 54:33.069
And it is malevolence on the amateur level, because we are at the stage where the shit is breaking down, where the real theater is breaking down, and you can see it in real time.

54:33.089 --> 54:34.550
This is from like a couple days ago.

54:34.710 --> 54:40.934
Be consistent and so I'm looking to all these historic examples to inform my analysis of what I'm about to say So how does it begin?

54:41.394 --> 55:02.368
So I have a tier list of multiple variables my top one was a financial crisis and that was going back years I figured out a lot of this stuff in 2020 and financial crisis was my top bet because you look at the English Civil War the French Revolution and the France's previous crises in the 13 in the 1600s Etc.

55:02.849 --> 55:03.950
And it's normal.

55:04.050 --> 55:04.570
It's magic

55:05.671 --> 55:06.391
It's magical.

55:08.292 --> 55:31.765
It is a malevolent enchantment of two or three people agreeing to talk about shit and agreeing that things are interesting, agreeing that this guy's got answers, agreeing to listen to him, and it creates something that doesn't happen when that guy podcasts all by himself, because that's not the kind of message that he's sending.

55:33.291 --> 55:36.073
Tim Pool plays the role of the enchanted.

55:36.733 --> 55:38.695
He plays the role of the enchanter.

55:41.557 --> 55:44.859
There's no such thing happening here with GigaOM Biological.

55:44.939 --> 55:50.663
If you don't like what you're hearing, you don't like what you see, you don't trust what you see, there's nothing else here.

55:51.783 --> 55:54.165
There's nobody for me to bounce my lies off of.

55:54.225 --> 55:56.687
There's nobody for me to say, what do you think?

55:56.727 --> 55:58.288
And they say, oh, I think you're smart.

56:01.470 --> 56:03.051
That's exactly what's happening here.

56:04.321 --> 56:06.803
It's much more complicated than a laugh track.

56:11.366 --> 56:16.330
It is much more complicated than a laugh track now, ladies and gentlemen.

56:16.350 --> 56:20.173
And we need to wake up and realize it, that our kids are being influenced.

56:20.733 --> 56:30.741
Not just about what they put on their face, or what clothes they want to wear, what soap they're going to use, or what shoes they're going to buy, or what sneakers they're chasing.

56:30.761 --> 56:31.602
No, no, no.

56:33.459 --> 56:36.802
Also about what they think about the adults in their life.

56:36.962 --> 56:39.184
Also what they think about their peers.

56:39.404 --> 56:41.085
Also what they think about sex.

56:41.345 --> 56:42.846
Also what they think about love.

56:43.367 --> 56:51.153
Also what they think about... It's not spontaneous.

56:52.534 --> 56:55.977
So much of this is now scripted because it's allowed.

56:57.739 --> 57:02.083
There are no rules about lying to people on YouTube or on social media.

57:02.203 --> 57:09.709
No rules about, you can get mad if somebody's lying, but there are no rules about it.

57:11.570 --> 57:23.380
It's not illegal to make a YouTube channel with all your friends and pretend that they're people that are randomly chosen to give cars to, when in reality, you're just giving them their own car back.

57:24.641 --> 57:25.422
You can do that.

57:27.230 --> 57:36.716
And if you get a million subscribers and all kinds of sponsors to be on your, and make $100,000 a year by doing those kinds of videos, it's totally okay.

57:38.017 --> 57:40.798
Nobody can get mad and it can be much worse than that.

57:41.799 --> 57:42.259
And it is.

57:44.020 --> 57:54.467
And when it comes to the real politic of the minds of our children, the minds of our college kids, the minds of our young adults that are not yet having children, but thinking about it,

57:55.953 --> 58:09.442
the peers of Tim Pool, the 30-somethings, ladies and gentlemen, they are wholly being governed through their skilled social media use, and this is a perfect example of it.

58:12.236 --> 58:14.817
No useful information is being given away there.

58:14.857 --> 58:16.258
It's exactly the opposite.

58:16.398 --> 58:22.121
Obviously we can see it, but what we need to do is start fighting actively to make other people see it.

58:22.201 --> 58:23.742
Young people need to see this.

58:23.842 --> 58:26.103
Young adults need to see it.

58:26.663 --> 58:28.364
There is no truth available here.

58:39.468 --> 58:47.454
I've been to so many award shows where the winner comes back to the table and very modestly says, oh, it's not like I'm curing cancer or anything.

58:47.514 --> 58:54.438
So it is so humbling and inspiring to be sitting here with people who sit back down and say, actually, I am curing cancer.

58:54.519 --> 58:59.082
So thank you very much for letting me be part of this amazing evening.

59:03.389 --> 59:09.635
Victor Ambrose and Gary Ruvkin have provided groundbreaking insight into how living things build the trillions of proteins that run them.

59:10.296 --> 59:16.622
They discovered tiny instruction sets called microRNAs, the key to an intricate system by which genes regulate other genes.

59:19.965 --> 59:22.988
When I was a kid, I remember being curious about the world.

59:24.198 --> 59:28.320
I remember reading a book about Clyde Tombach, who discovered Pluto.

59:28.801 --> 59:31.562
And he was a farm boy who was an amateur astronomer.

59:31.642 --> 59:34.244
So I think I identified with him because I was growing up on a farm.

59:34.824 --> 59:38.906
And so there was this possibility that somebody like me could become a scientist.

59:42.829 --> 59:45.750
The space program somehow captivated me.

59:45.850 --> 59:46.771
I was eight.

59:47.915 --> 59:50.779
When you're eight years old... Is that Bret Weinstein's brother?

59:52.482 --> 59:54.865
My self-esteem was not based on my athletic ability.

59:57.749 --> 01:00:01.956
I found my equipoise in imagining myself as a scientist.

01:00:02.496 --> 01:00:03.238
That's what I could be.

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:08.209
We were postdocs together and collaborated.

01:00:08.509 --> 01:00:12.410
And then we both started our labs at Harvard on different campuses at Harvard.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:17.631
And I think we sort of decided to split up the project that we'd begun together as postdocs.

01:00:20.712 --> 01:00:27.393
The dramatic moment came when each of us had decoded some of the letters that correspond to these genes.

01:00:28.194 --> 01:00:30.074
And we wanted to compare the sequences.

01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:32.395
I was working in my office, and he calls me up.

01:00:32.435 --> 01:00:33.075
He goes, do you see it?

01:00:33.095 --> 01:00:33.575
Do you see it?

01:00:36.391 --> 01:00:40.514
Oh, this was 92 when we had started in 82.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.897
So it was a 10-year culmination.

01:00:46.379 --> 01:00:51.283
The discovery of microRNAs was the first step in a small RNA revolution.

01:00:51.763 --> 01:01:00.730
There's an enormous range of biological processes that microRNAs are involved in, from cancer to heart disease to neurodegenerative diseases and so forth.

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:08.030
When I was a first year graduate student, I didn't feel like I was the smartest kid in the class.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:12.253
But now looking back on it, I was definitely the luckiest kid in that class.

01:01:12.973 --> 01:01:19.819
It's an amazing thrill to be considered one of the leaders in a field because I was just trying to be pretty good.

01:01:20.854 --> 01:01:43.661
It's really you are aware right that that guy got the Nobel Prize not for micro RNAs But he got the Nobel Prize for the Google fold program or some shit like that, right do remember here What I'm showing you here is where he's being awarded a prize for micro RNAs and the discovery of them and

01:01:45.524 --> 01:01:52.106
and being awarded by Kate Beckinsale and Elon Musk, and a tribute paid to that biology.

01:01:52.187 --> 01:01:59.289
But that's not, repeat, not the biology for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:01.570
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:02:06.083 --> 01:02:12.005
But this, we're being recognized for doing something literally together by sharing information.

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:13.946
You just can't take that away from us.

01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:15.266
It's terrific.

01:02:23.649 --> 01:02:29.771
For discovering a new world of micro RNAs, the tiniest genes that are the powerful regulators of other genes.

01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:34.012
The Breakthrough Prize is awarded to Victor Ambrose and Gary Rupkin.

01:02:36.826 --> 01:02:38.768
Now keep in mind what they just said there.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:43.011
Powerful little genes that regulate other genes.

01:02:43.552 --> 01:02:54.381
So they throw that word around in a very aspecific way because, of course, Erwin Schrodinger's talking about a different kind of thing when he talks about genes.

01:02:54.461 --> 01:02:56.522
Mendel was talking about a different kind of thing.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.285
Now even micro RNAs are genes.

01:02:59.785 --> 01:03:01.647
What an interesting sort of

01:03:02.711 --> 01:03:06.258
You know, script, Kate Beckinsale reads things.

01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:08.301
She wasn't, that's not her idea.

01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:12.509
That's not her shooting off the cuff what she knows about this guy's work.

01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:13.952
That's her reading a script.

01:03:17.119 --> 01:03:19.061
Genes regulate other genes.

01:03:19.121 --> 01:03:20.222
Well, that's curious.

01:03:20.302 --> 01:03:30.770
What if there are micro RNAs in every transfection product that is made using standard commercial recombinant DNA and RNA technologies?

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:46.103
What would that, what implications could that have if micro RNAs are a source of regulation and actually genes that we don't really understand and we just gave an award for in 2015, but then didn't really need to give an award

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.564
in 2024.

01:03:49.987 --> 01:03:50.808
I'm confused.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.991
That's weird.

01:03:53.113 --> 01:03:56.020
I'll let it play out and then we'll see what the next slide has for us.

01:04:07.972 --> 01:04:10.796
I've been very inspired through my life.

01:04:10.856 --> 01:04:12.858
As a child, it was the space launches.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:22.290
And then when I decided to become a scientist, I joined an ongoing revolution in DNA, in the genomics revolution, and that's been my workshop.

01:04:22.711 --> 01:04:24.112
I want to thank you so much.

01:04:24.132 --> 01:04:25.915
I want to thank my family so much as well.

01:04:30.598 --> 01:04:36.782
I think that it's extraordinary that we as a society have supported basic science for so long.

01:04:36.822 --> 01:04:38.643
This is the secret of our success.

01:04:39.063 --> 01:04:45.948
Finally, I want to thank Candy, who's been my partner in life and in science for more than 40 years.

01:04:46.028 --> 01:04:48.269
Thank you for taking me on as your project.

01:04:50.991 --> 01:04:52.072
I can't even say anything.

01:04:53.272 --> 01:04:54.213
I can't say anything.

01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:55.414
I have nothing to say.

01:04:55.434 --> 01:04:57.155
I have nothing to say.

01:04:57.855 --> 01:04:58.516
Next, please.

01:05:00.612 --> 01:05:04.096
Oh, this is 2014, one year before he's going to explain what he found.

01:05:04.156 --> 01:05:04.716
This is cool.

01:05:05.918 --> 01:05:14.326
Today I'm going to talk about the small RNA revolution that occurred between 1990 and today and how that emerged.

01:05:14.546 --> 01:05:15.688
My name is Gary Rovkin.

01:05:16.428 --> 01:05:18.871
I'm a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.

01:05:19.705 --> 01:05:21.166
one learns as an undergrad.

01:05:21.387 --> 01:05:33.497
So since 1990, there's been this ongoing revolution realizing that small RNAs are actually some kind of regulatory, they play some kind of regulatory role.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:41.404
And now we're going to hear a very simplistic version of that regulatory role that was built in a very simplistic model.

01:05:42.285 --> 01:06:05.178
And just like the textbook behind me about prion diseases that is almost exclusively data derived from yeast experiments, we're going to hear about a regulatory mechanism that is most certainly present in our own system, but in a far more complicated and enmeshed sort of way than would be present in the organism that he identified it in.

01:06:06.567 --> 01:06:22.434
He identifies it in an organism, a maybe pattern integrity that is sufficiently simple that the role that these molecules may or may not play in that system is discernible.

01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:35.980
As the complexity of the pattern integrity in space-time gets higher, as you move into more complicated animals than what he has looked at,

01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:43.317
then the compounding complication and complexity cannot be underestimated.

01:06:44.038 --> 01:07:06.387
Even if the fundamental truth that small RNAs are also genes that regulate other genes, then we have identified another layer of complexity that cannot be accounted for in the blunt instrument known as transfection and the blunt instrument known as transformation with adenovirus or other viruses.

01:07:07.904 --> 01:07:10.345
other particles with DNA in them.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.706
And so we are really here right now.

01:07:14.766 --> 01:07:15.246
Here we go.

01:07:15.286 --> 01:07:19.748
The central dogma is the DNA to RNA to protein.

01:07:20.308 --> 01:07:26.090
And he's going to argue that the central dogma needs a little adjustment because microRNAs

01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:34.125
are a regulatory point, a general regulatory point, perhaps for every gene that's ever expressed.

01:07:34.285 --> 01:07:41.750
And perhaps multiple microRNAs have multiple roles, depending on whether we've ever looked or detected them.

01:07:43.769 --> 01:07:59.487
And so we are opening up a door of almost infinite additional complexity at a level that is more difficult for us to detect in vivo because it's a smaller signal and smaller molecules that are easier to create from the noise.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:08.704
And so here he is working in a very simple model so that he can discern them from the noise, supposedly.

01:08:08.744 --> 01:08:28.395
And if he can, then it only implies an incredible level of complexity in our own pattern integrity that would, again, underscore the absolute absurdity of using an RNA transfection in a lipid nanoparticle, proprietary or not,

01:08:29.967 --> 01:08:39.661
on healthy human beings under any pretenses, nevermind an elaborate hoax about a novel viral pandemic.

01:08:42.088 --> 01:09:00.641
They recruited people early and groomed them for a long time so that they were sure that they would stay in their lane, they were sure that they would keep saying the same things, then they would sure provide hamster wheels for people to never usefully escape.

01:09:02.022 --> 01:09:02.783
This is one of them.

01:09:03.343 --> 01:09:07.226
This guy, more than a lot of people, should be able to go, wait a minute,

01:09:08.237 --> 01:09:16.360
Did Kevin McKernan say that the RNA sample that was submitted by these companies was actually a smear?

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:25.805
You mean like a smear from the pure intended RNA all the way down to all the fragments down to like 10 bases?

01:09:26.585 --> 01:09:27.505
Yes, that's correct.

01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:28.426
It was a smear.

01:09:29.352 --> 01:09:41.652
And so at the end of that smear are a whole bunch of random, what you might call small regulatory RNAs that will also be present in the shock, also transported by the lipid nanoparticle, also packaged.

01:09:43.396 --> 01:09:51.922
And so sure, maybe you'll get lucky and you'll express some spike protein and it'll be fine and you'll make some antibodies and everything will be happily ever after.

01:09:51.962 --> 01:10:00.128
But what about all those little tiny RNAs that apparently are part of the central dogma that this guy found and lots of people were finding already back in the nineties.

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:01.849
We should just forget about those.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.872
Yeah, we should.

01:10:07.273 --> 01:10:10.676
And to make sure that you forget about them, this guy was given a Nobel prize.

01:10:20.046 --> 01:10:30.409
the central dogma of molecular biology, where DNA makes RNA that makes proteins, and small RNAs have modified that over the last 20 years.

01:10:31.029 --> 01:10:35.610
The first example of modification was the microRNAs that I'll go into in great detail today.

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.611
And they are thought to be made from very small transcripts,

01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:48.788
22 nucleotides long that then regulate the translation of target mRNAs to then cause less protein products.

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:50.809
So it's another layer of regulation.

01:10:51.809 --> 01:11:06.495
But in addition to microRNAs, there's also many other tiny RNAs that are made inside of cells that probably regulate the production of RNA from genes and also add a regulatory locus.

01:11:08.095 --> 01:11:11.978
So RNAs are regulated by micro RNAs.

01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:14.661
And I think how that works is that they bind to them.

01:11:14.681 --> 01:11:18.664
And when they bind to them, they become double-stranded RNA and that gets instantly degraded.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:27.232
And then now he's also talking about other regulatory RNAs that influence the way the DNA is translated to RNA.

01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:28.353
And he says, probably.

01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:33.798
So you can already see

01:11:36.021 --> 01:12:05.836
that they have no idea what they're doing when they inject an RNA into a healthy person inside of a lipid nanoparticle, even if they could off the shelf pull a absolutely 100% pure RNA of this sequence that they purported to use with the exact chemical composition that they wanted it to be, and then put it in the lipid nanoparticle exactly as the way that they wanted to, it would still not be an appropriate therapeutic for a healthy human.

01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:12.424
But here we are talking about things that are hypothetically impossible.

01:12:12.984 --> 01:12:14.905
You can't get that pure RNA.

01:12:14.925 --> 01:12:16.846
There's always going to be contamination.

01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:27.072
And there's going to be not only contamination of RNA, but DNA and endotoxins and everything that come from being able to not being able to purify the commercially

01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:41.651
manufactured using recombinant DNA methods, you're not going to be able to purify that into anything that would resemble the cartoon that we just described where you pull the pure RNA off the shelf and you carefully package it in the lipid nanoparticle.

01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:43.173
They can't do that.

01:12:44.810 --> 01:13:10.868
And so this is a very big problem and they needed to make sure that anybody understood how incredibly complex this problem is or potentially is, how little we actually know about it, would need to be firmly in their pocket with a very prestigious appointment and a very, very unassailable CV.

01:13:12.219 --> 01:13:14.080
That's what you see being built here.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:19.062
That's what was built with Stanley Prusiner being promoted by Hillary Kaprowski.

01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:20.842
That's what you see here.

01:13:21.703 --> 01:13:23.103
And that's how we got here.

01:13:24.344 --> 01:13:39.430
That's why Peter Daszak was in place on 60 Minutes years before the pandemic, because this was a ongoing full court press to make sure that when they finally decided to close the main doors of the trap that everybody would be in.

01:13:40.911 --> 01:13:41.771
And we still are.

01:13:43.985 --> 01:13:46.527
Only some of our ideas are outside of this trap.

01:13:46.567 --> 01:13:50.091
The rest of them are still inside because the trap is all-encompassing.

01:13:53.073 --> 01:13:53.894
It's not small.

01:13:54.715 --> 01:14:03.643
It's designed to contain all of us in what Teilhard de Chardin called the no-sphere.

01:14:05.489 --> 01:14:15.036
This is one collective idea about our biology, and it's a very bad mythology, but it is a giant trap for our children.

01:14:17.358 --> 01:14:21.761
So that generations of children will never actually understand their biology.

01:14:21.822 --> 01:14:29.247
They'll never understand how sacred a child is, a baby is, and how perfect every person is.

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.896
with their imperfections.

01:14:36.677 --> 01:14:37.537
That's the whole point.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.321
And those were discovered at about the same time, and I'll talk about that too.

01:14:46.602 --> 01:14:49.563
So the star of the show is C. elegans, the nematode.

01:14:50.164 --> 01:14:53.666
And this is the animal that is not as big as my arm.

01:14:53.726 --> 01:14:54.766
It's a millimeter long.

01:14:55.567 --> 01:15:01.490
And it has been a subject of thousands of researchers worldwide.

01:15:02.619 --> 01:15:03.299
who work on it.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:11.404
It started as a field by Sidney Brenner in the early 60s as the most simple, complicated animal to work on.

01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:24.470
The worm is an animal and it's phylogenetically related to us up here, but pretty distant and much simplified as an animal.

01:15:26.528 --> 01:15:32.131
So simple that instead of having billions of cells, it has 959 cells as a full grown adult.

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:42.756
So, you know, the, the interesting thing about this is, is that why aren't there, you know, how come they haven't remodeled this thing then they, they know exactly how many cells there are.

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:46.278
And they know exactly when they, they divide into those cells.

01:15:46.318 --> 01:15:49.240
They know exactly how many cells compose the whole animal.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.481
They have the whole genome of it.

01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:58.266
But they haven't figured out how to rearrange anything in the worm.

01:15:59.507 --> 01:16:03.629
They haven't managed to have it have two heads or anything like that.

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:06.931
Rearrange stuff.

01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:11.194
So they have the protein catalog.

01:16:12.173 --> 01:16:13.553
And then they think they're done.

01:16:13.753 --> 01:16:20.635
Even though we can go all the way back to someone like Erwin Schrodinger that we're covering in Biology 101.

01:16:20.915 --> 01:16:25.916
And we can find in chapter, on page 21, we can find a quote.

01:16:28.997 --> 01:16:32.037
And it is, maybe it's not 21, maybe it's 22.

01:16:36.298 --> 01:16:39.959
But in term, see, this is what we're dealing with here.

01:16:41.949 --> 01:16:45.432
But the term code script is, of course, too narrow.

01:16:45.472 --> 01:16:50.896
The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow.

01:16:50.956 --> 01:17:04.806
The chromosomes are not just a recipe for proteins, but somehow or another, the plan of how those proteins sing together across time is apparently encoded there.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.342
That is what Erwin Schrodinger realizes has to be the truth.

01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:22.686
If the chromosomes carry the information of life, as the physicists and chemists have assumed since the Manhattan Project and onward,

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:34.174
then the only way that's possible is if they are code law and executive power, or to use another simile, they are the architect's plan and the builder's craft in one.

01:17:34.595 --> 01:17:37.117
We have not cracked this code, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:38.938 --> 01:17:47.184
We may find generations from now that some more is added to our understanding and we see multiple layers of it or something like that.

01:17:47.224 --> 01:17:48.845
It's also possible that we never will.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:50.647
But right now,

01:17:52.978 --> 01:18:00.644
There is an entire academia of biology that assumes that we have already cracked this, we've already bridged this gap.

01:18:01.664 --> 01:18:03.245
And that's the danger that we're in.

01:18:03.265 --> 01:18:09.530
Whoops, what the?

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.761
This is the lineage of the animal.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:21.302
It was worked out by John Sulston in the early 70s.

01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:25.204
This is showing the pattern of divisions that take place in the embryo.

01:18:25.644 --> 01:18:28.605
These are the divisions that take place during larval stage one.

01:18:29.145 --> 01:18:30.886
This is not Brett Weinstein's brother.

01:18:30.946 --> 01:18:32.847
Sorry, I just made the joke.

01:18:33.027 --> 01:18:34.888
Stage four and out pops an adult.

01:18:35.728 --> 01:18:38.489
And it produces progeny every three days.

01:18:38.529 --> 01:18:42.911
So it's a very fast genetic system that attracted a lot of talent.

01:18:44.029 --> 01:18:48.192
And the field of C. elegans has always been very influential to me in particular.

01:18:48.212 --> 01:18:54.256
It's just populated with really wonderful people who work on many different biological problems.

01:18:55.136 --> 01:19:03.141
And I've always felt blessed to have been surrounded by people who work on so many different aspects of the biology of this animal.

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:07.804
It's a way to learn everything about biology in a microcosm on one organism.

01:19:09.305 --> 01:19:10.246
There's the mistake.

01:19:11.334 --> 01:19:13.814
There's the mistake in a nutshell, right?

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:16.975
Let's listen to that again, because he says it better than I could ever say it.

01:19:17.075 --> 01:19:19.916
And we should just listen to him and let him say it, because it's perfect.

01:19:20.776 --> 01:19:24.917
It's a way to learn everything about biology in a microcosm on one organism.

01:19:27.437 --> 01:19:29.577
This is the trap that we are in right now.

01:19:29.757 --> 01:19:34.838
This is a way to learn everything about biology in a microcosm in an organism.

01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:37.939
This is absolutely positively

01:19:42.259 --> 01:19:46.782
I have no responsibility for the... Something's breaking down there.

01:19:47.163 --> 01:19:48.604
We had a little computer problem.

01:19:48.704 --> 01:19:49.344
Sorry about that.

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:51.946
But it's absolutely wrong.

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:56.830
And that is, I assure you, the exact same problem

01:19:57.642 --> 01:19:59.483
with this book right here, okay?

01:20:00.023 --> 01:20:04.504
This book is way too frickin' big for how simple the principle is.

01:20:04.744 --> 01:20:15.468
If there are proteins that, if they are folded wrong, can cause other proteins to fold wrong, and this can just cascade out of control, then you don't need a book this big to explain it.

01:20:15.608 --> 01:20:18.909
And most of the data shouldn't be from yeast, but it is.

01:20:20.109 --> 01:20:21.410
It's almost all from yeast.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.121
And that's the problem here.

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:40.509
These people have allowed, they have actively bamboozled us into believing that what we can learn from yeast directly applies to us and implies that we are nothing but determinist chemical reactions.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:42.971
It's nothing more to us.

01:20:44.171 --> 01:20:50.495
C. elegans is exactly the same as us, we just have more cells and trick us into believing that we are special.

01:20:51.428 --> 01:20:53.857
And that's exactly what Sam Harris would tell you too.

01:20:58.308 --> 01:21:02.252
This is the trap, ladies and gentlemen, and he's absolutely inside of it.

01:21:02.392 --> 01:21:15.984
And all of these academic biologists that believe that their knockout mouse or their inbred mice experiments have real interesting implications in understanding our own systems.

01:21:16.124 --> 01:21:23.011
And this is such a terribly malevolent trap because every once in a while, it is true.

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:33.192
For certain pure genetic things, for certain pure genetic examples, for certain really obvious things, yes, it's true.

01:21:34.813 --> 01:21:39.595
But it doesn't help us understand ourselves.

01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:48.194
as a species, as a phenomenon, as an individual, and how we fit into that.

01:21:48.255 --> 01:21:49.515
It doesn't help us at all.

01:21:50.396 --> 01:21:55.498
In fact, it takes us farther and farther away from understanding that in a meaningful way.

01:21:57.639 --> 01:22:10.146
And in fact, I believe it really does, in a malevolent way, misuse what could otherwise be a very, very high potential

01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:21.857
for humanity to evolve in a direction as a species that would be good for everyone involved, all the generations to come.

01:22:24.179 --> 01:22:36.609
And that's the very scary thing for me right now, is that I do think that it's kind of like a moment like that, where we could go one way into a green paradise, and we could go another way into an absolute hellscape.

01:22:38.706 --> 01:23:01.795
And it is a question of whether every individual adult human is willing to carry the water for the next generation and protect them from this attack that's gonna continue for probably a decade to come before whatever else in the script is gonna happen.

01:23:03.275 --> 01:23:07.077
And we need our children in the next couple years to

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:11.191
be fully aware of the stage.

01:23:13.373 --> 01:23:26.484
So that despite the performances and despite the coordinated lives, they're able to communicate with one another and form communities and maintain them and move forward in a different direction.

01:23:27.881 --> 01:23:38.563
And that is only possible if we can show kids this fundamental illusion, what he just said, that is absolutely positively not true.

01:23:38.623 --> 01:23:47.205
We cannot learn very much or anything about ourselves by studying these worms in this way.

01:23:47.285 --> 01:23:52.866
We cannot, because what it does is that it entices us to believe

01:23:54.901 --> 01:23:59.043
That there is a description like this that fits us.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:04.847
That there is a description like this that fits our dog.

01:24:06.768 --> 01:24:14.592
That we just don't see our children in the right light, and otherwise you could learn a lot about your kids from Sea Elegance.

01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:17.029
This is an illusion.

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:25.437
It's a terrible, malevolent illusion that I was under and lots and lots of people are still under and we must free them from it.

01:24:26.018 --> 01:24:26.898
It's an illusion.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:36.508
On so many different aspects of the biology of this animal, it's a way to learn everything about biology in a microcosm on one organism.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:41.788
And the real malevolence of this, sorry, I gotta go back, because I didn't mean to advance like that.

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:52.755
The real malevolence of this is that they are using people like him, rewarding people like him, because they need children to think like this.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:25:01.761
They need children and they need universities to teach this at the fundamental level, even to high school kids.

01:25:03.883 --> 01:25:05.604
That the science that this guy does

01:25:08.214 --> 01:25:36.325
Edifies the idea that genes are determinant That we can be described by a combination of physical and chemical laws that we just don't understand how yet and this is a an absolute malevolent lie about the irreducible complexity that should be biology biology should be a source of continuous reverence and and and in a pursuit of an accurate description of the sacred and

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:46.352
And instead, it has been twisted around to really, in my humble opinion, represent the opinion that God is hands off.

01:25:49.011 --> 01:26:09.914
that because evolution is true, the phenomenon of man, that's what I think is happening here, that's how I would characterize it off the cuff, really, is that the phenomenon of man is an admission that this guy, Teilhard de Chardin, and these people are looking to teach our children that God is hands-off.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:17.007
that the creation that God did is a process that he put in motion and it is spinning into the future.

01:26:17.687 --> 01:26:24.531
And now that we understand that, it's okay for us to influence that process.

01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:26.272
It's okay to take control of it.

01:26:26.612 --> 01:26:28.713
It's okay for a bunch of smart people

01:26:30.134 --> 01:26:36.298
the wisest of us, to take control of that species-level evolution.

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:41.822
It's okay for us to do that because God made it that way.

01:26:43.383 --> 01:26:56.993
That's exactly what these books combine to teach people like Peter Hotez and Jeffrey Sachs, and probably a lot of these other people that are following this general tact.

01:26:58.737 --> 01:27:05.383
is that evolution is a process guided by God, maybe set in motion by God.

01:27:05.503 --> 01:27:10.126
And therefore, now that we understand that, it's okay for us.

01:27:10.587 --> 01:27:20.255
It is the next evolution in our divine existence for us to take control of what is otherwise a process that God put in motion.

01:27:21.496 --> 01:27:25.240
but is not actively engaged in or doesn't require respect.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.443
Now that we understand how it works, God is hands off.

01:27:28.783 --> 01:27:30.164
He gave us the knobs.

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:31.506
We're not going to turn them.

01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.210
That's the argument that they make.

01:27:38.733 --> 01:27:41.035
That's the argument that all of these people are making.

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:49.292
And I would argue that's the enticing argument that makes these people think that what they're doing is not malevolent.

01:27:49.412 --> 01:27:52.574
What they're doing is what we have all been destined to do.

01:27:52.654 --> 01:27:55.595
And we just happen to be born in the time when it's going to happen.

01:27:57.636 --> 01:28:04.238
And it's very easy if you have a lot of money and power to have parties and discussions that get exactly here.

01:28:05.278 --> 01:28:08.620
And it's been happening for decades, for generations.

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:09.440
You see?

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.081
At least two generations.

01:28:17.563 --> 01:28:18.623
I hope I'm making sense.

01:28:18.683 --> 01:28:20.064
If I'm not making sense, you know.

01:28:34.882 --> 01:28:35.783
keeps reiterating.

01:28:36.184 --> 01:28:37.825
So this animal is retarded.

01:28:37.866 --> 01:28:40.428
It never really gets to the adult stage.

01:28:40.468 --> 01:28:45.274
It always has patterns of division as if it's a larval animal.

01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:54.644
And what really sort of launched this project to be really important to me... You're retarded!

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:55.765
Sorry, I didn't see that.

01:28:55.845 --> 01:28:56.205
That's fine.

01:28:57.373 --> 01:29:01.154
when he was a postdoc in Bob Horvitz's lab in the early 80s.

01:29:01.774 --> 01:29:19.879
See, so if you find a gene that you can knock out and then some weird aberrant developmental process happens, I think what's really quite comical to me at this point is what this guy doesn't realize is that what that really means is that messing with development

01:29:22.864 --> 01:29:24.045
the development of a human.

01:29:24.065 --> 01:29:29.090
I'm not talking about the development of a worm with 954 cells.

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:32.172
I'm talking about messing with the development of a human.

01:29:32.693 --> 01:29:48.027
If you have evidence this compelling, the development is a waterfall cascading process that when it goes in the wrong direction, it can go very spirally wrong.

01:29:49.790 --> 01:30:01.093
How is it possible that this guy doesn't understand if his model organism allows him to study any question in biology in a microcosm in an organism?

01:30:02.393 --> 01:30:06.594
Then how the hell does he not know?

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:08.995
How does he not know?

01:30:11.257 --> 01:30:20.343
that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances during the development of a young human embryo would be ridiculous.

01:30:26.787 --> 01:30:38.275
How is it possible that a Harvard scientist with this CV is not from the rooftops screaming about the RNA impurity smear

01:30:39.653 --> 01:30:43.776
that Kevin McKernan told us about on our own podcast in 2022.

01:30:48.219 --> 01:30:51.201
I mean, this is really how bad it is, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:53.843 --> 01:30:56.625
People with the requisite discoveries.

01:30:58.367 --> 01:30:59.848
He discovered this stuff.

01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:07.013
He's not speaking about the, the, the, the RNA being impure at all.

01:31:07.637 --> 01:31:15.764
He's not worried about it at all, even though there could be potentially tens of thousands of interfering RNAs in every lipid nanoparticle.

01:31:16.965 --> 01:31:17.886
Every particle.

01:31:25.173 --> 01:31:27.655
And discover the gene LIN14 could suppress

01:31:28.237 --> 01:31:46.270
mutations in Lin-4, so it could take this complicated set of divisions that are temporally aberrant, and instead of doing L1, L1, L1, it would go straight to L2, and therefore have a pattern of divisions that's distinct in time.

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:57.718
And this allowed him to infer that Lin-4 was a negative regulator of the gene Lin-14 to set up this... how developmental timing works.

01:31:59.581 --> 01:32:04.484
And so the genes regulate other genes, but we don't really know all the things we know.

01:32:04.504 --> 01:32:07.306
It's just that it doesn't become a worm if we mess with them.

01:32:09.628 --> 01:32:15.932
And so here again, we have evidence that the genes are coding much more than just a protein.

01:32:16.472 --> 01:32:19.034
Yet when it's convenient, genes are proteins.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.736
And when it's not convenient, genes are

01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:26.010
are actually micro RNAs that regulate other genes.

01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:32.373
So we have genes that regulate other genes, but only when it's appropriate or only when it's useful to discuss it that way.

01:32:32.533 --> 01:32:36.655
Otherwise here in this case, we don't, we don't care about what these proteins do.

01:32:36.715 --> 01:32:39.336
We don't have it to have any mechanism by which they work.

01:32:39.797 --> 01:32:42.438
We just know that when we mess with one, we don't get the other.

01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:44.399
When we mess with the other, we don't get the same.

01:32:44.839 --> 01:32:48.901
It's just these, these relationships that then get,

01:32:50.049 --> 01:33:04.594
distorted almost instantaneously by p-values and null hypothesis testing, they almost get instantaneously transformed into a high-fidelity understanding about what lin-14 and lin-28 do together.

01:33:06.575 --> 01:33:09.056
I have no responsibility for the code.

01:33:10.656 --> 01:33:12.297
I don't know why it keeps running like that.

01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:15.458
I gotta figure out what's going on here with this stupid thing.

01:33:17.295 --> 01:33:19.497
It's like not pausing on cue.

01:33:20.218 --> 01:33:21.359
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.702
Let me just test it one more time and see if it works.

01:33:27.745 --> 01:33:28.986
No, it's not working.

01:33:29.206 --> 01:33:29.667
I don't know why.

01:33:30.781 --> 01:33:32.062
Um, it doesn't matter.

01:33:32.082 --> 01:33:33.663
I don't need those sound effects.

01:33:33.684 --> 01:33:35.545
This is really just, it's insane.

01:33:36.225 --> 01:33:37.727
To me, this keeps going on.

01:33:37.767 --> 01:33:50.736
You're going to see that what he found in these worms and then implying that we have some really rudiment, not rudimentary, but fundamental understanding of ourselves from this and, and awarding him prizes for it.

01:33:50.817 --> 01:33:53.779
All it really does is make sure that he will shut the hell up.

01:33:54.873 --> 01:34:00.997
about the potential implications for an impure RNA or for transfection in general in human beings.

01:34:01.077 --> 01:34:01.518
That's it.

01:34:02.278 --> 01:34:16.028
It's the only reason to give this guy an award in 2015 to make sure he's right where they need him to be when they decide to start rolling out these mRNAs and then to give him a Nobel Prize for a computer program?

01:34:16.108 --> 01:34:16.969
Are you serious?

01:34:19.855 --> 01:34:21.416
It's a big game, ladies and gentlemen.

01:34:21.456 --> 01:34:23.698
It's an absolutely malevolent game.

01:34:23.719 --> 01:34:24.459
Do you know why?

01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:25.260
Listen to this.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:32.707
Hi, everyone.

01:34:33.587 --> 01:34:38.272
Welcome to this talk, Screening All DNA Synthesis and Reliably Detecting Stealth Pandemics.

01:34:39.844 --> 01:34:47.348
Kevin Esvelt is an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab where he leads the Sculpting Evolution Group in Advancing Biotechnology Safely.

01:34:47.708 --> 01:35:00.116
In 2013, he invented CRISPR-based gene drive, kept it to himself until confident the technology favored defense, and then revealed his findings and called for an open discussion and safeguards before building the first CRISPR-based gene.

01:35:01.076 --> 01:35:15.334
gene drive system so do you see what she's who she's talking about kevin esvelt is going to present at an effective altruism global conference this is recent the gene drive guy

01:35:22.927 --> 01:35:30.989
In this talk, Kevin will outline two distinct scenarios, wildlife and stealth, by which pandemic-causing pathogens could cause societal collapse.

01:35:31.609 --> 01:35:40.010
He will then explain the Delay, Detect, Defend plan to prevent such pandemics, including the key technological programs his team oversees to mitigate pandemic risks.

01:35:40.591 --> 01:35:48.512
As a reminder, if you have questions for Kevin, you can submit them via the Swapcard app, and during the Q&A portion, I will select a mixture of prepared and audience questions.

01:35:48.612 --> 01:35:53.194
She is a bioethics fellow at the National Institutes of Health.

01:35:53.254 --> 01:35:54.215
Are you kidding me?

01:35:57.356 --> 01:35:59.317
And she's introducing Kevin Esvelt.

01:35:59.377 --> 01:36:00.517
I wonder where he works.

01:36:00.778 --> 01:36:01.698
Who does he work for?

01:36:01.738 --> 01:36:03.319
Let's see what they put on the slide.

01:36:03.819 --> 01:36:04.259
To ask.

01:36:04.699 --> 01:36:04.980
Thanks.

01:36:13.523 --> 01:36:13.844
All right.

01:36:13.904 --> 01:36:14.564
Good day, everyone.

01:36:15.954 --> 01:36:24.898
I was asked to give an uplifting talk about technical progress on mitigating biorisks so as to fill all of your hearts with hope for the future.

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:29.300
This has not traditionally been my strength.

01:36:30.865 --> 01:36:31.826
but perhaps I will try.

01:36:32.646 --> 01:36:34.147
So the other thing I wanted to.

01:36:34.568 --> 01:36:43.994
So he's from, he's an associate professor at the MIT media lab, but he's making jokes about not being able to give uplifting talks and people in the audience are laughing about it.

01:36:44.074 --> 01:36:44.955
Great start.

01:36:45.315 --> 01:36:53.901
To get out there at the beginning is just, I realized that I hadn't really explained what we're thinking here in this space.

01:36:55.808 --> 01:36:56.969
And so what does it say here?

01:36:57.029 --> 01:37:13.437
Kevin Esfelt, Associate Professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Secure Bio Incorporated, Secure DNA Foundation, and a Polymath Fellow for the Geneva Center for Security Policy.

01:37:21.761 --> 01:37:32.965
So keep in mind that this guy, along with Richard Ebright, testified in front of the House of Representatives almost, or maybe it was the Senate, I don't even know anymore.

01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:45.869
At least three years ago already, the gain-of-function research was the most dangerous thing in the world and it really needed regulation, even though this guy already is the guy who invented gene drives and knows that gene drives are much more dangerous and very easy to make.

01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:49.165
and could even be deployed in humans.

01:37:49.625 --> 01:37:53.428
And humans wouldn't even know that they had been gene-drived because it wouldn't be in them.

01:37:53.468 --> 01:37:54.609
It would be in their gametes.

01:37:55.090 --> 01:38:03.257
And then when they made kids, their kids would be gene-drived and they wouldn't even know because no one would be looking for it, even though he says it's easy to find, but who's going to look for it.

01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:14.226
It would be a generational modification perfectly done by intramuscular injection of a lipid nanoparticle carrying an RNA.

01:38:17.585 --> 01:38:19.006
I'm not saying they're doing it.

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.028
I'm not saying they wouldn't do it either.

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:26.232
I'm saying that this guy does not work for America.

01:38:28.874 --> 01:38:45.608
I'm saying that this guy has been part of this for a very, very long time and understood that we are being managed and governed more akin to a plantation population, a farm population, or an experimental population.

01:38:48.015 --> 01:38:51.878
And I believe that this guy is very keenly aware of that, and totally fine with it.

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:59.523
He's one of these very, very atheist, you know, it's just the way it is.

01:39:00.183 --> 01:39:04.126
We're just physics and chemistry, so there's no morality.

01:39:05.467 --> 01:39:07.028
Might as well be on the winning team.

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:10.510
That's where we are.

01:39:11.931 --> 01:39:14.513
Otherwise, this would not exist, and it wouldn't be from 2023.

01:39:18.925 --> 01:39:25.747
I needed to change the title of the talk because so much of the risk these days has to do with AI as well.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:37.250
And in a lot- AI bioconvergence screening global DNA synthesis and reliably detecting stealth pandemics.

01:39:39.851 --> 01:39:42.372
This is like the smart guys, Peter Daszak.

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:46.373
This is the mathematicians, Peter Daszak.

01:39:47.628 --> 01:39:51.730
The molecular biologist Peter Daszak.

01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:55.332
This is not the 60 Minutes Peter Daszak.

01:39:55.392 --> 01:40:01.715
It's not the, you know, UN Peter Daszak.

01:40:08.538 --> 01:40:11.020
And nobody talks about Kevin Esvelt but me.

01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.921
Nobody, not one person.

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.662
No one talks about Gene Drives, nothing.

01:40:19.548 --> 01:40:20.709
But it's a bio weapon.

01:40:20.949 --> 01:40:21.969
It's a bio weapon.

01:40:21.989 --> 01:40:25.891
A lot of ways, unless we deal with AI, we're not going to be able to deal with bio.

01:40:26.451 --> 01:40:33.555
And what's more, those of us in the biospace, if we can influence AI in a positive direction, that's potentially much more impact than we could get otherwise.

01:40:33.575 --> 01:40:35.196
So I'm going to tell a little bit of a story.

01:40:35.256 --> 01:40:40.118
So if we can influence AI in a positive direction is 100% PSYOP.

01:40:41.419 --> 01:40:42.279
Part of the script.

01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:47.462
This guy is a very effective weapon.

01:40:48.646 --> 01:40:49.567
That's what you see here.

01:40:50.528 --> 01:40:55.054
I don't know if he knows it or he's just going along because, you know, in the military, that's what you do.

01:40:55.094 --> 01:40:56.216
You just don't need to know.

01:40:56.937 --> 01:41:00.361
If this is what you need me to do and you're going to pay me this much, I'm happy to do it.

01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:04.066
If you tell me that this is patriotic, well, then I'll do it even harder.

01:41:05.388 --> 01:41:06.189
That's how this works.

01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:09.691
That's how some of these people got involved.

01:41:09.751 --> 01:41:13.114
I'm afraid that that's how, for example, Peter McCullough got in.

01:41:13.554 --> 01:41:17.497
At first, he really believed that there was a lab leak and that it might be being covered up.

01:41:17.557 --> 01:41:21.100
And so he was recruited as somebody that we really need somebody with a level head.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.224
And then at some point he realized that, wait, I think I got into more, bit off more than I want to chew.

01:41:29.486 --> 01:41:32.027
Other people are still just happily going along.

01:41:32.188 --> 01:41:36.711
Peter McCullough is one of the only people who seems like he's kind of pissed that he got sucked into this.

01:41:40.885 --> 01:41:42.868
This guy's not mad that he's got sucked into it.

01:41:42.908 --> 01:41:44.631
He loves his job, this guy does.

01:41:45.753 --> 01:41:49.419
We have our sprint over the last two weeks where we've been trying to do that as well.

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:53.847
But first, what is our threat model for BIO?

01:41:55.854 --> 01:41:58.856
Now, we don't want to talk about specifics, of course, because those are info hazards.

01:41:59.116 --> 01:42:02.159
But in terms of where the threat is going to come from, what goes wrong?

01:42:02.259 --> 01:42:07.102
Obviously, we can say there's a non-state actor pool, and then there's the state actor pool.

01:42:07.723 --> 01:42:12.686
But even among the non-state actors, you have wealthy, well-resourced non-state actors, and then you have

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:29.897
So his primary goal is to maintain this consensus, this illusion of consensus that there is a biosecurity threat, we need to model it, we don't want to talk about the specifics of it because talking about the specifics of it would teach people the threats that we're trying to avoid.

01:42:30.737 --> 01:42:32.758
We don't want to give away this big information.

01:42:32.798 --> 01:42:34.560
That's his claim to fame.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.081
That's his main shtick, right?

01:42:36.121 --> 01:42:41.584
That I knew that what I was inventing was so dangerous that I asked George Church about it first.

01:42:41.624 --> 01:42:43.766
And when he said it was safe, then I published.

01:42:45.227 --> 01:42:54.593
And so there's this, they each have this little shtick about what they're doing to be ethical and why you should listen to them and what they sacrificed or whatever.

01:42:54.633 --> 01:42:56.134
But this guy, nah.

01:42:57.537 --> 01:43:02.462
This guy's just a military dude talking to other people that are bamboozled by him.

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:04.404
They trust him.

01:43:07.867 --> 01:43:14.253
It's incredible where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen, because we are breaking this one day at a time, and it's breaking very rapidly.

01:43:14.633 --> 01:43:19.117
Individual nihilist lone wolves who, for a variety of reasons, might want to burn it all down.

01:43:19.958 --> 01:43:21.659
Individualist nihilist lone wolves.

01:43:21.679 --> 01:43:24.119
How much of the threat do we think comes from each of these?

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.501
And how on earth are those nihilist lone wolves going to actually access nasty things?

01:43:30.061 --> 01:43:32.082
This is what people always seem to wonder.

01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:36.243
And it's an excellent question because these are not people, for the most part, who can do research, right?

01:43:36.263 --> 01:43:44.186
If you can perform a reverse genetics protocol to make an influenza virus, that does not at all mean that you can do research.

01:43:45.842 --> 01:43:50.207
So even that right there was part of the illusion, right?

01:43:50.247 --> 01:44:02.763
He did not say, if you can order an infectious clone and assemble it in your laboratory, he said, if you can perform the manufacture of a flu virus.

01:44:05.492 --> 01:44:15.026
And so everybody in the audience that's just sophisticated enough to have absorbed some of the narrative, it's going to fit perfect.

01:44:15.086 --> 01:44:17.229
It's going to go like gears locking.

01:44:19.397 --> 01:44:35.891
But if you understand that virology, especially RNA virology, is an elaborate illusion that's created by commercially produced synthetic DNA and RNA applied to these experimental models, then what he said now is just absolutely malevolent.

01:44:35.991 --> 01:44:38.053
It's not at all imparting knowledge.

01:44:38.593 --> 01:44:41.956
People are actually dumber for having heard what he just said.

01:44:45.418 --> 01:44:46.238
It's nasty things.

01:44:46.798 --> 01:44:48.819
This is what people always seem to wonder.

01:44:48.899 --> 01:44:52.981
And it's an excellent question, because these are not people, for the most part, who can do research, right?

01:44:53.001 --> 01:45:00.943
If you can perform a reverse genetics protocol to make an influenza virus, that does not at all mean that you can do research.

01:45:01.444 --> 01:45:04.745
That means you are qualified to be a technician in one of these laboratories.

01:45:04.805 --> 01:45:09.366
That is not the same as doing novel research, which, by the way, in bio, usually fails.

01:45:09.787 --> 01:45:13.808
This is why, despite our best efforts, we are still slowly withering away and dying.

01:45:15.498 --> 01:45:24.261
Now, I wrote this delay, detect, defend roadmap to just sort of give a concrete view of what we can do to solve the problem.

01:45:24.981 --> 01:45:26.801
And basically we are vulnerable.

01:45:26.901 --> 01:45:31.183
So here he is admitting that he works for the Geneva Center for Security Policy.

01:45:31.983 --> 01:45:33.703
So he cooperates with foreigners.

01:45:34.524 --> 01:45:36.544
He's not an American patriot.

01:45:37.024 --> 01:45:39.085
He's giving a talk at a

01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:43.933
effective altruism conference or whatever it's hell was called.

01:45:44.153 --> 01:45:45.694
It is, this is awful.

01:45:46.375 --> 01:45:49.297
This video is readily available on YouTube.

01:45:49.337 --> 01:45:50.478
You can find it yourself.

01:45:51.098 --> 01:46:03.808
I don't want to waste too much more of your time with it, but I assure you what he's going to talk about is screening all kinds of things, sequencing all kinds of things, collecting all the data, collecting all the data.

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:16.067
Ladies and gentlemen, if you haven't seen it, please look at the Dear Senator Ron Johnson stream that I did a couple of days ago.

01:46:16.107 --> 01:46:22.152
I think it's really one of those things that it's good enough to share with people that don't know who I am.

01:46:22.212 --> 01:46:29.038
It's good enough because I tried to stay reasonable and tried to stay calm.

01:46:29.959 --> 01:46:34.262
I think it would be really nice if people really started to push

01:46:35.382 --> 01:46:46.685
Um, some of these ideas a little bit better, you know, pushing the idea that we can describe the murder and lies in America that was misconstrued as the start of something terrible.

01:46:47.365 --> 01:46:51.806
And we can, we can, we can characterize it very succinctly.

01:46:51.846 --> 01:47:00.708
We can also characterize and explain very well how on an academic bench PCR is great, but how it was used malevolently for the pandemic.

01:47:01.462 --> 01:47:08.672
We can also explain how these investigational vaccines were products before the pandemic.

01:47:08.712 --> 01:47:12.076
We can also explain how even in its purest form, this wouldn't have worked.

01:47:12.116 --> 01:47:13.418
That's what we talked about today.

01:47:13.979 --> 01:47:18.545
And we can explain why some of these people who should have done known better are getting Nobel prizes.

01:47:20.046 --> 01:47:21.947
and not for micro RNA.

01:47:22.907 --> 01:47:41.090
Define the term infectious clone as transfection and transformation in cell culture would have been the obvious way for the no virus people to win already a couple years ago when I gave them that information freely and tried to bring them and CHD together and instead they made that blow up in my face.

01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:45.711
So I know for sure that nobody's ever gonna say RNA cannot pandemic because

01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:50.132
Again, that would be something that would bring the whole narrative down to its knees.

01:47:51.353 --> 01:47:53.374
Thank you very much again for being here.

01:47:53.434 --> 01:47:58.435
Don't forget that endemicity is impossible to tell from a background because we have no data.

01:47:59.736 --> 01:48:13.461
We also need to be very succinct when we talk about the fact that these people are playing a game by not talking about 2020 and not looking back to the fact that the vaccine schedule in America was always criminally negligent before the pandemic.

01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:20.418
The transfection was a product before the pandemic and therefore criminal to roll out as an investigational vaccine.

01:48:20.987 --> 01:48:24.989
And that RNA cannot pandemic and we don't have any biology to support that idea.

01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:27.970
That's why everybody got so excited about DNA.

01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:30.632
All the things that RNA doesn't have.

01:48:31.692 --> 01:48:38.455
If you liked what you saw or liked what you heard, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

01:48:38.495 --> 01:48:40.256
We really need help at this point.

01:48:40.296 --> 01:48:48.000
We're going to spend a lot of money on the free live event that's happening on November 3rd.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.241
Not a lot of money, but more money than we have.

01:48:50.981 --> 01:49:03.312
And, uh, we're bringing some people in, um, grandma in for Christmas, which we also really probably are spending money that we don't have on, but we need grandma here for Christmas.

01:49:03.392 --> 01:49:07.495
And so, um, you know, any little donations would be appreciated.

01:49:07.675 --> 01:49:10.658
And if you're going to share, please share stream.gigaom.bio.

01:49:10.698 --> 01:49:19.325
Cause that's what the viewers and I pay for as a way of getting the word out without algorithms, without logins, um, without anybody tracking.

01:49:19.915 --> 01:49:22.758
and without, you know, other things popping up.

01:49:22.838 --> 01:49:26.661
Just Gigaohm, and just Mark, and just Clips.

01:49:27.282 --> 01:49:28.103
Thanks for being here.

01:49:28.303 --> 01:49:30.645
I'll see you again real soon, probably tomorrow.
