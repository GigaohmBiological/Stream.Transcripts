00:00.000 --> 00:12.440
I got two 19 here.

00:12.440 --> 00:19.000
So I made I didn't make the the two 14 deadline that I was trying to get there.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.160
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga on biological.

00:22.160 --> 00:27.160
It's kind of a a spontaneous stream.

00:27.160 --> 00:33.240
I'm able to have a conversation live with a old friend who I haven't.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.560
I haven't been able to get on air in a while.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.600
We haven't had our schedules cross like we would like to have and and there's been a

00:40.600 --> 00:45.640
lot of other stuff going on, of course, as you're aware of in my life and unaware of

00:45.640 --> 00:47.280
everybody's got their own life, right?

00:47.280 --> 00:53.880
So I'm really happy to have the chance to catch up to my friend, the regular guy again.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.040
And so I don't want to give too much of an introduction because we both don't have a

00:59.040 --> 01:00.960
lot of time to share with each other.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.440
So regular guy, how the heck are you?

01:03.440 --> 01:06.600
Good to hear from you again, man.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
Thank you, JC.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.480
It's an honor to be back on your show.

01:10.480 --> 01:15.320
And yeah, it's it feels like it's been far too long.

01:15.320 --> 01:22.840
And I really took the initiative and said, you know, that I wanted to check in and, you

01:22.840 --> 01:30.520
know, give maybe people an update on, you know, what what kind of things people, what

01:30.520 --> 01:35.720
kind of things are happening behind the scenes, what people are saying.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.240
And you know, I feel like I have a lot of good news to deliver in general.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.520
We are definitely we are definitely in need of good news.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.400
I'm going to yeah, I'm going to get rid of the ticking sound.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.240
I was just mocking 60 minutes there.

01:48.240 --> 01:53.400
I had that all rigged up my apologize to everybody's complaining about it in the chat.

01:53.400 --> 02:01.040
Yeah, it's we were really in need of some good news and good news from America is what

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
we really need.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.520
So go ahead, please deliver if you can.

02:06.520 --> 02:11.520
Well, you know, Christmas came and went.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.560
A lot of stuff happened in the news.

02:13.560 --> 02:22.040
And so I've had the opportunity to chat with a lot of friends, associates, parents, and

02:22.040 --> 02:30.280
I've been a little pushy in the sense that I've been pushing your show and your ideas.

02:30.280 --> 02:38.760
And what I find is that, you know, I'm getting no resistance as soon as I explain to people,

02:38.760 --> 02:44.680
you know, what CDNA cloning is, they get it.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.680
I talk about control for at least they get it.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.680
Okay.

02:49.680 --> 03:00.800
I talk about secrets being stolen soul on the black market, they get it.

03:00.800 --> 03:06.960
And then I go on the internet and I see a bunch of people who don't get it and I'm scratching

03:06.960 --> 03:14.400
my head here because some of these people claim to be intelligent, claim to be scientists

03:14.400 --> 03:19.960
of some kind or another mathematician statisticians.

03:19.960 --> 03:24.680
But I don't know what it is.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
They just don't get it.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.920
They're just real slow, big disconnect.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.200
And I worry sometimes that, you know, people will get their news from the internet or seeing

03:35.200 --> 03:42.560
these people and thinking, you know, they reflect the average, the average person on

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
the street.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
And that's not my experience.

03:45.560 --> 03:51.920
Now, the other thing I'll say, you know, people I'm talking to aren't necessarily the average

03:51.920 --> 03:55.840
person on the street.

03:55.840 --> 04:00.400
Just by, you know, virtual luck happens stance, I happen to know a lot of people who work

04:00.400 --> 04:10.440
in the government, military, those kinds of circles, and, you know, they tend to be

04:10.440 --> 04:14.600
on my side.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.920
I see a shift happening.

04:16.920 --> 04:22.600
I see all these people that are willing to listen to reason, there's some sense of morality,

04:22.600 --> 04:25.440
some sense of what's right and wrong.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.320
Having this to, you know, swallow some hard truths.

04:32.320 --> 04:41.120
The other thing I want to say is that I really like your emphasis on teaching kids because

04:41.120 --> 04:43.200
that's where I see the action happening.

04:43.200 --> 04:52.400
And to give an illustration, I know people who want to homeschool their kids.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.720
People who work for the government who want to homeschool their kids, because they don't

04:56.720 --> 05:00.320
like what's going on in schools, and they don't like the way things are being taught.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.000
Now, you wouldn't know that if you were reading the news.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.560
You wouldn't know that if you're on social media, because these people aren't necessarily

05:07.560 --> 05:10.760
free to go on social media and talk.

05:10.760 --> 05:16.960
But that's kind of what made me want to come back on your show and talk to you, because

05:16.960 --> 05:21.120
I don't want people to get too depressed about the state of things.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.680
And, you know, as you say, don't take the bait.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
Wow.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.680
I don't leave it there.

05:27.680 --> 05:33.680
Yeah, I'm really excited because this has been crossing my mind for a while, that while,

05:33.680 --> 05:38.040
for example, they're shaking in front of our face, the idea that future AI is going to

05:38.040 --> 05:45.680
take over the world, they already have the rudimentary algorithms necessary to make it

05:45.680 --> 05:51.240
appear on social media for there to be, as I've said many times on the stream over

05:51.240 --> 05:57.560
and over again, an illusion of consensus that has nothing to do with reality about anything.

05:57.560 --> 06:04.160
And we don't even know how far our own message gets when we look on the best example for

06:04.160 --> 06:06.720
my personal existence is Twitter.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.560
If we look on Twitter, there's no way for us to use that as a metric for what other people

06:11.560 --> 06:18.160
see of our tweets or any other tweets, it's just it's a complete unknown for all of us.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.480
And unless we took the time to sit down next to one another with open accounts and compare

06:23.480 --> 06:27.960
things and then do it across thousands and thousands of accounts, would we ever get a

06:27.960 --> 06:30.560
clue as to how we're actually being manipulated.

06:30.560 --> 06:36.000
And even then we might not be scratching the surface as to how it's used in a compounding

06:36.000 --> 06:41.440
way across, like, social and the whole of social media.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.440
I'm just talking about our own little social circles.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.800
Never mind how they orchestrated on larger levels.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.400
It's to me, I needed to hear that because I never I only have this.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.880
We a lot of us only have this view.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.800
We are, we have been tricked into believing that that's our view.

06:59.800 --> 07:04.480
You're, are you still going into an office or to a work location where you have coworkers

07:04.480 --> 07:07.960
that meet at a water cooler and stuff or what?

07:08.400 --> 07:11.160
Yeah, I am.

07:11.160 --> 07:20.280
But you know, I also work in an office where people don't customarily, you know, bring

07:20.280 --> 07:24.680
their politics to work, bring their personal views to work.

07:24.680 --> 07:30.120
However, I'll also say that that would surprise most people if I told them that, if I told

07:30.120 --> 07:35.880
them why I work, they would think that we're bringing politics to the office and we're not.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.200
I think, you know, where I see the effects, again, is when I interact with people one

07:40.200 --> 07:46.560
on one and really when I just, I do a simple test, do the JC test, I should tell them your

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
theory.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.600
Now, your theory is a shocking theory.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.840
It's hard for people to accept.

07:51.840 --> 07:57.160
I mean, at face value, controlled release.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.400
But you know, you can describe it in, like, 10 seconds, 15 seconds.

08:02.400 --> 08:09.120
You can do it like it's an elevator pitch, okay, you can condense it.

08:09.120 --> 08:15.640
And you know, I got to the point where I was just saying, this isn't political.

08:15.640 --> 08:21.240
This isn't whatever, this is just, you know, what might have happened.

08:21.240 --> 08:26.040
So I just started dropping it on people and seeing what kind of risk of reaction I get

08:26.040 --> 08:30.840
and all I got was positive responses and, you know, it's been months now.

08:30.840 --> 08:36.160
It's been plenty of time for somebody to say, oh, that sounds crazy.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.680
That's not happening.

08:38.680 --> 08:46.680
You know, how far do you get with the aspect of the vast majority of the damage and not

08:46.680 --> 08:49.120
having anything to do with the controlled release?

08:49.120 --> 08:55.360
Do you get that far with them or just the concept of, because if you're starting out

08:55.360 --> 09:00.440
with the molecular biology that I guess you've already sort of got them on the hook with

09:00.440 --> 09:02.680
that RNA can't pandemic.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.160
So controlled release to create the illusion of a pandemic.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.840
Is that what you're trying to get at them with?

09:09.840 --> 09:14.680
Well, your question is a good one because you're asking, you know, what point in the

09:14.680 --> 09:18.400
discussion do we talk about, you know, the broader social effects?

09:18.400 --> 09:23.600
And the answer is really at the beginning because usually that's what prompts the discussion.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Okay.

09:24.680 --> 09:30.160
It's somebody saying, can't believe what they did to our kids.

09:30.160 --> 09:37.600
You know, it's people who are double vaccinated, triple vaccinated that, you know,

09:37.600 --> 09:40.120
now feel like suckers.

09:40.120 --> 09:46.320
That's what that and that's generally, you know, that's that I see that when that conversation

09:46.320 --> 09:52.520
starts, that's usually when I seize the opportunity to, you know, say, yeah, you know,

09:52.560 --> 09:57.000
I think that's what happened and furthermore, and I go from there.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.160
Wow.

09:58.160 --> 10:07.280
And I gauge the reaction that's been my approach now, you know, I encourage others to try the

10:07.280 --> 10:11.720
same thing, you know, it takes a little bit of courage because you're always wondering,

10:11.720 --> 10:16.000
you know, it's my aunt going to think I'm crazy if I say this, you know, people going

10:16.000 --> 10:18.280
to call the police if I say this.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.000
I'm already surprised to hear, I'm already surprised to hear that people feel there are

10:23.000 --> 10:26.360
people who are willing to admit that they kind of feel like they got suckered a little

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
bit.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.040
That's that's extraordinarily hopeful to me.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.200
You know, I think the mask thing had a lot to do with it.

10:35.200 --> 10:42.920
The masks seem to be the jumping off point for a lot of people either because, you know,

10:42.920 --> 10:47.280
it's usually sometimes it's a comment like they notice, you know, they walked into some

10:47.280 --> 10:50.800
place and people were still wearing masks and they can't believe it, you know, something

10:50.800 --> 10:57.400
like that, or it'll be a comment like, you know, so horrible sending my kids to school

10:57.400 --> 10:59.880
with masks and all that kind of stuff.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.080
So a lot of times the masks, you know, that's sort of, if you were to pick like something

11:05.080 --> 11:10.840
that's sort of symbol encapsulates everything that happened, like a symbol, you know, to

11:10.840 --> 11:16.760
represent the pandemic and the effect that it had on people, I think the mask might be

11:16.760 --> 11:22.840
a better symbol than the vaccine because everybody wore a mask and that that continued

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
long after.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.720
And furthermore, if you look at the legal battles closely, which I noticed, no one on

11:28.720 --> 11:34.760
social media really does, to the extent the US government's been putting up a fight over

11:34.760 --> 11:40.560
its emergency authorities and put up its toughest fight over the mask mandates, not the vaccine

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
mandates.

11:41.560 --> 11:47.760
So it's really, I think masks are a good case study, a good jumping off point.

11:47.760 --> 11:51.880
They're also a good illustration of how stupid everyone was because, you know, we can argue

11:51.880 --> 11:57.560
back and forth about immunology this and this and that, but, you know, if you put it, if

11:57.560 --> 12:07.240
you ask somebody, point me to a study shows that masks have any value, you know, they

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
can't do it.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.640
I find studies that say vaccines have some value, but they run to brick wall when you

12:13.640 --> 12:19.680
ask them to show the data on masks and so, you know, I have one of the best of the best

12:19.680 --> 12:22.280
masks of the pandemic I saved from my kids.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.800
I don't, can you see my camera?

12:23.800 --> 12:24.960
I think you can.

12:24.960 --> 12:31.200
This is a mask that's the one that he wore for band that actually has con and con and

12:31.200 --> 12:36.480
Selmer, the horn makers on it with the hole in the middle for the, for where the instrument

12:36.480 --> 12:37.480
would go.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.280
I mean, this thing is, this thing is gold right here.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.520
This is almost as good in my mind as having one of those little coronavirus plushies from

12:44.520 --> 12:50.960
event 201, except this is actually like more like a, I don't know, this is real evidence

12:50.960 --> 12:51.960
of the crime.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.480
This is not a, this is not a trinket.

12:54.480 --> 12:59.240
This is extraordinary that teachers saw this happening and said nothing.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.760
I guess I would have lost my job as a grade school or high school teacher had this happened

13:04.760 --> 13:08.320
and I was, and I was in that position.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.320
Holy cow.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.320
Yeah.

13:10.320 --> 13:15.760
And you know, what, what amused me about that is that long before the pandemic occurred,

13:15.760 --> 13:21.280
I learned about these plague masks that people wore in like the 14th century, you know,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.280
these long look like a bird beak.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.280
They had cloves inside.

13:24.280 --> 13:32.440
And yeah, apparently the idea was if you, if you stuff this thing with enough herbs that

13:32.440 --> 13:37.360
that would have a purifying effect on whatever you were breathing and mature, you know,

13:37.360 --> 13:40.160
it would kill the virus now.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.160
You got to ask.

13:41.160 --> 13:47.040
Yeah, I got to wonder if somebody sold a mask today that was herb infused, you know, with

13:47.040 --> 13:54.200
a Regano or oil or something right to kill the virus, you know, doctor, somebody, somebody's

13:54.200 --> 13:58.920
patented, you know, coronavirus mask.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.360
People would buy it.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.200
And you know, really, when you think about it, there probably were some antimicrobial

14:06.200 --> 14:07.720
effects from some of the herbs.

14:07.720 --> 14:14.200
They were sticking in those plague masks in the 14th century, you know, possible that

14:14.200 --> 14:19.320
it's a very bear, at the very minimum, he might have been doing a better job.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.320
Yeah.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.800
At the very bare minimum, I've also understood it just as a way for them to deal with the

14:23.800 --> 14:27.320
stench of the death around as they were collecting bodies and so.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.200
So I don't, I don't know, but yeah, it would have been that too.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.200
Yep.

14:32.200 --> 14:38.480
But, you know, I want to say the, the, my broader theme here, again, is that like for

14:38.480 --> 14:43.480
your viewers, I like for anyone to feel a little bit more comfortable coming up with

14:43.480 --> 14:48.000
their own like 30 second elevator pitch.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.720
And I think kind of like the last thing I want to say is, um, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

14:53.720 --> 14:59.360
took some courses in statistics, statistics theory a long time ago, and I had a prof that

14:59.360 --> 15:11.240
had a technique, uh, our homework was to describe a, a concept in our own words and writing,

15:11.240 --> 15:17.400
um, you know, are squared or something like that, you know, write it in your own words,

15:18.400 --> 15:27.320
write it in your own words, um, and, uh, that's a great exercise, I think, for anyone

15:27.320 --> 15:34.080
think, trying to make sense of what happened right now, um, write down your own version

15:34.080 --> 15:41.240
of it, you know, just in Microsoft Word, your own personal version, and then, you know,

15:41.240 --> 15:47.480
try to edit it down, make it as short as possible, make it as punchy as possible,

15:47.480 --> 15:52.240
and sell it to people, see what kind of reaction you get, because I'll tell you what, you look

15:52.240 --> 15:58.800
at the news today, there's a lot of stuff out there that is going to shock people a

15:58.800 --> 16:04.600
lot more than anything you could possibly say about COVID, you know, and I think we're

16:04.600 --> 16:08.280
living in an era when you can get away with saying a lot more than you might have been

16:08.280 --> 16:21.280
able to say a year ago. And, uh, you know, whose fault is that? Right? No. Anyway, that's

16:21.280 --> 16:27.720
the end of my lecture. Really? I don't know that I have more to say. I'm very, I'm very

16:27.720 --> 16:34.000
excited to hear from, uh, from someone who still goes in somewhere. I still can't believe

16:34.000 --> 16:37.800
sometimes I spend a whole week just here in this garage and then upstairs in my house

16:37.800 --> 16:43.520
and then maybe walk in the dog. And that's it. And, uh, yeah, it's a, it's a real, it's

16:43.520 --> 16:49.280
a real, um, it's a real lame, lame couple of years. It's been from a social perspective,

16:49.280 --> 16:54.520
working at a university, in the department of other scientists, going to lectures and,

16:54.520 --> 17:01.200
and, uh, lunches and seminars. And, uh, yeah, it's, it's a kind of gregariousness that I

17:01.200 --> 17:06.680
miss. So it's, uh, it's nice to have somebody come on my show that I also talk to in my

17:06.720 --> 17:13.000
private life. Um, it makes this feel a little less lonely here. So thanks very much. You

17:13.000 --> 17:18.600
know, more importantly, the, the, the message, if I can summarize it again, is that it seems

17:18.600 --> 17:25.680
like people are more apt to, to go farther than just the, the Scooby-Doo, which is, oh,

17:25.680 --> 17:31.040
it was a lab leak. Um, and, uh, they covered it up a little bit and we might be able to

17:31.040 --> 17:34.680
actually push people to understand that it's a little more complicated than that. And that

17:34.680 --> 17:40.960
makes me very excited. Um, maybe more people are going to wake up faster. I don't know.

17:40.960 --> 17:51.960
Um, maybe, maybe, um, one thing I'll say, um, in my, as an office goer, um, is that, uh,

17:51.960 --> 17:57.320
you know, one, one of the effects of the pandemic really was to murder small businesses. And

17:57.320 --> 18:02.720
I see the effects of that when I go to the office because, you know, I got a lunch break

18:02.720 --> 18:09.840
and I'm used to going out and having options. And, uh, now we got like a Dunkin' Donuts

18:09.840 --> 18:16.600
and a potbelline and, you know, yeah, yeah, it's about it, right? Um, every other place

18:16.600 --> 18:21.720
is gone. You know, you watch the dark cleaning done that place is gone. Now these are all

18:21.720 --> 18:32.000
small family owned businesses gone immigrant owned primarily gone. You know, um, and what's

18:32.000 --> 18:35.680
going to bring those back? What do we want? You know, I don't know. What's the plan for

18:35.680 --> 18:40.560
these cities? Um, you know, that's a kind of discussion. I think it's appropriate for

18:40.560 --> 18:45.360
people to be having. I think that maybe is a more productive discussion than some of the

18:45.360 --> 18:50.720
weird finger pointing that's been going on or the, you know, the efforts to, you know,

18:50.720 --> 18:56.640
get people riled up and get substacked subscribers and whatnot. You know, take a look at your city.

18:56.720 --> 19:01.680
Yeah. Take a look at how many businesses are boarded up and gone. Yeah. Anyway,

19:02.320 --> 19:08.160
I think that's, uh, wow, that's, uh, it is. It's a sobering thing to think about. But that's

19:08.160 --> 19:13.520
what I've been saying on the stream lately. I think you're vaguely aware that it really does

19:13.520 --> 19:20.880
feel focused on, on Main Street. And, uh, we can't, I don't know, I don't think we can underestimate

19:20.880 --> 19:27.040
how much we can do locally indeed and building, rebuilding community and connecting with our

19:27.040 --> 19:34.560
neighbors. Um, some of us have to run for school board or, or, or town council or, or whatever it

19:34.560 --> 19:40.240
is. Otherwise the, the same people are going to keep running and the same, the same, uh,

19:40.240 --> 19:44.400
train is going to keep moving. I don't really know how to encourage people to do it because,

19:44.400 --> 19:49.920
you know, it's, it's, it's a big commitment and it's a big risk. But at some point, we're all

19:49.920 --> 19:54.720
going to have to try at some point to do something, um, a little bit more concrete and maybe,

19:55.600 --> 20:03.520
you know, uh, writing an elevator pitch of your own and, and trying to speak it into a video or

20:03.520 --> 20:09.840
something like that so that the next time, uh, a friend or a relative, um, gives you an opening,

20:09.840 --> 20:14.000
you have this elevator pitch to say, you know, have you ever considered the possibility that it

20:14.080 --> 20:20.880
wouldn't take a lot more than a, a spectacular commitment to a, a story for the world to believe

20:20.880 --> 20:27.280
a story, especially given what, what we use our phones for nowadays, um, and then get them thinking

20:27.280 --> 20:33.920
from that perspective and maybe even the, maybe even a good way to start is to say, do you think

20:33.920 --> 20:38.880
that this pandemic could have happened if we all had phones that still hung on the wall and we had

20:38.880 --> 20:45.600
to answer and ask who are you calling for? Um, I wonder, I don't think it could have been. Um, and,

20:46.320 --> 20:54.000
and that's part of the problem now going forward is that I think we are really being distracted with

20:54.000 --> 21:00.800
future artificial intelligence dangers to make sure that we don't take any meaningful action

21:00.800 --> 21:07.600
against the artificial intelligence already deployed against us. And they're going to play

21:07.600 --> 21:13.280
a shell game for a very long time until we beg for digital ID on the internet. And so I think

21:13.280 --> 21:18.960
we've got to get a couple dominoes ahead of them and already either come up with a way to

21:20.000 --> 21:29.440
sort of establish an anonymous internet of our own or, or to somehow do an end around where we

21:29.440 --> 21:35.360
elect officials that understand that anonymity on the internet is somehow intimately related to

21:36.240 --> 21:42.720
our, our rights to assemble. And so if we can make everybody young people aware of the idea

21:43.280 --> 21:48.960
of that right to assemble and what it really means and how it's been potentially encroached

21:48.960 --> 21:57.680
on in the past and how our new existence, which has little to do with us going to the, I don't know,

21:57.680 --> 22:04.320
the, the VFW or the local bar anymore to meet up with our friends or to interact with our community,

22:04.960 --> 22:09.840
her interacting primarily on social media, then I think we can even make a stronger argument for

22:09.840 --> 22:15.760
our right to assemble to be primarily if we're going to talk about a set of laws that kind of

22:15.760 --> 22:19.520
flows with the culture, well, then you better preserve that right on the internet. If we're

22:19.520 --> 22:23.280
going to preserve it anywhere, seeing as that's the primary place where people meet, can you,

22:23.840 --> 22:27.280
can you end on that at all? I don't know how I pulled that out of my hat, but I think that's

22:27.280 --> 22:33.600
something you might be able to close on. Yeah, it's a, it's a great point. Um, because, um,

22:34.480 --> 22:38.960
you know, we do have a First Amendment, we do talk about it a lot, but you know, when you

22:38.960 --> 22:44.480
actually go back and look at the history of the First Amendment, there isn't a whole lot of,

22:44.480 --> 22:50.880
there aren't a whole lot of occasions when courts have actually said anything about it, right?

22:51.840 --> 22:57.680
You want to go back and look for the latest Supreme Court case on, you know, let's say hate

22:57.680 --> 23:04.560
speech or some whatever you want to call it, okay? It's from the 1960s, okay? Um, now it's true that

23:04.560 --> 23:12.560
we've got freedom of assembly, uh, that's, that's, you know, that's, that's a core value, um, and

23:12.560 --> 23:18.400
it's connected to freedom of speech. And there is a Supreme Court case on this, so it's called

23:18.480 --> 23:27.360
NAACP Alabama. Um, and, uh, it's an interesting case because, uh, you know, the NAACP, again,

23:27.360 --> 23:31.760
everybody understands it when you tell it to them. It's just like controlled release. It's,

23:31.760 --> 23:37.920
it doesn't take, it's real easy to understand. NAACP wants to do business in Alabama.

23:38.560 --> 23:46.560
State of Alabama says we want to see your membership list. NAACP said, uh, no.

23:47.360 --> 23:54.960
Uh, that went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court said, uh, yeah, we don't get where

23:54.960 --> 24:02.080
the NAACP's coming from here. You know, let's, uh, you know, uh, do I really need to explain to

24:02.080 --> 24:09.040
people why the NAACP needed anonymity? I don't think so. Do I need to explain to people why Alabama

24:09.040 --> 24:14.720
want to see that membership list? I don't think so. And I think that same rule should apply today.

24:14.800 --> 24:20.160
That's still good case law. It's just that, you know, it's been, that was from the 1960s,

24:20.160 --> 24:24.800
and it's just been a while since, uh, that case popped up. But I'll tell you what, how many people

24:24.800 --> 24:30.960
predicted that, uh, we'd get a nine to zero, uh, unanimous decision, okay, the other day.

24:30.960 --> 24:35.040
How many people predicted that? How many people predicted it was percurium?

24:36.720 --> 24:44.240
Um, you know, if they didn't predict it, why listen to them? You know, why pay any attention

24:44.240 --> 24:48.800
to any other predictions they make about the way things are going to go, you know, again,

24:48.800 --> 24:53.760
write your own story. Percurium is when they don't have an author of the opinion. Is that right?

24:53.760 --> 24:58.720
When they don't tell you who wrote it? Yeah, okay. Yeah. People think it's, you know,

24:58.720 --> 25:02.800
people still don't get this, but, you know, the Supreme Court doesn't have to tell you who wrote

25:02.800 --> 25:08.160
an opinion. You know, people get all shocked when the Supreme Court does this. Oh, it's percurium.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.600
Like it's some big deal, you know, it's just, it's an old trick.

25:11.840 --> 25:19.440
Yeah, I see. I see. Well, yeah. All right. So the gears of the gears of the, of the, of the

25:19.440 --> 25:25.440
of the, of the Republic grind on, and we have to, uh, grab hold of the steering wheel. Again,

25:25.440 --> 25:31.520
I appreciate you taking time out of your afternoon, um, to speak to me and, uh, you know, come back

25:31.520 --> 25:38.960
whenever you can. Grateful for the opportunity. All right. All right. Thank you. Sign it off. Bye-bye.

25:38.960 --> 25:46.720
Bye-bye. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Well, ladies and gentlemen,

25:46.720 --> 25:54.320
you heard the regular guy there. Um, I think we have reason to be hopeful. Uh, I think we have

25:54.320 --> 26:01.680
reason to be, to be optimistic that there is this window, maybe a very narrow one, maybe an

26:01.680 --> 26:08.080
extremely narrow path. Um, but that that wouldn't be anything new. Um, it wouldn't be any news. If I,

26:08.080 --> 26:14.320
if we found out that it was an extremely narrow path that we needed to walk. Um, and I do really

26:14.320 --> 26:23.360
think it starts with reflecting on how we have and have not led for our young people. And I do

26:23.360 --> 26:28.400
think I and others have identified a very crucial mistake that we made when we allowed our young

26:28.400 --> 26:36.480
people to go back to college, back to universities and surrender to those authorities their basic

26:36.480 --> 26:42.400
health, freedom and sovereignty over their bodies. Um, and it would have been very easy for us as

26:42.400 --> 26:49.120
adults to have either raised children that would have known better or to have taken that as a

26:49.120 --> 26:57.760
teachable moment and, and defined for them what was wrong about going back to college and submitting

26:57.760 --> 27:07.440
to those university protocols, whatever they were. And that was a very, very crucial time in the

27:07.440 --> 27:13.200
worst case scenario where, you know, ramping up this discussion of what could happen, what might

27:13.200 --> 27:18.880
happen, what had to be avoided from kept from happening. Don't go home over Christmas break

27:18.880 --> 27:26.640
because you might kill your grandparents. This was not a real, this, this was not a real thing.

27:26.640 --> 27:33.760
This was a, this was a psychological attack on our, on our societies around the globe. And for

27:33.760 --> 27:41.680
sure in the English speaking, TV watching nations that people often generalize call the west.

27:43.680 --> 27:48.320
And we need to come to terms with that. We all need to come to terms with that.

27:48.320 --> 27:58.560
And I don't know where else to start, but with that. And at that stage, you might be having a

27:58.560 --> 28:04.000
conversation where lots of different age groups can listen to you. College parents can listen to

28:04.000 --> 28:11.280
you. College kids can listen to you. High schoolers don't need to be told how screwed up it was.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.480
Because high schoolers were suddenly on their own.

28:20.480 --> 28:26.880
Suddenly the authority figures took over. Suddenly they, they, I mean, yes, it was really bad.

28:29.680 --> 28:35.280
And the college kids, yeah, I don't know what to say other than they may be in the worst shape

28:35.920 --> 28:43.600
because they've also been, you know, mentally assaulted by the contradictions and obfuscation

28:43.600 --> 28:51.120
of the rest of what is now modern college life, modern university life. Back when I went to university

28:51.120 --> 29:00.320
in the, in the 90s, the early 90s, the theme was multiculturalism. And so it was still, you know,

29:00.400 --> 29:06.000
you had to find your hyphenated identity. And since I was, you know, this, that and the other

29:06.000 --> 29:12.400
American, it was difficult for me to, to find the right group, you know, so to speak, the right

29:12.400 --> 29:18.640
sweatshirt to wear. And so I just found myself saying I'm an American and telling everybody over

29:18.640 --> 29:23.200
and over again, no, not a Native American, just an American, my mom's Filipino, my dad's a tall

29:23.200 --> 29:30.240
white guy from Wisconsin is what you get. Ladies and gentlemen, it's just, it's, it's a

29:30.240 --> 29:36.640
about each country coming to terms with what they did or didn't do in response to this, this

29:36.640 --> 29:44.640
narrative. And what, what, what parts of their principles they, they compromised on. And it's,

29:44.640 --> 29:51.120
it's up to all of us to reflect on what principles we compromised on to repent on it. And then to

29:51.120 --> 30:00.080
get back on that very, very narrow path. Because that's our only hope. No one person that we elect

30:00.800 --> 30:07.360
no one person that we follow, no one person that we support is going to solve this problem.

30:08.560 --> 30:15.440
We each have our own heavy lifting to do. We have our own heavy lifting to do with our families. We

30:15.440 --> 30:20.480
have our own heavy lifting to do with our, with the way that we earn a living. And we have our own

30:20.480 --> 30:30.000
heavy lifting with coming to terms with how we processed the, the events of 2020 and 2021 and how

30:30.000 --> 30:39.280
well we stuck to our principles. And once we give, give that, that self account, we can also,

30:39.280 --> 30:45.760
you know, lead by example, for other people to feel comfortable with taking that, you know,

30:45.760 --> 30:51.760
taking account of what they actually did. This could be a moment where hundreds of, of doctors,

30:51.760 --> 30:58.320
even thousands of doctors come to terms with the shortcomings of Western allopathic medicine.

30:58.960 --> 31:05.680
And it could be a revival of everything that, that might be good about it. The, the real, you know,

31:06.720 --> 31:13.200
the real biologics and the real pharmaceuticals that, that there are probably a few that actually

31:13.200 --> 31:17.840
work, you know, there are probably a few things that are worth making purified. There are probably

31:17.840 --> 31:24.720
a few substances that are worth having in your medicine cabinet besides salt and pepper.

31:25.360 --> 31:32.880
Now, the question is, can we be humble enough about where we are to really come to terms with

31:32.880 --> 31:38.960
the fact that we have grossly overextended ourselves way beyond that bright lead red line, which is

31:39.600 --> 31:45.760
the sacred. And we've got to shake our heads and, you know, dump a nice bucket over our heads and,

31:45.760 --> 31:51.280
and wake ourselves up to this reality. And then we wouldn't need to be having these,

31:51.840 --> 31:57.440
you know, really tiptoey discussions that we do about, about the definition of transgender,

31:57.440 --> 32:03.840
the definition of a woman or, or whatever the latest limited spectrum of debate is that everybody's

32:03.840 --> 32:10.800
screaming within. We would be talking about, you know, things that we've agreed on for generations

32:10.800 --> 32:17.200
independent of how they are specifically drawn in the cartoon or what heroes are expressing those

32:17.200 --> 32:22.240
ideals. There are things that we've agreed on for generations. And those things are being

32:22.240 --> 32:28.960
thrown out now for some very specific reason. And that is, I think to create the chaos necessary

32:28.960 --> 32:34.800
to control demolish the country that we call the United States of America. And I don't want

32:34.800 --> 32:43.280
that to happen. This is all I got. United States of America is is who I am. It's I grew up a mall

32:43.280 --> 32:54.640
rat. I grew up. It's funny on Twitter, I grew up having Pizza Hut nights. I grew up having a

32:54.640 --> 33:03.120
letter jacket and riding a bus to away games. I was at a small enough school where we really never

33:03.120 --> 33:08.240
had a run through sign. And when we finally had a run through sign, it really was just a two by

33:08.320 --> 33:14.640
four frame, you know, big enough for one person to pop through. It wasn't our cheerleaders like

33:14.640 --> 33:20.880
didn't throw each other around and stuff like that. And we didn't even have a drum set actually

33:20.880 --> 33:25.520
in the pet band. That's how small it was. We had drums, but not a drum, not a drum set like a lot

33:25.520 --> 33:32.080
of schools have nowadays. I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing wrong with

33:32.960 --> 33:39.200
with with the way that we were raising our kids back a generation ago or so. There wasn't really

33:39.200 --> 33:44.160
anything wrong with it. Well, most of the problems that we have right now can be traced to the way

33:44.160 --> 33:52.000
that we eat and the way that we behave. Very few, if any, of the problems that we are currently

33:52.000 --> 33:58.960
experiencing are due to inherent faults of our own genetics or inherent faults of of the system.

33:59.120 --> 34:07.600
Except for the way we eat and the way we behave. We had something pretty decent here in America

34:07.600 --> 34:16.720
with our Constitution. And with Thomas Jefferson. Is that who I'm talking about? Yeah, I think so.

34:16.720 --> 34:24.160
Yes, I get them all mixed up all of a sudden. But definitely, the beginning of the declaration

34:24.880 --> 34:29.920
of independence, I think, is what we need to focus on the very beginning. The part that Woodrow

34:29.920 --> 34:37.840
Wilson said we shouldn't read anymore. That's the part we need to focus on. Because I think

34:37.840 --> 34:42.480
there are a tremendous number of distractions right now that are designed to get us to come up

34:42.480 --> 34:49.120
with a million different solutions and a million different bad guys. When in reality, if American

34:49.200 --> 34:57.200
citizens can take back control of America, if American citizens can can wake up and realize that

34:58.160 --> 35:06.480
you know, there is a way. I mean, you know, voting voting commissioners are sometimes not even

35:07.200 --> 35:14.480
elected by 500 votes. City commissioners can be elected by a few thousand votes.

35:15.280 --> 35:21.360
And so taking back control of our local elections and taking back control of our local governments

35:21.360 --> 35:27.840
is not impossible. Taking back control of the federal federal government may be more difficult

35:27.840 --> 35:31.680
because of the amount of money that is involved. But taking back control of our local governments

35:31.680 --> 35:39.680
is not impossible. And actually, a lot more powerful than you might think. So there's lots of ways,

35:40.640 --> 35:46.720
there's lots of ways forward. But most of it just going to have to do with action. And that's what's

35:46.720 --> 35:56.240
so difficult right now. We are so, so, and I included are so vulnerable to using our phones and watching

35:56.240 --> 36:01.920
our phones and killing time. Because there's so many ways to kill time that a lot of us don't

36:02.000 --> 36:11.120
realize that a thousand, you know, one minute videos is a lot of wasted time. And we got to get

36:11.120 --> 36:17.840
back to, you know, sitting down and reading books. We got to get back down to having dinner at

36:17.840 --> 36:25.520
other people's houses and having conversations and playing cards. We got to get back to building

36:25.520 --> 36:35.280
community again and remembering what it was to be a community. And maybe we have to look forward

36:35.280 --> 36:39.760
to and try to find new ways to build community on the internet that aren't subject to the

36:40.560 --> 36:45.920
kinds of screening and censorship that are normally found on the internet. And that would mean again,

36:46.480 --> 36:53.440
you know, things like my soapbox, where in theory, you know, we can be harassed by random people

36:53.440 --> 36:58.880
from all over the universe. But we can also have conversations with each other and block those

36:58.880 --> 37:05.040
people. And expect that in that feed is going to be basically everything that everybody posts.

37:06.080 --> 37:12.720
And no specific order except for temporally. The way that, you know, a microblogging app like

37:12.720 --> 37:17.520
Twitter was imagined to work. And it actually, if you're not paying very close attention, you

37:18.240 --> 37:25.200
will find that your brain starts to imagine that that's the way that that platform works,

37:25.200 --> 37:32.080
that this is a town square, you know, like if you just walk downtown and looked at the bulletin

37:32.080 --> 37:37.040
board that's behind the little locked window and you read what was coming up for the community

37:37.040 --> 37:42.880
events. You imagine that it's something like that. But in reality, it's not. In reality,

37:42.880 --> 37:47.040
you should think of it more like a notebook full of things that was written by somebody else or

37:47.040 --> 37:52.960
crafted by somebody else for you in particular. And then they're wonder very skeptically,

37:52.960 --> 37:59.200
now wait a minute, did they put this here to benefit me? Or did they put this list of possible

37:59.200 --> 38:05.520
tweets that they could show me to benefit them? That's what I wonder when I see people who follow

38:05.520 --> 38:10.960
thousands of people. What do you imagine happens? Do you imagine that you're scrolling up Twitter

38:10.960 --> 38:16.400
and you're reading the posts from all of these thousands of people that you follow and their

38:16.400 --> 38:23.840
retweets and their quotes? And that by scrolling for a couple hours, you're able to follow all

38:23.840 --> 38:31.920
2,565 people that you follow. Does that even make sense? I guess those people are more likely to

38:31.920 --> 38:39.200
just be spreading their own word and not reading anybody's tweets. And so you can see then how

38:39.200 --> 38:45.280
toxic this whole app is because depending on your objectives, it could be something where you're

38:45.280 --> 38:51.200
just yelling into it and hoping that it goes through as many tubes as possible. Or it could be something

38:51.200 --> 38:57.760
that you genuinely look to as a window to reality. And that's where Twitter is very, very dangerous

38:57.760 --> 39:03.520
because it is not a window into reality. At best, it is a tube that you can yell into and hope that

39:03.520 --> 39:09.280
it goes out many other tubes. And maybe you can game that system by who you follow and who you

39:09.280 --> 39:13.040
don't or who you mute and who you don't. And then when you yell through the tube, you think it goes

39:13.040 --> 39:18.000
to different places. But in reality, you can't really verify what tubes see it and what tubes

39:18.000 --> 39:25.360
don't anyway, ever. It's secret. It's proprietary. And so the more time you waste on that platform,

39:25.360 --> 39:29.920
the more time you waste not having meaningful conversation with your family and friends or at

39:29.920 --> 39:36.720
least listening to people who will provoke meaningful trains of thought.

39:38.240 --> 39:43.840
Then you are really a slave to that to that other thing, that other, you know, entity that's

39:43.840 --> 39:50.320
dropped over your face and that you can go limp as you listen to it. So we got to be very careful

39:50.320 --> 39:55.200
because there's truth out there somewhere it is out there and you know it because you can feel it

39:55.280 --> 40:02.960
in your heart. I mean, even Tucker Carlson wasn't lying when he said all of the things that he said

40:02.960 --> 40:08.480
the other day, he doesn't want to lie. He tries not to lie. He thinks it's important not to lie,

40:08.480 --> 40:13.440
but he has lied and he probably will lie again. All true statements.

40:13.440 --> 40:26.720
And so trust your heart, mute or stop following everybody that does not ring true. And in the end,

40:26.720 --> 40:33.280
you will find parallel streams to the truth. It doesn't matter if I ring true. If you follow

40:33.280 --> 40:39.440
your heart and it says that Jonathan Cooey doesn't ring right to me, then that you need to follow

40:39.520 --> 40:46.240
that and follow who rings true to you. And otherwise,

40:49.600 --> 40:59.840
you know, we're never going to win. And so I hope that as a person who doesn't mind holding

40:59.840 --> 41:05.760
the heavy flashlight, that I can help some people get closer to the exit of the cave,

41:06.560 --> 41:11.440
I hope that some of the people that I've been able to network with, including regular guy,

41:11.440 --> 41:18.960
are people that are that people will find useful in terms of helping them to get the correct

41:18.960 --> 41:24.080
trains of thought going in their mind, because that's what this is really about. And when you

41:24.080 --> 41:31.840
surrender your mind and your attention to social media, you are surrendering your attention and

41:31.920 --> 41:39.920
your mind most likely to the tools of the enslavers. And I'm working against slavery here. I'm working

41:39.920 --> 41:47.600
against those that will enslave our children. And I believe with my whole heart, soul mind,

41:48.320 --> 41:54.000
that they are enslaving us with a series of lies. They have a spectacular commitment to a

41:54.000 --> 42:00.400
mythology that they've created over a few decades. They have every intention of not only reducing

42:00.400 --> 42:05.360
population, but as they reduce population over the next couple generations. And they would love

42:05.360 --> 42:11.200
to be able to record the genetic data from every living human being on the planet. So

42:11.760 --> 42:15.680
the faster they can get to that goal, the better they'll do it in a million different ways,

42:16.320 --> 42:22.400
subverted and with direct and indirect asks. And you're going to see that happen more and more

42:22.400 --> 42:28.080
and more. So if you pay very close attention to the people that are put in front of us that are

42:28.160 --> 42:33.360
purported to be the heroes, you're going to find an awful lot of them involved in sequencing. A lot

42:33.360 --> 42:39.840
of them are involved in, you know, sampling this, that or the other genome and trying to

42:40.640 --> 42:46.640
understand how this genome or that genome or this, this plethora of genomes works together.

42:47.680 --> 42:53.680
And these people that say that they're saving us are more likely, in my mind, if you trace back

42:53.680 --> 42:59.040
their history, you're going to find them associated with HIV, which I think a lot of us will now

42:59.040 --> 43:06.800
agree was probably an elaborate something or other. You will also find them connected very nicely

43:08.400 --> 43:14.400
to any number of technologies related to the human genome project and spinoffs of it. And so

43:14.400 --> 43:19.920
if you find somebody has worked on the blast algorithm or used to do sequence deep sequencing

43:19.920 --> 43:27.360
algorithms before they graduated from college, it's not a coincidence. Because all of these

43:27.360 --> 43:31.920
people that are involved seem to be, in my humble opinion, this is the last thing I'm going to say

43:31.920 --> 43:39.600
and then I'm going to go, then I'm going to go play some hoop, and then I'm going to come back

43:39.600 --> 43:44.240
and probably do a stream after dinner. But I'm not sure about that. But I have this video of Leo

43:44.240 --> 43:50.880
Biddle that I'd really like to listen to. But yeah, now I forgot what I was going to say,

43:50.880 --> 43:57.840
which is too bad. But anyway, I'll think of it later. Regular guy and I have been in regular

43:57.840 --> 44:02.720
off and on communication, but it's been very difficult to get him online. And so it was good

44:02.720 --> 44:09.360
to have him on, good to put his voice out there again. I consider him a very, very good friend

44:09.920 --> 44:16.480
and somebody that I rely on a lot to keep my head level. And so yeah, I don't know.

44:17.680 --> 44:22.720
This has just been kind of a funny stream. I don't know why I'm just letting it flow here. But I

44:22.720 --> 44:27.840
think that's sometimes what I need to do. I hit the stream button. So you know, you got to hit the

44:27.840 --> 44:34.800
stream button, you got to have something to say. And I think we're at a turning point. I don't

44:34.800 --> 44:42.240
think regular guy is wrong. I think there's reason to have hope that they've bent too far.

44:43.200 --> 44:49.040
There's a lot of things that are bent beyond recovery now. And so if we just keep this steady

44:49.040 --> 44:56.000
pressure on, things are going to start to snap. And as things start to snap, more and more people

44:56.000 --> 45:04.720
will become aware of the extent to which we've been taken and become aware of this huge

45:04.720 --> 45:11.600
possibility space that doesn't have any magic tricks or any special new military technologies in

45:11.600 --> 45:18.400
it and still contains all the ingredients necessary to explain what happened right down to positive

45:18.400 --> 45:24.400
PCR tests and sequences that seem to match a virus that was first reported in WUHA.

45:25.840 --> 45:30.960
I think we're really close, ladies and gentlemen. I think the steady pressure that has been, you

45:30.960 --> 45:38.480
know, combining forces and combining knowledge and combining experience with someone like

45:38.480 --> 45:44.480
Jessica Hockett, with someone like Mark Koolack, with someone like Nick Hudson, has really become

45:45.200 --> 45:54.400
something very strengthening and edifying. And so I'm extremely hopeful that this gets

45:54.960 --> 46:00.080
interesting very quick. And one of the things that I can promise you, I have been promising for a while,

46:00.720 --> 46:06.240
is that the giga-owned biological, you know, elevator pitch in a written form is coming very

46:06.240 --> 46:11.680
soon. We'll release it on my sub stack. And you don't need to be a paid subscriber to subscribe

46:11.680 --> 46:16.720
to my sub stack. Don't feel any obligation to that, although I can tell you again,

46:18.000 --> 46:27.600
this stream is funded by only the viewers now. And since CHD decided to end my position in January

46:27.600 --> 46:33.680
4th of 2024, we have been coasting on fumes and we have made it and we are making it.

46:34.800 --> 46:42.560
But I do not want to give any impression that this is something that is easy right now or

46:42.560 --> 46:47.680
something that is very comfortable, but it is something that I know in my heart of hearts that I have to

46:47.680 --> 46:55.920
do. And so I'm going to keep doing it. And I just want to put out a very humble ask

46:56.800 --> 47:02.080
for, you know, anybody that that really is in a genuine position to be able to give up $10 a

47:02.080 --> 47:07.120
month to go to the website and subscribe. If you're in a position to give up more than that,

47:08.320 --> 47:13.600
yeah, it would be great. But right now, if we could just find, you know,

47:16.720 --> 47:23.920
I think it's like 800 or 900 subscribers, we would be really in a position where I could do

47:23.920 --> 47:30.240
a daily show. I could put out, you know, weekly PDFs and we can get this peer tube thing

47:30.880 --> 47:39.840
to a level where we can have 1000 or 2000 people watching it live on a platform that isn't Twitch.

47:40.400 --> 47:47.440
It's not going to drop in a 30 second ad and will not have any algorithms, will not have any

47:47.520 --> 47:54.320
pop ups and will just be a website that we can access and that everybody can use. And they can't

47:54.320 --> 48:00.240
really do anything about it because these servers are gigantic and the internet is a mess. And

48:01.360 --> 48:06.560
if we just stick to ourselves and build this community grassroots, one person at a time,

48:07.360 --> 48:13.200
come to the peer tube, see the stream, don't bother with Twitch anymore. I think we can expand

48:13.280 --> 48:18.960
in a way that here to four, we haven't been able to expand because I know what Twitch is. I see

48:18.960 --> 48:24.400
what Twitch is. I haven't installed on my phone and I have to do like three clicks in order to get

48:24.400 --> 48:30.720
to my own channel because so much garbage and so many live streamers there doing nothing are

48:30.720 --> 48:36.560
thrown in front of me. So I know what Twitch is and I know how annoying it is that, you know,

48:36.640 --> 48:45.600
3,000 of you have decided 3,107 have done all of the necessary absolute absurdity in order to

48:45.600 --> 48:53.920
subscribe to this channel just shows you how incredibly well we are doing because 3,107

48:53.920 --> 48:59.040
subscribers on Twitch, I'm not asking for anymore because I don't want anybody else to install the

48:59.040 --> 49:05.600
app. So I think in a couple weeks already, we're going to be able to have this peer tube running

49:06.160 --> 49:11.840
and we can start to use Twitch as like a replay and we'll always go live on peer

49:11.840 --> 49:20.240
tube instead and that's where we're going to build build for real. So how about them apples?

49:20.240 --> 49:26.080
Does that does that work? I think that's okay, right?

49:30.720 --> 49:34.640
Yeah, independent media, I think that's really it. And I think independent media,

49:34.640 --> 49:39.440
what you need to be honest about doesn't really require very much. If a thousand of us get together,

49:41.760 --> 49:50.240
I think if I had a thousand subscribers, I could probably afford the server, all the upkeep.

49:51.680 --> 49:57.360
We have a couple volunteers right now that are pretty high level IT guys that are donating talent

49:57.360 --> 50:06.000
and treasure at the same time to get this peer tube up. And so I have reasonable hope that in

50:06.000 --> 50:11.520
between one and four weeks from now, we will have it. The only reason why I give extra

50:12.480 --> 50:18.320
breadth for the timeframe that I'm promising is because I know that the people that are helping me

50:18.320 --> 50:24.960
right now actually have a private life that is a little complicated. And despite this incredibly,

50:25.440 --> 50:33.600
you know, busy life with a with a career and and and all the issues of family and kids,

50:34.400 --> 50:40.480
this person and persons rather are donating their time to build this peer tube. So I don't

50:40.480 --> 50:44.960
want any pressure on them. They already feel pressure because they're also excited about

50:45.520 --> 50:53.920
about finally providing this for giga home. And so it is with great humility and patience that I say

50:54.480 --> 50:58.800
that we are very close. The same the same fellow that helped me with the soap box

50:59.760 --> 51:05.040
is helping me with stream dot giga home dot bio. And I do think it's going to happen very soon.

51:05.040 --> 51:09.280
This weekend, I'm going to be gone. Don't forget from Friday until Monday because I'm going to

51:09.280 --> 51:16.640
the broken science, critical thinking boot camp. I will do a report with some videos from there.

51:16.640 --> 51:22.160
And I will do a summary report on Tuesday of that. I think maybe with some materials that I gather

51:22.160 --> 51:27.120
while I'm there and some shout outs from people that I meet. I'm so I'm excited about that. And I

51:27.120 --> 51:31.520
will probably be on later tonight and also definitely tomorrow. So thanks for joining me for this

51:31.520 --> 51:38.080
spontaneous regular guy stream. See you again soon.
