00:30.928 --> 00:37.993
Actually, JJ Coey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:38.713 --> 00:45.878
Actually, JJ Coey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:46.638 --> 00:53.783
Actually, JJ Coey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:54.543 --> 00:55.004
Actually, J.J.

00:55.084 --> 01:02.109
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:02.489 --> 01:02.990
Actually, J.J.

01:03.010 --> 01:09.695
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:10.456 --> 01:10.896
Actually, J.J.

01:10.976 --> 01:17.641
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:33.555 --> 02:53.988
I don't care how you get there.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.689
I don't care what you do to get there.

02:58.590 --> 02:59.291
The goal is to live.

03:12.832 --> 03:15.093
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

03:15.174 --> 03:23.878
This is Giga Ohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist catching you right in the middle of your daily hamster grind.

03:25.078 --> 03:29.881
And I hope that I can bring some hope, some good news, some obviously

03:30.581 --> 03:39.566
Not so different news, but I do think it's still very important to stay focused on the main goals, which is to wean ourselves off of social media by building our own.

03:40.727 --> 03:44.769
That includes PeerTube and Soapbox instances that you yourself can also fund.

03:45.630 --> 03:50.673
And don't forget, I'm sorry, Brian, I don't like the word autism.

03:51.553 --> 03:52.454
He was vaccine damaged.

03:52.574 --> 03:53.475
Ryan, I understand.

03:53.495 --> 03:55.737
Thank you very much for pointing that out.

03:56.218 --> 04:00.483
Intramuscular injection is something that they never want questioned.

04:00.983 --> 04:03.846
Virology is a science they never want questioned.

04:03.926 --> 04:07.330
And public health is a reason that they never want questioned.

04:07.390 --> 04:13.176
And the way that they prevent it from being questioned is things like the autism spectrum disorder and what causes it.

04:14.057 --> 04:32.223
um the autism spectrum disorder and what genes are behind it uh just like pandemics and what what spike protein inserts are behind it what fear and cleavage sites are required what things are these crazy scientists doing and the same thing is being achieved there

04:32.743 --> 04:34.606
that was being achieved with AIDS.

04:35.306 --> 04:36.548
This is all a big trap.

04:37.049 --> 04:47.441
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, why the conspiracy theories are free on social media, then you will probably perish in that trap.

04:48.563 --> 04:51.486
It's the same illusion that Google has solved.

04:52.347 --> 04:53.267
protein folding.

04:54.227 --> 04:59.049
It is the same social media illusion that keeps this biology hidden.

05:00.289 --> 05:01.209
Welcome to the show.

05:01.669 --> 05:10.792
If you're not following Housatonic Live, you're probably not watching me either, but if you're still unaware that this guy's work is important, please go there.

05:11.492 --> 05:12.012
You don't really

05:12.692 --> 05:17.818
need to do very much other than to go to his website, look at the research links, and start browsing.

05:18.199 --> 05:23.364
And then, you know, occasionally you might be curious as to the guy who's archiving that and what he's got to say.

05:23.384 --> 05:26.848
This is another sub stack I think that's very important to share because

05:27.629 --> 05:31.612
Scotland is one of the best places to see how the population pyramid was managed.

05:31.712 --> 05:32.252
It's ugly.

05:33.193 --> 05:35.855
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth will set us all free.

05:35.955 --> 05:38.676
Most importantly, the truth will set our children free.

05:39.557 --> 05:40.518
That's the trick here.

05:40.918 --> 05:42.439
We're trying to set our children free.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.640
Make no mistakes about it.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.322
This is not a game for

05:49.084 --> 05:49.664
For points.

05:49.744 --> 06:07.565
It's not a game for money or share prices All of this stuff is bullshit shenanigans that yes You know there are people that are doing that and interested in that and motivated by that, but those are useful tools America and much of the Western world is being ripped apart and

06:08.686 --> 06:20.214
from the inside, on purpose, and as long as you keep believing it's the City of London, or the Vatican, or DC, or bankers, you're going to be missing the big picture.

06:21.175 --> 06:22.816
This is about the species.

06:23.737 --> 06:33.564
So we're talking about people that don't operate inside of the normal ideas of governance and inside the normal ideas of human society.

06:34.548 --> 06:36.808
If you have been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

06:36.848 --> 06:44.130
And otherwise, you might be a social media, skilled social media user that has wandered into the wrong place on the internet.

06:44.170 --> 06:44.950
But fear not.

06:45.450 --> 06:49.171
You're actually welcome here, because ultimately, this is a message for you.

06:49.991 --> 06:52.292
You've got to stay focused on biology.

06:52.332 --> 06:55.872
You've got to not take the ridiculous bait that is on social media.

06:55.892 --> 07:02.334
Do not underestimate how much of social media is effectively fake, false, or even artificial.

07:03.734 --> 07:07.716
And love your neighbor means breathing people that live near you.

07:08.757 --> 07:12.999
People that you see on the train, on the bus, on your bike, on your dog walk.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.220
These are your neighbors.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.222
And we've got to get off social media as much as possible.

07:18.302 --> 07:20.003
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

07:21.295 --> 07:25.137
And if you're listening for the first time and unaware, this is the voice of Jonathan Cooey.

07:25.177 --> 07:29.419
I'm chief biologist at Gigo Home Biological, coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:31.000 --> 07:44.346
I have a long history of working as an academician, a chasing tenure at various universities and institutions around the world, actually, including in the Netherlands and in Norway and in America.

07:45.250 --> 07:50.233
And you can find the stain of that work on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

07:50.594 --> 08:10.667
You can also find the smell of my more recent work very much diluted and distorted on a substack called Woodhouse 76, run by and written by a group of traders to all of our grandchildren, but especially one in America by the name of Jessica Hockett.

08:10.707 --> 08:14.230
She's working with a couple of foreigners that are associated with the group Panda.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.643
I also used to work for Children's Health Defense.

08:18.683 --> 08:20.205
I thought they were a bunch of heroes.

08:20.265 --> 08:23.929
It turns out that's a sabotaged organization that's run by a bunch of traitors.

08:26.152 --> 08:29.074
And I got to admit, I don't think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

08:29.394 --> 08:33.037
is clever enough, smart enough to have written the Wuhan cover-up book.

08:33.077 --> 08:38.942
Although I did help with a lot of the citations in the text and I did add quite a bit to it.

08:40.183 --> 08:45.587
Enough to rest assured that in history will always be recorded.

08:45.627 --> 08:52.772
For example, the paper between Sina Bavari and Alison Totura of Jeopardy fame.

08:54.955 --> 09:12.232
I met Jay Bhattacharya as a fellow member and attendee of some Broken Science Initiative gatherings as the organization that's now known as Broken Science spearheading the Metfix movement.

09:14.932 --> 09:30.272
Those gatherings were where I met Jay Bhattacharya repeatedly, and at one of those gatherings is actually when I was told by Jay Bhattacharya I should stop mentioning one Robert Malone, a horse breeder and emu farmer from Virginia.

09:31.053 --> 09:34.957
who many people on the internet and in the United States are definitely not aware of.

09:35.918 --> 09:39.541
But everybody who needed to be aware of Robert Malone was definitely aware of him.

09:39.581 --> 09:46.848
And now he's on the ACIP of our Honorable Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

09:47.609 --> 09:49.430
And something smells like bad fish.

09:50.511 --> 09:58.076
If you want to see where I first broke this out you got to go to JC on a bike That's a YouTube channel if you want to see it live right now.

09:58.096 --> 10:00.998
You got to go to JC in the woods That's also a YouTube channel

10:03.390 --> 10:18.482
That was when I first started goofing around here, but this stream that's now on Twitch and on my own PeerTube, stream.gigaom.bio, the way that works is that we have a bunch of people that are giving between $10,000 and $1,000 a month.

10:18.522 --> 10:20.303
There's only a couple people doing that last one.

10:21.204 --> 10:44.471
And as a result that pays the rent and that's how this works other than that You know we scrape by and all the ways that we are scraping by are found by at giga home biological comms if you want to support this work and my family that's where to go and if you want to download the stuff that we talk about you can go to that link stuff which is found in lots of different places on that website but first and foremost at the top corner and bottom corner of the screen

10:45.211 --> 10:47.853
There is a schedule we're gonna start following really soon there.

10:47.893 --> 10:52.817
There's all the links to our channels as well as all the links to the ways that you can support us, including our P.O.

10:52.858 --> 11:04.367
Box in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, where you can send cards or a self-addressed stamped envelope where you can get a Velcro patch or some stickers for your car.

11:06.889 --> 11:10.792
And that would be... Let's see if I can do this right.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.615
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

11:15.635 --> 11:20.102
I don't have a producer or anything like that so the music changes and stuff like that are all me.

11:20.122 --> 11:22.966
You'll hear the mouse click in the background every once in a while because

11:23.706 --> 11:25.247
I'm shifting things around myself.

11:26.107 --> 11:30.108
It's been a long time coming as a one-man band, much like Mark Kulak.

11:30.708 --> 11:38.811
We're just trying to do the best we can with the time that we have while taking care of our families and still trying to maintain some level of normalcy.

11:39.711 --> 11:47.794
And that's also why I start out with the Star Trek bridge a lot, because I do think we're in some kind of alternative timeline here.

11:48.494 --> 12:10.662
And if you think back to how we got here, an alternative timeline where we've just made one crucial, logical, navigational, assumptional error has brought us to a world where all kinds of things don't exist and all kinds of phenomenon are assumed to exist and motivating many millions of people's behavior even though they don't exist.

12:10.742 --> 12:14.023
And that's pretty extraordinary if you think about it.

12:15.103 --> 12:21.266
And the way that that is sustained, unfortunately, is a mythology.

12:21.447 --> 12:29.271
And that mythology was already implanted in us as children in the course of our Biology 101 explorations.

12:30.316 --> 12:37.978
And our biological explorations as a kid inevitably led us to hear about germs and viruses and how viruses are endemic.

12:38.118 --> 12:46.721
And endemicity as both a process, meaning something that can go from a small quantity to being endemic.

12:46.801 --> 12:52.683
And that process of going to endemicity

12:54.333 --> 13:00.720
becoming endemic, it also ends with endemicity, which is an endpoint, right?

13:00.940 --> 13:04.083
And so this is a very big myth.

13:04.143 --> 13:06.826
It's a very powerful biological concept.

13:07.426 --> 13:14.573
And if that concept is false, but assumed to be true, then all kinds of magnificent stories can be told.

13:14.633 --> 13:18.357
And that's more or less where anybody

13:19.875 --> 13:27.679
who was saying in 2020 that there are no viruses, that contagion is probably largely or all a myth.

13:28.519 --> 13:33.902
This is where they should have gotten at least in six years.

13:34.983 --> 13:41.706
And it's extraordinary that literally, actually, none of them have gotten there.

13:44.042 --> 13:45.943
And I need you to really comprehend that.

13:46.143 --> 14:07.592
None of the no virus people, the leaders who have insisted on defining isolation, purification, and culturing of viruses over and over and over again, as a method of trying to tell us that the pandemic is a false narrative, have never managed to move on from there.

14:08.683 --> 14:14.924
and instead have continued to debunk or try to prove a negative over and over and over again.

14:17.225 --> 14:18.885
Because that's what they're essentially doing.

14:20.885 --> 14:23.966
X equals zero, and then they're proving zero all the time.

14:24.086 --> 14:35.568
And those proofs, while many of them are valid, they don't offer an alternative explanation for how it is that so many biologists working in earnest

14:36.778 --> 14:39.520
seem to have been fooled when there is nothing there.

14:40.641 --> 14:44.904
And that is the absolute malevolence of that part of this script.

14:45.804 --> 14:55.571
That after six years, these people with books, some of whom had books 10 years before the pandemic, have never been able to get here.

14:58.618 --> 15:04.645
despite admitting repeatedly at the beginning of the pandemic that there are no coronaviruses, they haven't proven this, but there are.

15:04.665 --> 15:06.728
I mean, bacteriophages, of course they are.

15:07.248 --> 15:09.291
Nobody's arguing there aren't bacteriophages.

15:09.351 --> 15:16.099
So they have not progressed, but instead their lack of progression has revealed

15:17.093 --> 15:22.238
that they are indeed sticking to a limited spectrum of debate, which must have been scripted.

15:22.399 --> 15:33.110
Otherwise, there's no way to explain their incredible accuracy, certainty, and flawless adherence to that.

15:34.209 --> 15:45.477
that script, likely provided by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and other people that we could list because, you know, Craig from the UK was involved in the 100,000 Genomes Project over there.

15:45.897 --> 15:52.162
So there's a lot of people with the requisite expertise and connections to NATO and DITRA and this kind of stuff.

15:52.802 --> 15:56.984
to know that they had to specifically script this out.

15:57.144 --> 16:20.215
They had to make sure that these people had a very solid sphere of bullshit that they could keep people in, that nobody would come anywhere near progressing to the point of being able to accurately debunk virology while still acknowledging what's done in these papers and what is purported to be done in virology as a field.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.405
And that's the magnificence of this.

16:23.465 --> 16:31.369
That's the magnificence of the script because every time I end up making progress, it ends up being like 12 words.

16:33.350 --> 16:46.897
And so you can see why it's so necessary for them to be busy with so many books and so many podcasts and so many different groups of people discussing all of these things when in reality, it's quite easy.

16:49.158 --> 16:50.059
Don't need a lot of books.

16:50.964 --> 16:52.124
You don't need a lot of years.

16:53.065 --> 17:16.574
There's not a lot to learn if there was an irreducibly complex background and they just applied really shitty, absolutely awful excuses for a PCR diagnostic, which would have never passed the muster of any academic institution or academic journal as evidence of anything, even virology before the pandemic.

17:16.614 --> 17:17.295
That's what's so...

17:19.278 --> 17:20.859
That's what's so sad about it.

17:21.559 --> 17:32.445
And then we have all these pharmaceutical or retired pharmaceutical executives in our dissident movement telling us nothing about the fact that placebos would be the easiest, most foolproof way to pull this off.

17:33.005 --> 17:36.407
Instead, they spent five years telling us that the doses are different.

17:39.548 --> 17:44.451
And now they're going to spend another three years telling us that the doses were contaminated.

17:46.687 --> 18:00.359
And all the while, none of these people who are ignoring the opioid murders in America, none of these people are questioning the use of PCR as a test, as a diagnostic, because it's still going on now.

18:01.159 --> 18:08.426
Mary Talley Bowden has a PCR test in 2021 already that tested for 17 different viral markers.

18:12.495 --> 18:21.598
Every one of these people is scripted never to question the PCR, never to question virology, never to question transfection or even call it by name.

18:23.439 --> 18:29.761
And we have been convinced that we are Ghostbusters, that the ghosts are real and that these guys are heroes.

18:29.821 --> 18:36.523
And that's the trap that all of these people in the Trump movement, all of these people in the health freedom movement, that's the trap that they're in.

18:40.185 --> 18:52.680
And what they don't understand and what no one will ever tell them is that that trap was sprung at a specific time to be timed with a specific thing and that is this little bump in the population pyramid.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.844
See how different it is, how the slope

18:58.297 --> 18:59.798
See how the slope is different here?

19:00.298 --> 19:03.622
These bars are pretty stable right now, these old people up here.

19:03.662 --> 19:05.003
These bars are real stable.

19:05.643 --> 19:08.646
But in a few years, they're going to start to expand very fast.

19:08.706 --> 19:22.920
And that is a crisis for our socioeconomic infrastructure, where the availability of health care has been limited to exactly the amount we need available in order to tend to the population and not many more.

19:27.352 --> 19:35.296
Ladies and gentlemen, there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and lies, and it was timed perfectly.

19:35.976 --> 19:44.740
And the timing does not depend on the background because the background in my model is constant and irreducibly complex.

19:46.260 --> 19:51.663
You know, like if you needed words and you had a library, I guess you can find some words in there.

19:53.117 --> 20:02.026
And so it's not like you went into an empty warehouse and found a book laying on the floor and then came back a few years later and that book was in all the libraries in the world.

20:02.046 --> 20:02.086
No.

20:04.148 --> 20:10.475
You're already in a world with libraries that all have a lot of the same books in them.

20:10.515 --> 20:15.220
And so if you find a book in a library in Pittsburgh and say, wow, this is a novel book.

20:16.206 --> 20:16.986
This is a new one.

20:17.826 --> 20:22.647
Look, it's everywhere now, but you don't, what do you mean it's everywhere now?

20:22.667 --> 20:24.168
It was already everywhere now.

20:25.248 --> 20:31.489
The only reason why you could claim that is if everybody was both unaware of the libraries and also unaware of their contents.

20:34.310 --> 20:41.051
And that sounds like a pretty good description for what you and I and everybody knew about the population pyramid before the pandemic.

20:42.074 --> 20:54.118
and what we knew about the irreducibly complex background that people like Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak had been making a living pointing to in PowerPoint presentations.

20:57.919 --> 21:02.560
And so the point is, is that that's why we have an anti-vax movement that is fake in America.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.621
And that's a bold statement to make.

21:05.888 --> 21:18.820
When most people on the Trump side are convinced that the anti-vax movement, the health freedom movement, is what got Trump into the office, and what has resulted is a very successful placement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.002
at the head of Health and Human Services.

21:24.265 --> 21:25.486
And that's really terrible.

21:28.629 --> 21:39.273
Because that guy also seems to be woefully unaware that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that needed to be addressed somehow, even if it was just a lot more money and care.

21:43.075 --> 21:43.815
Or euthanasia.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.897
But of course, euthanasia is a word that implies informed consent.

21:47.977 --> 21:55.560
So calling people in COVID intentionally euthanized by hospitals is still not using the right language.

21:56.533 --> 22:13.687
And that's how you can know at this point that all of these people, all of them, even Joe Rogan is either an idiot or on script because if somebody says intentional euthanasia, if you are a proficient English speaker, you should be like, dude, what do you, what does that even mean?

22:14.627 --> 22:17.870
Is that like military intelligence or jumbo shrimp?

22:18.350 --> 22:19.932
Like, what does that mean to you?

22:20.942 --> 22:23.024
intentional euthanasia.

22:23.704 --> 22:29.609
What kind of shithead says those two words together on Joe Rogan, other than a scripted shithead?

22:31.551 --> 22:32.932
You see, she's a nurse.

22:34.713 --> 22:36.275
I don't even know if she's a doctor.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.097
Like, what is going on?

22:40.518 --> 22:41.319
No, she's a doctor.

22:42.980 --> 22:49.666
But what is going on when people like, after six years have gotten nowhere?

22:51.522 --> 22:56.266
unless they were given a script and told if you stick to it, everything is going to be great.

22:56.686 --> 22:59.749
And eventually it'll pay off.

23:00.890 --> 23:02.271
Our man will be in the white house.

23:02.491 --> 23:07.476
You're going to get a position, your business of whatever they told these people, ladies and gentlemen.

23:09.998 --> 23:16.303
And yesterday I was talking about the opioid crisis and trying to put together a timeline.

23:16.343 --> 23:18.045
Like I've tried to work with everything else.

23:19.516 --> 23:28.042
It is sometimes the only way to try and process something is to put it into a longer time horizon context.

23:29.323 --> 23:32.565
You can't put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

23:32.525 --> 23:47.556
's speeches in October of 2020 in front of people and then not realize that since that time that he spoke in Germany, his understanding of and his rhetoric about the pandemic didn't change at all.

23:50.103 --> 23:58.849
And if you just see the speech in Germany in October of 2020 alone by itself, it'll seem like, wow, he was way ahead of his, he was way ahead of this.

24:02.892 --> 24:14.680
And so I think more important than ever, everybody's homework is always to make sure that before you send something forward to your family and friends, before you share something, you try to put it into context.

24:17.697 --> 24:34.831
And so I think... Now, what we do have evidence for are these... We have right now in 2025, a guy who I will declare a traitor to Americans' grandkids, one of the worst Americans alive, is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now running a beard.

24:36.873 --> 24:42.097
And he has been curating this narrative about the RNA and the dangers of it since 2020.

24:42.518 --> 24:46.361
The skepticism of the FDA and PCR

24:47.805 --> 24:50.428
methodology specifics since 2020.

24:52.250 --> 24:58.116
And that is because he's one of these narrative coordinators that knows enough about everything that he can do it.

24:58.957 --> 25:04.482
Maybe only Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone are the other people who know that much in order to be able to do it.

25:05.163 --> 25:08.426
Because they've been following the narrative for so long.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.949
They've been a part of laying it down for so long.

25:12.406 --> 25:29.775
Again, Robert Malone's connections go all the way back to Robert Gallo and Murray Gardner and Inder Verma and all of these people who can be shown to be connected to a more than 20-year movement to pivot and make available the U.S.

25:29.835 --> 25:35.998
population and maybe the populations of most of Western society for the Human Genome Project.

25:37.560 --> 25:57.049
and a question of who is going to control that data, who is going to have the infrastructure and the tools necessary to process it, because at that time, 20 years ago, none of this existed, none of the idea existed, but none of the infrastructure, the collection, sort of pipeline, the remnant stream didn't exist.

25:57.849 --> 26:00.070
And they wouldn't have been able to use it 20 years ago.

26:01.425 --> 26:11.027
Because the technology to sequence with high enough fidelity and quick enough, and then the technology and availability to store the data would never have been developed.

26:11.107 --> 26:14.667
But now, of course, we've optimized all that, right?

26:14.907 --> 26:29.590
YouTube can serve up videos all around the world as quick as a snap, which means that now they have the infrastructure ready to serve up genomes and serve up medical data at a snap to a machine learning algorithm.

26:31.325 --> 26:42.738
I mean, you didn't think that they were optimizing this sort of data serving infrastructure in order to make videos more and more available to everybody faster and faster and faster, did you?

26:44.020 --> 26:51.509
You didn't think that they were floating servers in big container ships in order to provide more storage space for creators, did you?

26:54.778 --> 27:02.501
So this guy is involved because this is part of the largest, most expensive project in human history, the Human Genome Project.

27:02.861 --> 27:20.968
It's basically a project that's so big and so scary in terms of its potential that they can use it to influence and maybe even bend the will of many, many people around the world, many, many institutions, many, many banks, many, many everybody.

27:21.960 --> 27:32.325
The right people, speaking in the right way, at the right table, with the right lighting, can convince anybody of anything, especially if they were all given a lanyard before they went through and then scanned for weapons.

27:35.026 --> 27:39.608
And I can almost guarantee you that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan have given briefings like that.

27:40.829 --> 27:42.710
Maybe on boats off the coast of Turkey.

27:45.816 --> 27:58.261
And so we also have more, let's say, mundane clowns in the show that don't really know what's going on, don't have the sophistication to know what's going on, but clearly must be traitors.

27:59.321 --> 28:09.165
He can't be from Scotland and not be fighting for the justice for all these dead people in Scotland that were murdered.

28:10.114 --> 28:13.615
You just can't be, that has to be the first thing on your lips.

28:13.695 --> 28:22.337
Just like with Mark Kulak, the first thing on his lips, almost one of three things is gonna come out.

28:22.377 --> 28:23.978
It's gonna be the opioid crisis.

28:24.018 --> 28:29.019
The idea that half a million Americans were killed in five years and nobody gives a shit.

28:29.079 --> 28:33.600
But more importantly, it provides the perfect math for the COVID lie.

28:36.260 --> 28:37.961
And so yeah, Mark's focused on that.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.781
Mark's got a reason to focus on that.

28:39.841 --> 28:55.688
And this shithead is from a place where there's a pretty easy thing to focus on because unlike Mark, who's from a country of 350 million people and a whole bunch of shit to focus on, this guy's from Scotland where everything was pretty fine until, well, immigration and COVID.

28:57.105 --> 29:12.812
And there are substacks, particularly the one that I plug every time, the Beale phenomenon thing, that substack should be promoted by this guy at least once a week and he's never touched it because he's a shithead on Robert Malone's script.

29:13.513 --> 29:18.375
And that's clear here in this discussion between these two morons.

29:20.478 --> 29:22.920
scripted morons, scripted bullshitters.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.601
And so being here is quite frightening.

29:26.062 --> 29:30.304
One of the things that I think we're missing is that the CDC is off everyone's radar.

29:30.905 --> 29:32.506
No one's talking about it at all.

29:32.546 --> 29:47.115
We've been fighting about the Surgeon General, and we've been fighting about who's on Rogan, and we've been talking about, I don't know, Dyes, and there's nothing happening.

29:47.975 --> 29:48.836
Nothing happening.

29:51.018 --> 29:53.520
And yet the CDC has a DARPA lady at its head.

29:53.700 --> 29:57.923
And if we do a little timeline for the CDC, it's actually kind of damning.

29:59.104 --> 30:12.953
Because in 2016, the CDC changed the way that doctors are recommended to prescribe opioids after a many, many, many years of allowing doctors to prescribe opioids.

30:15.255 --> 30:19.498
Allowing it for many, many years for these pills to leak out of pharmacies.

30:21.124 --> 30:27.410
to allow people to keep a prescription going that they themselves weren't using, but somebody else in their family was using.

30:29.632 --> 30:30.312
Or to sell them.

30:32.074 --> 30:36.999
And the penalties for this, the monitoring of this, the attention to this was nil.

30:38.620 --> 30:43.404
And then the CDC started to see people were overdosing on these pills.

30:44.110 --> 30:50.612
that were being produced in mass quantities and being available everywhere and prescriptions that weren't being controlled.

30:50.672 --> 30:52.212
And so they said, wow, there's a problem.

30:53.312 --> 30:55.113
We're gonna have to crack down on the problem.

30:55.513 --> 31:09.936
And they keep using the word opioids in a big umbrella term that can describe everything from heroin, that can only be produced by poppies, all the way to fentanyl, which can only be produced by pharmaceutical processes.

31:11.812 --> 31:23.258
So we have this, this illusion, this mythology of irresponsible Americans and drug addicted Americans and, and shitty doctors, I guess, or not.

31:23.438 --> 31:33.704
I mean, at some point, the thing you have to realize is, is that simultaneously with this recommendation, they change the penalties for doctors and for pharmacists.

31:35.025 --> 31:35.625
And they told them.

31:37.366 --> 31:45.712
They told them that they are now going to consider it a crime to give opioids to people who don't need them, and you can't need opioids forever.

31:48.815 --> 31:55.780
And so they created a bunch of adults, they used them, and then they put them on the street.

31:58.642 --> 32:00.444
They put them in weed dispensaries.

32:01.377 --> 32:14.108
They put them in methadone clinics, anywhere where there's a form of pain medication that's good enough to match or could possibly match that of the opioid prescription that they were on, maybe that they were using.

32:14.788 --> 32:23.756
The thing about this that's most striking to me is that anybody who knows the history of science understands that in the early history of surgery, almost all these doctors were addicts.

32:26.457 --> 32:36.767
One of the greatest surgeons in American history was a cocaine addict and lost his license in one state and worked at Johns Hopkins forever after that.

32:37.508 --> 32:41.772
Made lots and lots of contributions to what we understand as surgery.

32:42.313 --> 32:46.837
As a coke and meth addict, or a morphine addict, I think he was just a heroin addict.

32:49.113 --> 32:55.638
And there are lots of probably in the world functioning heroin addicts, because it's possible to be a functioning heroin addict.

32:56.158 --> 32:59.420
Cocaine addict is not so functional.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.741
You're not really that cool.

33:00.801 --> 33:09.888
But heroin is actually a drug, as I understand it, that can be responsibly used for a very, very long time successfully.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.751
And indeed, that was being done.

33:14.702 --> 33:19.144
in the early history of surgery, because they tested it on themselves.

33:20.944 --> 33:24.826
In case that's not really, you know, that's how this was done.

33:25.586 --> 33:33.989
So the the concept, what we understood of this, right, the opioid wars that they just, that's what Hong Kong is.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.643
And that's what Afghanistan was.

33:37.883 --> 33:50.408
And so all of this stuff is tied together because then in 2018, of course, they have Donald Trump bragging about how he's cutting opioid prescriptions by one third over the next three years.

33:50.888 --> 34:03.474
Prescriptions, that's presumably doctors and patients agreeing that this might be the solution, but he's gonna cut back on those by one third and he's gonna step up prosecutions of doctors who prescribe them inappropriately.

34:04.289 --> 34:12.876
Again, creating an alternative market because biologically speaking, people that have used opioids for a couple years don't have an alternative.

34:12.916 --> 34:15.358
They can't just go cold turkey for a little while.

34:17.821 --> 34:26.027
I mean, maybe there are people who can, but the vast majority of people don't have the biology necessary to be able to do that successfully very often.

34:26.808 --> 34:33.554
And that's not their fault, especially if they've been using commercial grade opioids for cry many sakes.

34:35.626 --> 34:40.049
And so this is pre-pandemic, then post-pandemic in 2022.

34:40.970 --> 34:43.632
It seems we might need some corrective measures.

34:43.692 --> 34:54.300
The CDC might need some corrective measures after 2019, 20, 21 numbers being record and 22 is gonna be even higher.

34:54.940 --> 34:58.043
Maybe we need some corrective guidelines for opioids.

35:01.664 --> 35:10.469
Does this sound any different than, well, you know, we, we, there was a problem in 2020, a crisis of a coronavirus, but we responded like shit.

35:11.830 --> 35:19.734
Does that sound anything different than we gave guidelines and we changed the laws and oops, the opioid crackdown is backfiring.

35:26.378 --> 35:30.901
And so they set up America so that they were able

35:32.025 --> 35:38.833
to sculpt the murder, you know, use this, they sculpted it very specifically.

35:38.873 --> 35:46.481
And in order to do that, they needed to create that street market, that street demand, that illegal demand for pills.

35:47.608 --> 35:49.570
call it a problem.

35:49.630 --> 35:54.375
We didn't realize that all these pills in pharmacies would be so valuable.

35:54.755 --> 35:58.879
We didn't know that people with these prescriptions could sell the pills.

35:58.919 --> 35:59.600
That's crazy.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.081
Wow, we didn't know that...

36:05.683 --> 36:08.145
And so, you know, you gotta think.

36:08.665 --> 36:11.548
They closed Alcoholics Anonymous at the beginning of the pandemic.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.749
They closed churches at the beginning of the pandemic.

36:13.809 --> 36:19.053
Recovery groups were not allowed to meet, but dispensaries and methadone clinics were still open.

36:22.796 --> 36:26.839
It's almost like a perfect storm to screw all these people over.

36:27.620 --> 36:32.984
You know, these middle-aged to young Americans and their families just ruin them.

36:34.545 --> 36:35.346
Tough shit, right?

36:40.211 --> 36:43.015
It's frustrating to me, ladies and gentlemen, because we are there.

36:43.716 --> 36:55.073
We are at the stage where, you know, people like Nick Hudson will admit it, you know, is regarded by a few people as by some people as sort of this kind of

36:56.727 --> 36:58.168
savant or idiot or something.

36:58.228 --> 37:00.129
Savant or idiot.

37:00.189 --> 37:05.392
Ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt and in many ways they are.

37:05.693 --> 37:07.974
No, and that's the, in many ways they are.

37:07.994 --> 37:16.299
Now notice you can say my name just like Heather Haying said my name or Brett Weinstein says my name, but actually I don't want you to say my name.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.703
What I want you to do is teach this very simple biology that only takes about 20 words.

37:23.356 --> 37:26.717
and only requires three word sentences.

37:30.058 --> 37:34.380
That's what I want because that's what will save our grandkids.

37:34.420 --> 37:50.005
That was what will save the grandkids of earth is for them to reset their biological understanding of themselves and reset some of the parameters of the biological model of the world that they currently have in their head because that model is broken.

37:51.454 --> 37:54.236
And saying my name doesn't do anything for that.

37:55.757 --> 38:05.223
Saying that COVID doesn't exist or there are no viruses doesn't do anything for that because we must give our children an alternative model of the world that works.

38:11.286 --> 38:14.748
And this team of performers with costumes and effects, they're not gonna do that.

38:14.829 --> 38:18.511
They're being paid to lie about why people died.

38:19.679 --> 38:26.943
All of these people are being paid fame and fortune in order to lie about why people died.

38:27.744 --> 38:28.164
That's it.

38:28.825 --> 38:30.165
That's how simple it is.

38:30.345 --> 38:32.547
It's murder and it's lies.

38:34.483 --> 38:37.705
The FDA has led the world in advancing medical cures.

38:38.406 --> 38:41.768
But in recent years, that leader status has been in jeopardy.

38:42.508 --> 38:44.490
The FDA must modernize.

38:45.050 --> 38:48.893
So today I'm announcing a brand new program that seeks to do just that.

38:49.493 --> 38:53.296
It's called the Commissioner's National Priority Review Voucher Program.

38:54.096 --> 39:03.843
Through this pilot, companies will receive a decision within a month or two, as opposed to the typical 10 to 12 months for an NDA or BLA-8 final application.

39:05.023 --> 39:14.607
At the core of this program is the ability of companies to pre-submit their application packet with essentially everything except the final clinical trial results.

39:15.568 --> 39:24.011
This program will also tackle one of the most common pain points drug developers voiced during a recent listening tour my team took.

39:24.932 --> 39:27.933
The difficulty of getting a quick question answered.

39:28.942 --> 39:34.604
A 15-minute discussion with the FDA can sometimes save drug developers months of guesswork.

39:34.624 --> 39:43.306
And so what he's basically announcing is what Mark and I more or less predicted was that somehow or another the FDA was going to be undermined or destroyed.

39:43.566 --> 39:47.267
And they were using language like burn it down to the studs and this kind of thing.

39:48.547 --> 39:50.428
But in reality, that's not required.

39:51.710 --> 40:09.805
In reality, you just have to put a stooge at the FDA who's gonna do whatever they're told, or hire an assistant that will do whatever they're told, and then the front-facing version of the FDA is now a bunch of foreign meddlers who are gonna do podcasts and read scripts in front of a camera.

40:10.445 --> 40:13.648
Not that dissimilar how Peter Marks did it during the pandemic.

40:14.249 --> 40:15.670
These are also just stooges.

40:15.710 --> 40:20.334
They are nothing more than the mouse in the mouse suit at Chuck E. Cheese's.

40:21.403 --> 40:28.269
And he is just telling you as you come into the restaurant that we're not going to require actually trial data anymore.

40:28.329 --> 40:39.339
We're just going to require them to fill out the application and give us a plausible mechanism by which they think it works and an estimate what they think their experimental data will reveal.

40:40.100 --> 40:45.905
And we'll fast forward that application so that they can go on and start marketing their product

40:46.565 --> 40:51.687
in anticipation of the results of their experimental study and eventual approval.

40:53.288 --> 40:59.751
This work, which is why companies in this new program will get more frequent communications.

41:01.383 --> 41:03.504
So who can get a National Priority Voucher?

41:04.344 --> 41:05.365
The key is in the name.

41:05.685 --> 41:07.706
The program will support U.S.

41:07.766 --> 41:11.907
drug developers who are addressing our most important U.S.

41:11.987 --> 41:23.932
national priorities, such as domestic manufacturing as a national security issue, addressing an unmet public health need, or supporting pandemic preparedness.

41:25.290 --> 41:32.037
It's worth noting that this new program is different from previous voucher programs and does not replace them.

41:33.819 --> 41:38.664
The previous voucher programs, as far as I can tell, would be something like the EUA vouchers.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.968
The EUA vouchers are also the same kind of thing.

41:42.028 --> 41:43.309
Here's an approval for now.

41:43.369 --> 41:44.130
It's temporary.

41:44.831 --> 41:47.313
And then it's temporary hinged on a bunch of things.

41:49.266 --> 42:02.392
And so he's using these code words that only people who understand them, you know, like Kevin McKernan or somebody like Robert Malone, who's sat on all these committees for so long, would really understand.

42:02.432 --> 42:10.957
The American public doesn't understand that when he says voucher, that's like a code word that means a bunch of different things.

42:11.744 --> 42:22.070
As a surgical oncologist, I'd often participate in tumor boards with a team of experts to consider hard questions in light of all the latest clinical evidence.

42:23.090 --> 42:30.855
Similarly, the National Priority Review Program will use a multidisciplinary team of experts for a team-based approach.

42:32.261 --> 42:36.845
We'll have more details as well as an application process coming out soon.

42:37.986 --> 42:43.550
In order to modernize the FDA, we have to keep innovating our regulatory processes.

42:44.351 --> 42:47.173
This new program is one step closer to doing that.

42:49.155 --> 42:58.483
Now remember the FDA's main objective or let's say mandate is to, it started out regulating the label.

42:59.594 --> 43:07.980
Essentially what's on the label should be in the bottle Claims made on the label should be Verified claims.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.982
Otherwise, they shouldn't be able to be on the bottle.

43:10.743 --> 43:20.850
That's what the FDA does Now or that's why the FDA originally existed let's say it like that another reason

43:22.438 --> 43:42.390
Well, anyway, I don't want to talk about that now, but it appears to be that phage therapy actually was also part of the motivation for modernizing the FDA back in the 50s and 60s because phage therapy in America wasn't working as well as it was purported to work in Soviet Union and in Germany and other places.

43:43.050 --> 43:43.691
and in France.

43:45.091 --> 43:57.700
So that's an interesting part of this history that I bet a lot of you don't know that I'm really again trying to organize and verify and double check before I start rolling out as part of our Biology 101, the new version.

43:59.120 --> 44:00.201
of Giggo and Biological.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.421
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

44:01.942 --> 44:03.602
I think it's going to be very eye-opening.

44:04.863 --> 44:20.729
Now, don't be disappointed because actually this very same ridiculous pitch was also put out on a half-an-hour three-man podcast, the one that I now have become just... it's awful.

44:21.369 --> 44:27.472
I'm going to... I had it muted, but I'm going to put the sound on for a minute or two just so you can hear

44:28.766 --> 44:29.347
What it is.

44:29.367 --> 44:30.109
There we go.

44:31.151 --> 44:32.152
What it is they're doing.

44:32.854 --> 44:34.296
Because again, it's the same thing.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.999
They're going to sit down and talk.

44:38.686 --> 44:49.553
And when they sit down and talk, he's going to sit down and talk with this, uh, Jane Paul and, and, uh, McCary and, and McCary and, and, and was in a Vinay and listened to Vinay.

44:49.613 --> 44:49.813
I know.

44:49.853 --> 44:50.994
I haven't really seen the two of you.

44:51.014 --> 44:52.055
We've all been in different places.

44:52.075 --> 44:52.155
Yeah.

44:52.675 --> 44:55.898
I had the bio conference yesterday or the day before.

44:56.258 --> 44:59.700
We've been to Stanford, uh, San Diego, Boston.

44:59.740 --> 45:01.841
We've been doing our CEO listening tour.

45:01.861 --> 45:06.905
Uh, we've now done four places, including the FDA, and we have heard a ton of things.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.086
Um, so many.

45:08.986 --> 45:29.871
Think consistent themes across all the things but also at every single forum we go to we hear new ideas So you see that we could do a better job and it's been a really productive listening experience And so they've been going around the United States on first-class flights Listening to CEOs and the CEOs have had private meetings with them where they can tell them how they can make the FDA better for them and

45:30.391 --> 45:33.253
And of course, that's where this new voucher program comes from.

45:33.293 --> 45:36.775
And so in this video, he's going to tell you all about the voucher program.

45:36.815 --> 45:37.676
They will share.

45:37.776 --> 45:38.516
And so they did.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.438
And, you know, we took a little heat.

45:40.458 --> 45:43.760
I knew this was going to happen because we did it as a closed door meeting.

45:44.620 --> 45:45.100
We might have had.

45:46.622 --> 45:52.587
70 to 120 people, depending on the city, in the room for it being closed door.

45:53.088 --> 45:56.070
And people, we all believe in radical transparency.

45:56.971 --> 46:03.557
But if you want someone to be honest and genuine in sharing their ideas, you have to create a safe space for them.

46:04.038 --> 46:11.044
And since we were not answering questions, we were not giving talks, we were not sharing new information from the FDA, we were listening.

46:12.385 --> 46:23.669
It was amazing how many people told us, when they don't have to worry about their shareholders and their employees and investors and everybody else, how they just felt comfortable giving ideas, and they gave us a lot of ideas.

46:23.729 --> 46:32.833
Yeah, and we can be transparent in what we're thinking and what we're going to do at FDA, but it's really not our role to force companies for telling their deepest, darkest secrets to the whole world.

46:33.233 --> 46:40.416
And in fact, by doing it behind closed doors, and again, we're just listening to what they're saying and writing notes and kind of saying back to them what we hear them saying,

46:41.416 --> 46:45.017
Can anybody tell me what that dual flag is there?

46:45.057 --> 46:46.078
Because it's a blue.

46:47.178 --> 46:49.059
It's a blue flag here.

46:49.099 --> 46:50.959
I don't know what this blue flag is.

46:51.119 --> 46:53.740
It's really not blue and something.

46:53.780 --> 46:57.641
It's not like a Nevada flag or a Wisconsin flag or even a Navy flag.

46:58.181 --> 46:59.142
It's all blue.

46:59.322 --> 47:02.523
I don't know if there's a ring of yellow stars there or not.

47:03.533 --> 47:06.696
I can't really see it, and I'm gonna show you a couple pictures afterward.

47:06.716 --> 47:10.219
I tried to take some snaps, and I couldn't see anything in the blue.

47:10.980 --> 47:13.222
It's not purple to me, but it could be purple, I guess.

47:13.462 --> 47:14.262
It looks blue to me.

47:16.223 --> 47:16.543
Anyway.

47:16.843 --> 47:28.467
He learned a lot, and they talked about sort of frustrations they may face in all directions from- Let me just make sure I point out what's happening here, because this grift has a very specific biological aspect to it that you may not be aware of.

47:29.147 --> 47:36.509
But Marty McCary is a surgeon, but he's very specifically a oncologist.

47:37.009 --> 47:41.190
So as a surgeon, he was cutting shit out, cutting cancer out.

47:42.176 --> 47:46.660
He's not an orthopedic surgeon who worked on people's, you know, ACLs.

47:48.502 --> 47:51.565
This is a cancer doctor.

47:52.486 --> 47:56.510
And that guy is also a cancer doctor.

47:57.711 --> 48:00.314
Worked for the National Cancer Institute.

48:00.354 --> 48:04.718
You know where, I think, actually, Lee Minyan's

48:06.644 --> 48:13.888
mother and father-in-law worked at the National Cancer Institute, which is again, one of these very big biological myths.

48:13.968 --> 48:25.233
Not that cancer doesn't exist, but the idea that there's gonna be some genetic or viral cause to cancer that you can chase down with NIH grants, because that's not how this works.

48:25.734 --> 48:32.437
And certainly that's not a genuinely honest way of pursuing the cures for cancer.

48:32.477 --> 48:33.898
Instead, that's an excuse

48:35.120 --> 48:44.248
throw billions of dollars at the cure for cancer by blaming it on genes and viruses, and so you have an excuse to look for molecular signals and investigate molecular explanations.

48:45.649 --> 48:52.955
And so what is so malevolent about these two working together is that they are already, from a professional perspective, very

48:54.935 --> 49:10.402
very fluent in the language of cancer trials and cancer therapies and cancer immunology and cancer hypotheses and failed cancer ideas and so there's a whole

49:11.755 --> 49:27.457
a Baskin-Robbins of vocabulary that these two guys can bounce off of each other, you know, like they're, if you've never played squash before and then you walked into a squash court and tried to catch the ball, two people that were playing squash could make you look like a clown.

49:28.592 --> 49:43.698
The ball goes too fast and it moves in a way that if you're not aware that the squash ball warms up and as it warms up it moves faster and bounces faster and all this other shit, then squash is gonna be really like, even if you played racquetball, squash would be bizarre for you.

49:44.878 --> 49:52.361
And so if you're just a biologist but not specialized in cancer, then these guys are gonna make you feel very humble.

49:53.171 --> 50:04.825
And they're going to be able to very easily together create the illusion that these guys have a whole expertise that just makes you look like an amateur golfer and these guys look like they have three green jackets.

50:06.906 --> 50:13.287
you know, how they get their funding, the challenges they face with running their operation, and how FDA has made things easier and harder.

50:13.547 --> 50:15.268
And that's the other thing, we all got a lot of praise, too.

50:15.288 --> 50:19.329
You know, one person spoke about how the FDA's also doing a good job, let's not forget.

50:19.969 --> 50:20.909
But there are ways we could do better.

50:20.969 --> 50:21.869
Thanks for throwing that in.

50:21.949 --> 50:27.090
Yeah, I think it's to the listening point, though, I think it's worth sharing the format in which you did it, right?

50:27.210 --> 50:33.992
You guys were truly listening, because each attendee had, what, it was about two minutes, and they were on the clock, and they could just openly share what they wanted to say.

50:34.012 --> 50:35.432
It's a good thing we were listening, because my voice was shot.

50:36.052 --> 50:37.354
I think you're still recovering.

50:37.374 --> 50:37.654
Yeah.

50:37.714 --> 50:39.135
He's had a rough voice for this last week.

50:39.335 --> 50:41.778
But yeah, like a couple of the forms.

50:41.798 --> 50:43.439
Ah, HHS department flag.

50:43.479 --> 50:45.061
If that's the case, good catch.

50:45.141 --> 50:46.082
Thank you very much.

50:46.182 --> 50:47.523
I won't make a big deal about it.

50:47.563 --> 50:47.943
Thank you.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.626
If you can send up a, send a link, that would be great.

50:50.666 --> 50:52.548
I'm not going to speed it up because I'm not going to leave it and go very long.

50:52.568 --> 50:56.291
Literally every single person took a microphone and spoke from one to two minutes in the forms.

50:56.471 --> 50:59.994
More importantly, what you need to see is that this is an associate director

51:00.655 --> 51:26.496
This is the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and that is the the head of the whole FDA and they collectively have decided that a significant portion of their salary and of course other people's time because they have an editor and a film maybe the guy who films it is the same guy who does the editing but there might even be more than one person that's holding a camera

51:27.304 --> 51:37.288
that's running the sound, and then another person that's gonna edit this down and put it on YouTube, make the cuts to camera A or camera B, that's not all done live.

51:39.129 --> 51:41.570
And even if it is, then somebody's gotta be doing that too.

51:44.691 --> 51:53.335
So we are talking about three salaries, three administrators, bureaucrats, if you will,

51:54.554 --> 51:55.295
Devoting now.

51:55.335 --> 52:18.636
This is this is podcast number nine It also gets put up as an audio file and also as a podcast and also, you know Twitter they do this live on Twitter on X It's remarkable ladies and gentlemen if a government administrator or a group of them is regularly doing podcasts on X and

52:20.506 --> 52:24.309
That's in a way giving X government money, isn't it?

52:24.369 --> 52:26.730
Or giving something that belongs to the government.

52:26.771 --> 52:30.914
Why isn't the government just having a website where they stream the FDA show?

52:32.234 --> 52:35.417
And then maybe posting it on YouTube is possible, I guess.

52:35.497 --> 52:44.643
But the idea of going live on X with these things is, you know, first premiering them on X. That's unacceptable.

52:45.864 --> 52:49.467
Unless you are accepting the fact that the

52:50.885 --> 52:57.506
the governance of the American population is now being done or manipulated on social media, willingly.

52:57.586 --> 52:59.347
They're actually just doing it.

53:00.307 --> 53:04.588
And the Democrats and the Republicans, you know, the good guys and the bad guys, they're all doing it.

53:04.628 --> 53:11.829
They all have acquiesced to this as being the inevitable future governance of society.

53:12.169 --> 53:13.950
That this is the new media.

53:15.410 --> 53:17.550
That new media is code for that.

53:17.771 --> 53:19.791
It's the new control mechanism.

53:21.223 --> 53:37.340
These people auditioned for five years on that new control medium, and their demonstration that they could herd cats successfully on that medium is what made them qualified to be put here, and specifically put here together.

53:38.902 --> 53:39.823
Thanks, ZDogg!

53:43.353 --> 53:46.056
It was just so big, we took a line and just let people go.

53:46.837 --> 53:51.962
But again, the whole thing was just letting people talk about frustrations they face.

53:52.242 --> 53:53.684
And of course, there's some themes that come across.

53:53.744 --> 53:55.586
I'm going to let the computer rest here for a second.

53:55.606 --> 53:56.447
I think it's a bit of a crashy crash.

53:56.467 --> 53:58.769
Yeah, I had some fun with it because I didn't get to join the last few.

53:58.809 --> 54:01.472
So were there a couple of highlights of new themes you were hearing?

54:02.563 --> 54:05.104
people talk about the frustrations they face.

54:05.384 --> 54:09.186
And of course, you know, there's certain themes that come across it that we'd be happy to talk about.

54:09.606 --> 54:11.908
Yeah, I had some FOMO because I didn't get to join the last few.

54:11.968 --> 54:14.609
So were there a couple of highlights of new themes you were hearing?

54:15.560 --> 54:20.684
It's like a third of the feedback was a common theme in all the sessions.

54:21.245 --> 54:25.408
And I'd say two thirds was unique and very different.

54:25.468 --> 54:27.270
And they were very specific.

54:27.410 --> 54:30.753
So many details, so much information here available.

54:30.813 --> 54:35.316
It's kind of hard to not see the radical transparency that's here.

54:35.337 --> 54:36.698
I mean, this is really radical.

54:39.013 --> 54:39.873
Oh, wait, is that the wrong?

54:40.034 --> 54:40.694
Oh, yes, it is.

54:41.254 --> 54:42.075
That's the wrong.

54:42.795 --> 54:44.416
It's radical transparency.

54:44.476 --> 54:46.737
It is radical, radical transparency.

54:47.737 --> 54:49.899
Civic ideas that were formative for us.

54:49.939 --> 54:55.201
These are things we can implement and act on or run by our own staff.

54:55.241 --> 55:00.304
So for example, we were just talking about the value of creating a safe space for someone to share their ideas.

55:00.924 --> 55:01.825
That's how we're doing it here.

55:01.865 --> 55:05.967
We will meet with physicians, scientists, reviewers, core staff at the agency.

55:06.687 --> 55:09.148
And we ask them, you know, what ideas do you have?

55:09.188 --> 55:10.609
How could things be done bigger?

55:10.649 --> 55:14.010
Has there been... Okay, so that's the flag.

55:14.070 --> 55:16.572
If you say that that's HHS, I'll believe you.

55:16.612 --> 55:18.292
I know it's not the Freemason flag.

55:18.332 --> 55:20.774
I know it's not the UN and I know it's not Nevada.

55:20.834 --> 55:21.694
What do I got back here?

55:21.714 --> 55:22.815
I think it's the Navy flag.

55:22.835 --> 55:23.855
It's not the Navy either.

55:23.875 --> 55:26.316
If it's HHS, I'm fine with that.

55:26.896 --> 55:27.577
I hope it is.

55:28.637 --> 55:32.579
If you can put a link in there somewhere where you found that, that would be awesome.

55:32.839 --> 55:34.080
I don't really care though.

55:34.764 --> 55:36.385
What a game it was for Woo-Pig-Suey.

55:36.405 --> 55:38.585
What a game it was for Gage Wood of Shoahill.

55:38.685 --> 55:39.505
Gage Wood.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.746
I don't know if you heard of Gage Wood, a pitcher from Arkansas.

55:42.807 --> 55:53.790
I don't know the timing of the College World Series is like last week or the week before which doesn't really make sense to me because I'm not a baseball player anymore and so I don't know how this college stuff works.

55:54.370 --> 56:17.892
Anyway, I'm told that this just recently happened and it makes me feel really good to see a kid succeed and The videos that I originally saw made it seem like this was gonna be like a real big-headed cocky kid and then this this this interview on SportsCenter reveals him to be a real humble badass and

56:18.132 --> 56:24.675
young man and I'm very, very proud to be an American and this guy playing an American sport like baseball so well.

56:24.715 --> 56:25.135
Watch this.

56:27.096 --> 56:28.637
We'll get you set for the NBA Finals.

56:28.697 --> 56:29.837
First things first.

56:30.377 --> 56:35.620
Just mentioned a moment ago, perfect through five innings was gauged against Murray State.

56:35.640 --> 56:36.120
11 strikeouts.

56:39.913 --> 56:41.094
He's not even that tall.

56:42.794 --> 56:43.715
It's just gas.

56:43.735 --> 56:46.015
He's just gotten an arm, you know, like a cannon.

56:46.896 --> 56:47.876
Look at how tiny he is.

56:47.896 --> 56:50.937
Imagine if that guy was six foot four, you know.

56:52.057 --> 56:53.658
Wood facing Dom Decker.

56:53.818 --> 56:54.678
Oh no.

56:55.678 --> 57:00.140
There goes the perfect game, but the no hitter still intact.

57:00.220 --> 57:01.300
Three batters later.

57:02.620 --> 57:03.201
Off speed.

57:04.081 --> 57:05.841
Eight innings pitch, 16 strikeouts.

57:05.881 --> 57:07.342
Ninth inning, one out, cutting him up.

57:08.902 --> 57:09.923
I mean, this is the ninth inning.

57:11.165 --> 57:14.689
Chatters.

57:14.709 --> 57:14.689
97.

57:15.490 --> 57:15.991
That's heat.

57:18.654 --> 57:18.955
Yep.

57:19.095 --> 57:21.278
He's throwing 97 in the ninth inning.

57:21.298 --> 57:22.639
19 strikeouts, 119 pitches.

57:22.659 --> 57:25.723
And then he goes Arkansas, baby.

57:25.843 --> 57:26.945
Arkansas, baby.

57:29.492 --> 57:32.993
You just came over here and gave a hug to Connor Cunningham.

57:33.033 --> 57:33.333
Why?

57:34.294 --> 57:36.754
Because I worked out with that guy in the offseason.

57:38.035 --> 57:42.036
I didn't expect to see him here.

57:42.536 --> 57:43.657
I got to play against him.

57:44.037 --> 57:47.318
He got there a year later than when I graduated.

57:47.338 --> 57:49.099
I worked out with that guy in the offseason.

57:49.119 --> 57:49.759
He's a grinder.

57:50.199 --> 57:51.399
He works his tail off every day.

57:54.189 --> 58:10.304
It makes me very excited because I think at least one of my sons is a grinder who's just decided that, you know what, it makes sense to me that if I just work hard every day, eventually I'm going to get ahead of people and they won't be able to catch up because I'm going to keep working.

58:11.065 --> 58:13.887
And every day that he does more work than his

58:14.813 --> 58:17.394
his age group, he feels like he's successful.

58:17.474 --> 58:21.375
And I can't fault that strategy at all.

58:21.636 --> 58:29.859
And I do think that more and more youth are starting to figure out that skills are worth developing, that skills don't come

58:30.859 --> 58:43.962
from genetics or as a gift they are only achieved through hard work and that that's what you see here and and listen to the what he says after this because the hard work isn't just his.

58:44.102 --> 58:57.725
He's my scramble buddy too and I mean I'm looking forward to working with him every offseason going forward you know he's he's gonna be uh he's gonna get drafted one day you know he's a solid shortstop I think he was freshman of the year for them so of course I'm gonna go over there and talk to my guy like

58:58.385 --> 59:03.448
I mean, I'm on cloud nine and their season ended, but, you know, I mean, I'm gonna go tell him I love him.

59:03.528 --> 59:04.768
Great job and keep working.

59:05.228 --> 59:07.290
You just threw the third no hitter in the history.

59:07.330 --> 59:20.096
And what do you think that GigaOM Biological is doing, by the way, not to say that I'm some kind of big dude or anything, but I'm trying to lead by example because I am working every day and it's not this stream that's my work.

59:20.956 --> 59:23.057
It's the books that I carry around with me.

59:23.277 --> 59:24.658
It's the notes that I'm taking.

59:25.399 --> 59:31.782
It's my obsession with this for the last five years that has resulted in me being surrounded by too many books to read.

59:33.023 --> 59:41.148
I'm spending thousands of my giga ohm dollars on the books that I think I need to have in order to read what I need to read.

59:44.171 --> 59:48.413
And I am going to do it until I can't do it anymore.

59:48.694 --> 59:59.159
And that's also why I'm dedicating so much time to getting in good enough shape to be able to teach from the biology court, or from the basketball court, excuse me.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:05.543
Because if this is going to work for me and my family, it's got to work for me and my family.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:08.304
It can't just be something where everything is sacrificed.

01:00:08.384 --> 01:00:12.687
And so I'm trying to find a way to turn it into something that just works for us.

01:00:13.806 --> 01:00:27.292
And I think, I believe that because I have been working so hard every day consistently for so long, and it's not just the red circles that I showed you yesterday, going to the gym every day and grinding on the floor.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:37.536
It's also getting up every morning and grinding on the internet and grinding on these books and grinding on this book and grinding on these notes and this outline.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:49.757
And it's not grinding on Substack where every time you post something, the AI can chatbot it away to a hundred other Substacks with thousands more subscribers than you.

01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:56.422
What is the math of 40,000 subscribers on Substack?

01:00:57.042 --> 01:01:08.711
In my humble opinion, if you're charging $5 a person and only one-tenth of the 40,000 subscribers pay $5 a month, that seems to be a pretty reasonable living.

01:01:11.741 --> 01:01:14.582
It seems to be a pretty obnoxious living, to be honest.

01:01:16.543 --> 01:01:27.087
And yet so many of these people that purport to be heroes in America are exclusively, it would seem, only necessarily funded by Substack.

01:01:28.108 --> 01:01:33.750
Paul Alexander has 45,000 subscribers on Substack.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:38.512
If even one-tenth of those subscribers are paying

01:01:40.987 --> 01:01:42.509
he should be ashamed of himself.

01:01:46.012 --> 01:02:00.366
Anybody that's written a Substack about me, positive or negative, I wonder how many subscribers Kevin McKernan has on Substack and how many of them are paid and whether that hundred millionaire man living on the

01:02:01.076 --> 01:02:08.980
on Marblehead in Boston needs that many paid subscribers to Substack.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.461
What's he doing with that money?

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.502
What's Jessica Rose doing with her money?

01:02:14.082 --> 01:02:16.924
What is Pierre Cory doing with her money?

01:02:17.144 --> 01:02:20.185
What is Jessica Hockett doing with her money?

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.807
With tens of thousands of subscribers?

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:34.148
when you only need 1,000 subscribers paying $5 a month to pay for a five-person family in America.

01:02:36.431 --> 01:02:38.553
And these people have 10 times that.

01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:43.358
How do they justify it?

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:56.381
How does Mary Holland justify taking a quarter million dollar salary for 15 years at these organizations, or 10 years at the head of this organization?

01:02:56.742 --> 01:03:02.865
How does Del Bigtree justify taking his salary for that long, having accomplished nothing?

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.287
Sorry, back to the good news.

01:03:08.767 --> 01:03:10.028
How do you describe your emotions?

01:03:10.929 --> 01:03:11.689
I shouldn't have hit the guy.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:13.693
That's it.

01:03:13.793 --> 01:03:14.494
That's all I got to say.

01:03:14.754 --> 01:03:17.195
When did you realize something special was happening?

01:03:18.556 --> 01:03:25.139
I mean, I, I didn't throw a pitch out of the stretch for a while and I was like, Oh, and your fastball, how did that feel to you?

01:03:25.159 --> 01:03:27.220
Oh man, it's coming out pretty good.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:27.881
It felt like today.

01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:30.782
I mean, it's nice and warm, so I was feeling pretty good.

01:03:31.803 --> 01:03:33.003
Your family's here watching.

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:34.924
We saw pictures of them in there.

01:03:34.964 --> 01:03:38.666
What I know is that the genetics of his rotator cuff ought to be looked at.

01:03:38.767 --> 01:03:39.387
That's for sure.

01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:40.374
emotions.

01:03:40.614 --> 01:03:42.695
How meaningful have they been to you in your journey?

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:44.197
I mean, they're everything.

01:03:44.217 --> 01:03:50.161
You know, they sacrificed a lot of time and money and everything to take me all over the country to play baseball.

01:03:50.842 --> 01:03:52.503
You know, and I can't thank them enough.

01:03:52.683 --> 01:03:58.828
And even my high school coaches that are here right now in my high school strength coach, I wouldn't be where I am today without Price Holmes.

01:03:59.189 --> 01:04:00.510
Yeah, you're an Arkansas kid.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.231
You're representing Arkansas.

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.612
What's this program meant to you?

01:04:04.133 --> 01:04:04.693
It's everything.

01:04:04.733 --> 01:04:07.175
You know, I mean, it's the only thing I'm focused on.

01:04:07.195 --> 01:04:07.976
We got to keep winning.

01:04:08.016 --> 01:04:09.177
You know, we want the whole thing.

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:20.280
I'm also focused I want the whole thing too and staying focused means you got to see them all and Mark and I have had

01:04:22.165 --> 01:04:24.407
Peggy Hall on our radars for a while.

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:28.431
I've been sending him videos, sometimes he sends me videos.

01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:40.083
We've never really done anything about it, even though at the beginning of the pandemic you can actually find podcasts from their church with Judy Mikovits and with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:04:40.123 --> 01:04:40.203
in 2020.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:45.586
Very clearly, it's all one malevolent show.

01:04:46.787 --> 01:04:51.449
If she were to have had Robert Malone on her show, then you'd already know, right?

01:04:51.489 --> 01:04:52.249
She's full of shit.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:58.171
Just like, you know, if Robert Malone was on Paul Cattrall's show, that would seem like really stupid, right?

01:04:58.211 --> 01:05:07.655
So then if Robert Malone went on her show, or if Paul Cattrall went on her show, or George Webb went on her show, it would be like, wait, wow, that's pretty dumb.

01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:17.038
I mean that's pretty dumb if from the beginning of the pandemic she was already on or kind of on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:05:17.018 --> 01:05:21.321
's team and now is one of those people that's on the internet kind of skeptical of Robert F. Kennedy.

01:05:21.722 --> 01:05:24.744
Maybe he's actually not anti-vaccine.

01:05:24.764 --> 01:05:25.165
I don't know.

01:05:25.705 --> 01:05:28.448
Jibby jabs and all these other silly things that she says.

01:05:29.188 --> 01:05:29.829
She's a fake.

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:31.930
She's as fake as they come.

01:05:33.044 --> 01:05:45.006
And she was one of these people who was likely chosen because she was in a good position at the beginning of the pandemic and maybe even encouraged to put herself in that good position before the pandemic to be ready for the start of it.

01:05:45.466 --> 01:05:47.567
Just like a lot of these other people likely were.

01:05:48.467 --> 01:05:58.289
And so now, I think what would be especially revealing is if she had somebody like Kevin McKernan on her stream, because then again, the guy who lied about Rixie

01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:04.441
the guy who lies about the diffuse proposal on Peggy Hall's program would be extraordinary.

01:06:04.981 --> 01:06:14.148
Another interesting set of people that I think would be interesting if she, sorry, if she had on there would be any of these people over here.

01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:28.079
Because of course, these people over here were performing for a couple three years in conjunction with Kevin McCairn in Japan, where also James Corbett lives.

01:06:29.738 --> 01:06:42.906
And so James Corbett being put in place at the beginning of the pandemic to make sure that everybody was afraid of Bill Gates, and James Corbett being promoted by CHD from the very beginning, doing podcasts with Meryl Nass.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:54.393
James Corbett is clearly a bullshitter, a scripted bullshitter, and he's very good at it, but he's a meddler on the exact same team that these people are on.

01:06:55.518 --> 01:06:58.081
It's all one show.

01:06:58.741 --> 01:06:59.042
Okay.

01:06:59.362 --> 01:07:00.383
I'm going to be back in a minute.

01:07:00.463 --> 01:07:06.890
I'm going to show you why it's all one show with Peggy Hall, because Peggy Hall blew it the other day.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:12.115
And so we've got to, we've got to pounce on that, or at least we've got to make sure that people see it.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:14.998
And I'll be back in a second.

01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:16.320
Music break.

01:07:25.111 --> 01:07:25.351
So,

01:07:59.438 --> 01:08:02.721
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it.

01:08:23.507 --> 01:08:26.719
Don't stand so Don't stand so close to me

01:09:36.456 --> 01:09:38.456
His thoughts to share

01:10:40.743 --> 01:10:56.903
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop so close to me Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop so close to me Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop so close to me

01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:03.779
It does have some questionable lyrics.

01:11:03.819 --> 01:11:05.160
You're not wrong about that.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:20.288
The reason why it does is because actually Sting used to be a school teacher and it's actually, you know, you can imagine he's a handsome guy, young guy in a school and girls get crushes on their teachers.

01:11:20.628 --> 01:11:27.192
And that song is about a girl having a crush on him as a teacher and it being a controversy.

01:11:28.465 --> 01:11:31.808
for him and so that song is about that.

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:37.134
It's actually very controversial lyrics in that song and that's why.

01:11:38.355 --> 01:11:43.040
They are all bullshitters, scripted bullshitters on Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's bullshit script.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.021
My name is Jonathan Couey.

01:11:46.481 --> 01:11:47.942
Welcome to the back half of the show.

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:52.405
We are now gonna cover this little video that happened yesterday.

01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:59.631
It was actually a promotion of a previously recorded video of two of these, one of these super clowns right here.

01:12:00.051 --> 01:12:07.857
The reason why this super clown is such a super clown and why you can know that they are not real is the list is very, very long.

01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:16.304
Um, but, uh, the primary reason why I think it's possible to know that they're full of shit, um, is described on this screen here.

01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:20.488
So let me just, uh, uh, change sizes here.

01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:24.993
So Tom Cowan had a book, a Chelsea publishing book in 2018, I believe.

01:12:29.135 --> 01:12:29.996
18, not 17.

01:12:30.757 --> 01:12:37.382
And he talks very little about what happened during the pandemic, just says that there are no viruses.

01:12:37.422 --> 01:12:38.863
And he's very specific about it.

01:12:39.444 --> 01:12:41.765
And so he doesn't want to explain why anybody died.

01:12:41.906 --> 01:12:44.448
And that's the reason why this is a problem.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.410
It's OK to do that, I guess, in March of 2020.

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.351
It's not OK to do that in June of 2025 and all the years between.

01:12:55.616 --> 01:12:58.497
Christine Massey is also a scripted clown.

01:12:58.537 --> 01:13:06.399
I'm not really sure if she knows the extent to which that she has been used, but her FOIA requests and all that shit was dumb.

01:13:06.739 --> 01:13:18.422
But she was also used as a puppet to play me while I was working at CHD, and often I would get emails from supposedly Christine Massey who was insulting me and demanding that I send her papers about infectious clones.

01:13:20.094 --> 01:13:32.510
Perhaps the most damning evidence that this is one malevolent show all on the same team with this jackass who supposedly lives in Tokyo, is that for most of 2021 and probably a lot of 2022,

01:13:37.014 --> 01:13:49.503
This jackass, when he raised money on his live streams, would play a gif where he referred to this as Bimbo Bailey with a picture of her with hot dogs in her mouth.

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:52.766
And referred to her as Bimbo Bailey a lot.

01:13:54.407 --> 01:13:56.849
Now the reason why this bothered me at the time

01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:13.657
was that in 2020 I had already sent her an email asking if I could interview her about the PCR test, thought she was being brave by speaking up, and she told me that she was having a baby and she couldn't interview, couldn't talk to me, but she would contact me after the baby was born.

01:14:14.277 --> 01:14:15.597
And of course that didn't happen.

01:14:15.697 --> 01:14:16.077
By then,

01:14:17.998 --> 01:14:20.341
They were busy with their own thing.

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:26.968
I was being fired from the University of Pittsburgh and being meddled with in lots of ways, and it never really came back to it.

01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:39.041
But I started to see, without necessarily telling him already, but I started to see him as questionable simply because of his ridiculous take on Bimbo Bailey.

01:14:39.702 --> 01:14:40.743
I never told him that.

01:14:40.783 --> 01:14:42.444
I didn't say, hey dude, like she's cool.

01:14:42.484 --> 01:14:43.805
Like at least she questions the people.

01:14:44.365 --> 01:14:51.591
I didn't defend her at all because again, this is a guy who had my link on his website and I couldn't figure out what was going on.

01:14:51.651 --> 01:15:05.861
I just knew that he was streaming for three hours every night and that he was talking to some guy named Spartacus who seemed to know everything about the ACE2 receptor and all of its relationships to the physiology and regulation of fluid dynamics in the blood.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:13.102
I was bamboozled, I was fooled by the show that these people were putting on on the internet.

01:15:13.202 --> 01:15:17.544
And from the beginning of the pandemic, this guy said that Andy Kaufman was the worst guy.

01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:22.345
And that later he pivoted to these guys also being terrible.

01:15:22.626 --> 01:15:36.571
He still has a meme of her and her face is superimposed over a dune sandworm in his intro still that also contains five slides dedicated to me.

01:15:37.796 --> 01:15:40.118
That guy right there, in the middle of this screen.

01:15:40.699 --> 01:15:42.721
Kevin, worst case scenario, McCairn.

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:59.498
Like yesterday, he did a stream, the intro is still the same, all the same bullshit music for like 15 minutes, and still has five dedicated slides to me, and one dedicated slide to her, and a couple dedicated slides to Mark Bailey.

01:16:00.828 --> 01:16:09.675
But Mark Bailey and him did a very cordial and gentlemanly stream in 2022, despite the fact that he had been calling his wife a whore for a year and a half.

01:16:10.295 --> 01:16:14.459
Very cordial stream, moderated by Tim Truth.

01:16:21.963 --> 01:16:41.347
And so now it would be very, very extraordinary if, for example, in 2020, they did a podcast together right after the same podcaster interviewed Robert Malone and Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough, who would almost never be seen on a stream together again.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:43.700
Don't you see?

01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:59.972
Peter McCullough, Ryan Cole, and Robert Malone have been on only a couple streams together, and it was early in the pandemic, and then they split off to each herd their own group of cats.

01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:10.239
Once they had the narrative curation approval slip, the little badge where it says that I know the trick, I've got my script,

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.522
They went on and led all the cats that they're leading now.

01:17:15.362 --> 01:17:18.444
Ryan Cole might go on to be the governor of Idaho.

01:17:20.645 --> 01:17:23.366
Maybe Peter McCullough will run for governor in Texas, I doubt it.

01:17:27.228 --> 01:17:28.789
Robert Malone's on the ACIP.

01:17:32.071 --> 01:17:34.052
It's all one show.

01:17:36.135 --> 01:17:42.662
and you will see evidence for it because in 2020... ...into worst-case scenario.

01:17:42.682 --> 01:17:46.065
In 2024... ...latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

01:17:46.325 --> 01:17:46.626
And in 2025...

01:17:50.998 --> 01:17:54.139
Hey friends, Peggy Hall back with you from TheHealthyAmerican.org.

01:17:54.479 --> 01:17:58.121
I'm taking quite a risk with this video, challenging the germ theory.

01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:01.962
We're going to be looking at this book, Can You Catch a Cold?

01:18:02.522 --> 01:18:10.425
And the author, Daniel Roytas, is being interviewed by my friend, you probably know her, Dr. Sam Bailey.

01:18:11.146 --> 01:18:11.926
My friend.

01:18:13.266 --> 01:18:15.026
My friend Sam Bailey.

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:23.868
I'm going to promote my friend Sam Bailey and take a risk by challenging the contagion myth on YouTube.

01:18:27.729 --> 01:18:28.489
Stop lying!

01:18:29.369 --> 01:18:30.750
Stop lying!

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:40.672
This really reveals Peggy Hall to be nothing but a absolute awful traitor to American grandkids.

01:18:42.032 --> 01:18:42.312
Awful.

01:18:43.632 --> 01:18:47.455
She's a traitor to all the, whatever the American idea is.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:52.378
And make no mistake about it, they are using...

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:18.313
charming accents and attractive people from other countries to make sure that Americans always feel behind the ball, that Americans always feel shame, that Americans always feel responsible, that Americans will ultimately turn on themselves and their country and the idea of what the country represents

01:19:19.193 --> 01:19:20.234
and burn it all down.

01:19:21.034 --> 01:19:22.715
That's what they're trying to trigger.

01:19:23.116 --> 01:19:27.718
That's what they want the Democrats to do to the Republicans and the Republicans to do to the Democrats.

01:19:27.738 --> 01:19:29.900
That's what they want the whites to do to the blacks.

01:19:34.082 --> 01:19:34.763
They want it all.

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:39.294
And the only way they're going to get it is to break it all down.

01:19:39.394 --> 01:19:58.967
And these people are in on it because after six years, after publishing a book, it is impossible for them to still be where they are with such a specific details about what they think really is going on in the world, what really happened in the last five years.

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:00.408
And instead this,

01:20:01.688 --> 01:20:13.572
Ugh, this stupid, feel-good, shitty music from a terrible documentary and these terrible overdone accents and these freaking fake people.

01:20:16.113 --> 01:20:17.173
Please enjoy.

01:20:17.193 --> 01:20:21.515
This was important because it hasn't been done before.

01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:33.021
So there aren't any published papers anywhere in the scientific literature that document all of the failed human or any of the human contagion experiments.

01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:43.569
So he's now going to prove a negative by showing you that the contagion experiments that are recorded in our history don't do what they purported to do.

01:20:48.572 --> 01:20:50.474
So explain to us what cholera is.

01:20:55.089 --> 01:20:59.440
Explain to us what yellow fever is.

01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:02.327
Explain to us what, see, this is the problem, right?

01:21:03.516 --> 01:21:05.777
They are not offering you an alternative.

01:21:05.837 --> 01:21:17.064
They are going to, as limited as possible, challenge something that will never free your grandkids because it will still leave them trapped in the basic bad biology 101.

01:21:18.204 --> 01:21:25.488
Listen to this shit music and understand that there's no way to take anybody seriously if they put music like this behind their video.

01:21:25.628 --> 01:21:26.089
No way.

01:21:26.769 --> 01:21:28.210
It's by definition bullshit.

01:21:29.878 --> 01:21:33.383
or contagious illnesses like the cold or flu or measles or any of these diseases.

01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:43.877
That's something that's immediately apparent when you start looking at the literature and for good reason because once you do that and you look at the results you find that

01:21:45.618 --> 01:21:54.921
The overwhelming majority of experiments that were done trying to prove contagion or transmit illness from sick people to healthy people failed.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:22:04.483
And so they are not going to explain to you how they've overcome this to produce the rest of the literature that they call virology, which is what?

01:22:05.163 --> 01:22:14.765
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been watching this show for a while, you should have already screamed at the top of your lungs to the screen, they can make recombinant DNA and put it places.

01:22:15.285 --> 01:22:16.965
You silly shithead.

01:22:20.486 --> 01:22:24.547
So if the contagion experiments didn't work, how are they doing virology?

01:22:24.587 --> 01:22:29.208
And they're not going to tell you that because if they did, they'd have to admit that they could have told you that in 2020.

01:22:33.308 --> 01:22:34.449
These people are traitors.

01:22:35.271 --> 01:22:38.274
They are performers and they are doing it happily.

01:22:38.915 --> 01:22:49.869
Anybody, anybody who is actually at the brick wall should have some difficulty controlling the anger that they experience every day when they start to swim in it.

01:22:51.121 --> 01:23:14.757
when their face starts to scrape against the bricks again because they've decided to read into this more, when your face starts to scrape into the bricks again because you've decided to try and figure out a little bit more about transfection and transformation and molecular biology and phages, you get a little angry after a while because it's like, why in the hell am I the only person who's ever had the wherewithal to do this work?

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:30.968
It's exactly the same reason why a friend of mine, Mark Kulak, will often come on stream and it seems like he's yelling at his viewers, just like I yell at my viewers, because look, if you were trapped alone where we're trapped alone, you'd be pissed too.

01:23:30.988 --> 01:23:35.150
Time and time and time again.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:47.826
Daniel Roytis is a naturopath, nutritionist and physical therapist with over 10 years of clinical experience, as well as being a lecturer at many of Australia's leading natural medicine colleges and universities.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:58.771
In 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 era, Daniel started questioning much of what he thought were scientific facts and embarked on a new phase of private research.

01:23:59.594 --> 01:24:07.216
He launched the Humanly platform and has featured discussions with many of the world's foremost heterodox thinkers in health and science.

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:17.239
Even using the word heterodox says that she's scripted and scripted by the same shitheads that script Brett Weinstein.

01:24:17.479 --> 01:24:25.121
I never freaking use the word heterodox to describe anything because I'm not scripted and I think that word is freaking stupid.

01:24:26.855 --> 01:24:38.018
After facing professional difficulties for publicly sharing his research findings, Daniel decided to forge a new path where he would not submit to scientific dogma or other people's rules.

01:24:38.698 --> 01:24:44.979
As part of this journey, he has just published an incredible new book titled, Can You Catch a Cold?

01:24:45.279 --> 01:24:52.761
It is the culmination of several years of focused research and takes its place as the- What the f- What does that picture mean?

01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:55.582
Give me a break.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:25:00.914
most comprehensive account of human contagion experiments ever seen.

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:12.020
This one-of-a-kind book is a must-read and reveals many of the varied and inconvenient clinical experiments that go against germ theory and the mainstream claims.

01:25:13.021 --> 01:25:17.763
I had the honour of writing the foreword for Can You Catch a Cold?

01:25:18.484 --> 01:25:21.886
and will also be recording an audiobook version later this year.

01:25:22.975 --> 01:25:26.937
Well, thank you so much, Dan, for agreeing to come on.

01:25:26.957 --> 01:25:29.878
She's going to do an audio book.

01:25:30.178 --> 01:25:30.958
Awesome, boy.

01:25:32.899 --> 01:25:38.781
They might be able to use that to torture people in military operations.

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.622
You could just put that on full blast.

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:41.843
Oh, my goodness.

01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:55.283
Um, so one interesting thing to note here is that apparently her house is painted black on the inside, which is just... That just says all kinds of shit about you as a person, like...

01:25:56.482 --> 01:25:57.863
And I'm just going to say it right now.

01:25:58.183 --> 01:26:04.385
I wouldn't be friends with somebody who had the taste and concept in their head to paint their freaking house black.

01:26:04.465 --> 01:26:05.206
That's wrong.

01:26:05.646 --> 01:26:06.726
That's so stupid.

01:26:07.266 --> 01:26:12.048
Like, I don't even know how to exclaim how dumb that is.

01:26:12.288 --> 01:26:22.753
Other than you're like, you're so pompous and full of yourself that you change the color of your rooms like every few months because you just pay people to do it.

01:26:22.813 --> 01:26:25.114
Otherwise that's just so freaking

01:26:25.974 --> 01:26:26.894
It's so bad.

01:26:27.055 --> 01:26:28.355
Like, who does that?

01:26:29.876 --> 01:26:30.676
Pass with me.

01:26:30.736 --> 01:26:34.057
It's so exciting to hear about your new book.

01:26:34.698 --> 01:26:34.958
Ha!

01:26:35.478 --> 01:26:38.159
Navy blue, says the chat.

01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:38.639
You know what?

01:26:38.679 --> 01:26:39.520
You're totally right.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:47.223
I had one wall in my childhood bedroom that was painted, painted navy blue, like midnight blue.

01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:51.665
And then I had one wall in my bedroom that was cloud wallpaper.

01:26:52.802 --> 01:26:56.845
And on the cloud wallpaper, I had put glow-in-the-dark stars.

01:26:57.525 --> 01:27:03.469
So that when you had the room, you had, you know, dark sky and light sky with clouds.

01:27:03.489 --> 01:27:07.651
And when you turn the light off, you had dark walls and fricking glow-in-the-dark stars.

01:27:07.711 --> 01:27:14.236
Now, I don't see any glow-in-the-dark stars and I don't see a fricking wall with wallpaper with clouds.

01:27:14.276 --> 01:27:16.617
And I definitely don't think that this is navy blue.

01:27:16.657 --> 01:27:17.197
So you're right.

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:20.720
Navy blue would be totally tolerable, even usable and creative.

01:27:21.499 --> 01:27:24.721
But Black is just, wow, what's wrong with you?

01:27:26.562 --> 01:27:40.211
Yeah, it's been a long time coming and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to come and speak with you about the work that I've been doing and forever indebted and grateful for your support and Mark's support, Sam.

01:27:40.651 --> 01:27:44.834
It's honestly, the feeling's very mutual because I think we've been on this

01:27:45.421 --> 01:27:47.061
almost synergistic path together.

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.462
Now remember, I have an email.

01:27:49.662 --> 01:27:51.142
I contacted her in 2020.

01:27:51.963 --> 01:27:58.164
She said she would contact me after when she started podcasting again, but she didn't.

01:27:58.864 --> 01:28:03.046
And instead she was part of this group of people that regularly opposed me.

01:28:03.246 --> 01:28:12.448
Actually, her husband was part of the five people that got together and talked about me in 2023 and about infectious clones and how stupid it was or something like that.

01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:31.141
They are all on the same team as Peggy Hall, and Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Claire Craig, and Nick Hudson of Panda, and Jonathan Engler of Heart, and Jessica Hockett on Substack, and all of these people.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.602
They're all on the same team.

01:28:34.363 --> 01:28:43.346
And they're all responsible for this bullshit health freedom movement that somehow influenced enough to, I guess, put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:28:43.406 --> 01:28:49.448
somewhere that doesn't matter because everybody else that's underneath him is complete shitheads anyway.

01:28:49.528 --> 01:28:51.128
Most of them have two passports.

01:28:51.188 --> 01:28:52.228
What's going on?

01:28:56.130 --> 01:29:04.132
Other than some absolutely awful malevolent show that you would never see if you weren't on YouTube or X or Rumble.

01:29:06.949 --> 01:29:09.450
it feels like with even our books.

01:29:09.650 --> 01:29:18.192
And so I really would like to start from the beginning with you, to go right back to where it all, your journey, I guess.

01:29:18.633 --> 01:29:20.773
She is attempting to be cute.

01:29:22.434 --> 01:29:32.837
This is all a well-scripted, well-rehearsed five year, this is five years worth of practice, this character.

01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:39.534
trying to be the little shy, little cute girl, whatever the shit she's doing.

01:29:39.554 --> 01:29:44.078
It looks like she took some of the Botox or filler out of her lips.

01:29:44.458 --> 01:29:48.801
To how you became a naturopath for people that don't know your background.

01:29:50.242 --> 01:29:52.944
I guess I was pretty unwell as a child.

01:29:53.045 --> 01:29:59.890
I have such a hard time smiling when I do these shows because it's just not fun to be here.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.517
but it's very fun to be where they are.

01:30:02.557 --> 01:30:06.901
They're very happy and comfortable where they are, their journey together.

01:30:06.921 --> 01:30:14.668
I followed him, we went to all the different doctors and they essentially said, he's making it up, he's putting it on.

01:30:15.549 --> 01:30:18.391
And I got so sick, I couldn't play sport anymore.

01:30:18.431 --> 01:30:27.439
I love playing soccer and I had to give that up because- So the reason why he became a naturopath is because as a kid, he was sick and nobody could cure him.

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.421
how unwell I was.

01:30:30.461 --> 01:30:36.125
And then we went to a chiropractor and he did some dietary changes and some various other techniques.

01:30:36.966 --> 01:30:37.867
And I got better.

01:30:38.727 --> 01:30:47.894
And from that point on, I wanted to be a chiropractor throughout my sort of teens, but they didn't offer chiropractic in Brisbane, in the city that I live in.

01:30:48.675 --> 01:30:50.856
So I found the next best thing, which was.

01:30:51.257 --> 01:30:55.720
So he changed his diet and somebody cracked his back and then he got better.

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:57.402
Is that what I'm supposed to assume here?

01:30:57.742 --> 01:30:58.682
Naturopathic medicine.

01:30:59.471 --> 01:31:02.273
So I studied that and did my undergraduate degree.

01:31:02.293 --> 01:31:04.894
I think I started around 2006 or seven.

01:31:06.235 --> 01:31:21.703
And when I finished that, I went and did a postgraduate degree in human nutrition, went and started another master's degree in Chinese medicine, which I'm still yet to complete, and a whole other bunch of postgraduate qualifications and things.

01:31:22.584 --> 01:31:23.725
I was fortunate enough to get

01:31:24.815 --> 01:31:31.359
approached by a couple of colleges when I first graduated to do some tutoring, and that progressed into lecturing.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:39.545
And eventually I became a senior lecturer, which is a position I held for many years at colleges and universities.

01:31:39.925 --> 01:31:42.027
So he didn't ever really do any research.

01:31:42.067 --> 01:31:46.790
He's a teacher, which is fine, but it's very different than my background, for example.

01:31:47.742 --> 01:31:48.382
around the country.

01:31:49.563 --> 01:31:56.204
And eventually got to the point where I realized that most of what I was teaching was nonsense and I couldn't ethically do it anymore.

01:31:56.264 --> 01:32:02.406
So I gave up my job in mid to late 2022.

01:32:03.487 --> 01:32:04.667
And yeah, the rest is history.

01:32:05.427 --> 01:32:07.268
The wake up point.

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:08.928
2022 is pretty late.

01:32:09.948 --> 01:32:11.569
That's like a C Mahaltra late.

01:32:13.497 --> 01:32:18.198
Um, I'd already been officially dismissed for two years and off.

01:32:18.298 --> 01:32:19.838
I mean, it's, it's odd, right?

01:32:20.478 --> 01:32:23.559
In 2022 is when I got hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:32:25.499 --> 01:32:25.759
Hmm.

01:32:26.179 --> 01:32:26.659
Interesting.

01:32:26.739 --> 01:32:27.499
Late timing.

01:32:27.559 --> 01:32:29.360
So why, why promote this guy?

01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:31.780
You know, why, why are we, huh?

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:32.880
What was it?

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.021
What happened to you?

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:34.901
Was this before 2020?

01:32:34.941 --> 01:32:36.021
Was it after what kind of, he just said it was 2022.

01:32:36.061 --> 01:32:36.501
You dipshit.

01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:37.201
Are you listening?

01:32:37.221 --> 01:32:37.361
Well,

01:32:42.363 --> 01:32:43.983
Can you talk a wee bit more about that?

01:32:44.764 --> 01:32:51.505
I always knew that something wasn't right with medicine, I guess, and health from an early age.

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.946
But that's not COVID, dipshit.

01:32:53.986 --> 01:32:55.887
When did you find your principles?

01:32:55.967 --> 01:32:58.787
She's asking you a specific question, not a general one.

01:32:59.027 --> 01:33:05.249
My parents were always looking at medical alternatives because the medical system failed them.

01:33:06.069 --> 01:33:08.190
And I saw that it worked for my parents and then it worked for me.

01:33:09.266 --> 01:33:20.008
And I got thinking, how is it that medicine can't help people and the people that do get helped by natural medicine, they're sort of dismissed as quacks and it's all nonsense.

01:33:20.648 --> 01:33:25.770
So that left me asking a lot of questions and it is one reason why I did get into the natural medicine field.

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:37.192
But I think in 2014, I realized that something was a bit of a miss, more so than what I had already realized throughout most of my life by that point.

01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:41.653
and went down quite a rabbit hole with a lot of different things.

01:33:42.974 --> 01:33:44.895
Listen to how aspecific he's being.

01:33:44.975 --> 01:33:47.817
Is he saying that he figured out that vaccines were bullshit?

01:33:50.019 --> 01:33:52.581
Listen to how aspecific he's being.

01:33:52.641 --> 01:33:59.365
Now remember, I'm trying to be as specific as possible when I say that intramuscular injection is just dumb until somebody tells me otherwise.

01:34:00.366 --> 01:34:03.588
And I only just started this journey very recently and I don't have a book.

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:10.800
I'm not being promoted by the great Sam Bailey, who already also has a book and a following of millions of people.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:18.422
I'm not being promoted by anybody, even the guy who I helped write a book, who's now at the Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America.

01:34:19.802 --> 01:34:31.165
These people don't seem to be concerned about the fact that the former scientific advisor to the now Health and Human Services Secretary of America says that there is no COVID pandemic.

01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:36.742
They're doing their best to ignore me since they did that one stream.

01:34:39.683 --> 01:34:53.469
What you need to see here is this is a American promoting foreigners who are curating the narrative about how people died.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:35:06.028
They are curating the narrative of how people died in America and not talking about the murder that they know exists because we've told them.

01:35:06.689 --> 01:35:10.173
They know exists because they are being employed not to talk about it.

01:35:12.625 --> 01:35:22.188
These people come from Australia and New Zealand where the lockdowns were ridiculous and only possible because of the murder committed in America.

01:35:22.288 --> 01:35:36.732
Otherwise they would have never, maybe they would have because they're such weak humans, weak people, but America would have never tolerated the lockdowns had they not murdered people in America.

01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:42.461
Maybe the Australians and the New Zealanders would have tolerated lockdowns with comic books.

01:35:42.641 --> 01:35:43.041
I don't know.

01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:47.024
But the point is, is that these people are complicit in murder.

01:35:49.446 --> 01:35:51.688
Complicit in murder.

01:35:51.909 --> 01:35:58.734
And this charade that they're enjoying their collective experience together.

01:35:58.774 --> 01:36:01.577
And wow, isn't it funny how we have the same journey?

01:36:03.302 --> 01:36:05.103
These are absolute criminals.

01:36:06.183 --> 01:36:06.764
2020 came around.

01:36:07.244 --> 01:36:10.686
I actually heard Dr. Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.467
Andy Kaufman, Tom Cowan.

01:36:13.827 --> 01:36:15.548
Wow, surprise, surprise.

01:36:15.588 --> 01:36:17.549
They're the ones who woke this guy up.

01:36:20.611 --> 01:36:21.831
Are you kidding me?

01:36:23.632 --> 01:36:28.975
Talking about this thing called terrain theory and that germs don't cause disease.

01:36:30.734 --> 01:36:32.394
and it immediately resonated with me.

01:36:32.594 --> 01:36:37.475
I think sometimes when you hear- I don't think that Australian men as individuals are weak.

01:36:37.555 --> 01:36:41.176
I definitely don't think Australian Sheilas are weak in general.

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:58.199
I'm just trying to say that what they did in Australia, where they prevented people from going from province to province, even if they had family across the border, that their lockdowns included not being able to go on dog walks and shit.

01:36:59.502 --> 01:37:01.383
Like yeah, America did some stupid stuff.

01:37:01.423 --> 01:37:05.645
Like we put sand in skate parks and stuff like that.

01:37:05.666 --> 01:37:09.928
And then we took drone videos of it and we chased people down the beach.

01:37:10.028 --> 01:37:15.011
But in Australia, they were throwing people against the wall to make sure that they wore masks.

01:37:15.071 --> 01:37:16.672
They were using tear gas and shit.

01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:18.493
I'm not saying they're weak.

01:37:19.824 --> 01:37:29.591
I'm saying that they couldn't have stood up to this because of the fact that they were murdering people in America and these mother effers were lying about it.

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:35.274
Or were willing to get on a script that still lies about it.

01:37:37.856 --> 01:37:48.103
When the whole reason why the vaccine rollout was so successful in his country of Australia was because they were willing to murder people and lie about it in America.

01:37:51.727 --> 01:37:55.868
These people could turn the whole narrative around if they just said to themselves, you know what?

01:37:56.248 --> 01:38:00.269
The only reason why they were able to lock us down was because they murdered people in America.

01:38:01.989 --> 01:38:04.350
They lied about the opioid epidemic in America.

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:06.090
That's why they were able to lock us down.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:10.191
That's why our Australian politicians should be in jail.

01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:12.331
But is this guy campaigning for justice?

01:38:15.632 --> 01:38:16.512
Absolutely not.

01:38:19.855 --> 01:38:21.216
Do you see why it doesn't work?

01:38:21.276 --> 01:38:32.546
Do you see why this international story doesn't work when you realize that the same way out applies to everybody once you call it murder and lies and you just have to find out where they were done?

01:38:33.067 --> 01:38:35.369
And these guys could say America and Scotland.

01:38:37.335 --> 01:38:42.937
These guys could say the opioid crisis and basically murder in Scotland.

01:38:42.957 --> 01:38:44.757
They could say that, but they've never done it.

01:38:44.817 --> 01:38:50.019
Instead, it's like selling books and him giggling and practicing looking cute.

01:38:51.979 --> 01:38:55.460
Yeah, the truth, you know that it's the truth.

01:38:56.801 --> 01:39:00.502
There's something inside that just clicks.

01:39:01.946 --> 01:39:09.995
And when I heard them talking about this, I knew it was the truth, because I'd actually been exposed to this idea in the early days of my undergraduate degree.

01:39:10.476 --> 01:39:16.763
My lecturers in immunology were talking about this concept back when you used to get taught some of the real natural medicine.

01:39:17.263 --> 01:39:18.665
It was still around back then.

01:39:20.578 --> 01:39:23.301
And at the time, I thought, yeah, it's interesting, it makes sense.

01:39:23.962 --> 01:39:33.012
But I was looking at it more from like a terrain germ theory paradigm, like there are germs, they do cause disease, and you've got to build up a strong immune system to protect yourself against these things.

01:39:33.733 --> 01:39:37.177
And I kind of dismissed the idea of terrain theory as the sole

01:39:37.957 --> 01:39:44.342
No, I don't need to play this anymore because you see the point that I was making, right?

01:39:44.422 --> 01:39:45.383
It's one big show.

01:39:45.543 --> 01:39:54.390
Even if this guy's just a unwitting participant, his lack of progress is specifically facilitated by the jackasses that he's surrounded by.

01:39:55.569 --> 01:39:57.811
And so it only takes a few of them to be in on it.

01:39:57.871 --> 01:40:00.314
It only takes a few of them to be in on it.

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:01.875
And then the rest is history.

01:40:02.335 --> 01:40:03.817
It's in a team of performers.

01:40:03.917 --> 01:40:05.318
They're all on the same script.

01:40:05.759 --> 01:40:18.210
And if you do the thought illusion, the thought experiment about why no virus position is a trap, it's number one, because the genetic background noise is an irreducibly complex noise.

01:40:18.991 --> 01:40:27.636
and it is largely composed of bacteria and phages, both of which are definitely real and could explain any contagious phenomenon that occurs.

01:40:28.597 --> 01:40:30.058
And they will not tell you that.

01:40:30.898 --> 01:40:36.301
They will not tell you that we can manufacture large quantities of DNA and it will do biological things.

01:40:36.782 --> 01:40:41.905
They will not tell you that we can use that DNA to manufacture large quantities of RNA that will do things.

01:40:42.525 --> 01:40:47.548
And they will not tell you that a very tiny quantity of that DNA would be a perfect PCR positive.

01:40:49.338 --> 01:40:51.099
So far we have no magic tricks.

01:40:51.159 --> 01:40:52.640
We have no special biology.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:57.223
We have no real special things needed in order for a pandemic to be faked.

01:40:57.303 --> 01:40:58.143
It's all right there.

01:40:58.603 --> 01:41:02.225
And the no virus people have never touched any of these points in six years.

01:41:02.866 --> 01:41:07.769
They will also never tell you that most virology is not fake.

01:41:08.049 --> 01:41:15.073
It is just using cell culture and exposing them to quantities of pure DNA as a proxy for what they call the natural phenomenon.

01:41:16.616 --> 01:41:29.822
That's why the term infectious clones is so important for them to have found already, for them to have explained already, because it buoys their position that coronavirus has to be a mythological biological phenomenon.

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:43.526
but they have been so imprecise and so inaccurate in their progress in understanding this biology and their ability to teach it better that they're still stuck in the same place that they were six years ago.

01:41:43.986 --> 01:41:50.849
And in fact, the only evidence for coronavirus pandemic potential is the biology of remdesivir.

01:41:52.196 --> 01:41:58.859
because it works on the proofreading of coronaviruses, and that is so damning.

01:41:58.919 --> 01:42:05.382
And then the final thing that's damning is that intramuscular injection must be pretty dumb then if there's no contagion, right?

01:42:05.782 --> 01:42:13.386
So why wouldn't we say that from the very beginning, instead write a book and talk in all these vague terms and giggle behind the camera?

01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:14.727
It's just bullshit.

01:42:14.867 --> 01:42:17.008
If you believe what you say you believe,

01:42:17.668 --> 01:42:24.856
They haven't made the progress in action and in words and in understanding that you should have made unless you are a scripted actor.

01:42:24.896 --> 01:42:26.178
And that's what those people are.

01:42:26.678 --> 01:42:31.724
Ladies and gentlemen, it was always a background signal and there was always an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:42:31.804 --> 01:42:32.725
That's the truth.

01:42:33.246 --> 01:42:35.148
You can see it in the population pyramid.

01:42:35.188 --> 01:42:37.471
That's why they have liars in place to lie about it.

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:40.352
It was a national security operation from day one.

01:42:40.832 --> 01:42:42.833
Trump's shooting was probably a theater.

01:42:43.233 --> 01:42:46.254
The mystery of the novel virus was certainly a theater.

01:42:46.614 --> 01:42:49.275
And HHS Secretary of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:49.335 --> 01:42:53.357
is certainly a distraction because America's health is not a priority.

01:42:53.397 --> 01:42:55.398
America's health data is the priority.

01:42:55.818 --> 01:42:58.259
And you can see Trump didn't submit a budget.

01:42:58.299 --> 01:42:59.839
That's how big of a show this is.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.140
Thank you very much for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:02.961
Thanks for being here.

01:43:03.081 --> 01:43:04.121
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:06.122
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:43:06.602 --> 01:43:18.087
Transfection in healthy people was always a crime and the population pyramids are a real problem that you need to understand and understand it as a big biological signal that they misconstrued as spread.

01:43:18.127 --> 01:43:18.827
Thanks for being here.

01:43:18.847 --> 01:43:19.747
See you again tomorrow.

01:43:19.787 --> 01:43:20.868
Tomorrow's Friday!
