WEBVTT

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
He scheduled for 60 minutes next.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
It's embarrassing.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.520
we are approaching the new year ladies and gentlemen and uh yeah I've been

02:27.520 --> 02:31.720
yelling all day in the basketball gym again and what yelling apparently does

02:31.720 --> 02:38.080
to my voice now is it makes it lower so I apologize for this I'm not going to

02:38.080 --> 02:42.280
talk very much I'm going to try and give it a little bit of a break but this is

02:42.280 --> 02:45.440
what I sound like tonight so you're just gonna have to deal with it my name is

02:45.440 --> 02:48.840
Jonathan Couey I used to be a patch clamp physiologist back when I was an

02:48.880 --> 02:54.280
academagician I spent about 20 years doing this the recordings that you make

02:54.280 --> 03:03.560
require you to make a giga-ohm seal a giga-ohm resistance seal and so I

03:03.560 --> 03:07.760
decided to name the stream giga-ohm biological high resistance low noise

03:07.760 --> 03:11.320
information brief welcome to it if this is your first time here I think I have

03:11.320 --> 03:16.200
something on my glasses um we are fighting what I have been trying to

03:16.200 --> 03:20.040
characterize as a Scooby-Doo for American audiences this makes a lot of

03:20.040 --> 03:24.480
sense for other audiences maybe not so much but the gist of it is is that a

03:24.480 --> 03:29.320
bunch of teenagers and their dog have been you know led to believe that

03:29.320 --> 03:32.360
they're solving a big mystery and in the cartoon of course that's what they

03:32.360 --> 03:37.160
really do oftentimes saving small towns from villains that have been scamming

03:37.160 --> 03:41.800
them with monster costumes by catching the monster in a trap and then taking

03:41.800 --> 03:45.680
off their mask we reveal that the rich guy in the town has actually been

03:45.680 --> 03:52.120
ripping everybody off and it's not too far away from that except we've been

03:52.120 --> 03:56.600
fooled into believing that we we needed to solve a mystery a mystery of where

03:56.600 --> 04:01.400
the virus came from or who's responsible for the virus and we feel

04:01.400 --> 04:06.600
somewhat successful at least let me say that the vast majority of people that

04:06.600 --> 04:10.520
that are skilled television watchers feel very successful in having solved

04:10.520 --> 04:15.160
the mystery of the novel virus they're pretty sure that millions of people have

04:15.160 --> 04:18.880
died from it they're pretty sure that millions more have been saved from it

04:18.880 --> 04:23.920
and they're pretty sure the gain of function research is the source of the

04:23.920 --> 04:29.360
virus and even if it wasn't the likelihood of that that the next one is

04:29.360 --> 04:32.840
going to come from gain of functions pretty high because a virus is

04:32.840 --> 04:38.840
definitely going to come again and it's this faith in a novel virus that we are

04:38.840 --> 04:44.680
really trying to break and the reason why I think it's important to be rather

04:44.680 --> 04:48.680
semantically precise is because what we are declaring is that there is a

04:48.680 --> 04:54.880
possibility space a huge realm of possibility that is not considered when

04:54.880 --> 04:58.680
you tell the story of a novel virus for which everyone is vulnerable and we need

04:58.680 --> 05:04.600
to lock down and all this other stuff that they did and so in a lot of ways it is

05:04.600 --> 05:09.840
true there is no virus and that's the reason or that's the foundation for how

05:09.840 --> 05:13.200
this happened but it's more than no virus it's also the fact that they

05:13.240 --> 05:21.640
actually murdered people in order to raise the alarm in order to create a any

05:21.640 --> 05:29.120
vent be it conflated numbers or not an event was created in many different

05:29.120 --> 05:36.840
places on earth in February March and April of 2020 and these local high

05:36.880 --> 05:45.600
casualty events were misconstrued as evidence of spread and so it is not

05:45.600 --> 05:50.080
sufficient to explain what happened in 2020 is saying that there was nothing

05:50.080 --> 05:55.040
there were lots of things that happened lots of data points that need explaining

05:55.040 --> 05:59.480
and so you can't come to this argument without a hypothesis explaining those

05:59.480 --> 06:05.120
data points and so my hypothesis is and I don't think it's that different than

06:05.120 --> 06:09.920
sometimes what you hear out of these no virus people I think that they've been

06:09.920 --> 06:14.560
trying to mislead us about the potential for pandemic in bad caves in

06:14.560 --> 06:20.840
laboratories in animal passage in genetic stitching for many years and I

06:20.840 --> 06:28.120
think now they've all agreed to push and pull on a train and make believe that

06:28.120 --> 06:32.800
this is the source of a pandemic that we just experienced in all agree not to

06:32.800 --> 06:38.320
question the possibility of a worst-case scenario and not to question the

06:38.320 --> 06:43.160
presence of a virus that millions of people were killed by and as long as you

06:43.160 --> 06:46.360
don't question that as long as you don't question the potential worst-case

06:46.360 --> 06:51.720
scenario of a gain-of-function laboratory bioweapon then you are part of this

06:51.720 --> 06:56.480
narrative that is hurting us toward giving up the sovereignty of our

06:56.480 --> 07:06.800
children and I'm afraid that many of the people that were involved behind the

07:06.800 --> 07:14.600
scenes on the internet the intellectual dark web the various people that came

07:14.600 --> 07:18.360
out at different times questioning different parts of the narrative have

07:18.360 --> 07:24.720
always been very careful not to dispel the illusion of consensus not to dispel

07:24.800 --> 07:30.960
the enchantment of the novel virus but to leave it hanging there as sort of an

07:30.960 --> 07:37.440
unquestioned reality and that's what we're describing as that faith in a

07:37.440 --> 07:42.160
novel virus and that's why I think the train you know the the guy who's

07:42.160 --> 07:48.440
faking stopping the train in Italy or wherever he is doing that the idea of a

07:48.440 --> 07:52.440
coordinated effort of lots of people dressed up really nice with lots of

07:52.440 --> 08:03.640
sophisticated mimes and and techniques and and and props could really make you

08:03.640 --> 08:08.000
think that they were involved in stopping and starting the train and in

08:08.000 --> 08:12.040
this case the faith in the novel virus has led us to believe that we've all had

08:12.040 --> 08:17.080
the same experience over the last four years that we all got on this train in

08:17.080 --> 08:22.240
2020 and we rolled it out of the station and that seemed like people were lying

08:22.240 --> 08:25.840
and then before you knew it in the background people were talking about

08:25.840 --> 08:29.960
laboratory leak but Fauci was yelling about it and either what side you took

08:29.960 --> 08:34.680
eventually you've come to the conclusion that wow maybe what we

08:34.680 --> 08:41.160
experienced was a lab leak and maybe it could come again I mean maybe that

08:41.160 --> 08:44.680
explains why they covered it up and that's how they get you into this new

08:44.680 --> 08:48.880
world order that's how they get you into this new world order where

08:48.880 --> 08:56.080
transfection by and transformation by DNA transfection by RNA become pretty

08:56.080 --> 09:00.040
much the norm where experimentation on your children pretty much becomes the

09:00.040 --> 09:07.200
norm because personalized medicine can't be randomized control trial and so

09:07.200 --> 09:11.960
basically in 10 or 15 years when your kids take their kids to the doctor there

09:11.960 --> 09:17.800
won't be anything to trial because they'll just be given stuff to people

09:17.800 --> 09:23.440
based on their whatever the AI computer says is the is the right combination of

09:23.440 --> 09:29.920
drugs or even RNA and DNA transfections that will fix them I'm a little bit

09:29.920 --> 09:36.400
exaggerating there but I'm exaggerating in a way to try and emphasize what a lot

09:36.400 --> 09:40.280
of the people behind the scenes think is inevitable and if you think this is

09:40.320 --> 09:46.680
inevitable then you have to audition to be a leader in this new era of biology

09:46.680 --> 09:50.640
new era of personalized medicine so these people are actually auditioning for

09:50.640 --> 09:56.840
leadership roles after the metamorphosis of our society occurs that's how you

09:56.840 --> 10:02.160
can tell that's really what's happening we have been witnessing the audition

10:02.160 --> 10:10.000
process over the last three years have who can best shepherd the TV watching

10:10.000 --> 10:15.920
masses into this new world order from either side of the aisle you want to

10:15.920 --> 10:21.160
compete for the the politician side where you stick to that you know whole game

10:21.160 --> 10:27.240
you want to do the social media side and the podcast side and that side and

10:27.240 --> 10:32.080
everybody's auditioning for the new world order what's coming and when it

10:32.080 --> 10:38.080
comes the the internet will be limited by digital ID and all of these people of

10:38.080 --> 10:45.160
course will be happy to do it or have some excuse why it's okay and then it'll

10:45.160 --> 10:51.520
almost all be over don't be surprised how many of these people actually go

10:51.520 --> 10:57.600
along with it the whole way so I'm gonna escape out of here and I'm going to play

10:57.600 --> 11:03.800
this movie it is on 1.5 speed we are watching Alex Zeck and David Martin

11:03.800 --> 11:09.320
talk about all things pandemic this came out I believe in July 21, 2023 I

11:09.320 --> 11:14.520
promise I'm gonna try very very hard not to stop the movie as much as I

11:14.520 --> 11:19.280
possibly can and in fact I hope that I'm gonna take a lot of notes and stop it

11:19.280 --> 11:23.800
only a couple times because I'd like it to be over in about an hour so here we

11:23.800 --> 11:27.800
go ladies and gentlemen let's just do this

11:33.800 --> 11:54.320
welcome everyone to another episode of the way forward I hope others there's

11:54.320 --> 11:57.680
like 50 or so people tuning in live right now probably have a few more

11:57.680 --> 11:59.560
trickling but I hope you're also tuning in to the end of covid because that

11:59.560 --> 12:03.000
material that we've compiled is extremely important to ensure that we're

12:03.000 --> 12:05.840
properly informed on what happened over the last three and a half years so we

12:05.840 --> 12:08.040
can share this nonsense does not happen again I'm really looking forward to

12:08.040 --> 12:12.120
this conversation with Dr. David Martin David how's it going it's great to be

12:12.120 --> 12:15.400
here Alec thank you for having this this venue yeah thanks for being here so I

12:15.400 --> 12:18.840
heard from from little birdie that you've been on an expedition to Antarctica

12:18.840 --> 12:23.360
before I have I have indeed and not only did I go on an expedition to Antarctica I

12:23.360 --> 12:26.840
was the one that was asked to be the primary content provider for the

12:26.840 --> 12:32.720
expedition and among other things I had the phenomenal joy of meeting a

12:33.200 --> 12:37.480
very tall beautiful Australian woman on the ship who came up to me after one of

12:37.480 --> 12:41.040
my extremely poignant conversations with the group and said I'm clearly the

12:41.040 --> 12:44.160
alpha female in this boat you're clearly the alpha male I should find you

12:44.160 --> 12:47.720
attractive but I don't and in a few weeks time that woman and I will be

12:47.720 --> 12:51.040
celebrating our anniversary we've been together now for eight years and so yes

12:51.040 --> 12:54.280
not only did I go to Antarctica but I came home with the woman with whom I am

12:54.280 --> 12:56.840
navigating this amazing thing called life and having a great time doing

12:56.840 --> 12:59.680
awesome that's incredible not many people can say they met their partner in

13:00.040 --> 13:02.680
Antarctica so now as a matter of fact I don't know if there's anyone who can't

13:02.680 --> 13:06.040
actually not that I know it's not it's not a common pickup line and it's

13:06.040 --> 13:08.480
certainly not a common place to have that pickup line side but now you know it's

13:08.480 --> 13:12.000
a fascinating she she was as as many people know Kim is is aluminous being

13:12.000 --> 13:16.120
and what she was meaning to say was that if I kind of got my shit straightened

13:16.120 --> 13:20.000
out I would be far more attractive than the morose philosophical soul that I

13:20.000 --> 13:23.200
was that she heard speaking and it turns out that having a beautiful Australian

13:23.200 --> 13:27.040
companion to help make life joyful is a great way of not being as despondent

13:27.040 --> 13:31.120
so there you go she was right up over into deeper into a heart space at that

13:31.120 --> 13:34.920
point then now I listen I've done a lot of things around the world and I've seen

13:34.920 --> 13:38.080
a lot of the unfortunate experiences of what we have come to accept as humanity

13:38.080 --> 13:41.860
and whether that plays out in the microcosm of at that time a very a very

13:41.860 --> 13:46.120
challenging relationship or whether it comes on the back of dealing with

13:46.120 --> 13:48.920
genocide in Papua New Guinea where you know we win a conviction against one of

13:48.920 --> 13:51.800
the largest corporations ever found guilty of genocide only to have it

13:51.800 --> 13:55.800
overturned because of jurisdictional issues you know when you keep seeing

13:55.800 --> 13:59.040
how corrupt the system is and how prolific that corruption is sometimes it

13:59.040 --> 14:01.920
has a way of getting under your skin yeah and Kim met me at a period of my life

14:01.920 --> 14:06.080
where I think I was overloaded with the with the amount of corruption going on

14:06.080 --> 14:10.240
so anyhow it's been a lot more fun to be with a person who her soundtrack is

14:10.240 --> 14:14.640
80s music her favorite thing to do is dance and it just makes life a little bit

14:14.640 --> 14:19.360
more more enjoyable at every turn that's awesome incredible quick question on

14:19.360 --> 14:21.720
Antarctica too were you able to circumnavigate the continent in that trip

14:21.720 --> 14:26.560
no we were we were in we flew out of Chile we were in the military transport

14:26.560 --> 14:31.920
from from Punta Arenas in southern Chile at the Straits Magellan and what we did

14:31.920 --> 14:36.720
was we went down the that very long ismess that's on Antarctica down past

14:36.720 --> 14:39.400
deception island the active volcano down there which very few people know about

14:39.400 --> 14:44.660
across the Antarctic circle and went down to the edge of the ice and then came

14:44.660 --> 14:47.960
back so that long prominence that you see on the maps of Antarctica we we kind of

14:47.960 --> 14:50.960
traversed as far as the ice would let us go were they pretty restricted on where

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
you could go to like so-called authorities I guess well there's no real I

14:54.000 --> 14:58.880
mean listen we we got off the plane in a military base which you know allegedly

14:58.880 --> 15:02.240
according to the official charter that established Antarctica there's not

15:02.240 --> 15:05.360
supposed to be any military bases there we got off on a military base on military

15:05.360 --> 15:08.960
aircraft so there is that little oops about the official narrative and we were

15:08.960 --> 15:11.960
told not to take pictures of the airbase I have many of them including a C-130

15:11.960 --> 15:17.800
that was stuck in the ice but beyond the actual point of departure there was

15:17.800 --> 15:23.240
really no security anywhere ever I mean we met two Brits at Port La Croix who

15:23.240 --> 15:26.120
are stationed at the weather weather observation station where lightning

15:26.120 --> 15:28.640
strikes are recorded but besides that they were the only two people that we

15:28.640 --> 15:32.360
encountered anywhere on any of the continental Antarctica well yeah I have a

15:32.360 --> 15:35.840
lot of fascination with Antarctica trying to figure out the the true nature of

15:35.840 --> 15:38.840
this realm if you will try to figure out what you know it's it's I'll tell you

15:38.840 --> 15:43.680
that the answer is on the on the cruise we had the gentleman from Australia who

15:43.720 --> 15:49.160
is twice crossed unaided cross the point-to-point and Arctic set the record for

15:49.160 --> 15:52.880
the fastest unaided crossing and you know it's fascinating when you talk to

15:52.880 --> 15:56.520
Jeff about his experience there's a whole lot of things about the

15:56.520 --> 16:00.520
conversation where you just sit there you know kind of going first of all I

16:00.520 --> 16:04.680
wouldn't want to spend that much time in sub 40 below sub 60 below temperatures

16:04.680 --> 16:08.160
but like the Arctic explorations you know if you go back and you look at the

16:08.160 --> 16:11.000
Arctic explorations there's an enormous amount of things that happen when you

16:11.040 --> 16:14.440
are in that kind of austere environment where orientation becomes a challenge

16:14.440 --> 16:18.560
you know a lot of things just become a challenge and so I think like a lot of

16:18.560 --> 16:21.400
places on earth you know the more you know if you're really honest with

16:21.400 --> 16:23.520
yourself the less you know because you actually have more questions than you

16:23.520 --> 16:27.720
get answers which is kind of my approach to life is you know keep exploring

16:27.720 --> 16:31.040
because there's always a deeper question that you didn't think to ask yeah that's

16:31.040 --> 16:34.560
kind of the you know let me let me preface this by saying and this will kind of

16:34.560 --> 16:39.000
lead to the rest of our conversation I was a statist I was an army officer I you

16:39.040 --> 16:42.800
know went to West Point I believe that my wife's autoimmune conditions that she

16:42.800 --> 16:45.920
previously have that she no longer has any trace of now for seven years were

16:45.920 --> 16:49.360
caused by in part by Epstein bar virus and all these things I'm saying

16:49.360 --> 16:53.400
contextually because when you set aside your preconceived notions and simply

16:53.400 --> 16:57.960
explore what is true obviously you're gonna have some bias there yeah you find

16:57.960 --> 17:02.160
that we meaning the human race don't know shit yeah lack of better time you

17:02.160 --> 17:07.320
we don't know shit and I am very wary of both authorities and especially

17:07.320 --> 17:13.040
authorities who claim with a level of certainty to know that X thing is D

17:13.040 --> 17:17.040
thing and this is how X behaves and how this is what X produces and this is the

17:17.040 --> 17:22.120
phenomenon that is caused by X etc etc so so I want to just jump right in I

17:22.120 --> 17:25.200
think I'll ask just a very direct question what is your take on SARS-CoV-2

17:25.200 --> 17:29.880
and viruses in general so two separate things that the the question of SARS-CoV-2

17:29.880 --> 17:34.000
is there is no question in my mind that people who had every intention of

17:34.040 --> 17:37.600
disrupting and harming humanity and people who had every intention of

17:37.600 --> 17:40.280
building things that would ultimately toxify the environment to make human

17:40.280 --> 17:43.960
life more unattainable so that they could have greater control used a series

17:43.960 --> 17:48.520
of biological weapons creation efforts to create a branded terror campaign a

17:48.520 --> 17:52.760
branded terror campaign was a campaign that included the term SARS-CoV-2 which

17:52.760 --> 17:56.560
was a term that was necessary because they had declared SARS-CoV-1

17:56.560 --> 18:00.000
eradicated and it kind of sucks if you're gonna try to sell a fear narrative to

18:00.000 --> 18:02.720
go the thing that we said was eradicated is back because that would suggest that

18:02.720 --> 18:06.280
science that declared it eradicated was wrong and obviously you can't do that if

18:06.280 --> 18:10.160
you're trying to run a terror campaign so SARS-CoV-2 was a branding campaign

18:10.160 --> 18:15.040
conducted during the month of February in 2020 the ICTV which was the

18:15.040 --> 18:17.880
International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses published on March the 2nd

18:17.880 --> 18:22.600
2020 their official brand that said that there was quote a novel pathogen that

18:22.600 --> 18:25.760
novel pathogen was going to be branded SARS-CoV-2 so that we were ethnically

18:25.760 --> 18:29.660
you know allegedly ethnically sensitive to Chinese and that there was a quote

18:29.660 --> 18:35.220
disease in their words caused in their words by this thing they branded the

18:35.220 --> 18:38.460
disease COVID-19 but they were very clear to stipulate that there was no

18:38.460 --> 18:42.380
disease it was a set of symptoms and those symptoms were commonly associated

18:42.380 --> 18:45.020
with influenza like illness and have been associated with influenza like

18:45.020 --> 18:49.100
illness for elimination of symptoms that are not years so so this idea that it

18:49.100 --> 18:54.020
was quote a novel disease was a branding campaign and so let's stipulate for this

18:54.020 --> 18:59.460
conversation that the entirety of the last four years was a premeditated act of

18:59.500 --> 19:03.620
domestic and international terrorism and most importantly the perpetrators admitted

19:03.620 --> 19:08.300
to that very fact in 2015 they said they were going to make an event where the

19:08.300 --> 19:12.540
media hype would drive the public to demand a medical countermeasure called a

19:12.540 --> 19:17.220
vaccine so for for that the the unambiguous nature of what this is it was

19:17.220 --> 19:20.540
domestic and international terrorism it was collusion it was racketeering in

19:20.540 --> 19:23.460
2015 they actually stipulated that they were going to commit the crime in 2015

19:23.460 --> 19:27.060
and they executed the crime on schedule the second piece of your question is

19:27.060 --> 19:30.180
actually a much more difficult one simply because we're dealing with a piece

19:30.180 --> 19:33.540
of terminology that has morphed since it was introduced in the 14th century

19:33.540 --> 19:40.580
so far as virus means in Proto-Italian means poison do I believe there are

19:40.580 --> 19:43.460
poisons in the world the answer is unambiguously yes and the reason is

19:43.460 --> 19:47.140
because I've had poisons injected into me and I know that the poisons had an

19:47.140 --> 19:49.700
effect which was the desired effect so insofar as do we believe there are

19:49.700 --> 19:53.380
poisons absolutely there are and there's no question that poisons are in fact

19:53.380 --> 19:56.980
sometimes accidental and sometimes intentionally introduced to cause

19:56.980 --> 20:02.300
incapacitation or death yeah in so far as is there a micro particle coming up

20:02.300 --> 20:07.180
into the 18th century is there a micro particle involved in the causation of

20:07.180 --> 20:12.100
disease that we then now rebrand and by the way once again it's branding we

20:12.100 --> 20:16.660
rebrand a virus and we then try through the cunning use of language to subtly

20:16.660 --> 20:21.780
replace the actual multi-century use of that term which is poison which there is

20:22.420 --> 20:28.020
for a causative agent of anything the answer is absolutely not causation

20:28.020 --> 20:33.220
which was invented in 1663 very specifically causation is an illusion

20:33.220 --> 20:37.860
of the intellectually lazy the idea that we can identify out of the plurality

20:37.860 --> 20:41.540
of conditions in the universe every single factor that creates

20:41.540 --> 20:45.860
the condition giving rise to a thing is as hubris filled and delusional

20:45.860 --> 20:48.820
as the council of Nicaea was in the fourth century trying to pretend that they

20:48.900 --> 20:52.820
could take the infinite of the divine and dictate in a couple paragraphs the

20:52.820 --> 20:53.780
sum total of what it meant

20:59.220 --> 21:02.660
the idea that we can identify out of the plurality of conditions in the

21:02.660 --> 21:07.540
universe every single factor that creates the condition giving rise to a thing

21:07.540 --> 21:11.460
is as hubris filled and delusional as the council of Nicaea was in the fourth

21:11.460 --> 21:14.580
century trying to pretend that they could take the infinite of the divine

21:14.580 --> 21:17.860
and dictate in a couple paragraphs the sum total of what it meant to have

21:17.860 --> 21:22.020
religion this idea that we can be reductionist to the point of stupidity

21:22.020 --> 21:26.180
where we decide that we are going to pick the ontology and the frame in which

21:26.180 --> 21:28.660
we're going to understand nature and then have the audacity

21:28.660 --> 21:32.580
of saying we're going to get to causation is beyond the pale of idiocy

21:32.580 --> 21:35.380
and it's important for people in this conversation understand that when

21:35.380 --> 21:39.620
Gottfried Liebens in 1663 published his dissertation which gave us modern

21:39.620 --> 21:42.580
regression it's important to realize that in the same year two important

21:42.580 --> 21:45.460
things happen we actually were doing heretic

21:45.460 --> 21:49.700
witch and heretic burning trials in europe and the guy who wrote

21:49.700 --> 21:53.380
the fundamental mathematics behind which causation regression is derived

21:53.380 --> 21:56.340
was a Lutheran being sponsored by catholics

21:56.340 --> 21:59.940
in a town where people were being burnt for being Lutheran so let's be

21:59.940 --> 22:02.900
abundantly clear that there was a tiny motivation for a guy to come up with

22:02.900 --> 22:06.180
an explanation for causality which he was commissioned to do by catholics

22:06.180 --> 22:08.260
so that he didn't get himself burned at the stake

22:08.260 --> 22:11.140
by the exact same people who were paying him and if we actually understood that

22:11.140 --> 22:14.820
causal regression is the derivative of that and every single thing we call

22:14.820 --> 22:17.700
medicine and science right now is a direct derivative

22:17.700 --> 22:20.580
of a fallacy that was established and published in 1663 if we understood

22:20.580 --> 22:22.900
that we'd be having a different conversation

22:22.900 --> 22:25.620
got it so just just to be clear here so when we're talking about a virus i'm

22:25.620 --> 22:28.180
not talking about the previous definition of poison i'm talking about

22:28.180 --> 22:31.380
a tiny replication competent obligate intracellular parasite consisting of

22:31.380 --> 22:35.060
a genome surrounded by a protein coke that is an infected all bullshit 100

22:35.060 --> 22:38.580
percent bullshit everything that 100 percent bullshit for a simple reason

22:38.580 --> 22:43.060
beginning in 1768 and moving up until its codification in 1869

22:43.060 --> 22:46.180
1870 we took a world that once upon a time was

22:46.180 --> 22:48.820
described largely through natural philosophy and frequencies and we

22:48.820 --> 22:51.380
decided to turn it into a world defined by chemistry

22:51.380 --> 22:54.980
agree and here's where the problem kicks in when men to live created the what we

22:54.980 --> 22:59.220
now refer to as the periodic table he took upon himself the idea that

22:59.220 --> 23:02.740
somehow or another chemistry was the descriptor of life

23:02.740 --> 23:06.660
and every word you just use to describe what we think we call viruses today

23:06.660 --> 23:10.660
is derived from a chemical mediated model of a system that by definition is not

23:10.740 --> 23:14.420
chemical so in so far as do those words exist

23:14.420 --> 23:17.060
yes i mean when i got my piece of the thing does the thing exist do the

23:17.060 --> 23:19.380
things that so that is the common definition of

23:19.380 --> 23:22.020
viruses in virology do those things exist as physical

23:22.020 --> 23:23.940
particles and is there proof that they cause disease

23:23.940 --> 23:26.980
well see that's the problem that the the causal question

23:26.980 --> 23:29.620
is by its definition let's let's set that aside then is there is there

23:29.620 --> 23:32.180
sufficient proof that those exist in the fluids of a sick person

23:32.180 --> 23:36.020
there was once again can we measure something in something

23:36.020 --> 23:39.060
the answer is if we're looking for a thing we can find a thing

23:39.060 --> 23:41.540
anywhere that's the nature of regression based science

23:41.540 --> 23:44.500
regression based on a clause i'm sorry genuine question is there proof that

23:44.500 --> 23:47.300
Santa Claus exists there's no question i can go to a shopping mall right now

23:47.300 --> 23:49.380
well not right now but i can go to a shopping mall in december

23:49.380 --> 23:52.420
and if a Santa Claus is defined by a fat man in a red suit then the answer is

23:52.420 --> 23:54.820
yes they come okay if Santa Claus is defined as a man who comes down your

23:54.820 --> 23:57.140
chimney and delivers presence and flies on a

23:57.140 --> 24:00.500
i think that's called jeffrey Epstein yes yeah i got you but is there in in that

24:00.500 --> 24:02.740
case then what we're talking about is things the existence of

24:02.740 --> 24:05.380
right but here's probably that that's where we get trapped and that's where we

24:05.380 --> 24:08.100
will not get trapped in this conversation because here's the thing

24:08.100 --> 24:10.980
if i'm looking for the higs boson i can go out and i can create a multi-billion

24:10.980 --> 24:13.460
dollar device i can smash what i call high energy

24:13.460 --> 24:16.820
particles into an observation screen i can derive from it a bug splat

24:16.820 --> 24:20.420
and i can say look i found the alleged god particle except for the fact

24:20.420 --> 24:23.540
that when they did that and spent billions of dollars of things looking

24:23.540 --> 24:26.100
for a thing what they found was something other than what they were looking for

24:26.100 --> 24:28.500
and so they decided to go back and fix the machine

24:28.500 --> 24:32.260
and allic this is where the problem lives if i decide to tear the world apart

24:32.260 --> 24:35.140
and try to look for the smallest atomic particle i can find

24:35.140 --> 24:39.220
it anywhere so is there a thing somewhere

24:39.220 --> 24:41.700
the answer is of course there are there are tons of particles and if we

24:41.700 --> 24:45.220
destroy nature and take it down to its destructive limits

24:45.220 --> 24:50.020
i can find anything in anything that's the problem the problem is in 1663 the

24:50.020 --> 24:53.300
disputation on separation which gave rise to the entirety of regression

24:53.300 --> 24:55.860
science said that the way to understand the world is to take it down

24:55.860 --> 24:58.020
particle by particle to get to the smallest particle and no

24:58.020 --> 25:01.460
no surprise we get to this thing we call a virus and we go oh there's a particle

25:01.460 --> 25:03.940
in it's with sick people yeah but is there's some proof that they

25:04.020 --> 25:07.780
actually exist as concrete things i can actually

25:07.780 --> 25:10.900
find the dimension of a definition which i can say look i found the thing i'm

25:10.900 --> 25:12.500
saying the dimension no what do you mean by that

25:12.500 --> 25:15.860
because every observation is based on the preconditions of the moment in

25:15.860 --> 25:18.340
which that observation is formed and as the observer you are defining the

25:18.340 --> 25:21.380
analyte the observation condition and you're that you're defining your own

25:21.380 --> 25:23.380
sense of verification that you found the thing you were looking for so

25:23.380 --> 25:27.300
what you were looking for is a phallus correct so i i'm well aware that like

25:27.300 --> 25:29.860
when we talk about the application of the scientific method when we're looking

25:29.860 --> 25:32.340
at an observed natural phenomenon and attempting to ascertain what is the

25:32.340 --> 25:35.220
cause of that observed natural phenomenon there is it's yes i agree it's

25:35.220 --> 25:38.100
almost leaning on futile i completely agree because there's so many factors

25:38.100 --> 25:40.020
that are at play but when we're talking about a thing

25:40.020 --> 25:43.220
as if it is a concrete thing and then assigning terms like

25:43.220 --> 25:47.780
biological weapon or how are we messing with that biological weapon is that

25:47.780 --> 25:53.300
is defined under 18 us code section 175 okay now does that mean it exists

25:53.300 --> 25:55.700
who knows what it means is there's a legal definition for it

25:55.700 --> 25:58.340
okay there's not a legal definition for virus

25:58.340 --> 26:01.940
just like there now is about a dozen definitions for vaccine

26:01.940 --> 26:06.580
and by the way none of them i thought i would just interject here for a second

26:06.580 --> 26:11.540
so um i don't really know how to how to

26:11.540 --> 26:14.580
vocalize really how shocking this video is

26:14.580 --> 26:20.900
um how obvious it should be that neither of these two i though i i

26:20.900 --> 26:24.100
actually commend allic for trying a little hard he's

26:24.100 --> 26:28.900
trying but he's he's missing something absolutely

26:28.900 --> 26:31.620
gigantic

26:35.860 --> 26:39.140
i want you to think about the fact that you

26:39.140 --> 26:45.540
absolutely positively have not heard the words remdesivir

26:45.540 --> 26:49.940
medazalam ventilators antibiotic steroids do not resuscitate

26:49.940 --> 26:54.100
orders financial incentives who you haven't heard

26:54.100 --> 26:59.060
anything about this and i realized last night

26:59.060 --> 27:04.260
actually this morning after reviewing my video from yesterday which is just

27:04.260 --> 27:11.700
an absolute jog or not of a video i realized that there's one thing

27:12.500 --> 27:16.340
there's one thing that they accomplish with this

27:16.340 --> 27:20.180
one really weird thing that they accomplish here

27:20.180 --> 27:25.940
with this thing that they always do it they always do the same thing

27:25.940 --> 27:30.660
they always say that the root cause the justification

27:30.660 --> 27:36.020
for the vaccines is the virus

27:36.420 --> 27:40.340
that's so not right but they say it all the time

27:40.340 --> 27:45.060
actually christine massy said it that why do you why do you

27:45.060 --> 27:49.300
perpetuate the the core narrative upon which

27:49.300 --> 27:53.460
the justification for these for everything is based all the lockdowns

27:53.460 --> 28:01.220
everything is based on the virus no no it's not

28:01.220 --> 28:06.100
it's actually based on people following orders

28:06.100 --> 28:12.180
people being scared people being made to be frightened made

28:12.180 --> 28:17.140
to use these things and made to believe that this were that these were the

28:17.140 --> 28:21.380
choices don't use antibiotics steroids don't really work

28:21.380 --> 28:25.060
make sure that you realize that nobody needs to be resuscitated if you pick

28:25.060 --> 28:28.340
them up and if you go to their house with an ambulance

28:28.340 --> 28:32.020
make sure you use medazalam on those old people in the uk

28:32.020 --> 28:35.620
and make sure you keep giving remdesivir to everybody and don't worry it doesn't

28:35.620 --> 28:38.900
hurt them at all none of the none of the

28:38.900 --> 28:44.420
potential decline in the well-being of your patients could possibly be due to

28:44.420 --> 28:48.180
the administration of remdesivir and alic

28:48.180 --> 28:53.220
zak in america this is one of the biggest plays there was

28:53.220 --> 28:57.460
another really huge thing is the opioid epidemic right

28:57.460 --> 29:01.220
nobody's ever going to mention that in this video either not even once that just

29:01.220 --> 29:05.540
say that some of those deaths might be used to pad the

29:05.540 --> 29:09.780
covid numbers why not say all of them

29:10.420 --> 29:15.060
are we in such a state of normalization of the

29:15.060 --> 29:20.100
opioid epidemic that they don't count as excess deaths

29:20.100 --> 29:24.740
seriously are they already part of the average

29:24.740 --> 29:29.700
because i think when people are 40 years old and they die of a acute

29:29.700 --> 29:35.460
overdose of a of a pharmaceutical grade opioid that that's that's pretty

29:35.460 --> 29:38.420
significant and that's not really something that we should be including

29:38.420 --> 29:42.420
in our normal statistics which is really what jessica hockett is

29:42.420 --> 29:44.980
is really

29:44.980 --> 29:47.940
is the point that she's making when she says she doesn't like all-cause

29:47.940 --> 29:53.860
mortality because all-cause mortality is a mathematical model

29:53.860 --> 30:00.340
mathematical projection of a pattern and the more

30:00.340 --> 30:04.580
data you feed to it in theory the better the prediction can become but it is

30:04.580 --> 30:08.980
still in a lot of ways all-cause mortality tends to

30:08.980 --> 30:16.660
let's say normalize i guess that's the best word it normalizes

30:16.660 --> 30:19.940
let's say unnecessary causes of death

30:19.940 --> 30:22.900
you know all the

30:24.100 --> 30:27.460
all the ways that young adults die all the ways that

30:27.460 --> 30:31.860
that that people die in an unintentional way now if you throw

30:31.860 --> 30:35.460
in something like opioids where the street is flooded with them

30:35.460 --> 30:41.060
and all of these vulnerable people are vulnerable to them

30:41.060 --> 30:46.340
and those people were not expected to die but now year-on-year they are dying

30:46.340 --> 30:50.180
if you feed the last five years into that model and make a projection of all

30:50.180 --> 30:53.940
cause mortality essentially all those opioid deaths every year start to

30:53.940 --> 31:00.500
become part of the average and only those opioid deaths which clear that

31:00.500 --> 31:04.500
all-cause mortality prediction become excess deaths

31:04.500 --> 31:08.420
and so it can be used to their advantage of course

31:08.420 --> 31:12.180
just like the predictions of the model can be of the model of

31:12.180 --> 31:15.540
viral spread was used to their advantage and they just said that you know these

31:15.540 --> 31:19.460
are the worst case scenarios and we've got to avoid them and look we avoided

31:19.460 --> 31:21.700
them

31:23.780 --> 31:27.380
but i want you to notice this because i would be willing to bet that we can

31:27.380 --> 31:30.420
leave this they'll just leave this list here

31:30.420 --> 31:34.820
and we'll put little tally marks every time they mention anything we could

31:34.820 --> 31:40.100
even just go we could just use the word protocol

31:41.460 --> 31:44.580
they can just mention protocols and that would already be good what else

31:44.580 --> 31:49.380
should we have here on this list that they're never going to touch

31:49.540 --> 31:54.180
in in an hour and 20 minute interview they're never going to touch any of this

31:54.180 --> 31:58.580
and so what they're doing is essentially trying to make the inverted or the

31:58.580 --> 32:02.660
i don't know if it's an inverted argument but it's an incorrect argument

32:02.660 --> 32:09.140
that the idea of the novel virus and it that it was isolated and that it was

32:09.140 --> 32:15.140
purified is the reason why we have all these pandemic measures all these

32:15.140 --> 32:20.180
things happened and what they're lying about and why the shot is coming out

32:20.180 --> 32:26.420
that is that is wrong the reason why we got away with this is because of all

32:26.420 --> 32:29.780
of these things right here

32:30.740 --> 32:36.660
all of these things that caused the excess deaths during 2020 and 2021

32:36.660 --> 32:45.380
that then was misconstrued as a spreading pathogen instead of spreading bad ideas

32:45.860 --> 32:50.260
and so the bad idea is not the pathogen well maybe it is in a way

32:52.820 --> 32:58.420
but you need to explain the ramifications of that and not focus at all costs and in a lot of ways

32:58.420 --> 33:04.020
you know the the martin guy makes some some pertinent arguments but it's not like how michael

33:04.020 --> 33:07.380
yead makes the pertinent argument where you can just say you know i'm not smart enough

33:08.500 --> 33:13.460
and i don't have access to the kind of laboratory procedures that are necessary to really get down

33:13.460 --> 33:17.540
to the nitty gritty about whether or not there are really viruses or not or what's there at that

33:17.540 --> 33:27.380
size scale but i know that these things happened and these things allowed people to lie about the

33:27.380 --> 33:38.820
existence of a pandemic that's what i know and that's what i know they don't ever say that's what i know

33:38.820 --> 33:43.540
they'd never say they just don't say this stuff they don't say that there was no evidence

33:51.460 --> 33:55.060
why don't they say there was no evidence of spread how come that doesn't ever come out of their

33:55.060 --> 33:59.860
mouths let's go let's listen it's got to be better right it's got to be better

33:59.860 --> 34:09.140
going all the way back to pestor who falsified his own data on his anthrax vaccine so let's

34:09.140 --> 34:11.860
be abundantly clear even when we started falling vaccines vaccines we were lying then so we're

34:11.860 --> 34:16.580
still lying now but the issue is actually on his a dozen definitions for vaccine and by the way

34:16.580 --> 34:21.380
none of them going all the way back to pestor who falsified his own data on his anthrax vaccine

34:21.380 --> 34:24.340
so let's be abundantly clear even when we started falling vaccines vaccines we were lying then so

34:24.340 --> 34:28.820
we're still lying now but the issue is actually one where historical relevance and the language

34:28.820 --> 34:33.340
definition is simple. If what I'm saying is that I have taken a fragment of a living

34:33.340 --> 34:40.020
system, ricin, as a wonderful example, it's plant-derived, right? There's nothing about

34:40.020 --> 34:44.860
ricin that is harmful to humans when it's in long pods hanging from trees. But I can

34:44.860 --> 34:48.300
take something from those long pods, I can synthesize it, I can purify it, I can spray

34:48.300 --> 34:53.020
it into a subway system, and I can kill people. That is a biological weapon. That is a weapon

34:53.020 --> 34:54.020
derived from biology.

34:54.020 --> 34:58.380
Great. And with respect to viruses, though, you're saying that there's not sufficient

34:58.380 --> 35:01.780
proof that they exist as entities, yet, as an example in your speech of the European

35:01.780 --> 35:05.540
Parliament, you said, and I quote, we've been engineering this pathogen for 56 years in

35:05.540 --> 35:09.420
1966. The very first model was used as a transatlantic biological experiment. SARS-1

35:09.420 --> 35:13.540
O3 came from a laboratory in Chapel Hill, infectious replication, defective clone of

35:13.540 --> 35:16.380
a coronavirus, et cetera, et cetera. So how do we wrestle with you first saying that

35:16.380 --> 35:18.380
there's no proof of these things?

35:18.380 --> 35:21.620
And this is the point, Alec, and this is why I said that, you know, the last time this

35:21.620 --> 35:24.660
conversation meaningfully took place, probably, was somewhere between...

35:24.660 --> 35:28.500
And the bill, the 1660, proved that they exist as entities, yet, as an example in your

35:28.500 --> 35:31.540
speech of the European Parliament, you said, and I quote, we've been engineering this pathogen

35:31.540 --> 35:36.800
for 56 years in 1966. The very first model was used as a transatlantic biological experiment.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.460
SARS-1 O3 came from a laboratory in Chapel Hill, an infectious replication, defective

35:40.460 --> 35:41.460
clone.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.460
Okay.

35:42.460 --> 36:09.220
I think you heard it right that one's this one right infectious replication defective

36:09.220 --> 36:13.820
clone I think is what was just said there so apparently that's something that

36:13.820 --> 36:18.040
he said in the parliament at some point I'm just gonna play it again one more

36:18.040 --> 36:21.660
time to make sure that we heard it right

36:23.580 --> 36:27.700
a clone of a coronavirus etcetera so how logical do viruses that is a

36:27.700 --> 36:31.780
biological weapon that is a weapon derived from biology great and with

36:31.780 --> 36:35.180
respect to viruses though you're here saying that there's not sufficient proof

36:35.180 --> 36:38.360
that they exist as entities yet as an example in your speech the European

36:38.360 --> 36:41.060
parliament you said and I quote we've been engineering this pathogen for

36:41.060 --> 36:45.320
fifty-six years in 1966 the very first model was used as a trained biological

36:45.320 --> 36:48.640
experiment SARS-1-03 came from a laboratory in Chapel Hill that's

36:48.640 --> 36:51.060
a infectious replication defective clone of a coronavirus etcetera etcetera so

36:51.060 --> 36:54.200
how do we wrestle with you first saying that there's no proof of these things

36:54.200 --> 36:57.800
and this is this is the point I like and this is why I said that you know the

36:57.800 --> 37:00.560
last time this conversation meaningfully took place probably was somewhere

37:00.560 --> 37:03.240
between the Council of Nicene and the Council of Kaldia in the fourth and

37:03.240 --> 37:07.240
fifth centuries that the problem that you have in this conversation is we're

37:07.240 --> 37:11.000
not having a conversation about apples and apples what I'm referring to

37:11.000 --> 37:14.600
there is I'm using the terms associated with the documents that I'm reciting

37:14.600 --> 37:19.000
that is not David Martin's position that is actually the reported document that

37:19.000 --> 37:22.080
is no different from saying that I'm actually quoting 18 us but you say we

37:22.080 --> 37:24.880
would say we which is implying that you are a part of that which is implying

37:24.880 --> 37:28.800
that it's not that's a colloquial we we are responsible as a human race for

37:28.800 --> 37:30.960
allowing things to happen you just described the fact that you served in

37:30.960 --> 37:34.320
the military I would know more suggest to you that as a member of the military

37:34.320 --> 37:38.600
you are the we collectively which in fact are there's a shitload of things

37:38.600 --> 37:41.800
that are done by the military that I have nothing but contempt and have

37:41.800 --> 37:46.000
absolute reprehensible its sensitivities around but if I actually said we I mean

37:46.000 --> 37:50.520
that as a nation we fund and we support a military that has been used sometimes

37:50.520 --> 37:53.120
for very beneficial purpose and sometimes for horrible purposes and the

37:53.120 --> 37:55.680
collective we is a statement of accountability which all of us are

37:55.680 --> 37:59.280
responsible for every single person who funded NIH that's every taxpayer in

37:59.280 --> 38:03.000
America paid for the weaponization of nature when you when you say that though

38:03.000 --> 38:06.240
what do you mean by weaponization of nature as as an example very simple let

38:06.240 --> 38:10.320
me finish real quick as an example I've done a deep dive as a doctor's Tom

38:10.320 --> 38:13.560
Cowan doctor Andy Kauffman doctor Amanda Volmer doctors Martin Sam Bailey

38:13.560 --> 38:16.600
Dr. Stefanos Koglio and several others into the so-called gain of function

38:16.600 --> 38:19.720
experiments and they're based in again unproven pseudoscientific presuppositions

38:19.720 --> 38:23.040
using models whether so you agree that there's not sufficient proof that they're

38:23.040 --> 38:28.640
actually weaponizing a virus so purification of an agent of harm or

38:28.640 --> 38:32.440
death is in fact a weaponization as defined by 18 us code yeah but what is

38:32.440 --> 38:35.320
I'm not saying and this is the trap that Tom Cowan and others get into and

38:35.320 --> 38:38.960
Tom Cowan took this cute little pot shot but once again has zero integrity in

38:38.960 --> 38:41.320
having an honest conversation about what this is about I'm having an honest

38:41.320 --> 38:43.440
conversation with you right now it's a very simple conversation and the

38:43.440 --> 38:48.880
conversation is this if you derive a synthetic process stimulated by a

38:48.880 --> 38:52.180
chemical you found in a naturally occurring phenomenon that synthesis

38:52.180 --> 38:55.240
chemical on the ceiling or meaning the nucleic acids plated by honest into and

38:55.240 --> 38:58.840
Tom Cowan took this cute little pot shot but once again has zero integrity in

38:58.840 --> 39:00.960
having an honest conversation about what this is about this is having an

39:00.960 --> 39:03.240
honest conversation with you right now it's a very simple conversation and the

39:03.240 --> 39:08.680
conversation is this if you derive a synthetic process stimulated by a

39:08.680 --> 39:12.000
chemical you found in a naturally occurring phenomenon that synthesis

39:12.000 --> 39:14.880
chemical on the ceiling or meaning the nucleic acids well as series that are

39:14.880 --> 39:18.200
that are that are known as by itself is the issue it's the assembly of a model

39:18.200 --> 39:22.920
of nucleic acid symbol a molecule that form a molecule that is in fact pathogenic

39:22.920 --> 39:27.640
the molecule is pathogenic in so far as we know from the gain of function

39:27.640 --> 39:31.120
research that was done we know that you can take open reading frames which is

39:31.120 --> 39:34.520
just another name for a molecule you can put that molecule into a living system

39:34.520 --> 39:39.920
and you can create with that molecule a inflammation of a living system does

39:39.920 --> 39:42.960
that mean that it has the ability to replicate no it doesn't as a matter

39:42.960 --> 39:45.440
fact they patented replication defectivity because they knew it wouldn't

39:45.440 --> 39:49.560
replicate so the issue is a very simple one if you read the exact nature of the

39:49.560 --> 39:54.120
study particularly the ones from 1999 to 2002 what you have is a very clear

39:54.120 --> 40:00.280
piece of evidence it says molecules sampled and then modified by humans turned

40:00.280 --> 40:04.960
into a thing that was pro-inflammatory and created in the case of rabbits

40:04.960 --> 40:08.640
cardiomyopathy and rabbits when we look at these experiments though David as an

40:08.640 --> 40:12.000
example for during the end of covid doctors Mark and Sam Bailey go into

40:12.000 --> 40:14.680
extensive details on exactly what happened with ferrets and so-called

40:14.680 --> 40:17.880
gain of function experiments and it's just a series of passages and then

40:17.880 --> 40:20.920
grinding up nasal tissue from a ferret and injecting it into another ferret

40:20.920 --> 40:23.520
and then finding sequences that are different and claiming ah this is proof

40:23.760 --> 40:28.080
of a of a weaponized and a more lethal more pathogenic and a slightly altered

40:28.080 --> 40:30.640
variant of a virus and those are the things that see this is where this is

40:30.640 --> 40:34.920
where the problem is gain a function is a term that has been highly highly

40:34.920 --> 40:37.720
misrepresented from the standpoint of two different parts of this conversation

40:37.720 --> 40:40.640
one is the idea that we're going to create this hyper virulent thing okay so

40:40.640 --> 40:43.160
we talk about that in i have to get infections in hospitals that some

40:43.160 --> 40:46.160
are another whether it's mrsa whether it's cmv whether it's any of these

40:46.160 --> 40:48.720
things which are allegedly going to be amplified by the use of various types

40:48.720 --> 40:51.800
of drugs or antibiotics we're creating what we call superbugs okay so there's a

40:51.800 --> 40:55.800
theory there's a class of study that says that by intervention with one or

40:55.800 --> 40:59.080
more therapeutic agents we are amplifying the pathogenicity of something

40:59.080 --> 41:02.200
and that's a pathogenicity that that words have meaning here what do you

41:02.200 --> 41:04.360
know that's what i'm saying there's a whole school of thought that's talking

41:04.360 --> 41:08.360
about this amplification effect that's a very very there's tons and tons and

41:08.360 --> 41:11.400
tons of research on this idea that somehow another by treating one thing

41:11.400 --> 41:14.360
you're amplifying the virulence or pathogenicity of another

41:14.360 --> 41:17.880
yeah what are you referring to because you've often spoke about these things

41:17.880 --> 41:21.400
as if they are well established now Alec what i and this is you know listen

41:21.400 --> 41:24.440
my role in this entire program just like my role in doing bioweapons

41:24.440 --> 41:27.800
inspections in 2003 and 2005 and other times for the united states government

41:27.800 --> 41:31.480
my role is really simple my job is to actually publicly bring light to

41:31.480 --> 41:35.160
facts that stand in controversy to the official narrative

41:35.160 --> 41:38.200
the official narrative and the facts that are presented by me

41:38.200 --> 41:41.480
are the point not what those facts are the facts are that scientific

41:41.480 --> 41:46.200
publications stated that there was the development of a pathogen

41:46.200 --> 41:49.080
now i'm not saying there was or was not i'm simply saying that if you're going

41:49.080 --> 41:51.880
to pretend like this thing mysteriously came out of a wuhan wet market

41:51.880 --> 41:54.840
and in 2016 you actually say the same thing was isolated and prepared for

41:54.840 --> 41:57.560
human deployment you cannot say those two things and get away with it

41:57.560 --> 42:01.000
my role and my very public role in this situation has been to restrain from

42:01.000 --> 42:04.280
stating my opinion ever my opinion is not known by you

42:04.280 --> 42:07.640
or by anyone else for a simple reason it is because my opinion has not been

42:07.640 --> 42:11.080
asked for and i have not offered it what i have done is i've supplied evidence

42:11.080 --> 42:13.400
to say that the official narrative is falsifiable

42:13.400 --> 42:17.480
by their own record so with that though do you think that um

42:17.480 --> 42:19.320
here let me let me frame this in the best way that i can

42:19.320 --> 42:23.720
if the facts are coming from a place of completely of being completely

42:23.720 --> 42:26.600
unproven if there's a legit facts are coming from a place of being completely

42:26.600 --> 42:31.160
unproven why is it not um important to raise awareness to the reality that

42:31.160 --> 42:33.880
there's actually because because you're unwilling just like everybody else is

42:33.880 --> 42:36.440
unwilling to actually question the fundamental problem that's not true

42:36.440 --> 42:39.560
DNA I question it all the time no i'm saying i'm saying causality you

42:39.560 --> 42:42.600
use you have written and posted frequently about causality

42:42.600 --> 42:45.400
and i actually challenge causality at it's fundamental i'm the only person

42:45.400 --> 42:48.360
you've ever heard talking about 1663 gothary leavens until this

42:48.360 --> 42:50.760
presentation you didn't even know about it you don't know about the fact that

42:50.760 --> 42:53.640
the heresy goes back to the schism that actually set apart the

42:53.640 --> 42:56.120
eastern orthotics church whether jesus was one being or two being the

42:56.120 --> 42:59.400
act of the matter is we can go back and i do this by the way

42:59.400 --> 43:01.560
because part of the thing that i do in the presentations that i make all over

43:01.560 --> 43:04.040
the world i'm willing to go back and i'm willing to challenge

43:04.040 --> 43:06.760
every single foundational assumption and ask the question

43:06.760 --> 43:10.040
have we considered the implication of that particular

43:10.040 --> 43:13.320
underlying assumption can you step step back for a moment and just go okay what's

43:13.320 --> 43:15.960
the assumption behind that don't i have you have you questioned the

43:15.960 --> 43:18.600
the implication of the underlying assumption that there is a pathogenic

43:18.600 --> 43:21.080
disease-causing particle being passed from person to person publicly

43:21.080 --> 43:23.960
absolutely i've done it many many times in fact i've got a years worth of

43:23.960 --> 43:27.160
videos doing that in fact i said that at the very beginning my first video was

43:27.160 --> 43:31.320
this was actually a disease of numbers not a disease of anything

43:31.320 --> 43:34.680
this was a propaganda warfare my engagement with the propaganda warfare

43:34.760 --> 43:37.800
was to show that the propagandists themselves had their own falsifiable

43:37.800 --> 43:41.640
evidence and the public wasn't talking about it so my role in this was not to

43:41.640 --> 43:44.680
discuss the merits of science because there has not been science

43:44.680 --> 43:48.360
listen very carefully there has not been science in the united states since

43:48.360 --> 43:51.080
1798

43:51.160 --> 43:53.960
yeah i agree with that but it also depends on what you classify as science because

43:53.960 --> 43:57.400
no it doesn't because science it does it's very nature

43:57.400 --> 44:01.720
no science by its very nature is the thoughtful introspection of observation

44:01.720 --> 44:04.760
that becomes serialized to start deriving generalized conclusions

44:04.760 --> 44:08.920
it is not and it never will be the promulgation of a dogma such that it

44:08.920 --> 44:12.520
supports an industrial complex and since 1798

44:12.520 --> 44:15.240
every single thing that has been branded science

44:15.240 --> 44:19.000
and by the way i could go back earlier because technically in 1663 the charter

44:19.000 --> 44:22.040
in london that established the royal academy linked the pursuit of science

44:22.040 --> 44:25.160
to the pursuit of colonial industry so i could go back to 1663 and say that

44:25.160 --> 44:27.640
that's where it got hijacked but 1798 in the united states when

44:27.640 --> 44:30.520
thomas jefferson was cowed into this idea that we were going to use

44:30.520 --> 44:33.640
intellectual property as the basis for our economic hegemony in the united

44:33.640 --> 44:36.200
states and the formation of the patent system that decision

44:36.200 --> 44:38.520
hijack science permanently in the united states

44:38.520 --> 44:41.080
yeah when i talk about science i'm saying the study of natural phenomena

44:41.080 --> 44:44.680
and the natural science we would vigorously agree on that point

44:44.680 --> 44:47.720
and natural science tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena based on

44:47.720 --> 44:50.360
independence and that would be employing the scientific method

44:50.360 --> 44:53.080
and the scientific method is attempting to determine what is an interesting

44:53.080 --> 44:56.680
statement that he made there that's in 1798 and the establishment of the

44:56.680 --> 45:01.320
patent system um things have been screwed up

45:01.320 --> 45:05.560
as an interesting statement for him to make and you know that he does work

45:05.560 --> 45:11.640
in some respects on intellectual property according to his long resume

45:11.640 --> 45:15.960
um it is just really extraordinary all of us is responsible for the

45:15.960 --> 45:20.040
weaponization of nature is actually something that he said quite strongly

45:20.040 --> 45:25.160
uh a few minutes ago um so entire america is to blame all of the

45:25.160 --> 45:31.640
western countries are to blame for the existence of this virus

45:31.640 --> 45:34.920
it's a pretty bold statement it's a very bold statement

45:34.920 --> 45:40.040
um replication and competence was patented i don't know about that it would

45:40.040 --> 45:43.160
be great if anybody in the audience wants to be a

45:43.160 --> 45:48.680
hussluth and look that up um or maybe ask david martin about that what what he

45:48.680 --> 45:52.600
means by that i know that robert uh sorry uh

45:52.600 --> 45:58.200
brough barrick has had a number of papers talking about the um t r s

45:58.200 --> 46:04.200
regions of the sub-genomic RNAs which are basically these

46:04.200 --> 46:09.720
well they're these places where the if you get rid of this uh

46:09.720 --> 46:13.720
this little place then uh recombination can occur

46:13.720 --> 46:19.880
and so you can remove those little heads on the sub sub-genomic RNAs so that

46:19.880 --> 46:22.520
the RNA polymerase can't find them anymore

46:22.520 --> 46:26.760
and so then actually you can't get recombination

46:26.760 --> 46:30.920
and this explanation is really interesting because it kind of

46:30.920 --> 46:34.920
suggests an alternative molecular mechanism by which recombination would

46:34.920 --> 46:38.600
occur in a coronavirus and it kind of suggests that the sub-genomic

46:38.600 --> 46:42.040
RNAs can contribute to recombination which is of course

46:42.040 --> 46:47.000
one of the many ways you can get it in competent particle in their cartoons

46:47.000 --> 46:50.920
um so if we just accept some of this stuff as much as we can

46:50.920 --> 46:55.960
um he talks about gain of function and then he tells a really long drawn out

46:55.960 --> 47:00.600
story about how this has to do with iatrogenic infections

47:00.600 --> 47:04.680
and treating those in a hospital and how they can generate

47:04.680 --> 47:09.640
evermore pathogenic pathogens which is kind of funny because

47:09.640 --> 47:15.320
again he's he's very good at wrestling with this guy and and and

47:15.320 --> 47:20.600
making statements which Alec is almost like okay i agree with that i

47:20.600 --> 47:23.560
well he is i agree with that i agree with that i accept that

47:23.560 --> 47:26.760
okay that's fine and so in a lot of ways where he's

47:26.760 --> 47:31.560
trying to catch him um david is able to just kind of sidestep and say that well

47:31.560 --> 47:35.240
i've never given you my opinion and i'm fighting from a legal perspective and

47:35.240 --> 47:38.360
so i don't care about science and i don't have a hypothesis

47:38.360 --> 47:41.960
and wow isn't that a really interesting statement

47:42.040 --> 47:45.560
very similar to what we heard last night about not having a

47:45.560 --> 47:49.400
hypothesis but just refuting one and so if

47:49.400 --> 47:54.520
Alec is also really at this stage where he's just refuting a hypothesis

47:54.520 --> 47:58.840
and that's what makes it so easy for david martin to just dance with him

47:58.840 --> 48:02.840
he can give him an affirmative answer and then and then talk his way out of it

48:02.840 --> 48:09.080
in the next ten sentences and so he's managed to put down a lot of the

48:09.080 --> 48:12.680
a lot of the narrative right the idea of gain of function has an all but

48:12.680 --> 48:16.120
at albin question. Alec tried to question it but then

48:16.120 --> 48:19.720
david martin steamer old him as far as i can tell he almost made him agree that

48:19.720 --> 48:23.000
that's that's what's happening

48:23.560 --> 48:27.000
it's pretty extraordinary really i find him to be quite uh

48:27.000 --> 48:32.280
quite an interesting uh character in the show is the cause of an observed natural

48:32.280 --> 48:34.440
comments and that's where you that's where you and i would have a

48:34.440 --> 48:36.680
disagreement because i don't think we're ever looking at causes what we're

48:36.680 --> 48:39.400
trying to do is understand the interaction between systems

48:39.400 --> 48:43.080
causality is always going to be a dangerous slope that i will refuse to get on

48:43.080 --> 48:45.960
simply because causality is the ultimate hubris

48:45.960 --> 48:47.880
of humanity we think that we understand multi-dimensional

48:47.880 --> 48:52.280
agree that we have no clue at the so so the idea that the scientific method

48:52.280 --> 48:55.000
has to then have its natural reduction to causality i think is

48:55.000 --> 48:57.240
absolute horseshit well i mean that is the scientific

48:57.240 --> 48:59.400
method though it's a well it's not what it is

48:59.400 --> 49:01.800
it's a bastardization of an industrial scientific

49:01.800 --> 49:03.800
method i agree but it is not what the scientific method is

49:03.800 --> 49:06.360
the scientific method is a series of observations so for example i'll give

49:06.360 --> 49:09.720
you an actual example of this for many many many years

49:09.720 --> 49:12.760
we have used hepatocytes to do drug toxicity studies

49:12.760 --> 49:16.120
and the bummer is that liver cells outside of the human body die quickly

49:16.120 --> 49:19.240
and so a biological engineer in the university of Virginia came up with

49:19.240 --> 49:22.120
that idea that maybe we don't understand hepatocytes very well

49:22.120 --> 49:24.760
and that was a good observation he was just making a hypothesis we don't

49:24.760 --> 49:28.200
understand hepatocytes so what he said was hey maybe if what we do is we wash

49:28.200 --> 49:31.560
those hepatocytes with a natural flow that mimics blood flow we would get a

49:31.560 --> 49:34.600
different response from those cells not surprisingly

49:34.600 --> 49:37.960
by mirroring the conditions in which hepatocytes naturally live

49:37.960 --> 49:42.040
what happened was the company hemosteer which is a company here in charlesville

49:42.040 --> 49:45.320
figured out how to keep hepatocytes alive now that's a really important thing

49:45.320 --> 49:48.120
but the guy who actually came up with the idea was a biomedical engineer

49:48.120 --> 49:51.720
and his entire proposition was around shear forces his theory which by the way

49:51.720 --> 49:55.000
there was a lot of merit in his theory was that the actual

49:55.000 --> 49:58.440
pulsatile flow across a cell stimulated something in the cell that mimicked

49:58.440 --> 50:02.920
the pulse of the heartbeat great theory and he was right

50:02.920 --> 50:06.680
by pulsing the medium across the cells he was able to get hepatocytes to keep

50:06.680 --> 50:10.120
growing but he wasn't looking at the electrical charge

50:10.120 --> 50:13.880
of red blood cells now if you've ever taken multivariate

50:13.880 --> 50:16.600
statistics which i used to teach what you find is that there's an interesting

50:16.600 --> 50:19.640
problem you can have a perfect model once again drawn out of this regression

50:19.640 --> 50:23.080
causality question and you can conclude oh my gosh

50:23.080 --> 50:26.440
he was right the shear force of the flow across the membrane of the cell was the

50:26.440 --> 50:29.640
reason why hepatocytes lived and if he stopped asking the question

50:29.640 --> 50:32.680
he would have causally concluded a right answer

50:32.680 --> 50:36.040
if by definition of right we mean could we get hepatocytes to keep living

50:36.040 --> 50:39.800
but i said hold on a minute doesn't blood as it flows across the cell

50:39.800 --> 50:42.760
have charged particles and isn't their electromagnetic field that's created

50:42.760 --> 50:45.320
by the pulsing of blood across the same membrane

50:45.320 --> 50:48.440
and it turns out that if you actually put a charged particle across there

50:48.440 --> 50:51.160
you also found out hepatocytes grew now what's the point

50:51.160 --> 50:53.960
the point is through the lens of a biomedical engineer

50:53.960 --> 50:56.360
he actually did science did the scientific method and concluded

50:56.360 --> 50:59.080
correctly if by definition of concluded correctly we mean we got

50:59.160 --> 51:03.160
hepatocytes to grow he was right but here's the problem he had never asked

51:03.160 --> 51:05.400
the question is there a charge particle is there an

51:05.400 --> 51:08.360
emp or an emf element to the exact same phenomenon it turns out

51:08.360 --> 51:11.080
that that was also correct and here's where causality fails

51:11.080 --> 51:14.120
causality is only as good as the length of time we stay at the question

51:14.120 --> 51:16.600
because we will get to the place where we're pretty damn convinced we figured

51:16.600 --> 51:19.000
it out and then what we'll do is we'll reify that into dogma

51:19.000 --> 51:20.920
and then we'll build businesses around it and we'll build all kinds of other

51:20.920 --> 51:23.880
things around it and god help us if somebody comes along and says

51:23.880 --> 51:26.600
maybe it was shear force maybe it was electrical yeah i don't disagree with

51:26.600 --> 51:28.440
anything that you said there i don't know that's what i'm saying that's the

51:28.440 --> 51:31.400
problem the problem is that the minute we go to the regression

51:31.400 --> 51:34.440
end which is we now have causality we have blinded

51:34.440 --> 51:37.160
ourselves for sure so let me interrupt real quick though to ask a very direct

51:37.160 --> 51:39.240
question when you say that there is a biological weapon

51:39.240 --> 51:41.960
yes and you're now saying that you don't think there is a biological weapon or

51:41.960 --> 51:44.520
do i don't know i didn't say that there's actually a biological weapon it is a

51:44.520 --> 51:48.040
biologically derived toxin okay so okay so what is the application of this

51:48.040 --> 51:51.400
biological weapon according to you then the application is injected into people

51:51.400 --> 51:54.040
it is actually a pro-inflammatory pro-oncologic trigger

51:54.040 --> 51:57.640
to actually harm so the biological weapon is coming in the form of injection

51:57.640 --> 52:01.320
that's correct okay so is there okay okay i don't disagree with that is there

52:01.320 --> 52:04.520
a biological weapon that is being spread from now person to person

52:04.520 --> 52:07.880
never has been never has been okay oh i think we can agree on that okay

52:07.880 --> 52:12.040
so david then my question is um given what you just stated there don't you

52:12.040 --> 52:15.480
think it's important to clarify that publicly because here's my problem

52:15.480 --> 52:18.360
listen i went up to capital hill and i sat down with senator ron johnson

52:18.360 --> 52:21.800
who at the time was the only senator who was even willing to consider that

52:21.800 --> 52:25.400
maybe there was a potential that there was a crime being committed

52:25.400 --> 52:27.800
this is very very very very important

52:29.320 --> 52:31.720
i sat with my wife in ron johnson's conference room

52:31.720 --> 52:34.520
and i laid out the entire evidence that this was a racketeering crime

52:34.520 --> 52:36.840
there's no question about it it is and by the way that's not an allegation

52:36.840 --> 52:38.920
that's their own admission they have admitted that this was a racketeering

52:38.920 --> 52:41.720
crime the fact is that every single piece of the Sherman Act and the

52:41.720 --> 52:44.440
Clayton Act have been violated there is no question about what i just said

52:44.440 --> 52:48.040
not zero that is an open and shut case and ron johnson and his staff produced a

52:48.040 --> 52:51.320
series of graphs that said look these are excess deaths

52:51.320 --> 52:55.800
i said based on what and he said well the cdc says that these are excess

52:55.800 --> 52:58.920
deaths i said i understand that that's what the cdc says

52:58.920 --> 53:02.280
i said but did you read the footnote by the way i'm answering your question

53:02.280 --> 53:04.920
did you read the footnote under the graph this is not did you go in a deep

53:04.920 --> 53:09.880
exploration of statistics did you read the footnote under the graph

53:10.040 --> 53:12.600
no did any of the staff read the footnote under the graph

53:12.600 --> 53:16.680
no and here's the problem allak in an ideal world you and i would vigorously

53:16.680 --> 53:18.760
be on the same page wouldn't be a great to have a symposium where we actually

53:18.760 --> 53:21.240
beat people senseless around the stupidity of regression

53:21.240 --> 53:23.400
which by the way every person learned in ninth grade

53:23.400 --> 53:25.800
wouldn't be great if we actually realized that the eight and a half by eleven

53:25.800 --> 53:28.200
sheet of paper that you have in front of you with your notes on it

53:28.200 --> 53:32.120
wouldn't it be great to know that that was a Pythagorean ideal that was a

53:32.120 --> 53:35.320
constant blinding of the optic nerve so that we actually have to see the

53:35.320 --> 53:37.400
irrational proportion of eight and a half by eleven so that we can never

53:37.400 --> 53:39.800
actually understand the printed word on a page wouldn't be great to go back and

53:39.800 --> 53:42.760
realize that the paper cabal figured out how to constrain what we think

53:42.760 --> 53:46.040
our knowledge is wouldn't be great to realize that in the 1440s when

53:46.040 --> 53:49.080
they arrested the printing press we actually put

53:49.080 --> 53:52.520
sharp metallic objects into the black ink so that we could blind the optic

53:52.520 --> 53:55.400
nerve to be able to read with greater fatigue so we read less instead of

53:55.400 --> 53:57.720
red more because vellum and red here's the problem allak if we're

53:57.720 --> 54:00.840
serious about the question you're asking then the answer is you're damn straight

54:00.840 --> 54:03.800
i'd love to go back and do that but you know how many people pay attention

54:03.800 --> 54:06.040
you know how many people pay attention to the untested hypothesis

54:06.040 --> 54:09.080
that comes from hey why did we have asymptomatic spread well we had asymptomatic

54:09.080 --> 54:12.760
spread because we have original sin i don't know i don't think i like that

54:12.840 --> 54:15.560
person david let me interrupt it let me interrupt i've had several people in

54:15.560 --> 54:17.400
the comments saying that you're not really letting me talk and i'd appreciate

54:17.400 --> 54:20.120
you letting me talk so i'll i'll say you're just a

54:20.120 --> 54:22.440
david symptomatic spread well we had asymptomatic spread because we have

54:22.440 --> 54:25.640
original sin i have original sin i don't know if it's great i like i'll be

54:25.640 --> 54:28.680
first in david let me interrupt it let me interrupt

54:28.680 --> 54:34.680
original sin and we had asymptomatic spread because we had original sin

54:34.680 --> 54:39.560
what is that what is that instead of red more because vellum and red here's the

54:39.560 --> 54:42.280
problem allak if we're serious about the question you're asking

54:42.280 --> 54:44.680
then the answer is you're damn straight i'd love to go back and do that but you

54:44.680 --> 54:47.480
know how many people pay attention you know how many people pay attention to

54:47.480 --> 54:51.000
the untested hypothesis that comes from hey why did we have asymptomatic spread

54:51.000 --> 54:53.480
well we had asymptomatic spread because we have original sin

54:53.480 --> 54:55.960
i have original sin i don't know i disagree i like that but first in

54:55.960 --> 54:58.280
david let me interrupt it let me interrupt i've had several people in the

54:58.280 --> 55:00.040
comments saying that you're not really letting me talk and i'd appreciate

55:00.040 --> 55:03.640
you letting me talk so i'll say you're asking you're asking question you're

55:03.640 --> 55:07.240
getting the answer and that's the problem what's the problem

55:07.240 --> 55:10.040
the question and the answer is not a soundbite

55:10.040 --> 55:13.720
and that's where the problem is your own listeners are proving the point

55:13.720 --> 55:16.200
in what respect because i'm actually asking the direct question you are

55:16.200 --> 55:19.000
going to answer the fundamental asymptomatic questions

55:19.000 --> 55:22.040
that are the reason why we are blinded into the belief of pandemics

55:22.040 --> 55:24.680
and pathogens then you have to go back to some roots that none of us but then

55:24.680 --> 55:27.400
why do you talk to with okay time out then why do you talk about them as if

55:27.400 --> 55:30.680
they are well established concrete things when you don't i simply don't operate

55:30.680 --> 55:33.960
no i'm simply offering the evidence that the propaganda was a lie

55:33.960 --> 55:36.280
the evidence that the propaganda was a lie but the evidence of the propaganda

55:36.280 --> 55:39.240
was a lie extends to there is no proof you're talking about falsifying

55:39.240 --> 55:42.680
their unproven hypothesis and i'm not i'm talking about falsifying

55:42.680 --> 55:45.560
their narrative and those are the two different things that is the subtlety

55:45.560 --> 55:47.880
we're missing okay so what's the difference between falsifying their

55:47.880 --> 55:51.400
narrative and falsifying the idea that there is a microscopic

55:51.400 --> 55:54.120
submicroscopic intracellular parasite that is being passed from person the

55:54.120 --> 55:57.480
person causing that's a very simple that's a very simple question

55:57.480 --> 56:00.360
there is no crime in having a wrong thought

56:00.360 --> 56:04.760
there is a crime in having a wrong act and the difference between your

56:04.760 --> 56:08.600
conversation and questions and my reality is i am focused on defining and

56:08.600 --> 56:12.920
holding accountable the crime the crime is an act where you have the evidence

56:12.920 --> 56:15.720
of a thing and then you lie to the public and you seduce the public in your

56:15.720 --> 56:18.280
course the public into taking something that is meant to harm and destroy them

56:18.280 --> 56:21.240
that is a criminal act it is not a crime to think wrong

56:21.240 --> 56:25.800
it is a crime to do wrong yeah so my response to that would be

56:25.800 --> 56:29.720
David if there is no proof of the alleged cause necessitating the need for any

56:29.720 --> 56:32.120
of the health measures that were implemented over the last three and a

56:32.120 --> 56:34.680
half years don't you think it's important to highlight the fact that

56:34.680 --> 56:37.080
there was no proof of the alleged cause in the first place

56:37.080 --> 56:42.680
but we just got through saying it you see

56:43.080 --> 56:49.240
we just got through saying it that the cdc's answer was look at these excess

56:49.240 --> 56:54.280
deaths and so neither one of these super geniuses can figure out where those

56:54.280 --> 56:59.720
excess deaths came from or what the cdc is doing to generate them

56:59.720 --> 57:04.280
they can't come up with the idea that killing people with opioids

57:04.280 --> 57:08.520
could create excess deaths that could be called excess deaths

57:08.520 --> 57:13.400
that's all you need are excess deaths they just told you the answer

57:13.400 --> 57:17.560
it doesn't matter where they came from because nobody's connecting the two

57:17.560 --> 57:21.560
nobody's doing what john bodeman is doing nobody's trying to do what jessica

57:21.560 --> 57:25.480
hocket is doing nobody's trying to connect

57:25.480 --> 57:30.600
the excess deaths numbers to the excess bodies

57:31.320 --> 57:35.720
20,000 people dying in new york city in four weeks

57:35.720 --> 57:41.240
at 150 pounds a body is 3 million pounds of human meat that needs a disposal

57:41.240 --> 57:46.840
where the hell did that go how many freezer trucks is that

57:49.880 --> 57:53.800
none of these people are trying to do that math none of these these two guys

57:53.800 --> 57:57.480
are thinking at all about

57:59.480 --> 58:04.360
remdesivir medazalam ventilators antibiotic steroid misuse

58:04.360 --> 58:08.280
do not resuscitate orders financial incentives to

58:08.280 --> 58:12.680
rework death certificates opioid deaths they've never mentioned protocols and

58:12.680 --> 58:15.240
they've never they've said no evidence of spread

58:15.240 --> 58:21.640
so that's nice no evidence of a spreading pathogen

58:22.120 --> 58:29.640
but the overarching theme of these no virus people is very specific because

58:29.640 --> 58:34.120
massy said it the other day on that video which was much older than this one

58:38.280 --> 58:44.920
that the the foundation of this underlying whole fiasco is the virus and the fact that

58:44.920 --> 58:49.480
they claim to have isolated or purified it or sequenced it

58:51.640 --> 58:57.320
and that is not the foundation of the narrative

58:57.320 --> 59:00.760
the foundation of the narrative is the people were murdered and those people

59:00.760 --> 59:05.560
are called excess deaths and that excess deaths is called evidence of a new

59:05.560 --> 59:08.360
cause of death

59:09.800 --> 59:14.760
and so where they got the numbers to shuffle is super important like

59:14.760 --> 59:19.800
it is actually the way that they justified the shot

59:19.800 --> 59:22.360
the bio weapon whatever you want to call it

59:22.360 --> 59:27.560
the transfections are being justified because of the excess deaths

59:27.560 --> 59:32.040
not because of the story of the virus the excess deaths are being explained

59:32.040 --> 59:35.320
by the story of the virus but without those excess deaths the story of the

59:35.320 --> 59:39.880
virus would be nothing without the excess deaths the story of the virus

59:39.880 --> 59:42.920
would be nothing

59:43.560 --> 59:48.440
and so that's the magic of the no virus position

59:48.680 --> 59:53.640
that's where you see that they're broke because how long are we into this

59:53.640 --> 59:57.880
video already we are we are 41 minutes into their

59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.920
discussion and they have never used the words anything about protocols

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.320
nothing about PCR nothing i mean come on

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.760
you might say to yourself yeah but Alec knows all of that stuff but he's not

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.760
saying it he's letting this guy talk about

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:23.240
about 1963 and 1798 and and 1963 Royal Academy and

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.080
and all of us are responsible for the weaponization of nature

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:33.800
i guess that's including Alec um 1663 the causation is when somebody

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.560
wrote some thesis about modern regression and that's how we got into

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.680
causation is he gonna say that you can't know

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.480
anything now because that's the foundation of broken

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.840
science is that you can't know anything because p values never tell you

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.760
anything and you just have to keep asking questions over and over

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.840
nothing can ever be known for sure that's the broken science part that we

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.840
can never learn anything and move forward

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.520
and these two guys are clowning exactly that line

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:10.200
only on a more philosophical note there's no DNA

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.320
everything's a lie i don't believe anything anymore

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.880
i can i ride a bike but i don't believe i can balance i don't i don't believe

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.120
it's happening i've already done that i that's my first video that i did

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.600
publicly what did you say in that video that this was a

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.080
statistics game of terror and the promulgation of terror

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.280
no i'm saying literally no no there was no sars there was no covid 19 i said

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.520
it very clearly you said that there is no sars covid

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.680
two for yep and i said there's no covid 19 very clear

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.320
okay so then david i mean i'm just asking direct questions based on

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.520
your own public statements so yeah but that's the problem out of context i

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.920
can find a thing that i can say and go well you said this on one day put it

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.800
in context and you will not okay so what is what is the context in of saying

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.360
it uh this is during your speech the european part of the coronavirus as a

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.640
model of a pathogen was isolated and as a model of a pathogen don't jump over

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.040
that don't jump over that okay but but when you say that you're

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.120
unpalented and that's exactly what this conversation does i said as a model of

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.080
a pathogen does that mean that david martin said it was a virus no does it

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.480
mean that david martin exists says it exists no do you think it's important to

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.000
publicly clarify what the model means then though david because most people

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.640
who are not understanding of the lack of validity of virology are going to hear

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.320
you say model and it's going to completely go over their head

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.120
so that's right the reason why precision he's right is right is right i am very

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.000
precise and what i do i do with great care

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.760
and when i say as a model of a pathogen that is no different from me saying

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.960
that in 1953 watson and krick developed a model of dna

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.400
dna does not exist i don't disagree with that it doesn't i don't disagree

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.400
i know you don't that's why we're vigorously agreement alex the reason

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.600
we're having this conversation is to show the fact that we have to be

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.680
actually precise david precise one over model as though that's not in my

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.000
sentence david but when we're talking about being

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.320
precise there's a reason that a number of people hold your

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.880
statements to be conflicting and confusing so being precise they're not

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.360
actually reading my statements they're reading your opinion of my state no

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360
i'm talking about literally listening to your statements which was the whole

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.600
point of me bringing you on here i'm trying to get clarity and i do have a

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.840
little bit more clarity that you don't think that there is a thing

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.560
spreading from person to person that's i appreciate that this is this is the

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.600
point i never suggested that there was one david my point is though that when

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.000
we're talking you're saying that it's important to be precise correct i

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.200
agree with you so then let's stick to the precision

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.560
of what i said david your public statements are confusing david oh they're not if you

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.640
listen to them they're not if you read my material they're not

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.160
david i've i watched no less than six videos of yours and there are several

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.600
documents you didn't watch okay david but when people do you expect that

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.320
everyone needs to watch all of your videos in a way because i build on a

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.640
theme i don't agree with that but also clarify

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.160
what you mean by saying model okay well i can make that very simple the model

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.080
is a very simple thing we actually have under what's called the general

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.240
atomic theory we have a model that says a proton and a neutron form the basis of

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.600
what we call a nucleus around which electrons oh my gosh that is bullshit

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.640
i have a whole business that is actually proof that that doesn't exist

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.640
but the whole world assumes that atomic matter is somehow the building block

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.120
of everything okay totally there are no atoms there never

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.080
have been in the never will be there's no i would say there's no proof of them

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.160
but yes i'm sorry i would say there's no proof of them but yes

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.920
like no fair no they don't exist we have a construct

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.880
that says in a phase of an observation we think we see energy organized in a

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.840
particular way but an atom is no different from Santa Claus

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.760
no different i can give you the conditions under which you can observe

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.760
it and i can also give you the conditions under which you can observe it

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.400
so the whole reason why we have quantum theory is because we were wrong about

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.840
atoms we were wrong that's just that simple so we have a whole mathematics

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.160
to justify the preservation of a wrong model

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.200
the model of an atom then gives rise to the model model

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.000
of a thing that we call a nucleic acid now nucleic acids do not exist

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.360
they actually are representations of charged energy that actually

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.520
finds itself bound into in phases a phase condition that assembles into a

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.320
particular form wow but if we actually went and said

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.440
does guanine look like it's purple and cytosine look like it's green and does

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.280
urusil look like it's yellow and does whatever

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.400
you know what make up your own silly stories i got a i got a

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.400
i got a compliment allic like uh

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.840
the stupid the stupid complicated is being rolled out and weaponized right

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.000
before our eyes like it's spectacular

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.000
our model of atoms is incomplete and imperfect

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.480
therefore atoms don't exist and since atoms make up nucleic acids nucleic

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.600
acids don't exist and then he proceeds to tell us what nucleic acids really are

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.920
but they don't exist so our models because they're

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.080
imperfect mean that the whole concept doesn't exist

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:38.040
and that's exactly where the the virus no virus argument has been weaponized

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.120
because we know that there are signals at this

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.520
size scale we know that tissues communicate with each other

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:52.360
we know this we know it we just also know that it's very

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.120
exceedingly difficult to study that size scale to study those molecules

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:05.240
it's very difficult but we can just assume and if you listen to the good

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:11.400
parts of a meta a meta biota lecture from nathan wolf around

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.880
2011 you can hear him describe this plethora

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.280
of genetic noise that's found at this size scale

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:26.120
and how he wanted to explore it for new forms of life new forms of pathogens

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.600
new viruses that was the whole basis for meta biota's

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.320
existence is this mythology that in this size scale

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:41.000
exists pathogens rather than genetic noise

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.760
from all of the living things on earth that all use

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.440
DNA RNA and proteins to exist that are all pattern

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.960
integrity based on DNA RNA and protein as best we can tell

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.560
our best is our imperfect models can describe

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.360
we are all pattern integrity made of DNA RNA and proteins

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:09.880
in concert in constant flux and the intersection of

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.240
electrostatic energy

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.760
and viruses are not those things viruses are not patterned

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.520
integrity and so they can't behave like them

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.440
they can't do the things that they've been attributed to having done

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.480
and so david martin very deftly agrees very deftly dodges the main

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.000
thing which is what have you been doing for the last three years

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.640
four years five years then what are you up to with all these

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.760
pattern talks and stuff like it's it's because

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.600
he hides behind this legal thing

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.560
and he's hiding behind the fact that they can make quantities of this stuff

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.160
and they can make people sick

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.240
and so again if you spend an hour talking about the virus and whether

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.240
there was a virus and whether there's a replicating pathogen or not

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.320
you never talk about remdesivir madazalam the proto calls the lack of

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.120
antibiotics the misuse of steroids opioid epidemic and all the other ways

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.360
and that the excess deaths were generated so that the cdc could justify

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.840
the ends

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.560
and the disingenuous argument that the no virus people have been making is that

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:34.040
the pandemic measures were justified based on pcr tests

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.000
were justified based on sequences and were justified based on

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.760
on asymptomatic transmission that's wrong

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.440
they were justified based on the event that jessica hockett has been

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.240
investigating for the last year and a half or two years now

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.160
the mass casualty event in new york city the mass casualty event that happened

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.200
in northern italy the mass casualty event in spain

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.680
and in parts of china and in iran

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.800
wake up ladies and gentlemen that is the way that they justified this

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.080
and they justified it by creating the bodies that they needed

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.240
not by sequencing sahomish county man

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.200
not by doing drive-through pcr by the 25 000 people per day that

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:32.200
is all secondary to the fact that they needed to murder people

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.560
and they did so that they would have something to point to

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.400
to say there's the excess deaths

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.560
think about this very carefully what i'm saying because these last two days

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.680
videos this is not a very good video it's kind of boring it's kind of

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.040
extraordinarily boring

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.880
but the conclusion that you can come to with the parallels between what we're

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.040
hearing in this video and what we heard yesterday and that brief little

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.600
diatribe by the two people on medical doctors for covid ethics

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.960
international that we're questioning mary holland we hear the same thing

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.280
we don't have a hypothesis we're just refuting one

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.000
and they think that the the primary reason why all this happened is because

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.280
people claim to have sequenced purified had isolated rather and purified a

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.920
virus and that's wrong the reason why this happened is because

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.640
excess deaths occurred and those excess deaths were misconstrued as

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:42.840
evidence of a pathogen and they use the molecular biology to

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.480
to convince everybody that that's indeed what happened

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:55.080
but they needed the excess deaths not the pcr's not the sequences

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:01.400
not the culturing they needed the excess deaths understand that

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.440
if they just would have said a mysterious ammonia is just spreading

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.520
and pneumonia is spreading around the united states and all these people

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.960
died it would be just fine and it would have worked just as

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.200
well

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.200
but maybe they wouldn't have been able to generate the panic that they needed

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.480
in order to get all these dumb things to happen

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.800
these murders to occur but we're still not there

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.800
alice still not mentioned one person that was killed by the protocols that

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.560
weren't necessary still hasn't mentioned one detail about

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.760
those protocols on any continent still hasn't mentioned all the other ways

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.760
that in his own country of america

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.520
the excess deaths were generated

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:51.000
definitely not limited to remdesivir not limited to ventilators

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.720
not limited to misuse or lack of use of antibiotics

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.200
not limited to old folks homes being riddled with people that are having

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.480
pneumonia untreated not and not limited to

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.680
the opioid epidemic but including all of those and more

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.520
smash mouth we're not stopping anymore this is done

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.560
your own little boxes that look like lego sets and then go look this is what it

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.520
looks like well no it doesn't and that's never been what it looks like

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.320
we have no frickin clue what it looks like because it doesn't exist

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.240
so now we get to the we have a model of dna now how did we get the model of

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.960
dna we got the model from an x-ray crystallography that actually showed a

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.920
quadri helix not a double helix system so figure that one and the process time

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.720
out the process for x-ray crystallography itself is riddled with

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.640
endless unproven assumptions so so so find the myriad of ways in which

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.360
we think that we have and then we took that by the way and we stole it from the

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.120
people who actually did it and then we were awarded the Nobel prize to the

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.160
guys that didn't really do it so setting all of that aside what i mean by

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.680
model is this a model like a belief system

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.080
no different model belief system i would totally agree that

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.160
model is nothing more than the reification of a belief system that is

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.040
asked to be unquestioned totally agree with that

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.120
totally agree you could substitute the word dogma

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.040
and it would be the same thing

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.440
you can substitute the word belief and it would be the same thing

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.400
you could substitute the word religion and it would be the same thing

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.240
every single one of those things is when you are told by a person and authority

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.360
stop asking a question so what i mean by model

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.760
substitute belief substitute dogma substitute religion substitute anything

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:26.040
you want is nothing more than the fact that we are told not to ask a question

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.400
because the model can't be questioned just like the belief can't be questioned just like

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.320
religion can't be questioned and the fact of the matter is anything that is too weak to stand

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.880
against questioning is not worth the human's effort and i got last part one more time anything

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.680
you put next to it whether you think it's science whether you think it's religion whether you think

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.520
it's faith if it can't be questioned it's not worth the brain power that you apply to it yeah but then

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.200
if it is an unproven unfounded belief system do you think it's important to question that belief system

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.600
especially why not let me finish let me finish yeah yeah no that's good it's a great question yeah

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.000
yes because i i've said this before on my show i have no problem with people having beliefs i

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.600
believe so many of which are completely unproven i recognize that but the point is when there is a

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:09.240
belief system that is not rooted in uh repeatable and observable yeah incidents in reality this is

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.640
this is a model this is a belief system that has no basis has no merit an actual whether it be

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.640
scientific or just observational experiences yeah and then it is then weaponized upon the

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.520
entire human population i think it is imperative that we attack the root of that belief system and

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.040
attacking the root of that belief system here because david i don't think you disagree with this

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.880
everything that has happened over the last three and a half years much of what underpins

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.880
allopathic medicine literally dethings that underpin all of the vaccine program around the world

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.880
is this completely pseudoscientific unproven idea that not only diseases passed via the flue

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.480
of a sick person but there are these obligate intracellular parasites that exist that replicate

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.440
inside of a hostel and it's important i think to shed light on that because that would then say

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.760
all of these measures are completely fraudulent and as we have in in germany a man by the name

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.000
of marvin haban used exactly what i'm describing here to win in court in germany showing that there

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.360
is no proof of the alleged cause necessitating the need for these health measures and they let him

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.600
off so this idea that we have to argue on their playing field in order to win is just not true

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.720
we can show that there's no proof of the alleged thing and necessitating the need for any of this

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.120
and and this is where it's probably helpful for you and your audience to know my bias which comes

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.400
from my lived experience okay i grew up in a very very austere religious environment

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.200
very austere and i was rejected from that environment as a heretic

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.240
i actually have physical and lifetimes of damage done to me for actually doing exactly what you said

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.520
why don't you just go ahead and and go after the the fundamental belief and and tip the whole

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.200
thing over we know what i've spent my life doing that i did that in the conflict regions of both

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.080
the pacific and african i've done that a lot of places around the world and i have physical

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.720
scars on my body for doing that that's fair okay so i'll tell you what i'm not going to do

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.720
i'm not going to repeat something that i've done for a lifetime and found out that doing

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.160
that thing for lifetime actually caused me physical and psychological harm that i do not have any

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.840
chance of recovering from now and when i say recovery i'm not saying that i need to recover

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.720
from it it's part of my life i know what it's like to actually have physical harm done to my physical

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.680
being because of a belief system i grew up that way i know what that's like and i'm not suggesting

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.880
for a moment else it sounds like he was abused as a kid or something and i can't really tell what

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:20.840
he's saying um he grew up at a very religious family and the family rejected him so does he

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.440
not talk to his brother that works at the cdc anymore i'm not really it's a recent interview

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:33.000
it's from july of this year not that reason like and by the way i applaud you i applaud tom i applaud

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.400
you know a ton of people who are actually saying hey our mission right now is to shine a light on

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.920
these other issues that's fine and guess what you know what i've never done i have never once

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.240
told somebody to not do what they were called to do but let me be abundantly clear on what i

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:52.200
am doing what i am doing is i am showing that in this case of the domestic and now international

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.880
terrorism resulting in the death of american citizens and citizens in the world that a group of

01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.480
people conspired through a criminal conspiracy conspired to violate the anti-trust laws of the

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.360
united states and anti-trust laws of the world and it conspired to create an act of global terrorism

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:12.280
for the sole purpose of administering what was going to be a toxin into the arms of billions

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.400
of people for the sole purpose of their self enrichment and for the sole purpose of them obtaining

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.840
control for which they have done nothing but terrorize the population to acquire and my mission was

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.600
singular and is that that does not deprive you or tom or anyone else of the mission that i

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:33.720
equally think is important however that's very clear i would say very clearly is if you are going

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.360
to pick on the question of terrain versus pathogen or whatever you decide you're pick on

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.120
then have the integrity of asking the question all the way back to the beginning

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.200
because we have at a fundamental human problem right now this notion that somehow

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.280
another even in tom's terrain theory bullshit we've got another problem which is he's not testing

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:55.000
the assumption that goes back to we still have a fundamental picture of humans where we have

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.240
not done a good job of defining how we're going to emancipate ourselves from this question of

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.400
causality i gotta stop you there because i talk with tom on a weekly basis and that's not true

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.760
well if you read his material including his book he actually goes into causations all through his

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:13.640
book and he's not i don't see him questioning why equals mx plus b in any of the things he does

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.680
and what i'm saying is if you're going to question the fundamentals then question all of them

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:23.320
tom absolutely question i can't express how ridiculous it is that he is saying

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.920
that if you're going to question the the tenets of reality then you got to go all the way back to our

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:42.280
the notion that we can find causality or identify it and also throw that out so he wants you to accept

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.480
a notion that you can know nothing there's no useful knowledge you cannot make progression

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.880
in knowing which is essentially what has broken science

01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:04.280
you can say it's p values and it's the use of p values to to prove things or to say that things

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.360
are real or to see a significant difference but in the end what it's really about

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.200
is this idea that we need to keep doing experiments because we never really learn anything from the

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:25.080
experiments now it's true the way that we do experiments in reductionist biology and we design

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.200
experiments with p values and then we use those p values as significant building blocks in our

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.440
theories that is an incorrect way to build understanding

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:47.320
but to say that we can't and we don't understand causality in reality in physics

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:55.560
in chemistry and that that causality at that level of understanding is not useful even if

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.000
the level of our understanding is incomplete even if we don't understand what atoms are we know a

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.280
lot about how chemistry works and we know a lot about how reactions will occur and those are

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:13.480
foundations of understanding that are lying are that exist within causality

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:21.160
and so his argument is is that because we can't know exactly what atoms are and that's

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:28.360
models completely based on conjecture and probably not real then everything we know about chemistry

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:36.600
is based on that that's as dumb as saying that the pandemic is based on PCR tests or is based on

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:43.400
sequencing the PC the pandemic was based on dead people chemistry is based on mixing things

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:47.400
together and getting the same thing to happen all the time we're predictable reactions

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.200
where the amount of things and moles and stuff like that actually calculate out pretty well

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.880
if we don't understand what atoms are that still doesn't mean that we can't that that does not

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:08.600
negate the fact that we can predict very accurately the outcome of chemical reactions to the gram

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:17.000
to milligram the nanogram based on the starting materials that understanding may be flawed by the

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.240
fact that we don't understand the atoms and our model of atoms is wrong but that doesn't change

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.840
the knowledge that we have in chemistry and this discussion of the idea that we have to go all

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.920
the way back to causality and mitt we don't have any his absurd

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.240
since all of them but that's like a separate point from here so one thing i will say that's

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:45.000
but that's the point point is there's nothing that deprives you or tom or anybody else of doing

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.560
the things that they're doing but you know i didn't take tom's videos and take potshots and say that

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.440
i'm going to lampoon an effort that's he's doing i'm not doing that well david i'll speak for myself

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.120
here without bringing other people at all for myself when you're here talking with me saying

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.960
that you agree with us falsifying their unproven ideas you agree with that you've established that

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:08.040
on this question yes but then when you speak publicly again just to address the people in the chat i'm

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:16.360
trying to make the argument that it's not the narrative alone if they only hyped it up it wouldn't work

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.480
there had to be people dying and there were people dying

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.160
because they were mistreated because there was a financial incentive to mistreat them

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:36.920
because there were orders to mistreat people and then those people were counted as part of the

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:45.400
narrative and then people saw those numbers people saw those bodies people saw the people

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.640
on the ventilators people put people on remdesivir those people died

01:22:53.080 --> 01:23:01.400
and when those people died that started a narrative about numbers if people also fixed the numbers

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.720
made the numbers grow bigger whatever those numbers convinced people

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:13.640
it wasn't the threat it wasn't the tick it was the culmination it was the sum total of all of it

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.440
but i assure you if there was not the number of people dying in new york city

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:29.160
and this big spike that the that the pbs news hour could point to and say look guys it

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:38.440
it looks like uh oh balls it looks like uh it looks like we're we're having some rise in cases

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:49.000
over the last two days and it looks like they're going up really fast so you know projected models

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.600
say that we're going to have a gigantic pandemic and for like three weeks they were able to say that

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.440
for three weeks another five thousand people were dead in new york city so they could keep

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:09.240
projecting and keep projecting and then extend the lockdown and then before you know it they

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.160
were paying attention to other places and other cities and the numbers weren't coming in

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:18.120
and now we're five weeks in and the numbers are still not coming in

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.720
but they're telling us that the that the curve is going to go up and up and up

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.880
wow look at my graphics today i'm just killing it

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:37.800
it's all about the worst case scenario it's all about these projections it's all about this blindness

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.040
and for some reason they're stuck on foyer requests they're stuck on isolation and purification

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:54.840
instead of on murder and the most important thing to understand and i can't stress it enough

01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:02.760
the most important thing to understand is that this shtick was uniformly stuck to by them

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.520
for nearly three years they didn't deviate from it they stuck to it from the beginning

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.160
from the very beginning from like february and march these people were on the same shtick

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.920
that there's no viruses no viruses that means that nobody's really dying and we don't need to talk

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.080
about it and that was wrong people were being killed and they were blaming it on the imaginary

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:38.520
virus and so why not use both of those arguments why not say that they're not isolating anything

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.400
they can't culture anything they're probably can't sequence anything the pcr tests don't mean

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:52.600
anything and they're using remdesivir and they're using vents incorrectly and all of these people

01:25:52.600 --> 01:26:00.360
that are dying are being called the new virus but instead they stop at isolation and purification

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:10.280
and then they do loop de loop de loop de loop de loop de loop de loop and they're still doing it

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:16.200
right now they're still there and now they're talking about whether we should even think to

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.280
to think that we can think of the cause of anything for those who are unfamiliar now

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.400
thank goodness that you've clarified what we're talking about when we say viral model or when

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.080
you're talking about literally one of your quotes stars one and oh three came from a laboratory in

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.280
chapel hill right though these are the type of statements that's a true statement that was a

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:36.360
toxin created in chapel hill it's amazing how he cuts him off correct correct like he doesn't let

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.920
him get the whole statement out it he covers up what he's saying it makes it hard for people to

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.640
hear him it's really impressive can you show me that there was a toxin created in chapel hill but

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:51.400
in the 2002 document very clearly says human respiratory target okay so with that though human

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.640
respiratory target when you say SARS-1 the implications of saying SARS-1 when we're talking about being

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.520
precise with speech that's reifying the virus belief system rather than saying why are we using

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:05.160
this word reify all the time in this podcast it's like the third time they've used it i don't

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.480
understand why they use that word all the time allegedly or this was delivered exclusively via

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.720
injection my point is the way that it's coming across for those who have not done the work to

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.640
look at the foundational so-called evidence of virology is it's reifying this idea that there is

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.640
a particle being passed from person to person and it's not helping to dispel more myths surrounding

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.080
that and your observation is correct and that is not my mission my mission is a criminal mission

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:35.000
not a scientific mission that's fair okay um i have a few more questions by the way Alec thank

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.880
you this is the kind of conversation we should be having agree that actually the right conversation

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:45.160
because it should be the legitimate and honest conflict of perspectives that ultimately gives

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.320
rise to a perspective that at the end none of us came in with that's the right way to advance

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.600
it might be a civilization yeah no i i think it's important to have these conversations and that's

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.080
why i'm going there i will say i still think that what you say i think the most important thing is

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.960
not his necklace but the fact that his the word on his shirt is upside down i don't i don't know

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.800
i don't know what that that would be but upside downwards are now never good they publicly

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.640
given what you're expressing here is very confusing for people who have not looked into

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.640
this stuff yeah but but that's the nature of courtrooms and that's a nature of legal systems i have to

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.600
live inside of legally defined terms like 18 us code i have to live inside a 21 CFR 50 you know

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:27.160
what that's like inside he has to live inside of legal codes he's not a lawyer i don't think i

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:32.840
just did it's weird that he's he's talking like this he's pretending like somehow has an independent

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.960
consultant for the last 25 years he's got to stick to certain norms out of a command and control

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.800
system in the military you know damn good and well that you can't just go well i don't think

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.080
that the concussive round of that grenade has the velocity that it says in the mill

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.680
spec so i'm not going to use it if you're told you're going to use that particular grenade guess

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.120
what you do you fucking pull the pen and throw it and the fact of the matter is you're you're

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.880
not in nobody's interested in whether or not you agree with the nature of the mill spec of that

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.080
ordinance you are asked to deploy that ordinance and that's what you are there to do so the issue

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.400
is a different one we don't necessarily have the time or the space and certainly i do not have

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.160
the time or the space or the patronage or anything else to get into every one of the topics that i

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.840
would love to cover yeah i do it's not going to be one of the topics it's a foundational topic

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.880
i spend a week every year with a group of interested people where we go through the

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:20.760
opening assumptions on every one of these things and guess what anybody's welcome to come to it

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.400
why why are you okay quick question though why are you attempting to debate from inside their

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.200
paradigm though instead of just showing i'm not debating inside their paradigm i'm actually

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:34.040
pursuing a criminal case okay that's not debating but again referring back to the situation with

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.120
marvin hattle and in germany there is precedent that arguing the position that there is no proof

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.800
of the alleged cause that necessitate the need for any of this stuff is a valid position and it

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.280
is the fundamental but not valid in any u.s court not valid in any u.s court every one of the court

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.320
efforts that have been made around that have been actually dismissed outright they've shown me examples

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.480
that they've been dismissed outright site specific ones listen every one of the cases that said that

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:58.840
there was no cause for the emergency authorization and there are gene didarian is the one that you

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.960
should reference because she's the one that actually this is a true step in lock and prove this important

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.120
step in lock of one in court in germany on his measles case i said in the united states there's

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.400
not a single case in the united states where the merits of this were even willing to be considered

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.160
by the court who's tried who's tried to come well we did in federal court and we were actually

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.360
dismissed for standing so did you say that there's no proof of the existence or pathogenicity of

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.040
sarsko b2 directly that's correct that's in the case read the federal case and we submitted that

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.840
in the federal court in utah okay i'd be interested stipulated that viruses exist and it's stipulated

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.760
that vaccines work and that's stipulated in a footnote so that's stipulated by a federal judge

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:36.920
okay and so according to david martin in federal law or state law of utah

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:45.480
viruses exist it is stipulated in law or court decision court law so has an interesting um

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:51.560
it's an interesting problem an interesting variable i have another set of questions regarding the

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:56.120
covid summit so um was this summit you're talking about like having to speak with the

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.360
language inside these courts where it makes you know it is using the language that they use

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.840
that they accept right so with this summit that occurred at the european european parliament um

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.560
was this actually an official gathering of the european parliament well in so far as the MEPs

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.840
of the european parliament where the hosts and the venue was the european parliament yes

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:16.840
was it a sitting of the full parliament absolutely not the full parliament was not impaneled for this

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:21.160
it was a european parliament event and there are tons of european parliament events that's the

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.400
nature of the european parliament where members of parliament as official sponsors and hosts

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.520
pulled parliament events so it was officially an eu event it was officially an european union

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.760
parliament event meaning that it followed the protocols of a MEP calling the meeting publishing

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.680
the meeting and being broadcast as a meeting of the european union but it was not a full

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:43.800
seating of the parliament yeah but i guess the the better question is um was this meeting held in

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.280
an official capacity by an official governing body or was it outside by the members of parliament

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.480
who hosted the event yeah but there's a difference between me inviting some congressmen and senators

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.680
to my house and having a discussion with them versus literally having an on-the-record hearing

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.880
that is everything everything in the MEP's jurisdiction is an on-the-record event in the european

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.440
union that's the nature of the european union bylaws okay um so and there there are more events

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.880
coming up this summer and i'm going to be participating in them as well well from what i've read it was

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:11.320
not an official or sanctioned event by the european parliament that's not true that's not true it was

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.800
an official sanctioned event by the european parliament absolutely as a matter of fact i have

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.640
the documentation that was all of the official materials we had to submit for eu review before

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:21.240
our slides were put up in our slides were officially okay so here they're debating something i don't

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.040
think they're meeting my uh meeting of the minds here

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:32.040
alic is trying to ask whether the parliament approved it like voted and approved it or whether

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:40.840
it was a meeting at the parliament which is what david is arguing so any group of european parliament

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:48.040
members can have an event that is of a parliament event where they invite people to talk about

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:53.640
something and then they can publicize it and they can use a room at the parliament they can use

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:59.960
a lecture hall and they can invite people and it's an official thing but it wasn't a meeting that

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:05.160
was called by the parliament like you know congress voted with a majority to say hey we're

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:10.520
gonna have hearings on this and that's what alic is asking him and that's what david martin is

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:15.480
pretending not to understand emblazon with the eu parliament logo because of that okay so whoever

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.520
is doing yes like the ron johnson meetings as good as other fact checkers

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.400
um okay and let me see what else i have we might have some questions from the audience

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:24.520
um

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.240
i guess more like speaking back to this this issue of using their language and attempting to argue

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:41.160
inside their paradigm again especially with the likes of the world health organization the cdc

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.040
uh bill gates the chair of davian several others talking about the next one

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.040
yeah and the majority of the health freedom movement holds the belief that there is indeed

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.640
pathogenic particles being passed from person to person do you think that that's an issue

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.440
so i think for example the i think there's no question that anthrax is a good example

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.600
was a domestic terrorism attack and i think real people in case of one person who i know

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.760
died from inhalation anthrax it's not a belief system it's a fact

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.720
okay there's no question that the tokyo subway bombing which was something that i had the

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.720
privilege of being part of the investigation team on there's no question in my mind that somebody

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.480
got into the air ducts in the tokyo subway system and murdered people with an aerosolized agent

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.560
and there's no question that the aerosolized agent was derived from a natural substance yeah

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.440
what we're talking about are we going to have another distribution of another thing which will

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.720
be used as the component that why no for another distribution of another weapon the answer is yes

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.160
okay so what i'm talking about though is there's a distinct difference between a transmissible

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.880
particle that replicates inside the host where it then causes illness and then

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.000
that's when you're fixed when you fix the church what do you mean by that what i said now on two

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:54.440
occasions that's a doctrine the doctrine is that there is an agency through which the transmission

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:59.480
of illness or death or in the case of the church shame and conviction is transmitted by virtue of

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.760
nothing that you do nothing that you say nothing that you can do nothing that you can say it just

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.720
happens and as long as we believe in a world where our picture of humanity is that humans

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.200
are a virus that transmits bad things to generations as long as we hold that belief in any part of

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.320
our system we're screwed so why is it okay wow that is unbelievable

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:25.320
that's really funny um wow that much of the health freedom movement has these unfounded

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.920
unproven beliefs especially as oh god there's so many things that the hell i'm talking specifically

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.200
to this one oh yeah i know but but but you have the luxury of looking at one thing i have the

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.360
luxury of looking at the whole thing i have the luxury of looking at the fact that i talk about

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.160
say it isn't i talk about the belief in illusion but i'm talking about the fact that most of the

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.840
health freedom movement turn covid into a money making scheme okay in what capacity well fundraising

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:51.000
donations program so is is david martin on the health freedom team is he talking also about

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:58.360
robert melon and all these other people who are making all this money is he is he seriously

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.120
who is he calling out here that the health freedom movement turned it into a money making scheme

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:08.280
who's the health freedom movement before covid

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:17.800
who is fighting for vaccine injured people before covid or were they still fighting about the

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:23.800
fact that viruses don't exist as a way of fighting it are you really fighting it then

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:33.960
you know are you really i mean don't you think then what you would be doing is fighting for

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:38.360
vaccine injured people on the basis that they were injected for something that doesn't exist

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:46.040
instead of fighting for what arguing that some guy in in germany who didn't want to take his measles

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:53.080
shot went to court and got away with it and you're sure that that court case is about the virus not

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:59.880
existing or the sum total the decision of the court which included also the idea of being

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:05.320
previously infected and also the idea that it's not really around that much anymore and also

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:13.240
many other claims or is it really just that that court case very specifically proved that there

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:20.440
was no measles see that's the also the joke that's happening here neither of these two is really

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:26.200
arguing from a totally genuine perspective and neither of them is arguing about the whole

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.520
picture of what really happened the real nuts and bolts of the fraud

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:40.040
and it's it's extraordinary it's extraordinary how much energy and time they wasted how

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.600
we are actually a little bit dumber for having shared this together tonight

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.680
I agree with that I'll tell you what if you profited from covid I don't care which side you're

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.760
on you're part of the racket so do you think people should not be compensated for their labor

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.800
to raise awareness I think they shouldn't be compensated for anything other than the direct

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.800
costs of actually moving information from point a to point b yes absolutely and I think that if

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:05.560
you are compensated for it you're part of the problem so raising awareness to true information

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.760
do you think people shouldn't be compensated for that I think for direct costs yes and for nothing

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:14.280
else okay that's a point of uh difference between us but again but that would be something that I

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.080
would actually say you know show me a person who's done what I've done globally on their own dime

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.440
with zero outside support David but what I'm asking though is very specific do you think

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.600
that's a point the point is if you want to solve the problem Alec listen you're picking one thing

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.040
I'm saying if you want to fix the problem I got a ton of problems that need fixing and I will go

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.280
after all of them but what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to say that one issue is the issue

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.640
that is the only issue that deserves attention the fact of the matter is we have got a human

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.040
condition problem and that human condition problem includes opportunism it includes propaganda

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:47.080
it includes distractions it includes all kinds of things and I'm more than happy to go out and

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.080
agree with them yeah I'm not going to pick a bandwagon that says that if you don't do this one

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.480
and and by the way it comes back to my bias I told you this my bias is I grew up in a world

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.960
where for the sake of a belief system in a god a child was worthy of being beaten

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.920
you know what I'm never going to do I'm never going to pick a belief system that is preeminent

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:12.680
you know why because I've seen where that cancer ends and it ends on my body and here's my reality

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.400
my reality is as soon as I hear somebody tell me that this is the most important issue there's a

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.120
four-year-old boy in me that feels lemon thorns going through my flesh and guess what I'm not going

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.440
to do I'm not going to be part of that system so you may think that this is the most important

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:29.720
thing and god bless you if you do because I'm glad that something motivates you into action and

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.280
I'm celebrating that every day but if you think that your cause or anybody thinks their cause

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:39.480
is the most important cause then my four-year-old memory feels lemon thorns ripping my skin apart

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:43.880
and I'm not going to participate in any system where we actually think that we can pick the topic

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.680
around which the proof texting of are you in or are you out is the determinant of whether

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.360
you're contributing to civil society because if you've decided that issue is I know I know I don't

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.200
do that first off first off I don't do that second off what I'm talking to ask me to do

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.680
something that's outside of my remit my remit is not to debate viruses my remake is to hold people

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.600
accountable for criminal acts that they perpetrated on society that's my remit you do yours I'll do

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.760
mine and I will respect yours but don't despair because you are this is fantastic

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:15.080
where did that all looks like he flipped a switch and he suddenly felt attacked and he had to say

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:21.000
wow I mean wow better or worse here brother like what I'm saying is literally taking your

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.880
statements right that are public statements that are one of them or the prosecution of crime

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.080
David you keep interrupting me dude I'm trying to every time for the prosecution of crimes

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:34.440
you are trying to pull me into your dogma and I will not dogma it's not dogma point me to dogma

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.240
Alec you know what you haven't offered an alternative hypothesis

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.560
they've criticized the existing incumbent lie that's not true you do that during the end of

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.760
covid we absolutely do that during the end of covid i've done it so you don't tell me how you're

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.320
dealing no tell me how you're doing this conversation around it try to tell me how you do

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.080
it's on valence excitation of of neutron frequencies you're not talking about that we present we actually

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.760
know we do we talk about that you actually come because I read it okay you do that during the

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.400
covid we absolutely do that during the end of covid i've done it no you don't

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.040
it's like tell me how you're dealing no tell me how you're doing this conversation around it

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.280
trying to tell me how you're doing this conversation about valence excitation of

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.080
of neutron frequencies you're not talking about that we present we actually know we do we talk

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.480
about that you actually come because I've read it really you've read all of you yes and the fact

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:16.120
is very simple the fact is really simple i'm not criticizing your efforts what i'm not saying is

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:21.400
you didn't do anything to i gotta tell you i i want to watch this at full at normal speed because

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:27.240
i'm starting to think that this is fake i'm starting to think that this feels really bad

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.120
and i need to see it at regular speed because i'm starting to feel like i'm getting fooled

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:43.800
um i don't know how i do that why can't i see that sorry let me just get yeah that's fine

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:50.600
wow this is really strange this i don't know why this went so south here i'm sorry i got to do this

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.120
opportunism it includes propaganda it includes distractions it includes all kinds of things

01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:01.480
and i'm more than happy to go after all of them yeah i'm not going to pick a bandwagon that says

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:07.960
that if you don't do this one and and by the way it comes back to my bias i told you this my bias

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:18.520
is i grew up in a world where for the sake of a belief system in a god a child was worthy of being

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:25.160
beaten you know what i'm never going to do i'm never going to pick a belief system that is

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:32.120
preeminent you know why because i've seen where that cancer ends and so his parents his men and

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:37.640
night parents that took him to New Zealand to build windmills and stuff as part of charitable

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:45.400
organization and charitable work beat him i think that's what he's saying is this this is what you're

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:54.600
hearing right where for the sake of a belief system in a god a child was worthy of being beaten

01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.360
wow you know what i'm never going to do wow i'm never going to pick a belief system that is

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:06.360
preeminent i've never heard of many nights beating their kids where that cancer ends and it ends

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:13.880
on my body and here's my reality my reality is as soon as i hear somebody tell me that this is

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:20.920
the most important issue there's a four-year-old boy in me that feels lemon thorns going through

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:28.040
my flesh and guess what i'm not going to do i'm not going to be part of that system so you may

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.520
think that this is the most important thing and god bless you if you do because i'm glad that

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.720
something motivates you into action and i'm celebrating that every day but if you think that

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:44.600
your cause or anybody thinks their cause is the most important cause then my four-year-old memory

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:51.160
feels lemon thorns ripping my skin apart and i'm not going to participate in any system

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:58.520
where we actually think that we can pick the topic around which the proof texting of are you

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:03.880
in or are you out is the determinant of whether you're contributing to civil society because if

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.480
you've decided i don't do that issue is i'm out time out i don't do that first off first off

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.080
i don't do that second off what i'm talking about then don't ask me to do something that's

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:19.480
outside of my remit my remit is not to debate viruses my remit is to hold people accountable

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:25.080
not to debate viruses perpetrated on society didn't he debate it now for one hour and 14

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:30.280
minutes that's weird that's my remit you do yours i'll do mine and i will respect yours but don't

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.400
disparage mine because you are better because it's not about that i'm not saying who's better

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:42.520
or what in the world i'm saying is literally taking your statements right that are public

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:47.960
statements that are really one of them or the prosecution of crime david you keep interrupting

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:55.000
me dude i'm trying to every time for the prosecution of crimes you are trying to pull me into your

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.960
dogma and i will not wow it's not dog what in the world

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:06.200
allak you know what you haven't offered an alternative hypothesis

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.600
that you can criticize the existing incumbent lie that's not true you do that during the end of

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.200
covid we absolutely do that during the end of covid i've done it so you don't

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.880
yes i tell me how you're dealing no tell me no we're not going to turn this conversation around

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.360
and try to put it back on me i'm asking you valence excitation of of nutrient frequencies

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.280
you're not talking about that we present we actually know we do we talk about you actually

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:34.360
don't because i've read it okay really you've read all of you so yes and the fact is very simple

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:41.080
the fact is really simple i'm not criticizing your efforts what i'm not saying is you didn't do

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:44.360
anything to support the criminal investigation i'm not i'm not interested in doing that i'm trying

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.840
to get this this this segment is called clarifying the viral narrative because i'm trying to get

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.240
clarity on where you're coming from so and i'm very clear on where i'm coming from and i'm

01:45:53.240 --> 01:46:00.440
clear about the context in which i'm coming david again let me reemphasize here first off

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.560
neutral frequencies baby when i'm trying to get out what i'm trying to say one and two

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:11.880
all i'm trying to do is get clarity on where you're coming from this whole time because the things

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.960
you say publicly seem to for a large number of people not just myself

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:23.720
reify the existence of pathogenic viruses it's like the fifth time they've said reify

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.680
david in your communication on multiple occasions i have several quotes here

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:36.840
coming from multiple videos they seem to reify this idea that disease is transmitted from person

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:43.400
to person and you're sitting here telling me never once i've implied it david

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:50.200
i have provided written evidence of written publications aleck and quoting a thing is not a

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:57.080
belief it is merely quoting a thing okay bobby would say that about his book we're at an uh at an

01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.840
impasse here then no we're not we're actually celebrating the fact that you are on a mission

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:11.560
and i respect it and what i do not appreciate is the vitriol that the whatever dogmatic position

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:17.160
you're representing oh here we go appreciate the fact that what's happened is you've elected to

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.840
tear down i mean calling it a dogmas insulting aleck he's very mad because he thinks he's fighting

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:29.240
the dogma of viruses so if you say that his dogma of terrain theory or his dogma of there is no

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:41.560
viruses or his dogma of of cellular like waste material um cells taking a poop is is his like

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:47.000
it's extraordinary it's extraordinary the work that i'm doing where not once have i torn down

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.560
the work others are doing and what am i tearing when what we're tearing down your work during

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:58.040
you had people wagering on how quickly you would quote destroy me that was your community

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:04.040
when you're twin i know i know that you had no problem so seriously i can't tell you how much

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:10.600
i think that this is a joke i think it's actually a joke like they're arguing and it might be that

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:19.240
that that um the david is playing the role and but it really feels a lot like when when

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:26.360
when kevin mccarron and and paul cattrell went at it in our early streams and pretended to

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.920
argue with each other it it really feels like these two are setting you know it's like when

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:39.880
sam harrison and sam harris and bret weinstein have been arguing over the last few months or

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:47.960
or purported to argue it's the same way that tim pool and sam cedar argue on on the youtube

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:55.640
these guys are it's some kind of interesting interaction where nothing ever happens nothing

01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:04.840
ever gets done but more importantly the words remdesivir the words protocols mandazalam ventilators

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:10.040
antibiotics steroids do not resuscitate orders financial incentives opioid epidemic

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.680
none of those things ever came up in this entire conversation not even once not once

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:24.440
the same exact way that massy talks about it the same exact way tom kawan talks about it the same

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:31.400
exact way they all talk about it the thing that you have to accept is that they didn't

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:37.720
isolate or purify the virus and the whole basis of everything is purification isolation and

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:44.680
sequencing of a virus and that is wrong hey the whole basis for this is the mass casualty events

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:50.840
that were orchestrated around the earth publicized and used as evidence for spread of a pathogen

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.880
that scared everybody into behaving like idiots for three years

01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.760
and so you don't need to fight about that when you can fight about the murder

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:05.640
and you can bring attention to the murder and show that there's no mathematical reason to talk about

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.400
a novel spreading pathogen and maybe later we'll figure out that these people have been lying

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:17.400
or very much misconstruing their molecular data but if you do it the other way around

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:25.720
where everybody's got to accept the entire model of of viral pathogens is wrong before they have

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:32.600
to accept that everybody was murdered when one is very concrete very easy to justify there's all

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:38.120
kinds of evidence for it and and there are people that have been trying to to go down that avenue

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:43.880
for years and these people won't talk to them these people don't want to interact with them

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:49.560
because these people are not yet willing to accept the premises of their whole life which is that

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:55.640
none of this stuff is real apparently and that you if you haven't read farewell to virology and

01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:04.600
then kowtow to the New Zealand wonders then we won't talk to you but even David Martin said

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:10.440
it here very very well just like I said it yesterday you guys don't offer any alternative

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.640
and then they were talking about neutron frequencies what in the world

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:25.800
I just got to say I think we're making a lot of progress here I think we're really starting to

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:32.760
see past this nonsense and I if this was a long hour before it started to really break down and

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:38.360
before I really started to see it for what it is but it really feels like they're going to turn

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.920
the cameras off and you're going to find out that they're in the same house and they're going to

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:51.880
have a scotch and he his wife his his funny spunky Australian wife is actually sitting in the other

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:57.720
room drinking with Alex wife that's what I think the time out you're saying that I waged war

01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:01.640
against you is that what you're implying that's no question you actually set it out right you lie

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:13.080
public about the fact that I did I correct that did I correct that publicly but it didn't stop

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:19.240
the vitriol and it didn't stop the fact that all over Twitter and all over social media you

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:24.840
and your quotes are the ones that were actually used to allegedly wager how quickly you would

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:29.800
carry a look on any of there there have been several so-called no-virus people that have

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:34.520
distanced themselves from me because I'm calling them to communicate more kindly and more effectively

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.560
and more lovingly so that's all I'm doing right now what I'm saying is very simple no you're

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.720
are the ones that were actually used to allegedly wager how quickly you would carry a look on any

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:50.680
of there there have been several so-called no-virus people that have distanced themselves from me

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:55.880
because I'm calling them to communicate more kindly and more effectively and more lovingly so

01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:01.080
that's not all I'm doing interesting I wonder who those no-virus people are that don't want him

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:06.200
to be so nice thing right now what I'm saying is very simple no you're you're you're making claims

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:15.560
about me no put my comments into the context that I am doing and then tell me what is inconsistent

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:21.480
what you're trying to do is you're trying to write my comments into a different conversation

01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:28.440
and what I'm holding you accountable for is I am pursuing a legal case and that is my pursuit

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:35.080
I am not pursuing a question of science because that is not what I am pursuing and if that is the

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:40.680
topic that we are going to talk about then I'm more than happy to go into that but not in the context

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:45.480
of what I'm doing right now because my focus is singular and that is there was crimes committed

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:51.320
resulting in the death of humans I agree with you I will disagree with you need to be prosecuted

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:58.200
and that is what I'm doing okay and what I am saying is I agree with you but the way you communicate

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:04.280
reifies the existence of the fundamental thing that necessitates the need for all these things

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:11.880
and leads to the development of these products that are killing people and you just stated a

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.680
causal statement and what I'm saying is I'm not going to sit here and pretend like you're right

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:21.720
or wrong because I'm telling you what I'm doing and you are deriving from it that I'm

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:26.920
reifying a system and what I'm doing is I'm simply saying I'm using their evidence to hold them

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:35.720
accountable okay all right well I don't have much else to say David thank you for joining me

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:41.720
I agree I think I trust Alec just a little bit more in this theater than I do David Martin but in

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:52.360
the end I don't trust either of them I think that this is a this was a a WWF battle between two

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:59.560
people that essentially have shared a table before maybe even a game this out beforehand and it

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.920
escalated at the very end I think because they had planned to end it that way and that's why it

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.240
also felt a little weird that all of a sudden David Martin just kicked it all up they're probably

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.120
looking at the same chat there's probably several people helping them do this there's

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:19.800
probably a script and then they said okay let's end it let's wrap it up right here David your Q is

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:30.520
now that's what I see here I see fake and I think it's just another another brick in the wall I

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:36.120
think it's another one of these performers who is basically preserving this narrative one way or

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.040
another by talking around it even if David said some combinations of words that made Alec a little

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:51.720
happier it's very very impressive because the no-virus people are completely against the faith

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:58.280
but they are also really not willing to test it in any meaningful manner

01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:07.000
it's a great game of chess ladies and gentlemen if you think that you know who's fighting and

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:13.560
who's free or wrong chances are very good that most of the arguments that you've seen have been

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:19.880
staged most of those arguments are people that are working together or working for competing

01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:27.640
interests who are working together to do the train narrative to turn these these excess deaths these

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:36.200
mysterious excess deaths into a mysterious virus by avoiding doing the math of subtracting all

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:43.800
of the other known causes of death here if you don't do the math then there's room for a mystery

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.840
virus if you do the math there's no room for a mystery virus so you don't need to talk about

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:54.440
isolation you don't need to talk about lab leaks you don't need to talk about any of that stuff

01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:01.000
but the point is is that during the pandemic they've been faking the need to talk about that

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.400
stuff faking the need to debate about what novel treatments are necessary faking the need to

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:13.800
debate about what novel vulnerabilities there are what novel mechanisms could result in severe

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:20.600
covid what all different things can happen from this Swiss army knife of spike proteins and these

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:26.520
debates were used by many different people who stayed out of each other's way to make sure that

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:33.080
they'd ever crossed the line and encroached on each other's books and debated about everybody

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:37.880
being vulnerable to the novel virus debated about how accurate PCR was or whether they were

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:43.400
overcycling it debated about what early treatments were relevant hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:50.280
debated about who should use steroids when debated about these protocols debated about

01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:57.800
the financial incentives and all of these stories very casually or sorry very coordinatedly

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.560
rolled out and orchestrated so that they didn't encroach on each other

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.080
fooled us into believing that there was a pandemic fooled us into believing

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:15.480
that all of them through their hard work and dissidents saved us from the pandemic

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:23.400
saved us from the shot saved us from disaster from these bad guys but nobody was saved

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.680
nobody's talking about the people that were murdered and nobody was saved from the shot

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.040
because everybody that spoke out about the shot that had any impact at all came out too late

01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.280
and everybody that came out early enough was systematically censored and silenced

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:47.880
not given new social platforms not interviewed by Tucker Carlson about their cancellation on

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:58.200
LinkedIn but actually silenced there are three different scenarios that they want you to think

01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:04.440
you need to argue about and all of them starred in 2019 with a leak or an accident or a batcave

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:12.600
and then a pathogen made of RNA and lipoprotein was able to make trillions and trillions and

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:19.320
quadsillions of copies of itself and infiltrate almost every living human lung on the planet

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:25.240
and although we made some mistakes the illusion of consensus is that millions of people died

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:30.280
and millions more were saved the illusion of consensus and the faith in the novel virus

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:36.040
includes asymptomatic transmission and the fact that we work on gated function because we have to

01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:45.880
and these people have been feigning a resistance to this for three and a half almost four years now

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.840
feigning a resistance to this

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:56.280
because none of them are able to add up everything none of them are able to present you the whole

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.760
picture all of them are stuck on one thing you could be stuck on ivermectin for a whole year

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:08.600
and that would have gotten you lots of traction in social media you can be stuck on hydroxychloroquine

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:13.320
for a year and that will give you lots of traction in social media if you start talking about the

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:19.560
opioid epidemic and how it contributes to excess deaths nowhere crickets if you start talking

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:25.160
about how remdesivir they want happens they get you to talk about venom in this shots and now

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:28.520
you're discredited and now nobody talks about remdesivir anymore

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.560
the conflated background signal is the thing they don't talk about the protocols is the

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:42.520
thing they don't talk about and they have to not talk about it because they are taking everything

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:49.320
away this is for all the marbles don't forget it it's for all the marbles stop transfection

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:53.000
and humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.600
i'm sorry i'm for it for all these exhausted streams i'm going to keep doing them i'm going to try

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.720
and move up earlier during the day try to get in before back so i'll practice because i'll have a

02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:08.840
little more energy and because it'll be better for me because i'll get to go and maybe hang out with

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:15.480
my wife before we go to sleep rather than three hours after she falls asleep so anyway thank you

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:20.520
for joining me this has been giggle and biological where we understand that intramuscular injection

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:24.840
of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.080
we understand that transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and we understand

02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:34.760
that viruses are not pattern integrity and therefore the fidelity with which we are told

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.040
that they are understood is a lie and that's very different than saying that there are no viruses

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:46.840
because they can make RNA in quantity and they can't spray it and they can't transfect people

02:01:46.840 --> 02:02:02.760
and transfection can make people sick so anyway i'll see you guys thanks for joining me

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:44.120
Goodnight Ohmies
