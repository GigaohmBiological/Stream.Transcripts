00:16.502 --> 00:32.431
Testing 123, CQCQ, CQDX, CQDX, W3JJW, Whiskey3, Juliet Juliet Whiskey calling CQDX.

00:34.152 --> 00:36.313
Anybody out there, CQCQ?

00:38.355 --> 00:39.275
Good to see you, Tony.

00:39.655 --> 00:40.616
You are number one.

00:42.196 --> 00:45.138
Not only in the chat, but also in my book today.

00:45.218 --> 00:46.259
Thank you very much, sir.

00:46.959 --> 00:56.947
Thank you for answering my call You're coming in five by nine And uh, this is the charlie rose show October 10th 2007.

00:57.347 --> 01:10.156
I'm gonna run an intro so feel free to Feel free to tweet it out or send out an extra alert to those people that you love that we are going live Thanks for joining me Oh

01:10.629 --> 01:32.068
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

01:33.629 --> 01:34.610
But I know for sure

01:34.997 --> 01:52.442
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

01:55.178 --> 02:01.322
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:01.742 --> 02:04.785
But actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:04.865 --> 02:14.332
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, or, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:14.352 --> 02:20.937
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:50.319 --> 02:51.549
Yeah.

03:23.035 --> 03:24.936
Summer's out of reach.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.058
Empty lake, empty streets.

03:27.138 --> 03:28.679
The sun goes down alone.

03:28.739 --> 03:32.642
I'm driving by your house.

03:33.222 --> 03:35.284
No, no, you're not home.

03:35.484 --> 03:36.845
But I can see you.

03:37.025 --> 03:39.647
Your brown skin shining in the sun.

03:39.687 --> 03:45.792
You got your hair curled back and your sunglasses on, baby.

03:52.287 --> 03:57.994
Yeah, the boys are so out of control

04:19.650 --> 04:34.315
I never will forget those nights I wonder if it was a dream Remember how you made me crazy Remember how I made you scream I don't understand what happened to our love

04:35.815 --> 04:38.316
But babe, I'm gonna get you back.

04:38.436 --> 04:41.356
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

04:41.596 --> 04:42.457
I can see you.

04:42.597 --> 04:45.477
Your brown skin shining in the sun.

04:45.497 --> 04:49.678
I see you walking real slow and you smile at everyone.

04:49.698 --> 04:58.300
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys and summer have gone.

05:04.862 --> 05:05.082
you.

05:46.783 --> 05:51.426
Out on the road today, I saw a dead head sticker on a Cadillac.

05:51.507 --> 05:56.530
A little voice inside my head said, don't look back.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.232
You can never look back.

05:58.312 --> 06:04.516
I thought I knew what love was, but did I know those days are gone forever?

06:04.636 --> 06:06.798
I should just let them go.

06:10.663 --> 06:26.816
Your broad skin shining in the sun You've got the top girl down, lady around, baby I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys and summer have gone

06:32.520 --> 06:38.928
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone home

07:17.830 --> 07:17.930
you

07:47.082 --> 07:49.023
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

07:50.103 --> 07:54.865
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.407
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

07:59.587 --> 08:00.388
It's embarrassing.

08:09.652 --> 08:10.732
Hey, why aren't you playing?

08:12.313 --> 08:12.913
What the hell?

08:14.534 --> 08:15.054
That's weird.

08:17.964 --> 08:18.624
Hello?

08:20.165 --> 08:20.705
Start!

08:24.807 --> 08:26.588
What in the world is going on here?

08:27.848 --> 08:36.692
Okay, uh... Come on, what happened there?

08:37.252 --> 08:39.193
Everything was just fine a second ago.

08:40.033 --> 08:40.954
What in the world?

09:02.398 --> 09:04.540
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.023
We're here to break the enchantment of the charlatans that we inherited from our parents.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.947
The message still remains the same.

09:14.716 --> 09:28.439
It's not just the charlatans that were on TV in the PBS NewsHour, it's also the charlatans that were on Twitter, and now called X, that were on Facebook, and Gab, and locals, and Discord groups.

09:29.199 --> 09:37.941
You see, the fifth generation warfare that Robert Malone pretends to warn you about in his upcoming book to be released in October is actually him!

09:38.661 --> 09:40.842
It's actually him and all the lies that he's told.

09:40.902 --> 09:56.930
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm an academic biologist, recovering akademagician, and I used to be a patch clamp physiologist where I used microscopes and borosilicate glass electrodes to record from individual neurons and brain slices of mice and monkeys.

09:58.210 --> 10:02.773
And I really wanted to be a biology teacher, and I worked really, really hard.

10:03.593 --> 10:07.035
to try and get the opportunity to become one at a university.

10:07.915 --> 10:11.817
I worked at universities in Norway, the Netherlands, America.

10:12.437 --> 10:17.039
My last place of faculty was at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

10:17.519 --> 10:28.064
You can still find the stain of my work on PubMed and the list is still getting longer because that's how it works when you have a real track record with real work being done.

10:29.645 --> 10:38.432
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to have a new consensus about intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system being dumb.

10:38.912 --> 10:44.296
We need to have a new consensus about transfection in healthy humans being always criminally negligent.

10:44.917 --> 10:51.542
And we need to have a new understanding in our young people that viruses are not pattern integrities and therefore RNA cannot pandemic.

10:52.042 --> 10:56.346
This is a mythology that they want us to teach our children that they have attempted to coerce us

10:56.986 --> 11:00.408
into teaching our children and we must avoid it.

11:02.089 --> 11:09.574
What they've done is they've taken this excess deaths and they've misconstrued it with a mystery virus.

11:10.115 --> 11:19.021
And just like they're misconstruing a well-rehearsed actor with somebody wearing headphones, I assure you,

11:20.061 --> 11:26.443
Kamala is not wearing earbuds as pearls because they could just as easily put something in her ear that you couldn't see.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.023
They do that all the time.

11:28.143 --> 11:34.005
So the idea that they're focused on that earring just makes it more of a debunkable thing.

11:34.065 --> 11:36.386
Like a lot of these other things were very debunkable.

11:37.066 --> 11:58.420
And as a result, we focused on a few things while the reality was that the truth of supplementary oxygen, ventilators, poor antibiotic use, the overuse of steroids like dexamethasone, these things were all hidden behind an illusion of consensus about something spreading and the fact that something like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine was helping treat it.

11:58.840 --> 12:15.088
And so instead of talking about strict liability and restoring it to all pharmaceutical products, instead of talking about how the Seventh Amendment is being violated by these laws which support the vaccine schedule in America, these people focused on a few tiny parts of the narrative.

12:15.868 --> 12:30.574
a limited spectrum of debate and that limited spectrum of debate specifically hid the murder and lies that were being misconstrued as a novel virus and so they needed people on tv yes but they also needed people on social media

12:31.334 --> 12:41.985
to never come to the conclusion that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, even though that's what Robert Malone originally opened with in a few of his podcasts in 2021.

12:42.485 --> 12:48.771
They need to protect the idea that the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise, and that's why they murdered and lied about it.

12:49.412 --> 12:56.475
They definitely need your kids to grow up thinking that RNA can pandemic and that's why they murdered and lied about it.

12:56.675 --> 12:57.195
It cannot.

12:57.816 --> 13:00.637
RNA cannot pandemic and that's what we need to teach our kids.

13:01.157 --> 13:14.943
If we stick to their illusion of consensus, if we keep fighting for one team or the other and arguing on behalf of these people, we will never get ourselves and our young people out of this because we will end up

13:15.643 --> 13:23.349
fearing free-range RNA molecules or RNA viruses or being so naive that we would accept that there are no RNAs.

13:23.689 --> 13:25.230
There's no RNA or DNA anywhere.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.251
It doesn't float around.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.233
There's no signaling at this time scale.

13:29.273 --> 13:31.134
There's no signaling at this size scale.

13:31.154 --> 13:34.056
There's no packet communication between healthy tissues.

13:34.517 --> 13:35.938
None of this stuff is relevant.

13:36.578 --> 13:37.419
There's no disease.

13:41.545 --> 13:48.931
Ladies and gentlemen, by engaging in social media, you have gotten into the chair, put on the goggles, grabbed the joystick, and joined a team.

13:48.951 --> 13:53.595
And one team fighting the other team is not going to win because the blue team over here

13:54.775 --> 13:57.896
This team right here behind me, these guys are all bad guys too.

13:58.677 --> 14:10.601
Wittingly or unwittingly, they're part of the show, and that was the whole point of Twitter and the whole point of social media being used against us in the way that Aldous Huxley said it would be used against us.

14:10.642 --> 14:17.924
We just didn't imagine that they would have such a thorough control of it by putting their highly trained acolytes there.

14:18.285 --> 14:23.407
We never imagined that their highly trained acolytes would perform a show that would involve somebody on 60 Minutes.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.241
and somebody in DITRA.

14:27.302 --> 14:34.407
They never imagined that it would involve somebody who worked for the Department of Energy and the Human Genome Project and somebody who worked for DITRA.

14:34.447 --> 14:39.991
They never imagined it would be a person who worked for NATO as a postdoc in virology.

14:40.371 --> 14:44.134
They never imagined, we never imagined it could possibly be a Kennedy kid.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.596
And that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

14:47.656 --> 14:49.418
I hate to break it to you, but that's where we are.

14:49.458 --> 14:59.925
The reason why these truths haven't gotten out is because of these people and are engaging in the illusion of consensus and fighting it in their chair.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.229
Fighting it with their methods, with their social media, thinking that the next tweet was gonna win.

15:05.710 --> 15:09.132
And it will never win as long as these people are between us and the truth.

15:09.993 --> 15:10.814
That's how they did it.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.256
That's how they did it.

15:14.130 --> 15:19.632
Weaponized piles of money have used their acolytes on social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

15:19.672 --> 15:23.154
Participating in the argument accepts the premise of their narrative by default.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.995
That's how they got us to believe in a novel virus.

15:26.015 --> 15:28.136
That's how they got us to believe in nuclear weapons.

15:28.176 --> 15:32.318
That's how they got us to believe in most of the things, whether or not they're true.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.700
Whether or not they're true doesn't really matter.

15:37.614 --> 15:52.576
If you want people to believe that bioterrorism can occur in a garage with the right graduate student and the right purchases on eBay, then you send Robert Malone to the UK Parliament in an auxiliary room and have him give a talk about it.

15:54.645 --> 16:02.473
and promote that on social media in a consensus appearing sort of way with lots of people agreeing that Robert Malone is a hero.

16:02.893 --> 16:08.219
And now suddenly Robert Malone is on the cusp of becoming something very important in the Trump administration.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.502
This is, this cannot be allowed to happen.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.429
And so here we are, um,

16:19.963 --> 16:28.338
We are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms and includes all sides of their mythology.

16:28.939 --> 16:30.402
And so here we are again.

16:32.367 --> 16:39.493
not realizing that they would do it with everything, still unable to grasp the idea that they would do it with everything.

16:39.553 --> 16:57.448
And yet for me, one of the questions that still sits in my head is that given what I know about Donald Trump and given what I know about his braggadocious sons, it's very hard for me to imagine that their father was shot in the ear like Evander Holyfield was bit in the ear.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.890
And then we see no pictures of the scar.

17:01.423 --> 17:06.727
No sons bragging about either the scar or the fact that his father healed without a scar.

17:11.071 --> 17:23.080
And we had a uniform illusion of consensus across the meddler field that we had to talk about multiple shooters and not talk about Matthew Crooks.

17:24.281 --> 17:27.744
We had to talk about the water tower and not Matthew Crooks.

17:29.773 --> 17:39.643
And the funny thing is, is what we also didn't talk about is the photo op, is the blood in the ear, is what happens when an ear gets hit by any projectile.

17:41.745 --> 17:50.314
We have pathologists and biologists telling us to pay attention to the shooters and analyzing over multiple days the audio from different videos.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.964
to make arguments about how many different shooters there were.

17:54.744 --> 18:00.386
Imagine the preposterousness of this theater, and yet we all went along with it for multiple weeks.

18:03.287 --> 18:09.489
And now we've just seen Trump on TV with no discussion of him being, where's the scar?

18:10.289 --> 18:18.932
He wore a Band-Aid, a giant pad on his ear for the Republican National Convention.

18:20.106 --> 18:27.692
And millions of Americans, I think, or maybe thousands also wore a thing on their ear in solidarity.

18:29.830 --> 18:36.513
And so what do we do when we argue about the audiophiles of the day in Butler, Pennsylvania?

18:36.553 --> 18:41.634
What do we do when we argue about multiple shooters and possibly one on the water tower using a zip line?

18:42.175 --> 18:50.738
What do we do when we go and interview a bunch of people who say that somebody in a hangar in a golf cart said something about something and saw something else?

18:52.540 --> 18:54.221
We accept that Donald Trump was shot.

18:54.601 --> 19:04.124
What do we accept when we argue about whether or not ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine are being covered up by the FDA as being suitable repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID?

19:04.424 --> 19:05.524
We accept COVID.

19:09.946 --> 19:12.567
And so we need to start to learn.

19:14.005 --> 19:28.635
how to break through this narrative by figuratively getting out of that chair, figuratively removing the goggles, figuratively releasing the joystick, taking your feet off the pedals and getting out of the chair.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.059
And I think the way we do that is by studying.

19:34.159 --> 19:38.462
I think the way we do that is by studying what has been said over many, many, many years.

19:39.543 --> 19:42.225
My latest acquisition, which makes me very excited,

19:43.382 --> 19:46.645
is this book called The Phenomenon of Man.

19:46.685 --> 20:00.436
This is a book that was cited by Peter Hotez in 2024 in an opinion piece that he wrote about vaccines and said that this book was a foundation of his thinking and the thinking of public health in general.

20:01.217 --> 20:02.678
This book is phenomenal.

20:02.878 --> 20:09.804
Quite frankly, I would say that this book is on par or better than

20:11.897 --> 20:12.858
Now it all disappeared.

20:12.898 --> 20:13.719
Where the hell did it go?

20:14.439 --> 20:16.481
I must have put it... Maybe I... Oh no, it's right here.

20:17.502 --> 20:18.864
It's even better than this book.

20:20.085 --> 20:28.333
And the crazy part about this is that, as you know, this book, Man and His Future... I don't know if this will work or not.

20:28.353 --> 20:28.753
Let me see.

20:28.893 --> 20:29.113
Yes.

20:30.374 --> 20:32.456
Man and His Future from 1963.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.953
had an introduction by Julian Huxley.

20:37.993 --> 20:40.375
He's the guy who does it, right?

20:40.455 --> 20:43.158
He's the dude who does the first chapter.

20:43.698 --> 20:50.243
And so then if we look carefully at this book, it's really interesting because the introduction is by Sir Julian Huxley.

20:51.685 --> 20:52.986
And so when was this book written?

20:58.190 --> 20:58.690
This book is 1955.

20:58.730 --> 21:00.392
So this book is 10 years before

21:03.661 --> 21:05.943
the man and his future book.

21:07.984 --> 21:20.712
And so now I think we've finally, with the help of Mark's work, we've really kind of narrowed down the sort of mentor chain that I think we need to pay attention to.

21:21.973 --> 21:28.157
And so I'm really excited because Mark has been archiving, archiving, archiving, which is what I guess what he does,

21:29.378 --> 21:32.301
and finding things and following these mentors back.

21:32.381 --> 21:37.006
And one of the guys that has been kind of popping up over and over again is Jeffrey Sachs.

21:37.046 --> 21:44.034
Jeffrey Sachs, as far as I recall, now somebody can correct me, I'm not trying to tell a false story.

21:44.094 --> 21:47.478
I really believe this in my head is true, that I was told

21:48.570 --> 21:50.812
Or I heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:50.952 --> 21:57.157
tell somebody that he knew Jeffrey Sachs, has known Jeffrey Sachs for a very long time.

21:57.197 --> 22:06.044
And when they were younger, I believe that I heard a story that him and Bobby Kennedy spent a couple nights in a tent in Africa.

22:07.020 --> 22:09.081
And all that means is that they traveled together.

22:09.141 --> 22:11.281
All that means is they've known each other for a long time.

22:11.721 --> 22:17.563
And if you research and do the due diligence and just go and you do the easy thing.

22:17.603 --> 22:25.105
Go on Spotify and find the Defender podcast and look for the two times where Jeffrey Sachs was on with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:25.145 --> 22:30.247
And you will see that he gets introduced as an old friend and he gets introduced as one of his biggest heroes.

22:31.027 --> 22:35.090
And so Jeffrey Sachs is also a very prominent speaker at the Vatican.

22:36.691 --> 22:48.600
He's also a guy who had some kind of offline conversation with Charles Rixey and Kevin McCarran that I couldn't be part of because I was taking my family camping that weekend.

22:49.790 --> 22:53.412
but it supposedly happened and you can still find streams where they're talking about that.

22:53.492 --> 23:06.278
So it's a very curious player because of course, Jeffrey Sachs being also attached to the Vatican is also keenly attached to the UN and to China and to these globalist organizations.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.438
He's an economist.

23:07.558 --> 23:11.320
So he's got his fingers in many places.

23:11.440 --> 23:19.144
And so it's a very curious thing to see him on Charlie Rose in 2007, talking about malaria vaccines,

23:19.824 --> 23:27.587
Talking about with with Peter Hotez and a guy by the name of Paul nurse And so it's gonna take me a while to break all this down.

23:27.627 --> 23:29.168
What's happening in this video?

23:29.968 --> 23:34.490
And but it plays back into my biology 101 series it plays back into everything.

23:34.550 --> 23:43.973
It's just spectacular so shout out to Mark Kulak of Housatonic live for finding this video and for For calling it to my attention.

23:44.033 --> 23:49.055
I'm gonna escape out of here and I can think I can switch this over here and

23:50.776 --> 23:54.359
I can make myself small, and then I can push play.

23:54.699 --> 23:57.421
And we're just going to watch, and I'll pause it when I need to pause it.

23:58.122 --> 24:00.263
And hopefully this will work decently.

24:06.588 --> 24:10.772
From our studios in New York City, this is Charlie Rose.

24:16.491 --> 24:20.136
One of the great challenges of the 21st century is to improve global health.

24:20.516 --> 24:28.366
Life expectancy is 78 years in the United States, but the average newborn will not make it to 40 in some of the world's poorest countries.

24:28.786 --> 24:30.528
There are many reasons for this disparity.

24:30.889 --> 24:34.794
Infectious diseases kill millions of people throughout the third world each year.

24:35.234 --> 24:40.759
Malaria claims up to 3 million lives every year and infects up to 650 million people.

24:41.279 --> 24:47.004
HIV-AIDS also kills 3 million every year, and 90 percent of these cases are in developing countries.

24:47.524 --> 24:54.109
Neglected tropical diseases like hookworm and yellow fever also cause an enormous burden that only the poorest have to bear.

24:54.610 --> 24:59.794
Many of the leading killers have been contained in first world countries and are easily treatable.

25:00.274 --> 25:04.298
The problem of global health is not only a matter of disease and medicine.

25:04.759 --> 25:09.403
Issues of poverty, infrastructure, and the environment are all inseparable.

25:09.863 --> 25:13.107
Fortunately, more funding than ever... It's interesting, right?

25:13.247 --> 25:19.513
Already we don't hear the paramount nature of RNA and the inevitability of a pandemic.

25:20.546 --> 25:30.374
We hear that it is a complex problem that probably has to do with sanitation and infrastructure and all these things, that most of these diseases are treatable.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.796
And that's why the first world has conquered him.

25:32.836 --> 25:46.427
It seems like Charlie Rose actually maybe has even read that book by Humphreys, you know, and Roman, whatever his name is, with a B. The one that talks about, you know, the lost history of disease and vaccines.

25:48.427 --> 25:50.348
It's really extraordinary how he explains it.

25:50.608 --> 25:55.931
I think it's worth actually listening to that again because it surprised me more than I thought it would.

25:55.951 --> 25:56.671
It's only a minute.

26:02.614 --> 26:10.338
From our studios in New York City, this is Charlie Rose.

26:16.132 --> 26:19.776
One of the great challenges of the 21st century is to improve global health.

26:20.157 --> 26:28.005
Life expectancy is 78 years in the United States, but the average newborn will not make it to 40 in some of the world's poorest countries.

26:28.426 --> 26:30.168
There are many reasons for this disparity.

26:30.528 --> 26:34.433
Infectious diseases kill millions of people throughout the third world each year.

26:34.873 --> 26:40.394
Malaria claims up to 3 million lives every year and infects up to 650 million people.

26:40.914 --> 26:46.635
HIV-AIDS also kills 3 million every year, and 90 percent of these cases are in developing countries.

26:47.155 --> 26:53.737
Neglected tropical diseases like hookworm and yellow fever also cause an enormous burden that only the poorest have to bear.

26:54.237 --> 26:59.418
Many of the leading killers have been contained in first world countries and are easily treatable.

26:59.918 --> 27:03.919
The problem of global health is not only a matter of disease and medicine.

27:04.399 --> 27:09.041
Issues of poverty, infrastructure, and the environment are all inseparable.

27:09.501 --> 27:12.742
Fortunately, more funding than ever is being devoted to this fight.

27:13.262 --> 27:14.622
Some progress has been made.

27:15.043 --> 27:20.764
Vaccines and other technologies are being developed that could one day eliminate the worst diseases.

27:21.284 --> 27:29.287
Also, mortality of children under five has dipped below 10 million a year for the first time since the statistic has been recorded.

27:29.827 --> 27:33.493
But for now, large-scale improvement remains theoretical.

27:33.974 --> 27:36.918
Joining me now are four experts in the field of global health.

27:37.559 --> 27:40.844
Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

27:41.225 --> 27:44.570
Until 2006, he was director of the United Nations Millennium Project.

27:44.850 --> 27:49.752
Tanya Villafana is the Director of the Portfolio Management System at the Malaria Vaccine Initiative.

27:50.132 --> 27:54.574
Her organization recently announced a successful trial vaccine for malaria.

27:54.994 --> 27:56.834
Ann Veneman is the Executive Director of UNICEF.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.096
Peter Hotez is the President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute.

28:00.456 --> 28:03.417
He is an expert on neglected tropical diseases.

28:03.917 --> 28:06.157
And once again, my co-host is Sir Paul Nurse.

28:06.538 --> 28:11.939
He is a 2001 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and the President of Rockefeller University.

28:12.439 --> 28:14.919
I am pleased to have all of them here for this conversation.

28:15.259 --> 28:16.740
Let me just start with this issue.

28:16.760 --> 28:21.801
I mean, what is the state today of global health and how do we measure it?

28:22.321 --> 28:32.123
You know, Charlie, this is a very interesting problem because it's so... This is the guy that I want you to pay attention to more than anybody else because I believe this is the guy that's the player.

28:33.368 --> 28:40.115
Now, if you're not into this kind of thinking, then maybe this isn't the stream for you.

28:40.836 --> 28:52.268
But what I want you to watch, and what I think I can see with my own eyes, is that he is approving and disapproving and helping with the coordinated lying that's about to happen at this table.

28:53.228 --> 29:02.517
Now, Charlie Rose has just given a very interesting introduction that had a lot to do with global health equals life expectancy.

29:04.379 --> 29:09.524
Infectious disease in the third world is malaria, HIV, yellow fever, he said hookworm.

29:10.325 --> 29:15.410
Poverty, infrastructure and the environment are what really the problem are because most of these are readily treatable.

29:18.646 --> 29:20.630
And so vaccines are not paramount yet.

29:20.690 --> 29:21.372
You can hear it.

29:21.552 --> 29:29.550
He says that in a list of things as things that are being developed along with nets and infrastructure and water, you know, the whole thing.

29:32.020 --> 29:37.167
At this time, DDT is still being used to control malaria in lots of parts of the world.

29:37.247 --> 29:48.841
So Jeffrey Sachs, UN, and Columbia, there's a lady from UNICEF, there's a lady there who's developing, and I'm not insulting these ladies, I just didn't hear their names, and I don't pay much attention to either of them because they're clearly

29:49.542 --> 29:52.644
They're clearly parts of this, you know, puppets that don't really get it.

29:53.785 --> 29:59.990
And the Sabin Vaccine Institute, another puppet that doesn't get it is Peter Hotez, or he gets it and he doesn't care.

30:00.510 --> 30:02.852
But why is Paul Nurse there?

30:04.413 --> 30:05.694
Who the hell is Paul Nurse?

30:06.074 --> 30:12.899
Well, I would say that we should know who Paul Nurse is, right?

30:12.919 --> 30:15.461
We definitely should know who he is.

30:15.601 --> 30:17.322
So let me pull this up over here.

30:19.568 --> 30:19.808
this.

30:20.689 --> 30:26.293
So if you go to Wikipedia and find out who Paul Nurse is, he's got a lot of honorary degrees.

30:26.333 --> 30:31.017
He's president of the Royal Society, and he's a director of the Francis Crick Institute.

30:32.938 --> 30:45.088
And he got a Nobel Prize for identifying the gene CDC2 cell division cycle protein 2 in fission yeast.

30:46.934 --> 30:49.937
Now, why is this important for me?

30:50.017 --> 30:51.959
Why is this important for this introduction?

30:51.999 --> 30:56.844
Why is it important for him to be sitting at that stupid table is the question you ought to ask.

30:57.906 --> 31:08.437
And the reason why he's sitting at that stupid table is because he is part of the narrative curation that is occurring there that maybe even Peter Hotez doesn't understand yet.

31:09.517 --> 31:18.604
Peter Hotez could easily be a very naive molecular biologist who is a glorified pastry chef.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.046
He can follow recipes and report what he gets.

31:23.148 --> 31:30.273
And that's the extent to his creativity and the extent to his insight, because he's trapped in the assumptions that these people give him.

31:31.654 --> 31:33.836
And one of the largest, most

31:35.799 --> 31:49.635
crippling assumptions that we make in general biology is that something that we find in yeast can be readily generalized across all cellular organisms.

31:51.448 --> 32:05.819
Now, another very prominent example of this is the prion protein and the prion phenomenon, because in yeast, there are apparently all these examples of proteins that fold differently, and then the folding pattern can be inherited independent of the gene.

32:08.001 --> 32:20.170
And these are supposed to be homologous molecular examples of what likely underlies these diseases in humans, even though the correlation and connection mechanistically has never been made.

32:21.840 --> 32:39.992
And so you can study prions in yeast that have absolutely nothing to do with the molecular mechanisms that play in your brain or in the brain of those people with some kind of disease that supposedly do or body due to amyloid or due to prions, specifically prions.

32:40.612 --> 32:41.953
Because remember prions

32:48.326 --> 33:02.436
Prions are also the subject of a book, a great, big, giant, thick book written by Stanley Prusiner, who is the mentor, the student of Hilary Koprowski, who's been to the Vatican multiple times.

33:04.037 --> 33:13.484
And this is also a biological story with way too many details to justify itself in yeast rather than us.

33:15.097 --> 33:20.039
But it's a story supposedly about us and the dangers of prions in the future.

33:23.380 --> 33:28.762
Just like the virology books over there have multiple volumes and need to be expanded every year.

33:28.843 --> 33:34.805
But the neurobiology book, the plant physiology book, the genetics book, the chemistry books, they don't ever get bigger.

33:38.006 --> 33:42.588
Because they're not being filled with manufactured knowledge.

33:42.628 --> 33:44.649
They're not being filled with mythology.

33:45.657 --> 33:49.519
They're being filled with verifiable models that have been verified.

33:51.200 --> 34:03.607
And so you don't need to keep adding colors to your cartoons or keep adjusting your cartoons because just yesterday you found out that bile acids are important in some phenomenon that you think you're an expert in.

34:05.448 --> 34:11.512
Like we talked about in yesterday's course, yesterday's lecture, or yesterday's discussion, coaching session.

34:13.376 --> 34:36.452
And so in this coaching session, I want you to see that it's very strange that this guy, Paul Nurse, would be a co-host on Charlie Rose's show with Peter Hotez, a lady from, a malaria vaccine maker, a lady from UNICEF, and Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University, the UN, and the Vatican.

34:38.613 --> 34:41.215
Now remember, Rockefeller University, that sounds great.

34:41.315 --> 34:42.456
Sounds innocuous, right?

34:46.246 --> 34:49.829
And again, he's got this whole list of things that he did in yeast.

34:50.629 --> 35:03.019
And we're supposed to believe that everything that regulatory genes and stuff that he finds in yeast are somehow giving us fundamental insight into the regulation of the cell cycle in ourselves.

35:06.302 --> 35:14.268
And what I need you or I would beg you to see is that in my biology 101 class, I am trying to emphasize that.

35:17.085 --> 35:35.775
I'm trying to emphasize that by teaching us from the bottom up of genes and proteins and then RNA and then ribosomes and, sorry, genes and then RNA and then ribosomes and then proteins and then cells and then tissues and then organs, and then teaching us stories like Paul Nurse's,

35:37.496 --> 36:00.235
Nobel Prize winning story about finding a gene in yeast that you can also find in us and saying it has exact homology and it lends understanding to us even though there is no doubt that yeast as a cell, yeast as a pattern integrity is nowhere near as complex

36:01.036 --> 36:12.599
as a human being that goes through between 18 and 22 years of development before adulthood and then goes through the raising of offspring which have an equivalent development time period.

36:14.740 --> 36:22.182
There's no possible way to compare whatever you might find that is homologous in something like yeast with something like us.

36:23.257 --> 36:39.705
And that's the reason why I've often brought up these old books and brought up these old books in the foundational lecture, is that when you go back to the very, very old books about animal and plant science, you don't find the tendency, the drive to generalize across things that you find.

36:40.126 --> 36:43.828
You just find an appreciation for the diversity of the things that they found.

36:47.270 --> 37:01.363
Biology 101 has been teaching us for decades now, and the people at the Human Genome Project have been teaching us for decades now, to think of ourselves as homologous to yeast.

37:01.843 --> 37:09.771
And everything we learn from yeast has a homologous part in us, and so that all the really important shit is down here.

37:11.215 --> 37:38.695
at the cellular level and the protein level, focusing on homologies that have no bearing on us understanding the pattern integrity that is us, but rather very specifically force us to focus on those components that are in our pattern integrity that have homology in much more simple pattern integrity so that we can perform a reductionist

37:39.957 --> 37:45.979
philosophical investigation and create the illusion of knowledge.

37:47.240 --> 38:01.185
An investigation in mouse, an investigation in yeast, this guy is famous for having a Nobel Prize for identifying a yeast gene which has a homologue in humans.

38:01.926 --> 38:07.408
And he did a screen of cDNA constructs in order to find that gene and then that was it.

38:09.226 --> 38:09.887
Here's your medal.

38:11.628 --> 38:13.910
And forever after that, he is what?

38:14.411 --> 38:29.165
He is on things like Charlie Rose to try and tell people that when you find stuff in smaller and smaller and simpler pattern integrities that you can generalize all the way up to the most amazing pattern integrities on earth.

38:31.367 --> 38:32.168
Stop lying!

38:33.936 --> 38:35.679
That's why he's co-host right now.

38:36.260 --> 38:47.457
And you will notice throughout this program that there are going to be people looking across the table at him to see if he agrees with what they're saying as they test out their contributions to this narrative.

38:50.023 --> 38:50.883
multifaceted.

38:51.604 --> 38:53.024
It's, of course, a medical problem.

38:53.244 --> 38:58.506
We have these major diseases you just listed, malaria, TB, AIDS, for example.

38:59.146 --> 39:05.368
We have some idea of how we may treat them, but we know that there's new ways we can develop.

39:05.588 --> 39:08.669
So part of this is a scientific problem, part of it's a medical problem.

39:09.289 --> 39:15.553
But part of it is also a straightforward health economic problem and how we apply that in the developing world.

39:15.954 --> 39:21.678
Because it is different, quite different circumstances to how it is in the United States.

39:21.998 --> 39:24.340
Does he sound like a yeast biologist to you?

39:27.322 --> 39:34.607
Or does he sound like somebody with a fancy accent that can say things to Americans that they'll believe because the accent is so enticing?

39:37.728 --> 39:40.054
He's a yeast biologist.

39:40.074 --> 39:42.942
He's a guy who, according to...

39:46.892 --> 39:49.574
this nature article called We Beasties.

39:49.894 --> 39:50.514
I'll just read it.

39:51.075 --> 39:52.136
It's by Paul Nurse.

39:52.796 --> 39:54.097
It's actually in nature.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.039
And it's about this discovery that he made.

39:57.619 --> 40:07.666
And there he is with his hippie friends, Pierre Thoreau, in a relaxed setting, ha ha ha, in 1974.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.128
A major turning point in my scientific life involved

40:11.448 --> 40:20.653
not only a group of individuals important as they were for what happened, but also a microorganism, or to be more precise, a mutant microorganism.

40:22.537 --> 40:25.540
The time was 1974 and the place was, can you see that cursor?

40:25.600 --> 40:26.381
I think you can, right?

40:26.861 --> 40:33.007
The Murdoch Mitchelson's Laboratory in the Zoology Department of University of Edinburgh.

40:33.047 --> 40:41.776
Mitchelson had been interested in cell division cycles since 1950s, working mainly with the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces plumba.

40:43.397 --> 40:46.138
If I said that correctly, that was completely lucky.

40:46.859 --> 40:57.563
He recognized that the length of this rod-shaped single-celled organism was a good marker for how far the cell cycle had progressed, which made fission yeast a convenient model for cell cycle studies.

40:57.603 --> 41:03.966
It was this microorganism which transformed my scientific life, no pun intended.

41:06.724 --> 41:11.648
The previous year, because transformed, right, is using DNA to express a protein where it isn't supposed to be.

41:12.108 --> 41:16.991
The previous year, I had been a graduate student at Norwich studying amino acid pools and fungi.

41:17.031 --> 41:23.776
This project required me to nurture a rather temperamental Beckman amino acid analyzer.

41:23.816 --> 41:27.339
So here he is admitting that he uses a machine that's very temperamental.

41:27.779 --> 41:35.724
that probably needs a little Fonzie slap every once in a while to get it to keep running, and yet he thinks that he's making really high fidelity measurements.

41:35.764 --> 41:40.227
And I often found myself keeping this machine company throughout the night just to make sure it kept running.

41:40.747 --> 41:47.431
During these long night visuals, I read numerous research papers and kept me awake, and two from Lee Hartwell attracted my attention.

41:47.491 --> 41:52.034
These described the isolation of temperature-sensitive cell division cycle mutants in budding yeast,

41:52.594 --> 41:55.976
which failed to progress through the cell cycle when grown at high temperature.

41:56.416 --> 42:05.161
Immediately, I decided that I wanted to do something similar, and being familiar with Mitchelson's work, thought that fission yeast would be a good organism for this project.

42:05.741 --> 42:14.586
I contacted Mitchelson, who was enthusiastic about me coming to Edinburgh, but wisely suggested that I should first learn and become familiar with genetic techniques.

42:15.166 --> 42:21.648
So I went to Ursus Leppold in Bern, where he and his colleagues, Peter Muntz, taught me fission yeast genetics.

42:21.708 --> 42:25.709
I guess because that's something you can just buy a manual for.

42:25.729 --> 42:27.429
No, I'm just kidding.

42:27.489 --> 42:28.229
He says it right here.

42:28.629 --> 42:39.972
I finally arrived in Edinburgh at the start of 1974 with my newly acquired but rather limited genetic knowledge and started isolating CDC mutants, which are cell division, cell cycle division

42:42.310 --> 42:45.333
cell division cycle mutants in fission yeast.

42:45.834 --> 42:48.917
However, I'm going to get a little smaller here.

42:49.458 --> 42:53.482
However, the isolation procedure was very laborious and the progress was very slow.

42:53.542 --> 43:02.552
First, temperature sensitive mutants, those unable to form colonies at high temperatures, had to be identified by replica plating yeast colonies from high to low temperature.

43:03.172 --> 43:14.217
Next, these mutants were screened visually using a microscope to find colonies that contained elongated cells, which indicated that they could not complete their cell cycle and divide, although they had continued to grow.

43:14.257 --> 43:15.957
So you see the deal here?

43:15.977 --> 43:24.301
You have these rod-shaped bacterias and they start out small after cell division and then they elongate along their longitudinal axis until they reach a certain point

43:24.921 --> 43:29.786
which apparently somehow or another inside there is a trigger which causes them to divide.

43:29.846 --> 43:40.177
And so the mutants were often stopped in an elongated position because before they could initiate the cell cycle, some enzyme which was crucial to

43:42.159 --> 43:47.822
initiate the cell cycle or initiate cell division was became heat sensitive in that mutant.

43:48.363 --> 44:09.755
And so by screening for heat sensitive mutants, they're looking for the enzymes which become heat sensitive and the enzymes that are heat sensitive, and when they are heat sensitive in this in this time scale, and this time course of of elongation to cell division could give them some clue as to where in that cycle the enzyme plays a role.

44:09.795 --> 44:10.916
It's a very clever way

44:11.696 --> 44:14.379
to look at yeast and them as a pattern integrity.

44:15.620 --> 44:19.604
I devised an enrichment procedure to try and speed things up.

44:19.704 --> 44:35.619
I centrifuged cell populations through a density gradient to separate large, elongated cells from normal-sized cells, and the larger cells, some of which would be cell-division cycle mutants, should make it to the bottom of the gradient, and these fractions were plated out.

44:37.056 --> 44:43.804
And so he's spinning out cells based on their size, at least that's what he's assuming.

44:44.445 --> 44:47.628
After isolating a few mutants this way, something strange happened.

44:47.648 --> 44:52.394
There was a clump of cells in the middle of the microscope's meal that seemed to be smaller than normal.

44:54.161 --> 45:04.848
Now remember, his assumption was that when he spun these cells down that the big ones would go to the bottom and the big ones were the ones that were elongated and trapped in some part of the cell cycle, unable to divide.

45:05.429 --> 45:07.070
My first response was disbelief.

45:07.110 --> 45:10.192
How could such small cells have gotten to the bottom of the gradient?

45:11.394 --> 45:14.937
This thought was slowly replaced by another one.

45:14.977 --> 45:17.078
What was the significance of these tiny cells?

45:17.118 --> 45:20.281
Well, I can come up with a couple of reasons why they might have gotten to the bottom of the gradient.

45:20.441 --> 45:22.222
One might have been their density.

45:22.742 --> 45:26.125
The other one might be that the gradient doesn't separate things like he thinks it does.

45:27.093 --> 45:30.034
The gradient might separate them by size and weight.

45:30.274 --> 45:36.977
And so if the size has something to do with it, then smaller particles might also move easier than larger particles.

45:37.057 --> 45:39.298
And so in reality, he may have just gotten lucky.

45:39.878 --> 45:42.700
Fission yeast cells usually divide at a constant cell length.

45:42.720 --> 45:55.445
So if these cells were shorter than normal, this must mean, here we are using logic again, like William Briggs would probably cringe at, that they divided at a smaller size.

45:56.499 --> 46:04.563
This was the only possible if cells had progressed more rapidly through their cell cycle, dividing prematurely before they had grown to normal size.

46:04.603 --> 46:20.610
I called over my friend and colleague, this dude, which I think is author on the left, Pierre on the right, who was visiting from Bern, and he was aware of my limited genetic skills and gently suggested that my plates were contaminated with another organism.

46:21.570 --> 46:27.892
It was another day before we and Mitchison were convinced that it was definitely fission yeast, albeit a small one.

46:27.912 --> 46:35.674
During our conversations, we recalled a seminar from a colleague in the Department of Genetics, Henry Kaeser, on the control of metabolic flux.

46:35.735 --> 46:42.737
Kaeser had argued that although control was distributed through all steps of the metabolic pathway, some steps could be more rate limiting than others.

46:42.797 --> 46:46.118
Was it possible that this small-sized mutant, soon to be called wheat,

46:47.438 --> 46:55.140
to reflect its Scottish origin, had a defective gene for a major rate-limiting step in the pathways-controlling cell cycle progression.

46:55.760 --> 47:09.163
This simple interpretation turned out to be correct when it was eventually demonstrated that WE1 regulates the cyclin-dependent kinase that acts as the major engine of fission yeast cell cycles."

47:09.183 --> 47:15.205
So this whole sentence is crazy because the one experiment they did did not demonstrate that

47:15.825 --> 47:20.907
that the cyclin-dependent kinase is the major engine of the fission yeast cell cycle.

47:20.927 --> 47:22.467
There's no paper that shows that.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.608
There's a paper that shows it's crucial for it.

47:27.449 --> 47:40.673
So all of these things are semantic enchantments that are done individually very naively and also very innocently because he wants to sell you the significance of his serendipity here.

47:41.892 --> 47:48.895
He's absolutely positively discarding the irreducible complexity in which this should be couched.

47:49.695 --> 47:52.476
So what lessons did I learn from this turning point in my career?

47:53.757 --> 47:54.477
Not very many.

47:54.557 --> 48:00.419
The first was the importance of biology, letting the organism you are studying guide you in the right direction to solve your problem.

48:01.140 --> 48:06.702
By using microscopic visual inspection, I was not being too restricted in my search for mutants.

48:08.772 --> 48:18.337
Imagine the context of this experiment in the context of experiments now where we're looking at single cell RNA complements and proteomes and all this.

48:18.357 --> 48:22.840
This is such a simple data set and still amazing.

48:25.635 --> 48:27.716
If something unexpected turned up, I could see it.

48:28.016 --> 48:35.418
This allowed mutants that no one had imagined existing before to be observed and thought about, opening new avenues of inquiry.

48:36.058 --> 48:43.980
Serendipity was given a chance to play a role, allowing nature to constrain and guide the infinite possibilities that occur to the human mind.

48:44.100 --> 48:50.662
A second lesson was the importance of spending time trying to understand the real biological significance of observations made on cells and organisms,

48:51.920 --> 48:55.962
before undertaking detailed investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved.

48:56.162 --> 49:02.646
I believe that this is a statement which is exactly the opposite of what they used his work to do over the last 25 years.

49:03.506 --> 49:17.714
They instead used his work to edify this idea that understanding very simple pattern integrities and the genes that they seem to have some use for has given us fundamental insight into the mechanisms that are at play in our own pattern integrity.

49:17.754 --> 49:19.075
And this is fundamentally wrong.

49:20.899 --> 49:24.901
And so that's why I think he needs to close with a statement as so contradictory as this one.

49:25.401 --> 49:31.164
Understanding the biology properly is as important as the subsequent mechanistic insight.

49:32.204 --> 49:36.626
Even describing it as a mechanistic insight is already arrogant as crazy.

49:36.706 --> 49:41.268
I mean, one final thought, why were the wee mutant cells at the bottom of the gradient?

49:41.988 --> 49:42.629
I don't know.

49:43.129 --> 49:48.091
Perhaps it was because they clump easily, or maybe I was just very lucky.

49:50.785 --> 49:53.968
Sounds like the crazy stories that a lot of these people have, right?

49:54.008 --> 49:57.652
You know, just happened to bring the AIDS virus home in my jeans.

49:58.773 --> 49:59.253
I don't know.

50:00.234 --> 50:02.876
Just happened to be working in a lab and have this idea.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.678
You know, I was doing an embryology class.

50:04.738 --> 50:08.562
I just thought I'd squirt some of this stuff into these embryos and lo and behold, it worked.

50:12.265 --> 50:12.706
I don't know.

50:14.147 --> 50:15.570
Seems pretty serendipitous.

50:15.970 --> 50:20.498
Anyway, let's go back to the video because I do think the video is important and I do think it's going to be a lot of fun to watch.

50:23.934 --> 50:30.298
We always fully understand the sort of drivers that we have to appreciate if we're going to sort out this problem.

50:30.659 --> 50:41.986
And then there's a third issue, which is all to do with even if we actually solved the scientific, the medical problems, if we worked out the economics, how do we actually deliver that on the ground?

50:42.026 --> 50:45.328
I mean, with the infrastructures often in very weakened conditions.

50:45.368 --> 50:47.789
So I think we have to think about this in

50:49.250 --> 50:57.133
with a range of issues, not simply a scientific one, not simply an economic one, not simply a developing one on the ground.

50:58.194 --> 51:00.234
I'd like to get a sense of that overall picture.

51:00.254 --> 51:04.076
I wonder if Geoffrey could kick us off with just putting it all in perspective for us.

51:04.596 --> 51:05.377
Well, thanks, Paul.

51:05.497 --> 51:09.558
I thought both summaries were perfect, that we're making a lot of progress.

51:10.138 --> 51:11.019
Stop lying!

51:11.559 --> 51:15.781
There is an amazing amount of disease and death

51:16.670 --> 51:22.711
that still occurs every year that just could be controlled massively if we put our attention to it.

51:24.008 --> 51:36.216
So the good news is, as you said, Charlie, that the number of children under the age of five who are dying every year of infection has dipped below 10 million.

51:36.856 --> 51:40.538
That's good news, because in 1990, it was about 13 million deaths.

51:40.618 --> 51:44.961
And it's come down, even though the numbers of children have gone up because of population growth.

51:45.541 --> 51:46.242
So that sounds good.

51:46.282 --> 51:50.765
But on the other hand, all of a sudden, you think 10 million children dying

51:51.545 --> 52:03.548
of things like malaria or measles or other infections, diarrheal disease or respiratory infection that can be controlled by an antibiotic or a vaccine.

52:03.968 --> 52:11.570
So you see there's no mention of norovirus or rotavirus because I think what he's talking about, diarrheal disease, was later blamed on viruses.

52:11.610 --> 52:15.731
We can go back and look and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but that's my feeling.

52:15.791 --> 52:18.132
He would be listing all the viruses if

52:18.812 --> 52:22.556
that plan was already in motion or in set like it is now.

52:23.256 --> 52:28.762
Or something as simple as a bed net or a dose of anti-malaria medicine.

52:28.862 --> 52:38.812
So the wonderful thing is we have these powerful technologies and we see in many parts of the world that these diseases have gotten completely under control.

52:39.372 --> 52:49.763
And at the same time, we have nearly 10 million deaths per year of young children from what should be completely controllable causes.

52:50.363 --> 52:54.007
And what Paul says is really the point.

52:54.448 --> 52:57.391
The deaths are occurring in places of extreme poverty.

52:57.991 --> 52:59.953
So we have to face the basic question.

53:01.044 --> 53:08.467
How do you have our powerful techniques, like vaccines or medicines or bed nets, reach the poorest of the poor?

53:09.068 --> 53:10.829
Because they can't afford them on their own.

53:11.309 --> 53:16.971
Their governments are also impoverished because they try to collect taxes from people who have no money.

53:17.592 --> 53:23.374
And so the question is, can the rich world and the poor world work together to solve this problem?

53:23.514 --> 53:25.535
Now, we've promised many times to do that.

53:25.555 --> 53:28.757
30 years ago, we said there would be health for all.

53:29.457 --> 53:29.937
by the year 2000.

53:30.137 --> 53:32.078
Well, we kind of missed that one.

53:32.978 --> 53:51.103
Then in the year 2000, we said that by the year 2015, the child mortality should be cut by two-thirds, and the maternal mortality, let's not forget the mothers dying in childbirth because there's no obstetrician around for an emergency.

53:51.883 --> 53:59.288
half a million mothers dying in the poorest countries, that that maternal mortality should be cut by three-fourths.

53:59.328 --> 54:00.869
Those are the Millennium Goals.

54:01.529 --> 54:04.371
So the question is, can we meet those goals?

54:04.552 --> 54:10.976
My answer would be yes, and Veneman... I wonder what the Millennium... whose Millennium Goals are those?

54:11.096 --> 54:18.821
If UNICEF can tell you, there are the ways to meet them, but the other question is, even if we can, will we?

54:18.881 --> 54:20.302
Will we get organized to do it?

54:20.662 --> 54:21.123
Can we?

54:21.343 --> 54:21.643
Will we?

54:23.124 --> 54:25.104
Well, I think that's the question we have to ask.

54:25.185 --> 54:32.968
Now, you can see that this is a much more rehearsed and scripted illusion of consensus.

54:33.028 --> 54:35.389
And Charlie Rose may actually be a victim here.

54:35.449 --> 54:41.212
He doesn't have to know that one or more of these people had a discussion about what they were going to say before they came on the show.

54:41.252 --> 54:42.973
Charlie Rose may even be happy with that.

54:43.673 --> 54:46.054
Charlie Rose may have even taken the questions from them.

54:47.062 --> 54:49.043
You see the progress that's being made.

54:49.863 --> 54:58.365
I continue to believe that with a collective sense of urgency, we can meet or nearly meet these goals.

54:58.625 --> 55:05.607
We've talked about the under five mortality rate, which is one of the biggest measures of child illnesses and so forth.

55:05.647 --> 55:10.068
But it's important to recognize that that rate has dropped 60% since 1960.

55:12.449 --> 55:14.312
So we know that progress can be made.

55:14.993 --> 55:19.540
We see measles mortality be reduced from 1999 to 2005.

55:19.961 --> 55:23.146
They set a goal, reduce measles mortality by 50 percent.

55:23.447 --> 55:24.348
That was exceeded.

55:25.299 --> 55:27.320
Globally, it was reduced 60 percent.

55:28.041 --> 55:31.683
In Africa, 75 percent reduction in that six-year period.

55:32.964 --> 55:42.090
Coverage of bed nets, it has increased from about 30 million nets to 63 million nets in just a matter of a couple of years.

55:42.950 --> 56:09.356
uh... we've seen increases in breastfeeding which we know is very important for for children's health and survival we've seen increases in clean water available which is also the diarrheal diseases from dirty water are very uh... impacting on children in the developing world but i think one of the things that's that's setting us backwards on some of these figures and and the figures that you you pointed out early on on the uh...

56:10.456 --> 56:27.089
life expectancy is in southern Africa with HIV and AIDS, and that's really having a serious impact in reducing life expectancy from the 60s into the mid-30s in some countries.

56:28.888 --> 56:32.990
What astonishes me is... Now, I think there's a parallel here, right?

56:33.050 --> 56:44.374
Remember, we're talking about life expectancy and Charlie Rose opened up with global health as equated to life expectancy and comparing across nations the life expectancy of their population.

56:44.394 --> 56:46.655
And so here again, she's playing that same game.

56:47.515 --> 56:50.796
saying that AIDS is reducing life expectancy in these countries.

56:50.876 --> 57:03.841
It's not very dissimilar to how the opioid crisis that has reduced life expectancy in America has been overlooked, has ignored as a primary source of this reduction in America.

57:03.861 --> 57:12.945
And instead, things like COVID, long COVID, cancer, you know, all these random things that they're blaming it on is just, you know, it's tough.

57:14.045 --> 57:20.589
when in reality it can be many, many hundreds of thousands of deaths can be blamed on one single thing.

57:20.629 --> 57:30.354
And that's the opioid crisis that is coming into our open border and not being treated in a way that as the crisis that it is.

57:31.581 --> 57:35.582
And you can hear it in the callousness of when people talk about it.

57:35.622 --> 57:47.807
Like when Meryl Nass talks about the opioid crisis, she's pretty upset with the idea that we're spending so much money on Narcan and that that company's making so much money saving these people as if that's the problem.

57:49.487 --> 57:57.250
Rather than all these young people having their lives cut short by exposure to something that should never have ever, ever been available.

57:57.270 --> 57:59.631
It should be treated as a war.

58:04.378 --> 58:33.062
how inexpensive so many of these measures are and yet this is probably the most cost effective way to lift people out of poverty nothing else jeff sacks has taught me that these conditions not only occur in the setting of poverty but they promote poverty these are the reasons why poor people stay poor for instance hookworm infection a disease of six hundred million people one in three of the world's poorest people who live on less than two dollars a day have hookworm

58:33.582 --> 58:35.224
So now you hear him say it.

58:35.544 --> 58:37.386
Jeffrey Sachs has taught me.

58:38.607 --> 58:41.089
And now he's going to say something and watch.

58:41.230 --> 58:42.791
Jeffrey Sachs, listen to it.

58:42.831 --> 58:43.832
There's no nodding.

58:44.413 --> 58:49.117
Jeffrey Sachs is not learning something from the infectious disease professor here.

58:49.217 --> 58:54.262
He is listening to the infectious disease professor say what he told him to say.

58:54.302 --> 58:55.523
That's what I see in his eyes.

58:55.584 --> 58:55.844
Watch.

58:57.501 --> 58:59.301
a developing one on the ground.

59:00.141 --> 59:00.402
Oh, wait.

59:00.422 --> 59:02.422
I'd like to get a sense of that overall picture.

59:02.442 --> 59:03.902
I wonder if Jeffrey could kick us off.

59:03.922 --> 59:05.342
Sorry, I didn't mean it to go back that far.

59:05.942 --> 59:18.425
...in First World countries, and... Yes, and Vanaman, head of UNICEF, can tell you there are the ways to meet them, but the other question is, even if we can, will we?

59:18.465 --> 59:19.905
Will we get organized to do it?

59:19.925 --> 59:21.305
Okay, I'm gonna go forward one more time.

59:21.545 --> 59:23.665
Pennies a person per year.

59:23.845 --> 59:24.046
Shoot.

59:24.066 --> 59:24.926
Incredibly astonishing.

59:24.946 --> 59:26.246
But is it a question of money?

59:26.986 --> 59:27.586
primarily.

59:27.946 --> 59:29.047
Jeffrey, you're taking a hint.

59:29.187 --> 59:30.347
As weird as it is.

59:30.407 --> 59:40.832
From 1999 to 2000, clean water available, which is also the diarrheal diseases from dirty water, are very impacting on children in the developing world.

59:41.452 --> 59:49.836
But I think one of the things that's setting us backwards on some of these figures, and the figures that you pointed out early on, on the

59:51.156 --> 59:55.497
life expectancy is in Southern Africa with HIV and AIDS.

59:55.597 --> 01:00:06.740
And that's really having a serious impact in reducing life expectancy from the 60s into the mid-30s.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.540
You can really feel them trying to hit talking points.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.621
And I really feel strongly that that's what's happening here.

01:00:12.661 --> 01:00:16.622
This is a scripted talking point hitting interview.

01:00:16.722 --> 01:00:17.482
In some countries.

01:00:19.284 --> 01:00:28.594
What astonishes me is how inexpensive so many of these measures are, and yet this is probably the most cost-effective way to lift people up.

01:00:28.694 --> 01:00:32.137
Why is he looking back to Jeffrey Sachs and to Paul Nurse?

01:00:32.178 --> 01:00:34.220
Why isn't he talking to the host of the show?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.200
out of poverty.

01:00:35.881 --> 01:00:43.564
If nothing else, Jeff Sachs has taught me that these conditions not only occur in the setting of poverty, but they promote poverty.

01:00:43.684 --> 01:00:46.625
These are the reasons why poor people stay poor.

01:00:46.965 --> 01:00:55.889
For instance, hookworm infection, a disease of 600 million people, one in three of the world's poorest people who live on less than $2 a day have hookworm.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:01:04.215
excellent economic analyses showing that chronic hookworm infection in childhood will reduce your future wage earning capacity by 40%.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:14.683
That is spectacular that he is correlating hookworm infection in kids to their adult income.

01:01:15.911 --> 01:01:18.232
It couldn't have anything to do with where they grew up.

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:24.815
It couldn't have to do with anything they ate or where they went to school or what country that was.

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:26.216
Nothing.

01:01:27.056 --> 01:01:32.779
It's hookworm infection and adult income.

01:01:33.639 --> 01:01:35.060
That sounds like a U.N.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:35.820
kind of thing.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.481
That sounds like a who kind of thing.

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:40.362
That sounds like a Jeffrey Sachs told me to say kind of thing.

01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:43.363
Lymphatic filariasis, a disease of 120 million people.

01:01:45.543 --> 01:01:49.326
causes $1.5 billion in economic losses for India alone.

01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:59.533
Here we go again, talking about economic losses that this person at the Sabin Vaccine Institute can't possibly have calculated himself.

01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:02.916
We can't possibly have the data to do this.

01:02:03.456 --> 01:02:11.381
We can't even generalize data across different hospital systems because we can't agree how to keep records about cancer or any of these other things.

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:17.385
How in the hell can we have national statistics about it or statistics that we can compare across countries?

01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:24.770
And yet these people who talk about public health regularly discuss as though there's one central database

01:02:25.923 --> 01:02:32.646
one central depository of up-to-date statistics that they have a password to.

01:02:33.426 --> 01:02:54.736
And so whenever they want to, they can just throw out numbers that a yeast molecular biologist or a tropical disease expert have no business knowing, unless their buddies over here that work for the UN and for the Vatican and for the World Bank are giving them talking points, that Thai economics

01:02:55.868 --> 01:03:02.310
to infectious disease, to justify the rich countries spending money in the poor countries on it.

01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:06.612
You know, Haiti is not about Haiti, right?

01:03:07.272 --> 01:03:22.057
You know that the Haiti thing in Ohio is actually just for us to run around in a limited spectrum of debate, not realizing that America has a force there and that they want it to become a UN peacekeeping force in Haiti so that they can permanently run that place.

01:03:23.377 --> 01:03:24.638
You know, the Clintons were in Haiti.

01:03:27.967 --> 01:03:30.348
and we don't even know how much it is for Sub-Saharan Africa.

01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:35.772
These are easily preventable, easily treatable for pennies a person per year.

01:03:36.052 --> 01:03:37.013
Incredibly astonishing.

01:03:37.053 --> 01:03:39.714
But is it a question of money, primarily?

01:03:40.055 --> 01:03:41.175
Jeffrey, you're shaking your head.

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:50.641
As weird as it is, take a case, and you know that I'm nearly obsessed with this issue, malaria bed nets.

01:03:50.741 --> 01:03:55.644
Every few months, you let me rant and rave about getting malaria bed nets out to the world.

01:03:57.485 --> 01:04:02.790
Five bucks for a bed net which lasts five years, but poor people can't afford them.

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:14.959
And when you charge even a dollar for them, you basically prevent the poorest half of the rural population in Africa from having a chance, because they have no money.

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.681
So it's hard for us to imagine that a little bit

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:21.344
actually prevents saving lives.

01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:36.573
But it's amazing, last fall in Kenya, just as an example, because we now have some great results from this, they gave out two million bed nets for free in some of the poorest districts with the heaviest malaria burden.

01:04:37.333 --> 01:05:05.028
and now in published in a british uh... medical journal lancet just a few weeks ago they showed in those districts that the deaths went down forty four percent from children under five by this very simple two-day intervention of just handing out bed nets to people that need them money is critical as weird as it is even when it's just pennies for the medicine that's too much for people who have nothing but for us it's

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:10.649
it would hardly be noticed, and a point that I find shocking.

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:14.891
If you're not hearing it right now, please understand that this is the time.

01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:17.512
This is the time point where this pivot occurred.

01:05:18.152 --> 01:05:30.836
Maybe not exactly this Charlie Rose show, but this is when the biosecurity, bioweapons, biomilitary apparatus had just come off of 9-11.

01:05:32.236 --> 01:05:34.697
The economic crisis is one year away.

01:05:37.015 --> 01:05:42.861
And the emphasis is still not exclusively on vaccines.

01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:43.522
You can hear it.

01:05:44.603 --> 01:05:45.644
And this will change.

01:05:46.966 --> 01:05:48.587
But CEPI doesn't even exist yet.

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:55.955
The global partnership for, you know, whatever it is, that doesn't exist yet.

01:05:58.772 --> 01:06:01.133
So it's a cool video.

01:06:01.153 --> 01:06:06.937
There are 300 million sleeping sites in Africa where you need to put a bed net over.

01:06:07.277 --> 01:06:09.118
And these nets cost $5 each.

01:06:09.518 --> 01:06:13.340
So it's $1.5 billion needed for that.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.661
Can't be afforded locally.

01:06:15.021 --> 01:06:19.344
But that's less than we spend for one day on the Pentagon.

01:06:19.964 --> 01:06:22.846
So one day's Pentagon spending would cover

01:06:23.686 --> 01:06:30.369
So again, here he's almost making the same bullshit analogy that these people are still doing now when they say the DoD did it.

01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:41.173
The DoD is a multi-layered bureaucracy that basically describes it as the Major League Baseball of America did it.

01:06:42.734 --> 01:06:43.894
Or the NBA did it.

01:06:46.155 --> 01:06:48.856
When you know it's not the NBA, you know it was one team.

01:06:49.477 --> 01:06:52.438
Or even worse, you know it is a few players on each team.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.817
that is responsible for it.

01:06:55.497 --> 01:06:58.439
But you just keep saying over and over again, the NBA did it.

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:07.485
So what is he saying here to make sure that I make my point well enough here to make sure you get it?

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:08.886
I'm going to replay it again.

01:07:10.107 --> 01:07:10.927
Replay it again.

01:07:11.047 --> 01:07:11.227
Each.

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:15.450
So it's $1.5 billion needed for that.

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.771
Can't be afforded locally.

01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:21.394
But that's less than we spend for one day on the Pentagon.

01:07:22.191 --> 01:07:29.896
So that would be like arguing about, you know, NBA players are overplayed and the budget of the NBA is this.

01:07:30.196 --> 01:07:33.178
And so that's more than we spend on one day in the NBA.

01:07:33.779 --> 01:07:40.083
Does that really clear up the disparity between the highest paid players in the NBA and the lowest played?

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:45.647
Does it clear up any, any, any, does it provide you any useful information?

01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:49.449
Does this provide you any useful information that it's one 365th

01:07:52.471 --> 01:07:54.233
of our total defense budget.

01:07:57.496 --> 01:08:08.004
He wants to spend one three hundred and sixty-fifth of our defense budget on third world interventions for public health is essentially what he's saying.

01:08:09.005 --> 01:08:14.470
But he says it in such a malevolent way that it almost sounds reasonable to the lazy listener.

01:08:19.242 --> 01:08:25.646
One day's Pentagon spending would cover every African sleeping site for five years.

01:08:26.127 --> 01:08:30.389
That's the kind of great opportunity we have, which would save millions of lives.

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:35.253
Remember that Elon Musk told us that for $6 billion, he could solve world hunger.

01:08:37.394 --> 01:08:39.796
That's also a fraction of our Pentagon budget.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.417
Stop lying!

01:08:42.312 --> 01:08:44.033
we choose to make that choice.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.113
This is your disease.

01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:46.954
Well, malaria, yes.

01:08:47.155 --> 01:08:48.375
I mean, I want to point out one thing.

01:08:48.415 --> 01:08:55.159
I do agree money is a big part of the problem, but I also think it's about creative partnerships and innovative thinking.

01:08:55.879 --> 01:08:59.981
We have an arsenal of new interventions that can also join in helping to make this happen.

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.882
Does it feel like an audition to you?

01:09:01.962 --> 01:09:04.083
Because it sure feels like an audition to me.

01:09:04.624 --> 01:09:05.024
Here you go.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:09.111
How well can you use the words and concepts in this book?

01:09:09.632 --> 01:09:12.493
And how well can you use the words and concepts in this book?

01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:21.497
The better that you use the words and concepts in this book, the more invitations you'll get to show up with people like Paul Nurse and Jeffrey Sachs.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:23.417
That's the simple game that I see here.

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:24.498
Stop lying!

01:09:28.442 --> 01:09:30.963
the kinds of changes everyone on the panel is talking about.

01:09:31.304 --> 01:09:38.507
While we're developing vaccines, we're seeing greater successes with new technologies than ever before.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:50.914
As you mentioned previously, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and an African clinical trial site in Mozambique has shown that we may have a vaccine

01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:53.015
that will move into phase three.

01:09:53.095 --> 01:09:55.678
Why does she keep looking back at Jeffrey Sachs?

01:09:55.738 --> 01:10:02.963
Is she being interviewed by Charlie Rose and his co-host, as he called him, Paul Nurse?

01:10:03.504 --> 01:10:11.150
Or is she auditioning for the UN and for the WHO and for the Vatican and for the weaponized piles of money that Jeffrey Sachs works for?

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:12.211
It's bizarre.

01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:19.283
And why is Peter Hotez sitting there like the little tiny dog in Warner Brothers cartoons?

01:10:19.323 --> 01:10:20.103
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:21.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:21.463 --> 01:10:21.984
Yeah, boss.

01:10:22.004 --> 01:10:22.484
Yeah, boss.

01:10:23.904 --> 01:10:28.566
The efficacy trials, which is the latest stage of clinical development testing as early as next year.

01:10:28.606 --> 01:10:30.346
This is the furthest we've ever been along.

01:10:31.047 --> 01:10:42.230
I think I agree with everyone that it's money, but I also think it's about thinking out of the box and being innovative in terms of how we use that money to get done what we need to get done.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.511
Why did he smile like that?

01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:46.292
Why does he smile like that?

01:10:46.332 --> 01:10:48.412
You gave us some pretty impressive statistics.

01:10:49.773 --> 01:10:53.434
What do you say we've learned from those improvements that would help us in the future?

01:10:53.454 --> 01:10:59.496
I mean, what lessons did you learn from those improved situations?

01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:06.386
Well, I think it, number one, shows that if you invest in health, you can get results.

01:11:06.947 --> 01:11:09.869
And I think that's really something we have to recognize.

01:11:09.989 --> 01:11:19.736
I also think as we talk about all of these different diseases and interventions, whether it's deworming or vitamin A or bed nets or measles vaccines or other vaccines,

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:25.001
We have to look at them as integrated packages that are given out at the community level.

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:25.802
What is she saying?

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:26.723
I thought I heard something else.

01:11:26.743 --> 01:11:37.914
As we talk about all of these different diseases and interventions, whether it's deworming or vitamin A or bed nets or measles vaccines or other vaccines, we have to look at them as vitamin A.

01:11:39.153 --> 01:11:50.563
integrated packages that are given out at the community level so that you don't just hand out bed nets, but you give them when the child is vaccinated or when the mother comes in for prenatal care.

01:11:51.403 --> 01:11:57.488
Oh, so now we're going to give we're going to give bed nets only to the people that show up at the clinic and take the shot.

01:11:57.549 --> 01:11:58.509
Did you hear her say it?

01:11:58.569 --> 01:11:59.230
She just said it.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:03.634
You give bed nets to the people who come to wellness visits and who get vaccinated.

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:06.416
This is terrible.

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:16.956
Because now the vaccine could be effective because those people took bed nets home and have nothing to do with the fact that they were vaccinated.

01:12:16.976 --> 01:12:17.757
I mean, it's gross.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:26.983
because we find that you can make more sustainable systems if, in fact, you build these community-based integrated approaches.

01:12:27.103 --> 01:12:35.266
One of the things we saw from the 80s to the 90s is that vaccine rates got up very high for basic childhood vaccines.

01:12:35.827 --> 01:12:40.549
And yet, that began to fall because it was all done in a campaign mode.

01:12:41.329 --> 01:12:51.635
Now we're recognizing as a global community that you really have to build basic sustainable community integrated systems for mothers and children.

01:12:51.675 --> 01:13:01.161
And keep in mind that it's very important to begin that care with the pregnant mother, because a healthy mother is more likely to deliver a healthy baby.

01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:04.083
And so that's the precursor to vaccinating the mom.

01:13:05.725 --> 01:13:14.473
They're not there yet in 2007, but what you can see is this titration of the end goal that has gone on for decades.

01:13:14.513 --> 01:13:30.269
That's what makes this video so nice because they really have slowly brought us to the ideals that are expressed in these books in the 50s and the 60s about how we need to think of ourselves as a phenomenon, our species as a phenomenon.

01:13:32.113 --> 01:13:40.258
that unlike any other species in nature may have the ability to take control of his future, take control of his biology.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:48.843
And these people all back in the 50s and 60s already knew that what that would mean is that vast majority of people wouldn't be in charge anymore.

01:13:49.723 --> 01:13:53.946
The vast majority of people would be experimental animals.

01:13:54.006 --> 01:14:00.490
And they're talking about, to a certain extent and to a certain degree, they're talking about Africa as a laboratory

01:14:01.397 --> 01:14:13.648
But of course, what the pandemic has done is allowed them, given them an excuse to invert the entire Western world into their laboratory, which I believe was probably their plan all along, probably for several decades now.

01:14:16.527 --> 01:14:31.216
I was just going to say, Paul, also, another way to summarize that is you need a tool like a vaccine, you need the financing so that it can reach the poor, and you need a delivery mechanism as part of a health system.

01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:34.978
And if you have those three things, absolutely amazing things can be done.

01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:37.520
And we keep finding, one after another,

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.905
OK, get the measles under control, boom, in five years, amazing results.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.388
Get bed nets out, two days, 2 million nets.

01:14:45.929 --> 01:14:49.873
And now we've had another 30 million nets in the last couple of years.

01:14:49.973 --> 01:14:53.858
And it could go up to 100 million a year to cover all of those sleeping sites.

01:14:54.859 --> 01:14:55.840
Get mass.

01:14:56.801 --> 01:15:00.982
chemotherapy, so-called, giving every child a pill to deworm.

01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:25.290
I mean, part of what I find better, but part of what I find very disturbing about what, like, the thundercunder put in the chat about them giving DTaP to pregnant moms for about 10 years by 2008, is that a lot of the OG objections to the vaccines, the really interesting ones at CHD, all agree that it was the MMR shot.

01:15:26.266 --> 01:15:27.387
It's very bizarre.

01:15:27.967 --> 01:15:31.931
Like, Polly agrees that it was the MMR shot.

01:15:32.071 --> 01:15:38.936
Actually, Mary Holland was on that Democracy Now!

01:15:38.996 --> 01:15:47.343
show before the pandemic talking about how her son had been injured by the MMR shot and that maybe certain people were vulnerable to certain components.

01:15:48.364 --> 01:15:49.945
It's not dissimilar to what

01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:52.806
what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:52.846 --> 01:16:00.049
has been arguing for a long time that might be thalidomide or mercury or aluminum, and it's always another, it's another thing.

01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:07.873
It never comes down to intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system might very well be dumb.

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:11.274
It always comes down to a component or a shot.

01:16:11.694 --> 01:16:20.278
And none of them ever seem to consider the idea that the earlier you do this intervention, the more likely it is to fundamentally interfere with the developmental progress of that kid.

01:16:22.133 --> 01:16:39.400
So giving vaccines after birth within an hour is as ridiculous as it can get, except for giving vaccines to a pregnant mom that 10 years earlier, we wouldn't allow her to eat sushi.

01:16:41.761 --> 01:16:47.664
She's not allowed to have unpasteurized cheese, shouldn't use cosmetics anymore, is where we were about 10 years ago.

01:16:49.173 --> 01:16:53.916
Now we have advanced all the way to the stage where we can vaccinate a mom to protect the baby.

01:16:55.597 --> 01:16:59.739
That we can vaccinate a baby to protect them from cancer 50 years later.

01:17:02.941 --> 01:17:15.189
And the doctors and the thinkers that we hear on social media and on television believe these myths because they are not sophisticated enough as biologists

01:17:17.148 --> 01:17:18.609
to understand that they are myths.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:24.373
And if they do understand, then they are like Jeffrey Sachs, that they are playing for the slavers.

01:17:25.394 --> 01:17:40.985
They are playing for the moneyed interests, the weaponized piles of money that want to enslave our grandkids by coercing us to teach this mythology to them, so that they will willingly surrender their data to this global security state.

01:17:41.994 --> 01:17:43.737
That's who Robert Malone works for.

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:46.581
That's who I believe Mary Holland works for.

01:17:46.801 --> 01:17:48.083
Meryl Nass works for.

01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:50.526
Pierre Cory, unfortunately, probably works for.

01:17:51.087 --> 01:17:52.749
Peter McCullough probably works for.

01:17:52.829 --> 01:17:54.532
Jeffrey Sachs probably works for.

01:17:55.586 --> 01:18:12.092
Jessica Hockett, Jessica Rose, all of these people, and definitely Kevin McKernan, the guy who worked for the Human Genome Project, the guy whose dad did microarray technologies, which was one of the stepping stones for where we are now with sequencing technology.

01:18:12.112 --> 01:18:21.876
And it all comes down to the fact that they want our data, our medical data, our genetic data, our proteomes, our RNA, our microbiomes.

01:18:23.257 --> 01:18:30.779
And that's why all these people in the dissident movement and all these people on television are following the same script.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:43.581
The public facing brochure of which the best one that I can come up with is the sparse pandemic document because it had a lot of these ideas in it, albeit in very tiny form.

01:18:45.481 --> 01:18:48.942
Jeffrey Sachs should not be this prominent.

01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:52.543
Jeffrey Sachs should not be this prominent.

01:18:53.339 --> 01:18:57.722
But he is, and he's this prominent consistently over decades.

01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:01.764
That should tell you all you need to know if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:03.725
says is one of his all-time heroes.

01:19:05.646 --> 01:19:13.751
It is a Trojan horse where I believe a lot of these people are trying to get into an administration where they'll have a lot more power than the vice president does.

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:18.774
Bobby Kennedy as vice president is not as powerful as Bobby Kennedy as the head of HHS.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:27.910
Bobby Kennedy as vice president is not as scary as Robert Malone as the head of the FDA.

01:19:28.932 --> 01:19:29.953
Not by a long shot.

01:19:31.495 --> 01:19:35.960
Be very aware of what is happening right now, ladies and gentlemen, because a game is being played with us.

01:19:40.896 --> 01:19:45.078
But you can get all the community routinely covered.

01:19:45.158 --> 01:19:50.201
So there's a lot of cleverness right now of actually how to deliver as well.

01:19:51.181 --> 01:19:55.464
UNICEF and the International Red Cross have done brilliantly on combining

01:19:56.204 --> 01:20:23.216
the measles vaccines with the bed net distribution and uh... peter's group has done brilliantly on showing how to get this package of uh... medicines out for the d warming and so lot of clever things little bit of financing by our standards because just to come back to you the two fifty you need to fifty million grounding air there are a billion people in the rich world so that's twenty five cents for each of us over a year

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:27.051
nodding heads is an illusion of consensus.

01:20:27.131 --> 01:20:29.391
Why is Paul Nurse smiling so much?

01:20:29.431 --> 01:20:31.872
He's a yeast molecular biologist.

01:20:33.073 --> 01:20:35.013
Why is he even sitting at this table?

01:20:35.473 --> 01:20:39.014
And you can deworm more than 500 million children.

01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:41.035
It's incredible.

01:20:41.315 --> 01:20:50.718
Someone once said to me, talking about a national problem, and I'm asking this in terms of an international global scope, that we need here a czar.

01:20:51.698 --> 01:20:59.324
Do we need a czar of global health so that there is a kind of clearinghouse, there is some centralization of focus?

01:20:59.404 --> 01:21:05.009
Well, one of the problems is it's very important to realize that these diseases... Is that health and human services, Secretary?

01:21:05.049 --> 01:21:06.470
Is that a czar already exists?

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:07.010
I don't know.

01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:09.192
Is there an ASPR at this time?

01:21:09.272 --> 01:21:09.613
I don't know.

01:21:09.673 --> 01:21:10.894
We should know that answer, though.

01:21:11.474 --> 01:21:11.794
he's so proud

01:21:28.553 --> 01:21:31.415
packages of interventions, not simply single measures.

01:21:31.715 --> 01:21:43.824
So for instance, it turns out that when you use the community drug distributors that give ivermectin for river blindness and parasitic diseases, if you use those same drug distributors, if they drag a bed net with them, the use of bed nets goes up ninefold.

01:21:44.364 --> 01:21:47.566
So right now, so many of our health interventions are siloed.

01:21:47.846 --> 01:21:52.969
The AIDS people don't talk to the malaria people, the malaria people don't talk to the wormy people.

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:58.251
We need to bring them all together in a unified mechanism, and it will change the world.

01:21:58.271 --> 01:22:00.152
Would a czar do that?

01:22:00.453 --> 01:22:02.934
Sorry, how would you think a czar could work to do that?

01:22:03.792 --> 01:22:05.033
Jeffrey, you were nodding your head.

01:22:05.073 --> 01:22:07.576
I'm not sure about that.

01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:14.343
One interesting thing about public health in history is often, actually, it's been a general in charge.

01:22:15.084 --> 01:22:23.513
And quite interesting, of course, was General Gorgas, who cleared the mosquitoes from the Panama Canal zone.

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:26.276
Wasn't Charles Rixey's

01:22:28.317 --> 01:22:34.968
A great-great-grandfather down at the Panama Canal with one of the Roosevelt's in an all-white suit.

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:38.554
Probably, I mean, it's interesting.

01:22:38.755 --> 01:22:39.295
It's interesting.

01:22:42.054 --> 01:22:44.595
when the world eradicated smallpox.

01:22:45.156 --> 01:22:47.277
That was also an operation.

01:22:47.657 --> 01:22:52.419
Every site, this had to really be a very rigorous approach.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:58.543
Wow, so he's insisting that smallpox was eliminated by a very rigorous approach.

01:22:58.583 --> 01:22:59.263
Stop lying!

01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:00.624
Stop lying!

01:23:01.084 --> 01:23:02.685
That is impressive.

01:23:02.805 --> 01:23:03.685
That is impressive.

01:23:03.805 --> 01:23:08.608
I've got medical dictionaries down here from the early 1900s which would argue with Jeffrey Sachs.

01:23:09.148 --> 01:23:10.349
Maybe those books are fake.

01:23:11.823 --> 01:23:16.084
Maybe that Foster's Encyclopedic Medical Dictionary is just fake.

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.905
I got some shit off of eBay, I guess.

01:23:20.566 --> 01:23:22.486
What an illusion, right, ladies and gentlemen?

01:23:22.506 --> 01:23:28.348
Now remember, this is in 2007, before anybody was really paying any attention.

01:23:29.406 --> 01:23:36.652
And so we just kind of accepted this as history, even because we were not provoked into re-investigating it.

01:23:36.692 --> 01:23:39.215
But at this time, those books were not out there.

01:23:39.855 --> 01:23:45.940
When UNICEF took on the immunizations, Bill Grant drove that in the 80s and 90s.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.422
So you're in favor of this idea?

01:23:47.562 --> 01:23:56.449
Well, I think that if we take our targets and we view them as goals, and their goals as partnership with poor people and poor countries,

01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:14.293
and we have leadership on this we'll get the job done and with all the good ideas around and all the things that UNICEF has proved yes we need strong leadership and a strong that face that Paul Nurse is making is crazy for a guy who should be bored out of his mind because

01:24:15.074 --> 01:24:19.639
He is a Nobel Prize winner in yeast molecular biology.

01:24:20.039 --> 01:24:20.520
Commitment.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.542
We will meet that goal.

01:24:22.842 --> 01:24:24.343
Kind of the moonshot analogy.

01:24:24.463 --> 01:24:25.024
And it really makes sense.

01:24:25.044 --> 01:24:25.464
The moonshot analogy.

01:24:25.485 --> 01:24:25.545
Wow.

01:24:35.933 --> 01:24:37.434
That's not an admission or anything.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:38.555
On what ground?

01:24:38.595 --> 01:24:42.357
Well, no, I mean, I guess I had a reservation on the calling it a czar, but I agree with Jeff.

01:24:42.397 --> 01:24:49.321
It's a shared vision, a shared strategy, working in partnership with our counterparts in the developing world.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.463
It's so... Boy, do they want it, too.

01:24:51.743 --> 01:24:54.985
Okay, but do you need some, for the lack of a better word, centrality of leadership?

01:24:56.417 --> 01:24:58.438
I think you need a shared vision by leadership.

01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:00.458
Why is he looking like that?

01:25:01.479 --> 01:25:03.059
I hear two things here.

01:25:03.179 --> 01:25:06.481
One is that you're doing fascinating scientific research in terms of vaccines.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.581
We all know about that and other areas.

01:25:08.902 --> 01:25:14.884
On the other hand, there's this basic dilemma of implementing, executing, delivering what we already have.

01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:20.946
Is this a great debate within the global health initiative community?

01:25:21.357 --> 01:25:22.158
Well, I think it is.

01:25:22.438 --> 01:25:23.959
I mean, we have experts here.

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:27.041
Why is Paul Nurse talking about it?

01:25:30.103 --> 01:25:31.704
You read that article with me.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:33.925
He's not super clever.

01:25:33.965 --> 01:25:42.991
He's a guy who looked through a microscope and used a gradient and used to use a very finicky machine that he had to stay up all night and make sure it kept running.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.153
That's his expertise.

01:25:46.178 --> 01:25:51.904
Back before anything was complicated, back before anything was complicated, back before anything was complicated.

01:25:54.026 --> 01:25:58.790
And he's got a lot of papers after that, I'm not saying he doesn't, but they're all in yeast.

01:26:01.253 --> 01:26:04.316
Why is he at this table talking about global governance?

01:26:05.376 --> 01:26:11.780
more than me, I get a sense that in the short term, we're talking about implementation.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.021
There are things we already know.

01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:14.701
We've heard about the nets.

01:26:14.741 --> 01:26:18.163
There are cheap treatments already available.

01:26:18.704 --> 01:26:31.731
Then there is the science, I mean, the stuff I'm particularly interested in, because we have particular challenges here of how we can develop treatments that can be delivered in these less than ideal circumstances.

01:26:32.152 --> 01:26:34.753
And I think that is research that we really

01:26:34.873 --> 01:26:42.996
Remember, he got a Nobel Prize for cell division cycle regulating gene mutants in fission yeast.

01:26:48.302 --> 01:27:12.245
really should be thinking about because often in the developed world we can imagine more sophisticated treatments, we can do that, we can ensure compliance and all the things that go with it but what we've got to sort out is ways of actually delivering treatments that are very simple and straightforward, a single dose a year or something like that and that I think does require good science and good vaccine science in particular.

01:27:13.146 --> 01:27:14.767
It's not an either-or argument.

01:27:14.947 --> 01:27:17.588
It's not science versus implementation.

01:27:17.648 --> 01:27:18.529
I'll give you an example.

01:27:19.009 --> 01:27:23.491
In India, in the 1950s, we had 75 million cases of malaria in India.

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:30.054
By 1961, we had reduced it three logs full to 75,000 cases.

01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:30.855
Why?

01:27:30.895 --> 01:27:32.856
Because of widespread use of chloroquine.

01:27:33.456 --> 01:27:36.398
and widespread use of DDT, the insecticide DDT.

01:27:36.799 --> 01:27:39.081
By 1962, the number of cases was 100,000.

01:27:39.541 --> 01:27:40.602
Then it was 200,000.

01:27:40.662 --> 01:27:42.163
Then it was 400,000.

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:49.749
So by 1960, the WHO was predicting the global eradication of malaria, in part because of their experience in India.

01:27:50.009 --> 01:27:50.390
But why?

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:53.152
Because of DDT resistance and chloroquine resistance.

01:27:53.492 --> 01:27:58.957
OK, so now I'm going to make an argument that a lot of people are probably going to go, oh, look at Cooey's crazy now.

01:27:59.537 --> 01:28:06.299
But have you ever considered the possibility that DDT and chloroquine were a problem back then already?

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:16.423
Have you considered the possibility that DDT might have actually had a couple downsides and also a couple upsides?

01:28:19.263 --> 01:28:26.746
And that in order to get that thing out of there that was helping control malaria and reintroduce the problem,

01:28:30.546 --> 01:28:33.708
you might need to have DDT become less effective.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:41.254
Now it's hard for me to understand how a chemical like that could be, you could become resistant to the chemical.

01:28:41.314 --> 01:28:42.315
It's not the same.

01:28:42.956 --> 01:28:44.677
It's not a biological mechanism.

01:28:45.037 --> 01:28:57.387
And I would challenge anybody that wants to challenge me to go do a literature research on this, to find a paper that describes the mechanism by which the malaria parasite became resistant to DDT.

01:28:58.871 --> 01:29:02.074
how the malaria mosquitoes became resistant to DDT.

01:29:02.134 --> 01:29:09.900
I want you to find a molecular mechanism paper about that because it would have been a wonderful paper to write.

01:29:11.681 --> 01:29:15.905
Why wouldn't you want to understand how insects became resistant to DDT?

01:29:18.234 --> 01:29:18.914
It's very right.

01:29:19.014 --> 01:29:26.357
Somebody in the chat also said it's not bed nets, but it is chemically impregnated bed nets.

01:29:26.397 --> 01:29:28.278
That's why they only last for five years.

01:29:29.359 --> 01:29:42.104
Whether or not those bed nets and exposure to them have any effects on those kids is not part of this, but it is nevertheless important to say that, that it's not just bed nets, but it's bed nets with chemicals on them.

01:29:43.507 --> 01:29:44.948
completely derailed those efforts.

01:29:45.289 --> 01:29:52.756
Had there been parallel, ongoing research going on at the same time to develop a new generation of control tools, maybe we would have solved the problem.

01:29:52.797 --> 01:29:54.498
And the same thing is true today.

01:29:54.859 --> 01:29:56.360
We have to give antiretrovirals.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:01.205
We have a moral obligation to maximize use of antimalarials and bed nets, deworming drugs.

01:30:01.525 --> 01:30:02.286
Don't stop there.

01:30:02.346 --> 01:30:03.908
Develop the next generation of control tools.

01:30:03.928 --> 01:30:05.049
We tend to declare victory too early.

01:30:05.069 --> 01:30:05.550
It's the problem.

01:30:06.991 --> 01:30:14.639
You can't declare victory too early, says Paul Nurse, the yeast molecular biologist.

01:30:14.699 --> 01:30:22.988
And then quickly comes in UN Columbia University Vatican guy, Jeffrey Sachs, good friend of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:23.928 --> 01:30:27.852
what you have and with what you're gonna need for the next generation, no question.

01:30:27.912 --> 01:30:28.333
Absolutely.

01:30:28.353 --> 01:30:32.857
And we have to think, I think if we develop a vaccine and we can't get it to the people who need it the most.

01:30:32.958 --> 01:30:33.798
It's weird, right?

01:30:33.898 --> 01:30:41.126
Because they just started the whole program with saying that in the first world, we've conquered all these diseases because the vast majority of them are treatable.

01:30:41.607 --> 01:30:46.612
And now we're right back to the point where we need vaccines because the stuff that works doesn't work.

01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:54.872
we would have failed in our mission in terms of getting a solution to malaria.

01:30:54.972 --> 01:31:09.320
So I absolutely agree that while we're thinking about the science, coming up with innovative ways to develop a vaccine, looking at different platforms and technologies to do that, we need to think about how we deliver it in these settings.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:12.922
That being said, I think places can rise to the challenge.

01:31:12.942 --> 01:31:14.943
And we've seen that with antiretroviral drugs.

01:31:15.824 --> 01:31:21.069
in Africa, we've seen compliance when everybody thought that people wouldn't be able to comply with regimens.

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:32.261
Now remember that she is a malaria person, so I don't think malaria is a virus, yet here she is talking and singing the praises of antivirals being, I mean, it's so bizarre.

01:31:32.982 --> 01:31:34.364
These people are performing.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:38.282
And I think, you know, it's a question that remains to be answered.

01:31:38.302 --> 01:31:39.263
We've got to do the research.

01:31:39.283 --> 01:31:40.103
We've got to look at it.

01:31:40.183 --> 01:31:42.985
But people can also step up to the plate and do what needs to get done.

01:31:43.485 --> 01:31:53.031
I think part of the problem has been that the research has sometimes been done in isolation, and it's also not been done for the developing world.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:53.791
That's changing.

01:31:53.911 --> 01:32:04.778
People are investing large amounts of money in looking at ways we address diseases that are not common to this country, in particular malaria, malaria vaccines, and so forth.

01:32:04.998 --> 01:32:06.259
Especially Bill Gates is making.

01:32:06.459 --> 01:32:08.660
And especially the Gates Foundation, exactly.

01:32:09.301 --> 01:32:14.584
I just recently spoke to their Grand Challenges for Global Health meeting, which is all their scientists.

01:32:15.184 --> 01:32:24.050
And I think one of the things that came out in that meeting is that you need the combination of discovery tied with development and tied with delivery.

01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:34.033
so that those people that work on the ground in the developing world are working with those who are trying to develop the new and discover and develop.

01:32:34.573 --> 01:32:44.877
And you need the combination of all of this if you're going to continue to make the next generation of interventions that will really make a difference in global health over the long term.

01:32:45.637 --> 01:32:52.420
And the other thing that I think we have to look at is looking at the integrated package that is beyond health.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.245
an educated person is more likely to be a healthy person.

01:32:56.305 --> 01:32:57.948
So education is very important.

01:32:58.609 --> 01:33:00.932
Clean water is critical to global health.

01:33:01.353 --> 01:33:08.124
And all of the kinds of things that we work in, in development, really all come back to having an impact on global health.

01:33:08.624 --> 01:33:18.395
Well, I mean, I think we may have said it in other ways, but I mean, it's so obvious to me for a long time that poverty and health are so intricately linked and there's no way you can separate them.

01:33:18.495 --> 01:33:18.995
That's right.

01:33:19.095 --> 01:33:21.998
One causes the other, the other causes poverty.

01:33:22.078 --> 01:33:26.663
It's interesting that poverty was the main correlation with deaths in America due to COVID.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:37.342
causes disease, disease causes poverty, you get in a vicious circle, you have to help break the vicious circle.

01:33:37.522 --> 01:33:44.405
And it's education too, because kids don't learn when they have worms in their bellies and they can't be educated if they're infected with malaria.

01:33:44.425 --> 01:33:47.646
Put the environment in that whole sort of mix as well, in that context.

01:33:47.706 --> 01:33:48.467
How does that impact?

01:33:49.887 --> 01:34:02.911
Well, one thing is, as the Nobel Peace Prize this year taught us, we've got looming over a lot of this some grave long-term challenges.

01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:04.471
That's the climate change.

01:34:05.071 --> 01:34:09.812
And we know that diseases like hookworm and malaria are climate-determined.

01:34:09.992 --> 01:34:15.334
And actually, the warming is already leading to a spread of the area infected by these diseases.

01:34:16.653 --> 01:34:26.176
Does it surprise you that already in 2007, Jeffrey Sachs was connecting climate change to the increase in epidemics around the world?

01:34:26.236 --> 01:34:43.880
Does it surprise you at all that he's sitting at a table with a guy who is a yeast molecular biologist and Peter Hotez, head of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in 2007, plus some lady from a, from a world organization on malaria and some lady from UNICEF.

01:34:45.121 --> 01:34:45.621
Global

01:34:46.522 --> 01:34:48.944
climate change and disease.

01:34:51.425 --> 01:34:57.930
That big issue which we're also grappling with on the side is like everything else in this world connected to this as well.

01:34:58.410 --> 01:35:00.932
You can't just argue do this or do this.

01:35:00.992 --> 01:35:02.333
They're all interconnected.

01:35:02.933 --> 01:35:09.357
It's also the case that the local environment that poor people live in is a dangerous environment and that they

01:35:10.578 --> 01:35:14.581
Being poor means you don't have a pump for safe drinking water.

01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:23.446
It means you don't have a housing structure that protects you from the insects that transmit the diseases inside the home, and so forth.

01:35:24.087 --> 01:35:37.896
It means that, shockingly, one to two million children die each year of respiratory infections that are probably aggravated significantly, if not caused by the indoor air pollution,

01:35:38.797 --> 01:35:56.296
It's weird because Christine Stibel-Ben could show that the all-cause mortality in young children went down a lot if they had a live attenuated vaccine versus a recombinant vaccine.

01:35:57.605 --> 01:36:06.996
A lot of her research before the pandemic was looking at how live attenuated vaccines actually increased the expectancy and health outcomes of the kids that took them.

01:36:07.797 --> 01:36:14.925
But recombinant vaccines like the DTaP vaccine actually led to increases in all cause mortality in those groups.

01:36:17.867 --> 01:36:30.342
So what an interesting thing for him again to kind of talk about like the gas coming out of a tailpipe, the vapor coming out of a tailpipe, and the correlation between heavy metals in that gas and that vapor and the speed of the vehicle.

01:36:30.802 --> 01:36:32.044
It's the same nonsense.

01:36:33.625 --> 01:36:36.489
At least the UNICEF lady said that clean water was paramount.

01:36:37.796 --> 01:36:50.279
It's also what Luke Montagnier said at the end of his life when he said, you know, isn't it funny that I say the opposite of what Fauci says, that actually we just need better nutrition and water, and that gets rid of AIDS?

01:36:54.159 --> 01:37:00.641
We are on the precipice of a major breakthrough, ladies and gentlemen, because it is the Vatican.

01:37:01.481 --> 01:37:02.461
It is DITRA.

01:37:03.641 --> 01:37:06.802
It is these people that are connected through the Hamburgs

01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:12.279
and these people that are connected through Jeffrey Sachs and the UN and the Vatican.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.926
Hillary Kaprowski, Stanley Plotkin, Murray Gardner, Bob Gallo, David Baltimore, and Lederberg.

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:29.348
Lederberg was at Rockefeller University.

01:37:31.311 --> 01:37:41.880
Then followed David Baltimore, the guy, you know, who did reverse transcriptase and basically allowed them to define all kinds of things to do with retroviruses being outside of us.

01:37:43.261 --> 01:37:45.283
And then this guy, Paul Nurse.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:38:00.353
cooking on a wood stove, cooking wood on a three-stone stove.

01:38:00.713 --> 01:38:05.756
And so the physical environment of the poor is just not safe.

01:38:05.837 --> 01:38:19.665
And it goes to Anne's point that there's a broader issue of, more generally, the escape from poverty, of which direct attacks on disease is part of it, but so, too, is ensuring that children are in school and so on.

01:38:22.608 --> 01:38:35.058
People that have thought a lot about this, including the world leaders, decided on these Millennium Goals in the year 2000 to say, we have to approach poverty in this interconnected way.

01:38:35.639 --> 01:38:38.601
And the Millennium Goals themselves, there are seven main goals.

01:38:38.882 --> 01:38:40.143
Make no mistake about it.

01:38:41.138 --> 01:38:55.370
The Human Genome Project and the technology that it inspired is parallel to this, because again, the inversion of our sovereignty to permissions was going to happen over these next 20 years.

01:38:56.491 --> 01:39:00.153
So that's why there's this seamless citation rate here.

01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:03.942
Eighth one being that we're going to partner with the poor and the rich.

01:39:04.002 --> 01:39:06.522
But the seven goals are about hunger.

01:39:07.102 --> 01:39:08.403
They're about schooling.

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:12.164
They're about gender equality between girls and boys, men and women.

01:39:12.544 --> 01:39:15.725
They're about maternal... Gender equality.

01:39:15.765 --> 01:39:25.827
He's already starting to use the word that I'm sure that his controllers and his handlers understand is going to be leveraged on us in the coming years.

01:39:28.248 --> 01:39:30.790
and child survival.

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:32.691
They're about the control of diseases.

01:39:33.072 --> 01:39:35.293
They're about access to safe drinking water.

01:39:35.773 --> 01:39:37.755
So they take a holistic approach.

01:39:37.815 --> 01:39:52.204
They say, yes, we need to approach the challenge of extreme poverty with a whole vision that understands that it is education and disease control and more food production and livelihoods to earn income.

01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:54.026
It's a very clever thing.

01:39:54.546 --> 01:39:57.128
It is recognizing there's no one single

01:39:58.008 --> 01:39:59.790
magic bullet to get this done.

01:39:59.830 --> 01:40:04.514
But on the other hand, it's also not so overwhelmingly complicated that it's just a morass.

01:40:04.554 --> 01:40:08.137
It's a few very important things that need to be done.

01:40:08.397 --> 01:40:09.178
I want to come back to that.

01:40:10.118 --> 01:40:11.400
We mentioned neglected diseases.

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.440
I mentioned in my introduction.

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.341
What are we talking about?

01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:15.503
What are the three or four that are most neglected?

01:40:15.563 --> 01:40:16.404
Well, it's a great question.

01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:25.169
So if you look at going back to the Millennium Development Goals, the Millennium Development Goal 6 says to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.

01:40:25.429 --> 01:40:29.091
And unfortunately, we've kind of forgotten about the other diseases a little bit.

01:40:29.131 --> 01:40:32.794
What we're talking about are a group of primarily worm infections.

01:40:32.854 --> 01:40:37.557
These are diseases such as hookworm infection, river blindness, elephantiasis.

01:40:38.177 --> 01:40:42.440
These are the most common infectious diseases of the world's poorest people.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:49.184
So of the 2.5 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, roughly half have one or more of these worm infections.

01:40:49.664 --> 01:40:58.830
So that when you go into a developing country in Sudan, let's say, or go into sub-Saharan Africa, anywhere, what you'll see is that all of the kids in the village

01:40:59.190 --> 01:41:01.011
are chronically infected with these worms.

01:41:01.051 --> 01:41:02.372
These are chronic infections.

01:41:02.672 --> 01:41:04.113
These are debilitating infections.

01:41:04.413 --> 01:41:06.314
And very sadly, they're also very disfiguring.

01:41:06.634 --> 01:41:16.099
Because they're disfiguring, such as elephantiasis, where you have someone's genitals or limbs grossly distorted because of the presence of these worms, they have an enormous stigma attached to them.

01:41:16.179 --> 01:41:21.282
And the stigma particularly hits women of reproductive age very hard.

01:41:21.522 --> 01:41:22.902
This is an audition.

01:41:23.062 --> 01:41:25.984
It feels like an audition because it is an audition.

01:41:26.144 --> 01:41:31.829
unable to marry, or they're not allowed to hold their children, even though this has nothing to do with the transmission of the infections.

01:41:32.069 --> 01:41:34.411
The problem with these worm infections is they don't kill.

01:41:34.951 --> 01:41:42.477
They kill some, but they're mostly debilitating and chronic infections, and so it's very hard to give a two-minute elevator speech about these worm infections.

01:41:42.497 --> 01:41:49.463
The problem, in quotation marks, just to explain, you mean in terms of helping to motivate people to... Helping to motivate people to understand why there are these...

01:41:50.923 --> 01:42:03.190
And if I could just say one other thing, and the other very important part about these worm infections is that they promote susceptibility to malaria, they exacerbate the disease caused by malaria, and now there's evidence that they increase transmission of HIV-AIDS.

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:09.413
So they got to link all of these phenomenon together in order to make it, you know, justify their work.

01:42:09.553 --> 01:42:12.155
Again, what we're talking about in biology 101 terms

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:21.359
are picking a few gears out of the watch and then claiming that by monitoring these three gears, you're contributing to the understanding of the whole watch.

01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:25.760
If we monitor hookworm, we see more malaria.

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.201
If we monitor hookworm, we see more HIV.

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:35.144
Therefore, my research on hookworm is just as important as her research on malaria and their research on HIV.

01:42:35.645 --> 01:42:36.425
Stop lying!

01:42:37.085 --> 01:42:38.346
Stop lying!

01:42:39.861 --> 01:42:48.965
And then we have the Nobel Prize winner in yeast molecular biology overseeing and refereeing this discussion with a clever smile on his face.

01:42:49.385 --> 01:42:53.067
These are your stealth, because they're so easy to treat, 50 cents a person per year.

01:42:53.347 --> 01:42:54.787
This is your stealth weapon for AIDS.

01:42:54.807 --> 01:42:56.828
This is your stealth weapon for malaria.

01:42:56.848 --> 01:42:57.969
Stealth weapons.

01:42:59.363 --> 01:43:07.475
Well, first, about 37% is neonatal causes, so those who die in their first month of life for a variety of reasons.

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:15.165
Then pneumonia is the number one after that, treatable with a basic antibiotic.

01:43:16.748 --> 01:43:21.791
Malaria, diarrheal diseases, these are all the big killers of children.

01:43:22.272 --> 01:43:23.693
Vaccine-preventable diseases.

01:43:23.733 --> 01:43:26.235
Vaccine-preventable diseases, for the most part.

01:43:26.495 --> 01:43:35.102
There was a flurry of news last week about... She just said that pneumonia was an antibiotic-preventable and treatable disease, not a vaccine-preventable one.

01:43:35.922 --> 01:43:37.524
So that was almost forced in there.

01:43:37.564 --> 01:43:38.484
That was a little gross.

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:44.029
Microbes and the amount of death that came that exceeded that from HIV.

01:43:44.369 --> 01:43:45.630
Please tell me what that was all about.

01:43:46.170 --> 01:43:49.998
Oh, well, I didn't read this particular article.

01:43:50.138 --> 01:43:56.349
What is clear is that microbial diseases, which 30 years ago we thought we'd beaten,

01:43:57.335 --> 01:43:58.476
I mean, they eliminated it.

01:43:59.156 --> 01:44:00.837
It was just going down and going to disappear.

01:44:00.857 --> 01:44:02.098
They've just come back.

01:44:02.599 --> 01:44:06.101
I mean, this is associated with antibiotic resistance and the like.

01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:12.265
Of course, a problem in the developed world is super bugs, which are resistant in hospitals.

01:44:12.506 --> 01:44:14.367
Super bugs in hospitals.

01:44:14.427 --> 01:44:25.875
It's weird because there are rivers in India that are absolutely overflowing with antibiotics that have been featured on things like 60 Minutes, and there's still no super bugs coming out of those things.

01:44:27.421 --> 01:44:34.566
like foaming with multiple antibiotics right outside of the place where they're being made, and yet there's no superbugs in those rivers.

01:44:35.167 --> 01:44:39.570
The people who are downstream from those rivers aren't completely dead from superbugs.

01:44:41.111 --> 01:44:43.193
Are there resistant bacteria?

01:44:43.293 --> 01:44:44.334
I think it's possible.

01:44:44.414 --> 01:44:46.155
Yes, I definitely think so.

01:44:47.036 --> 01:44:52.860
But do they threaten to overwhelm us because we'll all be susceptible to the novel bacteria?

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:52.920
No.

01:44:54.585 --> 01:45:00.648
No more than a novel RNA coronavirus, whatever that is, could threaten the world.

01:45:02.148 --> 01:45:09.731
So they're still juggling this mythology around in their head, finding a way to deploy it where it's believable.

01:45:10.672 --> 01:45:11.612
That's what's happening here.

01:45:11.652 --> 01:45:13.233
It's a real-time juggling act.

01:45:14.079 --> 01:45:16.402
where Charlie Rose is one of the victims.

01:45:16.462 --> 01:45:18.525
It's kind of the audience that they're reading it out on.

01:45:18.565 --> 01:45:19.626
Did Charlie buy it?

01:45:19.686 --> 01:45:22.891
What question did he ask after you made that point?

01:45:22.971 --> 01:45:24.913
Oh, we don't want him to ask that question again.

01:45:25.394 --> 01:45:30.621
So maybe we should adjust what you said there so that it provokes a different question from the Charlie Rose next time.

01:45:31.622 --> 01:45:33.003
but we see it on the ground.

01:45:33.083 --> 01:45:40.689
I mean the antibiotics that we'd have used as first line of defense are gradually becoming a problem because we need to have new antibiotics.

01:45:41.029 --> 01:45:43.431
That's why I said a bit earlier we declare victory too soon.

01:45:43.451 --> 01:45:47.695
If we don't need new antibiotics then what will these pharmaceutical companies patent?

01:45:48.976 --> 01:46:04.127
If we don't need new antibiotics and that all the derivatives of penicillin work fine for gram-negative bacteria still to this day, then why in the world would we need new antibiotics unless it's just for pharmaceutical companies to make new products?

01:46:04.227 --> 01:46:13.054
Why would we need a yeast molecular biologist to explain this to us on a Charlie Rose show with the most invited speaker at the Vatican?

01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:17.211
These come back and they bite again.

01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:18.191
They are evolving.

01:46:18.251 --> 01:46:19.052
They are changing.

01:46:19.092 --> 01:46:20.053
These bugs are changing.

01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:24.396
So this is a major problem that we thought we'd solved in 1960 and we have not.

01:46:24.916 --> 01:46:27.859
And then we have an issue of how we... He keeps looking down at the table.

01:46:27.899 --> 01:46:29.300
Of course, you've noticed that already.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:39.708
We do solve them because when we have a research system in industry which is driven by how much profit one can make,

01:46:40.248 --> 01:46:49.134
If the company cannot make profit by producing new antibiotics that would work in the developing world, those new antibiotics are not going to be developed, they're not going to be made.

01:46:49.455 --> 01:46:50.936
And I'm very interested in this problem.

01:46:50.956 --> 01:46:58.321
I'd like to hear what our visitors here would say about that, because the normal drivers are not actually operative here.

01:46:58.341 --> 01:46:59.642
I mean, how do we deal with this?

01:46:59.682 --> 01:47:03.425
I mean, obviously Gates putting money in would be one way of dealing with it, but

01:47:04.065 --> 01:47:15.966
Basically, the system we have, which we have got used to operating with, is not going to deliver the solutions to the sort of problems that you identified, Charlie, with microbes and also these specific diseases.

01:47:16.006 --> 01:47:16.748
What do we do about this?

01:47:17.366 --> 01:47:19.688
Well I think you know you've hit the nail on the head.

01:47:19.768 --> 01:47:26.395
How do you incentivize an organization to make a product for people who can't afford to pay for it?

01:47:26.635 --> 01:47:31.259
This is the biomedical equivalent of the movie The Producers instead of Springtime.

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.822
I really think that this is a bullshit argument.

01:47:33.922 --> 01:47:35.443
I think that the idea

01:47:36.496 --> 01:47:47.483
the limited spectrum of debate that it is money that we have, and we have to decide whether we have the heart and the wherewithal to spend it on people that won't give it back to us.

01:47:48.484 --> 01:47:54.248
And so this is the limited spectrum of debate that they are crafting right here, that the deal is not really money.

01:47:54.308 --> 01:48:00.932
It's just a question of whether you want to spend the money or not, and whether you have the heart to see that spending this money would save so many kids.

01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:15.067
It's a limited spectrum of debate that they are auditioning to participate in and maybe even helping to craft in real time because this is back in the day before social media took over our brains.

01:48:15.807 --> 01:48:24.811
Before it would be necessary to have a guy like Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein and all these other podcasts out there.

01:48:26.667 --> 01:48:55.914
with skateboarders and people that claim they're, you know, started multimillionaires and want to save kids from whatever and whatever, like impact theory, all of these silly podcasts, Sean Ryan, Lex Friedman, those people are all fifth generation warfare manifestations of what was not necessary back when everybody only watched four major news networks.

01:48:57.185 --> 01:49:01.006
And a lot of people could be counted on to watch 60 Minutes and talk about it the next day.

01:49:01.046 --> 01:49:05.187
And a lot of people could be counted on to watch Charlie Rose and talk about it the next day.

01:49:05.227 --> 01:49:09.388
And so they didn't have social media available to them like they do now.

01:49:10.068 --> 01:49:15.790
And social media did not play the role in our lives and on our thinking as it does now.

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:25.292
And so the illusion of consensus that was used at the time was sending a few guests onto Charlie Rose and some of them being on script.

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:36.336
One of them being a Englishman that could use his accent to pretend like he knew what he was talking about, even though he is just a yeast molecular biologist.

01:49:37.887 --> 01:49:40.088
Springtime for Hitler, we're making springtime for hookworm.

01:49:40.788 --> 01:49:47.131
How do we develop the next generation of products for people who can never afford to pay for it?

01:49:47.412 --> 01:49:48.932
I'll give you the urgency of this.

01:49:50.013 --> 01:49:56.056
20 years after the licensure of hepatitis B vaccine, we still haven't penetrated markets in developing countries.

01:49:56.736 --> 01:49:59.578
Look at the HPV vaccine, the vaccine for cervical cancer.

01:50:00.019 --> 01:50:05.022
It's estimated that 38,000 women in South America die every year of cervical cancer.

01:50:05.583 --> 01:50:14.669
Most of those 38,000 women in South America are women who are younger than who die in the United States because they don't have access to routine pap smear screening.

01:50:14.849 --> 01:50:17.051
That's pretty spectacular grossness right here.

01:50:19.052 --> 01:50:22.835
The HPV vaccine is probably the worst vaccine on our schedule in America.

01:50:25.835 --> 01:50:28.990
And the hepatitis B vaccine is one that they give babies on the day of birth.

01:50:32.551 --> 01:50:43.440
So what you're looking at are 38,000 women in their 30s and 40s who are dying every year from cervical cancer, 38,000 families totally devastated and destroyed.

01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:53.088
Multiply that times 20 years, because right now, HPV vaccine, the cervical cancer vaccine, I just got my daughter vaccinated, it's $360 for the three vaccinations.

01:50:53.108 --> 01:50:55.670
There's no way you're going to get a $360 vaccine

01:51:00.966 --> 01:51:04.690
Oh my god, is this before he writes his book about his daughter?

01:51:09.413 --> 01:51:11.996
Is his daughter injured by the HPV vaccine?

01:51:13.017 --> 01:51:13.877
Or is it genetic?

01:51:14.898 --> 01:51:16.179
He wrote a book about it, remember?

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.821
He just said he vaccinated his daughter.

01:51:19.462 --> 01:51:22.965
Is it possible that he's vaccinating his autism-having daughter?

01:51:23.525 --> 01:51:25.927
Is that who he's using on this program right now?

01:51:26.708 --> 01:51:28.930
I don't want to dig into his history, but somebody should.

01:51:29.378 --> 01:51:31.579
minister to poor women in Latin America.

01:51:31.839 --> 01:51:41.202
So we need to find new innovative mechanisms to bring the price down and to have a structure, an infrastructure, by which you can make vaccines for less than a dollar a dose from day one.

01:51:41.442 --> 01:51:43.422
That's what Tanya's doing.

01:51:43.442 --> 01:51:45.463
That's what we're trying to do with the Save & Vaccine Institute.

01:51:45.603 --> 01:51:49.765
And I think that's really interesting because even some of the examples you've used are things that have markets.

01:51:50.005 --> 01:51:53.126
HPV has rich world markets that you could tap into.

01:51:53.146 --> 01:51:57.347
A malaria vaccine will not, you know, have a rich world market necessary.

01:51:57.407 --> 01:51:59.208
A traveler's market's not enough.

01:51:59.528 --> 01:52:07.771
One thing we could talk about, and I'm by no means an expert in this, is new ways of creating innovative financing mechanisms and pull funding.

01:52:08.432 --> 01:52:11.653
One thing we've been talking a lot about is advanced market commitments.

01:52:12.273 --> 01:52:17.255
And we're going through a pilot case of this now for a pneumococcal vaccine.

01:52:17.855 --> 01:52:21.956
And I think that's a really interesting thing for us to look at going forward.

01:52:21.996 --> 01:52:24.457
So this comes before the 2009 debacle with Wolfgang Wodar.

01:52:33.658 --> 01:52:50.290
And that debacle was caused by the fact that the WHO and vaccine sales people went around from country to country saying that the total capacity of our vaccines was X number of shots, and Denmark has already bought Y, and so there's only Z left.

01:52:50.370 --> 01:52:59.817
And so if you don't buy as many as you need now, it could be that when we come back at the beginning of the pandemic, all of the doses will be spoken for by other countries who had bigger balls than you.

01:53:03.308 --> 01:53:08.212
He's talking about the exact same kind of pre-sale commitment.

01:53:11.354 --> 01:53:20.782
Talking about the exact same scam that Wolfgang Wodach ended up crashing his career on in 2009, 10, and 11, as he revealed that that's exactly what happened.

01:53:22.223 --> 01:53:23.324
The swine flu vaccine.

01:53:24.232 --> 01:53:52.272
eating about that uh... many years ago when we propose that they're basically two two things uh... that need to be done when you're trying to develop a medicine or vaccine or diagnostic for poor people it's for a condition that rich people also suffer from then it's likely that the rich world market will give the incentives and then the problem comes how do you get that same medicine that's been developed to the poor what we've been discussing so far

01:53:52.952 --> 01:54:01.858
But what if it's a condition like these worm infections or malaria and so forth, which is basically a poor region problem?

01:54:02.599 --> 01:54:04.500
Then the markets by themselves won't do it.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:10.404
And there are two kinds of solutions that have proven to be effective.

01:54:10.644 --> 01:54:15.748
One is you put money on the table and you basically give an incentive to get the research done.

01:54:15.788 --> 01:54:19.070
And that's what Bill Gates and Melinda have been doing.

01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:21.352
And they've set up a number of

01:54:22.625 --> 01:54:30.092
quite remarkable efforts for malaria vaccine, for tuberculosis vaccine, for AIDS vaccines, for new medicines for each of these.

01:54:30.592 --> 01:54:38.059
And that's putting money on the table and getting the big companies to partner, but because they were getting paid to do this.

01:54:38.519 --> 01:54:39.720
And then they make the deal.

01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:43.944
And so then he funds the companies that he also with his foundation.

01:54:45.814 --> 01:54:53.141
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is also backed up by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

01:54:55.303 --> 01:55:09.276
So Jeffrey Sachs is very conveniently talking about the forward-facing pile of weaponized money that's actually a small weaponized pile of money compared to the larger weaponized pile of money, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

01:55:11.331 --> 01:55:25.085
Very similar to the fact that the CDC and the FDA have a trust foundation where pharmaceutical companies can donate as much money as they want to and then that sort of gets laundered essentially into the FDA or the CDC budget.

01:55:27.367 --> 01:55:33.133
It's supposed to be for donations, you know, because these are humanitarian causes.

01:55:36.172 --> 01:55:44.118
We're talking about all the same mechanisms and all the same lies, all the same limited spectrum of debate already being laid down in 2007 on Charlie Rose.

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.303
Bill Gates was going to save us and it was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but it's not.

01:55:51.483 --> 01:56:00.790
It's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation investing in companies that the foundation trust invests in so that then they reap the profits from the investment.

01:56:02.398 --> 01:56:08.340
And they publicize the investment in those companies so that those stocks and those companies go up because Bill invested in them.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.161
But it's not the investment that you're thinking of.

01:56:13.242 --> 01:56:22.005
When you say investment and Sachs says investment, you're thinking of the money that Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave to the company to make the cure.

01:56:22.881 --> 01:56:32.387
You're not thinking about the investment of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation trust that's buying stock in the company that the foundation is granting money to.

01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:43.715
And that's why Bill doesn't mind giving away his money because his trust invests in the companies that his foundation grants money to.

01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:47.451
And at the same time, his foundation publicizes.

01:56:48.171 --> 01:56:52.373
And so it looks like that we should buy this stock because Bill invested in it.

01:56:52.673 --> 01:57:04.337
And you don't understand that because of the nature of the semantic enchantment that somebody like this is willing to cast, you just get it all confused and you don't realize that there are two piles of money.

01:57:04.477 --> 01:57:05.958
One is much bigger than the other one.

01:57:06.178 --> 01:57:08.019
And Jeffrey is referring to the small one.

01:57:09.439 --> 01:57:11.340
That the grants come from the small one.

01:57:12.096 --> 01:57:18.299
And that's why the little dog barking in the background named Peter Hotez is so happy about it because he gets those grants.

01:57:19.319 --> 01:57:22.421
He doesn't have a company that the Foundational Trust is invested in.

01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:27.563
And if he does, he's fine with it.

01:57:30.645 --> 01:57:34.887
If you get something, it won't be under a patent-protected high price.

01:57:35.187 --> 01:57:37.928
We'll make that available on an open license.

01:57:37.968 --> 01:57:41.050
What an interesting thing to bring up, patent law and IP.

01:57:42.546 --> 01:57:56.435
what happened at the beginning of the pandemic, but IP in the pharmaceutical space changed drastically after the Supreme Court basically declared that monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies and the patents surrounding them are based on bullshit biology.

01:57:57.276 --> 01:58:02.199
So that none of these patents would actually stand up to scrutiny in court or whatever it's called for a patent.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:12.026
And so very quietly, the entire pharmaceutical industry around the world reorganized around biologics and reorganized around mRNA.

01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:20.397
and the processes and the proprietary technologies needed to bring a transfection technology to market.

01:58:20.417 --> 01:58:30.227
And so there are all the patents, all the new patents that Peter, like Peter Cullis and Robert Malone are all interested in and well aware of, probably brokering

01:58:31.977 --> 01:58:39.180
while they keep you focused on antibodies and keep you focused on repurposed drugs and keep you focused on the Scooby-Doo mystery of where did the virus come from.

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:49.724
This guy was integral in laying down the foundational mystery story because he was the head of the Lancet Commission.

01:58:51.105 --> 01:59:00.449
He's the one who appointed Peter Daszak and all these other clowns like Koopmans from the Netherlands to this investigational committee.

01:59:02.028 --> 01:59:06.070
And he's very conveniently in place to say, it looks like the Chinese were covering it up.

01:59:06.110 --> 01:59:07.711
It looks like the Americans were covering it up.

01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:09.471
We probably have responsibility for it.

01:59:09.511 --> 01:59:10.372
America's terrible.

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:15.314
That's who Jeffrey Sachs is.

01:59:17.355 --> 01:59:19.276
A real hero of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:23.376 --> 01:59:24.377
to the poor.

01:59:24.537 --> 01:59:25.198
That's one way.

01:59:25.939 --> 01:59:35.368
The other way, which is a way that a colleague, Michael Kramer, and I promoted starting about 10 years ago, and it's now being tried for the first time.

01:59:35.448 --> 01:59:44.998
I mean, if Bobby Kennedy spent time with this guy in a tent in Africa when he was younger, then is it any surprise that this guy would have the ability to influence him over those many years?

01:59:46.021 --> 01:59:51.486
Maybe actually almost in effect brainwash him into accepting some truths about the world that aren't true.

01:59:52.186 --> 01:59:56.470
Maybe Bobby is just a patsy, a dork, a guy who just goes along.

01:59:57.430 --> 02:00:05.697
Which explains why he did the bear story, because a bunch of drugged up friends were in the car and convinced him to do something stupid at age 50, so he did it.

02:00:08.059 --> 02:00:14.925
If he's got friends like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Jeffrey Sachs, then what does he really know?

02:00:20.939 --> 02:00:24.387
If he knows what those people told him, I would suggest that he doesn't know very much.

02:00:31.912 --> 02:00:33.914
Try to make it as if there were a market.

02:00:34.535 --> 02:00:43.924
So get a bunch of governments together and say, whoever invents a vaccine for so-and-so will be the market for you.

02:00:44.104 --> 02:00:50.331
And we'll announce today, though there is no vaccine, that whenever you have it, we'll pay $10 a dose from you.

02:00:52.893 --> 02:00:54.675
Now, go take that to the bank.

02:00:55.176 --> 02:00:56.918
Go get a venture capitalist.

02:00:56.998 --> 02:01:02.504
Go get some rich investors to do it because there's a guaranteed market for you.

02:01:02.564 --> 02:01:05.007
So that's what's called an advanced market commitment.

02:01:05.408 --> 02:01:10.173
And this is just now being tried for the first time with the pneumococcal.

02:01:10.994 --> 02:01:27.026
Just to make sure, just to kind of correct the Pete guy in the chat, you have to read the actual opinion that the Supreme Court wrote, which was written by Gorsuch, to know what changed about patent law with relation to monoclonal antibodies.

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:27.727
You have to read it.

02:01:28.267 --> 02:01:45.061
If you haven't read it, then to say that no longer considered a patentable invention is because the biology which was cut and pasted across a lot of these patents is biology that is refutable and has been refuted.

02:01:45.602 --> 02:01:46.102
That's why.

02:01:46.983 --> 02:01:52.988
So they're no longer patentable because the biology that we understand that underlied those patents is no longer real.

02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:58.525
were misrepresented as a biological purity that they're not.

02:01:58.585 --> 02:02:00.006
That's the real truth.

02:02:00.607 --> 02:02:12.558
It could apply to malaria vaccine, it could apply to a hookworm vaccine, it could apply to these other conditions where you don't have a real market because the people that you're trying to help are too poor to be a market.

02:02:12.598 --> 02:02:16.842
I mean one question I have about the advanced market is whether that will work for

02:02:17.562 --> 02:02:21.163
products for diseases for which there's absolutely no U.S.

02:02:21.223 --> 02:02:22.163
or European market.

02:02:22.504 --> 02:02:22.884
It'll work.

02:02:22.904 --> 02:02:25.204
I believe it'll work for pneumococcal vaccine.

02:02:25.284 --> 02:02:27.505
It'll work maybe even for malaria.

02:02:27.785 --> 02:02:28.625
I don't know about hookworm.

02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:37.448
I still think for hookworm or diseases like hookworm that only occur among poor people in developing countries, we still depend heavily

02:02:37.908 --> 02:02:44.450
on organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to step up and really do the right thing and fund it.

02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:47.771
The problem being, Bill Gates can't be everything to everyone.

02:02:48.151 --> 02:02:51.192
And so what we need is more.

02:02:51.312 --> 02:02:52.172
I got to give you credit.

02:02:52.192 --> 02:02:52.692
That's funny.

02:02:52.712 --> 02:02:55.613
Yeah, it was once mysterious is now patently obvious.

02:02:56.293 --> 02:02:57.013
Kudos to you.

02:02:57.073 --> 02:02:57.993
That's the pun of the day.

02:02:58.053 --> 02:02:59.514
I'm going to use that on Twitter or something.

02:03:00.414 --> 02:03:04.038
organizations like the Gates Foundation to help finance these programs.

02:03:04.078 --> 02:03:05.399
But let me just raise this point on that.

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:17.972
My impression is that global health and global poverty has become a much more hot, for the lack of a better word, issue.

02:03:18.812 --> 02:03:22.234
And therefore, it's attracting more philanthropic dollars.

02:03:22.774 --> 02:03:33.219
People who might have formerly given to a very worthy cause, let's say a museum or a library, are now somehow attracted to river blindness or things like that.

02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.902
And therefore, that leads me to, A, is that true?

02:03:38.742 --> 02:03:41.563
And so therefore, there are more dollars and more interest in global health issues.

02:03:42.004 --> 02:03:45.565
It also leads me to sort of this, which is always fascinating for me,

02:03:46.963 --> 02:03:50.284
Is there out there, among especially the two of you, several bullets?

02:03:50.765 --> 02:04:01.029
I mean, where is the hope for the research side, vaccines, whatever kind of development that we ought to know about?

02:04:01.434 --> 02:04:07.803
may be naive because of my youth, but I believe that we will have a malaria vaccine in my lifetime.

02:04:07.843 --> 02:04:14.151
And I think we have a promising candidate now, as I mentioned.

02:04:14.552 --> 02:04:15.092
Easily.

02:04:16.735 --> 02:04:18.116
So close to the solution.

02:04:18.197 --> 02:04:18.377
Right.

02:04:18.537 --> 02:04:18.857
Both.

02:04:18.877 --> 02:04:18.998
Both.

02:04:19.298 --> 02:04:34.751
Just like we're going to cure all disease by 2040, according to Ray Kurzweiler, that we're going to be able to upload our consciousness into a computer in 2045, this is the same bullshit biology mythology that they push on you in Biology 101 at every university.

02:04:35.611 --> 02:04:42.157
That just over the next hill, within 10 years, all of these things that have heretofore been science fiction will become reality.

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.861
Maybe she's just naive in her youth.

02:04:46.783 --> 02:04:47.303
But we do.

02:04:47.383 --> 02:04:52.086
We have a really exciting, robust portfolio of vaccines that we're looking at developing.

02:04:52.126 --> 02:05:03.314
We've got a lead candidate that shows some effect against clinical malaria and also some effect against the most severe forms of the disease.

02:05:04.488 --> 02:05:10.493
As I mentioned before, that's going to go into phase three efficacy trials next year, the latest stage of development.

02:05:10.513 --> 02:05:13.195
And we'll know in a few years whether or not that will work.

02:05:13.235 --> 02:05:16.137
That will be a partially efficacious vaccine.

02:05:16.157 --> 02:05:19.139
It wouldn't protect totally against malaria.

02:05:19.199 --> 02:05:25.965
And at the same time, we're developing new candidates, utilizing new technologies, utilizing new platforms.

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:31.707
So apparently with malaria, it was already accepted that there would never be a sterilizing vaccine.

02:05:31.807 --> 02:05:39.009
I don't know if that's real terminology or not anymore, but I know that that was terminology that I was using at the beginning of 2021, end of 2020.

02:05:41.238 --> 02:05:49.503
And so it's curious that already in 2007, they're talking about vaccines that aren't perfect, that don't prevent disease, that can prevent severe malaria.

02:05:49.543 --> 02:06:02.330
And so it sounds like to me, quite frankly, that this idea that there are imperfect vaccines that are still worthwhile has been tested and gamed out on malaria before it was just rolled out in general.

02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:12.580
Because now that's the general attitude that vaccines never prevented disease, that vaccines only prevent severe disease, protect you from hospitalization.

02:06:13.061 --> 02:06:25.334
And so vaccines are justified in a very different way than they were when, you know, he was talking earlier about the control and eradication of smallpox and talking about how when they put their foot down, measles went away.

02:06:25.854 --> 02:06:40.434
We're not really talking in equivalence here, and I find it very funny that her, in particular, with regard to malaria, is using some of these, let's say, mealy-mouthed terms that have become part of the capital E enchantment that we are currently fighting against.

02:06:41.110 --> 02:06:42.371
And I think they're very promising.

02:06:42.411 --> 02:06:51.900
Another very promising candidate that we have is the Scenario, a whole sporozoid candidate vaccine, which is a whole parasite vaccine that's very much classical vaccinology.

02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:55.223
That's another up and coming vaccine.

02:06:55.463 --> 02:06:57.325
How does that work be more effectively?

02:06:57.714 --> 02:07:04.036
Well, the candidate vaccine... He's like a weird English Robin Williams or something.

02:07:04.056 --> 02:07:04.456
He's freaky.

02:07:04.476 --> 02:07:10.538
We have in current development is actually targeting one part of the life cycle of malaria.

02:07:10.598 --> 02:07:12.178
It's a recombinant protein approach.

02:07:12.198 --> 02:07:15.059
So it's a fairly simple, straightforward approach.

02:07:15.099 --> 02:07:18.900
It's a protein that's been made by splicing genes together to make a new sort of protein.

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:19.580
Right, right.

02:07:20.141 --> 02:07:24.882
And the whole spores... He got a Nobel Prize in molecular biology for

02:07:26.477 --> 02:07:33.542
cell division cycle mutants in fission yeast, but recombinant protein means what again?

02:07:33.582 --> 02:07:36.585
It just means mixing genes together, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:07:36.905 --> 02:07:52.677
So I'd approach that we have, um, that we're collaborating with scenario, Steve Hoffman's group to develop, um, is really, I think, a, a classical live attenuated approach to developing a vaccine, um, irradiating the, uh, malaria parasite and giving that as the vaccine.

02:07:53.117 --> 02:07:53.938
It turns out that

02:07:54.158 --> 02:08:00.366
The best proof of concept for vaccines is taking the whole organism and somehow making it weaker.

02:08:00.426 --> 02:08:04.511
So the oral polio vaccine is taking attenuated strains.

02:08:04.611 --> 02:08:10.980
He's trying his best to audition, but I bet you he's kind of getting it too close to correct for it to be good.

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.201
polio vaccine, same with measles vaccine.

02:08:13.461 --> 02:08:18.304
The problem for the vaccines that Tanya and I are focused on is we're dealing with whole animals.

02:08:18.384 --> 02:08:23.688
We're dealing with more complicated organisms, and so it's much more complicated to attenuate them.

02:08:23.748 --> 02:08:27.390
So in some ways, the low-hanging fruit has been done, the easy vaccines.

02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:30.212
We're not taking on the harder vaccines, but it's still doable.

02:08:30.792 --> 02:08:34.874
It may take a little longer, but there's no question that we will have malaria vaccines.

02:08:35.175 --> 02:08:36.815
We will have tuberculosis vaccines.

02:08:37.116 --> 02:08:38.937
We'll have hookworm vaccines, God willing.

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:44.880
And I also believe that an AIDS vaccine is still definitely feasible, although we have had a big setback.

02:08:45.208 --> 02:08:47.549
So, so far, none of them, none of them are there.

02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:50.330
And yes, this is the Jack Black of vaccines.

02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:51.651
In the last few months.

02:08:51.871 --> 02:08:52.211
What's that?

02:08:52.671 --> 02:09:08.017
Well, the setback is Merck had a very exciting candidate vaccine that rely, everyone was always saying it's the problem is we're not, we're too focused on initiating T cell antibody responses rather than the right kind of T cell responses.

02:09:08.477 --> 02:09:13.279
Merck has made this vaccine that generated the right kind of T cell vaccine responses, but it's still not protecting.

02:09:14.034 --> 02:09:14.675
Interesting.

02:09:14.755 --> 02:09:28.871
So that is around the time when Tony Fauci was doing interviews about the vaccine and telling everybody how they were almost there and that antibodies versus T-cells and it turns out that the T-cell response didn't help very much.

02:09:28.971 --> 02:09:30.172
So that's curious, right?

02:09:30.853 --> 02:09:34.257
Sounds like they don't really understand how to augment the immune system yet.

02:09:38.441 --> 02:09:47.866
The immune system you have antibodies, there's two parts to it really, antibodies which are proteins that fight disease and then cells of the body, the T-cells that fight.

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:55.030
And this was supposed to stimulate the T-cell approach which hadn't been tried before but unfortunately, or not effectively before.

02:09:55.390 --> 02:10:01.474
So he's an expert on vaccinology in the AIDS context now, I wonder what he knows about retroviruses.

02:10:01.594 --> 02:10:05.256
It's really bizarre, it's really bizarre

02:10:06.411 --> 02:10:07.792
You can only see it one way.

02:10:07.812 --> 02:10:20.580
This is national security narrative curation at its best being done old school with a couple controlled voices and a couple unwitting participants in an interview on television.

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:25.703
And one of them has an enticing English accent.

02:10:26.003 --> 02:10:29.145
It's the perfect American recipe for propaganda.

02:10:29.690 --> 02:10:31.751
but we're still not getting protection.

02:10:31.811 --> 02:10:34.493
But what I really hope is Merck doesn't walk away from the problem.

02:10:34.533 --> 02:10:36.295
I hope Merck continues to chip away at it.

02:10:36.655 --> 02:10:43.860
Well, Merck will get the Ebola vaccine after Robert Malone brokers it from Vykal.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.622
So, you know, Merck will stay in the vaccine game for some time.

02:10:47.703 --> 02:10:58.010
Merck is actually the company that bought the patents from Inderverma that Robert Malone claimed to have originated at the start of the pandemic and the reason for his being

02:10:58.630 --> 02:11:01.091
featured on Brett Weinstein's podcast.

02:11:01.111 --> 02:11:19.794
You know, Brett Weinstein, the son of Les Weinstein, the first patent lawyer to be appointed to the Department of Justice in the Kennedy administration, oversaw the formation of the FDA and the thalidomide scandals, and maybe even knew about how the Senator Kefauver was murdered.

02:11:20.275 --> 02:11:21.735
Still a solvable problem, I believe.

02:11:22.195 --> 02:11:22.635
UNICEF.

02:11:23.795 --> 02:11:26.976
Tell me about how this fits in terms of your mandate.

02:11:27.503 --> 02:11:30.985
Well, we're the largest procuring agency of vaccines in the world.

02:11:31.806 --> 02:11:42.412
A lot of it is procurement, medical supplies, vaccines, and also working with developing countries on integrated approaches.

02:11:42.652 --> 02:11:44.633
And we also procure a lot of bed nets.

02:11:44.833 --> 02:11:47.435
We're one of the largest procurement agencies for bed nets.

02:11:48.775 --> 02:11:58.458
So all of the kinds of interventions we've been talking about, UNICEF works in these areas, both on the supply and procurement side, as well as on the delivery.

02:11:58.518 --> 02:11:59.838
I have lots of black friends.

02:12:00.758 --> 02:12:06.139
When I had Bill and Melinda Gates here, they talked about antiretrovirals.

02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:08.540
Where are we on that issue?

02:12:09.773 --> 02:12:24.050
The world has committed, the rich world has committed, our governments have said that by the year 2010, just three years off, that everybody that clinically needs those medicines should have them available.

02:12:24.371 --> 02:12:28.856
There should be universal access to antiretroviral medicines.

02:12:29.793 --> 02:12:43.637
Now, six years ago, there wasn't one single person in a poor country that had support from any rich country program to be on antiretrovirals.

02:12:43.697 --> 02:12:49.839
Many people said it would be impossible to do this at all because the poor wouldn't be able to adhere.

02:12:49.879 --> 02:12:51.499
I think they're still talking about AIDS.

02:12:51.539 --> 02:12:56.901
When they say antiretrovirals at this time, they're usually just talking about AIDS, even though I would think that they would

02:12:57.842 --> 02:12:59.805
need to be a little more specific, they're not.

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:05.272
To the drug regimens or there was no infrastructure in the last few years.

02:13:05.372 --> 02:13:07.815
I thought AZT saved people from AIDS.

02:13:13.089 --> 02:13:18.530
because of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and because of the U.S.

02:13:19.450 --> 02:13:24.091
program, emergency program, to fight AIDS, the so-called PEPFAR program.

02:13:24.751 --> 02:13:41.635
Now there is a breakthrough where there are about a million Africans right now that are on antiretroviral medicine, and the numbers are going up because the basic process of helping people to get these drugs is taking hold.

02:13:42.395 --> 02:13:49.002
But we have a long way to go to reach that goal of universal access for all who need it.

02:13:49.863 --> 02:13:52.345
It's like all the things we've been talking about, though, Charlie.

02:13:52.365 --> 02:13:58.611
There's nothing which would stop it from happening if we have a commitment, leadership.

02:13:59.933 --> 02:14:02.315
Maybe it's that czar we discussed earlier.

02:14:02.375 --> 02:14:04.057
I don't know the answer to that question.

02:14:05.757 --> 02:14:09.360
whether they have an effect on innate exosomal activity.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.722
But it's, of course, a question I think very much deserves answer.

02:14:13.983 --> 02:14:19.467
But a plan that says we're really going to... My guess is that it's detrimental.

02:14:20.208 --> 02:14:25.412
...meet the goals that we've made, we can achieve what we have set out to do.

02:14:26.052 --> 02:14:34.859
And it would mean millions of people's lives saved, and it would mean even more millions of children who would not be orphaned by this horrible disease.

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.685
By the way, I'm in favor of the idea, notwithstanding, simply because it focuses everything.

02:14:41.045 --> 02:14:41.726
Absolutely.

02:14:41.966 --> 02:14:42.306
It does.

02:14:42.466 --> 02:14:52.997
But I think this point about, you know, it's only been in the last three or four years that the whole AIDS issue has been addressed with both the drugs and the testing.

02:14:53.478 --> 02:14:56.281
And you can really see the difference on the ground in Africa.

02:14:56.841 --> 02:14:58.322
I just got back from Botswana.

02:14:58.362 --> 02:15:06.868
Now, Botswana happens to be one of the most proactive countries in dealing with the HIV problem, but they've also got a very high prevalence rate of about 35%.

02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:14.453
But they now have coverage of what's called PMTCT, which is prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

02:15:14.493 --> 02:15:23.299
That means testing pregnant women and making sure they get the right kind of drugs before they deliver so that you have less chance of passing that on.

02:15:23.459 --> 02:15:24.399
They have 93% coverage.

02:15:26.901 --> 02:15:29.962
Now, the average of it was about 10 percent three years ago.

02:15:31.962 --> 02:15:40.285
They now have reduced, because of that, they've reduced mother-to-child transmission of the disease from 40 percent to 5 percent.

02:15:40.865 --> 02:15:48.107
So this is what this money that's been put in the Global Fund, PETFAR, is really making a difference in some of these countries.

02:15:49.807 --> 02:16:03.938
The situation in southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia, these are countries that have very high prevalence and it's going to take a lot to turn around the AIDS pandemic.

02:16:04.038 --> 02:16:07.581
Charlie, the whole history of this is that on this also,

02:16:09.162 --> 02:16:14.327
Every single thing that's been tried before it was tried, it was claimed that it would be impossible.

02:16:15.188 --> 02:16:20.833
Every time we've gone ahead and done something, it's turned out to go much better than was predicted.

02:16:20.853 --> 02:16:21.754
What's the best example of that?

02:16:21.934 --> 02:16:29.301
Well, whether it's getting antiretrovirals out, or whether it's getting the bed nets out, or whether it's getting the vaccine coverage.

02:16:29.982 --> 02:16:34.807
And when the smallpox eradication effort was first proposed,

02:16:35.347 --> 02:16:37.808
Most people said, no way, no chance.

02:16:38.488 --> 02:16:40.969
Actually, the United States government wasn't even in favor of it.

02:16:41.029 --> 02:16:45.211
It turned out it took a lot of pulling and pressure to get that done.

02:16:45.251 --> 02:16:46.731
And then it worked.

02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:53.594
And it was a vote of just two votes at the World Health Assembly, so-called, which said, OK, we'll try it.

02:16:54.074 --> 02:16:57.675
And it turned out to work in this wondrous way.

02:16:58.376 --> 02:17:01.277
So the lessons of public health are that

02:17:02.077 --> 02:17:10.105
These techniques are very powerful and very effective, even in places that are extremely poor.

02:17:10.625 --> 02:17:16.051
And the problem has been just getting ourselves motivated and organized to do it.

02:17:16.587 --> 02:17:22.711
Just back to AIDS briefly, because I mean, what can we say about certain problems on the ground?

02:17:22.751 --> 02:17:29.356
I mean, South Africa, I mean, there's this resistance to treatment in other countries.

02:17:29.396 --> 02:17:36.601
Remember, remember that the first president of Rockefeller University was Joshua Lederberg.

02:17:36.661 --> 02:17:38.783
And the next one was David Rockefeller.

02:17:38.923 --> 02:17:41.645
And the one in this video is Paul Nurse.

02:17:44.159 --> 02:17:46.661
a yeast molecular biologist.

02:17:50.805 --> 02:17:52.606
Why is there such a variety of approaches here?

02:17:52.626 --> 02:17:54.768
Leadership plays a huge role.

02:17:55.108 --> 02:18:03.295
And here's this very odd phenomenon that President Mbeki of South Africa for a long time was in denial.

02:18:04.096 --> 02:18:10.701
And his health minister, even worse, peddling garlic rather than antiretrovirals as a solution.

02:18:10.781 --> 02:18:11.442
So it was

02:18:13.423 --> 02:18:17.965
absolutely unaccountable how badly it was handled by that government.

02:18:19.166 --> 02:18:27.949
Contrary-wise, in Uganda, just like you said, President Museveni sounded the alarm and said, everybody has to know, and got some tremendous things going.

02:18:27.989 --> 02:18:36.473
So leadership played a huge role in Botswana, which was so hard hit because of its large migrant population and mining population.

02:18:37.273 --> 02:18:42.120
The former president Mohai and current president have been completely dedicated to this.

02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.523
So you need that kind of leadership.

02:18:44.563 --> 02:18:52.152
But the notable thing in Africa right now is how many places there are with good strong leadership that are saying we'll take this on.

02:18:52.473 --> 02:18:54.155
Give us a hand and help us do it.

02:18:54.195 --> 02:18:55.617
But we will take this on.

02:18:55.697 --> 02:19:01.863
Something that we can't ignore in the solution for global health problems is the importance of the multinational drug companies.

02:19:02.304 --> 02:19:06.408
At least in my field, I can tell you that the drug companies are actually the good guys in this.

02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:16.498
The reason we can give that rapid impact package of deworming drugs for 50 cents a person per year is because Pfizer is donating the Zithromax

02:19:17.319 --> 02:19:19.440
Merck is donating the Mectizan.

02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:22.100
Johnson & Johnson is donating the Mibendazole.

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.301
GSK is donating the L-Bendazole.

02:19:25.141 --> 02:19:27.902
We don't have all of the drugs donated, but it's making a huge difference.

02:19:27.922 --> 02:19:30.383
So we don't have to even worry about the cost of the drugs.

02:19:30.463 --> 02:19:32.163
I guarantee you they're writing it off.

02:19:32.463 --> 02:19:33.324
It's the delivery.

02:19:33.844 --> 02:19:41.006
If we can take that model of the drug companies really stepping up to the plate and helping with these neglected tropical diseases, these deworming drugs.

02:19:41.186 --> 02:19:43.267
The drug companies are the good guys now.

02:19:43.327 --> 02:19:44.487
You understand that, right?

02:19:44.547 --> 02:19:49.289
Robert Malone wants you to believe that it was the DoD that worked behind the drug company.

02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:50.709
The drug companies didn't do anything.

02:19:50.729 --> 02:19:53.230
Pfizer and BioNTech didn't do anything.

02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:55.891
None of these companies did anything.

02:19:55.911 --> 02:19:56.851
It was the DoD.

02:19:56.911 --> 02:20:03.973
Just ask all these people who are currently trying to run Trojan horse operations into the Trump administration.

02:20:04.013 --> 02:20:04.834
They all believe it.

02:20:05.554 --> 02:20:08.475
That the DoD is a specific enough accusation.

02:20:13.154 --> 02:20:16.698
for other diseases as well, that's going to take us a long way.

02:20:18.219 --> 02:20:23.985
Is there something that will be on the horizon again, this is my journalistic obsession, that we don't know about?

02:20:24.025 --> 02:20:29.871
I mean, one thing we haven't factored in here is population as an issue and how that, when we talked about environment, we talked about

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:31.623
the combination of poverty.

02:20:31.643 --> 02:20:36.665
But is there something else going on out there that we're just beginning to get a little sniffling of?

02:20:36.865 --> 02:20:37.105
Yes.

02:20:37.405 --> 02:20:37.705
What is it?

02:20:38.506 --> 02:20:41.807
Actually, first of all, is there something going on that we don't know about?

02:20:42.087 --> 02:20:44.488
Surely, is the first answer.

02:20:44.688 --> 02:20:50.631
First, because of the pressures of humans on the environment all over the world, we're seeing a lot of new diseases.

02:20:51.271 --> 02:20:56.395
because people are coming into contact with animal reservoirs of disease that they never did before.

02:20:56.976 --> 02:21:04.402
If the COVID hoax is a military operation, at the top of the military is the executive branch of the government.

02:21:06.536 --> 02:21:13.380
And so to blame the military is to blame the people that followed the orders instead of the people that gave the orders.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:28.570
If the orders were given by DITRA, if the orders were given by DITRA and the State Department, if the orders were given by the office of the ASPR or the head of Health and Human Services or some person adjacent to the president,

02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:33.533
then the people that follow the orders aren't necessarily the ones we need to go after.

02:21:33.633 --> 02:21:39.457
I guess you could say that a soldier shouldn't follow immoral orders, but could they?

02:21:39.517 --> 02:21:39.717
No.

02:21:41.238 --> 02:21:49.783
If there was an illusion of consensus above them and the executive branch about what was going on and what information that we had, could the DOD really be blamed?

02:21:50.984 --> 02:21:56.748
If the fire alarm gets pulled, is the DOD supposed to question who pulled the fire alarm or are they supposed to just respond?

02:21:58.493 --> 02:22:08.920
Because I find this a very disingenuous argument that automatically takes all of the blame away from the people who were elected to run the government.

02:22:10.781 --> 02:22:17.866
And the DOD is supposed to take orders from the people who are elected to run the government.

02:22:20.287 --> 02:22:27.233
And so it's okay to say that it's a military operation, but don't tell me that the military did it on their own because that's called a coup.

02:22:27.934 --> 02:22:29.135
And this is not a coup.

02:22:29.155 --> 02:22:39.924
This is a national security operation run by the highest levels of the intelligence agency, the intelligence community, the executive branch.

02:22:41.726 --> 02:22:47.451
And so anybody that tells you it was DOD is not blaming the people who told the DOD go.

02:22:50.359 --> 02:22:51.680
That's why I find it a problem.

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:58.663
These are being transmitted in new ways, whether it's avian flu or SARS or many.

02:22:58.743 --> 02:23:00.864
Avian flu or SARS.

02:23:00.904 --> 02:23:02.565
You see, the playbook is all there.

02:23:02.625 --> 02:23:03.886
The playbook is all ready.

02:23:04.026 --> 02:23:16.652
It is the semantic war and the enchantment using semantics that wasn't in place in 2007, that was still being put in place, worked on, massaged to be accepted.

02:23:17.597 --> 02:23:28.861
at the same time that social media was becoming an ever more important aspect of our lives as more and more military algorithms were rolled out as social media platforms.

02:23:33.923 --> 02:23:37.847
us certainly, but it's affecting also the developing world in a shocking way.

02:23:38.388 --> 02:23:47.438
And that is the non-infectious diseases, the so-called non-communicable diseases, notably the lifestyle of chronic diseases.

02:23:47.958 --> 02:23:49.800
Finally, chronic diseases came up.

02:23:50.794 --> 02:23:56.296
urban, a little bit couch potato, with fast food reaching the world.

02:23:56.436 --> 02:24:06.879
And something unbelievable is happening right now, which is that there is an epidemic of adult-onset diabetes, even in the very poor places.

02:24:07.039 --> 02:24:08.440
And this is a big shock.

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.200
It's not infection.

02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:15.242
It's the way people are eating, what happens to sedentary lifestyles.

02:24:15.902 --> 02:24:21.406
There's no end to the problems exactly, but there are huge gains that can be made.

02:24:21.926 --> 02:24:28.210
But you do get the idea, you cross one mountain pass, we'll see other challenges ahead, no question about it.

02:24:28.571 --> 02:24:36.156
But let's take on these millions of lives that can be saved now, because it's right in front of us something that can be accomplished now.

02:24:37.352 --> 02:24:44.697
I think one of the things we haven't talked about this evening in the discussion of global health is the importance of nutrition.

02:24:45.738 --> 02:24:55.185
About 50% of the child deaths under five, a contributing cause is lack of nutrition or malnutrition.

02:24:55.785 --> 02:24:59.508
So that if you have malaria and you're undernourished, you're more likely to die.

02:25:00.248 --> 02:25:03.491
And I think nutrition is a key part of global health.

02:25:03.711 --> 02:25:15.202
But today, we're also not only dealing with the issues of undernutrition, and there's some very exciting new kinds of products in development, like ready-to-use therapeutic foods that are having a dramatic impact.

02:25:16.724 --> 02:25:19.386
But also, there is this issue of overnutrition.

02:25:19.466 --> 02:25:23.450
And it is hitting the developing world in quite a big way.

02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:24.831
In some places, yeah, in the urban centers.

02:25:24.871 --> 02:25:25.072
Yeah.

02:25:25.752 --> 02:25:35.878
In the richer countries, for example in Botswana, I spent many years on the ground in Botswana and you know HIV AIDS is a problem but we started to see chronic disease affecting people as well.

02:25:36.218 --> 02:25:43.321
You know as soon as those people who made it through the 30s and 40s start having a whole different disease.

02:25:43.341 --> 02:25:45.963
So somebody watching and listening to this right now should take away

02:25:47.875 --> 02:25:55.362
Well, you know, I'm curiously... Let's let the yeast molecular biologists summarize this wonderful discussion, shall we?

02:25:56.482 --> 02:25:59.524
in the most enticing English accent he can muster.

02:26:00.065 --> 02:26:04.508
Optimistic, given the, I mean, the size of this problem.

02:26:04.668 --> 02:26:10.513
I mean, what I think I've heard this evening is, I mean, I think, firstly, this problem is being taken seriously.

02:26:10.533 --> 02:26:11.974
I mean, it's being talked about seriously.

02:26:11.994 --> 02:26:17.578
And I don't think it was, perhaps even 10 years ago, and certainly for a decade or two before that.

02:26:17.998 --> 02:26:20.880
Secondly, I'm hearing there's real resources out there.

02:26:21.761 --> 02:26:26.142
Interestingly, I think these philanthropic sources are extraordinary.

02:26:26.242 --> 02:26:27.542
And I get that everywhere.

02:26:27.562 --> 02:26:31.383
In my university at Rockefeller, donors want to give to this.

02:26:31.443 --> 02:26:34.744
And of course, we have the wonderful Gates Foundation.

02:26:35.064 --> 02:26:36.004
So there are resources.

02:26:36.024 --> 02:26:41.105
And I think countries, developed countries, governments are thinking about this too.

02:26:41.665 --> 02:26:44.886
The third thing I've heard is that some of the solutions seem to be pretty simple.

02:26:45.586 --> 02:26:47.669
and we just have to get on and actually do it.

02:26:47.689 --> 02:26:51.092
It's a question of organisation, implementation and leadership.

02:26:51.132 --> 02:26:53.595
That really seems to be the key factor, leadership.

02:26:53.936 --> 02:26:59.562
And the final thing is that there is some science to be done, and we've heard a bit about that, but it sounds doable.

02:26:59.903 --> 02:27:01.184
I'm coming out pretty optimistic.

02:27:01.464 --> 02:27:01.785
Thank you.

02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:06.916
Optimism is a word I'd like to end on here, if I may.

02:27:07.316 --> 02:27:20.454
My thanks to Peter, the president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Tanya Villafana, the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, Anne Veneman, the executive director of UNICEF, and Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia, and Sir Paul Nurse, my colleague.

02:27:20.954 --> 02:27:22.814
on all of these scientific inquiries.

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:23.855
I thank you, my friend.

02:27:23.895 --> 02:27:25.115
I thank all of you for joining us.

02:27:25.535 --> 02:27:28.635
And we thank you for sharing this time with us, and we'll see you next time.

02:27:29.215 --> 02:27:30.536
Wow, that was extraordinary.

02:27:30.876 --> 02:27:31.376
I loved it.

02:27:31.996 --> 02:27:36.137
Thank you very much to Mark Kulak for pointing that out to me.

02:27:36.157 --> 02:27:43.598
You can find the original link at charlierose.com slash videos slash 18317.

02:27:43.738 --> 02:27:45.678
You can see it right there.

02:27:45.758 --> 02:27:46.158
And yeah, that's...

02:27:51.184 --> 02:28:16.407
that was what my plan was um i didn't have anything else planned for this particular day again remember you can also find this little article of his um isn't it scrolling on here uh where he's talking about the wee beasties and how he discovered them and how it was serendipity and how he's not really that bright of a guy but somehow or another we have him on charlie rose

02:28:18.303 --> 02:28:20.145
It's a long time after this, right?

02:28:20.966 --> 02:28:27.954
He's on Charlie Rose as an expert on world governance, on epidemics, on infectious disease.

02:28:28.455 --> 02:28:39.487
He's co-hosting and moderating a discussion about something that he probably doesn't know anything relevant about because again, he's so old and his science was so basic.

02:28:40.930 --> 02:28:48.533
I mean, it's like getting a nature paper for cloning a G-protein coupled receptor or something like that.

02:28:48.754 --> 02:28:52.195
That went fine in the 80s, but you wouldn't get that nature paper now.

02:28:53.156 --> 02:28:54.376
This discovery is silly.

02:28:55.737 --> 02:29:00.359
Finding a homologue from a yeast gene to a human gene is silly.

02:29:01.527 --> 02:29:13.437
But it was a very big deal back then because it was the way they wanted to codify this ideology where understanding genes in one organism allows you to understand another organism.

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:32.748
And so understanding genes also allows you to understand the whole pattern integrity and they need our children to believe that or our children will not give up their children's genetics and their children's molecular data to these people who need it or claim that they have some use for it.

02:29:34.062 --> 02:29:35.443
I think that guy's playing for them.

02:29:36.124 --> 02:29:43.449
I think he's just probably a useless idiot playing for them, but nevertheless, I think he's playing for them.

02:29:43.589 --> 02:30:01.522
Ladies and gentlemen, we need a new consensus about transfection in healthy humans being always criminally negligent, that RNA cannot pandemic, and that the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise, and definitely they would murder and lie people, lie about it in order to cover these things up,

02:30:02.262 --> 02:30:16.916
make sure that our children believe that RNA can pandemic, to make sure that our children grow up believing that the vaccine schedule is somehow magic, and grow up believing that transfection is such a beautiful new technology and it saved millions of people.

02:30:17.476 --> 02:30:21.600
They murdered people and lied about it in order to accomplish that goal.

02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:34.105
And I believe Robert Malone is just as guilty of it as Meryl Nass is just as guilty of it as Tony Fauci is just as guilty as Peter Daszak, just as guilty as all of these other people including Kevin McKernan.

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.886
They're all part of the same crew.

02:30:36.926 --> 02:30:38.947
And if you don't figure it out soon,

02:30:40.968 --> 02:30:42.429
your kids are going to be enslaved.

02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:48.314
Ladies and gentlemen, if you liked what you saw, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support my work.

02:30:49.735 --> 02:31:03.026
If you want to share the stream, please share it at stream.gigaohm.bio because there are no algorithms, no logins, no other ways for you to get distracted by what YouTube or some other channel like Rumble wants you to see.

02:31:03.887 --> 02:31:04.968
Thanks very much for being here.

02:31:04.988 --> 02:31:06.049
I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

02:31:13.695 --> 02:31:15.036
Let's get a Ruby update in here.

02:31:15.076 --> 02:31:15.496
Ruby!

02:31:16.876 --> 02:31:17.977
Ruby, are you out there?

02:31:18.037 --> 02:31:18.717
Ruby, come here!

02:31:22.299 --> 02:31:22.599
I don't know.

02:31:22.639 --> 02:31:25.740
She might not be in the garage, in which case she's not going to come when I call her.

02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:27.561
But Ruby's doing fine.

02:31:27.601 --> 02:31:29.662
She's on her second day of injections.

02:31:30.778 --> 02:31:33.320
Um, which means that she's digging more holes.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.063
Um, she's essentially thinks she's about to give birth.

02:31:37.203 --> 02:31:39.524
So she's doing things that jive with that.

02:31:39.584 --> 02:31:40.825
She doesn't want to walk anymore.

02:31:40.965 --> 02:31:41.826
She wants to stay home.

02:31:42.646 --> 02:31:45.028
Um, it's not causing diarrhea or vomiting.

02:31:45.048 --> 02:31:47.270
Um, tomorrow's supposed to be the high dose.

02:31:47.950 --> 02:32:11.719
so we'll see but it is causing drooling and it's causing her to dig holes and then laying them which she doesn't normally do which is kind of cute but i think it also is causing her a lot of cramping and stuff and so she's a little she's a little tenuous but she's doing well and and we're all very happy here thanks for being here guys see you tomorrow

02:32:26.772 --> 02:32:27.853
Thanks, Jeff from Earth.

02:32:27.953 --> 02:32:29.554
Thank you very much, Jeff from Earth.

02:32:30.355 --> 02:32:32.176
Please follow Jeff from Earth.

02:32:33.337 --> 02:32:34.238
He does great work.

02:32:35.198 --> 02:32:40.022
And the clips are really, really, they're annoying a lot of people, I can tell.

02:32:40.082 --> 02:32:41.623
So keep working, Jeff.

02:32:41.663 --> 02:32:42.484
Love you very much.

02:32:42.564 --> 02:32:50.250
And not to mention that Jeff actually supports this stream, him and Kara, with donations that are not small.

02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:53.472
So Jeff is a real dude.

02:32:54.693 --> 02:32:55.533
Jeff's a real dude.

02:32:56.505 --> 02:32:58.089
And my family owes them a lot.

02:32:58.690 --> 02:33:00.534
So thanks for making it possible, Jeff.
