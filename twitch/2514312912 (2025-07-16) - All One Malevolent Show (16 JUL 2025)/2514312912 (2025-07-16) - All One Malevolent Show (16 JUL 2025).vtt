01:45.216 --> 01:50.762
The Lancet letter to censor anyone on social media who mentioned the possibility of a lab leak.

01:51.263 --> 01:51.843
It can't be true.

01:51.884 --> 01:53.105
The Lancet says it's not true.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.708
27 eminent scientists say it's not true.

01:57.049 --> 01:59.732
Only a few scientists in the face of all of this dare to speak up.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.287
One of them was called Gilles Dumeneuve.

02:02.808 --> 02:05.129
He formed a group of researchers called DRASTIC.

02:05.249 --> 02:10.213
That's an acronym for Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team, something that all scientists should be.

02:10.994 --> 02:13.676
Jamie Metzl, the former NSC official, soon joined the group.

02:14.296 --> 02:21.762
Almost immediately, as early as April of last year, it was becoming clear to Metzl that the lab leak theory was not a conspiracy theory.

02:21.782 --> 02:22.883
In fact, it was plausible.

02:24.318 --> 02:34.021
I think that if I had to just bet based on what I've read and logic, I would bet it's most likely this was an accidental leak from the alarm.

02:36.922 --> 02:40.143
So it turns out that Metzl wasn't exactly speculating on that.

02:40.743 --> 02:45.644
Unlike the scientific establishment, he and Drastic had evidence that they had bothered to gather.

02:46.265 --> 02:50.886
They found that the official scientific consensus had in fact been doctored at the source.

02:53.843 --> 02:56.904
It's just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

02:56.924 --> 03:01.866
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:03.527 --> 03:05.048
It's like a marble statue.

03:05.188 --> 03:09.249
Problem with experts even when they're, you know, the good guys.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.431
She's literally trying to raise a smile there.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.122
Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole.

03:20.182 --> 03:21.242
I think of them as good guys.

03:21.262 --> 03:22.943
They've been always outspoken about this.

03:23.603 --> 03:29.865
The problem with experts, once they have the area of expertise, they are afraid of stepping out of it.

03:30.045 --> 03:34.047
And this problem requires interdisciplinary approach.

03:34.067 --> 03:41.690
You have to build on not just on your knowledge as a biologist, but they are focused on this mRNA aspect of it.

03:42.870 --> 03:49.555
But we're saying there are these other aspects such as electrical engineering, you know, we have some electrical engineers in our group, right?

03:49.715 --> 03:50.495
The spitter.

03:50.635 --> 03:52.517
I even reached the spitter.

03:52.537 --> 03:53.077
Yanovits.

03:53.277 --> 03:54.638
Yanovits, the spitter.

03:54.698 --> 03:57.300
I absolutely want to find that.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.180
They're in the chat.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.761
I'm trying to find the spitter, dude.

03:59.801 --> 04:07.647
We reached out to telecommunications experts to try to understand, you know, these structures when they assemble, what would be the purpose with the material.

04:07.807 --> 04:09.168
And there are some really good

04:11.304 --> 04:15.207
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:17.008 --> 04:17.729
And I have lied.

04:17.929 --> 04:18.770
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.730
I don't want to lie.

04:20.211 --> 04:21.572
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:21.672 --> 04:22.713
I try not to be a liar.

04:22.733 --> 04:23.593
I don't want to be a liar.

04:24.154 --> 04:26.856
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:32.495 --> 04:34.677
Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

04:35.238 --> 04:37.019
This guy's been talked about for years.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.583
You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things.

04:42.925 --> 04:45.627
And are people still talking about this guy, this creep?

04:46.788 --> 04:48.970
Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

04:49.510 --> 04:49.851
This guy's...

04:57.987 --> 04:59.569
I think truth is good for kids.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.835
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

05:04.295 --> 05:05.918
We want everybody to feel good.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.261
That's not the way life is.

05:42.998 --> 05:44.239
I don't care how you get there.

05:44.259 --> 05:46.920
I don't care what you do to get there.

05:46.940 --> 05:53.462
The goal is to win.

05:54.262 --> 05:55.183
What time is it?

05:55.383 --> 05:55.983
Game time!

06:02.948 --> 06:23.037
Yeah, Mark's Mark's work from the past couple days my stream yesterday was a little bit unhinged But it needed to be at some point people Need to see what it really feels like to be the victim of so many lies of so many Coordinated liars.

06:23.097 --> 06:23.818
That's the trick.

06:23.858 --> 06:25.819
That's what makes it so aggravating

06:26.659 --> 06:28.881
is that they are not serious people.

06:28.961 --> 06:29.982
They are being paid.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.184
They are being paid to mislead.

06:32.704 --> 06:37.769
They are being paid to distract and occupy the attention of people on social media.

06:37.789 --> 06:44.615
And I thought for a long time that if I just made the right stream and tweeted it to the right people that something would happen.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.297
And that's really the illusion of social media.

06:47.337 --> 06:49.919
The only way to do it is to get off.

06:50.776 --> 07:05.684
If you want to drop a bomb at your next barbecue, please tell everybody that autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

07:07.165 --> 07:12.267
Pandemics and gain of function are also myths used to make sure the same things are never questioned.

07:12.727 --> 07:16.888
That's really the trap that we are in and social media is used to enforce it.

07:16.928 --> 07:18.148
It's the walls of the trap.

07:18.709 --> 07:23.050
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free there, then you'll never be able to escape.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.870
That's really the end of it.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.871
If you want to leave a voicemail, there's a number there in the bottom left.

07:28.371 --> 07:46.416
If you want to send a self-addressed stamped envelope to my house so that you can get a sticker or a velcro-backed tactical patch saying that GigaOM Biological Biology is the way, please send a self-addressed stamped envelope to that address in the upper right corner.

07:47.296 --> 08:01.799
Ladies and gentlemen, we are almost at the six year anniversary of the 19th of July 2020 when I first went in my backyard at my house that I lost as a result of losing my job, a great house on a hill with three acres and woods.

08:03.479 --> 08:15.682
When I understood that they were misconstruing a background with spread, and I didn't have all the details necessarily right, but I was definitely explaining the idea that there were signals in the background.

08:16.513 --> 08:22.315
that virology at the time would have called endemic, but these endemic signals were being misconstrued as spread.

08:22.915 --> 08:26.817
And the word endemic is also, of course, a myth that I've only recently realized.

08:26.837 --> 08:33.039
I just wanted to give you another substack.com slash at Scottish COVID inquiry.

08:33.079 --> 08:36.800
So you have the other web address for them.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.021
Why is that not starting?

08:40.101 --> 08:42.382
Play, something's not happening.

08:45.336 --> 08:46.457
It's not making any noise.

08:46.917 --> 08:47.397
Oh, there it is.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.759
I had that volume all the way down for some reason.

08:50.779 --> 08:51.519
Why did I do that?

08:52.680 --> 08:55.462
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm really happy to be here.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.384
Really, really happy to be here.

09:01.269 --> 09:02.530
It's been a long day.

09:02.550 --> 09:05.332
It's hard for me to catch up sometimes.

09:05.352 --> 09:13.859
I might have to be a little bit honest as I continue to focus on the biology and not take the bait on social media, trying to love my neighbors.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.161
I'm doing it by myself right now.

09:18.622 --> 09:21.745
I don't know if there are that many people that are aware.

09:24.007 --> 09:26.689
I presume that all of my antagonists are aware.

09:28.894 --> 09:39.925
Staying focused on the biology is harder when you're living all by yourself with two dogs and some fish and some chickens, which is what I've been doing for the last week and a half or so.

09:42.568 --> 09:45.090
And so it's been a little harder to stay focused on the stream.

09:45.936 --> 09:49.299
because I have so much more to do in the background, including feeding myself.

09:51.061 --> 10:04.634
I know that sounds a little ridiculous, but my wife is an excellent facilitator of this stream, and without my wife here in the background, I need to regularly set an alarm or something, because otherwise it'll be six in the evening and I won't have eaten breakfast.

10:06.256 --> 10:13.502
And it just has to do with the fact that there's another thing to do and another thing to do because so many things are done by her.

10:13.562 --> 10:20.228
And I always have a little hard time transitioning into this living alone situation.

10:21.569 --> 10:23.170
My family has gone to the Netherlands.

10:23.210 --> 10:31.415
Ladies and gentlemen, the way this works is that financially, the stream is supported 100% by people who watch and share the work.

10:32.396 --> 10:36.659
And more importantly, it's supported because people share and spread the word each week.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.800
That's what I need more people to do.

10:38.820 --> 10:44.744
I got people like Jeff from Earth populating a very nice Instagram that you can share.

10:45.504 --> 10:55.586
I've got some shorts that are being cut by Jeff from Earth that he's sharing on Instagram, but also posting on Peertube, which is actually something I'm going to show you in a minute.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.384
Um, and then, uh, let me see.

10:59.404 --> 11:05.290
Yeah, so, you gotta spread the word, um, and we do have a website, gigombiological.com.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.994
I know it's not the best name, but it's, it's the one that I'm working with.

11:09.655 --> 11:13.058
You can see there, scrolling in the middle, pure oxygen kills.

11:13.178 --> 11:15.661
Intramuscular injection for healthy people is dumb.

11:16.462 --> 11:17.643
RNA cannot pandemic.

11:17.663 --> 11:19.425
You see, there's no other website.

11:20.846 --> 11:43.495
Yeah, my throat's a little bad There's no other website on on earth really that tells you those truths right up on the for page You're gonna scroll down and find ways to support or or get an email notice you can also find that link stuff up there in the corner and That will allow you to don't download some of the stuff that we've worked on before and we'll download You'll be able to download things in the future as well there I

11:46.016 --> 11:46.977
Let me drink something here.

11:47.557 --> 11:51.160
My throat is a little tired, but I'm not really sure from what.

11:56.504 --> 11:58.005
Yesterday's stream was three hours.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.787
I just got done uploading and transcoding a new version of it.

12:02.688 --> 12:06.771
Because PeerTube was unable to handle that three hour thing for some reason.

12:06.831 --> 12:07.351
I don't know why.

12:07.411 --> 12:08.512
Sometimes it just doesn't work.

12:09.673 --> 12:11.314
Let me transition over to the bridge here.

12:14.965 --> 12:17.568
Sometimes the peer tube doesn't pick up the whole thing.

12:17.608 --> 12:18.628
Yesterday it dropped a few.

12:18.648 --> 12:19.389
Hey, sorry.

12:19.709 --> 12:25.154
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey, Chief Biologist at Gingholm Biological, coming to you live from the back of my garage.

12:25.174 --> 12:25.794
Good to see you.

12:26.675 --> 12:28.997
My family is visiting grandma in the Netherlands.

12:29.677 --> 12:33.400
My three kids and wife left about a week and a half ago.

12:34.381 --> 12:46.724
And so I've been fending for myself, basically hunting and gathering in the wilds of Pittsburgh and trying to find a shower every six or seven days, which means I'm probably due for one now.

12:48.305 --> 12:51.886
I've been trying to get to the gym as often as possible, but some things just fall off.

12:52.824 --> 12:53.524
Wow, that's loud.

12:54.005 --> 12:57.626
Some things just fall off the ship every day.

12:57.866 --> 13:06.930
And so this coming online at 5 o'clock is one of those things where things just didn't get started early enough in this room.

13:07.951 --> 13:10.132
And so I didn't get to the end point quick enough.

13:10.152 --> 13:12.713
And I've been goofing around with a few of these things.

13:14.073 --> 13:19.956
Yes, yay, summer trip to visit grandma indeed is probably all I really do this for other than paying the bills.

13:20.636 --> 13:25.921
It's like the one thing that we maxed out our credit card this year to do it.

13:25.942 --> 13:27.103
You want to hear the honest truth?

13:27.143 --> 13:27.763
That's what it is.

13:27.803 --> 13:30.646
The honest truth is we don't have a very good credit rating.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.188
We don't have very deep credit cards.

13:32.668 --> 13:35.531
And we maxed one of them out for them to go to the Netherlands.

13:35.571 --> 13:37.993
So I need to do some more work.

13:38.053 --> 13:39.214
I don't know what's wrong with my throat.

13:40.235 --> 13:53.125
I need to somehow or another justify all this support that I get, wink wink, but no seriously I am thankful for the people who do support because they do get me across the finish line just barely every month.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.867
I'm just kind of thinking how easy

13:57.728 --> 14:01.729
It appears to be on the internet to have, say, 5,000 subscribers.

14:01.769 --> 14:09.452
If I had 5,000 people giving me $10 a month, my God, what I would do with that.

14:10.312 --> 14:11.932
Number one, I would have billboards.

14:12.112 --> 14:16.314
Number two, I would have really cheap, you know, can a nonprofit help?

14:16.394 --> 14:19.334
Yes, but I don't have a lawyer to help me do it.

14:19.394 --> 14:24.356
And in fact, three lawyers so far in Pittsburgh have said they would help and then vanished.

14:25.543 --> 14:32.725
And I don't know how to explain it any other way than maybe they're monitoring my phone or my emails or something and encouraging these people to stay away from me.

14:33.865 --> 14:46.648
But usually what's really weird is that when I have these talks with these people, one time even in person, with a book in my hand, they are actually pretty intrigued by the fact that I've written a book with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:46.688 --> 14:47.788
and listed as an expert.

14:48.428 --> 14:58.076
They are pretty intrigued by the fact that I used to work for Children's Health Defense, his former non-profit now run by who I would call one of the worst traitors in America, Mary Holland.

14:59.698 --> 15:04.242
But at some point, yeah, I don't know.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.743
It's trouble.

15:06.003 --> 15:06.503
It's trouble.

15:06.824 --> 15:07.624
We just have to...

15:08.703 --> 15:10.924
I just have to figure out a way to do this better.

15:10.964 --> 15:12.705
But this is definitely for all the marbles.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.085
This is for the grandchildren of earth.

15:14.105 --> 15:14.986
So this ain't stopping.

15:15.006 --> 15:15.686
I'm not quitting.

15:16.406 --> 15:21.428
I just don't think getting a job, you know, like at Chick-fil-A or something like that is going to solve the problem.

15:21.448 --> 15:25.770
I'm not going to have enough time to do the stream then because it does take a lot of preparation.

15:26.090 --> 15:33.374
Um, it's not like I've just, you know, look at a bunch of stuff online and then grab two things and throw it into the slide deck and do a show.

15:34.174 --> 15:34.294
Um,

15:35.212 --> 15:38.476
It's tough to put the red line through the show every day.

15:38.496 --> 15:46.163
And it's tough to stay focused on the big pictures when social media is so pollutant to your head.

15:47.244 --> 15:50.087
I'm going to switch down again to the writing line here.

15:51.328 --> 15:53.931
This is about the future of the Human Genome Project.

15:53.951 --> 15:56.714
This is about ending the FDA because the FDA is in the way.

15:58.523 --> 16:04.788
this idea that they should regulate the contents of packages and the labels and the safe and effective statements.

16:05.869 --> 16:13.074
This has all got to go and that's one of the ongoing operations happening right now with the Trojan horse that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:13.114 --> 16:16.737
at HHS and this Marty McCary guy at the head of FDA.

16:18.203 --> 16:21.905
They are effectively taking all the teeth out of the FDA.

16:21.945 --> 16:34.612
And the reason why they were able to do it, the reason why we supported them being put into positions of power in relation to health and human services was because we were fooled into solving this mystery of the lab leak.

16:35.720 --> 16:52.407
Scooby-Doo is a cartoon from America where a bunch of teenagers go around and solve a mystery which inevitably ends up with the Unmasking of the bad guy who turns out to be just some dude from earlier in the story In a disguise who's trying to scare people away from the money.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.087
He's stealing.

16:53.127 --> 16:59.049
That's always what it is And in Scooby-Doo was also very sexist because there were never any bad girls.

16:59.109 --> 17:03.351
It was always bad guys Anyway

17:04.545 --> 17:13.373
I think it's useful to watch old videos.

17:14.054 --> 17:16.316
So Koninginnedag is Queen's Day.

17:17.357 --> 17:19.519
That would have, I think, been in April back then.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.141
They now have King's Day because that queen is gone.

17:23.403 --> 17:25.764
But in 2009, they still had Queen's Day.

17:26.385 --> 17:28.507
And although you don't understand Dutch, I do.

17:29.187 --> 17:34.311
And this guy is a dude who was on stage, actually, opposite of Mark Van Ronst.

17:34.832 --> 17:36.193
This guy is Osterhaus.

17:37.174 --> 17:42.118
And he is the postdoc supervisor of Ron Fauchier.

17:42.198 --> 17:48.523
Ron Fauchier is the guy who was really famous in 2012 for having enriched avian flu in ferrets and made it airborne.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.985
And of course, we've been talking about that guy for a long time.

17:52.045 --> 18:02.354
He's been in front of some of the same conferences that people like Ralph Baric and Mark Dennison and Tony Fauci have presented in front of.

18:02.414 --> 18:14.524
So this is the Dutch version of that where the Mexican flu in 2009 has supposedly landed in the Netherlands and a confirmed case has been reported and they celebrate it.

18:17.570 --> 18:19.671
Yeah, that was all fine.

18:20.091 --> 18:30.015
And the lady on the phone was that lady with the white hair who was on the Lancet Who committee and she's also Dutch and I'll come up with her name a little later.

18:31.095 --> 18:42.660
But she's also a virologist that works for the Who and she has white hair and her name is... Somebody probably already put it in the chat but I'll come up with it in a minute.

18:46.854 --> 18:47.014
Ciao!

18:59.965 --> 19:00.706
Come sit by us.

19:00.726 --> 19:02.306
Matrix is a PCR test and she's telling him what cycles it's at.

19:02.326 --> 19:02.306
23.

19:02.346 --> 19:03.227
23 cycles and it's in a kid, he says.

19:03.247 --> 19:05.868
A kid who came out of Mexico, back home from Mexico.

19:05.888 --> 19:06.248
How old is he?

19:27.808 --> 19:27.988
Okay.

19:28.268 --> 19:28.789
Ten years old.

19:28.809 --> 19:29.269
Marjan Koopmans.

19:29.289 --> 19:29.749
That's her name.

19:29.790 --> 19:30.430
He just said Marjan.

19:30.450 --> 19:31.170
Now I know her name.

19:31.351 --> 19:33.752
Marjan Koopmans is the lady that was on the phone.

19:33.772 --> 19:34.073
Positive.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.783
Knetter positive.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.986
Knetter positive is very positive, right?

19:51.046 --> 19:55.030
He's very excited, a very positive 23 cycle count.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.231
Where is this child?

20:03.867 --> 20:15.631
The RABN is the CDC of the Netherlands, or the NIH of the Netherlands.

20:15.651 --> 20:19.353
It's the Royal something of science.

20:19.893 --> 20:24.335
Now that means that we have the first case in Nederland.

20:24.375 --> 20:24.875
Oh boy, get the whiskey.

20:32.051 --> 20:33.592
No, I'm not.

20:33.612 --> 20:35.193
Okay, we'll figure that out tonight.

20:35.694 --> 20:36.615
All the fiancés are here.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.536
Last week, next Friday, always.

20:38.556 --> 20:40.778
Where's the bottle of whiskey?

20:40.818 --> 20:43.080
You asked the secretary for it.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.461
Do you want to ask if Loeb can bring the bottle?

20:44.521 --> 20:46.802
It's been five hours, so... The bottle, bring the bottle, please.

20:46.822 --> 20:47.423
Shall I join you?

20:47.523 --> 20:48.083
I'd like to have a drink.

20:48.103 --> 20:48.284
Me too.

20:48.304 --> 20:48.804
Okay, guys, cheers.

20:49.765 --> 20:49.965
Cheers.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.086
Gesundheit is health, of course, in German and in Dutch.

21:05.106 --> 21:08.069
34 million doses.

21:29.088 --> 21:33.631
34 million doses just got ordered and he got a text on his shit phone.

21:42.716 --> 21:44.036
I walked through those doors.

21:44.797 --> 21:45.917
I worked in that building.

21:47.438 --> 21:52.341
I worked in that building from 2012 to 2016, just five floors below that.

21:53.201 --> 21:56.263
Cause I think they're on the 17th floor and I was on the 14th floor.

21:59.045 --> 22:05.789
So that's why George Webb occasionally mentioned my name in the beginning and said that I worked at Erasmus, I must be a bad guy or some shit like that.

22:08.250 --> 22:17.155
Everything they've done has been done because I am one of the most inconvenient mother effers they never expected to be around.

22:19.957 --> 22:26.558
If you didn't see the very beginning of my show, the beginning is going to get better and better every single show from now on.

22:27.159 --> 22:30.599
Because this, this timeline is just so fricking compelling.

22:31.639 --> 22:33.060
It's all scripted bullshit.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.660
That was 2009 for the swine flu.

22:37.341 --> 22:41.782
So the price of synthesizing virus genomes get down to about five cents a base.

22:42.342 --> 22:48.423
This is 2013 and the famous Ralph Baric telling you the lie from, well not the lie, but the,

22:49.557 --> 23:04.647
the only thing that the Human Genome Project has accomplished is lowered the amount of money necessary to create large amounts of DNA or RNA and lowered the amounts of money necessary to sequence those large amounts of DNA and RNA.

23:05.347 --> 23:06.848
Make no mistake about it, right?

23:06.928 --> 23:17.815
Don't forget that the whole principle of sequencing actually requires you to make a lot of the sequence, right?

23:19.022 --> 23:21.304
They don't sequence any other way.

23:21.404 --> 23:25.868
If they use a millipore or a nanopore sequencer, then they get a very error prone sequence.

23:25.928 --> 23:27.269
It's not, nothing is determined.

23:27.329 --> 23:32.413
It's just all, it's all probabilistic and it's not very accurate.

23:32.433 --> 23:34.215
They get a different read every time they do it.

23:34.295 --> 23:45.184
But when you do traditional sequencing, what you do is you take something that you have only one copy of and you make so many copies of it that, that it's pure enough so that you can see the sequence.

23:46.817 --> 23:47.617
It's basically it.

23:47.677 --> 24:03.722
And so you take the long piece of DNA that you want to sequence and you fragment it into a bunch of smaller sequences that you can then grow using PCR into large quantities of pure of that sequence so that you can sequence each of those sequences.

24:03.762 --> 24:16.546
And then you hope that those sequences overlap in a, in a usefully self eliminating sort of way so that with relatively little problem, you can reassemble.

24:17.745 --> 24:19.114
That's how sequencing is done.

24:22.099 --> 24:32.846
And so what he's describing here is essentially the advancement of the technology at the heart of the Human Genome Project and telling you about where they are with regard to being able to do this stuff.

24:33.247 --> 24:43.073
And in the meantime, also telling you that the byproduct of this is that we have really fine-tuned the techniques to build recombinant synthetic sequences.

24:43.113 --> 24:47.917
And we can do it really, really cheap now, which means that we can transfect things.

24:49.431 --> 24:51.933
And that's indeed how virology is done.

24:51.973 --> 24:54.596
That's what gain of function viruses are.

24:54.676 --> 25:00.902
It's just the use of synthetic RNA and DNA in culture and in animals and calling that virology.

25:00.922 --> 25:11.432
And in reality, that's just some kind of human genome project spinoff where they're trying to figure out how genes and proteins and how DNA and RNA and proteins work.

25:11.733 --> 25:12.013
That's it.

25:15.619 --> 25:22.322
It's going to cost $1,500 to synthesize a coronavirus genome, which may scare the hell out of some of us.

25:23.062 --> 25:26.424
But it does allow us to ask those questions in an affordable manner.

25:30.846 --> 25:43.853
The other way to do it, even more cheaply, is to actually clone out the spike genes and make, in essence, recombinants where you drop the spike gene of different bat coronaviruses that you think may have appropriate properties that could be emergent

25:44.229 --> 25:51.074
pre-emergent strains and characterize their ability to replicate in human cells, both primary cells and other cells in culture.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.695
So those types of questions are doable.

25:54.416 --> 26:00.780
The spike, even the spike genome, for example, is only about 4 kb, so at 10 cents a base, it's a $400 experiment.

26:04.508 --> 26:07.349
Now, maybe dual use experiments are a concern.

26:07.529 --> 26:08.390
That's another issue.

26:09.290 --> 26:12.391
He's laughing about it because he knows it's a script that he's on.

26:12.451 --> 26:13.491
He's got to bring it up.

26:13.672 --> 26:14.732
It's the whole point.

26:14.752 --> 26:17.933
He knows that there are people in the audience that are scripted to bring it up.

26:18.013 --> 26:19.394
That's what you need to hear here.

26:22.625 --> 26:30.107
And so this scripted bullshit has gotten us into a pretty big problem in the United States, a pretty bad situation because these people aren't serious.

26:30.147 --> 26:34.208
They are paid influencers and they are governing us via social media.

26:34.268 --> 26:40.789
These two dipshits at the top of the FDA are governing us with this full, you know, look at what we're doing.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.150
Radical transparency, lots of podcasts.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.050
I'm really clever.

26:44.090 --> 26:45.350
I go on the news all the time.

26:45.811 --> 26:46.931
This is all bullshit.

26:47.371 --> 26:51.412
And the only way that we dispel this myth is to get off of social media ourselves.

26:52.725 --> 26:59.149
That's why we're here where there's this myth of endemicity laid down by people like Ralph Baric.

26:59.949 --> 27:03.131
They have that power because of our acquiescence to social media.

27:03.171 --> 27:11.135
Otherwise, by now, we would have figured out that endemicity is a myth, as both a process and as an endpoint.

27:11.816 --> 27:15.718
But instead, we have an NIH director who actively tweets

27:16.872 --> 27:30.437
goes on shitty podcasts and promotes Substack journalists repeatedly on both sides because he's paid to do that.

27:30.477 --> 27:44.382
He's paid to work on X. He's paid, he was paid, you know, before to be on Substack and he's doing it right now, paid to have one, paid to be on them because they want social media to become powerful in the,

27:46.434 --> 27:47.995
in the world, on the world stage.

27:48.035 --> 27:51.557
They want it to become relevant to politics, relevant to governance.

27:53.077 --> 27:59.380
And so these people were paid to perform on it and they are still being compensated for performing on it.

27:59.421 --> 28:01.742
They were promoted for performing on it.

28:01.782 --> 28:05.183
That's why these people apparently don't understand.

28:06.924 --> 28:14.008
They could not see that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality coming that could have bankrupt a lot of countries in the West.

28:14.909 --> 28:23.511
And that there might've been a reason for them to lie about something like a pandemic so that they could, you know, use manslaughter and lies to manage it.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.212
And this problem is not over.

28:26.272 --> 28:32.293
I think you can see that very clearly from the population pyramid that this problem is not over at all.

28:33.433 --> 28:39.535
This anticipated rise in all cause mortality is not going away and it's going to go up again, then down a little bit and then up again.

28:41.704 --> 28:49.747
Here's my question, how many additional physicians do we need to train to eliminate the primary care shortages and to get to the bare minimum?

28:50.007 --> 28:56.290
So we have a primary care shortage in America right now that apparently these people, this is a scripted shithead.

28:57.742 --> 29:02.403
And the reason why you know she's a scripted shithead is I want you to watch the guy in the blue suit and her.

29:02.903 --> 29:05.204
I want you to watch what she's reading.

29:05.324 --> 29:10.225
I want you to pay attention for the mistake that she makes, the correction that she makes.

29:10.285 --> 29:14.687
And at the very end of the interview, what she does when she looks at that guy to say, didn't I do okay?

29:14.747 --> 29:16.187
I made a little mistake there though.

29:17.087 --> 29:20.428
This is a theater being performed in Congress.

29:21.048 --> 29:25.790
And it's always been a theater, but we just didn't know for probably our whole lives.

29:28.352 --> 29:36.339
As I shared earlier, we are projecting that for primary care physicians, by 2037, we're facing a shortage of 87,000.

29:36.439 --> 29:40.183
So we would... We need 87,000 by 2037.

29:42.005 --> 29:46.349
And so that means... That sounds like a population pyramid problem to me.

29:46.409 --> 29:49.372
Like, you know, you're going to have so many people that need health care.

29:50.199 --> 29:55.061
Because we have such a large old population, aging, unwell population.

29:55.661 --> 29:56.102
Wow!

29:56.662 --> 29:58.703
It sounds like they can predict that shit!

29:59.883 --> 30:01.884
This is from frickin' today!

30:01.904 --> 30:04.105
In Congress, my friends.

30:04.265 --> 30:04.886
Today!

30:06.286 --> 30:07.467
We've got a lot of work to do.

30:08.072 --> 30:15.674
Now I want to talk about something that's becoming even more of an issue for me and most of the people on this subcommittee.

30:16.074 --> 30:25.376
We have an acute shortage of geriatricians now, which is alarming at how fast the population is aging.

30:26.076 --> 30:26.756
Is that correct?

30:28.816 --> 30:33.117
It's alarming at how quickly the population is aging?

30:33.757 --> 30:34.258
What's that?

30:35.598 --> 30:35.878
Really?

30:37.611 --> 30:38.532
Yes, that is correct.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.214
The population is aging.

30:41.895 --> 30:42.735
Is that correct?

30:43.916 --> 30:44.837
Yes, that is correct.

30:46.479 --> 30:46.759
Okay.

30:47.099 --> 30:51.803
And that's why Title VII includes programs for education and training in geriatrics.

30:51.823 --> 30:52.364
Is that right?

30:52.904 --> 30:53.224
It does.

30:53.985 --> 30:57.728
Now, the Title VII geriatrics program... She's just reading.

30:59.129 --> 31:01.031
It's a script on both sides of this, right?

31:01.051 --> 31:01.912
You understand that?

31:02.672 --> 31:04.254
That's how big a trouble we're in.

31:05.461 --> 31:14.709
support the career development of junior faculty in geriatrics, and they help train the primary care workforce on issues relating to aging, among other things.

31:14.769 --> 31:15.470
Is that right?

31:16.190 --> 31:18.532
Yes, that is correct.

31:18.693 --> 31:28.621
In the 2022-23 academic year, over 67,000 healthcare professionals, students, patients, and caregivers received training under the Title VII geriatrics programs.

31:28.701 --> 31:29.282
Is that right?

31:30.834 --> 31:32.416
I don't know the numbers off the top of my head.

31:32.436 --> 31:32.656
OK.

31:33.277 --> 31:38.222
Do you know how many people received the training in the 2023-24 year?

31:39.183 --> 31:42.886
It should likely be about the same.

31:43.327 --> 31:44.007
About the same.

31:44.148 --> 31:44.448
OK.

31:45.929 --> 31:47.351
So this year.

31:48.697 --> 32:03.364
the administration, instead of reporting those numbers in the fiscal year 26 congressional justification for HRSA, the administration instead proposed to eliminate Title VII geriatrics programs.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.946
And I think that's kind of the wrong way to go.

32:06.006 --> 32:08.387
I think Congress needs to double down on this work.

32:08.447 --> 32:14.230
So, Mr. Chairman, that's one thing I want to talk to you about is the geriatrics program.

32:16.704 --> 32:30.446
Year 22-23, 59% of the graduates who received one of the scholarships worked or trained in medically underserved communities one year after graduation, and 30% in primary care settings.

32:30.907 --> 32:40.068
So I want to ask you, Dr. Chen, are students who go to school with this kind of a scholarship more likely to work in a medically underserved area after graduation?

32:41.248 --> 32:44.669
We do find that across our programs that students that are supported by

32:45.707 --> 32:52.971
either our grant programs or our scholarship programs are more likely to practice in high needs specialties as well as.

32:53.191 --> 32:56.393
Yeah, I'm sorry, this is the scholarships for disadvantaged students program.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.614
I'm sorry, I apologize.

32:57.674 --> 32:58.554
I skipped a line.

32:59.055 --> 33:00.836
I skipped a line.

33:02.477 --> 33:04.458
I'm sorry, you're answering the wrong question.

33:04.538 --> 33:05.478
I skipped a line.

33:05.518 --> 33:10.381
Now when she yields the rest of her time back, watch what she looks at with this dude in the blue suit.

33:11.142 --> 33:13.383
These people are absolute shitheads.

33:15.714 --> 33:16.914
Yes, yes, absolutely.

33:16.974 --> 33:17.235
OK.

33:17.835 --> 33:23.777
And how many, have any scholarships for disadvantaged students grants been awarded this year?

33:25.337 --> 33:28.919
We did not award scholarship for disadvantaged grants.

33:28.979 --> 33:29.719
Why is that?

33:31.219 --> 33:34.200
We did have competitions that were canceled.

33:34.741 --> 33:38.022
And with those canceled competitions, we did not make it.

33:38.042 --> 33:39.962
Those were canceled by the Trump administration?

33:42.366 --> 33:47.970
Funding decisions were made across the administration between the agency, the department, OMB.

33:48.631 --> 33:49.171
And DOJ?

33:50.592 --> 33:52.774
I cannot speak to DOJ, but.

33:53.254 --> 33:53.334
OK.

33:53.354 --> 33:53.554
Thank you.

33:53.634 --> 33:54.695
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

33:54.715 --> 33:59.618
The gentlelady yields back, now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Guthrie, for his five minutes of questions.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.620
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank all of you being here.

34:01.980 --> 34:03.301
She smiled and smirked.

34:05.563 --> 34:06.844
She smiled and smirked.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.506
She's just a scripted idiot.

34:10.669 --> 34:19.755
And so many of these people I think are scripted idiots run by people behind them, by interests, by weaponized piles of money.

34:20.395 --> 34:26.339
But on social media, we have an especially nasty situation going on because there's no elections there.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.081
It's just fake programming.

34:30.702 --> 34:36.486
And so we're really supposed to believe that these people were not aware of an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

34:37.230 --> 34:49.318
We're supposed to be believing that people in government didn't see this graph displayed in this way and never saw that there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was coming for a couple decades.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.761
Ted Turner never did any TV programs about it.

34:53.801 --> 35:00.265
We've not been talking about the bankruptcy impending of the doom of Medicare and social security for nothing.

35:00.305 --> 35:01.986
We've been talking about it because of this.

35:03.462 --> 35:07.724
And this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality... We got some exclusive breaking news today.

35:08.464 --> 35:13.446
And it is... And we have Jay Bhattacharya going on shithead shows like this.

35:15.567 --> 35:19.588
Our NIH director is going on Real America's Voice.

35:21.789 --> 35:24.530
He should just be thrown out of office for this shit.

35:27.291 --> 35:31.873
I mean, at least the head of the FDA is doing his own podcast for shit's sake.

35:33.595 --> 35:36.423
paying some guy named Bigfoot to run the podcast.

35:36.483 --> 35:37.626
At least he's doing that.

35:39.560 --> 36:06.861
all my gosh jay bata chari is such a traitor from a great and such a fraud director of n i h jay bata charia our director great to see you thank you for taking the time i know you have some an announcement to share with the audience here please are the floors yours it's very important so i can make the front page in new york times but it shows how the administration is focused on real results that benefit the taxpayer and science please director bata charia

36:07.722 --> 36:11.645
Charlie, thank you for having me on the show and for giving me the floor to make this announcement.

36:11.685 --> 36:25.416
So one of the things that's sort of a little-known secret about scientific publishing is that when taxpayers pay for research, and they do, through the National Institute of Health, lots of great discoveries are made, you publish it in a scientific journal.

36:25.476 --> 36:35.885
Everyone has these ideas about scientific journals as if they're ways, like clean places where people can convey scientific ideas to other scientists, they're peer-reviewed, they vet truth.

36:36.465 --> 36:50.070
And, you know, some of that is true, but a lot of times the economics of the publishing of the scientific, you know, sort of the publishing industry is actually not so clean.

36:50.850 --> 37:02.635
And in particular, what happens, we just made an announcement a couple weeks ago, essentially saying that when an NIH-funded scientist publishes a paper in a scientific journal,

37:03.215 --> 37:07.478
That paper needs to be available to the entire public for free without any paywall.

37:08.358 --> 37:11.220
That happened, you know, a couple of weeks ago, we put that in place.

37:11.820 --> 37:15.222
Actually, I think it was July 1st, we put that in place.

37:15.823 --> 37:27.910
A lot of the industry, some of the industry responded by essentially by telling the scientists that they were going to charge the scientists for the privilege of publishing science in their journals.

37:28.410 --> 37:28.911
Think about that.

37:29.191 --> 37:37.562
I'm an author, I'm a scientist author, and I... So what you need to see is that there's no way in hell that this is the priority of the NIH director.

37:38.939 --> 37:39.539
Just no way.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.080
This is just stupid.

37:41.941 --> 37:43.982
This is the stupidest shit of stupid shit.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.884
And I was at several barbecues with this guy over the last five years.

37:49.524 --> 37:50.545
I've talked to him at length.

37:50.585 --> 37:53.707
I've had him on my podcast once on this show.

37:54.747 --> 37:55.908
This guy is a fraud.

37:56.748 --> 38:01.411
He's a kind of an imposter or a fraud or a, he's an actor.

38:02.311 --> 38:07.954
He's a scripted fraud and likely being scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

38:09.485 --> 38:37.306
I think that these people are all part of some kind of traitorous Trojan horse That more or less used Bobby Kennedy as a puppet and as a Truman show Bobby Kennedy Is not sophisticated enough to know how thoroughly he's been played for nearly his whole life and certainly the last 15 years But Jay Bhattacharya is a part of it Robert Malone's a part of it Kevin McKernan is a part of it Meryl Nass is a part of it Mary Holland is a part of it James Lyons Weiler is a part of it

38:40.970 --> 38:42.430
That's just the reality of things.

38:42.490 --> 38:48.552
And they put Jay Bhattacharya at the head of the NIH because that essentially put Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan there.

38:48.572 --> 38:49.872
And he's useless.

38:50.353 --> 38:51.893
He doesn't have any business being there.

38:52.493 --> 39:06.557
He has the worst CV of any person in academic science because he did all of his degrees in one university, which almost, I guess, no one else has ever done because no one is allowed to.

39:08.837 --> 39:10.278
but Stanford allowed him to do it.

39:10.458 --> 39:11.459
I'm sure it's normal.

39:12.739 --> 39:17.002
Um, I published some, I do some, some great advance.

39:17.682 --> 39:21.285
I can't even watch the rest of it because I think it was the right thing to do.

39:21.845 --> 39:23.826
Um, what's the, what, what should the NIH do?

39:23.866 --> 39:25.587
What policies should we, should we adopt?

39:25.627 --> 39:34.453
I think we thought about dogs and cats going forward for, for the rest of the rest of the, what policies should the NIH adopt going forward about dogs and cats?

39:36.697 --> 39:38.538
portfolio, which is outside the NIH.

39:38.839 --> 39:40.059
Are you asking for my personal opinion?

39:40.079 --> 39:40.940
Yeah, I'd love your personal opinion.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.701
I don't think we should do research on dogs or cats.

39:43.201 --> 39:45.203
Absolutely not.

39:45.343 --> 39:46.283
I think it's unconscionable.

39:46.884 --> 39:55.810
I understand that there's part of the extramural portfolio that exists, that predates you and I. We are constrained under the law.

39:56.880 --> 40:02.564
to leave those existing grants in place for now.

40:02.684 --> 40:07.987
But to phase them out, we are working tirelessly behind the scenes.

40:08.027 --> 40:15.451
We are doing a very critical assessment of the entire extramural grant portfolio to understand.

40:16.112 --> 40:25.378
It's really bizarre because one of the implications here is that somehow or another science has gotten ethically out of control.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.113
and we've got to rein it in.

40:28.553 --> 40:40.285
But at the same time, the FDA, under the same HHS secretary, is getting rid of animal trials under the pretense that we aren't put on earth to torture animals.

40:41.766 --> 40:49.734
But the point of doing animal trials is doing trials on animals that you don't want to do on people, that you shouldn't do on people.

40:50.441 --> 41:01.424
because you don't have enough knowledge about the thing or the process that you're studying to do those kinds of experiments on people in a safe and effective and useful and whatever way.

41:02.525 --> 41:16.069
And so this idea that we just use cats because some people really hate cats and want an excuse to cut them up or some people are really twisted and they just think that beagles are the funnest animals to torture is just absurd.

41:16.109 --> 41:16.889
I'm not saying

41:17.915 --> 41:21.076
that any of these particular one experiment or another is justified.

41:21.116 --> 41:31.539
What I'm saying is that up until now, there's been a pretty rigorous system set in place and there's only some pretty stupid examples of using dogs and cats anymore.

41:32.299 --> 41:36.681
The vast majority of academic research is done in mice and rats.

41:37.541 --> 41:40.102
The next step from there is monkeys.

41:41.482 --> 41:44.663
The cat and dog research that she's, this is bullshit.

41:45.765 --> 42:00.819
He is engaging in bullshit with probably a very unwitting, unsophisticated, not very in-depth biologist who's just doing what she thinks is right with her very limited understanding of the reality of things.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.241
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

42:05.663 --> 42:06.924
Because this is just stupid.

42:06.964 --> 42:15.228
There isn't a single neuroscience lab in the world that uses a dog or a cat anymore, even though that Hubert Weasel did all that vision stuff in cats.

42:15.268 --> 42:16.308
They don't do it anymore.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.551
And so this is just bullshit, is what this is.

42:21.591 --> 42:23.452
This is smoke and mirrors.

42:23.532 --> 42:24.692
It's a lot of nothing.

42:24.992 --> 42:31.996
And this guy is following a script given to him by people who are undermining our country.

42:32.036 --> 42:33.877
They will never, ever, ever

42:34.938 --> 42:39.260
allow this mythology to be broken unless we break it by ourselves.

42:40.460 --> 42:51.864
Where different types of animals are being used and for what purposes and to basically create an action plan to phase those out as quickly as possible under the law.

42:52.965 --> 42:53.625
Well, Nicole.

42:54.727 --> 43:03.892
And she says that really happy because, you know, she's an animal rights activist or some bullshit like that, but she's not a laboratory animal scientist.

43:03.952 --> 43:15.597
She's not somebody who understands the principles behind, you know, trying to choose the right model system to ask the question you want to ask.

43:16.598 --> 43:18.559
And ultimately what this is,

43:19.631 --> 43:38.442
like it or not, is people being brainwashed into fighting against animal testing in order to backdoor the justification for post-market surveillance of pharmaceutical products that would otherwise first need to pass animal testing.

43:39.023 --> 43:40.104
That is the reality.

43:40.724 --> 43:43.886
They are going to replace the animals with AI and with humans.

43:44.943 --> 43:51.945
with machine learning and human testing that they are calling post-marketing surveillance.

43:54.846 --> 44:00.988
Fuck off, Marty McCarty, and fuck off, Jay Antubadacharya, especially you, Jay.

44:08.491 --> 44:09.211
It's just brutal.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.321
I don't know what to say, it's just brutal.

44:12.341 --> 44:25.308
And these agencies admit to their wrongdoing and they say, you know what, we are in a new era, the golden age as President Trump calls it, and under the golden age we are not going to engage in animal testing.

44:25.368 --> 44:33.233
Animal testing is being discussed by Laura Loomer, who was on a thumbnail

44:34.935 --> 44:43.701
with Soph the daughter of Sasha Latupova in 2019 on the same thumbnail making the same screaming face.

44:45.763 --> 44:50.186
So I want to take this moment um to show you something on my phone.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.407
I'm gonna slide over here.

44:52.888 --> 44:53.608
Oh is that not on?

44:53.828 --> 44:53.968
Darn.

44:53.988 --> 44:57.431
Okay I'm gonna let this play out quick.

44:58.134 --> 45:07.103
And so we welcome animal rights or animal welfare groups to approach us if they would like to help us find homes for these animals.

45:08.766 --> 45:10.247
They would get so much good press.

45:10.307 --> 45:11.047
It's such a win.

45:11.147 --> 45:16.949
As you said before, there's literally nothing negative about any of this and it's, it's good PR.

45:16.969 --> 45:22.131
I mean, they should be doing this, not for the PR, obviously they should be doing this because they care about animals.

45:22.291 --> 45:29.514
So she's talking to somebody called as the senior vice president of white coat waste, which I guess is another nonprofit organization.

45:29.554 --> 45:31.174
You can donate all the money you want to.

45:31.855 --> 45:35.536
And this is Laura Loomer who was on a, who was on a, uh,

45:37.560 --> 45:44.904
who was on a podcast, sorry, on a thumbnail of a podcast with Soph.

45:44.964 --> 45:51.628
So a whole series of podcasts always started out with the same thumbnail with a bunch of figures, like six figures screaming.

45:51.688 --> 45:54.089
And one of them was Loomer and one of them was Soph.

45:54.169 --> 45:56.631
Now, I just want to show you on my phone.

45:56.651 --> 45:58.532
I don't know if you can see it now here already.

45:58.672 --> 45:59.192
Yeah, you can.

46:01.273 --> 46:02.494
If you go to your app store,

46:04.886 --> 46:11.896
And you look up... I just don't know what it's going to show all the time, so I don't really want to hold it under there constantly.

46:13.558 --> 46:18.785
If you do PeerTube and search...

46:20.086 --> 46:25.871
You will find this app right here that has the little squid and the triangle and you can you can you can do that.

46:26.311 --> 46:28.753
You can install it's a very small app.

46:29.514 --> 46:39.682
And what's really cool is you can add Gigaohm Biological by adding via URL which is stream.gigaohm.bio and then all of the freaking

46:40.222 --> 46:51.109
videos that are currently going on will load and they will be there as they arrive and they play actually better on this app than they do on the PeerTube website, I shit you not.

46:51.129 --> 46:57.574
They don't stop, they don't like need to be reloaded, like the PeerTube website is not that great but this thing,

46:58.214 --> 47:03.135
plays the videos really, really well and serves them up as they arrive in the feed.

47:04.335 --> 47:07.976
And so it's actually really awesome because you don't need to log in.

47:08.536 --> 47:11.697
It'll say, you're now on Gigaohm Biological.

47:11.717 --> 47:12.677
Do you want to log in?

47:12.717 --> 47:14.217
But you know, there's no log in there.

47:14.277 --> 47:16.077
So you don't need to, you can just close it.

47:16.538 --> 47:20.518
And then in the background, there will be this Gigaohm and you can click on it and it'll go there.

47:21.679 --> 47:23.699
And this is a free app.

47:24.696 --> 47:28.781
And so, you know, not only that, but of course there's lots of other peer tubes you can look for.

47:28.861 --> 47:32.146
I, well, maybe now it's not working right for that reason, but.

47:32.825 --> 47:35.748
I can show you that it can find lots of other PeerTubes as well.

47:36.209 --> 47:40.433
But you can just enter in the URL, stream.gigaohm.bio.

47:40.873 --> 47:45.238
And then when you open PeerTube on your phone, it will just be here.

47:45.278 --> 47:50.884
The other thing to realize is that this app is not gonna make you make a new login.

47:50.944 --> 47:54.607
It's just gonna call you like Sepia the squid fish or something like that.

47:55.368 --> 48:02.071
And Sepia the Squid Fish is just your local account that allows you to save videos and whatever.

48:02.111 --> 48:04.092
And so if I show you right now, I go like this.

48:04.613 --> 48:07.694
It just says Sepia the Cuttlefish is my local account.

48:07.734 --> 48:09.075
I don't get to put my name in there.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.695
I don't need to put my name in there.

48:11.636 --> 48:24.362
And so this is a way for you to watch our work without having a login, without having to have algorithms, and without having to see anybody else's videos except for Mark's and mine.

48:25.427 --> 48:34.054
And if Mark was to do a separate Peertube instance someday, then there would be just a Gigaohm Peertube and a Housatonic Peertube at the top.

48:34.474 --> 48:36.155
And you could switch between the two of them.

48:36.195 --> 48:42.460
And so I think wholeheartedly, I believe that that's what we should be moving forward to.

48:42.640 --> 48:47.524
I don't see any reason this app is so tiny and it doesn't work that great.

48:47.564 --> 48:51.307
For example, you know, it's so simple that if you play one video,

48:53.206 --> 48:56.007
And then you have it playing, I'll just move it forward.

48:56.027 --> 48:57.107
Watch how this works.

48:59.988 --> 49:01.108
Well, now it won't work, right?

49:01.128 --> 49:01.929
Because I'm there.

49:03.129 --> 49:04.349
Just skip it really easy.

49:04.809 --> 49:13.272
But if you put it down, like if you put it like this, and then you come back out.

49:15.586 --> 49:20.029
And you look at something else, like you do this, I don't know how to get it back up.

49:20.309 --> 49:22.851
I can't get it back up, I don't know how to get it back up.

49:23.971 --> 49:28.614
Here's Explore, so you can see all kinds of other people show up on PeerTube.

49:29.095 --> 49:32.597
But you can go back to Home, and then it'll just be GigaOM Biological.

49:32.637 --> 49:33.898
But the only problem is there,

49:35.188 --> 49:39.372
I don't really know how to get the video that you were watching to come back up.

49:39.412 --> 49:40.594
It just stays audio.

49:40.634 --> 49:42.616
So in that case, you have to quit the app and come back.

49:42.656 --> 49:46.640
But that's such a small glitch for how well it plays.

49:47.181 --> 49:51.805
So again, I can't stress enough how happy I am that it finally works.

49:52.842 --> 50:10.098
We've had to do a little tweaking, but essentially on your desktop you will just have this little squid and it'll say PeerTube and you could even, you know, you could even rename that and call it Gigaohm and then you'd have a Gigaohm on your desktop and on your phone.

50:10.138 --> 50:11.760
And it also works on my iPad.

50:12.881 --> 50:15.843
So I think that's really, really great.

50:15.903 --> 50:18.025
It's a lot better than having a bookmark

50:19.206 --> 50:21.087
And it's cool because it's on your phone.

50:21.728 --> 50:22.929
I think it's really kick-ass.

50:22.969 --> 50:24.730
It's been a while in the making.

50:24.790 --> 50:29.853
I knew that the app was there, but there were some things that weren't working right, and now they're working right.

50:29.953 --> 50:36.336
So all you got to do is enter in the URL, stream.gigaohm.bio, and then the thing self-populates.

50:36.557 --> 50:39.558
And now you have it on your phone, on your desktop.

50:40.259 --> 50:43.100
Like I said, with no logins, no passwords.

50:43.781 --> 50:44.621
It's badass.

50:44.922 --> 50:46.302
It's really, really badass.

50:49.265 --> 50:53.386
You gotta work, have a good work, brother Spoon, have a good work.

50:53.406 --> 51:02.209
But let's be honest, a lot of these people in Washington DC are very selfish and they only care about their own image and they care about how an issue can be used.

51:02.269 --> 51:06.010
I mean, you know how it can be used to advance their own agenda.

51:06.110 --> 51:10.031
And so if you're Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, what do you wanna have?

51:10.051 --> 51:16.733
Do you wanna have stories about how you are basically the new Anthony Fauci torturing animals or do you want people to praise you?

51:17.253 --> 51:19.955
You seem to love getting flowers sent to him by PETA.

51:20.015 --> 51:25.538
So more people, Dr. J, if you're watching and listening to this episode, we'll send you flowers.

51:25.718 --> 51:32.442
I will send you flowers if you shut down these these labs and allow for these animals to be released.

51:32.702 --> 51:42.891
So there's a video on Giga Home Biological that called Sasha Sof Anchor Can Sink the Boat of Traitors with CHD Notes.

51:43.431 --> 51:47.415
And I think it's a really good video, but I couldn't get it to put into my stream today.

51:50.898 --> 51:52.399
So I'm going to just play it live.

51:54.289 --> 51:58.211
over here on a separate recorder here if that's okay with you.

51:59.392 --> 52:02.453
Because I think it's a really good video because it shows you the problem, right?

52:02.473 --> 52:17.462
It shows you the problem that these people are all connected together from Jay Bhattacharya to Vinayak Prasad and Marty McCary and Robert Malone and Meryl Ness and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:18.863 --> 52:27.005
Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose and Stephanie Seneff and Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein and Steve Bannon.

52:27.025 --> 52:28.165
This is all one show.

52:29.266 --> 52:38.368
And you can see it's all one show once you realize that even, even Soph kind of breaks the mold, breaks the illusion for everybody.

52:39.368 --> 52:40.048
It really does.

52:40.128 --> 52:41.369
It breaks the illusion for me.

52:41.429 --> 52:42.449
That's for darn sure.

52:42.469 --> 52:43.209
Oops, over here.

52:43.989 --> 52:45.250
This needs to be up there.

52:45.270 --> 52:46.450
There we go.

52:46.710 --> 52:46.910
Oops.

52:51.241 --> 52:54.262
And so, Oh, maybe all the cops in the room.

52:54.522 --> 52:57.362
This is her daughter.

52:57.562 --> 52:59.202
Put them down.

52:59.842 --> 53:02.863
UK cops kill them all.

53:03.623 --> 53:12.845
If you live in the UK and you take a gun and go to your local police station and happen to kill, Oh, maybe all the cops in the room.

53:14.265 --> 53:15.305
It might not be.

53:15.925 --> 53:20.406
This is the daughter of Sasha Latipova before the pandemic.

53:21.786 --> 53:25.728
This is the daughter of Sasha Latapova that was promoted by Alex Jones.

53:26.929 --> 53:30.151
Sasha Latapova was promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:30.231 --> 53:34.894
and Meryl Nass and Polly Tommy and the Epoch Times.

53:37.915 --> 53:43.298
And all of those people have ignored Brandy Vaughn and ignored Tony Barks since they were murdered in 2020.

53:43.419 --> 53:49.582
All of those people can't seem to say that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

53:49.642 --> 53:51.023
They've never been able to say it.

53:52.113 --> 53:54.494
They still have to say vaccine even now.

53:54.514 --> 53:55.395
Worst thing in the world?

53:56.395 --> 53:57.576
I certainly won't be crying.

54:00.938 --> 54:08.562
But I certainly find your story inspiring because even after every major platform removed you, you're still going on your own website.

54:09.062 --> 54:14.345
And I think that's a step that a lot of us need to take if we want to survive and keep making our content.

54:15.316 --> 54:17.697
Wow, okay, well, I got three daughters.

54:18.197 --> 54:21.717
We have to do our own website and that's a step we should take.

54:21.777 --> 54:23.278
It's interesting because I've done it.

54:24.198 --> 54:26.819
I've got my peer tube that also works on the app now.

54:26.839 --> 54:34.400
So you can actually have Giga Home Biological without algorithms, without logins on your phone for like 60 kilobytes.

54:35.721 --> 54:37.681
I wanna survive and keep making our content.

54:38.646 --> 54:38.866
Wow.

54:39.006 --> 54:39.286
Okay.

54:39.326 --> 54:42.289
Well, I, I mean, I've got three daughters and they're, they're awesome.

54:42.889 --> 54:44.410
Uh, and they're smart, but I'm impressed.

54:44.770 --> 54:46.892
Tell me something about your parents and some about yourself.

54:47.192 --> 54:49.774
I mean, don't get anything too private, but whatever's okay for you to get into.

54:49.814 --> 54:51.835
Cause, cause I think America really admires you.

54:52.856 --> 54:53.136
Thanks.

54:53.436 --> 54:57.319
Um, my parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.

54:57.359 --> 54:58.500
They voted for Hillary Clinton.

54:58.540 --> 55:00.021
They, they're left leaning people.

55:00.621 --> 55:04.324
Um, but they're fine with, um, different opinions in the family.

55:04.364 --> 55:05.545
They, they, they think that's fine.

55:05.565 --> 55:07.186
And they, they truly believe in free speech.

55:08.010 --> 55:17.934
They don't necessarily agree with me, but they don't want to shut me down either because they- and I think that's a stance that more left-leaning people should take, that they should be okay with, you know, ideological dissent.

55:18.635 --> 55:23.637
So your parents are more classical liberals who actually believe in freedom and their children being able to think for themselves?

55:24.397 --> 55:24.597
Yes.

55:26.118 --> 55:27.919
School strikes are for the fucking birds.

55:28.279 --> 55:31.080
If you really want some change, get yourself an assault rifle and-

55:34.395 --> 55:37.799
My parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.

55:37.839 --> 55:39.260
They voted for Hillary Clinton.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.461
They're left-leaning people.

55:51.152 --> 55:59.758
foul-mouthed outspokenness and rants against political correctness has made her a far-right media darling and garnered her nearly a million subscribers.

56:00.378 --> 56:04.581
Some of her comments have also made her the target of at least two police investigations.

56:05.021 --> 56:08.323
One concerned an alleged threat made against the CEO of YouTube.

56:08.683 --> 56:13.407
The allegation was that a subject had a Luger

56:14.618 --> 56:26.462
and she knew where the CEO lived and she had called an Uber and she had about 10 minutes to drop a well and it wasn't going to be pretty.

56:26.742 --> 56:33.585
The Tiburon Police Department determined that the threat was not credible since the 14-year-old does not have access to any firearms.

56:33.905 --> 56:36.006
You might be wondering, how do I get in on the action?

56:36.046 --> 56:39.907
What do I got to do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

56:41.013 --> 56:51.377
According to Sasha when she was losing her mind when we first started posting this video and calling her an abusive parent because that's what she is because she filmed this video with her daughter.

57:01.402 --> 57:02.863
She pointed out that her daughter's now 19.

57:03.504 --> 57:08.331
What I think you can see from this video though, is when her daughter was 14, she didn't look 14.

57:09.052 --> 57:10.113
She looked a lot younger.

57:10.754 --> 57:12.336
And her mom took advantage of that.

57:12.396 --> 57:17.923
That's one of the ways that was what made her so interesting was because she looked like she was eight.

57:19.130 --> 57:21.331
And her mom made money from that.

57:21.391 --> 57:29.294
Her mom allowed her to be promoted as a young 18 year old brand new adult on Alex Jones three times in 2019.

57:29.334 --> 57:45.962
This is not by accident that CHD then used her, that the Epoch Times then used her, that the other groups in the world like Panda and the Corona Investigative Committee in Germany, they all used her.

57:46.687 --> 58:07.295
They all used her as an actor because she is on the same shitty script first provided for her around, I guess, 2022 when she started touring the world with Robert Malone, including being on stage in Stockholm in January of 2023 with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Asim Malhotra, and Sasha Latupova.

58:08.072 --> 58:09.953
the mother of this shithead.

58:10.373 --> 58:12.953
And I'm going to call her a shithead because in this video, she's 19.

58:14.514 --> 58:16.734
She deserves to get the shit kicked out of her.

58:16.794 --> 58:20.896
She's a really shitty person for making videos like this.

58:21.036 --> 58:25.437
And it should ruin her adult experience for quite some time.

58:25.497 --> 58:32.499
Every time somebody finds out this is the fucked hard that she is, it should ruin her days to come.

58:34.073 --> 58:37.956
And it should happen over and over again for the rest of her adult life.

58:39.657 --> 58:44.141
Because somebody should really have consequences for performing this level of shit.

58:45.802 --> 58:53.268
I mean, Sasha belongs in jail, but her daughter should just reap what she sows for the rest of her life.

58:53.328 --> 58:54.009
That's what I think.

58:55.856 --> 58:56.556
the pride parade.

58:56.637 --> 59:03.501
The Tiburon Police Department determined that the threat was not credible since the 14-year-old does not have access to any firearms.

59:09.744 --> 59:16.588
The Tiburon Police Department determined that the threat was not credible since the 14-year-old does not have access to any firearms.

59:17.809 --> 59:20.871
I'm doing this for you, Hitler.

59:20.891 --> 59:23.813
I'm doing this for you, Trump.

59:23.833 --> 59:24.213
UK cops

59:25.720 --> 59:26.561
Kill them all.

59:28.382 --> 59:32.825
I don't know what to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, but these people are the worst Americans alive.

59:33.606 --> 59:48.236
This group of meddlers that is orchestrated by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Steve Kirsch and Steve Bannon and the CHD organization, these people are the worst Americans alive.

59:49.520 --> 59:55.744
And they fooled a lot of well-meaning, conservative, Christian Americans into believing that they are something that they are not.

59:57.286 --> 01:00:10.935
And now they are stirring up a storm of stuff about, what, lab animals and publishing fees and more non-profits going nowhere, like white coat waste.

01:00:11.095 --> 01:00:13.917
Ladies and gentlemen, these people are all on the same script.

01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:15.138
You're never gonna change it.

01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:19.141
We need to start to turn on these people.

01:00:21.397 --> 01:00:30.359
There needs to be a preponderance of people showing up at the events that they organize and booing them and throwing things and sabotaging the event.

01:00:33.399 --> 01:00:35.360
We really need that and we need it badly.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.001
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:46.782
All of these organizations need to be disbanded, but first shamed.

01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:52.559
The members of Brownstone, all of them, should be shamed.

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:57.641
Bobby Ann Cox, one of the most fraudulent lawyers in America.

01:00:58.441 --> 01:01:03.823
The lawyer for Grace's dad, Mendelsohn, one of the most fraudulent lawyers in America.

01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:08.025
They're all exceeded, of course, by the king, Aaron Seery.

01:01:10.966 --> 01:01:16.728
But these people stick to a provided script, and these shitheads I know for sure

01:01:17.884 --> 01:01:20.086
deserve the worst for the rest of their life.

01:01:21.328 --> 01:01:27.614
I hope that the karmic delivery that they experience for the rest of their life is just, it's just shocking.

01:01:29.296 --> 01:01:33.360
They deserve really bad random things to happen like falling pianos.

01:01:37.554 --> 01:01:45.798
You can't possibly believe that none of these people could explain to you that the background was misconstrued as spread using non-specific PCR tests.

01:01:45.838 --> 01:01:47.999
They were there specifically not to tell you that.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:56.783
You can't possibly believe that none of these people have figured out that placebo would be a great way to fool everybody, that they would never transfect everybody.

01:01:56.803 --> 01:02:00.924
You can't possibly believe that none of these people could have ever thought of that.

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.126
You have to know that they were out there to make sure we didn't.

01:02:08.117 --> 01:02:13.641
You have to know that these people could have known that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:25.610
And it has to be obvious to you now that not only could they have known about the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, but they were put out there and elevated on social media to make sure that you'd never see it.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.256
That's exactly how this trick was done.

01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:42.508
It was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that's probably still there.

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:52.635
And these people were put in place, and the only thing that they just, all of them can't seem to see that supplementary oxygen is poison, and that opioid deaths have killed a lot of people.

01:02:53.675 --> 01:02:55.296
They just can't seem to figure it out.

01:02:56.977 --> 01:02:58.778
Because they're all scripted liars.

01:02:59.679 --> 01:03:02.461
Traitors to our grandchildren, and they deserve jail or worse.

01:03:04.942 --> 01:03:08.525
They were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure that transfection

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:15.237
And all of the shit that they could have anticipated that would come from it could be blamed effectively on the novel virus.

01:03:15.297 --> 01:03:18.860
And all of these people are traitors to our grandchildren for participating in it.

01:03:19.761 --> 01:03:21.502
There's no other way that I could make.

01:03:22.643 --> 01:03:24.925
There's no other way that I could make this slide.

01:03:25.725 --> 01:03:28.788
Just it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

01:03:29.676 --> 01:03:33.778
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:03:33.818 --> 01:03:48.026
And the funny thing is, by skipping five years there, I skip about three years where I could just put in endless, endless quotes about how Gigaohm's a shithead, Gigaohm's wrong, Jay is an idiot, dip, dip, shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:50.134 --> 01:04:00.768
Four years in between 2020 and 2024, this guy spent almost half of his time on the internet, and that's a lot of hours, opposing me.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.773
And now after six years, you know what they've done?

01:04:05.073 --> 01:04:07.997
They've taken him and had him promote the mother of Soph.

01:04:08.786 --> 01:04:12.770
because he can't do anything for me or to me anymore.

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:26.122
Every stream that he does about Mark and I reinforces the idea that he actually was recruited by Robert Malone and by George Webb because that's why he was streaming in the very beginning with Paul Cuttrell with me.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:51.341
That's why Charles Rixey, the one that Kevin McKernan says wrote the book with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., even though he was fired during the writing of the book, and even though everybody else who wrote the books know that he was fired during the writing of the book, this supreme liar and extreme traitor went on a very big podcast called Danny Jones and said that he's the one who wrote the book with Bobby.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:01.646
and that Alex Washburn was another guy he needed to talk to who's now employed at the NIH by Jay, the traitor Bhattacharya.

01:05:03.288 --> 01:05:14.736
It would be impossible for me to make this video where, where this clown who spent four years making fun of me is now making fun of Sasha Latapova who Mary Holland and

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:23.692
Mike Yeadon are promoting as the, the leading thinker on COVID this year in the summer of 2025.

01:05:24.672 --> 01:05:32.097
It's like a marble statue.

01:05:32.218 --> 01:05:35.460
Problem with experts, even when they're, you know, the good guys.

01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:39.042
Who are the good guys that she's going to list?

01:05:40.643 --> 01:05:42.985
She's literally trying to raise a smile there.

01:05:46.431 --> 01:05:52.134
He's really trying to fake opposition to Sasha there, but it's not really working.

01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:58.738
The kind of vitriol that he used to throw at me is very different than she's trying to force a smile.

01:06:01.199 --> 01:06:02.700
Do you see how pathetic it is?

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.601
Do you see how pathetic it is?

01:06:08.543 --> 01:06:10.584
Kevin McCairn is such a fraud.

01:06:10.864 --> 01:06:12.045
It's kind of sad, really.

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:13.946
He's just a short, fat putz.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:18.833
And when I met him in Pittsburgh, quite frankly, I was disappointed.

01:06:18.894 --> 01:06:23.176
I thought he would be a little taller, have a little more presence.

01:06:26.118 --> 01:06:28.840
It was like a fat Mr. Magoo or something like that.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:37.086
It's really, really very sad, actually, and that they are now so deep into their bench that it's really this

01:06:38.618 --> 01:06:47.324
Mother of Soph, and that retard up there are the two people that Mike Yeadon and Mary Holland say are worth talking about.

01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:49.685
Really on the cutting edge.

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:55.669
Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole, I think of them as good guys.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:07:02.433
Oh, Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole, she thinks of them as good guys because they've been speaking out since the beginning.

01:07:02.754 --> 01:07:03.434
Stop lying.

01:07:03.914 --> 01:07:04.195
I mean.

01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:05.315
Stop lying.

01:07:05.936 --> 01:07:06.256
Stop.

01:07:07.455 --> 01:07:10.317
Remember, she was on stage with Robert Malone in January of 2023.

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:18.380
So team Robert Malone, the same team that was on a boat off the coast of Turkey for a week with Nick Hudson, et cetera.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.241
That same team is all these people.

01:07:22.242 --> 01:07:30.025
Steve Kirsch, Kevin McKernan, Kevin McCairn, George Webb, Paul Cottrell, John Cullen,

01:07:30.973 --> 01:07:31.714
John Goodman.

01:07:31.894 --> 01:07:35.137
They're all part of one stupid shitty show.

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:41.623
There are some higher level players and some lower level players and some people who sit in on the script writing and people who don't.

01:07:42.363 --> 01:07:46.527
Most of them are entirely too unsophisticated to sit in on the script writing.

01:07:48.627 --> 01:07:52.869
And like it or not, Kevin McCarran is only in this narrative because of me.

01:07:53.010 --> 01:08:01.674
If I was not causing the problem that I was causing as a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, they would have never recruited that jackass.

01:08:01.714 --> 01:08:09.479
They recruited that jackass because he apparently did a postdoc with somebody who I now found myself working with at the time at the University of Pittsburgh.

01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:12.020
And that's how he approached me by email.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.501
I'm a dude.

01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:16.623
I saw your YouTube channel and I work with this guy that you work with now.

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:22.486
He's a pathetic traitor.

01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:32.453
And the worst part about for them, for Sasha and for McCairn is that those two are the ones that link all of these people together as one stupid show.

01:08:32.874 --> 01:08:42.181
If it wasn't for Sasha, he wouldn't make to be able to make such a clear connection between Robert Malone and CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:43.482
and Meryl Nass.

01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:47.204
because they were all on the same stage together.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.006
Meryl Ness, the scientific advisor of CHD.

01:08:52.148 --> 01:08:56.411
Robert Malone, the guy with three books published by CHD during the pandemic.

01:08:56.451 --> 01:09:00.274
That's a lot of money that he's raised for CHD selling his books.

01:09:00.754 --> 01:09:13.324
Ladies and gentlemen, this is all one malevolent show that also gets promoted on the BSRF, the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation that people donate to and Steve Kirsch runs and probably takes a salary from.

01:09:16.769 --> 01:09:20.890
You know, Pierre Cory, the guy who testified for George Floyd that he was suffocated.

01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:27.612
Pierre Cory, the supplementary oxygen in hospitals in New York.

01:09:31.173 --> 01:09:32.774
It's really that bad, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:34.855 --> 01:09:35.815
It really is that bad.

01:09:36.584 --> 01:09:38.065
been always outspoken about this.

01:09:38.085 --> 01:09:39.025
So let's do this.

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.746
I don't know really what to say.

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:42.746
I just I feel like I got to take another stab at it.

01:09:42.766 --> 01:09:43.847
I'm going to go blank here.

01:10:05.633 --> 01:10:10.518
So intramuscular injection is just a spectacularly dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:10:10.598 --> 01:10:14.142
Cutaneous immunization works, just not always predictably.

01:10:14.842 --> 01:10:19.066
That's probably why the smallpox variolation probably worked a lot.

01:10:20.388 --> 01:10:22.610
It also is very painful and causes scars.

01:10:23.666 --> 01:10:24.467
It's that simple.

01:10:25.128 --> 01:10:26.809
Number one is that simple.

01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:31.574
Intramuscular injection is just a spectacularly dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:39.062
Cutaneous immunizations probably work, just not always predictably because they're also painful and they cause scars.

01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:42.286
They're not very, people didn't really like them.

01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:50.573
So they transitioned intramuscular injection and it didn't go very well as far as Mark can see, but that's all you need to know.

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:53.616
It's just a dumb idea from the early 1800s.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:55.078
We can just dismiss it.

01:10:56.138 --> 01:11:02.823
And there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that remains and may even continue to increase in the future.

01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:05.444
In fact, that's what they might've been talking about there in Congress.

01:11:06.245 --> 01:11:14.571
This anticipated rise in all cause mortality could have bankrupt many Western nations and is the biological signal being managed with manslaughter and lies.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:24.678
Many of these lies are told on social media by coordinated liars scripted to in turn promote or oppose other liars on the same script.

01:11:26.223 --> 01:11:27.104
You see how easy it is?

01:11:27.144 --> 01:11:28.525
You don't really have to write a substack.

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:31.248
You can just write a little screen, one, one deck.

01:11:31.889 --> 01:11:39.916
A modern RNA, RNA virology also has been used to strengthen and extend this illusion, claiming to find genetic signals in the wild.

01:11:40.116 --> 01:11:49.766
RNA virology then uses pure quantities of synthetic recombinant DNA or RNA transfection in both cell cultures and in animal models.

01:11:49.826 --> 01:11:50.727
This is fraud.

01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:57.693
Coordinated liars fooled all of us into solving the mystery of the novel virus.

01:11:57.733 --> 01:11:58.674
Where did it come from?

01:11:58.734 --> 01:11:59.694
Who's responsible?

01:12:00.535 --> 01:12:11.521
Participating in this theater, even passively, coerced all of us into accepting several false premises, including that we were all in danger and that we could all be in danger again in the future.

01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:19.845
RNA cannot be the basis for a pandemic because it has none of the special chemical characteristics that DNA supposedly has.

01:12:20.806 --> 01:12:22.847
When was the last DNA-based pandemic?

01:12:23.951 --> 01:12:30.953
Gain-of-function is a mythology created by the DoD and HHS to make an RNA pandemic biologically plausible.

01:12:31.854 --> 01:12:32.514
It is not.

01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:46.319
These injections were actually old technology, sometimes differentiated as transformation, adenovirus vectors in DNA, and transfection for RNA.

01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:58.438
But these injections were actually old technologies that were just renamed and reformulated to be treated as new countermeasures, avoid regulation, and allow for the claiming of new intellectual property.

01:12:59.339 --> 01:13:03.303
This is fraud for which the PrEP Act emergency was a required moving part.

01:13:04.264 --> 01:13:07.327
Now the FDA will be made irrelevant.

01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:10.030
Two nows in there, sorry about that.

01:13:12.065 --> 01:13:15.607
There is an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals around us.

01:13:15.647 --> 01:13:21.711
A huge percentage, but not all of these signals are related to bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:35.399
The use of PCR in both virology and medicine makes no effort to differentiate from this background with a capital B, using neither positive nor negative controls, as well as offering no reference scalar.

01:13:36.348 --> 01:13:45.873
The continued fraudulent use of PCR as a medical diagnostic creates a valuable medical remnant stream ideal for the human genome project objectives.

01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:48.935
Oops.

01:13:49.315 --> 01:13:49.836
Go back one.

01:13:50.476 --> 01:13:59.341
The health freedom movement can be seen as fake because of decades of failure to recognize any of these truths, especially number one.

01:14:03.763 --> 01:14:04.424
And finally,

01:14:05.543 --> 01:14:17.777
There are witting and unwitting participants, but Ralph Baric, Peter Daszak, Paul Offit, Mary Holland, Andrew Wakefield, Polly Tommy, Vincent Racaniello, Pierre Corey, Robert Malone, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:17.837 --> 01:14:20.040
are all part of one malevolent script.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.722
It is that bad.

01:14:23.407 --> 01:14:24.888
I think that's a pretty good summary of things.

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:35.154
The New York Times is reporting that Joe Biden's former chief of staff, Jeff Zients, was the one who approved the auto pens use for the 11th hour pardons.

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:37.956
That's the night before Joe Biden left office.

01:14:37.976 --> 01:14:39.437
They started pardoning all these people.

01:14:40.137 --> 01:14:47.902
The pardons included a preemptive pardom for General Mark Milley, a preemptive pardom for Dr. Anthony Fauci.

01:14:48.582 --> 01:14:53.849
Now you are reissuing your criminal referral of Anthony Fauci to the Department of Justice.

01:14:54.269 --> 01:14:59.816
Your reaction to now Jeff Zients being the one who pardoned Fauci, okay?

01:15:00.017 --> 01:15:03.161
It wasn't Joe Biden, he was pardoned by Jeff Zients.

01:15:03.837 --> 01:15:05.478
Yeah, my first question is who knew?

01:15:05.878 --> 01:15:10.341
Who knew that there was a President Jeff Zients and he was in charge of pardons?

01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:15.124
I mean, it is really shocking and on all likelihood criminal.

01:15:15.525 --> 01:15:18.747
Now, will they try to backpedal and say Biden was somehow involved?

01:15:19.187 --> 01:15:20.488
I think that's what they'll try.

01:15:20.888 --> 01:15:24.711
But an auto pen pardon, preemptive pardon, there's a lot to go on here.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:34.819
The only way we could actually get this into court is hopefully the DOJ would do their job, indict Anthony Fauci for the felony of lying to Congress, and then take it to court.

01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:41.104
And then they can plead that he has been pardoned, but then the court could judge whether the pardon is valid.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:45.587
So the only way we get this into court is someone who's been pardoned will have to be indicted.

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:52.433
And I would promote that Anthony Fauci is a prime specimen for this.

01:15:53.035 --> 01:15:58.538
So I believe he said that he didn't do gain-of-function research.

01:15:58.858 --> 01:16:05.602
What specifically did... One second.

01:16:06.363 --> 01:16:08.484
Let me drop out of here quick and repair this.

01:16:08.804 --> 01:16:09.584
Something broke.

01:16:10.325 --> 01:16:14.867
I can do this and do this.

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:17.549
Sorry about that.

01:16:17.609 --> 01:16:20.671
I just want to fix this one thing so I can transition better into this.

01:16:23.084 --> 01:16:40.332
bingo dingo dingo dango there we go one two three yes yes yes delete that will be quick and done all right cool sorry my bad um where were we we were at mr man right

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:53.928
The New York Times is reporting that Biden's Joe Biden's former chief of staff is hopefully the DOJ would do their job, indict Anthony Fauci for the felony of lying to Congress and then take it to court.

01:16:54.328 --> 01:16:57.591
And then they can plead that, you know, he has been pardoned.

01:17:03.277 --> 01:17:05.519
I just typed it in the chat for you for asking.

01:17:06.104 --> 01:17:08.486
but then the court could judge whether the pardon is valid.

01:17:08.786 --> 01:17:12.970
So the only way we get this into court is someone who's been pardoned will have to be indicted.

01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:24.821
And so we're now debating about what the legal status of Anthony Fauci is and arguing about whether or not he covered up the lab leak, which is by design, because this is just a stupid script.

01:17:25.862 --> 01:17:26.863
It's really malevolent.

01:17:26.903 --> 01:17:27.583
It's really awful.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:31.347
And I would promote that Anthony Fauci is a prime specimen for this.

01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:32.488
Damn.

01:17:44.915 --> 01:18:13.213
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot Don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you've got till it's gone They paved paradise, put up a parking lot They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum

01:18:15.559 --> 01:18:19.883
And they charge the people a dollar and a half just to see them.

01:18:21.485 --> 01:18:26.750
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gone?

01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:31.034
They pay Faradise, put up a parking lot.

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:38.562
Hey, Farmer Farmer, put away that DDT now.

01:18:40.646 --> 01:19:08.569
Give me spots on my apples Or leave me the birds and the beers Please, don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you've got till it's gone They paved paradise, pulled up a parking lot Wait, last night I heard the screen door slam And a big yellow taxi took away my house

01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:17.199
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gone?

01:19:17.479 --> 01:19:20.580
We pay paradise, put up a parking lot.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:28.822
I said, don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gone?

01:19:29.902 --> 01:19:33.043
We pay paradise, put up a parking lot.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:38.485
We pay paradise, put up a parking lot.

01:19:49.771 --> 01:20:01.320
That's one of those songs is way too short, but what a voice did Joni Mitchell have The fact that there are people in the chat that don't know that's Joni Mitchell

01:20:02.076 --> 01:20:02.797
That's some trouble.

01:20:03.357 --> 01:20:06.220
I'm gonna forgive you for now, but that's some trouble.

01:20:08.862 --> 01:20:17.029
So let's just listen to this really quick because I wanna do the buzz and the lying thing to make sure you realize how severe it is

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:33.522
that the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project that was on Steve Kirsch's podcast alongside Kevin McCairn, my sort of clown car for the last six years in the UK or in Tokyo with Charles Rixey and with

01:20:34.122 --> 01:20:35.443
with Paul Cottrell.

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:53.473
These people all connected together, met them all, tried to change all of their minds, was manipulated by them for years, so much so that I lost my best friend from college to the shot and a severe aneurysm in December of 2023 because of these people.

01:20:53.634 --> 01:20:59.297
They're murderers, they're liars, and they're scripted liars on all the same script.

01:21:02.185 --> 01:21:09.570
And so if you listen to this guy and you realize what kind of script he's talking about... Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:12.591
So Ralph Baric and gain-of-function teaching the WIV.

01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:21.597
That's already one of the mythologies that this guy is out there making everybody accept that if you make the right combination of bases in an RNA molecule,

01:21:22.017 --> 01:21:26.118
He can go from a mud puddle to everywhere in the world, including all the white-tailed deer.

01:21:26.638 --> 01:21:32.660
This is a traitor to our grandchildren and one of the biggest fraudulent men on the planet.

01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:36.121
He is a liar and a piece of shit.

01:21:38.622 --> 01:21:43.844
And yes, Kevin McKernan, if I ever see you in person, I will have a hard time not knocking you out.

01:21:45.103 --> 01:21:50.912
I actually might go for your knees though because it's something I could walk away from knowing that you would suffer for the rest of your life.

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:53.736
If I just broke your nose, that pain would go away.

01:21:55.525 --> 01:21:55.725
Who?

01:21:56.446 --> 01:21:57.667
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:21:57.887 --> 01:21:57.987
Oh.

01:21:58.187 --> 01:22:02.731
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of echo health into the wave.

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:14.942
OK, so now he's telling the whole story that even Kevin McCarron told in the beginning of the pandemic that it looks like eco health alliance smuggled a bunch of money into the wave and had them do experiments that Obama had banned.

01:22:16.428 --> 01:22:28.589
Yes, they were both on the same script in 2020, and this is the same script in November of 2024 that this shithead is reciting on Danny Jones's very popular podcast.

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:32.921
They put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:33.622
Obama did that, right?

01:22:33.642 --> 01:22:48.881
Obama did that, and so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a non-profit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology, therefore it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan, it's going through some intermediary.

01:22:49.561 --> 01:23:02.844
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-see-um technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

01:23:03.344 --> 01:23:06.805
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

01:23:07.245 --> 01:23:08.445
There is the lie.

01:23:09.165 --> 01:23:11.146
It's not no-see-um technology.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:15.556
It's not to make sure that nobody knows who made the virus.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:26.674
It's just golden gate assembly, which allows you to use a combination of enzymes to make sure that you get exactly the sequence you want, even if you have to join two pieces together.

01:23:27.887 --> 01:23:29.388
Golden Gate Assembly.

01:23:29.428 --> 01:23:35.774
He can't help but tell you the commercial product that he's lying about because he's that big of a shithead.

01:23:35.834 --> 01:23:39.578
It's on his own script, and he frickin' stepped on his own dick here.

01:23:40.278 --> 01:23:47.425
It's his own script, and he just blew it by telling you that it's not no-see-um technology.

01:23:47.906 --> 01:23:52.590
It's not some special baking technique that the fat-ass Ralph Baric invented.

01:23:54.338 --> 01:23:58.710
It is a normal commercial technique that this fat ass is lying about.

01:23:59.844 --> 01:24:05.667
That is, it's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it necessarily from a laboratory.

01:24:06.507 --> 01:24:12.611
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that make us, that got them caught, basically.

01:24:13.251 --> 01:24:16.693
And you should, if you wanna hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

01:24:16.773 --> 01:24:20.315
Charles Rixey has helped, you know, RFK write his book about this.

01:24:21.175 --> 01:24:26.538
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:37.685
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

01:24:37.925 --> 01:24:39.366
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

01:24:39.386 --> 01:24:39.606
No.

01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:42.587
He was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

01:24:43.408 --> 01:24:44.729
Stop lying!

01:24:45.129 --> 01:24:50.872
He is the one who came to my house in January of 2022 and made me stream about the defuse proposal.

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:58.236
And that stream is supposedly the stream that made Robert Malone sit both Robert, sorry, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:58.517 --> 01:25:01.578
and Senator Ron Johnson down and made them watch it.

01:25:01.618 --> 01:25:03.379
And that's why they both called me in April of 2022.

01:25:05.874 --> 01:25:10.016
offered me a job, asked me to help them somehow, understand this, write him a brief.

01:25:13.277 --> 01:25:17.920
Kevin McKernan is one of the biggest frauds of American men.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.082
He may be one of the biggest frauds in all of America's short history.

01:25:24.442 --> 01:25:27.764
He's certainly one of the biggest shitheads in American history.

01:25:29.878 --> 01:25:48.383
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus Under the banner of we need to build seen against this because if we can do what the Chinese can do a kind of thing And the DoD turned down the grant because I thought it was it's too fucking crazy You'll have something to leak from this

01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:56.628
And but as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company We've got like 30 million dollars in grants for NIH.

01:25:57.008 --> 01:26:03.752
You don't apply with grant not having done 80% of it Now the funny thing about it is is in Robert F. Kennedy Kennedy jr.'

01:26:03.712 --> 01:26:15.720
's book the Wuhan cover-up Kevin McKernan is not listed as an expert as far as I know Let me see here

01:26:16.832 --> 01:26:18.093
No, he's not listed here.

01:26:18.113 --> 01:26:19.753
It doesn't say his name at all.

01:26:21.294 --> 01:26:34.100
And one of the quotes in this book, which I'm listed in and in the index for, is the quote that he just said, that you don't apply for a grant without having a lot of it done.

01:26:34.961 --> 01:26:37.242
It's that exact quote, but he's saying it now.

01:26:38.587 --> 01:26:47.836
in the same little story that he's saying that Charles Rixey helped write this book when he actually got fired during his very short tenure helping to write this book with me.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:27:02.229
Why would the former research and development director, college dropout, Kevin McKernan, spend many, many years of the pandemic telling people that I'm chemtrail retarded?

01:27:03.638 --> 01:27:08.900
And yet the HHS secretary listed me in this book and not Rixey, not him.

01:27:09.801 --> 01:27:27.768
And why would he be almost word for word citing a quote that I am quoted saying in this book, it's kind of bizarre, unless you know that this guy is one of the largest, biggest frauds of American men that are alive today.

01:27:29.029 --> 01:27:29.909
Kevin McKernan,

01:27:32.617 --> 01:27:46.044
It's it's just you're looking for the last 20% because you just can't you need it that the grant process is so grueling and so competitive that you in order for you to succeed you have to have all this preliminary data that shows like we can get X done we've demonstrated this piece.

01:27:50.627 --> 01:27:52.368
The Joe Rogan experience.

01:27:59.854 --> 01:28:01.516
It's so fucking weird to be sitting here, bro.

01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:03.517
Is it so strange?

01:28:04.778 --> 01:28:09.202
I Feel like I've I've been on the stump of like a video game observer and now I'm like in the video game.

01:28:09.282 --> 01:28:14.506
Oh, yeah I mean, it's weird.

01:28:14.626 --> 01:28:17.268
It's weird for me, you know, yeah.

01:28:17.368 --> 01:28:17.989
Well, thanks normal.

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:22.392
Thank you for being like the number one promoter of my youtube channel over the past I

01:28:24.904 --> 01:28:25.484
My pleasure.

01:28:25.504 --> 01:28:26.365
It's great stuff, man.

01:28:26.405 --> 01:28:27.285
I watch it all the time.

01:28:27.305 --> 01:28:27.865
You're really good.

01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:39.671
It's just by accident that Joe Rogan is promoting Danny Jones with satanic people on and with lying geneticists on, and come on.

01:28:41.572 --> 01:28:42.913
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:44.354 --> 01:28:45.534
America can wake up.

01:28:46.815 --> 01:28:51.017
The English-speaking world can wake up to this deception.

01:28:52.062 --> 01:28:54.784
to this multi-layered, coordinated fraud.

01:28:56.505 --> 01:28:58.826
It doesn't have to be that Danny Jones gets it.

01:28:58.906 --> 01:29:03.329
In fact, it works better if Danny Jones doesn't get it, but frickin' Rogan gets it.

01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:05.931
And Buck Holtz gets it.

01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:08.792
And McKernan gets it.

01:29:10.974 --> 01:29:11.934
And Kirsch gets it.

01:29:12.615 --> 01:29:13.655
And Malone gets it.

01:29:14.836 --> 01:29:16.157
And Mary Holland gets it.

01:29:16.377 --> 01:29:17.518
Brian Hooker gets it.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:25.827
They all get it, that it's a spectacular commitment to lies that got them this far, and it's their spectacular commitment to lies that will keep them in the show.

01:29:26.207 --> 01:29:26.768
They know that.

01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:28.149
They know that.

01:29:30.706 --> 01:29:32.207
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:29:32.827 --> 01:29:34.588
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:29:34.728 --> 01:29:37.290
Don't forget that this bitch was on Rogan lying.

01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:39.131
Couldn't say it at all.

01:29:39.191 --> 01:29:42.553
In 2018, she could just say that she didn't think there was any way to make a safe vaccine.

01:29:42.593 --> 01:29:49.917
But for three hours on Joe Rogan, ever since Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were killed, I guess nobody can say it anymore.

01:29:49.977 --> 01:29:51.678
Brian Hooker can't seem to pull it out.

01:29:52.959 --> 01:29:54.600
Pauly Tommy can't seem to pull it out.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.122
She was in fricking front of the Senate yesterday for shit's sake.

01:30:02.754 --> 01:30:06.755
is the self-proclaimed daddy of the mRNA vaccine.

01:30:07.395 --> 01:30:14.277
He still, to this day, talks about all the millions of lives that were saved by the vaccine and Operation Warp Speed.

01:30:14.798 --> 01:30:16.038
So that's problem number one.

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:17.158
That's the guy at the top.

01:30:18.078 --> 01:30:25.181
And if you notice what's been talked about in the Maha, it's everything but the mRNA vaccine.

01:30:25.841 --> 01:30:28.341
So that seems to be a blind spot in the administration.

01:30:30.855 --> 01:30:37.658
One camp says well, there's plan be patient the other camp says They're never gonna touch it.

01:30:38.218 --> 01:30:52.184
So, you know, I'm of the opinion that For now That the deaths and injuries since Jan 20 are now on their watch they own them

01:30:52.816 --> 01:31:10.250
So from an ethical standpoint... So this man is in place for the same reason that Nick Hudson is in place and that Denny Rancor is in place, because these guys have the professional background to know that there is this thing called the population pyramid.

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:15.153
And if you look at the population pyramid of a lot of countries in the West, they have a problem because it's inverted.

01:31:15.894 --> 01:31:19.956
And it's a population problem that could be managed with manslaughter and lies.

01:31:20.396 --> 01:31:25.478
And this asshole cannot not know that because he worked for a life insurance company as an actuary.

01:31:25.538 --> 01:31:32.281
Just like Nick Hudson, just like Denny Rancor has enough knowledge to know what he's missing because I told it to him.

01:31:32.621 --> 01:31:34.322
Because it shows up in his own graphs.

01:31:34.382 --> 01:31:37.083
Because this guy never shows a graph that it could show up in.

01:31:37.924 --> 01:31:39.304
These are scripted frauds.

01:31:39.364 --> 01:31:42.946
That's why this guy was on stage with Robert Malone.

01:31:44.281 --> 01:31:49.805
just like Sasha Latupova was on stage with Robert Malone, because they are all one malevolent shithead crew.

01:31:51.066 --> 01:31:55.208
They own what's going on by not talking about it and not removing the vaccine.

01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:58.671
If there's a plan to do that, I'm not privy to it.

01:31:58.731 --> 01:32:00.792
And maybe they have to tread carefully.

01:32:00.832 --> 01:32:02.253
I'm told there's politics.

01:32:02.894 --> 01:32:06.656
They are all going to have to live this lie for the rest of their lives.

01:32:06.716 --> 01:32:13.261
If he's shaking because he doesn't like what he's doing, it's probably because he didn't think he was going to have to do it for the rest of his life.

01:32:14.909 --> 01:32:17.931
But yes, Mr. Dowd, and Mr. Malone, and Ms.

01:32:18.011 --> 01:32:24.234
Rose, and Mrs. Glasspool Malone, and Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Holland, and Ms.

01:32:24.354 --> 01:32:26.095
Tommy, and Ms.

01:32:26.155 --> 01:32:39.862
Nass, and Dr. Nass, you're all gonna have to do this for the rest of your frickin' life until finally you either break or the public is just tired of it and realizes that you are the fraud that you are.

01:32:39.882 --> 01:32:41.563
And they will, because I'm not gonna stop.

01:32:43.342 --> 01:32:49.924
I'll work at the Chick-fil-A drive-thru just to do this one time a week until I can't breathe anymore.

01:32:52.565 --> 01:33:00.268
And nothing renews my fervor than their continuous pollution of social media with their bullshit hamster wheel.

01:33:01.648 --> 01:33:03.229
Duh, we need more data.

01:33:04.009 --> 01:33:09.211
I believe that's all nonsense, but ethically they own

01:33:10.652 --> 01:33:14.053
the deaths and injuries and disabilities from Jan 20.

01:33:14.454 --> 01:33:22.937
So if they do have a plan, I guess that what they're thinking is it's collateral damage because they're of the opinion they can't remove it right now.

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:29.460
And whether that's because of Trump or because of, you know, deep state nefarious forces, don't know, don't care.

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.081
But ethically, they own all the deaths going forward.

01:33:32.101 --> 01:33:34.122
That's where my my stance is.

01:33:36.063 --> 01:33:36.743
I'm an analyst.

01:33:37.527 --> 01:33:45.949
I spoke with many CEOs throughout my career, and I own many stocks.

01:33:46.929 --> 01:34:03.173
And, you know, sometimes when you have access to a CEO, and I did because I had a large, you know, sometimes I was the top shareholder, I would find when they ran into trouble, they would tell me to stick with them, but I just went with the data and the numbers and I would stop talking to them because

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:06.420
Their job is to convince you to hang tight with them.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:11.825
Whereas my job was to protect my clients and not lose money.

01:34:12.486 --> 01:34:13.487
I think he's a fraud.

01:34:13.507 --> 01:34:18.231
I think he's a fraud because he could definitely have known about this incoming signal.

01:34:18.272 --> 01:34:19.433
He definitely knew about it.

01:34:20.512 --> 01:34:22.994
and he's in place to make sure that you don't know anything about it.

01:34:24.054 --> 01:34:29.978
He's very, very intelligent enough to know that this was sculpted using murder and lies or manslaughter and lies.

01:34:30.459 --> 01:34:33.601
And he's also intelligent enough to have made this list and didn't make it.

01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:36.703
He doesn't know about supplementary oxygen because he scripted not to.

01:34:36.723 --> 01:34:43.207
He's not figuring in opioid deaths as contributing to the loss of life expectancy in America because he scripted not to.

01:34:44.909 --> 01:34:50.112
These people are all scripted not to understand anything, but just to repeat and read the script.

01:34:50.132 --> 01:34:56.475
That's why none of them in all these years have gotten to understand that endemicity is a myth, has both a process and an endpoint.

01:34:56.495 --> 01:34:59.476
They've never been able to come up with the idea that maybe they use placebo.

01:34:59.496 --> 01:35:05.679
That'd be a great way to get rid of the adverse offense that would be expected from a transfection.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.261
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:10.502
This is for the grandchildren of earth.

01:35:10.582 --> 01:35:12.523
So I'll be here tomorrow fighting again

01:35:13.483 --> 01:35:16.126
Hopefully a little earlier than now because it's freaking 630.

01:35:16.247 --> 01:35:22.634
I don't even know if I can make it to the gym Thanks for being here Don't forget to get off social media.

01:35:22.694 --> 01:35:24.396
These people are not serious people.

01:35:25.077 --> 01:35:27.419
They are just there to occupy your attention

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.742
with questions that don't matter.

01:35:30.783 --> 01:35:32.504
Get your kids off of social media, though.

01:35:32.524 --> 01:35:33.725
That's the most important thing.

01:35:33.765 --> 01:35:36.328
Get your kids off of social media.

01:35:36.748 --> 01:35:41.012
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances is just plain dumb.

01:35:41.473 --> 01:35:43.234
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:35:43.695 --> 01:35:46.798
Transfection in healthy humans was really a crime.

01:35:47.258 --> 01:35:49.180
And viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.242
I'm going to explain that for the rest of the summer.

01:35:51.782 --> 01:35:53.183
I love you guys very, very much.

01:35:53.864 --> 01:35:56.065
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

01:35:56.125 --> 01:35:57.426
You can find me on PubMed.

01:35:57.466 --> 01:36:01.809
You can buy my book, although that'll help Children's Health Defense who fired me.

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:09.654
And you can send an email to this shithead and give him a link to these streams because maybe he needs to know what I'm up to.

01:36:10.055 --> 01:36:11.616
I've also got a couple YouTube channels.

01:36:11.736 --> 01:36:14.197
I think I'm on JC on a bike right now, but I'm not sure.

01:36:14.998 --> 01:36:16.119
Anyway, thanks for being here.

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.381
You know how it works.

01:36:18.622 --> 01:36:19.723
You got to share the stream.

01:36:20.243 --> 01:36:21.205
You got to pass it around.

01:36:21.665 --> 01:36:23.988
You can also sign up for PeerTube on your phone.

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:25.429
I think it works pretty well now.

01:36:26.471 --> 01:36:28.373
And you can go to giggleandbiological.com.

01:36:28.393 --> 01:36:30.816
I'm going to put a whole page there for PeerTube's app.

01:36:31.557 --> 01:36:34.140
And you can scroll down and find a way to support the stream.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:47.992
If you haven't done it yet and you've been thinking about doing it, if you've got like a house that you sold and you got like $100,000 in the bank, you don't know what to do with it, you can donate it to me and I swear I will do the following.

01:36:48.072 --> 01:36:52.997
I will make billboards that say very simple things like intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:36:54.378 --> 01:37:07.487
I will help other people like me build their own YouTube, sorry, PeerTube channels, so that we can all have a PeerTube channel on that PeerTube app, and we'll start to build a real independent bright web.

01:37:08.007 --> 01:37:13.971
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection as dumb transfection was a crime and population pyramids are real.

01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:14.652
I'll see you soon.
