WEBVTT

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Schedule for 60 minutes next.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It's embarrassing.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
And everybody knows when dry ice mixes with water, it makes a real spooky fog.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Show them, Scooby.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Scooby-Doo!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Dooby-Doo!

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
There was no spread in New York City.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Infectious clones are the only real threat.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
placebo batches were likely distributed.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Transfection in healthy mammals is dumb.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Protocols were murder, gain, or function is a mythology.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
The Scooby-Doo is real and players are committed to lies.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
That's how we're going to get through this, ladies and gentlemen.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
We have to figure this out.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
This faith must be dispelled.

04:48.000 --> 05:03.000
This faith must definitely be dispelled.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
So what is the name of this series band?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
You turn on your phone.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I hear so many stories about them.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Whoa, here we go.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We're blasting right in already.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Good evening.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Welcome to Gigome Biological Eye Resistance Low Noise Information Brief.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Brought to you by a biologist whose voice is still kind of recovering from my vocal

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
hemorrhage.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But yeah, we're doing all right.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
It is the 21st 24th excuse me of October, 2023.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Good to see you there, Liam.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
We are still doing the same little song and dance in the beginning about not taking the debate

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
on social media and not taking the bait on TV.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It's getting very hard because of all the stuff that's going on in the Middle East and elsewhere.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Wow.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
As I mentioned, the Middle East Brass is not exactly the song I want to have in the background.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm just going to kill that.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
That's a little weak.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
In all seriousness, no, it is getting harder and harder to focus on this cave we're trying

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
to get out of because of the fact that so much other distractory news is just being thrown

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
at us.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It's not much different than it was at the beginning of the pandemic.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It's still the same fire hose.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
It's just different flavors and different colors and maybe even getting worse.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But in the end, the goal is the same.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
The goal is to make it feel as though you're in this race car and there's just too much

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
to pay attention to.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And the only thing you can do is hold onto your chair and hope that whatever crashes into

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
the car doesn't hit your side of the vehicle.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
We've been fooled into solving this mystery.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Like I said, the book season is coming out.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Many of us already own books.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
There's new books coming out by Rand Paul.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
There's old books by Andrew Huff and Robert Malone and the Braggons.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
And by that Australian journalist and there's even a new one coming out with Robert F.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Kennedy Jr. as the author.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Some of my biology will be in that book.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
The question is, can we leverage it in a way that will get the truth of the clones out

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
there?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm really not sure.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Either way, I think this so far, you're going to have to excuse me.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
There's still some healing that has to go on.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
I can feel there's a, I don't know if it's a loose thing or whatever, but something's

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
going on back there that every once in a while gets in the way.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I need to cough it out of the way, but there's no pain.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
It's just either my voice is incredibly loud or it's a little half loud.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Right now it's kind of half loud.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
the immune system is dumb.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
I really think understanding what that implies, whether you agree with it or not, at least

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
gets us to a stage where we can talk about things.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
And right now I think sort of a good place to be is also understanding that

08:16.000 --> 08:26.000
it's purest form with the best RNA and the most perfect lipid nanoparticle from the

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
from the private stock of Peter Cullis's silver cabinet that's behind the Rembrandt painting,

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
the best lipid nanoparticles, the best batch of RNA with the highest purity of sequence

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
and the most uniformity of the polyA tail.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
And you would still have the problem that transfection is not immunization.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
You'd still have the problem of expressing a foreign protein in random places in the

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
body.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
And that's the trick that's coming up in the next weeks is this idea that there's this

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
there's this DNA, adulteration, contamination, and that if it wasn't for this, we might

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
be, we might have been scot free.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Who knows?

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
It might have been the best vaccine ever invented, but because of this, all bets are off.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
SV40, oh my.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Now don't get me wrong, it's not good to have DNA in the shot.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But it bypasses the argument of what in the hell were we doing thinking to give the

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
shot in the first place.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
I mean, maybe if there was airborne Ebola, you know, but come on.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
That's the only argument they've got.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
And we must start to mobilize and move into action and play these pieces while they're

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
still on the board because otherwise the sun is setting on our, on our, on our chance

10:05.000 --> 10:16.000
to, to push this before this next illusion of consensus starts to form around, around the

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
idea that my in focus, I can't tell, around the idea that it was the DNA and that we can

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
explain so much.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
The cancer is also from the DNA.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
And SV40 explains the cancer and oh my goodness.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Everything solves itself and look who the heroes are.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
It's ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And don't, please don't misunderstand that.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't want to be a hero.

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
I have been blessed by this crazy scyop and blessed by all the people that have supported

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
this stream and by being hired by CHD.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
I have a decent paying job with insurance for my family.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
And that's a lot better than being homeless.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
And after I got fired from Pitt, you know, like, I don't know.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm very, very humbly thankful to still be in this fight in some way or another.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And I think that's why I still believe it's worth fighting for.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
The idea that the truth might actually catch fire.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
It doesn't have to be, you know, Kevin McCurnan against the world or Robert Malone saving

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
the world on a white horse.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
It just has to be the truth getting out and everybody realizing that so much of what is

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
public health has been a, has been a theater, an elaborate theater to move people and make

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
people behave in a certain way so that trillions of dollars could be controlled.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
And that's on a short timescale.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
And on a longer timescale, we're talking about the actual governance of countries and maybe

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
even the world if you want to think about it that way.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
And in reality, what we have to come to the realization, I'm afraid, is that it's been

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
this way for much longer than since 2020.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
And I think that's what's so hard for everybody is that it, it, it really becomes this thing

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
where there is no other possibility.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
You can't take this on as a hobby.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
You know, it's, it's, it's kind of an all or nothing thing.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
And so we're going to have to find ways to, to get people on board to help them board

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
the ship without them having to climb a, climb a rope and burn their hands and all this other stuff.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, I don't know how we're going to do it, but the DNA in the shot could be, in theory,

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
you know, everybody's going to scream and yell, but it could be a way where if we play our cards

13:09.000 --> 13:20.000
right, you know, they're not going to be able to stop the flood once the water is flowing.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
And I think the way that is, is that you've got to, we've got to be able to accurately

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
and succinctly articulate that in its purest form,

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
transfection with modified RNA that's codon optimized and chemically altered uridines.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And goodness knows what else they did.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
We don't know.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
We don't know if there are any other RNAs in there by accident or on purpose.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
I mean, we really have to talk about the fact that the DNA, I'm just going to, I'm going to waste some time here.

13:57.000 --> 14:07.000
And the DNA idea is such a shiny object that what you're risking doing is bleaching out the rest of the picture,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
which is the more important part.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And they're really doing that.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
I tried to come up with an adequate analogy this afternoon with my, at the, at the lunch table,

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
and I don't know if it's adequate enough, but it's kind of, it's, it's near this.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
But my son's 14 years old.

14:30.000 --> 14:40.000
And if, if I found him across the street in my car with a fifth of whiskey, half gone, completely drunk,

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
the car smashed into the living room of that house.

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
And upon further investigation, we found out that there was 96 octane gas in the car.

14:54.000 --> 15:05.000
And I decided to make it my life's mission to make sure that never ever again did they sell 96 octane gas at a, at a gas station.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
That would be pretty ridiculous, right?

15:08.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, if we're going to campaign that we don't ever want to be transfected again, unless we're sure there's no DNA in it, that's about as dumb.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
And yet that's what this illusion of consensus.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm afraid is going to trick us into behaving.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
That that's the behavior they want us to choose.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
And we've got to be very, I just, if I can help people understand that idea, then you can tell me it's wrong.

15:37.000 --> 15:48.000
But until people can understand that idea and how, how deceptive that trap is, we've, we've just got to be able to see it.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
And I do think that there are people that can see it.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
I do think that there are more people that can be made to help to see it, but there are a lot of people who will never see.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
That's just the way it is.

16:04.000 --> 16:13.000
And mostly it's because there's such a beautifully, beautifully orchestrated apparatus that's designed to do exactly that.

16:13.000 --> 16:24.000
Make sure that people stay right down the middle here and just, you know, dodged and distracted by all the things that don't matter, asking the wrong questions all the time.

16:24.000 --> 16:42.000
So yesterday we looked at this video, which I preface that had something to do with what we've been talking about for a long time, which is this, this elite goal to collect as much biological data about the human genome and its expression in time

16:42.000 --> 16:56.000
as possible in order to feed a hypothetical AI machine learning entity, the data, and somehow crack the human genome.

16:56.000 --> 17:09.000
I guess I better water up a little bit.

17:09.000 --> 17:32.000
And so we watched this video yesterday of Dr. Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg talking about their the CZIs overarching plan to cure all diseases, and they were interviewed by this guy, Huberman, who I started out with a very honest praise of him.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
I thought he, I think he's a great guy, but I was really kind of shocked at how he performed in this, in this video.

17:38.000 --> 17:49.000
And when I, it's funny when I ended the show, fear that my wife, she said, I thought you knew about him already.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm like, what, he's really smart, but didn't you know, and she sent me this.

17:57.000 --> 18:09.000
She sent me this thing that they were like, at Lex, they celebrated Lex Friedman's birthday with Joe.

18:09.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh boy. So anyway, yeah, I was a, I'm a little bit behind the times with where with regard to whether or not Huberman was on our side or the other side.

18:20.000 --> 18:45.000
And yeah, and this is an, is a absolutely spectacular example of what I've been trying to talk about is that these people were put into place early and, and this network has been used exquisitely to create this.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
What about a limited spectrum of debate within which there is a very lively discussion.

18:53.000 --> 19:09.000
And within within that limited spectrum of debate defined by these people is a lively discussion defined by these people and we all go, wow, that illusion of consensus is pretty convincing.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
And the magic spell is cast.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
That's the awfulness of social media.

19:17.000 --> 19:29.000
Now, I want to just make sure that I'm not supposed to stop here first because I do have two things to look at here, but let me think of make sure what my mind was thinking here.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, so I want to keep going.

19:32.000 --> 19:52.000
So I've played this many times that part of the illusion of consensus is around this idea that gain of function is real and that's the overarching mythology, you know, the, the, that's the boogeyman that they're, they're making us afraid of.

19:52.000 --> 20:02.000
Yesterday, I also introduced this concept that's really not my concept, but it's the first time that I've tried to do it with this, with this little simple slide.

20:02.000 --> 20:14.000
And as you know, this is the all cause mortality rate in the United States defined in weeks from the years 2014 all the way to I believe this is the beginning of 2022.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, sorry, you can see that.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
I think this is 2014 and this is the beginning of 2022.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
And so this season of fluctuation that you see here is a real phenomenon.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
And it is just the seasonal variation in the weekly all cause mortality in America.

20:29.000 --> 20:39.000
Remember, between 2.7 and 3 million people are expected to die every year in America as our population continues to slowly rise.

20:39.000 --> 20:51.000
And so it's not really clear what the real deaths would be here, but if you can zoom back a little bit more, you can actually see that this graph is actually inclined like this over time or so I can go like this.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Oops, inclined like this over time.

20:54.000 --> 21:07.000
And if you see some of Denny Rancor's data where it goes back farther, you can see that trend present on top of an ever rising all cause mortality rate because we have more people in America and that's the way it is.

21:07.000 --> 21:26.000
So in addition to that, what you have to understand is happening here in case you're unaware is that a population pyramid can be drawn where you have all of the people, men and women, graft on the bottom from little kids all the way up to old people at the top.

21:26.000 --> 21:34.000
And depending on the shape of that pyramid, you can understand how the evolution of that population will occur over time.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
And if you don't know enough about population pyramids, I suggest you read about them a little bit because our population pyramid is about to invert.

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
And as it inverts, it creates a very predictable effect on the economics of the socioeconomic structure and what that socioeconomic structure is capable of.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
And also it changes the way that the all cause mortality rate will change over time.

21:59.000 --> 22:12.000
And that is also something that has been happening here for quite some more than a few years, which means it's possible that there were a lot of, let's say, people beyond the life, age expectancy.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
Here, look, this, this, this peak right here is almost cut off. It's one of the lowest peaks since what is this 2015.

22:21.000 --> 22:36.000
So in that sense, there's a possibility that there were some people that were either, either could have died, but didn't in these several years that ended up dying all in 2020.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
And how did that occur?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Were they all in hospitals in New York?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
It seems like it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So there's a lot of things to hunt out here.

22:42.000 --> 22:53.000
But the point is, is that a novel virus in their story is a novel cause of death.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
So it should be taking out people that otherwise would not have died.

22:58.000 --> 23:09.000
So you need in order to figure out where the pandemic is in this light blue graph here, you need to accurately subtract this expected value out from under.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
You see?

23:10.000 --> 23:18.000
And whatever it is on top of that, in theory would be the novel cause of death.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
Now, in order to find that number, you've got to do some math.

23:23.000 --> 23:38.000
And so this was the, the reason why we were using this graph before was to explain what we think is the hypothesis, which is that, that the who declared a pandemic of a novel virus, the PCR test, the financial incentive, and the plan that was ready to do that.

23:38.000 --> 23:58.000
The plan that was ready to go, the only molecular explanation for all of this molecular biology to be even remotely, remotely solid or believable at the beginning of the pandemic is for a clone or clones to have been used and shoot.

23:58.000 --> 24:13.000
And the idea, again, is to invert our sovereignty to, to permissions, but using this, this same graph, this way, I want you to think about where this mystery virus total comes from.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Sorry, I'm being so awkward here.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
I didn't put these slides together in the order that I thought I did so that that one was supposed to come at the end.

24:22.000 --> 24:36.000
The mystery virus, if you want to think about what the mystery, who the mystery virus killed, you have to look at all excess deaths, but then you must subtract all of the truths that we now know we didn't know that this was all going on in 2020 when we were all staying at

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
home because Brett Weinstein told us that he was going to stay at home and we were wearing bandanas and whatever.

24:44.000 --> 24:52.000
So in 2020, we didn't know that they had do not resuscitate orders in New York City and that they weren't resuscitating heart attacks.

24:52.000 --> 24:59.000
And when the heart attacks went up, we just, we just heard about it on the news is being COVID.

24:59.000 --> 25:10.000
But now we know that they actually did that, which caused a rise in heart attack deaths caused a rise in stroke deaths.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
It wasn't COVID. It was the fact that they didn't go to people. They didn't resuscitate people.

25:15.000 --> 25:26.000
And that's a pretty big revelation because that also pretty much correlates with the rise and fall of the extreme event that happened in New York City.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Then in no way resembles the spreading of a respiratory virus.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
You also have to subtract all of the people who were ventilated that shouldn't have been ventilated.

25:37.000 --> 25:50.000
You need to subtract all of the people that should have gotten antibiotics but didn't because people like Vincent Rancin yellow and David Griffin or whatever his name is.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
They were all saying that antibiotics don't work for a viral disease.

25:55.000 --> 26:08.000
The lack of antibiotics is coupled with the poor use of steroids either administered when they shouldn't have been or when it was finally probably necessary in an emergency they were not administered.

26:08.000 --> 26:19.000
The use of remdesivir is still just the most absurd thing ever and none of these people talk about it.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
And the fact that the opioid deaths have to be subtracted from this.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
You can't because they're not here and they're not in the expected deaths.

26:34.000 --> 26:43.000
Expected deaths are from like car accidents and illness and they have all these numbers.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
And there aren't expected deaths for opioid deaths.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
That's not a thing you figure in.

26:52.000 --> 27:05.000
And if you figure it in over there, then you have to figure figure in the trends of whatever happening in that opioid deaths and make sure that they're all in that which you know they're not.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
And the death certificate fraud is very significant from California to New York.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
There's all kinds of different investigators that have shown this.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
And so once you subtract all of these things away, maybe there's nothing left.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
In fact, there isn't.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
These same people they also avoid discussing the PCR fraud, the lateral flow test fraud.

27:31.000 --> 27:42.000
A lot of people aren't aware of the lateral flow test fraud, but you know, the UK's second wave of COVID was almost completely defined by a Chinese lateral flow test.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
Chinese lateral flow test product.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
They didn't even use, you know, traditional PCR.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
They use something else to define COVID for almost half a year.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
From China.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Variants and sequences, they just don't talk about that anymore.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
Everybody just assumes that that's too hard for me.

28:06.000 --> 28:15.000
Nobody ever talks about the use of RNA infectious clones throughout RNA virology as the standard.

28:15.000 --> 28:23.000
They don't talk about quasi species swarm genetics and how that relates to variant sequences or they don't talk about incompetent fractions of the virus.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
They don't talk about any of that RNA fidelity limits.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, no, there's proofreading in coronaviruses. There's this EXO and gene.

28:35.000 --> 28:55.000
They are playing games with us because they also don't talk about the homology between other coronavirus proteins reported in the literature, which means that our immune system has more and more reason not to differentiate between this one and any other previously encountered RNA coronavirus.

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
If you just play their comic book game of what viruses are and what have been reported in the past, it doesn't make sense.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
Never mind if you try to question the fidelity of that story.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And what's at the heart of this?

29:11.000 --> 29:18.000
What's at the heart of all of this inability to question these things or even bring these up to do this math correctly?

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
What's at that heart of not being able to talk about PCR?

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Why don't they ever mention it anymore?

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
I believe at the heart of this is this faith that there was a novel virus.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
You can't do the math up here and have there be a novel virus still.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
The novel virus disappears.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
So they can't do this math.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
They can't talk about opioid deaths at all because they risk doing the math.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
They can't really mention remdesivir because then they might risk doing the math.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
Can't mention ventilators almost ever again because they might risk doing the math.

29:59.000 --> 30:16.000
They'll want to talk to Jessica Hockett about what happened to New York for four weeks because they might risk doing that math and that will dispel the first tenant of the faith tenant of the faith, which is there was a novel virus.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Now millions died and were saved because that's both part of the narrative.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
How were they saved?

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Depends on what part of the story you want to believe.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Maybe it was the ones who got Ivermectin.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
Maybe it was the ones who, I don't know, got vitamin D.

30:36.000 --> 30:44.000
Maybe you believe the people that took the RNA were the ones who didn't go to the hospital and only the vaccinated or unvaccinated died.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
Maybe that's you what you believe, but you believe something about that.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Most likely you also believe the gain of function is real.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
That's a real tenant of the faith.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
None of these people will question that.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And the virus will come again.

31:02.000 --> 31:10.000
Well, of course, some people believe that Omicron was a virus come again from a laboratory released by a white hat.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Some people believe that every variant was released.

31:13.000 --> 31:22.000
I think there's a Japanese group that published a paper that said every variant since Omicron has been released.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
That's the same narrative.

31:28.000 --> 31:40.000
I think there's really an illusion of consensus about this faith that everybody is bamboozled into accepting by solving this mystery.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
This mystery of who did it, taking a mask off.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
We're going to put Fauci in jail for all those liars.

31:53.000 --> 32:03.000
And when they changed our mind about this as being a novel virus and we accepted it, then all of this stuff was possible.

32:03.000 --> 32:13.000
That's the trick. Once you accept the faith, then all of this stuff makes sense, or at least you can't blame anybody for having done it.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
If you accept the faith, you can't blame anybody for trying.

32:17.000 --> 32:25.000
I mean, it was all hands on deck. What'd you do?

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
And that's what this is about.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
The illusion of consensus was started in 2019 by the intellectual dark web.

32:34.000 --> 32:49.000
By people like Sam Harris, by people like Eric Weinstein with Peter Teal on one of his first podcasts talking about this possibility exactly.

32:49.000 --> 32:56.000
That they would lie to us about science in order to control us.

32:56.000 --> 33:08.000
And with Brett Weinstein with Sam Harris on his number eight podcast talking about how when a real pandemic comes December 20, 2019.

33:08.000 --> 33:21.000
When a real pandemic comes, we won't be able to tolerate them there anti-vaxxers.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
2020, the undercurrents of a lab leak were seeded.

33:27.000 --> 33:46.000
And they controlled that very well while on TV, they made it seem like almost ridiculous, which fueled that underground fire of that lab leak story even more until 2021 when it started to get a little more traction and even even Tucker Carlson talked about it.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
And then Omicron went around and people started talking about another lab leak released.

33:51.000 --> 33:59.000
Wow, good guys. This is vaccinating the world. Oh, no, says carrot, London, Bosch, not vaccinating the world.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
This is the start of doom.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
And none of those prescriptions ever to question the faith at all.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
That's what this laboratory that cave zoneosis thing is all about.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
You can fight about that all you want because it is a controlled space.

34:20.000 --> 34:28.000
It is a limited spectrum of debate within which there's a very lively discussion over three years.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh boy.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
We still haven't figured it out. Six books later.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
That's an illusion.

34:44.000 --> 34:50.000
That whole thing was an illusion. The good guys, the bad guys.

34:50.000 --> 35:03.000
So many of them were just pretending to be against each other, pretending to be antagonizing one another.

35:03.000 --> 35:16.000
And it's still happening now. People are still trying to play that game of, you know, I'm against so-and-so and so pay attention to me.

35:16.000 --> 35:26.000
It's a very, very disingenuous game if it's not centered around explaining what happened.

35:26.000 --> 35:38.000
And almost nobody is interested in explaining what happened. Why are they not interested in explaining what happened?

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
Because they don't want to question this faith.

35:43.000 --> 35:52.000
You see, if you start talking about what really happened, then you start questioning this faith and none of these people are allowed to do that.

35:52.000 --> 36:00.000
And I can't stress how important it is for you to be able to start to scrutinize people just based on that idea alone.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
You can see people for what they are in a snap.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
And there's lots of them in the best places.

36:11.000 --> 36:27.000
And so as great as it feels that we're making all this progress, we haven't really made much progress because this faith is still solid as a rock.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
And that's the problem. This illusion of consensus hasn't been broken yet and no matter how we bring it, but this is the best I can do.

36:35.000 --> 36:46.000
It's a bad leak, a release. It does not matter because the faith is a lie.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay, so let's get out of this. Let's watch these two.

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
First of all, I wanted to watch this one because it came back up again and it's a cut that this guy made.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
So he made a cut of this video we watched earlier. It's only like 12 minutes wrong and it's the best cut. It's the one that I went nuts on.

37:06.000 --> 37:14.000
And I think it's worth bringing up again because this is a great example of, again, what were we talking about?

37:14.000 --> 37:25.000
This idea that he's not going to, he's not going off you demon.

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
He's not going to question the faith, right? He's not going to question this.

37:32.000 --> 37:40.000
He's not going to question this. He's not going to bring up PCR or lateral flow test fraud in the UK. He's not going to bring up variance sequences.

37:40.000 --> 37:55.000
Nothing about the virology at all. He's not going to bring up any of those other causes of death. None of these causes that need to be removed from that hypothetical total of a million people killed in America.

37:55.000 --> 38:19.000
He's not going to do any of that math and he's going to spend like 12 minutes spewing hot air about the RNA, knowing full well what we know, which is there is this play to make us think that the DNA is really the only thing that really screwed us and those bastards knew it.

38:20.000 --> 38:29.000
Listen carefully. I'll probably just let it play because it's fun. Did it play? Yeah.

38:29.000 --> 38:39.000
I'm going to say something now and I had responded to a few comments on social media as well. And I, as I wrote something, I reflected on it.

38:39.000 --> 39:05.000
And my feeling is that the technology has some limitations, but my honest instinct is that they did it with the wrong disease at too big a scale, meaning that if they had done what the intention was, which was to focus on the high risk cohort

39:06.000 --> 39:18.000
and try to protect them with the technology, I think the risk or the potential exposure of the technology would have been significantly lower.

39:18.000 --> 39:34.000
And I said something here. I'll finish with this statement. I said that no matter what the political situation is, the people who have been hurt in one way or the other by the technology,

39:34.000 --> 39:53.000
will never be silent. And that's in effect, the thing that is unstoppable. And so the platform, even though it could have more modifications, more benefits, could be destroyed at this altar. Any thoughts on that?

39:54.000 --> 40:12.000
So I had warned about this and not just the platform, but the entire vaccine enterprise has been compromised. And public faith in public health, the reputation of the CDC, the reputation of the FDA, I speak about this from time to time.

40:12.000 --> 40:22.000
I was speaking to a Portuguese audience about a year and a half or two years ago, and an older woman asked me a question and prefaced it with a preamble.

40:22.000 --> 40:37.000
And she made the point that throughout Europe, the FDA had always been believed to be the gold standard for integrity and rigor in regulation of drugs and biological products.

40:38.000 --> 40:52.000
And that she had come to now understand that the FDA was corrupt and could not be relied on. And when she said that, I had not allowed that thought to come into my mind up until that point.

40:52.000 --> 41:04.000
And it literally hit me like a brick to the head that in this rush, this Operation Warp Speed, and all of the propaganda.

41:04.000 --> 41:13.000
So did you catch that? I mean, it's just, it hurts my head sometimes when I listen to this one. I'm going to go back a little bit, just so you hear it.

41:13.000 --> 41:21.000
Now, imagine Robert Malone, who consulted for epivacs.

41:21.000 --> 41:41.000
Robert Malone, who co-founded Anovio, Robert Malone, who spoke in front of the who in 2011 about flu vaccines, who worked with Herod Vunden-Bosch in 2007 and 2008 on flu vaccines in Solve.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
Robert Malone of West Coast clinical trials.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
Robert Malone, who's great friends with David Hone.

41:52.000 --> 41:59.000
Robert Malone, the guy who's claims to have been vetted for U.S. amored head of science.

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
Robert Malone, who's been on the Tommy podcast several times, a few times with Stephen Hatfield.

42:07.000 --> 42:16.000
Robert Malone, the guy who claims to have eight patents, which should have given him some claim to the Nobel Prize from this year.

42:16.000 --> 42:24.000
Robert Malone, who the guy who led us to Peter Collis, and later to Abzallera.

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
Robert Malone says that he didn't realize that the FDA could what?

42:30.000 --> 42:42.000
The regulation of drugs and biological products, and that she had come to now understand that the FDA was corrupt and could not be relied on.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
And when she said that, I had not allowed that thought to come into my mind up until that point.

42:48.000 --> 42:59.000
And it literally hit me like a brick to the head that in this rush, this Operation Warp Speed, and all of the propaganda,

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
and misinformation and disinformation that was propagated by the government.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
And the withholding of information about adverse events, for instance, myocarditis in particular.

43:10.000 --> 43:23.000
What we had done as a United States health and human services and bio-defense infrastructure and really biomedical pharmaceutical complex,

43:23.000 --> 43:38.000
is we had destroyed or severely damaged our competitive position in the world as the preeminent developer and manufacturer of these types of products.

43:38.000 --> 43:52.000
And my prediction had been then, and I think we're seeing it accelerate, that what would be the logical consequence would be that the United States would continue to lose

43:52.000 --> 44:05.000
its dominant position in biopharmaceuticals to India and China, one of which is considered a hostile nation, and the other one is at best a frenemy.

44:05.000 --> 44:18.000
Certainly a strong competitor. And that's what's happened. The United States now has to import not only final drug product, but drug precursors, if they're going to do that.

44:18.000 --> 44:41.000
And the reputation of the FDA is trashed globally and within the states. The damage that's been done here through the logic of emergency use authorization of products that have proven to be neither safe nor effective.

44:41.000 --> 45:03.000
In response to what was basically marketed or propagandized as a highly lethal respiratory virus with a 3.4% case fatality rate, based on Ferguson's modeling largely at Imperial College in his group.

45:03.000 --> 45:22.000
And has proven to be paradoxically, Mr Trump got this right. Early on, there's multiple video clips of him saying that the fatality rate here, I think he calls it mortality rate, is well less than 1%. That turns out to be the case.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
And the whole.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
Can you hear that he's not he's not questioning the the faith at all in fact he's preaching it.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
He's giving you the case fatality rate of the novel virus.

45:40.000 --> 45:51.000
He's not questioning it at all. He's giving you the case fatality rate of the holy novel virus.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
I find it pretty extraordinary.

45:56.000 --> 46:02.000
I mean, I find it really extraordinary.

46:02.000 --> 46:14.000
Logic that this was a highly lethal virus that would overwhelm our hospitals causes us to need to have mass graves and.

46:14.000 --> 46:23.000
Freezer vans full of dead bodies and et cetera, et cetera. That's all turned out to be false propaganda.

46:23.000 --> 46:35.000
And, but that is what has been used to justify these breaches of what are really international norms of ethics and product development that have been developed over decades.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
So we're now left. I could tell you my colleagues in the.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
Clinical development and earlier phase pharmaceutical development space.

46:45.000 --> 46:54.000
I'm just kind of confused as to whether he is saying that he was also fooled by this propaganda and that's why he spent all of.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Two thousand twenty and two thousand.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
Much of the beginning of two thousand twenty one.

47:01.000 --> 47:11.000
Working to find combinations of possible repeat patentable combinations of repurposed drugs and bringing them to market.

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
Because he thought that there was an especially dangerous virus with about three percent fatality rate like.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
And he wrote said the other day.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
So I'm really confused here because.

47:26.000 --> 47:35.000
I don't think obviously he's not being honest, but I wanted you to see exactly how much performance is happening now and.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
I think this rehe rehearsing this over and over.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
It can't help but make it clearer.

47:45.000 --> 47:53.000
And it's it's becoming very crystal clear to me now that we are right on target and all we need to do.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
Is keep this steady pressure on so that.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
So that we remain focused on this.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
We're not going to lose sight of the idea that we are not going to.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Allow the DNA.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
To take the blame.

48:10.000 --> 48:17.000
We're not going to allow the ninety six octane gasoline that was in my car to take the blame for the fact that my fourteen year old boy.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
Was driving drunk.

48:21.000 --> 48:28.000
And we're not going to let DNA contamination take the blame for the fact that we decided that it would be okay to put.

48:28.000 --> 48:38.000
Five point six billion transfection products into the arms of relatively healthy humans.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
That's what we need to understand if it's if it's lipid nanoparticles are bad to great.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
If it's the RNA contaminations are bad to that's great.

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
If it's the spike protein also causes amyloid and some people great.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
If it causes clotting and most people great.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
All the better.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
But we cannot blame one of those are all of those things it's all it's all bad.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Your son wasn't wearing shoes either great.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
Your son didn't have his glasses on great.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
It's all wrong.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
He's fourteen year old driving a car was already wrong.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Then he got drunk.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Then he didn't have his glasses on any of you see.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
And it has always been that game.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
Because what was the game they just don't want you to say that transfection is bad.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
So they had to do that game.

49:42.000 --> 49:49.000
But it was so I mean when it was on you couldn't see the game.

49:49.000 --> 50:00.000
And these guys are still playing the game that doctor Philip McMillan just said that we should have saved the old people with the technology.

50:00.000 --> 50:17.000
That Philip McMillan had a conference over a weekend that included Kevin McCarron the guy who said that there could be a billion people dead from this virus in February of 2020.

50:17.000 --> 50:27.000
And continued to say worst case scenario was possible for several months after that.

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
As part of a little network of people it all seemed to be connected right back to Robert Malone.

50:33.000 --> 50:43.000
Including George Webb and Paul Catrell who Robert Malone is streamed with.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
And although George Webb is supposed to be Robert Malone's arch enemy.

50:49.000 --> 51:01.000
Robert one of Robert Malone's first streaming partners and streaming interviewees was Paul Catrell who George Webb says is like the greatest hero of all.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
Dr. bus rider MD.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
These connections aren't random.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
These are the bricks at the back of the theater.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
This is where this is where it ends.

51:17.000 --> 51:27.000
If there are people behind these people great if they're we got their order wrong or who's behind who wrong who cares.

51:27.000 --> 51:37.000
These are clearly the bricks the scenery that it's all visible now we just have to kind of be careful not to kick any of it down.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
And don't get these people confused with the stage hands.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
I guess I'll just let it play out because he probably says a few more ridiculous things.

51:47.000 --> 52:09.000
Are perplexed now that it's what's what's happened in in the states with regulatory affairs and the FDA is that what what had previously been a fairly rigorous and highly structured process.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
We all knew the rules.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
We knew what the process was.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
We could project how much it costs.

52:15.000 --> 52:23.000
We could project the timelines and you know grind away for a decade to get the product developed and you know safe and effective.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
And now it's kind of anything goes if they want it to go.

52:28.000 --> 52:36.000
And if they want to hold you to higher standards they will and you can't predict what it's going to be.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
You know your people are left with well who I have to pay off.

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
You know what do I have to do to it's the whole system is now compromised.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Its integrity is compromised.

52:49.000 --> 53:00.000
So now this one is going to be even more fun because guess who was just on Tommy.

53:00.000 --> 53:09.000
And again all we're going to listen to is another person trying to defend the faith.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
And remember what the faith is again I'll just bring it up to be a little bit repetitive.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
But the faith is this faith right here.

53:19.000 --> 53:26.000
There was a novel virus millions died and were saved gain a function is real and a virus will come again.

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
And the people who are faithful avoid discussing the PCR fraud or the testing fraud.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
They avoid discussing variants and sequences and what they might mean or not mean.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
They avoid all discussion of the details of virology.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
And they discuss nothing to do with the homology between these proteins and others.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
It's just the whole virology thing is thrown out the window with these people.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
And that's part of what the no virus people are all about.

53:56.000 --> 54:05.000
It's kind of taking a for you to miss this to miss all of this.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
And so if you miss all of this and you just say now there's nothing then you also lose.

54:11.000 --> 54:18.000
Then you fail to understand what clones are and you fail to understand what things they do have

54:18.000 --> 54:27.000
which can be used to create the illusion of this molecular biology.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
And if they don't do the math and this that's the math of how do you get the total number of deaths caused by the virus.

54:34.000 --> 54:47.000
You have to take all excess deaths and you subtract the do not resuscitate orders the ventilated people the people that didn't get antibiotics.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
People have had remdesivir the opioid deaths.

54:50.000 --> 54:57.000
The death certificate fraud and this one is I can't remember anymore but we can go back up one here.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
It's yeah sorry the prior use of steroids.

55:00.000 --> 55:09.000
So anyway this this faith is not going to be is not going to be questioned and it's now Stephen Hatfield high priest number two.

55:09.000 --> 55:18.000
The first high priest and acolyte we had a high priest Robert Malone and we had an acolyte the doctor Philip McMillan.

55:18.000 --> 55:27.000
And now we have another high priest this would be Stephen Hatfield and an acolyte in Tommy.

55:27.000 --> 55:35.000
And so when Tommy interviews other people and the faith is questioned how does Tommy defend the faith.

55:35.000 --> 55:44.000
Well he defends the faith by following the teachings of these high priests that he's had through his podcast multiple times.

55:44.000 --> 55:54.000
And they go through his podcast on purpose so that when he's interviewing all these other people this faith is never questioned.

55:54.000 --> 56:02.000
Or if it's questioned it's also jokingly brought in back into existence by Tommy.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
And if you really want to waste your time you can actually watch and find out that I'm totally right about that.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
Even when he's playing video games.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
So let's check this.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
October 22nd 2023.

56:19.000 --> 56:27.000
You can find the link to Dr. Hatfield book three seconds for midnight and I do believe you have a new book coming out but I don't know when so I'm not going to make any promises to anybody.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
But when is it coming out.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Oh we're hoping November.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
November.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
All right fair enough.

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
And could you Dr. Hatfield for everyone listening who maybe doesn't know who you are could you please introduce yourself.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
Well I'm like nobody.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Fuck me.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Fuck me.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Fuck me for crying.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I know who this guy is he's a homeless guy.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
He's in person.

56:48.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah I found his phone number and said will you stand are you in escort will you come to a podcast and pretend you're.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
I don't really know what what do you see this as if you can.

56:59.000 --> 57:08.000
If the if you start your podcast with F me F me F me with a guy who is supposed to be able to.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
You know be be in the White House.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
Or or sitting at a strategy meeting for a.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
For an advisory committee would not be crazy apparently Steven had Phil.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
But he's now here in a sweatshirt.

57:24.000 --> 57:33.000
Talking to some kid who says F me F me F me any laughs.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
What what what is the goal here.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
What are they doing.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
They're they're they're proselytizing.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
This is spreading the word right here.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
It's like an elaborate sales pitch for for.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
I don't know 20 and 30 year olds.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
College age kids I don't know who watches this.

57:59.000 --> 58:06.000
But it's extraordinary to me because that's not.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Yeah.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
It's extraordinary to me doctor and he said sure thing.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
No, he's doctor had value.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
You were in Trump's I believe his pandemic is pandemic response committee.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
Right. You worked in the White House and you've done research all of your career.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Yeah, I am.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
When all of 2020 was I was called into the White House to the executive office.

58:26.000 --> 58:32.000
Where I worked with Peter Navarro to try to bring some rationality and sanity.

58:32.000 --> 58:39.000
To what the White House task force have turned into a nightmare of a response that had no chance of ever working three years later.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
We can see it didn't work at all.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
All the things they tried the lockdowns useless.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
At the most, maybe it reduced desk by one percent. We're not even sure of that.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Masking useless did nothing.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Social distancing.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
Altogether, the masking and social distancing might have done a bit.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
It had in 1918 during the influenza pandemic.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
But you have to start it early.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Once you get past a certain level of infections, it's not going to make any difference.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
There's just too much virus out there.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
So, I mean, that's a reasonable thing to do.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
And that was to bias time and a short lockdown.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
One, no more than two weeks.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
There's too much virus.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Too much virus out there.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Too much viral drug.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
That is the plan.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
And a drug that is safe enough that you can use it in outpatients.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
You don't have to be on the hospital to use it.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Okay?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
A drug that's safe enough.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
Your doctor can just write you a prescription after a phone interview.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Okay?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
And not worry about check on you.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
The doctor that knows you that you're assigned like for his general practice, family practice.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
So, we had a drug.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The people upstairs came down and gave me a piece of paper that said that the Chinese were buying millions.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I mean, they were manufacturing tons of a drug called chloroquine.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So, that's an antiviral.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So, the wonders of modern computers.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It takes you about five minutes to pull up every paper on chloroquine off of PubMed,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
the National Library of Medicine.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And we see there's the CDC itself researchers, the old gray beards, right?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Back in like 2005.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And they had found in tissue culture that it just blocks the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The COVID-19 virus, we'll call it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It blocks it.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Well, holy cow, if you can block replication early while you're an outpatient for you to sicken up,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
you have to give breathless and come to hospital.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Well, dude, you just solved the pandemic problem.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
This is going to be a bad flu season.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
But with any pandemic, there's always two major factors.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The organism itself that's causing the pandemic and the social response to it.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And in this case, we had seriously a perfect treatment.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Three years on the overwhelming evidence because people kept using it.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
One in 20 Americans still used it throughout the pandemic.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Successfully, which shows you the level of trust in our federal health.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
It's causing the pandemic.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And the social response to it.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And in this case, we had.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Seriously.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
A perfect treatment.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Three years on.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The overwhelming evidence because people kept using it.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
One in 20 Americans still used it throughout the pandemic.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Successfully.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The FDA originally.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Started.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Badmouling hydroxychloroquine.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
And.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Pete Navarro had managed to get 62 million doses.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I don't know if he stole it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I don't know what he did, but suddenly he had 62 million doses.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
He and.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Well, Catholic and Asper work together.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And they were in the national stockpile ready.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
They were going out to the pharmacies.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know, Cardinal McKenzie.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
There's like three or four companies that deliver pharmaceuticals out to your local pharmacies.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And they were already surging that doctors were writing prescriptions in New York.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
This stuff was working.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
There was no signs of any, any, and these were early within the first seven days of feeling symptoms.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That's when any drug has it's not any infection.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So when it has its maximum effect, you get a paper cut.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Oh, no, I'm not going to do anything. It gets infected.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
No, I'm not going to do anything.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And then eventually we're cutting your hand off.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Because it's gone gangrenous, right?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So the earlier you treat any infectious disease.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The better it's going to be.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The more affecting the drug work.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Once you end up in hospital with COVID.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And you're short of breath, which brings them in.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Your lungs are already involved.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And if it keeps going, you've got about four days.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Once you start shortness of breath.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And then you're going to migrate into like sepsis, which.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Depending on the organism can have a 70% mortality rate.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Okay.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Once you go on that ventilator, this is not, not a good idea.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Because that makes things worse.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So the idea was to.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Surge.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
This drug out to the pharmacy.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You had to have it on a prescription.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So that was all about enforcing the fact that, that COVID was super deadly, right?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He said, once you're in the hospital with COVID, you can get like sepsis and stuff.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So is that still happening now?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Is, did he, does he think that that happened everywhere?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Where, where's the evidence for that?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Like.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You see what I'm talking about here?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
There's a real.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Huge, wonderful.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Campfire story being told here with very little details, like almost the start of a movie, you know, with a little narration.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Or a little scroll going up into infinity.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It's, it's ridiculous.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Um, yeah.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.000
He said nothing about woodcock and bright yet, but I have woodcock and bright written down because I also know that Navarro.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Seems to think that woodcock and bright used in EUA for hydroxychloroquine to discourage doctors from using it prophylactically.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Um, because then pharmacists wouldn't give it out because pharmacists, when they were told that there was an emergency use authorization given for hydroxychloroquine to be used in the hospital,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:21.000
they could be bamboozled into believing that that also meant that if a doctor prescribed it over the counter or for prophylactic use that, that you as a pharmacist would kind of be obliged to say, no, there's an emergency use authorization for that in the hospitals.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And then that emergency use authorization, I think was, or the trials that they did at least were for too high a concentration and given too late.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So I don't know exactly how that narrative goes, but that's another one of these things where again, it just gets this, it gets this, these wheels turning where you're no longer questioning whether or not that whole reason for needing hydroxychloroquine is real or not.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Or you stop questioning what is causing the need for hydroxychloroquine, let's say it that way.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You just assume that it must be a virus, maybe it's a lab leak.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And so that's why it went bad because they lied to us about what would work.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Oh, otherwise everything would have been fine or better.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000
But then that doesn't question the novel virus, it doesn't question that millions were dead and it doesn't question that millions could have been saved.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It doesn't question whether MR and A work tonight, yet these guys are never even not even close to that.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And there's certainly not questioning whether the virus can come again. What a wonderful faith testament this is.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It had, it was a physiological effect, it slightly prolonged your heartbeat.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But it had been doing that for 50 years and there was never any overwhelming cardiac epidemics or reverse reactions.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It was just something noted, if you wired them up to an ECG, sometimes they're prolonged the length of the heartbeat.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So these were searched out and doctors were using that and they kept using that because it was effective.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And Janet Woodcock, who was the head of cedar at the moment, the FDA drug advisory committee safety.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:19.000
She phoned Rick Bright at Barda, biological advanced research development agency authority, whatever they call it, where who was controlling the stockpile and said, look, this drug is dangerous.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It's going to kill thousands. If these Republicans let it go out.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Brides, not a doctor, he's a PhD in vaccines.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
He couldn't read an ECG if his life depended on it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Nor is he a pharmacologist, nor is he a pathologist.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Okay, he's.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I think I caught it.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I think I'd see what they're doing in this thing right here and it's very, very clever.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So we've got the details that Woodcock and Bright were involved in distracting us from hydroxychloroquine.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That's what he's going to say.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And now he's trying to assert what the motivation was and who was motivating who with what or who told who to do what, who convinced who to believe what, who was the naive one in this.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And you're going to hear a very, very, and I wonder if I, if, if he's a tonic is still in the chat, because if he is, I think he's, if he's listening, he should really listen right now.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm going to go back about 10 more seconds.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Do it one more time for any, whatever they call it.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Well, who was controlling the stockpile and said, look, this drug is dangerous. It's going to kill thousands.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
If these Republicans let it go out.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And, um, Brides, not a doctor, he's a PhD in vaccines.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:06.000
He could read an ECG of his life dependent on it, nor is he a pharmacologist, nor is he a pathologist.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Okay, he's scientists are bureaucrats.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Very narrow field, vaccinology.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So he, he just took what Woodcock said.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And, uh, instead of getting a investigational drug authority, some of our friends overseas gave us the hydroxychloroquine.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
But it was with the understanding that it wasn't going to be sold on the market.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Okay, because we, we use the drug for like rheumatoid arthritis.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
For a condition called systemic lupus erythromatosis.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
For a disorder called, uh, sarcoid.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It has a powerful effect in some of other diseases, and it's always proven itself to be very safe.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Grandma's taking it at the same dose that we wanted to give.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Young people, old people.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Okay, kids we didn't worry about because the data was showing that like they don't really get sick.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Okay.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
They, um, they just like maybe they're like.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Cross and irritable for a day, most of them, unless there's something really seriously wrong with the child like a teen or something like that.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
They just kind of get sick for a day or two, shrug it off and they've got permanent immunity, at least for months until the virus changes.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So it wasn't really a problem.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Young adults were getting sick and missing a couple of days work.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Okay, so as far as I'm concerned, I don't know when he's going to stop.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So I'm going to just say it right now, but I think that this is this is probably incorrect.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And the reason why I think it's incorrect is if I recall correctly, there is a at least one interview with Rick Bright, where he's a little bit annoyed with, uh, hydroxy chloroquine.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And, um, I also seem to recall what I said earlier, which is that Woodcock and Bright used an EUA.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:18.000
It was characterized as that, that Bright and Woodcock were characterized by Navarro, I think, as having spoken in a meeting and said to one another,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000
how can we, you know, put hydroxy chloroquine out of plane and, or something to that effect?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And the way that they decided to do it was to give it an EUA for in-hospital use.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And that EUA for in-hospital use could be directly or indirectly used to imply to pharmacies around the world and are around the United States,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:56.000
that over-the-counter distribution of hydroxy chloroquine and, and prophylactic prescription of it would be kind of contrary to this emergency use authorization.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Even though it was already a pre-approved available, you know, it's on the list of things that doctors can prescribe and it doesn't really matter why they do it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But remember, this is a pandemic.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It is a national security priority.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
All bets are off here.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:30.000
If we have to save people in the hospital, we don't want people just wasting hydroxy chloroquine because they're panicking over what they saw on television.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And so the emergency use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine in hospitals did not result in its use because it wasn't on the CDC protocols,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
but it did result in clinical trials.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You see the game that Rick Bright played in order to make hydroxy chloroquine essentially be on equal or even worse footing than Remdesivir?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's my understanding that Rick Bright had a much more active role in the opposition to hydroxy chloroquine being used.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And it makes perfect sense if, as what, what Peter, or what, yeah, what, what Stephen Hadfield just said that Cadlick was also involved in Navarro's acquisition of doses of hydroxy chloroquine.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So now already that Rick Bright had been demoted.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Maybe it was in, in even more of a thing for Rick Bright.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I could have those two time frames mixed up there.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Maybe he got demoted after this, this whole thing with hydroxy chloroquine happened.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I'm not sure.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But I think this is interesting because I think we're not talking about Remdesivir here when in reality, the, the reason and one of the most important reasons why hydroxy chloroquine, even as a lash ditch effort, couldn't be allowed to be out there.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Don't forget Dr. Zelenko was using it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Don't forget Dr. Zelenko treated lots of people in Congress with it.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But they couldn't let that go mainstream.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:37.000
They made that seem to be something that, that, that Trump was advocating for and therefore half the country was want not to do it.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
That was a magic, that was a magic enchantment you might have forgotten.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But by Trump saying the word, half of the country was sure they weren't ever going to use it.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And all those pharmacists, well they know.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
That's magic, ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
That's modern magic. That's how it works.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And that's what this is. This is still in a continuation of the enchantment over and over again.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The pink letters.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
There was a novel virus for which we had to do something.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Millions died and millions were saved.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Gain a function is real and a virus will come again.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But they were, I mean this thing had less than a 1% death rate.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It was an incapacitating agent, if anything.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The older people, the people.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It was an incapacitating agent, if anything. I mean, who else uses those terms?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Who else uses those terms? I mean, come on, could this get any more comical here?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Hypertension, obesity, cardiac disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, these type of things.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Yeah.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Rancid yellow's wife worked on hydroxychloroquine for 20 years.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I mean, sorry, Ivermectin for 20 years.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Chronic diseases, it was killing them. This is where most of our deaths came from.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's called comorbidities.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So this would be the targeted population.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Probably you would want to get these people on this drug early.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Some of them had heart problems. A lot of old people have heart problems.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So that would be the doctor's choice, right? Targeted distribution.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So that was the plan.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Where was the plan?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Maybe he's talking about hydroxychloroquine for old people.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Sorry, I was a little bit confused there for a second.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I think that's what he's talking about.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
He seemed to be able to find the plan.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And now there's people trying to.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Saying that this drug is dangerous.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And it should only be given in hospital.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So instead of an investigation on new drug authority.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Barda and the FDA come out with what's called an emergency use authorization.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Here we go.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And with the proviso, this needs to be given in hospital, not as an outpatient.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Well, if you're in hospital, you're in the second phase of the disease.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
If you're three days into the hospital.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You're in sepsis. There's no drug that's going to work for that properly.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Well, Dr. Fauci added his drug remdesivir.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And he came in and told the president of the United States that.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It looked like they could have a vaccine pretty quickly.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
President doesn't go to medical school.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Right.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So it seems to me that that really absolved Rick Bright of any role in advocating for remdesivir.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I really do.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And I'm not, I just think it removed Rick, Rick Bright on purpose.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Like there was no reason to tell a story about, about specifically woodcock calling Bright to warn him that hydroxychloricone will kill thousands because of its cardiac effects and then to make fun of Rick Bright because he couldn't read a cardiac P wave if, you know,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
that right there is a dead giveaway.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
That you are being enchanted.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:34.000
He's, he's taking Rick Bright out on out of the, the loop of responsibility on purpose and specifically out of the loop of responsibility for remdesivir.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And instead tying it solely around the neck of Fauci, which essentially cuts its connection all the way back to.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Cina Bovari.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Because if you just say it was Fauci who had remdesivir, you don't connect it to Cina Bovari.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
If you say that Rick Bright was also advocating for it, now there's wheels turning.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
That mean what, wait, who, where did it come from then and who was involved in it before.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Oh, wait, I see it goes back this direction.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Oh, I see marks links matter if you go this direction, but if you go to Fauci, it's just kind of this dead end.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Thirty eight year dead end of a little guy in an office.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
This is magical.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Because that's where we're at.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That's how clearly we can see the bricks.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
He's got what was given to him as the top people in the country.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
He doesn't know if they're frank idiots or conflicts of interest or what.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Some of them have been in the government for years.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So not being a doctor wouldn't you assume that these people know what they're doing.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Well, and I refuse to believe this till probably about near the end of 2020.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I couldn't believe what was happening.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And I came out of the White House 3rd of February, 2020.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I left after the translation.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
In fact, they threw us out.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So we were the last to leave.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
So fighting this thing.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So now all the doctors, you know, you come home, you've seen 40 patients, private practice are done.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
You know, two bypasses or whatever.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You're tired, right?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
You want to kick your feet up.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
You want to catch up on the news.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You don't want to read a medical journal.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
You want supper, play with the kids, go to bed, repeat.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Right?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Sure.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You've got patients counting on you to be at your best.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Okay.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Turn on your news.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And there were a couple faulty studies, but never should have made it through what we call peer review.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I mean, they were, they were just garbage.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
The first paper came out of Brazil with hydroxychloroquine.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And you're looking at the dose.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
He just, they gave these people a lethal dose.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It's cumulative, right?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Hydroxychloroquine stays in your body quite a while.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And now you're doing another obscene dose and then another obscene,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and it built up to toxic levels and all the patients were dying and they're wondering, oh, well.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And so again, the argument is, is that we needed something in hydroxychloroquine might have been it,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
but they covered it all up.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And that, again, doesn't change the narrative of a novel virus that millions of people died from

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
and millions of people could have been saved from.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It's exactly the narrative.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And by talking about this over and over again, he's reinforcing the faith with Tommy and all of his viewers.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And they think they're having a very lively debate within this controlled spectrum.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And so therefore it feels like there's something solved here.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
If I agree with those two guys, then what is it?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's a consensus of three.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Tommy apparently agrees with Stephen, who am I to argue?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And the spell is cast.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And they're going to keep doing this.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Unfortunately, I can tell you that tomorrow that we're going to have to watch this.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I wish that would, maybe I can refresh this and then that will be there again.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I can pause it.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
No, why is it playing automatically?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Oh, it's rumble.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Damn it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yeah, this happened.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And I'm pretty sure that the presentation of the DNA contamination and the ways that it's detected will be sound.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But I'm also pretty sure that we won't talk about the PCR fraud.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
We won't talk about testing fraud.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
We won't talk about the RNA contamination and then the impurities.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
We won't talk about codon optimization and protein folding.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
We're not going to talk about RNA, G protein or G quadriplexes.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We're not going to talk about premature stop codons due to pseudoridine.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We're not going to talk about any of the other possibilities to do with lipid nanoparticles coagulating

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:47.000
or any of the other possibles, millions of possibilities perhaps of the ways that those things can be toxic

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
if they're manufactured correctly or incorrectly.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:58.000
We're not going to talk about any of those things and we're going to focus exclusively on the DNA contamination

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and the possibilities of all the DNA that's there.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
If it's SV40 or this enhancer or that enhancer, they're going to tell us stories

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:16.000
about what that DNA makes the transfections possible to do.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
But they're going to try and rope in everything into that.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That is the goal.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And the bait and switch is going to be that it's very enticing because

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
we need something that I could go back to my brother and say,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
hey man, I know you didn't believe a lot of the stuff I was saying about masks and about the virus and stuff

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
but I mean, can you see that there's DNA in the shot and that's pretty bad?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And it's very tempting.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
It's really very tempting to think that that's how it's going to go.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.000
That it's going to be the first sort of thing that will start to really open people's minds

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
and then we can get them all the way over the finish line.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
But that's not the plan.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
That's not where the Scooby-Doo mystery is going to go.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000
But that is where they want you to believe that making this choice will lead to.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:28.000
If we just all rally behind these guys and make sure that this DNA contamination is removed

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000
and we regulate the industry so that this is a new thing that we're aware of and it's a standard

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
or maybe we don't even use these silly bacteria anymore.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
That's what this is about.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
It's about whitewashing the idea that transfection was a bad idea.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Just like Vay John Health, Philip McMillan, the acolyte of Robert Malone was saying.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
We should have used this technology a little bit more carefully and selectively.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And we should have been more careful with how we made it.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
If we regulate these products a little better next time, if we use a little more quality control,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:27.000
if we just use fluorometry instead of PCR, everything would have been fine.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
That's where this is going.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So any who I'll just wrap it up real quick to say that this faith is an illusion of consensus.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
This is what these people were sent to do.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And it's only become clear to me in 2023 that this is the case because that's how elaborate the scheme was.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
We were surrounded.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And I think actually in many ways we remain surrounded.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And so it is of utmost importance that we continue to remain honest and vigilant, but we are still surrounded.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
They basically have us check mated.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
They control all the important things and they demonstrated how check mated we are

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
by what they were able to perform over the last three years.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And now we are entering a time of even probably more strife and chaos because of all of the polarization that will occur around the election that's coming.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So I think this holiday season, Thanksgiving, I mean, even Halloween coming up, Thanksgiving and Christmas, these holidays might be the time for us to really try and one more time break through

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:00.000
with some of our family and friends and send out a

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
peace offering that has more to do with help.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And maybe that's the reason why the DNA could help us because these people will finally realize that they'll have an out where it's not my fault.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
But it's a false out.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:26.000
That's the thing I don't like about it. It's a lie to say to my neighbors that, well, now that we know that there's DNA in there, now do you believe me that it was bad?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And that DNA wasn't supposed to be in there.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Does that really telling them the truth?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I don't think it is. I think it's a lie.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It's a lie just about what happened over time about a novel virus.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
It's a lie.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I think that's, I don't know how else to say it. I think Mike Eden is right. You got to say that this faith is a lie.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And you then you can see these people defend it.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And, and, and that's where this all comes down. It's, it's just.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:27.000
We've got to save our children from this, ladies and gentlemen, the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine. That's just the way it is. That's the truth.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And they're not addressing so much in order to preserve the faith.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And in order to trap our children.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I don't know. It's, it's hard sometimes to really be, to be completely positive.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
But there is all kinds of exciting things coming in the future.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:03.000
One thing I'm really excited about actually is that we are only a few days away from Halloween, which I'm really excited about.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I'm going to go back on YouTube live on Halloween.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And it's kind of a special surprise, not unlike my voice, but a different surprise.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And the month of November has some very interesting things happening, including Thanksgiving, of course.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:31.000
It's going to get cooler outside. And then, of course, we have December.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Yeah, there's a lot of things coming, my friends, but December is when the book comes out.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And when the book comes out, I think we're going to have some additional pieces on the board that we can play.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And I'm really, really excited about that. So it's just a matter of keeping the steady pressure.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'm not sure if this is 47 or 48 or what it is.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
But we're going, and we're going to keep on going.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Don't forget that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And transfection is not immunization, so please stop it, because we really, really, really don't need it.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah, that's it. I'll see you guys probably tomorrow, as usual, because that's what we do here.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
We stream every day.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It's been really fun.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I am happy to report. I have three days of pretty dang good sleep.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And my throat still feels pretty good. I do think that it's settling in a little deeper than it was yesterday.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
But like I said, this is just where we are now after a vocal cord hemorrhage.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Thank goodness we are closer to healthy. At least that's what I think.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I'm going to keep drinking lots of honey and apple cider vinegar, and I have this throat coat tea, and I have a bunch of other stuff.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I'll take care of it as best I can.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Keep my gain on my microphone up.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Thanks for joining me guys. We'll see you tomorrow.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Tomorrow is 50. Oh my goodness. That's exciting. What is tomorrow? It's tomorrow Thursday or Wednesday?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Tuesday, Wednesday. Okay. Oh my goodness. I'm excited.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Wednesday is 50. Oh my goodness. This is really great.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Okay guys, man. I'm so happy. Thanks guys.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:52.000
It does feel really good though to have my voice back. I gotta tell you, every morning when I wake up, it's about twice as deep as this too.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.000
My wife is telling me to be quiet in the bedroom. It's funny.
