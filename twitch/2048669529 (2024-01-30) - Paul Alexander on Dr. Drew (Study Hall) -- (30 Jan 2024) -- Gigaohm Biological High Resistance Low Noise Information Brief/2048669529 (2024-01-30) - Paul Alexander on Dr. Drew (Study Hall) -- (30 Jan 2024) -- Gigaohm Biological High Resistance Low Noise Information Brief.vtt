00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
You

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
You

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
You

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Schedule for 60 minutes next

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
It's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's embarrassing

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
It's so crazy

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I feel so nervous

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Like what in the world man?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm here chatting into the wind with the microphone on mute

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Let's use a little knowledge to dispel a little enchantment tonight

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Shall we?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's be like Galileo

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
We are going to do a little bit of just study hall tonight

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
Here I've got Calvary and some of his physicists

04:16.000 --> 04:21.880
We are going to go live via dialic

04:21.880 --> 04:28.600
We are gonna do a little bit of just study hall tonight. We're gonna take a look at a character on the stage

04:29.440 --> 04:33.320
The character who's been on the stage for a while and I want to get a good read

04:33.760 --> 04:40.080
On what's happening here? I forgot to save my line. You listen to me little man. You listen to me

04:40.680 --> 04:45.440
Little rascal. I'll tell you a thing or two point point poke poke

04:47.880 --> 04:49.880
Anyway

04:52.840 --> 04:59.880
I'm afraid we have been bamboozled for a very long time actually it's probably our parents who are bamboozled

04:59.880 --> 05:02.840
I know my parents were my parents are still bamboozled

05:04.800 --> 05:10.040
But they were bamboozled since I was a child it just wasn't as dangerous to be bamboozled back then

05:22.880 --> 05:26.880
It wasn't as dangerous to be bamboozled back then

05:31.240 --> 05:37.320
I don't know if that's really the right way to put it, but I do think there are more dangerous for parents nowadays than ever

05:39.200 --> 05:41.200
You could have your

05:41.200 --> 05:43.200
doctor prescribed you

05:43.200 --> 05:44.960
Kid Merelax

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
You could have your doctor

05:47.520 --> 05:51.920
Recommend the flu shot every year you could have your doctor recommend HPV early

05:52.960 --> 05:58.680
There are lots of crazy stuff in America and the Bamboozleman definitely goes back generations

05:59.560 --> 06:03.080
They've been laying that on thick and deep for a very long time

06:05.280 --> 06:12.240
Ladies and gentlemen, this stream is brought to you by a patch climb a physiologist that means I used to be a microscope jockey and

06:13.760 --> 06:16.720
I was pretty good at aligning a

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
condenser and

06:19.160 --> 06:22.160
Pretty good at doing surgery on tiny little

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
Tiny little mammals

06:26.920 --> 06:33.600
Anyway when I made my recordings the the electrical resistance of those recordings was targeted toward a giga home

06:34.480 --> 06:39.680
And so it's not named after back to the future. We're not talking about a giga watt

06:40.240 --> 06:44.880
We're talking about giga homes, and this is a high-resistance low-noise information brief

06:44.880 --> 06:51.280
Which is centered from giga home biological.com. You can also talk to me at giga home dot bio

06:51.760 --> 06:57.320
You can find my confession to how dumb I was for how long I was dumb at the Scooby link and

06:58.200 --> 07:02.320
You can support me at one time donation at support giga home there

07:02.320 --> 07:06.080
And you can also scroll down and find a schedule and a place to subscribe

07:06.600 --> 07:12.320
And subscribing is what I would prefer I guess I'm gonna set up a patreon because a friend of mine says I should

07:12.640 --> 07:17.440
But essentially $10 a month as a subscriber there is a similar thing

07:18.560 --> 07:22.760
And it allows me to keep my PDF library up there

07:22.760 --> 07:26.200
Which we will start to add to starting on Friday this week

07:26.720 --> 07:32.520
Put out our first PDF summarizing the last week of work or at least that's the eventual

07:33.920 --> 07:38.120
Plan here are the people the active supporters the people that make this possible

07:38.120 --> 07:47.240
Sometimes this the names will be a little bit larger. These are people who've given more subscribe multiple times

07:47.240 --> 07:51.240
Whatever, you can imagine some people like Greg have gone above and beyond

07:52.760 --> 07:54.920
I mean if I had five people like Greg

07:55.640 --> 08:01.800
I probably doing two shows a day one of them from a from a drone car or something like that, but anyway

08:02.600 --> 08:05.320
Here we are. I'm grateful for every one of you

08:05.560 --> 08:08.560
This is the independent bright web of course, you know

08:08.840 --> 08:15.520
We've been trying to build a new network of people that we can trust by just looking at how our work works in parallel

08:15.520 --> 08:20.120
I don't have to have a bunch of people on or we don't have to cross promote each other all that much

08:20.120 --> 08:22.120
All we have to do is be an agreement that

08:22.480 --> 08:27.400
this basic scenario that was given to us on television is a bunch of nonsense and

08:28.120 --> 08:32.560
The biology that they say supports this idea is just not there

08:32.560 --> 08:39.280
And we've been doing a lot of work to try and crack this faith in a novel virus, and I think that work is finally paying off

08:40.240 --> 08:42.240
I don't know if we're gonna figure out

08:42.640 --> 08:46.600
Real early whether it's a completed background signal or whatever

08:46.600 --> 08:50.120
But I do know that they are ignoring these three

08:51.440 --> 08:56.560
Statements, especially the first two. It's pretty funny. This is Giga oh my logical

08:59.280 --> 09:01.280
I thought it was gonna come in right there

09:03.560 --> 09:05.560
There it is

09:07.240 --> 09:12.080
Yes, thank you Greg, but also thank you Rodney and thank you Stefan Kohn and

09:13.120 --> 09:15.320
There's been a lot of people coming through

09:16.600 --> 09:21.720
Recently, I'm thinking of a couple other people and it's annoying that those names are coming to my mind

09:21.720 --> 09:23.720
But the reason why is very good

09:25.280 --> 09:31.880
My wife has started to help out with communicating with subscribers and trying to get questions and

09:32.240 --> 09:38.040
Suggestions to me in a way that doesn't take up and it's hard to write

09:38.240 --> 09:41.080
Nice emails and take the time to talk to people

09:41.080 --> 09:47.160
And I don't have time to do that and produce a stream every night and my wife has decided to help them that so a couple hours

09:47.160 --> 09:53.320
And every night she's either doing it in the morning or right before she goes to sleep in the bed, which I really like

09:54.760 --> 09:57.800
But a lot of times he's going to sleep before I'm done with this

09:57.800 --> 10:03.120
And so she is contacting those people and thanking them and it's working out really really well

10:03.120 --> 10:08.320
This is the faith we're trying to fight. I should turn this down because I think that's kind of a copyrighted song

10:09.760 --> 10:11.760
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this and

10:12.680 --> 10:14.680
And go like that. I

10:16.320 --> 10:22.840
Think it's really important to see where we are we haven't changed this slide in a long time because it's really like dead on

10:22.920 --> 10:29.520
Accurate we haven't changed this slide and quite some time. I think because it's really dead on accurate. There is a spectacular

10:30.520 --> 10:34.680
Commitment to lies going on it is it is it is impressive

10:37.800 --> 10:42.200
It really is impressive, but we are over the target ladies and gentlemen, so have no fear

10:43.080 --> 10:44.880
Have no fear

10:44.880 --> 10:47.440
That's what I would say have no fear

10:52.840 --> 10:59.960
There it is the starship enterprise

11:02.440 --> 11:04.440
My

11:04.440 --> 11:09.520
alternative background when zooming from my garage sometimes I don't like people to see this

11:10.520 --> 11:14.880
My old drafting table and my funny my funny video game

11:15.440 --> 11:19.520
And so I put this up instead and that really jives very well with me

11:19.920 --> 11:23.400
Because I never really watched Star Trek that much to be honest it it I

11:24.160 --> 11:26.160
Feel like it's a really nice cloak

11:26.880 --> 11:33.720
If you want my confession, there is a Star Wars game over there and there's if you look right there

11:33.720 --> 11:36.760
That's actually it's actually a lightsaber

11:37.960 --> 11:41.040
Shame to admit and then there's another one at the top of that

11:41.120 --> 11:45.200
There's a red one and a green one that I could turn on but the batteries will die quick

11:46.040 --> 11:50.520
So I'm actually that kind of geek not a Star Wars Star Trek geek

11:50.520 --> 11:57.280
but it's just kind of funny to me and again because a very good friend of mine was on the next generation once and

11:57.560 --> 11:59.560
Then also got to play a Borg

12:00.160 --> 12:03.360
in the in the card series

12:04.440 --> 12:12.840
Unfortunately, she is passed away now because I believe she was more or less coerced to taking multiple shots in order to be on set

12:13.080 --> 12:15.080
as an actor in

12:15.640 --> 12:17.400
in California

12:17.400 --> 12:19.560
So there's lots of stories that people have

12:20.200 --> 12:26.720
But there are a lot of untold stories. Yeah, because of how early they push these and so there are a lot of people by

12:27.240 --> 12:30.680
happenstance or circumstance or on their third or fourth shot and

12:31.280 --> 12:36.840
We have to have a lot of sympathy for those people because they thought they were doing the right thing people on TV told them

12:36.840 --> 12:41.080
They were doing the right thing people on social media told them they were doing the right thing

12:41.560 --> 12:46.360
And so we can't we can't be judgmental of anybody that's made decisions. It's it's

12:47.000 --> 12:52.440
It's gonna be up to them to to reconcile even what they did with their children

12:53.160 --> 12:56.960
But we need to be very very firm in

12:57.520 --> 12:58.680
our

12:58.680 --> 13:01.880
understanding and belief or belief and understanding in the sense of

13:02.440 --> 13:04.440
We need to be ready and able

13:04.440 --> 13:07.040
To provide the truth when the truth is required

13:07.200 --> 13:09.840
And I'm not saying you have to throw it in people's faces

13:09.840 --> 13:15.960
But when people ask for the truth we need to be prepared to give it and to be able to present it in such a way

13:16.120 --> 13:18.880
That when the window is open that we climb through it

13:19.520 --> 13:24.480
And so you don't want to be unprepared and there are lots of things to talk about

13:24.480 --> 13:30.040
There are lots of questions to ask that will not free those people from this mythology

13:30.200 --> 13:33.520
It will not allow them to climb out the window themselves

13:33.520 --> 13:39.680
And so you don't want to get caught in an argument or a discussion that you think oh wow

13:39.680 --> 13:43.520
This is gonna be great. They're gonna finally they're gonna finally snap out of it

13:43.520 --> 13:47.240
There are lots of arguments that won't snap people out of it

13:47.240 --> 13:52.680
And I think that's why I want to watch this this interview today because I suspect

13:53.240 --> 13:55.240
the dr. Drew and

13:55.960 --> 14:00.000
Paul Alexander and some of these other people

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I

14:02.440 --> 14:07.880
Don't know who but I suspect that some of these people have been let's say

14:10.600 --> 14:14.520
They have been coached coerced encouraged by

14:15.080 --> 14:20.240
Comfort and fame and fortune to omit avoid

14:22.040 --> 14:28.400
Focus on certain things and I don't know if dr. Drew is one of these people

14:28.400 --> 14:33.640
I don't know if dr. Paul Alexander is one of these people, I don't know if Robert Malone is one of these people

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
I'm not one of these people

14:38.560 --> 14:42.820
I have a fairly good idea that Jessica Hockett is not one of these people

14:42.820 --> 14:47.020
I have a fairly good idea that mark Kalak is not one of these people

14:47.020 --> 14:50.320
I have a fairly good idea that Nick Hudson might not be one of these people

14:50.560 --> 14:54.720
I have a fairly good idea that Jonathan Engler might not want to be one of these people

14:54.720 --> 14:59.000
I have a fairly good idea that Martin Neil might not want to be one of these people.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.160
I even have a hunch, I even have a hunch that it's possible that some of these people that

15:06.160 --> 15:12.320
everybody says are definitely a medler are not some of these people.

15:12.320 --> 15:18.440
We don't need very many real medlers that are taking the money and helping with the

15:18.440 --> 15:23.920
decisions and taking phone calls in order for there be to the appearance of there to

15:23.920 --> 15:27.000
be many many medlers.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.280
And I've used this train analogy a lot and I've used your kids getting on a train.

15:32.280 --> 15:37.000
I've used people faking, stopping and starting a train and I've also used the analogy of

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
a tug of war and please think carefully about the bigger the tug of war is the more people

15:44.000 --> 15:49.520
that are pulling on each side of the rope, the less of a fraction of the total pull on

15:49.520 --> 15:53.800
either side of the rope is contributed by a single person.

15:53.800 --> 16:00.840
And therefore it becomes easier and easier for people to sabotage a team and it doesn't

16:00.840 --> 16:06.800
take very many people to sabotage a team in a tug of war.

16:06.800 --> 16:13.840
And so I really want to encourage people to be careful as we move forward and be sure

16:13.840 --> 16:19.680
that you are aware that you can ask the wrong questions and you can ask the wrong

16:19.680 --> 16:24.480
questions for a very long time and it can feel like a very vigorous debate but you

16:24.480 --> 16:29.720
will be having a very vigorous debate with it a limited spectrum that will not lead you

16:29.720 --> 16:31.600
out of the cave.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.440
And I hope that's not what we see here but I do think it's very possible.

16:35.440 --> 16:42.000
For right now I'm going to leave it at normal speed because Dr. Paul Alexander is from Trinidad

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
to Bago.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.320
I don't know how to say where he's from correctly maybe I just did.

16:47.320 --> 16:53.280
And his island accent is very well it's challenging for me if I speed it up.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.400
Let me just say it like that.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.160
So I might speed it up a little bit but I'm not going to put it at 2x.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.160
Welcome everyone.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.160
We are in prime form.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.160
Technically today.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.160
That was loud.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
Sorry.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.920
So today we are welcoming back to Dr. Paul Alexander.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.640
It's a great day to have to be able to make the reasons to make the coincidence it turns

17:10.720 --> 17:14.800
out he was last here on January 11th, 2023.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.600
So it's exactly one year to the day that we have him in here and it is on the heels

17:19.600 --> 17:25.120
of Dr. Fauci's interview in front of the House Subcommittee on Coronavirus in which he talked

17:25.120 --> 17:30.560
about the fact that the six foot social distancing was not scientific it just something that

17:30.560 --> 17:38.400
appeared shocking that he continues to sort of skate with that admission.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.600
And what was the other one?

17:39.600 --> 17:43.080
There was some other thing that I did that I'm not sure he actually even said it but we'll

17:43.080 --> 17:47.480
get to that and other other things without Alexander who's of course an epidemiologist.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.320
He was a research methodology teacher assistant professor McMaster University.

17:52.320 --> 17:58.720
He is an evidence based medicines and research researcher we'll get to his all his details

17:58.720 --> 18:02.720
but he was there and many of these decisions were made at the NIH and he will give us that

18:02.720 --> 18:05.760
report again and his new thoughts after this.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.240
Oh here we go.

18:07.240 --> 18:14.400
Our laws as a pertain to substances are draconian and bizarre and thinning look because it runs

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
in pieces.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.480
They gave me a services department as I said he was there when any of these decisions

18:20.480 --> 18:21.480
were what.

18:21.480 --> 18:29.000
All right as I was saying Dr. Paul Alexander was at the Health and Human Services department

18:29.000 --> 18:34.720
where he was a former senior advisor to COVID for COVID pandemic policy as I said he was

18:34.720 --> 18:37.400
there when many of these decisions were made.

18:37.400 --> 18:43.040
The other thing I was trying to think of that Fauci had said was that the lab leak theories

18:43.040 --> 18:48.880
no longer is not a conspiracy theory at shocking that he would say that and finally his quote

18:48.880 --> 18:56.400
actually was social distancing recommendations forced on American quote sort of just appeared

18:56.400 --> 19:04.440
and were not science but not based likely not based on scientific data likely likely.

19:04.440 --> 19:12.880
I would just ask him to direct me towards one document one document that substantiated

19:12.880 --> 19:19.400
six feet for an aerosolized virus is looking you know so many of these excesses that happened

19:19.400 --> 19:25.480
during COVID are looking worse and worse as time goes on.

19:25.480 --> 19:30.600
We know it's an aerosol so we know that wearing a mask with a slight jet here that steams up

19:30.600 --> 19:35.880
your glasses is going to increase the aerosol and spread it further distances you're not

19:35.880 --> 19:39.560
only not protecting somebody else you are increasing the number of people you're going

19:39.560 --> 19:48.480
to expose and that the surgical masks because it's an aerosol of course spit fluid inconsequential

19:48.480 --> 19:52.360
in the transmission of this particular respiratory virus.

19:52.360 --> 20:00.520
So Dr. Paul Alexander is an epidemiologist he's a researcher he's he has a PhD I believe

20:00.520 --> 20:05.600
in left to tell me whether it's epidemiology or not please welcome Dr. Paul Alexander what

20:05.600 --> 20:11.080
is your PhD and exactly I don't have the information right here Paul.

20:11.080 --> 20:17.720
Hi Drew thanks for having me and your team once again tremendous sure as always and my

20:17.720 --> 20:25.320
graduate training outside of so I did a graduate school masters at University of Toronto in

20:25.320 --> 20:31.000
epidemiology I went on talks for a little graduate degree in evidence based medicine

20:31.000 --> 20:37.320
and clinical epidemiology I did some work at Johns Hopkins a short certificate in biological

20:37.320 --> 20:43.640
warfare and epidemiology of it but my doctorate is in evidence based medicine for my doctor.

20:43.640 --> 20:50.680
Did he just say Canada? Did he just say the need of this and epidemiology Hopkins a short

20:50.680 --> 20:55.800
days medicine and clinical epidemiology. I did some work at Johns Hopkins a short

20:55.800 --> 21:03.480
certificate in biological warfare and epidemiology. Oh no that's not my reading experience medicine

21:03.480 --> 21:10.360
for Macmaster University in Canada and for those who don't know people who want to get

21:10.360 --> 21:17.000
into research methods programs at Stanford, Yale, Harvard are people who could not get

21:17.000 --> 21:22.280
into the Macmaster program. The Macmaster program is the seat of evidence based medicine

21:22.280 --> 21:27.800
globally. My doctoral supervisor was a founder of evidence based anything to do with evidence

21:27.800 --> 21:35.320
based research Dr. Gordon Riot and Dr. Dave Sackler so I did my postdoc with him also

21:35.320 --> 21:41.320
and anything to do with research research methods randomized trials, observational studies,

21:41.320 --> 21:47.400
anything to do with research generally comes out of Macmaster and we constantly refine the

21:47.400 --> 21:54.280
process and refine the methods. So that's my background training but you know I'm very,

21:54.280 --> 22:02.840
very humble that you're hardly here again and persons like Dr. McCullough, Dr. Rish, Dr. Marcus

22:02.840 --> 22:13.080
myself we provide technical scientific support to the wellness company TwC.health. Go to TwC.health

22:13.080 --> 22:18.920
take a look at the website and what they offer. It's grombic breaking revolutionary way of

22:18.920 --> 22:24.920
medicine with some good nutraceuticals etc. So I just wanted to put that on because I'm very happy

22:24.920 --> 22:31.080
to be working with them. Me too. Me too. I'm working with them too and my position on it is not just

22:31.080 --> 22:37.320
what you're describing but also that we're putting control access in the hands of patients. It's

22:37.320 --> 22:44.040
time we let patients be driving the ship but I want you at some point here to tell the story

22:44.040 --> 22:48.600
about what happened over at HHS but before we do I think the evidence based medicine topic is a

22:48.600 --> 22:57.000
perfect place to start here. I want to start with that because I don't know if your research

22:57.000 --> 23:06.120
advisors are still there at McMaster's but if they are they must be dying. What happened to

23:06.120 --> 23:13.400
evidence based medicine? How do they, it's just they must be mind-boggled as much as I am. God smacked

23:13.400 --> 23:19.080
as much as you and I are. How do they understand what has happened to our profession?

23:19.720 --> 23:27.480
Well you ask a very good question and I'm a pure scientist in the sense that again I come

23:27.480 --> 23:34.360
from that school and that program so I have to represent it in a way. Dr. Visham myself are

23:34.360 --> 23:40.600
actually almost the same in this regard. Well the problem is evidence based medicine died

23:41.720 --> 23:48.600
during COVID. It committed suicide basically because no one was really practicing evidence

23:48.600 --> 23:55.240
based medicine and evidence based research and for your listener evidence based research and

23:55.240 --> 24:04.840
medicine basically is trying to come up with decision-making that is informed by the most

24:04.840 --> 24:10.840
highest quality trustworthy evidence and it's the body of evidence that we're talking about.

24:10.840 --> 24:15.960
We're not necessarily talking about one study. We are seeing that if you give me an

24:15.960 --> 24:23.560
estimated effect for a drug in terms of its benefit or its harms we want you to look at all

24:23.560 --> 24:28.600
of the evidence, the randomized trials, the observational research, strong research,

24:28.600 --> 24:35.080
weak research and give us the best so we could have as much confidence in the estimated effect.

24:35.960 --> 24:41.400
Evidence based medicine is reproducible. The doctrine is it has to be explicit,

24:42.040 --> 24:48.920
open, transparent and that's the difference because what I'm trying to say is from about

24:48.920 --> 24:56.120
40 years ago the idea was clinicians, exceptions, surgeons were making decisions based on what

24:56.120 --> 25:03.080
their colleagues did, what their hood would and the idea was that they were not consulting the

25:03.080 --> 25:10.680
literature and the data, et cetera, to make decisions. Now I think in one way drew evidence

25:10.680 --> 25:19.560
based medicine went too far and removed too much of the decision-making from the clinician

25:19.560 --> 25:24.920
and have these clinicians reading books, running into the library to consult. No, you have to give

25:24.920 --> 25:29.880
the clinician and the clinician the clinical discretion in the decision-making too so maybe

25:29.880 --> 25:35.320
depend on them will come back a little bit but I agree with you evidence based medicine died because

25:35.320 --> 25:42.280
all of the research in COVID is basically junk I have to say research methodologically wise

25:42.280 --> 25:50.440
it cannot stand up to scientific muster really what JAMA, Landsat, BMG whatever they're publishing

25:51.800 --> 25:59.640
25 years ago if you sent it to me to review or even you as a review of an article I would I would

25:59.720 --> 26:07.400
recommend do not publish we getting stuff today that cannot normally stand up to scientific scrutiny

26:07.400 --> 26:15.000
and it's being published so it's a terrible situation for the population because and and there's another

26:15.000 --> 26:20.040
twist on it that's even more disturbing to me which is that you know that science is a dialogue

26:20.040 --> 26:25.560
it's a back and forth it's never just all one direction results don't go one way and that's that

26:25.560 --> 26:31.880
there's a there's a consensus that builds we are seeing what does get published also what doesn't

26:31.880 --> 26:38.280
get published might be something worthy of scientific scrutiny and it doesn't get published so it's

26:38.280 --> 26:44.520
being hit on both ends things not worthy are being published and things that potentially are worthy

26:44.520 --> 26:50.120
because the topic isn't any good for the reviewers or the editorial process aren't being published

26:50.120 --> 26:56.840
it's really breathtaking let me ask this I'm I'm sort of a purist scientist and I was trained in a

26:56.840 --> 27:06.040
very purist view of the scientific method and in my world I've heard this has been modified a

27:06.040 --> 27:10.840
little bit lately but you you came up with a hypothesis you designed an experiment to test

27:10.840 --> 27:18.520
that hypothesis and you tried to ask simple narrow questions that you could control and then based

27:18.520 --> 27:28.520
on that narrow question is this true or not test it and then essentially what I was reared on was

27:28.520 --> 27:36.360
do a null hypothesis that I don't see that ever being done what happened to the basic scientific

27:36.360 --> 27:43.720
method what I mean and once again I agree with you and I'm happy that your your

27:44.200 --> 27:51.880
argument is as a purist too so you understand how much it will not bother us because we understand

27:51.880 --> 27:59.160
the dirt and the and the lack the suboptimal work that's coming on of academic research now

27:59.720 --> 28:07.480
the reality is that we know the power of things like large pragmatic randomized control trials

28:07.480 --> 28:15.320
simple etc in being able to tease out cause and effect I agree with you fully that we don't have

28:15.320 --> 28:23.000
the proper comparative effectiveness research today to help us make informed decisions and

28:23.000 --> 28:29.320
this research we have is very weak and I think what has happened to us that many people mounted

28:29.320 --> 28:35.240
research in COVID and really didn't know what they were doing and they were submitting stuff

28:35.240 --> 28:40.920
to the to the journals they were violating the protocols they didn't even register protocols

28:40.920 --> 28:45.240
so we couldn't even see what they were doing and what they were not doing and like you mentioned

28:45.240 --> 28:51.240
earlier this issue of they're not publishing good stuff which is going against the narrative

28:51.240 --> 28:59.560
you know from your own expertise that we're talking about the negative negative effect studies and

29:00.520 --> 29:06.520
publication bias and we could actually see that in the research where we plot our graphs to show

29:06.520 --> 29:14.120
that what is being published is only the research that has outcomes or estimates of effect that

29:14.120 --> 29:19.880
support what the researcher wants to see positive effects they will not publish the ones that are

29:19.880 --> 29:28.840
negative which actually are very important and it's like the clinical trials done by Moderna and

29:28.840 --> 29:36.360
Pfizer they stopped the studies early for benefit they said Fauci and they said well it looks like

29:36.360 --> 29:41.560
we have a signal of benefit here so we're going to stop the trial but you and I understand

29:42.280 --> 29:46.120
Drew and many people in your audience because I really don't know who the audience is but I

29:46.120 --> 29:54.760
assume there are some of them have done this too but if you stop a study early for benefit what

29:54.760 --> 30:01.720
you are actually doing is you are risking an overestimated estimated effect that's a risk of

30:01.720 --> 30:08.760
bias we flat that why because how do you run that study to sample size that benefit that you would

30:08.760 --> 30:15.240
have seen so early on a crew would have petered out and you may not have seen the benefit downstream

30:15.240 --> 30:22.360
in fact the harms that you fail to see upstream would have probably become clearer so in the research

30:22.360 --> 30:30.680
that was produced and published by Pfizer Moderna and accepted wrongfully by the FDA to grant EAU

30:30.680 --> 30:38.680
is actually not just suboptimal but it's wrong science it cannot stand up to proper scientific

30:38.680 --> 30:45.320
scrutiny those studies are risk of bias studies none of the estimates of effect are proper they

30:45.320 --> 30:52.520
actually to me fraudulent and they use the relative risk reduction as the estimated effect

30:52.520 --> 30:59.400
when you know Drew that the estimate that we wanted the outcome measure is actually absolute

30:59.400 --> 31:05.160
risk reduction and when Pfizer says of course there's a 95 percent relative risk reduction

31:05.160 --> 31:14.440
what they do based on 170 events the absolute reduction just 0.7 you would have had that shot

31:15.000 --> 31:22.520
if a doctor would have sat you down and said listen the absolute benefit is just 0.7 percent and

31:23.480 --> 31:29.560
there's a downside because the shot carries risk the shot carries potential toxicity there's a

31:29.560 --> 31:35.000
cost to the shot there's there's uncomfortable this there might be fever you may react to the

31:35.000 --> 31:41.800
naphylaxis etc and when you wait benefits versus the harms you'd say but wait this benefit is so

31:41.800 --> 31:49.000
modest compared to actual harms that I could experience that I don't want I would avoid this shot

31:49.560 --> 31:59.240
people will never told you truth every single thing look had we done nothing through had this thing

31:59.240 --> 32:06.280
come around this is my opinion based on four years now had this thing come around in December

32:06.280 --> 32:13.400
January of 2020 and we've done nothing it is my view that we may not even have noticed this

32:13.960 --> 32:23.400
it is my view my view that had we done nothing we'd have lost far fewer people it was the response

32:24.040 --> 32:30.920
the medical management is what killed most of the people this virus did take some people drew

32:31.720 --> 32:36.840
high risk elderly we know that you are an expert I know that you're a clinician expert

32:37.560 --> 32:43.640
but when you look at the denial of treatment lockdowns the collateral damage from the lockdowns

32:43.640 --> 32:50.360
that's j-batter truck chariots expertise you look at the vaccine itself the harms from the vaccine

32:50.440 --> 32:55.720
and you look at the medical management with the isolation the sedation will puke a fall on my

32:55.720 --> 33:02.440
dazzle arm the ventilator the denial of antibody when you look at those deaths you realize we

33:02.440 --> 33:08.680
actually may have killed more people by the medical response and that's a very controversial

33:08.680 --> 33:14.680
statement to me but that's the statement I'm making I'm willing to defend it had we done nothing

33:15.640 --> 33:22.600
we'd have been back well certainly so let's uh let's take that and think about it a little bit

33:24.520 --> 33:29.000
so we kind of we came here with the wellness company

33:31.000 --> 33:34.920
and so let's start there he mentioned Harvey Reich who I think is

33:36.760 --> 33:42.040
nothing but a narrative charlatan I did have a personal interview with him

33:42.600 --> 33:49.000
and I streamed it without permission so I kind of got in trouble it was an interview

33:49.720 --> 33:57.160
that I was it was like a panel that I was on actually in a private zoom meeting run by a lady

33:57.160 --> 34:02.600
who I'm still in contact with and I still think we're friends but I did make the mistake of streaming

34:02.600 --> 34:08.600
it live without specifically saying out loud that I'm gonna stream this live and I kind of

34:09.480 --> 34:15.400
in my mind I told myself that that was okay because you know I'm a streamer and I do that but there

34:15.400 --> 34:23.720
were a lot of other people on the call and you know the people legitimately trusted that everybody

34:23.720 --> 34:27.720
wasn't going to be recording these things but if you're streaming it it's kind of recording it

34:28.920 --> 34:36.120
and so I kind of blew that now had I said that I wanted to record it or that I wanted to stream

34:36.200 --> 34:40.760
it they would have probably said no and then I wouldn't have had the interview with him

34:40.760 --> 34:46.520
and so I just thought I had to do it so anyway that's gone it's not there anymore I took it down

34:46.520 --> 34:53.240
immediately because everybody was very angry about it but in that interview Harvey Reich revealed

34:53.240 --> 35:00.280
something very strange to me which I just found to be quite a disconnect from what

35:00.920 --> 35:06.840
I guess he was saying he seemed to contradict himself almost sentence for sentence so

35:10.440 --> 35:13.480
the story that he told me was that he was that he was

35:15.880 --> 35:20.040
I'm trying to think if he was vaccinated I don't think he's vaccinated but he could be

35:21.080 --> 35:29.560
but he was also using hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis or ivermectin as a prophylaxis I

35:29.640 --> 35:36.200
don't know which I think hydroxychloroquine is a prophylaxis then he got covid for the second or

35:36.200 --> 35:45.080
third time and despite being on a hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and then adding ivermectin he

35:45.080 --> 35:51.880
still had two weeks of terrible sickness and I ended up sort of laughing at him because I was

35:51.880 --> 35:58.840
like so wait you used everything everything on the recommended list from your side

35:59.400 --> 36:05.560
and you still got sick for two weeks and you think that those things work you think that that plan

36:05.560 --> 36:13.480
of yours that imaginary coping plan with the novel virus worked and I do think he's vaccinated

36:13.480 --> 36:18.600
and I do think that was the point that I was able to make and dunk on him um was that like

36:18.600 --> 36:23.080
you're double vaccinated you're on prophylaxis you're testing all the time

36:23.080 --> 36:27.560
you took all these things and you still got super sick for like the second or third time

36:27.560 --> 36:33.480
that doesn't even make sense to me that you would even argue this is evidence for for something

36:33.480 --> 36:40.280
that you understand and so I find it very strange where whenever this guy shows up because people

36:40.280 --> 36:45.560
want to say that that he's a dissident but somehow or another I feel like he's very much a

36:46.520 --> 36:51.640
a person whose job is to be there and make sure that you understand that COVID is serious

36:52.280 --> 36:56.520
COVID's a virus COVID's going around and it made him really sick twice

36:58.440 --> 37:03.640
and and that seems to be his role and so you know I'm not saying he's a bad guy or a good guy I'm

37:03.640 --> 37:11.320
saying that that he has been encouraged to share his experience with the COVID virus a lot even in

37:11.320 --> 37:20.440
Romania so publication bias that's pretty easy thing to talk about but what he was saying was

37:20.440 --> 37:27.240
it was a publication bias of plus versus minus like um positive versus negative results he wasn't

37:27.240 --> 37:33.080
talking about the fake studies that we know were done including that that one that uh was made up

37:33.080 --> 37:39.080
of whole uh holy bad like uh made up data and we weren't talking about poorly designed studies

37:39.160 --> 37:44.840
you know like giving hydroxychloroquine in the 15th day of hospitalization or giving too big of a

37:44.840 --> 37:50.120
dose too late or or giving ivermectin in the fifth day in combination with remdesivir

37:53.880 --> 37:57.800
so that's a little strange because again you can go through these things but you can go through

37:57.800 --> 38:03.720
them in such a way that doesn't get anybody any closer to exiting the cave and if you think that

38:03.720 --> 38:09.720
if you realize that there were fake holy fake papers that were promoted on mainstream media and

38:09.720 --> 38:15.800
social media as being evidence for the ineffectiveness of these things so that those fake or poorly

38:15.800 --> 38:24.920
designed papers would would be the fuel for an incredibly fervored debate an incredibly vigorous

38:24.920 --> 38:31.560
debate a legitimate paper with controversial or or hard to interpret results isn't going to get

38:31.560 --> 38:39.320
you a debate a poorly designed paper with very easy to debunk methodologies would get you a very

38:39.320 --> 38:44.840
vigorous debate especially if you promoted those papers on mainstream media as being a valuable

38:44.840 --> 38:52.600
insight into the effect of these prophylactics you see the deal here and so i'm not trying to

38:52.600 --> 38:57.080
beat a dead horse i'm trying to show you how the subtle differences in the way that these

38:57.720 --> 39:04.520
questions are asked and the answers are given you can show people the breadth and the depth

39:04.520 --> 39:11.160
of this deception or you can let them scratch the surface but then pad them on the back and make

39:11.160 --> 39:16.200
them feel like they really understand it and i think that's often what goes on in these discussions

39:18.680 --> 39:23.160
and here again let me summarize that if you don't say that there were fake papers

39:23.800 --> 39:29.800
if you don't explain that there were poorly designed studies and you don't explain that they

39:29.800 --> 39:37.880
were this way in order to create a very limited spectrum of debate that would be extremely engaging

39:40.040 --> 39:44.680
where the people that were doing it on social media most of them would be unwittingly participating

39:44.680 --> 39:50.200
because the ridiculousness of a poorly designed study of ivermectin could drive people nuts for

39:50.200 --> 39:59.160
months and that's perfect so he said relative risk reduction benefits versus risk remember this

39:59.160 --> 40:09.960
big debate absolute risk you remember that absolute risk versus relative risk and everybody

40:09.960 --> 40:14.840
was doing that big calculation and everybody had their own math problem that they could show you

40:14.840 --> 40:19.480
how impressive it was that relative risk really didn't tell you anything but absolute risk did

40:21.080 --> 40:25.560
all the while we were having that discussion people were being put on remdesivir people were

40:25.560 --> 40:32.120
putting on propofol and medazalam people weren't being given a broad spectrum antibiotic when they

40:32.120 --> 40:37.080
could have used one they weren't being treated with steroids appropriately they were not being

40:37.080 --> 40:41.960
treated at all but being sent back to nursing homes ladies and gentlemen while we were arguing

40:41.960 --> 40:47.640
about the relative risk reduction being used as a factor in a study that was looking at a

40:47.640 --> 40:52.040
transfection that we didn't need in the first place we were arguing about how the numbers should

40:52.040 --> 40:56.040
be distributed how the numbers should be displayed how they should be calculated

40:57.640 --> 40:59.960
rather than whether they should be calculated at all

41:02.040 --> 41:06.600
and i was doing it too don't get me wrong i was on streams with matthew crawford talking about this

41:06.600 --> 41:16.360
stuff and so we had done had we done nothing had this thing come around and we'd done nothing had

41:16.440 --> 41:24.360
this thing come around and we'd done nothing we'd be better off the virus did take out some

41:24.360 --> 41:31.320
people it sure did and then he mentioned j about a charia and i didn't i didn't realize that propofol

41:31.320 --> 41:36.280
was also something that they might have used in this pandemic to anesthetize people i guess that's

41:36.280 --> 41:41.240
how they put them on event um i've heard lots of good things about how propofol works from

41:41.880 --> 41:47.000
the time when i was in the operating room as a pharmacy technician but that was a long time

41:47.000 --> 41:52.120
ago i'm sure um yeah anyway uh let's get back to that vidya

41:56.920 --> 42:04.600
they certainly you know the the place we ended up really doing nothing was in the care of the

42:04.600 --> 42:10.360
patients right because there was lockdown because there was panic because the hospitals were closed

42:11.240 --> 42:15.320
where we really did nothing is the one place we should have been doing something which was

42:15.320 --> 42:19.720
observing our patients monitoring our patients trying different things on the patients

42:20.600 --> 42:24.760
the the steroid inhalers would have worked steroids themselves would have heard you know you can

42:24.760 --> 42:29.320
argue about early treatment whatnot but there were things to be done patients were set home and told

42:29.320 --> 42:35.240
to come back when they were blue that that that was the first chapter of this whole catastrophe that

42:35.240 --> 42:41.240
i just blew my mind i by the way i wrote down a couple of the things that uh j about a charia

42:41.240 --> 42:47.960
said to me he said he they looked at every single person alive as a biohazard and he said society

42:47.960 --> 42:53.800
can't run that way he's absolutely right about that and now i just went to a event last night

42:53.800 --> 42:58.440
talking about the mental health consequences on there's anyone else see a contradiction

42:58.440 --> 43:05.080
between the idea that people were sent home and told to return when they were blue and the idea

43:05.240 --> 43:12.680
that hospitals were overwhelmed and then the idea that actually only a couple hospitals were

43:12.680 --> 43:19.080
overwhelmed and the rest were empty and so were they really telling people to go home and if they

43:19.080 --> 43:24.760
could they sure they could have been at most hospitals and at some hospitals they let them come in i don't

43:25.640 --> 43:32.600
it's weird because saying that patients were sent home and were told to return when blue

43:33.240 --> 43:39.560
probably happened everywhere but in like a few places but i'm not really sure it's just

43:39.560 --> 43:45.000
something i know a lot of people have repeated teenagers and young adults it's profound it's

43:45.000 --> 43:49.960
profound what we've done the numbers of deaths that are going to happen as a result of despair

43:49.960 --> 43:56.280
and drugs it's just profound none of that would have happened if we had done nothing plus you mentioned

43:56.280 --> 44:02.200
the slight improvement with the vaccine we didn't know the potential side effects now we know we

44:02.200 --> 44:07.000
can go to a 22 year old male ago you know there's a one in five thousand let's say one in 50,000

44:07.000 --> 44:12.440
chance of mild carditis and half of those are going to be part well in one year we know okay so

44:12.440 --> 44:16.680
i'm going to go back because this is really bothering me a lot listen carefully to what dr

44:16.680 --> 44:23.880
drew says in mind by the way i wrote down a couple of the things that j about a charia said to me he said

44:23.880 --> 44:31.240
he they looked at every single person alive as a biohazard and he said society can't run that way

44:31.240 --> 44:35.240
he's absolutely right about that and now i just went to a event last night

44:35.240 --> 44:41.000
talking about the mental health consequences on teenagers and young adults it's profound

44:41.000 --> 44:45.480
it's profound what we've done the numbers of deaths that are going to happen as a result of

44:45.480 --> 44:52.040
despair and drugs it's just profound none of that would have happened if we had done nothing plus

44:52.040 --> 44:57.000
you mentioned the slight improvement with the vaccine okay had we done nothing so what does he

44:57.000 --> 45:02.760
really mean there does he mean masking does he mean shutting down schools or does he mean

45:03.480 --> 45:09.240
the requiring of shots and masking and quarantine and testing at college campuses

45:11.320 --> 45:17.320
because i think that saying it as briefly as he did has done a really gross

45:17.880 --> 45:24.680
misjustice to what we've done to the young people because what we've also done is gotten them onto

45:24.680 --> 45:33.400
a psychological train the rules of which involve pandemic viruses for the foreseeable future

45:35.720 --> 45:40.440
for experimental countermeasures every once in a while for the foreseeable future

45:42.840 --> 45:49.000
and there being really no choice when the government or the university or my employer decides to make

45:49.000 --> 45:54.680
a decision it might be a pretty dumb one but i'm gonna have to go along with it

45:56.520 --> 46:01.560
where is all of the this despair and sadness and depression coming from

46:03.400 --> 46:08.840
why is any very specific about it it's the failure of adults to stand up for those kids

46:09.800 --> 46:16.840
it's the failure of the adults to stand up for the tiniest kids for the middle middle school

46:16.920 --> 46:25.160
kids for the high school kids and it's really really on all of you all of you who had college

46:25.160 --> 46:31.400
kids and let them go to college and take the shot and follow those mandates you should have told

46:31.400 --> 46:38.040
them to take the year off you should have had the guts to tell them to take the year off stay at home

46:38.760 --> 46:44.280
get a job at starbucks party with your friends you're not going to go pay 40 000

46:44.280 --> 46:49.400
dollars to have some college tell you what you can't be free you can't you're not even a free

46:49.400 --> 46:57.640
being anymore you're a farm animal we made a huge we made an absolutely gigantic galactic error

46:58.680 --> 47:03.800
by not standing up for our college kids by letting them all take the shot to go to college football

47:03.800 --> 47:11.480
games ladies and gentlemen we made a huge huge error with our college kids that needs to be

47:11.560 --> 47:18.120
fixed immediately or we are going to lose them and if we lose them then we may lose this battle

47:20.280 --> 47:24.600
and we're not going to get them back by covering it that cursor really no way

47:26.360 --> 47:31.000
we didn't know the potential side effects now we know we can go to a 22-year-old male

47:31.000 --> 47:35.320
ago you know there's a one in five thousand let's say one in 50 000 chance of myocarditis

47:36.280 --> 47:40.760
and half of those are going to be part well in one year we know it persists and those people

47:40.760 --> 47:46.200
some of those may end up with really serious cardiac problems as opposed to zero risk from

47:46.200 --> 47:52.440
certainly in the omicron for age uh why are we still pushing these things well that was an

47:52.440 --> 48:00.200
interesting thing to slip in there so the cardiac risk has gone down from delta to omicron is that

48:00.200 --> 48:06.040
what he just said that's pretty spooky yo half of those are going to be part well in one year we

48:06.040 --> 48:10.440
know it persists and those people some of those may end up with really serious cardiac problems

48:10.440 --> 48:17.640
as opposed to zero risk from certainly in the omicron for age uh why are we still pushing these

48:17.640 --> 48:25.640
things well this is a young people particularly yeah and this is why you have your show and it's

48:25.640 --> 48:31.320
so popular and this is why even the violence company is have particular products address

48:31.960 --> 48:36.040
despite this is the second time that they are mentioning this

48:40.360 --> 48:46.600
the wellness company are you kidding me post virus and vaccine vaccine is a problem

48:47.320 --> 48:53.000
look i think historically we were we were learning things that we think we understand today

48:53.640 --> 48:57.560
that we will get to know what was wrongsided and we would be corrected long too

48:58.280 --> 49:05.400
yeah we were wrong for sure we talked we i figured out no no no no i i i cannot understand

49:06.040 --> 49:14.600
how um a product that is so problematic in the sense of its causing harms their reported deaths

49:14.600 --> 49:19.880
we can put i put on a substack about this this japanese study with this teenage girl who died

49:19.880 --> 49:24.760
that they're linking it direct to the shock that's not the only study we have many many instances

49:24.760 --> 49:31.960
so we have a problem yet the powers that we don't want to talk about it and when we talk about it

49:31.960 --> 49:37.240
we get attacked and smeared and slammed it so it has to be that people have been incentivized

49:37.240 --> 49:43.960
j in some way and incentivization is not just money cash money you could get incentivization

49:43.960 --> 49:50.200
by being able to keep your job keep your research position keep keep your research grant and that

49:50.280 --> 49:57.320
is wrong because what we need is honest scientific debate on what the facts are bring the facts

49:57.320 --> 50:01.960
to the table there's an even if you don't like the outcome you're going to have to agree with it

50:01.960 --> 50:09.160
because this is proper proper science we are not dealing with proper science here zero i mean between

50:09.160 --> 50:15.160
right yeah between molyne skiers heads of the cdc both of them i knew doctor i think personal

50:15.160 --> 50:21.400
in fact he told me personally about his six foot social rule when i wrote that years ago people

50:21.400 --> 50:29.960
said how are you sure he told yet he told me that i liked him and to me i know him personally

50:29.960 --> 50:36.520
he's a good godfaring man but he was flat wrong and a lot of the science coming out of cdc and

50:36.520 --> 50:42.760
decisions they made while he was there well linsky was worse and the present cdc director even worse

50:42.840 --> 50:46.920
maybe we have a problem we seem to have patronage i'll see it

50:47.720 --> 50:52.040
he was a patronist probably appointment on the trump like well linsky on the buy

50:52.920 --> 50:58.680
they're not putting the right people in place who bring the pedigree but we don't want the

50:58.680 --> 51:03.240
political animal we want somebody who nobody held their saying and what they're doing and they

51:03.240 --> 51:08.920
could lean those thousands of employees that actually give us good science and good research

51:09.560 --> 51:16.200
not politicize the agency you know so i am one of them saying straight up whoever the next

51:16.200 --> 51:20.920
president or you know i'm a trump supporter i'm going to trump train but i have said you

51:21.720 --> 51:29.240
show me a democrat show me a liberal show me a rhino even you show me somebody show me somebody

51:29.240 --> 51:36.520
who's an independent and they love the country they love the borders they respect the flat they

51:36.520 --> 51:42.120
respect the anthem they know about understand law and order they understand all those things

51:42.120 --> 51:47.560
they like the police they don't want to burn the police down they respect the military and the

51:47.560 --> 51:53.560
service the history of america the greatest country in the world banan well you show me

51:53.560 --> 51:58.360
that person democrat even i'll vote for them i don't have to vote for president trump on

51:58.360 --> 52:03.320
work right now i'm in his orbit but i will not support him if you show me somebody who could

52:03.320 --> 52:09.240
check because trump checks those boxes you show me somebody could check them plus one

52:09.240 --> 52:15.320
i'll strongly consider them but right now on the deck i need somebody like a trump to go into dc

52:15.880 --> 52:25.720
and burn that place down you need to raise cdc fda naad raise it to the floor take it down to the

52:25.720 --> 52:33.560
studs fire everybody 1,000 top down across the board i need a job those agencies because they

52:33.560 --> 52:42.280
inept then competent they politicize i know because i work there i know these people i can't believe

52:42.280 --> 52:48.200
the quality of the people at cdc they have some really good people strong people to scientists

52:48.760 --> 52:54.760
but if vast majority of them are just overpaid and underworked and they get their not viability

52:54.760 --> 53:00.520
i'm sorry i mean but same in canada i work for the government of canada our epidemiologists

53:00.520 --> 53:06.440
for health canada and the public health agency of canada some of the most inept people work there

53:06.440 --> 53:11.400
and they make decisions that affect lives like decisions they made on lockdowns

53:12.360 --> 53:17.720
we found drew i'm echo and j but i'm going a little deeper than j

53:18.600 --> 53:23.320
we looked i wish he was referencing me but i i published a paper with i think he's referencing

53:23.320 --> 53:31.000
j about a chariot here a color rich dr ramen osui doctor how it turned about we looked at every

53:31.000 --> 53:39.400
single study in this entire world across every country every study every report we could find

53:39.720 --> 53:49.080
not one not one study has been published up to four years now to show that any lockdown

53:49.080 --> 53:55.960
will occur transmission or death none not one same as school closures that's an incredible

53:55.960 --> 54:01.320
statement for me to make but i challenge anyone to produce one for me because i know what the

54:01.400 --> 54:08.120
date is i published it four hundred studies in brownstone one find it and read it you bring

54:08.120 --> 54:17.240
one and show me that lock you can't so that's it in other words we lock society dumb based on

54:17.240 --> 54:24.440
what we had no no we never did it before and we had no evidence that it would work

54:24.440 --> 54:31.080
same with the social distancing redfield told me at the hhs i asked him i said dr redfield blunt

54:31.720 --> 54:37.240
dr redfield where show me these studies again you use it with purists i'm a purist and i went

54:37.240 --> 54:43.880
there to help with my research ability he laughed with me not at me but he chuckled he said fall

54:44.600 --> 54:49.560
there's no science we made it up i said dr redfield made it up he said yes

54:50.120 --> 54:55.160
so many countries were in consultation with because that happened before i arrived two months before

54:55.160 --> 55:01.080
so it was already on deck they wanted one foot some said three feet some said 12 feet

55:01.080 --> 55:07.880
some said 22 feet we found six feet some good good now people thought when i wrote that

55:08.760 --> 55:16.680
in a substat in my blog that when he's pulling that out of his his behind why would we hear

55:16.680 --> 55:23.080
where he told me scott got leave the former FDA commissioner went on the news shortly after

55:23.160 --> 55:30.200
me and said the same because he was there too he said it was made up no fauci has come and said

55:30.200 --> 55:37.400
it was made up so i i i was speaking what i knew i actually spoke to redfield that was covid

55:38.600 --> 55:43.480
everything that they did they were making it up as they were going along the only problem is

55:44.280 --> 55:52.680
their policies had serious real world implications and their policies harmed people many people

55:53.320 --> 55:59.960
died because of their policies i'm telling you we had husbands and wives data was coming to my

55:59.960 --> 56:06.680
office so we knew me and dr i classes it was coming to us husbands and wives were turning up to the

56:06.680 --> 56:15.960
year standing there across america wife telling your doctor doctor i have been locked on for 10

56:15.960 --> 56:23.800
months 12 months i've had no work no income i'm angry i'm bitter i'm miserable and i have to admit

56:23.800 --> 56:29.800
i've been physically violent against my husband standing right here husband and tell the doctor

56:30.600 --> 56:36.440
i too have been beaten my wife every day i have no work for a year we're losing the house

56:36.440 --> 56:42.120
campaign and mortgage its disaster all life is over but they're standing there both of them

56:42.440 --> 56:48.760
arms open and a child is laying in their arms unresponsive and they're telling the doctor

56:48.760 --> 56:54.600
today doctor we hear no i think he's talking about a third person like he's telling a story about

56:54.600 --> 56:59.000
people that come into the er and tell stories about how they've been locked down for 10 months

56:59.000 --> 57:03.560
and they're beating their husband or their wife or whatever because we think we crossed the line

57:03.560 --> 57:08.920
today we think we might have killed the child please help us and the child is there unresponsive

57:09.000 --> 57:14.520
with broken bones they beat the child to a fragile and that happened across america multiple times

57:14.520 --> 57:20.440
i know because they were reporting was coming to our office we were rolling it up to the white

57:20.440 --> 57:27.080
house when trump was on his stump they're getting the cdc and arguing for the states to open the

57:27.080 --> 57:35.880
economy and the schools is because he was getting the reports from us we had we harmed and i'm actually

57:35.960 --> 57:43.640
trying to support what you just said drew we harmed our populations we harmed children

57:44.520 --> 57:51.560
some models suggest it will take the rest of the 21st century 80 more years to put them back

57:52.360 --> 58:01.000
to where it were in january of 2020 we harmed them sexual abuse physical abuse when we locked

58:01.000 --> 58:08.440
schools down we didn't understand that most american children get their only meal in school

58:08.440 --> 58:15.800
most when we closed schools many american children starved for months when we closed schools many

58:15.800 --> 58:22.120
american children were sexually abusing their own homes and school is a place where it's flagged

58:22.120 --> 58:29.080
for the first time we put children at risk many children were physically beaten by their families

58:30.040 --> 58:37.000
friends most children of sexual abuse the parents knew the person that's another important statistic

58:37.000 --> 58:42.680
and children suffered i'm not really down with this i'm not i don't you know

58:52.760 --> 58:56.040
i'm not really down with this because what it does it really feels like

58:59.880 --> 59:08.280
it really feels like an emphasis on particular worst case scenarios where even if and i'm not

59:08.280 --> 59:14.680
saying that we should ignore these ideas but let's ignore all of these rare examples of kids that

59:14.680 --> 59:22.680
were sexually abused more often than before because of the pandemic i don't think there are a whole

59:22.680 --> 59:28.120
lot of kids that were completely free of sexual abuse before the pandemic and then the pandemic

59:28.200 --> 59:37.400
finally gave the opportunity for it to start and so i feel like what he should be focused on

59:38.280 --> 59:45.400
are the all the families that struggled to survive and didn't have these extraordinary

59:45.400 --> 59:50.840
problems the extraordinary problems were just created by the extraordinary countermeasures

59:50.840 --> 59:57.400
that were were forced upon our communities and so we're not talking about the lost businesses and

59:57.400 --> 01:00:04.520
how those wrecked marriages we're not talking about how lost income could cause pressure that

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:11.720
would fracture families even if they were in school would have fractured households even if

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:17.160
everybody was going to school being home wasn't the problem being on an iPad wasn't the problem

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:26.040
it was having people's lives disrupted people's livelihoods disrupted businesses destroyed

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.480
yeah sure it's not good that the the schools were closed

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:39.320
it surely exacerbated a lot of things but we don't need to go down a list of uh special victims units

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:47.240
episodes here there's enough tragedy in very good people not being allowed to see their

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.720
relatives that were being killed by the protocols that's something we ought to talk about how about

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.840
all those teenagers that are suffering despair because one or more of their parents or grandparents

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:03.640
disappeared taken away from them suffered died how about my wife's sister how about her father in

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:15.000
law how about Nate's family how about Annie's family there's no special tragedies there with

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:23.960
abuse or or or or spousal whatever this is just loving beautiful families being destroyed by this

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:30.920
narrative so why is he got to send all this negativity why did he spend 20 minutes talking

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.680
about how Redfield made up the six foot rule why did he just point out that six foot is also

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.280
how deep you're supposed to bury a dead body and that's why they chose six foot

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:49.720
I don't like the fact that we're I feel like we're still being played

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.440
I don't like the fact that I feel like people are still being given scripts to read

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.840
I don't like the fact that I feel like people are

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.800
do those supplements work I don't know

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.800
do people need them I don't know I could be doing a great service to to the world

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.960
maybe I should be sponsored by the wellness company

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.880
but if I'm sponsored by the wellness company I'm still going to say everything I'm saying right

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.560
now including that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.560
intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb I'm still going to say the

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:42.840
transfection in humans is criminally negligent because any medical doctor should have been

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.960
should have felt the responsibility enough to read up on it to find out what it was and to

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.000
come to the conclusion that it was a transfection wholly untested being delivered with

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.400
wholly untested lipid nanoparticles

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.800
and we haven't mentioned any of that yet

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.640
so we're getting there we're sort of there right he said something like if we had done nothing

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.360
this thing came around and we had done nothing we would be better off but the

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.760
virus did take out vulnerable old people

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:25.480
I have faith in a novel virus that killed millions of people but millions more were saved

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.520
I believe this novel virus probably came from gain of function and I believe it will come again

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:41.320
he suffered our children and it is bearing on well I would argue I would argue you're pointing

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:49.480
out the most extreme obviously cases but as you go down the scale of severity of the consequences

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:55.800
they are still profound in terms of the impact on development mental health

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.160
cognitive development school I will tell the story now I always tell it when I have this

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.600
conversation I will I suppose I'll take this one to my grave when the the Ukrainian women were

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.400
running out of Ukraine at the beginning of the war the invasion from Russia they were running

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.360
into Poland with their children and there were reporters there with microphones and a two-way

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.440
person each woman said oh yeah it's terrible we're leaving our sons our fathers our our

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.640
our husbands back to fight this war and then the next thing out of their mouth was

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.720
but these kids have been out of school for two weeks we have to get them back in school immediately

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:38.360
it's been two weeks that's a sane mother two weeks out of school is for real it is substantial

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:44.360
in this state California where I am right now we did it for two years and what we expect that to

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.800
suddenly magically vaporize in terms of its effect it's too much uh Dr. Alexander I'm gonna take a

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:57.000
little break here uh when we come back amongst other things I want to talk about Dr. Birx because

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.080
she was the one that evangelized about closure and I've got a little that theory that when

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.000
when a physician he's done he specializes on any topic when they become a you know when they become

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.760
you know uh I don't know whether word to use but evangelical is not religiously

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.840
evangelical they become evangelical on a topic that's how we got the opioid crisis for instance

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.040
that's how that's how opiates were evangelized by the pain medicine world where pain became the

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.760
fifth vital sign and pain assessment was more important than the pulse and all this craziness

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:39.240
that was because of evangelical physicians Birx on her own and in her book not only evangelized but

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:45.720
felt like a hero in having done so I'd love to get your assessment now that we have Dr. Fauci slowly

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.680
turning towards reality where he is saying again the six feet social distancing was

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.440
non-scientific made up no evidence that it did anything and yet we got the world to cooperate

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:03.880
with that it's just sensational and two that the lab leak uh where the specifics on the origin of

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.480
the virus came from might or no really it could no certainly not a conspiracy to talk about lab

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:17.240
leak origin although anyone who dared to bring that up a year or two ago was called a conspiracist

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:24.200
so we'll do those topics when we return so ladies gentlemen let's so a year or two ago you would

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:30.280
have been called a conspiracy theorist to bring up the lab leak are you are we forgetting that

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:36.840
we're in the fifth year now drew this whole thing started in 2020 that means four years ago

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:45.080
four years ago ladies and gentlemen seriously I'm not even kidding four years ago four

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.640
absolutely it's four years ago four years ago you would have been called a conspiracy theorist

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:59.240
to talk about the lab leak not one or two years ago four years ago yeah got it okay good glad you

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:06.520
could hear that um it's four years ago it's really I wanted that to be uh I had some kind of reverb

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:13.720
on there and now it was altering my pitch again I was recording uh some some stuff for the computer

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.880
voice and then yeah I thought I had that for reverb dark on it anyway that's not an older

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.960
interview I think it's like a week old um anyway let's make a resolution that's easy to keep and

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.920

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:21.960
custom genusils colors are made from media you know the medical professionals you can trust

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.960
and their new medical emergency kits are the gold standard when it comes to keep you safe and

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.080
healthy it's really it's a safety net it's an insurance policy that you hope you're not gonna

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.480
leave but if you need it you sure as heck are gonna wish you had it if you need it be ready for

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.000
anything this medical emergency kit contains an assortment of lifesaving medications including

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.640
ivermectin z what do you suppose he gets for doing this i mean i know he's got a lot of viewers

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.400
but what what would he get for this could i make a living as a as a wellness guy i don't think i

01:08:51.400 --> 01:09:01.000
have enough followers interesting you pack the medical from z back you see you found a better

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.280
sleep supplement is just moments here and he just shakes that oh my god you should have on hand

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.960
we have more kits coming for more circumstances like travel whatnot also Susan brought her favorite

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.360
supplements here and cleave mind is the sleep the rest will sleep i i've never found a better

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.280
sleep supplement is just uncanny how well that stuff works but will you have the spike support and

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:26.200
the yeah if you've had covid recently you take the spike support yeah it was a dr drew bobblehead

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.360
and i want you to think very carefully about who else has a bobblehead because Vincent

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.400
racking yellow has a bobblehead i think kevin mccaren has a bobblehead

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:45.320
tony fauci i have a tony fauci bobblehead um but having a bobblehead of yourself is something very

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:51.000
very intriguing unless your kids get it for you for father's day which probably is what kevin mccaren

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.120
had so that's totally okay um and i'm gonna assume that um because i think has as

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:05.400
an interesting as a character as kevin mccaren is it's hard for me to imagine that he is

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:12.760
somebody who would buy himself a bobblehead that's just seems way above and beyond now maybe the

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:19.640
guy who was or the gal that's that's running his show or or giving him encouragement or or direction

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.000
provided that bobblehead but the idea that of all the things he could do i'm sure

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.200
getting a bobblehead what could not possibly have been very high on his list i mean

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.560
it just seems so weird and then how many people have bobbleheads it's just weird i don't know right

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:44.280
it does does does debunked the funk have a bobblehead i don't think so and also there's some

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.640
okay look can we see there's also no i'm not on camera and then the gummies which have bromelain

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.080
i use the kids gummy dr valperin on fire in his substation is the book and here is dr paul

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:01.800
he's got a book i didn't know he had a book oh my gosh all these people have books

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.760
okay i need a sponsorship from the wellness company and i need a book i need a both stat

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:16.760
alexander uh who has so many books lately you can follow him uh on twitter uh it is put it up

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.400
there calip if you would his sub-stack in the twitter make sure i get this right dr paul

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.960
alexander dot com where you can find it i don't have his twitter account but you can find it at

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:33.960
dr paul alexander dot com got it and the sub-stack uh paul uh mark hu satanic and myself do not have

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.760
a book yet so please don't make these these broad statements in the chat like everyone

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.880
has a book because not everybody has a book mark and i don't have a book jessica and mark and i

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.880
don't have a book okay not everybody's got a book please have a little sensitivity when you're when

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:56.360
you're typing things the sub-stack the address is very simple is you just need to google alexander

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:04.040
covid news just alexander space covid space news and it will pop up and it's free i've made it free

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:11.560
you know you don't have to pay to join there's no um no moratoriums no firewalls anyone could

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:18.280
comment and you could get into the discussion excellent now before the break i mentioned

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.880
dr bergs and her evangelizing for a how do you know or uh what what are you basing your uh statement

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:31.640
on their daniel hays that the that the supplements are of low quality um no fulcrum i was just

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:37.720
joking around don't don't take me too seriously i'm not sad that i don't have a book um i'm gonna

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:43.320
have a book eventually i'm sure it'll be a really great recipe book uh what what why do you think

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:49.480
that they're yes get foster colson to get you a vitamin line yeah well only if it's going to be

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:57.000
like uh jj's jj's you know special combination i don't want to i want to hawk anybody else's combos

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:06.520
i want my own i want to uh melone special and her sense of heroism in her own book on having done so

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.080
what is your what is your assessment these days that's a beautiful picture of those hand down

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:18.200
i have wow and um dr bergs on me dr bergs had serious problems with dr a class myself he was in

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:23.960
the isin hobbit and i was at the um health and human services because we were raising serious

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:30.760
hell with her and pouchy as to the lockdowns school closures etc and um i think um she wrote

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:37.240
in a book that she didn't really care for me and um the thing about it is what i don't understand

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.840
through is these people made a lot of mistakes and they're not being held accountable the type

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:49.000
of hearings and the discussions needed are not happening so i hope it will come um a lot of these

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.360
people the reality is you you can't hate people you can't you have to love each other and um be

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:05.960
you know gracious mercy before make mistakes everyone is oh no he froze again uh oh just uh

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.720
froze on dot jell exander kayla were you still there with me or is that just on this end no yeah

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:16.680
i'm still here that was just his his call dropped he'll be he's coming back come on paul okay excellent

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.480
yeah uh it's again he was there he was the one fighting the fight i remember i was on a

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.320
nightly news broadcast i've discussed this before in here in los angeles um and a school board member

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:35.000
came in the night they closed the schools and i i was sort of shocked that they were doing this

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.520
because i i was it seemed excessive and bizarre for this particular pathogen and uh the school

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:45.320
board member came in and i said who who told you to do this did you consult with a team of infectious

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.840
disease experts was their public health who told you and thank god there's still footage of it and

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.160
if you look on the atom and dr. drew show we we played it there a couple of times and the guy

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:01.560
looked at me and went we just think it's the right thing to do you you could close what just because

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:06.760
you think it's the right what does that even mean who are you to make these decisions about

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.200
it just was just the most uncanny experience and thank god i was asking those questions and they

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.600
had no answers to them i you know but it was still so so odd to be around during those days

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:23.720
and always beware of physicians that uh have evangelical points of view it's why i really try to

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.760
be careful and you have humble with my positions in fact uh i got i got a little over my skis what

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.440
when i look back at my own errors uh i feel like that's where i got into trouble which was

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:43.400
being excessively sort of heuristic and pushing back on the chaos and panic that was being induced

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.320
at the time i thought it was the press that was doing it i really did i thought they were the ones

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.840
just doing it to try to do what they always do i mean look around now i mean every time it snows

01:15:52.840 --> 01:16:00.680
it's a climate change like every time there's a white lung syndrome in china that was nothing

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.440
by the way it's respiratory virus season we're going to have respiratory viruses increase

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:12.040
includes co including covid it is going to happen and it's going to happen every respiratory season

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:17.000
are we going to be panicking about that every year for the rest of human life so we are we are

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.040
bizarre it's just wild we are really reinforcing this this respiratory virus idea including covid

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.040
so he was really reinforcing the idea that there's RSVE and that there's flu and that it's all

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.640
going around and it can be tracked with PCR and that's where this goes wrong

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.280
because what we're really talking about here is

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:49.560
the indirect justification for all of this uh diagnostic infrastructure

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.560
you know these these these sequencing machines are not cheap

01:16:53.560 --> 01:17:04.280
um and getting it into hospital budgets and making it a normal thing for hospitals or for

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:11.080
testing agencies to be running DNA and and RNA diagnostics is not a good direction for us to be

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:18.120
going in it's not a good direction for us to be going in because those are in a lot of ways

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:23.400
black box technologies that shouldn't be applied as diagnostics in the way that they are and

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.360
oftentimes probably aren't being applied as diagnostics they're being applied as data collection tools

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.840
and so by driving this narrative of

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:43.240
high fidelity genetic testing for all of these pathogens and for making it let's say common

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.920
that this is the standard now we are opening the door for for this

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:57.640
technology to be used against us into the future almost add add infinitum they can they can just

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.520
roll out a fake test and if they make enough of them

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.760
then they can fool people not very dissimilar to what we watch the other night with

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.240
doctors not realizing that ladies were having toxic shock syndrome from incorrect use of

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:23.960
extra absorbent tampons you roll out a bad test how long will it take for those doctors to

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:32.360
disbelieve the test after they've been drilled by dr. Drew and by dr. Alexander and by dr. Bhattacharya

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:40.120
and by Fauci and by by all these people that these tests are legitimate because these threats

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:47.640
are legitimate because these biological phenomenon are legitimate and so we have to use something

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:53.720
to track them we have to use something to get a handle on them so that we have some way of

01:18:53.720 --> 01:19:00.600
moving forward we've actually told people that this is more useful information than this entire

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:07.240
battery of symptoms that this entire medical history of this person the last 48-hour history

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:13.960
of this person is less important than this this PCR diagnostic this is the dangerous slippery slope

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:20.040
that these guys don't appear to be aware of at all as they talk about the respiratory season every

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.280
year come on people he yelled at us

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.360
by the chasing like every time there's a white lung syndrome in china that was nothing it

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.880
ate by the way it's respiratory virus season we're going to have respiratory viruses increase

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:45.560
includes co including covid it is going to happen and it's going to happen every respiratory season

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.160
are we going to be panicking about that every year for the rest of human life

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.120
it's too it's just too bizarre it's just wildly i don't know i don't know what to think about

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:58.760
but uh Caleb how are we doing there with uh Dr. Alexander we're uh trying to reconnect him he's

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:03.960
coming back into the zoom call i don't it's it's been so bizarre like as you guys probably noticed

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.160
yesterday we had tons of technical issues today i had its even technicians come out and change

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.080
all the hardware only for us to find out that it was because of the tornadoes that went through

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.920
florida knocked out a whole fiber like array they called it so everybody using fiber on the

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.160
east coast has been having some issues like this so he's he's coming back and then he's on it and

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.520
then now good and now he's having still this up but we we do pretty good i think and so the so

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.800
we are dependent on some of the systems and that's fine that's how this works and so we've you froze

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.840
there in the middle of what you were saying why don't you continue your thoughts sir

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:45.800
thank you thank you oh there we go there we are yes yeah so thank you very much um yeah some

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:52.120
already we lost there but um yeah you were talking about Dr. Booth the reality about it is that um

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:59.320
i was trying to express that uh a lot of mistakes were made by a lot of people and um we need to

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:06.360
find a way to get to the bottom of the mistakes and have a seriously beat so that these kinds of

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.960
things don't happen i i tend to believe that i don't believe that people were just purely inept

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.480
because from very early on including people like Bhattacharya and Koolock myself at last

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:24.280
McCollum stuff we were shouting out about the harms of like the lockdowns and stuff and it seems as though

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.120
um these people like the books and they of the world they just hardened the lockdowns and

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:35.640
extended them when the evidence had accumulated quickly two three weeks out of the gate by the

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:41.320
middle of April the lockdowns were harmful and harming the society so we need to be able to

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:48.520
ask them these questions as to what were they looking at what data what evidence to keep the

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:55.000
lockdowns going especially harms on children by closing schools and i think um Dr. Booth's books

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:02.040
is a very charismatic individual um her her fights with uh Dr. Atlas were legendary in uh

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:07.560
in the White House exception meetings because um he's a very evidence-based guy he would walk

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.720
into meetings with stacks of research studies on papers works on poetry and they would have

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:20.120
nothing they would sit down on the desk at the table with nothing and Atlas would ask him we

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:25.160
asked him serious questions and they would not be able to answer the questions from a data on

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.760
evidence point of view yet they will produce in these graphs that he would put up every day

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:37.640
spooking President Trump and uh with all these infections and cases yet they won't tell him

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:43.000
President Trump Dr. Books and they won't tell him President Trump that he will oversight on the

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.360
PCR process so we will we knew that many of those positive cases that you are taking people out of

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:58.200
school and society will potentially force positive infectious pathogens so there's so many crazy

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:09.240
nonsensical, suspicious actions taken that when we look back at it i have to say to you that um

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.000
i don't know how people like you you're crewing me that we got here because at one point you thought

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.360
what was going to okay so i'm just gonna pause it here i i i so we talked about Atlas being an

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:27.880
evidence-based medicine guy and then he talked about overcycling of the PCR i really want you to

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:35.080
understand that an alternative interpretation that i'm trying to get everyone to consider

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:43.160
not claiming that it is the way to think about the PCR test but i want you to consider the

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:50.360
possibility that any background signal that was confounded with an amplicon any unknown background

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:57.800
signal previously unrecorded but broadly distributed background signal that could have been positive

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:05.560
on any of these amplicons for any of these over 200 emergency use authorized PCR tests

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:32.920
any contamination from controls could have caused widespread positivity in any of these labs in any of these places where it would have been contaminated in any of these places where they were collecting the swabs and drive-ups these are all being confounded with the possibility that PCR works fairly well and they just didn't really target at anything meaningful

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.920
it's also being confounded by the idea that the PCR could have been looking for something meaningful that they knew was there because they put it there in certain places and so we as as as representatives of giga-ome what i would like you to be equipped with is the ability to say yeah that's a good point but there are five other things you should consider just like when somebody brings up the double stranded DNA that can be used in the

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.840
shot i would like us to be sophisticated enough to be able to say yes that's true but

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.200
and list the other seven reasons why transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.440
and that's where we need to get that's how sophisticated we need to get that's how

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:29.400
how informed we need to be so that like me when somebody asks you a question you can give them

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.920
a one or two sentence answer that hits it right on the head and it rings the bell

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:40.280
not you know can i ask you more but wow that that's an answer i didn't expect

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.360
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.240
immune system is dumb that's not how the immune system works my friend

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.600
that answer will knock people's socks off i've seen it happen

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:03.720
because they were just doing things that were just harming people and now we realize that

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:11.640
everything that was done with covid basically was wrong that that i ask anyone right now

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:18.200
give me an example of a policy just one that was done that was implemented and imposed on us

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:24.440
that would i don't think anybody could find a policy that would we lost in every single

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:32.680
thing that they did but yet yet four to five trillion dollars moved from the lower and the

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:38.120
lower middle class population towards the wealthy people wealthy people who in big business made

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.880
a lot of money and became richer we shifted the burden of morbidity and mortality though

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:50.760
to the poor because the middle class and upper middle class these people and the rich people

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:58.200
could have afforded to shield dr. books locked down she was locking down yet the poor people

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:04.600
marginalized people women women who had front facing jobs had to go to the grocery group had

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:11.000
to go to this to the assembly floor had to go out there had to drive buses men those poor people

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.480
had to face whatever this was and none of them died i can't believe the fact that all those people

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.640
who are working at the front lines of grocery stores like like trader jose and whole foods they

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:30.040
weren't all dead how come they didn't die i mean delta went around into all those people

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.240
those semi-retired people working at home depot they were all working all through it

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.600
they never died it's really incredible and when we look at the data the infections were highest in

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:49.880
them and the mortality so there's a lot of a lot of questions as to why certain things were done

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:57.720
on what went wrong i don't find that fauci and books in there like they have this these hearings

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.400
let me tell you something so your listeners could understand in these hearings that are taken place

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.720
now with fauci came up the ones before except on even now people like myself and i found this

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:15.960
closure people reach out to me from the congress and the senate and say no doctor is under can you

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:22.280
put together some questions for us we are the congressional really the house members we are

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:28.040
the senators whatever questions for us to ask and i reached out to a lot of scientists and doctors

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.200
that i work with and i said you guys give me questions too let's put together a big truth

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.000
and i sent it to them and then they started to select they would select questions that they want

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.960
and they would put in questions that are so nonsensical it's just junk and then i will start

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.920
communicating and say but wait hold on this is supposed to be a hearing and we want a comfortability

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:56.120
and stuff right and point out what shocked me drew is that and i can't name names here but i have the

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:02.120
emails some of the aides would write me back to the different congresspeople and say fall i don't

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.040
take a really understanding we bring in these people up here to the hill

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:13.480
under questioning and hearings but we don't look at the punish anybody etc we just trying to

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:19.320
embarrass them well i nearly fell out of my chair so i will then back and let me embarrass them

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:25.240
do you mean like this is a dog on pony show yes it is a dog on pony show and this is the point

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.960
when the democrats have the chairmanship they do the same the republicans have the chairmanship

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:36.440
they do the same there is no accountability that's going to come out yeah of these hearings

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:45.880
as they exist today none and that's i'm not surprised i i'm not surprised although there's a part of

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:54.680
me i've said this before that i i don't want us to go on a punishment seeking affair in the sense

01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:02.200
that my priority is getting to the truth so we can adjust and put things in place to make sure

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:10.840
this doesn't happen again uh and i don't and i'm i worry that if you seek to punish people

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:15.480
all the people that want to have a neuremberg 2.0 and all this stuff people are going to go on

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.560
the defensive and you're not going to find anything out we're not going to figure out a damn thing

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.480
about what happened because people are going to shut up and follow what the attorneys tell them

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:31.080
to do in this case at least we have the possibility of finding out where the mistakes were it just

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.000
i just the fact that fauci said what he said yesterday that would suddenly you and i have been

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.280
talking about the six feet thing for two years and every time i bring it up i i could get a 500 hits

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:46.120
on twitter calling me an idiot how dare i well where are those people now you know every way

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.400
the the the theme for the day is everybody needs to take a good hard look at themselves

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:59.640
everybody wherever you're wrong where you were right where you where you jumped on to propaganda

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.760
that was brought by another country many times and where you were a horrible human being to somebody

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:11.320
else who was merely offering an opinion that is where everybody needs to be and that should be the

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.120
focus of even these sorts of hearings like where did what do you get off telling a guy

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:22.760
going after dr fauci in an email a guy like j about a charia a guy that you funded his research

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.000
what were you thinking what's going on in your mind that you would behave like that

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.680
to me that's that's of course they would get embarrassed by all that too in which you would

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.400
satisfy their goals and all this but i i worry about going for blood i really worry about that

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:46.440
what do you say to that well i mean look there's a lot of siege in what you just said because we

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:53.000
we are good governance society and we are we are we are civilized people today in the 21st century

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.800
we supposed to be we are supposed to have even the most difficult discussion

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:04.840
civilly the finer we have the discourse but but also we need some kind of accountability

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:13.880
we can't let me put it you this way when and when susie went to her doctor and asked her doctor

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.840
in Canada as an example because i know many susies this happened to them because i was asked

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:27.000
to play a role even in america i told you doctor i cannot take this vaccine because i have an allergic

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.880
reaction to components of the vaccine based in my past life actually doctor you are treating me

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:39.800
for one of those components the doctor would tell her look wait right here i was there he would

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:46.120
go and bring a piece of paper from the province of ontario the college opposition and citizens

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:53.240
or the federal government showing that as a doctor if somebody in canada this is what happened and

01:32:53.240 --> 01:33:00.040
this is still on the books now it's the rule okay i'm gonna stop i can't do it anymore because

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.480
they're not talking about anything relevant they're not they're not asking relevant questions

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.720
they're not asking questions that are going to get anybody's family out of the cave

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:13.880
they're not going to they're not asking questions that are going to get anybody to the state to

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.400
which they really understand the depth and the breadth of the lies that have occurred

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:25.720
that's the reality here and i don't know why it is that that they're doing this i don't know if

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.520
that's what the wellness company is into i don't know if that's the way they sell supplements

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.800
but i know for sure that we have a very serious problem if this is the the discourse that we're

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:44.040
going to have where we're going to talk about overcycling and false positives and this thing

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:51.640
that went around and killed old people and that we responded poorly to um i am not very happy to

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:57.960
find out that dr. Simon Godak has blocked me that's a little weird um i don't really know what to say

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:09.400
about that uh and let me sure why not let me save this and let me give it a quick spin i'm trying

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:16.440
to get done a little bit early on time these days because um it's starting to eat into my mornings

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:21.560
and so uh shoot that's not what i wanted

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:35.240
i am just going to say thank you very much for joining me um and i'm going to sign off a little

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:40.760
you know on normal time but not really normal i guess it's a little late

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:48.280
uh and i will be on tomorrow with another study hall i think i'm still working on

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:55.960
friday's show friday's show is going to be a uh infectious cycle show i'm really looking forward

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.200
to it and it will be the first time that we put out a pdf and quite some time so i'm excited about

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.640
that for all my subscribers and of course as you know the pdfs are always free it's just that the

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.600
subscribers get a little email with a link and uh they cannot download all the old ones

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:16.360
in this pdf i think will help you um to find the papers yourself to read the papers yourself

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.560
there'll be some annotated papers um i'm really looking forward to this first installment of the

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:29.480
the brief to actually come out in pdf form again um thanks for joining me um i do think it is really

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:35.000
time to stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.840
any means necessary and here is your outro music uh

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:54.920
he has 6,666 followers of course he does um of course he does you didn't get a pdf yet

01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:01.960
talking cube but you will and i forgive you for being late there jannet uh that's all right we

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:08.760
didn't need too much um in the way of of legal advice tonight but i can tell you that um they

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.720
weren't talking about anything relevant right nobody mentioned the the prep act and how we could

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.760
fix that problem um how are we going to not let this happen again i don't really know but i don't

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.440
think paul and drew were about to say we have to get rid of the prep act and and elect a president

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.880
that will do that i highly doubt it and they certainly were going to say uh strict liability

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.080
for uh all pharmaceutical products but you know that's the way it goes um intramuscular

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.800
injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.920
transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not pattern integrity

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.600
it is definitely not a worst case scenario

01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:02.200
is that the old one i didn't replace it with the new one that's too bad

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.840
if you would like to support the stream um you can do that at digahomebiological.com you can scroll

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:18.280
down to the bottom and there are ways to subscribe for for uh monthly quarterly or annually and i

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.960
think actually if you contribute quarterly you're you're contributing the most um and you can also

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.280
