WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.840
I've been around for you, been up and down for you, but I just can't get any relief.

00:27.840 --> 00:38.960
I'll swallow my pride for you, live in light for you, but do you still make me feel like a thief?

00:38.960 --> 00:45.840
You got me stealing your love away, cause you never give it,

00:45.840 --> 00:57.680
peeling me years away, and we can't remember it, oh I'll make you laugh, maybe you make me cry.

00:57.840 --> 01:05.120
I believe it's time for me to fly.

01:12.080 --> 01:22.560
You said we'd work it out, you said that your hair no doubt, that deep down we really love.

01:23.280 --> 01:32.320
Oh, but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is gone, I do believe that I've had enough.

01:34.800 --> 01:40.400
I've had enough for the fastness of a worn-up relation,

01:41.200 --> 01:51.760
enough for the jealousy and the entire ration, oh I'll make you laugh, maybe you make me cry.

01:53.520 --> 01:59.840
I believe it's time for me to fly,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.360
time for me to fly,

02:03.360 --> 02:06.400
I've got to set myself free,

02:06.400 --> 02:09.040
time for me to fly,

02:09.040 --> 02:12.560
but it's just how it's about to be.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.280
I know it hurts to say goodbye,

02:17.280 --> 02:24.240
but it's time for me to fly,

02:47.280 --> 02:50.240
it's time for me to fly,

02:50.240 --> 02:53.840
but I've got to set myself free,

02:53.840 --> 03:00.160
I believe it's just how it's about to be.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.720
Oh, I know it hurts to say goodbye,

03:04.720 --> 03:08.960
but it's time for me to fly,

03:08.960 --> 03:13.600
yeah, it's time for me to fly,

03:14.480 --> 03:18.640
yeah, it's time for me to fly,

03:18.640 --> 03:22.000
It's time for me to fly,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.960
it's time for me to fly,

03:26.880 --> 03:38.080
it's time for me to fly,

04:13.600 --> 04:29.000
and

04:29.720 --> 04:30.220
Grab!

04:33.680 --> 04:34.180
Stop!

04:34.540 --> 04:35.020
imb!

04:59.000 --> 05:22.360
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
case scenario.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
case scenario.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.680
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst

05:31.680 --> 05:34.120
case scenario.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.240
I think truth is good for kids.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.520
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more than society.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.720
We want everybody to feel good.

05:42.720 --> 05:47.120
That's not the way life is.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.840
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
And I have lied.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
I don't want to lie.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
You know?

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
I don't think I'm a liar.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Not to be a liar.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
I don't want to be a liar.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.960
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:03.960 --> 06:32.960
Mark, Mark, Mark, you're so funny, as a surgeon you should be speaking out on this.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
You could save lives.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
What the fuck?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.720
I don't know anything about this.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.800
How am I meant to know about this?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
You know what?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.680
I don't know about everything.

06:41.680 --> 06:48.720
You shouldn't think that just because you're on to something that someone else should be

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
doing it to, buddy.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.960
We've all got our own jobs to do.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.200
I don't tell you what to do.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
What the fuck?

06:56.800 --> 07:01.400
Anyway, the reason why I try to get through to you, get your number of calls, you're

07:01.400 --> 07:06.800
busy last time, and I'm not busy, is that, look, I went back through the podcast and

07:06.800 --> 07:13.600
I'm afraid it wasn't good enough, mate.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.520
I don't know how to explain this to you, but it was about, it was just over an error, but

07:18.520 --> 07:25.480
the thing is, what was relevant was literally just 15 minutes and it was just dragged out

07:25.480 --> 07:30.760
and there was not enough substance, not enough facts, not enough details.

07:30.760 --> 07:38.600
I would also say try and work on your presentation, you drag things out and speak very slowly

07:38.600 --> 07:46.200
and it's just, you need to be a bit more punchy, a bit more punchy, a bit more animated.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.600
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
His name is J.J.

07:49.600 --> 07:58.200
Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in some sort

07:58.200 --> 08:02.200
of scientific discipline from what I understand.

08:28.200 --> 08:50.040
I hope I gave you enough time to catch up, I hope you gave you enough time to share the

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
stream.

08:51.040 --> 08:57.200
Hello everyone, unfortunately for everybody that tries to make it as quick as possible.

08:57.200 --> 09:03.800
To the left hand, Monkey Ranch number two is number one again today, first in line by

09:03.800 --> 09:10.920
a few minutes actually, it felt very much like a complete victory today, so welcome, that's

09:10.920 --> 09:17.240
the second day in a row actually, and on time today, I actually pushed the button almost

09:17.240 --> 09:25.960
on time today, when your watch looks the nicest at 10 after 10, and here we are again, a gig

09:25.960 --> 09:32.200
of it.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.480
Seems like we're catching the attention of some of these metlers, and they're trying

09:36.480 --> 09:42.480
to start fires that we don't need to pay attention to, trying to get us to run in directions,

09:42.480 --> 09:47.840
we don't need to run in, these people are kind of irrelevant now, once we realize that

09:47.840 --> 09:53.160
they are part of what's perceived to be true but definitely isn't true, it's not like we

09:53.160 --> 09:57.320
have to continue to pay attention to them anymore, now that we see them for the gold

09:57.320 --> 10:02.600
fish with shark fins for what they are, right, then we don't need to pay attention to those

10:02.600 --> 10:09.920
people anymore, but there are some people who have been put in front of, have been put

10:09.920 --> 10:16.640
in front of the Senate and put in front of podcast after podcast, who seem to be very

10:16.640 --> 10:22.200
skillfully avoiding speaking about their lack, being a lack of evidence of spread in

10:22.200 --> 10:27.960
New York City and in fact everywhere, it's actually crazy to think that so many people

10:27.960 --> 10:34.080
get so many podcasts but they can't accurately explain how the term inflexious clone referring

10:34.080 --> 10:45.000
to a synthetically produced DNA or RNA could be used to sort of as a proxy for, for, for

10:45.000 --> 10:50.600
virology, by just simply transforming and transfecting cell cultures with these, with

10:50.600 --> 10:55.960
these preparations and it's interesting that the no virus people haven't been able to get

10:55.960 --> 11:01.120
there yet, they couldn't explain that, that these people are just using transformation

11:01.120 --> 11:07.320
and transfection on cell culture and calling it virology, it's so easy to say and yet somehow

11:07.320 --> 11:12.360
these super geniuses that have been rubbing their hands together for four years about

11:12.360 --> 11:17.440
there being no viruses, haven't been able to expand their, their lexicon far enough

11:17.440 --> 11:22.560
for anyone to take them seriously and that's just by design because that's also the reason

11:22.560 --> 11:28.280
why no one ever talks about the usefulness of a placebo batch, no one ever actually uses

11:28.280 --> 11:35.600
the word transfection until very recently and then it's that ultimate clown, uh, Brett

11:35.600 --> 11:43.040
Weinstein and of course none of these people, no matter how long Shannon Joy gives them

11:43.040 --> 11:49.520
to talk can they just say that they murdered people and lied about it, they can't just

11:49.520 --> 11:56.800
say that gain of function is a mythology, oh wait, sometimes they can of course in 2024

11:56.800 --> 12:03.320
some of these messages are going to be absorbed by, by amateurs and by private consultants

12:03.320 --> 12:10.520
and by honey traps that are working for the FBI or whoever to try and imagine if you subscribe

12:10.520 --> 12:16.560
to some of these people's sub stack what list you go on, what list do you go on if you subscribe

12:16.560 --> 12:25.680
to uh, sof's mom's sub stack, what, what, what happens then, what, what, what happens

12:25.680 --> 12:33.120
when you actually go to gab and sign up for, for, for Robert Malone's gab group, of course

12:33.120 --> 12:37.320
you know what happens, you went on a list, what happens to all the people that followed

12:37.320 --> 12:43.320
these fake censored people over there as part of the Scooby-Doo mystery they were solving,

12:43.320 --> 12:49.960
they're on a list and it takes only the spectacular commitment to these lies, that commitment

12:49.960 --> 12:57.520
being kept by people like Brett Weinstein and, and Alexandros Marinos and Chris Martinson

12:57.520 --> 13:07.600
and Pierre Corey and, and all of these interesting, whistle-blowing, white horse riding, bald eagle

13:07.600 --> 13:19.200
carrying, American flag lapel wearing shoe photograph taking, hot tub sharing fakes, ladies

13:19.200 --> 13:24.480
and gentlemen they only have one thing left and that is to attribute bad motives to me,

13:24.480 --> 13:29.280
bad motives to mark because they can't address the things that we are talking about ladies

13:29.280 --> 13:36.040
and gentlemen because weaponized piles of money are directing them, weaponized piles of money

13:36.040 --> 13:45.200
are directing them to make sure you don't believe us because once you see it it can't

13:45.200 --> 13:50.680
be unseen and so they don't want us to show any more people, they want to, they want to

13:50.680 --> 13:57.600
make sure that, that we aren't able to show any more people, um, Vilma I bet you're being

13:57.600 --> 14:04.880
into, you were being attacked a long time ago, um, we only have one chance to stop them ladies

14:04.880 --> 14:10.840
and gentlemen we got to teach our kids the history, we got to teach our kids this history,

14:10.840 --> 14:16.600
the history of how these charlatans were given power, how they took power and what mythologies

14:16.600 --> 14:26.120
they used to take that power, those mythologies were not all started on the news by these people

14:26.120 --> 14:31.400
up here, they were not all started on the news by these people down here, they weren't even all

14:31.400 --> 14:36.320
started by these people over here, no, no, no, we have inherited these charlatans, these

14:36.320 --> 14:42.080
charlatans have inherited their power from their mentors and if we are going to make

14:42.080 --> 14:48.720
gentle the life of this world like this man wanted to, um, we are going to have to reject the

14:48.720 --> 14:57.920
narratives that, that our controllers are imposing upon us and, uh, and yeah, the only way to do

14:57.920 --> 15:03.680
that I think is to, to teach our kids how to see this wave, this wave of lies, this coordinated

15:03.680 --> 15:09.680
wave of lies, um, this lala palooza of liars, it doesn't matter what stage you were looking at,

15:10.560 --> 15:14.960
you were going to get knocked over by a wave of lies, you were going to get, you were going to be

15:14.960 --> 15:21.920
made to convince that you needed a life preserver, you needed to hold on for dear life, um, and

15:21.920 --> 15:27.040
giga-owned biological is here to teach you to surf this wave of lies by learning biology, the

15:27.040 --> 15:32.160
biology is that surfboard there and it keeps you out of the wave because the wave is just

15:32.240 --> 15:38.880
biological mythology, it's just lies, it's just lies, lies, lies, and so if you can stay focused on

15:38.880 --> 15:44.400
that biology and not take their bait on television, if you can love your neighbor, focus on your

15:44.400 --> 15:49.120
family and friends and building that network, um, you're going to, you're going to get on top of

15:49.120 --> 15:54.240
the wave and then you're going to be able to see the wave for what it is and, uh, please, please,

15:54.240 --> 16:01.520
please, um, if you can find a way to share this work, um, especially if you're not actively sharing

16:01.520 --> 16:08.240
it, it would be great if you'd pitch in, um, because that's how this gets done, um, you know,

16:08.240 --> 16:17.200
I have a PO box that people send folded $20 bills to in the shape of J's, um, you know, like,

16:17.200 --> 16:21.680
these are the kinds of things that I get in the mail, oops, that's the wrong one, darn it,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.880
this one is the one I wanted, this is the kind of stuff that I get in the mail,

16:25.520 --> 16:36.160
folded J's, um, it's super cool, uh, people being creative with their donations, um,

16:38.400 --> 16:42.720
there is a huge paradigm shift happening and I think Vilma is aware of it, I think

16:42.720 --> 16:48.320
Housatonic, Mark, I, Mark, Koolak, Housatonic, ITS is aware of it, I think a lot of people who've

16:48.320 --> 16:53.840
been here for a while with their hands down and looking straight ahead, I think, lumpy gravy

16:53.840 --> 16:59.760
knows that this illusion is starting to break because more people are starting to actively engage

16:59.760 --> 17:06.960
in non-compliance, informed non-compliance, I think it's a new term that Gigo and Biological

17:06.960 --> 17:13.200
just coined right now, um, informed non-compliance, that's what we need to engage in.

17:13.200 --> 17:18.000
Informed non-compliance, I like that a lot.

17:44.160 --> 17:52.160
Good evening, good afternoon, good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it's 10 29 on the 22nd

17:52.160 --> 17:59.200
of May 2024, I'm very happy to be here, um, semi on time, I know that was a really long introduction,

17:59.200 --> 18:04.640
what I'm trying to do is time that out so that I can start that at about 10 to 10 and then at 10

18:04.640 --> 18:09.600
after 10 we'll be all ready to go, it's just, you know, you gotta, it takes a while, this is not,

18:09.680 --> 18:15.360
I'm not making a movie and then just hitting play. I'm running slides and trying to get the music

18:15.360 --> 18:19.760
to come in at the right time and so thanks for noticing that the timing at the end of the beginning

18:19.760 --> 18:25.680
there between Star Trek and the start wasn't too bad because most of the time it's not that good.

18:25.680 --> 18:32.160
Anyway, this is Gigo and Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief,

18:32.160 --> 18:37.440
brought to you by a biologist, my name is Jonathan J. Cooey, I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

18:37.440 --> 18:44.640
I'm originally from Wisconsin in the United States. I did my PhD and met my wife in Amsterdam,

18:44.640 --> 18:51.200
the Netherlands. We also raised our boys for a few years in Norway and then in the Netherlands

18:51.200 --> 18:58.000
after that again before returning to Pittsburgh in 2016, just in time to try and vote for Donald

18:58.000 --> 19:04.880
Trump just to throw a wrench in things and then I don't know how we got here but we're here. I

19:04.880 --> 19:10.800
experienced it all but it felt a little bit like riding in a jeep with mud all over its

19:10.800 --> 19:15.200
windows. I don't know really where we've been and I don't know exactly how we got here and I know

19:15.200 --> 19:19.600
we're in a lot of trouble and if we don't get out of this jeep pretty soon, we're gonna end up in

19:19.600 --> 19:28.880
the middle of the Congo enslaved. So it's my feeling, I'm a human just like you, I just find it funny

19:28.960 --> 19:36.480
sometimes when people think that we are being paid somebody's influencing me something like

19:36.480 --> 19:42.080
that. I'll tell you who's influencing me, the people that it can influence me, they send little

19:42.720 --> 19:49.120
20s that are that are that are like this and if somebody like that says I want you to answer

19:49.120 --> 19:53.360
a question on the stream, I think you're gonna I'm gonna do it. The people that influence me are

19:53.360 --> 19:59.040
sending cards like this that say thank you for what you're doing. You helped me save my daughter

19:59.760 --> 20:06.720
or or thank you for what you're doing. I would have taken the shot if it weren't for you and there

20:06.720 --> 20:12.800
aren't that many people like that because I wasn't saying the right things early enough. I actually

20:12.800 --> 20:19.280
lost my best friend of my whole life besides my wife, my best male friend from college because I

20:19.280 --> 20:26.240
wasn't saying the right things early enough. So if anybody understands the folly of thinking

20:26.240 --> 20:32.560
that solving it and saying it as quickly as possible was gonna save anyone, you were not aware of how

20:34.400 --> 20:39.280
how absolutely difficult it would have been to say the right things at the right time early

20:39.280 --> 20:45.920
because of how many people were in front of us on social media, coordinatively lying,

20:46.720 --> 20:53.520
coordinatively lying about the potential for an RNA to pandemic, coordinatively lying

20:54.080 --> 20:59.760
about the potential for transfection as an investigational vaccine and coordinatively lying

21:00.800 --> 21:07.520
about an ongoing pandemic so that no one would ever reach the the conclusion that

21:07.520 --> 21:11.840
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune

21:11.920 --> 21:16.080
system is dumb or at least a few more generations.

21:18.720 --> 21:24.400
The idea of the pandemic was to make sure that our children would never come to the conclusion

21:24.400 --> 21:28.480
that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

21:28.480 --> 21:36.160
immune system is dumb. The pandemic was made to make sure that transfection and healthy humans

21:36.160 --> 21:42.960
would never be called criminally negligent but just be called a a methodology in development

21:45.200 --> 21:50.320
that the next generations would be great and better if they didn't use process to that we

21:50.320 --> 21:58.240
personalize them for people and to make sure that no one came to the realization that RNA can't pandemic

21:59.200 --> 22:07.280
like that's biologically ridiculous and the precipice that we sit at right now is a precipice

22:07.280 --> 22:13.200
where hundreds of thousands of academic biologists that could just pull their head out of their ass

22:13.200 --> 22:20.720
for 10 minutes and think wait a second what is what does Mr. Cooey mean when he says RNA can't

22:20.720 --> 22:26.160
pandemic and then look over that cliff and realize oh my gosh he's right wait I should have known

22:26.240 --> 22:32.880
that a long time ago we we are RNA RNA now RNA can't do that wait what

22:34.400 --> 22:42.080
and once that illusion breaks then these other two statements on this screen I'm so bad at this

22:42.080 --> 22:49.040
weatherman thing these other two statements on this screen will become apparent in due course

22:50.000 --> 22:58.960
but it's this bottom statement RNA cannot pandemic that's so simple that any academic

22:58.960 --> 23:04.000
biologists worth their salt that rubs their chin long enough or scratches their head long

23:04.000 --> 23:08.960
enough or just goes on a bike ride with those three words taped to their handlebars

23:09.840 --> 23:18.240
can save themselves from this mythology in one fell swoop just one bright idea

23:20.320 --> 23:25.200
because in the end we're dealing with a model of reality that's that's held up by little tiny

23:25.200 --> 23:32.240
toothpicks and any one of those toothpicks that's flicked out will result in kilograms of weight

23:32.800 --> 23:39.440
being redistributed and a whole new paradigm of understanding of our biology will start to emerge

23:41.840 --> 23:49.120
I actually have a feeling in my heart that in the end part of their sort of

23:49.120 --> 23:57.680
pandemic was to orchestratedly bring us there but in a way that would discard the old vaccines

23:57.760 --> 24:03.520
while at the same time moving forward into the future embracing the new generation of vaccines

24:04.320 --> 24:10.480
and so the truth and the and the the misconceptions of the previous vaccines

24:10.480 --> 24:19.600
would be revealed only in synchrony with the populations warm embrace of the new technologies

24:19.600 --> 24:25.760
which have become accepted as obviously more advanced and proven thanks to the coming together

24:25.760 --> 24:32.240
of the world as a result of the pandemic and so this mythology really needs to be broken before

24:32.960 --> 24:38.160
and the people that cannot see are blinded for generations

24:40.400 --> 24:48.400
and it will be done it will be done by social media because we are we are allowing it

24:48.400 --> 24:54.320
because we put our hands we put the phone in front of our face and and this disengages

24:54.960 --> 24:59.520
our control over the 39,000 thoughts a day that we can really think

25:01.200 --> 25:07.600
and maybe you're really smart and you can think 45,000 thoughts a day but the reality is is that

25:07.600 --> 25:14.080
you have a limited amount of time every day and if you waste it on social media on chasing around

25:14.720 --> 25:21.600
the bot comments from somebody or or replying to the bot comments in your sub stack or someone

25:21.600 --> 25:30.800
else's sub stack then you will find yourself unwisely spending the time and energy of your day

25:31.760 --> 25:35.920
in a way that the system or those people that are being paid by the system would like you to

25:35.920 --> 25:41.680
instead of learning the biology and there are lots of people that are going on shan and joy

25:43.040 --> 25:50.880
and and dr drew and they are not teaching you the biology that will save your children they're

25:50.880 --> 25:59.040
not teaching you the biology that that edifies the true understanding of what happened over the

25:59.040 --> 26:05.440
last four years but they are they are emphasizing a mythology or asking questions that will lead you

26:05.440 --> 26:14.000
into this limited spectrum of debate which is a mythology about toxins and the DoD killing Americans

26:14.000 --> 26:24.080
and and these other overly simplified stories I mean if you want to tell a story simply then what

26:24.080 --> 26:30.160
you should say is there are traders inside of most western governments that for whatever reason

26:30.160 --> 26:36.160
mostly serving the weaponized piles of money that control the corporations and governments of the

26:36.160 --> 26:43.760
western world these people are traders to our governments and they are invisible to the

26:43.760 --> 26:46.320
the patriots of our our respective nations

26:49.440 --> 26:56.880
and once we start to make these traders visible and you can start to see them for the the lollapalooza

26:56.880 --> 27:08.800
of liars this hidden chorus of coordinated harmonizing liars then we can get this end this barbershop

27:08.800 --> 27:15.360
quartet we can get this harmonizing to stop but that's what you see on twitter that's what you

27:15.360 --> 27:21.680
see on facebook that's what you see on telegram and gab and all these signal chats it's a harmonizing

27:22.240 --> 27:30.160
and it is a it is a false harmonizing people pretending to say something similar to me

27:30.880 --> 27:37.520
pretending that and they were there all along this is all easily checkable you just have to go and

27:37.520 --> 27:41.680
see what these clowns and i i think that's the only way that you can see them now

27:41.680 --> 27:49.520
that these clowns were saying in 2020 and one of the sort of master clowns that takes up a lot

27:49.520 --> 27:59.520
of space in the clown car is kevin mccernan

27:59.600 --> 28:08.800
um yeah kevin mccernan takes up a lot of space in the clown car because he's actually

28:08.800 --> 28:14.320
whoops he's actually not as tiny as some of these other people are you know i mean

28:15.040 --> 28:21.760
i mean you can fit fauci and and uh hotez and mccairn and rixie all in the back seat and you still

28:21.760 --> 28:27.840
have room for like five more clowns on top of their laps but it's pretty much the passenger seat for

28:27.840 --> 28:34.720
mccernan he's a he's a regular sized human being which is is odd for for the dissident movement

28:34.720 --> 28:43.600
because you know even even uh robert malones kind of a little gnome right and and and and uh who is

28:43.600 --> 28:48.320
the ukranian or russian lady with the with the painting she's also kind of a little tiny person

28:48.320 --> 28:54.080
so have all these little tiny people that are either foreign medlers or tiny people that are

28:54.640 --> 28:59.200
traitors that are cooperating with these tiny people and then you have this american named

28:59.200 --> 29:06.400
kevin mccernan who worked for the human genome project who was out there in april 24th of 2020

29:06.400 --> 29:14.080
already basically telling us the whole story flat out except that he's not he doesn't really buy

29:14.080 --> 29:20.160
the lab leak thing he thinks that you know all these things have have ancestors and so it's likely

29:20.160 --> 29:26.000
just a a mutated version of something that was in the background that before the pandemic we

29:26.000 --> 29:31.360
weren't testing for because we don't test for things that don't make us sick so what i'm gonna do is

29:31.360 --> 29:37.360
play this video again from the very beginning but i will instead play it on the background of my

29:37.360 --> 29:43.920
notes um and i think that will make it easier for us to um follow along and then when we get to the

29:43.920 --> 29:52.000
part where uh if we get to the part where uh we haven't watched before which is about after 17

29:52.000 --> 29:58.240
or 18 minutes um why can't i see this thing right now where did i save it must still be in my downloads

29:58.240 --> 30:05.040
oh yeah um when we get to the place where we we watched to yesterday then we may start pausing

30:05.040 --> 30:11.840
it occasionally but i actually after basketball last night i took some notes on it um and so i may

30:11.920 --> 30:18.800
be able to stop the video less um and just point to notes or accentuate notes in the background um

30:20.000 --> 30:24.400
i'm just i want to do the whole video again because i think this video is so extraordinary

30:25.280 --> 30:31.760
because the statement that i'm trying to make with this video is not a small one the statement

30:31.760 --> 30:38.800
that i'm trying to make with this video is that this can only be seen as evidence that these people

30:39.520 --> 30:45.840
were released on us. Kevin McCurnan welcome to the podcast thank you for having advanced

30:45.840 --> 30:49.680
i appreciate what you're doing here there's a lot i think there's a lot of misinformation

30:49.680 --> 30:55.600
out there and we need alternative views on this so um you and i so that's what i'm saying

30:56.160 --> 31:03.920
we we have a problem if if um let me see if i can do this how do i do this i have to make this like

31:04.000 --> 31:09.440
that then i have to do this right oh yeah so there he starts the podcast already

31:09.440 --> 31:13.680
where there's a lot of misinformation out there and we need alternative views i really like what

31:13.680 --> 31:18.880
you're doing and so again i'm going to try not to interrupt the video because i really want you

31:18.880 --> 31:28.480
to hear his words in continuation in in in their whole context because it is extraordinary and i

31:28.480 --> 31:32.800
want you to just kind of pay attention maybe i'll use maybe i'll use this

31:34.240 --> 31:43.680
for antibody and maybe i'll use that for um or maybe i'll use this for background signal

31:44.480 --> 31:53.200
and maybe i'll use this for antibodies and then maybe i'll use this for um well i'll use those two

31:53.200 --> 31:58.000
primary things to try not to interrupt him and then i'll also annotate my notes so

31:59.200 --> 32:03.840
maybe i'll take a different color here because i got green maybe i does blue show up different

32:03.840 --> 32:05.600
i don't know if you guys can see blue different

32:08.160 --> 32:10.960
can you see blue different oh yeah that looks good so i'll use blue

32:11.520 --> 32:20.560
for for the notes that i make over the notes um and again i just i really want to indulge

32:21.280 --> 32:32.160
the the april 2024 or 2020 the april 2020 kevin mccernan and i really want to indulge in

32:33.200 --> 32:40.560
because in my mind um in april 2024 i was not saying these things and i have videos on youtube that

32:40.560 --> 32:47.360
show that i wasn't i was saying something like this though something very close

32:48.160 --> 32:54.800
except i think i was already saying it was probably a lab leak or something like that

32:55.920 --> 33:01.360
it's very extraordinary where we are i'm sorry i'm having such fish it's like something spit down

33:01.360 --> 33:08.960
there there we go all right let's get it on your button finger is going to be busy yeah it probably

33:08.960 --> 33:15.120
will be um i'm building up a callus on it okay here we go just going to try and let it play as

33:15.200 --> 33:20.000
best i can it's on regular speed okay so here we go we got lots of time today

33:20.000 --> 33:24.240
there's no yoga class this afternoon so if this takes me four hours then so be it

33:25.120 --> 33:27.360
you got to put the helmet on get ready to go here we go

33:31.360 --> 33:36.240
we just figured out how to get our skype hooked up but you were somebody that a good friend of mine

33:36.240 --> 33:42.800
rob long who goes by plantomals on twitter uh pointed you out and said this guy has different

33:42.800 --> 33:49.440
ideas than where what other people are saying and i thought huh that's funny it's a cannabis

33:49.440 --> 33:55.920
genomics researcher maybe he's just getting high and having like high ideas test one too funny to

33:55.920 --> 34:03.120
look at and i i flip over to your twitter and i see that uh you are clearly a scientist you are

34:03.120 --> 34:07.520
looking at data and you are coming to conclusions that are different than what i'm hearing in other

34:07.520 --> 34:13.280
places and you have a very different voice and so i thought man that is a very interesting character

34:13.280 --> 34:17.360
no matter what he believes it's going to be interesting to hear about so thanks for coming

34:17.360 --> 34:23.440
on the podcast man yeah uh well no problem i guess i have to um let me let me give you some sense

34:23.440 --> 34:27.360
the background so everyone doesn't think i'm just out out here smoking weed and coming up with crazy

34:27.360 --> 34:34.000
ideas but my uh my history actually started back on the human genome project in 96 so i worked with

34:34.000 --> 34:40.080
eric lander on that at uh at mit at the white at institute uh i was i was um my responsibilities

34:40.080 --> 34:44.240
there were the build a dna purification and sequencing pipeline for the human genome project

34:44.720 --> 34:48.880
um so i'm familiar with the testing i've been really attentive to what's going on in covid because

34:48.880 --> 34:52.480
everyone's tripping over themselves getting testing going and and this isn't something that should

34:52.480 --> 34:58.000
be a problem the only reason why we have problems in testing is really regulatory if you really dig

34:58.000 --> 35:02.080
into it we can do millions and millions of tests without a problem if the regulations get out of

35:02.080 --> 35:06.480
the way um but my background on the human genome project led me into building some startups i

35:06.480 --> 35:12.320
started a company called agencore biosciences uh that company built dna and rna isolation kits and

35:12.320 --> 35:16.160
was a large dna sequencing facility one of the larger ones actually in the country back in

35:16.160 --> 35:21.520
uh from 2000 to 2005 uh beckman colter came and acquired that company because we had really good

35:21.520 --> 35:27.120
hiv detection tools very pertinent to what we're talking about here in in covid detection um

35:27.120 --> 35:32.960
but we also had a dna sequencer a skunkswork project that was getting built um that got spun

35:32.960 --> 35:39.200
out and later got acquired by applied biosystems this is a dna sequencer known as the solid sequencer

35:39.200 --> 35:44.800
got about 35 percent of the market share competing with alumina for a short period of time um so

35:44.800 --> 35:50.000
that sequencer uh at the time no one really believed what it could do but it was basically a hundred

35:50.000 --> 35:54.800
thousand times faster than what was on the market at the time which is why our our 19 person company

35:54.880 --> 36:00.240
got acquired like a year after publishing a paper on this stuff um but that became a

36:00.240 --> 36:05.920
no way just just my audience is uh very very acquainted with genetics a lot of them are

36:05.920 --> 36:11.440
farmers agriculture a bunch of scientists but when you're saying it's a hundred times faster

36:11.440 --> 36:17.680
to sequence what do you mean sequence what uh so this we were mostly sequencing cancer genomes

36:17.680 --> 36:21.120
of the time but this was thing was it wasn't a hundred times it was a hundred thousand times

36:21.120 --> 36:27.360
faster it was an absolute like in rocket ship um and we weren't the only one that had this at the

36:27.360 --> 36:31.520
time there's a couple other technologies that came at the same time that were hyper competitive

36:31.520 --> 36:36.320
so what you saw on the sequencing market is a rapid decay in the price of sequencing because

36:36.320 --> 36:41.440
we had multiple parties competing in a more or less free market at the time uh and that drove the

36:41.440 --> 36:46.400
cost of sequencing down faster than Moore's law but they say computer speeds double every 18 months

36:46.400 --> 36:51.520
this thing was like going more like 10x every 18 months it was really remarkable at the pace

36:51.520 --> 36:57.280
at which sequencing collapsed now that we have this really cheap and affordable sequencing capacity

36:58.000 --> 37:02.560
it can be deployed there's even tools that can do it on USB sticks now so now you can really you

37:02.560 --> 37:06.800
can actually take a sequencer into the jungle and sequence Ebola you can sequence bats to find

37:06.800 --> 37:12.720
coronavirus you can sequence environmental DNA you you can do all of this work that means that

37:13.120 --> 37:18.080
we're now seeing all of this microbial and viral flux through the through the ecosystem that we

37:18.080 --> 37:22.720
never been able to see before and it's scaring the daylights out of people however if you take a

37:22.720 --> 37:28.800
little bit more of a um evolutionary perspective here nothing is new under the sun genetically

37:28.800 --> 37:33.280
we have seen these viruses all have ancestors and I think that's what's getting missed in the in the

37:33.280 --> 37:38.320
news media is that everyone's talking about this coronavirus like it evolved out of Wuhan

37:39.120 --> 37:43.040
like it came through some Rick and Morty portal and suddenly appeared and now that it's new

37:43.040 --> 37:48.640
it's scary everyone needs to run for the run for the hills but the reality is this everything on

37:48.640 --> 37:54.720
earth has ancestors the burden of proof that your virus doesn't have an ancestor falls on the people

37:54.720 --> 38:00.880
making those crazy claims okay so if there is in fact an ancestor before Wuhan which I'm very

38:00.880 --> 38:06.240
convinced there is we just haven't found it yet we likely have some antibodies to that we've likely

38:06.240 --> 38:12.560
seen it before the human you know inflammatory system the immune system probably has some memory

38:12.560 --> 38:17.680
of one of these things ancestors which is why not as many people are getting as sick as we expected

38:17.680 --> 38:23.200
and I think it's also why we see the antibodies in the population are highly than we ever expected

38:23.200 --> 38:27.440
and now everyone's marching the date back of introduction we heard that oh it got into the

38:27.440 --> 38:31.760
states since the adults the first case well now they're going through some of the morgue records

38:31.760 --> 38:36.080
and digging up older samples and I think you just saw this week that they're inching that date

38:36.080 --> 38:40.640
back you're going to find them inch that date back continually I think because they're going to

38:40.640 --> 38:47.200
start to find cases that predated the December discovery of this Wuhan it was probably out in

38:47.200 --> 38:51.840
in in the depths of China where there are no sequencers for a fair amount of time circulating

38:51.840 --> 38:57.680
their population okay so we didn't have the tools there to find it you've just blown my mind like

38:57.680 --> 39:04.080
no one has said anything like that at all as far as I've heard I would have no way to push back on

39:04.080 --> 39:09.840
that but the like it dawn so I'm going to just clarify here where we are so this is we got this

39:09.840 --> 39:17.920
far yesterday of course and farther where he makes a point that I think cannot be over it cannot be

39:19.360 --> 39:26.240
you don't want to miss and the point is is that since we've been able to sequence so cheaply

39:26.240 --> 39:35.840
remember remarkable how fast the sequencing became cheap the microbiome and and and viral

39:35.840 --> 39:42.080
flux that we can now see is scaring the daylights out of everyone he says sorry that's so poorly written

39:43.600 --> 39:52.000
so that's a pretty bold statement because that's very close to the idea that we are having a

39:52.000 --> 39:57.920
background signal that is being misconstrued as a spreading pathogen and what he's doing

39:58.640 --> 40:04.560
is saying that the reason why not as many people are getting sick as we expected

40:04.560 --> 40:16.560
who's we is because people have previous antibodies to the ancestors of wherever this came from

40:16.560 --> 40:21.440
maybe it was wandering around in the backwoods of China where there are no sequencers

40:22.000 --> 40:28.240
stop lying and so this is a wonderful mythology that's not actually any different than who

40:29.360 --> 40:36.800
it's not different at all than peter desak it's actually not different at all than nathan wolf both

40:36.800 --> 40:42.880
of whom have been touring the world for a decade saying that we need to get more sequences of these

40:42.880 --> 40:51.200
viruses we need more surveillance everywhere do you not see that that guy right there is exactly

40:51.200 --> 40:58.000
the same as peter desak and exactly the same as nathan wolf he is reciting almost verbatim

40:58.640 --> 41:02.080
their exact model of the world the virology

41:06.400 --> 41:14.640
so in that sense let's let him keep doing what he's doing which is just revealing himself for the

41:14.960 --> 41:22.240
the player that he is he plays for them whoever they are what are more weaponized piles of money

41:22.240 --> 41:28.480
that are part of the controlled demolition of america i don't know if it's if it's a crime or a

41:28.480 --> 41:35.600
a potential crime to call someone with traitor but in my very humble opinion if anybody who stood

41:35.600 --> 41:41.920
in front of the senate qualifies as a traitor it's likely him because he has been connected to

41:42.560 --> 41:50.160
the weaponized piles of money and the the the interests that have been working in the background

41:50.160 --> 41:56.800
of this intellectual space for a few decades and in fact is likely connected to these

41:56.800 --> 42:03.840
back room meetings through his father as well and that's probably why he was allowed to take from

42:03.920 --> 42:11.760
mit the whitehead and the human genome project the ip that he created and and to get rich and

42:11.760 --> 42:19.280
make millions from it because that's not typical and so it's interesting because there are other

42:19.280 --> 42:26.160
people who appear to be like this steve kirsch seems to have been given a good idea that as far

42:26.160 --> 42:30.880
as i can tell in all the conversations i've had with him he would never have had himself i don't

42:30.960 --> 42:36.560
know if that guy's ever had a good idea in his life um and so you know when you when you meet

42:36.560 --> 42:40.880
somebody and you and you know that they're that they're bright you know they're bright and when

42:40.880 --> 42:45.200
you meet somebody and you know you're not they're not you kind of know they're not and steve kirsch

42:46.560 --> 42:51.200
his light bulb only gets so bright he wants you to believe that underneath that great big

42:52.240 --> 42:57.120
bald head of his there's something working there but it's really a lot of rusty grinding gears

42:57.120 --> 43:01.520
and it's he's been faking it until he made it since he was a teenager

43:02.880 --> 43:08.720
which is what a lot of these people are i think when they have been told from an early age that

43:08.720 --> 43:14.800
they are part of an elite group of people um that they are a part of an elite group of of people

43:14.800 --> 43:22.080
who govern um that that's who he is you can't be a part of the human genome project as a young man

43:22.560 --> 43:29.280
and sell several companies and be on the the pages of newspapers and and and be able to shake

43:30.000 --> 43:36.800
Francis Collins's hand or be able to shake president clinton's hand um with mark lander by your side

43:36.800 --> 43:44.400
without being connected to the the very very depths of of the network that that is involved in

43:44.960 --> 43:53.680
creating maintaining curating the mythology of public health and of course it is under the guise

43:53.680 --> 44:00.320
of of some you know pot smoking silly guy or whatever but that's not that's not who he is

44:00.960 --> 44:05.760
it wouldn't surprise me at all if that guy is never smoked weed in his life it wouldn't surprise me

44:05.760 --> 44:12.720
at all if he doesn't like bourbon you know that's the kind of man he probably is um anyway let's

44:12.720 --> 44:16.880
keep going because this just just gets better i assure you i've watched the whole thing and it's

44:16.880 --> 44:25.040
just it is just a it is a if this doesn't end him on the internet it will be be as an authority on

44:25.040 --> 44:30.800
this stuff it will just be simply because the system and the illusion of consensus that is

44:30.800 --> 44:39.040
created by this lala palooza of liars will refuse to allow it that the social media algorithms will

44:39.040 --> 44:45.920
refuse to allow it because by the end of this video any any average intelligence golden

44:45.920 --> 44:52.160
retriever wouldn't listen to this guy anymore it's on me that it seems like it might be correct

44:52.800 --> 44:58.000
that this this virus had ancestors that that wiped out a bunch of people but then there were

44:58.000 --> 45:04.240
those that had the antibodies that could protect themselves and um or it may not have been as

45:04.320 --> 45:08.640
oh sorry anybody this is the thing we don't sequence things that don't get you sick we don't

45:08.640 --> 45:12.720
sequence things so the ancestor may have been a common cold uh that just went through the

45:12.720 --> 45:16.960
population we don't sequence things that we don't want only until it mutated maybe very

45:16.960 --> 45:22.720
recently did it start to take out the very weak in the population the comorbid i mean 99 to 97

45:22.720 --> 45:26.640
percent of the people that are getting sick or comorbid they have either diabetes COPD or

45:26.640 --> 45:31.520
hypertension maybe cancer right um so this is the tip of the iceberg of the most sick people

45:31.600 --> 45:35.520
in a population that are now getting affected i think if you go back to this ancestor's thing

45:35.520 --> 45:40.080
it probably was attenuated and didn't didn't really appear in our radar because it was barely

45:40.080 --> 45:47.120
making people sick it was less virulent than maybe what's emerged out of Wuhan but if it was

45:47.120 --> 45:51.840
an ancestor it may still have similar proteins it was attenuated he says

45:53.520 --> 46:00.000
and there's somebody else who says attenuated dan seratkin his dad is carl seratkin they wrote

46:00.000 --> 46:04.960
one of the first papers that claimed it was a lab leak he's still running around with his

46:04.960 --> 46:12.400
head cut off on social media saying that it's flying AIDS and after my bike ride that promoted his

46:13.680 --> 46:21.760
his original blog with his dad i was asked to be in drastic and they promoted that bike ride video

46:21.760 --> 46:27.680
on zero hedge and it's still the youtube video they got the most views ever like 15 000

46:28.480 --> 46:34.320
and that's really what got me into the lab leak got me sucked in got me to feel like i was really

46:34.320 --> 46:41.280
solving the scooby-doo mystery with these other foreign medlers and so that's not really you know

46:41.280 --> 46:47.440
we're not really that far off if he says it was attenuated why what does attenuated mean in the

46:47.440 --> 46:54.400
context of a natural occurring background isn't by definition if the background is hot and we don't

46:54.560 --> 46:59.440
sequence things that don't make people sick then doesn't that mean that the whole background is

46:59.440 --> 47:10.320
a tenuated but attenuated implies reduced attenuated replies turned down or reduced so why would you

47:10.320 --> 47:17.280
use that word it's the exact same word that a lot of other people in the medler worst case scenario

47:17.280 --> 47:25.520
people were using to describe an attenuated virus used as an investigational vaccine that had

47:25.520 --> 47:34.640
reverted to virulence it was a story that many of these medlers were telling in 2020 because i was

47:34.640 --> 47:42.640
there i was arguing with them i was arguing with them i know so when i hear the word attenuated i

47:42.640 --> 47:46.960
don't think oh yeah that's cool whatever that's that's a fancy word that no that's that's part of the

47:47.520 --> 47:53.040
the neuro-linguistic programming that these people are engaged in they're all using a similar

47:53.040 --> 48:02.320
vocabulary which actually provokes a similar idea set a limited spectrum of debate

48:04.000 --> 48:10.320
that's why Dan Saratkin Carl Saratkin and Yuri Dagan and all these people in drastic

48:10.320 --> 48:16.560
and we're using the word attenuated and that's why he chose to use it here because it is a

48:16.560 --> 48:22.720
coordinated symphony of liars ladies and gentlemen they don't just ought to accidentally use the

48:22.720 --> 48:28.320
same words because those words are just shared lexicon among these people that know about pandemics

48:29.360 --> 48:39.920
stop lying attenuated holy balls that our immune system has found so so a virus can you do what

48:39.920 --> 48:44.720
did i think if you go back to this ancestor's thing it probably was attenuated and didn't didn't

48:44.800 --> 48:50.000
really appear in our radar because it was barely making people sick it was less virulent than maybe

48:50.000 --> 48:56.720
what's emerged out of Wuhan but if it was an ancestor it may still have similar proteins

48:56.720 --> 49:02.640
that our immune system has found so so a virus can mutate in a way that doesn't change its

49:02.640 --> 49:07.280
epitopes the epitopes are the proteins on the surface of the virus that your immune system

49:07.280 --> 49:12.560
builds antibodies for you can get a mutation in this virus it's only 30 000 letters long

49:12.560 --> 49:16.160
but only a few of those letters really let's just listen to that again to make sure we see

49:16.160 --> 49:21.280
in our radar because it was barely making people sick it was less virulent than maybe what's

49:21.280 --> 49:28.160
emerged out of Wuhan but if it was an ancestor it may still have similar proteins that our immune

49:28.160 --> 49:34.800
system has found so so a virus can mutate in a way that doesn't change its epitopes the epitopes

49:34.800 --> 49:40.160
are the proteins on the surface of the virus the epitopes are the served on our proteins on the

49:40.160 --> 49:48.640
surface of the virus that's definitely a lie that is immunomythology 101 thanks to Francis Collins

49:48.640 --> 49:54.320
this is what virology wants you to believe but this is a gigantic assumption that that

49:54.320 --> 50:01.440
overlooks the idea that the body the dendritic cells that will the the the antigen presenting

50:01.440 --> 50:08.640
cells that will process whatever these foreign particles are it's not just looking at the outside

50:08.640 --> 50:14.160
of the virus the proteins on the outside of the virus that would be ridiculous and why is that

50:14.160 --> 50:19.600
why is that ridiculous well because when a cell i'm just going to draw a picture because i want

50:19.600 --> 50:27.520
you to see the the depth and the breadth of this guy's bullshit i just it it irks me because he's

50:27.520 --> 50:35.040
pretending to be a biologist that understands where the irreducible complexity is and that he's

50:35.040 --> 50:40.480
teaching you you know how to appreciate it and it's exactly the opposite he's trying to convince

50:40.480 --> 50:46.480
he's trying to mislead young people into thinking that there is no irreducible complexity anymore

50:50.240 --> 50:58.240
antigen presenting cells are going to select most likely the damage associated molecular

50:58.240 --> 51:04.160
patterns that they find presented by cells that are infected huh what are you talking about man

51:05.120 --> 51:08.960
i'm talking about the fact that when a cell is i don't have a picture for it i'll have to

51:08.960 --> 51:15.200
just get my slides out later when a cell is infected if if you believe the cartoon

51:16.400 --> 51:22.560
of the immunology that we have been taught about viruses and so this is again arguing with

51:23.200 --> 51:29.680
kevin mccurnan using mostly accepted principles in virology and immunology which may

51:30.320 --> 51:35.200
in reality be bullshit or be based on bullshit assumptions

51:37.440 --> 51:42.560
but there are still very useful observations that have been made that need to be reinterpreted

51:43.760 --> 51:53.600
and so going on my best reinterpretation i would say that the immune system is challenged

51:53.600 --> 51:59.920
constantly by its environment and by this background signal that he claims is unknown because we

51:59.920 --> 52:07.600
don't sequence everything which i've been saying for three years now in a in a better way and he

52:07.600 --> 52:13.440
has stopped saying in since 2020 i think because he's talking about double-stranded DNA in the shots

52:13.440 --> 52:20.320
only the the argument about whether there was a pandemic or not is irrelevant to his his public

52:20.320 --> 52:25.200
appearances now and so that's notable because one of the points that i make regularly is that

52:25.200 --> 52:32.160
none of these clowns can summarize the crime if these people were calling the cops they would call

52:32.160 --> 52:37.840
the cops and say people were being killed by the shot and that's that's the phone call that they

52:37.840 --> 52:41.440
would make and that's what they would expect the authorities to show up and put everybody

52:41.440 --> 52:48.080
that vaccinated someone in jail that's what they hope and so it doesn't catch the liars it doesn't

52:48.160 --> 52:51.920
catch the people that lied to the dod it doesn't catch the people that lied to

52:52.560 --> 52:57.680
the the patriots in the executive branch to convince them that this was happening

52:58.560 --> 53:04.160
and there are liars who lied to patriots i'm sure of it because the entire government

53:04.160 --> 53:09.920
and the entire dod has not been turned against the american public in the world that would be absurd

53:11.360 --> 53:17.840
but what is possible is that the dod was set up to take a fall it is possible that if you if you

53:17.840 --> 53:23.680
listen to these people talk like like they don't mention everything all the time how many people

53:23.680 --> 53:30.080
do you know that mention the fbi could be behind people like george web or or even robert malone

53:30.800 --> 53:35.360
has anyone ever considered the possibility that the fbi could be running some of these people or

53:35.360 --> 53:42.000
maybe the cia is maybe the state department's intelligence agency is running some of these people

53:42.000 --> 53:49.520
maybe and they're paying a contractor to run these people but to simply say that the dod

53:50.320 --> 53:56.880
is responsible for this pandemic would ignore the lies that p.r. corey has likely told it would

53:56.880 --> 54:03.520
ignore the lies that robert malone has most assuredly told it would ignore the obfuscation that

54:03.520 --> 54:10.080
bret weinstein has engaged in since before the pandemic in 2019 it would ignore the obfuscation

54:11.040 --> 54:18.400
that sam harris has engaged in for for so long as the as the unwitting accomplice of these

54:18.400 --> 54:25.920
weaponized piles of money that he is it's a lot of the same way that if you say there was a mass

54:26.800 --> 54:36.560
psychosis it it excuses the people who induced it if you call exiting a theater because you hear

54:36.560 --> 54:44.320
gunshots and and trampling over people a lemming effect um then and blame it on the people who

54:44.320 --> 54:49.600
who couldn't stay calm when they left the the theater then you're completely absolving the

54:49.600 --> 54:54.480
person who lit the fireworks off in the corner from having caused the problem in the first place and

54:54.480 --> 55:00.480
in this scenario i believe that these people were originally brought on the scene to make sure that

55:00.560 --> 55:06.240
we would debate about whether this natural virus was somebody's responsibility or not

55:07.600 --> 55:14.320
and that we would debate whether our response to it was too harsh or not that was the only

55:14.320 --> 55:19.520
limited spectrum of debate that they thought they were going to need to trap us in and you

55:19.520 --> 55:24.400
can hear it here because he's basically over the next 20 minutes going to completely discount the

55:24.400 --> 55:30.160
idea of a lab leak like if it's a lab leak then you're going to have to prove it because everything

55:30.160 --> 55:35.200
has ancestors that's what he said make sure you understand that it this short into the video

55:35.200 --> 55:40.640
we're only you know a few minutes in he's already said that he's taken the side of the natural

55:40.640 --> 55:45.520
virus because everything has a ancestor and it could have just come and been circulating in the

55:45.520 --> 55:50.880
backwoods of china for a long time where we were at sequencing so he made the peter desak argument

55:50.880 --> 55:55.840
he made the nathan wolf argument that it's a natural virus until proven otherwise

55:55.840 --> 56:03.600
and that's extraordinary because it's hard to prove a negative right so he's setting up the

56:04.320 --> 56:11.200
long haul of the scooby-doo mystery that it's going to take us a while maybe our best evidence

56:11.200 --> 56:17.760
will be that that Rand Paul and Tony Farchie argued in front of the senate it's amazing

56:18.800 --> 56:22.960
it's going to take me a while even with the notes because I really I want this to be the end

56:23.920 --> 56:28.560
I don't there's no more debate after this these words just keep getting more and more

56:30.240 --> 56:37.280
revealing there's just no way that this is this is some random dude this is this is part of the

56:37.280 --> 56:44.400
orchestrated narrative control that was done as a part of a national security operation executed

56:44.400 --> 56:50.720
on us and the world and call the pandemic a pandemic that's what you're seeing here there can be no

56:50.720 --> 56:57.360
doubt in my mind that your immune system builds antibodies for you can get a mutation in this

56:57.360 --> 57:02.720
virus it's only 30,000 letters long but only a few of those letters really code for epitope

57:02.720 --> 57:08.320
proteins proteins your immune system recognizes other mutations like let's say you get a mutation

57:08.320 --> 57:13.200
in the gene that encodes the RNA polymerase that's in there there's an RNA dependent RNA polymerase

57:13.200 --> 57:17.120
that encode it's encoded in this genome that's the thing that copies the RNA let's say that thing

57:17.120 --> 57:22.080
gets mutated so it's faster and it copies an RNA faster and maybe it spreads a little faster

57:22.080 --> 57:26.320
but it doesn't change the surface proteins so your immune system could still see it

57:26.320 --> 57:30.560
but it might spread faster it might replicate faster it might hurt the older population a little bit

57:30.560 --> 57:36.400
more so when you're thinking about the variation that we're already recording on this virus

57:36.400 --> 57:41.520
a good site to go to is called neck strain this is the the team up in Washington in Seattle

57:41.520 --> 57:46.640
doing a great job tracking all of these viruses courage everyone to go take a look at neck strain

57:46.640 --> 57:51.120
this is where all the epidemiology is being done on this and they'll have a phylogenetic tree

57:51.120 --> 57:56.080
there that shows you all of the viruses they've sequenced it's about 3,500 in there today they've

57:56.080 --> 58:00.080
sequenced the entire genome with 3,500 of these that's not a lot when you consider the number of

58:00.080 --> 58:04.160
infections that are around the world we're only getting a really tiny sliver of all the

58:04.160 --> 58:07.920
viruses that are out there through the sequencing program is what they're incredibly valuable

58:07.920 --> 58:14.000
if you look at all 3,000 or 3,500 of those sequences you'll find on average there's about

58:14.080 --> 58:19.360
one variant per virus maybe a little bit less than that there's probably a thousand to 1,500

58:19.360 --> 58:25.040
variants in that database right now so there's a lot of different versions of COVID circulating

58:25.040 --> 58:30.720
not all of those changes actually impact the virility of the of the virus so don't get scared

58:30.720 --> 58:37.040
when people say it's mutating mutations natural usually when viruses mutate they mutate in a way

58:37.040 --> 58:41.440
so that they're less harmful to the host so they can spread faster a virus that kills its host

58:41.440 --> 58:46.240
very quickly doesn't go very far right so they try to find this balance of spread how do we how

58:46.240 --> 58:51.040
do they get the you know how do they spread as far as possible and to do that you really want to

58:51.040 --> 58:56.640
have asymptomatic spread because if you if you're a virus that's asymptomatic you go really far

58:56.640 --> 59:02.320
really fast okay now this thing may have mutated to such a way that it goes really far and really

59:02.320 --> 59:07.440
fast but it happens to be a looped argument so it takes out the top edge of the population that

59:07.440 --> 59:12.320
that's already immunocompromised okay it's ancestors however may not have done that

59:12.320 --> 59:18.080
as ancestors may in fact have been less virulence and spread very quickly but our immune system

59:18.080 --> 59:24.080
may have some record of that and so I think what's going on in the news media is is clickbait and

59:24.080 --> 59:29.040
in fear cells and so everyone's saying it's a new virus we've never seen it before everyone

59:29.040 --> 59:35.200
be afraid to be very afraid the media did it it couldn't possibly be a national security

59:35.200 --> 59:43.600
operation that's co-opted the media it couldn't possibly be an elaborate hoax that's been set up

59:43.600 --> 59:48.800
by hundreds of clowns on the internet that are being paid by weaponized piles of money to make

59:48.800 --> 59:54.880
sure that this controlled demolition of America goes through without a hitch couldn't be a guy

59:54.880 --> 01:00:02.880
like that oh my gosh I hope he goes to prison someday when there's just no evolutionary basis

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.240
for that you know unless this unless you subscribe to the concept that came out of a lab

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.760
well then maybe it has a different origin but everything else that's natural has ancestors

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.200
and the burden of hope is on those people who claim it doesn't to say that it's somehow

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.640
emerged magically out of a bat different theory of its ancestors however may not have done that

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.560
as ancestors may in fact have been less virulence and spread very quickly but our immune system may

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.480
have some record of that and so I think what's going on in the news media is is clickbait and

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.000
fear cells and so everyone's saying it's a new virus we've never seen it before everyone be afraid

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.840
be very afraid when there's just no evolutionary basis for that you know unless this unless you

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.520
subscribe to the concept that came out of a lab well then maybe it has a different origin but

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.880
everything else that's natural has ancestors and the burden of proof is on those people who claim

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.120
it doesn't to say that it's somehow emerged magically out of a bat um now there there are

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.680
bat sequences out there they're very distant from what's in the human population right now

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.560
um and have you heard of the uh the connections to bat and pangolin and cast yes I had uh lord

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:21.120
matt riddley on and he was talking about how why why bats are the particularly evolved to

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.800
spread to humans and where the mammal connection is and why okay things like cows don't spread

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.040
that many diseases to humans so oh interesting okay well so the right now the literature on this is

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.520
that this probably diverged out of bat 40 to 70 years ago all right now we we don't know exactly

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.960
when the zoonotic event was like was it in bats for 40 to 70 years and then leapt over to humans

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.800
of december or did it leap sometime in the last 40 to 70 years into human uh and if it has been

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.080
in human in a less virulent way we probably have never sequenced it you wouldn't particularly in

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.400
china you wouldn't go and take an asymptomatic patient and let's just go look at their their

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.520
viral DNA or viral RNA that's in that patient because um it's it's a bit um say to go and hunt

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:16.000
for viruses in metagenomic samples it's harder to do metagenomic samples are what this whole

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.600
book is about metagenomic samples are how they've always looked for coronaviruses and all the other

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.760
dark matter of life um by looking at the background signal and amplifying everything and then feeding

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.520
it through an algorithm you can probably pull a lot of stuff out of nowhere I don't know to the

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:39.520
extent to which this can be abused but the idea that it can't be abused is absurd and this is one

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.480
of the blocks on which the no virus people have stood very solidly it's another one of those

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:52.400
places where if you just pay attention to their critique of metagenomic sequencing they are sharp

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:58.800
as a knife if you just listen to mark bailey explain what's going on with metagenomic sequencing and

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:06.960
what isn't going on they're sharp as a knife and so it's very interesting that he brings it up

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:14.640
as a technique which is which is usable and high fidelity um it's very comical that this guy

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.360
who's later gonna admit the host is gonna admit that he used to work from Monsanto was already

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.560
able to score an interview with Matt Ridley who hadn't even finished the book viral with with

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:34.000
Alina Chan yet because of course Alina Chan's paper that details the supposed you know stability

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.640
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome relative to the SARS-1 genome that pre-print that hasn't been published

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.040
yet but she already got a job at the Broad Institute as a as a staff scientist that hasn't been published

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.480
but this book got published that paper that I did two bike rides on and then everybody ignored

01:03:52.480 --> 01:04:00.400
including Alina and I couldn't understand why and it was because of course the stability of the

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.960
viral genome was not evidence of a lab leak like they wanted it to be the stability of the genome

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.400
was evidence that they planted the same genome in multiple places and that's why there seemed to

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.480
be very little evidence of evolution during the first six months of SARS-CoV-2 it's also very

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:25.440
possible that the primers that they chose to use belied a a very slow evolutionary rate because

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:33.680
they weren't honestly trying to evaluate the changes that were occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 genome

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.280
the problem with it is is that Alina Chan's paper still isn't published the problem is is that I

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.120
think Alina Chan's paper actually showed it was quite likely that it started from a highly pure sample

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:52.640
and that's why the divergent speed that is typically observed in viruses that we managed to get a

01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:02.720
a consensus genome from wasn't seen Alina Chan's paper showed a 50 amino acid a 50 amino acid that's

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:10.720
not bases that's amino acids changes in some of the sequences of SARS-1 during the course of that year

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.400
and it's certainly in the first six months there were huge changes that were occurred every time

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.560
they were managed to get another consensus genome however same rate of change was not observed in

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:30.160
the first six months of the genomic information that was available and in fact in May she published

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:36.960
a paper saying it's almost not changing at all and that paper print is not out this book is out

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:44.640
and I believe that pre-print demonstrates that a non-natural phenomenon is being blamed and

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.880
being mischaracterized as a pandemic there's no way that this high fidelity of a sequence is

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.720
being found in this many places unless they just put it there and there are very simple ways for

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:03.600
them to do it because not only sequencing but the production of synthetic RNA and DNA sequences

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:11.280
has become infinitesimally cheap remarkably fast just like he described so all the

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.560
methodologies are there to fake one none of the methodologies are there to create one

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.120
and now you know

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.440
microbiome which are like the bacteria and fungi that are in your body really readily

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.600
because they have conserved sequences that make it really easy to spend in human in a less

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.920
virulent way we probably have never sequenced it you wouldn't particularly in china you wouldn't

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.360
go and take an asymptomatic patient and let's just go look at their viral DNA or viral RNA that's in

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:51.760
that patient because it's it's a bit like I say to go and hunt for viruses in metagenomic samples

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.040
it's harder to do we can sequence your microbiome which are like the bacteria and fungi that are in

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.240
your body really readily because they have conserved sequences that make it really easy

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.720
to target them with with PCR amplify them and sequence them and get beautiful pictures

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.120
the viruses don't have these conserved sequences so you really have to sequence all the RNA that's

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:17.520
so he's he's admitting that it's actually hard to use a PCR test to just to just find a virus it's

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:24.160
very easy to use metagenomic sequence to characterize your genome and the genome composition of your

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.280
microbiome which is of course extremely valuable data that everybody acknowledges we all want to

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:37.280
collect on each other on our children over time multiple times you know like when you sample from

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:45.600
a guys who are a girl saliva at college for weeks in a time week after week it's very trivial to

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:52.480
get a sample of the microbiome and of the genome week after week it's really easy it's trivial but

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:59.520
to sequence a virus week after week is quite difficult says kevin mccernan of the human genome

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:07.760
project mit and whitehead institute shall we run it back so you can hear exactly how malevolent it is

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.240
what he says and understand that the words cannot be misconstrued to mean anything else it's very

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.840
very easy for us it's trivial for us to sequence your genome and to sequence and characterize your

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.280
microbiome from a sample like this it is not trivial to characterize all of the viruses in there

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:33.120
because there's so many mutations but we can go out into the jungle and sequence viruses with a

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:45.600
little usb stick i don't get it what's happening here you're watching a liar engage in the active

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:57.040
curation of a mythology that extends before the pandemic to basically edify all public health

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.920
narratives including the vaccine schedule which i guarantee you kevin mccernan will never ever ever

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:11.040
question at least peter mcculler is doing that at least nick hudson is doing that speaking out

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.160
against vaccines in general is something that none of these cowards will ever do because

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.200
they play for them

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.680
i know he's not going to do it in 2020 obviously but he won't do it in 2025 either

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.120
he plays for them he's been playing for them since he dropped out of college don't you get it

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.760
okay well so the right now the literature on this is that this probably diverged out of bat

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.400
40 to 70 years ago all right now we we don't know exactly when the zoonotic event was like was it

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.360
in bats for 40 to 70 years and then left over to humans in december or did it leap sometime

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:56.000
in the last 40 to 70 years into human and if it has been in human in a less virulent way we

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.680
probably have never sequenced it you wouldn't particularly in china you wouldn't go and take

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:05.680
an asymptomatic patient and is he repeating himself or is it just me is he already in the hamster

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.000
wheel or is it just me is he repeating this for vance to make sure that vance gets it because he's

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.600
not saying it better he's not giving more detail here this is the same bullshit thing he said five

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.600
minutes ago that oh you don't sequenced up we don't get sick you could have been going around and

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.880
he's repeating himself and let's just go look at their their viral DNA or viral RNA that's in that

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:35.120
patient because it's it's a bit like i say to go and hunt for viruses and in metagenomic samples

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.320
it's harder to do we we can sequence your microbiome which are like the bacteria and fungi that are

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.600
in your body really readily because they have conserved sequences that make it really easy

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.640
to target them with with PCR amplify them and sequence them and get beautiful pictures the viruses

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.800
don't have these conserved sequences so you really have to sequence all the RNA that's present in

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.600
someone's in someone's sampling to find the viruses you have to spend a lot of money sequencing

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:06.720
to find these needle wait what i thought we could use a PCR test with a single primer

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.960
that's what the FDA did i've got the documents i'm assisting with a case right now in california

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.160
where the test was only one amplicon for the end protein what the hell is this guy talking about

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:26.320
we don't need to sequence all the RNA in a sample did he just make a huge mistake here

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.840
or am i just crazy like i think he made a gigantic mistake here that's something that he's

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.240
certainly never said again i bet right after this robert malone sat him down and goes look dude

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.560
at 17 minutes or something you say some bullshit here you got to be careful

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.800
we're not going to be sequencing all the RNA and all these patients what are you talking about

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:54.720
kevin you got to be really careful dude i'm going to run it back so you can hear how wonderful it is

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.240
i don't know if you can try to misinterpret this i don't know if somebody could explain it to me in

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.760
a better way but it sure sounds like he says some pretty pretty incredible shit here in china you

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.800
wouldn't go and take an asymptomatic patient and let's just go look at their their viral DNA or viral

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.840
RNA that's in that patient because um it's it's a bit um like i say to go and hunt for viruses in

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.120
in in uh in metagenomic samples it's harder to do um we we can sequence your microbiome which are

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.160
like the bacteria and fungi that are in your body really readily because they have conserved

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.680
sequences that make it really easy to target them with with PCR amplify them and sequence them and

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.520
get beautiful pictures the viruses don't have these conserved sequences so you really have to

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.400
sequence all the RNA that's present in someone's in someone's sampling to find the viruses so you

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.880
have to spend a lot of money sequencing to find these needle in the haystacks and i don't think

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.600
anybody does that on patients that are asymptomatic there's just no financial motives to it but once

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.160
it becomes virulent people start sequencing and then they see all right we have a new virus we

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.680
haven't really seen before and the closest thing to is 40 to 70 years ago in bats and that's the gap

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.880
that we have so there's a lot of information missing between what's known as rat g13 which is the

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:13.760
bat virus um 40 to 70 years ago and the wuhan thing that we detected back in december and unless you

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.280
believe viral evolution stopped in that time frame and this thing just popped out of nowhere um i

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.440
don't really subscribe to that i think it has ancestors that are slightly different from what

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.840
we have today that date all the way back to the zoonotic event and those ancestors are something

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.800
that are really important to understand to get the epidemiology of this right to know what are

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.840
the actual antibody repertoires that are in the human population they're going to be more related

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.200
to the ancestors than this most recent thing that's only recently spread through the population since

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.320
since since don't forget ladies and gentlemen that this might be just before the supreme court

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.400
decided to say that antibody as intellectual property is kind of bullshit let me repeat that

01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:00.800
i'm not really sure when the supreme court decided that antibodies as intellectual property were kind

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.440
of resting on some shaky ground wiggly um and that they wouldn't stand up to the strict scrutiny of a

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:15.440
patent challenge uh based on a yales law school review called the antibody patent paradox that

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.160
none other than that very easy to ignore guy named snooze-atronic found about two years ago

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.600
and so mark kulek and i but thanks to mark covered the antibody patent paradox in this

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:37.200
huge i mean mega shift in the way that intellectual property could be valued behind the scenes at

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:44.880
at big pharmaceutical companies because heretofore if you buy a company you buy their ip and a lot

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:51.680
of that ip might be monoclonal antibodies for this or that and monoclonal antibodies as patents

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.680
were noticed to be kind of cookie cutter and noticed to be kind of biologically

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.440
incorrect and that the assumptions that are made in the you know this is how you make the

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.560
antibody and therefore we make something and so you have to give us a patent that whole

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:18.080
supporting argument ends up to be based on a lot of biological hand waving and the supreme

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:25.920
court basically said that um and this of course is a 150 dot of 50 billion dollar industry before

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:33.840
the pandemic and so a lot of the the wrangling behind the scenes at the beginning of the pandemic

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:39.600
remember a couple of three weeks ago we watched this interesting um tabletop discussion with

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.400
donald trump and a lot of these people from these different companies and antibodies were at the

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:51.280
fore and i believe that antibodies were at the fore because this this antibody paradox thing

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.280
hadn't actually landed yet and so it's very curious that here he is on the internet

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.120
again talking about what you should hear as essentially intellectual property

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.080
Antibodies are potential intellectual property a repertoire of three antibodies is an intellectual

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.880
property that could be given as an example would be z-map for example this combination cocktail

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.160
of three monoclonal antibodies that was being tested by Canadian researchers and by American

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.760
researchers with regard to Ebola or something like that or compared to remdesivir or something

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.840
like that and so there are therapeutic combinations of monoclonal antibodies and even those combinations

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:43.920
in theory were weakened in their intellectual property value by this change in in the in the

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:51.840
the thinking of the supreme court and yet here of course at april 24th 2020 it's highly likely

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.960
that this isn't this isn't the case yet and so antibodies are still this big thing where

01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.600
you know there's a lot of there's a lot of potential money to be made with already existing

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:07.440
product lines and already existing manufacturing pipelines that don't need to be changed at all

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.840
and so he would know that of course because he's been in this since he was a teenager

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.680
i say snooze-atronic with the utmost affection of course you know that mark and i are as

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:30.000
as thick as themes tember so do you think that this is a dangerous disease

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.200
i don't think it's much more dangerous than the flu and i know there's hashtags out there you know

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.800
shaming scientists who say not the you know not the flu or it is the flu but if you look at a lot

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.120
of the antibody data is coming out um you gotta be a little bit cautious of the antibody data

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.640
these are early antibody tests or through the FDA um not that the FDA makes them any safer but

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.200
they are they do go through some review to see that other other people can reproduce these these

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.680
results but the the false positives and the false negative rates might be between two and five

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.720
percent on some of these tests so that means if you want to look for the population presence of a

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.920
disease that's below two or five percent you have a hard time doing it because the false positives in

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.440
the test end up looking either the right about the same rate of population prevalence when the

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.840
population prevalence gets to the point where it is like in new york um these false

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.720
different rates are are more in the noise compared to the actual real positive rate and so

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.920
we're in a perfect time frame to figure this out right now a lot of the state is rolling in and in

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.560
the places where the population prevalence of the disease is high i believe the antibody data

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.160
and i think we're starting to see that in new york in other places there's a really high load like

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.640
two percent of the population in new york has antibodies that's not a false positive from the

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.840
test it might be false he's saying antibodies a lot right there you hear that right now it's

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:55.440
repeating so often it's like the term and that is a a absolute conscious choice because there are

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:03.840
somewhere between 20 and and and 30 other cell types and processes in the immune response

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.920
relevant to a respiratory virus that could be discussed if you just wanted to go into the bear

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.960
literature of coronaviruses you would go back to 2005 or so where the um what's his name oh it's

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.480
gonna i'm gonna i'm missing it um i'm getting it mixed up with stanley plock and his name is

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:32.640
the other coronavirus guy is stanley something i think um stanley shard he's at he's at iowa

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.120
and he's on the who committee for coronaviruses and he did the first papers after sars which

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:46.080
looked at what mice and their immune systems what where the response is and he found that um

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:54.800
he found yeah stanley pearlman jeff from earth you are the man um stanley pearlman found that it was

01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:01.200
the t-cells that were required in the t-cell memory that gets made to the RNA dependent RNA

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:09.040
polymerase that was did a determining factor in whether mice could um survive an inoculation

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:17.520
of of the sars virus clone so they took this this RNA and they put it in a mouse and it made

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:23.760
them sick and a lot of the mice died but only the ones that that had their thalamus removed

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.040
thymus removed excuse me they had their thymus removed those those animals died immediately

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.920
the ones that had their thymus intact could recover and in fact it was the t-cells

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:40.320
that that are in the title you know t-cells are required for for clearance of sars or whatever it

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:49.680
was and so it's really interesting that that he is so focused on the frances collins model of

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:56.240
immunity the tony fauci model of immunity the niaid model of immunity the correlate of immunity

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.840
that the fda that he says sucks and is in the way all the time that's the only correlative

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:08.640
immunity that the the fda uses so in one sense he's going to hammer the fda or hammer these people

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:13.760
but in the same sense he's totally fine with antibodies being as the primary indicator of

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:20.000
immunity because he keeps saying it over and over again to this guy who clearly needs more education

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.320
you

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.800
incredible it's an incredible thing to see in real time

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.720
positive is elevating that number from like maybe 10 to 14 percent but it's there's no way

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.200
the false positive numbers in those tests are actually causing the entire number of those tests

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.240
to go to go to go on positive so so that the test will get better i think what's going to

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.720
happen is people will start deploying two different antibody tests to every patient and that will

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.880
error correct some of this noise that's going on right now some of this noise is because when

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.280
you design an antibody test you have to pick one antibody to go against the virus you really

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.440
should probably be picking two or three because there's enough variation in these viruses that

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.000
you might you want to have two different checks on it if you will it's kind of like measure twice

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000
cut once philosophy i'm building this is all intellectual property of him and his friends

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.480
you see it right we need more tests we need more tests we need more products we need more

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:21.040
IP we need more EUAs but EUAs are bad in a little while but um they're bad because they they take

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.440
so much paperwork we should just let people do stuff a lot of people use in these testing so I

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.440
think when people start deploying two tests against a lot of the patients we'll wipe out a lot of

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.120
this noise to the false negatives and false positives and get a much better picture yeah deploy

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.920
studies are starting to do that but even if you look across the globe the antibody numbers are

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.880
coming in high and so that changes your thesis in the epidemiology if the antibodies are that

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:49.040
high this is either spreading a lot faster than we think just possible um or it's been here a lot

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.040
longer and he's spreading at the same rate i think it's more likely the latter that it's been here

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.240
longer people have been getting asymptomatic buildup of antibodies uh and see what's dangerous

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:04.560
here is that this is before the all the all the arguing and all the cover-ups and all the emails

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:10.160
are released so he sounds pretty reasonable right i i don't think it's a lab leak i think it's much

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.840
easier to explain that it just emerged from a background and now we're we're tracking some

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:26.240
rogue mutant but he can't possibly get to the stage where the national security state would be

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:34.000
lying about that background he can't possibly get to the state where the fear and uncertainty and

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.640
lying about that background and then associating bad protocols with the identification of that

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.520
bad background could result in the murder of americans that the national security state would

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.280
lie about in order to convince americans to accept transfection technologies as investigational

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.160
vaccine and that there's no way that somebody who used to work for the human genome project

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.200
would ever be involved in such a an elaborate illusion

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.480
and of course i believe that he is that we didn't know about because they weren't presenting

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.400
complications in hospitals and so we have a a little bit of level of herd immunity

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.960
now herd immunity is a term it doesn't often get used until you're above like 50 or 60 percent

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.880
and we may not be there yet but we're on the way there and we will probably be there very shortly

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:25.920
in some areas where the vast majority of the population starts to get antibodies to this

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.680
and then you have to stop and ask what's the ledger on this right we've got we've got this

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.680
concern of millions of deaths which haven't occurred and i think they haven't occurred because those

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:43.120
models frankly assumed a an immuno naive population that this virus would be hitting they assumed the

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.200
virus was so new that our systems had never seen it before and therefore everyone who got hit with

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.400
it would be would not have antibodies now i think it's important to understand that explaining this

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.320
is important it was important for the national security state narrative to come

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.680
because again what is he explaining he's re-explaining that the government response

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.040
might be worse and because they were responding to what he didn't say the words but you can hear it

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.040
the worst case scenario was he thought that everybody would be vulnerable and if everybody's

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.840
vulnerable that is a worst case scenario so he agrees with that but what he thinks is is that

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.240
there's previous immunity that is making their predictions not come true then separate from that

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.200
there are these bad models that are also making predictions that aren't coming true and so it

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.080
seems like the government response although it's well-meaning may have been bungled it may be

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:39.520
hurting more people than i thought and so he's making this argument that's not very different

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.680
from now not making a very different argument from j about a charia and these other people that were

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.240
on this this great barrington declaration

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.880
if i disappear it's because that's a missile coming in but i don't think it's a missile

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.160
maybe that's being challenged right now maybe some people do have antibodies and so it's not

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.880
spreading as fast and as commercial as they thought the other side of the ledger is

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.720
government response to this uh which i think throughout history can be far more deadly than

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:20.400
any virus if you're not careful unleashing government action you can end up with stallions

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.600
and miles and pole pop now it's interesting it's interesting because who made this argument as well

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.920
actually jordan peterson did if you remember very carefully to the one clip of him i've ever

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:37.120
used he argued that fighting infectious disease because infectious disease often brings in

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:44.160
totalitarian governments we might be fighting totalitarianism across the world by eradicating

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:52.000
infectious disease do you remember that he said that please tell me you skilled giga ohm

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.920
watchers can remember how many times we listen to him say that that eradicating

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.600
infectious disease may actually eradicate totalitarianism and that would be really cool

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:11.760
and here is kevin mccernan in april of 2020 saying that well i mean if you give government

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.920
total control i mean you know in one of these black swan events you could end up with a pole

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:24.800
pod or a stallion i mean man alive if you can't see how spectacular this is i really don't know how

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.600
to help you hudson and hitlers that that maybe they have good intentions maybe they don't but

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.160
they put in these decentralized plans that end up destroying economies and starving millions of

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.440
people uh now we've got what 26 million people unemployed has that the numbers come out yet

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:46.160
okay so um yeah that ledger needs to be considered in this uh if you're weighing

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.640
a precautionary principle on this say this could be very deadly it's an exponent it's a black swan

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.840
we need to be very cautious here uh if you don't apply that same precautionary principle on the

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.480
repercussions of government intervention uh you're really cheating the world you're really not being

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.880
honest with yourself because you can have the government go in and just wreck the economy with

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.160
26 million unemployed and kill far more people i mean you know right now state street cancer

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.160
patients are considered non-essential or there's with their electives this is nuts the hospitals

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:24.160
are empty and laying people off that's doubly nuts uh so if we're not treating cancer patients

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:30.880
and they're dying is that murder or not kevin if we're not treating cancer patients and we're

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.480
calling them covet is that murder or not kevin if we're finding lots of ways to drive up

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:46.080
all cause mortality and and you see this is the exact cognitive dissonance that these people are

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:54.400
were from the very beginning employed to to enact on us and and teach to our children

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:01.040
via social media and we bought it hook line and sinker so that that precautionary principle is

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.920
very dangerous to use if you don't take a bossy out approach here where you look at the scene

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.920
in the unseen if you only look at the scene saying we see all this viruses

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.360
we're gonna we're gonna shut down the economy and you don't stop and look at well what is the

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.960
impact of economic collapse uh you're not being honest that's that's not a balance sheet that's

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:24.240
that's that's wait so is he predicting economic collapse in in the april of 2020

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.320
sure sounds like he knows a lot doesn't it for being a molecular biologist that's sequencing

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.160
pot he sure knows a lot about about how the world works and how totalitarianism works and how a

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:44.800
pandemic might be used to results in economic collapse boy it'd be it'd be sure bad if if

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.280
essentially the pandemic ended up to be a controlled demolition of my home country wouldn't it

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.960
capital t trader ladies and gentlemen in my humble opinion this is a capital t trader

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:05.360
selling out my kids and yours right now for the highest bidder as as experimental animals in

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:11.840
their transhuman plan to i don't know use ai to crack the genome i guess

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.920
oh that's the wrong mouse gee whiz that's bias and i think the media is all focused on that bias

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:28.240
i am uh equally worried about the the loss of liberty and i and i when i brought it up with

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.760
people in just the simplest of terms should should we suspend the ability for people to be able to

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:40.800
go to church for this disease because that was a right before and people were like absolutely

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:47.760
that right doesn't exist and and and and would fight basically anybody to say that

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.800
that you shouldn't go to church and that should be suspended and give him a little time he's

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.320
gonna argue about masks thinking like well if you take away that power what's to make certain that

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:04.160
you you'll get it back from from the from the larger government and nobody thinks about that

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.680
because they think we're all in a time of caring and pulling together but maybe pulling together

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:15.200
is centralizing governmental authority far more than what people are calculating i think you've

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:20.640
hit on it right there is this is a decentralizing virus it's changing itself it's spreading across

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.600
the globe into many different geographic niches and you cannot kill that thing by centralizing

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.760
human decision-making you have to decentralize human decision-making we have to kill that thing

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.320
how can adapt to this differently can't kill that thing floating around in china is not the

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.640
same as the one that's right now and in sweetie nor is it the same one that's that's necessarily

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.280
in other geographic zones because they've mutated and the population they've entered is different

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:51.920
but that's not what the sequences show don't you see don't you see he's he what is he talking

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:59.120
about right now he's talking about bullshit because a few months from now the the actually

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:04.720
a month from this date alina chan's gonna release data that shows that that's this is not a case

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:11.200
at all the virus is the same everywhere matt riddly publishes a book with alina chan

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.320
but that paper never comes out it just remained a pre-print and is now gone and she works at the

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:24.320
broad institute at mit the broad institute you know where where where lander works his former boss at

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:31.280
the at the human genome project it's not that big of a clown car and they all fit in it don't you see

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:39.280
how is it possible that it's so easy for mark and I to put these simple people puzzles together and see

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:46.240
that this is a a coordinated symphony a lollapalooza of liars and it doesn't matter what stage you rock to

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:52.880
you're always going to be rocking to a form of the selected narrative of the state the all of the

01:32:52.880 --> 01:33:00.080
presuppositions will never be questioned

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:07.440
we are not even close to done with this

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:14.560
poser clown trader okay so there are papers now showing that the the polymorphisms in the ace

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.920
two gene this is the gene that the that the um the the virus enters into the cell right well

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.120
there are variants in those genes and some granted this is early it's pre-print data um but the

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.520
preliminary data on this shows that there are certain mutations in the human population that

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.480
are going to make the virus bind more effectively and other ones that are going to block it so

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:39.920
already know there's a spectrum of human polymorphisms that are going to react differently to any given

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:44.880
viral strain and on top of that we have a matrix of different strains that have different variants

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.920
that are circulating so um another paper came out yesterday suggesting there are variants in the

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:54.640
hla region of the of the human genome this is a region that's involved in immune uh an immune

01:33:54.640 --> 01:34:01.600
response so which one was at the ace two paper or the hla receptor paper which was

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.920
misconstrued distorted as or presented as evidence that different ethnicities would have

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.120
greater vulnerability to the virus was it both of them i don't even remember

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.040
isn't it curious that this guy's pushing this out now and that you know three years later there

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.440
would be a little video of robert f Kennedy jr. saying exactly the same thing at a dinner that

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:28.880
would go viral that it was a designer virus that was engineered to hit a certain racial group

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.280
what other raccoons have you heard say that before

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:47.360
that certain hla genotypes are actually more susceptible to covet fatality um so as this thing

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:54.800
is moving from new york to kentucky to the it's not moving from new york to kentucky

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.520
because there's no evidence of spread from new york to new jersey you

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:09.920
but of course at this time in april 2024 pere kori was just getting into his group

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.400
he had just recently dropped in air dropped into new york city and i just recently dropped into

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.000
a bunch of of podcasts to tell everybody that this this indicator right here was going to save

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.480
the united states because all the people that come to his hospital have a pulse ox of like 80

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.280
it's a coordinated symphony of liars that was unleashed on us in 2020 and until you dig deep

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:44.960
enough you're not going to see how how awful it is why am i attacking everyone because there

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.440
aren't very many good guys ladies and gentlemen that's the reality if you don't like that then i

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.000
guess this program isn't for you i guess reality is a little too much for you to chew on

01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:01.680
but is it really that surprising if you watch that 2017 girdano interview or or lecture that

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:08.480
you don't think that with a few million dollars they couldn't get a bunch of schmoes on the internet

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:17.520
to span the spectrum from kevin mccernan to kevin mccernan to to Andy coughman and tom cow and all

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:25.360
the way to debunk the funk brian wilson or what dan wilson whatever his name is they're paid for

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.440
by different weaponized piles of money but they're all clowns performing the same limited spectrum

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.520
of debate dance on one of many stages at the lollapalooza of liars

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.120
and the reason why i'm so upset with this guy is because he messed with me and my family for

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:50.880
a really the whole pandemic basically from 2021 on he has been trying to be influential in

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:57.120
in limiting my spectrum of debate and i believe he also engaged in tortious interference with

01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:01.680
a business relationship because he like christine grace sent some kind of random

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.880
complaining letter to mary holland who was guess what already on their team in some way

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:18.400
because she's been involved in a year few years now of sabotaging the efforts of chd wasting

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:25.200
their money spending it on ridiculous things instead of you know saving children

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.720
ladies and gentlemen i know that this is hard to swallow but there aren't very many good people

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:42.640
anymore and the ones that the programmed algorithms and programmed software of social media put in

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.840
front of people are not good guys can you not imagine that that twitter does not allow you to

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.640
see good guys unless you are conscious of who they are already have you not imagine the scenario

01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.120
that facebook does not let you see who the good guys are unless you already know who they are

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:13.440
skilled social media browsing cannot be used to find the truth skilled social media browsing to

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:25.200
find the truth will lead you to kevin mccernan it will lead you to sof's mom it will lead you to

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:33.440
pere cori on dr drew or pere cori at the the the national citizens inquiry in canada that has

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.800
been wholly co-opted and is no longer the citizen led movement that it was a year a year and a half

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:48.560
ago these weaponized piles of money aren't going to give up because this is for all the marbles and

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.360
in order for you to see who these weaponized piles of money have working for them you're going to

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.880
have to work a little harder than signing into twitter you're gonna have to look work a little

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:05.440
harder than allowing the youtube algorithm to teach you you're gonna have to listen to the words

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:15.760
that they said in 2020 and really accept what they mean i got lots of pages to go lots of time to sit

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:21.760
this isn't done until it's done play the same centralized plan in both of those places that's

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:27.040
the virus that's the biggest danger we face is that we take a one-size-fits-all approach

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.640
and and roll that out into the marketplace so i think when these people are saying we need to

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.800
centralize when you one guy in charge they're not recognizing that the right thing to do in a

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.680
pandemic isn't to choke the economy to have one guy run it i mean look last night he's talking

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:47.680
about disinfectants in your blood right talking about trumpy trump don't want to say his name because

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.960
he has you know trump's a bad guy here comes that's not the answer the answer is to stimulate

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.400
the economy rip all the regulations off of it turbocharged the economy let everyone go to town

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.080
on this thing and we'll have drugs and solutions no regulations at all rip all of it down wow what

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:12.320
does he think the prep act does what does he think an EUA is this is already absolutely

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.160
hilarious to me because instead of saying that by declaring a emergency under the prep act they

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.520
have ripped down all the regulations he actually pretends as though it's not doing anything for him

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.520
you're going to hear in a minute that the EUA is a pain in the ass you got to have people like

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.240
robert malone help you get the EUA's far faster than we will if we let everybody sit around and

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:39.760
wait for one guy to push each option through the FDA that's not going to solve this it's different

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.840
in every jurisdiction every local environmental condition in every hospital

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.240
has different demographics different viral loads different viruses and different genetic

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.200
populations they're dealing with and what they find works in alaska's likely to be very different

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.880
than what they find working in miami and and and to essentially control this and govern this as

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.280
action does he mean that ivermectin might care cancer in miami but it won't care cancer in

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.560
alaska or does he mean that the prophylactic use of ivermectin will only work where the variants

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:16.560
that are vulnerable to ivermectin go holy shit it's really hilarious what's going on here i mean

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:25.680
i can't believe it actually the biggest virus we have going around do you think that uh the

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.560
also the bad ideas are also virus you see the bad ideas are also virus everything can be

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.640
referred to as virus we don't need to talk about murder it's virus we don't have to talk about

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:43.680
bad ideas and bad it's all a virus that's going around oh my gosh i'm i'm sad i'm sad that i didn't

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.280
watch this like two years ago so that when i still had a chance to talk to him that i could call him

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:56.000
the trainer that he was right to his face demographics different viral loads different viruses and

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.480
different genetic populations they're dealing with what a monster they find works in alaska's

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.480
likely to be very different than what they find working in miami and and and to essentially control

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:12.960
this and governess is actually the biggest virus we have going around do you think that uh the

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:19.520
destruction the the hospitals being overrun in new york was a result of them being overprepared

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.040
or are you saying no i actually i believe that they had many many more people in the emergency

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:33.040
room than normal but that um that what do you believe happened in new york city is the host

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:40.960
asking right now 24th of april 2020 we've got here cori telling us what happened in new york so it

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.840
would be very surprising to me if he doesn't say oh my gosh there were crazy cases everywhere even

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:51.040
though we know there weren't the the containment of it was always going to be at this level well

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.280
you've got to back up and say why why didn't they have enough beds right there's certificate of

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.680
need law that the house in order of hospital to build out beds in new york they have to get their

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.960
competitor hospital to approve it that's why they're in enough beds that's the problem with central

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.880
wise plan hey jessica did they run out of beds in new york city hey jessica hockett did they run

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:18.160
out of beds in new york city what in that sam hell is he talking about here wow i gotta run that

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:24.240
back to make sure i heard it all in one go was a result of them being over prepared or are you

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:30.080
saying no i actually i believe that they had many many more people in the emergency room than normal

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:37.360
but that um the the containment of it was always going to be at this level well you you've got it

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.240
back up and say why why didn't they have enough beds stop lying certificate of need law that the

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.560
house in order of hospital to build out beds in new york they have to get their competitor hospital to

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.600
approve it that's why there are enough beds that's the problem with centralized planning you you've

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.560
got a government who put regulations in place that have certificate of need laws give it to those

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.960
uh those don't make any sense i've never heard of that so yeah so if the hospital the the

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.120
the health care industry the reason there are asks in a first world country is nothing to do

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.560
their inability to make masks it has to do with the fact that we've got regulations that make it

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.080
economically unwise to make them in the united states do to labor laws and and perhaps maybe

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.960
environmental laws so they all got pushed overseas but we know how to make paper masks the country

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.560
could do it but it's it's they need to go through the fda a mask and these go through the fda right

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:35.600
and at one point when they realized that the f masks make no mistake about it kevin mccernan is

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:42.320
advert advocating for masks and he's upset because the fda got in the way and so we don't have as

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.360
many masks as we need because the fda is such a pain in the ass especially during a prep act

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.600
declared pandemic an emergency declared by health and human services the fda is still a pain in the

01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:09.520
ass says kevin mccernan ladies and gentlemen this is this is major league trader is lying here

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320
so

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.080
yeah so if the hospital the the the health care industry the reason there are asks in a first world

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.280
country is nothing to do their inability to make masks it has to do the fact that we've got

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:32.720
regulations that make it economically unwise to make them in the united states do to labor laws

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.360
and and perhaps maybe environmental laws so they all got pushed overseas but we know how to make

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.480
paper masks the country could do it but it's it's they need to go through the fda a mask and these

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.320
go through the fda right and at one point when they realized that the fda was in the way they

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:54.400
told people to wear bandanas i mean this is this is not being spoken about but it's it's because of

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.200
the fda that we have them micromanaging whether a mask is safe or not that we don't have enough

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.720
masks we don't have enough masks says kevin mccernan

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:17.520
we don't have enough masks says kevin mccernan why because the fda this virus is spreading so

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.120
fast asymptomatically that we have to get rid of the fda to fight it

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.960
i'm starting to get a little angry now i'm going to need to do something here i don't know what but

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:38.720
and and then get in trump involved saying i'm going to make all the masks and then bid against

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:42.480
the local politicians to own all the masks and then give them back to them and some kind of

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:49.280
political gestures is just all show uh the the real root of the problem here is that why do we

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.040
have the fda regulating 25 cents of every dollar ever spent they're unelected right they they pay

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.720
no price when they're wrong and if you look at the revenue streams from the fda two-thirds of the

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:04.240
revenue coming from the fda are from the padufa act of 92 padufa act in 92 means that the fda

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:09.520
is paid by the people they regulate the pharmaceutical industry so he's telling us to pay

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.080
attention to two different laws that probably don't matter at all relative to the prep act

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:22.320
he's literally avoiding saying that the prep act is the foundation for the emergency under which

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.800
euas are granted and how the fda is currently acting is in the context of the emergency declared

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.800
under the prep act instead he's talking about certificate of need laws

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:40.560
and some act in the 90s that gave the fda some power do you see it ladies and gentlemen yet

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:47.920
for how awful and malevolent it really is and how there is no other way to assume what he was doing

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:54.320
in front of the senate talking about double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA contamination of the

01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:04.880
mRNA shots he is still acting as part of this narrative control group and these controllers

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.840
are effectively working against you your family and every other american

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.200
that at one point or another believe that their government was working on their behalf

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:25.600
and we have been we have been turned over we have been sacrificed by traders that are inside of our

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.880
government and inside of other western governments that's for sure and i believe that this man is

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.080
cooperating with those traders for the benefit of his family and multi-generational wealth that he

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:42.720
has already built and in fact if you look at any of these people that have actually risen

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.560
significantly on social media all of them are in the midst of building intergenerational wealth

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.680
they're all trying to escape the millionaire velocity that they're just tasting for the first

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:06.320
time in their long lame lives and they're seeing as much as they can get before this whole illusion

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.320
collapses that's what you see now

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:18.800
and this man is one of the highest players because of his extended extended experience

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:24.400
working with them he's been up he's been a player on their team since he he took the intellectual

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.440
property from from mit and whitehead and started his first company

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.080
wittingly or unwittingly probably because of his dad's connections he's already been playing

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:42.240
for the national security state the biosecurity state that is trying to globally enslave humanity

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:49.120
he was probably aware that this plan was coming for much longer than any of us ever dreamed

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:57.120
and that's why he's so comfortable talking this level of nonsense in this precise of terms

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.840
and why he is repeating things about the FDA and about viruses and about virology or about

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:10.160
testing and antibodies and antibodies and antibodies because it is a narrative control operation

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:19.120
and this crow guy Vance Crow is probably just just not sophisticated enough to understand

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:24.400
and how could you be when somebody like Kevin McCurnan is coordinatedly lying with someone

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:33.280
like Robert Malone and Francis Collins and Tony Fauci and Peter Dasek and Ralph Barrick and all

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:39.040
these other people who are aware that a pandemic of an RNA virus is impossible but it's a very

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.480
very good story with which to enslave generations is who's paying the FDA that's where most of their

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:50.400
money comes from all right so how are they an adequate regulatory agency when most of their

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:54.080
revenues come up from the people they're supposed to be the watchdog for all right this isn't a

01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:00.800
regulatory system this is a bribery system veiled as a regulatory system that enables large entities

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.160
that can afford the process to get through and they all swap like a revolving door but it's a really

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:11.200
it's a really strange position to take in light of the prep act emergency

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.240
and he's going to double down on it listen it's going to go on and on and on he's making a mountain

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:26.160
out of a non-existent mole hill the FDA is not in the way they're giving FDA they're giving EUAs

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:32.000
to anyone and everything I've got evidence of what they they approved in California as a PCR test

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.640
and it's laughable it was a PCR test that was actually produced and manufactured by the largest

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:45.440
genomic company in in China and used to test municipal employees in in the United States for

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:53.120
coronavirus for a with a single amplicon in April of 2020 exactly when this video is from

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:59.920
and this video he says that you have to sequence all the RNA in someone to hope to get the viruses

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:05.680
it's a lot harder than sequencing the whole genome or the microbiome which we can do very easily with

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:12.400
metagenomic sequencing there are mistakes in this video ladies and gentlemen because they were arrogant

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:19.520
because they never thought that they would get so far off script that over 60 percent of Americans

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:26.880
would not be fully vaccinated and 40 percent of Americans would be untouched they never thought

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:36.080
they would be in this quandary but they are thanks to us just a few of us not very many of us and

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:43.040
certainly no mice there's no mouse army coming to save us most of the mouse army is full of shit

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:52.880
and so if you are a mouse it's time to become just use your normal name or at least ditch the

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:59.200
mouse thing because it has been co-opted by medlers just like the mutton crew but different

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:04.320
just like the people that follow around certain people in sub-stack comments so it looks like

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.040
there's a conversation going wow it sure looks like people are taking this clown seriously

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:14.480
but that's the only way people take clowns seriously if you put them on a podcast and have someone

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:21.120
else say wow you're blowing my mind dude i've no one's ever said this before dude and now there's

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.360
an illusion of consensus in front of your face that you can't seem to break the illusion of

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:35.520
that's what the senate committee was even if there were good people like del big tree or or

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:41.520
brian hooker who are good or maybe not i don't know i'm i'm sure brian hooker is a good guy

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.400
but how much good can brian hooker do when he's surrounded by liars like kevin mccernan and and

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:55.760
and and jill glass poule melon robert melon maryll nass harvey rish

01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.680
pere quarry

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.120
there are some really hardcore players ladies and gentlemen that make it very hard for other

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:13.280
well-meaning unwitting participants to break out this is one of the worst ones that's why i'm working

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:20.160
so hard on this video today this guy has more people fooled than anybody and the consensus that

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:26.640
steve kirsch thinks he's right and and mccernan thinks steve kirsch is right and that that illusion

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:31.440
of consensus then makes other people think that well then they can't all be wrong right

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:39.120
all you got to do is have one private conversation with kevin and and steve kirsch and robert melon

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.040
on a on a private zoom chat where they're all agreeing to try and manipulate you and you're done

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:52.480
unless you already know that they're liars and so more than anything what needs to happen right

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:59.840
now is that we need to we need to be on the shadow of a doubt demonstrate that these people were

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.640
telling us lies in 2020 and therefore we should not take them seriously into 2024

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.480
best-case scenario for someone like robert melon is that he there isn't much recorded and he wasn't

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:16.800
saying very much because he was working so hard to get a novio approved or get a novio into the ring

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:23.200
but once that became clear that that wasn't going to happen jill and robert decided to start claiming

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.000
the intellectual property of genetic vaccines for themselves in hopes that they would get some

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.560
credit when the nobel prize was inevitably rewarded

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:40.080
then robert melon accidentally revealed that peter colis was the guy who designed those lmp's

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.920
and then we found this video where he says that we've never been able to control where they grow

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.480
or where they go they always go everywhere i wasted lots of people's lives on that

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:53.840
you don't think that this guy who's been in bio tech for his whole life knows that already knew

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.200
that already at the start of the pandemic knows that that's a real issue right now and instead

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.880
is talking about irrelevant laws and trying to slag off the fda even though the fda doesn't

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.600
do anything once a an emergency is declared all they do is just sign pages

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:16.080
listen to the story that he's about to tell you about how bad the fda is between the different

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:23.440
boards from fishers board into the fda to monsanto's board into the fda this isn't what america thinks

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.120
this is a highly sophisticated wealth redistribution system that's going on

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:33.760
and and that's why we don't have masks that's why we don't have beds so if you get rid of those

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:40.480
centralized we don't have masks and we don't have beds because of the fda and bad laws so keep in

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:48.000
mind jessica hocket in case you catch this later he says that the problem in in in new york city

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:55.040
was the lack of beds and something called a certificate of need law plans the economy will

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.920
work but what's happening is people are saying ah this guy's falling we need more central plans

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.480
and it gets worse so i i don't that that's my two cents on it is that this is an artifact of

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:12.720
choking an economy not unleashing it i mean of the 30-some odd guess that i've had no one has said

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:20.000
anything to me as dangerous as the thing that you just said there like um i'm i'm all the way

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:26.000
to the point of being uncomfortable for the first time on my own show but i i know like

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:32.640
regulatory capture is a real thing people don't realize that the that in my example i used to work

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.440
at monsanto and the the the people that were protesting against monsanto that stood outside

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.680
and and held up posters they weren't paid for by monsanto but if monsanto could have paid for

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:52.160
them they would have paid for double of them why because the protesters made them go out and make

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:58.800
everybody afraid of of uh genetic engineering and what you can be spraying out there and so

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.240
they would go to the government and they'd say you know what you're right people are afraid go

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:07.440
ahead and give us a few more years of regulation and we'll prove that it's safe by the way each

01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.720
additional year that you stack on is ten more million dollars in regulatory burdens so if a

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:19.040
little company wants to come in and compete they now have to get through 13 years of regulatory

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:25.120
trials at ten million dollars a year there's no chance it's a giant moat built around it and

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:32.880
it makes it so we have a very choked out uh biotechs interesting so the argument that he makes is

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.840
that monsanto is fine with the fda extending the years that they investigate because then that

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:42.720
makes it harder for competitors to catch up i wonder what pamela thinks of that i think that

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.160
sounds like uh that sounds like a pretty bullshit argument to me it hurts small companies is

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:54.000
it helps giant companies because the fda doesn't do shit that that's what they should have said

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.360
right i don't know but maybe it's it's probably both custom maybe it's a reasonable point let me

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.360
let me just kill this phone really well wait maybe someone else killed it i never use that

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:08.160
line so it's probably the census calling to see if i'm still around no worries no worries i'll cut

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:16.080
it out why would the census call him to see if he's still around uh yeah i mean that that's um

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.920
so i've been involved in a lot of small startups and so i see this and feel this pressure all the

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:24.880
time when you're a ten person company and you're trying to compete with giants like kaijin or these

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:31.600
large entities they have a lot of advantages that are mostly regulatory uh and the same

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:37.120
thing's true with the testing going on right now so right now um have a look at what happened with

01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:41.840
the cdc right they were the only people allowed to do testing for covid when this first hit that

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:47.360
hit the shore they they filed up the test took us forever to get all the other labs started now in

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:52.560
order uh to get your lab to run a covid test you couldn't just be any other lab you had to then go

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:58.080
to the fda and get an emergency use authorization which shows is an EUA one of the things i would

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:07.280
say to nano sensors in the chat um i appreciate that comment is they will for sure exaggerate the

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:13.120
fidelity of the end product so imagine that they can make RNA with a with some kind of molecular

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:18.320
printer and then they they print out you know a lot of RNA and then they give you an eppendorf

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:23.520
tube i think the exaggeration is going to be that here you go this is an eppendorf tube full

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:29.040
of only one RNA and we can prove it when in reality there's probably a lot of mistakes a lot of

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.960
errors a lot of partials a lot of whatever's and so maybe the average is what they want it to be

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:40.480
or maybe the a majority of molecules present are what they want to be but the amount of contamination

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:46.800
that will be present the amount of incompleteness whatever um i think that noise is such a significant

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.960
fraction and such a potential you know you're not going to be able to understand but all those

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.080
things will do right so that that i think is one of the points that definitely needs to be made that

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:04.320
they they don't that they even if we we're already giving them something i'll say it that way if we

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:11.280
if we assume that an infectious clone for example which we're now trying to call a DNA clone or an

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:18.240
RNA clone when it's made is it really a clone it's probably not um because that's also a stochastic

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:24.000
process so it's a very good point um again the exaggeration of fidelity cannot be underestimated

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.240
they're always doing it um i think okay to get the test approved by the fda i used to be in the

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.360
testing space too i ran a klea laboratory um klea is a certain regulatory certification you get to

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.880
be able to do test human samples um it's a racket as well we'll touch on that but that's fda um

02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.040
that's that's that's it's a violation i think of of the human genome project we did we did the human

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.640
genome project so you could effectively read your own genome and now you can't the government has to

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:55.760
get involved if you ever want to read your genome this is like the human genome project it's a violation

02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:02.480
of the human genome project because we did the human genome project so you can read your own

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:10.720
what that's weird 23 means been regulated in weird ways as well but back to the cdc is they

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:15.680
declare monopoly no no lab wants to go and build a test that the cdc is declared monopoly over so

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:21.760
we're all unprepared cdc fumbles a test cries uncle asks everyone else to get involved fda

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.440
substance that's wait a minute you can't just go and do this test without an emergency use

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.560
authorization in case of emergency you have to break glass and oh sorry don't break the glass

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:34.000
you have to fill out 10 pieces of paperwork and send it to us as to why you want to help out

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.120
in this emergency thank god that steve kirsch had robert malone to help out with those 10 pages

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:45.440
of paperwork right the research that i've done as a result of consulting for a case in california

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:50.800
has led me to believe that there wasn't much to do other than to write a you could probably cut and

02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.880
paste a methodology and and and fill out where you were going to get your test from and send it in

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.840
and and some random guy from the microbiologic section of the fda would just sign it and say

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:09.520
here's your letter that says you can go but he is actually here spending time like multiple

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:16.640
multiple 10 minute segments trying to convince you that the fda even in a prep act emergency which

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.880
i'm not going to actually speak out loud of course because that would tell you the law that's relevant

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:28.640
here that in a prep act's emergency these damn euas that fda just gets in a way it's just so crazy

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:35.360
it's just shitty it's too much paperwork without a friend like robert malone how does anybody get

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:40.320
through this stuff right i mean that that's insane when there's an emergency you need to get rid of

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:46.480
the paperwork not not ask people to fill it out so every he's repeating he's repeating himself

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:50.640
one right now is trying to get emergency used authorizations for their kids so they can get

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.120
into the marketplace and the fda's choke i'm sure the people there are working really hard late at

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.520
night i know some of them they're not bad scientists it's more that the structure that they have has

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.160
no competitors and no accountability when they're wrong their budgets get bigger you will notice the

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:09.120
cdc and the fda got more money by screwing up they didn't get less all right that doesn't happen in

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:14.240
the free market you you screw up you lose customers and they go to your competitors right um so so

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:19.040
so you see screws up they get more money they relinquish this the rest of the world starts

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:24.560
starts doing the test they run into the fda's eway once they get past the eway only kleilabs

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.560
can run it kleilabs have to have mds on staff that sign off and every report this is all to do pcr okay

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:37.360
pcr is was invented like an e6 by carried mollis this technology is like 40 years old and it's like

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:48.080
making chocolate milk i mean it's like making chocolate milk

02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:59.440
i'm still confused because i'm pretty sure about 20 minutes ago he told me that viruses are hard

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:05.040
to sequence because there's so many variants of them and they don't have any conserved sequences

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:12.560
and so it's hard to pull them out of metagenomic samples but now pcr is like making chocolate milk

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:21.120
yes pcr is like making chocolate milk and it can be very very accurate if done correctly like

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:27.040
may all your primers be nested which they weren't may you use multiple amplicons

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:30.480
and also several positive and negative controls which they didn't

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:38.640
pcr is like making chocolate milk for everybody in academia and everybody in academia that

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:44.400
knows how to use pcr should pull their head out of their ass and inspect what we did for pcr testing

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:51.920
in america and over 200 eway approved diagnostics where we didn't use positive controls didn't use

02:05:51.920 --> 02:06:00.320
negative controls only used one amplicon and nobody used nested primers you don't think captain

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:07.840
genome here knows about nested primers is he going to explain the difference between a pcr

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:12.320
chocolate milk with nested primers or not come on guys

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:22.320
this bonfire is going to go on for hours it seems really really simple this is stuff that

02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:30.240
in the field we have devices that can detect cannabis like genetics in the field that growers

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:37.120
can use their color metric tests that run off a usb driven pcr device that just change color

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:40.640
if the amplicons there so we can and so the amplicon for sex

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.400
that's in every cell of the plant that's identical in every cell of the plant that is

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:54.960
conserved across all the plants of that species is easy to detect because he told us

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:58.640
20 minutes ago that genomic DNA is easy to detect

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:06.640
in the same phrasing that he said RNA viruses are hard to detect

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:14.160
but now he's making the magnificent leap to tell you that pcr using to detect a virus

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.920
is as easy as chocolate milk

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:23.760
but i'd love to hear the explanation for this incongruency from the man himself

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:34.720
because this is just plain sad they really think that we were so stupid we weren't going to go back

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:41.840
and see that these medlers were just medley he's just singing a song that he learned from france's

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.960
columns he's just singing a song that harmonizes with with peter desac

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:54.720
but go on kevin tell us more about your your white horse determine the sex of a cannabis plant

02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:00.720
in a cannabis grow all right we don't need you know you can do this at home but they don't they're

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.840
getting in the way if you're doing this at home the ultimate way to decentralize this testing is

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:09.440
to do it at home you don't want to have everyone run to a hospital to get tested because then they

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:15.280
get infected the hospitals are the super spreaders right so centralizing the testing in hospitals is

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:20.800
is like idiocy and it's what's happening because of regulation this should be done at home so you

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:25.520
get a test at home and you figure out okay i'm sick i'm not going to go anywhere i got my answer

02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.840
maybe i'll double check it with a doctor who has a slightly better test but you could screen 90

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.680
percent of the problems if you had home testing but the home testing is is virtually illegal right

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.800
now although i know a lot of people that are just doing it because they're so angry at the fda i bet

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:44.960
it's buck halter he's testing himself at home and they they don't believe it's the right of the fda

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:48.960
to get in the way of them reading their own genome and it isn't we paid three billion dollars to

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:54.000
have the human genome project done and after it we now have layers and layers of regulation for

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.720
any person to go and read the hospitals are super spreader events i think because they gave them

02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:03.280
supplementary oxygen the moment they came in the door because p-air cori spread that rumor

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:09.680
and so did the cdc what do you think about them apples super spreader events my ass

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:14.960
i tell you what was super spreading was really bad ideas like a great big virus

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:25.600
that's crime it's double taxation in many ways and there's no there's no double taxation because

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.760
the human genome project was meant to let you read your own genome and now they're

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:39.360
the fda's in the way that's double taxation this guy is the most hilarious pseudo libertarian ever

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:46.640
real logic to it other than fear that fda's here to keep you safe you make sure all those tests are

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.240
accurate and they're right and they don't do shit to make sure it's accurate or right they just

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.440
process your paperwork and that's it they don't do any but then why are they how are they holding

02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:02.160
you back if they don't do any testing they just process your paperwork then how is the fda getting

02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:11.040
in the way i think this guy has actually smoked a lot of weed before this i mean come on this is

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:19.280
crazy talk how can you possibly be i mean this should have blown people's brains apart listening

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:24.960
to this nonsense it's so contradictory did i get to the bottom of this fda again someone

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.560
or caliber no we got to wait for that sorry i get we didn't get there yet reproduction of your work

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:38.320
they don't run the test on site they just paper you with shit so you seem really pissed off right

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:43.520
and um what do you do most of the time because i don't think you're a guy that's just sitting down

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.680
in his basement you know rattling away his anger at the at the keyboard what are you doing when

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:56.240
you're this is so interesting to me that somebody of your caliber thinks in this way because this is

02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:03.840
you are defying orthodoxy here well that that when i got involved in building the sequencers

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.200
first place we want to deploy them are people with cancer so you can see who is a tumor that's

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:14.400
uniquely drugable based in this mutation profile right and when we got involved in that we realized

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.840
oh we can't really do it because the fda they want to get involved in all this and they want to slow

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.040
it down there's people with terminal illness and you're saying you can't read their their tumor

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:26.240
genome to probably select a better drug that kind of ticked me off so i started looking at drugs

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:29.600
that are outside of their purview and that's where cannabis came into my life as i said all right

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:34.400
here are compounds that are showing a lot of promise in cannabis and right now the fda can't touch the

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.640
damn thing and i think there's enough voter support that will kick them out of those compounds for

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:48.080
the rest of their existence uh-huh uh-huh i see so he thinks that because the cannabis plant is a

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:55.840
natural thing um that he can he can get there because fda can't touch it that's interesting

02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:01.200
cool wow it's slated and purified and in the process they'll break them they

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.960
they said are outside of their purview and that's where cannabis came into my life as i said all

02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.600
right here are compounds that are showing a lot of promise in cannabis and right now the fda can't

02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:13.520
touch the damn thing and i think there's enough voter support that will kick them out of those

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.840
compounds for the rest of their existence they're going to try and regulate a couple of the ones

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:22.560
that are isolated and purified and in the process they'll break them they they ever already done

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.400
this they they put one cannabinoid through um many years ago for the glaucoma no one uses it they

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.480
because they broke it and then they put another set of cannabinoids through for epilepsy um this

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:36.640
is a very interesting study out of gw there's some of the best genetics and and best cannabinoid

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.440
scientists in the world and they broke their drug too their drug is how does this government

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:47.280
break a drug well they they make you isolate it so that's a single compound right and and that's not

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.560
how that's not how plant medicine works plants make a make a portfolio of compounds fda doesn't like

02:12:52.560 --> 02:13:01.440
that they want one uh but you know cannabis makes cbd thc cbg it's uh no i would note that it's

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:08.400
interesting that today Brett Weinstein tweeted about plant medicines and did a little segment on

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:15.200
his live show whatever that thing is called where he babbles for two hours he also talked about plant

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:20.560
medicines and why plants have so many medicines because of the challenges in a rainforest or some

02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:27.840
some you know evolutionarily insightful way of explaining it i guess um i i find it very

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:31.840
interesting because i do think that one of the things that mark and i have been keying on for a

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.640
while is this idea that cannabis could be used as personalized medicine or part of a hey pharmacopea

02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.360
that would be you know personalized based on the genetics of the plant and you're just gonna you're

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:47.920
gonna hear him talk about that for the next 10 minutes here whole portfolio of cannabinoids

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.080
and it's when you deliver a full entourage of these things that you actually see the most potent

02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:57.760
effects on patients so they made them isolate cbd out of all of that repertoire and then they

02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.080
told them to add a strawberry flavoring which was a pesticide and then they made them put in

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.560
sucralose which was a sweetener which sucralose you don't play with artificial sweeteners with

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.600
epilepsy a lot of the epilepsies out there are glucose transporter based epilepsy right they're

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:14.960
not getting enough sugar into the central nervous system and so they end up getting seizures and

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:18.640
so when you start putting in artificial sweeteners and these things you mess with hope you can see

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:23.520
my notes i'm saying that he's arguing pretty well right now for the the you know use of plant

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.000
extracts and the studies of them and i'm arguing that maybe this is his permitted truth

02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:34.720
so he just spent a half an hour laying out the state narrative on gain of function research

02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:39.200
and it's not likely to be a lab but it could be i mean if it's spreading faster than we thought

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:45.280
he put all the ifs and the what's in the buts and the and the hows there about how antibodies work

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.360
and how antibodies indicate and how maybe they thought it was worst case scenario but it's not

02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.920
and so now they're they're breaking the economy for nothing and blah blah blah that whole shit

02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:00.160
that we've been arguing about for four years was very succinctly laid and repeated by him in the

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:04.480
first half hour and now he's going to pivot briefly to something that's mostly truthful

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.720
and this is how the enchantment works that whole metabolism so yeah but their drug works it got

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.600
through FDA trial but a lot of patients report that if they take a plant extract they get much

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.400
better results we don't know why because the plant extracts aren't characterized as well but

02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.800
they're cheaper they're 30 times cheaper than getting something that's come through the FDA

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.280
so they have a tendency to be reductionists and try to narrow things down to a single compound

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.560
in a single target and real bio chemistry doesn't work that way it's usually a portfolio of compounds

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:41.520
against dozens of receptors except for when it's a virus then you can make a single antibody

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.480
against a single epitope and it's fine right Kevin and that's where you tend to get really

02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.880
really dramatic effects with cheap plant-based medicine so I got interested in cannabis because

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:56.080
I saw it as a way a run-around on the FDA because there's enough voter support to keep a portion of

02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:02.720
that pipeline so not as you're going to run around the FDA but he's also going to sort of

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.920
corner the market on genomic sequencing of the pathogens of cannabis it's pretty impressive

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.600
nutraceutical and access to the people and perhaps more you know it'll be generally recognized as

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.120
safe I think in the next 10 years and I think nothing speaks louder to this than this actual

02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:27.280
shutdown I wonder if Alex Berenson would agree with it generally being sick four years ago cannabis

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.680
was federally illegal now it is an essential business they cannot turn this off because if

02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:38.480
they do the hospitals be overwhelmed and they know this this is why they did not kill dispensaries

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.280
in most of the states the dispensaries are all open the hospitals will be overrun because

02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:50.880
because cannabis works as an actual if the weed runs out medicare and medicaid will flood the

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:57.520
hospitals he's actually saying it will medicine oh yeah there's papers in jama in other or in other

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:03.200
peer-reviewed journals showing that the states that adopt cannabis regulations and have medical

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.720
cannabis access have reduced medicare spend by like 24 percent bingo there's there's a lot of

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:17.920
patients you bingo bingo buzzing this and that's a huge relief valve for for the hospital system

02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:23.440
if you were to shut that down you would see a lion's share of like cancer patients probably

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:30.160
there's some success in Alzheimer's that is some bold shit talk right here and it would really

02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:36.880
really represent a huge turnaround right I mean somehow I have a feeling this is

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:42.000
incredibly incredibly disingenuous there's epilepsy patients there is a lot of success in

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.720
chronic pain in the opiate crisis all of those patients would be shut off and have to go into

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:51.920
the hospitals to get different meds my fourth inner did he just say something about the opioid crisis

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.680
does he actually know that that exists wait I thought I heard him say that oh for for the hospital

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:04.000
system if you were to shut that down you would see a lion's share of like cancer patients probably

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.960
there's some success in Alzheimer's there's epilepsy patients there is a lot of success in

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:13.680
chronic pain in the opiate crisis all of those patients would be shut off and have to go into

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:19.280
the hospitals to get different meds my fourth interview the fourth interview I did or maybe fifth of

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:24.480
this podcast when I switched it to coronavirus was with a guy that was a manager at a dispensary

02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.920
and I know him he's at my jujitsu gym so I just thought it was kind of funny

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:36.800
did he just say my jujitsu gym it's starting to make me puke as much as I think wrestling is cool

02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.720
anybody that does jujitsu now is just like come on kitty are you kidding me

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.000
like okay that's great but you know there are lots of martial arts to choose did you really

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:57.840
choose jujitsu like I'm sorry am I being a dork yeah when he would talk to me about like

02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:02.320
patients or getting them their medicine like I thought that was tongue in cheek because I used

02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.360
to live in Mendocino California where the medicine was like I just want to be stoned out of my mind

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:13.520
all day and so when people I have not actually taken it as a legitimate medicine until you're

02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:20.000
talking about it just right now oh yeah it is hands down probably one of the most legitimate

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.080
medicines out there and you won't hear that from the media who likes to echo chamber the

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:28.080
pharmacist so again this says in the notes you probably can't read it because this is a weird

02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:33.760
way of writing wcs but the worst case scenario story of a lab leak has already been carefully

02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:39.520
seeded in the first 40 minutes of this so now we're talking about stuff that so far seems

02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:44.880
good but something very big is coming up in a second typical narrative right a lot of the

02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:50.320
advertisement revenue into a conventional media right now is like boner medicine and and you know

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:54.320
the seales and all the stuff you see on the nfl right they have a larger revenue stream coming

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:59.040
from pharma they they heavily have a heavy hand in crafting all of the news cycles that come out

02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:03.120
about drugs and how they should be reviewed and how we need all these double blind disabled control

02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:08.560
trials and and they beat that drum of regulation regulation regulation uh cannabis this isn't

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:13.360
the first time was a medicine i mean this used to be the second most prescribed drug back in 1937

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:20.400
before they made it illegal all right it's been in the pharma capia for here comes his permitted

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:25.680
truth this is going to be something that he's allowed to say because that means that oh my gosh

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:30.640
what he said about the pandemic must be true so pay attention because what he says here is real

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:36.800
but it's only allowed to be said because they know that we're about to circle back to

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:41.760
uh public health for many years many more years than it has been illegal

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:47.920
only recently the last 80 years have been playing this experiment of ripping out phyto cannabinoids

02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:53.680
that target the most prevalent GPCRs in our body they were banned for 80 years all right um

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:57.520
it's a good argument out there that a lot of the chronic diseases we're seeing now are

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.520
diseases that are in imbalance in the end of cannabinoid system because we've removed it from

02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:07.520
our diet for 80 years chronic diseases are a result of removing cannabinoids from our diet for 80

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:13.200
years ladies and gentlemen hear it and hear it well chronic diseases don't come from the vaccine

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:18.880
schedule they come from the fact that we cut hemp out of our diet 80 years ago ladies and gentlemen

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:29.920
hear it because this is a liar working against the possible enlightenment that would occur if

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:36.960
everybody realized that vaccines are a lie and that the entire western civilization as we know

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:44.240
it is based on the idea that public health is real and so there's gonna be a there it's gonna be

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:51.120
very very difficult to thread the needle where we make gentle the light of this world as we break

02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:56.080
this mythology that these people and their fathers before them have been enslaving us under

02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:04.080
but make no mistake about it there is a way to thread that needle so that as we shed this mythology

02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:09.040
we will make gentle the life of this world the life of this world we will make gentle the life

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:18.080
of our free children but it will be by identifying these liars for who they are and demoralizing them

02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:24.080
to the point where they are no longer able to perform the job that they perform because nobody

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:32.320
believes them because their appearance already undermines the message and it should any time

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:39.280
these people appear on camera it should be something that immediately gets gets ratioed we're not

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:45.440
there yet but i believe we can get there in a few short weeks but it used to be ubiquitous

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:51.760
and it's the most common receptor in the human body is the camera target for for many years many

02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:56.720
more years than it has been illegal only recently the last 80 years have been playing this experiment

02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:03.360
of ripping out phytocannabinoids that target the most prevalent GPCRs in our body they were banned

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:08.240
for 80 years all right um so good argument out there that a lot of the chronic diseases we're

02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:12.880
seeing now are diseases that are in imbalance in the end of cannabinoid systems so it has nothing

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:17.600
to do with pesticides nothing to do with toxins nothing to do with chemicals nothing to do with

02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:22.880
pollution nothing to do with vaccines nothing to do with pharmaceuticals it's only got to do with

02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:30.960
the fact that we stopped eating hemp because we've removed it from our diet for 80 years but it used

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:36.640
to be ubiquitous and it's the most common receptor in the human body is the cannabinoid one receptor

02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:40.800
so you can't just shut that thing off and not expect there to be dire consequences

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:46.400
um so yeah if you go through the medication you're proposing that we the human beings used to all

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:52.640
use a lot more weed i don't understand oh hemp so hemp was in our diet and hemp has has residual

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:57.520
amounts of CBD and other another cannabinoids you are freaking kidding me i have thought people

02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:02.240
that were supporting hemp were the biggest like it's an illusion of consensus right you're supposed

02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:07.520
to feel the same mind blowing effect that this guy is supposed to be experiencing

02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:12.480
you're not supposed to be asking the question of like wait what

02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:18.000
so there's no toxins there's no pesticides there's no poisons the processed food is fine

02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:30.960
wahoo's ever no one has legitimately ever told me no no no hemp is hemp is one of the best food sources

02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:38.240
yeah it's amino acid profile if you look at it's omega-3s omega-6s this is a fantastic food source

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.240
like as i as i try to be vegetarian once in a while i try to get as much happening as i can

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:47.760
because the only way i can get a complete amino acid profile so it's a great food source and it was

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.320
ubiquitous in our in our in our food source in the past and it was also the most that was commonly

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:57.200
second most commonly prescribed drug back then um there there's uh i can point you to a bunch of

02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:00.960
this literature uh in the past but as shaughnessy as a person to look up he was one of the first

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:06.800
physicians that pulled this out of india into uh into the uk in into ireland and that's where a

02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.120
lot of the westernized version of this cannabinoid medicine started and it was a long time ago like

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:19.520
1800s but yeah so this was a case of regulatory capture in in 1937 um uh who was it herst i think

02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:24.240
was involved in this and uh herst had an interest in nylon and hemp fiber was going to knock out

02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:28.160
nylon so we found a way to ban it under banning marijuana as a xenophobe

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:33.120
xenophobic slur against certain parts honestly mark i don't know if he's just lying it's it's

02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.520
extraordinary i don't know it's the population i think african-americans and mexicans are using

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:42.320
a lot of marijuana back then i got it showed up at that actual um congressional we're going to

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:51.200
use my dictionary for the first time okay uh we should look it up on your seeds so i went crazy

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.880
the other day and uh my friend regular guy says i should not use these books without gloves

02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:04.400
that's how badass he thinks they are so i got this this four book set off of ebay last week

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:13.520
i just decided to spend more money than i have um and what i got was a four volume set of the

02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:23.440
fosters encyclopedic medical dictionary from 1892 and i swear to you i'm just doing this live i

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.240
did not realize i didn't think of doing this until right now so let's look in the medical

02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:36.000
dictionary under cannabis and see what we find just curious i don't know what it'll be it might

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.920
not be anything it might just say the most prescribed drug in america i don't know

02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:47.040
it's i'm not very good with with um i'm not very good with guide words i was terrible at it and

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:54.880
and it really isn't that weird cannabis there are guide words i'm still having trouble here

02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:03.920
cannabis has two ends right there it is oh wow it's a long whoa it's very long

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.440
okay i'll show you what it looks like i don't know if this camera will show it or not

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.880
look at this badass book i'm going to show you another page in this badass book too

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:25.360
so cannabis cannabis cannabis is down here i got to be careful i'm sure that regular

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:29.360
guy's already pissed because i don't have gloves on um maybe i have to raise the camera a little

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:39.600
bit so genus of annual you're you you ticacious herb of the tribe distinguished by the opposite

02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:46.560
our alternative vegetative leaves and axillary deciduous flowers the calyx male flowers being

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:53.520
simo's panicles and consisting of blah blah blah blah indica indica so what does it say it's

02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.600
medicine is this gonna say medicine yet don't see it saying medicine yet oh careful oh shit

02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:06.800
sorry i just ripped a page god dang it so jeff was right i don't even know if this book has been

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:15.840
opened i can't believe i just ripped a page it makes me sad um shit super annoying so i guess

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:23.200
regular guy was right um i should be be more careful with this book uh common herb

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:32.480
become naturalized to grow spontaneously fruiting tops impure resin scraped by the top of the plant

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:37.520
herbs of the indian plant particular hebrity odor european american varieties contain less

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:44.880
resinous content uh herb of indian amp is extensively used in the east as intoxicant

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:54.160
plant is medicineally as an anti-spasmodic uh anti-puritic which i don't know what that means

02:28:54.160 --> 02:29:01.840
because i'm not a doctor animal jesic is is uh pain relief um so it does say that it's used

02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:05.200
it doesn't say that it's the most prescribed drug in america or something like that but

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.400
hemp oils um

02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:17.680
i mean okay it could be it doesn't disagree with him there um i just want to show you what this is

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:26.320
check this out so it's even got color plates in the book um various forms of epithelium which is

02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:32.160
of course the the immune system um and it is from

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:40.640
um from 1892 now it's really badass because we're going to use these books more often because

02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:48.240
they have an entry on smallpox which does not contain the words death deadly or dying or or

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:55.280
anything they have an entry on vaccines which is exclusively about variation um and there are

02:29:55.280 --> 02:30:01.040
countless other things inside of these four tombs that we are going to go through over the next um

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:08.240
i guess years because it is just an unbelievable um set of books so i have four of these things

02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:14.320
and they're they're massive um and i just ripped the first page today alive and i'm probably gonna

02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:18.880
i'm probably going to be upset about it for the rest of the day i know it doesn't look like i'm

02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:23.920
upset but i have a real problem with with things that are perfect and these books were perfect when

02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:29.040
i got them i don't think anybody ever opened them and now that i've ripped a page underneath my

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:35.840
god dang camera i'm a little upset but it's okay because some reason or another i was lucky

02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.240
enough to get that book set and i just every time i open it i'm laughing and every time i open it

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:45.760
there's little pieces of leather that are falling off the sides of it and so i don't know what to do

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:51.840
i got to figure out how to take care of that thing um uh but uh yeah it's it's really exciting so

02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:57.280
what were we doing here what we oh that was cannabis and medicine okay um i'm not going to use any

02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:02.720
repairing on that that was a really small tear and i may never open that page again just to be

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:08.080
sure i don't tear it again i don't know man i'm still hurting from so hearing to point out that

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:12.800
it was the second most prescribed drug in the pharmacopoeia and he was ignored uh so they banned

02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:18.080
it by banning marijuana when all the physicians knew it as cannabis but they didn't recognize their

02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:23.040
drug was getting banned in the process because they used the slang word in the legislation um

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:28.800
that's how it all went down 80 years later yes i agree mark he is suggesting that it was a staple

02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:34.080
in the diet it wasn't used as medicine the reason why we have chronic diseases because we stopped

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:38.720
eating and i totally agree with that that's separate from its its use as a ubiquitous medicine

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:43.440
we're still trying to fight to get this reversed um and when people say let's get more regulation

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:48.160
evolve and like get the FDA involved all we see is that repeating itself on nonsteroids i'm not

02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:53.840
sure i'm not high right now i i my life is being smashed against the rocks

02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:03.120
his mind is his mind is being smashed against the rocks and what he's really means of course is

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:09.360
the totality of the information that he's heard especially the beginning the narrative of a natural

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:16.640
virus most likely here is is really to encourage people look into these medicines because they

02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:21.600
you don't find compounds that have safety profiles like this in the pharmaceutical engines okay these

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:26.640
things are what attracted me to them in cancer is that i love the fact that we could sequence

02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:32.160
tumors and stratify people's tumors for more probable drugs but the drugs that we had to select

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:36.320
from were like cisplatin these are toxins right they most of the cancer drugs are

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:40.080
threading this needle between killing the patient and killing the tumor they don't have very good

02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:44.320
therapeutic indexes the ratio of the effective dose the lethal dose is really narrow in these

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:49.520
things in cannabis that number is like a thousand you need a thousand times the amount of the drug

02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:55.840
to kill you versus the effective dose so you you can miss and not harm anybody that that's the

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:01.360
Hippocratic oh first do no harm and if that's your mission aim for drugs that have low toxicity

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:07.760
phytocannabinoids very low toxicity huge library from the plant and they all do different things

02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:12.960
and uh and that can have an enormous impact on personalized medicine uh and you can grow them

02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:19.200
out of the ground without insanity of pharmaceutical regulatory capture that's driving

02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:21.840
really bizarre medical pricing in our in our health care system

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:29.840
this is uh unbelievable do you uh do you see downsides to cannabis use i mean do you

02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:34.800
it seems like if people were smoking weed all day they'd be little the downsides can be a

02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:39.520
hyper connectivity where you think everything's connected and you have a hard time juggling

02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:44.080
complex problems and so then you start to think somebody like kevin mccaren might be a bad guy

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:50.880
but lazy and kind of forgetful um so that depends on the person and depends on the cannabinoids

02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:57.280
um i you know if you're into personalized medicine there's no such thing as one size fits all

02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:02.960
right so there are cases of cannabinoid hyper who's and he is into personalized medicine don't get

02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:08.160
don't don't misunderstand it just in one okay so this is a very rare condition that some people

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.320
get sensitized um they believe it might be related to trip receptor genetics but that's

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:16.880
something that's not been proven yeah that's just a hunch uh these people get into a vomiting cycle

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:21.120
and uh it's almost like an allergy and they can't have any cannabis anymore after that point

02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.520
i think that happened to Brett Weinstein actually i think i heard him say that once on his podcast

02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:30.720
which is funny um they need hot showers i mean to fix it it's very rare um there are there's

02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:35.120
i wonder if that's an indication that he already knows Brett Weinstein and i'm not even joking

02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:38.640
continuous connection to schizophrenia i'm not really convinced by any of that data there's a

02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:43.360
lot of schizophrenics that use it and it's kind of a chicken and egg thing like are they using it to

02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:47.360
to deal with the symptoms or are they causing the symptoms no one's really sorted that out

02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:52.480
all we know is that cannabis uses skyrocketed in schizophrenia has not so um it's unlikely to be

02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:56.880
a cause and effect there from a another one of those things right where where this is maybe a

02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.480
partial truth he's allowed to say and he's opposing Alex Berenson of course so it's an interesting

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.960
setup already in April 24th 2020 because Alex Berenson's about to be censored right

02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.960
the usage standpoint um in terms of couch like i can tell you i can tell you that uh so i when

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:19.280
i lived in northern california i took up smoke and weed i had never really smoked it before

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:27.520
and it was like all the sudden ubiquitous and uh i had to quit because um i heard i heard voices

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:33.840
and uh and and it was it was really weird for me and i was like hey this is not good i'm having

02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:40.560
conversations with myself i have since tried it as an adult you know 10 years later and i don't

02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:45.200
have any of that but it was like one of those things that i was like whoa this is actually

02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:52.720
uh interacting with my brain in a in a real way it is yeah so um THC has a tendency to be more um

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:58.400
to to have those symptoms okay so probably one in nine people will get anxiety or have some type

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:04.960
of uh psychotic event like that with high doses of THC one in nine high doses of THC is actually

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.640
a genetic bottleneck that occurred because of regulation we we put in a prohibition on this

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.800
and much like prohibition with alcohol alcohol people stop brewing beer and start making whiskey

02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:19.280
because it's all regulated based on the weight so if you get caught with a pound of weed you get

02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.600
x amount of jail time so people want to make sure that weed is 20 percent THC not five

02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.600
so they've bred all of the cannabis out there to be type one cannabis which is a cannabis plant

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:35.680
that makes only THC doesn't make any CBD this is a lie and i'm really upset about it and i'm

02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:39.760
it's a lie in my gut i don't know if it's a lie because i don't have the scientific data but i

02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:46.000
would be willing to bet quite a lot of money um that it's a lie i don't think there is a

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:52.560
a natural growing pot plant on earth that doesn't produce all of the cannabinoids in the spectrum

02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:58.560
at to a certain extent and there's certainly no weed there is no weed in the world that does

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:05.840
not produce CBD's alongside the THC there's not just one THC as far as i understand it that's not

02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:12.960
how biochemistry works kevin mccernan so he is telling you a story that suddenly became

02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:19.040
dumb simple oh there's some plants that are called schedule type one plants that fit the

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:26.960
fit the the class one regulation of a of a of a DEA drug and then there's type two plants that

02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:32.880
have more CBD in them and we don't have to treat those like heroin but we should definitely treat

02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:39.680
the type one plants like heroin this is gotta be bullshit i wish that there's a dude that that

02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.080
follows us that's actually working on cannabis genome so if there there is somebody

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:49.920
that occasionally is in the chat that could tell me for sure that i'm not crazy but this statement

02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:59.280
that regulation led led to the breeding of type one plants that are only THC is stop lying

02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:10.160
it's got to be a lie this is just bullshit it's absolute bullshit or to have those symptoms okay

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:14.800
so probably one in nine people will get anxiety or have some type of psychotic event like that

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:20.880
with with high doses of THC high doses of THC is actually a genetic bottleneck that

02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:26.160
occurred because of regulation we put in a prohibition on this and much like prohibition

02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:32.000
with alcohol alcohol people stop brewing beer and start making whiskey so when we got alcohol

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:38.400
pro prohibited then they started making moonshine and so when we prohibited weed

02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:46.000
they started making really high THC weed that's just bullshit when i was in high school there was

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:53.600
still weed coming from mexico over the border that was absolute dog shit what is he talking about

02:38:54.480 --> 02:39:01.120
this is a narrative which supports the idea of commercialized cannabis as progress in

02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:07.920
personalized medicine make no mistake about it he's off his his his safe permitted truth now and

02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.880
he's right back to the to the state sponsored limited spectrum of debate that's not biology

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.480
because it's all regulated based on the weight so if you get caught with a pound of weed you get

02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:24.800
x amount of jail time so people want to make sure that weed is 20 percent THC not five

02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:30.800
so they've bred all of the cannabis out there to be type one cannabis which is a cannabis plant

02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.720
that makes only THC doesn't make any CBD if you look out you know throughout the globe

02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:41.920
cannabis naturally is going to be a heterozygous state it's going to make both CBD and THC we just

02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:45.920
went through this regulatory bottleneck where we bred everything in the THC direction and that

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:52.880
came at the cost of it not making any CBD but natural cannabis has both CBD is known to have

02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:58.320
kind of a yin and yang effect with THC it's an anzeolytic it alleviates the anxiety that you

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:03.520
might get from THC the combination of the of the two is proven to be far more effective in a lot

02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:10.400
of therapies the CBD helps mitigate the negative effect like you experienced but the CBD also has

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:16.560
different pharmacological kinetics and different receptors so you really want plants that are

02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:20.320
diverse like this and one problem we've had in the cannabis industry this is what we do at

02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:23.680
medicinal genomics is we sequence people's cannabis plants figure out all the cannabinoid

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:28.640
genes they have and help them breed for particular pharmaceutical rebel to ours so how the hell did

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:34.400
they breed pure THC plants before they had the genomic information that this genius can provide

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:41.360
stop lying okay and to do that correctly you've got to really you got to understand which genes

02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.320
are driving all this and how those things work pharmacologically but what you ideally want are

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:50.240
plants that make a whole portfolio of these cannabinoids so that you don't end up with these

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.560
adverse events well I mean it's I'm glad you told me that I'm glad I brought it up because

02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:02.400
the guy that gave me that weed was an old sailor named Fred that had been growing weed to be the

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:07.440
strongest thing it could possibly be it never crossed my mind that perhaps the

02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:14.480
weed I was using was pretty supercharged yeah that's not a common and that's actually that's

02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:22.320
an artifact of prohibition you know I think when as prohibition is is relaxing right now

02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:26.400
you're seeing an increased demand for the more balanced cannabis what we call type two plants

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.760
plants that make both CBD and THC that those plants actually sell for a little bit more than

02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.160
what you get from just a real heater THC strain heater strain

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:44.400
the the CBD strains are starting to get some popularity as well that they make only CBD and

02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:49.520
very little THC those can legally be grown outdoors and so their price is decaying faster than all

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:54.720
of them because once you can grow the stuff outdoors the the price plummets the indoor growing

02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:59.920
is what really is what really drives the price up because you got to have lights electricity and

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:04.640
security cameras and you basically have to build a prison to grow the stuff that was right

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:10.640
I visited one and it is like a prison yeah so I wanted to change subjects I saw

02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:18.720
an interesting tweet that you had which was something to the effect of the precautionary

02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:24.960
principle should be known as the starvation doctrine I thought that this was particularly

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.720
interesting because I have for a long time studied and felt like the precautionary principle as

02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:38.160
described by people like Naseem Talib have been holding us back in an extraordinary way that is

02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:44.880
in and of itself dangerous and so I was wondering what you meant by that and maybe you know what

02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:50.240
why are you writing about that right now so I I had some exchanges with him on twitter because he

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:56.320
was really adamant about following this precautionary principle once the China thing came out and

02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:01.680
China quickly quarantined like the entire city of Wuhan which is larger than New York right

02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.800
and next thing you know there's like 400 million people in China that are quarantined and I kind

02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:12.560
of challenged among this being like you're worried about black swan events I get that I understand

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.080
this is an exponent I think you said that four times now black swan financial I deal with

02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:22.400
exponentials all day with doing QPCR I get that the outcomes can be really dramatic if you don't

02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:30.480
act early however I don't believe this is a black swan event because this to me looks like a flu

02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:35.600
or maybe two or three x a flu that we get every single year so that doesn't necessarily call for

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:42.880
making extreme changes and secondly if you do this if you don't take Bostiad into mind here

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.440
which is the scene in the unseen often spoken about like he can see that this may spread all

02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:53.280
over the globe what's unknown about is about any action you asked the federal government to take

02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:58.400
is what is going to be on the other side of the balance sheet right are you doing a precautionary

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:04.240
principle in Donald Trump all right like if he suddenly decides to shut down the world economy

02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.480
I saw an article yesterday from CNN I don't know how to validate CNN stuff anymore because I don't

02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:13.760
believe seen and very often but there there had a headline that was like 180 million will starve

02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:18.480
from the virus they didn't say from the shutdown they said from the virus but we all know it's

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:23.760
because of the shutdown right um they're already trying to pin the economic destruction on the

02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:30.000
virus not on our reaction what a wonderful limited spectrum of debate isn't it and can you see it

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:36.720
now I think we could argue about this for four more years don't you to the virus and so I think

02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:42.480
human reaction to panic is far more he's repeating himself abusive you're repeating

02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:47.680
yourself this virus that the scene was trying to point out so we had lots of precautionary principle

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:54.080
act now act fast but he should apply that same principle to when you centralize power like this

02:44:54.080 --> 02:45:00.320
in history you see 20 million dead you see eight million dead again he's hammering this this same

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:05.120
thing that Jordan Peterson said about you know what we we we're gonna get to totalitarianism

02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.600
we're killing a lot of people with the bad response but maybe if the bad response is done

02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:14.560
just right we can get rid of infectious disease forever and then totalitarianism with it there's

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:19.440
there's this is the litter throughout history of demicide of centralizing power when people give

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:25.040
up their liberties because they're afraid suddenly you get really dumb decisions happening and that's

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:29.600
a black swan event right there I think you created a black swan event pointing out something they

02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:33.840
created a black swan event but it was by accident kind of because it was they assumed the worst

02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:37.440
case scenario couldn't be that they created a black swan event because that's how they want

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:41.440
to govern your children for the rest of their lives it couldn't be that they created a black

02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:46.320
swan event and got people like him to lie about it so that they could enslave your grandchildren

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:52.240
it couldn't be that no way Kevin McCurnan's definitely on our team from his his million

02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:57.440
dollar mansion on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean screw you you traitor i think that was his average

02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:06.000
slow with china's reaction you have to say they are reacting based on a different set of criteria

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.520
than american politicians i mean they are still in the same criteria of we want to remain in power

02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:17.360
just like the politicians do here but they're the options that sit at their at their hands

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:23.120
you know they really can turn on or off aggression the on or off of authoritarianism

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:29.200
and there is a very good chance that they would not have necessarily predicted that this would

02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:34.800
have the reaction in the united states that it's having and the significant thing that i am watching

02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:43.600
is meat production in the u.s and the amount of pig plants in particular that are being taken

02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:51.520
offline and you know we're talking about you know 65 000 pigs in one factory and oh my god that's

02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:58.080
the best t-shirt i've ever not thought of myself freedom is measured in ohms is the winner

02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:07.120
of the chat holy shit that is amaze balls seven eight nine factories shutting down cattle factory

02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:13.760
shutting down if a third of those um if that production was going to china and that's now shut

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:18.960
down there's no way they were predicting that this was going to happen it could be that their reaction

02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:26.560
whatever it was um shockwaves into the system that are going to imperil oh my gosh i'm almost

02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:30.960
in tears i think it's such a beautiful thing to say that freedom is measured in ohms because

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:38.000
it's resistance it's it's awesome i mean i can't believe i didn't come up with it myself and in the

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:43.440
same sense i i feel like you now have to have some kind of you're gonna have to have a cut in that

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:49.760
it's so good wow i might even change my from from your consciousness's prime real estate to

02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:58.560
freedom is measured in ohms on my website well done wow these things are very very hard to predict

02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:04.640
and that's that's precisely why i i think that these precautionary principles you you need to be

02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:09.840
careful when you apply them uh that you're looking at the scene in the unseen the repercussions of

02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:13.760
action can sometimes be more deadly than than what you just sometimes you have to just let it

02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:19.440
happen sometimes no action is is the better move then you must act now because everyone's looking

02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:24.080
for you to act um and and i think we're seeing that in some other countries i know sweden is

02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:27.120
a lot of people critiquing what's going on in sweden i'm kind of i don't think that story is

02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:31.600
played fully out yet but i think we need to watch it but you know sweden had no lockdown and yeah

02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:36.000
there's some more deaths there but in the end they will probably still have an economy they won't have

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.520
suicides they won't have spousal abuse they won't have all of these others

02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:46.880
repercussions um and it's it's a little bit frightening because uh we took a model from

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:53.440
neil ferguson a model that never went through peer review the code stills in public uh and

02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:58.400
implemented this saying two million people might die uh that's not peer review you know that this

02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.000
came out of imperial college of london which has funding directly from the gates foundation

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:07.600
uh and now people are criticizing all the papers that are coming out and bio archive is being

02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:12.960
that's not peer reviewed uh you know like whether you talk about dd or realts work out in france i

02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:17.280
mean he's he's guys trying to treat thousands of patients is putting papers out as quickly with

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:22.320
hydroxychloroquine that got censored in the united states that peter navarro tried to stock pile

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:28.080
blah blah blah here it comes this is the big run around again here we go into the early treatment

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:34.320
suppression of early treatment story bingo because he can and people are critiquing his p values

02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:39.520
and stuff in the paper while he's got patients dying on him and he's rapidly publishing but yet

02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:45.040
they're not applying that same scrutiny to the model makers i'm gonna say this i had a guy named

02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:53.520
yosha bakon very early in the podcast who actually hit he had models that before the imperial college

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:58.880
models came out and there seemed to be quite in line with their predictions on what would happen

02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:04.240
so it wasn't i and i only bring that up because i didn't have any scope of whether or not this

02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:10.640
was serious or not and uh so no mention of kunut with koski which at this time from rockefeller

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.720
university in new york city was speaking out against the shutdown and speaking out against

02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:20.800
the idea that even if there is a risk additive novel spreading pathogen the kids are the ones

02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.440
that are going to save us they're not vulnerable to this and there's that argument actually

02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:32.000
interestingly enough the argument of it being a an old person's virus hasn't even really been

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:38.320
made here they're not there yet you see where we are in the timeline it's pretty amazing i don't

02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:44.640
know like that was two places that said the same thing and yes bio archive is facebook it is the

02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:51.120
the chan zuckerberg initiative which is all about all about the transhuman movement yeah

02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:56.000
yeah that's it's good to see there's at least some some um concordance like that that's

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.320
always good to see because then you know you know the conspiratorial tone gets no neutralized

02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:04.240
not this knife that are coming up the same answer but i think it's been pretty clear

02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:09.840
as we look at the data today those models were way off and they were never adequately pure

02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:16.080
this knife was never put public and that instilled a mass lockdown that's the knife you want on

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:20.640
multiple different jurisdictions see what that says none of those fears came to play and they're

02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:24.560
off by a large so knives are out and it's not because of social distancing some of their models the

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:28.720
knives are definitely out social distancing and they were still in order of magnitude off

02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:34.560
and they keep revising them down and i think most of the the modeling is there's a couple reasons

02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:38.160
for being off but one of them is that they assumed the population that we were going to hit

02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:42.400
had never seen this before there's just no genetic evidence that that would be true

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:46.640
we have a virus where we've collected thousands of mutations as it spread throughout the population

02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:51.040
you have to assume there's other ones of those that exist beyond Wuhan in back into time

02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:55.200
that were also slightly mutated before the before we detected the one in Wuhan

02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:59.120
and those ones have probably been circulating we don't know exactly when the zoonotic have been

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:04.240
happened but these are cold viruses we've been we've been exchanging these things for for

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:10.080
these are cold viruses so he seems to be he seemed now we're off my notes so now he seems to be

02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:15.760
really claiming that these are just background cruel viruses

02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:22.960
this pen is actually going to piss me off so much that i'm going to have to stop with it these are

02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:29.600
these are pens that i got on amazon because i thought i would try a a fountain pen off of

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:36.320
amazon and they look really nice they're made of nice materials but their nib writes like absolute

02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:47.120
dog doo doo um black background uh background cold viruses see i haven't been using this pen

02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:54.160
in in about two weeks and it starts writing black dark green in one stroke um so these are

02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:58.480
background coronaviruses it's a background signal i'm just going to go back a little bit so i can

02:52:58.480 --> 02:53:02.560
hear for sure what he said population that we were going to hit had never seen this before there's

02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:07.520
just no genetic evidence that that would be true uh we have a virus where we've collected thousands

02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:11.440
of mutations as it spread throughout the population you have to assume there's other ones of those that

02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:16.960
exist beyond Wuhan in back into time that were also slightly mutated before the before we detected

02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:21.520
the one in Wuhan and those ones have probably been circulating we don't know exactly now keep in

02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:27.440
mind Alina Chan does not did not find thousands of mutations and if anybody's going to call me out

02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:35.360
on this um what what happens here is that i'm writing and taking notes in real time and so my

02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:40.160
writing gets better um but when i start to try and start for the first time the first page always

02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:45.680
looks like crap so i apologize if you can't read my writing um i'm i'm writing and talking i'm not

02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:49.440
as good at it because it would not have been happened but these are cold viruses we've been

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:56.160
we've been exchanging these things for forever in human history so to believe that this thing came

02:53:56.160 --> 02:54:01.840
out in the index case and the phylogenetic tree needs to be rooted in December is is just

02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:06.640
insane from my perspective there there is there's there's likely convergent evolution going on

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:11.040
there's likely other things that are going to throw off that is being the first case we ever

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:17.520
detected and if that's true then the population has seen this before the models are all wrong um

02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:23.200
and and we should not be taken so we've seen it before the models are all wrong but the existence

02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:28.000
of a novel spreading pathogen a risk additive spreading pathogen is not being questioned

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:34.400
usefully here make clear about that they're not actually usefully questioning whether a pandemic

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:39.360
is occurring he's saying there is but they're just not being precise about it or they expected

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.920
the signal to be more about more robust or they thought more people would die but here we are

02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:49.840
taking people's liberties on someone's theory that's insane right if you're going to rip out

02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.320
everyone's constitutional rights shut down the economy which by the way i think hyper

02:54:55.200 --> 02:55:00.000
um stimulating the economy is the right answer not choking it and if you're going to do the opposite

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:03.440
of what you should do hyper stimulating the economy you mean like warp speed

02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:09.360
which is stimulate the economy in this case and take everyone's constitutional rights

02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:14.400
you know you need to have more than a theory and so when we come out of this that's the first

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:19.200
thing i think we need to focus on as a civilization is never let this happen again because

02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:24.720
one person came up with models that no one could review and that politicians took it and ran with

02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:32.400
it but isn't the opposite danger isn't the opposite danger that it's like a hurricane

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:38.160
that didn't come and then people are like next time i'm not evacuating and then a hurricane comes in

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:45.120
you and yeah but being the drum on second wave and no one's going to listen i'm not going to listen

02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:48.720
they start saying second wave i'll look at the data but i'd be really surprised if the second

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:52.880
wave takes off at the rate the antibodies are building up so there there is a danger that if

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.320
you cry wolf too many times the populace is just going to say scream you i'm not taking another

02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:02.720
three months off are you stay at home right now oh no i we have a lab so i still go to the lab every

02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:07.520
day except for you know friday sometimes i do stuff like this but uh we're working quantitative

02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:13.360
PCR tests we're actually right now looking at detecting covid on uh on different samples we

02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:17.680
actually have some concerns that it could actually get into the cannabis supply chain as an inhaled

02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:33.600
product that's a risk for us so

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:38.000
you

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:51.920
you heard him say it right he started to try and detect covid because it could become a contaminant

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:59.200
in the supply chain who knows about contaminated supply chains anybody even by the name of Andrew

02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:05.280
huff ever work on contaminated supply chains what in the hell is going on here is it possible

02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:08.720
that these people are all randomly pulling the same stuff out of their

02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:15.920
we're trying to figure out if we can detect this on the cannabis supply chain

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:22.000
couple reasons for that i think why would it be on the cannabis supply chain what is he talking

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:27.520
about if you look at the discovery of coronavirus it's almost all of it comes out of bacuano and

02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:31.440
bacuano is used as an agricultural fertilizer and a lot bat guano

02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:42.240
nice that is fantastic i never thought i'd write the words bat guano today that's

02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:47.600
the basis so that's a risk yeah you know you don't want to be feeding your plants that you're about

02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:53.280
to inhale bacuano that should end but the other thing that's coming up is that there are patients

02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:59.280
or people that are working in a lot of wow here today guano tomorrow yeah seriously like if you

02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:05.440
if you put the contaminated bat guano onto your you could actually get SARS-CoV-2 or even a worse

02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:13.120
virus from feeding your cannabis contaminated bat guano holy shh literally holy shit these

02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:17.520
grows that are coming down with covid and they're handling and trimming the plants are they this

02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:22.000
is ending up on flower we don't know probably not but we should certainly have a screen in place

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:28.560
the third issue is that the comorbidities in covid or have some overlap with with cannabinoid

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:34.560
users COPD a lot of people are using cannabis oils for COPD they're not smoking flour so maybe

02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:41.120
not a big risk there a lot of diabetes patients there's a lot of smoking flour is now a risk double

02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:45.760
blind placebo control trial and THCV which is a different cannabinoid that seems to be working

02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:51.200
for diabetes cancer a lot of patients are using this in cancer so if we have a lot of patients that

02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:57.280
are using cannabinoid ways and they're the same class as the comorbidities in covid

02:58:57.280 --> 02:59:01.840
we have to make sure the cannabis supply chain has no covid in them oh my gosh

02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:11.120
I mean this is crazy he is actually safe so earlier in the talk he said that if the cannabis

02:59:11.120 --> 02:59:16.480
supply was stopped at the hospitals would be overflowed do not forget that right hospitals

02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:21.120
will be overrun if they cut the cannabis supply off now he's telling us

02:59:23.120 --> 02:59:29.520
that we have to be worried about the contamination of the the supply chain because bat guano is

02:59:29.520 --> 02:59:34.960
used and if oh my goodness all of these people that are being successfully treated with cannabinoids

02:59:34.960 --> 02:59:41.280
and being kept out of the hospitals by cannabinoids are actually infected with covid that's in the

02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:49.920
supply chain we could have a black swan bat guano event

02:59:52.960 --> 02:59:58.400
with cannabinoid users COPD a lot of people are using cannabis oils for COPD they're not smoking

02:59:58.400 --> 03:00:03.760
flour so maybe not a big risk there a lot of diabetes patients there's a lot there's a double

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:08.400
blind placebo control trial and THCV which is a different cannabinoid that seems to be working

03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:13.760
for diabetes cancer a lot of patients are using this in cancer so if we had a lot of patients

03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:18.000
that well we can replace it with ivermectin now so what are we worried about good using

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:24.000
cannabinoid brains and they're the same class as the comorbidism in covid we have to make sure the

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:30.240
cannabis supply chain has no covid in them so we're building qpcr tests that can monitor that in

03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:34.720
in the cannabis supply chain i don't know if they're going to get used it's just our understanding that

03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:39.600
if this were to ever break out in the cannabis supply and we needed a product we'll be ready

03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:43.840
chain our status of being essential business will evaporate overnight and we'll have a held

03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:49.200
time getting it back up and so our our thinking is we got to be preemptive here build the assays

03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:53.520
maybe they never get used but it's the right thing to do so we're spending some time in our lab

03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:59.520
doing that it seems to me like that's the way that all companies should have to be which is to

03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:04.480
think about what the contingencies are that could knock you down because if you don't plan

03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:09.680
for them you get burned out of the market and nobody lets you come back in you know by bailing

03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:16.880
you know it's why the airline industry like i i rely on the airline industry it is what my work

03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:23.280
is basically done by but if we just bring them back because they were always there we missed

03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:28.880
the chance that we've already had a brush fire let the forest fire burn all those things out of

03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:33.760
there and see what grows next and it's not going to be as good at first and it's not going to be as

03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:40.160
coordinated but let new things grow instead of propping up the old system and letting the

03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:46.240
dinosaurs continue moving on yeah yeah i hope that's what happens but as what we're seeing is

03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:51.680
they're probably going to inject you know government stimulus or or you know checks into these uh

03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:55.040
you know Boeing or some of these rotting companies that haven't necessarily planned

03:01:55.040 --> 03:02:01.840
accordingly so so Boeing is a rotting company already in 2020 he knows it already it's interesting

03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.160
right for airlines they're going away he knows it already um we'll see you know that that's that's

03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:09.840
one challenge we're having with all these trillions of dollars that are getting printed is they're

03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:13.840
not going to get rained from helicopters they're going to get injected into a cantilian effect

03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:18.800
into the economy where people close to government get access to the cash and that has a further

03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:23.920
widening of the rich and the poor um you know we're seeing this with harvard having to give back i'm

03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.400
sure he's really concerned about the widening gap between the rich and the poor money with

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:33.680
shake shot getting money all these ppp loans they're finding their way into in wage you said that we

03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:40.480
have to hyper stimulate the economy now the ppp loan or ppp loans are lame wow what a weirdo

03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:49.680
the hands of people that have uh that have good relationships with their banks bigger companies

03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:56.240
are in the front of the line over the smart companies it's uh and and when it happens when

03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:02.160
something gets rolled out this fast mistakes get made and then sacrificial lambs are brought up

03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:08.400
to to take them out but you'll never you'll never make it just in right you know when you move

03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:15.680
something this fast yeah yeah it's uh i don't know i i just i just sense that this is the time to

03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:21.920
decentralize not to centralize you know we've got uh we've got to treat every jurisdiction

03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:26.400
differently and enable those jurisdictions to open and close as they see fit as opposed to

03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:31.040
having uh you know everyone close down at once i mean part of the problem when everyone closes

03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:34.880
down at once like new york had an issue i get that they probably need to do what they need to do

03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:39.120
but then the hospitals in kentucky are sitting there starving waiting for covid patients to

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.520
show up and not doing any electives and they're furloughing employees because so he doesn't see

03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:48.240
that as no evidence of spread he sees that as you know the containment of the virus as they all

03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:54.240
did one size fits all planning here they should have actually probably stayed open and dealt with

03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.680
their cancer patients and their heart patients to get them healthy before covid showed up and

03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:02.320
they could have figured out when covid showed up by by testing and and and reacting to their micro

03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:08.240
environment it's just all nonsense he's trying to explain away the murder in hospitals he's trying

03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:14.240
to explain away the protocols that led to murder on purpose that we're now lying about actively

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:18.800
already in april of 2020 to make sure that people don't realize that they're just murdering people

03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:25.440
and lying about it and it's been his job to make sure that people who don't come to that conclusion

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:30.400
since the very very beginning if you can't see it i can't help you go find another stream to watch

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:35.520
appropriately as opposed to just following the quomo lead right the quomo lead i think that's

03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:39.920
the answer to to this viral propagation is is you need to decentralize the way it is

03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:45.280
as opposed to centralizing and having one guy with the bullhorn try and run the whole economy

03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:48.960
that's gonna kill it that's what that's what that's what you get bread lines for

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:55.520
he's predicting bread lines he's predicting controlled demolition of america and he doesn't

03:04:55.520 --> 03:05:00.320
have any if he can't i don't know why they're doing it yeah and you know you you'll know somebody is

03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:07.280
you know somebody is smiling about it centralizing the problem when uh or the answer to the problem

03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:11.120
is when they start standing up on the podium and saying it's your comorbidities that are going

03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:16.240
to kill you so if you're fat you need to start exercising and eating right like you don't you

03:05:16.240 --> 03:05:21.680
don't get to like sit this one out or get a super special pill when the politicians start saying

03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:27.520
you everyone is going to get baptized and this one happens to be a very bad disease and so some

03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:32.560
of the people that have comorbidities are going to get taken down by this take that seriously start

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:38.560
now should have started two weeks ago absolutely yeah and because running around the block for

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:44.160
two weeks we'll get somebody in shape enough so they can stand this novel virus boy as you know

03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:50.960
you might not have the antibodies but you could build the fitness this is just in it's almost too

03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:56.160
much i think there's a much more sort no it's not too much because you know i started there

03:05:57.040 --> 03:06:01.440
i started by making this argument that they are seeding right now and so it's important to point

03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:06.240
that out i i started by arguing that kids weren't in danger i started by arguing that

03:06:06.800 --> 03:06:11.680
that university students are in danger the only people that are really in danger are old people

03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:15.600
and they're exaggerating this and that's kind of what's happening here right

03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:21.680
be very careful don't get sucked into the debate about whether the virus justifies it whether

03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:28.960
the outcomes or the results justify what we did that is the most ridiculous line of reasoning

03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:36.160
and the most ridiculous hamster wheel to get into in 2024 and murdered people and they lied about

03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:42.240
death and they lied about murder in order to convince the globe to take transformation and

03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:47.600
transfection as investigational vaccines and since he's been involved in transfection and

03:06:47.600 --> 03:06:53.360
transformation since he dropped out of college i think it's very easy to conclude from this video

03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:58.320
that he has been playing for their team since the very beginning in this national security

03:06:58.320 --> 03:07:03.360
operation that was unleashed upon us and declared a pandemic a critical approach we could have

03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:08.400
yours i'm not suggesting everyone go out to a fish concert tomorrow and swap you know swap

03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:13.680
microbes i'm suggesting people who know they're sick they're the people most vested in their

03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:16.880
outcome they're going to probably make the best decision for themselves and stay home

03:07:16.880 --> 03:07:20.560
and those of us who are healthy will probably go to work and try and move the economy along so

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:25.120
that those people have a better shot yeah don't miss that air and don't miss that ridiculousness

03:07:25.120 --> 03:07:33.840
that this is the guy on the on the left is a guy who uh who worked for Monsanto we better drugs for

03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:38.880
them when when they do get sick but this concept of everybody's stay home doesn't make any sense

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:43.040
at all and this concept of the government deciding who's essential not essential

03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:49.920
doesn't make a lot of sense i mean if are you familiar with um as Leonard Reed's work on

03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:55.760
eye pencil oh yeah of course of course yeah yeah so economies are very complex if you try to take

03:07:55.760 --> 03:08:00.960
eye pencil and decide who's essential in making the part parts of the pencil and who isn't it's

03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:06.560
kind of hard to to to rip out the guy who makes a chainsaw from the guy who makes the graphite

03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:10.320
from the eraser from the people who are feeding them right we know this because because we got

03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:14.320
essential status here in Massachusetts because we we're involved in testing the safety of all

03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:18.560
the cannabis and cannabis is an essential business uh but all of our vendors are

03:08:18.560 --> 03:08:25.600
essential and we have a hundred vendors they have a hundred vendors right this is like in two hops

03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:31.200
you're six degrees away from Kevin Bacon right uh just and when you look at supply chain inventory

03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:35.840
you go out to all of your suppliers they're not all essential they have a hundred suppliers each

03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:41.040
they're not all essential so suddenly the whole chain is broken because there's holes everywhere

03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:45.280
and while we might be essential everyone feeding us isn't and we have to go on lobby for those people

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:50.880
to now become essential so we can continue our business this is all wasted energy uh if you let

03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:56.480
the people decide all right i'm at risk i'm going to stay home um you're not at risk maybe you should

03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:00.640
go go to work the people who are actually most vested in whether or not they're taking the

03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:05.520
appropriate amount of risk are the individuals who know most about their surrounding circumstances

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:09.040
i've got grandma at home i probably shouldn't be doing this i've got three kids that need to go

03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:14.160
to school so this is a stupid complicated argument right it's an absolutely stupid complicated

03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:18.800
argument for these dumb people are lying to us and we should stop letting them lie to us

03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:24.960
these people are lying to us about emergencies and then acting on that power and we should stop

03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:30.080
letting them lie to us this is like a really stupid complicated explanation for what's going on

03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:34.400
that doesn't actually get us to ask useful questions or state useful objections to it

03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:40.160
but you do some different you know my significant other is a nurse and this changes our dynamics

03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:44.560
based on our tight household we shouldn't be mixing young kids with grandparents and stay at

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:50.560
home orders okay young kids and grandparents mixed up is not a good idea we the stay home

03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:55.840
stay at home orders should be for particular people so this is again um focused

03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:58.400
lockdowns

03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:03.680
and local lockdowns

03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:14.000
so again he's not he's not he's not saying anything that the cdc wouldn't say yeah cool that's fine

03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:18.240
you know shelter in place isn't good for immune system you got to get outside so that's really

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.400
bad to conflate with his concept of social distancing which is keep your distance from

03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:26.640
people who maybe get outside you know there's a lot of these things that are very nuanced that

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:30.560
you're never going to get out of a regulator who pays no price for being wrong when they

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:35.520
write these regulations to sweep across the entire country um that's a disaster that's

03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:40.720
that's where the virus is going to shine that's the real that's the real black swan

03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:48.240
what are you confident that your ideas will uh will see the light of day or have you been

03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:54.160
listening to what's going on with facebook and youtube describing that advice that goes against

03:10:54.160 --> 03:11:00.800
the WHO or the government's perspective won't won't be allowed i'm waiting for i've got two

03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:05.360
youtube videos on this on my site and i suspect they'll get pulled in a week or two so go if your

03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:09.200
audience want to go see them they talk we talk about the genetics of the disease and why we

03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:14.080
believe there are ancestors that are yet to be detected oh so he did two youtube videos about

03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:18.880
the virus i wonder if they got censored so that people would take him seriously do you think they

03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:24.880
did i wonder i don't care the fact that has on let's ask the apol bias and sequencing uh we've

03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:29.360
also done some homework on a few of these movies that have come out suggested apol says most likely

03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:34.800
enough evidence to call that car most likely you can't read it but it says most likely hypotheses

03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:39.040
like that need extreme evidence and then we just don't have extreme evidence um on that front so

03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:44.160
look at those before they get to be detected and the impact that has on uh on survivor bias

03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:48.240
and sequencing uh we've also done some homework on a few of these movies that have come out

03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:53.040
suggesting it's a bible and we've not seen enough evidence to to call that card and we do think

03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:59.280
extreme um hypotheses like that need extreme evidence also an extreme hypothesis that it came

03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:05.360
from a lab needs extreme evidence so roll the clip on the fear and cleavage sites and the age

03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:09.600
aids inserts and holy cow there's mimicry you can all these different human proteins and oh my

03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:16.880
goodness staphylcocken and teratoxin bee homologies you see it it's like he's putting the tea putting

03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:22.640
the balls on the tee and then other people are going to come up with the driver and there they

03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:29.520
go and there they go and all these other pieces of the of the narrative are going to be kicked off

03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:34.240
by all these different stages of the lollipalooza of liars and it doesn't matter which one you choose

03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:42.000
because they're all queued up intellectually limited spectrums of debate by already planted

03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:49.200
pre-chosen narrative curators and then we just don't have extreme evidence um we don't have extreme

03:12:49.200 --> 03:12:54.880
evidence yet but it's coming but the extreme evidence is coming brit wine steams gonna find it

03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:59.280
and and and the fear and cleavage site and those you know they're all gonna find it it's coming don't

03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:06.400
worry don't worry extreme um hypotheses like that meet extreme evidence and we just don't

03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:11.840
have extreme evidence um on that front so look at those before they disappear but yeah that's

03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:16.880
really 1984ish i mean how are we different from communist china if we're gonna have youtube

03:13:16.880 --> 03:13:20.240
decide that everything needs to be the who and the who by the way is the one who told you not to

03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:26.160
wear a mask i mean that that's the same that's why i'm like no bueno so i used to work at the world

03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:33.760
bank and my experience working at the world bank was he used to work for Monsanto and the world bank

03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:45.440
i mean what so tell me again why don't you say there because that sounded like complete

03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:52.160
bullshit so to call that card and we do think extreme um hypotheses like that meet extreme

03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:56.480
evidence and we just don't have extreme evidence um on that front so look at those before they

03:13:56.480 --> 03:14:02.880
disappear but yeah that's really 1984ish i mean how are we different from communist china if we're

03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:06.480
gonna have youtube decide that everything needs to be the who and the who by the way is the one

03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:11.360
who told you not to wear a mask i mean that that's the same that's why i'm the who is telling you

03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:15.520
not to wear a mask that's insane and we already talked about earlier how the only reason why we

03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:20.960
don't have enough masks in the united states because the fda got in the way are you feeling it i think

03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:25.600
i got the hamster wheel in my head now i think i can kind of make it run whenever i want to now

03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:31.120
i just have to stop the video and remind you what he said ten minutes earlier like no bueno so i

03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:36.880
used to work at the world bank and my experience working at the world bank was everything that's

03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:43.200
horrible about a bureaucracy being amplified with billions of dollars and all the royalty that comes

03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:47.920
with being in an international organization i really did not enjoy working at the world bank

03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:52.320
yeah i can only him he didn't enjoy working at the world

03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:02.400
how many of you have filled out a job application for the world imagine that the world health

03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:06.640
organ i was so disappointed i signed up for a job i thought i was going to be able to change

03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:12.960
the world and it turns out it's just a bunch of sheisterization is somewhat like that now i said

03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:19.360
that last time and i had a lot of scientists and people come at me saying oh the WHO is super

03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:24.160
important you know da da da but those are the same people that told me not to wear a mask and i

03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:31.200
didn't i i went to the airport i flew from one country to another and back and i didn't wear a

03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:39.360
mask because they told me i didn't have to so what the hell yeah there is a um there is a bias in

03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:45.440
academia okay and it's it you and i was involved in on the human genome project i had government

03:15:45.440 --> 03:15:50.400
funding and i was in that camp for a very long time thinking that we needed government to fund

03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:56.000
market failure in the case of the human genome project was a very interesting um i'd say test

03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:00.480
case for this because everyone was saying that government needed to put three billion dollars

03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:04.720
into the human genome project because no one else would then solera shows up saying we've got

03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:08.240
new sequencers and we can do this for a hundred million dollars and what we've done next year

03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:13.280
government doubles down decides to put war mining into the human genome project even though there's

03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:18.160
an example of a market participant who's going to solve the problem and they did this on the basis

03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:21.760
that all the the private guys are greedy they're probably going to patent patent the shit out of

03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:25.760
the genome so we have to do it to keep it public right well the NIH ended up with more patents

03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:30.800
than solera on the human genome and the end of the day so it was a pretty you know blunt lesson

03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:35.920
where i lost kind of my love that this NIH system is all for the good of the common man

03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:40.560
why would you lose your love for it you got to pull all of your IP out of the system that

03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:47.200
funded your development of it and make it into your own wealth what the hell is he talking about

03:16:48.400 --> 03:16:53.440
what does he have to bitch about i don't get this at all this is not making any sense to me

03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:59.920
he worked for the human genome project his wealth is based on the extraction of the IP produced in

03:16:59.920 --> 03:17:05.520
the human genome project given back to him despite the fact that it was completely funded by taxpayer

03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:17.760
money you traitor you slimy mealy mouth traitor all the problem and they did this on the basis that

03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:21.200
all the the the private guys are greedy they're probably going to patent patent the shit out of

03:17:21.200 --> 03:17:25.280
the genome so we have to do it to keep it public right well the NIH ended up with more patents than

03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:30.160
solera on the human genome and the end of the day so it was a pretty you know blunt lesson

03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:35.360
where i lost kind of my love that this NIH system is all for the good of the common man and

03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:40.160
we're a body on and don't have any greed like solera has when they ended up with more patents

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:49.120
and so there's a bias in academia for centralized hierarchy in medicine out of doubt and then who

03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:53.840
is like their emblem right however you got to be very cautious with people that are on that boat

03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:59.280
because they're they aren't market forces involved in their research right there you get

03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:04.800
when you when you write a government grant right a lot of people say you need the government

03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:09.120
to write these grants because no industry is going to fund this ant this ant farm research and it's

03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:13.440
really early stuff and it has to be done by the government because the the private sector won't

03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:17.520
fund it i've written government grants we've pulled in over 32 million in government grants

03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:21.280
over my career and i'll tell you there isn't a single grant we wrote that didn't cost us at

03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:28.400
least a million dollars to file so the so grants cost a million dollars to file stop lying

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:35.040
i mean that you might charge people a million dollars to consult on a grant you might pay yourself

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:40.080
a million dollars in that year while you waste time writing that grant you might spend a million

03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:44.400
dollars traveling around the world to talk to different people in your business to write that

03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:50.800
grant but there's no frickin way it takes a million dollars to write a grant it's a 14 page document

03:18:50.800 --> 03:19:01.840
in english what is he talking about here this is just we are absolutely knee deep in this now

03:19:03.200 --> 03:19:08.480
this this medler needs stopping this medler needs outing this guy should not be able to walk

03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.280
on the street in public without being recognized as an anti-american trader

03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:20.080
in my humble opinion that's how i i don't see him any other way there's no way to listen to this

03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:27.200
and think that he wasn't queued up that this isn't part of a tabletop narrative that they're trying to

03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:34.160
you know curate kind of sector is funding this stuff they're just enjoying the fact that they're

03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:38.320
getting freebies from the government uh in the process of getting non dilutive capital into

03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:42.960
their company by betting a million bucks for some of the preliminary data that goes into the filing

03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:46.240
so that you better believe the private sector does have an interest in these things and this

03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:50.480
concept of market failures are complete fraud all right this is just a way for people who know

03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:54.800
how to grease the system to basically write grants to get money into their private company that's

03:19:54.800 --> 03:20:01.840
non-deluded so i wonder if that's like robert melone's specialty you know writing grants that

03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:08.800
that get funded and not diluted i think robert melone brags about being such a consultant i think he

03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:14.160
brags about having procured over two billion dollars in funds in his career

03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:19.280
and those two were in front of the senate last month

03:20:20.960 --> 03:20:25.840
telling stories about bad shots and double-stranded DNA contamination

03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:33.760
not about a background signal that was distorted as a spreading ricks affidavit

03:20:34.240 --> 03:20:38.640
pathogen not at all even though that's more or less what he talks about here without actually

03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:44.320
saying it because he is seeding a national security narrative that he will be in charge of curating

03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:48.720
but the private sector is there and they're the ones who actually put the first money up because

03:20:48.720 --> 03:20:53.600
they did 20 billion was it really and that's even yeah great for the preliminary experiments

03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:58.080
so the people that are in that system they're always getting government paychecks and there is

03:20:58.080 --> 03:21:04.000
no cost to them for they don't have a competitor that is necessarily competing with them per se

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:08.640
for that money they don't have a market review you might get 12 six to 12 people in your study

03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:13.040
section and almost all of those people in your study section for a grant are on the boards of

03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:17.200
various private companies throughout the biotech industry but when you're in the marketplace you

03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:21.200
don't have six people bottleneck and make a decision on whether the research should be done you have

03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:25.440
the entire marketplace telling you you're wrong or you're right right so trying to get something

03:21:25.520 --> 03:21:29.120
done to the free market you actually have more scrutiny in the free market than you will get

03:21:29.680 --> 03:21:34.240
from peer review at the study section and the people in the study section the same damn people

03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:38.160
that are on the boards of these other of the robber Malone is in the study section there's

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:41.760
companies so they're just a sub-selection of the marketplace you're basically taking a

03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:47.760
statistical sub-sampling of brains applying it to the review process and then handing out

03:21:47.760 --> 03:21:52.960
government money in the free market you have all of them critiquing your work so there isn't really

03:21:53.280 --> 03:21:57.760
this perceived notion that the market's not going to do this we need of the government do

03:21:57.760 --> 03:22:03.760
it instead that's all fantasy that's not that's not really how things work government grants are

03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:08.800
lame the government can't do anything but this guy is rich because the government paid him to

03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:13.680
work on the human genome project when there was a commercial competitor that could have done it

03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:21.280
anyway and so the investment of the government in his work that resulted in the multi-generational

03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:30.640
wealth that now comforts his fat ass didn't really work the government shouldn't do that stuff

03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:35.920
even though my entire existence is based on the government doing that stuff and then letting me

03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:44.480
take the IP out of that project and sell it on my own trade tour trade tour trade tour

03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:51.360
okay so I think you'll find with a lot of the folks that have academic funding they believe

03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:56.000
the government needs to be in charge in cases like this they don't see that the free market

03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:01.600
actually delivers results a lot faster and they're very they tend to have a oh they're greed-based

03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:06.000
and we're public servant based except for the public servant side of it takes their money

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:10.800
through taxation which no one can actually refute right the greed's really coming from the government

03:23:11.680 --> 03:23:16.080
uh you can't if you don't like stem cell research for ethical reasons doesn't matter we're taking

03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:21.120
your money in any way in doing it same thing's true with gain of function mutations on viruses

03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:24.560
they were funding that for a while with our tax dollars which who knows maybe you played a role

03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:29.520
in one of these viruses emerging right it's very dangerous research okay gain of function

03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:33.600
research is very dangerous and the government doesn't care if other people can do it they're

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:38.800
go happy to spend their money on it anyway what a crazy little narrative he's playing here

03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:44.000
that government that spent billions of dollars on the human genome project despite there being a

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:49.040
commercial alternative available and he just happened to benefit from that spending but that's

03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:55.600
okay generally speaking when the government does that it's just stupid never mind my family's comfort

03:23:55.600 --> 03:24:01.360
multi-generational comfort of my brothers and my dad but when the government does this stuff it

03:24:01.360 --> 03:24:05.360
should be the private industry and all these people in academia don't understand that the

03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:10.320
private industry does it so much better because i'm a private person i'm private but i only work

03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:15.440
for small companies and small companies are screwed by the fda because small companies can't compete

03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:20.400
with the place good companies like monsanto in the 13 years of regulation is there any more

03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:25.520
contradiction in this sandwich that you could smash in without putting coast law and french fries on

03:24:25.520 --> 03:24:30.640
the bun but you can't vote or opt out of it in the private sector you can you can say i'm not

03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:35.440
funding that because i i think that's just shady stuff i'm gonna put my money in the start of

03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:41.440
somewhere else all right so there aren't the same economic incentives on government funded

03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:45.920
research there aren't those those those review mechanisms and there aren't those market forces

03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:50.560
that help balance it so i i'm not surprised you ran into people from stones at you if you could

03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:54.880
cheat the who because the who's just another one of these hierarchical systems that's trying to

03:24:54.960 --> 03:25:01.120
tell the rest of the world what to do how have your academic friends embraced you since you've

03:25:01.120 --> 03:25:05.840
taken this position they tend to point to the weed stuff i'm doing to discredit me

03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:14.480
so huh that's how kevin mccaren tries to discredit me isn't that funny yeah it's not popular i

03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:18.640
saw a popular opinion but you know it's just been informed through experience i've been on the

03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:22.240
government side of things and then i've gone into the entrepreneur side of things you've been on

03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:29.920
the government side of things where you got your gold handed to you because unlike normal when

03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:34.640
you work for the government you're not allowed to you know government funds a a project through

03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:39.440
mit and the whitehead institute that intellectual property isn't yours unless the system lets you

03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:44.560
have it unless there might be some reason why we might need you in the future again unless you're

03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:51.600
part of an ongoing national security apparatus since you're cutting your teeth working for the

03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:59.200
department of energy stop lying you get you get a very wholesome picture that way you you

03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:03.520
see how things operate on one side of the fence and then you see how they were they operate in

03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:07.920
the free market side of things and you say that means have a perfect market you know it's regulated

03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:13.440
to hell but uh it's it's certainly regulated to hell is he repeating himself enough for you yet

03:26:13.440 --> 03:26:18.320
for you to catch on to the main ideas hey i believe it is what's responsible for maybe some of the

03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:21.440
numbers you've seen at the world bank when you look at the world bank they've done a good job

03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:24.720
measuring how many people are coming out of poverty right there's been more people coming well at least

03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:29.680
you're talking to a guy who used to work for the world bank so maybe we can get an exchange of ideas

03:26:29.680 --> 03:26:40.000
going here at a poverty like in the last 50 years and all of human existence that doesn't happen

03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:44.640
with with orange man in charge that happens because the economy is growing there's more

03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:49.120
interactions between people because we're more connected so there's more win-win relationships

03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:54.080
that are being discovered throughout the world being hyper networked as a result we have GDP

03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:58.480
that's growing even though population's growing that that that can't happen in their model of

03:26:58.480 --> 03:27:04.480
it being a fixed pie right like i'm rich my my wealth came at the cost of someone being poor

03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:08.960
that can't be true if your wealth came at the cost of taxpayer investment you

03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:19.760
you you fraud you're a fake person you're a fake man you and your cats more people are coming

03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:25.280
out of poverty than ever before concurrent with population growth that means the pie is getting

03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:29.440
bigger why is the pie getting bigger it's getting bigger because we're more networked and we're

03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:34.080
finding more win-win relationships by being more networked all right it's it's it's free market

03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:38.960
economics that are driving this not structured hierarchical economics so

03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:47.200
the overton window is wide open right now pika and and for for left ideas like hey we need more

03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:52.320
government support we need more money to come in here for right ideas of hey we've got to let

03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:59.680
things burn and see what comes out new um what do you think people should be doing right now

03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:06.880
to ensure that they are seeing the right kind of ideas in our society or or promote the right

03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:13.200
kind of ideas uh i think you should watch gig oem biological as often as you can share it with

03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:17.440
your family and friends and if you can go to gig oem biological and support our work thank you very

03:28:17.440 --> 03:28:25.280
much in some effective way i think they should be looking at what they themselves can do to change

03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:30.720
their micro environment and they should not be holding their breath waiting for the centralized

03:28:30.720 --> 03:28:35.760
decision makers to come save them because they're not coming what we've seen from government action

03:28:35.760 --> 03:28:41.600
on this is is nothing but destruction we've got the ccc screwing things up then the fda screws

03:28:41.600 --> 03:28:46.640
it up further then they have clear regulation and certificate of need laws all of here they go he

03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:52.320
went right down his list did you hear it did you hear it did you hear it let's go back and see if

03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:57.920
we can do it in the in the in the notes as as he just did it change their micro environment

03:28:57.920 --> 03:29:02.800
and they should not be holding their breath waiting for the centralized decision makers to

03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:07.520
come save them because they're not coming uh what we've seen from government action on this

03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:13.040
is is nothing but destruction we've got the ccc screwing things up then the fda screws it up

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:18.800
further then they have clear regulations then they have clear regulations which was on the third

03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:25.040
page right where is the clear regulations so he said the fda and then yeah here it is

03:29:26.480 --> 03:29:31.760
so he said the cdc could only test so they screwed it up then the fda you had to get a EUA

03:29:31.760 --> 03:29:36.240
then you had to have clear certifications right so he's he is actually repeating

03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:43.200
he's actually repeating and hitting the same points with the same words again this is neural

03:29:43.200 --> 03:29:50.160
linguistic programming or if you just want to call it a a symphony of lying um harmonized lying

03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:57.760
preconceived uh mythology spinning i don't know what this is but it's definitely not

03:29:57.760 --> 03:30:03.600
a disambiguation wizard working full time what's can do to change their micro environment

03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:08.400
and they should not be holding their breath waiting for the centralized decision makers to

03:30:08.480 --> 03:30:13.520
come save them because they're not coming uh what we've seen from government action on this is

03:30:13.520 --> 03:30:19.120
is nothing but destruction we've got the cdc screwing things up then the fda screws it up further

03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:23.120
then they have clear regulations certificate of need laws all of these things are just

03:30:23.120 --> 03:30:28.160
impeding people's freedom making it really difficult for people to do their job certificate of need

03:30:28.160 --> 03:30:36.080
laws is is said again and remember a certificate of need laws was something that he responded to

03:30:36.080 --> 03:30:43.040
with regard to new york city because certificate of need laws meant that there weren't enough

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:48.400
beds in new york city and the reason why was certificate of need laws understand how much

03:30:48.400 --> 03:30:55.040
gigantic i mean that is really a a a planetary sized level lie right there

03:30:56.720 --> 03:31:02.080
and in light of jessica hockett's work in light of jessica hockett's continued sort of

03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:06.720
floundering in terms of trying to get attention to the new york city fraud

03:31:08.080 --> 03:31:13.920
instead we have people like pia kori on video in 2020 saying dumb stuff about new york city

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:22.240
and here we have april 24th 2020 we have kevin mccurnan from the human genome project saying dumb

03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:29.760
stuff about new york stop lying they're just liars ladies and gentlemen this symphony of liars is

03:31:29.840 --> 03:31:35.440
going to be exposed if it's the last thing i do with my life likewise i won't rest i'm never

03:31:35.440 --> 03:31:43.840
gonna stop i'm never gonna stop kevin it's not gonna go away because you are a liar and telling

03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:52.640
the truth it's not slander playing your own words and pointing out how ridiculous they are isn't

03:31:52.640 --> 03:32:03.520
slander and there's no way a guy who's renting his house in pittsburgh with 3,100 followers on twitch

03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:11.600
can possibly cramp the style of somebody that's so economically connected to the biosecurity state

03:32:11.600 --> 03:32:21.200
that his dad works for them until he died i'm not afraid of you kevin i'm not afraid of any of

03:32:21.360 --> 03:32:27.280
you people anymore i've got nothing to lose you can't take away anything that i have

03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:38.320
this is never gonna stop i don't know if people have figured this out but they're when they print

03:32:38.320 --> 03:32:43.360
the money they're diluting yours so they're they're paying you to stay in your house with

03:32:43.360 --> 03:32:47.520
your own money and you're not even getting a large portion of it all right the six trillion

03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:51.600
dollars if you average that across like you know three hundred and twenty million people

03:32:52.480 --> 03:32:55.440
it's something and you only get twelve hundred dollars of it well let's you should you should be

03:32:55.440 --> 03:32:59.680
getting eighteen thousand of it and you're not you know this this is a game where they are

03:32:59.680 --> 03:33:05.120
basically robbing the coffers of of the treasury right now because they can get away with it everyone's

03:33:05.120 --> 03:33:10.960
panicking so they're not your solution the solution rests within you and you need to go and find

03:33:10.960 --> 03:33:16.480
where you're where you can deploy yourself in this new market stop saying deploy stop calling

03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:22.400
in a market what is he saying is that how we're going to save families from the vaccine schedule

03:33:22.400 --> 03:33:27.200
is that how we're going to save people from the lockdown what the shit is he saying here

03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:33.120
with it everyone's panicking so they're not your solution the solution rests within you

03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:38.800
and you need to go and find where you're where you can deploy yourself in this new market

03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:44.400
and i would stop following the rules because they're not following them i would i would go i would

03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:48.240
resort to agarism here i would resort to basically free market economics and if you

03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:52.480
think it's a black market don't worry about it because frankly everything's illegal right now

03:33:52.480 --> 03:33:57.840
and none of it justifiably is and so only you can really get yourself out of this and i wouldn't hold

03:33:57.840 --> 03:34:02.160
your breath for um you know sacred regulation to come down and turn the economy on in three months

03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:07.200
and give you a check it ain't coming how bad do you think bread lines and things will get

03:34:08.160 --> 03:34:15.040
uh you know i i have a hard time predicting politicians i mean i can i've been watching

03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:20.240
the spread of the virus very closely and i don't think it's as dire as what they're doing so

03:34:20.240 --> 03:34:25.520
why are they doing it right there there's lots of smart people that can see this that

03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:30.000
this isn't going to be much more dramatic than the flu we've never acted this way for any other

03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:37.120
flu before so what's the motive and then if you look before the virus came um the economy

03:34:37.200 --> 03:34:40.880
wasn't necessarily in great shape then either this is really just a pin that pricked the bubble

03:34:40.880 --> 03:34:45.680
right we had inverted yield curves we've been printing money so the economy was already

03:34:45.680 --> 03:34:52.640
shit and now the the covid did it for a very long time everyone was expecting there to be an

03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:57.040
economic disruption of some sort no one just so they wouldn't coordinate a national security

03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:00.880
operation to try and convince everybody that there was a coronavirus which was really just a

03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:06.480
background being distorted as that so that they could you know reduce medicare costs

03:35:06.480 --> 03:35:15.280
so that they could i mean this is just pathetic it's pathetic the trigger was going to be

03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:22.640
so are they are they trying to extend this is yeah inverted inverted yield curves we are willing

03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:28.320
to accept any new order that comes next right i mean i don't know it doesn't make sense to me

03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:32.320
that that what kind of new world order i mean like this kind of new world order

03:35:33.040 --> 03:35:37.120
is that new order is that the new order he's talking about why is he choosing these stupid

03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:41.520
words unless he's playing games with our kids you know cut off their nose despite their face here

03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:47.520
you know that the economy's certainly been been shaken up quite a bit but um and that doesn't

03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:52.000
express to you man they must have thought this was bad because when the people that have money

03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:58.560
give up money for example if if uh all of the money that's going to go away from march madness

03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:04.000
is going to go away like those guys they didn't they did that because something scared them i think

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:09.440
you know what's kind of interesting about that is a lot of those companies did that before the

03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:14.640
government stepped in still going right like they voluntarily decided that they looked at the data

03:36:14.640 --> 03:36:19.280
saying this could be really messy we don't know what's coming the models look scary oh that's hot

03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:22.880
but i think it was a government order that shut down a lot of a lot of the lot of the companies

03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:28.240
voluntarily chose to like let's push this off let's cancel this conference south by southwest

03:36:28.240 --> 03:36:33.840
right um and that's that should be a reminder to people that people are doing that because

03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:40.000
they have self-interest in mind uh they don't want to be the super spreader event and that could

03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:53.680
that could get the liability and don't want to be a super spreader event whoops

03:36:53.680 --> 03:37:01.600
so he doesn't want these companies don't want to be super spreader events that's why they shut

03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:07.920
down so we're using that same language that of course Robert Malone and uh Kevin McCarron will

03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:14.320
use to describe their acquisition of covid early on in the pandemic because they were at super spreader

03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:23.600
events either at the biogen event or somewhere in Korea just like mary holland says this

03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:29.840
that she had something very strange and maryll nasa she's had covid three times and and harvey

03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:34.720
rice says that despite taking hydroxychloric when he still got sick and it was two weeks of hell

03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:36.320
reinfected

03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:43.040
you don't hear mark and i talking about when we had covid

03:37:44.720 --> 03:37:48.400
insisting that well so strange it was so different it was so weird

03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:58.800
stop lying super spreader events and that could be a disaster for the reputation so

03:37:58.800 --> 03:38:02.480
the market in many ways is reacting before the government is and the government's just stepping

03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:07.440
in front of the parade taking credit um that's an important thing i think to remember that so

03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:12.480
they wouldn't step in front of a fake parade they wouldn't create a fake thing and then step in front

03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:17.600
of it and save us that would be crazy that markets are under underlying this they are doing some

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:20.800
things correctly in spite of this and they're all doing it on their own timelines and that

03:38:20.800 --> 03:38:25.760
might be the more optimal approach than having one person step in and do it all but in terms of the

03:38:26.720 --> 03:38:33.040
you know the the government has um an echo chamber of advice right the people advising

03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:38.080
the government on this let's take i i know i know i know fauci i know france Collins i've

03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:41.120
worked with both of them all right they're good people people want to villainize them but they're

03:38:41.280 --> 03:38:49.760
in in their good people fauci and collins are good people according to kevin mccernan

03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:57.040
who has been licking their boots for his entire career taking government money and saying that

03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:03.920
government sucks the fda sucks he's never once mentioned that the prep act makes the fda almost

03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:08.320
irrelevant he's instead said that the euas are like ten pages of work to do

03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:17.520
this is just hilarious to me if this video isn't watched by a million people in a month because of

03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:24.080
how ridiculous he looks in it then you will know it's because he is part of this operation

03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:31.600
this should just be a a barn burner around the world because anybody that thinks that this guy

03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:36.160
is a good guy can't listen to this and think that he's a good guy afterward unless they're just

03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:45.120
willing to discount the actual words that this traitor has said in the 24th of April 2020

03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:50.480
environment where um they're not their paychecks are going to stop they haven't i mean fauci's had

03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:54.720
a paycheck for 40 years from the government right so he's never personally at risk for making these

03:39:54.720 --> 03:40:00.480
calls he's very likely to gain a tremendous amount of funding after this and his funding is likely

03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:06.640
to be larger the longer this hell the more pain we feel the more we're going to enhance the NIH

03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:14.480
budget right his patent estate primarily vaccine based intellectual property all right is that

03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:21.760
the only voice that should be advising the president right now he's no skin in the game he's going to

03:40:21.760 --> 03:40:25.280
get a bigger budget when this is all over and the budget's going to be larger the more pain we

03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:31.920
experience his vaccine patent estate is not on coronaviruses but it's he's he's mostly got

03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:38.480
intellectual property surrounding vaccines we're hearing an narrative everyone holds your breath

03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:43.440
into the vaccines are here that's crazy it's interesting they're holding their breath until

03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:47.840
the vaccines that's crazy but who's got the patents for the vaccines he's not going to mention the

03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:52.880
patent man though is he i think i know this guy named robert malone who actually invented all of

03:40:52.880 --> 03:41:00.560
these things and actually has the patent on all genetic vaccines that comes later vaccines

03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:04.800
the coronavirus vaccines we've had in the past have backfired they make they make they make things

03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:10.240
worse right they they've tried these in other organisms uh and uh there was an effect where

03:41:10.240 --> 03:41:15.440
when you got the vaccine when you eventually were given the actual virus your immune system went

03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:20.480
on fire and you got a cytokine storm and the vaccines actually had a worse outcome for the

03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:25.520
animals so they went on fire and you got a cytokine storm no i think they called it antibody

03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:30.000
dependent enhancement at least that's what peter hotez called it when he was speaking in front of

03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:39.440
congress and so here this is another choice that was made by his handlers or the people that coached

03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:44.560
him at the table before he went on this podcast that we want to make sure that we exclusively talk

03:41:44.640 --> 03:41:51.200
about antibodies as good and so when we talk about coronavirus vaccines failing let's not mention that

03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:56.720
we characterize that as antibody dependent enhancement let's mention that as cytokine storm because

03:41:56.720 --> 03:42:01.200
that's something that we want people to be thinking about with respect to the virus and the people

03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:07.440
in the hospital and if you can't see that that's exactly why he chose those words on the 24th of

03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:13.840
april 2020 you need to work hard than just getting the disease itself that that's the that's the

03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:19.200
they make things worse right they they've tried these in other organisms uh and uh there was an

03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:24.720
effect where when you got the vaccine when you eventually were given the actual but here did not

03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:30.320
reveal antibody dependent enhancement until the end of 2020 and he only did it after somebody

03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:35.840
and drastic by the name of louis ji warren sent me a paper about marrick's disease and encouraged

03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:42.640
me to think about it and so i also at the same time has carat funded bosh actually started pumping

03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:49.360
the idea that these vaccines these transfections that i wasn't good enough to insist on them being

03:42:49.360 --> 03:42:55.600
called that already with everybody but these transfections could make the virus change and could cause

03:42:55.600 --> 03:43:01.200
antibody dependent enhancement into people that get the vaccine so i was right there with carat

03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:06.880
monday bus and i thought here at monday bus was the man when i when i first heard about it and so

03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:13.600
it's really i can be very humiliated when i look back and realize how hook line and sinker i took

03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:19.680
all of these narratives and i ran with them as hard as i could into the sunset virus your immune

03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:25.120
system went on fire and you got a cytokine storm and the vaccines actually had a worse outcome for the

03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:30.400
animals than just getting the disease itself that that's the that's the history of coronavirus

03:43:30.400 --> 03:43:34.960
vaccines it's really ugly and so to suggest that we're going to race one of those things out and

03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:39.120
by the way and sure you're familiar the vaccine industry is one of the dirtiest industries in the

03:43:39.120 --> 03:43:43.360
bit and they they build liability right so you're going to mandate this you're going to have to have

03:43:43.360 --> 03:43:48.560
a chip to go across borders and there's no liability for the people making these things a chip to grow

03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:54.160
across borders and there's no liability so holy man he's dropping a lot of ideas there if you're

03:43:54.160 --> 03:43:59.440
going to mandate these and get a chip to cross borders and these people don't have liability i

03:43:59.440 --> 03:44:07.600
wonder if them not having liability before the pandemic was a problem stop lying i wonder if the

03:44:07.600 --> 03:44:12.720
lack of liability before the pandemic would have led to any malfeasance in the vaccine schedule in

03:44:12.720 --> 03:44:19.840
america stop lying is he ever going to actually say that a lot of course not this is exactly how

03:44:19.840 --> 03:44:30.880
you walk that fine line look at this guy see him for the malevolent saboteur that he is things

03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:36.080
that's a recipe for absolute disaster think that brian hooker and mary holland and this

03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:45.200
traitor did a podcast that essentially got me fired from chd because i said that he was misleading

03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:55.120
brian hooker and mary holland about the dangers of the the double-stranded dna without informing

03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:59.520
them that transfection in its purest form was criminally negligent

03:45:04.320 --> 03:45:09.760
saboteurs are everywhere ladies and gentlemen liars are everywhere and if you want to know why

03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:13.040
jonathan kooie attacks everybody because there aren't very many good people

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:18.640
a lot of these people work for the weaponized piles of money that want to enslave your

03:45:18.640 --> 03:45:24.240
grandchildren and tell you start to understand that when the system is playing for all the marbles

03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:30.720
there's going to be a lot of people like kevin and robert malone and maryll nass and and and and

03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:37.440
and the list is endless and they're all drifting on a different angle some of them are complaining

03:45:37.440 --> 03:45:42.800
that they lost their license because they prescribed ivermectin others them are are complaining

03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:47.600
that that they were censored for what they said on their podcast and now they have to have other

03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:56.080
ways of raising money like locals the completely perverted destroyed platform owned by peter

03:45:56.080 --> 03:46:03.440
teal and whatever weaponized piles of money he orchestrates that censored everything to do

03:46:03.440 --> 03:46:10.240
with carl rittenhouse or kyle rittenhouse when it was uh locals is a joke and yet who asks you to

03:46:10.240 --> 03:46:17.440
go to locals who's got a space on locals who's selling their rifle coffee so that you can have

03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:22.800
a the word rifle on your on your credit card statements for the rest of your life

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:30.480
once you start to see that all these people were just shepherds or honeypots or

03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:36.960
or attractors that that allowed the government the fbi the cia to find out who what everyone

03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:38.640
was thinking and who was thinking it

03:46:41.520 --> 03:46:46.960
while these posers were elevated on social media to collect ever more mouth breathers ever more

03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:52.720
skilled social media watchers and ever more fooled social media watchers who didn't see

03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:59.280
the fake illusions of consensus created in almost every thread these people have ever posted

03:46:59.280 --> 03:47:04.160
in almost every comment thread that these people have ever curated on sub stack

03:47:04.160 --> 03:47:09.680
is people pretending to argue pretending to oppose one another so that

03:47:09.680 --> 03:47:13.280
10 comments later it seems like you've got to wade into this mosh pit

03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:21.280
it's a lala palooza of liars and they've been in place from the very beginning lying

03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:28.560
and kevin is one of them tester you've just jumped the shark man now now you're talking like

03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:33.520
you don't like vaccines no vaccines i just don't like people who don't have my

03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:38.560
liability for absolute disaster huh i love vaccines man now you now you're talking

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:43.680
and like you don't like vaccines no i don't like vaccines i just don't like people who don't have

03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:48.960
my liability when they make them oh so you know you sound a lot like robert f Kennedy jr you just

03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:54.480
once randomized control trials you know placebo trials for vaccines and then he's fine with mandating

03:47:54.640 --> 03:48:02.000
them you're just like brett widenstein who thinks that vaccines are the absolute best

03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:12.240
invention since the wheel and the machine gun kevin mccernan team worst case scenario maybe

03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:19.520
one of the honorary captains with a gold band around his t-shirt like once you see them ladies

03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:23.440
and gentlemen now we have to show them to the kids now we have to show them to all the college

03:48:23.440 --> 03:48:29.760
kids that think that these people might be and show them for what they are

03:48:31.760 --> 03:48:37.520
this is a big difference okay the technology works but but you can't have a market the technology

03:48:37.520 --> 03:48:42.640
works vaccine technology works vaccines i just don't like people who don't have my

03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:48.080
liability when they make them this is a big difference okay the technology works

03:48:48.800 --> 03:48:53.520
but but you can't have a market where the people stop lying can can cut the corner

03:48:53.520 --> 03:48:57.680
manufacturing because they're no longer alive they've they socialized the cost of the damages of

03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:03.680
vaccines onto the vaccine courts and the bear system that's nuts i mean oh the vaccine courts

03:49:03.680 --> 03:49:07.760
are they a violation of our seventh amendment kevin or are you just saying that it's crazy

03:49:07.760 --> 03:49:18.240
and notice ladies and gentlemen how far we are into this discussion where the legal basis for

03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:24.960
the pandemic has not been mentioned by name the prep act has not been mentioned by name

03:49:26.160 --> 03:49:30.560
they just drop it out of his lexicon on accident or is it part of the tabletop

03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:34.640
rehearsal of this ridiculous illusion of consensus

03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:44.640
i need you to share this video as widely as you can possibly share it in an aggressive way that

03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:51.360
you've never shared it before and when jeff from earth starts making clips or when sooth spider

03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:57.120
has the the subtitles up i need you to share it as widely as you possibly can with a fervor that

03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:04.080
you've never had before i want a copy of this video to show up at his house on a usb drive

03:50:09.680 --> 03:50:13.680
products and every day i got to keep track that my products don't have a contaminant in them they

03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:21.360
don't have to do that man i don't know like you are really in this area where if you talk about

03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:27.200
vaccines or anything about them you are you're an anti-vaxxer yeah you're an anti-vaxxer exactly

03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:32.560
that's that's that's third rail material but but think of the framing of that of that stereotype

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:38.160
right are you what's your position on antibiotics are you pro or anti-anabotics here we go have you

03:50:38.160 --> 03:50:45.200
ever been asked that right antibiotics and vaccines are exactly the same in the biology of kevin

03:50:45.200 --> 03:50:52.000
mccernan in the biology of frances collins in the biology of tony fauci in the biology of

03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:58.400
eco-health alliance in peter day second the biology of bret weinstein in the biology of all of these

03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:08.720
posers yeah i mean you don't categorize like thoughts the cycle is pretty cool but i don't know about

03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:16.560
z-pack right yes and he did say that the oh z-pack he just said interesting um he he actually just

03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:22.800
did say that right contaminants are the problem also laying down the foundation for what these

03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:30.960
vaccine people will get away with the adulteration nice catch Pamela yeah you're an anti-vaxxer exactly

03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:35.600
that's that's that's third rail material but but think of the framing of that of that

03:51:35.600 --> 03:51:41.440
stereotype right are you what's your position on antibiotics are you pro or anti-anabotics

03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:47.440
have you ever been asked that right i mean you don't categorize like thoughts the cycle is pretty

03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:53.840
cool but i don't know about the z-pack right now coronavirus you don't talk about classes of drugs

03:51:53.840 --> 03:51:59.920
like this why are we talking about vaccines like this pro or anti that's a false dichotomy some

03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:03.920
vaccines are good for certain people i'll tell you if i'm if i'm a family that's got epilepsy i'm

03:52:03.920 --> 03:52:07.600
gonna read every damn packet insert to figure out which one of those i should take because they

03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:12.320
all have different risk profiles and epilepsy is one of those conditions that are oh if you have

03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:17.040
epilepsy you should be worried about which vaccine your kid takes but if your kid is normally healthy

03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:26.000
you don't have to worry at all what an asshole what a monster this is just disgusting now i getting

03:52:26.080 --> 03:52:29.520
now i'm getting really disturbed by this because this is just disgusting

03:52:33.360 --> 03:52:37.760
this is just somebody who works for the slavers that's all this is are genetically pretty

03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:42.560
predisposed to having bad reactions to some vaccines genetically predisposed to having

03:52:42.560 --> 03:52:48.560
bad reactions to vaccines that sounds an awful lot like a book that was written before the pandemic

03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:58.880
called the the environmental and genetic causes of autism the strange thing about it is

03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:06.560
kevin mccernan is that this author who is connected intimately to chd and i think is an absolute fake

03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:15.680
is james lion's wiler who started the ipack place which is also probably nonsense and he absorbs

03:53:15.760 --> 03:53:21.040
what he can and he says the good things that he can but writing a book where there are genetic

03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:26.800
environmental causes of autism is a very disingenuous way of not focusing on the dangers of the

03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:37.600
vaccine schedule and curiously enough james lion wiler james lion winer was the guy one of the

03:53:37.600 --> 03:53:45.120
first guys actually was cited listen carefully was cited in the blog post of dan seratkin

03:53:46.320 --> 03:53:53.840
as being the first blog on earth to publish the fear and cleavage site observation

03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:01.280
who the hell is this guy who the hell is james lion's wiler to have known that the fear and cleavage

03:54:01.280 --> 03:54:10.080
site was a sign of a lab leak before this guy knew before the human genome project genius knew

03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:16.000
that fear and cleavage site was an indication of a lab leak james lion winer he's the one who had

03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:22.960
it he knew and and and dan seratkin whose dad works at los alamos laboratory he knew and some

03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:30.400
ridiculously fake russian guy living in canada named yuridegan he knew that it was a fear and

03:54:30.480 --> 03:54:36.400
cleavage site that indicated it was a lab leak and then there was this charles rixie guy i guess who

03:54:36.400 --> 03:54:42.960
has a a really big excel sheet full of information about the the virus and the fear and cleavage

03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:57.120
site it's not going to stop every day we are going to shop at this tree until it falls over

03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:03.920
every day we are going to hack at this dragon until it's dead every day we are going to oppose

03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:10.240
this mythology until the people that are trying to force us to teach it to our children are out

03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:20.320
of our lives so a couple of weeks ago just some night i was sitting around i was i threw out a

03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:27.200
tweet that said how long would a vaccine need to be tested before it was safe to be mandatory

03:55:27.200 --> 03:55:32.560
on society this was like two or three weeks ago people went nuts on me they were like why would

03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:37.520
you even ask this question when it's ready we'll we'll give it to people like wait a second no no

03:55:37.520 --> 03:55:44.640
no you decide beforehand what the testing parameters will be and then you let people know so that way

03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:49.680
everybody gets a chance to see hey that's what they said it would do that's what it did that's what

03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:53.920
we were worried about these are the unintended consequences that we were able to monitor for

03:55:54.560 --> 03:56:00.720
but people treated me as though i was in anti-vaxxer i'm a peace corps volunteer right like i am yeah

03:56:00.720 --> 03:56:06.480
i am a normist a peace corps volunteer who worked for Monsanto in the world bank

03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:14.640
actually that might make sense because i have the feeling that the peace corps a lot of the

03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:18.160
people that i've met in the peace corps are kind of weird like they also think that you

03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:24.000
un is kind of cool and stuff the peace corps might be a little weirder than i i'm letting on here

03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:29.120
yeah yeah a hundred percent i met a lot of teachers that had done their thing in the peace

03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:33.120
corps and they all seemed a little bit a little bit naive and also a little bit

03:56:34.080 --> 03:56:40.160
a little bit uh i guess the word is naive man a hundred percent but if you come anywhere near

03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:46.160
talking about this i saw the Cornell Alliance for Science equating anyone that was going to

03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:53.200
the protests against lockdowns as anti-vaxxers and like right-wing seditionists and you're like

03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:59.760
you are a public university and you're sitting there saying there is no anyone that disagrees

03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:05.520
with this point of view at all should be completely labeled and and written off and thrown out of

03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:11.600
the conversation yeah it is it's a new priesthood and we're not wearing black robes we're wearing

03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:16.000
white ones now the scientists are the ones who can read the code of life and it will be told to

03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:22.880
what it is from on high uh there is a problem with us having this irrational irreverence on science

03:57:23.760 --> 03:57:29.200
i'm a scientist i have certain directionals i'm not an epidemiologist i'm not a doctor i can do

03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:33.760
the genetics on these things but you know i think you should have economists at the table

03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:38.880
right this oh we have an concept that you know follow this we have an economist his name is

03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:43.600
j about a charia he's actually an economist not an epidemiologist so you just so you know

03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:48.240
science and only the scientists lead everything is dangerous uh you need a lot of different

03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:53.680
expertise to to think through what's going on here and if you bring up any challenge to this like

03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:57.760
i don't like the fact that the incentive structures on the pharmaceutical industry

03:57:57.760 --> 03:58:02.480
lead to really negative consequences i really believe in immunology and vaccination i just

03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:08.080
don't believe i really believe in immunology and vaccination is one of the most amazing things

03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:14.960
ever um it's not a good t-shirt like freedom is measured in ohms but it's funny i believe

03:58:14.960 --> 03:58:25.120
in immunology and vaccines is about as it is a deckler i had covid and a super spreader event

03:58:25.920 --> 03:58:30.320
the legislation you put forward with these people you're instantly labeled anti-science

03:58:30.320 --> 03:58:36.000
you're an idiot you're you got a tin foil hat and we're gonna discredit you um some of that is

03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:41.200
coming i think because of uh the manner which be fun science there's there's there's far too many

03:58:41.200 --> 03:58:45.360
any scientists that i think are getting funded through government um sources and they should be

03:58:45.360 --> 03:58:50.800
in the private sector uh and and working in careers that don't so it's the government's fault it's

03:58:50.800 --> 03:58:56.000
not the way we do science it's it maybe it's the grants they write but he's not really saying it very

03:58:56.000 --> 03:58:59.760
right right he just wants private money instead of government money or maybe he wants government

03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:04.480
money given to private companies with less strings attached but this is about as imprecise a

03:59:04.560 --> 03:59:10.960
discussion as you can possibly manage to muster have those um those types of conflicts involved

03:59:10.960 --> 03:59:15.040
right when you're when you're working under that environment you don't have market forces

03:59:15.040 --> 03:59:18.880
guiding the research that you should be doing you're just getting money from stolen money from the

03:59:18.880 --> 03:59:24.800
government uh that effectively is is oftentimes reinforcing their agenda right they they will

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:31.280
fund things based on what they i mean look at n i a i uh is it night no it's night n i d i a

03:59:31.280 --> 03:59:37.680
national institute for drug abuse okay we have an institution whose goal is kind of evident in

03:59:37.680 --> 03:59:43.440
their title of their institution national institute for drug abuse not drug benefits drug abuse

03:59:43.440 --> 03:59:48.080
so all they do is they look for a science that shows drugs harm you that's not science

03:59:48.080 --> 03:59:51.840
that's this propaganda the whole institution is propaganda wow

03:59:52.320 --> 04:00:02.160
the whole institute of nida where my friend bruce hope still works where my friend aske did his

04:00:02.160 --> 04:00:10.160
postdoc with bruce hope trying to understand the activation profile of rats exposed to cocaine

04:00:10.160 --> 04:00:19.840
to understand the addictive circuitry now whether or not that's worthwhile science is is irrelevant

04:00:19.840 --> 04:00:27.360
irrelevant is he actually saying that what nida does is is all wise

04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:34.480
that yavin shiram the guy who runs that place is full of shit

04:00:36.480 --> 04:00:42.000
it's just extraordinary the kind of statements that he's willing to make right now and in retrospect

04:00:42.000 --> 04:00:49.120
in four and a half years afterward it should be as obvious as apple pie smell from an apple pie

04:00:49.120 --> 04:00:56.640
that just got smashed in your face that this guy is working against us he is part of the system

04:00:56.640 --> 04:01:01.760
that is trying to enslave our children listen carefully okay national institute for drug abuse

04:01:01.760 --> 04:01:08.320
okay we have an institution whose goal is kind of evident in their title of their institution

04:01:08.320 --> 04:01:13.920
national institute for drug abuse not drug benefits drug abuse so all they do is they look for a

04:01:13.920 --> 04:01:19.120
science that shows drugs harm you and so what what what does he think the rest of the nih

04:01:19.120 --> 04:01:24.160
does when they look at drugs look for them to harm you or look the nida is very specifically

04:01:24.160 --> 04:01:30.400
trying to understand the harms that addictive drugs can do what a jackass

04:01:33.360 --> 04:01:37.920
now maybe you might say that nida should be money better spent on the opioid crisis or getting

04:01:37.920 --> 04:01:43.520
cocaine off the streets or educate or whatever but this is just awful and what's awful about

04:01:43.520 --> 04:01:49.520
this is that it probably falls under the rubric of people not taking the opioid crisis seriously

04:01:49.520 --> 04:01:54.480
he's probably in a way was coached to say this to try and make it seem like the drug addiction is

04:01:54.480 --> 04:01:59.360
not a problem in our society why would we ever spend government money trying to understand drug

04:01:59.360 --> 04:02:08.960
addiction what a monster what an awful monster to say that addiction is not something that actually

04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:12.560
is a medical condition that affects people especially in a country that's being

04:02:13.360 --> 04:02:20.400
being overloaded on its streets by by opioids that are 10 or 100 times stronger than anything

04:02:20.400 --> 04:02:27.440
that could be made from a natural product he doesn't want to have a better understanding of how

04:02:27.440 --> 04:02:32.640
addiction can be debilitating and how we shouldn't blame people who are addicted because your brain

04:02:32.640 --> 04:02:38.000
circuitry permanently changes and alters your behavior it's out of your control he thinks that

04:02:38.000 --> 04:02:44.960
it's just all propaganda

04:02:47.760 --> 04:02:52.080
i think this is the probably the worst part of the stream for me because this is coming at

04:02:52.080 --> 04:02:56.960
neurobiology and anything that neuroscience has ever really done useful with regard to

04:02:56.960 --> 04:03:03.280
understanding addiction as a medical problem a thing that can cement into the brain of a rat

04:03:03.840 --> 04:03:09.200
can probably cement into the brain of a human if the same circuits are involved

04:03:13.520 --> 04:03:20.800
and so he's just callously throwing out addiction as completely useless why would we ever study that

04:03:25.040 --> 04:03:30.160
this is shocking to me so shocking that i feel like i have to play it yet again

04:03:30.960 --> 04:03:39.040
niai uh is it no it's nida nidi a national institute for drug abuse okay we have an institution

04:03:39.600 --> 04:03:45.440
whose goal is kind of evident in their title of their institution national institute for drug

04:03:45.440 --> 04:03:50.880
abuse not drug benefits drug abuse so all they do is they look for a science that shows drugs harm

04:03:50.880 --> 04:03:56.160
you that's not science that's this propaganda the whole institution is propaganda right they're

04:03:56.240 --> 04:04:00.640
looking for the negative consequences of of they shouldn't do that just should be natural

04:04:00.640 --> 04:04:05.200
and should have drug research right look for the pros and the cons and and this is the

04:04:05.200 --> 04:04:09.760
this is the organization that has funded most of the research showing cannabis harms people

04:04:09.760 --> 04:04:14.560
yet we've got alcohol in the streets and an opiate epidemic and cannabis is like benign

04:04:14.560 --> 04:04:19.360
compared to these things there's an institute dedicated to tearing it down you may be the devil

04:04:19.440 --> 04:04:21.360
you're you're the most persuasive

04:04:24.320 --> 04:04:32.640
like i i i am completely wrapped by your argument but i can say that this is well outside of the

04:04:32.640 --> 04:04:37.200
i don't know if you've listened to eric wine stein at all he has this podcast called the portal

04:04:38.080 --> 04:04:42.800
i have not i i saw his name flash to twitter once or twice it is definitely

04:04:42.800 --> 04:04:46.400
worthless eric wine stein the portal

04:04:52.160 --> 04:04:58.640
i will remind you that eric wine stein the portal in 2019 was where where peter teal said that he

04:04:58.640 --> 04:05:05.040
doesn't trust science because all these hyper specialization has resulted in the the propensity

04:05:05.040 --> 04:05:09.920
for people to lie and exaggerate and that's where he starts with interpreting these things like you

04:05:09.920 --> 04:05:15.040
know uh string theory and antibodies and immunity and vaccines

04:05:20.000 --> 04:05:25.680
ladies and gentlemen do you see why he would want us tell you that that cannabis can help

04:05:25.680 --> 04:05:30.400
with addiction cannabis isn't addictive cannabis is not a bad thing

04:05:33.360 --> 04:05:37.120
but it can help with chronic pain it can help with the opioid epidemic we don't need

04:05:37.120 --> 04:05:45.600
nida anymore nida just just trashes marijuana so we shouldn't study the way the addictive

04:05:45.600 --> 04:05:48.880
circuitry of the brain works anymore why would we waste our time on that

04:05:51.440 --> 04:06:00.480
it makes me very sad that that it's so obvious now that that this is a medler a person working

04:06:00.560 --> 04:06:07.840
for the national security state that is currently executing this on our on our society and on our

04:06:07.840 --> 04:06:14.320
world he is worth checking out if only because he knows where the edges of the overton window are

04:06:14.320 --> 04:06:19.680
and he's pushing well outside of them and so i think i picked up was he he may have been

04:06:19.680 --> 04:06:24.400
unrogan lately and i think i picked up some of his inklings on on bio weapon stuff and and uh

04:06:25.120 --> 04:06:30.240
um yeah i'll look into it i'm a little nervous about all the bio weapon accusations right now

04:06:30.240 --> 04:06:35.520
as it reminds me of weapons and mass destruction you know let's let's get some scan evidence to

04:06:35.520 --> 04:06:39.920
to beat the war drum and go get in a war china that that's to me they're they're applied for

04:06:39.920 --> 04:06:44.800
a crush and air principle to that idea you better have damn good evidence it's a bio weapon before

04:06:44.800 --> 04:06:48.880
you start beating that drum because the history of us going to war is over really thin data

04:06:49.520 --> 04:06:56.640
yeah and i mean war with china like it's it's a much bigger world if we say let's let them succeed

04:06:56.640 --> 04:07:02.560
the way they want to succeed and let's let us succeed the way that we want to succeed and try as best

04:07:02.560 --> 04:07:08.080
you can to not uh have to get into any kind of a fight because that's a fight where there's no

04:07:08.080 --> 04:07:15.040
good outcomes there if there's enough trade between that what do they say when borders close bullets

04:07:15.120 --> 04:07:21.760
fly right if there's enough trade between those two countries uh it that will become a mutually

04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:25.840
assured destruction if you get aggressive uh between any of those two parties and so i think

04:07:25.840 --> 04:07:30.960
that's the solution is we need to be i what i'm afraid will come out of this is xenophobia

04:07:30.960 --> 04:07:35.280
and nationalism where we're going to pull all of our manufacturing out of china and try and base

04:07:35.280 --> 04:07:39.520
it here and and all the cost of goods will go through the roof as a result of this and uh we'll

04:07:39.520 --> 04:07:44.160
start reinforcing national boundaries i think that's a disaster i think oh that would be terrible

04:07:44.160 --> 04:07:49.840
direction which is encourage more globalization oh encourage more globalization wow that sounds

04:07:49.840 --> 04:07:54.800
simple right global solutions global problems global solutions but wait we're supposed to

04:07:54.800 --> 04:08:01.040
decentralize everything he told us that we should decentralize it's a decentralizing virus

04:08:02.240 --> 04:08:05.440
the same response isn't going to work everywhere but we should globalize

04:08:07.920 --> 04:08:13.520
is your brain being being smashed yet like the host said your brain is being smashed

04:08:15.120 --> 04:08:20.240
minus economic ties to the point that if you ever decide to cut off ties with the country

04:08:20.240 --> 04:08:25.680
you're basically cutting off your leg um you need to be so you know economically integrated

04:08:25.680 --> 04:08:29.920
throughout the world that war is obsolete um because there's nothing good that comes out of that

04:08:29.920 --> 04:08:40.080
there integrated in the world so much that war becomes obsolete that's fantastic i love it i love

04:08:40.640 --> 04:08:45.760
it i love it that just wrecks economies um all for just nationalistic pride which doesn't really

04:08:45.760 --> 04:08:52.640
in the end give you anything nationalistic pride nationalism it's such an overrated force in history

04:08:52.640 --> 04:08:59.600
isn't it nationalism is such an overrated force in history i guess that's why mr heart my high school

04:08:59.600 --> 04:09:06.000
world history teacher started and ended the class by writing the word nationalism on the blackboard

04:09:06.800 --> 04:09:13.600
I guess that's why nationalism is just stupid even though mr heart in my high school world history

04:09:13.600 --> 04:09:18.560
class started and ended with it and he was such a good teacher that i actually remember

04:09:18.560 --> 04:09:23.280
that he started and ended with one word on the blackboard at the beginning of the year and at

04:09:23.280 --> 04:09:29.440
the end of the year if you remember one thing from my class kids remember that nationalism is the

04:09:30.400 --> 04:09:40.480
most powerful force in the world thanks mr heart thanks for making me equipped enough

04:09:41.440 --> 04:09:48.880
to see even the the silliest lies that these people are telling me in my adulthood thanks mr

04:09:48.880 --> 04:09:53.760
heart your economic ties to the point that if you ever decide to cut off ties with the country

04:09:53.760 --> 04:09:59.200
you're basically cutting off your leg um you need to be so you know economically integrated

04:09:59.200 --> 04:10:03.600
throughout the world that war is obsolete because there's nothing good that comes out of that that

04:10:03.600 --> 04:10:08.960
just wrecks economies um all for just nationalistic pride which doesn't really in the end give you

04:10:08.960 --> 04:10:14.160
anything doesn't give you anything i hope that's not what happens i hope i hope a nationalistic

04:10:14.160 --> 04:10:18.960
pride of being proud of being american will never get you anything we get come to our senses but i

04:10:18.960 --> 04:10:24.640
do worry that a lot of this sentiment of oh it came from muhan and and uh we need to you know

04:10:24.640 --> 04:10:29.680
we need to snap them in order kind of thing is is uh it's jingoism that's not going to

04:10:29.680 --> 04:10:35.280
gonna help during an epidemic well it's like uh rene jarard talks about like in a society if you

04:10:35.280 --> 04:10:41.840
have wrecked everything you will find a scapegoat to place that damage on yes so that everybody can

04:10:41.840 --> 04:10:48.080
load up their sins and send that scapegoat out to die and it and that's the way you purify your

04:10:48.080 --> 04:10:53.600
society and and uh that is coming whenever we get to a resolution here yeah sure they're

04:10:53.600 --> 04:10:58.640
gonna punish Pfizer or something like that or they'll say that there was dna double-stranded

04:10:58.640 --> 04:11:04.560
contamination because no one you can't have a functioning society where they think the cause

04:11:04.560 --> 04:11:10.480
of the disease happened within the society so you have to find it root it out and send it out

04:11:10.480 --> 04:11:14.640
and there it's going to be something and so we just need to be on guard for that hope we can

04:11:14.640 --> 04:11:19.680
purify society i mean anyways i think some of that is what's going on right now is that

04:11:19.680 --> 04:11:25.120
we had a lot of sins in the economy coming up into january a lot of sins why do we keep calling

04:11:25.120 --> 04:11:32.720
it sins what is this shit and they're they're erasing all of that history with the viruses here

04:11:32.720 --> 04:11:38.080
and we couldn't control this and it blew up the economy and the sins of the past are going to

04:11:38.080 --> 04:11:43.920
get ignored that led up to this um so there's there's i think some of that's already in place

04:11:44.640 --> 04:11:50.480
unfortunately well one question that i ask everyone uh before they hop up here is where do you think

04:11:50.480 --> 04:12:00.240
the world will be in two weeks two weeks i hope to see a few more brave jurisdictions opening up

04:12:00.240 --> 04:12:08.000
like texas georgia and and maybe five more states like that and i hope this sends um a glaring signal

04:12:08.000 --> 04:12:15.520
to a lot of businesses that relocate your business to the jurisdictions that that open up because

04:12:15.520 --> 04:12:22.160
the biggest fear we're we're a small 20 person company um middle of a raise um we didn't expect

04:12:22.160 --> 04:12:28.000
that this would uh this would come about fortunately the cannabis industry being selected as um

04:12:28.000 --> 04:12:32.480
an essential business is meant the raises going fairly well we we initially thought it was all

04:12:32.480 --> 04:12:36.160
going to evaporate but right now there's very few places to park money and so people are parking

04:12:36.160 --> 04:12:42.080
them in essential businesses um but we're also going to central jurisdictions investors are

04:12:42.080 --> 04:12:47.200
going to want to know i want they're they're going to want to invest in jurisdictions that aren't

04:12:47.200 --> 04:12:52.160
going to do this to them again uh and so the money is going to move and a lot of the businesses now

04:12:52.160 --> 04:12:55.600
can be more virtual we're going through that lesson right now with this and with zoom and

04:12:55.600 --> 04:13:01.200
everything else and so sweden and texas and georgia those things are going to come on the radar of

04:13:01.200 --> 04:13:06.000
for businesses so we need to put our we need to get out of california come to mizuri brother

04:13:06.000 --> 04:13:12.960
we've got the most plant geneticists here per capita of anywhere st leis is the right on the river

04:13:12.960 --> 04:13:19.600
we're protected as far as you know having problems on the coast a lot of colleagues up there at

04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:23.520
washew the genome center we used to collaborate with up there and rob rob probably interacted

04:13:23.520 --> 04:13:28.480
with them as well it's it's a hotbed for excellent genomics is going on st louis some of the best

04:13:28.480 --> 04:13:34.160
it is my belief that uh that you know the emerging mega regions the major cities that will happen

04:13:34.720 --> 04:13:40.000
are going to be built in this new post corona era because what you're going to find is what we

04:13:40.000 --> 04:13:47.600
valued cities for in 2019 is very very different from what will value them and to your point

04:13:47.600 --> 04:13:52.880
it's the regulations that will be everything and it will be who is the first city to open up and

04:13:52.960 --> 04:14:00.160
my belief is while all these rules are in place start doing really inventive things let drones fly

04:14:00.160 --> 04:14:06.960
let your yes do as much automated driving as you possibly can now make that available and make it

04:14:06.960 --> 04:14:12.080
as easy as possible to start those companies nail on the head i mean i think that's the question

04:14:12.080 --> 04:14:16.000
everyone needs to be asking all of these regulations that the government is lifting right now to deal

04:14:16.000 --> 04:14:21.680
with the pandemic we have to ask the government why can it be that way all the time if this stimulates

04:14:21.680 --> 04:14:25.600
the economy when we have a pandemic shouldn't that be the permanent state of the economy

04:14:25.600 --> 04:14:30.640
that we never get one again right there's going to be a tendency for them to want to bolt some of

04:14:30.640 --> 04:14:36.560
these things wait so he can stimulate the economy to not get a pandemic what in this wow after this

04:14:36.560 --> 04:14:42.000
is gone i think you resist that with every ounce of our soul because the the it's coming really clear

04:14:42.000 --> 04:14:48.000
that the fda managing and regulating a mask like what the hell is that all about fda life is a

04:14:48.000 --> 04:14:54.560
physical therapist fda again probably one of the very first people to move her uh practice online

04:14:54.560 --> 04:15:00.960
and the number of laws that she still has to face in order to be able to help somebody that like

04:15:00.960 --> 04:15:06.320
was supposed to get surgery on their back or on their elbow or on their wrist yeah like she has

04:15:06.320 --> 04:15:11.200
to jump through all these hoops in order to be able to treat these people but some of the laws have

04:15:11.200 --> 04:15:15.360
come off and it's like all of a sudden there's the state of new york can now get help from a

04:15:15.360 --> 04:15:20.160
practitioner in missouri so bang bang bang she's not and they're gonna look for it new york is

04:15:20.160 --> 04:15:24.000
probably the worst state of them all we we had took us probably two years to try and get a

04:15:24.000 --> 04:15:28.480
clear license in new york they're there and they've done that to the bitcoin space as well they like

04:15:28.480 --> 04:15:33.840
pushed out um with that bit license crap that they do they're they're a regular that state

04:15:33.840 --> 04:15:40.560
is is uh why was he working for two years to get a clear laboratory approval why would he need an

04:15:41.040 --> 04:15:49.040
laboratory for testing you hear that for a second please he works on cannabis genomes

04:15:49.840 --> 04:15:56.000
he tests cannabis he sequences cannabis why would he need to get a cleolab certification in new york

04:15:56.000 --> 04:16:00.480
and why would it he have been busy with it for two years what is he talking about there it'd be an

04:16:00.480 --> 04:16:07.600
interesting thing to dig into because we were talking about cleolabs an hour ago because those

04:16:07.680 --> 04:16:12.720
are the labs that only could execute the pcr test which is as easy as making chocolate milk

04:16:14.960 --> 04:16:19.360
and yet it took him two years to get a license in new york and what was he getting that license

04:16:19.360 --> 04:16:25.520
floor but he's not legalizing cannabis he doesn't sell cannabis some of the mess that they're in

04:16:25.520 --> 04:16:29.680
right now is because it's just nothing but red tape in that state to get anything done well and

04:16:29.680 --> 04:16:35.200
they had an opportunity to be one of the great agriculture states they are as far as you're laying

04:16:36.000 --> 04:16:41.760
but the amount of red tape that you had to go through to do the farmer's markets and all of

04:16:41.760 --> 04:16:48.320
those things like it's difficult to do business in new york city and so unlike here where it when

04:16:48.320 --> 04:16:54.320
when the grocery store got shut off i was able to do grocery delivery from farmers overnight like

04:16:54.320 --> 04:17:00.240
that nice yeah yeah i i'm hopeful that that that will change people's you know they say in a pandemic

04:17:00.240 --> 04:17:05.040
everyone becomes a libertarian right we've got like you know we delivery now alcohol can be

04:17:05.040 --> 04:17:09.600
delivered like every everyone's cheering on these things that they were sort of shunning when there

04:17:09.600 --> 04:17:15.440
was not an emergency in place and i'm hoping that's going to shine and open up people's opinions on

04:17:15.440 --> 04:17:23.760
this that these regulations are actually dangerous and our regulations can kill kevin this has been

04:17:23.760 --> 04:17:28.480
absolutely fantastic people are going to want to follow and interact with you hopefully to yell

04:17:28.800 --> 04:17:35.680
at you and not just me but uh what how can people find you you're out there on twitter i i were

04:17:35.680 --> 04:17:40.960
i'm on twitter um the company we work at is medicinal genomics um this is a company that's cannabis

04:17:40.960 --> 04:17:46.240
genetics and and cannabis safety testing we're proficient at um at tracking microbes on cannabis

04:17:46.240 --> 04:17:51.040
so this is tracking covid is right in our wheelhouse we build a lot of portable genetic tools to

04:17:51.040 --> 04:17:55.600
decentralize testing they you know people could probably hijack the tools we make right now to do

04:17:55.600 --> 04:18:01.280
home testing for covid because all of the tools we're using for this we can't support you in that

04:18:01.280 --> 04:18:05.760
but i highly encourage you to do it and there's probably a reddit thread just waiting to waiting

04:18:05.760 --> 04:18:11.120
to everybody to share all their information or a github or all those are publicly available to

04:18:11.120 --> 04:18:15.680
do covid testing in your house uh i will point you in all the directions you need to do it but we

04:18:15.680 --> 04:18:22.080
we uh we don't want the FDA on our on our case so we can't sell it or support it um so uh that's

04:18:22.080 --> 04:18:26.160
kind of our specialty is is uh cannabis genetics we do a lot of blockchain work with this as well

04:18:26.160 --> 04:18:30.400
there's a different whole nother rabbit hole on why we use blockchains to track all this data

04:18:30.400 --> 04:18:35.360
but it's necessary in in the industry like ours um but we also manage a cannabis um science

04:18:35.360 --> 04:18:39.280
conference every year called canmed which is going to be held probably in september the

04:18:40.320 --> 04:18:46.640
blockchain he also wants to do blockchain peer review publishing some other bullshit

04:18:46.960 --> 04:18:51.360
as what we're aiming for assuming the lockdowns um don't disrupt that but right now we're

04:18:51.920 --> 04:18:55.440
everything we're looking at we think this is going to be over by then but that's a that's a

04:18:55.440 --> 04:19:01.360
conference about a thousand people that has um physicians it has genomic scientists like myself

04:19:01.360 --> 04:19:05.520
it has growers it has analytical chemists that are trying to track all these cannabinoids so if you

04:19:05.520 --> 04:19:10.080
want to learn how to do personalized medicine off the plants you can grow out of the ground

04:19:10.080 --> 04:19:15.120
and do it with the utmost scientific rigor that could even sustain an FDA trial those are the

04:19:15.120 --> 04:19:19.840
people to come and see um that happens every year what do we need it we don't need an FDA

04:19:19.840 --> 04:19:24.400
trial you told us earlier in the hour that the FDA can't touch these things you're such a

04:19:24.400 --> 04:19:33.680
contradictory incongruent i can't help but laugh it's comical at this stage it's comical if this

04:19:33.680 --> 04:19:38.880
is what my kids are up against we're gonna win it's just a matter of time steady pressure on a

04:19:38.880 --> 04:19:45.440
fake that's this fake um just becomes more fake and so please share this video with as many

04:19:45.440 --> 04:19:49.520
people as you can possibly share it with and encourage me to check that out this is actually

04:19:49.520 --> 04:19:54.720
one of the biggest jokes um uh probably linked in in the universe use your twitter handle um

04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:58.640
yeah it's canon underscore mccernan but yeah uh check out those videos before they melt them because

04:19:59.680 --> 04:20:03.440
put them up in library or some other blockchain system they can't we're not going to check out

04:20:03.520 --> 04:20:08.800
his videos all right thank you um and we're not going to listen to that anymore ladies and

04:20:08.800 --> 04:20:13.360
gentlemen a couple months ago kevin mccernan was part of this group of controlled operatives it

04:20:13.360 --> 04:20:22.800
includes uh uh robert malone and jill glasspool malone and jessica rose and uh brett wine stein

04:20:22.800 --> 04:20:30.960
and harvey rice um for sure those four or five people are liars they've lied to my face um they've

04:20:30.960 --> 04:20:36.160
lied to me in sms and so unlike the rest of the people in this picture i can't be sure about them

04:20:36.160 --> 04:20:41.120
but these these four people or five people actually i'm very sure are liars because i've had

04:20:41.120 --> 04:20:46.320
personal experience with them lying and they've been lying about personal things about what happened

04:20:46.320 --> 04:20:51.760
what was said but also very specifically about their experience with the pandemic all of these

04:20:51.760 --> 04:20:56.640
people have had it all of these people were in super spreader events and all of these people have

04:20:56.720 --> 04:21:05.600
been involved in an ongoing multi-year international campaign to make sure that people around the world

04:21:06.320 --> 04:21:11.520
would never come to the conclusion that a national security state funded by global

04:21:12.240 --> 04:21:18.320
weaponized piles of money would fake a pandemic in order to enslave our grandchildren but that's

04:21:18.320 --> 04:21:24.320
indeed what they've done and kevin mccernan works for them and it might have been unwittingly at

04:21:24.320 --> 04:21:30.080
first it might have been unwillingly at first but long long ago those things went away and he has

04:21:30.080 --> 04:21:38.240
been absolutely positively a participant in the national security operation that was the covid-19

04:21:38.240 --> 04:21:47.680
pandemic just like robert malone just like jessica rose these people were too early and too focused

04:21:47.680 --> 04:21:55.040
on specific things or too late and too focused on specific things to have been genuine dissidents

04:21:56.640 --> 04:22:03.680
and their extremely artificial rise through social media their extremely artificial rise in terms of

04:22:03.680 --> 04:22:12.080
spontaneous comfort provided by the almost certainly money laundering observation

04:22:12.880 --> 04:22:22.560
that is locals and sub-stack they're all on locals and sub-stack they're all on gab and telegram

04:22:23.920 --> 04:22:30.160
they're all part of money laundering operations that have funded through peter teal and other

04:22:30.160 --> 04:22:35.920
weaponized piles of money the distraction mechanisms that will make sure that we never wake up to the

04:22:35.920 --> 04:22:42.160
fact that health security and public health are all a lie we never wake up to the fact that

04:22:42.160 --> 04:22:51.360
these people murdered people and lied about it in order for us to believe that an RNA can pandemic

04:22:53.840 --> 04:23:01.680
and an RNA cannot cause a pandemic it cannot pandemic and transfection was always criminally

04:23:01.680 --> 04:23:06.640
negligent and there are hundreds of thousands of people in the united states who are in the

04:23:06.640 --> 04:23:11.040
next couple years going to come to a very rude awakening that they should have done known better

04:23:11.920 --> 04:23:20.640
because their professional qualifications say so so if you're an academic biologist out there if

04:23:20.640 --> 04:23:26.000
you're an MD out there and you're still not aware that the national security state funded by global

04:23:26.000 --> 04:23:32.560
weaponized piles of money was willing to lie about murder so that you would believe that

04:23:32.560 --> 04:23:36.880
the excess deaths could be blamed on a novel virus and you are still not aware that people

04:23:36.880 --> 04:23:43.120
like kevin mccurnan are employed to lie about it then you are still trapped in the national

04:23:43.120 --> 04:23:48.000
security operation that is designed to get you to teach your children this mythology so that

04:23:48.000 --> 04:23:55.200
they will be enslaved forever and this plan has been going on for a very long time and is evidence

04:23:55.200 --> 04:24:01.280
in the books that have been written it is evidence in the insistence on a novel virus

04:24:04.240 --> 04:24:10.000
which was evident already on the 24th of April 2020 in kevin mccurnan's video that we just watched

04:24:10.000 --> 04:24:15.040
these people are part of a team worst case scenario that was put in place to make sure that we would

04:24:15.040 --> 04:24:21.120
not only not question the existence of a novel virus but that we would attribute novel symptoms

04:24:21.120 --> 04:24:28.080
novel disease states to that novel virus that novel spike protein so that when

04:24:28.080 --> 04:24:34.560
transfection and transformation were rolled out en masse that the effects the known side effects

04:24:34.560 --> 04:24:41.760
the known downsides of transfection and transformation could be misconstrued as the effects of a

04:24:41.760 --> 04:24:48.640
gain-of-function spike protein and once you see that kevin mccurnan paul cottrell

04:24:49.840 --> 04:24:51.920
robert malone maryll nass

04:24:53.600 --> 04:24:56.640
walter chestnut jessica rose

04:25:01.760 --> 04:25:10.960
richard flemming charles rixey bret wine steve all of drastic everyone was exclusively focused

04:25:10.960 --> 04:25:14.960
on the gain-of-functions spike protein from the beginning and whether or not it had HIV

04:25:14.960 --> 04:25:21.200
inserts or a spear and cleavage cider staphylcocadenteryotoxin B homologies or some other mimicry

04:25:21.200 --> 04:25:30.160
to the human genome hyper focused on one protein in one consensus sequence that could never be

04:25:30.160 --> 04:25:35.120
found anywhere else because kevin mccurnan just explained it's really hard to sequence viruses

04:25:35.600 --> 04:25:39.360
and people but pcr is like making chocolate milk

04:25:46.320 --> 04:25:50.880
ladies and gentlemen they lied to us about a dangerous novel virus everyone lied to us that's

04:25:50.880 --> 04:25:55.280
the problem that's why i attack everyone because they're still lying about it even when they know

04:25:55.280 --> 04:25:59.040
there's no evidence of spread even they know there's no epidemiological evidence of spread

04:25:59.040 --> 04:26:05.280
even when they are economists that work for the stanford university epidemiological department

04:26:05.280 --> 04:26:08.960
they can't come to the realization that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread so that

04:26:08.960 --> 04:26:14.480
might be a problem j about a charia that new york city might be a problem for your narrative j about

04:26:14.480 --> 04:26:22.240
a charia the calling for focus lockdowns and accepting the existence of a novel spreading rna

04:26:22.240 --> 04:26:26.880
is not exactly biologically plausible and your excuse that you're an economist

04:26:26.960 --> 04:26:32.560
and and and a and an epidemiologist and therefore you can't evaluate what's on this show is a

04:26:32.560 --> 04:26:40.080
mealy mouth bullshit excuse j about a charia don't ever take another selfie with me if you're

04:26:40.080 --> 04:26:47.920
going to continue to lie like this along with kevin mccurnan and and robert melone and maryll nass

04:26:48.000 --> 04:26:52.320
and jill glasspool melone and and and and harvey rice

04:26:56.480 --> 04:27:00.240
ladies and gentlemen stop all transfections and humans because they are trying to eliminate

04:27:00.240 --> 04:27:04.480
the control group by any means necessary share this stream with everybody you know because

04:27:04.480 --> 04:27:09.760
the control group still exists but it won't if kevin mccurnan and robert melone and all

04:27:09.760 --> 04:27:16.400
these people are able to convince our children that this mythology is real i believe in vaccines

04:27:16.480 --> 04:27:21.200
they totally work it's just that i don't like people without without liability

04:27:26.960 --> 04:27:30.240
ladies and gentlemen this has been giggle and biological a high resistance low noise

04:27:30.240 --> 04:27:34.320
information brief brought to you by a biologist if you like like what you've seen and like what you

04:27:34.320 --> 04:27:39.920
heard please share this work because if not enough people are hearing it and if you really believe

04:27:39.920 --> 04:27:44.880
maybe take the time to go to giggle and biological support my family with a little bit of work

04:27:44.880 --> 04:27:51.760
it takes a lot of energy a lot of time to uh you know you don't you don't build a bonfire this

04:27:51.760 --> 04:27:58.880
big uh without preparation um and uh and we're going to keep building bonfires ladies and gentlemen

04:27:58.880 --> 04:28:03.920
thank you very much for joining me thanks to take the time to listen for four hours and 20 minutes

04:28:04.640 --> 04:28:14.800
to kevin mccurnan cannabis man

04:28:17.200 --> 04:28:18.800
four hours and 20 minutes

04:28:21.840 --> 04:28:27.920
how's that for threading the needle how's that for threading the needle that's what i'm talking about

04:28:33.920 --> 04:28:48.320
so
