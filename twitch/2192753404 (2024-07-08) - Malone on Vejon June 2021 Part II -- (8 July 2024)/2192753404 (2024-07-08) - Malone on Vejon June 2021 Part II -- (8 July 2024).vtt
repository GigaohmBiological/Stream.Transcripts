WEBVTT

01:42.433 --> 01:45.374
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

01:47.475 --> 01:57.544
A regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin

02:08.965 --> 02:12.409
He says, son, can you play me a memory?

02:13.310 --> 02:16.534
I'm not really sure how it goes.

02:17.274 --> 02:23.982
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete when I wore a younger man's clothes.

02:38.203 --> 02:51.796
Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling all right

03:08.240 --> 03:22.848
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there's some place that he'd rather be

03:26.852 --> 03:44.610
Bill, I believe this is killing me As a smile ran away from his face Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place Oh, la, la, la

03:54.838 --> 04:09.686
Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talking with David Who's still in the Navy And probably will be flying

04:21.371 --> 04:35.467
The waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinking alone

04:54.136 --> 05:04.228
a song you're the piano man sing us a song tonight well we're all in the mood for a melody

05:23.235 --> 05:37.935
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see To forget about life for a while

05:44.949 --> 05:54.781
And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, man, what are you doing?

06:11.326 --> 06:23.984
Piano man, sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you got us feeling all right

06:45.500 --> 06:52.567
a test that could detect a virus when the virus wasn't present.

06:53.187 --> 07:00.594
And in addition to that, he didn't have virus, coronavirus, COVID-19 to work with, right?

07:00.915 --> 07:05.399
He was drawing the sequencing from a computer database.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.660
Is all of that correct?

07:07.953 --> 07:21.241
Yes, only I would say he had an intention to pick up the virus when it was present, but in his design, he admitted that he couldn't do a very good job with imperfect information and it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

07:21.521 --> 07:24.423
And that it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

07:24.743 --> 07:31.948
And when you say pick up, meaning the test would indicate, return a positive if there were other coronaviruses.

07:32.028 --> 07:34.029
And for the lay person, I didn't know this either,

07:34.545 --> 07:35.745
Everything is a coronavirus.

07:35.826 --> 07:41.207
I mean, things, I don't mean, many cold viruses are also called coronavirus.

07:41.247 --> 07:51.851
In fact, COVID-19, it sounded so exotic and scary when we first learned about it, coronavirus, but many, many ordinary cold viruses are coronaviruses.

07:52.211 --> 07:52.972
Is that correct?

07:53.092 --> 07:53.432
It's correct.

08:08.843 --> 08:10.404
I think truth is good for kids.

08:10.825 --> 08:14.628
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.769
We want everybody to feel good.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.131
That's not, that's not the way life is.

08:21.693 --> 08:25.617
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

08:27.418 --> 08:28.139
And I have lied.

08:28.319 --> 08:29.199
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:29.219 --> 08:30.140
I don't want to lie.

08:30.621 --> 08:31.982
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.123
I try not to be a liar.

08:33.143 --> 08:34.003
I don't want to be a liar.

08:34.564 --> 08:37.286
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

08:39.577 --> 08:59.737
introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:59.757 --> 09:04.201
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

09:05.060 --> 09:09.362
channel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

09:13.225 --> 09:26.132
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

09:26.232 --> 09:31.755
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

09:32.055 --> 09:33.996
It's just a big hassle in the end.

09:35.993 --> 10:04.615
know when when we have this new pandemic that is you know got 75 percent mortality and uh it it's not it's there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be and i'm afraid that the latest data is literally turning into a worst case scenario i'm afraid it's literally turning into a worst case scenario

10:06.806 --> 10:09.948
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

10:10.428 --> 10:12.229
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

10:14.230 --> 10:15.011
Isolation, what was it?

10:15.151 --> 10:16.391
Isolation and purification.

10:18.092 --> 10:18.833
Of the virus?

10:18.913 --> 10:19.133
Yes.

10:20.374 --> 10:22.135
Well, you isolate a virus by

10:28.934 --> 10:31.416
finding the virus which causes a disease.

10:32.057 --> 10:36.941
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

10:37.742 --> 10:40.044
I don't understand what the issue is.

10:40.264 --> 10:47.570
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

10:48.011 --> 10:49.292
Okay.

10:49.432 --> 10:51.854
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

10:54.377 --> 10:56.321
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

10:56.341 --> 11:02.452
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

11:02.532 --> 11:04.556
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

11:10.454 --> 11:10.875
The End

12:22.435 --> 12:32.802
I've been talking over the ABC Aussie News intro and nobody could hear me because my sound guy is me and I've got very good at it.

12:32.842 --> 12:34.183
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

12:34.243 --> 12:35.204
Welcome to the show.

12:35.224 --> 12:37.625
This is definitely GigaOM Biological.

12:38.446 --> 12:39.667
Misha in the chat.

12:39.707 --> 12:44.730
I've never said hello to you but you always put two flames and a bike there and I've seen you a lot.

12:44.790 --> 12:45.251
Hello.

12:45.911 --> 12:46.251
Ahem.

12:46.992 --> 12:47.392
Ahem.

12:47.972 --> 12:48.493
Excuse me.

12:50.219 --> 12:53.140
We are definitely in interesting times, ladies and gentlemen.

12:53.200 --> 12:58.301
Definitely in interesting times, so let's enjoy them.

13:00.962 --> 13:12.306
Let's tend the garden that is our consciousness and pull the weeds out whenever we need to and whenever we have time to because they're putting all kinds of weeds in our head all of the time.

13:13.248 --> 13:19.032
in hopes that what we perceive to be true is not close enough to the truth for us to escape.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.035
That's what this prime real estate thing is all about.

13:22.055 --> 13:24.837
I'm not really sure what it is about us that does that.

13:24.877 --> 13:26.458
I mean, it's our social nature.

13:27.119 --> 13:35.024
I'm sure there are lots of animals that are susceptible to their fellow animals, their fellow conspecifics is the word.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.607
Ladies and gentlemen, there was no spread in New York City.

13:38.627 --> 13:40.308
Infectious clones are the only real threat.

13:40.328 --> 13:44.970
Placebo batches were likely distributed and transfection in healthy mammals is dumb.

13:46.151 --> 13:47.932
The protocols were definitely murder.

13:48.452 --> 13:57.037
Gain of Function is a mythology that they would love for you to teach your children and the Scooby-Doo mystery is still being solved live on social media.

13:57.638 --> 13:58.958
It's breathtaking.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.241
A spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.862
Some of these people just don't get it.

14:06.010 --> 14:13.200
Some of these people are so compartmentalized in their comfort, and then their success, and their perceived rise.

14:13.801 --> 14:20.049
You know, when I started as a little tiny YouTube channel at the beginning of the pandemic, now I got like 25,000 followers.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.072
So I must be doing something right.

14:24.946 --> 14:30.868
Ladies and gentlemen, weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about the origins of the novel virus.

14:30.948 --> 14:43.292
Participating in the argument accepts the premise of the novel virus by default, and we are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms and includes all sides of the mythology.

14:44.732 --> 14:50.114
Yes, all of your heroes are not real.

14:50.614 --> 14:51.914
I know, it's a bad message.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.595
Everybody hates my message, but

14:54.560 --> 15:03.686
If you just look at how none of these people are talking about what I'm saying biologically anymore, none of them have anything to say about the three main points.

15:05.907 --> 15:07.128
It's pretty extraordinary.

15:07.148 --> 15:23.378
You know, I'm the only one, actually, if you look at what these weaponized piles of money have managed to do, I'm the only one that got all five of the no-virus all-stars on the same stream, and they did a whole hour just dedicated to me.

15:24.338 --> 15:29.760
And I'm the only one who got Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:29.880 --> 15:34.621
and Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose together for a presentation.

15:34.661 --> 15:35.301
Who else did?

15:36.021 --> 15:47.084
And who else got John Bodwin and Stephanie Seneff and Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and Jonathan Cui together?

15:47.245 --> 15:51.806
Who's the only one that these all-star teams are assembled for?

15:52.606 --> 15:54.047
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

15:54.067 --> 15:58.910
I'm sorry to tell you, but it is definitely... It's definitely the host of this show.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.631
And that should tell you something.

16:02.672 --> 16:14.079
Because nobody's gotten all those people together to talk to Jessica Rose or to... It's interesting, ladies and gentlemen.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.260
I think you gotta see it for what it is.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.282
These charlatans have gotten a definite...

16:21.980 --> 16:23.021
Is it yesterday's title?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.402
I don't think it's yesterday's title.

16:24.422 --> 16:25.283
I thought I changed it.

16:25.323 --> 16:26.184
Did I not change it?

16:26.204 --> 16:27.585
Do I need to go?

16:28.146 --> 16:29.207
Maybe I didn't hit done.

16:29.347 --> 16:29.768
I don't know.

16:30.008 --> 16:30.929
Maybe it didn't update.

16:30.989 --> 16:31.669
Sorry about that.

16:33.311 --> 16:38.376
Yes, once you give charlatans power over you, you almost never ever get it back.

16:38.977 --> 16:39.957
It's a big problem.

16:40.078 --> 16:41.019
It's a big problem.

16:43.141 --> 16:46.344
If we're gonna make gentle the light of this world, I'm just gonna move this backwards a little bit.

16:47.728 --> 16:54.911
If we're gonna make gentle the life of this world, the life of our children going forward, I'm spitting apple all over my notebook.

16:56.032 --> 17:12.760
If we're gonna make gentle the life of our children as they go forward and we break them from this mythology, we're gonna have to move forward very carefully, show them what social media is so that they can see it for the artificial consensus that it is.

17:14.093 --> 17:17.736
And once they can see social media for what it is, it'll be a lot less dangerous.

17:17.816 --> 17:18.757
It's still dangerous.

17:19.397 --> 17:23.241
Especially for kids that aren't particularly clever.

17:25.302 --> 17:28.445
It's also dangerous for adults that aren't particularly clever.

17:28.485 --> 17:32.048
And even if you have a surfboard, some people just aren't ever gonna do it, right?

17:33.089 --> 17:35.391
And so, that's part of the problem here.

17:35.911 --> 17:37.833
Not everybody can be saved from this wave.

17:37.893 --> 17:40.195
Not everybody's gonna be able to swim in these waters.

17:41.152 --> 17:59.363
But we've got to get as many people that have the potential aware and swimming and eventually up on a surfboard so that we can all get to shore safely and excise our kids from this by staying focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and loving our neighbors.

18:00.524 --> 18:06.528
This is a special message, of course, always coming from America to Americans, because that's what I am.

18:06.608 --> 18:07.288
I'm an American.

18:09.076 --> 18:28.654
born and raised, and my dad's a tall white guy, my mom's from the Philippines, but it's the Philippines with Indian in there, and so it's like, and not American Indian, and so I got a very interesting past, heritage, whatever you call it, so I don't fit into any boxes.

18:30.104 --> 18:54.495
I'm just an American and so if you want to spread the word about this stream about America put together by an American Please do it spread the word because that's how this works people find this stream because people share it and If you keep doing that share this the the shorts from Jeff from Jeff from earth that's it who's in the chat there and

18:56.707 --> 19:00.435
Yeah, anyway, this is Giga Giga Giga Ohm Biological.

19:01.537 --> 19:03.441
And I'm very excited to be here today.

19:03.481 --> 19:06.386
I'm going to take a couple more bites of this apple and I think we'll be ready to go.

19:36.334 --> 19:38.315
Can anybody else feel it shifting?

19:39.195 --> 19:40.796
Twitter is like useless now.

19:40.816 --> 19:43.176
I don't really see it being useful anymore.

19:43.597 --> 19:48.458
Probably the main thing I'm going to use it for going forward is telling you what time I'm going to come on.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.619
Because it's pretty dumb at this point.

19:54.193 --> 20:05.418
Anyway, if we pull ourselves away from places like Twitter, you're essentially taking one more hand away from your eyes and getting closer to engaging in real, united non-compliance.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.179
But we gotta understand the illusion.

20:07.879 --> 20:09.380
We gotta understand how we got here.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.522
And that might mean that we need to interact with Twitter a little longer.

20:13.462 --> 20:23.485
to understand how these anonymous accounts are being used by our heroes to make it seem like people are responding to them, or arguing with them, or fighting against them.

20:24.005 --> 20:32.788
And so, it just never ceases to amaze me how... how I should have done known better.

20:32.848 --> 20:35.088
I should have known... I should have known better.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.589
Anyway, I'm gonna get to it in a second.

20:36.629 --> 20:38.269
Thanks, this is GigaOM Biological.

20:38.289 --> 20:39.870
I'm really happy to be here today.

20:42.558 --> 20:42.758
So,

21:14.397 --> 21:22.423
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

21:23.124 --> 21:24.285
It is the 8th of July, 2024.

21:24.325 --> 21:35.113
I don't have my black scrubs on, so you can't really tell who I am, so I thought I'd put my badge on, but I am the chief biologist of GigaOM Biological.

21:36.514 --> 21:36.875
I don't know.

21:36.895 --> 21:52.915
I feel like at this point it's really important to realize that I wear black scrubs to make fun of all these people and I now am wearing a badge to make fun of all these people because unlike people that are claiming to be experts in

21:53.476 --> 22:15.629
prionogenesis or amyloidogenesis or experts in analyzing data and therefore they can look at VAERS for four years straight or being polymaths that are really highly trained in bioethics, I'm wearing a badge that says chief biologist and the name of my LLC on it.

22:15.689 --> 22:18.911
So from the perspective of my own little business here,

22:20.029 --> 22:23.813
and how my family makes a living, this badge is pretty legitimate.

22:23.873 --> 22:33.102
Now, given the fact that I also have a PhD in neurobiology, that's also not bad qualifications for being the chief biologist of a small consulting firm.

22:33.543 --> 22:43.653
And so I'll just sit here and make sure, you know, that I'm flaunting the same kind of, you know, silly credentials that a lot of these other people are flaunting from behind a microphone.

22:44.453 --> 22:53.461
However, I would like to point out that again, my path through this little theater, I'm human just like you.

22:54.321 --> 23:02.088
And I've been fooled by a lot of liars because it's easy to believe liars when three of them lie to you together.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.290
Like if you go on a podcast with three of them,

23:04.930 --> 23:09.852
Or when five of them go on a podcast together to lie about you and your ideas.

23:10.412 --> 23:15.253
Or when three or four people get together and two or three of them are lying.

23:16.494 --> 23:24.356
It's happened to me at least three or four times with some of the all-stars of this narrative, and I don't think anyone else can say that that's happened to them.

23:25.851 --> 23:49.415
Now, I don't know if that's a sign that everybody doesn't like me, or if it's a sign that everybody doesn't understand me, or if it's just the sign that everybody is a liar, but I'm pretty sure my gut feeling is, given all the things that I've seen and read behind the scenes, how many voicemails I've gotten, how many phone calls I've gotten from these people, and all the things that they've said,

23:50.578 --> 24:05.525
The reason why I've been on all of those shows with all of those people but then all of those people just forget me as quick as they see me is because they don't want to discuss the idea that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

24:06.618 --> 24:15.040
They don't want to have a discussion about the fact that any academic biologist worth their salt before the pandemic would have known what transformation and transfection meant.

24:15.721 --> 24:29.185
Even if there's some debate about whether Cooey is right and transformation is DNA and transfection is RNA, maybe transformation has to do specifically with using viral vectors and retroviruses, whereas transfection can be transformed

24:30.985 --> 24:36.788
Transfection can be with DNA or RNA if you use a lipid nanoparticle or electroporation.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.749
So he doesn't know what he's talking about.

24:40.831 --> 24:45.173
The bottom line is, is that all of them knew that transfection was dumb and healthy kids.

24:45.613 --> 24:50.636
Would have been dumb and a healthy elderly person that you wanted to live for another 10 years.

24:52.477 --> 24:59.481
And yet we were coerced by murder in the United States and lies about murder in the United States.

25:00.626 --> 25:11.010
We were coerced so that we would encourage or not discourage the elderly people in our lives from taking these shots, and most of them did.

25:12.451 --> 25:25.556
But worse yet, we were not able, many of us were not able to discourage the young people in our lives from taking these shots, the 30-year-olds, the 40-year-olds, the 20-year-olds that went back to college.

25:26.296 --> 25:27.377
We let them go back.

25:29.127 --> 25:32.229
Nobody wants to talk about what happened in 2020 in the fall.

25:35.112 --> 25:39.995
Because if you do, you will find out who had principles and who didn't, who spoke out early enough and who didn't.

25:40.636 --> 25:42.017
That was when we could have saved them.

25:42.677 --> 25:51.905
When Richard Ebright said that if we open the colleges without any kind of regulation, 250,000 people will be dead by Christmas.

25:52.225 --> 25:53.526
Richard Ebright said that.

25:57.793 --> 26:00.775
They don't want to discuss the fact that RNA can't pandemic.

26:00.795 --> 26:04.837
There's no real biological basis for this idea.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.002
And so they attribute bad motives to me.

26:12.102 --> 26:19.647
They don't want to adopt any kind of real explanation, overarching explanation that can help everybody understand what happened.

26:22.025 --> 26:31.227
They don't wanna talk about how weaponized piles of money, they don't even wanna talk about what a weaponized pile of money might mean and how useful of an umbrella term that might be.

26:33.328 --> 26:37.889
But weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about the origins of the novel virus.

26:38.109 --> 26:38.889
I was there.

26:39.949 --> 26:48.691
I was thrown out of the group drastic on Twitter in late 2020 because I wanted them to pivot to warning people that transfection was a terrible idea.

26:53.581 --> 27:01.238
The group actually fractured into two groups, drastic and drastic science for like a year and a half because of that same little debate.

27:04.517 --> 27:09.802
Participating in that argument is what made us all accept the novel virus, and they all knew that.

27:09.862 --> 27:28.179
That's why DRASTIC was formed in the first place, to make sure that the narrative of the novel virus could be controlled, and anybody that needed to be made feel like they were a hero could be put in that little DM group, get invited in, and then listened and read to all those spooks that were talking about all the clues they were finding.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.780
was like a great big Scooby-Doo unfolding right before my eyes.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.081
Oh, wow, that looks like a good clue.

27:34.101 --> 27:35.282
Oh, wow, that looks like a good clue.

27:37.103 --> 27:39.325
And I'm in a DM group, so not everybody sees it.

27:39.345 --> 27:44.228
So I know from where these tweets are coming from behind the scenes, and it feels like I'm an insider.

27:50.893 --> 27:52.374
And it's just, it's annoying.

27:54.690 --> 28:00.014
because it's like I have seen an alien and I can't explain it well enough for people to believe it.

28:01.815 --> 28:16.306
But Twitter was used as a lying machine, a coordinated web of liars and anonymous accounts that were run by the same people so that their lies could be even more succinctly coordinated.

28:18.888 --> 28:22.431
And because Twitter has risen to such popularity,

28:23.783 --> 28:32.926
We are now being governed by a theater that extends to that platform, to the Facebook platform, to the Gab platform, the telegram platform.

28:33.546 --> 28:45.551
If you read a telegram platform or you read a large signal group, there's no, if you're, for example, in a signal group with 150 people, only two of them have to be real.

28:46.931 --> 28:48.952
You and the person who invited you in.

28:51.434 --> 28:57.617
If you're in a Slack group with 50 people, only two of them have to be real.

28:57.657 --> 28:59.798
The one that invited you in, and you.

29:01.379 --> 29:05.941
And yet, it's still, to this day, I can be fooled by this.

29:06.021 --> 29:14.865
I don't have this premise centered in my head when I approach social media until something sticks out like, oh wait, ow.

29:18.752 --> 29:22.474
And we must teach our children to see how this is done.

29:22.554 --> 29:31.438
This is the fifth generation warfare that Malone spent four years explaining to everybody around the world we'd never figure out because you can never know who's lying to you.

29:32.418 --> 29:33.899
It's because they're all lying to you.

29:35.566 --> 29:47.699
It is a coordinated group of people that pretend to be opposed, pretend to cooperate, pretend to argue, exactly as this guy said.

29:49.494 --> 30:01.880
It is a limited spectrum of debate being curated by somewhere between Geert van den Bosch and Children's Health Defense and the Brownstone and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch.

30:01.920 --> 30:09.004
And if you believe all of these people and listen to their arguments, you're stuck in the exact hog trap they want you to be stuck in.

30:14.606 --> 30:17.968
And the only alternatives are, you know, there's no viruses at all.

30:20.360 --> 30:25.122
And you're very quickly into very dangerous, discreditable ground.

30:25.222 --> 30:29.663
Discreditable, right?

30:30.943 --> 30:31.144
Yes.

30:32.184 --> 30:32.564
I don't know.

30:32.984 --> 30:35.285
You can be discredited very easily.

30:36.898 --> 30:42.461
Or people can feel as though they can discredit you very easily.

30:42.501 --> 30:46.584
And so then the position is very hard to take if you don't have the nuance necessary.

30:47.064 --> 30:49.165
And then the other one is, of course, natural virus.

30:49.265 --> 30:53.147
And so we are in the trap right now.

30:53.527 --> 30:58.730
And if we can't explain it succinctly to people, it is possible we could get out.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.332
The truth can set us free.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.274
But the truth is so in our face,

31:06.937 --> 31:09.378
When you go on YouTube, it's the entire screen.

31:10.618 --> 31:15.879
And the better that the thumbnails match, the more likely it is that they are part of the illusion.

31:15.939 --> 31:16.419
That's it.

31:17.559 --> 31:21.240
They are all part of the enchantment, whether they know it or not.

31:22.141 --> 31:28.042
There's no way to succeed on YouTube telling the truth, unless it's the truth about Legos.

31:33.203 --> 31:39.167
And there was never a way to succeed telling the truth in the newspaper for a very, very long time.

31:41.208 --> 31:44.270
And if you did, then you needed to be co-opted or you'd be gone.

31:48.692 --> 31:54.656
That's why this statement from the twenties is so poignant to think about that in the twenties, they were talking like this.

31:54.716 --> 31:55.697
They had no social media.

31:55.717 --> 31:57.418
They didn't have phones in people's pockets.

31:57.458 --> 32:02.601
They didn't have people in front of screens and, and, and TVs that had cameras that could see them.

32:05.609 --> 32:12.872
They didn't have people giving up their most intimate thoughts on private chats in Twitter and elsewhere.

32:15.373 --> 32:15.893
Now they do.

32:15.913 --> 32:22.455
If you're teenagers on Snapchat talking to his friends, then what's happening there?

32:22.955 --> 32:24.016
What are they talking about?

32:28.097 --> 32:30.198
They put these people in place very early.

32:31.823 --> 32:34.826
Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project was one of them.

32:34.926 --> 32:35.346
Why?

32:35.426 --> 32:37.428
Well, you should watch Housatonic Live.

32:37.488 --> 32:40.991
I think he's got some really good output lately.

32:42.813 --> 32:47.938
I think it's very, very interesting how every time he opens the book on the Barr family, something crazy falls out.

32:52.365 --> 32:54.526
And I don't know what to say.

32:55.326 --> 33:00.048
Bill Barr is the guy who prevented the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death.

33:00.208 --> 33:05.990
And that somehow or another, all these people that are fanatics about that story don't seem to say much about that.

33:06.070 --> 33:11.092
I'm curious, I got the books back there of Whitney Webb.

33:11.132 --> 33:16.174
I wonder if I could look up the Barr family in that book and see if there, does it have an index?

33:16.194 --> 33:17.414
I guess I could do that, right?

33:17.614 --> 33:18.614
I'm not gonna do that right now.

33:18.774 --> 33:20.235
I will do that though, that's a good idea.

33:21.457 --> 33:25.340
And so I think that he was put in place to mislead the young.

33:25.360 --> 33:30.204
That's why he was on so many podcasts so early.

33:30.224 --> 33:32.906
Oh, here they go.

33:32.966 --> 33:33.166
What?

33:34.487 --> 33:34.847
Okay.

33:38.522 --> 33:46.053
Shout out, if you're watching live from the airport in Detroit, hello, good to see you.

33:46.553 --> 33:48.036
Thank you for joining me live.

33:49.077 --> 33:50.559
It's good to see everybody there.

33:50.599 --> 33:51.520
I hope you're doing well.

33:52.562 --> 33:54.625
Don't eat too many French fries.

33:56.471 --> 34:06.937
anyway these people are misleading the young that's what they're doing that's what they did on twitter that's why so many of these people have emerged as heroes now in 2024 in the fifth year of this exercise

34:09.790 --> 34:22.234
people that were in contact with me very early in 2021 already talking to me, even actually in 2020, talking to me about what the correct biology was.

34:22.394 --> 34:29.356
And I was teaching people about T-cells and about memory and what memories would be the most pertinent.

34:30.396 --> 34:33.719
and also teaching people what transfection was and the definition of it.

34:33.779 --> 34:36.180
And one of those people was Brett Weinstein.

34:36.240 --> 34:50.471
Another one was Heather, who were both in that Signal Chat with Alexandros Marinos and Roller Gator and Matt Crawford was in that Signal Chat and Chris Martinson and a few other people.

34:52.879 --> 35:07.022
And that signal chat was where all these people learned the definition of the word transfection and from then on should have been calling it a transfection so that people would have to admit that this isn't an investigational vaccine.

35:08.203 --> 35:08.743
But they didn't.

35:09.444 --> 35:16.508
They admitted it on their stream a couple times, and they said my name a couple times, but they never actually changed their language about it.

35:16.988 --> 35:23.972
And they never did a program to explain that, or had me on to explain it, or anyone on to explain it.

35:24.552 --> 35:38.215
Even Robert Malone never explained it on their program, and so that's why I call them traitors, because if they would have explained it to college kids in even 2021, a lot of college kids might have even at least foregone their second shot.

35:39.955 --> 35:45.656
But nobody made any useful effort to stop anybody from taking it, certainly not anyone under the age of 40.

35:47.937 --> 35:48.877
And that's a crime.

35:49.637 --> 35:53.738
Those people are guilty of playing along with this, and you can't claim ignorance.

35:54.841 --> 35:57.422
These people can't claim ignorance because I was telling them.

35:58.202 --> 36:07.265
They can't claim ignorance because they're all aware of my review because I put that review out in May, but I was already writing it and had it ready to go almost in January.

36:08.805 --> 36:10.866
None of these people can claim they didn't know.

36:16.348 --> 36:22.590
And they certainly can't claim that they don't know that Gate of Function is a mythology because I've been telling them that for a really long time as well.

36:24.147 --> 36:27.531
I haven't been able to say it this well for more than a year and a half or so.

36:27.591 --> 36:35.240
I haven't known that Gain of Function was a mythology for more than a year and a half or so, so I'm not claiming to be some kind of superhero here.

36:37.062 --> 36:42.488
But one of the reasons why it took me so long to get there was because the no-virus people were so good at their job.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.444
And they still haven't been able to say it as well as I've been saying it for the last year and a half.

36:48.484 --> 37:09.883
And that's why they won't talk about these talking points, but instead want to talk about infectious clones and debate about infectious clones and the infectious cycle and whether or not, you know, there's competent particles or not, because those are all wonderful debates about the details that automatically accept the virus and the circulation of it.

37:13.732 --> 37:24.321
And so that's why I'm going to keep hammering on these tips, because if they don't want to talk about these three things, I mean, it's pretty easy, not very hard to get there, but that's not part of their goal.

37:24.361 --> 37:29.366
Their goal is to try and trick you into believing that before 2019, there was nothing.

37:29.406 --> 37:39.114
And then in 2019, there was something, and that something, you know, equals a pandemic and lockdowns worked because, you know, look at New Zealand and Australia, they had no deaths in 2020.

37:41.869 --> 37:44.510
And then here we are in 2024, five years later.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.191
Five years later.

37:48.291 --> 37:51.472
These people are the ones who created this illusion of consensus.

37:51.532 --> 37:52.252
It wasn't me.

37:52.892 --> 37:54.493
I was sucked into it like you were.

37:55.393 --> 37:56.473
And that's what they always do.

37:56.513 --> 37:59.174
They ask you to sing in the choir and then they put you in the back.

38:00.535 --> 38:02.035
Sing in the choir and then put you in the back.

38:02.075 --> 38:04.096
And in rehearsal, they let you sing really loud.

38:04.476 --> 38:08.957
They'll talk to you a lot and they'll listen to, they'll read your DMs and they'll answer your texts.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.498
Sometimes they'll even pick up the phone.

38:13.988 --> 38:19.911
But the illusion of consensus is created because only those people get invited to the Senate.

38:22.312 --> 38:34.999
And that worst case scenario is still living on right now, and all the people that say that this is an incapacitating agent, and all the people that say that it's bio warfare in the shot, all the people that are saying that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:35.039 --> 38:43.423
is gonna come to our rescue, and all the people who are asking whether or not they're putting graphene in us, are asking whether all of this is under their control.

38:44.824 --> 38:46.224
Are they just gonna kill us soon?

38:47.045 --> 38:48.085
Flip the kill switch?

38:49.806 --> 38:50.106
5G?

38:51.246 --> 38:51.586
Dead?

38:55.648 --> 38:56.948
Covid shots are bad.

38:57.028 --> 38:57.828
Don't talk about 2020.

38:58.268 --> 39:00.429
That's what everybody says.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.690
Nobody wants to talk about what they were saying in 2020 or 2021.

39:08.024 --> 39:12.386
Nobody wants to talk about it anymore because it still reveals malevolence.

39:13.106 --> 39:18.568
It reveals a lack of principles that they claim now to have had always, and they did not.

39:20.528 --> 39:22.629
It's important that everybody sees that.

39:24.330 --> 39:30.812
That you use the archive on the internet to go and find your heroes in 2020 and find out what they were doing.

39:34.471 --> 39:36.574
Or find out how they explain what they were doing.

39:36.634 --> 39:37.736
Some of them won't do that.

39:37.796 --> 39:38.657
Others maybe have.

39:40.921 --> 39:41.802
Doesn't matter though.

39:41.822 --> 39:45.287
This doesn't matter at all because the faith is a lie.

39:45.347 --> 39:47.951
This idea that an RNA can do this is a lie.

39:47.991 --> 39:50.435
There was a background signal and they said it was spreading.

39:51.997 --> 39:54.738
And this cartoon version is the easiest way to say it.

39:54.759 --> 40:20.252
If there's a signal that's composed of exosomes from us, and exosomes from your dog, and exosomes from your cats, and your chickens, and all the insects, and all the plants in the backyard, and there are bacteriophages that are floating around in the air, then when you swab the air, and you swab the bench, or you swab the dirt, or you swab your desk, or you swab your throat,

40:21.274 --> 40:30.942
You're swabbing a very diverse set of microorganisms and signals at that size scale.

40:32.443 --> 40:42.991
And then to claim that you can detect one particular signal on that background using a single PCR reaction with a single pair of primers, which is what that first two years is based on.

40:44.393 --> 40:50.938
And then to say that all those sequences that we're supposed to believe, well, all the sequencing for the first year was done by DITRA.

40:54.696 --> 41:05.104
And Kevin McKernan will have you say that, no, no, all those databases were all put together by everybody submitting sequences now because the Arctic primers are being used all over the world.

41:05.144 --> 41:17.274
Well, on a background signal of infinite RNA and DNA from all the organisms on the planet, then the Arctic primer set may just bring up a signal a lot of times, big deal.

41:21.693 --> 41:27.517
I think that these people are over-extending their hand.

41:28.278 --> 41:31.701
And it's the insistence on this that is most frightening.

41:31.901 --> 41:37.685
There's only a handful of experts that can hold a candle to Kevin McKernan.

41:38.846 --> 41:43.970
And so those experts are hard to find and hard to get them to weigh in on this.

41:44.010 --> 41:45.271
And in fact, none of them have.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.745
That's part of the problem that we have.

41:47.825 --> 41:51.926
The resident expert for the world right now is Kevin McKernan.

41:53.106 --> 42:04.050
On Twitter and at the Senate and for Children's Health Defense and everywhere else, this is the rock star that was put in place already and probably in March of 2020.

42:04.630 --> 42:06.831
I don't know, I haven't seen an earlier video of him.

42:07.987 --> 42:12.671
If you find an earlier video, the earliest video of him you can find in 2020 would be great.

42:13.132 --> 42:14.093
That's a new rule.

42:14.713 --> 42:25.143
Just find 2020 videos of these people and send them to me via email and you get, you get, you get some, some stars, maybe extra credit.

42:25.183 --> 42:27.445
I'm not really sure yet, but stars for sure.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.368
Why did that not sound?

42:32.890 --> 42:33.050
Hmm.

42:34.943 --> 42:38.425
I'm going to escape here because maybe we have a little memory problem.

42:38.985 --> 42:39.726
Current slide.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.347
There it is.

42:48.130 --> 42:54.553
So I use this analogy a lot, but I really think it's important again, you know, we got to tell this to people every night.

42:54.593 --> 43:00.577
You've been in the car with these people for a long time, and if you were in the back seat, and there's a driver,

43:01.861 --> 43:07.488
and his girlfriend, and their friend in the backseat, or her friend in the backseat.

43:09.330 --> 43:20.965
And you get picked up on the street, and they're giving you a ride, and they want to steal all your stuff, and they're gonna lie to you about it, and then leave you somewhere.

43:21.912 --> 43:26.413
They can tell you lots of different stories, which will get you to trust the person in the back seat.

43:27.254 --> 43:33.796
And then the two people in the front seat will get out at the fast food restaurant.

43:34.636 --> 43:36.937
And then you'll be left with the one person.

43:36.977 --> 43:42.078
And that one person will say something, tell you another story, and make you stay in the car.

43:42.599 --> 43:46.500
And then they'll call you from the fast food restaurant and tell you to come in and just leave your stuff in the car.

43:49.983 --> 43:53.724
And then very quickly they drive away before you realize what happened.

43:58.205 --> 44:00.705
Now this, this kind of thing is silly.

44:00.745 --> 44:18.589
Of course, it's a silly story, but if those three people wanted to get you to believe that they had just escaped an alien and they had something in the trunk that told you that they were just escaping an alien and they had all these stories worked out, it would be pretty convincing, right?

44:19.892 --> 44:28.435
What would be even more convincing, though, is if the passenger in the front seat, the one that's supposed to be the girlfriend of the driver, didn't believe them because she was asleep.

44:29.875 --> 44:37.738
And so now she's arguing that Jay's obviously the only rational one in the car besides me because you guys didn't see aliens.

44:37.778 --> 44:42.740
And then the other two are arguing, going crazy about the fact that they did see aliens.

44:43.502 --> 44:50.009
Now when those two people get out of the car and then you're left in the car with the girl in the front seat who says, oh my gosh, aren't they crazy?

44:50.049 --> 44:50.750
I can't believe it.

44:51.551 --> 44:52.812
Maybe we should make a run for it.

44:52.932 --> 44:54.133
Let's just take the car and run.

44:56.115 --> 45:02.983
Now you think you're leaving those two people and you're joining her on a run away from these crazy people who just saw the UFO.

45:03.483 --> 45:04.865
Now you trust her a lot.

45:07.011 --> 45:11.635
Now she drives down the road for a little while and picks up two more people, but those two people aren't random.

45:12.035 --> 45:13.637
They were waiting there the whole time.

45:15.638 --> 45:16.859
That's what Twitter is.

45:19.762 --> 45:22.364
And Twitter is that way all the time.

45:22.384 --> 45:23.485
Ooh, another stop.

45:23.505 --> 45:24.906
Ooh, new people in the car.

45:24.926 --> 45:25.887
Ooh, whoa, here we go.

45:25.927 --> 45:26.688
Ooh, ah, yeah.

45:28.345 --> 45:34.468
And every time new people come in the car, they had new ideas about the lab leak and new ideas about early treatment.

45:34.488 --> 45:36.188
And oh my gosh, I agree with that guy.

45:36.208 --> 45:36.929
Did you see him?

45:36.989 --> 45:38.749
Yeah, we met him at the last gas station.

45:38.829 --> 45:40.150
Oh my gosh, he's crazy.

45:43.451 --> 45:44.692
And so you can barely keep up.

45:44.732 --> 45:49.294
You're just sitting in the back seat, munching your french fries, going, holy man, this is the craziest car ride.

45:49.374 --> 45:52.015
I can't believe hitchhiking has led to this adventure.

45:55.016 --> 45:57.317
And the whole time, what's going on in the background?

46:05.069 --> 46:05.309
Right?

46:05.369 --> 46:06.809
That's what's going on in the background.

46:09.270 --> 46:21.233
Even though people are getting in and out of the car, even though the people are arguing and fighting and you're, you know, leaving people behind and whatever the, the agreement is with all these people that you're running from the same thing.

46:23.614 --> 46:28.815
And by the time this car ride is over, you're going to tell your kids, holy cow, you know, we were running from aliens.

46:28.975 --> 46:29.595
Can you believe it?

46:31.451 --> 46:37.713
I wouldn't have believed it myself, but you know, we got rid of these two guys, but then we met these other two guys on the street and they saw the alien too.

46:38.153 --> 46:40.574
So then the girl that was driving started believing it again.

46:40.614 --> 46:44.555
She wanted to turn around and go back and get her boyfriend, but we didn't have time because there were two.

46:51.477 --> 47:00.960
And that's why all of these people still won't talk about Sina Bavaria in his paper with Alison Totura, the last postdoc of

47:02.363 --> 47:11.305
I mean, they won't talk about David Hone and the intimate relationship he has with Robert Malone, because they couch surfed at each other's houses.

47:13.106 --> 47:14.706
He knows his ex-wife, you know.

47:16.507 --> 47:18.367
They won't talk about Stanley Plotkin.

47:20.228 --> 47:21.528
Won't talk about him at all.

47:21.688 --> 47:23.409
They won't talk about Hilary Koprowski.

47:23.449 --> 47:24.209
He's not interesting.

47:26.135 --> 47:33.086
They won't talk about the Barr family, even though Bill Barr is the guy who prevented an investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein thing.

47:33.126 --> 47:34.588
He was in the DOJ at that time.

47:34.628 --> 47:36.371
I mean, it's really weird.

47:36.531 --> 47:40.898
Nobody sees that as interesting, but Mark?

47:44.830 --> 47:47.812
And, you know, Joshua Lederberg, no one mentions him at all.

47:47.912 --> 47:54.835
I mean, they mentioned Peter Daszak, like he's some kind of smart guy, like he's some kind of mastermind.

47:55.536 --> 47:56.556
I mean, it's pathetic.

47:56.636 --> 47:57.257
It's sad.

47:57.637 --> 48:05.101
Why don't you just say Amy Maxim or Alina Chan or, you know, one of these other clear puppets?

48:09.582 --> 48:11.403
It's all a big show, ladies and gentlemen.

48:11.463 --> 48:13.905
Most of the opposition on the internet is just a big show.

48:13.945 --> 48:16.507
Look at this crazy stuff that happened a few minutes ago.

48:18.968 --> 48:33.578
Vajon Health just put out a new video and underneath it, he tweets, thank you for discussing the string theory about abnormal clots at JJ Cooey and at Lasky Eye Center.

48:36.687 --> 48:38.448
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it.

48:38.609 --> 48:46.054
Is this a nudge to try and get me to make friends with Joe Lee again and take him off of my screen down here?

48:46.114 --> 48:48.736
No, Joe Lee's right there.

48:49.156 --> 48:53.459
He fits in just fine right there, Mr. Joe Lee with his all gray background.

48:53.519 --> 48:54.900
It's perfect right there.

48:55.441 --> 48:59.004
I will leave him and his string theory right there.

49:00.164 --> 49:09.753
It's really interesting because, again, I think tonight I'm going to spend some extra time on Robert Malone because I just really am curious about him.

49:10.754 --> 49:14.017
He's a red thread running through this for many decades.

49:16.195 --> 49:23.484
I wanted to go over what we did in the first half of this video because I'm going to watch the second half of the same video we started a couple days ago.

49:23.504 --> 49:30.613
I wanted to go through this list again because yesterday's show I had it in red outline with black center.

49:31.434 --> 49:34.316
When I watch it on my phone, I'm kind of like, wow, you're a dork.

49:34.696 --> 49:35.497
Use different colors.

49:35.997 --> 49:39.700
So number one, Robert Malone worked on retroviruses.

49:40.020 --> 49:50.447
And that's important to understand because retroviruses are simply RNA viruses with a reverse transcriptase enzyme inside of them.

49:52.168 --> 50:08.426
They are not, repeat, as far as I understand, I could be wrong, you know, there might be a virologist in the audience who'll bark me for this, but retroviruses are RNA viruses with the enzyme reverse transcriptase.

50:08.546 --> 50:08.666
They

50:09.787 --> 50:18.655
They are not RNA viruses that go into the cell and translate into reverse transcriptase and then do that.

50:18.875 --> 50:20.036
That's very different, right?

50:20.076 --> 50:21.698
Coronaviruses are an RNA.

50:22.439 --> 50:30.906
And then the story that they tell us is they go into our cells and they make the proteins that are necessary for them to copy their own RNA.

50:31.427 --> 50:36.031
The RNA dependent RNA polymerase and this helicase and a couple other things.

50:36.909 --> 50:58.413
Now, the curious story about retroviruses, because of the fact that David Baltimore found this enzyme, reverse transcriptase, which turns RNA into DNA, it's very curious that that enzyme needs to be packaged with the RNA in order for a retrovirus to be replication competent.

51:00.638 --> 51:08.842
I want you to think about that again because that means that a protein needs to be made correctly and then put in the same package as the RNA.

51:09.382 --> 51:15.025
And that they tell you that the retroviruses are hijacking our own cells machinery to do that.

51:15.646 --> 51:17.427
That our own cells would never do that.

51:18.247 --> 51:22.729
Our own cells just do DNA, RNA through a ribosome to protein and that's it.

51:24.050 --> 51:25.951
But these viruses are able to come in

51:27.759 --> 51:39.896
And even though they need to carry this protein, flu also needs to carry the protein, believe it or not, which makes it a very interesting example of this transmission.

51:41.338 --> 51:42.579
They need to carry the protein.

51:42.620 --> 51:49.686
And so it's also an interesting thing to think about, can they go into a flu culture, like a flu virus culture?

51:49.746 --> 51:58.575
Can they go in there and break that up and then distill out the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.536
Because it has to have an enzyme in it.

52:00.997 --> 52:03.699
They're a negative strand RNA.

52:03.719 --> 52:05.441
So they have to have their own enzyme there.

52:05.501 --> 52:06.342
They can't be red.

52:07.737 --> 52:11.438
And so the cartoon of flu virus is very different than coronavirus.

52:12.038 --> 52:21.180
All of this stuff goes back to retroviruses, which are the first really interesting virus because David Baltimore gets a Nobel Prize for it.

52:21.540 --> 52:29.542
And then Bob Gallo gets a pretty big award for it, not quite as big as Luc Montagnier for finding the retrovirus HIV.

52:30.422 --> 52:35.007
And then there's also this thing with XMRV and, and Judy Mikovits.

52:35.427 --> 52:43.735
And then there's this curious thing of Robert Malone saying that in his postdoc, he worked on, uh, investigated packaging sequences.

52:43.796 --> 52:49.361
So the sequences of RNA in retroviruses, which governed the packaging.

52:50.222 --> 52:53.986
So not necessarily the packaging of, of

52:57.014 --> 53:01.423
reverse transcriptase, so that enzyme in there, but just the packaging of RNA.

53:01.483 --> 53:05.891
He's looking for the sequences that will get those RNAs packaged.

53:08.137 --> 53:09.758
because the idea is what?

53:09.878 --> 53:17.002
It's he, they want to use retroviruses to rearrange, to reorganize, to reprogram, to fix the human genome.

53:17.702 --> 53:25.847
And he said in that video that he thought that in 10 years there would be a geneticist at every hospital curing childhood diseases with retroviruses.

53:25.887 --> 53:28.128
So that's why he had a passion for it.

53:28.528 --> 53:36.813
It was, it was such a crazy cutthroat place, um, that they put multiple postdocs on the same question and whoever won, won and everybody else lost.

53:38.268 --> 53:41.650
It was so cutthroat that he got a diagnosis of PTSD.

53:42.470 --> 53:46.652
And he told a reporter that it felt a lot like rape.

53:50.454 --> 54:07.863
And now he's worked for DITRA, he's worked for DOD, he's worked for the WHO, he's done NIH study sections, he's a clinical trial specialist or a clinical development specialist and a bioethics expert and a hundred other things it seems.

54:09.275 --> 54:14.681
But he won't touch Judy Mikovits because they descend from the same basic group of people.

54:15.843 --> 54:17.925
Retroviral virologists.

54:19.707 --> 54:20.809
He's a virologist.

54:25.973 --> 54:29.736
And so he worked at Solvay with Geert van den Bosch.

54:29.816 --> 54:39.504
Yesterday's stream on Twitch seems to cut Geert's name out when I said this, but he definitely worked with Geert van den Bosch at the Solvay.

54:40.024 --> 54:46.489
And he also did a COVID movie with Geert van den Bosch, where he's wearing a black taxi cab hat.

54:46.789 --> 54:52.414
And it's pretty ridiculous because there's drone footage of them walking in the mountains of Spain.

54:54.062 --> 55:06.335
And again, I can't encourage you enough to go to housatonicits.com and look at the links for Malone and all the other people that you can find on that website and figure out what you didn't know.

55:07.356 --> 55:08.016
Please do that.

55:08.277 --> 55:08.937
Do that soon.

55:09.978 --> 55:16.725
So yesterday we did look at, again, a little bit of Vajon and a little bit of Gert and then we also looked at

55:18.363 --> 55:22.126
at Paul Offit, but we also looked at Jimmy Dore.

55:22.727 --> 55:30.193
Jimmy Dore also had a very interesting crossover with some Australian or UK guys.

55:30.233 --> 55:31.154
I think it's UK guys.

55:31.174 --> 55:31.454
I don't know.

55:31.514 --> 55:32.995
I don't recognize any of those accents.

55:35.477 --> 55:44.225
I think it's really interesting now that the current debate, I know you've seen these slides before, but if you weren't here the other night, so you missed some of this stuff, I like to cover it again.

55:45.124 --> 56:08.053
I think it's really interesting that the sides of this debate now with regard to avian flu are actually being bookended by the Brownstone and CHD on one side, who are promoting one another's articles quite regularly now and telling a story about a fire department that was so bored they decided to make new ways of making bad fires.

56:08.673 --> 56:10.354
And then one of those ways got out.

56:13.772 --> 56:32.901
I'm sorry, but it is very, very sad because I really did believe when I got hired by Brian Hooker and CHD that I was going to be able to make a huge difference, that I would be able to teach biology for them, that maybe they would give me my own show or what, I don't know what would happen there, but that's not at all what happened.

56:34.021 --> 56:49.952
And now you can see why, because as I was trying to temper their language about gain of function and try to get them to start talking about and questioning the validity of that claim, I don't know, I got tossed for talking about Robert Malone.

56:50.845 --> 57:05.697
And Robert Malone, since he's so crucial to understanding why it is that CHD couldn't handle having me as a biologist, I think it's really important to understand that on the other side of this bookend is Robert Malone's substack where he talks about all the

57:06.737 --> 57:22.306
the natural things about the biology of flu, and how often it's been there, and how we study it, and it's not likely to enter the food supply, and $200 million is gonna be spent on an influenza vaccine.

57:22.746 --> 57:30.471
Not much different than what Meryl Nass did a couple weeks ago, where she just told us that there's three vaccines in development, and it's scary, scary, scary.

57:33.851 --> 57:39.554
But she's not questioning the actual narrative as to whether these things are really spreading like they claim or not.

57:40.015 --> 57:45.678
Whether the fidelity of detection and fidelity of tracking that they claim is real or not.

57:45.738 --> 57:48.760
Instead, she's just telling you, yeah, here comes some more shots.

57:51.662 --> 57:58.325
And so if you don't believe CHD, then you won't believe her because her message hasn't changed and she won't talk about what she was doing in 2020.

58:01.610 --> 58:14.401
I suspect that if somebody wants to do something really nice for me, they could go look for the Defender podcast where I believe that Meryl Nass and others talked to the no virus people before I was ever working there.

58:14.421 --> 58:17.443
It might've even been before I was even working for Bobby.

58:17.764 --> 58:19.365
It might've been pre-2022.

58:20.686 --> 58:29.774
And if you can find that video, please send me a link because I suspect that that video will reveal an awful lot about both sides of that debate.

58:30.464 --> 58:32.265
So here we are, COVID shots are bad.

58:32.325 --> 58:32.966
Don't talk about 2020.

58:33.306 --> 58:34.466
That's really the trick.

58:34.526 --> 58:39.690
If there was a background signal and they're misconstruing it as spread, that's all that's required at this point.

58:39.710 --> 58:46.333
That's why it feels like they're a little bit, it feels like they're running out the clock because they kind of are.

58:46.854 --> 58:54.358
The farther we get from 2020, the less likely it is that people are going to be able to see it with the clarity necessary to understand the impact it had.

58:55.039 --> 58:57.580
That 2020 is the reason why, oh, it should be 2021.

58:57.620 --> 58:57.740
Sorry.

59:04.555 --> 59:08.136
Um, and, and do I have that right in the, in the title here?

59:08.156 --> 59:08.837
I got to change that.

59:08.877 --> 59:09.137
No, no.

59:09.197 --> 59:09.657
It's also 2020.

59:10.317 --> 59:10.557
Shoot.

59:10.617 --> 59:11.177
That's too bad.

59:11.898 --> 59:13.258
Um, this is 2021.

59:13.658 --> 59:15.079
Um, it's June, 2021.

59:15.139 --> 59:19.700
It's two weeks before, um, I can probably update it here.

59:20.701 --> 59:21.741
I don't know if it'll do it though.

59:24.842 --> 59:24.942
Um,

59:30.109 --> 59:37.953
It is 2021, it's June, it's two weeks before he goes on the Bret Weinstein podcast to make a fool of himself and Steve Kirsch.

59:38.954 --> 59:41.175
But that's okay, and Bret Weinstein, that's okay.

59:41.195 --> 59:43.316
What they did was, it's an admission at this stage.

59:43.337 --> 59:46.919
When you look back on it and you see what they did, you can't see it any other way.

59:46.979 --> 59:48.359
They weren't trying to find a way out.

59:48.419 --> 59:49.820
They weren't trying to tell us the truth.

59:50.260 --> 59:51.921
They had a script and they stuck to it.

59:51.961 --> 59:54.523
They had talking points and they were excited to stick to them.

59:55.163 --> 59:55.984
And it's gross.

59:56.837 --> 59:59.640
And when you look back at those people, they weren't struggling to figure it out.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.002
They weren't acting like they'd seen an alien.

01:00:03.303 --> 01:00:05.225
People are using this term, duper's delight.

01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:12.252
I'm not even sure that that applies here, but they looked like they were happy to do the act.

01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:15.696
They were happy to perform the act.

01:00:15.796 --> 01:00:20.180
The least excited in that trio was Robert Malone.

01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:32.967
And the reason why is because he knows that they are defining a limited spectrum of debate, which will basically go on to be used to govern the globe for a few years.

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:34.668
And so they better get it right.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.592
So let's bring this up here, put this video wide.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:43.893
And remember,

01:00:48.894 --> 01:00:55.417
I'm starting it right here where he talks about the rape and then we'll go on from here I won't interrupt unless we get to a new spot.

01:00:55.597 --> 01:00:56.857
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:00:56.897 --> 01:01:17.405
It's one hour in I've got a lot of a lot of gas in the tank So if you're if you're hanging around or you just join me don't think it's gonna end soon Um, so just to get that The feeling um, so Francis Delia of Heidi news was the one that first contacted me from the press about this whole situation and um

01:01:18.314 --> 01:01:22.135
And from the heart, what I said to him was, it feels like rape.

01:01:22.835 --> 01:01:23.936
And I know that's a strong word.

01:01:25.016 --> 01:01:30.938
But what I was trying to express is it feels like something that I have created.

01:01:31.678 --> 01:01:43.162
And with my own passion and effort, I mean, I work tirelessly, is being taken from me completely without anything, being taken by others.

01:01:44.302 --> 01:01:47.363
And that's pretty rough.

01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:52.787
In academe, there's rules about citing citations.

01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:53.187
You know that.

01:01:53.227 --> 01:01:54.488
You're an academic and you publish also.

01:01:54.948 --> 01:02:04.010
And it's probably pretty important to you, as it is to me, in this small, strange world of academic research and publications, that people acknowledge your intellectual contributions.

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:11.232
And I'm sure you, like me, are rigorous about acknowledging the, you know, the best metaphor is we all stand on the shoulders of giants.

01:02:12.012 --> 01:02:20.198
And I think it's important to acknowledge those that have contributed to this song that we all sing together, that have come before us and are our peers.

01:02:20.739 --> 01:02:31.046
And to have that kind of taken away and others seeking to advance their own agendas without even acknowledgement is a little rough.

01:02:32.107 --> 01:02:34.829
And so how does it feel?

01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.710
It hurts a lot.

01:02:38.186 --> 01:02:44.349
You know, the quote, I think it's from the Outlander, you know, it ain't right, it ain't proper.

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:46.891
And I think we all know that, right?

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:53.854
Intuitively, but science and academic science is a strangely competitive world that's very much a pyramid.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:03.387
So it's a personal commitment on my part to make sure that everybody that is in my world gets credited for their contributions.

01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:07.591
And I guess I kind of expect the same from others regarding my contributions.

01:03:07.772 --> 01:03:14.618
So this is him still trying to jockey for that last possible open window to get some credit for this.

01:03:15.419 --> 01:03:19.144
And that's why he was earlier in the video and you can watch it on the last show.

01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:22.068
That's why he was so trying to be very humble.

01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:29.398
You know, I'm not sure that anyone else didn't come up with this idea before me, but you know, I do have these patents, but they didn't really help me because it was such a cutthroat thing.

01:03:29.478 --> 01:03:32.582
And everybody was, you know, sending me cease and desist letters and stuff.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:47.042
It's the only thing, it's part of the capital that we're all trading as academics and intellects contributing to this common song that we sing in science, and that we will all respect the contributions of each other.

01:03:47.062 --> 01:03:48.324
Does that answer your question?

01:03:48.684 --> 01:03:49.445
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:57.029
And I feel honoured that I'm in a position to be able to at least give you the opportunity to get some of that credit, you know, and I feel honoured about that.

01:03:57.069 --> 01:04:00.692
So I'm going to take us on to a different part, because we are in the middle of COVID.

01:04:00.992 --> 01:04:04.994
You are therefore one of the experts on mRNA vaccination.

01:04:06.215 --> 01:04:09.778
And it has done a tremendous step with regards to reducing

01:04:10.737 --> 01:04:11.157
I'm shocked.

01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:13.719
I mean, I am amazed.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.902
Now notice that they didn't actually say anything there.

01:04:17.002 --> 01:04:22.025
It has done a tremendous job at reducing and then he goes, I'm shocked.

01:04:22.746 --> 01:04:25.007
So they didn't actually say what it did there.

01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:29.331
And I don't know that that wasn't a scripted kind of thing where

01:04:30.171 --> 01:04:38.917
It's, I don't know what you would call this, but you know, you're, you're kind of maneuvered into making the assumption of filling in that blank of what they meant.

01:04:39.017 --> 01:04:41.379
Well, obviously they mean saves lives.

01:04:41.939 --> 01:04:43.200
So there's a novel virus.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.124
Millions of people were dying and now millions more were saved by this thing that I'm shocked.

01:04:49.744 --> 01:04:50.945
I'm absolutely shocked.

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:00.177
Ugh.

01:05:00.768 --> 01:05:01.188
I'm shocked.

01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:03.750
I mean, I am amazed.

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:08.853
I spent a couple of decades of my career trying to advance new gene delivery technologies.

01:05:09.454 --> 01:05:17.279
I was a founder of Inovio, the electroporation company, and mentored the young Norwegian scientist that was behind that.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.881
I spent years and years developing and testing cationic lipids.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.463
I know how hard this is.

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:26.585
I noticed Mark in the chat says that he didn't mention John Wolfe.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:30.348
I think John Wolfe is the first author of the paper with the RNA

01:05:30.728 --> 01:05:32.950
in transfecting something or other.

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:37.495
This is to get to get this level of transgene expression, because that's really what it is.

01:05:37.535 --> 01:05:39.277
This is really gene back to the original concept.

01:05:39.577 --> 01:05:42.860
This is gene therapy applied to vaccines with RNA.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.061
Wow.

01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:48.185
I thought given what had happened in all the pushback and and

01:05:48.854 --> 01:05:53.935
all the intervening time, I thought that this would eventually come to pass, but I would be long in the ground when it happened.

01:05:54.335 --> 01:06:00.796
So to see it happen so suddenly in the context of this amazing public health crisis we're in is mind-boggling.

01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:13.219
And furthermore, the levels of activity of these lipoplexes, that's the technical term for these small nano-aggregates of RNA and DNA,

01:06:14.264 --> 01:06:20.088
and lipids that are formed, which are what allows the RNA to go into cells and be produced into protein.

01:06:21.128 --> 01:06:26.672
The level of efficiency associated with those is mind-blowing to me.

01:06:27.772 --> 01:06:38.079
And in particular, I think the unsung hero in this song here is Dr. Peter Collis and his team, who developed the core, this advanced, new,

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:47.566
formulations of lipids that are directly being used by both the BioNTech Pfizer product and the CureVac product.

01:06:47.727 --> 01:06:49.568
The Moderna product is a slight variation on the same.

01:06:50.489 --> 01:06:52.310
The activity of those is mind-blowing.

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:55.833
So I never expected to see this in my lifetime.

01:06:56.474 --> 01:07:02.999
So it's curious because here he seems to be implying that the formulation of lipid is the reason why

01:07:05.034 --> 01:07:18.017
He seems to say that the efficiencies are mind-blowing and the new formulations of lipids that he's attributing to course, Peter Cullis, um, these guys, these guys are, are amazing.

01:07:18.097 --> 01:07:29.981
So it's, it's curious because of course the Nobel prize was given to the, the people that came up with the, the M one pseudo uridine, uh, chemical alteration.

01:07:31.161 --> 01:07:31.361
So.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.713
It's a curious thing to remember.

01:07:34.733 --> 01:07:37.777
This is, again, you just have to remember that this is June 2021.

01:07:41.843 --> 01:07:52.792
So there's still possibility for him to position to some credit, but he's got to sort of make the argument that, you know, with some gentlemanly courtesy.

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:59.056
And so he had tips to other people that he thinks kind of spread the credit out as well.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:06.943
And I think it's very curious from a biological perspective that he is actually saying that these new formulations

01:08:07.663 --> 01:08:09.565
are incredible, because what does that mean?

01:08:09.605 --> 01:08:17.931
Then that means that the chemical contribution to the story of M1 pseudouridine is not as important.

01:08:19.132 --> 01:08:23.636
He's not saying anything about that, that the mRNA is altered.

01:08:25.257 --> 01:08:31.963
And I think we should listen to it again, because it's really that important to see that, because that's a detail that I missed the last time.

01:08:32.711 --> 01:08:37.974
that are directly being used by both the BioNTech Pfizer product and the CureVac product.

01:08:38.135 --> 01:08:39.936
The Moderna product is a slight variation on the same.

01:08:40.876 --> 01:08:42.658
The activity of those is mind-blowing.

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:49.602
So I never expected to see this in my lifetime, and I'm fascinated.

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:54.705
But with that high level of transfection activity of polynucleotide delivery ability,

01:08:56.243 --> 01:09:02.867
there comes consequences, as you know, in drug development, nothing is free, and no drug is perfectly safe.

01:09:03.867 --> 01:09:15.013
And so with this amazing advance in efficiency, come some potential issues, which I think we need to be sensitive to.

01:09:15.434 --> 01:09:19.456
Now, this is a sensitive topic, because as I said, we're in the middle of a pandemic.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:29.945
there is a lot of pressure politically to try and get out of it with regards to the vaccines and a major part of it, especially with some of the other side effects that we're seeing from some of the other vaccine candidates.

01:09:30.085 --> 01:09:33.047
It looks as though the mRNA technology is leading the way.

01:09:33.687 --> 01:09:37.229
So you've made a good point is that there is the opportunity to make a difference.

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:42.151
But as always with any technology, there are risks or potential problems.

01:09:43.032 --> 01:09:44.292
This is an important topic.

01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:48.714
What have you come across recently that would make you think about

01:09:50.276 --> 01:09:52.937
consideration of how we approach vaccination at this point.

01:09:54.178 --> 01:09:54.738
So thanks for that.

01:09:54.898 --> 01:09:56.239
And let me frame that up a little bit.

01:09:57.379 --> 01:10:00.981
I was alerted from a colleague that worked for the government, let's say U.S.

01:10:01.001 --> 01:10:03.742
government, that was in Wuhan during the last month of 2019.

01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:10.845
I was alerted in the first week of 2020 about the threat that the virus represented.

01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:13.341
And I made a threat assessment.

01:10:13.361 --> 01:10:18.102
I'm an experienced outbreak specialist that does a lot of biodefense work these days, mostly with the US government.

01:10:18.522 --> 01:10:28.505
And so I made a threat assessment and made a personal determination that the most efficient way to help provide protection was to focus on drug repurposing, not on vaccine development.

01:10:28.545 --> 01:10:32.405
Now, the government of the United States made a different assessment and different decision.

01:10:32.745 --> 01:10:34.166
And I don't want to second guess that.

01:10:35.686 --> 01:10:36.587
It's water under the bridge.

01:10:36.867 --> 01:10:46.193
And I can tell you, having been through too many of these outbreaks, when it hits and the fog of war hits, it becomes very difficult to process information and make decisions.

01:10:47.434 --> 01:11:04.545
This decision was made by the government to pursue vaccine technology because there was apparently by these emails that have come out recently from The Washington Post under FOIA, there was a sense that this was the best way to move forward is to invest all capital and effort into vaccine development.

01:11:05.966 --> 01:11:15.616
And the NIH, as well as BioNTech back in EU, made a strategic assessment to invest in RNA-based approaches, which was quite bold.

01:11:17.117 --> 01:11:19.540
And that decision has been validated.

01:11:21.321 --> 01:11:23.403
And so I've watched with great interest as this has proceeded.

01:11:25.071 --> 01:11:32.673
Recently, because of my background, and I'm a clinical development specialist, I'm experienced in toxicology and regulatory affairs and other things.

01:11:32.733 --> 01:11:34.154
This is what I do for a living these days.

01:11:36.895 --> 01:11:46.738
I was approached by some individuals to provide an assessment, an independent assessment, of some data that had been revealed through a Freedom of Information Act

01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:59.871
submitted by a group of Canadian scientists and physicians, which had obtained a copy of the application which Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted for their mRNA vaccine.

01:12:00.312 --> 01:12:02.214
He got the jab to travel, remember?

01:12:02.734 --> 01:12:25.997
to the regulatory authorities in japan and this is a there forgive me there's some technical he's not mentioning byron bridal's name this is at 1.4 speed just in case you're getting impatient we're almost to the new part the words here um this was their uh initial new drug application or uh their common technical document these are regulatory terms what it means is it's the information package that a drug developer or sponsor in this case vaccine developer

01:12:26.437 --> 01:12:34.703
would submit to a government regulatory authority that basically says, here's the sum total of all of our data at this point in time supporting the use of this product in humans.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:44.050
And so normally these packages of information are closely held confidential and are not discoverable by Freedom of Information Act.

01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:45.371
They're usually protected from that.

01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:46.532
And that's certainly the case in the United States.

01:12:47.012 --> 01:12:54.538
But these Canadian scientists and physicians who were very concerned about some of the safety signals that they were seeing in vaccine recipients in Canada

01:12:54.798 --> 01:13:05.103
So all this talk, all of this talk is to tell you that they, through a Freedom of Information Act, got a document that wasn't available in America that showed the distribution of the lipid nanoparticles.

01:13:05.223 --> 01:13:08.585
It's crazy how many words he used to say that.

01:13:09.165 --> 01:13:12.187
Decided to, of their own initiative, to seek more information.

01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:36.181
And so they obtained this, and within 24 hours, I was asked by the editor-in-chief of an organization called Trial Site News in the United States to look at this document and another document that was publicly available from the European Medicines Agency that was their official summary of their assessment of the analogous initial new drug application and common technical document that had been submitted to them.

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:39.242
Can I stop you here a minute, Robert, before you go any further?

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:53.867
Because we're speaking live, and this information is being shared publicly, and you are walking in an area here that is not well taken, where you are saying stuff that can be challenging to the political narrative with regards to vaccines.

01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:56.068
Are you sure you want to speak about this?

01:13:57.988 --> 01:13:59.789
Are you sure you want to go forward?

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:02.150
Are you sure you want to go forward, Robert?

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:05.511
Because I don't want you to risk your emus or your horses.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:09.070
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

01:14:09.531 --> 01:14:10.091
Are you sure?

01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:13.772
Yeah, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to pause and reconsider.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.093
I'm really committed to openness and transparency.

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:20.053
And part of that comes from the background.

01:14:20.073 --> 01:14:20.973
That was cued up.

01:14:21.233 --> 01:14:22.914
I'm sorry, but that was scripted.

01:14:23.194 --> 01:14:26.695
And now that I've seen it twice, I'm sure it's scripted.

01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:28.035
That's hilarious.

01:14:28.195 --> 01:14:35.637
And every time he thanks him, I have the feeling he's more or less thanking him for reading the question he told him to read at the right time.

01:14:37.077 --> 01:14:38.959
on the crucible that I've had to go through.

01:14:39.599 --> 01:14:44.445
But it also comes from the extensive training I've had in bioethics.

01:14:45.245 --> 01:14:55.416
And I'm personally as a physician, scientist, clinical development specialist, I have a really bedrock commitment to fundamental principles of bioethics.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.238
And among those is transparency.

01:14:58.012 --> 01:15:04.418
and the importance of full disclosure to particularly people receiving experimental products.

01:15:05.058 --> 01:15:12.705
And so what an interesting, I mean, it is just an extraordinary nonstop full court press to try and get you to believe

01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:16.467
that he is the most ethical man on the planet.

01:15:16.527 --> 01:15:18.248
Transparency, transparency.

01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:20.169
You know, for me, it's about transparency.

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:21.829
For me, it's ethics.

01:15:22.009 --> 01:15:23.730
It's, I feel the need.

01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:26.572
I just really, it's important to me.

01:15:27.032 --> 01:15:28.813
I've got extensive training.

01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:30.454
I've got a mentor.

01:15:32.116 --> 01:15:33.677
So I'm comfortable continuing to speak.

01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:43.645
I'm an experienced professional, regulatory professional, and I hope that the audience doesn't in any way infer to fundamental principles of bioethics.

01:15:43.685 --> 01:15:45.447
And among those is transparency.

01:15:46.238 --> 01:15:52.603
and the importance of full disclosure to particularly people receiving experimental products.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:54.965
So I'm comfortable continuing to speak.

01:15:55.365 --> 01:16:07.154
I'm an experienced professional, regulatory professional, and I hope that you don't, the audience doesn't in any way infer that I am invested in a contrary position regarding vaccines.

01:16:07.934 --> 01:16:09.495
I'm not an anti-vaxxer.

01:16:09.836 --> 01:16:13.398
I've spent my whole life developing vaccines and trying to advance vaccines.

01:16:14.459 --> 01:16:15.300
So there you have it.

01:16:16.513 --> 01:16:17.994
You can't see it any other way.

01:16:18.114 --> 01:16:24.277
He is not in any way, shape or form trying to make the argument that this vaccine isn't saving a lot of people.

01:16:24.317 --> 01:16:29.019
I mean, it's totally tremendous, but it also comes with its downsides.

01:16:29.059 --> 01:16:31.360
And so we're going to have to make some risk assessments here.

01:16:32.267 --> 01:16:42.700
Especially if there's some double-stranded DNA in it, but that that doesn't override my commitment to Transparency and disclosure and good science.

01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:48.668
I'm of the belief that the public is the adult public is mature enough to

01:16:49.802 --> 01:16:53.604
to make their own informed decisions based on the information available.

01:16:54.244 --> 01:17:02.608
And that it's the obligation of governments and public health organizations, particularly in the context of an experimental product like these vaccines all are.

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:07.471
Still hasn't said, he said these vaccines are experimental products.

01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:09.632
Why does he just say they're not vaccines?

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:11.993
They're transfections and transformations.

01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:15.559
Because that's not his job.

01:17:15.619 --> 01:17:22.883
His job is to muddy the water to make sure that people don't really understand how they're different from regular vaccines that are already shit.

01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:24.784
Because, of course, he's not an anti-vaxxer.

01:17:24.824 --> 01:17:26.825
He's been developing vaccines his whole career.

01:17:27.125 --> 01:17:27.465
Right now.

01:17:28.526 --> 01:17:32.868
It's the obligation of the public health community, the official public health community, to convince the public that they're safe and effective.

01:17:34.215 --> 01:17:39.176
And so I'm totally okay with proceeding, and I'm a grown-up too.

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:44.257
And if I say something that's controversial and I start getting hate mail, it's part of the price I have to pay.

01:17:44.918 --> 01:17:55.160
But it doesn't, I've been through situations before where I have gone public about major ethical issues that I've encountered in, you know,

01:17:56.224 --> 01:17:59.547
in this kind of technology development space and drug development.

01:17:59.607 --> 01:18:04.932
So to convince the public the shots are safe and effective, that's the whole operation, he said.

01:18:06.293 --> 01:18:13.399
So would they murder people and then lie about it in order to convince the public that the shots are safe and effective relative to a virus?

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:23.808
Would they put a bunch of retards, excuse my language, would they put a bunch of idiots on the web, willing and unwitting,

01:18:24.286 --> 01:18:32.090
willing and witting and unwitting idiots on the web talking about parts of this narrative and even encourage them?

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:34.312
Of course they would.

01:18:36.052 --> 01:18:48.439
In order to convince the public the shots are safe and effective, they murdered people in New York City so that people would be coerced into accepting they must be safe and effective relative to the gain-of-function virus.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.341
It's flying AIDS.

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.111
public that they're safe and effective.

01:18:56.192 --> 01:19:00.514
It's the obligation of the public health community, the official public health community, to convince the public that they're safe and effective.

01:19:00.815 --> 01:19:06.918
It's the obligation of the public health community to convince the public that the shots are safe and effective.

01:19:07.038 --> 01:19:09.800
If that includes lying, it includes lying.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:16.242
There is nothing in that statement that precludes the possibility of lying.

01:19:16.282 --> 01:19:23.485
And in fact, I would suggest to you that in fifth generation warfare, that statement indicates lying.

01:19:25.246 --> 01:19:28.947
It tells you right to your face, it is the obligation.

01:19:29.027 --> 01:19:37.031
The obligation of governments and public health organizations, particularly in the context of an experimental product like these vaccines all are right now,

01:19:38.116 --> 01:19:42.517
It's the obligation of the public health community, the official public health community, to convince the public that they're safe and effective.

01:19:42.977 --> 01:20:02.163
In the context... I can't write when I'm not listening and then I'm only paying attention to what I'm writing.

01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:10.634
In the context of these experimental products, it's the obligation of the government to convince the public the shots are safe and effective.

01:20:10.694 --> 01:20:11.514
Holy shit!

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:23.477
Well then of course the government would murder a few people, using protocols, encouraging people to get put on supplementary oxygen until they begged for a ventilator.

01:20:26.098 --> 01:20:29.979
If in the end it would achieve a higher level of compliance,

01:20:31.357 --> 01:20:35.583
Because that's what convincing the public that it's safe and effective means.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.349
Don't misunderstand the old man's words.

01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:45.499
When he says convince the public that they're safe and effective, it means convince the public to take the shots.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:49.956
And so they'd murder people.

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:52.016
They would also lie about people dying.

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:54.097
They would make, they would commit fraud.

01:20:54.157 --> 01:21:06.262
They would do all the things necessary, anything on the table, including putting people like Robert Malone in front of you to titrate you through this truth over four years.

01:21:07.643 --> 01:21:08.483
And that's what he's done.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:15.596
And so I'm totally okay with proceeding, and I'm a grown-up too.

01:21:15.997 --> 01:21:20.681
And if I say something that's controversial and I start getting hate mail, it's part of the price I have to pay.

01:21:21.342 --> 01:21:31.592
But it doesn't, I've been through situations before where I have gone public about major ethical issues that I've encountered in, you know,

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:37.725
in this kind of technology development space and drug development space and clinical research space.

01:21:38.285 --> 01:21:47.874
And I've had consequences in my career, but that doesn't absolve me from the obligation that I think I have.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:56.659
to be open and transparent about information which is relevant and, in my opinion, should be made publicly available.

01:21:57.039 --> 01:21:58.459
Well, that is tremendous.

01:21:58.779 --> 01:22:06.900
And we do appreciate that because we do need scientists like yourself who are studying and able to challenge and make sure that everything that we do is as safe as possible.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.101
So yes, please, go ahead.

01:22:08.441 --> 01:22:09.601
We are very appreciative of that.

01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:11.501
So thank you for that support and those words.

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:14.642
Let me just kind of loop back just a little bit on that theme.

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:27.232
In my experience, in my strong opinion, science requires that we... Look at that little illusion of consensus there.

01:22:29.034 --> 01:22:29.254
Right?

01:22:29.854 --> 01:22:30.135
See it?

01:22:33.017 --> 01:22:33.878
A true man.

01:22:33.898 --> 01:22:35.079
Honesty.

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.543
Now there's a real illusion of consensus because Edward O'Reilly believes him.

01:22:41.164 --> 01:22:43.366
Well then, how can I doubt him?

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:47.191
I'm just some guy watching this stream and replay.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:52.234
Does Edward O'Reilly need to be anybody real?

01:22:53.275 --> 01:22:53.475
No.

01:22:54.715 --> 01:22:57.237
He could be Philip McMillan just hitting a button.

01:22:58.397 --> 01:23:00.398
These could have all just been sitting there waiting.

01:23:01.819 --> 01:23:07.082
You don't think I could just put up chat messages right now and say, you know, blah, blah, blah.

01:23:07.202 --> 01:23:08.283
Well, I got a rumble one.

01:23:11.764 --> 01:23:12.445
Challenge each other.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:17.738
And if we don't do that, we end up with groupthink and we end up making mistakes.

01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:30.649
So continuing on the theme, these documents were provided to me and I was asked to render an opinion about what I saw as a professional with the level of, you know, the type of experience and background that I have.

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:35.453
These documents that had been uncovered by... So if he's not emphasizing his

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:42.949
depth and breadth of his experience, he's emphasizing his incredible commitment to honesty and transparency.

01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:45.854
My respected scientific and clinical colleagues in Canada.

01:23:47.369 --> 01:23:49.129
And so I made an independent assessment of those.

01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:55.191
And then I was concerned that I may have over interpreted or misinterpreted.

01:23:56.051 --> 01:24:11.114
And so I asked an even more senior regulatory specialist that I respect highly to look over the same documents and draw their own independent opinion to make sure that I wasn't over reading things or overreacting to them.

01:24:11.694 --> 01:24:12.294
So that happened.

01:24:13.743 --> 01:24:30.822
And with those documents, we both observed that there were deficiencies that were highly unusual and not what we would anticipate seeing in a regulatory submission from an organization of the experience and capabilities of Pfizer.

01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:35.393
Um, and, uh, that was, I found that a little bit alarming.

01:24:35.413 --> 01:24:36.094
So did my colleague.

01:24:36.294 --> 01:24:40.117
Um, he was, uh, less sanguine about, uh, placing his name to his assessment.

01:24:40.558 --> 01:24:41.979
Um, and so he remains anonymous.

01:24:42.399 --> 01:24:49.125
Uh, but, uh, I was comfortable that, uh, the assessment that I made was, uh, true and accurate based on the documents that I had.

01:24:49.826 --> 01:24:51.567
Um, and, and I was very clear on that.

01:24:52.107 --> 01:24:55.871
Uh, so, uh, here's another one findings included.

01:24:55.891 --> 01:24:56.952
There's another one.

01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:00.591
Oh, you're so honest, Robert.

01:25:00.951 --> 01:25:02.331
You're so honest, Robert.

01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:13.173
That examined the biodistribution of the vaccine product in a animal model, in a rodent model, with limited numbers of samples, using two core technologies.

01:25:13.273 --> 01:25:22.655
One was the one that I used way back in the day when I was finding RNA delivery, which is expression of proteins from an RNA encoding, the protein that makes the firefly tail glow.

01:25:23.256 --> 01:25:25.156
So it has the perhaps unfortunate name

01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:28.377
here in the States, where we have a strong religious community, of being luciferase.

01:25:29.698 --> 01:25:36.561
Luciferase is just the name that the discoverers that were trying to understand how come fireflies glow at night gave to the protein when they cloned it.

01:25:36.681 --> 01:25:45.706
And it turns out to be a super-duper, we call it reporter protein, way to detect whether or not a polynucleotide, an RNA or a DNA, has gotten into a cell and been turned into protein.

01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:48.387
Because it will produce photons, and those are easy to detect.

01:25:48.927 --> 01:25:49.988
So a lot of technical there.

01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:54.550
So the studies were done in non-good laboratory practice

01:25:55.563 --> 01:25:55.863
means.

01:25:57.684 --> 01:26:04.586
And they involved use of luciferase RNA rather than the actual RNA of the drug product, encoding spike.

01:26:05.506 --> 01:26:08.047
And they involved tritiated RNA.

01:26:09.107 --> 01:26:17.770
So this is radioactively tagged RNA that is able to be detected very sensitively because it's radioactive in various tissues of the animal in which it's been injected.

01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:20.911
And so the data that I was able to review

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:27.845
had to do with the distribution of injected RNA lipoplex complexes.

01:26:27.885 --> 01:26:28.685
We talked about that earlier.

01:26:28.866 --> 01:26:30.467
This is the actual material.

01:26:30.767 --> 01:26:34.470
Only it wasn't the actual material, which is what usually one has to do these studies with.

01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:40.775
It was a surrogate, the RNA for the luciferase instead of the RNA encoding the vaccine, which is encoding spike.

01:26:41.536 --> 01:26:48.882
So what the data showed was that in these rodent models, and it was small numbers of rodents,

01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:55.945
that the injected material, a lot of it stays near the injection site, but a lot of it doesn't.

01:26:56.946 --> 01:27:00.129
And it goes throughout the bodies of these mice or rats.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.082
It appears that it may have remained biologically active in some of those distal sites.

01:27:10.003 --> 01:27:21.187
And it certainly, the data suggested, and the tables are a little difficult to follow for me, because they analyze both the lipid distribution and the tritiated signal distribution, which is a marker of the RNA.

01:27:23.188 --> 01:27:29.271
They showed a high concentration and relative concentration into, for instance, ovarian tissue, spleen and liver.

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.872
But in particular, the ovarian tissue was surprising.

01:27:32.668 --> 01:27:39.491
Um, and particularly it was surprising because there was not that concentration in the, in the testis that were sampled from the male brothers.

01:27:39.511 --> 01:27:40.411
Okay.

01:27:40.691 --> 01:27:49.155
So we had concentration of the lipids in particular in ovaries and we had some relative concentration of the tritiated signal suggesting the RNA in the ovaries compared to some other tissues.

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:54.117
But strikingly we had distribution of all of this kind of systemically throughout these animal models.

01:27:56.058 --> 01:27:56.978
It's really interesting.

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:59.399
So I apologize.

01:28:02.054 --> 01:28:09.260
what he's talking about here, the luciferase would require the expression of the protein.

01:28:09.881 --> 01:28:13.304
So he says that they're using the luciferase to follow it around.

01:28:13.364 --> 01:28:24.113
So they didn't put the spike protein and they put this luciferase in, but wherever it goes, it needs to make luciferase before it's going to release any light or, or, or any fluorescence.

01:28:26.395 --> 01:28:30.058
Um, and yet he just said in this last,

01:28:32.112 --> 01:28:38.180
10 seconds, where the lipids go and where the RNA goes.

01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:40.943
But the lipids are not tagged.

01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:44.388
I don't really understand why he said that.

01:28:44.448 --> 01:28:50.395
It's either very, very imprecise or he's making errors on purpose.

01:28:51.468 --> 01:28:54.709
so that people who listen to him will explain it incorrectly.

01:28:54.789 --> 01:28:56.289
I don't really, just listen again.

01:28:56.329 --> 01:29:02.011
Particularly, it was surprising because there was not that concentration in the testis that were sampled from the male rodents.

01:29:03.212 --> 01:29:11.634
So we had concentration of the lipids in particular in ovaries, and we had some relative concentration of the tritiated signal suggesting the RNA in the ovaries compared to some other tissues.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:16.596
But strikingly, we had distribution of all of this kind of systemically throughout these animal models.

01:29:17.196 --> 01:29:21.057
Is that what we would expect to a certain extent with regards to

01:29:21.677 --> 01:29:22.698
injecting a vaccine.

01:29:22.818 --> 01:29:27.880
Isn't there some degree of spread or do we expect it to remain local to where it was injected?

01:29:29.481 --> 01:29:32.042
Good question and entirely appropriate.

01:29:33.303 --> 01:29:39.826
And I had no way to assess because we didn't have the controls of alternatives.

01:29:40.246 --> 01:29:45.989
But yes, one would expect to some degree a spread of the injected material.

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:49.131
He's not being honest.

01:29:50.939 --> 01:29:52.721
He's not being honest at all.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:58.546
If you put some toxin and so, I mean, he's not being honest at all.

01:29:58.706 --> 01:29:59.667
It's hilarious.

01:29:59.707 --> 01:30:03.150
They're definitely developing the narrative right here and the response right here.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.211
That's why he says, it's a legitimate question.

01:30:05.231 --> 01:30:06.572
Maybe he didn't even expect to get it.

01:30:06.713 --> 01:30:09.095
I don't know.

01:30:09.595 --> 01:30:13.238
I had no way to assess because we didn't have the controls of alternatives.

01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:16.421
But yes, one would expect to some degree

01:30:18.198 --> 01:30:19.379
spread of the injected material.

01:30:20.639 --> 01:30:34.546
The core thesis that had been advanced in the scientific literature before my, you know, I can only speak to my personal experience, my encountering these data in this IND package, IND being the abbreviation for initial loop drug application,

01:30:36.326 --> 01:30:43.648
My expectation from the literature was that the injected material and the encoded spike protein would remain membrane bound and regional.

01:30:44.729 --> 01:30:55.712
I was aware that these complexes had been engineered as a formulation historically, specifically so that they would be transmitted along lymphatic system.

01:30:56.545 --> 01:30:57.966
And I'm trained in pathology.

01:30:57.986 --> 01:30:59.228
I used to teach university pathology.

01:30:59.248 --> 01:31:04.212
And I know darn well that the lymphatic system drains into the blood and circulates and passes through the liver and all that good stuff.

01:31:04.232 --> 01:31:07.155
This is fundamental biology and human physiology in mammals.

01:31:08.236 --> 01:31:18.386
So the prior publications and information has suggested that these complexes would remain at the site of injection or the draining nodes.

01:31:19.264 --> 01:31:19.484
Mm-hmm.

01:31:20.065 --> 01:31:30.712
Um, the formulations were specifically engineered to, to preferentially go through lymphatics to the draining nodes, lymph nodes, which is where the immune system processes antigens and teaches B cells and T cells.

01:31:30.972 --> 01:31:38.398
These are the things that attack other cells or produce antibodies, um, teaches them, uh, educates them so that they make the proper immune response against the antigen.

01:31:38.638 --> 01:31:44.402
I feel like there's something that, um, this should be explained here because I've explained it only once before on the stream.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:32:14.293
But with regard to the formulation does just make a little line here With regard to the formulation he uses the word a lot With regard to the formulation of the lipids what he's really actually speaking of there is the mechanical Proprietary methodologies that are used

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:20.484
to assemble the RNA with the lipid nanoparticles.

01:32:20.784 --> 01:32:25.408
And the primary intellectual property here is microfluidics.

01:32:25.688 --> 01:32:37.398
So little plastic and glass things that are carved so that they bring together like two streams of something that come together like this.

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:38.099
And if you

01:32:39.602 --> 01:32:48.018
they've figured out that if you do a certain level of turns or spins or whatever, then you get a certain sized lipid nanoparticle.

01:32:48.519 --> 01:32:49.882
And if you do a certain number of

01:32:51.403 --> 01:32:55.827
of curves and spins and whatever, you can get single RNAs to be sorted out.

01:32:56.327 --> 01:33:14.902
And so then when they come together here and you spit out over here, you get a very uniform set of particles that comes out and they usually have the same ratio of lipids to RNA and they can adjust it depending on the microfluidics of the RNA that comes in and the microfluidics of the lipids that come in.

01:33:15.422 --> 01:33:17.344
And I'm not an expert in any of this stuff.

01:33:17.404 --> 01:33:19.546
I'm just trying to explain to you that

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:35.437
At the start of the pandemic, there was a loss of intellectual property value for a lot of the methodologies and a lot of the standard products that were over $150 billion a year, the antibodies.

01:33:36.298 --> 01:33:39.560
That loss of intellectual property, of course,

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:52.301
was pretty tragic for them because a lot of small pharmaceutical companies are basically sold and their value is determined by the number of patents they have and what those patents are for.

01:33:53.562 --> 01:34:03.793
And the whole technology of lipid nanoparticles is this kind of microfluidic technology in combination with the actual chemistry of the lipid nanoparticles.

01:34:04.233 --> 01:34:16.402
Part of the thing is also the proprietary combination of chemicals like pegs and stuff that are put in there that allow these microfluidic formulations to come out relatively uniformly.

01:34:18.163 --> 01:34:31.373
And so, he's not explaining that of course, but I just want you to understand that there's a great deal of... There's a great deal of new intellectual property here and

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:35.299
A lot of that is stuff that I think

01:34:36.496 --> 01:34:42.221
Peter Cullis is involved in, he was probably involved in, isn't aware of, maybe he was even brokering it for a very long time.

01:34:42.521 --> 01:34:44.142
For the viewership.

01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:46.564
So that was the logic.

01:34:47.044 --> 01:34:48.506
Spike was engineered with the tether.

01:34:49.607 --> 01:34:54.490
It transmembrane region, it was supposed to stay in the cells that it was, that were in the region.

01:34:54.971 --> 01:35:03.538
And it was not previously disclosed, let's say, in the literature, that it would move systemically in any kind of a systematic way.

01:35:04.338 --> 01:35:06.120
Yeah, it's like,

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:23.780
It's like the eddies and the way that the, at a small scale, that's what makes microfluidics so interesting is that at the small scale, the capillary action of water pulls water through these little spaces.

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:34.404
And then when it does that, the molecules and the things that are dissolved in them behave in predictable ways that they don't necessarily behave in larger volumes.

01:35:34.464 --> 01:35:37.405
So it, again, I'm not an expert, I'm just telling.

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:43.395
So, for me, it was a surprise, and the relative concentration in certain organs was a bit of a surprise.

01:35:43.476 --> 01:35:46.038
You'd expect it to concentrate in spleen and in liver.

01:35:46.679 --> 01:35:58.372
The ovarian signal was a little surprising, more than a little surprising, a bit concerning, particularly since, now we get into this intersection between these many reports that patients, that are out there, that patients have made.

01:35:58.952 --> 01:36:01.353
And we have to be really careful because there's a selection bias.

01:36:01.733 --> 01:36:13.796
When somebody makes a spectacular claim, you know, I lost my baby or I had, you know, my parents died or, you know, right after vaccination, whatever, these things quickly catch fire in social media these days.

01:36:14.777 --> 01:36:20.918
And the truth is that all of these events would be expected to occur at some normal frequency.

01:36:21.779 --> 01:36:25.700
And for instance, there are those who say, oh, we have X number of vaccine associated deaths.

01:36:26.496 --> 01:36:31.859
Well, and then there's others that I've heard public health officials saying, no, there's no vaccine associated deaths.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:32.380
Okay.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.340
Well, I know that's false.

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:39.224
Um, because by random chance, a certain number of people will die within the two weeks after they receive a vaccine.

01:36:39.444 --> 01:36:42.186
The question is, is there any causative relationship between those?

01:36:42.586 --> 01:36:48.069
And is there more people dying at, for example, just to take the extreme, there is no warning here.

01:36:48.129 --> 01:36:48.730
Make sure

01:36:51.604 --> 01:36:52.527
Make sure you see it.

01:36:52.547 --> 01:36:54.092
There's no warning here at all.

01:36:54.132 --> 01:36:59.247
There's no, he's not even coming close to saying, pause this shit.

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:06.241
Are there more people dying than would normally happen by random chance in X period of time after they receive the vaccine?

01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:06.821
Those are the key issues.

01:37:07.921 --> 01:37:18.644
And so there's various claims that are made, and people are, there are those that are very upset, and understandably so, about risks, including this group of Canadians.

01:37:19.524 --> 01:37:22.645
And I hear about it all the time, as you might imagine, with my background.

01:37:23.025 --> 01:37:24.285
You know, people on the street.

01:37:24.885 --> 01:37:26.205
The house cleaner, you know, should I take a vaccine?

01:37:26.505 --> 01:37:27.566
I have- Oh!

01:37:28.626 --> 01:37:29.546
House cleaner.

01:37:30.936 --> 01:37:32.318
Should I take a vaccine?

01:37:33.699 --> 01:37:34.580
The house cleaner.

01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:49.959
Are you really to believe that the guy that lives at the foot of the Shenandoah forest with a shitty little house, according to Merrill Nass, a dirty little farmhouse, a little humble farmhouse, he's got a house cleaner?

01:37:51.872 --> 01:37:53.933
Yeah, is that how that works on farms?

01:37:54.393 --> 01:37:57.375
I don't know very many farms that have a house cleaner in Wisconsin.

01:37:57.415 --> 01:38:01.957
That was not something I associated with farms, house cleaner.

01:38:03.778 --> 01:38:14.943
And it's an interesting thing because two weeks from now, they're gonna go on the Brett Weinstein podcast and talk about how Steve Kirsch's house cleaner is vaccine injured.

01:38:17.604 --> 01:38:19.185
I find it incredibly,

01:38:20.421 --> 01:38:24.382
curious, an incredibly curious story.

01:38:24.402 --> 01:38:29.924
These problems all the time, and understandably so about risks, including this group of Canadians.

01:38:30.805 --> 01:38:37.447
And I hear about it all the time, as you might imagine, with my background, you know, people on the street, the house cleaner, you know, should I take a vaccine?

01:38:37.727 --> 01:38:45.430
I have people on the street just stop him because they all know that he's a bioethics expert and a clinical clinical trial specialist and a former

01:38:46.270 --> 01:39:07.388
Study section head and you know, he was a candidate for the head of scientific director of a US Emirate for goodness sakes these problems in this background Um, and I'm asked to opine so I get hit with this Um in this case some of these reports about dysmenorrhea or other ovarian related events that

01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:17.101
may or may not have been underreported by public health authorities, or may have been readily discarded as not vaccine related.

01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:19.004
Because this is all subjective.

01:39:19.064 --> 01:39:19.945
That's the one thing about this.

01:39:20.286 --> 01:39:24.973
We can talk as if this is hard science, and we're all dealing with numbers and statistics and machine learning and all that wonderful stuff.

01:39:25.273 --> 01:39:27.774
But the truth is, it comes down to somebody making a subjective decision.

01:39:28.274 --> 01:39:31.576
This is related to vaccines, or it isn't related to vaccines.

01:39:32.136 --> 01:39:34.497
And that triggering an investigation.

01:39:34.897 --> 01:39:41.980
A subjective decision that this is or isn't related to vaccines, and then they got to investigate.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:47.142
And so we'll never really know if these people are being hurt by the vaccine.

01:39:47.162 --> 01:39:49.463
Wow, it's such a strong warning.

01:39:49.543 --> 01:39:51.744
I'm just impressed with his heroism here.

01:39:52.964 --> 01:40:02.566
that if the person making that decision, that call, has any intrinsic bias, this can cause problems, and we're very aware of that type of problem in clinical research.

01:40:02.806 --> 01:40:03.806
I want to pause you here a minute.

01:40:03.826 --> 01:40:09.988
I want to take you back to something that you'd said, which was in relation to the spike protein spreading systemically, that's mean throughout the body.

01:40:10.448 --> 01:40:21.050
I remember seeing a very interesting study in Israel where they were looking at patients with hematological malignancies, and they realized that they can't do PET scans

01:40:21.676 --> 01:40:32.046
within a certain time frame, because if they did, they were starting to get false positives because nodes were lighting up all over the body and they couldn't differentiate post-vaccination.

01:40:32.086 --> 01:40:38.611
Does this fit with spike protein going and spreading into nodes and spleen throughout the body?

01:40:39.272 --> 01:40:45.756
Okay, so we have to, allow me to dissect that a little bit, and it's a fascinating observation and insight that you're sharing, and thank you for sharing it.

01:40:46.616 --> 01:40:51.499
It's adding value, and this is a great example of how science, good science, happens.

01:40:52.179 --> 01:41:04.586
So it's possible, if you think about the fact that Robert Malone is an operative, and Philip McMillan isn't, but Philip McMillan needs to be

01:41:06.647 --> 01:41:10.071
or let's say not an operative, but he doesn't know, right?

01:41:10.111 --> 01:41:11.693
He's an unwitting participant.

01:41:11.734 --> 01:41:13.095
He thinks he's being a hero.

01:41:13.556 --> 01:41:14.837
He was asked to be a hero.

01:41:14.897 --> 01:41:19.083
He stepped up and now he's talking to an American hero and he can barely keep up.

01:41:20.305 --> 01:41:29.996
He's not a very sophisticated doctor and I'm not trying to insult him, but this is not a guy who, who dropped everything and started reading his way into understanding this.

01:41:30.076 --> 01:41:35.162
He assumes he knew from the very beginning and someone told him he definitely did and said, here's what we need you to do.

01:41:35.643 --> 01:41:38.827
We need you to talk about the spike protein and we need you to talk about it now.

01:41:41.081 --> 01:41:49.704
is a lot of the folks, you know, it takes a lot of minds, the expression it takes a village, it takes a lot of people thinking really hard and looking for associations to pick signal from noise.

01:41:50.845 --> 01:41:52.905
And you've just given a great example of that.

01:41:53.285 --> 01:41:57.507
So let's pull apart a little bit what you said, we're speaking about spike protein.

01:41:59.028 --> 01:42:02.910
Philip almost looks a little confused right now, which is actually kind of funny.

01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:14.073
So the data that kind of lit me up a little bit with looking at the Pfizer IND package was relating to the distribution of the transfection complexes.

01:42:14.373 --> 01:42:18.815
Transfection being a fancy scientific word for the process of the RNA getting into cells.

01:42:20.155 --> 01:42:25.256
So transfection being a fancy scientific word for the process of the RNA getting into cells.

01:42:25.517 --> 01:42:27.637
The distribution of the transfection complexes.

01:42:27.957 --> 01:42:32.358
Transfection being a fancy scientific word for the process of the RNA getting into cells.

01:42:32.558 --> 01:42:35.079
He said transfection complexes.

01:42:35.179 --> 01:42:48.122
Wow, I mean... I'm actually quite shocked he said it.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:50.780
Wow.

01:42:52.301 --> 01:43:01.324
So I was talking about the data relating to the distribution of the lipo plexus, which caused the RNA to get into cells and turn into spike protein.

01:43:01.804 --> 01:43:02.844
You're talking about spike protein.

01:43:03.504 --> 01:43:07.566
And so there's another key paper that I'll remind you of, I'm sure you're aware of.

01:43:08.706 --> 01:43:13.389
that recently it's in press, it's past peer review, and it's in press from Harvard and Brigham.

01:43:13.409 --> 01:43:15.931
So generally, you know, this is like publication in NEJM.

01:43:15.951 --> 01:43:18.133
If it comes out of Harvard and Brigham, we all say, oh, yes, that must be true.

01:43:19.013 --> 01:43:30.262
But in any case, it was a bunch of nurses, a group of nurses, about 14 or 15, that received vaccine and agreed to, or Moderna in that case, and agreed to have blood draws after vaccination over a period of time.

01:43:30.962 --> 01:43:37.147
And some very sophisticated, sensitive technology was used to detect the presence of free spike protein or subunit in their blood.

01:43:38.416 --> 01:43:43.143
So in that data set, they're looking at the actual protein, which is what you're referring to in your example.

01:43:44.065 --> 01:43:47.390
And of course, the production of the protein is a little time shifted.

01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:50.014
It's a little delayed compared to the distribution of the RNA.

01:43:50.717 --> 01:44:03.909
And the engineering that had been done at the Vaccine Research Center for the Moderna product and at BioNTech for the Pfizer product had- Vaccine Research Center, that's Barney.

01:44:04.469 --> 01:44:13.577
And Barney was college roommates at Rice University with the dude at, one of the dudes at Pfizer, Mark could tell me.

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:17.322
But they were definitely college roommates.

01:44:18.183 --> 01:44:20.563
And Barney was college roommates with somebody else.

01:44:20.763 --> 01:44:22.903
Is my boy Mark in the chat?

01:44:23.083 --> 01:44:23.884
What are we doing here?

01:44:25.824 --> 01:44:26.464
Who was that?

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:32.665
Anyway, I'm pretty sure there's like newspaper articles and stuff about these guys being college roommates.

01:44:32.845 --> 01:44:33.105
Anyway.

01:44:33.345 --> 01:44:35.366
Engineered the spike so that it would stay put where it was expressed.

01:44:36.126 --> 01:44:43.587
And yet these nurses had significant levels of non-trivial levels of circulating free spike protein in their blood for a prolonged period of time.

01:44:44.147 --> 01:44:49.452
Now, for me as a gene delivery guy, this is kind of, wow, I'm shocked.

01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:50.192
It's amazing.

01:44:50.272 --> 01:44:50.933
I can't believe it.

01:44:51.293 --> 01:44:51.894
Well, not really.

01:44:51.934 --> 01:44:54.356
I mean, I believe the data, but it's profound.

01:44:54.456 --> 01:44:55.256
Is that real?

01:44:55.597 --> 01:44:59.600
Did they really, PolitiFact actually said that he said it, what?

01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:00.801
Seriously?

01:45:01.582 --> 01:45:06.786
PolitiFact said that, no way, I don't believe it.

01:45:07.447 --> 01:45:08.227
I don't believe it.

01:45:09.534 --> 01:45:12.116
Pamela, I don't believe it.

01:45:12.196 --> 01:45:14.177
They did not hat tip him.

01:45:14.198 --> 01:45:15.679
Oh my God.

01:45:15.719 --> 01:45:16.759
They had tipped him.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.401
Bridles claims are false.

01:45:20.802 --> 01:45:21.963
Oh my gosh.

01:45:23.364 --> 01:45:24.365
Robert Malone.

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:25.546
Oh my gosh.

01:45:25.626 --> 01:45:26.186
Well done.

01:45:26.227 --> 01:45:27.007
Thank you very much.

01:45:27.507 --> 01:45:31.370
Pamela, as always coming in, coming in hot.

01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:32.471
Thank you very much.

01:45:33.512 --> 01:45:34.773
William Gruber.

01:45:34.853 --> 01:45:35.453
There he is.

01:45:35.533 --> 01:45:36.474
That's Marky Mark.

01:45:37.175 --> 01:45:37.715
Nice work.

01:45:38.316 --> 01:45:38.756
Nice work.

01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.821
So they were college roommates.

01:45:42.641 --> 01:45:43.121
That's dope.

01:45:44.482 --> 01:45:46.984
And I mean, I guess in a good way or a bad way.

01:45:47.924 --> 01:45:53.147
In terms of the underlying technology, so both, like we said at the beginning, there's a yin and a yang to these things.

01:45:54.288 --> 01:46:01.992
So as a technologist who had worked for decades trying to develop more efficient systems for non-viral gene transfer, this was shockingly good.

01:46:02.552 --> 01:46:07.613
More efficient systems for non viral gene transfer.

01:46:07.733 --> 01:46:09.594
Please say it again, sir.

01:46:10.094 --> 01:46:10.974
That was pretty good one.

01:46:10.994 --> 01:46:13.714
That was a pretty good one in terms of the underlying technology.

01:46:13.754 --> 01:46:17.475
So both, uh, like we said at the beginning, uh, there's a yin and a yang to these things.

01:46:18.015 --> 01:46:29.958
Um, so, uh, from as a technologist who had worked for decades trying to develop more efficient systems for non viral gene transfer, more efficient systems.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:47:05.126
for say it out loud with me non-viral gene transfer you see you see where we're going here it's all the same stuff it's all the same story they want to hijack they want you to believe that you don't have any of this machinery that they're finding it out there as pathogens and that they're using it

01:47:06.323 --> 01:47:07.663
They're making stuff from it.

01:47:08.544 --> 01:47:09.584
They're making products.

01:47:09.644 --> 01:47:11.104
They're discovering things.

01:47:15.686 --> 01:47:17.666
They're misleading us about our own biology.

01:47:17.706 --> 01:47:18.527
I'm convinced of it.

01:47:18.967 --> 01:47:22.588
And this guy is one of the people that has been doing it for a very long time.

01:47:22.628 --> 01:47:26.709
He got recruited as a young man and he's been doing it ever since.

01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:31.131
We have been governed by this mythology for a couple of decades.

01:47:31.191 --> 01:47:32.391
Our parents were governed by it.

01:47:36.022 --> 01:47:44.010
As a trained pathologist, clinical research specialist, physician scientist... How many times is he going to repeat that?

01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:45.132
I didn't go back.

01:47:45.212 --> 01:47:48.175
That's another repeat of the same list of shit.

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:55.602
As a technologist who had worked for decades trying to develop more efficient systems for non-viral gene transfer, this was shockingly good.

01:47:56.423 --> 01:48:06.189
As a trained pathologist, clinical research specialist, physician scientist, this was a, uh-oh, Houston, we've got a problem.

01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.310
Right?

01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:08.870
It's pretty funny, isn't it?

01:48:09.011 --> 01:48:11.952
Houston, we got a problem.

01:48:13.313 --> 01:48:14.454
Because this isn't supposed to be happening.

01:48:15.334 --> 01:48:17.315
Because spike protein is biologically active.

01:48:18.296 --> 01:48:19.577
It's not an inert antigen.

01:48:19.597 --> 01:48:23.639
It's not just... Oh, the spike protein is biologically active.

01:48:23.699 --> 01:48:24.640
It can be cleaved.

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:26.887
all kinds of other stuff.

01:48:28.528 --> 01:48:29.229
And here it is.

01:48:30.209 --> 01:48:31.790
The spike protein is toxic.

01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:48.463
And now the stories about the properties of the spike protein from this point onward will be sold by tens of hundreds of people on the internet, including Jessica Rose, Walter Chestnut, Kevin McCairn, Stephanie Seneff.

01:48:49.303 --> 01:48:52.986
All of these people start talking about the spike and they're still talking about it today.

01:48:54.713 --> 01:48:55.213
an antigen.

01:48:55.733 --> 01:48:59.614
The virus has evolved to do a whole host of amazing things.

01:49:00.274 --> 01:49:04.395
Um, and, and these little RNA viruses are just evolutionary pressure cookers.

01:49:05.155 --> 01:49:06.935
And, uh, there are all kinds of overlapping.

01:49:06.995 --> 01:49:11.596
How can they be an evolutionary pressure cooker when they don't even have their own enzymes?

01:49:14.236 --> 01:49:16.517
How can they be an evolutionary pressure cooker?

01:49:16.557 --> 01:49:23.378
If the vast majority of them that are produced during infection are non-infectious particles, they are replication incompetent.

01:49:26.127 --> 01:49:28.130
He's telling a story here.

01:49:29.172 --> 01:49:32.817
It's disturbing how easy it is to see it.

01:49:32.877 --> 01:49:36.402
These little RNA viruses are just evolutionary pressure cookers.

01:49:37.145 --> 01:49:43.987
And there are all kinds of overlapping activities that exist in all of the express proteins for these little RNA viruses.

01:49:44.187 --> 01:49:49.329
Yeah, because there's only, there's 31 proteins, but I mean, they each have like 16 different jobs.

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:52.350
They're each like a little Swiss army knife from hell.

01:49:52.770 --> 01:49:58.252
And in fact, Walter Chestnut was calling the spike protein a Swiss army knife from hell for about a year.

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:01.874
like the SARS-CoV-2.

01:50:02.834 --> 01:50:04.694
So spike is not just an antigen.

01:50:04.714 --> 01:50:06.175
Spike has its own intrinsic activity.

01:50:06.795 --> 01:50:15.097
And as you note, among those things is that it binds to a particular receptor present widely in humans, particularly in vascular endothelial cells.

01:50:15.117 --> 01:50:17.817
That's a fancy word for the cells that line the inside of your blood vessels.

01:50:18.898 --> 01:50:23.279
And they display, they express and display this ACE2 receptor.

01:50:24.099 --> 01:50:30.545
And binding of ACE2, ACE2 is crucial for regulation of a whole bunch of things, including blood pressure.

01:50:30.645 --> 01:50:45.478
Now, the reason why I know ACE2 is probably bullshit is because Paul Cottrell and Dr. Richard Fleming, MD, PhD, JD,

01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:49.451
We're so hyper-focused on the spike protein.

01:50:49.511 --> 01:50:52.172
I mean, so hyper-focused on the spike protein.

01:50:52.292 --> 01:50:58.295
And it's incredible, unworldly affinity for the ACE2 receptor.

01:50:58.315 --> 01:51:02.856
Because don't forget, it's not just that it binds to ACE2, and that's the story.

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:09.059
The story is that it has an affinity, which is several orders of magnitude, with more exponents.

01:51:09.719 --> 01:51:20.390
that is so high affinity that the affinity for ACE2 is in and of itself evidence of viral laboratory enrichment.

01:51:22.211 --> 01:51:24.714
That was the story that they were selling us.

01:51:24.874 --> 01:51:25.715
Not only

01:51:26.977 --> 01:51:36.622
was the fear and cleavage site evidence, but the extreme high affinity for the ACE2 receptor was evidence of laboratory enrichment.

01:51:36.702 --> 01:51:49.970
And in fact, the guy who told us that was Richard, Dr. Somebody Somebody Quay from Australia, who was on Philip McMillan's show one week ago.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.942
an hour and a half talking about the Scooby-Doo and about how it was a lab leak.

01:51:58.782 --> 01:52:20.629
And that guy, very early in the pandemic, was talking and publishing pre-prints about how the ACE2 affinity, when compared to ferrets and all these other animals that he has access to, boy, oh boy, his computer models say that this spike protein is super affinity for human ACE2.

01:52:22.446 --> 01:52:38.200
And that super trader spoke in front of our Congress a few times, testified in front of our Congress a few times, and even went on Bay John Health a week ago.

01:52:39.502 --> 01:52:40.743
And we will watch that.

01:52:42.384 --> 01:52:46.028
But understand that, understand how ridiculous that is.

01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:52.876
Dr. Quay testified right next to Dr. Richard Ebright.

01:52:58.564 --> 01:53:03.290
And then he went on and did an hour and a half show with Dr. Philip McMillan a week ago.

01:53:04.918 --> 01:53:20.822
It is all one big five eyes intelligence operation taking in theater players from every one of those countries and combining them with other players from other countries to make it look like there's some kind of consensus about what's going on around here.

01:53:21.722 --> 01:53:25.243
And the only consensus is, is that this traitor is lying with that traitor.

01:53:26.786 --> 01:53:35.532
And so if you have something in the blood that can bind to ACE2, it can cause all kinds of issues, many of which we're only beginning to understand.

01:53:36.773 --> 01:53:40.475
And so... And so isn't that a convenient narrative?

01:53:40.516 --> 01:53:45.099
Because it could be Bradykinin, it could be all these things, you know, all these other things that are involved.

01:53:45.879 --> 01:53:51.723
who can draw all kinds of flow charts and this is connected to that and this and that and the other and holy shit it's so hard to understand.

01:53:52.183 --> 01:54:04.891
Only somebody with an MD, PhD and JD like Richard Fleming could understand it or somebody with chaos theory experience like Dr. Paul Cottrell could understand it because boy oh boy somebody like me could never understand it.

01:54:04.911 --> 01:54:05.951
I'm not even an MD.

01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:10.254
What that also means is that the free protein detected in the blood of these nurses

01:54:11.346 --> 01:54:18.850
is a tiny subset of the total amount of free protein because most of it is probably sticking to ACE2 on vascular endothelial cells, among other things.

01:54:19.130 --> 01:54:23.912
This is a very important point because my research is focused on the autoimmune response.

01:54:24.272 --> 01:54:27.294
My research is focused on the autoimmune response.

01:54:29.608 --> 01:54:55.796
COVID-19 and the fact that what... The autoimmune response of COVID-19 because then he was already seeding the narrative of autoimmunity from severe COVID so that when autoimmunity would develop from transfection, the story would have already been laid down for COVID and this idiot wouldn't even know that he had just unwittingly helped the fifth generation warfare being waged on the whole West.

01:54:58.617 --> 01:54:59.297
Useful idiot.

01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:04.793
That's why he was on that narrative so early in 2020.

01:55:04.954 --> 01:55:07.297
Uh-huh, autoimmunity, so early.

01:55:07.757 --> 01:55:12.664
Not because Dr. Philip McMillan has a unique insight into how the immune system works.

01:55:13.064 --> 01:55:15.488
It's because Dr. Philip McMillan got a phone call.

01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:38.230
or Dr. Philip McMillan just happened to say the right thing and then got a phone call, but some shit happened because there's no way, there is no way to explain why these people were so hot and bothered in 2020 about all these things that should be more likely associated with transfection than with a viral infection, whatever the hell that is.

01:55:39.091 --> 01:55:43.693
And yet they were so sure that the spike protein was gonna do all this crazy shit.

01:55:45.031 --> 01:55:48.994
and they're still sure of it today, just like Kevin McCairn and Rixey and this guy.

01:55:50.415 --> 01:55:53.377
And this guy hosted them last year to talk about it.

01:55:53.657 --> 01:55:56.038
The spike protein, bad, bad.

01:55:56.659 --> 01:55:58.100
Long COVID, bad, bad.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:03.263
Virus spike, the transfection spike, all bad, bad.

01:56:03.964 --> 01:56:07.106
Transfection spike makes viral spike even more bad, bad.

01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:17.815
I have been predicting is happening is that the serum or the free-floating ACE2 binds to the viral spike protein and that combination then triggers an autoimmune response.

01:56:18.015 --> 01:56:18.315
How?

01:56:19.295 --> 01:56:21.336
Why would that trigger an autoimmune response?

01:56:22.116 --> 01:56:32.280
Wouldn't that just lower the amount of circulating ACE2 protein and change that balance in the regulation of fluid dynamics and fluid pressures or some shit?

01:56:35.905 --> 01:56:38.007
It binds and then it causes autoimmunity.

01:56:38.047 --> 01:56:39.328
I don't understand that at all.

01:56:39.348 --> 01:56:42.351
It's so stupid that it aggravates me.

01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:47.676
And from a clinical perspective, what I've noticed is that many patients have symptoms of both.

01:56:47.756 --> 01:56:57.325
And so then his cartoon idea of two things sticking together and causing autoimmunity is backed up by clinical evidence, clinical experience.

01:56:57.765 --> 01:57:01.188
What I've observed in the people that come into my office,

01:57:02.153 --> 01:57:30.632
holy shit two weeks after the vaccination which would which would fit with an igg production time but robert's not treating anybody so why is he nodding up and down is it because of all the clinical trials he's involved in with famotidine and stuff that he hasn't mentioned yet he didn't mention domain and his volunteer team that put together a x-ray crystallography model of the 3l 3cl protease

01:57:31.764 --> 01:57:43.133
and scanned all known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog in three weeks to identify four drugs that could save the world, why isn't he mentioned the DITRA program?

01:57:46.536 --> 01:57:50.139
As opposed to necessarily being directly related to the spike protein.

01:57:50.179 --> 01:57:56.664
So are we triggering an autoimmune response as well as an immune response to the viral spike protein?

01:57:56.724 --> 01:57:57.325
Is that possible?

01:57:58.416 --> 01:58:00.237
Ah, thank you for that last caveat.

01:58:00.297 --> 01:58:00.777
Is it possible?

01:58:00.937 --> 01:58:01.458
Absolutely.

01:58:03.979 --> 01:58:05.040
So this is science, right?

01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.641
This is the intersection of science and medicine.

01:58:07.241 --> 01:58:08.902
And I'm a big fan.

01:58:09.362 --> 01:58:13.965
As a very young undergraduate, I was taken under the wing of an experienced pathologist at Davis.

01:58:14.565 --> 01:58:17.686
And it was a little bit of a brutal experience.

01:58:18.166 --> 01:58:19.466
I got a lot of things drummed into my head.

01:58:19.526 --> 01:58:25.187
One of them was this ancient paper from the 1880s, published in science called The Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses.

01:58:25.707 --> 01:58:27.088
And it's how I've approached science ever since.

01:58:27.448 --> 01:58:30.228
So the core idea is don't get invested in just one hypothesis.

01:58:30.648 --> 01:58:41.170
Recognize that when you encounter something scientifically, some phenomena, which is what we're talking about, then it's really good to come up with as many possible explanations as you can think of.

01:58:41.210 --> 01:58:43.731
Oh my gosh, this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

01:58:47.202 --> 01:58:49.804
I mean, I just, I am absolutely blown away.

01:58:50.284 --> 01:58:51.025
You and all your buddies.

01:58:51.925 --> 01:59:03.153
And then design experiments to reject those so that you get down to a core of hypotheses that you haven't been able to reject.

01:59:03.434 --> 01:59:04.995
And there's a good chance one of those is the true thing.

01:59:05.695 --> 01:59:06.315
Now that's different.

01:59:06.435 --> 01:59:09.116
Some people have a tendency to say, aha, I know what the problem is.

01:59:09.196 --> 01:59:09.577
It's this.

01:59:09.937 --> 01:59:11.838
And they'll go and spend a lot of time focused on that.

01:59:12.198 --> 01:59:17.480
But I think there's a lot of merit to this idea that you are pursuing of autoimmune.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:22.162
And absolutely, I'm a fairly knowledgeable immunologist.

01:59:23.082 --> 01:59:25.123
He's a fairly knowledgeable immunologist.

01:59:25.163 --> 01:59:28.624
I mean, not like he's really knowledgeable with bioethics.

01:59:28.664 --> 01:59:31.245
He's really knowledgeable with clinical development.

01:59:31.325 --> 01:59:32.706
He's really knowledgeable with

01:59:33.286 --> 01:59:36.808
with biodefense stuff, which is mostly what he does right now with the U.S.

01:59:36.828 --> 01:59:37.148
government.

01:59:37.168 --> 01:59:42.650
He's really knowledgeable about a lot of things, and he's only reasonably knowledgeable with immunology.

01:59:42.930 --> 01:59:47.032
And I've spent time in computational immunology and cellular immunology, et cetera.

01:59:47.112 --> 01:59:49.193
Computational immunology?

01:59:49.233 --> 01:59:51.454
That sounds a little bit like Jessica Rose.

01:59:51.654 --> 01:59:53.055
More cellular than hemorrhoid for me.

01:59:56.716 --> 01:59:56.956
These

01:59:59.446 --> 02:00:11.162
Antigen complexes, which is what you're talking about forming, whether they're membrane associated or free, represent... Antigen complexes, you mean spike protein, like clumps?

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:20.263
expressed protein clumps that get made when a cell expresses a bunch of protein that it doesn't need?

02:00:20.283 --> 02:00:21.623
Is that what you mean?

02:00:21.643 --> 02:00:23.444
Exosomes?

02:00:23.484 --> 02:00:24.424
It's back to the fundamentals.

02:00:24.624 --> 02:00:26.745
The immune system doesn't know that it's you or not you.

02:00:27.025 --> 02:00:28.946
They just know whether or not it's different from what it's seen before.

02:00:29.466 --> 02:00:33.868
And anytime you do something like this, where you have a foreign protein complexed with a self-protein,

02:00:34.528 --> 02:00:37.032
then as far as your immune system is concerned, that's something different.

02:00:37.753 --> 02:00:38.815
And it needs to respond to it.

02:00:39.256 --> 02:00:43.703
And we have, you know, our knowledge of the immune system is still evolving.

02:00:44.124 --> 02:00:47.008
And these days we have T regulatory cells and

02:00:47.757 --> 02:00:48.997
It's still evolving.

02:00:49.117 --> 02:00:51.298
These days, we have T regulatory cells.

02:00:51.338 --> 02:00:54.959
I'm not going to tell you what they do, but... All kinds of complex regulatory networks.

02:00:56.179 --> 02:01:01.941
All kinds of complex regulatory networks, but it's as simple as injecting shit in the muscle.

02:01:02.601 --> 02:01:11.584
I mean, you know, we're starting to have all kinds of new things, you know, finding new things, all kinds of regulatory networks, but we just inject shit in the muscle.

02:01:12.144 --> 02:01:14.584
Is it conceivable that we are...

02:01:17.498 --> 02:01:26.060
much of the delayed pathology observed in COVID disease, recognize that COVID disease is not the same as SARS-CoV-2 infection.

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:30.441
A lot of people get infected and they don't develop clinical disease, only a subset do.

02:01:31.121 --> 02:01:38.063
And often that more severe disease, the part that puts you in the hospital and kills you if you are unlucky, or puts you on a respirator with a lot of oxygen,

02:01:38.883 --> 02:01:48.307
That often is delayed, as you say, by two, it's hard to measure because we don't, we're not subjecting humans to challenge studies right now, so we don't really know what the timeline is, it could lead to an infection.

02:01:48.848 --> 02:01:52.670
A lot of people get infected and they don't develop clinical disease, only a subset do.

02:01:53.350 --> 02:02:03.995
And often that more severe disease, the part that puts you in the hospital and kills you, if you are unlucky, or puts you on a respirator with a lot of oxygen, that often is delayed, as you say, with a lot of oxygen.

02:02:05.165 --> 02:02:07.546
Why do you need to be on a respirator with a lot of oxygen?

02:02:08.027 --> 02:02:11.969
One kills you if you are unlucky, or puts you on a respirator with a lot of oxygen.

02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:21.415
That often is delayed, as you say, by two, it's hard to measure because we don't, we're not subjecting humans to challenge studies right now, so we don't really know what the timeline is here.

02:02:21.935 --> 02:02:23.596
But it looks like, as you say, it's two to three weeks.

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:27.879
Now, I would say one thing to your hypothesis about the rise of the IGT.

02:02:29.246 --> 02:02:32.249
Just forgive me, but, you know, I've been tracking this really carefully.

02:02:32.289 --> 02:02:41.198
And I completely agree that the autoimmune hypothesis is one of the leading hypotheses for, just a minute, somebody's trying to call me and I'm going to hang up on them.

02:02:42.078 --> 02:02:42.539
One moment.

02:02:45.113 --> 02:02:51.059
So one of the leading hypotheses for both the pathogenesis of COVID, the disease.

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:55.643
It's often delayed severe disease, inflammatory disease.

02:02:56.004 --> 02:03:01.810
And what the community calls lung COVID, the thing that I experienced, this prolonged syndrome.

02:03:02.831 --> 02:03:05.573
The COVID that I experienced, he said.

02:03:05.633 --> 02:03:07.595
The long, drawn-out syndrome.

02:03:08.055 --> 02:03:09.677
Has a lot of symptoms that are a little bit inexplicable.

02:03:10.037 --> 02:03:11.478
Stop lying!

02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:15.522
There are many different systemic diseases that are consistent with that.

02:03:15.822 --> 02:03:16.463
POTS is one of them.

02:03:17.504 --> 02:03:21.727
But much of the myalgia, arthralgia... POTS?

02:03:22.088 --> 02:03:22.768
Oh, okay.

02:03:22.848 --> 02:03:24.530
You mean like chronic fatigue syndrome?

02:03:26.032 --> 02:03:31.760
in other, in potential coagulopathy that's observed, is consistent with autoimmune functions.

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:32.881
Wow.

02:03:32.941 --> 02:03:37.507
So they're just laying down the narrative that we said already four years ago they were laying down.

02:03:37.547 --> 02:03:41.353
They're laying down the narrative of damage due to COVID

02:03:42.403 --> 02:03:48.227
that they know is eventually going to be probably the bouquet of damage that gets caused by mass transfection.

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:49.088
It's very simple.

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:51.530
What's worrisome is the thrombocytopenia that pops up.

02:03:52.230 --> 02:04:02.538
My colleagues within the FDA, that I'm not going to share their names, tell me is a known complication of any oligonucleotide-based therapy in a small subset of patients, thrombocytopenia.

02:04:03.058 --> 02:04:12.762
So it's so the formation of these complexes is absolutely there is a known complication of any oligonucleotide based.

02:04:13.282 --> 02:04:18.424
So any oligonucleotide based again, is that helping the average person if he says that?

02:04:19.346 --> 02:04:20.707
What's an oligonucleotide?

02:04:20.747 --> 02:04:22.749
It's a RNA or DNA, right?

02:04:22.809 --> 02:04:32.537
So it's just a stupid choice of words if he's really trying to educate people, really trying to enable people, average adults, to engage in informed consent.

02:04:32.577 --> 02:04:33.898
This guy ain't the dude.

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:39.462
Therapy in a small subset of patients, thrombocytopenia.

02:04:39.923 --> 02:04:44.266
So the formation of these complexes is absolutely

02:04:46.693 --> 02:04:50.175
could yield a autoimmune response in a subset of patients.

02:04:50.675 --> 02:04:52.536
And let me amplify that a little bit, because it gets back to the safety.

02:04:52.716 --> 02:04:53.556
There's a vaccine.

02:04:53.636 --> 02:04:55.657
But I want, yes, this is a bit that I want to try and clarify.

02:04:55.697 --> 02:05:04.161
We don't even get close to administration of market authorization, that's the technical term for licensure, for a product, for a vaccine product.

02:05:05.402 --> 02:05:11.028
until one to two years after at least 3,000 subjects, that's people, have been exposed to the product.

02:05:11.489 --> 02:05:11.970
Why is that?

02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:19.058
Because of autoimmune disease, largely, and the autoimmune disease risk, because these are often fairly rare events.

02:05:20.219 --> 02:05:21.020
Now, we cannot

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.701
You know, I can't venture an opinion right now.

02:05:24.761 --> 02:05:29.362
It's not my job to examine the data about whether or not these are rare events or relatively common events that we're seeing.

02:05:30.162 --> 02:05:33.883
But the agent, the regulatory... So you see, he is titrating it.

02:05:33.903 --> 02:05:41.706
He's not actually speaking out yet, even though he has 20 years of experience and he knows from his earlier work.

02:05:42.166 --> 02:05:48.547
He told us in the earlier part of this video that he worked on lipid nanoparticle deliveries.

02:05:48.948 --> 02:05:50.408
I mean, he worked on that stuff.

02:05:52.628 --> 02:05:54.830
For years, he said he worked on that stuff.

02:05:55.050 --> 02:06:01.156
Lipoplexes was a term that he used in this thing because he used this stuff.

02:06:01.276 --> 02:06:01.837
Where is this?

02:06:02.257 --> 02:06:03.038
Where are these notes?

02:06:07.302 --> 02:06:09.904
Packaging viruses, retroviruses.

02:06:10.004 --> 02:06:11.406
I wrote it down here somewhere.

02:06:11.566 --> 02:06:11.846
Anyway.

02:06:12.423 --> 02:06:24.169
agencies throughout the world generally agree that you want to be able to detect a severe adverse event, which autoimmune is one example, at a frequency of about 1 in 1,000 when you power your clinical studies.

02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:30.332
And the statistics just work out that if you want to make sure that you detect something that happens 1 in 1,000 patients that receive the product, you have to expose 3,000 people.

02:06:30.572 --> 02:06:32.974
And then on average, you would see three people that had that event.

02:06:33.014 --> 02:06:34.935
So it would come across as a very rare thing.

02:06:35.915 --> 02:06:44.504
But if it's Guillain-Barre syndrome, paralysis of the face, it was observed with the swine flu vaccine and is part of the safety signal associated with flu vaccines in general.

02:06:45.686 --> 02:06:47.127
It occurs at a higher rate than that.

02:06:47.768 --> 02:06:53.233
And so usually because autoimmune diseases manifest over a longer time course,

02:06:54.336 --> 02:07:01.001
Regulatory dossiers, you know, regulatory agencies require that we have two years of safety follow-up data after administration to at least 3,000 subjects.

02:07:01.662 --> 02:07:04.384
So in this context, I'm pushing you on this question.

02:07:04.404 --> 02:07:06.545
We're in a situation where these things have not been deployed for two years.

02:07:07.406 --> 02:07:08.227
We don't have those data.

02:07:08.647 --> 02:07:10.508
The safety data are emerging.

02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:13.751
But we also have, I like to say, the wolf is at the door.

02:07:14.631 --> 02:07:15.092
People are dying.

02:07:15.212 --> 02:07:17.453
They're filling up our hospitals, fortunately not at the same rate that they used to.

02:07:18.233 --> 02:07:25.297
I'm watching the UK carefully to see the impact of some of these new variants on disease attack rates and incidents in the UK.

02:07:26.138 --> 02:07:30.200
Even the idea of watching other countries was something that was seeded by these clowns.

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:35.262
They made us all want to pay attention to that stupid world meter and all these different websites.

02:07:35.302 --> 02:07:36.123
It was all part of it.

02:07:36.963 --> 02:07:41.586
Encouraging us to think that this data could somehow help us solve the problem of what was going on.

02:07:42.745 --> 02:07:45.146
the data, their official data.

02:07:45.606 --> 02:07:51.168
We were supposed to trust it and not only trust it, but use it to solve the mystery of what was going on.

02:07:51.748 --> 02:07:53.129
It's extraordinary when you see it.

02:07:53.609 --> 02:07:56.510
They don't seem to have come stateside in quite the same way yet.

02:07:57.510 --> 02:08:01.312
I work closely with colleagues in India that are developing vaccines, more traditional ones.

02:08:02.352 --> 02:08:03.093
I mean, I don't know.

02:08:03.813 --> 02:08:05.374
He's he's selling horses.

02:08:05.434 --> 02:08:20.322
He's raising emus he's building barns and he's working with colleagues in India and Paying close attention to the UK and putting out about 17 to 27 pages of sub stack a day Sometimes doing nine podcasts a day.

02:08:20.762 --> 02:08:26.185
It is freaking extraordinary and That is not a that is

02:08:27.799 --> 02:08:29.500
a very unpleasant situation right now.

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:31.200
So here's a question.

02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:35.482
I hope that the UK doesn't experience something similar and that we don't see that in the States, but time will tell.

02:08:36.522 --> 02:08:51.788
So Rob, I'm going to have to ask you here, based on what you have seen so far, do you think it's appropriate for us to continue with mass vaccination when we have these questions arising, especially in groups who are at low risk for severe disease?

02:08:53.663 --> 02:08:56.165
Okay, I'm going to not give you an answer.

02:08:58.167 --> 02:09:02.810
He's not going to give you an answer, which means that he doesn't have principles right now in June of 2021.

02:09:04.572 --> 02:09:13.999
He simply doesn't have principles if he won't say that transfection in healthy people going to college is really, really criminal.

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:21.025
He's not going to give you an answer, which means he's not going to save anyone from the shot.

02:09:24.204 --> 02:09:34.230
I already put out an answer 2 or 3 months before this video and finally published it more than a month before this video where I said we should pause all transfections in humans.

02:09:36.031 --> 02:09:43.295
Some of my answers and some of my reasons were wrong because they were based on Herod von den Bosch but other of these reasons were absolutely and totally right.

02:09:44.096 --> 02:09:46.037
Look at the smile on this guy's face!

02:09:52.116 --> 02:09:54.638
Everybody gets mad at me all the time because I'm angry.

02:09:54.718 --> 02:10:02.162
I'm not having any fun when these people have been lying about the murder in my country for four years straight.

02:10:04.423 --> 02:10:20.613
And using it to murder other people in other countries, to transfect other people in other countries, because this guy couldn't explain it, Brett Weinstein couldn't explain it, none of these people would explain it, and none of them would share my work with you, even though I was being shared with them.

02:10:21.696 --> 02:10:24.159
I was sharing with them, I was begging them.

02:10:29.284 --> 02:10:33.228
Then I got paid for a whole year to work for Bobby Kennedy and I begged him.

02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:40.195
Then I worked for six months for CHD and I begged them, nobody will do this.

02:10:43.035 --> 02:10:45.496
because they're all on the same team.

02:10:45.616 --> 02:10:55.099
It's a limited spectrum of debate that's not supposed to free us or our children or America because America is being controlled, demolished.

02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:00.301
The culture, the future of our kids.

02:11:02.662 --> 02:11:04.682
I'm not loyal to any candidate.

02:11:04.763 --> 02:11:06.383
I'm not loyal to any person.

02:11:06.423 --> 02:11:07.664
I'm loyal to this dirt.

02:11:09.344 --> 02:11:11.605
Where I was born, where my dad was born,

02:11:12.671 --> 02:11:14.912
Where my grandfather was born.

02:11:18.154 --> 02:11:19.014
And where they died.

02:11:22.136 --> 02:11:22.976
I'm tired of this.

02:11:23.797 --> 02:11:26.798
These people are not patriots for their respective countries.

02:11:26.859 --> 02:11:28.059
They are collaborators.

02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:31.321
They are collaborators in a global theater.

02:11:32.995 --> 02:11:40.199
There's no good reason for you to believe that these international people have come together in some spontaneous way.

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:42.641
There's no reason to believe that.

02:11:43.821 --> 02:11:46.683
Americans can't even come together spontaneously.

02:11:52.006 --> 02:11:54.087
Not on social media, not on the truth.

02:11:54.928 --> 02:11:57.890
That's why it took Mark and I almost two years to get together.

02:11:59.130 --> 02:12:01.512
To finally realize that you might be a good guy.

02:12:03.422 --> 02:12:27.028
because people were doing everything they could to keep us away from each other, to keep us busy on our own things, focused on our own things, chasing our own ghosts, angry about our own shit, arguing about our own people, chasing around George Webb for Mark Me, chasing around Rixey and Drastic and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan and all of these people.

02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:32.410
Steve Kirsch, Matt Crawford, Jessica Rose, all of them.

02:12:33.527 --> 02:12:34.728
They all danced with me.

02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:41.393
And now they all pretend like they don't know who the hell I am, that they didn't learn anything from me.

02:12:41.413 --> 02:12:43.355
They never heard anything useful from that guy.

02:12:43.375 --> 02:12:44.636
He's just angry all the time.

02:12:45.056 --> 02:12:45.836
Nobody likes him.

02:12:47.157 --> 02:12:47.878
Nobody likes him.

02:12:47.898 --> 02:12:51.121
That's why they get together in groups of five or six to talk about me.

02:12:52.862 --> 02:12:59.127
And it has to do with me, as a professional, respecting my professional colleagues, whose job it is to make that determination.

02:13:01.457 --> 02:13:22.259
And just to provide context, I did speak with insider colleagues that are very senior at the FDA that I've known for many years and trust, and they trust me, about these potential safety signals and concerns about widespread distribution of the gene expression and the high levels of spike protein free in the blood and the Pfizer data package issues that I had observed.

02:13:22.972 --> 02:13:29.041
And they had recommended to me that I speak to the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation Research at the FDA.

02:13:29.722 --> 02:13:34.469
And he kindly granted me a meeting over Zoom about a day ago.

02:13:35.871 --> 02:13:37.934
And we discussed these various issues.

02:13:38.234 --> 02:13:39.475
I think that's Jeremy Marks.

02:13:41.217 --> 02:13:50.865
He basically presented to me... So he's claiming that he showed Byron Bridle's FOIA request data to the FDA and discussed it.

02:13:50.925 --> 02:13:54.067
So basically, he's done as much as possible.

02:13:55.208 --> 02:13:56.669
There's nothing left for me to do.

02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:58.371
There's nothing left for you to do.

02:13:58.451 --> 02:14:03.375
Bret Weinstein doesn't have to do shit anymore because he's basically gone all the way to the FDA already.

02:14:05.069 --> 02:14:06.410
No reason to do anything else.

02:14:06.450 --> 02:14:07.251
What else could you do?

02:14:07.311 --> 02:14:10.133
I mean, this guy's done it all already.

02:14:10.153 --> 02:14:12.495
He's got all these connections with people that he trusts.

02:14:12.555 --> 02:14:15.137
So then what good are you gonna do?

02:14:15.697 --> 02:14:24.024
What he could because he's constrained by his ability to disclose information associated with the Pfizer package that was fully submitted to the US FDA about two weeks ago.

02:14:25.665 --> 02:14:32.731
And I respect, he has an excellent reputation within the FDA as a person of intelligence and integrity.

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:41.202
And so- Imagine that Kevin McKernan says that the FDA is just totally shit and it's all corrupt.

02:14:42.083 --> 02:14:44.184
And Robert F. Kennedy says it's all corrupt.

02:14:44.204 --> 02:14:48.566
But this guy says that one of the heads of the FDA is just awesome.

02:14:49.446 --> 02:14:50.787
Totally trustworthy.

02:14:51.867 --> 02:14:54.388
I mean, it's almost kind of laughable if you think about it.

02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:57.650
It was fully submitted to the US FDA about two weeks ago.

02:14:59.345 --> 02:15:07.430
And I respect, he has an excellent reputation within the FDA as a person of intelligence and integrity.

02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:15.376
And so I trust that what he tells me reflects that background of intelligence and integrity.

02:15:16.064 --> 02:15:37.958
So, I mean, now he's not only transparent and bioethics expert and whatever, but now he's insisting that somebody that works at a high level at the FDA is also just as trustworthy and just as trans... I mean, it's just lucky that we know people like Robert Malone and his friends or holy shit would we be screwed.

02:15:39.658 --> 02:15:48.781
And he assured me that the gaps that I had identified in the, what are now really historic documents, they're from a different timeframe that were obtained by the Canadian group.

02:15:49.461 --> 02:15:51.962
Oh, these documents are historic documents.

02:15:52.042 --> 02:15:54.983
They don't apply to the stuff that we're doing in America.

02:15:55.403 --> 02:15:56.463
Holy shit.

02:15:59.517 --> 02:16:07.079
and may or may not reflect the current documents that have been submitted.

02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:10.640
I understand all of that, but we are certainly in different parts of the world.

02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:16.701
There is a significant amount of pressure, especially now that there has been some, certainly.

02:16:16.821 --> 02:16:17.701
Wow.

02:16:19.001 --> 02:16:19.922
Wow.

02:16:20.362 --> 02:16:25.783
So Byron Bridle's documents aren't even that important anyway, because they use Luciferase

02:16:27.133 --> 02:16:31.574
And they didn't even really, I mean, they used tritiated RNA, and it wasn't even the right RNA.

02:16:31.654 --> 02:16:34.615
So, you know, it's a historic document at this stage.

02:16:34.635 --> 02:16:37.696
It doesn't even really have anything to do with what we're doing now.

02:16:38.356 --> 02:16:39.037
Stop lying!

02:16:39.917 --> 02:16:41.857
It is extraordinary.

02:16:41.918 --> 02:16:42.978
This is a criminal.

02:16:43.823 --> 02:16:45.164
It's a traitor right there.

02:16:45.284 --> 02:16:52.489
Maybe he's not a criminal because he's working for an intelligence agency or a government organization that allows him to do this.

02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:55.271
But from my perspective, this is a traitor.

02:16:55.992 --> 02:17:01.996
This is somebody who sold out our college kids in June of 2021 because he didn't have the balls.

02:17:02.376 --> 02:17:03.818
He didn't have the principles.

02:17:04.158 --> 02:17:05.459
He didn't have the morals.

02:17:05.919 --> 02:17:07.600
to warn any of these young people.

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:15.365
And instead, he went on an international podcast to talk with a trader from the UK and say nothing for an hour and a half.

02:17:16.285 --> 02:17:17.326
Except he's great.

02:17:17.766 --> 02:17:19.047
He's really righteous.

02:17:19.387 --> 02:17:20.307
He's a great guy.

02:17:20.367 --> 02:17:21.908
He's all about transparency.

02:17:21.948 --> 02:17:24.190
When I do things, I do it with integrity.

02:17:25.854 --> 02:17:30.756
they're aiming for the 12 to 15 year olds, so children who are at low risk of severe disease.

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:44.380
And what I'm saying is I do understand that there is due process, but this is in the context that if this is relevant for long-term impact on the young people, this is a pretty important point that has to be raised to the public very quickly.

02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:45.300
Good, Philip.

02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:48.341
At least Philip is kind of saying it for shit's sake.

02:17:50.001 --> 02:17:51.802
They should know about these issues.

02:17:52.472 --> 02:17:53.112
You and I are aligned.

02:17:53.573 --> 02:17:54.893
And this gets back to the bedrock.

02:17:55.013 --> 02:17:56.514
You and I are aligned.

02:17:57.955 --> 02:18:04.019
I like to talk in a way that normal people can't really understand what the frick I'm saying, so I say stupid shit.

02:18:04.059 --> 02:18:05.960
And it's not even like Yoda stupid.

02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:08.701
It's just big words for nothing stupid.

02:18:09.162 --> 02:18:09.682
Bioethics.

02:18:10.702 --> 02:18:11.523
Fundamental.

02:18:11.543 --> 02:18:13.084
They should know about these issues.

02:18:13.735 --> 02:18:14.375
You and I are aligned.

02:18:14.816 --> 02:18:16.717
And this gets back to the bedrock of bioethics.

02:18:17.737 --> 02:18:24.520
Fundamental principles of bioethics are for an experimental product, which is what these are currently, certainly in the United States.

02:18:25.041 --> 02:18:25.881
Informed consent?

02:18:26.682 --> 02:18:28.022
They're under emergency use authorization.

02:18:28.042 --> 02:18:30.203
They have not been approved yet in the United States.

02:18:30.564 --> 02:18:32.745
I can't speak to, it's a little unclear to me about the status in the UK.

02:18:33.165 --> 02:18:34.125
Informed consent?

02:18:35.246 --> 02:18:39.128
But I firmly believe that the

02:18:39.588 --> 02:18:46.421
I'm of the school as a physician that your patients have the right to understand their disease and understand.

02:18:46.921 --> 02:18:48.324
Understand their disease?

02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.263
Informed consent about transfection?

02:18:53.344 --> 02:18:54.825
Understand their disease?

02:18:55.566 --> 02:18:55.866
What?

02:18:56.307 --> 02:18:58.749
Potential interventions and participated decision-making.

02:18:59.069 --> 02:18:59.630
It's their body.

02:19:00.211 --> 02:19:01.131
Your body doesn't belong to them.

02:19:01.151 --> 02:19:05.416
What is that called, Robert Malone, bioethics expert?

02:19:05.536 --> 02:19:07.057
What is that principle called?

02:19:07.638 --> 02:19:08.779
Informed consent?

02:19:09.159 --> 02:19:09.580
To the state.

02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:24.243
And I'm of the opinion, as you suggest, that full and open disclosure of risks is something that not only can adults process and manage, and should be able to, but I think we're obligated to have that full and open disclosure.

02:19:24.263 --> 02:19:27.963
So you speak now about adolescents, and that's a special case.

02:19:28.523 --> 02:19:30.464
Informed consent for adolescents?

02:19:30.724 --> 02:19:31.204
Bioethically.

02:19:32.264 --> 02:19:34.024
It's a special case bioethically.

02:19:34.044 --> 02:19:38.285
So you speak now about adolescents, and that's a special case bioethically.

02:19:38.982 --> 02:19:48.271
Um, if, if the product is not yet licensed and proven safe in an adolescent or child population, they, by definition, they are not able to provide full informed consent.

02:19:48.651 --> 02:19:49.292
Oh, there it comes.

02:19:49.772 --> 02:19:50.353
There it comes.

02:19:50.693 --> 02:19:53.256
Full, full informed consent by definition.

02:19:53.316 --> 02:19:55.218
They can't, they can't do it.

02:19:56.363 --> 02:19:59.284
Why can adults do it if they don't know anything about it?

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:02.706
Why can adults do it if you don't tell them it's transfection, Robert?

02:20:03.106 --> 02:20:03.466
Consent.

02:20:03.987 --> 02:20:05.528
This is a child population.

02:20:06.048 --> 02:20:09.149
They, by definition, they are not able to provide full informed consent.

02:20:09.509 --> 02:20:10.710
They're not of the age of consent.

02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:12.231
This is fundamental.

02:20:13.411 --> 02:20:24.837
And in the specific case, there are now known disclosed risks in the adolescent population, particularly cardiomyopathy.

02:20:25.649 --> 02:20:28.990
Well, not so long ago, there was strong denial that there were any risks in this population.

02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:35.011
And that was kind of the group consensus and the party line, forgive me, put out by many public health professionals.

02:20:35.691 --> 02:20:43.512
But among other things, the FDA has a absolutely super duper biostatistician, one of the world leaders, he actually is.

02:20:44.192 --> 02:20:47.853
Oh my God, the FDA has a super biostatistician too.

02:20:47.893 --> 02:20:52.294
So not only is one of their high ranking officials totally trustworthy,

02:20:54.875 --> 02:20:57.439
but they've got a super biostatistician too.

02:20:57.499 --> 02:21:01.906
So all the numbers that come out of the FDA are just chef's kiss.

02:21:02.667 --> 02:21:03.789
Holy shit.

02:21:03.849 --> 02:21:06.152
He played by Oracle and he examined a lot of those data.

02:21:06.593 --> 02:21:08.276
He discovered that.

02:21:08.296 --> 02:21:09.418
Did he say Oracle?

02:21:10.902 --> 02:21:14.304
Wasn't, wasn't, isn't Cullen, isn't that guy Cullen?

02:21:14.344 --> 02:21:18.106
Didn't he also work for Oracle and like make the, make the map?

02:21:18.747 --> 02:21:20.027
He's like the map's daddy.

02:21:20.788 --> 02:21:22.269
Didn't he also work for Oracle?

02:21:22.749 --> 02:21:23.389
Holy shit.

02:21:23.409 --> 02:21:24.510
I'm one of the world leaders.

02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:25.631
He actually is employed by Oracle.

02:21:26.531 --> 02:21:32.776
He said Oracle, that's the same company that Colin says he worked for.

02:21:33.196 --> 02:21:39.921
He discovered that there was a safety signal associated with cardiomyopathy in these mRNA vaccine recipients.

02:21:40.502 --> 02:21:42.023
That was then confirmed by the CDC.

02:21:42.043 --> 02:21:46.246
The CDC issued a press announcement and an announcement on their website.

02:21:46.346 --> 02:21:52.571
I received a document from the Maryland Board of Physicians, which is my licensing board, that specifically warned about cardiomyopathy in adolescents.

02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:55.412
I don't understand.

02:21:55.452 --> 02:21:59.073
The biostatistician works for the FDA and also for Oracle?

02:21:59.153 --> 02:22:00.154
I don't get that at all.

02:22:00.194 --> 02:22:00.774
That's weird.

02:22:01.034 --> 02:22:11.279
And then we have an editorial in Science Magazine revealing that everybody's kind of been relying on the Israeli database as the most comprehensive, and much reassurance was taken from the Israelis not having reported anything.

02:22:11.539 --> 02:22:15.020
Yes, Congellon did work at Oracle.

02:22:17.561 --> 02:22:28.749
It's so, it is so funny because supposedly Goodman and Cullen got on a phone call with Mullen, or with Mullen, with Malone and they had a recording of it.

02:22:28.889 --> 02:22:29.690
Oh my gosh.

02:22:31.294 --> 02:22:50.915
Don't also don't forget that at the at the Knoxville CHD inaugural conference I met Charles Rixey and Robert Malone and Robert Malone apparently told Charles Rixey, he didn't tell him this in front of me, but Charles Rixey told me at the conference that Robert Malone remembered him

02:22:51.798 --> 02:22:55.640
Charles and not me from the podcast.

02:22:55.780 --> 02:23:02.924
And that's why he didn't remember me in the hallway and pulled his hand away because he only remembered Rixie.

02:23:05.625 --> 02:23:08.707
And that Rixie was invited to come to his ranch in Virginia.

02:23:09.527 --> 02:23:12.248
He told me three different times that weekend.

02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:17.331
He mentioned it three times during the weekend.

02:23:18.166 --> 02:23:22.733
to make sure I remembered that Robert Malone didn't remember you, but he remembered me and he invited me to the ranch.

02:23:23.915 --> 02:23:29.544
I don't know if anybody watches Charles Rixey and Kevin McCarron regularly, but I wonder if there was any report from the ranch.

02:23:29.605 --> 02:23:30.286
I bet there wasn't.

02:23:31.101 --> 02:23:32.362
to do with the adolescent population.

02:23:32.962 --> 02:23:49.214
At that same conference, Matt Crawford and his wife had dinner with Robert Malone, or had lunch with Robert Malone and his wife, which was really interesting because supposedly they just met, or they didn't know each other, or they just happened to have lunch.

02:23:50.615 --> 02:23:53.016
They confirmed, in fact, they saw the same safety signal.

02:23:54.897 --> 02:23:56.878
It doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence, I'm afraid.

02:23:58.859 --> 02:24:05.142
And it's in this particular population that we've all agreed deserves particular caution and care.

02:24:06.343 --> 02:24:13.587
Now, if I can speak just a moment about cardiomyopathy, because that's us, as you know, among other things associated with autoimmune disease.

02:24:15.513 --> 02:24:16.594
We don't know that that's the cause.

02:24:16.914 --> 02:24:27.078
We're not taking the small number of children, adolescents that have experienced cardiomyopathy and doing cardiac biopsies, which is the kind of thing that's necessary because we generally don't do that and there's a lot of risks associated with it also.

02:24:27.098 --> 02:24:28.479
I just want to share one thing.

02:24:29.819 --> 02:24:32.300
Because I work in this biodefense space, at the time when the U.S.

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:36.402
government, it's an anecdote, okay, so forgive me, has to do with smallpox vaccine.

02:24:36.662 --> 02:24:38.563
And it illustrates kind of the situation, I think, quite well.

02:24:40.555 --> 02:24:41.675
There was a time when the U.S.

02:24:41.715 --> 02:24:50.238
government was concerned about the risk of smallpox being released stateside as a biohazard threat, and they started vaccinating first responders and other healthcare workers.

02:24:50.738 --> 02:24:52.818
This happened during the Bush administration.

02:24:52.858 --> 02:24:54.339
They killed a lot of paramedics.

02:24:54.399 --> 02:24:55.539
This was a pretty big deal.

02:24:55.699 --> 02:25:03.581
And they saw what they believed was an intolerable signal of cardiomyopathy in the vaccinee population.

02:25:04.497 --> 02:25:08.902
And I was tasked, I was working as under contract with the DOD at the time, Department of Defense of the US.

02:25:09.563 --> 02:25:18.673
I was tasked with looking into whether this type of a problem had existed historically during the prior major smallpox eradication campaigns that had occurred historically.

02:25:19.314 --> 02:25:24.519
He had to look into the history of smallpox vaccination for the DOD?

02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:42.309
Did he just say that he was tasked by the DOD as a contractor to look into whether or not previous smallpox vaccination campaigns had a series of adverse events?

02:25:42.649 --> 02:25:46.271
Holy, holy, holy balls.

02:25:49.153 --> 02:25:51.274
Oh my gosh.

02:25:51.374 --> 02:25:55.717
Cardiomyopathy in the vaccine population.

02:25:56.610 --> 02:26:01.031
And I was tasked, I was working as under contract with the DOD at the time, Department of Defense of the US.

02:26:01.692 --> 02:26:10.774
I was tasked with looking into whether this type of a problem had existed historically during the prior major smallpox eradication campaigns that had occurred historically.

02:26:10.974 --> 02:26:13.275
How the hell would he do that?

02:26:15.049 --> 02:26:20.150
You'd have to go to the Vatican or somewhere where they would have the records in order to do something like that.

02:26:20.190 --> 02:26:21.430
I mean, I don't know where you'd go.

02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:30.473
The thing that comes to my mind is like the Da Vinci Code and going to some place where really old records exist.

02:26:30.913 --> 02:26:34.093
The Vatican might have old records about smallpox outbreaks.

02:26:35.214 --> 02:26:36.314
And in fact, the signal was there.

02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:45.139
Soldiers and others, young people in particular, receiving smallpox vaccine had an incidence of cardiomyopathy that was compromising their function.

02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.826
And it was considered an acceptable risk because of the risk-benefit ratio, and that's crucial.

02:26:52.467 --> 02:26:57.352
Because smallpox is so dangerous, it's okay if some people get myocarditis.

02:26:57.853 --> 02:26:58.434
So again,

02:27:00.034 --> 02:27:03.796
I find myself going back to my old encyclopedias over there.

02:27:04.376 --> 02:27:11.860
When I look up in that old encyclopedia from 1894, the smallpox, I don't find the word death.

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:14.261
I don't find the word deadly.

02:27:14.801 --> 02:27:16.482
I don't find the word die.

02:27:16.922 --> 02:27:18.443
I don't find the word killed.

02:27:18.643 --> 02:27:23.886
I don't find any evidence that smallpox was something that a lot of people died of.

02:27:25.287 --> 02:27:26.567
People got pockmarks.

02:27:26.647 --> 02:27:27.588
There were scars.

02:27:27.748 --> 02:27:29.609
People got variolated to it.

02:27:31.271 --> 02:27:34.179
But they don't talk about it like it killed a lot of people.

02:27:35.803 --> 02:27:37.107
Because they don't even use the word.

02:27:40.259 --> 02:27:41.139
It's strange.

02:27:41.239 --> 02:27:44.301
I wonder where, I guess he looked into military records then.

02:27:44.401 --> 02:27:45.862
I guess that's what he had to look at.

02:27:45.962 --> 02:27:49.123
I don't know how long something like that takes.

02:27:49.183 --> 02:27:54.285
I guess you get a few Excel sheets and you do some basic statistics and you're done.

02:27:54.746 --> 02:27:55.026
I don't know.

02:27:55.046 --> 02:27:58.347
I thought the FDA had a really good biostatistician that worked for Oracle.

02:27:58.627 --> 02:28:01.649
Understanding the perspective of the public health community about these signals.

02:28:02.009 --> 02:28:04.710
The thing about the risk-benefit ratio is it's subjective.

02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:05.831
It's in the eye of the beholder.

02:28:07.193 --> 02:28:13.037
And so there's no computer algorithm or machine learning whiz-bang to say, ah, you've crossed the line.

02:28:13.598 --> 02:28:14.999
Now you're over the risk-benefit ratio.

02:28:15.259 --> 02:28:16.580
It's very much a subjective call.

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:21.883
How many times has he said that there's a computer algorithm or an AI that says something?

02:28:21.923 --> 02:28:24.685
I think that's like the fifth time he's kind of dropped that in.

02:28:25.285 --> 02:28:31.670
Now he's saying that there's no AI or computer program that'll tell you when the risk-benefit ratio is correct.

02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:33.151
Interesting.

02:28:33.591 --> 02:28:48.139
You know, I heard a thing that Mark brought up in his stream today about the idea that warfare was actually also being argued that the fastest computers were going to be the people, the countries that would win wars.

02:28:48.779 --> 02:29:01.466
And so, you know, the whole race for computer chips and for microprocessors was fueled by this race, this idea that if they got faster computers than us, then they would be able to beat us.

02:29:03.328 --> 02:29:08.146
If they get the human genome mapped first, then they could beat us for decades.

02:29:10.049 --> 02:29:14.091
And so the same kind of impetus, you know, it's a race against the clock.

02:29:14.152 --> 02:29:15.732
It's a race against the bad guys.

02:29:15.793 --> 02:29:21.136
We got to beat them to the goalpost is how they got us to think we went to the moon.

02:29:21.176 --> 02:29:24.118
It's how they got us to think that we finished the human genome project.

02:29:24.598 --> 02:29:30.802
And it's how they're going to get us to think that we raced to get this mRNA done.

02:29:30.842 --> 02:29:35.845
And now it's finally good once we get the double-stranded DNA out of it and we make it personalized for you.

02:29:36.565 --> 02:29:39.367
And it's pretty much a function of what is the risk of the pathogen in the population.

02:29:39.807 --> 02:30:02.023
So if you were to do a risk-benefit analysis for, say, an RNA vaccine, and you were doing it from the perspective of the Indian regulatory authorities currently, you would be probably responsibly very inclined to tolerate quite a bit of risk in the product because of the risk of death and long-term consequences associated with this variant that's spreading and infecting people in India.

02:30:02.323 --> 02:30:04.545
If you were doing the same analysis from the United States currently,

02:30:05.307 --> 02:30:06.608
as opposed to, say, six months ago.

02:30:07.508 --> 02:30:08.608
The risk-benefit ratio would change.

02:30:08.628 --> 02:30:09.209
Can you appreciate this?

02:30:09.369 --> 02:30:10.049
Yes, I understand.

02:30:10.329 --> 02:30:21.093
So with this adolescent population, it is not my job or pay grade to second guess national public health authorities.

02:30:21.573 --> 02:30:27.696
What I will say is that I am confident in my position in bioethics.

02:30:28.695 --> 02:30:34.737
And that position is while these remain experimental products not yet licensed or fully evaluated in terms of their safety.

02:30:34.897 --> 02:30:35.937
I mean, he said it again.

02:30:36.017 --> 02:30:37.097
It's just incredible.

02:30:42.179 --> 02:30:43.699
It's just absolutely incredible.

02:30:44.859 --> 02:30:50.941
What I will say is that I am confident in my position in bioethics.

02:30:51.937 --> 02:31:14.382
And that position is, while these remain experimental products not yet licensed or fully evaluated in terms of their safety, there is an obligation to fully disclose risks, ensure that those which receive the product are comprehending those risks, and that they have consented in some way to accept those risks which have been fully disclosed and which they have comprehended.

02:31:14.422 --> 02:31:15.922
This is bedrock bioethics.

02:31:16.582 --> 02:31:22.769
And in the case of an adolescent, we have all agreed that adolescents and young people down to, people are talking about two-year-olds.

02:31:23.089 --> 02:31:27.314
And here we are already working the narrative of the Medicare, right?

02:31:27.354 --> 02:31:29.096
Because we need the old people to die.

02:31:29.156 --> 02:31:31.459
So there's no doubt that it's good for old people.

02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:34.102
We're not even discussing that right now.

02:31:35.049 --> 02:31:39.451
Your, your 80 year old grandmother that's been taking care of herself for her whole life.

02:31:39.491 --> 02:31:47.634
She's got a shitter pants and take this shit because it's definitely the risk benefit ratio for her flying AIDS or transfection.

02:31:47.654 --> 02:31:49.034
You better take the transfection.

02:31:49.554 --> 02:31:54.196
That's already a foregone conclusion in June of 2021 with these two monkeys.

02:31:55.757 --> 02:31:57.257
Listen to this very carefully.

02:31:57.897 --> 02:32:01.959
They're barely able to say that, that, that healthy middle-aged people,

02:32:02.978 --> 02:32:06.080
Healthy teenagers, I mean, they're barely able to say that.

02:32:09.021 --> 02:32:10.781
Are not able to provide that informed consent.

02:32:10.801 --> 02:32:26.048
It can only be provided by a responsible adult that's been designated, whether it's their parents or whatever the designation has to do with, the people that have accepted responsibility for decision making on behalf of those adolescents or children.

02:32:26.548 --> 02:32:45.729
And I don't think, while these are still experimental vaccines, I caution that governments and public health professionals that are making these decisions about vaccination of adolescents in an environment where the safety database is evolving.

02:32:47.729 --> 02:32:53.693
And as we've seen, I think they are treading on very thin ice ethically.

02:32:54.193 --> 02:33:06.319
And I really counsel that it's time, past time, for us as a world community and as a public health community to take a good hard look at what we're doing here.

02:33:07.099 --> 02:33:11.422
You know, in crisis, it's easy to convince yourself of the need for extraordinary measures.

02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:15.304
And history is full of examples where we have decided to

02:33:16.204 --> 02:33:23.308
intern ethnic populations or whatever because of perceived risk or allow certain types of medical experimentation on populations.

02:33:23.688 --> 02:33:26.570
The Tuskegee experience in the United States is notorious.

02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:31.353
African-Americans in the United States are still wary of participating in clinical research as a consequence for good reason.

02:33:32.373 --> 02:33:37.036
And I kind of feel like we're in that same kind of ethical

02:33:38.817 --> 02:33:50.190
environment where we have to be very careful and cognizant of the decisions we're making, because in retrospect, we may regret having done so, particularly because it's

02:33:51.573 --> 02:33:56.098
I can say for me it's self-evident that the safety database is evolving.

02:33:57.279 --> 02:34:09.612
I look forward to disclosures from our colleagues in the Scandinavian countries and in the UK that have a well-developed mental health service with more rigorous methodical reporting, unfortunately in the States.

02:34:11.376 --> 02:34:13.918
All of our safety databases are based on self-reporting.

02:34:14.498 --> 02:34:19.642
And the consequence is we have neither a reliable, I'm sorry, I've got to say it, numerator nor denominator.

02:34:20.103 --> 02:34:21.204
You know, we don't know what the.

02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.971
event rate is for these.

02:34:23.071 --> 02:34:28.694
So we don't have a denominator or a numerator before or after the pandemic.

02:34:28.814 --> 02:34:31.556
And so pointing to VAERS is not even a good point.

02:34:32.216 --> 02:34:38.500
And so they're just muddying the water and making sure everybody understands you're not going to figure anything out anytime soon.

02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:40.981
And he's already doing everything he can.

02:34:41.021 --> 02:34:47.966
He's putting his whole, his whole life on the line where other people won't because he's the only one with ethics that he knows of.

02:34:48.506 --> 02:34:51.368
He's the only one he knows that'll put his name to any of these things.

02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:53.351
at least for a couple more weeks.

02:34:56.694 --> 02:34:57.215
It's gross.

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:02.199
Adverse events, the true event rate of among all people vaccinated.

02:35:02.219 --> 02:35:07.324
And we don't really know the number of vaccine recipients in any kind of a rigorous way.

02:35:07.885 --> 02:35:09.346
And these adverse events are self-reported.

02:35:10.487 --> 02:35:15.331
So I don't want to second guess national health authorities and their policy.

02:35:15.592 --> 02:35:16.152
It's not my job.

02:35:16.312 --> 02:35:17.714
It's not my purview.

02:35:18.174 --> 02:35:21.175
But you've been working with them for 20 years.

02:35:21.235 --> 02:35:30.400
You know more than anyone in the room whether or not it's worth being afraid of their propensity to do things incorrectly.

02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:40.724
You just told us a little while ago that with regard to experimental products, it's their job to convince the public that the shots are safe and effective, to get full compliance.

02:35:40.804 --> 02:35:41.705
That's their job.

02:35:42.779 --> 02:35:45.480
Would they murder people and lie about it in order to get it?

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:45.860
Yes.

02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:50.861
Would they put Robert Malone on a stream with international people for years?

02:35:51.501 --> 02:35:54.741
Would they have him tour around the world for years?

02:35:56.302 --> 02:35:57.342
Yes, they would.

02:35:58.622 --> 02:36:04.303
Would they have him tour around with the same people like Pierre Kory and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass?

02:36:04.363 --> 02:36:05.224
Yes, they would.

02:36:06.624 --> 02:36:07.104
And they did.

02:36:11.451 --> 02:36:23.674
I do feel comfortable raising a concern about the underlying bioethics and reiterating that we, in the West at least, we all can agree on these fundamental principles for an unlicensed product that remains experimental.

02:36:24.014 --> 02:36:28.155
There has to be full and open disclosure promptly of risks to the patients in the broadest sense.

02:36:29.355 --> 02:36:40.298
You know, when you're running a clinical trial, that list of risks that are disclosed is those ways- Please do not mistake or forget that he has completely blown off all people that are old.

02:36:41.318 --> 02:36:43.720
Anybody over the age of 60 doesn't give a shit.

02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:56.348
He doesn't think that there's ever going to be any way to confirm whether any of these people were killed by their shots because, you know, a certain number of these people are going to die within a few days of those shots anyway, and you're never going to know because they were going to die anyway.

02:36:57.528 --> 02:37:03.332
So he spent most of this video trying to discredit the idea that we need to even think about whether old people were killed by it.

02:37:03.372 --> 02:37:04.173
They were saved.

02:37:04.613 --> 02:37:09.156
But these younger people, because of myocarditis, it could be riskier for them.

02:37:09.861 --> 02:37:12.362
because you wouldn't want to get myocarditis as a young guy.

02:37:12.402 --> 02:37:16.743
But I mean, myocarditis is a pretty low risk for somebody who's 60 years old.

02:37:18.624 --> 02:37:20.545
You know, clotting and stuff like that.

02:37:20.625 --> 02:37:25.747
And you know, maybe a little autoimmune reaction to your endothelium when you're 80 or whatever, that's no big deal.

02:37:27.187 --> 02:37:29.128
Ladies and gentlemen, please see this.

02:37:29.208 --> 02:37:33.049
This is some of the most malevolent footage I have ever watched.

02:37:33.809 --> 02:37:35.890
It has had so many home runs in it.

02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:37.991
So many disturbing things about it.

02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:42.342
Even this little admission here that he worked for the D.O.D.

02:37:42.422 --> 02:37:46.564
and had to look at previous smallpox vaccinations.

02:37:49.306 --> 02:37:51.207
He's talking about A.I.

02:37:51.327 --> 02:37:57.131
and he's talking about learning, machine learning and all this other crap.

02:37:58.294 --> 02:38:02.635
I'm sorry, but I think Mark hit a home run today with the Department of Energy.

02:38:03.295 --> 02:38:09.596
Because that article, that little coverage there, actually tied together all kinds of stuff.

02:38:09.796 --> 02:38:14.077
Mainly, why in the hell is the Department of Energy involved in the first place?

02:38:14.217 --> 02:38:14.537
Why?

02:38:15.017 --> 02:38:20.838
Because they have the absolute airtight secret compartment called nuclear weapons.

02:38:21.438 --> 02:38:26.779
So anything at the DOE, the Department of Energy, that's classified gets classified real good.

02:38:28.029 --> 02:38:29.595
They're already really good at it.

02:38:32.847 --> 02:38:35.649
And they prioritized, what two things in that article?

02:38:35.689 --> 02:38:50.901
They prioritized supercomputer chips or some shit, microprocessors, and the mapping, not the sequencing of, because sequencing of the human genome is not useful because everybody's genome is relatively unique.

02:38:51.302 --> 02:38:57.326
Even though in that article, they said specifically, and I even wrote it down because I thought it was so funny when I was listening to him.

02:38:59.328 --> 02:38:59.888
They said,

02:39:02.705 --> 02:39:03.426
Where did I write it?

02:39:03.466 --> 02:39:04.987
I wrote it somewhere over here.

02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:14.294
But they said that most of the genome, most of the parts of the genome are the same across people.

02:39:14.515 --> 02:39:15.275
It's ridiculous.

02:39:15.335 --> 02:39:16.536
That's absolutely absurd.

02:39:17.777 --> 02:39:32.009
And in fact, the little tiny differences are probably what makes us all very unique and makes us very difficult to understand as a single pattern integrity, you know, generalized across multiple birds.

02:39:33.234 --> 02:39:39.496
It's easier to study an inbred mouse line than it is to study an outbred population of human beings.

02:39:41.897 --> 02:39:44.237
And if that's not an understatement, I don't know how to make one.

02:39:47.258 --> 02:39:53.380
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a concerted effort for more than 20 years to set us up for this inversion.

02:39:54.461 --> 02:39:58.742
And they knew they needed this technology and all the technologies that complement it.

02:40:00.567 --> 02:40:15.145
And just like Mark showed us earlier today that the DOE, the Department of Energy made the argument that very soon, very soon war was going to be taken over by AI and computers.

02:40:15.205 --> 02:40:18.569
And so we needed to get the fastest computers before the Russians did.

02:40:19.537 --> 02:40:24.339
We needed to get the smartest computers before the bad guys do the Chinese or whatever.

02:40:25.199 --> 02:40:33.363
The exact same argument in that article was made for what for sequencing or mapping the human genome.

02:40:33.383 --> 02:40:37.705
We have to get it before they get it so that we can be ahead of them for decades.

02:40:40.366 --> 02:40:45.008
The crazy thing is, is that those two, those two technologies might've been complimentary.

02:40:47.008 --> 02:40:53.031
Because they knew that in order to sequence the genome they were going to need the computing power to pull off these algorithmic tricks.

02:40:56.973 --> 02:41:04.997
And just processing the data alone would be impossible for the computers at the time when they were trying to envision how the human genome might even be cracked.

02:41:07.853 --> 02:41:24.268
And the more that they got to understand what the human genome had in store for them, and the more variability that they found there, the more impossibility they found there, the more they understood that the main thing that would ever hold them back after they collected the data would be the computer that would process it.

02:41:27.785 --> 02:41:32.327
And so the imagination that they had already 20 years ago was absolutely correct.

02:41:32.367 --> 02:41:34.768
They knew that they would need both of these technologies.

02:41:34.808 --> 02:41:49.114
They would need to focus on the mapping and the sequencing to get a headstart, to get the data ready, to get people ready, to get the technology ready, to collect the data that they would feed to the computers that would eventually be strong enough to crack the code.

02:41:49.534 --> 02:41:50.555
Don't you understand?

02:41:50.935 --> 02:41:55.917
That's the exact goddang slide that I put up every single day.

02:42:01.724 --> 02:42:03.886
It's this exact same slide.

02:42:06.148 --> 02:42:09.812
It is computers solving the human genome.

02:42:11.234 --> 02:42:16.439
And so all the way back then, when Mark was reading this paper, they already knew this article.

02:42:16.479 --> 02:42:19.582
They already knew that they would need the computers to do the data.

02:42:20.142 --> 02:42:25.488
These two things were exactly the same goal, exactly the same impetus.

02:42:31.058 --> 02:42:45.042
We are at a magnificent turning point, ladies and gentlemen, because the work of two very tiny little patriotic Americans has finally synergistically led to some higher understanding, perhaps, of what's really going on here.

02:42:45.762 --> 02:42:51.544
By carefully looking at the history, by carefully trying to follow the mentorship of these ideas,

02:42:52.364 --> 02:43:01.570
we have probably just today stumbled upon some better understanding of how these ideas were brought together and by who they were brought together.

02:43:04.132 --> 02:43:17.340
Not only that, but on the side dish served over here as a appetizer is the idea that all these experts on the Epstein network haven't been able to say Bill Barr's name!

02:43:18.001 --> 02:43:20.062
Never go into Bill Barr's family!

02:43:23.496 --> 02:43:27.519
And Mark's been trying to get somebody to pay attention to Bill Barr for a couple years now.

02:43:27.939 --> 02:43:34.905
I remember one of the first videos that I ever watched of Mark that actually impressed the shit out of me was about Bill Barr.

02:43:41.325 --> 02:43:45.586
Let's watch this last little bit, and then we will wrap this amazing show up.

02:43:45.686 --> 02:43:48.167
Down into the weeds, just like it does in a package insert.

02:43:48.647 --> 02:43:51.608
And so we have to disclose.

02:43:51.628 --> 02:43:52.888
I think we're obligated to.

02:43:53.188 --> 02:43:55.409
We have to ensure that the public comprehends that disclosure.

02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:56.409
We have to put it in paper.

02:43:56.429 --> 02:44:07.132
Oh my gosh, the supercomputer in WarGames is named Joshua because Joshua Lederberg was a consultant on the game WarGames Movie.

02:44:09.835 --> 02:44:10.956
I've got goosebumps.

02:44:11.056 --> 02:44:16.361
My whole legs are just... All the hair on my legs is standing up right now.

02:44:18.684 --> 02:44:19.404
We just won.

02:44:20.946 --> 02:44:21.987
Don't you understand?

02:44:23.548 --> 02:44:24.409
It just happened.

02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:30.155
Joshua Lederberg was an advisor on the War Games movie.

02:44:32.157 --> 02:44:33.198
They always knew.

02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:39.774
That slide of mine is so relevant, I didn't even know it.

02:44:40.895 --> 02:44:42.096
It's so magical.

02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:49.202
And how long has this been a slide in my deck?

02:44:50.223 --> 02:44:52.745
How long has Mark been chasing these leads down?

02:44:53.846 --> 02:44:59.211
How long have we been joking about Joshua being the computer of war games?

02:45:01.857 --> 02:45:17.041
And then Mark just does another show today and reads another article and then Jay does another show today and watches another video and... There goes the whole illusion.

02:45:24.494 --> 02:45:25.495
and not obfuscate it.

02:45:26.156 --> 02:45:29.960
And we have to have a process in which they are consenting.

02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:39.630
I believe firmly the state, in the West at least, does not have the authorization to compel vaccination or administration of an experimental product, full stop.

02:45:39.690 --> 02:45:41.592
And I'm not shy about saying that.

02:45:41.952 --> 02:45:42.973
He's not saying anything.

02:45:43.014 --> 02:45:47.620
They don't have the data to compel anybody, but they can coerce them with Joe Rogan.

02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:50.463
They can coerce them with Brett Weinstein.

02:45:50.483 --> 02:45:52.045
They can coerce them with The View.

02:45:52.446 --> 02:45:55.089
They can coerce them with Sam Harris.

02:45:55.470 --> 02:45:58.915
They can coerce them with a confusing nutcase like you two.

02:46:01.206 --> 02:46:17.080
You can confuse them with Kevin McCairn, and Charles Rixey, and Jessica Rose, and Peter McCullough, and Pierre Cory, and Jessica Hockett, and Jonathan Engler, and The Heart Group, and Claire Craig, and you can confuse them with all these people.

02:46:20.362 --> 02:46:22.004
And then the choice will be pretty difficult.

02:46:23.061 --> 02:46:23.501
Absolutely.

02:46:23.541 --> 02:46:25.902
Listen, Robert, we could talk for hours about these things.

02:46:26.262 --> 02:46:31.663
I think this has been a truly enthralling discussion, and I'm looking forward to having more of them.

02:46:31.743 --> 02:46:48.187
But this is, in truth, probably one of the most important discussions in terms of its timing and in terms of the relevance to what people may choose to do and what governments and public health officials may need to do in order for us to have a truly safe and good practice going forward for health.

02:46:48.727 --> 02:46:50.227
So I want to thank you again, Robert,

02:46:50.727 --> 02:46:52.149
and I really appreciate the time.

02:46:52.169 --> 02:46:56.914
I look forward to speaking to you again, and I hope everyone watching has enjoyed this as much as I have.

02:46:57.374 --> 02:46:58.195
Thank you very much, Robert.

02:46:58.476 --> 02:47:04.322
Bye-bye, and thank you for the opportunity and for your interest, and I look forward to learning from your research also, okay?

02:47:04.342 --> 02:47:04.482
Bye-bye.

02:47:05.423 --> 02:47:09.107
I look forward to learning from your research also.

02:47:09.127 --> 02:47:10.809
What a bunch of jackasses.

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:19.924
The way they are pulling this off is by not talking about 2020 and 2021.

02:47:20.765 --> 02:47:21.165
That was from 2021.

02:47:21.626 --> 02:47:24.269
So that was a year later.

02:47:24.289 --> 02:47:27.192
A year after this already started.

02:47:27.252 --> 02:47:31.778
A year after we let our kids go back to college.

02:47:31.818 --> 02:47:33.420
Almost a year after I said stop.

02:47:36.792 --> 02:47:51.123
The faith is a lie, ladies and gentlemen, and the faith was actually laid down by an illusion of consensus created by people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose and Pierre Kory.

02:47:55.187 --> 02:48:00.671
A consensus about the worst case scenario being a gain-of-function laboratory virus that might go endemic.

02:48:02.557 --> 02:48:19.332
And that illusion of consensus is what coerced a lot of people into accepting transfection as an investigational vaccine, instead of realizing, instead of being informed that transfection is the only way that RNA virology can really be accomplished.

02:48:23.696 --> 02:48:25.237
And if we just break this down,

02:48:28.143 --> 02:48:36.710
My family has just sat down in the plane to Amsterdam after a seven hour wait in Detroit.

02:48:38.031 --> 02:48:47.038
So I'm actually extremely happy right now that they're finally on the plane and they're gonna watch a few movies and then be in their house of grandma very soon.

02:48:47.058 --> 02:48:53.543
So I'm very excited that they're going and let me assure you, I'm not gonna waste any of this time alone.

02:48:54.764 --> 02:48:56.165
I'm gonna be doing a lot of work.

02:48:57.785 --> 02:49:01.628
Look, if you think about it like a cassette tape, RNA is not perfect.

02:49:01.788 --> 02:49:03.650
RNA can't be copied perfectly.

02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:09.695
It's, uh, even if you've got the best dubbing cassette player, you can't make good copies of a cassette tape.

02:49:10.316 --> 02:49:14.199
And so that's very similar to, you really can't grow RNA in a dish.

02:49:14.299 --> 02:49:18.262
You can't grow it in a cell culture, but you can sequence it.

02:49:18.563 --> 02:49:20.965
And if you sequence it, hold on, I'm going to start this again.

02:49:21.585 --> 02:49:22.726
You can sequence it.

02:49:24.928 --> 02:49:25.929
And if you sequence it,

02:49:28.285 --> 02:49:29.465
you can make DNA of it.

02:49:30.526 --> 02:49:32.946
And that's pretty standard molecular biology.

02:49:32.986 --> 02:49:39.048
If they make DNA of it, you can think of that like a CD because you can make copies of DNA and we know lots of different ways to do it.

02:49:39.668 --> 02:49:51.991
We have special technology printing ways of doing it and we also have more traditional ways of doing it that involve circular DNA molecules that are copied by a very handy dandy bacterial culture.

02:49:52.728 --> 02:50:10.111
And in fact, there are videos of Inovio making the spike protein using the same technology, bacterial culture, making the DNA, then making the bacterial culture, make a copy of it, and then they convert that DNA to RNA, and then that RNA to spike protein.

02:50:11.069 --> 02:50:19.338
And there's lots of different ways to do it, cell culture, electroporation, RNA polymerase made by a commercial process.

02:50:19.378 --> 02:50:28.367
But any way you do it, if you put this RNA or this DNA on a cell culture or into an animal, you're already doing virology.

02:50:30.149 --> 02:50:33.132
That's most of the time how virology is done.

02:50:33.572 --> 02:50:44.642
And, in fact, these processes are very translatable and, in fact, already in use to make pharmaceutical products called biologics, proteins.

02:50:45.683 --> 02:50:49.166
Any protein that's made as a drug is made in this fashion.

02:50:50.069 --> 02:50:54.191
And that's what Brian Artis' presentation at the Red Pill Conference was about.

02:50:54.371 --> 02:51:06.416
Except, as he was telling everybody that they're making kilotons of venom, he didn't bother to explain to them that they're making that venom using synthetic DNA and RNA in culture.

02:51:08.055 --> 02:51:21.940
And that means that Jonathan Cooley is right because if they can make these infectious DNA clones in small quantities and share them with other virology labs, then they can also make them in large quantities because it's the exact same process.

02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:29.362
And pharmaceutical companies all around the world already have gigantic factories that use this process to make other things.

02:51:34.881 --> 02:51:45.610
And so if you just tell the story correctly, you can just say that, well, synthetic RNA in quantity can be used to transform or transfect cell cultures or animals, and that's virology.

02:51:46.851 --> 02:51:53.057
And that means that virology can be done on an industrial scale very easily using existing technology.

02:51:53.917 --> 02:52:01.364
Existing technology that Kevin McKernan is an expert in, and that's why they had to put him in place early to control the narrative about it.

02:52:02.824 --> 02:52:06.565
That's why he was on my stream twice to try and control the narrative about it.

02:52:06.605 --> 02:52:08.385
That's why I was on a St.

02:52:08.425 --> 02:52:13.426
Patrick's Day podcast in 2023 to try and control the narrative about it.

02:52:13.886 --> 02:52:19.468
And that's why he turned into a complete asshole to me because he's trying to control the narrative about it.

02:52:19.528 --> 02:52:24.489
And since he can't argue the biology with me, then he's got to attribute bad motives to me.

02:52:25.969 --> 02:52:29.630
That's why he was selected to be part of this Senate committee and not me.

02:52:30.677 --> 02:52:31.937
because they don't want the truth.

02:52:32.057 --> 02:52:38.039
They are controlling a narrative so that we teach our kids the mythology of gain-of-function viruses.

02:52:38.579 --> 02:52:40.880
This is one of the worst traitors in America.

02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:44.681
Pierre Khoury is one of the worst traitors in America.

02:52:45.321 --> 02:52:55.004
And if I'm wrong, then he should do something about that and tell us the truth about why he did what he did, said what he did, and why and where he was at all those times in 2020.

02:52:55.744 --> 02:52:57.585
Don't ask him what he was doing in 2020.

02:52:57.645 --> 02:52:58.805
Remember, he's on that team.

02:53:00.816 --> 02:53:06.861
Ladies and gentlemen, intravascular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:53:07.541 --> 02:53:12.085
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:53:12.765 --> 02:53:20.971
Of course, there are other ways to say it, but any way you say it, this is an illusion and we are being controlled by the theater of it.

02:53:21.732 --> 02:53:23.774
The crazy part is who the players are.

02:53:23.794 --> 02:53:28.860
It was very easy to think that Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci were players.

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:39.071
It's a little harder to see that Bill Barr is a player, or that Ron Klain is a player, or that Averill Haynes is a player, especially when none of these people will say their names.

02:53:40.862 --> 02:53:48.266
It's a little harder to see that these ideas probably descend from World War II experimentation.

02:53:49.067 --> 02:54:00.593
It's hard to see that these ideas descend from a combination of impetuses in the Department of Energy, hidden behind the nuke cabinet.

02:54:01.909 --> 02:54:08.316
But, you know, if you pay attention to Mark Housatonic Live and you pay attention to GigaOM Biological, you might make it to the end.

02:54:08.797 --> 02:54:17.886
Ladies and gentlemen, transfection in healthy humans was always a stupid idea and they're still trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary with all these dumb

02:54:18.787 --> 02:54:21.028
versions, including the new flu vaccine.

02:54:21.768 --> 02:54:26.030
If you liked what you saw, please share the stream here at stream.GigaOM.bio.

02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:37.695
And if you have the means and you're impressed enough, and you're not doing it already, which I thank everyone who is, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

02:54:38.335 --> 02:54:39.896
We need all the support we can get.

02:54:39.936 --> 02:54:45.717
There's been a few people who have been floating this boat for a couple years now and they can't do it for much longer.

02:54:45.797 --> 02:54:51.238
So we need some more people to pick up the slack and you know, even $10 a month.

02:54:51.478 --> 02:54:55.980
I know it's a lot to ask of some people, but if you have the means, it would be great.

02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:58.580
And all of us would appreciate it very much.

02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:01.401
Thank you very much for joining me and I'll see you again soon.

02:55:04.125 --> 02:55:06.208
supposed to be the music here is still going out.

02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:10.135
I wonder if anybody can guess why I keep playing this.

02:55:10.936 --> 02:55:15.764
But anyway, we're on a mission from God, ladies and gentlemen.

02:55:16.685 --> 02:55:17.226
Don't forget.

02:55:45.765 --> 02:55:47.306
I'm not sure about Broken Science.

02:55:47.786 --> 02:55:48.426
I think so.

02:55:48.686 --> 02:55:54.768
I want to believe, but nobody in Broken Science supports GigaOM Biological.

02:55:56.088 --> 02:56:00.870
No one at Broken Science supports GigaOM Biological.

02:56:02.351 --> 02:56:09.453
I have been invited to their meetings and I participate in their meetings, but no one at that place

02:56:10.487 --> 02:56:14.091
is a subscriber, not even at $10 a month, just so you know.

02:56:14.412 --> 02:56:17.155
I mean, it doesn't say anything, but it kind of does say something.

02:56:18.416 --> 02:56:21.119
I love you all very much and I will see you again tomorrow, of course.

02:56:21.359 --> 02:56:21.640
Bye-bye.
