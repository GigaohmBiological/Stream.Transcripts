WEBVTT

00:55.509 --> 00:56.109
good benefits.

00:57.230 --> 00:59.972
And I was getting attacked, there's hit jobs in the media.

01:00.552 --> 01:11.179
And he wrote me this email and he said, Dear Dr. Corey, what they're doing to ivermectin, they've been doing to vitamin D for decades, and included a link to an article called the disinformation playbook.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.361
And it's got five tactics.

01:13.601 --> 01:20.986
And these are the five tactics that all industries employ, when science emerges, that's inconvenient to their interest.

01:21.638 --> 01:22.738
So I'm just going to give you an example.

01:22.898 --> 01:29.200
Ivermectin science was extremely inconvenient to the interest of the pharmaceutical industrial complex.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.721
I mean, it threatened the vaccine campaign, it threatened vaccine hesitancy, which was public enemy number one.

01:34.761 --> 01:42.063
We know that, that everything, all the propaganda and censorship was literally going after something called vaccine hesitancy.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.104
I experienced vaccine hesitancy myself.

01:45.084 --> 01:47.266
It's a terrible condition, or life-saving.

01:47.286 --> 01:48.447
I'm so grateful for it.

01:49.527 --> 02:02.176
It could be a life-saving condition, but they deployed this information and I didn't understand what was going on, Tucker, because when I, for instance, I gave testimony in a Senate hearing for the first time in May of 2020.

02:02.336 --> 02:04.197
Nothing to do with ivermectin.

02:04.497 --> 02:09.361
I just said it was critically important that corticosteroids be used in the hospital phase of the disease.

02:10.171 --> 02:13.332
I was attacked widely for saying that, even by my own university.

02:13.352 --> 02:14.913
They did not want me talking to the press.

02:15.273 --> 02:18.115
And that was based on the expert opinion of my group.

02:18.295 --> 02:19.595
Humberto Maduri was one of them.

02:19.635 --> 02:22.677
Like I said, one of the world experts in lung injury and corticosteroids.

02:23.297 --> 02:24.317
Myself and Paul.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.378
And we were validated.

02:26.458 --> 02:32.681
Because two months later, a trial came out of Oxford showing that huge mortality reductions when you use corticosteroids.

02:32.721 --> 02:34.702
And now it's the standard of care worldwide.

02:43.547 --> 02:57.077
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge in the general poor health of the of America of the American people is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

02:57.217 --> 02:59.159
I don't know crash the dollar.

02:59.359 --> 03:04.262
I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value we have left.

03:04.483 --> 03:07.545
I don't know But I know for sure

03:07.932 --> 03:25.358
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

03:27.478 --> 03:34.224
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

03:34.644 --> 03:37.687
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

03:37.767 --> 03:47.215
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

03:47.235 --> 03:53.841
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

04:17.365 --> 04:17.445
do

08:06.302 --> 08:06.382
you

09:05.501 --> 09:19.032
On the rare chance that there's somebody out there with that particular musical taste, that is Edgar Meyer on bass, Yo-Yo Ma on cello, Joshua Bell on violin, and Mark O'Connor on guitar.

09:19.072 --> 09:25.877
And I believe there might even be somebody playing a mandolin that I missed there.

09:25.938 --> 09:28.780
But anyway, that would have then been Sam Bush.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.143
And that was on the album called The Essential Joshua Bell.

09:33.844 --> 09:34.905
That's my air conditioner.

09:59.397 --> 10:01.338
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

10:02.459 --> 10:07.182
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.304
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

10:11.937 --> 10:12.644
It's embarrassing.

10:44.718 --> 10:44.779
you

11:18.101 --> 11:32.627
I'm gonna have to see how I made that audio recording of that song because it's overloaded at the end and I don't know why.

11:32.707 --> 11:34.008
It's clipping or whatever.

11:34.981 --> 11:50.609
and doesn't sound ideal and it's also somehow or another still copyrighted so a lot of a lot of social media platforms won't let that music play anyway so although it is really nostalgic and nice to hear it makes that video somewhat limiting welcome to the show and

11:52.450 --> 12:08.643
For anybody that's watching live right now or watching recorded later, the next five minutes might be something you want to turn your camera off for because I'm going to give you a little visual evidence for why I wasn't on the stream yesterday and the day before and the day before that.

12:09.323 --> 12:12.125
I woke up I think in the middle of the night on Friday.

12:12.145 --> 12:16.168
I'm trying to think of what day it is and where we are in the week here.

12:17.049 --> 12:21.258
My family's almost coming back, but I feel like I've been on an expedition of some sort.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.577
I don't know, some kind of biosphere experiment.

12:27.479 --> 12:30.842
And if I look terrible, it's because I have actually been sick for quite a few days.

12:30.902 --> 12:32.384
So it's Monday, August 5th.

12:32.544 --> 12:44.376
I believe on Friday, I woke up thinking I had a bad night's sleep, and that I had muscle aches, and I was stretching a lot in the middle of the night, and I was warm and cold.

12:45.037 --> 12:46.398
And I thought, wow, I'm getting sick.

12:47.304 --> 12:53.768
And then all day Friday, I sat in this chair and I was reading and there were other things that were going on that needed my attention.

12:55.189 --> 13:03.474
We hadn't paid our electric bill because V is over in Europe and she's the one who logs in there and then we couldn't get her login to work over there.

13:03.494 --> 13:03.914
It doesn't matter.

13:04.694 --> 13:12.319
Anyway, I was doing a lot of other things this weekend and then Friday afternoon, by Friday afternoon, I was just not feeling very well, so I got in my bed.

13:13.402 --> 13:16.065
And no, no, that's wait, that's Friday night.

13:16.145 --> 13:19.068
So I think it was Thursday night that I woke up and didn't feel good.

13:19.449 --> 13:28.819
Thursday all day, I worked, was doing other things, went to bed on Thursday night and woke up on Friday and I had a terrible night on Friday night.

13:29.778 --> 13:37.266
But when I was sitting in my chair on Friday and got up to like go eat or I don't remember what time it was.

13:37.306 --> 13:38.727
It was like 630 in the night.

13:39.588 --> 13:46.475
I realized that my leg was red and swollen and I had had that problem before because I have this one

13:48.069 --> 13:58.057
for all the people collecting baseball cards at home, I maybe mentioned it before, I have this one little patch of indestructible eczema on my leg that never goes away.

13:58.097 --> 14:08.925
That last year, the year before I got cellulitis underneath the skin, you know, you get an infection that gets broken and then it's very easy if you don't keep it clean, yada, yada, yada.

14:08.965 --> 14:11.907
I had a swollen leg a couple of years ago already

14:14.029 --> 14:18.771
And as soon as I realized what was going on down there on Friday, I was like, okay, what do I do?

14:18.871 --> 14:19.791
And here we are.

14:22.213 --> 14:41.502
Jonathan Cooey, who has been working for academia his whole life, the one, let's say, thing in the good column of working for universities, especially universities that are attached to hospitals, is usually for a fairly good price per month, you can get your family ridiculously good coverage.

14:42.623 --> 14:50.129
And so I'm kind of used to just being able to go to the doctor and then it suddenly dawns on me on Friday afternoon at 6.30 that I don't have a doctor.

14:50.149 --> 14:51.150
I don't have insurance.

14:52.471 --> 14:55.534
And I got to figure out a way to get antibiotics.

14:55.614 --> 14:56.454
How do I do that?

14:56.534 --> 15:01.258
Well, in Pittsburgh on the South side, there's a very limited options.

15:01.338 --> 15:08.244
And so I went through a few of those not to delineate them here and figured out that I wasn't going to get antibiotics on Friday night.

15:09.301 --> 15:16.831
So I went to bed again on Friday night, wrapped up, put on some sweatpants, drank a lot of water and just said, here I go.

15:17.031 --> 15:22.218
And I went to bed and I sweat through all my clothes and I got up in the morning and I thought I was feeling better.

15:24.524 --> 15:29.068
But I had some friends that gave me the contact of a dermatologist.

15:29.128 --> 15:36.273
I did a little virtual visit over Zoom and she said that I should definitely go seek help.

15:36.313 --> 15:37.875
And so I went to a little clinic here.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.317
I paid $200 cash.

15:41.578 --> 15:45.020
I saw a doctor for five minutes who said I should go to the emergency room.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.642
I said, I'm not going to the emergency room.

15:46.682 --> 15:48.643
I feel much better today than I did yesterday.

15:48.703 --> 15:50.485
I should have gone to the emergency room yesterday.

15:51.388 --> 15:51.688
didn't.

15:52.929 --> 15:54.010
My leg is swollen.

15:54.130 --> 15:57.913
I mean, it's painful everywhere, but I know I'm a lot better now than I was before.

15:58.493 --> 16:00.154
Just give me some antibiotics and I'll be fine.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.235
He didn't really want to do it.

16:02.596 --> 16:07.199
But he did and I got the prescription and things are feeling better now.

16:07.379 --> 16:17.567
But when I show you my leg, understand that this is the two days after the worst swelling and it encompassed most of my lower leg and the pain went from

16:18.347 --> 16:21.808
The lymph node in my groin through every lymph node.

16:21.948 --> 16:40.273
I could have drawn it out with a With a with a sharpie on my legs what lymph nodes were swollen and not lymph nodes But what lymph vessels and where they went and they all came from the lymph node in my groin And if I show you my leg right now, don't be freaked out but

16:41.940 --> 16:46.143
but it was in the front of my shin here and it was back here.

16:47.164 --> 16:54.230
And it came in through this little piece of eczema here, which actually looks better than it ever has in a long time.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.991
So I don't know, it still hurts.

16:57.292 --> 17:00.255
It still feels like it needs to go a little bit.

17:00.495 --> 17:03.217
And so that's nobody's fault.

17:03.257 --> 17:05.559
It just, you see the,

17:06.727 --> 17:25.128
The point I'm trying to make is that I, as a person who doesn't go to the doctor very often or think much about his health, other than how I have to exercise and eat, when I really need to seek help, it becomes quite striking, actually, in the United States, the options that are available to people.

17:26.411 --> 17:32.795
And oftentimes, it's like go to the ER is the first thing that people say, they don't even want to bother treating you.

17:33.615 --> 17:38.398
And it's, I, you know, I could still lose my leg in theory, knock on wood.

17:40.499 --> 17:41.720
But, but I don't.

17:43.416 --> 17:51.960
I don't think that a lot of times, a lot of us are sort of free from having to consider how easy it is.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.381
In contrast, I'll just give you a very big contrast.

17:56.301 --> 18:11.928
We noticed that when we went to the hospital for the first time in Norway, which was to have our first child, we noticed that on the door of the hospital in eight different languages, it says that health care is free for everyone in Norway.

18:12.688 --> 18:14.550
irrespective of how you arrived here.

18:16.352 --> 18:23.159
Now, keep in mind, that's a country of 7 million people, it's running a deficit that has more natural resources than they know what to dig.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.661
And, and yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

18:25.701 --> 18:27.243
They're fisheries, yada, yada, yada.

18:27.263 --> 18:30.687
They, of course, they have plenty of resources for the few people that come there.

18:31.427 --> 18:31.908
And, and

18:32.208 --> 18:33.489
decide to try and live there.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.489
And it's still very difficult to emigrate there.

18:35.529 --> 18:38.110
So if you're there as a tourist, they don't really want to hear it.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.471
They just want you to get get treatment, of course.

18:40.511 --> 18:42.072
And if you're there as a visitor, yada yada.

18:42.232 --> 18:47.674
Anyway, it's very different than here where on Friday, I could tell them what I needed.

18:47.854 --> 18:51.516
I could tell and the only thing they said was we don't have appointments go to the ER.

18:52.416 --> 18:55.939
And without insurance going to the ER, I think that's a pretty big gamble.

18:56.440 --> 18:56.980
So I didn't.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.141
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

18:58.161 --> 19:03.926
I used to be a patch clamp physiologist, which means that I was an academic, an academician.

19:03.946 --> 19:05.207
I wanted to get tenure.

19:06.048 --> 19:09.031
I was writing grants, although I wasn't extremely successful at it.

19:09.971 --> 19:14.816
I did experiments that can be represented by this micrograph over here where I recorded from pairs or

19:15.476 --> 19:27.827
quadruplets of neurons and tried to understand how they were synaptically connected and whether or not the differences in the short-term dynamics of those synapses had any implications for the behavior that these circuits were thought to underlie.

19:28.928 --> 19:37.916
You can find my sort of record here on PubMed if you go to C-O-U-E-Y with a hyphen and then J-J and just hit enter.

19:38.436 --> 19:40.238
All the papers that come up should have me on them.

19:41.363 --> 19:48.234
And then if you sort them, you know, by date or, or by relevance or whatever, there's, I don't know, there's 20 papers or something like that.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.398
And you can kind of figure out what I was doing with my life.

19:51.161 --> 19:57.585
before I realized that, wow, I didn't understand very much about immunology.

19:57.665 --> 20:01.908
I didn't understand very much about RNA virology or bioweapons or anything like that.

20:02.549 --> 20:13.876
And at the start of the pandemic, I would never would have even come close to being able to codify the biology that I understood at that time so succinctly.

20:13.976 --> 20:20.961
Even if I would have said that, you know, RNA can pandemic and gain of function viruses are defined by X, Y, and Z, I wouldn't have had that

20:21.822 --> 20:22.262
idea.

20:23.163 --> 20:27.146
I would never have had that presumption because I was an akademagician.

20:27.206 --> 20:34.892
I was very... I understood that when I was on my bike talking about coronaviruses, I was doing it very safely because I'm a neurobiologist.

20:34.912 --> 20:35.312
Who am I?

20:35.372 --> 20:38.995
I did 20 bike rides before this about neurobiology.

20:39.035 --> 20:41.377
I'm not trying to pretend like I'm a virologist.

20:42.018 --> 20:45.541
And the reaction to it propelled me into this

20:46.741 --> 20:57.325
into this mystery solving exercise that has culminated in me being basically an outcast from academia and an outcast from the dissident movement.

20:58.165 --> 21:09.949
And because I guess nobody wants to address the very simple points that I'd like them to address, which is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

21:10.830 --> 21:11.930
And it always has been.

21:12.952 --> 21:23.201
The previous vaccines in some ways may have been less dangerous and less of a Russian roulette than what transfection and transformation in healthy humans represents.

21:23.261 --> 21:25.684
And that's why the second statement is there in the first place.

21:26.621 --> 21:38.246
And RNA cannot pandemic or the reflexive or the reflection, more probably what somebody like Buckminster Fuller would say, viruses are not pattern integrities.

21:38.286 --> 21:39.026
They're just not.

21:39.106 --> 21:49.310
And so the idea that they can sweep the world and go exponential and all these other things that people have so ham-fistedly used and attributed to them is just ridiculous.

21:50.353 --> 21:51.194
They are not life.

21:51.754 --> 21:58.539
So you can't attribute all of these magical qualities that pre heretofore were only attributable to patterned integrities.

21:58.559 --> 21:59.239
You just can't.

22:01.901 --> 22:06.665
And so I really think it's vital that your family and friends, what the...

22:10.233 --> 22:23.958
that your family and friends, darn, that wasn't very good, that your family and friends understand that the core illusion here, and I'm really sorry about that air conditioner in the background, the core illusion here, when it gets cool enough, I'll turn it off.

22:24.678 --> 22:25.599
I'll say it one more time.

22:25.659 --> 22:31.181
The core illusion here is that there was a mystery virus and that we can attribute excess deaths to it.

22:32.253 --> 22:53.907
And so the reason why I show this graph often is because in yellow, you see the calculated, not the measured or the tested flu deaths, but the calculated flu deaths per year, starting in no earlier than 2014 and the flu season and going all the way through to the end of the 2021 flu season.

22:56.923 --> 23:07.290
And what you see here is that the calculated number of flu deaths is quite small relative to the known number of pneumonia deaths.

23:08.431 --> 23:12.313
It's between, you know, 2,500 and 5,000 people per week in America, and suddenly those deaths

23:18.447 --> 23:23.509
even by their own numbers, have sometimes as much as tripled during the pandemic.

23:23.549 --> 23:31.653
And then behind that, in perfect harmony, is this pink additional overlay that is supposed to be COVID deaths.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.494
And this is the way that we were shown the data.

23:34.534 --> 23:39.517
This is the way that lots of our heroes show us the data, talk about the data.

23:40.390 --> 23:43.512
formulate their sentences around the data looking like this.

23:43.932 --> 23:57.298
There are very few people on our team who have ever, who say that they're on our team, have ever said, hey, by the way, the PBS NewsHour should have shown it to you this way and told you that between, what does that say there?

23:57.318 --> 23:59.519
50,000 and 60,000 people die every week in America.

24:04.383 --> 24:15.547
And that means that for something like this to happen, it doesn't need to be much more than murder and lies, especially if you have a lot of evidence for it to be murder and lies.

24:17.068 --> 24:24.131
Especially if you have a lot of evidence about there being no epidemiological evidence of spread.

24:24.231 --> 24:32.774
If there's no good statistical support for that, then that's very interesting if it combines well with this huge list of things.

24:34.448 --> 24:37.832
that includes supplementary oxygen and ventilators that follow.

24:37.872 --> 24:40.555
It includes the lack of antibiotic use.

24:40.595 --> 24:52.368
It includes the poor use of steroids or the inappropriate use of them, maybe the overuse of them, depending on whether you talk to Robert Malone in 2021, or you talk to him in 2022, or you talk to Pierre Kory in 2021, or Pierre Kory in 2024.

24:56.678 --> 25:03.642
I'm sure that if you could, you would, you know, go on the internet and find these videos, you would see that their opinions about these things have changed.

25:04.122 --> 25:05.543
Maybe they've even flip-flopped.

25:05.923 --> 25:08.325
And in reality, the biology doesn't flip-flop.

25:08.365 --> 25:09.645
The biology doesn't change.

25:09.706 --> 25:19.071
If you give somebody supplementary oxygen, high flow, pure oxygen between 10 and 60 liters a minute for a few, couple, three hours, they're going to have problems.

25:19.171 --> 25:22.633
Six hours, maybe they'll have ARDS and you can put them on a ventilator.

25:22.673 --> 25:24.274
Maybe they'll already be dead.

25:30.376 --> 25:33.919
So we need a new consensus about transfection in healthy humans.

25:34.019 --> 25:38.744
We need a new consensus about RNA cannot pandemic.

25:38.784 --> 25:45.310
And we need a new consensus about the fact that the vaccine schedule in America in particular is a criminal enterprise.

25:45.350 --> 25:46.311
And I'll repeat that again.

25:46.371 --> 25:52.056
We need a global consensus that the vaccine schedule in the USA is a criminal enterprise.

25:53.177 --> 25:53.998
And that would be great.

25:55.054 --> 26:08.737
because then the right people would be on the block, the right ideas would be under scrutiny, and therefore, by association, the correct legislation would be under scrutiny.

26:10.253 --> 26:15.614
And we might get to that thing that was on the previous page, strict liability for all pharmaceutical products.

26:15.654 --> 26:25.976
We might get to the idea of evaluating some of these laws as to whether or not they violate our Seventh Amendment, whether they create a sort of jurisdiction stripping where we can't sue.

26:27.796 --> 26:35.178
Because there's lots of other examples in judicial precedents where jurisdiction stripping is a pretty big deal.

26:37.452 --> 26:42.135
But all of these lawyers, you know, he used to work for Goldman Sachs, but that's all right.

26:42.975 --> 26:48.458
And he was a guy who managed some money for BlackRock, but that's all right.

26:48.478 --> 26:52.360
It doesn't matter if they don't say the vaccine schedule's a problem.

26:52.400 --> 26:52.940
It doesn't matter.

26:54.101 --> 26:56.042
It doesn't matter if they don't use the word murder.

26:56.602 --> 26:57.142
It's okay.

26:58.043 --> 27:00.644
There's no such thing as a limited spectrum of debate.

27:00.704 --> 27:03.166
How could that trap anyone?

27:04.076 --> 27:28.889
How can a limited spectrum of debates set up by people that have been there before the pandemic, you know, around the time that the real event 201 occurred in 2018, where they talked all about spike protein vaccines and universal flu vaccines and the coming pandemics, yada, yada, yada, a year before the event 201 that everybody is focused on for the last four years.

27:30.962 --> 27:36.887
Here's one of our heroes talking in front of a banner that says contagion infectious disease today in March of 2017.

27:38.688 --> 27:43.371
Also saying the same thing that we need to fear free range RNA molecules.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.633
In this case, he was talking about Arbo viruses.

27:46.713 --> 27:57.801
And it is indeed the same network of illusionists that culminates in something like this where it's just so it's like shooting fish in a barrel and there's no water in the barrel.

28:02.082 --> 28:02.823
Hi, Steve Kirsch.

28:03.043 --> 28:09.809
I'm here with Dr. Li-Meng Yan, and she is a virologist.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.371
She worked in Hong Kong.

28:13.352 --> 28:20.199
She's in a BSL-3 lab, which is one of the highest levels of biosafety that there is.

28:20.679 --> 28:22.060
She worked on viruses.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.683
Her husband was one of the

28:26.263 --> 28:29.104
I just got to interject, don't let that impress you.

28:29.184 --> 28:35.087
My lab at Pitt was a biosafety level three, like that's just ridiculous.

28:38.289 --> 28:41.971
Was, I guess, was the first person to actually do this.

28:42.791 --> 28:51.916
In fact, one of the reasons, one of the biggest, most common reasons, we're going to start that frigging video over so you can hear it and knowing this while you hear it.

28:53.155 --> 29:04.361
One of the most common reasons why your lab would need to be designated a BSL-3 laboratory is because you intend to use adenovirus to transfect mice.

29:05.342 --> 29:10.525
You intend to use adenovirus to transfect cell culture might also be a reason, although I'm not sure.

29:11.605 --> 29:13.106
You intend to use human tissue.

29:14.571 --> 29:24.574
But one of the most popular reasons would be, especially anybody working on mice or rats, would be that you intend to transfect those animals or transform them.

29:24.614 --> 29:32.297
And in this case, transform them with adenovirus was one of the things we did regularly in the laboratory at Pitt.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.798
And so our lab was designated a biosafety level three.

29:35.878 --> 29:37.279
It's got the same door.

29:37.779 --> 29:38.679
You can open it up.

29:38.759 --> 29:40.420
It opens to the regular hallway.

29:40.860 --> 29:43.681
It just means that sometimes people are going to be dressed a certain way.

29:44.602 --> 29:49.946
and there might be a down drafted table or somebody might be working in a hood.

29:50.807 --> 29:56.932
There will be things present, but it doesn't mean that it's got like bubble suits and all this other stuff.

29:57.833 --> 30:05.759
I mean, I would be willing to bet that half of the laboratories in the neurobiology department at Pitt are biosafety level three.

30:06.860 --> 30:15.683
And so now think about what Steve is doing when he reads a script where he tries to impress you by saying, that's one of the highest biosafety levels.

30:15.703 --> 30:16.704
There's only four.

30:17.844 --> 30:19.085
The next one is bubble suit.

30:19.245 --> 30:19.665
That's it.

30:20.725 --> 30:27.268
We had one of those in Amsterdam, but we had to go through a shower and then put on a suit and then shower on the way out.

30:27.348 --> 30:29.549
So it was a little, we didn't have bubble suits.

30:29.589 --> 30:35.191
We just had like Teflon suits, but I mean, it was a fairly rigorous protocol.

30:37.726 --> 30:39.648
I just, I think you're going to see a lot here.

30:39.668 --> 30:41.850
I think you'll see a lot.

30:45.013 --> 30:45.773
Hi, Steve Kirsch.

30:45.974 --> 30:49.036
I'm here with Dr. I'm just going to make sure it starts right.

30:52.748 --> 30:54.850
And she is a virologist.

30:55.590 --> 30:57.432
She worked in Hong Kong.

30:58.413 --> 31:05.258
She's in a BSL-3 lab, which is one of the highest levels of biosafety that there is.

31:05.719 --> 31:07.080
She worked on viruses.

31:07.240 --> 31:16.848
Her husband was one of the, I guess, was the first person to actually do the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

31:20.229 --> 31:23.472
And we're just going to have a conversation.

31:25.954 --> 31:40.546
In case you are unaware, you're a viewer that hasn't been watching, you can go to PeerTube, our own PeerTube, and you can also find some of the latest shows by Mark Kulak of Housatonic Live, where he's done a very deep dive into

31:43.962 --> 31:47.003
into her and her husband and her parents.

31:47.103 --> 31:54.365
And it's clear that this is not, there's something more to her than where we are right now.

31:57.226 --> 31:58.226
Maybe I goofed up here.

31:58.907 --> 31:59.227
Welcome.

32:01.027 --> 32:02.488
Hi Steve, thank you for having me.

32:02.608 --> 32:03.188
Nice smile.

32:03.548 --> 32:08.029
So my first question is, we'll start with the basics.

32:09.910 --> 32:13.131
Do viruses exist in your professional judgment?

32:14.369 --> 32:29.729
virus generally the virus yeah of course it exists okay and does the SARS-CoV-2 virus exist yes that's probably to exist was the SARS-CoV-2 virus created in a laboratory

32:31.246 --> 32:35.709
Not a laboratory, it's a group of laboratory network.

32:35.829 --> 32:51.899
It was created based on the bat coronavirus, ZC45 and ZXC21 in the People's Liberation Army's network, including their civil partners.

32:52.369 --> 32:58.936
Okay, so my question is, which countries participated in the creation of SARS-CoV-2?

32:59.817 --> 33:03.801
Was it just China, or was it China and the U.S., or China and the U.S.

33:03.961 --> 33:04.602
and the U.K.?

33:04.662 --> 33:07.145
Like, which countries were involved?

33:07.545 --> 33:08.927
When we talk about country,

33:09.349 --> 33:14.634
the tyranny country and the democratic country are totally different.

33:15.115 --> 33:29.089
So in the SARS-CoV-2 case, the Chinese Communist Party, China, is the country which dominates and also steals the technology from other countries.

33:29.491 --> 33:39.414
and finally develop the SARS-CoV-2 in their network, because this is their confidential, unrestricted bioweapon.

33:39.754 --> 33:46.756
So in this case, they won't allow the other government get involved into the development.

33:47.156 --> 33:54.678
However, they will cheat other government to make this weaponized virus become more powerful.

33:55.259 --> 33:57.541
Okay, so did the U.S.

33:57.601 --> 34:01.845
have a role in funding this or collaborating on this at all?

34:03.527 --> 34:06.790
When we talk about the U.S., do you mean the U.S.

34:06.850 --> 34:14.316
government like they dominate the Manhattan Project, or you are talking about the compromised individuals from America?

34:14.717 --> 34:15.778
You can answer for both.

34:18.729 --> 34:20.751
Don't you think that sounded a little scripted?

34:21.252 --> 34:28.120
Do you mean like they were involved like the Manhattan Project, or do you mean something else?

34:29.782 --> 34:32.045
I feel like that was very, very scripted.

34:32.065 --> 34:33.847
I wonder if we need to go back, but anyway.

34:37.327 --> 34:43.009
Okay, what I want to tell you is not like those kind of Manhattan Project conducted by your government.

34:43.249 --> 34:51.671
However, there are the compromised individuals, and also some individuals because of their title, their position.

34:52.011 --> 34:57.813
So they get involved into the downstream, the downstream problems.

34:58.153 --> 35:03.435
So which means when China develop this, they won't tell this compromised

35:03.855 --> 35:07.318
For example, you know Fauci, and you know Peter Daszak.

35:07.919 --> 35:12.302
Communist China won't tell them, hey, this is our new bioweapon, and you come to help me.

35:12.603 --> 35:12.823
No.

35:13.123 --> 35:23.372
However, they will use the way, and those people will pretend blind, and to facilitate China to get technology, to get money from you.

35:23.632 --> 35:29.317
And when these things happen, they realize, oh, wow, China makes a weaponized virus, and they attack us.

35:29.697 --> 35:30.398
What can I do?

35:30.518 --> 35:31.739
I need to protect myself.

35:32.279 --> 35:36.482
And also I need to make more profits from this disaster.

35:36.982 --> 35:37.723
That's what happened.

35:38.183 --> 35:40.204
So do you want to name names?

35:40.364 --> 35:42.045
Because you said that there's certain people involved.

35:42.065 --> 35:45.007
Do you want to name names in terms of who you think was involved?

35:45.027 --> 35:45.888
Oh, so many.

35:45.968 --> 35:50.030
I think people follow my Twitter, my reports.

35:52.512 --> 35:54.753
So many, and follow me on Twitter.

35:55.413 --> 35:58.013
So many names, follow me on Twitter.

35:58.073 --> 36:06.215
Now, who's the first name she's gonna name and let's see if Steve spells it or writes it down or says maybe we should investigate that name then.

36:06.255 --> 36:07.815
Let me hear, who's the first name?

36:08.376 --> 36:09.356
Who's the first name?

36:09.376 --> 36:12.457
You can just give me the top 10 would be fine.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.297
More than the top, more than a.

36:14.677 --> 36:25.053
you know, a set of poker cards can hold, including the Chinese scientists which work for the People's Liberation Army and infiltrated in America.

36:25.706 --> 36:40.818
And for example, very famous one is Du Manying, Professor Du worked in a New York lab center before, working with a lot of People's Liberation Army scientists who pretend to be civil scientists.

36:41.118 --> 36:45.722
They studied coronavirus and other dangerous virus, as well as vaccines.

36:46.062 --> 36:51.767
So that gives them a very easy way to access to the very cutting,

36:52.466 --> 36:57.750
cutting-edge knowledge in America, and also obtained your money from NIAID.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.972
And also, now she moved to Georgia.

37:01.353 --> 37:21.990
Except for her and this group, we also know Peter Daszak, he actually ... I mean, what I can tell you is, he doesn't know much in technology in the lab, but he's more like the person who enjoys this position, and become a bridge, help China to get things from America, and get his own benefit.

37:23.951 --> 37:34.056
So she said some other name, and it said that that was an example of a People's Liberation Army, or PL, what'd she say, CCP Army, what, what?

37:35.276 --> 37:41.059
She said that the army, people that worked for the army, and gave a name, said she went to Georgia.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.282
And now Steve has already heard of the other mention there.

37:46.322 --> 37:48.063
He already heard of Peter Daszak.

37:48.123 --> 37:51.644
I would be much more interested in some of these other people that have infiltrated.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.205
I want to understand what happened then.

37:55.571 --> 37:57.633
And yet what, where are we gonna go?

37:57.653 --> 38:02.477
Okay, do you think Tony Fauci was involved in this and knew what was going on?

38:03.898 --> 38:11.024
Oh, Fauci, I always tell people, I think I'm the first person pointed Fauci is compromised in media in America.

38:12.465 --> 38:18.931
So we move on from whatever PLA operative she outed, who's now at Georgia.

38:18.991 --> 38:22.614
Besides that lab, we know Peter Daszak was a bridge.

38:23.803 --> 38:28.325
So it sounds like she's pretty pivotal if she's one of a couple places we need to look.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.526
We haven't mentioned Ralph Baric yet.

38:30.606 --> 38:44.511
I guess he's not directly connected to the Chinese government, but she said there were Chinese agents, people that worked for the PLA before they infiltrated America to steal our ideas.

38:45.452 --> 38:48.833
And Steve Kirsch pivoted right back to Tony Fauci.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.467
Fauci's problem is, first, he's only a doctor.

38:58.527 --> 39:02.028
He's not a scientist, although he stays in that position.

39:08.870 --> 39:10.710
I'm not really sure what to say about that.

39:11.210 --> 39:12.050
That video is from 2022.

39:12.090 --> 39:12.791
We could watch it.

39:14.744 --> 39:29.581
I just think we would be wasting our time on them and not making useful progress in trying to penetrate or trying to get people to be able to see through the illusion that these people have created by getting us to run around in their hamster wheels, their limited spectrums of debate.

39:31.112 --> 39:38.341
And Robert Malone has been giving speeches all over the internet and I can only find them now and I don't even really understand why.

39:39.062 --> 39:45.110
But suddenly YouTube is serving me all kinds of things that Robert Malone did in 2022 and 2023 that I've never seen before.

39:58.587 --> 40:05.292
By means of ever more effective methods of mind manipulation, the democracies will change their nature.

40:05.952 --> 40:12.456
The quaint old forms, elections, parliaments, supreme courts, and all the rest will remain.

40:13.437 --> 40:17.340
The underlying substance will be a new kind of totalitarianism.

40:18.480 --> 40:24.705
All the traditional names, all the hallowed slogans will remain exactly like they were in the good old days.

40:25.629 --> 40:30.093
Democracy and freedom will be the theme of every broadcast and editorial.

40:31.314 --> 40:36.298
Podcasters will podcast with an American flag behind them.

40:37.078 --> 40:48.268
And meanwhile, the ruling oligarchy and its highly trained elite and their witting and unwitting puppets will quietly run the show as they see fit.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.253
And so much of what these people do

40:55.757 --> 40:58.058
is they make you feel like you're a part of it.

40:59.519 --> 41:01.620
They make you feel like they're listening.

41:05.602 --> 41:11.064
Shoot, they might even pay you for a year if you go along with the idea that it's a lab leak.

41:13.545 --> 41:23.170
But the moment that your understanding evolves to a point where it no longer sells books, you're no longer useful to them.

41:25.285 --> 41:38.688
And the crazy part is, is that everyone is engaging, who's engaging in this mystery solving exercise using social media is trapped this way, unless they are part of the trap.

41:39.808 --> 41:52.091
There is no way that you can use social media to, for example, that guy, no matter what he does and what combinations of controls he puts in is never going to leave that chair.

41:53.430 --> 42:09.058
And no matter how many tweets you retweet, or how clever your reposts are, or how clever your memes are, if you're posting them on Twitter and trying to get people to come to your Discord, you're never, ever, ever gonna get out.

42:14.155 --> 42:20.080
And that's why I show this, because I really think it is important to understand that this goes back before the pandemic.

42:20.120 --> 42:26.885
And you can see it very clearly that someone like Sasha has a daughter like Soph that was on Alex Jones.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.347
We have been gamed.

42:30.547 --> 42:34.571
We have been played by an illusion of consensus by players.

42:35.451 --> 42:37.373
And it's a theater that we're not a part of.

42:37.693 --> 42:42.457
And no matter how much you engage, you're never going to go viral because you're not on stage.

42:43.524 --> 42:48.387
Only people who are on stage or are being brought on stage go viral.

42:49.768 --> 42:59.795
The unfortunate thing is, is when you start to realize that a lot of these anonymous accounts that we have been hoping are also good people are probably part of the illusion.

43:00.956 --> 43:05.980
The illusion of X. The illusion of all of these places like Discord.

43:07.059 --> 43:15.762
where somebody like Matt Crooks can probably meet 10 people that are very interested in what he's doing, but they might only be two people.

43:18.103 --> 43:24.585
Two people running five accounts each, pretending to be five different people to create an illusion of consensus of 10.

43:26.866 --> 43:31.328
And it would be very creepy, wouldn't it, if Jiki Leakes is actually not even an Australian doctor?

43:32.267 --> 43:41.792
but is actually just somebody who is part of Panda, trying to control the opposition to Panda, or maybe somebody who works for Heart.

43:42.973 --> 43:43.593
I don't care.

43:44.233 --> 43:46.855
I just know that Chicky Leaks is part of it.

43:47.675 --> 43:54.359
He's most definitely part of it, wittingly or unwittingly, he's definitely part of it because he refuses to talk about the biology.

43:56.172 --> 44:08.199
He refuses to talk about the biology and he continues to call people traitors without a, what, this diagram about fracturing groups as if that automatically means he's right?

44:09.525 --> 44:11.607
I've been saying it for a very, very long time.

44:11.667 --> 44:14.931
These people have pulled a fast one on us.

44:14.971 --> 44:21.898
There's like 15 people who have agreed to be the core of the dissident movement in North America or within NATO countries.

44:21.958 --> 44:25.502
And those 15 people will put other people on stage with them.

44:25.522 --> 44:27.103
They'll meet them in foreign nations.

44:27.564 --> 44:30.927
But in the end, it's just a show of chosen people.

44:31.943 --> 44:46.887
people that have been screened on a boat off of Turkey, or people that have been screened at a conference in Romania first, or screened in their hot tub, or screened because they were at an event where they took a shoe photo.

44:50.128 --> 44:53.729
That's why none of these people will say, yeah, but Jay's right about this stuff.

44:55.769 --> 44:57.890
And instead they say dumb things like this.

44:58.916 --> 45:02.859
The issue is that his one or two good ideas are sank in what?

45:04.380 --> 45:05.661
One or two good ideas.

45:06.522 --> 45:08.243
Why not just address these three?

45:09.404 --> 45:11.186
That's how weak these people are.

45:11.226 --> 45:15.809
And this is, of course, Lin Finn promoting cancelled mouse.

45:16.783 --> 45:35.060
Could it be any more obvious how this is just one group of collective meddlers, maybe even all of them playing around in the same joke with Rixie and McCairn still pretending to be kind of apart and not really know each other, but kind of because they all retweet each other.

45:35.961 --> 45:37.162
And here's Jikki Leakes.

45:38.240 --> 45:53.432
defending Robert Malone and Pierre Corey and Robert Malone and Pierre Corey and Ryan Cole and Steve Kirsch and and and Jessica Rose and Faustin and Folster Coulson and Les Laurie and oh my goodness.

45:53.572 --> 46:00.538
Oh my goodness protect protect protect and so he has no He has no difference between them.

46:00.598 --> 46:04.581
He thinks that those guys are also good guys instead of just addressing the fact that

46:05.615 --> 46:08.056
that RNA can't pandemic, but we can make a lot of it.

46:08.717 --> 46:12.419
And that would be enough to trigger PCR and sequencing if we wanted it to.

46:13.239 --> 46:20.263
Why not address the fact that transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and all of these academics should have known it.

46:20.303 --> 46:28.207
Why not addressed how ridiculous it is that he says intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

46:28.947 --> 46:48.236
Jiki won't address it because he can't and I really hope that the people that are still on Twitter would tweet this to both of his accounts because I think at this point it's kind of absurd that none of these people have taken a crack at any of these things and not even a useful crack at any of these things.

46:49.117 --> 46:51.498
It's really kind of bewildering to me.

46:55.305 --> 47:02.970
That's why I put this slide up all the time, specifically with this exact text, because Jicky is their bait.

47:03.610 --> 47:18.259
At one point in time, here he is coordinating with Nick Hudson, kind of making it seem like, look, Nick, Nick is, Jicky Leaks is supporting JJ Cooey underneath Nick's tweet.

47:20.400 --> 47:20.520
But

47:21.889 --> 47:27.455
A couple months later, Jicky thinks that pandas are bad guys or always thought panda was bad guys or what?

47:28.556 --> 47:30.057
It's all one big show.

47:30.778 --> 47:41.970
And if these people don't address the biology and continue to address me as a clown or me as an attacker or me as psychotic, then you know what they're doing.

47:43.097 --> 47:48.739
They're doing the same thing that Thomas Sowell has told us.

47:49.119 --> 47:52.259
They just attribute bad motives to people that they can't argue with.

47:55.460 --> 48:08.964
And so I did, I spent years doing it, but my particular video game was made by, you know, my illusion and the spread of bad ideas was moderated by different people than you.

48:12.383 --> 48:14.624
but none of these people are talking about this stuff.

48:14.684 --> 48:17.346
All these people that have blocked me won't talk about this stuff.

48:17.386 --> 48:21.047
Jessica Rose won't say, Jay is right about these three things.

48:21.128 --> 48:23.149
I agree wholeheartedly with these three things.

48:23.189 --> 48:28.591
It's pretty awesome, because after I heard his talk on St.

48:28.611 --> 48:32.253
Patrick's Day in 2023, I was pretty alarmed.

48:32.313 --> 48:35.355
Like I stayed up all night the first time I heard that at Panda.

48:37.316 --> 48:39.137
No honesty from any of these people.

48:40.721 --> 49:09.162
These three statements have resulted in people like Kevin McKernan saying that I'm that I'm chemtrail retarded for example in a sub stack That he didn't have the guts to send to me because of course he already blocked me on Twitter a long long time ago And all of these people I am confident work for weaponized piles of money Work for weaponized piles of money that have used social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue

49:10.134 --> 49:14.476
And that's why their substacks have risen in a way that no one else's has.

49:14.936 --> 49:19.098
That's why their censorship on LinkedIn was promoted.

49:20.899 --> 49:24.860
That's why their censorship on YouTube wasn't so promoted.

49:24.900 --> 49:27.401
Their censorship on LinkedIn was promoted.

49:27.441 --> 49:29.442
Their moving to Gab was promoted.

49:29.482 --> 49:31.563
Their moving to Telegram was promoted.

49:33.264 --> 49:37.806
The moving to Rumble, and Rumble being freer than YouTube or whatever.

49:40.677 --> 49:43.779
Participating in this argument accepts the premise of their narrative.

49:43.799 --> 49:48.141
So again, whatever you do and you go on social media You're already arguing with them.

49:48.161 --> 50:04.350
You're already agreeing to play Star Wars And when you agree to play Star Wars, you're trying to learn their mythology whether you like it or not That's why I'm so frustrated because I don't I don't understand anymore what this guy's doing other than trying to make sure that Kamala wins I guess

50:05.848 --> 50:14.349
I don't understand anymore, but I know that all of those people over there in blue were kind of, kind of promoting him, kind of showing up at his events and stuff.

50:14.510 --> 50:17.070
They, a lot of them I met at CHD events.

50:19.370 --> 50:29.752
I even saw Brett Weinstein made some kind of YouTube video where he is like pleading for Trump to take him as vice president after he was shot for goodness sakes, which is pretty extraordinary.

50:31.552 --> 50:34.513
That this is where we are like it or not.

50:49.474 --> 50:55.498
So I would like to watch the Illusion of Consensus podcast with you.

50:56.778 --> 51:01.841
It is a podcast that is put on by, I guess, my friend, Jay Bhattacharya.

51:02.654 --> 51:05.736
Even though I have a hard time calling him my friend anymore.

51:05.776 --> 51:07.516
I've been in several selfies with him.

51:07.576 --> 51:08.477
I've had drinks with him.

51:08.537 --> 51:09.537
I've eaten dinner with him.

51:09.557 --> 51:25.225
Um, I've met him at least three times in person and I find it absolutely breathtakingly frustrating that when he was on my stream, we couldn't talk about the idea that it might be murder and lies and even worse.

51:26.686 --> 51:26.786
Um,

51:27.392 --> 51:37.437
When we meet in person, he says very regularly that he doesn't have the qualifications to evaluate my biology, but he thinks I should keep going and I should stop attacking Robert Malone.

51:37.858 --> 51:48.463
And I just don't, I don't appreciate the contents of this podcast, but I'm going to try and keep it very objective and try to teach a little biology while we listen to this show.

51:49.184 --> 51:52.546
And I hope I can keep everything cool over here.

51:53.506 --> 51:59.811
It's really not cooling off in here at all yet, but I'm just going to keep dealing with it.

52:07.477 --> 52:09.898
Welcome, everybody, to the Illusion of Consensus podcast.

52:09.978 --> 52:18.004
I'm Professor Jay Bhattacharya, and today I am delighted to have with me in my office, of all places, my good friend, Maktan Zizi.

52:18.485 --> 52:19.445
Maktan, thank you for coming.

52:20.286 --> 52:21.507
I'm delighted to be here, too.

52:21.767 --> 52:22.648
Thanks for having me.

52:23.551 --> 52:38.880
So, Makda has a very extensive and interesting background in physics, in biology, in epidemiology, and also in biodefense.

52:39.500 --> 52:42.522
Makda, tell the audience a little bit about your path.

52:43.021 --> 52:45.642
Well, to avoid being boring, I have to say I'm an hybrid.

52:45.862 --> 52:50.644
I'm an hybrid culturally because within Europe and US, I was partially trained in Europe, partially in US.

52:50.984 --> 52:58.706
I'm an hybrid because I'm a PhD doing clinical, but then veering most strongly into molecular biology and then biophysics.

52:59.047 --> 52:59.867
So this is like

53:00.527 --> 53:03.828
I couldn't leave a question well enough alone.

53:04.068 --> 53:05.748
So that means that I add skills.

53:06.088 --> 53:07.148
It doesn't mean I'm smart.

53:07.228 --> 53:10.009
It means that I see things with different prism.

53:10.569 --> 53:12.590
So you're a medical doctor.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.390
You have a PhD in molecular biology.

53:15.410 --> 53:22.772
And I'll just tell the audience, throughout the whole pandemic, my friend has been coming to my office and we've discussed many aspects.

53:22.792 --> 53:24.452
And I've learned tremendous amounts

53:24.992 --> 53:31.114
from Mark about the molecular biology of the COVID vaccine and of the virus itself.

53:32.735 --> 53:42.639
And so I'm absolutely delighted to have you here so that we can talk in some depth about the mRNA COVID vaccine platform.

53:43.279 --> 53:47.801
Because I think that it's one of these topics, it's generated a lot of heat.

53:48.621 --> 53:52.703
And there's some very, very important aspects of its biology

53:53.563 --> 53:58.685
that have implications for, can it be used in the future?

53:59.965 --> 54:04.486
Not necessarily for the COVID vaccine per se, but for any vaccine technology.

54:04.646 --> 54:10.868
So what I'm going to explain and discuss with you is that this platform has a tremendous future, but it might not be ready.

54:11.468 --> 54:17.212
for the big leak, and it might have basic problems that still need 15-year research before being solved.

54:17.772 --> 54:26.798
And it's known, because all I'm going to discuss with you is not the latest publication in HR science, it's real, but it's basic textbook biology that everyone knows.

54:27.718 --> 54:28.819
And for example,

54:29.419 --> 54:35.362
You can meander this with me, but we have five or six domains where we know that we have problems.

54:35.443 --> 54:42.066
Not only can we not control it, but the tools, and I would like the audience to understand that, the tools to control it are not yet invented.

54:42.546 --> 54:53.012
Okay, so we're going to take this part piece by piece, because I think there are some technical aspects of this that are... I'm going to shut off the air conditioner.

54:53.032 --> 54:56.274
Give me one second, because I want to be able to talk all the time.

54:57.710 --> 54:59.533
I'm really sensitive.

54:59.613 --> 55:01.016
I really feel like it's loud.

55:03.019 --> 55:03.781
It's not loud.

55:03.861 --> 55:04.462
It's not loud.

55:16.454 --> 55:24.220
Okay, so I wanna go back a little bit and run it back again because there were already some pretty inaccurate statements there that frustrate me a lot.

55:26.001 --> 55:28.703
And so I'm gonna click back a couple seconds here.

55:29.124 --> 55:31.185
Actually, I wanna hear what Jay said first.

55:32.506 --> 55:37.010
In some depth about the mRNA COVID vaccine platform.

55:37.310 --> 55:37.490
Yes.

55:37.690 --> 55:42.214
Because I think that it's one of these topics, it's generated a lot of heat.

55:43.015 --> 55:53.123
And there's some very, very important aspects of its biology that have implications for, can it be used in the future?

55:54.664 --> 55:58.908
Not necessarily for the COVID vaccine per se, but for any vaccine technology.

55:59.088 --> 56:00.289
So what I'm going to explain.

56:01.009 --> 56:03.451
So what, for any vaccine technology?

56:04.528 --> 56:08.871
So as he's saying, can mRNA be used for any vaccine technology?

56:08.971 --> 56:09.471
I think.

56:10.052 --> 56:34.348
But again, think about how imprecise this is and how it is specifically imprecise because this multidisciplinary molecular biologist MD and this multidisciplinary economist epidemiologist who purports to be my friend and have learned a lot from me during the pandemic can't seem to find the word transfection to talk about what they're talking about.

56:39.829 --> 56:43.490
I don't understand what's going on here, but it's just ridiculous to me.

56:49.532 --> 56:50.552
It's very frustrating.

56:50.592 --> 56:54.173
I'm getting a very bad feeling about something here.

56:57.313 --> 56:58.414
It's super frustrating.

56:58.494 --> 56:59.494
Hold on one second.

57:02.395 --> 57:03.575
I got to fix this problem.

57:15.689 --> 57:19.732
Okay, um, shoot, this is getting erupted a lot.

57:19.752 --> 57:20.273
I don't like it.

57:21.033 --> 57:22.574
That's what happens when you stop streaming.

57:23.095 --> 57:29.140
Um, so lost my train of thought there, which could have been the reason why that phone rang twice.

57:30.341 --> 57:40.849
So it's a little bit of first, he starts with a little bit of over justification of his background and how he's just, you know, everything from the whole kitchen sink all the way to, to, um, bio weapons.

57:41.767 --> 57:46.850
And then yet, Jay is too imprecise here.

57:47.250 --> 57:53.673
Dr. Bhattacharya is too imprecise or Professor Bhattacharya is too imprecise to call them transfections.

57:53.713 --> 57:59.497
He says vaccines, he means this new technology and can they be any vaccine?

57:59.937 --> 58:04.859
And that's a very interesting and not the appropriate question in my humble opinion.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.560
But again, if,

58:08.815 --> 58:21.021
I am right, and I think that I am, that Jay Bhattacharya took the name of this podcast that he's running with some Canadian kid who Brett Weinstein introduced the world to.

58:21.521 --> 58:33.827
That Canadian kid and him took and did this podcast and named it Illusion of Consensus, probably because somebody encouraged them to do it in order to kind of water down that term from our use.

58:35.455 --> 58:37.897
I mean, he doesn't have any other explanation for it.

58:37.917 --> 58:39.978
He kind of laughs it off if you ask him in person.

58:40.439 --> 58:46.123
So it's a very strange situation that we're in because people are actively lying to us.

58:46.663 --> 58:48.325
And they even lie to us in person.

58:49.485 --> 59:04.697
And if they really were trying to be friends with you, then there are very simple things that we're asking people to acknowledge that would actually help people that are 20-something years old understand the breadth and the depth of the deception that occurred.

59:05.834 --> 59:09.877
because they could have done just told us that, look, it's transfection.

59:10.678 --> 59:18.583
It might, it might help some old people if there's a real virus, but it's also potentially very dangerous to them.

59:18.823 --> 59:20.845
So we don't really know how it's going to work.

59:21.025 --> 59:31.613
And it's crazy that these people want to push this stuff out because we haven't even gotten it to successfully repeatedly cure cancer because it's got to be done specifically for each cancer.

59:32.033 --> 59:34.495
So instead of telling us the truth,

59:36.266 --> 59:39.689
and that this technology had been around for a very, very long time.

59:39.729 --> 59:46.254
And it's just really a technical term for forcing a part of the clock to do something on its own.

59:48.135 --> 59:51.698
The cells are tricked, hijacked.

59:51.798 --> 59:55.841
There's a little code put in there, and they make some protein for a while.

59:55.881 --> 59:59.904
And we knew how to do that for lots of different years, for many years.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:04.928
And they're not going to explain that right now, which I find very frustrating.

01:00:08.123 --> 01:00:19.108
discuss with you is that this platform has a tremendous future, but it might not be ready for the big leak, and it might have basic problems that still need 15-year research before being solved.

01:00:19.669 --> 01:00:28.673
And it's known, because all I'm going to discuss with you is not the latest publication in HR science, it's real, but it's basic textbook biology that everyone knows.

01:00:29.613 --> 01:00:37.258
And for example, you can meander this with me, but we have five or six domains where we know that we have problems.

01:00:37.358 --> 01:00:43.942
Not only can we not control it, but the tools, and I would like the audience to understand that, the tools to control it are not yet invented.

01:00:44.462 --> 01:00:47.444
Okay, so we're going to take the tools to control what?

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:57.850
I wonder if he just means very simply the localization of the transfection or what tools he's talking about.

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.292
But again, it's this kind of imprecision that isn't very helpful.

01:01:01.352 --> 01:01:07.535
And since you can see them glancing at some board or some music stand or whatever, they're reading off of a script.

01:01:07.615 --> 01:01:12.558
So that makes this even worse because they're not very fluid if they have a script.

01:01:13.058 --> 01:01:22.263
Like this is this is pathetic, this part piece by piece, because I think there are some technical aspects of this that are that are that can be hard to follow unless you have an expert guide like you to have us through.

01:01:23.063 --> 01:01:25.685
But but we're going to get to that through the whole thing.

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:29.307
But I just want to make sure that we understand you have you've exactly this background.

01:01:29.327 --> 01:01:31.628
You've worked in in Belgium.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:33.389
You worked with the Belgian.

01:01:33.889 --> 01:01:38.551
I was actually, I did molecular biology and tech watch, and I was in biodefense program.

01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:41.012
So I work in protein chemistry, in genetics.

01:01:41.252 --> 01:01:46.294
And the question we solve in the lab is, how can we control genes?

01:01:46.514 --> 01:01:47.915
How can we time genes?

01:01:48.215 --> 01:01:50.716
How can we improve a protein synthesis?

01:01:50.956 --> 01:01:55.558
So he's the Belgian version in biodefense in Belgium.

01:01:56.118 --> 01:01:58.559
That's the same place where Mark Van Ronst worked.

01:01:58.599 --> 01:02:03.421
Mark Van Ronst was the commissioner, the flu commissioner for Belgium and then later for the WHO.

01:02:04.061 --> 01:02:07.582
And he's the guy that we watch speak in front of the Chatham House in like 2011.

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:24.629
two years after the swine flu, complaining that, man, if we had a better Facebook, we might have gotten more people to take it, or some crap like this, and talked about how he was exaggerating the number of deaths and doing it on purpose to get compliance.

01:02:27.113 --> 01:02:35.958
And he was speaking on stage with that Osterhaus from the Netherlands, the guy that went, yeah, when they ordered 35 million doses of his Mexican flu vaccine.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:40.040
This guy worked for the exact same health department in Belgium.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.600
Great.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.381
I'm sure he's a great guy.

01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:46.243
I mean, we don't have any Americans that can explain this biology.

01:02:46.543 --> 01:02:50.325
We have to have this guy because his resume is just so good.

01:02:55.302 --> 01:02:55.862
and its yield.

01:02:56.142 --> 01:03:02.944
And I applied that to molecular epidemiology, looking at German virus, but at the same time, looking at what the bad guys were doing abroad.

01:03:03.764 --> 01:03:08.325
Because in my youth, I was trained at the World Trade, also in biodefense program before coming back to Belgium.

01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:21.728
And you know, there is, science is one, there is not a field A, B, C, D. We specialize, but to do a specialty experiment in B, oftentimes, and it's your case too, you need to know a bit of A and a bit of C and D, and then you can do B.

01:03:22.749 --> 01:03:31.074
I definitely agree with that and I think it leads a lot of times to some very kind of polymathic sort of understanding of certain things.

01:03:31.134 --> 01:03:33.116
I think there are lots of examples of

01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:54.469
academicians that have amassed a very broad set of skills in programming languages and also in microscopy and optics and also in animal behavior and probably carpentry and cage design or experiment design.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:04:03.953
There's all kinds of creativity and all kinds of different sort of focuses that one can have over the course of a 20-year career.

01:04:05.205 --> 01:04:21.139
But it still doesn't mean that you understand biology from the perspective of a broad enough sense to see where that irreducible complexity actually is.

01:04:23.257 --> 01:04:41.262
Because if you train in all these disciplines just enough to get the spike of expertise, to get that paper, to do that one application, to answer that one question, then you can get the idea that you have all these different merit badges.

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:44.943
And that means that if you wanted to, you could open your own store in any of these.

01:04:45.764 --> 01:04:46.984
And that's not really true.

01:04:48.697 --> 01:04:55.884
I mean, after 20 years of working with microscopes and optics, I still know that I'm a child.

01:04:55.964 --> 01:05:02.751
And as soon as I got out, all the things that are available and the technologies that are available have changed already.

01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.593
And so I'm sure I'm way out of date by now.

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:13.673
But my point would be that it seems like we're spending an awful lot of time in the beginning of this video justifying why we're talking to him.

01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:17.616
And now he's going to take a lot of time justifying why we're talking to him.

01:05:18.056 --> 01:05:27.864
Instead of just saying that transfection and transformation in healthy animals was always going to be dumb, because you can't do that in a healthy animal.

01:05:27.904 --> 01:05:29.966
The immune system doesn't know what to do with that.

01:05:30.006 --> 01:05:34.310
Especially, I mean, it makes it even worse that we don't know even know where it's all going to happen.

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:49.016
But if the likelihood that it's going to happen in capillaries is quite high, if the likelihood that it's going to happen in platelets is quite high, then there are certain predictable chains of reaction that will most likely happen.

01:05:49.056 --> 01:05:50.116
And we've seen that now.

01:05:51.957 --> 01:06:01.321
And so instead of explaining it as though, OK, the immune system is called in to kill those those tissues, and when that happens, catastrophic events can occur.

01:06:02.799 --> 01:06:05.800
And those can include autoimmunity if people survive.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.840
That's the basic gist of it.

01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:22.745
If you transfected half of the arteries or half of your aorta and the immune system successfully attacked it, my guess is you'd have just a rupture, you'd be dead.

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:30.107
And so any autoimmunity that would have resulted from that transfection isn't gonna be something anybody's gonna have to look into.

01:06:32.694 --> 01:06:35.856
And so we're not really starting here with a good start.

01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:40.378
Understand that science is more wide than a title.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:44.980
So you can be a molecular biologist dealing with virus or cancer.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.461
But you also are an epidemiologist.

01:06:46.481 --> 01:06:46.681
Yes.

01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:47.141
Oh, yeah.

01:06:47.161 --> 01:06:51.903
I created and led the Department of Epidemiology of Defense in Belgium.

01:06:51.943 --> 01:06:52.103
Yes.

01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:53.284
That was done before me.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:00.946
Okay, so the standard question during the pandemic is, as soon as you say anything about anything is, are you an epidemiologist?

01:07:01.086 --> 01:07:02.307
Are you a molecular biologist?

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:04.109
Martijn can say yes to both questions.

01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:07.132
Yes, and he did not help me.

01:07:07.192 --> 01:07:09.514
You were censored off of LinkedIn.

01:07:09.554 --> 01:07:12.516
Yeah, I was banned for life from LinkedIn.

01:07:12.576 --> 01:07:14.758
That's a mark of honor, I think, nowadays, Martijn.

01:07:14.778 --> 01:07:19.483
Yeah, we have a kind of special badge for that, and we'll have a medal.

01:07:20.638 --> 01:07:23.521
Okay, so why don't we get started with Professor Azizi.

01:07:24.302 --> 01:07:31.469
So first of all, the mRNA technology, the way that it was sold to the public,

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:34.244
You have a platform.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:36.025
Essentially, it's like a computer.

01:07:36.525 --> 01:07:37.786
And you're programming a computer.

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:54.014
You use it to program your own body to produce a protein that the vaccinologist or the person doing the therapy wants to create inside your body, essentially turning your body into a vaccine factor, a little protein factor.

01:07:54.034 --> 01:07:55.915
That's the basic idea.

01:07:55.975 --> 01:07:57.776
And I think for a lot of the people

01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:03.878
in public health, it seems like a panacea.

01:08:04.318 --> 01:08:15.022
You can decide what protein is best for your body to produce so that it can produce a response, the immune response you want.

01:08:15.822 --> 01:08:20.584
And it could be used not just for this COVID vaccine, but could be used for a million different things.

01:08:21.204 --> 01:08:22.505
All you need is a sequence.

01:08:22.785 --> 01:08:24.426
It sounds almost too good to be true.

01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:29.527
good to be true, too good now, but it will be good to be true in public in 20 years.

01:08:29.808 --> 01:08:30.348
There you go.

01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:38.671
We could end the podcast right now, because this has been the reason to do it the whole time.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:42.959
And I've been saying that for four years now.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.500
They are running us into a trap.

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.860
That was the whole reason why they did it.

01:08:49.021 --> 01:08:58.923
I don't think they got near the compliance they expected to, given the amount of energy they put into seeding the narrative that got everybody on the Scooby-Doo dumb train.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.744
Like a computer, he says.

01:09:04.164 --> 01:09:04.904
That's wrong.

01:09:06.244 --> 01:09:09.005
If you think of it like a computer, you're really, really

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:15.660
you're really, really underselling the complexity of a single cell and the regulation of RNA.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:31.785
And so assuming that RNA is just this thing that gets made copies of, and then it gets over there and it gets made into proteins is assuming an awful lot because of the fact that there are small RNAs that have all sorts of regulatory roles there.

01:09:32.623 --> 01:09:40.428
And there are all sorts of ways that RNAs are post-translationally modified that could also apply to these transcripts.

01:09:41.049 --> 01:09:57.660
Then there are also all kinds of other intricacies of the interior of the cell that has to do with the tissue itself and whether or not its metabolism is very high, its ribosomes are working in this way or in that way, because all the ribosomes aren't even the same and they're all tissue dependent.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.722
And so you have this thing where you make this ultra simple

01:10:02.803 --> 01:10:03.464
analogy.

01:10:03.524 --> 01:10:18.933
It's just like a computer and you use your body becomes a vaccine factory and he knows from talking to me that it's that exact kind of cartoon bullshittery that is leading all of these young people into this trap.

01:10:21.374 --> 01:10:29.319
A high schooler or a freshman in college probably doesn't have the biological sophistication to understand, at least not yet, that this is ridiculous.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.022
Let's just even back up a little bit.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:41.108
Let's just back up the truck just a little bit and think about the idea that he said that your body becomes a vaccine factory.

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:49.537
What does that mean from the perspective of Jay Bhattacharya's understanding of what a vaccine is?

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:56.460
What does it mean from the perspective of Matin and his understanding of what a vaccine is?

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:11.709
Is he gonna correct him right now and say, well, it's not quite that simple because a vaccine, a traditional vaccine often has a recombinant protein or maybe a combination of recombinant proteins and then has something conjugated to it,

01:11:12.589 --> 01:11:18.977
like a metal, or a diphtheria toxin, or something else.

01:11:19.878 --> 01:11:30.051
A lot of these vaccines are a combination of protein and metal, or a protein and a bacterial toxin, or maybe just the toxic part of a bacterial toxin.

01:11:31.593 --> 01:11:51.277
Your body becoming a vaccine factory is a little bit stretching it because a lot of the components of a traditional vaccine can't be made by your body if you encode them in RNA because there's no code for aluminum or a code for mercury or a code for a lot of these other adjuvants that we don't even know the names of.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.558
You can't encode them in an RNA.

01:11:54.398 --> 01:12:03.123
And so already the kinds of analogies that are being used and then also affirmed by our friend here.

01:12:03.143 --> 01:12:05.524
Yeah, I mean, it's good to be true, right?

01:12:05.724 --> 01:12:11.448
Not right now, maybe, but in 10 years, which means that your explanation is pretty good.

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:15.430
And it doesn't quite work like that now, but it will in 10 years.

01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:28.693
Let's first go at the economics of that, and then, you know, to produce any medication, whether it's a vaccine or a molecule, you need a production line.

01:12:28.953 --> 01:12:31.533
It's a factory, and you need a production per product.

01:12:31.593 --> 01:12:37.595
So a company that has 10 medication that are selling on the market needs 10 plant or 10 production line.

01:12:38.095 --> 01:12:45.216
With the RNA technology, what happens is that you have one production line, you just change from day to day the message you inject, because the RNA is a message.

01:12:45.656 --> 01:12:49.017
It's a message of a product that will be generated by your,

01:12:49.637 --> 01:12:50.938
your own body.

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:57.581
So just to break this down, you have the classic dogma, the central dogma of biology.

01:12:57.601 --> 01:12:59.062
You have DNA.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:07.827
The DNA produces an mRNA, a messenger RNA, which is essentially a copy of the information implicit inside the DNA.

01:13:08.107 --> 01:13:14.994
Yes, the DNA is like the book, the blueprint, the RNA is the messenger that goes to the little factor in the cell to produce the final product.

01:13:15.034 --> 01:13:16.936
And then the final product is protein, right?

01:13:17.156 --> 01:13:18.237
It's translation, right?

01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:25.204
So you have this like sequence of information, unidirectional from the DNA to the RNA to the protein.

01:13:25.644 --> 01:13:28.467
And the idea is I'm going to send in a

01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:51.441
Essentially a molecule is a lot like like an mRNA messenger RNA into your body and trick your cell into producing the Protein I wanted to produce and then it has the effects that but I would want it to have like your body will be trained to deal with that yes little protein and this technology has five Needs that might be covered or might become a problem.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:52.542
Can I ask what that is?

01:13:52.582 --> 01:13:55.844
Yes, cuz you asked about a factory I think it's very very important analogy.

01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:55.924
I

01:13:56.044 --> 01:13:57.985
Yes, it is.

01:13:58.206 --> 01:14:07.732
If I were to introduce the proteins into your body separately, without asking your body to produce the proteins, I would produce them outside.

01:14:07.752 --> 01:14:10.914
I have a certain amount of dose of the thing I want to induce.

01:14:10.954 --> 01:14:15.577
I would have some mechanism of delivering the protein to the places I want it delivered.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:17.499
vaccine, for example.

01:14:17.819 --> 01:14:21.182
It has a finite amount of protein selected from research.

01:14:21.222 --> 01:14:23.784
Let's say the flu vaccine, we know the epitope.

01:14:23.864 --> 01:14:25.325
An epitope is a fragment of protein.

01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:28.688
We know what we would use to inject in your body to immunize you.

01:14:28.948 --> 01:14:30.289
And that works, or worked.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:33.431
But it is a dose that's known, finite.

01:14:33.532 --> 01:14:35.233
If you put too much of it, doesn't work.

01:14:35.593 --> 01:14:37.795
If you put not enough of it, doesn't work.

01:14:38.115 --> 01:14:40.397
So there is a dose that has to be injected.

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:42.319
It means the white blood cell in your plasma.

01:14:42.819 --> 01:14:44.961
So with RNA now, you don't have that.

01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:56.710
because you give a message, you need to target a cell, not any cell in your body to be able to express that message and the cell need to present this protein to the white blood cell.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:58.872
So it's a different process, different path.

01:14:59.252 --> 01:15:02.495
Okay, so the cell, he said the cell...

01:15:23.567 --> 01:15:28.771
He said, the cell needs to present this protein to the white blood cell.

01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:38.139
Now, I want you to already start to recall from a couple of years ago, the immunology that you learned from me.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:43.963
Um, and yeah, come on, seriously.

01:15:43.983 --> 01:15:44.023
Um,

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:56.513
And recall the immunology that I taught you a couple years ago already now about how, what does presentation mean?

01:15:57.574 --> 01:16:01.756
He says here, to present this protein to the white blood cell.

01:16:01.816 --> 01:16:03.736
Now, I'm going to see if we've got enough room here.

01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:04.817
We probably have enough room here.

01:16:05.637 --> 01:16:16.902
There's two different interpretations of that that might be occurring in your, this is not going to be a very good drawing because I'm using a pen, in your, here's cell one, here's cell two.

01:16:17.847 --> 01:16:19.567
Presentation could mean two things.

01:16:19.587 --> 01:16:22.288
You could put mean presentation like on the outside.

01:16:22.308 --> 01:16:30.909
This is the, I guess, the spike protein on the outside of the cell like that.

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:33.450
That's probably pretty dumb.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:45.872
Or you could mean present on MHC, which is a molecule that is on the outside of all healthy cells and

01:16:46.798 --> 01:16:48.759
infected cells express more of it.

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:55.302
And what they're doing is they're presenting the protein that they're currently manufacturing here.

01:16:56.663 --> 01:17:07.228
And so it's a way for your immune system to be constantly patrolling your healthy tissue to make sure that that tissue is doing what it's supposed to do.

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:13.051
And so a cell that isn't growing very much and is only making maintenance proteins,

01:17:17.449 --> 01:17:29.200
will present part of those maintenance proteins up there, and this molecule would be MHC1.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:33.944
I believe it's one, but it might be two, but I don't think it is.

01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:34.344
It's one.

01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:39.349
And so that's how the immune system and

01:17:40.396 --> 01:17:41.496
tissue communicate.

01:17:41.516 --> 01:17:42.937
It's one of the ways they communicate.

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:48.598
And this presentation process increases the more activity the cell is going through.

01:17:49.158 --> 01:17:56.500
And so the biological story that we're told is that when there's an infection of a virus, then there's even more MHC on the outside.

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.401
It's another way of signaling to the immune system to make sure that

01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:13.648
If there's a signal that they hold up that is recognized as foreign, it's possible that you could already get the immune system to apoptose that cell because it's expressing a foreign protein.

01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:16.190
It presented a foreign protein on MHC1.

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:18.671
Well, then killer T cells will get rid of it.

01:18:19.838 --> 01:18:26.691
Natural killer cells will get rid of it more likely because the natural killer cells don't have that specific immunity or memory.

01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:29.897
They just have this general role of patrol.

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:43.622
And so you could imagine a scenario where he's trying to say that transfection presents the protein on the outside of the cell to the white blood cell, but he's using an immunology term when he says present.

01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:55.926
And then what you really mean is that an antigen presenting cell will take antigens that it has found and it will present them to T cells on MHC2.

01:18:57.884 --> 01:19:05.466
So in this case, in this little immunology crash course lesson here, you would have a dendritic cell.

01:19:05.526 --> 01:19:07.767
You know, I'm not drawing a very good dendritic cell here.

01:19:08.387 --> 01:19:14.889
But you'd have a dendritic cell and the dendritic cell would be presenting on its surface with MHC II.

01:19:17.099 --> 01:19:20.563
And it would be presenting the antigen that it had found earlier.

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:28.412
And then that T cell would use its T cell receptor to interface here and see if it recognizes that.

01:19:28.452 --> 01:19:32.437
And if it does, then it would go through clonal expansion in the whole nine yards.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:41.131
And so presentation in immunology means something and then precision in talking about this biology means something.

01:19:41.171 --> 01:19:43.792
And so I'm just trying to be precise here.

01:19:44.252 --> 01:19:54.295
And when I say, when he says cell needs to present this protein to white blood cells, it is again, kind of oversimplifying and he's not going any deeper than Bill Gates.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:59.757
If he means that muscle cells are going to be presenting a spike protein to

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.002
spike protein to the immune system, what does he mean?

01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:07.343
Does he mean they're going to be presenting it like this?

01:20:08.464 --> 01:20:10.565
Or does he mean he's going to be presenting like this?

01:20:10.685 --> 01:20:17.269
Because this is where Sukrit Bhakti's story came in.

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:30.096
Because if you are thinking about transfecting, for example, the endothelium of the lining of capillaries,

01:20:35.808 --> 01:20:45.144
Sukrit Bhakti's idea was that on the first transfection these cells would, now we're not talking about presentation here,

01:20:46.052 --> 01:20:53.076
We're not talking about presentation on MHC because you're making it, because that's what that is.

01:20:53.777 --> 01:21:02.562
The cell will present on MHC1 epitopes that correspond to proteins that are currently manufactured.

01:21:02.682 --> 01:21:10.067
So if you're making actin, then you're going to present something up here on MHC1 that tells your immune system that you're currently making actin.

01:21:10.647 --> 01:21:16.911
And if you're making viral proteins, then the whole story they tell us is that on MHC-1, you present viral proteins.

01:21:18.531 --> 01:21:26.616
Separate from that is the idea that viral proteins are produced in so much abundance that they are also sticking out of the membrane itself.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:38.002
When they are sticking out of the membrane itself, we are talking about a very different set of possible immunological circumstances that involves antibody-dependent cytotoxicity.

01:21:39.178 --> 01:21:41.860
And what that means is, where did my drawing go?

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:42.620
Oh.

01:21:43.841 --> 01:21:57.231
What that means is, is that when you transfect these cells in the endothelium and they start to express spike protein on the outside, the ones that are transfected are, I'm reusing an S.

01:21:59.585 --> 01:22:00.406
Well, maybe I can use this.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:01.847
No, I'll use an S. That's fine.

01:22:02.308 --> 01:22:10.195
If they're expressing spike protein on the outside the first time, this is exact words almost of Sukrit Bhakti, you might get away with it.

01:22:11.256 --> 01:22:14.820
And that the immune system might just, you know, some of these cells will get killed.

01:22:16.926 --> 01:22:20.509
And it'll take a little while, but some of those cells will get killed and it'll be fine.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:38.186
But the next time you do it, there will be antibodies present to those proteins, especially if it was just a few in the endothelium and the rest of them were in the muscle or the rest of them were in the fat or wherever it transfected, then this won't be very dangerous.

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:41.268
But then you take a second injection

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:47.531
And now in your blood you already have antibodies to the spike protein going around.

01:22:48.011 --> 01:22:52.037
And one of the things that antibodies can do is bring in the complement system.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.122
Sukrit Bhakti's expertise.

01:22:56.192 --> 01:23:07.475
And so if you have antibodies that are depositing on endothelial cells that are expressing a spike protein for which those antibodies are specific, you could have complement deposition.

01:23:08.135 --> 01:23:18.497
Not only that, but you could call in cytotoxic T cells that recognize the antibody signal that's there because that's another way that T cells respond.

01:23:20.248 --> 01:23:25.250
antibody dependent cytotoxicity is that it's the it's a T cell response.

01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:30.732
And also, I believe that for sure, it's a it's a complement system response.

01:23:30.752 --> 01:23:37.815
So you have this catastrophic situation, you know, every subsequent successful transfection.

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:44.838
And so it becomes even more important to understand how it is that some people have gotten to five shots.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.741
because it's a very random process.

01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:51.963
It's a very random process that could go in many different timescales.

01:23:52.144 --> 01:23:57.947
We don't know for sure if it's five years from now that this autoimmunity will hit exponentiality.

01:23:58.687 --> 01:24:04.630
We don't know for sure if it's on the third shot or the fifth shot that you start to climb that exponential.

01:24:05.631 --> 01:24:11.154
And we don't know if it's different for every person or different whether it goes into different tissues or not.

01:24:13.493 --> 01:24:15.955
And so we're still talking theoretical here.

01:24:16.015 --> 01:24:21.119
We're still talking about what are the cartoon ways of understanding what this is going on.

01:24:21.159 --> 01:24:34.809
When we start talking about the noise in the system, the noise in the transfection, and we start to talk about the noise in the protein production, then you'll see why it's really a disaster idea.

01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:43.454
And there are problems there, and we will discuss about that.

01:24:43.474 --> 01:24:45.276
Yeah, so why don't we start with the first one?

01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:45.636
Yes.

01:24:46.497 --> 01:24:53.943
When the mRNA platform vaccine is injected into your body, it goes into your cell.

01:24:55.197 --> 01:25:01.620
Is there a lot of control over how many copies of the protein is produced?

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:05.922
If I was interjecting the protein from the outside, I can tell you, you know, whatever.

01:25:05.962 --> 01:25:08.603
Nanogram or microgram or milligram or kilogram, yes.

01:25:09.063 --> 01:25:12.725
Here, with RNA, the only thing we know is the amount of RNA.

01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:17.491
But this is irrelevant because it's not what affects our body.

01:25:17.831 --> 01:25:26.104
So if I give X amount of RNA, 60 nanogram or 60 microgram, it doesn't give me the output in protein because this is not linear.

01:25:27.625 --> 01:25:30.066
Wow, that means that you have no control dose.

01:25:30.126 --> 01:25:32.147
Then you can say, we could calibrate that.

01:25:32.487 --> 01:25:34.388
Yes, you could calibrate that, but it wasn't done.

01:25:34.768 --> 01:25:39.750
So essentially, I'm sad to say that, but the FDA has a rule.

01:25:40.411 --> 01:25:43.792
Medication needs a dose that is reproducible with a standard.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:47.454
But here, the dose of the medication is respected because it's a message.

01:25:47.654 --> 01:25:48.374
It's a message.

01:25:48.614 --> 01:25:49.715
It's not a product.

01:25:50.135 --> 01:25:54.577
And the product will be produced by own cell, and there is start, if I may say.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:58.559
the amount of protein per unit mass depend on metabolism.

01:25:59.239 --> 01:26:06.143
You know, if you're young and have a lot of metabolically active cells, the same amount of RNA will yield more protein.

01:26:06.643 --> 01:26:13.007
If you're old, you know, not senile, but with less muscle mass, it will be less, depending on the time of the day.

01:26:13.547 --> 01:26:21.037
You know, cell cycle, if the cell are more awake, the cell are more sleepy, depend if the cell is divided or not, dividing or not, I mean.

01:26:21.257 --> 01:26:29.368
So essentially, you have a lot of interfering factor that unless you control them, you have no idea of the amount of antigen that you produce.

01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:34.551
which is quite surprising because without pathology, you have a problem of reproducibility.

01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:35.472
Define that term.

01:26:35.752 --> 01:26:41.774
Pathology is the dose that is given of a medication vaccine to exert a certain measurable effect.

01:26:42.555 --> 01:26:43.275
It's a dose.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:45.016
It's a dose effect relationship.

01:26:45.276 --> 01:26:55.841
So a pathology is like when you get an antibiotic box, you have a dosage, 500 milligrams, and we know how it translates in microgram per liter in your body for a certain amount of time.

01:26:56.201 --> 01:27:00.165
because too much of it may not be good, not enough may not kill the bacteria.

01:27:00.506 --> 01:27:03.869
So the dose is the pathology, it's the dose given to the patient.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:08.794
Okay, so let's stop there for a second, go back down here.

01:27:09.895 --> 01:27:11.557
So first issue is dosage.

01:27:11.617 --> 01:27:14.920
He says that we know the amount of RNA and we could calibrate it.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.580
That's definitely not true.

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:28.623
We've seen from Kevin McKernan's own data that he's presented on my show more than two or three years now that the mRNA was a smear.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:32.204
And that means they're not putting one piece of RNA in there.

01:27:32.224 --> 01:27:33.844
They're putting a lot of fragments in there.

01:27:33.884 --> 01:27:42.586
And those fragments could have lots of consequences that are not limited to the protein fragment that they would result in were they faithfully translated.

01:27:43.246 --> 01:27:51.808
They could also result in fragments that aren't equivalent to what they should be if they are faithfully translated because they are chemically altered mRNAs.

01:27:52.248 --> 01:28:01.371
The other problem is that the smaller the mRNA gets, the more likely it is to interfere with some of these micro RNA, small interfering RNA processes.

01:28:02.031 --> 01:28:11.637
these regulatory RNA processes of micro RNAs that are going on inside all of our cells all the time that very, very few molecular biologists want to acknowledge.

01:28:12.057 --> 01:28:18.461
But the ones that study it understand that it's a lot more complicated than a unidirectional DNA to RNA to protein.

01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:27.166
And some of the most intricate ways that RNA is regulated at a molecular level aren't understood because they involve these micro RNAs.

01:28:28.342 --> 01:28:32.203
And so, he then goes on to say that, yeah, we know the amount of RNA.

01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:45.946
Again, I'm saying that's wrong because again, for storage reasons, for prep reasons, for different production line reasons, for impurity reasons, for all the reasons above, right?

01:28:46.647 --> 01:28:50.468
And yet he says, we could have calibrated if we wanted to, but we didn't.

01:28:50.548 --> 01:28:51.848
And so, we rushed it.

01:28:53.493 --> 01:29:06.015
The amount of protein depends on metabolism, but neither of these guys is immediately gonna say, oh, that makes sense then why somebody with an incredibly high metabolism, oh, I don't know, like an athlete might be even more dangerous to transfect.

01:29:09.096 --> 01:29:14.062
And instead, he's just going to say that little kids have a high metabolism.

01:29:14.122 --> 01:29:25.076
And so they might be more, they might make more spike protein than an old person, but how much spike protein you make depends on, depends on your metabolism.

01:29:27.392 --> 01:29:46.383
So he's also suggesting, and he's gonna probably say it very soon, I can almost feel it, that the effectiveness for old people might be less simply because they make less spike protein, but he's never, ever gonna talk about how the inappropriateness of this and what it means, and it's just brutal.

01:29:47.643 --> 01:29:53.727
Just to put this together, what you're saying is that I can give you a certain dose of the mRNA,

01:29:55.001 --> 01:30:03.508
however many micrograms, the Moderna had a higher dose of the mRNA than Pfizer did, for instance, right?

01:30:04.289 --> 01:30:09.333
And the doses for the children's vaccines were less than, right?

01:30:09.373 --> 01:30:10.554
But that's of the mRNA.

01:30:11.074 --> 01:30:12.155
That is not what we care about.

01:30:12.535 --> 01:30:16.639
What we care about is how much protein- How much spike was produced.

01:30:16.919 --> 01:30:21.142
Spike protein is produced in the cells of your body as a consequence of

01:30:21.903 --> 01:30:22.724
giving you that dose.

01:30:22.744 --> 01:30:25.405
Yes, and therefore for exit possible.

01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:27.046
And it has been published.

01:30:27.266 --> 01:30:37.632
We knew that beforehand from the literature, but they were in 2022, at the end of 2022, a certain Uganda published paper because it's not easy to measure spike produced by the vaccine in vivo.

01:30:37.872 --> 01:30:42.535
So the methodology to produce and to control the production doesn't exist.

01:30:42.935 --> 01:30:48.839
So like what you're saying is that they did these experiments in cells in Petri dishes or labs or whatever.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:58.664
And they figured out, OK, if I give it this much dose in the petri dish, and then they took that and said, well, that's likely what will happen when we inject it in a human body.

01:30:58.684 --> 01:31:00.045
Yeah, but the human is not the other.

01:31:00.265 --> 01:31:00.985
One is not the other.

01:31:01.005 --> 01:31:03.787
You know, we have different body shape, different metabolism, different genetics.

01:31:04.127 --> 01:31:04.888
So what happens?

01:31:05.408 --> 01:31:10.871
And it has been shown in two or three papers, you have people for which you have no production, zero.

01:31:11.795 --> 01:31:13.176
Okay, no side effect, no effect.

01:31:13.616 --> 01:31:17.278
You have people when you... So some people get the dose of the mRNA.

01:31:17.418 --> 01:31:18.599
And have no spike.

01:31:18.679 --> 01:31:25.523
And for whatever reason, their cells do not actually get tricked into producing the spike protein.

01:31:25.723 --> 01:31:26.924
Barely detectable amount.

01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:28.024
So, okay.

01:31:29.205 --> 01:31:32.567
So the idea of a placebo batch never crosses their mind.

01:31:34.764 --> 01:31:39.147
never even crosses their mind, even though we've been talking about it for three years.

01:31:39.207 --> 01:31:45.811
And it is so crucial to understand how easily we could have been manipulated with the use of placebo batches.

01:31:45.891 --> 01:31:53.055
It also really creates a wonderful way to avoid any kind of contamination problem or anything, because those can be clean.

01:31:55.196 --> 01:31:57.638
And you got thousands of people who've taken a shot.

01:31:57.658 --> 01:31:59.839
They didn't even feel anything, not even a tingle.

01:32:02.537 --> 01:32:04.098
But that would not be effective, right?

01:32:04.398 --> 01:32:09.760
There are other people who have like, just write the amount, you know, because the technology may work.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.140
You cannot exclude success.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.382
So essentially, some people produce what's expected, and then you have a trigger and it might work.

01:32:16.962 --> 01:32:20.623
Some other people have too much, but how much is too much, it depends on them.

01:32:20.823 --> 01:32:21.644
So they have side effects.

01:32:21.944 --> 01:32:25.505
Some people have so much that they have toxicity of the spike.

01:32:26.085 --> 01:32:27.786
That is spectacular.

01:32:29.167 --> 01:32:39.330
And so here we are right now talking about the spike protein as being faithfully produced by a high purity RNA that we could measure, could have calibrated.

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.951
And now the problem is, is that some people produce no spike.

01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:46.512
Some people produce just enough.

01:32:47.665 --> 01:33:03.376
Some people produce too much and then some people produce so much that they get sick exactly like Kevin McCairn and Walter Chestnut and Jessica Rose have been complaining that the spike protein would do since they realized it was a gain-of-function virus in 2021.

01:33:04.017 --> 01:33:04.477
Wow.

01:33:05.698 --> 01:33:08.660
Because then it overflow and it goes everywhere in the body.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.505
Is it possible to predict in advance, before you get the injection, which of those kinds of people are going to be?

01:33:16.187 --> 01:33:17.867
I think that's a very important question.

01:33:17.907 --> 01:33:20.748
The only thing that I can think of is the HLA haplotype.

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:24.229
We know that the reaction and or body react depending on.

01:33:24.329 --> 01:33:36.452
He said HLA haplotype, which is basically a descriptor that talks about what your MHC2 molecule, MHC1 molecule looks like.

01:33:36.692 --> 01:33:41.853
HLA is the human lymphocyte antigen, human lymphocyte, human,

01:33:43.069 --> 01:33:43.650
It doesn't matter.

01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:45.452
It's the equivalent to MHC.

01:33:45.672 --> 01:33:48.335
MHC is not really used in the context of humans.

01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:50.197
It's used in the context of other animals.

01:33:50.697 --> 01:33:51.077
And then in

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:54.115
in humans, I think they call it the HLA.

01:33:54.635 --> 01:33:57.137
And it's the same, they're just bamboozling you.

01:33:57.177 --> 01:34:08.447
They're just making it harder for you to understand that there is a general mechanism by which every cell in your body communicates with signals to the immune system to say, hey, this is what I'm doing right now.

01:34:08.907 --> 01:34:12.870
And that presentation process is happening all the time around your body.

01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:18.395
And that is how tissues are regularly being patrolled

01:34:21.237 --> 01:34:30.343
and licensed to do things and licensed to grow and licensed to send signals is because the immune system permits it.

01:34:33.265 --> 01:34:42.951
And I don't know where I was going, but yeah, he was saying that HLA subtype might be a way of predicting whether you make a lot or a little, but I don't think that's right because what he's suggesting

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.622
I don't think that has anything to do with how much protein someone produces when they are transfected.

01:34:50.642 --> 01:34:55.944
I think what has much more to do with it is whether or not there's RNA present or not.

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:58.565
And that's what I find so extraordinary.

01:34:58.945 --> 01:35:02.347
This guy's a molecular biologist, yet he thinks it's possible.

01:35:03.087 --> 01:35:23.084
that the same transfection agent carried by the same lipid nanoparticle with the same quantity and purity of RNA could be injected into one person and you would have no protein produced and inject it into another person and have all kinds of protein produced to the point of toxicity after weeks.

01:35:24.997 --> 01:35:30.199
and that there's a reasonable biological explanation that could go back to HLA receptors.

01:35:30.739 --> 01:35:31.460
Stop lying!

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.481
I mean, it would have to be much more simple than that.

01:35:34.561 --> 01:35:38.502
Like, you know, it went all out their liver or there was no RNA.

01:35:42.304 --> 01:35:51.688
It's extraordinary, quite frankly, that this so quickly has, in my humble opinion, really devolved into something very strange, unless

01:35:54.309 --> 01:36:06.874
unless he's hinting at the fact that the spike protein itself is made specific for certain HLA subtypes and therefore will be highly immunogenic to some people and not highly immunogenic to other people.

01:36:06.914 --> 01:36:20.220
So then there's a real Venn diagram, because first your body has to produce a lot of protein and then you have to know whether or not your HLA subtype makes the spike protein particularly toxic to you or not, which again goes back to

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:26.365
the same interesting scooby-doo, which is that, oh, maybe this is a racial spike protein.

01:36:26.745 --> 01:36:28.846
Maybe it's a racial gain-of-function virus.

01:36:28.886 --> 01:36:31.509
They aimed it at white people, or they aimed it at Jews.

01:36:31.949 --> 01:36:32.990
And that's what this is.

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:34.171
Wow.

01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:35.151
Weird.

01:36:36.252 --> 01:36:36.673
standards.

01:36:37.033 --> 01:36:46.985
And they are, so youth, age, metabolism, as I mentioned, gender, hormonal status, HLA platype, all these are variation.

01:36:47.405 --> 01:36:52.571
And if we want to use this technology, you could calibrate all this, but you need to have measurement possible.

01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:54.894
I mean, this is not something that they did for the COVID vaccine.

01:36:55.214 --> 01:37:05.386
And so he's actually arguing for an immunoscreening of everybody that uses a vaccine in order to see which HLA subtype they are.

01:37:05.906 --> 01:37:12.914
Maybe we're even going to have to make vaccines special for each HLA subtype, otherwise this will never work.

01:37:15.194 --> 01:37:17.177
Oh, I'm starting to smell a rat here.

01:37:17.197 --> 01:37:19.901
They just they didn't ask what your HLA type was.

01:37:19.921 --> 01:37:21.463
They just injected everybody.

01:37:21.784 --> 01:37:22.284
It should work.

01:37:22.585 --> 01:37:23.186
It should work.

01:37:23.466 --> 01:37:29.235
And the FDA was blindsided because, oh, we have 30 microgram or 60 microgram depending on the company.

01:37:29.295 --> 01:37:37.262
Keep in mind that the HLA subtype and HLA-specific subtype epitopes is exactly what Epivax worked on.

01:37:37.322 --> 01:37:47.190
Epivax being that Rhode Island company that Brzozowski and Malone and some other people were a part of.

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:50.153
Like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

01:37:51.937 --> 01:37:53.438
Here we go, it's getting good.

01:37:53.458 --> 01:37:59.141
Just to flesh this out, the range of possibilities that you've given where you don't produce any protein at all.

01:37:59.262 --> 01:38:00.722
It's a scale of one to 200.

01:38:01.723 --> 01:38:02.023
One to 200.

01:38:02.504 --> 01:38:07.267
So that means you can have with the same dose of RNA between one or near zero and 200.

01:38:07.467 --> 01:38:09.408
Each RNA molecule.

01:38:09.648 --> 01:38:10.449
produces how many proteins?

01:38:10.469 --> 01:38:11.389
No, no, no, no, it's not that.

01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:20.835
It's in total, in vivo, when you inject it, X amount of RNA that can give you a production of spike variation.

01:38:21.175 --> 01:38:25.498
So the spread of the spike production can be between one or zero and 200.

01:38:25.558 --> 01:38:29.341
Because like the same mRNA can produce more than one protein.

01:38:29.541 --> 01:38:30.141
Yes, yes.

01:38:30.161 --> 01:38:34.124
Usually the ribosome are daisy chained, but in some cells they're not.

01:38:34.804 --> 01:38:38.945
So essentially, when you don't have a pathology, that's a point I would like the people to understand.

01:38:39.465 --> 01:38:42.246
It is illegal, because a medication needs a pathology.

01:38:42.266 --> 01:38:44.226
Because you need to know the dose that you're delivering.

01:38:44.266 --> 01:38:44.446
Yes.

01:38:44.866 --> 01:38:45.126
OK.

01:38:45.966 --> 01:38:48.767
So I'm not going to stay away from illegal, because I'm not a lawyer.

01:38:48.807 --> 01:38:49.467
No, no, me neither.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:50.327
But you understand.

01:38:50.367 --> 01:38:53.968
But it seems irresponsible not to know the dosing you're giving, right?

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:55.248
Not the dose of a factor.

01:38:55.548 --> 01:38:57.529
And I want the people to understand two things.

01:38:57.769 --> 01:39:02.010
Normal vaccine, I already mentioned, you need a dose, and it needs to be inserted.

01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:03.010
So let's talk about that.

01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:08.951
These weren't the only vaccines that were given or produced during the COVID crisis to people.

01:39:09.011 --> 01:39:14.473
Like there are other vaccines, like the Novavax used a more traditional classical technology.

01:39:14.553 --> 01:39:16.013
A protein vaccine, a split protein.

01:39:16.053 --> 01:39:23.155
And then there's also another kind of vaccines, the adenovirus vector vaccines that were used in the J&J vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine.

01:39:23.295 --> 01:39:27.196
The interesting thing is, is that with Novavax, I think they still had an adjuvant.

01:39:27.356 --> 01:39:29.837
And with Novavax, they produced it in moth

01:39:31.093 --> 01:39:34.055
cells, which may mean that it's folded kind of different.

01:39:34.175 --> 01:39:37.457
So that's, you know, that's also just something to consider.

01:39:37.477 --> 01:39:38.618
Okay.

01:39:38.858 --> 01:39:47.363
So how does the mRNA differ on the posology that, you know, the dose that's delivered, the variation of the dose that's delivered versus those other vaccine technologies?

01:39:47.443 --> 01:39:47.743
Okay.

01:39:48.063 --> 01:39:55.588
In the RNA vaccine, we already discussed in the adenoviral vector, because an RNA needs to be carried inside a cell.

01:39:55.808 --> 01:39:57.009
So either you have a kind of a

01:39:57.569 --> 01:40:05.638
Gallinic mean a kind of a vehicle called a liposome with other things in it and you deliver hoping that it enters the right cell Targeting will be a problem.

01:40:05.658 --> 01:40:13.387
There will be a second topic But yeah, but the thing is adenovirus they can get their way to sell because our receptors are

01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:15.349
Adam Barth says it's another cold virus.

01:40:15.369 --> 01:40:15.609
Yes.

01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:17.872
And so it's very effective at finding its way to cells.

01:40:17.972 --> 01:40:18.172
Yes.

01:40:18.773 --> 01:40:20.895
But you have to kill the virus.

01:40:20.915 --> 01:40:24.379
That means you have to make it defective unable to reproduce itself.

01:40:24.459 --> 01:40:29.084
And then you put the DNA there instead of RNA and the virus will go infect a cell.

01:40:29.124 --> 01:40:33.329
The DNA would be translated into mRNA and the mRNA would generate the protein also.

01:40:33.889 --> 01:40:36.830
So there he said that you put DNA into the adenovirus.

01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:50.116
And so I think that's a goal for us because we've been waiting for someone to at least explain the difference between adenovirus and the lipid nanoparticle transfections successfully.

01:40:50.156 --> 01:40:51.117
And I think he did that.

01:40:51.777 --> 01:40:58.180
He didn't specifically say that that's transformation, but I have said before that the adenovirus was transformation.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.385
and that the mRNA and lipid nanoparticles are transfections.

01:41:03.445 --> 01:41:06.048
And so again, he could be saying that right now.

01:41:06.128 --> 01:41:07.510
They could be saying that right now.

01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:11.814
At least Jay knows for sure that we would be advocating to say that right now.

01:41:11.874 --> 01:41:17.360
And I think that saying that right now would educate a hell of a lot more people than what they are saying right now.

01:41:18.061 --> 01:41:36.172
Both of these people potentially could speak to a lot of academicians who are also should be keenly aware of what transfection and transformation means and then maybe have a light bulb moment go on and say, oh my gosh, I can't believe that I told Grammy to take these.

01:41:37.179 --> 01:41:38.882
It's like you'd have the same pathology problem.

01:41:39.043 --> 01:41:40.005
Yes, totally.

01:41:40.566 --> 01:41:42.670
Totally same pathology, but you have a bit of a lie.

01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:48.020
Because I've seen in the site of these companies, it's funny, they say, we're not delivering a vaccine.

01:41:48.885 --> 01:41:55.247
We use adenovirus, we're less dangerous because you know, those companies vie for the same market, so there's competition.

01:41:55.847 --> 01:41:57.107
And it's equally bad.

01:41:57.367 --> 01:42:04.309
At the beginning of the pandemic, I told my friend to take J&J because number one, it was in a viral particle that I had used before.

01:42:05.069 --> 01:42:06.990
And number two, it was a single shot.

01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:12.371
And fortunately for me, my friend has not gotten a booster or anything like that.

01:42:12.411 --> 01:42:15.812
And so I hope that he's going to be okay and live a long, healthy life.

01:42:16.696 --> 01:42:22.219
At the time, I was also thinking kind of like what he's explaining, that maybe this is safer or better.

01:42:22.599 --> 01:42:24.840
And I don't think it is.

01:42:25.621 --> 01:42:27.862
But one claimed to be safer than the other.

01:42:29.303 --> 01:42:33.025
OK, but that's a matter for epidemiology, not a matter for microbiology.

01:42:34.221 --> 01:42:37.888
So it's a matter for epidemiology, not for molecular biology.

01:42:37.908 --> 01:42:46.444
You see, there's no understanding of the immune system that could allow you to decide whether or not these technologies are any good.

01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:50.132
That's up to the peer-reviewed journals.

01:42:50.192 --> 01:42:52.013
That's up to epidemiology.

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:53.213
Stop lying!

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:55.054
I mean, he's an epidemiologist.

01:42:55.574 --> 01:42:58.295
And that guy said he was an epidemiologist in the beginning.

01:42:58.395 --> 01:43:00.916
And he said that he was an epidemiologist in the beginning.

01:43:01.377 --> 01:43:05.418
So if it's up to epidemiology, why can't we talk about that now?

01:43:05.498 --> 01:43:05.598
It's 2024.

01:43:05.718 --> 01:43:06.439
It's funny.

01:43:06.519 --> 01:43:09.580
They say, we're not delivering a vaccine.

01:43:10.595 --> 01:43:16.822
use adenovirus, we're less dangerous because, you know, those companies vie for the same market, so there's competition.

01:43:17.402 --> 01:43:21.286
And it's equally bad, but one claims to be safer than the other.

01:43:21.647 --> 01:43:27.072
That's... Okay, but that's a matter for epidemiology, not a matter for molecular biology.

01:43:27.553 --> 01:43:33.099
But okay, so maybe we can talk about that toward the end, because that's been the theme of many of the

01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:36.975
of the conversations I've had with my guests over the course of the pandemic.

01:43:38.016 --> 01:43:44.104
But here I just want to focus on molecular biology because I think people need to understand exactly the nature of the technology.

01:43:44.765 --> 01:43:46.728
What about the classical vaccines?

01:43:47.188 --> 01:43:48.230
The classical vaccine

01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:54.151
control the dose because you generate the protein, whether it's from a culture or from molecular biology tools.

01:43:54.231 --> 01:44:02.333
I mean, we can transform a cell like E. coli in a sex cell and leading them to produce the amount and the quality of the epitope or the full gene that we have.

01:44:02.353 --> 01:44:03.334
We can purify that.

01:44:03.694 --> 01:44:05.534
We can make it into a product vaccine.

01:44:05.554 --> 01:44:06.614
We don't need any liposome.

01:44:06.634 --> 01:44:07.535
We don't need any vector.

01:44:07.735 --> 01:44:08.975
We inject the protein directly

01:44:09.395 --> 01:44:10.596
in the interstitium?

01:44:11.016 --> 01:44:23.126
I would answer PMC, Dana in the chat and say, I think the short answer is yes.

01:44:23.486 --> 01:44:27.049
It's more likely to stay localized, in my humble opinion, yes.

01:44:27.889 --> 01:44:29.771
If you injected it in the blood, then no.

01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:36.336
But if you wanted to keep it in a place like the skin, or intramuscularly, if you did it,

01:44:37.256 --> 01:44:43.345
right, I think that the lipid nanoparticle just size-wise and sort of

01:44:44.909 --> 01:44:58.979
chemical attribute-wise, it feels like, my gut tells me, the lipid nanoparticle has a much higher propensity for wide distribution than the adenovirus particle does, but that's kind of just going on my gut.

01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:11.389
In between the cells and the white blood cell, they will roam around, and because our cells are a specialized fragment alien thing, they will capture and then we'll process the antigen and start the immunization process.

01:45:12.029 --> 01:45:19.895
So that's not really being completely genuine because we often conjugate a recombinant protein to a metal.

01:45:20.375 --> 01:45:27.381
We conjugate a recombinant protein to a known immunogen, like a diphtheria toxin derivative.

01:45:27.801 --> 01:45:31.764
So there are ways to do it that involve adjuvanting a protein.

01:45:31.924 --> 01:45:37.068
And so to just say that it's looking for alien things is not completely right.

01:45:37.088 --> 01:45:39.150
You have to annoy the immune system.

01:45:39.878 --> 01:45:45.879
The immune system is not going to react and form memory unless you give it an alarming reason to do it.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.740
And oftentimes they use toxins to do that.

01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.321
Those are called adjuvants in vaccine technology.

01:45:51.601 --> 01:45:54.461
That's the big things for the people who use it.

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.302
So you can control the dose.

01:45:56.622 --> 01:45:57.322
And the location.

01:45:57.822 --> 01:45:59.163
And the plasma.

01:45:59.783 --> 01:46:00.643
Right, so it's in the plasma.

01:46:00.663 --> 01:46:01.603
So it's in the plasma.

01:46:01.623 --> 01:46:03.624
Yeah, you're intramuscular, but it goes around a bit.

01:46:03.884 --> 01:46:03.984
OK.

01:46:04.404 --> 01:46:06.284
So let's come back to the biodiesel.

01:46:06.304 --> 01:46:08.145
I still have a few more questions about the dosing.

01:46:08.465 --> 01:46:08.645
Yes.

01:46:10.738 --> 01:46:15.364
So why was there, this seems like such an obvious point, right?

01:46:15.404 --> 01:46:25.238
So you're essentially turning, with the mRNA technology and the adenovirus technologies, your body into a factory of uncertain fidelity.

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.320
Yes, that's exactly right.

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:33.106
Whereas with the traditional vaccines, the fidelity is controlled because you produce it outside.

01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:37.549
You control and you inject a known quantity.

01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:40.052
So you have a definite pathology.

01:46:41.133 --> 01:46:46.077
And then if you don't mind, we can jump to cancer vaccine because people are lost and this is cancer vaccine.

01:46:46.317 --> 01:46:48.459
So actually, that's a really important topic.

01:46:50.086 --> 01:46:58.033
And the reason to explore it is because the mRNA technology, the platforms, were not originally used or tried for vaccines.

01:46:58.393 --> 01:47:05.319
In fact, this is the first vaccine technology, mRNA application technologies that actually worked.

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:12.686
Before that, there had been no vaccines that had used this mRNA technology for delivery.

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:14.307
The very, very first one was the COVID one.

01:47:15.965 --> 01:47:26.838
They've gotten the mRNA technology to work on specific examples of immune-modulated immune cells that attack a cancer.

01:47:27.658 --> 01:47:29.240
That's really amazing.

01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.324
He said the COVID vaccine worked.

01:47:32.664 --> 01:47:33.365
Stop lying!

01:47:34.146 --> 01:47:34.746
Whoa!

01:47:36.457 --> 01:47:38.659
used or tried for vaccines.

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:47.346
In fact, this is the first vaccine technology, mRNA application technologies that actually worked, right?

01:47:47.406 --> 01:47:52.570
Before that, there had been no vaccines that had used this mRNA technology.

01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:54.932
It's the very, very first one was the COVID one.

01:47:56.633 --> 01:47:59.236
They are tried in animals.

01:47:59.596 --> 01:48:02.299
They are tried in humans.

01:48:02.339 --> 01:48:03.481
For humans, that was the first.

01:48:04.061 --> 01:48:09.267
Okay, so how could this technology be used for cancer?

01:48:09.707 --> 01:48:12.871
Okay, it's time from work done in Brussels in the Rockefeller

01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:14.291
30 years ago already.

01:48:14.632 --> 01:48:22.074
Cancer cells have different surface antigens, so they can be recognized by the immune system like a bacteria, but you have to define.

01:48:22.394 --> 01:48:32.478
So if you have a platform able to transform the cell and trigger the immune system to recognize the label, oh, this is cancer label, they will attack the cancer cell and then you fight.

01:48:32.738 --> 01:48:33.799
The concept is very clean.

01:48:34.219 --> 01:48:37.320
It has a tremendous application and it worked.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:41.461
some extent because there are a lot of studies but never work massive scale.

01:48:41.741 --> 01:48:43.882
But here again, pathology is controlled.

01:48:43.902 --> 01:48:46.543
How do we do a cancer vaccine with RNA?

01:48:46.883 --> 01:48:53.645
Well, we take your own cells of cancer, we analyze them or we make tests, we know the antigen to target.

01:48:54.045 --> 01:48:59.487
So we take your white blood cell, a certain type of cell called dendritic cell, which are the presenting

01:48:59.927 --> 01:49:00.147
cell.

01:49:00.287 --> 01:49:02.228
You know, in the white blood cell, we have many types.

01:49:02.708 --> 01:49:07.830
Some subset of cells are there to present the antigen to other white blood cells to immunize.

01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:12.531
So there is a cell type in your body that capture the alien and say, here, attack this.

01:49:12.591 --> 01:49:15.352
But don't attack that at the same time, because they are ores.

01:49:15.592 --> 01:49:21.714
You have to attack the intruders, the external antigens, the intruders, and you have to protect your own physiology.

01:49:22.154 --> 01:49:44.064
So this APC, antigen-presenting cell, and there are a few, and dendritic cells are the main, we capture them from your blood, we purify them, we transfer them with the gene, we give them, we train them, by we're saying, with the cancer antigen, we purify them, and then we control, oh, they produce the antigen, they present it, everything works, and then we re-inject them in your body.

01:49:44.164 --> 01:49:46.586
And then your body recognizes them as foreign?

01:49:46.886 --> 01:49:49.127
No, the body... See?

01:49:50.071 --> 01:49:52.458
What is he, is he even following along?

01:49:53.701 --> 01:49:57.310
Maybe, maybe he's telling the truth that he doesn't have the...

01:49:58.194 --> 01:50:00.636
the sophistication to understand my biology.

01:50:00.676 --> 01:50:01.457
Maybe it's true.

01:50:02.178 --> 01:50:03.459
Holy balls.

01:50:03.559 --> 01:50:09.765
They took the cells out of the patient and then trained the dendritic cells.

01:50:09.825 --> 01:50:19.173
Maybe they even transformed or transfected them in order to get them to present, in order to get them to be reactive to this particular protein.

01:50:19.193 --> 01:50:21.816
And then they put those dendritic cells back in the people

01:50:22.376 --> 01:50:29.838
And then if you knew anything about immunology, those dendritic cells could go and activate T cells that recognize those epitopes.

01:50:31.459 --> 01:50:40.781
It's kind of an interesting mythology that they can take your cancer cells out, they can look for a specific marker, but it's not a mythology.

01:50:42.142 --> 01:50:43.082
It's totally real.

01:50:44.946 --> 01:50:46.790
And they've done it with lots of people.

01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:54.306
There are also kinds of cancers that have similar signals on the outside, so very easy to derive an immunotherapy that's specific for them.

01:50:55.168 --> 01:51:01.294
Because when cells go into a cancerous state, they start to express proteins in ways that are aberrant.

01:51:01.795 --> 01:51:05.298
And sometimes that overexpression results in surface expression.

01:51:05.919 --> 01:51:14.387
Sometimes that overexpression results in changes in expression of proteins that would normally not be expressed because they're not dividing anymore.

01:51:15.248 --> 01:51:24.116
And so when a tissue reverts to division again, then the presentation profile that the immune system would see would be different.

01:51:24.136 --> 01:51:25.517
And there's two parts of that.

01:51:25.597 --> 01:51:34.205
There's the proteins that are on the outside, and then there are the proteins that are specifically presented on MHC1, on HLA proteins.

01:51:37.247 --> 01:51:50.036
And that's why I think it is so important for us to really understand this molecular biology at that level where we can hear that these people are not being precise enough to be imparting any real knowledge.

01:51:50.497 --> 01:51:56.901
And even this guy is not really teaching Jay anything because Jay almost completely fell out of the cart there.

01:51:56.941 --> 01:51:59.103
And so then they recognize it as foreign, what?

01:51:59.488 --> 01:52:14.718
with the APC, with the dendritic cell, the dendritic cell already transformed, and they present, so it's your own cell, which have already been trained into, and they present to their body cell, other white blood cell in the blood, hey guys, this is what you need to attack.

01:52:14.738 --> 01:52:21.103
This is what you need to, so it trains the other white cells to go after the antigens, which are found not just on the presenting cell.

01:52:21.123 --> 01:52:23.704
And an antigen presenting cell doesn't train

01:52:24.685 --> 01:52:34.390
White blood cells, an antigen-presenting cell can activate them, and it has to be a dormant one, ones that are in lymph nodes.

01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:37.552
It's so extraordinary.

01:52:37.652 --> 01:52:46.356
On the tumor, and then the APC train the white blood cell, the lymphocyte, not to name them, and the lymphocyte can attack like crazy your cancer, and you can get rid of it.

01:52:46.677 --> 01:52:51.299
We have some results in a very difficult tumor at the base of the brain of children.

01:52:51.499 --> 01:52:52.840
We have some result in melanoma.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:55.582
You know from this we have some results.

01:52:55.762 --> 01:53:19.379
We don't had doesn't work It's not perfect, but we can tweak it so that we seem to get the results that we think we're getting but it's not Transfecting the kid it's a very careful bone marrow sample or lymph node sample that's then isolated and transformed and fooled around with and whatever and then they put it back in and that's a person that's gonna die and

01:53:21.468 --> 01:53:23.269
So it's okay if it's imperfect.

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:26.171
It's okay if it only buys the kid 12 more months.

01:53:27.172 --> 01:53:28.333
Or even 10 years.

01:53:28.353 --> 01:53:35.778
It doesn't mean we understand anything about how to use transfection and transformation to augment a healthy human.

01:53:36.279 --> 01:53:37.760
To use as a vaccine.

01:53:40.478 --> 01:53:40.738
skin.

01:53:41.038 --> 01:53:43.560
But they're not, you understand, it's precision medicine.

01:53:43.861 --> 01:53:45.942
It's not only you make the medication for a patient.

01:53:46.563 --> 01:53:47.524
It's precision medicine.

01:53:47.704 --> 01:53:52.087
You cannot inject the same antigen to 10,000 people because your cancer is not mine.

01:53:52.387 --> 01:53:57.571
So the technology is the basis for a fantastic revolution in medical science.

01:53:57.992 --> 01:53:59.033
It's precision medicine.

01:53:59.093 --> 01:54:00.474
Just so we're clear, so what you mean is

01:54:01.485 --> 01:54:03.786
Precision medicine, he says.

01:54:03.806 --> 01:54:04.927
Let's say you had a cancer.

01:54:05.027 --> 01:54:08.229
I go identify the cell, the specific cell.

01:54:08.269 --> 01:54:09.089
I've done a biopsy.

01:54:09.129 --> 01:54:13.772
I specify the specific antigens that are unique to your cancer.

01:54:14.412 --> 01:54:22.297
And then I modify, I create this mRNA messenger thing that then is used essentially to transform

01:54:22.637 --> 01:54:30.946
the cell, the APCs, the antigen-presenting cells that are then re-injected into you, and now those train your immune system to go after your cells.

01:54:30.986 --> 01:54:38.775
If they were injected into me, it might work or not, because there are some antigens that are common in all cancer, and there are some antigens that are specifics.

01:54:39.075 --> 01:54:42.279
So the technology allows us to tailor the medication.

01:54:42.299 --> 01:54:43.180
I mean, an imprint?

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:43.820
There he said it.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.502
He's going to tailor the medication to your cancer, tailor it to you.

01:54:47.602 --> 01:54:49.063
It's personalized medicine.

01:54:49.523 --> 01:54:54.065
It's exactly why the vaccine schedule failed because they just said it earlier.

01:54:54.105 --> 01:54:56.767
It's got to be specific for your HLA subtype.

01:54:56.807 --> 01:55:00.689
He even hypothesized that maybe that's the reason why some people make a lot of spike.

01:55:01.249 --> 01:55:09.576
Some people make a little spike because it's your HLA subtype or maybe it's because when they make a lot of spike and their HLSA subtype is really sensitive to the spike.

01:55:09.977 --> 01:55:14.741
And so we should have made a vaccine that was specific for each person's HLA subtype.

01:55:15.181 --> 01:55:16.122
And then here we go.

01:55:16.202 --> 01:55:28.633
Now we need to screen everybody for their entire genetic immunogenic proteomic background in order to tailor make a transfection just for you.

01:55:31.055 --> 01:55:47.160
Holy man, can't you just see the very, very, very, very slippery slope that leads right down to, okay, we're gonna take a blood sample from your baby and we're gonna give it to the AI and then we'll have your complimentary suite of mRNA vaccines in about 45 minutes.

01:55:47.661 --> 01:56:00.445
It'll come off the molecular printer and once you hear the bell, we'll come back into the room and there will be six nurses and we'll just do six injections and your kid will be done for the first six months and it'll be great.

01:56:00.925 --> 01:56:03.207
You want something that's unique to you, right?

01:56:03.247 --> 01:56:06.310
Because you don't want other parts of your body attacked.

01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:13.557
You don't want, and if you and I have common proteins, presumably there are other parts of your body that have those proteins, you minimize the side effects.

01:56:13.597 --> 01:56:18.041
This is, for the people to understand, this assures what we call the precision medicine.

01:56:18.101 --> 01:56:18.842
We're precise.

01:56:19.022 --> 01:56:20.823
With RNA, we can be precise.

01:56:21.064 --> 01:56:22.545
It's like a surgical instrument.

01:56:22.865 --> 01:56:25.368
I can tailor a medication for you or for a group.

01:56:26.172 --> 01:56:27.813
But that's not what was done with the COVID vaccine.

01:56:27.833 --> 01:56:27.893
No.

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:29.935
It's a single thing for the whole planet.

01:56:31.296 --> 01:56:31.616
Oh, wow.

01:56:31.656 --> 01:56:34.239
The COVID vaccine should have been more specific.

01:56:35.139 --> 01:56:36.520
It should have been more specific.

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:39.183
It should have been based on our own biology.

01:56:39.263 --> 01:56:41.124
It should have been more precision medicine.

01:56:46.786 --> 01:56:49.547
There's a contradiction between the basic tenet of precision.

01:56:50.087 --> 01:56:52.848
Just to defend it a little bit.

01:56:53.588 --> 01:57:06.112
Remember, this guy is a self-reported bioweapons expert, just like Robert Malone is a self-reported bioweapons expert, just like Merrill Nass is a self-reported bioweapons expert.

01:57:06.132 --> 01:57:09.974
Again, for purposes of steel manning, you have a virus.

01:57:11.752 --> 01:57:12.712
that has a sequence.

01:57:13.752 --> 01:57:21.754
It's not a different sequence for you or a different sequence for me, although that's technically not true, but let's just say for the same.

01:57:21.854 --> 01:57:26.855
In that case, you would want one antigen presented.

01:57:27.175 --> 01:57:41.618
But you want a dose to stimulate, a pathology to stimulate the immune system the right way, which we do in cancer therapy, which we didn't do here because we didn't control the expression, the fabrication of the protein that we want it to be fabricated.

01:57:41.758 --> 01:57:41.938
Right.

01:57:42.118 --> 01:57:46.843
But you do it in cancer therapy, because you do all of this stuff in ex vivo.

01:57:46.963 --> 01:57:51.667
And then you put some of these cells that pass your screening test back into the patient.

01:57:52.127 --> 01:57:56.051
And you do this all in the context of a patient that's gonna die.

01:57:58.553 --> 01:58:06.540
Not in the context of an athlete who's 16 years old, who has dreams of getting an NCAA contract, even if it's division three.

01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:10.997
division, it would be NCAA scholarship.

01:58:11.157 --> 01:58:24.845
And even if it's division three, and they're not making any, any effort to differentiate between a cancer vaccine, which is again, being applied to somebody who's going to die.

01:58:24.865 --> 01:58:30.249
And a 16 year old that's totally healthy.

01:58:31.892 --> 01:58:36.827
that they are also coercing into thinking that, you know, this COVID vaccine worked.

01:58:37.488 --> 01:58:38.852
Stop lying!

01:58:40.186 --> 01:58:41.147
So it's different.

01:58:41.167 --> 01:58:51.793
So this technology application for SARS or for others, because other vaccines are coming against virus and bacteria, is essentially a misnomer and something that's not yet ripe.

01:58:52.113 --> 01:58:57.156
Because in cancer therapy, we have a protocol, and these are experimental, experimental medicine.

01:58:57.576 --> 01:59:01.259
And in the classical vaccination, we have standard protocol for the past two centuries.

01:59:01.459 --> 01:59:06.822
Here we come with a new platform that's not yet ready for big leagues, just on the first

01:59:07.262 --> 01:59:10.565
approach in terms of production of what needs to be effective.

01:59:10.965 --> 01:59:11.746
That's a huge thing.

01:59:12.086 --> 01:59:13.407
And I want the people to understand.

01:59:13.487 --> 01:59:15.889
And the tools to control that are not yet invented.

01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:18.211
He said that like three times now.

01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:20.774
The tools to control it are not invented yet.

01:59:20.814 --> 01:59:21.835
It's just annoying.

01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:28.600
2022, to have the first paper to having fine methodology to have measured the production in vivo.

01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:29.621
But not control.

01:59:30.022 --> 01:59:30.822
It's still not control.

01:59:30.842 --> 01:59:31.343
No, it's not control.

01:59:31.363 --> 01:59:32.624
We can measure how bad it is.

01:59:33.089 --> 01:59:33.429
Yeah.

01:59:33.449 --> 01:59:40.153
So there's a variance in the amount of protein you produce per unit of vaccines.

01:59:40.493 --> 01:59:45.415
So for instance, let's just take the dosing, the big fight over dosing for children.

01:59:45.455 --> 01:59:49.097
Oh, that's totally stupid because, oh, we will decrease by weight.

01:59:49.237 --> 01:59:49.858
It's meaningless.

01:59:50.518 --> 01:59:58.747
Because depending on the child, the metabolist did not... Maybe a child will produce 100 copies per... Or more mass.

01:59:59.308 --> 02:00:02.972
Let's look at the effector, the protein, the end product.

02:00:03.472 --> 02:00:12.001
A child might produce with the same dose, but a different child might produce different... And the child will produce more because they're metabolists.

02:00:12.702 --> 02:00:13.362
in overdrive.

02:00:14.123 --> 02:00:15.263
OK, let me let me just step back.

02:00:15.523 --> 02:00:15.743
Yes.

02:00:16.164 --> 02:00:27.588
Just to cover the finish, just to put a lid on this part of the conversation, because it seems to me that the idea of using our bodies as an antigen factory.

02:00:29.529 --> 02:00:31.610
Why did you say antigen factory now?

02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:36.572
You said vaccine factory the first five times you said it is a challenge you don't need.

02:00:38.233 --> 02:00:38.393
Right.

02:00:38.813 --> 02:00:39.974
In principle, you could use

02:00:40.996 --> 02:00:47.701
out other processes, molecular biological processes outside the body, and then introduce the antigen you want at exactly the dose you want.

02:00:48.201 --> 02:00:51.483
Why take on, and you could even use the mRNA.

02:00:51.503 --> 02:00:51.563
Why?

02:00:52.064 --> 02:01:06.994
Because alone, a protein will not cause an immune reaction, unless you put a little designer epitope in it, like something that EpiVax might've identified, which will activate multiple HLA subtypes all by itself.

02:01:07.858 --> 02:01:10.701
Because that's exactly what Epivax was looking for.

02:01:11.241 --> 02:01:14.665
They were looking for technologies that they could use.

02:01:15.125 --> 02:01:16.667
Little epitopes.

02:01:16.767 --> 02:01:18.849
That's where we met very, very first time.

02:01:18.869 --> 02:01:23.253
I'm looking skinny in that picture.

02:01:23.693 --> 02:01:24.814
That was the first time we met.

02:01:24.854 --> 02:01:28.418
And then the first picture I showed you was a couple years after that.

02:01:31.986 --> 02:01:52.466
So this is all just a really frustrating, imprecise discussion about what I think are very tractable subject areas that can be described very succinctly and very precisely so that lots of people with a broad background can understand the breadth and the depth of the

02:01:54.233 --> 02:02:12.719
lies that were told in order to coerce us into accepting transformation and transfection, which they still haven't said out loud, as new ideas instead of already very old ideas that have been used in limited context with people that are going to die for a long time.

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:13.540
Yes.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:19.422
Just to finish, just to put a lid on this part of the conversation, because it seems to me

02:02:20.402 --> 02:02:30.846
that the idea of using our bodies as an antigen factory is a challenge you don't need, right?

02:02:30.966 --> 02:02:39.929
In principle, you could use other processes, molecular biological processes outside the body, and then introduce the antigen you want at exactly the dose you want.

02:02:40.029 --> 02:02:41.950
And see, so this either is him

02:02:44.356 --> 02:03:04.768
really dropping his pants and showing his backside to everybody in the sense of, I didn't understand vaccines well enough since I met Jonathan Cui to know that it's not just proteins, but it's also adjuvants and that the adjuvants a lot of times are activating your immune system in a way that the proteins couldn't.

02:03:05.929 --> 02:03:07.650
Does he really expect us to believe?

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.300
is, on the other hand, Martin.

02:03:11.781 --> 02:03:18.722
Is Martin going to allow him to just say that traditional vaccines are this protein?

02:03:18.762 --> 02:03:20.583
We just make the protein and put it in.

02:03:21.023 --> 02:03:22.303
That's not how it works.

02:03:23.304 --> 02:03:35.947
They need to be adjuvanted, either with a co-injected toxin, adjuvant, annoying thing, chemicals or chemicals, chemical or chemicals.

02:03:37.054 --> 02:03:46.913
Or it's got to be adjuvanted, like really stuck to, conjugated to, a protein that's already known to be irritating to the immune system, like diphtheria toxin.

02:03:49.471 --> 02:03:53.412
Why take on, and you could even use the mRNA technology for that, right?

02:03:53.452 --> 02:03:58.253
So you could induce, I don't know, E. coli or something to produce the thing you want.

02:03:59.014 --> 02:04:02.334
Oh, so you could use E. coli to produce the thing you want.

02:04:02.394 --> 02:04:11.457
So is he really, is he really suggesting that he doesn't understand my biology when he's able to say that?

02:04:12.679 --> 02:04:22.961
that he could use recombinant molecular biological techniques, you know, the ones that they use to make venom, the ones that they use to make monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies.

02:04:23.441 --> 02:04:40.245
Ladies and gentlemen, all of these people are circumlocuting the truth, which is that there are known molecular biological techniques that are used by pharmaceutical companies around the world to produce all of the protein biologics that are currently in use.

02:04:41.408 --> 02:04:57.511
And those techniques include using recombinant DNA to transform bacterial cultures so that those bacterial cultures will translate that DNA into RNA and then translate that RNA into protein.

02:04:57.551 --> 02:04:59.432
Then those cultures are lysed.

02:04:59.852 --> 02:05:05.193
The protein is purified and that protein is then sold as a pharmaceutical biologic.

02:05:08.092 --> 02:05:32.499
And so it would be very trivial for these two high level professionals to explain how universal this molecular biological suite of methodologies is, how widely it is used around the world, what applications it has, and how mRNA is actually stopping short of producing a protein.

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:47.403
And it's one of the reasons why, you know, if you're producing a protein and you can screen for the protein by weight, and you can do all those things that all the other protein that's made doesn't matter so much.

02:05:48.324 --> 02:05:49.566
You can separate it out.

02:05:51.869 --> 02:05:55.111
But when you're making RNA, you don't have that possibility.

02:05:55.451 --> 02:05:58.032
You don't have the possibility of separating DNA out.

02:05:58.072 --> 02:06:02.875
You don't have the possibility of separating big and little and all these other RNAs out.

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:03.956
It's too expensive.

02:06:04.036 --> 02:06:07.518
It's too much of a high loss prospect.

02:06:10.579 --> 02:06:13.321
They're not explaining it adequately at all.

02:06:13.421 --> 02:06:14.682
This is really sad.

02:06:15.356 --> 02:06:17.017
That's what's done.

02:06:17.537 --> 02:06:24.940
Some molecular biology vaccines were done since the 80s and the 90s, like the hepatitis B vaccine.

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:32.983
I cannot name a name, but it was a genetically engineered vaccine that was produced by molecular biology technologies, but pure protein.

02:06:33.749 --> 02:06:36.210
Hepatitis B also has adjuvants in it.

02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:44.152
Hepatitis B vaccine, crazy enough, I didn't say this earlier, when I went to the clinic, they asked me if I was up to date on my tetanus shot.

02:06:44.252 --> 02:06:46.853
They asked me if I take the flu shot and the COVID shot.

02:06:48.073 --> 02:06:58.116
When I went to CVS to pick up my antibiotics, the lady said, when you feel better, you can come back here for your hepatitis B and your flu shot whenever you're ready.

02:06:58.877 --> 02:06:59.757
Thanks for coming.

02:07:02.045 --> 02:07:05.349
So why take the additional step?

02:07:05.369 --> 02:07:08.192
I mean, you could still use the MRI technology, just don't inject it into humans.

02:07:08.232 --> 02:07:15.640
I told you, my guess, which may be true, may not be true, it decreased production costs.

02:07:16.201 --> 02:07:20.626
Less footprint, less production plant, because a single line can produce any big issue.

02:07:20.706 --> 02:07:21.467
One, that's a first.

02:07:21.727 --> 02:07:23.248
And second, the big payoff.

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.551
is not the vaccine against COVID.

02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:37.521
There have been in the past 10, 15 years, a lot of products based on mRNA for cancer and other disease, orphan disease, et cetera, that were not allowed by the FDA because they were experimental.

02:07:37.861 --> 02:07:47.510
So my interpretation, but there I have to be careful because I don't want to levy a negotiation, is that some people use the COVID vaccine as a demonstrator

02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:51.154
to get clearance for the technological platform as a whole.

02:07:51.214 --> 02:07:54.898
It works so well with COVID that you should miss this FDA.

02:07:54.998 --> 02:07:56.800
But Jay just said it worked.

02:07:57.361 --> 02:07:59.343
You guys are agreeing that it worked.

02:07:59.463 --> 02:08:02.807
So FDA, grant us the clearance for all the products we have in the pipeline.

02:08:03.007 --> 02:08:14.314
We're already seeing this with the mRNA vaccine product that's apparently been produced or is being offered for the avian flu.

02:08:14.494 --> 02:08:19.117
Yes, but that's vaccine, but you have also other things that are

02:08:19.687 --> 02:08:20.768
But that's vaccine.

02:08:21.108 --> 02:08:21.668
Oh, I see.

02:08:21.708 --> 02:08:23.670
Wait, he's going to do other therapeutics.

02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:24.450
I'm not vaccine.

02:08:24.651 --> 02:08:27.813
There is a product to target cholesterol in the liver.

02:08:27.973 --> 02:08:29.234
That's also a marinade base.

02:08:29.734 --> 02:08:32.016
And it's also already actually.

02:08:32.116 --> 02:08:38.661
And so all he's going to argue is, is that, yeah, these are also going to be imperfect until we make them precision.

02:08:39.341 --> 02:08:50.630
until we make them precise for each person's HLA subtype, there will still be a fundamental flaw in this generation of this technology, which mean in 10 years could solve every problem.

02:08:50.650 --> 02:08:57.916
So what you're saying is, it was, in a sense, a marketing idea, like in order to get people used to thinking about it.

02:08:58.596 --> 02:09:02.820
And so is Jay Bhattacharya actually pretending that he never heard that from me?

02:09:04.594 --> 02:09:09.516
Not when we met outside of Santa Cruz.

02:09:09.896 --> 02:09:11.417
Not when we met in Arizona.

02:09:18.659 --> 02:09:22.081
Because that's very disappointing, Dr. Bhattacharya.

02:09:23.801 --> 02:09:30.304
Because you know that's exactly what my message has been for a very long time now.

02:09:33.993 --> 02:09:38.296
And all of these people have known that that's been my message for a very long time now.

02:09:39.297 --> 02:09:42.359
Since the end of 2020, I have been saying that.

02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:52.927
Since the article in Nature came out with RNA understanding on one side and lipid nanoparticles on the other, I knew right away what they were trying to sell.

02:09:53.387 --> 02:09:59.732
They were trying to tell us that this technology was just waiting for the pandemic to come to maturity.

02:10:01.454 --> 02:10:24.020
And we are lucky, we should thank our lucky stars that guys like Tony Fauci and Barney at the Vaccine Research Center for NIAID, that these guys had the foresight to invest in this crucial technology that this guy says can do everything eventually once we make it precise.

02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:28.402
Stop lying!

02:10:28.903 --> 02:10:32.685
It's a fair word, because as I said, I use the word demonstration.

02:10:33.065 --> 02:10:38.589
In technology, you want to make a demonstrator, a minimally viable product to get to the real product.

02:10:38.849 --> 02:10:42.772
And here, we make a plural in products, because you have a vaccine here for COVID.

02:10:43.432 --> 02:10:45.333
He never lost his job at Stanford.

02:10:45.373 --> 02:10:46.173
Are you kidding me?

02:10:46.193 --> 02:10:54.135
I can assure you there were like 110 products in the pipeline blocked because the regulators say we don't know we have to know more.

02:10:54.335 --> 02:10:56.916
Oh, here it works for mRNA technology.

02:10:56.996 --> 02:10:58.676
It works fantastically for COVID.

02:10:58.836 --> 02:10:59.877
We saved the planet.

02:11:00.197 --> 02:11:00.517
Uh-huh.

02:11:00.837 --> 02:11:03.218
So please pay attention to the other products.

02:11:03.578 --> 02:11:05.258
So are they questioning that narrative?

02:11:05.418 --> 02:11:06.438
Not at all.

02:11:06.478 --> 02:11:08.039
They're just telling you what's happening.

02:11:09.112 --> 02:11:22.875
So I tell you, there is a business opportunity here that I think was driving the whole effort because you have not only a business opportunity for vaccine against COVID, but you have 10, 50 times that over for the rest of medical, what we call precision medicine.

02:11:23.195 --> 02:11:26.156
And that's incentive enough to push that at all costs.

02:11:26.516 --> 02:11:28.017
That's my reading.

02:11:29.017 --> 02:11:29.237
Okay.

02:11:29.997 --> 02:11:30.517
Topic two.

02:11:30.837 --> 02:11:31.378
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:31.498 --> 02:11:32.438
That's only the first one.

02:11:32.478 --> 02:11:32.738
Yes.

02:11:32.999 --> 02:11:37.361
Topic two is the biodistribution of this vaccine.

02:11:37.701 --> 02:11:37.901
Yes.

02:11:38.001 --> 02:11:38.181
Right?

02:11:38.221 --> 02:11:39.202
So everyone was told.

02:11:39.282 --> 02:11:44.945
Are they going to mention Byron Bridle burning his career to try to get this message out?

02:11:45.906 --> 02:11:46.886
Both.

02:11:47.286 --> 02:11:52.589
When the vaccine first came out, you get an injection, and it stays in your deltoid muscle.

02:11:52.609 --> 02:11:52.809
Yes.

02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.290
Right?

02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.550
Yes.

02:11:53.730 --> 02:11:57.492
And all of the immune reaction that happens in the training happens

02:11:58.293 --> 02:12:01.764
roughly around the area where... Yeah, for a couple of days.

02:12:01.784 --> 02:12:03.349
So, was that true?

02:12:04.272 --> 02:12:06.093
Well, it turns out that it wasn't.

02:12:06.833 --> 02:12:11.395
And I have to step back and have the audience of your podcast understanding something else.

02:12:12.255 --> 02:12:19.118
When I need to produce a molecule with a message, it's not a random cell that can do it.

02:12:19.858 --> 02:12:25.181
I need to target the cell that will be effective at doing that, not only in term of production, but in term of function.

02:12:25.841 --> 02:12:30.543
So if I have a muscle cell producing the antigen and presenting, it won't work because the muscle

02:12:31.383 --> 02:12:34.888
as no known immunity function.

02:12:35.248 --> 02:12:36.470
It's the dendritic cell.

02:12:36.991 --> 02:12:44.401
So essentially, the fact that I can target a specific cell for a specific effect is of critical relevance.

02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:46.183
And you can control the literature.

02:12:46.423 --> 02:12:47.585
Everyone would like to

02:12:47.685 --> 02:12:48.225
Interesting.

02:12:48.285 --> 02:12:55.348
He just said that if a muscle cell gets transfected, it won't really do anything because a muscle cell doesn't have an immune function.

02:12:55.429 --> 02:13:01.971
So, the only thing that could happen if you transfect a muscle is that your immune system is going to have to come and clean those cells up.

02:13:02.472 --> 02:13:04.913
And best case scenario is they don't make a mistake.

02:13:04.953 --> 02:13:09.675
Worst case scenario is they make a mistake and then you have a problem because you have autoimmunity.

02:13:10.915 --> 02:13:13.917
I hope my leg starting to itch is a good thing.

02:13:14.597 --> 02:13:14.897
Shit.

02:13:16.158 --> 02:13:16.378
Oops.

02:13:17.568 --> 02:13:24.717
potentially, the fact that I can target a specific cell for a specific effect is of critical relevance.

02:13:25.098 --> 02:13:26.500
And you can control the literature.

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.482
Everyone would like to read a bit.

02:13:28.903 --> 02:13:32.788
They can look at molecular targeting, mRNA targeting.

02:13:33.248 --> 02:13:35.431
As we discussed, the vaccinologist

02:13:36.232 --> 02:14:02.074
are this debating or to best target the dc the genetic cell the apc and then they can't and they say well it's good enough because it worked 90 of the time in biology 90 of the time or 80 or 75 it's not good enough because wow he's making all kinds of claims like it worked a lot it saved the world it worked this was the first time it worked as a vaccine all of these things are being said right now and it's super frustrating because

02:14:02.614 --> 02:14:05.376
Jay Bhattacharya claims to be my friend.

02:14:05.436 --> 02:14:07.978
He claims to have known me for three years now.

02:14:08.398 --> 02:14:09.779
We met in 2022.

02:14:09.819 --> 02:14:12.541
I think it's really time.

02:14:12.561 --> 02:14:17.804
He's been on my show and he wouldn't talk about the fact that what if it's just murder and lies?

02:14:18.565 --> 02:14:23.528
He was on my show before we knew anything about supplementary oxygen and what it could do in a few hours.

02:14:25.444 --> 02:14:33.168
He was on my show when I could explain to him what clones were and why RNA virology is essentially just synthetic.

02:14:33.868 --> 02:14:35.609
It's just synthetic biology.

02:14:35.789 --> 02:14:36.809
It's just clones.

02:14:36.869 --> 02:14:46.874
It's just DNA and RNA being manufactured using standard recombinant biological techniques, using the machinery of bacteria to do it.

02:14:47.234 --> 02:14:52.397
And you can make any quantity you want to, including enough to make a pharmaceutical product.

02:14:57.253 --> 02:14:59.355
Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating.

02:15:01.656 --> 02:15:02.897
What about the 25 others?

02:15:03.197 --> 02:15:04.018
Where do they end up?

02:15:04.358 --> 02:15:05.799
And then you have severe side effects.

02:15:06.099 --> 02:15:09.101
So essentially, this localization is important.

02:15:09.482 --> 02:15:11.083
Yeah, so let's unpack this.

02:15:11.103 --> 02:15:22.911
So what you're saying is that if it does actually just stay in the muscle cells, it's not particularly effective as an immune training kind of operation.

02:15:25.273 --> 02:15:25.813
Hi, everyone.

02:15:26.437 --> 02:15:30.459
A quick word from our first and exciting sponsor, Alchemy Elements.

02:15:30.819 --> 02:15:39.423
That dude can't even wear a normal shirt anymore to do the little advertisements that he's got to do.

02:15:39.723 --> 02:15:40.824
Look at this guy.

02:15:40.844 --> 02:15:43.145
Wow.

02:15:44.565 --> 02:15:47.987
Alchemy Elements is a powerful adaptogenic supplement.

02:15:48.687 --> 02:15:52.849
For those of you who don't know, adaptogens are a class of plant compounds

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:58.737
primarily herbs and mushrooms, which can help build the mind and body's resistance to stress.

02:15:59.685 --> 02:16:18.878
Alchemy Elements contains a very unique and carefully selected blend of nine adaptogens, such as Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, Polygalorute, and Shilajit, and they can help boost energy, boost your immunity, and increase focus and overall stabilize your mood.

02:16:19.198 --> 02:16:23.881
You can have a wide array of effects, which can often depend from individual to individual.

02:16:24.301 --> 02:16:48.860
okay i'm sorry i had to i had to watch line uh i'll subscribe get recommend the apc i can get your discount and you won't regret it no because the muscle doesn't present the antigen it has to die and then my blood cell inflammation have to come and by chains and randomness the energetic cell has to gobble the antigen and then presenting it but

02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:53.003
They try to target the APC directly.

02:16:53.403 --> 02:16:59.068
I remember discussion before even COVID when people say, oh, they have the vaccine COVID in preparation.

02:16:59.088 --> 02:17:03.632
They initially thought to inject the vaccine directly in a ganglion.

02:17:04.193 --> 02:17:05.594
But it's not easy to do.

02:17:05.814 --> 02:17:07.916
Imagine where you have ganglion that are accessible.

02:17:07.936 --> 02:17:14.842
So ganglion, those are like lymph cells where the antigen-presenting cells and all the other cells and T cells are.

02:17:15.302 --> 02:17:18.964
So they were thinking about injecting directly into lymph node ganglia?

02:17:19.044 --> 02:17:19.304
What?

02:17:20.485 --> 02:17:22.386
That's, that's just ridiculous.

02:17:23.847 --> 02:17:40.215
And it's not any dissimilar to the cartoon that we used to play over the credits where they showed the mRNA going into the blood and then hitting a dendritic cell and then the dendritic cell, because it gets, when it gets transfected, I guess it presents the protein that it's transfected to.

02:17:40.235 --> 02:17:43.457
Oh my gosh, it's just crazy.

02:17:44.534 --> 02:17:45.695
pretty a nest of deceit.

02:17:45.955 --> 02:17:47.356
A ganglion is a nest of deceit.

02:17:47.556 --> 02:17:49.358
It's the best immunostimulation you can have.

02:17:49.398 --> 02:17:49.998
Dendritic cells.

02:17:50.038 --> 02:17:50.198
Yes.

02:17:50.458 --> 02:17:55.742
So essentially, you have ganglion here, you have there in the fold between your legs, you have them here.

02:17:56.163 --> 02:17:58.124
I mean, this is not an easy thing to do.

02:17:59.245 --> 02:17:59.385
Right.

02:17:59.405 --> 02:18:05.250
So like, it's not just a matter of like sticking it into your arm, you have to like, know where the where the lymph nodes are.

02:18:05.390 --> 02:18:05.590
Yes.

02:18:05.770 --> 02:18:07.852
And stick it into those lymph nodes specifically.

02:18:07.992 --> 02:18:09.633
I mean, that's not something you do at scale.

02:18:09.873 --> 02:18:10.553
No, exactly.

02:18:10.973 --> 02:18:14.914
So the location of the production is relevant.

02:18:15.294 --> 02:18:16.714
The muscle is not the best location.

02:18:16.814 --> 02:18:18.655
OK, so but that, but now it.

02:18:19.135 --> 02:18:19.975
And it has a side effect.

02:18:20.075 --> 02:18:21.675
I was going to say, just hold on, we're getting to that.

02:18:21.715 --> 02:18:26.916
So if we could tell the story slowly, you know, I'm not I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm very slow man.

02:18:26.976 --> 02:18:27.716
So you got to you got to like.

02:18:27.796 --> 02:18:28.336
Oh, yeah.

02:18:28.356 --> 02:18:29.016
You work at Stanford.

02:18:29.216 --> 02:18:29.656
Exactly.

02:18:29.736 --> 02:18:30.297
I understand.

02:18:30.337 --> 02:18:32.617
OK, so so let's just let's just take this one step at a time.

02:18:32.917 --> 02:18:35.357
So I thought they both worked at Stanford.

02:18:35.377 --> 02:18:36.938
I thought he was down the hall from him.

02:18:36.998 --> 02:18:37.898
What is going on?

02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:39.360
you inject it.

02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:39.881
Yes.

02:18:40.221 --> 02:18:46.784
And according to you, and actually according to a lot of the literature now I've seen subsequent to this, it doesn't just stay there.

02:18:47.384 --> 02:18:48.064
It might get in.

02:18:48.265 --> 02:18:49.265
That's a third problem.

02:18:49.825 --> 02:18:50.045
Okay.

02:18:50.085 --> 02:18:52.447
So like, where does it end up in your body?

02:18:53.047 --> 02:18:54.808
Well, a bit everywhere, depending on the dose.

02:18:55.148 --> 02:18:58.069
But may I finish something on the location first?

02:18:58.229 --> 02:18:58.429
Please.

02:18:58.449 --> 02:19:00.850
Because this localization is critical.

02:19:03.547 --> 02:19:26.364
If a non-immune cell present an antigen to, so the spike protein, to immune cell, like lymphocyte, and they're not dendritic cell, you will open the door to autoimmune disease because my muscle are not equipped to give the message to white blood cell, attack this guy while protect me.

02:19:27.325 --> 02:19:29.646
Only the dendritic cell have this dual function.

02:19:29.726 --> 02:19:31.508
We call that in immunology a context.

02:19:32.028 --> 02:19:33.328
The context is important.

02:19:33.648 --> 02:19:39.930
A DC can trigger the immune system, attack this little guy, and don't attack the cell that looks like me.

02:19:40.390 --> 02:19:42.490
And this avoids autoimmunity.

02:19:42.690 --> 02:19:53.393
So if the wrong cell presents the antigen, you open the door to problem with muscle, chronic problem, inflammation, because the immune system will start to attack your muscle.

02:19:54.335 --> 02:20:04.700
And then if this protein production goes into your epithelial cell, for example, in the blood vessel, they can be attacked too, because they're not professional antigen-presenting cell.

02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:10.882
So if your mRNA goes in liver cell, they end up being attacked too, so you understand.

02:20:11.102 --> 02:20:19.106
So you're, in a sense, because the wrong cell is presenting the antigen, you're training your body to attack that wrong cell.

02:20:19.446 --> 02:20:21.606
At the same time you're talking energy.

02:20:21.786 --> 02:20:26.607
See, we're not being precise enough because again, what happens is more complicated than that.

02:20:27.247 --> 02:20:30.428
What is being presented and how is it being presented?

02:20:30.508 --> 02:20:34.769
You need to be more precise because it can be the overexpression of the protein.

02:20:35.549 --> 02:20:41.690
If there's an overexpression of the protein, then again, I want to be precise here.

02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:43.030
I want them to be precise.

02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:48.751
Then on the outside of the cell, on the out, wow, come on.

02:20:55.063 --> 02:20:55.563
Hello.

02:20:56.464 --> 02:20:57.405
I didn't leave it open.

02:21:01.949 --> 02:21:02.689
What in the hell?

02:21:03.610 --> 02:21:05.071
I definitely didn't leave it open.

02:21:10.035 --> 02:21:12.857
Well, I'm just going to switch pens because that's annoying.

02:21:17.121 --> 02:21:19.603
If you have overexpression of a protein,

02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:29.987
then on the outside of the cell, or in the membrane, or outside the membrane, you're going to have that protein show up.

02:21:31.689 --> 02:21:43.058
And so we've been talking about the idea that the more of this protein that gets produced, the more likely it is it will also bud off in the form of exosomes, and then the protein will be shed this way.

02:21:43.658 --> 02:21:48.282
So overexpression of a protein by transfection is often the way that it kills

02:21:48.965 --> 02:21:50.466
experimental animal cells.

02:21:51.187 --> 02:22:03.395
So when you transfect the brain of a mouse and you transfect it even with just a fluorescent protein, eventually the continued expression of that protein results at a toxic level of that protein.

02:22:03.435 --> 02:22:05.536
It overwhelms the interior of the cell.

02:22:06.057 --> 02:22:13.382
If you transfect a cell with the spike protein and you're successful at getting, making lots and lots of copies of it, there could be so much

02:22:14.022 --> 02:22:21.826
of that protein in the cell that its normal protein and RNA functioning things can't move around anymore.

02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:22.846
They can't do anything.

02:22:23.647 --> 02:22:26.268
They can't be regulated in the correct way.

02:22:26.328 --> 02:22:28.569
They're not being broken down in the correct way.

02:22:28.609 --> 02:22:31.671
The whole physiology of the cell could go wrong.

02:22:31.751 --> 02:22:40.215
And that has nothing to do with the fact that in addition to that, the making of that protein is going to result in the presentation of some part of it

02:22:44.159 --> 02:22:45.220
on MHC1.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:51.723
And so there are two ways that the immune system could recognize that this cell needs to be destroyed.

02:22:52.663 --> 02:22:58.766
One is it could recognize this as foreign and non-self.

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:09.131
And then a signal that goes through here will result in apoptosis.

02:23:12.737 --> 02:23:30.702
I don't mean it goes through MHC2, but a combination of trying to dock with MHC2 and a couple other helper receptors over here and a cytotoxic T cell or a natural killer cell will be able to say, hey, you're up to something you shouldn't be up to.

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:32.523
We better apoptose you.

02:23:33.413 --> 02:23:43.581
That would be very different than the immune system coming along and having either antibodies, which recognize this, or a cytotoxic T cell that recognizes this.

02:23:47.445 --> 02:23:54.530
Because again, a cytotoxic T cell can't recognize the protein on the outside.

02:23:54.570 --> 02:23:57.593
The cytotoxic T cell is also looking for a presentation.

02:23:59.554 --> 02:24:01.816
T cells are looking for a presentation.

02:24:01.856 --> 02:24:06.962
They're not looking for a protein that's just sticking out and they happen to bump into it.

02:24:09.465 --> 02:24:12.747
that's a very important distinction between what's going on here.

02:24:12.767 --> 02:24:18.011
And so a cytotoxic T cell could come along and find antibodies stuck to these.

02:24:18.772 --> 02:24:23.956
And then that would cause the cytotoxic T cell to cause this cell to get disrupted.

02:24:24.456 --> 02:24:32.462
An NK cell or a cytotoxic T cell could read that this cell is manufacturing the incorrect protein and then cause it to

02:24:33.142 --> 02:24:34.323
go into apoptosis.

02:24:34.383 --> 02:24:40.948
It could recognize that it's making a non-self protein that the cytotoxic T cell recognizes and cause apoptosis.

02:24:42.669 --> 02:24:50.775
The imprecision that we're listening to here is very frustrating because it's partially good in that he's trying to say that you need to be specific.

02:24:50.855 --> 02:24:56.439
And when we say presentation in immunology, we mean antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, APCs.

02:24:56.879 --> 02:24:59.101
We're not talking about the way that

02:25:00.779 --> 02:25:05.521
healthy tissues present to the immune system because they do.

02:25:07.361 --> 02:25:09.322
And that's key to understanding.

02:25:09.382 --> 02:25:13.564
It's not this process that leads to autoimmunity.

02:25:13.664 --> 02:25:26.028
It's this process or when this cell is destroyed, if an antigen presenting cell is activated by the macrophages that clean it up,

02:25:27.162 --> 02:25:33.728
then potentially some of the self-antigens from this cell might be led to be presented by this cell.

02:25:33.768 --> 02:25:40.493
And then you have a different route to antigen presentation of auto-epitopes.

02:25:43.216 --> 02:25:52.624
And so it's crazy that, I'm sorry, this is such a bad drawing, but there are very specific mechanisms by which the

02:25:56.405 --> 02:26:01.009
standard understanding of immunology could describe this, and they're not doing it.

02:26:01.269 --> 02:26:02.430
They're not doing it at all.

02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:13.540
And then even worse, these two guys, both of whom presumably stand in front of classrooms all the time, are not using one single slide.

02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:16.202
They don't think they need any illustrations.

02:26:16.242 --> 02:26:19.906
They didn't bother to have, why would they get any illustrations?

02:26:19.966 --> 02:26:21.047
That would be crazy.

02:26:21.387 --> 02:26:23.128
I mean, what do we need illustrations for?

02:26:23.849 --> 02:26:25.751
Jay understands all the biology.

02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:27.932
Martijn understands all the biology.

02:26:27.952 --> 02:26:29.594
What do we need illustrations for?

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:31.455
This is known by clinician.

02:26:32.196 --> 02:26:50.951
To remind my colleague, because we're doctors, diabetes one, the juvenile diabetes, the physiology of it, when it starts, it's iteration of viral infection in the beta cell of the pancreas that produce too much antigen of the virus that goes on the surface of the beta

02:26:51.491 --> 02:26:54.695
And then your antibodies attack the beta cells themselves.

02:26:54.755 --> 02:27:03.084
Which after years and years, after 5-10 years, you don't have enough beta cells and insulin production stops and you end up diabetic.

02:27:03.265 --> 02:27:05.587
So it's not like we don't know this process.

02:27:06.568 --> 02:27:11.133
When the beta cell of the pancreas express the antigen of virus, they get attacked.

02:27:11.233 --> 02:27:12.874
Okay, so just hold on a second.

02:27:13.395 --> 02:27:17.138
Wow, so people get diabetes because viruses infect your pancreas?

02:27:17.219 --> 02:27:18.059
I didn't know that.

02:27:18.079 --> 02:27:24.706
It's common, though, for normal vaccines that use a different technology to inject in the arm.

02:27:25.106 --> 02:27:25.486
Yes.

02:27:25.546 --> 02:27:29.567
And it doesn't automatically induce autoimmune for every condition.

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:34.948
Absolutely not because it isn't plasma because the cell doesn't produce and doesn't present it itself.

02:27:35.268 --> 02:27:45.611
When I inject something, let's say some of my injections go in plasma, some go in the cell, muscle cell, the cell will digest and destroy it because it doesn't belong there and never will present it.

02:27:45.911 --> 02:27:47.292
to stimulate the immune system.

02:27:47.612 --> 02:27:51.234
Until you put enough toxin next to it, that's called an adjuvant.

02:27:51.334 --> 02:27:55.977
Please explain that to Jay, because apparently he hasn't learned it from me yet.

02:27:56.757 --> 02:28:01.520
On the contrary, the cell will digest and what's in the plasma will be captured by APCs, etc.

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:10.165
So in other words, if I inject a traditional vaccine, the proteins, the stuff that goes into the cells, it's not relevant.

02:28:10.426 --> 02:28:12.607
But the stuff that goes into your blood cell,

02:28:13.843 --> 02:28:19.807
it ends up in the lymph nodes, the APCs, grab them, present them, say this is foreign.

02:28:19.887 --> 02:28:20.668
And you're immunized.

02:28:21.148 --> 02:28:21.328
Right.

02:28:22.329 --> 02:28:27.892
And so this is different because it's not doing that.

02:28:28.173 --> 02:28:32.816
It's causing your cells to actually produce the antigen.

02:28:32.916 --> 02:28:34.317
To produce and present it.

02:28:34.437 --> 02:28:34.597
Right.

02:28:34.777 --> 02:28:36.858
And now let's get to the question of bio-distribution.

02:28:37.259 --> 02:28:39.360
It's not just the muscle cells that are doing that.

02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:40.440
No, exactly.

02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:49.643
Because it has been shown by literature, numerous papers, that when we inject the liposome, targeting a cell type needs to have molecular recognition.

02:28:49.683 --> 02:28:55.305
So I've like, my liposome needs a little label to recognize, for example, only the muscle, only the DC, etc.

02:28:55.365 --> 02:28:57.566
And those technologies still are not ripe.

02:28:57.826 --> 02:28:58.706
We're studying that.

02:28:59.067 --> 02:28:59.967
We try to improve.

02:29:00.447 --> 02:29:11.241
a location of injection, but also type of other molecule that we stick inside the liposome to target cell A and not cell B. Those methods are still being unraveled and studied.

02:29:11.622 --> 02:29:18.591
So while we don't have that, we have black liposome, we inject in the muscle, but the overflow goes anywhere with the bloodstream.

02:29:19.031 --> 02:29:22.793
And it goes to the epithelial lining, like we said.

02:29:22.813 --> 02:29:30.717
So all the cells in the blood vessels, it can go liver because the blood flow in the end end up into the portal system into the liver.

02:29:31.058 --> 02:29:33.759
And then after the liver goes through the heart in the lung.

02:29:34.219 --> 02:29:36.701
So essentially, it's like... And then everywhere else.

02:29:36.721 --> 02:29:37.281
Yeah, everywhere.

02:29:37.321 --> 02:29:41.383
Because as soon as the heart pumps it out, if you still have production, you can be anywhere.

02:29:41.403 --> 02:29:43.384
I mean, this sounds very, very scary, of course.

02:29:43.665 --> 02:29:43.785
But

02:29:44.645 --> 02:29:52.771
I want to put this in context, like the correlation between the epidemiological studies, they're not finding vast amounts of autoimmune conditions.

02:29:53.572 --> 02:29:57.014
This can happen, but it doesn't happen every time, not even most times.

02:29:57.034 --> 02:30:01.237
No, no, because as I said, it depends on the pathology that is not controlled.

02:30:01.678 --> 02:30:04.179
If you have no production, you will not get the effect.

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:04.940
But if you have small

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.322
If you have the right amount, because as I said, I'm not anti-vax.

02:30:08.582 --> 02:30:12.044
None of us is anti- conceptually against vaccination.

02:30:12.144 --> 02:30:12.845
We know it worked.

02:30:13.185 --> 02:30:15.567
But the thing is, we have to control.

02:30:15.587 --> 02:30:17.228
I mean, there they say it.

02:30:18.088 --> 02:30:19.229
I mean, there they say it.

02:30:19.529 --> 02:30:22.571
They know it worked against vaccination.

02:30:22.671 --> 02:30:24.092
It just was imperfect.

02:30:27.202 --> 02:30:28.882
I don't even know what to say.

02:30:28.942 --> 02:30:31.783
I mean, it's just, this is just terrible.

02:30:31.943 --> 02:30:34.963
We haven't learned anything yet worth writing down.

02:30:35.043 --> 02:30:41.445
I stopped writing down when he said he doesn't see that having high activity athletes transfected is funny.

02:30:42.005 --> 02:30:44.205
Amount of protein depends on metabolism.

02:30:44.265 --> 02:30:49.026
So for the last hour, I haven't bothered to write anything down because it's not enlightening.

02:30:49.066 --> 02:30:51.446
We're not learning anything from these two guys.

02:30:51.566 --> 02:30:55.307
The medication we give, if you cannot control, if you have the right dose by chance,

02:30:55.467 --> 02:30:57.114
Still talking about dose.

02:30:57.194 --> 02:30:58.720
Like, I got it on normal speed.

02:30:58.761 --> 02:31:00.006
That's 40 minutes in.

02:31:01.027 --> 02:31:09.032
it's okay, only when you have overflow hyperproduction, then the spike itself, not the RNA, but the spike itself can enter the bloodstream.

02:31:09.052 --> 02:31:15.375
So you may see, which is I think what we do see, that there's some set of people that were really, really, really harmed.

02:31:15.555 --> 02:31:15.615
Yes.

02:31:15.635 --> 02:31:19.218
And they're still getting harmed, like still, even after long after they took it, are harmed.

02:31:19.738 --> 02:31:25.001
Even as the vast majority of the people that took it, your body's produced, you process it and it's gone.

02:31:25.021 --> 02:31:25.181
Yes.

02:31:25.921 --> 02:31:28.523
The vast majority of people did not get hurt.

02:31:29.557 --> 02:31:32.739
In fact, the vast majority of people derive some benefit.

02:31:39.643 --> 02:31:42.585
I'm tempted to stop right now because I'm sorry.

02:31:43.706 --> 02:31:50.330
We need a new consensus about the fact that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:31:50.410 --> 02:31:58.935
Almost everybody, I mean, everybody that got a hot dose produced something that probably injured them.

02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:10.028
And the production, the actual result of the transfection is that your cells were doing things they weren't supposed to do and your immune system had to deal with it.

02:32:10.528 --> 02:32:22.138
And whether it happens now or in 5 or 10 years, you will probably discover that something is not optimal in your life anymore because of you taking the transfections.

02:32:25.287 --> 02:32:26.528
That's the real truth.

02:32:26.988 --> 02:32:37.477
And the people that don't think that they were injured by the vaccine, think that they were injured by the multiple times that they've gotten COVID since they took the vaccine.

02:32:38.018 --> 02:32:39.919
That is very, very clear.

02:32:40.359 --> 02:32:43.582
And we will watch a couple of videos tomorrow that will show you that.

02:32:44.223 --> 02:32:50.448
There are lots of people in our world that believe that COVID was just as dangerous as the vaccine.

02:32:52.555 --> 02:32:57.117
in the sense of the vaccine was safer because that was just the spike protein.

02:32:58.697 --> 02:33:05.340
They have completely inverted their understanding and they have bamboozled them into believing that RNA can pandemic.

02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:12.823
And they have bamboozled them into believing just what Jay and Martin said, the vaccine schedule in the USA is great.

02:33:14.448 --> 02:33:17.150
And it's a criminal enterprise, ladies and gentlemen.

02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:23.536
You can't make a cuckoo clock make toast and you cannot make yourselves do something that they don't already do.

02:33:23.596 --> 02:33:27.679
That's why an RNA can't pandemic, but transfection is dangerous as hell.

02:33:29.081 --> 02:33:36.367
Ladies and gentlemen, please remember intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:33:37.088 --> 02:33:42.092
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:33:43.143 --> 02:33:45.465
weaponized piles of money are still controlling us.

02:33:45.485 --> 02:33:49.869
They're still leading us around by our nose on social media because you won't log off.

02:33:50.729 --> 02:33:52.691
You gotta log off, ladies and gentlemen.

02:33:52.711 --> 02:33:54.953
Oh, man.

02:33:58.359 --> 02:34:00.041
You got to log off, ladies and gentlemen.

02:34:00.081 --> 02:34:03.624
If you want to share the stream, please share stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:34:03.664 --> 02:34:09.069
If you have any problems with stream.gigaohm.bio, please report them to me at gigaohm.bio.

02:34:10.231 --> 02:34:11.912
Starting to sound like John Cullen here.

02:34:12.553 --> 02:34:18.438
And if you want to support the stream, please go to gigaohmbiological.com, where you can find lots of different links.

02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:26.701
I am in the process of making a page on my website that gives credit to all the people that have supported the stream.

02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:28.681
First name and last initial only.

02:34:29.342 --> 02:34:34.443
And we're going to get rid of that slide in the deck from now on because it doesn't really do anybody any good.

02:34:35.003 --> 02:34:37.284
Everybody's always complaining because it's not all the people.

02:34:37.344 --> 02:34:43.385
And so I can put all the people if I don't just list subscribers, but make a living list.

02:34:43.525 --> 02:34:45.686
I'm going to try and move around, take care of my

02:34:46.346 --> 02:34:51.830
get another pill in me, make some dinner, take the dog for a walk if she'll go for a walk with me.

02:34:51.890 --> 02:34:55.293
Thank you very much for having the patience to wait for me to come back.

02:34:56.394 --> 02:35:10.305
It is Monday, I'll be on all week and thank goodness my family comes back on Friday so my productivity will shoot after that because let's face it, I'm a lot better when my wife and my kids are back.

02:35:10.425 --> 02:35:13.207
So thanks very much guys, I'll see you again tomorrow.
