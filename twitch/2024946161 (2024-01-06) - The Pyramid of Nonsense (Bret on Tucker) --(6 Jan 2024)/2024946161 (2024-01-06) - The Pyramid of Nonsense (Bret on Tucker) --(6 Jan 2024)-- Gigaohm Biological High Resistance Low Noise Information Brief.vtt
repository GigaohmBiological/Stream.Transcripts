00:57.000 --> 01:05.240
It's JC on the bike, it's JC on the bike, yeah, well I'm wise enough to know when a

01:05.240 --> 01:09.600
chomp needs banning and I know just the one.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.560
Look at round, it's JC on the bike, who says Vader didn't study music in college?

01:28.000 --> 01:34.560
So what I argued, I believe I came up with this independently, but I believe

01:34.560 --> 01:40.840
Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar as his Jonathan Cooey.

01:40.840 --> 01:51.280
One of you guys want to give me a sound check, am I okay?

02:10.840 --> 02:40.600
You know, I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to, so that's the best I can do

02:40.600 --> 02:47.080
with that. I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic.

02:47.080 --> 03:12.040
See, if you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally and

03:12.040 --> 03:15.520
these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine okay, but actually they're

03:15.520 --> 03:20.840
kind of cheating when they're calling these vaccines and you know, anything with really

03:20.840 --> 03:24.960
rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada saying

03:24.960 --> 03:32.240
nine months is actually JJ Cooey's insistence and I think he's right on calling them

03:32.240 --> 03:37.680
transfections rather than vaccines.

03:37.680 --> 03:42.880
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important

03:42.880 --> 03:49.120
ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and you know,

03:49.120 --> 03:54.520
it's not, you know, measles plus, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because,

03:54.520 --> 03:56.480
you know, not that many people die from it.

03:56.480 --> 04:03.680
It's just a big hassle in the end, but no one, when we have this new pandemic that

04:03.680 --> 04:13.680
is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite

04:13.680 --> 04:19.280
in the face of these beliefs. It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be and this is

04:19.280 --> 04:25.360
to just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another. I mean, so,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.360
we're going to do it all.

04:44.640 --> 04:52.480
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

04:52.480 --> 04:57.920
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

05:23.440 --> 05:29.760
Or what I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain. So what do I do? I go to Des Moines.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.480
Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there

05:32.480 --> 05:38.000
for four years. I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines. I go to

05:38.000 --> 05:45.520
Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there. I go to North Carolina. I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing

05:45.520 --> 05:51.360
is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid

05:51.360 --> 05:55.520
condition. These individuals complain. Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.880
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do. It'll produce some cascade of neurological

06:00.880 --> 06:07.600
and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

06:08.240 --> 06:13.280
I take attribution for that. Yes, I'm a terrorist group. And I have done this by infecting with a

06:13.280 --> 06:18.720
highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z. These people are

06:18.800 --> 06:24.400
really sick with this. But then I say others who are also infected will show subdramal,

06:24.400 --> 06:31.520
predramal signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

06:32.480 --> 06:37.280
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've

06:37.280 --> 06:41.760
got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door.

06:42.320 --> 06:48.640
The CDC comes back and says nonsense. That's not real. I come back and say that's fake news.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.040
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism

06:53.040 --> 06:59.280
between the polis and the public health system. I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance

06:59.280 --> 07:04.640
upon the population and its government.

08:18.720 --> 08:31.600
Why would you understand that you were in the city of the A's?

08:31.600 --> 08:34.640
Yes, two days ago. One side state your seat.

08:48.720 --> 09:06.320
You don't understand Mr. Brown, the bomb is a holy weapon for peace.

09:18.720 --> 09:35.360
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Good evening. Good afternoon. Good morning.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.480
Good night. Wherever you are on this great planet, as they say, this is a stream brought to you

09:42.480 --> 09:48.560
by a patch climb physiologist. I used to work on a microscope with some microvenibilators

09:49.440 --> 09:55.680
cattered around it and yeah, stuff like that. Not very important things and they were grand

09:55.680 --> 10:00.880
scheme of things unless you really just want to understand stuff about the biology of the brain.

10:00.880 --> 10:05.840
I was involved in a lot of that and that's where GigaOM comes from. A high resistance low noise

10:05.840 --> 10:10.640
recording is what I used to make and I'm hoping I'm making that today again. With the GigaOM

10:10.640 --> 10:15.200
biological high resistance information brief, whatever that is.

10:17.440 --> 10:23.840
I'm actually found at the website GigaOMbiological.com and also GigaOM.bio.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.960
Two different ways to maneuver around and then from there you can find everything else that you

10:28.960 --> 10:34.800
might want including how to support my work, how to download the slides that I use, how to find

10:34.800 --> 10:44.640
the schedule, how to leave a voicemail full of curse words and insults and yeah maybe even also

10:44.640 --> 10:51.520
subscribe and start to contribute to the long-term durability of this work. Like these people have

10:55.520 --> 10:58.640
these are the supporters of GigaOMbiological. I got to tell you

10:59.360 --> 11:05.280
that I'm going to have to do a shout out to Greg James for the rest of my life probably maybe my

11:05.280 --> 11:12.320
kids will too but these people are all seminal in keeping this stream running making me believe

11:13.120 --> 11:20.080
that this work is important and so thanks to all of them and anybody who's not on that list you

11:20.080 --> 11:26.480
will be. I can't update it every day but I try to do it as often as possible as GigaOMbiological.

11:26.480 --> 11:42.400
I'm just going to get a few things set up in the background and then we're ready to go.

11:56.480 --> 12:24.160
So here we are lost on this road. The road we got on almost we're going on you know four years

12:24.240 --> 12:28.960
ago so we're going into year five now and I think it's very important to realize they're trying to

12:28.960 --> 12:36.320
compress 2020 into a year that didn't happen in 2021 into a year that largely didn't happen

12:36.320 --> 12:42.080
so we don't realize how long it took some of these people to speak up how long it took some of these

12:42.080 --> 12:48.560
ideas to come to the fore. Ideas like there was no spread in New York City that infectious clones

12:48.560 --> 12:55.520
are the only real threat of any form in mRNA anyway placebo batches were likely distributed to

12:55.520 --> 13:01.120
you know just kind of screw another monkey wrench in the works. Transfection and healthy mammals

13:01.120 --> 13:08.400
is dumb and we've known that for for for all the the time before the pandemic protocols were you

13:08.400 --> 13:13.360
know they were murdered they they did things they knew would increase all cause mortality

13:13.360 --> 13:17.440
and gain a function is definitely a mythology if the only guy who knows anything about it is

13:17.440 --> 13:24.000
Peter Dasek and the Scooby-Doo is definitely real if the bad guy were unmasking his Tony Fauci

13:24.000 --> 13:31.120
and and and Ralph Barrick a spectacular commitment to lies is what allows those people to be the

13:31.120 --> 13:38.240
bad guys to be the scapegoats and we've all been taken that's the point I'm trying to tell anybody

13:38.240 --> 13:44.400
that who's taking who I just want everybody to know that the globe the globe has been taken

13:45.120 --> 13:59.760
and so if we have any hope of breaking free we've got to figure out who took us oh boy oh boy oh boy

13:59.760 --> 14:05.280
oh boy giga oh biological haven't been out in a couple days I apologize a couple hiccups in the

14:05.360 --> 14:17.760
works here um and I still need to fix my rig um I had said on on the soapbox that um I needed

14:17.760 --> 14:22.480
to change my rig around I actually haven't done it yet um I'm gonna do it over the weekend maybe

14:22.480 --> 14:26.560
tomorrow we had an interesting game today and it was right smack dab in the middle of the day and

14:26.560 --> 14:32.400
then I want to do this so that I can be free for the evening um hello this is gig oh and biological

14:32.400 --> 14:36.720
a high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologist it's January 6th

14:36.720 --> 14:42.480
2024 that biologist that brings you this show his name to Jonathan J Cooley and he comes to you

14:42.480 --> 14:47.280
from the back of his garage in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania it's cold outside it's cold in here

14:47.280 --> 14:54.320
hit 636 p.m. um and I just want to get right into it oh yeah that's right we don't need that

14:54.320 --> 15:01.360
because we're gonna go out and I'm gonna get a different slide deck out uh I have been changing

15:01.360 --> 15:07.440
slide decks lately at the beginning because um it just keeps these things down to a minimum

15:08.080 --> 15:12.240
in terms of memory space and it makes everything run a little smoother at least whoops

15:13.600 --> 15:18.880
at least from the perspective of my end and I hope it also makes the video smoother for you guys so

15:18.880 --> 15:25.440
here we go we'll do this one now um so this is gig oh and biological the safest way to get biology

15:25.520 --> 15:33.040
in your head shout out to Jeff and Cara in Canada um another of my longtime supporters we like to

15:33.040 --> 15:38.720
tell everybody that's joining us for the first time that the pandemic was created by a by making us

15:38.720 --> 15:45.680
participate in a Scooby-Doo mystery Scooby-Doo is a story about teenagers that solve mysteries

15:45.680 --> 15:51.760
with their great big dog and usually they solve the mystery by trapping a monster and then taking

15:51.760 --> 15:55.840
his mask off to find that he's one of the characters they met earlier in the story

15:56.400 --> 16:01.600
and so the argument of course is that this faith in a novel virus is something that was also

16:01.600 --> 16:07.920
ceded very early on because if you buy into their Scooby-Doo mystery then you also buy

16:07.920 --> 16:14.400
into the existence of the monsters in that story and in this case the evil doers have been given

16:14.400 --> 16:20.400
to us by the tv and by social media as people who have been covering up a lab leak and in this

16:20.400 --> 16:25.040
scenario we've been led to believe indeed that this is confirmation again that we've used a

16:25.040 --> 16:31.360
vaccine to successfully defeat epidemics and disease in the past its evidence that novel

16:31.360 --> 16:37.440
coronavirus can jump its evidence that PCR isn't that bad and that asymptomatic spread is real

16:37.440 --> 16:42.400
its evidence that variants spread around and that you can see the evolution from a single

16:42.400 --> 16:48.320
SARS virus to all these different dominant variants and it says that we spent money on

16:48.320 --> 16:52.240
gain of function research in the past and we're doing it now and we're going to do it again

16:52.240 --> 16:58.240
our children are on this train and we don't want them to be on this train and the reason why I got

16:58.240 --> 17:07.120
to using this train as a metaphor is because of this train as a metaphor how do I do this I do

17:07.120 --> 17:16.560
that first right yeah and in this train metaphor this sorry in this train metaphor this I believe

17:16.720 --> 17:24.000
is Italian this clever Italian guy is pretending to stop this train with sheer force and will

17:24.000 --> 17:29.920
and then also assist the train in starting again and he even chalks his hands up between

17:29.920 --> 17:37.520
and my argument is that in this pandemic exercise there were people who were co-opted

17:37.520 --> 17:44.560
early on and people that were present early on to make sure that certain key events happened

17:44.560 --> 17:52.560
so that current that certain let's say landmarks could be reached in the narrative of the pandemic

17:52.560 --> 17:59.920
so that this collectively could happen now the question becomes of course is this

18:01.680 --> 18:11.520
exercise a result of the exquisite preparedness of nation states around the world after years and

18:11.520 --> 18:19.680
years of drilling these exercises that when the red alert was declared and the who said that

18:19.680 --> 18:27.120
there was a pandemic of a coronavirus and that the enactment of these plans resulted in a great

18:27.680 --> 18:33.760
overreaction and a great stumbling forward and a great waste of money and a great many mistakes

18:33.760 --> 18:39.280
being made but in the end this is what we had to do because if it was the worst case scenario

18:39.840 --> 18:45.520
things would have this whatever we did would have helped a lot more that's the argument that I

18:45.520 --> 18:51.520
think even the participants in the story still believe but my argument here and the use of this

18:51.520 --> 18:59.920
narrative is the idea that these scripted arguments were carefully chosen and actors and

19:00.000 --> 19:10.400
co-opted participants were were in place early on so that these issues these limited spectrums

19:10.400 --> 19:21.280
of debate would be the lively pushback that the populace could see on the tv and see on social

19:21.280 --> 19:28.240
media and rest assured that that something was happening and it made sense and these people were

19:28.240 --> 19:33.520
doing what they could and so the more people that you have lined up against that train

19:34.560 --> 19:38.880
pretending that they need to stop it the more likely it is that the people who are observing

19:38.880 --> 19:45.760
it are going to believe that that illusion is occurring and so if the goal of these these

19:45.760 --> 19:51.440
supernational organizations and supernational forces that are running this show using the

19:51.440 --> 19:57.520
five eyes countries and the United States and Canada and and European countries as puppets or

19:57.520 --> 20:07.280
or Canada's puppets or or China's puppets who knows who's doing it but whoever is doing it has assured

20:07.280 --> 20:18.560
that there are people in place to make sure that the the central mythology that they want to be in

20:18.640 --> 20:27.680
place by the end of this exercise is not questioned by any of the spectrum of limited

20:27.680 --> 20:35.200
debate and the lively debate within that spectrum so that the presuppositions of the state or the

20:35.200 --> 20:45.280
supernational weaponized piles of money are reinforced by the narrative and that the narrative itself

20:45.280 --> 20:52.000
the mythology is left over even after the limited spectrum of debate happens and it's very vigorous

20:52.000 --> 20:59.520
and people get angry and righteously so and at the end they're both arguing and when the argument

20:59.520 --> 21:09.200
is over they agree again that that's what happened and one of the most beautiful additions to this

21:09.200 --> 21:12.960
and I apologize for the blower in the background but again I am in the back of my garage I do need

21:12.960 --> 21:19.040
a heater the beauty of this these hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin discussions

21:19.760 --> 21:26.320
was the presupposition built into that which is that there is something novel circulating that

21:26.320 --> 21:34.080
would require the application of a otherwise something that you do not use it and in this case

21:34.080 --> 21:44.480
very cleverly I think too largely underutilized should be standard in your medicine cabinet type

21:45.520 --> 21:53.360
pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals or whatever these things are they they they chose these because

21:53.360 --> 21:58.720
there would be a lot of possibility for confusion here with very little danger

21:59.680 --> 22:07.440
of there being any you know it just is going to add more confusion and all the while the debate

22:07.440 --> 22:15.200
about this doesn't question again the novel virus etc and so the two main proponents of ivermectin

22:15.200 --> 22:20.880
rpr and brat and the main proponent of hydroxychloroquine now and someone was writing a book about it

22:20.880 --> 22:27.760
is named steven um and all of these people don't seem to be able to figure out that the mystery

22:27.840 --> 22:35.760
virus requires excess deaths and you have to do math to calculate excess deaths you can't just

22:35.760 --> 22:40.800
look at this picture and take somebody's word for it that this represents a mystery virus

22:40.800 --> 22:49.200
especially again when you look at all cause mortality and how uh what this is is of course the

22:49.200 --> 22:53.360
detected flu deaths and then this is pneumonia which we've had a pretty good handle on for the

22:53.440 --> 22:59.840
last couple decades and then suddenly it triples and quadruples in in numbers so what is this really

22:59.840 --> 23:04.320
and again the point is is that with all the fear and certainty doubt and confusion with

23:04.320 --> 23:10.080
regards to the worst case scenario and with regard to the application of do not resuscitate orders

23:10.080 --> 23:16.320
to to prevent spread to you know to use ventilators to prevent spread the lack of antibiotic use

23:16.320 --> 23:21.760
because it's not appropriate for viruses the you know poor use of steroids remdesivir and

23:21.760 --> 23:27.760
medazolam being applied to these people opioid deaths being allowed to run skyrocket up

23:27.760 --> 23:32.400
and deaths certificate fraud having all around the united states and financial incentives were

23:32.400 --> 23:37.760
there to do so and even the use of track and trace and the spending of millions if not billions of

23:37.760 --> 23:45.440
dollars on that as well as masks and closures and iPads and mandates that people fought about

23:45.440 --> 23:50.240
that didn't argue about well wait what why are there excess deaths in the first place is it

23:50.240 --> 23:54.720
really a virus or are we just killing these people by putting tubes that don't need or giving

23:54.720 --> 24:03.040
them drugs that don't work and so of course on top of all of this there was PCR fraud lateral

24:03.040 --> 24:09.760
flow test fraud and probably sequencing fraud that's why they didn't want all the thousands of

24:09.760 --> 24:14.160
academic labs at all the universities around the united states to do any sequencing even

24:14.160 --> 24:19.840
though they knew how they could do it no testing we can't do any testing on lab benches that would

24:19.920 --> 24:24.400
be crazy it's a highly contagious virus we got to send it all to one place

24:27.440 --> 24:31.760
and so no one still to this day is really just hitting the home run you don't have to

24:31.760 --> 24:37.680
head you don't have to say a bunch of stuff there's no evidence of spread in new york city

24:38.320 --> 24:42.640
we can't even find the 20 000 bodies that are supposed to have come in four weeks

24:43.200 --> 24:53.360
not only that but we've conveniently avoided all kinds of Medicare costs in the coming year by

24:53.360 --> 24:58.240
reducing the lifespan of all these people by killing all these old people just because we treated

24:58.240 --> 25:03.840
them differently than we normally would and all the while nobody uses the word strict liability

25:03.840 --> 25:10.960
in terms of applying legal principles to a vaccine and no one talks about strict liability with

25:10.960 --> 25:16.560
regard to applying it to a transfection they want you to believe that all transfections

25:16.560 --> 25:23.280
are safe proven safe by the billions of doses they've given out and no one ever talks about

25:23.280 --> 25:28.080
any of this being a seventh amendment violation in the sense of you can't challenge this in a

25:28.080 --> 25:34.400
regular court you've got to go through some kind of special kangaroo court administrative court

25:34.560 --> 25:44.960
no one talks about getting rid of the prep act no one talks about getting rid of the 1986

25:44.960 --> 25:51.920
vaccine act no one runs on that and no one questions the existence of a novel virus that killed

25:51.920 --> 25:56.160
millions of people what millions more were saved from no one questions the likelihood that it came

25:56.160 --> 26:00.880
from a gain a function lab and no one questions the likelihood that it will come again we're

26:00.880 --> 26:06.320
making pandemic treaties with the who which presuppose that the virus or any more viruses

26:06.320 --> 26:13.600
will come forever and so you got to see gnome said it out loud because that's what they got to do

26:13.600 --> 26:17.360
they got to tell you the truth otherwise it's not fair they don't feel like they're doing it

26:17.360 --> 26:25.360
honorably as they enslave your children they won't feel like they're doing it honorably if they if

26:25.360 --> 26:30.800
if you if they don't tell you the truth and so they've been telling us the truth we just haven't been

26:30.800 --> 26:34.560
reading the books ladies and gentlemen we haven't been taking notes we haven't been listening we've

26:34.560 --> 26:40.880
been too busy building remote control helicopters and and filling our houses with useless things

26:43.040 --> 26:47.760
and i'm totally guilty of this i'm not saying i'm not guilty of this this is me talking about

26:47.760 --> 27:00.240
myself and so how the pandemic was created it was a long time guys it was a long time it was

27:00.320 --> 27:07.520
scientific programs designed to lay the foundation of pandemic potential it was cutting edge level

27:07.520 --> 27:13.840
high level exercises um with secret meetings and secret groups of people with badges and stuff

27:13.840 --> 27:19.120
like that talking about what to do during a pandemic crisis or how it might happen or how

27:19.120 --> 27:26.320
a bioterrorist might do it and seating mass casualty events at the start of the pandemic they could

27:26.320 --> 27:31.520
have been used by pbs news hour and by sage in the uk to use as a projection to say that we're

27:31.520 --> 27:36.880
going to worst case scenario and then you have a bunch of people in place depending on how well

27:36.880 --> 27:43.120
the the show goes you might need people on network news and on facebook and on on instagram and

27:43.120 --> 27:48.880
and and media influencers maybe you want to talk to a few people in hollywood and make sure the

27:48.880 --> 27:54.960
team worst case scenario is there not to question the virus but instead to make sure that people

27:55.680 --> 28:04.000
associate certain side effects certain additional effects respiratory disease that they expect to

28:04.000 --> 28:10.560
have from the transfection and so any cardiac effects are bonus any any any talk about cardiac

28:10.560 --> 28:18.640
effects any talk about uh systemic things any talk that that belies a sort of you know

28:19.440 --> 28:26.080
bouquet of of additional injuries his perfect for seating the narrative that eventually came out

28:26.080 --> 28:32.800
about a year later where the spike protein was the the center thing to focus on and i got sucked

28:32.800 --> 28:39.200
into that like you can't believe the idea that they only they only modified the spike protein and

28:39.200 --> 28:45.520
then made a a synthetic virus was all implanted in the literature it all seemed perfect

28:45.680 --> 28:52.800
but then at some point it became very obvious that that left them a huge out as they transfected

28:52.800 --> 28:58.560
people because then they could blame all of the side effects of the transfection on this

28:59.120 --> 29:05.520
who maybe it's again a function protein maybe we should see that at the beginning of the narrative

29:05.520 --> 29:10.320
and make sure that there are crazy people on all social media platforms talking about that

29:10.480 --> 29:17.280
possibility maybe we should release a paper and then and then retract it

29:19.040 --> 29:26.080
maybe we should release a pre-print and then retract it hinting at a a spike protein that was

29:26.080 --> 29:34.000
tinkered like a watchmaker and then if you co-opt some people at the beginning of the narrative

29:34.000 --> 29:39.280
to make sure that the people who were there to experience the truth told the real truth on

29:39.280 --> 29:45.920
television the real truth that the operators the the weaponized piles of money that are running

29:45.920 --> 29:53.520
this show that that they wanted were under the assumption that this is a national security priority

29:53.520 --> 30:00.880
operation that limited their their ability to speak out in public left them with little option

30:00.880 --> 30:04.240
other than participation or opting out and shutting up

30:06.800 --> 30:17.280
and so the the narrative was primarily designed to confound a the toxicity of a virus maybe one that

30:17.280 --> 30:24.640
was not even circulating for the most part to confound those effects with transfection

30:25.120 --> 30:33.440
and that would allow them to then say that rolling out so many doses and just blindly ignoring

30:33.440 --> 30:38.080
VAERS allows them to set up this idea that transfection proved successful

30:41.120 --> 30:45.760
and so that's just the tip of the iceberg right because that sets up our young people

30:45.760 --> 30:51.200
to be on that train to nowhere it sets up our young people to believe that this could happen

30:51.280 --> 30:57.280
again and so this becomes an iterative thing and how many more iterations or how many more

30:57.280 --> 31:03.680
narratives will it take before our children are permanently enslaved behind digital ID digital

31:03.680 --> 31:10.320
currency and you know some form of globally controlled medical records that include vaccinations in

31:10.320 --> 31:19.200
order to move and then it's pretty much you know you're an experimental animal and if you cause

31:19.200 --> 31:24.160
trouble well they can find lots of regulations you're in violation of they can turn off your

31:24.160 --> 31:32.720
digital ID they can cancel your currency etc so that's that there is no question that that

31:32.720 --> 31:36.240
a mass awakening is required and it needs to happen at light speed

31:39.760 --> 31:47.440
because as was said by someone much smarter than me in a book the past faded into miss the past

31:47.520 --> 31:52.640
was erased the erasure was forgotten and the lie became truth we're moving through that right now

31:52.640 --> 32:00.400
as the years 2020 and the year 21 they get compressed into one year or you know well we don't really

32:00.400 --> 32:08.720
need to talk about that because we were all confused back then I mean we just we were all lost in the

32:08.720 --> 32:17.120
in the sea of misinformation and confusing reports in 2020 in 2021 nobody really came to their senses

32:17.120 --> 32:23.120
until almost 2022 that's what they would like you to believe because that's how the erasure gets

32:23.120 --> 32:34.160
forgotten the past is already erased nobody from 2020 that spoke up is still speaking up now

32:34.160 --> 32:42.480
and prominent in doing so where's canoe with koski where's wolf gang woda where's michael

32:42.800 --> 32:52.880
they're all gone instead of being the the voice of reason they are vanished they continue to be

32:52.880 --> 33:02.720
censored they continue to be sidelined for these other people who are being ever elevated higher

33:02.720 --> 33:11.120
in the media chain and said to be the people that spoke up when they needed to speak up

33:12.800 --> 33:19.280
the only person that I know that was speaking in front of a million people in 2020 about the

33:19.280 --> 33:29.440
lockdowns being absolute bs his robert f Kennedy jr as I recall he was in germany um speaking in

33:29.440 --> 33:36.400
some square or whatever with a quite a few people saying that we had to be beware well what they

33:36.400 --> 33:42.320
were doing I don't think it was Brett Weinstein I don't think it was roberm alone I don't think

33:42.800 --> 33:48.720
these people were there they weren't standing on stage shoulder to shoulder with bobby kennedy

33:48.720 --> 33:57.280
that's for sure with some guy translating it into german but they want you to forget about 2020

33:57.280 --> 34:02.720
that there was nine and a half months or ten months there to say something they want you to

34:02.720 --> 34:11.840
forget about 2021 where there were you know 12 more months to say something biology is the way out

34:11.840 --> 34:18.160
in this scenario we need to pause all childhood vaccinations in the USA and any single individual

34:18.160 --> 34:26.160
who is having a usefully large platform and is not at least questioning the entire vaccine

34:26.160 --> 34:33.600
schedule rather than just the covet 19 vaccines is not is not playing for the touchdown that we

34:33.600 --> 34:40.320
need the touchdown is the only way we're going to win this game and the touchdown is to get enough

34:40.320 --> 34:46.320
awareness so that it becomes okay to think that the childhood vaccination schedule in the United

34:46.320 --> 34:52.080
States is skewed in some way that no other vaccine schedule in the world is and therefore is evidence

34:52.080 --> 34:59.280
that it needs stopping advocate for strict liability on these products it's a very simple thing it

34:59.280 --> 35:04.400
applies to a lot of other stuff in our society there's no complications about it lawyers understand it

35:05.120 --> 35:09.920
strict liability on these products done especially transfections

35:12.160 --> 35:16.080
investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events because we don't

35:16.080 --> 35:19.920
know what happened in these places and we need to know because there aren't even any bodies

35:20.800 --> 35:26.320
investigates the use of these mass casualty events and possibly transfection to create the

35:26.320 --> 35:30.880
illusion of a pandemic so i'm saying that there is a possibility i don't know if it happened or

35:30.960 --> 35:37.280
not but there's a possibility that things like RNA or DNA or a combination of both could have been

35:37.280 --> 35:46.320
used to seed the PCR positivity to seed a a respiratory pathogen to seed not pathogen but

35:46.320 --> 35:52.640
a respiratory symptomology a transfection in your lungs might do that

35:53.600 --> 35:58.160
transfection in the water might i don't know a toxin in the air might do that

35:59.840 --> 36:05.840
but they seeded these cat mass casualty events to blame it on a circulating pathogen to create

36:05.840 --> 36:11.680
the illusion of a pandemic they used sage and modeling to to show you that this was going

36:11.680 --> 36:16.240
to be a worst case scenario they didn't actually show you a truck full of bodies they showed you

36:16.240 --> 36:24.240
a truck and put a body in it they showed you a continuously used mass grave for anonymous dead

36:24.240 --> 36:28.720
people in new york city and pretended that it was a new thing just for the pandemic

36:30.240 --> 36:35.360
so we need to reclaim sovereignty over our bodies and we need to end the cdc withdrawal from the

36:35.360 --> 36:41.840
who and you had entirely i think that's really a very succinct way to explain and not only do we

36:42.720 --> 36:46.960
discuss how the pandemic was created but i do think we need to discuss why the pandemic was

36:46.960 --> 36:51.920
created it was created to avoid an exponential increase in medicare costs that people have been

36:51.920 --> 36:58.000
talking about and projecting for ages this will continue as they continue to advocate for keep

36:58.000 --> 37:07.040
vaccinating all these old people with pneumonia and and flu and rsv and and covid this will just

37:07.120 --> 37:12.720
result in lower lifespan for these adults they're gonna they're gonna have more arrests they're

37:12.720 --> 37:18.320
gonna have more strokes they're gonna have more many many clotting problems or whatever it's all

37:18.320 --> 37:23.520
gonna be worse none of these new vaccines that are gonna be applied to these old people are

37:23.520 --> 37:31.840
gonna do anything but reduce their lifespan because there will be many many more ways to treat those

37:31.920 --> 37:37.440
old people better or or take care of them better or encourage them to behave better take care of

37:37.440 --> 37:43.440
themselves that would be better than transfecting them with a novel transfection agent just because

37:43.440 --> 37:48.960
the fda put its sample of approval on it it is also to protect against the growing skepticism

37:48.960 --> 37:54.640
in vaccines that had been going skyrocketing since the before the beginning of the pandemic

37:55.440 --> 38:00.720
there was a peak in 2008 and 2009 or whatever but then there was also a peak very close to the

38:00.720 --> 38:05.680
beginning of the pandemic with regard to progress i believe on on challenging the

38:05.680 --> 38:13.040
measles vaccination requirements in some states and so that came to a screeching halt as a result

38:13.040 --> 38:17.920
of the pandemic the transition to a digital currency in a controlled manner absolutely

38:17.920 --> 38:24.080
especially in the united states you can't ignore the math of the dollar to transition to genetic

38:24.080 --> 38:29.680
vaccines for the entire population i think is an inevitable certainty with regard to how they've

38:29.680 --> 38:34.720
shifted all the baton backpack warm base of manufacturing to that as well to confound the

38:34.720 --> 38:39.600
toxicity of the virus and transfection to allow number four we've already said that to transition

38:39.600 --> 38:43.680
the youth into submission and full digital control they're about to start complaining

38:44.240 --> 38:50.560
that anonymous accounts and anonymous harassment and anonymous stealing of id and account theft

38:50.560 --> 38:56.720
and this kind of thing is such a problem and such a danger that in order to protect our youth

38:56.720 --> 39:02.640
we're going to have to require all adults to use an id at certain websites or to do certain

39:02.640 --> 39:06.960
things and that's all well and good at first but of course that's a very slippery slope and

39:06.960 --> 39:10.720
eventually no way are you going to be able to use the internet without using a digital id

39:10.720 --> 39:15.920
that's unique to you so that they can track all of your activity even to the point of maybe having

39:15.920 --> 39:21.920
an app on your computer that you can't remove that will track your eyes as you watch and then to help

39:21.920 --> 39:26.640
create the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed i think

39:26.640 --> 39:31.040
that's what the wef is a front for i don't know what's happening in the background but i think

39:31.040 --> 39:34.640
you're supposed to get mad at the wef so that you don't pay attention to whatever's really

39:34.640 --> 39:40.160
happening i would presume at bank meetings and stuff like that but what do i know i just i think

39:40.720 --> 39:45.840
weaponized piles of money are the best things to look for with regard to the forces as time goes

39:45.840 --> 39:51.840
forward hopefully doctors and scientists will get a better better handle on the whole situation

39:52.400 --> 39:59.680
fortunately from what i understand 2020 it is contagious but the death rate is is pretty low

40:02.240 --> 40:08.400
so yeah i understand the fear yeah well we can see you still have a cough what do the doctors say

40:08.400 --> 40:11.280
about your own condition moving forward as we wrap this up

40:20.640 --> 40:28.720
they said um yeah i'm fine i got tested twice negative both times the cough probably just uh

40:28.720 --> 40:37.520
nerves being on tv fair enough so that was a family that returned to i believe returned to

40:37.600 --> 40:45.280
pittsburgh um from somewhere and were positive so they had to quarantine at a hotel or at their

40:45.280 --> 40:50.000
house and then afterward they got interviewed i'm not really sure maybe they quarantined

40:50.000 --> 40:53.680
somewhere else i don't really know what the whole story is but the point is those were the

40:53.680 --> 40:58.160
stories that they were doing all around the united states again to see the worst case scenario

40:58.160 --> 41:03.520
idea in people's head that something was spreading and so it was just a question of how far it would

41:03.520 --> 41:10.960
spread and whose projections were right early but i want is high morbidity and what i'd like

41:10.960 --> 41:14.800
you to think about when you listen to this guy's video i played it again in the beginning

41:15.760 --> 41:19.840
um is this list and then we'll read it after he's done

41:22.320 --> 41:28.800
i go to seattle i infect a couple of cases there i go to north carolina i go to

41:28.800 --> 41:34.400
wisconsin what i'm doing is i'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases

41:34.400 --> 41:39.760
with a highly morbid condition these individuals complain again this is a central nervous system

41:39.760 --> 41:44.880
condition so they're complaining of whatever the bug may do it'll produce some cascade of

41:44.880 --> 41:50.960
neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms and then what i do the real bug that i use

41:51.680 --> 41:57.120
is the internet i take attribution for that yes i'm a terrorist group and i have done this

41:57.200 --> 42:02.720
i hope you understand that girdano's job is to lay down the worst case scenario narrative to

42:02.720 --> 42:12.720
have made sure that all the military that he speaks to all the military people that he speaks to

42:12.720 --> 42:22.960
all the what the hell all the military people that he speaks to all of the the companies that he

42:22.960 --> 42:28.880
speaks to the ceos believe the idea that some of these worst case scenarios can happen that

42:28.880 --> 42:34.240
these biotechnologies exist that these abilities to you know wipe out the religious feeling in

42:34.240 --> 42:39.280
people's heads by dropping some kind of crisper thing down from airplanes is something that he

42:40.000 --> 42:45.120
goes around spreading with the idea of throwing some truth out there of course and letting people

42:45.120 --> 42:49.680
know where things are but also throwing some confusing information out there that when circulated as

42:49.760 --> 42:56.000
a video it starts to sound like well maybe this maybe that um he's just putting a bunch of

42:56.000 --> 43:04.400
things out there throwing things out there as possible futures but to do that in 2017 is very

43:04.400 --> 43:12.640
very impressive so it was a military response with the ability to drive local mass casualty events

43:12.640 --> 43:18.000
i'm just suggesting that one possible scenario that we should consider is the idea that what the

43:18.000 --> 43:23.600
military really did and the only role they had was the initial response to make sure that if the

43:23.600 --> 43:30.000
virus really showed up and spread everywhere that the military was already in place to know where

43:30.000 --> 43:38.080
it was spreading and to be able to get ahead of any real agent now whether or not there was a real

43:38.080 --> 43:41.920
agent is different right because the military would have to be in place no matter what the worst

43:41.920 --> 43:47.840
case scenario exercise worst case scenario drill would be that there would be these teams

43:47.840 --> 43:52.560
that would be i guess everywhere in the united states or something right certainly

43:53.600 --> 43:57.840
several teams that would be able to go to places where the outbreak or outbreaks whether we're

43:57.840 --> 44:04.080
occurring and so then if this was really going to go forward that was really going to go forward

44:04.080 --> 44:13.040
no matter what like we've heard uh rick bright and tony fauci and uh mark ronronce from belgium

44:13.760 --> 44:20.320
and um uh osterhouse from the the netherlands all these people talk about how

44:21.040 --> 44:26.160
controlling the message is so important because you want to everybody to act the way you want

44:26.160 --> 44:30.400
them to act you want everybody to take the vaccine if that's what it is you want them to do what they're

44:30.400 --> 44:36.480
told and so the only way to do what they're to get them to do what they're told is to make the case

44:37.280 --> 44:44.000
that something serious is happening and so then usually there's a little bluff involved in there

44:44.000 --> 44:50.720
there's a little exaggeration there there's a little um you know 50 people died today and then

44:50.720 --> 44:56.560
you say it in a way that makes it seem like that's a big deal but in a in a country of 350 million

44:56.560 --> 45:02.880
people that's nothing financial and legal incentive to call covid that's important to understand

45:02.960 --> 45:10.960
because there were in at least new york and some other jurisdictions a legal indemnity given to

45:10.960 --> 45:15.680
covid cases and treating covid cases because you know it's a new thing we don't know what's going on so

45:15.680 --> 45:20.080
do what you can but if you do something that kills the patient it's not that big a deal and that's

45:20.080 --> 45:25.440
also what protected the initial rollout of some of these bad protocols that's why nobody's suing

45:25.440 --> 45:36.000
coordinated propaganda campaign to drill confusing worst case scenario so that's again you know

45:36.000 --> 45:41.920
behind the scenes and news organizations we know that that's possible because of how uniform the

45:41.920 --> 45:47.440
messages across some of these bigger companies that control the local news across the entire

45:47.440 --> 45:53.600
united states covid hospital protocols capable of increasing all cause mortality it doesn't have to

45:53.600 --> 45:59.920
do it in one way it just has to be that you know if we tweak this knob here and we tweak this

45:59.920 --> 46:06.480
knob here and we turn this knob here and we close this valve 15 more people are going to code every

46:06.480 --> 46:15.280
day well that's perfect do that at every hospital there's something spreading emergency social policies

46:15.280 --> 46:20.320
capable of increasing all cause mortality like don't try to resuscitate people or don't give mouth

46:20.320 --> 46:25.600
to mouth when you when you do a house call as an EMT because you might get covid from that person

46:27.280 --> 46:35.920
so that might have an uptick in cases of death then convince a public a lab leak cover up is

46:35.920 --> 46:41.120
happening right before their eyes well that was done for sure with everything from emails to

46:41.120 --> 46:48.880
nature papers to slack messages to verbal arguments in the senate of the united states government

46:50.960 --> 46:55.920
and use island ally nations to demonstrate that lockdowns can work

46:57.680 --> 47:05.200
and have their their leaders be very very very vocally angry and mean about the fact that they

47:05.200 --> 47:11.200
are heroes for having had the guts to lock them down as hard as they did and that they owe them

47:11.200 --> 47:18.720
their lives both the the government the governments of Canada the government of Australia and the

47:18.800 --> 47:26.960
government of New Zealand curiously took that stance that their lockdown was harsh but successful

47:28.400 --> 47:33.040
and so when you look backwards and this is the beauty of it when you look backwards

47:33.040 --> 47:38.240
you can start to see that this had to have been the play otherwise we wouldn't be where we are

47:38.240 --> 47:45.520
right now time could not have been smeared into the fifth year unless this was what happened or

47:45.520 --> 47:50.240
something you know this is broad strokes right so i'm not claiming to know what happened when

47:50.240 --> 47:55.920
i put this little recipe on the on the this is just again trying to expand this limited spectrum

47:55.920 --> 48:04.560
of debate that really restrains the limited spectrum of possibilities that up until very recent work

48:06.240 --> 48:11.920
and the the continuous work of of people like marqulak and myself and a few others

48:12.560 --> 48:20.480
this possibility space is finally expanding to include the obvious possibility that this is a

48:20.480 --> 48:28.080
an elaborate scheme to permanently change the way the earth is governed and so if you get on that team

48:28.080 --> 48:33.520
presuming that team's gonna win it's gonna be certain things that you're gonna have to stick to in

48:33.520 --> 48:38.880
order to make sure that none of that stuff is seen that none of that stuff is computed that

48:38.960 --> 48:44.720
their average person who's just skillfully watching television never comes to those conclusions

48:47.920 --> 48:52.800
and so there were lots of winning participants there were lots of unwitting participants

48:54.880 --> 48:58.720
it's not about blame anymore it's about everybody seeing what happened

48:59.920 --> 49:04.880
you know so you can just shake your head and come out of the water and go whoa holy cow can you believe

49:04.880 --> 49:14.960
it because in reality we should all shake our heads and go man oh man we we really blew it

49:21.840 --> 49:27.920
we really blew it because it has been we're on our fifth year now we have really blew it this

49:27.920 --> 49:34.640
illusion of consensus about a novel virus that killed millions of people that we could save millions

49:34.640 --> 49:44.320
more from if we just did it right this illusion was seated in our minds on purpose so that this

49:44.320 --> 49:50.880
whole charade could be smeared into the fifth year and that by the end of this smear the past

49:50.880 --> 49:56.560
would be forgotten the erasure would be forgotten and the lie would become the truth

49:58.080 --> 50:03.520
and the lie is this faith in a novel virus that something really just happened in 2019 and

50:04.080 --> 50:09.280
this is the consequence of it we cannot let our children grow up believing this

50:13.280 --> 50:13.840
look at it

50:18.880 --> 50:21.040
and think about how many people don't question it

50:26.560 --> 50:31.120
and again you can form it however you want it you can make it a background signal I think is the

50:31.200 --> 50:38.880
best way to describe it because it's just wholly uncharacterized nathan wolf and and his whole

50:39.600 --> 50:46.000
his whole show used this background to claim that they were doing and looking for things that no

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
one else was looking for that in this infinite background they were going to find new forms of

50:52.000 --> 51:00.640
life that was what nathan wolf's whole story was and now on the background of this entirely

51:00.640 --> 51:06.960
unknown black DNA RNA whatever it is unknown life forms galore

51:09.040 --> 51:14.480
now we suddenly have a PCR test that works great on that background we've got a set of sequencing

51:14.480 --> 51:20.000
primers that works great on that background nothing nothing gets picked up besides what we're looking

51:20.000 --> 51:35.520
for it it's hard to imagine how much advantage we have lost to these weaponized piles of money

51:35.520 --> 51:42.800
it's very hard to underestimate it but we can't stop because it's for our children and our grandchildren

51:42.800 --> 51:50.800
that we resist this it's for our grandchildren that we resist this the goal should be spoken out

51:50.800 --> 51:59.840
loud that our grandchildren never get a vaccine in their life and that if they do become immunized

51:59.840 --> 52:08.320
they're immunized at a barrier that's it no more intramuscular injection in modern times that's

52:08.320 --> 52:12.400
what we should be going for if we're not going for that then we're not going for the touchdown

52:12.400 --> 52:16.720
that we need and we need to start rallying the troops

52:20.880 --> 52:25.600
so that nobody i mean this is a this ball needs a lot of pushing up the hill yet

52:27.520 --> 52:30.560
if we're going to break this illusion that everybody's still pushing

52:31.280 --> 52:34.880
that the worst case scenarios again a function laboratory weapon that could kill

52:34.880 --> 52:40.960
70 percent of the people on earth an Ebola that is flying around aerosolized would be the worst

52:40.960 --> 52:45.920
thing ever an airplane of that landing in new york city would be a disaster that is

52:47.440 --> 52:52.400
how they are going to entrap our children and the only way that happens is if they make

52:52.400 --> 52:58.720
enough of it and then they apply it that can't happen by accident it can't happen on somebody's

52:58.720 --> 53:02.160
shoe it can't happen if a flask falls over

53:06.800 --> 53:13.360
but unfortunately there are an awful lot of books out there that repeat the story

53:16.960 --> 53:24.320
and the one book that i think is probably the best one the wuhan cover up is the best because it has

53:24.320 --> 53:33.840
quotes from people i wasn't able to convince the author that that the biology of clones

53:34.720 --> 53:42.720
is explanatory enough and exculpatory enough so that so that you have to dismiss the idea of a

53:42.720 --> 53:51.680
pandemic virus but the idea got in the book the idea is in bobby's head he knows that it's possible

53:51.680 --> 53:59.200
there's hope none of these other books even have a hint of the idea that maybe it was

53:59.200 --> 54:07.360
faked maybe it was an elaborate setup by the biosecurity state in order to invert our rights

54:08.480 --> 54:16.480
to permissions at least bobby's book is talking about that from the perspective of a long plan

54:16.720 --> 54:27.920
and seeing biosecurity and bioweapons and biology in general as sort of the ultimate way the ultimate

54:27.920 --> 54:39.200
goal for governance on a global scale for humanity's future it's an it's a real interwoven you know

54:39.200 --> 54:46.960
medicine public health genetics the human genome project and bioweapons are all woven together the

54:46.960 --> 54:52.080
only book that talks about that and how and tells that story is bobby's book

54:54.640 --> 54:58.240
all these other ones are just elaborate scooby-doo stories

54:59.120 --> 55:06.960
at least bobby's book tries to to catalog the history of this stuff and what people said during this

55:11.040 --> 55:14.160
at least it had he had the guts to include something said by me

55:17.920 --> 55:19.040
that's how i see it anyway

55:22.240 --> 55:27.760
and so really important to understand how crucial it was to have these people in place that would

55:27.760 --> 55:34.880
never question the virus but more importantly hype it up hype up the worst case scenario hype

55:34.880 --> 55:41.600
up the connection between the spike protein and all these additive nasties they didn't blame

55:42.880 --> 55:48.880
you know the cardiac effects on the end protein they didn't blame the cardiac effects on on

55:48.880 --> 55:53.920
protein number 28 or a product from open reading frame seven

55:54.640 --> 56:00.880
they blamed the cardiac effects on the spike they blamed the amyloidosis on the spike they blamed the

56:00.880 --> 56:13.120
uh the the the interotoxin b aspects on the spike they blamed the the hiv epitopes on the spike

56:14.880 --> 56:18.160
and so then again you can see clearly how this is not a

56:19.120 --> 56:25.200
a random accumulation of of conclusions it is a preceded narrative to make sure

56:25.920 --> 56:31.920
that the limited spectrum of debate and the lively discussion within it never questioned the novel

56:31.920 --> 56:40.080
virus and it's spread and that was the effect of getting in the car with these people when you

56:40.080 --> 56:44.080
were stuck on that street all by yourself and these cars driving by you think well one of them's

56:44.080 --> 56:49.200
got to be full of good guys no none of them were full of good guys that's the whole point it

56:49.200 --> 56:57.920
didn't matter whether you got in in Paul Catrell's car or George Webb's car or eventually got into

56:57.920 --> 57:03.120
Brett Weinstein's car it wouldn't matter because the illusion of consensus the faith in a novel

57:03.120 --> 57:12.240
virus was never questioned and in fact was disgust and delineated and described in detail

57:12.880 --> 57:20.800
by these people so that we would enjoy our ride on the highway so that we knew where we were going

57:23.440 --> 57:28.000
more of an announcement rather than a warning or a or a caution

57:32.240 --> 57:38.560
believe about vaccines until we invent really one month before breaking until we have a pandemic

57:38.560 --> 57:44.560
that's killing everyone you know and you know it's not it's you know measles plus and okay I

57:44.560 --> 57:49.920
can tolerate what you think about measles because you know not that many people die from it it's

57:49.920 --> 57:59.200
just a big hassle in the end but no one when we have this new pandemic that is you know got 75 percent

57:59.200 --> 58:07.600
mortality and it's not it's that there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these

58:07.600 --> 58:13.920
beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be and this is just sheer contingency as

58:13.920 --> 58:22.640
to whether in one condition or another I mean so there's no real way at this point in retrospect

58:22.640 --> 58:30.240
to see that as a random event there's absolute it's not possible not when all the things line up

58:30.240 --> 58:36.720
like this when you look right right that that's not possible everything's lining up when you turn

58:36.720 --> 58:40.720
and it goes think whoa wait what what did Sam Harris say on the

58:41.920 --> 58:46.080
in December and on the eighth podcast of Brett Weinstein what did he say and did Brett agree

58:46.080 --> 58:47.040
with him yes he did

58:54.800 --> 59:01.680
and so of course you know the famous podcast that occurred in mid 2021 1.5 years after breaking

59:02.160 --> 59:08.240
welcome to the dark horse podcast I am Brett Weinstein I should say in this case I am Dr.

59:08.240 --> 59:13.760
Brett Weinstein and that will become relevant based on what our topic is let me say a little bit

59:13.760 --> 59:20.640
about who I am and then I will introduce our two guests so I am a PhD in biology my specialty

59:20.640 --> 59:28.800
is evolution I have some background in immunobiology and I am going to be acting today in the role of

59:28.800 --> 59:35.600
professor sometimes student other times traffic cop and translator that's my plan in order to get

59:35.600 --> 59:42.320
this very complex story simple enough that people can understand it because it is of the utmost

59:42.320 --> 59:48.400
importance all right oh one other thing I should say is that there is also a final role for me which

59:48.400 --> 59:53.600
is that when I was a graduate student I did some work on telomere senescence and cancer and accidentally

59:53.600 --> 01:00:00.400
unearthed a flaw in our drug safety system that as far as I know still exists despite my effort

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.480
to raise the alarm about it so anyway this is not the first time I have encountered the drug safety

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:12.960
issue and it is a thorny and a wicked problem as some might say to my right we have Robert Malone

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:22.800
Robert Malone is an MD PhD no masters masters and MD he is also and most significantly here the

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.080
inventor of mRNA vaccine technology from back as a graduate student am I correct yeah and I'm

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.600
also a licensed physician in Maryland a licensed physician in Maryland and to my left is Steve

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:42.160
Kirsch who is a serial entrepreneur and actually you want to tell us about your your role in

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.880
COVID treatment research sure I started the COVID-19 early treatment fund and we fund scientists

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.400
throughout the world on looking at repurposed drugs for outpatient clinical trials and because

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:03.440
the using repurposed drugs is the fastest safest and and lowest cost way to end the pandemic

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.760
all right excellent so I must say that this is a difficult topic for us to address we all I believe

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.880
are agreed that something very serious is afoot and the public is largely unaware that they have

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.040
been placed into a kind of danger and we also know that there's a great deal of stigma directed at

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.960
those who would explore these dangers I know that I personally feel a certain amount of jeopardy

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.320
over talking about these things publicly but I also feel a moral obligation to do so in light

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.520
of the fact that I believe in my heart of hearts that a great many lives are at stake there's just

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.040
simply no question that come hell or high water this must be discussed I would imagine you gentlemen

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.480
feel similarly yeah I I'm particularly concerned by all the censorship because it's making so that

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.320
we cannot have a rational discussion cannot have a rational discussion I think it's a very a very

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.160
fair way to put it I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.160
here unmasked and I should point out that actually we are in an interesting sense a model of something

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:17.600
that I believe is not on the public radar so if I'm correct you Robert have had COVID I've had

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:24.880
COVID and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna all right Steve you have been vaccinated fully

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.120
vaccinated with Moderna all right I am unvaccinated but I would argue that the censorship of Robert

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:39.120
Malone and Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch after this podcast actually drove thousands of people to

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:47.760
Gab thousands of people to get her thousands of people went from and and heard about him being

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.560
censored on LinkedIn this was all done on purpose and in the meantime then they were able to complain

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.200
about it publicly and when they complained about it publicly there was no censorship of that complaining

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.120
and in the meantime all the people that were really making noise and had been making noise for the

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.920
year and a half before this were being censored without the ability to complain about it

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.640
with no platform from which to wine and remember the worst thing that happened to Brett Weinstein

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:23.280
was that after this video was pulled his YouTube channel was demonetized and we know that people

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.920
can't make a lot of money off of YouTube no matter how many views you have so it's a little again

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:34.880
disingenuous to portray that as a real true censorship when again you get on these these TV programs

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.520
like Tucker Carlson you're not really being censored let's keep going I am on prophylactic

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.720
ivermectin and the data actually shocking as this will be to some people the data suggests

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.960
that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.640
covid when taken properly so Jessica I see that you're in the audience if you haven't seen this

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.200
video yet what there's about to be said is going to shock you so i'm going to back it up a little

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.480
bit and play it again you Robert have had covid i've had covid and i've been fully vaccinated

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:18.000
with Moderna all right Steve you have been vaccinated fully vaccinated with Moderna all right i am

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.920
unvaccinated but i am on prophylactic ivermectin and the data actually shocking as this will be to

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.160
some people the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.360
preventing people from contracting covid when taken properly so aside from the risk that

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.640
possibly the ivermectin i got wasn't real and i have every reason to think it was it certainly

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.200
appears to be the the genuine article i believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:54.960
kind of composite herd immunity where through three different routes covid vaccine and ivermectin

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.520
we are protected and you are it's fair doubly protected so i would just say for anybody who's

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.440
enthusiastic about the vaccines if you're unconvinced by what we have to say about the

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.800
hazard of them one thing to consider is that the way to get society to herd immunity and therefore

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:15.200
drive covid 19 to extinction which ought to be our goal the way to do it is to get people covid 19

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.720
to extinction through prophylaxis whether it's through a vaccine or whether it's because they've

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:26.960
had covid already when one could argue that if everybody just took ivermectin for a month

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:34.640
worldwide really end the pandemic um some will find the title that i have given this episode

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:41.120
perplexing i would ask them to stick with the episode through the end and i will explain why

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.560
i titled it as i did i i really believe that actually we have the capacity at any moment we

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:52.720
decide to utilize it to end the pandemic and that it is it is well within reach should we

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.920
choose to see what is in front of us but we will get there later on you know kind of like it's kind

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.560
of like Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz that she always had the ability to go back to Kansas

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.680
we've always had the ability to end this pandemic it's just a question of whether we want to use

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.680
it or not well actually i'm going to push back slightly on you Steve i believe i don't i was

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:17.200
actually going to inquire from my friends who are closest to this but i i didn't get to it before

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.520
the podcast but i believe we probably have had the ability to end the pandemic at any point in the

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.600
last six months that we chose to i'm not sure it goes all the way back because i'm not sure we

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:33.440
would have known what to do yes we've had the drugs available and then the know-how we developed

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.680
uh late last year right yeah okay so if you'll let me my pushback as a virologist uh

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:48.160
molecular virologist and physician and outbreak specialist um i think that so herd immunity is

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:55.600
a noble cause and objective but if you look worldwide um i i think that we kind of have to plan

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:04.960
that we're unlikely to achieve it so i i i applaud the logic um i think the probability is really

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.040
high there's no way pragmatically we're going to get there and we're going to be stuck with this

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.880
virus in various forms for the rest of our lives all right well here's the thing um we're

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.120
not going to get bogged down here because it's not the central reason for our conversation i do

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.200
want to have that conversation with you at some point because i believe what i'm doing is i'm

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:29.120
probably butchering the term you herd immunity by arguing that somebody who's on prophylactic

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:35.840
ivermectin is within the herd but uh in any case i i believe that it is possible based on at least

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.160
the argentina study which suggests essentially a hundred percent effectiveness of ivermectin

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.080
yeah i i told you we're good it's it's uh i mean we're quibbling and it's not it's off

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.240
scope what you're what you're saying is that from a practical point of view but the point is my

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.600
point is that if if we were able to just like we're trying to kind of get everybody to take the

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:02.240
vaccine if we had put that into getting everybody to take ivermectin and fluvoxamine for for a month

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.000
if we and if we could accomplish that then covid would be wiped out we could do it and actually any

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:16.400
municipality that could regulate its borders ivermectin and fluvoxamine for a month let's put

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:22.960
everybody on an antidepressant and messes with something to do with your serotonin and ivermectin

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:33.040
for a month and end the pandemic holy cow i mean holy cow just could clear the disease if

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:38.800
you could accomplish that go i i believe if we had put that into getting everybody to take ivermectin

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:45.280
and fluvoxamine for for a month if we and if we could accomplish that then covid would be wiped

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.400
out we could do it and actually any municipality that could regulate its borders could clear the

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:56.080
disease if you could accomplish that go i believe and it's just a question look at robert practically

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.880
speaking we agree with you robert it's it's practically speaking it's hard to pull off i'm

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:06.880
saying that theoretically if we could get agreement because we have well how about this let's table

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.360
this i will i will give you my plan at the end of this and my claim is that actually there is he's

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.040
looking into the camera right now smiling because his controllers or the people that he's employed by

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:26.640
he's laughing because he's like i don't even have to do anything these guys will go bananas without

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.800
me i he didn't even have to queue them up they were already going way way way into the weeds it's

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:41.600
wonderful so ivermectin maybe depending on whether he got real ivermectin or not he actually threw

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.200
that out there is a possibility vaccine times two vaccine times two plus infection this is

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.040
herd immunity in a joking sort of way no masks are needed for these guys we could end the pandemic

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.440
if we just locked down harder and also gave people an SSRI definitely the need for new things maybe

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:07.840
an SSRI plus ivermectin for 60 days would work zero covid is definitely possible though and it

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.600
should still be a goal according to the man in the middle there vaccines work obviously because

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.840
of number one but they also can hurt and that's what the the very careful language is about that's

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.040
coming up in the show and then they're going to distinguish between old vaccines and new vaccines

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.040
and old vaccines obviously work but let's not get confused we don't know if these work yet as well

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.960
as we hope that's what this show is about one and a half years after the breaking was begun

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:46.000
one and a half years this is after the first full year of university this is after the first

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.480
full year of remote schooling that our children went through not the half a year

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:58.400
that was from march to june in 2020 i'm talking about the full year that went from september

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.120
2020 until may or june in 2021 that's what i'm talking about and this was after that

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.080
this was six months or seven months after they had done adenovirus injections in the

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:20.720
uk and around the world and they had done uh RNA injections in the uk and around the world

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.480
at least six months after that started one and a half years after the breaking is when they are

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:39.280
doing this this should not be considered early kenut with koski was early i got fired in 2020

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.040
i got sent home

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.680
and my contract was paid out i got sent home in 2020 they did not fire me

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.520
what could they have fired me for they didn't extend my contract

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.880
and that all happened before these people ever pulled their head out and when they pulled their

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.760
head out what did they tell us that you don't need masks if you use ivermectin the right secret way

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.360
like the freemasons do you don't need to wear a mask if you've taken two shots or if you have had

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.280
the infection and taken two shots that the lockdowns work that we should just for if we could just

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.000
forcibly drug everybody it would be fine

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.480
that's where they were a year and a half after the narrative was started a year and a half after

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:49.200
the breaking was begun after the second year the first full year of our children being home on screens

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:57.600
so it's the spread of bad ideas are much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of any RNA

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.920
molecule you can answer your question by looking at what Brett was saying in 2020 he didn't move the

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.000
ball at all he was frightened and he was a skilled tv watcher that wore a bandana around his neck

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.960
to remind his viewers that you needed to mask up and i would argue that these people were

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.000
put in place a couple years or a year before the pandemic on purpose that's why

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:34.400
Sam Harris was on Brett Weinstein's number eight podcast on December 19th 2019 to say that we won't

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:42.160
be able to tolerate anti-vaxxers when the real new pandemic comes it's not by accident

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:48.800
it's not by accident that we were meant to feel as though we were alone on a highway and it's not

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:54.240
to meant and not an accident that we were meant to that we ended up finding ourselves looking for answers

01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:01.600
on screens and it's not by accident that those screens were populated by people who are controlling

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:07.600
this narrative wanted you to see arguments that they wanted you to participate in arguments that

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:15.440
they wanted you to take a side on because then by doing that you would also accept the mystery

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.560
solving exercise and you would accept the monsters in the story because it doesn't matter what's true

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:29.760
it matters what's perceived is true and what's perceived as true right now is that the toxicity

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.840
of the vaccine cannot be divorced from the toxicity of the spike protein and then it's very hard for

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.280
us to tell what's going on and it's varied and whether you accept it's a lot or a little

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.440
but in the end the spike protein is still hurting people causing long COVID and all this other stuff

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.400
so we're still in the car and no matter what arguments we get in from the back seat to the

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.960
front seat they're still accepting this and we're arguing about what's on the radio

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:15.840
and so this is where we are right this this this is what we're doing and let's see where we are

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:23.600
when we look at Brett's video with with Tucker Carlson that just happened a couple days ago

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.240
I think it's a worthwhile worth to spend time on it just to see where the the narrative is and

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:37.040
oops and how that really works you're speaking in grand terms that three years ago I might have

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.200
laughed at and not laughing at all you're also choosing as you know a 50-year-old man to say

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.000
the stuff out loud and to pursue the truth as you find it and then to talk about it why did you

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.800
decide to do that I literally cannot understand how I would sleep at night how I would look at myself

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.560
in the mirror if I didn't say what needed to be said I call the force that we're up against Goliath

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.040
Goliath made a terrible mistake and made it most egregiously during COVID which is it took

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:05.760
all of the competent people all of the creative and it shoved them out of the institutions where

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.920
they were hanging on and it created in so doing the dream team created every player you could

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.360
possibly want on your team to fight some historic battle against a terrible evil

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.720
amazingly it was four years next month that the first stories appeared in the American news

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.600
media about a virus spreading through a city in central China Wuhan the virus didn't have a name

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.240
over time it was named COVID and it changed world history it wasn't that long ago but we don't

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.280
talk about it very much anymore in the way that you don't talk about traumatic things that happened

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.600
to you but that doesn't mean it's over and it doesn't mean that huge decisions aren't being made

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.920
right now that will affect your life and the lives of your children those decisions are being made

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.560
the story is not over and so we thought it would be worth taking just a moment to explain what that

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.960
looks like and there's no better person to do that than Brett Weinstein he's an evolutionary

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.560
biologist he taught at the college level for many years he's got a fascinating bio she should look

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.240
up because it's an amazing story he's now the host with his wife of the dark horse podcast

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.640
and the author of a best-selling and very excellent book

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.920
they came out on the movie joins us now it's great to see you it's great to see you so instead of

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.320
peppering you with all kinds of pointed questions i want to guide you and sit back mostly as you

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.160
tell the story of COVID in condensed form what are the outlines of what we know now and where we going

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.120
what's the next chapter in the story well first let me just respond to something you said up front

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.120
nobody wants to be thinking about COVID anyway it was a traumatic and exhausting experience i don't

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.120
want to be thinking about getting more either but what i find is that every time i look away and

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.840
move on to other topics things move just out of our sideline and these things couldn't possibly

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.680
be more important so i'm going to try to explain where we are and how we got here and what the

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.720
implications are in the present that people are largely not noticing perfect all right so i thought

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.280
maybe it would be worth starting with just some parts of the education that we all got during

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.480
COVID i know that i learned a tremendous amount about not only viruses and pandemics and public

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.840
health but also about pharma which is something frankly i thought i knew a lot about i had the

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.080
run into it earlier in my academic career so i thought i was something of an expert that i got

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.440
schooled over the course of COVID what i've come to understand is something i call the game of pharma

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.680
if you think about what pharma is we tend to imagine that it is an industry that is uh hell

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:08.880
bent on finding drugs that will make us healthier yes that's not what it is in fact pharma is healthy

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.400
when people are sick and many people have noticed this that of course it depends on ill health so

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.360
it has a perverse incentive but what i think most of us did not realize is how elaborate its

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.280
bag of tricks is and what the nature of that bag of tricks is and to to describe it i would say

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.520
pharma is a an intellectual property racket or at least that's what it has become that essentially

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:35.120
pharma owns various things it owns molecules compounds it owns technologies and what it's looking

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:41.360
for is a disease to which these things plausibly apply and its profits go up to the extent that

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.160
the disease is widespread to the extent of disease is serious to the extent that competing drugs

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.640
are unsafe or ineffective to the extent that the government will mandate a drug to the extent

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.920
that the medical establishment will declare the standard of care all of these things you've just

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.280
described pandemic response well that i did and that's where i learned all of these tricks um was

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.640
that basically every day of the year pharma is engaged in um portraying the properties that it

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.400
owns as more useful than they are safer than they are and persuading the medical establishment

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.520
the journals the societies the hospitals the government um to direct people towards drugs

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:21.520
they wouldn't otherwise be taking so that's um what the the racket is and and it is necessary to

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.560
understand that because you need to realize that before covid ever happened um pharma was expert

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.120
at figuring out how to portray a disease as more widespread and more serious than it was it was

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.640
excellent at portraying a compound as more efficacious than it is safer than it is and so when covid

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.520
happened all of this occurred at a different scale covid was bigger than anything that had

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.120
ever happened before but none of it was new to pharma and all of it was new to us in the public

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.280
trying to understand what we were supposed to do about this uh ostensibly very serious disease

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:54.240
so i'm now going to put a hypothesis on the table about why things unfolded the way they did um

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.840
and it involves that game of pharma what was pharma thinking why was it so obsessed with making sure

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.960
that we all took uh the so-called vaccines that were on offer why was it so obsessed with making

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.920
sure that we didn't take the alternative repurposed drugs that so many doctors claimed were highly

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:19.120
affected and so just to put you where we are right now um he said that we learned about viruses and

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.800
learned about pandemics but didn't really tell us what we learned about that and right away we

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:29.680
learned about pharma's big bag of tricks and how it's an intellectual property racket that revolves

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:37.440
around drug sales and pharma was an expert at at increasing or exaggerating the illusion or role

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:44.640
of a particular disease or condition in the public and was also very effective at creating the illusion

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:52.480
of efficacy for these various treatments and so he has focused his first few minutes besides

01:20:53.120 --> 01:21:00.640
saying general things about who he is on big pharma without saying who or what forces are

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.320
behind it or whether there's any d o d contracts or whether there are any DARPA contracts or an

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:13.520
NIH contracts or or private equity contracts or whatever whether there are investments in these

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.920
companies and what those investments might mean and what intellectual property exactly that he's

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:24.000
talking about is just glossed over when very clearly if intellectual property is what they

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.480
are centered around a big bag of tricks and an intellectual property racket that I think it's

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:38.400
worthwhile to be more specific here but it seems like the basic idea is to set pharma up as a bad

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:45.920
guy without being too specific about how bad they are and and and how to see their bad actions for

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.520
for the for the bad actions that they are I'm not sure he's helping us but again we're only

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.920
six minutes in there could be lots of truth here he's in general of course right on right

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.720
that there is a goliath I call weaponized piles of money um covid was a traumatic event but that

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:10.960
was on purpose and so we learned the wrong things about pandemics and viruses if we accept I think

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.360
where where he is treatments right ivermectin hydroxychloroquine these things were demonized

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.080
and we were uh told not to take them and we were mocked if we distrusted that advice so the

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.080
question is what was all that why would that have happened and again this is this is not certain

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.320
but what I've pieced together is that pharma owned what was potentially the um the biggest

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.360
pharmacological cash cow conceivable it owned a beautiful technology and I mean that sincerely

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:41.120
something truly brilliant um that would potentially not only allow a bright future from the perspective

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:46.560
of creating new treatments and new I hesitate to use the word vaccine because it doesn't really

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.040
apply but new vaccine like technologies but that it could do this indefinitely in the future and

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.040
it could allow you to reformulate every vaccine currently on the market and what's more the property

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.360
in question would allow this whole process to be streamlined at an incredible level because

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.520
effectively all you needed was a sequence a genetic sequence from a pathogen and you could

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:09.600
literally type it into a machine and produce a vaccine that was already in use but for the

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:15.840
swapping out of the antigen question so that's really extraordinary right because that's the

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.760
illusion that we've been fighting against that's the illusion that I've been was trying to teach

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:28.400
Brett Weinstein in early 22 when I finally got on our late 21 when I finally got on a signal chat

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:36.480
with him and could start explaining what transfection was so it's such a weird place for him to be

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:42.400
where he starts out by saying a truly brilliant and beautiful technology that has the potential

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:52.000
to replace every vaccine what so that a child could be transfected maybe 70 times in his or her lifetime

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:02.000
I don't really understand how it's even possible that this is a 2024 video

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:11.840
it might as well be 2021 because the only difference but I just can't believe it I can't believe it

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:18.240
yeah it's exactly like Legos and presumably with some justification to the extent of this technology

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.080
was safe pharma would be able to argue we don't really need to go through thorough safety testing

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.360
of the entire platform each time we deploy it all we need to do is figure out if the antigen

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.120
that we've loaded in this time is in some way more dangerous than the last one the problem

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.200
so that the technology in question is the mRNA transfection platform which was wrongly in this

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.200
case called a vaccine and it is ingenious it solves a really important problem from gene therapy which

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.440
is oftentimes you want to get the body to do something let's say that you are missing a functional

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.760
copy of a gene that produces some product like insulin that you need well you could take insulin

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.600
or it would be great if we could convince your body to produce the product itself like a healthy

01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:01.360
see but it doesn't solve that problem transfection puts this expression and this vector

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.960
this RNA in random places using very toxic lipids which are disastrous for the interior of

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.080
ourselves even if they successfully deliver the mRNA where it's supposed to go the modified RNA

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:23.120
the chemically altered arm and RNA it doesn't solve that problem it's not elegant it goes wherever it

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:31.040
wants to and it doesn't do anything remote like replace a protein they can't do that

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.960
this is ridiculous talk person does very hard to do that though because the body is composed

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.440
and adult humans 30 trillion cells or so how do you get cells to take up the message and produce

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.520
enough of the product to matter well the mRNA technology allows you to induce cells to take up

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.120
an mRNA message which they will then automatically transcribe and it does this by encapsulating

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.520
these messages in lipid nanoparticle lipid just means fat and you may remember from basic chemistry

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.680
like attracts like like dissolves like and so these fats get taken up by cells very regularly

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.360
for simple chemical reasons and then the message gets transcribed and voila you've gotten cells

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.800
to produce something that they did not have produced in the first place useful for vaccine

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.400
like technology useful for curing deficiencies so they're not just lipids right they're very very

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.800
special never before tested excipients never before used in humans

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:32.720
and the way that they're prepared and the the uniformity of their preparation and

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:40.640
their transport and whatever is highly suspect but they are extremely toxic as far as as Gabrielle

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:48.960
would say and so here he is glossing over them again saying something that we know is not true

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.640
which is that it's just lipids you know it's lipids and mRNA so in theory it's just like legos

01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.000
we watched a cartoon like that three years ago and lambasted it for how dumb it was and he's still

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:11.360
saying that now there's no other way to interpret this there's no possible way to interpret this

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:21.200
I have the signal chat still on my phone he knows how to explain it better than this he's not doing

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:29.840
it because we are not going to question the faith the problem however is that this amazing

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.400
technology which it's very hard to estimate how much money pharma might have made i think hundreds

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.080
of billions of dollars is absolutely certain trillions of dollars not off the table given that

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.520
this would allow patentable drugs to be produced indefinitely into the future

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.800
but the technology itself has a terrible safety flaw that in my opinion never would have gotten

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:55.440
through even the most cursory safety tests and that flaw is that there's no targeting of the

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.960
lipid nanoparticles the lipid nanoparticles will be taken up by any cell they encounter and while

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.280
that's not perfectly random it will be hazard around the body now if they were limited if they

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.960
simply stayed in the injection site as we were told when the vaccine rollout began

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.360
the the vaccines the so-called vaccines stay in the injection site well then the cells that took

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.680
up these messages would be in your deltoid and what happens next wouldn't be terribly serious

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.880
the problem is we learned very quickly and should have predicted from the getco but they weren't

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.560
going to stay in the delta all of anything you inject in that space is going to leak out and

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.640
it's gonna circulate around the body and here's the problem now forgive me this is a little bit

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:34.000
technical I know that but it involves understanding how immunity naturally develops so when you

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.160
become sick let's say with a virus some particle has gotten into a cell of yours and it has hijacked

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.640
it and it has started it has tricked that cell into producing copies of itself more viruses which

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.960
affect or infect adjacent cells and if the virus is an effective one they will also figure out how

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.960
to jump out of you like when you cough and get inhaled by the next person and infect their cells

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.760
the body's response to seeing a cell of yours which it recognizes as yours that is producing

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.240
an antigen that is to say a protein that it doesn't recognize is to assume that that cell is

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.320
virally infected yes and to destroy it that is the only correct thing for the body to do when

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.400
it encounters a cell of yours making foreign protein now this transaction technology the mRNA

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.360
vaccine technology as they call it does exactly this it tricks your cells into producing foreign

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:21.200
antigens which the immune system cannot help but recognize as an indicator of infection

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.440
and it destroys those cells if those cells are in the muscle in your arm not a huge deal it's not

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.560
good for you to get a sore arm you get a sore arm presumably we might be able to measure a

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:34.000
decrease in your strength but it's not going to shorten your life however if these transaction

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.760
agents circulate around the body as we know they do and get taken up haphazardly then whatever

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.640
tissue starts producing these foreign proteins is going to be attacked by your immune system

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.400
so you definitely wouldn't want any of this getting you're a person's heart or brain um

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.280
definitely not and um very bad if it happens in your brain it's particularly critical if it happens

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.080
in your heart because your heart for reasons we can go into if you want has an incredibly

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.480
low capacity for repair in fact your heart doesn't really repair what it does you get a wound if

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.560
loose cells from your heart uh your heart then scars over that will affect your heart rhythm

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.120
your capacity to transport oxygen and CO2 around the body it will um potentially shorten your life

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.200
and it will also create a vulnerability that you won't know that you have until you're like playing

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.800
soccer or something exactly so if you imagine somebody has received one of these transaction

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.440
shots and um especially in the unfortunate case where it has been injected intravenously which

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:26.800
isn't supposed to happen but instructions on this shot were not to aspirate the needle proper

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.960
injection should evolve pulling back on the plunger in the syringe in order to see if there's blood

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.040
if there's blood that indicates that you've landed in a circulatory vessel and that you should back

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:39.200
the needle off or plunge it farther so that you're not injecting it directly into a vein but in the

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.200
case of these shots amazing as the sounds the advice was don't do that because it requires

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.160
the needle to be in the person's arm longer might create extra pain and they didn't want to create

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.120
vaccine hesitancy was there excuse so anyway you might get a big bolus of uh this material

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.080
and it might flow right through your heart and get taken up by a bunch of cells and just from

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.760
perspective do we have any guesses to how many of these shots were given out globally uh it's

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.400
definitely in the billions um billions yeah it's in the with the mRNA technology yes which is an

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.600
amazing fact i mean the in addition to the technology itself being remarkable the rate at which this

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.680
was scaled up is positively incredible now it had herbal downsides i don't know if we'll have time

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.480
to get to the downsides of the way they scaled up their production on these but if we can separate

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.280
the marvel of what they did yes there's an awful lot of stuff here that's beyond wizardry it's just

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.960
incredible that they accomplished good so i'm sorry i don't want to go track but you were

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.440
describing what would happen if it went to various organs would damage them what could it cause

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.720
cancers to we can get back to that we clearly are seeing an uptick in cancers and an uptick in

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.440
cancers that are unusual especially in their speed um so uh maybe we maybe if we have time we

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.480
can come back to the reasons that that might be occurring is a lot of discussion amongst the

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:47.120
medical dissidents about why that pattern exists and what it implies but yes um clear medical

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:51.840
dissidents who fail your modes of the body and this highly novel technology clearly had that as a

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.000
risk even if we didn't know what mechanism it would happen um but yes if you let's say you're a soccer

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.520
player and you've been injected with uh this stuff and a bolus of it has hit your heart and caused a

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.000
bunch of your cells to be destroyed by your own immune system by uh cytotoxic T cells and natural

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.000
killer cells well now you've got a wound if you manage to survive to have it scar over then that

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.920
wound will be less of a vulnerability than it would otherwise be but if in the period after you've

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.840
been damaged before your heart has fully scarred you were to push yourself to some new athletic

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:21.120
limit now let's say you're in the middle of a particularly intense game right that would be

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.840
exactly the time when a weakness in a vessel wall might cause a critical failure and you know you

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.480
could die on the field so this was a very plausible mechanism to explain the pattern of sudden deaths

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.120
that we have seen oftentimes in people who are unusually healthy and athletic yes um so

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.960
go back to the original story pharma had a potentially uh tremendously lucrative

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.280
property that it couldn't bring to market because a safety test would have revealed this

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:50.720
unsolvable problem at its heart and so what i'm wondering my hypothesis is that it recognized

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.640
that the thing that would bypass that obstacle was an emergency that caused the public to demand

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.040
uh a remedy to allow them to go back to work and to living their lives that would cause

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.920
the government to streamline the safety testing process so that it wouldn't spot these things

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.080
and indeed one of the things that we see in addition to a lot more harm in those safety tests than we

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:16.080
were initially allowed to understand um but also the safety testing was radically truncated so

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:23.280
that long-term harms were impossible to detect so my hypothesis in question is pharma used an

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:29.200
emergency to bypass an obstacle to bring an incredibly lucrative technology um to normalize it in the

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.040
public in the regulatory apparatus to sneak it by the things that would ordinarily prevent the

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.280
dangerous technology like this one from being widely deployed so i think that sounds entirely

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:42.240
plausible um effectively but very likely but the downside for pharma and of course the rest of us

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.640
is that if you roll out a harmful product of aiding the conventional safety screens you're

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:51.600
gonna hurt a lot of people and then what so just first part of the question what do you think

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:57.280
we're gonna see in terms of a a death toll and injury toll from this vaccine okay so first of

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.280
all just want to make sure that everybody realizes and it's been in the chat so i know that you guys

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.440
see it and that the bolus theory is something that may account for some small percentage of all

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.000
adverse reactions to injection that are is intended to be intramuscular or

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.120
uh subcutaneous but you don't usually have that problem subcutaneous injection you have it with

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:25.760
intramuscular injection and so yes weight lifters who inject in their legs have known that this can

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:32.240
occur um other people have known that this can occur it could be partially responsible for

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:40.000
endothelial damage or for there being a particular place that the the vaccine ends up because they've

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.200
looked at that before in terms of intramuscular injection or IV injection where it goes and how

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:53.040
it goes there but he has not said even come close to saying that every time a cell is

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.800
transfected and expresses a foreign protein in the immune system comes along to destroy it there is

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:07.200
the chance there is the chance that that cleanup process will result in an autoimmune response

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:13.280
that is directed at that tissue and if that tissue is endothelial cells if that tissue is

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:21.360
cardiac muscle then inflammation will inevitably result in the immune system attacking that tissue

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:29.600
in the future that's the issue at hand here that's going to result in the long-term side effects

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:36.560
of transfection that nobody wants to talk about and the most unpredictable side effects because if

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:43.920
you develop autoimmunity to the endothelial cells that line your brain it might be a very

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.400
different symptomology than if you develop autoimmunity to the endothelial cells that are present in

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:58.320
your liver and these may be molecularly unique enough so that depending on where the transfection

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.080
occurs the effect of autoimmunity to those particular endothelial cells may be unique

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.640
in other words the the compounding nature of this biology makes it almost

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.640
infinitely unpredictable what would potentially happen if you transfect someone with a lipid

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:26.480
nanoparticle of this nature and yet he's still dumb simplifying this down too well you know wherever

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:30.400
it goes that the immune system is going to kill those cells so then that's going to be damaged

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.320
in some places you can damage in other places you can if it goes in your arm and the immune

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:40.080
system kills themselves maybe it hurts and so if it works well for you you'll have arm pain

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.080
I mean you see the story that he's telling there it's extraordinary a lot has gone into

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:50.240
preventing us from answering that question and some very dedicated people have done some very

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.400
high quality work and the numbers are staggering now I'm hesitant to say what I think the toll

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.960
might be because this is not my area of expertise and I would leave it to others I would say

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.720
John Campbell would be an excellent source to look at there's some new material out of New Zealand

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.960
which is jaw dropping I haven't had time to look at it in depth so I'm a little concerned about

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.520
putting my weight on the ice but let's say well here's what we here's what we know

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.000
Joseph Freeman and his colleagues including Peter Doshi did a an evaluation of Pfizer's own

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.960
safety data from its safety trials these trials were absurdly short in fact Pfizer only allowed

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.600
one month before it vaccinated its controls and made it impossible to detect further harms and

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.600
what they found was a one in 800 rate of serious adverse event this is not minor stuff this is

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.200
serious harm to health one in 800 per shot that's not per person that's per shot one in 800 rate

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:50.160
which in one month that suggests a very a very high mortality risk and in fact we saw mortality

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.200
in the safety trials what happens over the long time we've certainly seen such a range of pathologies

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.680
that have crippling effect I want to just comment on somebody in the chat optimizer says the T cell

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:07.360
attack on MHC bound foreign proteins is an autoimmunity that is true that presupposition that presupposes

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.960
the existence of a previous set of cytotoxic T cells which would recognize a portion of that

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:18.160
protein that would be presented by MHC it's most likely that the receptor binding domain of that

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.800
particular protein should it exist and have that function would be the thing that would be presented

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:29.920
or it would be the most in in the model of the immune system where damage associated molecular

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.160
patterns are targeted by the immune system then it would be the most hydrophobic portion of the

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.280
spike protein that would be presented and if that had sufficient homology to previous hydrophobic

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:46.320
portions of these kinds of signals and then there would be a pre-existing c-tailed cytotoxic T cell

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:52.320
population that could target that presentation on MHC one separate from that though would be the

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.920
expression of these proteins on the outside of cells just from transfection not the presentation

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.120
but just the expression of them on the outside of the cells and from previous

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.520
transfection you would have circulating antibodies which would bind to those proteins

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:14.320
and bring in complement and bring in neutrophils and bring in natural killer cells that would

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.760
destroy that endothelium and then that endothelium would need to be cleaned up by macrophages that

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.760
in theory could present self-antigens that's the the where i think you're challenging the

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.160
immune system not to make a mistake i hope i'm being clear go ahead Brett some people's

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.960
health that i should order to think how many people have actually so i'm not a math genius but

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:42.560
one in eight hundred shots times billions is you know a lot of people yep there was a press i was

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.520
recently at a conference in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.560
unpack what we actually understand and i saw a credible estimate or something like 17 million

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.240
deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the covid backs well when you

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.480
know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:09.040
that's dangerous now to your deeper question i think let's steal man just from perspective i mean

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.480
that's like the death toll of the global war yes absolutely it is this is a great tragedy of

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:20.800
history so of that proportion and amazingly there is no way in which it's over i mean we are still

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:26.640
apparently recommending these things for healthy children ever so i think you just said the 17

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:36.480
million number correct me if i'm wrong that's the number from from you big idiot um that's the number

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:45.920
from um from uh Denny Weinstein or Denny Weinstein and Denny Rancour in Canada and so

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.040
presumably he's not going to address the idea that Denny Rancour also had no evidence of spread

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.360
from these various mass casualty events that were purported to be the start of the pandemic

01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.520
so i think he's going to skip over that which i think is important because those events that

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:07.680
Jessica Hockett has looked at and that that uh Jonathan angler has looked at and other people

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.880
have investigated to show that although there were a lot of people that are reported to have

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:19.680
died in these places it didn't spread from those places in the expected manner that a respiratory

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.000
virus that was the most contagious virus in the history of mankind because of a fear and cleavage

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:31.120
site would have done and so without that that that evidence is also missing from Denny's analysis

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.600
it's also missing from John Bodewin's analysis another very important data set

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.760
and he's glossing over this full year of 2020 where he wasn't able to speak up but people like

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:49.600
Robert F Kennedy jr were able to speak up and Knut Wieckowski were able to speak up and Michael

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:56.560
Yeden was able to speak up and uh Wolfgang Wodock were able to speak up and i think it's important

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:02.560
to realize that that it would make his case even better if he said that you know we lost some people

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:09.280
to this like people tried to speak up and got canceled speak up and got told to shut up that's

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.000
why i'm the one who's speaking because there's a lot of people who spoke up and paid the price

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:21.120
that would make his his case even more dramatic but somehow or another history starts with his

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:28.160
light bulb coming up and i i think that's not helping us at much and in the way of again

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.040
it makes the case even better if we're like we're in this fifth year now

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:40.000
and we're still doing the same song and dance the only thing we're not doing is touching shoes

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.640
together instead of shaking hands but it wouldn't surprise me if we go back to that again

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.520
Brett was probably doing that in 2020 first at any chance of getting any benefit from

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.960
every chance of suffering harms that are uh not only serious but tragic on the basis that

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.040
children have a long lives ahead of everyone in a child's immune system uh in use they have

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.360
to spend the rest of their presumably shortened life in that state so never made any sense that

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.560
we were giving us the kids in the first place the fact that we're still doing it when the

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.760
emergency to the extent there even was one is clearly over and um when there's never been any

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.280
proper justification of administering it to healthy kids it's just healthy kids don't die of

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.720
COVID um and the shot doesn't prevent you from catching or transmitting it so there was there

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:27.520
was just literally no justification you could come up but i think a lot of us um maybe

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:33.840
call us normies have a hard time i wonder i wonder if Brett can come up with any objections

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.040
for not taking the the uh HPV shot i wonder if he can come up with any objections for not taking

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:47.680
the hepatitis B shot at birth wonder if he's ever thought about it will he ever question it

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.360
will he as a as a as an evolutionary biologist who inevitably must know about development because

01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.640
evolutionary biologists think about development as a way of comparing phylogenies and if they

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.360
have parallel developmental pathways in their embryonic stages then that means they're more

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.320
likely to be related if they can't tell from from adult or or conspecific phenotype

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.760
so he's looked at development before and he knows how important is the earlier you are in

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:21.520
development the more danger of damage there is because here at the earlier stage in the cascade

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.240
of events that leads to the pattern integrity that we call human babies and so he has to understand

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.680
very keenly the idea that the sooner you push these vaccines into the development of a baby's brain

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.360
the more likely it is that you'll permanently hamper the development of that baby's brain

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.400
the more vulnerable that baby's brain is the more vulnerable that baby's organs are the more

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:48.400
vulnerable that baby's immune system is the more vulnerable that baby's gut biome is the whole

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:55.840
nine yards and yet somehow or another after four years of this charade after this four years of

01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:02.560
questioning the entire public health apparatus we still haven't really been able to get past this

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:10.480
very myopic view on covid as if that's the only problem there could possibly exist

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:13.920
in our public health apparatus it's just the covid response

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:23.600
it's just covid biology it's not infectious disease biology it's not vaccinology in general

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.720
don't be ridiculous

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:35.360
i'm imagining the um the breathtaking evil that it would take to allow such a tragedy to unfold

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.760
or to pause it to unfold for profit i still struggle to imagine

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.640
but you know there's a lot of moms that uh work at chd that have been struggling to imagine it for

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.760
a lot longer than that

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.800
there are some parents that work at chd that have adult children and they've been

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.680
wondering it for a pretty long time how this for-profit machine can just be allowed to go on

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.920
but it's just about covid

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.760
it's just about these vaccines

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.520
you

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.600
think about think about it this way farm on a normal day is composed of people who have to

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.040
become even if they were doing their job exactly right they have to be comfortable with causing

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.200
a certain amount of that right if you give a drug to people if the net effect is positive but

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.760
it's going to kill some people who would have lived if they never got it somehow you have to

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.960
sleep at night having put that drug into the world and you know we want if we had a healthy

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.600
pharma industry we would want them to produce the drugs that had a net benefit and that benefit

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:52.080
includes some serious harms very easy way to have that work is strict liability on all

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.560
pharmaceutical products it's super easy i bet his dad knows the meaning of those words

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.240
so once you have stepped on that slippery slope though once you have become comfortable

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.560
with causing deaths then i believe it becomes very easy to rationalize um that the greater good

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.840
is being served by x y or z and then there's some point at which you're causing enough harm

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:16.160
and you're you know when pharma takes an old out of patent drug and um supersedes it with

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.240
a new highly profitable drug they've done something that's negative we should almost always prefer

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.920
the older drug unless the evidence is extremely convincing the new drug is just worlds better

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.120
because an old drug we know something about its interactions with other things we know

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:31.600
something about its safety profile i mean we know all kinds of things about old drugs we can use

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:42.800
a a computer generated crystallography model of the RNA protein that translates the RNA

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:50.240
you know the this three cl protease we can make a crystallography model of that and then scan

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:57.680
the entire catalog of known pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals to look for repurposed drugs

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:04.000
that will work very well and we can use that AI computer model machine in a few weeks to

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:11.280
come up with things like remdesivir and pepcid and and and SSRI inhibitor that we can combine

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.520
in unique ways with existing drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and find unique patentable

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.840
combinations that are good to break this pandemic that's what steve kirsch that's what uh robert

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.040
melon that's what all those people were involved in in that first year

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.280
robert melon assembled a team largely of volunteers that actually was able to achieve

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.080
the crystallography model of the three cl protease and model it and scan it against

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:44.160
hundreds of thousands of pharmaceuticals to come up with a list of drugs that needed to be trialed

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:52.640
and that are drugs that he was selling on the on the june 21st or june 2021 podcast with robert

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.200
melon and steve kirsch has been three easy ways to stop the pandemic

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:04.400
and claiming that ivermectin could be used prophylactically to be part of the herd

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.680
and that he was risking life and limb to tell this truth in 2021 one and a half years after the

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:21.280
breaking started and now we are almost four years we are four years from when the breaking started

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:25.360
and he's still basically telling the same story

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:33.920
big pharma did it because they had this ip that they wanted to use and get out there

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.160
he doesn't really call it a transfection horse race but it kind of sounds like that in a way

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.840
let's keep going i don't want to take too much time here i might have to quit early

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.880
new is not better when it comes to molecules that you're going to be taking into your your

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:56.240
allergy um fair but pharma has to be in the business of getting you to take the new and

01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.560
having you distrust the old and so anyway i think i think there's a way in which the rationalization

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.760
has no limit and they've gotten to the point that they are willing to cause a huge amount of

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.760
death apparently um and even at the point that it's been revealed in public they don't stop which

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.480
is another amazing fact you would imagine that they would have been embarrassed into stopping this

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.720
vaccination program at this point so the problem though i would say for for farmen for the politicians

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.360
who uh support and promote them in the media who do the same is that um there are people like you

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.600
who are not cracklots who are scientists and physicians long-time researchers with fully

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.080
credentialed work histories not too many but a sizable number who will not let go who are

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.840
completely dogged in the pursuit of more data about this um so like what do they do with you

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.680
and people like you well i think the astonishing thing is that a as you point out small group of

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.720
dissidents upended their narrative uptake rates on the new boosters are in the low single digit

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:54.160
i might go so far as to argue that a small group of dissidents is uh dissidents uprooted their

01:50:54.160 --> 01:51:02.480
narrative in 2020 in the beginning of 2021 such that in june of 2021 the weaponized piles of money

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.560
that were in charge of making this thing work and last as long as it was supposed to last

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:15.520
uh shifted gears by adding these three new players on the show on the scene and said okay Brett your

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:22.960
cue is now and here's Robert Malone and he's going to come on your stream with this dude and here's

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.160
your script and you guys are going to say this and then you're going to use a bunch of neurolinguistic

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:34.080
programming to make sure that people see you as both a teacher and a professor and a and a referee

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.720
and at some point in this thing that's going to get so heated that i'm going to give a yellow card

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:46.960
all to make it as lively a debate as possible trapped within this limited spectrum of debate

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:54.640
a lively lively discussion and we are just watching the shepherding of that very lively

01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:00.480
discussion trapped within the limited spectrum of debate of a novel virus that killed millions

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.120
but millions more were saved from that will likely come again because this was gain a function

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.880
this is where this narrative is at in 2024 and this is one of the shepherds of it

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:17.440
wittingly or unwittingly i don't really see a possibility of it being unwitting because he is a

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:29.200
bright guy but he's not he's not naive enough to be taken to this level and he knows what i think

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:35.040
because i've told him in a single chit signal chat more than two years ago he knows what i think

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:42.560
and so even if he doesn't believe it's a it's a likely outcome or possibility he knows that it's

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:51.280
an it's on the table and he ignores it oh my goodness they ignore it it is the biology

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:58.320
that everybody ignores it's so a large single digit yes nobody's taken nobody's taken

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.920
now i'm troubled by the fact that at the same time we don't see a massive majority acknowledging

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:06.640
the vaccination campaign was mistaken the first place they got it and they don't want to think

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:11.840
about it and i get it i get it um i wouldn't want to think about it either but the problem is

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.520
it's a moral obligation i mean we're still injecting these things into kids for god's sake so

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.120
it is important to stand up and say i was had and i think all of us were i believe that this

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.520
vaccine was likely effective when it first came out and the thing that triggered Heather and me

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.200
to question it was the fact that we were also told that it was safe which couldn't possibly be true

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.320
might have been harmless but they couldn't say safe because nobody on earth knew what the long

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:37.680
term impacts would be and when so i hope i'm making very clear what i think is being avoided here

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:43.920
the momentum to question the entire vaccine schedule in america was there

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:49.920
and may still be there in the masses in the in the people as they question the entire narrative

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:55.440
they're ready to hear that you know what we're not even sure if the way that they've done the

01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.080
vaccine schedule in america is really that kosher anymore and for sure they pushed it too early

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:08.480
and for sure they put too many shots on it and it's pretty easy to show you the vaccine schedule

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.640
in the Netherlands or the vaccine schedule in Norway and show you that there's quite a disparity here

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.320
and they're not overrun with any of these diseases in those countries so maybe we need to

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.960
think about it a little bit maybe this profit structure and this this indemnity liability

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:29.760
envelope extends farther into our lives than it should

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.080
and anyone worth listening to in my humble opinion that wants to believe

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.040
that they are one of these medical dissidents should already be here

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:48.560
because i didn't get here until the late 2022

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:57.120
and so i have no nothing but apologies to offer for how late i got here including to my daughter

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.640
and so in my humble opinion anybody that's not taking it this seriously that's not this disturbed

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:12.320
it's not this upset that's not this apologetic that's not this humble as i am right now

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:21.680
it needs to be pressured to to exhibit some humility the only way we get out of this is if not

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:28.800
if we say i told you so it's to really allow everybody to say holy cow i i i fell for it too

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:37.280
and if Brett Weinstein's not willing to say that he fell for it too in 2020 and 2021 but is fully

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:43.120
willing to grift on tucker Carlson as a person who did i have a problem with it

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.680
because he should be promoting robert f Kennedy jr for having seen through it and spoken on a

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:56.320
national and international forum about it in 2020 when he was still wearing a bandana on his show

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:04.560
and if you will recall correctly he recorded a podcast in 2021 with

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.960
bobby kennedy and didn't release it until 2023

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:19.520
not really playing totally fair i bet what bobby said in november of 2021 on his podcast was

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.400
worth playing in november of 2021 but he didn't

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.520
these are things that when you line them up like this and they all line up like that you can't ignore

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:41.280
it if stonehenge lines up to the equinox well then it's pretty weird right

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.960
if you look back at this track record and he fits the profile for someone who was wittingly or

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:56.400
unwittingly put in front of us to see the worst case scenario narrative then it would be a good

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.840
person to put pressure on for him to realize that and maybe apologize for it and maybe roll back

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.600
the cameras to 2020 so that we could all see that we were fooled by mass casualty events that

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:15.520
were misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen but we've got to erase 2020 we've got to forget

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:21.440
about who spoke at that we've got to not say anything about that it's got to start around 2021

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.880
when steve kirsch and robert malone came on his podcast and came out for the first time and

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:35.600
established this narrative which was really uh that between vaccines and and ivermectin we

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.960
could all hang out without masks and that zero covid was still possible and should be a goal

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.160
and that novel combinations of pre-existing drugs could be useful ways to make money off of the

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:56.480
pandemic when you see it clearly it is really really something that we can actually break free

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:04.480
from and these people could help us you say safe you're not uh if i say

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.400
i drove home drunk um but i made it without harm so it was safe you know that i have said

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:13.600
something for it yes and in this case even if the thing had turned out to be harmless nobody

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:16.480
could know that it was so it wasn't safe and for them to assure us that it was was alive from the

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:20.000
get-go that's what caused heather and me to start looking into it and the deeper we dug the crazier

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.600
the story got not safe and ineffective in fact harmful and shockingly ineffective at everything

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:31.200
that you might want it to be effective at um so the story is uh an odd one the fact that that

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.240
small number of dissidents was able to upend the narrative was able to bring people's awareness

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:41.920
to the massive levels of harmony and effectiveness of the shots is in some ways um the most too late

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:50.080
too late most of the people took the shots most of the vulnerable people took two my friends took

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:55.920
two my dead friend took two plus a booster his whole family's boosted

01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.720
who did you save?

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:07.280
surprising element of the story and i think it truly surprised um bobby could have saved somebody

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.520
by speaking out and talking about the lockdowns and then having somebody like me stumble upon

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:21.520
the movie vaxxed and finally have my spell broken bobby could have saved people by speaking out

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:27.120
in germany when he did bobby could have saved people with his with his social media and with with

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:38.320
what they were doing at that time not him wearing a bandana not him advocating for not really going

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:43.280
to people's houses for christmas this year because we're not doing it either that didn't save anybody

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:52.480
in fact that allowed the novel protocols to be used the novel protocols to seem relevant the

01:59:52.480 --> 02:00:00.160
novel stories about a novel spreading virus to seem real and i'm not saying that i didn't help

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:07.920
with that too but in 2020 i was saying that whatever it is that's spreading around it's better for

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.440
us to take it on our own than it is to take a transfection for it

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:18.800
and it might help some of the people that have already taken it but no one should be taking it

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.240
if they're healthy that was my that was my message

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:30.080
and i was still confused in 2021 i fully admit it because i was taken by these people

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:38.960
because these people in 2020 and 2021 didn't see through it because all the people in drastic

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:46.640
did not see through it in fact they were hyper focused on it the people that i was streaming

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:52.160
with at the time in 2020 and streaming about me and having my links on their website those people

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:56.320
were all fully in on worst case scenario just like Brett

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:06.640
and so i apologize for being fooled but the but the ruse was powerful

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:17.760
pharma and its partners in social media and government and on governmental organizations

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.600
i think they thought that they owned enough of the media that they could sell us any narrative

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:28.080
that they wished and i think surprising as it is they didn't really understand that podcasts could

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.040
possibly be a countervailing force of significance if you own nbc news it's enough you would say

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.320
all right you know it's it's it's failing to update from the buying by the barrel

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:41.280
it's totally aphorism um so so what he wants you to actually believe is that podcasts save the world

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:46.480
that podcasts weren't used to see the worst case scenario he wants you to believe that podcasts

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.400
are result are the thing that flipped the narrative that cracked the code and that's

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:59.440
totally wrong what i'm trying to tell you is the scooby doo was seeded by podcasts like

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:04.320
joe rogan and brett weinstein and eric weinstein and all these other ones that go underneath it right

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:12.240
down to tim pool and sam cedar who all had their hair on fire about the wrong questions for four

02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:16.480
years and still have their hair on fire about the wrong questions in the fifth year

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:28.000
it's only because i learned the biology that i could see through the lies otherwise the

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:36.880
lies seem logical and normal when so many people agree on both sides but what happened was it turned

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.200
out that a number of us were willing to make mistakes and correct them in real time to talk

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.760
about this in plain english with the public um to do so you know and joe rogan's man cave

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.600
and the fact is people listened because of course this was on everybody's mind and what they were

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.560
supposed to do to protect you know they've been terrified and they what to do to protect your

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:56.160
family's health was a question that everybody wanted to know the answer to so our ability to

02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:00.080
reach millions of people surprised those who thought they were just going to show this narrative down

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:06.400
our throats and this gets me to the the who the world health organization and its pandemic prepared

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:13.040
uh plan modifications what i believe is going on is the world health organization is now revising

02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:18.000
the structures that allowed the dissidents to up end the narrative and they are looking for

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.480
rematch i think um what they want are the measures that would have allowed them to silence the

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:28.960
podcasters to mandate uh various things internationally in a way that would prevent the emergence of a

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:33.440
control group that would allow us to see harms clearly um so that's the reason that i think

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:37.920
people as much as they want to move on from thinking about covid maybe stop thinking about covid but

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:42.880
do start thinking about what has taken place with respect to medicine with respect to public health

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.840
with respect to pharma and ask yourself the question given what you now know would you want to relive

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.080
a pandemic like the covid pandemic without the tools that allowed you to ultimately in the

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.120
end see clearly that it didn't make sense to take another one of these shots or to have your kids

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.920
taken right we want those tools in fact we need them and um something is quietly moving just out

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.720
of sight in order that we will not have access to them the next time we face a serious emergency

02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.160
so you're saying that an international health organization could you stand the first amendment

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.440
in the united states yes and in fact um as much as this sounds i know that it sounds per cost

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:19.120
but it does not sound preposter so the ability to do it is currently under discussion at the

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:25.600
international level and it's almost impossible to exaggerate how troubling what is being discussed

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:32.080
is in fact i think it is fair to say that we are in the middle of a coup that we are actually

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:39.200
facing the elimination of our national and our personal sovereignty and that that is the purpose

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:44.640
of what is being constructed that it has been written in such a way that your eyes are supposed

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:50.720
to glaze over as you attempt to sort out what is it what is under discussion and if you do that

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.640
then come may of this year your nation is almost certain to sign on to an agreement that in some

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.440
utterly vaguely described future circumstance a public health emergency which the director general

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:06.080
of the world health organization has total liberty to define in any way that he sees fit in other

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:11.040
words nothing prevents i think one of the things that i see in the chat that really is true is that

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:17.920
the main tool we didn't need was a mask masks did horrible damage and we've watched a few videos

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:23.520
with the guy named steve hat fill from early 2020 where he was talking about how masks need

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:27.520
to be normalized even for children by masking Barney the dinosaur

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.840
Brett Weinstein did not question masks and had a bandana around his neck all the time in his

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:42.640
podcast and advocated for it i did not have the guts to stand up against the masking mandate for

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:48.560
my children i didn't have the the where the you can't ask your kids to stand up against

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:54.880
something like that in schools with with teachers and stuff especially not if it's not their own

02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:02.080
idea and my kids even wore masks to play in band with like holes in the front for for the instrument

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:11.440
to come out made by the instrument companies and so we cannot forget 2020 because it was a full year

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:15.760
of shenanigans that this guy and other people did not speak out against

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:23.360
don't you understand that this this mask right here and the videos the hours of videos

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:30.080
from 2020 where Brett Weinstein has a bandana around his neck are all tied together

02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:36.720
they're all evidence that this is not the hero that we are looking for it's certainly not the

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:43.040
hero he represents himself as he should at least be humble enough to admit that he was fully taken

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:51.120
in 2020 and didn't speak up early enough and had he spent spoken up early enough he might have

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:55.680
saved some college kids from taking the shots in order to go to parties

02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:07.040
this is crucial to understand that there were infinitely more people to save in 2020 than

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:13.760
there were in 2021 and even less in 2022 even less in 2024 where we are now

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.560
unless you go to the heart of the matter which is the existing vaccine schedule that's still

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:28.320
rolling on and expanding into old people how far is he going to go questioning that are we really

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.640
only going to question the covid shots you know there are sv shots out there now and

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:38.480
pneumonia shots out there now and sickle cell anemia treatments out there now that are i mean come on

02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:44.800
guys i'm going to change from being declared a public health emergency that would trigger the

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.480
provisions of these modifications and in the case that some emergency or some pretense of an emergency

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:55.040
shows up the provisions that would kick so why would we worry about the who and we could just

02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:00.880
change the prep act and get out of the who entirely why worry about what who the decision is who's

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:06.000
making what is his what is his argument here should we dispel the seed dismiss the cdc

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:14.000
should we get rid of the prep act should we install uh strict liability to all pharmaceutical products

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:21.520
should we get rid of the 1986 vaccine act what's his solution for the problem of the who should we

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:29.120
get out of the who treaty because there are a lot of things that are inside of the united states

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:33.920
controlled by united states people and united states voters that could be changed that would

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:41.520
supersede our allegiance to the who presumably making a bunch of fuss about the who when we

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.760
should be trying to change laws in the united states to make the who irrelevant don't you think

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.000
or am i just an idiot tell me i'm an idiot in the chat and then what we should be doing instead

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.280
that would be great can are um beyond john dropper so before you get into it and i just want to thank

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.320
you by the way for taking the time to go through this proposal because you're absolutely right

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.880
it's it's impenetrable it's designed to be to cloak what they're saying rather than limited um what's

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.280
it called well the funny thing is actually i was looking um this morning to find out what

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:14.720
the current name is and the names have actually been shifted slightly clearly a feature oh it's a

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:21.200
shape shifting yeah it it so what i would do in order and and i it's unclear to me how much that's

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.960
just simply designed to confuse somebody who tries to sort it out and how much that's designed to

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:30.240
for example um game the search engine technology that might allow you to crack the changes because

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:35.760
to the extent of the name has shifted um so i call it the um world health organization pandemic

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:42.080
preparedness plan right and what is under discussion uh are some modifications to the global

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:47.280
public health regulations and modifications to an existing treaty but all of this makes it sound

02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:53.920
minor and procedural what has been proposed are uh and again the number of things included here

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:57.280
is incredible it's hard even for those of us who have been focused on this to track all of the

02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.040
important things under discussion and to deduce the meaning of some of the more subtle provisions but

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.840
they uh the world health organization and its signatory nations will um be allowed to define

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:14.560
a public health emergency uh any basis that having declared one they will be entitled to

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:22.960
mandate remedies the remedies that are named include um vaccines gene therapy technology is

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:27.760
literally named in uh the set of things that the world health organization is going to reserve

02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:32.880
the right to mandate um that it will be in a position to um require these things of citizens

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:38.240
that it will be in a position to uh dictate our ability to travel in other words passports that

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:44.960
would be predicated on one having accepted uh these technologies are um clearly being described

02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.760
it would have the ability to forbid the use of other medications so this looks like they're

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:53.760
preparing for a rerun where they can just simply take iromactin hydroxychloroquine off the table

02:10:54.240 --> 02:11:01.920
um they also have reserved the ability to dictate how these uh measures are discussed

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.320
that censorship is described here as well the right to dictate that's that of course misinformation

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.920
is how they're going to describe it well in fact when asked we pause and play a sound bite from

02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:14.400
Tedros um in which he alluded to this and i want to get your assessment here we continue to see

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:19.680
misinformation on social media and in mainstream media about the pandemic accord that countries

02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:25.040
are now negotiating the claim that the accord will see power to WHO is quite simply false

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:30.640
it's fact news countries will decide what the accord says and countries alone and countries will

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:36.880
implement the accord in line with their own national laws no country will see any sovereignty to WHO

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:42.400
if any politician business person or anyone at all is confused about what the pandemic accord is

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.080
and isn't we would be more than happy to discuss it and explain it so he's gonna be more than happy

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.160
to discuss and explain the misinformation that you're yeah that is no spreading that is comforting

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:57.840
um well on the one hand i must i had not seen that and um it is tremendously good news actually

02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.840
what it means is that once again we have managed to raise awareness of something in time that

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:06.960
there is uh conceivably a better out how does it matter whether it's legally

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:16.240
obligating to follow the edicts of the who or if the public health apparatus that we have in our

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:21.760
country is voluntarily going to follow the who if the who declares a pandemic

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:30.960
are you making it are you making these organizations like the cdc and the fda to have a uh a viable

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:37.440
excuse why they have to do it are you trying to take away the blame from the fact that those are

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:43.520
american organizations filled with americans that can all make american decisions they're not robots

02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:50.000
that the congress could take away funding could take away power could just write them out

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:56.000
that we could get rid of the prep act so that the entire health and human services part of the

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:03.040
of the executive branch can never declare an emergency again and so then with the who declares

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.600
an emergency we don't have a legislative mechanism by which to do it so it won't matter

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:13.120
and those are all things that are accessible within our own system we don't need to have

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:18.480
anybody at the who we don't need to fund the who we can just get out we can change our laws we can

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:25.360
say thanks very much for playing have a nice day but instead we're seeming to be told we don't

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.600
have much choice and what we have to accept and we have a very limited spectrum of debate in terms

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:38.160
of discussion about what can be done to stop it but it's a very lively discussion a very lively

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:43.520
discussion i'm still available to us there's books enough to bother live there's there's

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.160
you couldn't have said it more accurately yes those were clearly lies and of course his saying

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:52.400
that into a camera is supposed to convince you you know nobody could possibly lie so directly so

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.440
there must be some truth in what he's saying which is of course nonsense and anybody who goes back to

02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.400
you uh an awful as compendium of various things that people have said into cameras over the course

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.320
of covid that they then swear they didn't say you know months later um knows that these folks

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.280
are very comfortable at saying totally false things into a camera it doesn't cause them to

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:12.000
to think twice or sweat or anything um but it's great that we have managed to raise enough awareness

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.440
that Tedros is actually addressing uh our spreading of what it actually is is malinformation um you're

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:21.600
aware of this uh the distinction no yeah oh it's beautiful so i was i was i'm so old that i was

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.760
still stuck in the truth or falsehood binary yeah where what mattered was whether it was true or

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.400
no no no the malinformation is actually exactly what you need to know about to see um how antiquated

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.000
that notion is because um this was actually the department of homeland security actually issued

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.680
a memo um in which it defined three kinds of i think not terrorism misdiss and malinformation

02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:44.560
misinformation our errors uh disinformation our intentional errors lies and malinformation

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.280
are things that are based in truth but cause you to distrust authority

02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.760
he's been casting this spell for quite some time on his podcast repeating these definitions

02:14:54.320 --> 02:15:01.440
reciting them rewording them and so this is just in a continuation of that ongoing enchantment

02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:06.640
for everybody to accept that these terms exist and to have to compartmentalize your thoughts

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.520
into these compartments to make it even harder for you to process reality it's an enchantment

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:18.000
that you can just ignore there's only truth in lies oh information is what you commit when you

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.480
catch the blind yes um exactly um yeah it is discussing the lies of your your government

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:25.360
is malinformation and therefore a kind of terrorism which i should point out as funny as that is and

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.600
as obviously Orwellian as that is it's also terrifying because if you have tracked the history of the

02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.360
spreading tyranny from the beginning of the war on terror you know the terrorism is not a normal

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.000
english word the way it once was terrorism is now a legal designation that causes all of your

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.600
rights to evaporate so at the point of the department of homeland security says that you are guilty

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.400
of a kind of terrorism for saying true things that cause you to distrust your government they're

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.880
also telling you something about what rights they have to silence you they're not normal rights so

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:55.520
these things are all terrifying and i do think as much as my jaws open the the covid pandemic

02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.000
caused us to become aware of a lot of structures that had been built around us something that

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.600
former nsa officer william beanie once described as the turnkey totalitarian state the totalitarian

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:10.400
state is erected around you but it's not activated and then once it's built the key gets turned and so

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.920
we are now seeing i believe something that even out strips william beanie's description because

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.760
it's the turnkey totalitarian planet right the world health organization is above the level of

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.160
nations and it's going to be in a position if these provisions pass to dictate to nations how

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.840
they are to treat their own citizens to override their constitutions despite what teddress has

02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:31.440
told you um so that is we don't need to surrender to that not apparently about health what i think

02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:40.640
has happened is the fact of a possible pandemic causes a loophole in the mind it's not a loophole

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.160
in our governance documents our constitution doesn't describe exemptions from your rights during

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:48.960
time of a pandemic emergency your rights simply are what they are and they're not supposed to go

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:55.920
anywhere just because there's a disease spreading but nonetheless people's willingness to accept

02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.800
the erosion of their rights because of a public health emergency um has allowed this tyranny to

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:07.440
to use it as a Trojan horse yes and i think that's also it's something people need to become aware of

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:13.440
that uh there are a number of features of our environment that are um basically they are blind

02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.960
spots that we can't see past the vaccine was one and i know i wasn't an enthusiast about vaccines

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.400
i still believe deeply in the elegance of vaccines as they should exist but i'm now very alarmed at

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:27.920
how they are produced and i'm even more alarmed at what has been called a vaccine that doesn't

02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:33.200
meet the definition right that because many of us believe that vaccines were an extremely elegant

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.960
low harm high efficacy method of preventing disease when they called this mRNA technology

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:45.360
a vaccine many of us um gave it more credibility than we should have if they had called it a gene

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.360
transfection technology we would have thought wait what you know that that's that sounds highly

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:52.240
novel and it sounds dangerous and how much do we know about the long-term implications but because

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.320
they called it a vaccine people were much readily much much more willing to to extend so the vaccines

02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:04.160
are fine the vaccine schedule is fine and as i told you before now you can see why he's not a

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:11.440
genuinely intellectually progressing person you can't have bobby kennedy in your house

02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:18.080
for for a he had him in his house in person interview in 2021 you can't talk to him about

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:25.040
vaccines and think well vaccines are still a miracle best thing sent the wheel and airplanes

02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:32.000
you have to have some question and then he had three years two more years to research what bobby

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:38.640
told him took him 14 months to show the podcast and apparently he still hasn't figured out

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.520
that the vaccine schedule in america is at least sketchy compared to other vaccine schedules

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.920
even if you want to believe that at the heart of it there's some kind of functional

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.600
therapeutic that actually has some general benefit for the kids it prevents them from getting certain

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:59.600
diseases the way that they are applied in america the earliest and the frequency is obviously wrong

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:08.240
any biologist would see that and you don't have to come to the conclusion that the vaccine

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.440
schedule is wholly criminal to think that i'm not even asking him to think that

02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:20.320
even though that's what i think i'm just asking him to question the vaccine schedule in general

02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:25.760
as part of this public health apparatus that apparently he's so sure is criminal at least

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:27.760
the covid part and the pandemic part

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:38.080
this is the exact way that the past will be forgotten the erasure will be forgotten

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:44.640
and the lie will become the truth it's exactly the way it's going to happen we must wake up now

02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.960
accept it public health function is the same way um if you think about it public health

02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:55.920
and step back a second your relationship with your doctor your personal health uh

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:59.200
ought to be very important to you but there are ways in which things that happen at a

02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.000
population level affect your personal health and your doctor's not in position to do anything

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.600
about it so somebody dumping pollution into a stream from which you're pulling fish you know

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:09.120
you might detect the harm at the population level you might need a regulation at a population level

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:12.160
in order to protect you your doctor's not in position when you have pills or correct it so

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:16.160
the idea that public health is potentially a place to improve all of our well-being is real

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:20.080
but once you decide that there's something above doctors relative to your health then that can

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:26.160
be an excuse for all manner of tyranny public health has been um adopted it's like uh it's like

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:30.400
the sheep's clothing that has allowed the wolf to go after our rights because in theory it's

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:32.960
trying to protect us from harms that we would like to be protected and it generates such

02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:38.080
fear it's a huge scale and so they're they're questioning public health and they're anti-vax

02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:45.280
as long as they're not anti-vax they're anti-covid vax but not anti-vax and that's okay that's the

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:49.120
dance they're going to do that's the dance they're all allowed to do

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.440
I think that's the dance that that Bobby Kennedy has very cleverly done for the last several years

02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:02.560
where he doesn't say that the vaccine schedule should be bad or good he wants it tested and I

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:07.200
think he knows fully well that when it's tested of course if the results are going to be devastatingly

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:14.400
bad for vaccine efficacy and for vaccine advocates like Brett Weinstein and his wife and it will be

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:21.200
proven that these things are at best uh poisonous placebos toxic placebos

02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:29.600
with not a uniform set of toxic possibilities because of the whole compounding nature of our

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:35.200
biology and the absurdity of trying to augment the immune system with any combination of substances

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:42.160
injected intramuscularly I don't think we need to watch any more of this I'll watch some more of

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.640
it later and see if anything relevant in the last 15 minutes is there I'll make another show tomorrow

02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:54.560
I'm going to be online a lot in the next few weeks or so I think barring any I'm not going to make

02:21:54.560 --> 02:22:02.160
any promises for streaks don't forget that this is where we are right we are we are at year five

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:08.560
of an ongoing RNA viral pandemic according to the TV and it's still evolving and in fact

02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:16.480
not only is it still evolving but with the gene told very very alarming because the mutations

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:24.960
are no longer restricted to spike root it is evolving and jn1 is very dangerous especially

02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:31.200
in highly vaccinated countries so we could see another wave of giant spread and all kinds of

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:36.720
sick people and we're being told that by somebody who used to work for sepe and govi and billamill

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:42.640
indicates foundation in his design vaccine since he became a veterinarian and has no way

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:48.960
and no way shape or form ever going to question the possibilities that deaths due to protocols

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:54.960
and deaths due to lies are going to outweigh the deaths due to the novel virus that's still

02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:00.640
circulating because his whole career is based on the idea that RNA viruses can circulate for years

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:08.480
and so like it or not we're on this road and every time we get picked up by a car and think

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:13.520
okay now this person knows what they're talking about they don't they can't summarize the whole

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:20.720
picture they can't tell you exactly how bad it is that we were fooled by how many people

02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:26.160
and what the real motivations are they can only tell you that bears is obviously something we

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:31.280
got to pay attention to and the spike proteins got all these different things involved in it

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:39.200
and the variants are oh my gosh are they interesting just like the fear and cleavage site was super

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:44.960
interesting for a year and a half that we don't talk about it anymore he had 2020 and 2021 we're

02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:50.720
almost exclusively debating the spike protein and its fear and cleavage site and what that meant

02:23:51.200 --> 02:24:01.120
and that all happened before Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch courageously came out on Brett

02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:07.760
Weinstein's podcast to announce that we didn't need to use masks if we were double vaccinated or

02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:12.400
had the super secret formula for ivermectin treatment prophylactically

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:21.440
Welcome to the new world order ladies and gentlemen where podcasts are used to

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:29.680
close the limited spectrum of debate and podcasts are where the lively discussion within the

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:38.400
spectrum of debate that encases us in the presuppositions of the system that's why new world order

02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.760
with the bats is just perfect that's where they want my children to be and your children to be

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:52.080
and we cannot let them we just simply cannot it has to be the goal of every parent that's alive

02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:58.000
right now to make sure that their children are not caught up in this new world order mythology

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:05.280
about pandemic viruses and about ever evolving vaccine technology

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.200
and we have to do it before the lie becomes the truth it's already the truth on television ladies

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:17.440
and gentlemen it's already the truth on social media it's just not the truth in everyone's head yet

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:25.920
one way to do it would be to talk about the illusion of the infectious cycle the crazy cartoons of the

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:33.440
infectious cycle and to talk about the analogy of tapes versus CDs for the replication of RNA

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:39.920
so that people can start to understand that a story about an RNA that can go around the world

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:47.760
from a mud puddle or from an uncleaned up spill underneath a raccoon dog's cage in a live animal

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:54.000
market and circulate the globe for five years and now being the dominant variant JN1

02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.280
that we got because we vaccinated too many people in a pandemic according to

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:06.560
so for many many years now if not decades they have been short cutting this problem and taking these

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:12.640
signatures of RNA that they support to find in the wild and translating them into DNA for all we

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:20.640
know they're just running experiments on bio bioweapons technologies and calling it a wild virus

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:29.200
because they have the technology to make these DNA constructs they have the technology to make

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:36.400
the technology to put these cDNA equivalents of RNAs into plasmids and grow quantities of them

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:41.600
in bacterial culture we know they can do that because this is the same procedure that was used

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.640
to generate all of the spike protein for spike backs all of the spike protein for enovial all

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:51.920
the spike protein for for all of these things all the mRNA was made this way

02:26:52.800 --> 02:27:02.400
and you can get that RNA by combining this DNA plasmids with an RNA polymerase in cell

02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:08.160
culture or in electroporation methods to get that RNA out once you have that RNA it will be the

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:13.840
purest form of viral RNA that anyone can create you can't create this pure form by putting a

02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:19.200
patient sample on a cell culture you can't create this pure form by putting a patient sample in a

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:26.000
mouse and you can't store a patient sample and then create more pure form from it

02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:31.840
the only way you can do all of those things is with a DNA clone and generate the RNA from it

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:37.680
that's the only way that you can make industrial quantities of an RNA it's the only way that such

02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:45.360
a uniform RNA signal could possibly have been real around the world maybe it wasn't maybe it was

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:49.920
but the only way that it could be is with this technology and all of these people know

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:54.400
it's the biology that's very easy for them to ignore

02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:03.120
and even the ones in this picture that do know it are very hesitant to try and explain it very

02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:09.440
hesitant to bring it up and certainly very hesitant to say that i'm the one who taught

02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:13.120
him that biology i'm the one who convinced him that it was right i'm the one who convinced him

02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:19.680
that the scooby-doo was happening and how thorough it could be despite the efforts of everyone in

02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:25.600
the worst case scenario team and despite the efforts that were i think some of the people who were

02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:30.640
pushing the no virus narrative were doing it in such a way that made it harder for us to come to

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:38.000
this conclusion that's what i think and i'm going to keep saying it because these people were rude

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:43.200
and it's not all of them were Alex Zeck was a pretty cool guy

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:52.560
so here we are faith in a novel virus too it's still trapped in it and our children are the ones

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:56.640
that need rescuing we don't care about these adults we care about our children we care about

02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:01.520
college kids we need to rescue them now and the people who can rescue them are doctors

02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:08.320
people who are can rescue them are people with academic positions that didn't wake up until

02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:12.720
recently could now start speaking up academic biologists could now start speaking up if they

02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:19.440
just watch my show and realize holy man was i dumb wouldn't that be great wouldn't that be great if

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:23.680
people could get to realize that we don't know anything about the background before 2020 what

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:29.040
if they were lying to us what if they were lying to us they didn't even use nested primers

02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:39.040
i use the train analogy because of that that mime thing but i use the train analogy because once

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:42.480
the train leaves the station with our kids we're not going to be able to get them off the train

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:49.840
once they leave the house and go to college and buy into the testing to go to parties

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:58.480
and wearing masks in class and different codes of levels of infection on on campus they're already

02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:04.400
on the train and they're accepting the vaccine schedule for their kids and they're accepting

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:08.960
registering their kids genetics and medical data for the NIH because it's what we do together we're

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:18.240
all of one this is the way out advocate for the pause really the end of the modern vaccination

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.120
schedule in america and we can end it by requiring strict liability that'll already

02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:31.280
end it all by itself but investigate the use of deadly protocols to orchestrate this investigate

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:37.280
the use of normal molecular biological tools to seed the molecular biological signal that was

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:44.080
misconstrued as a has a pandemic take back the sovereignty of your family and take back our country

02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:52.640
from the who and the and the cdc and the un and how to see the medlers is to see that none of them

02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:58.400
will ever question the vaccine schedule they won't do it for the next three years they also won't

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:03.200
ever use the word strict liability for all pharmaceutical products because it's that's too easy that

02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:08.640
explains it to a gas station attendant and that gas station attendant can repeat it to their

02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:13.920
lawyer friend and the lawyer friend will go whoa where did you learn those words strict liability

02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:18.960
for all pharmaceutical products fixed is this problem and if we would they would use the word

02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:26.000
transfection before now in 2024 they might have saved a whole hell of a lot of lives they were

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:36.640
here in me and lit reading me use the word transfection in 2020 and I didn't figure out the word clone

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:43.200
until 2022 but boy did that send everybody to bat shit crazy world that's really when all these

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:48.720
people exposed themselves for who they were how nuts all of the people went even some of the good

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:55.920
guys like people who worked for the human genome project were totally into the dissident movement

02:31:55.920 --> 02:32:00.000
and helping everybody forward suddenly freaked out and blocked me on twitter because I explained

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.120
that clones are the only way this could have been done it's the only way coronavirus biology is done

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:14.400
they attack me instead of talking about my ideas and they are unable to summarize across the

02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.760
entire show and in fact they don't want to talk about 2020 or 2021 at all that's how you can see

02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:22.960
who's at at work and who's really fighting

02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:33.840
ladies and gentlemen we are at a time point when genetic diversity is at a peak as far

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:38.720
as their plan goes and they want to sample it they want to sample your kids and your grandkids

02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:45.920
this is their last 30 years it's a multi-generational war they don't care about us they care about our

02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:52.560
kids and my kids still go to a school where all the teachers believe and most of the parents believe

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:59.760
and a lot of them are still testing so maybe we've got to advocate for stop testing as well

02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:05.760
I don't know what we can do about it other than stand up for the people who stood up in 2020

02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:15.120
I think that's our best bet and so if if Bobby Kennedy gets a bunch of things wrong I you know

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:21.680
that's the way politics is that's the way imperfect candidates are but in 2020 he got that right

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:30.560
and there are a lot of people who got it right in 2020 that people are still ignoring and instead

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:36.080
people like Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone and all these other people have

02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:41.520
been soaking up the spotlight doing world tours having big meetings in Romania

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:50.480
while the show keeps going on ladies and gentlemen stop transfections and healthy humans because

02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.000
they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.840
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.640
immune system is dumb transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.240
not patterned integrity I love you all very much we have a new record for the number of people

02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:16.000
showing up at this show please share my work as often as as widely as you can if you can afford

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:19.840
please subscribe to the channel I need all the financial support that I can get

02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:27.200
just because I want to try and extend this and push this out farther and put more and more work

02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:33.280
into it in order to justify that to everybody in my life I need to I need to be able to move

02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:40.800
forward so hopefully everybody out there that wants to is helping and everybody that can is

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:46.960
sharing that's all I can really say the people that are subscribing right now at least the last

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:51.120
list that I made is right here there probably have been a few people in the last couple days

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.960
but things have been really busy and we had a game today and we have a game tomorrow so I don't

02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:59.440
know if I'm gonna be able to update this until Monday but I will again thanks to everybody a

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:06.400
special shout out to Greg James one of my all-time most important supporters and somebody who's been

02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:12.320
more than generous with my family and my work come in supporting it and continues to be that way

02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:18.320
thanks very much everybody for joining me and I will see you again tomorrow and Sunday

02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:22.400
we have a game that too so it'll probably be around the same time right before right after dinner

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:27.360
thanks very much and that's it this is the website I'll see you guys

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:45.840
yeah I don't know what to say other than I'm going to start putting them on rumble regularly

02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:52.160
now it'll be the replays but I fix something in my thing please leave a voicemail if you've got a

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:57.760
question or something like that that I miss in the chat and again if you can afford to become a

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:04.080
regular subscriber a producer or an annual collaborator that would just be absolutely fantastic because

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:10.400
if this program can become independent it will be an almost unstoppable force and so

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:22.000
I really want that be well see you tomorrow
