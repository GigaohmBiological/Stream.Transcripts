00:38.648 --> 00:39.488
Testing one, two.

00:39.548 --> 00:40.769
Test one, two.

00:40.889 --> 00:41.930
Testing one, two.

00:43.030 --> 00:43.631
Test one, two.

00:52.406 --> 00:54.107
My name is Dr. Andrew Molden.

00:54.607 --> 00:57.548
I'm an MD-PhD physician scientist here in Canada.

00:58.289 --> 01:10.275
And July 1st of last year, 2008, I took all these years of my academic training and realized that the system within which I'm working is causing more harm than good.

01:10.775 --> 01:19.359
And I realized this training I could no longer use to go out and provide the health care that I've been trained to do.

01:22.219 --> 01:27.942
because I recognize the means by which we are doing it as causing more harm than good.

01:29.002 --> 01:37.047
Western-based medical practices is now the number one cause of death and disease amongst our population, and all the physicians know this.

01:37.947 --> 01:40.088
My background training has been quite eclectic.

01:40.629 --> 02:06.625
I attended six different academic institutions and universities across Canada, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Research Council of Canada Scholar, Ontario Mental Health Foundation Scholar, Ontario Graduate Scholar, 27 awards for academic and research excellence over the course of all these years of academia to arrive at the point where I truly was seeking to help understand what causes disease.

02:07.345 --> 02:11.906
So consider the analogy by a car dealer analogy.

02:12.646 --> 02:19.648
Say, for example, your grandmother who develops cancer and she ends up passing away despite the best efforts of Western medicine.

02:20.228 --> 02:22.749
You will say that it's unfortunate for grandma.

02:23.089 --> 02:24.890
We did all that Western medicine could do.

02:25.650 --> 02:33.012
You did the cut, the surgery, you did the burn, the radiotherapy, and you did the poison, the drugs, and she still did not survive.

02:33.852 --> 02:36.353
But then you can walk away figuring that you did all that you could.

02:36.833 --> 02:37.693
But did you really?

02:37.713 --> 02:45.977
Because what has evolved here is kind of like car sales relative to monopolizing the medical model that we have.

02:46.957 --> 02:49.298
So you have many different people out there who sell cars.

02:49.758 --> 02:57.401
You can drive down a street, you can see Chrysler dealer on one side, a Saturn on another, a Ford on this side, a Chevrolet on the other side, and you have all these options.

02:58.121 --> 03:05.410
And options are good in society because you can choose which option best fits your style and your choice and your driving needs.

03:05.971 --> 03:13.199
But when the healthcare system over the course of the last hundred years or so has become progressively and progressively more monopolized,

03:13.700 --> 03:20.403
The American Medical Association, in league with the Pharmaceutical Advertising Board, has serially taken out its competition.

03:20.884 --> 03:29.368
Eclectics, herbologists, naturopaths, chiropractors, they've all been single-handedly targeted by this system, which now has you driving down the streets.

03:29.768 --> 03:32.910
And all you have a choice of buying today are Mustangs.

03:33.510 --> 03:42.915
And when you only can buy a Mustang and you don't have access or paid access to these alternatives, then all you really know is that Mustangs is all you ever have to go

03:43.715 --> 03:44.416
solve your problems.

03:44.456 --> 03:50.881
But if you take that Mustang four-wheeling and you come back and it starts falling apart, you'll say, oh, well, it's too bad.

03:50.901 --> 03:53.703
I did all that I could with my Mustang, but it fell apart.

03:54.063 --> 04:02.450
That's no different from the analogy with your grandmother who passed away because all you knew is that you had asked us Mustangs and you gave a Mustang when you needed an SUV.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.993
And when they take all the SUVs away, you never know what you're missing.

04:06.053 --> 04:07.574
So this is where you've ended up at.

04:07.614 --> 04:08.635
And this is where we're headed.

04:09.275 --> 04:16.881
And this is a serious problem, because the right to choose what goes in your body, to direct your own health care, belongs to the citizens of the state.

04:17.201 --> 04:24.827
The state has no right, in the name of whatever sort of greater good they want to say, to dictate what goes into an individual's body.

04:24.907 --> 04:34.134
And that same logic rationale is what's made you all sick, because the state, by saying, in order to be a member of society, our science says you have to have these vaccines.

04:34.634 --> 04:43.059
Well now we've created for you conclusively to see that this whole science that they used was a lie across the planet for everybody, incontrovertible.

04:43.319 --> 04:54.925
They will sink them in court and now we have the evidence available for you to see for yourself and make your own conclusion because they have used science now as a method and a means to go tell you, leave the science to scientists.

05:10.086 --> 05:11.706
So I wanted to pause that there.

05:13.107 --> 05:15.487
I'm not totally happy with this.

05:17.508 --> 05:24.750
I'm not totally happy with this little interview here, this little, this thing that goes on with Dr. Andrew Molden.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.710
And I'll tell you why I'm not very happy with it.

05:28.591 --> 05:36.293
I'm not very happy with it because he's talking about the same stuff that these people that are in front of us now are talking about.

05:37.418 --> 05:40.661
How we can beat them in court, but not really saying how.

05:42.323 --> 05:46.447
And about how the mandates are the thing to worry about.

05:46.487 --> 05:47.908
They can't mandate it.

05:48.129 --> 05:49.210
It's our right.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.812
You can't mandate it.

05:51.953 --> 05:53.494
It's not the right fight.

05:54.515 --> 05:58.279
If these things have no value other than poison.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.067
And so it's weird, right?

06:01.268 --> 06:10.370
All those words that he used, all those words he used, he didn't say that intramuscular injection is just plain dumb and they lied to us about it.

06:10.751 --> 06:15.132
He did say that they have bad science and that they could win in court, but why?

06:16.704 --> 06:25.427
And I think that the strategy probably that will win, if we can convince our children of it, is that intramuscular injection is dumb.

06:26.108 --> 06:38.072
It's just as dumb as arguing for the correct, you know, amount of pressure on the head of a young child with a baseball bat is a good way to augment their immune system.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.314
Or their intelligence.

06:43.806 --> 06:46.948
or their ability to make good decisions.

06:49.129 --> 07:00.936
And yet somehow or another, we are talking about mandating these things and that mandating them is encroaching on our freedom and choice and how many different cars should I get to buy?

07:01.696 --> 07:02.697
It's not a car.

07:04.386 --> 07:08.809
It's not a good analogy if choice is what you're arguing for.

07:09.289 --> 07:14.293
As if, you know, the state's gonna pay for one kind of medicine, but not pay for another kind of medicine.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.333
That's not very fair.

07:15.794 --> 07:22.098
If one of them is not medicine by definition, someone should have said it by now.

07:22.238 --> 07:31.604
If this guy was saying this, almost exactly what CHD says in 2009, apparently he got killed by pharma.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.181
I know that a lot of people don't like this message.

07:38.261 --> 07:41.421
I don't know what to say other than I feel compelled to say it.

07:42.141 --> 07:44.642
Because no one else will say it.

07:44.682 --> 07:46.002
He could have been mistaken.

07:46.462 --> 07:47.763
He could have been meddled with.

07:48.223 --> 07:50.903
He could have just been doing his best.

07:50.983 --> 07:51.483
But this is 2009.

07:51.563 --> 07:54.224
This is 20 years ago.

07:55.424 --> 08:02.726
And between him and us are Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark and all these people who are in front of us now.

08:05.248 --> 08:09.370
as if they haven't been fumbling the ball for decades already.

08:13.372 --> 08:22.497
If Andrew Molden was able to say it like this in 2009, and we haven't gotten farther, it's a problem.

08:24.278 --> 08:29.360
And the resemblance of what he's saying to what they've said is kind of frightening to me.

08:31.021 --> 08:34.843
Because I've also not heard that much about Andrew Molden from any of these people.

08:39.554 --> 08:40.335
That's the reality.

08:56.863 --> 08:58.684
But there are videos, aren't there?

08:58.784 --> 09:02.506
Lots of videos are definitely available of Andrew Molden.

09:02.586 --> 09:10.170
So somehow or another, despite them thinking that his information was so dangerous, they killed him.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.131
There are videos of him out there still.

10:02.157 --> 10:03.398
Oops, that's the wrong one.

10:04.758 --> 10:06.399
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

10:06.419 --> 10:11.541
This is Giga Ohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:11.622 --> 10:13.622
Today is another New Biology 101.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.504
It is a discussion that builds on Wednesday's show.

10:17.524 --> 10:20.586
I apologize for missing the day yesterday.

10:21.546 --> 10:24.830
I will try to make up for it with a succinct presentation today.

10:24.910 --> 10:38.224
Life is a Pattern Integrity with a Trajectory Across Time is the idea that I want to put at the center of a new Biology 101 that I'd like to help you teach your kids and teach your family and friends if they are so willing to learn.

10:39.586 --> 10:47.712
In case you don't know who I am, my name is Jonathan Cooey and I come to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:49.053 --> 11:04.225
I am actually the unacknowledged source of most of the content that is posted by Panda and by this sub stack called Woodhouse76 that also seems to have some interesting dialogues with Claire Craig and with Pierre Cory.

11:04.745 --> 11:10.826
and also writes several articles with a guy by the name of Jonathan Engler.

11:11.046 --> 11:20.048
And most of the content of these articles are taken directly from streams that I've done or conversations and tweets that I've made.

11:20.528 --> 11:32.131
It's really kind of pathetic, but in a way you can predict now that they're gonna have to find their own material at this point because none of the new biology one is really gonna be coverable by them.

11:32.851 --> 11:34.593
I used to work for Children's Health Defense.

11:35.514 --> 11:39.098
My name is available on PubMed if you want to see what I did as an academic.

11:39.639 --> 11:46.646
I also helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, write the book The Wuhan Cover-Up.

11:47.367 --> 11:51.231
And I also became friends with the now NIH Director,

11:52.292 --> 11:54.074
Jayanta Bhattacharya.

11:55.114 --> 12:00.478
And so Dr. Jayanta is actually now trying to become Dr. Jay.

12:01.418 --> 12:02.139
But it's okay.

12:02.479 --> 12:10.525
I also have this really, probably my super fan is a guy in, he's a UK guy who claims to live in Japan.

12:10.565 --> 12:14.647
I'm not really sure where he lives, but his name is Kevin McCairn.

12:14.928 --> 12:17.930
And since the beginning of the pandemic, somebody's been paying him

12:18.630 --> 12:25.782
to follow me around and pay attention to what I'm doing, but really now with Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson and

12:27.992 --> 12:34.794
and Jessica Hockett regularly trying to take any and all useful ideas from the stream.

12:35.194 --> 12:39.195
It's really quite remarkable to watch the truth slowly leak out.

12:39.235 --> 12:46.257
But at this point, they're not going to be able to let anything else out because this is really, you know, the biology that breaks things.

12:46.637 --> 12:48.258
And I want to explain why that is.

12:49.807 --> 12:51.087
pretty succinctly today.

12:51.928 --> 13:01.811
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of Earth, and that explains why there is a fake anti-vaccine movement in America.

13:02.232 --> 13:11.775
If you are seeing me for the first time and you haven't heard that said, make sure you understand what I'm trying to say there with the idea of a fake anti-vaccine movement.

13:11.815 --> 13:13.316
The Trump administration

13:14.728 --> 13:36.028
used or was assisted by a fake anti-vaccine movement that was set up years earlier with people put in place in groups like ICANN and Children's Health Defense forming around this loosely organized group of angry moms that in reality was always a sabotaged movement.

13:37.099 --> 13:47.183
where they would get these little gatherings together and the really genuine people would also be able to present alongside these other less than genuine people.

13:47.243 --> 13:54.425
And those less than genuine people are the ones that are still pushing the exact same message they began with a decade ago.

13:55.546 --> 14:04.849
And again, that fake anti-vaccine movement is a crucial thing to understand if you want to get a grasp on the predicament that America is in right now.

14:06.437 --> 14:23.528
And reality, that anti-vaccine movement, that fake anti-vaccine movement, is primarily responsible for this illusion of consensus about a novel virus which killed millions of people but millions more were saved from and could come again because it was gain-of-function research.

14:24.048 --> 14:31.673
And that illusion of consensus exclusively rules out the idea that there's a loud background that they just used and misconstrued as spread.

14:32.782 --> 14:42.511
That anti-vaccine movement has one of its players at the head of Health and Human Services and another player at the head of NIH.

14:44.252 --> 14:45.854
America is in trouble.

14:46.134 --> 14:53.200
And if we as Americans can understand it, we might be able to extricate ourselves from the situation.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.001
That's the message.

14:55.782 --> 15:11.656
And the way to do it is to start to learn that we are trapped, essentially all of us, inside of a bad biology 101 that's so bad that you can teach it on the PBS NewsHour to people that have no interest in and have no special background in biology.

15:13.058 --> 15:15.920
The scary thing is, is they've been doing it to us since we were kids.

15:15.960 --> 15:21.025
They've been doing it to us in the first two minutes of every movie since who knows when.

15:23.951 --> 15:25.252
but we can think our way out.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.294
We can together seek the truth.

15:27.594 --> 15:33.999
It's gonna be hard though, because everybody's gonna have to swallow the pill of murder and lies.

15:34.019 --> 15:42.985
You're gonna have to accept the fact that this graph that's behind me is not possible without murder and lies, because we've had this under control.

15:43.985 --> 15:54.587
The only thing there is is an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was misconstrued as spread using very basic molecular biological techniques.

15:56.616 --> 16:07.782
So let's think our way out by replacing and putting over and putting the murder and lies behind us and learning a new biology 101 where life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

16:08.222 --> 16:24.931
And our children understand it so well that they start to get up every morning excited about optimizing their trajectory through time, excited about what they're going to use their, their 12 hours of waking time to do with their body and with their mind.

16:28.356 --> 16:36.320
Because this bad biology 101 evolution, because DNA takes us out of the equation, makes us the product of our genes.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.862
And you know, just a small portion of everything else comes from your bad parents or whatever.

16:42.242 --> 16:43.423
It's mostly systemic.

16:45.560 --> 17:00.088
And so the last couple days, a couple days ago, we talked first about these basic ideas, which again, as I said, are so stupid, complicated, or dumb simple, that they can be presented on PBS NewsHour and result in the enchantment of millions of people.

17:01.489 --> 17:03.210
DNA equals genes.

17:03.710 --> 17:12.996
Genes being a concept, a concept that was put forward in books, books that were written by people that you think are famous for other things.

17:14.619 --> 17:15.259
these books.

17:16.560 --> 17:28.587
And once DNA was found as a chemical, these people have gone on to assume that this means that all of their presuppositions are going to eventually also be edified by evidence.

17:29.467 --> 17:34.110
And we might as well move forward thinking that evolution is real, because we called it.

17:34.450 --> 17:35.891
We said there was going to be genes.

17:36.871 --> 17:39.393
Mendel's peas showed us there was going to be genes.

17:39.773 --> 17:41.054
And now we found DNA.

17:41.974 --> 17:43.275
You know, we win.

17:44.878 --> 17:45.819
But that's not right.

17:47.240 --> 17:56.426
And this has gone on over the course of the Human Genome Project to bamboozle everybody to think now we need to look for genes, because genes are what set us up for failure.

17:56.467 --> 17:59.709
Genes are what cause disease.

17:59.909 --> 18:04.953
And the small examples, the low-hanging fruit examples,

18:07.011 --> 18:24.065
where the encoding of a protein results in a phenotype that can be described as a disease, this means that their entire model of genes being consequent and primary to everything else is all based on a couple examples.

18:24.085 --> 18:30.810
You know, like, I don't know, what would we say, sickle cell anemia, or no, the better one would be the one that,

18:32.694 --> 18:37.456
that Tony Fauci, not Tony Fauci, Francis Collins is the guy, cystic fibrosis.

18:37.476 --> 18:37.996
How about that?

18:41.337 --> 18:52.181
And so genes code for proteins that then the whole thing starts to break down if you really think about it, because they don't have an explanation for how this is sufficient.

18:55.049 --> 19:00.132
How is it that we only need the code for proteins and then that's it, here we are?

19:00.312 --> 19:13.301
In other words, if we had all those proteins and whatever consequent, you know, ratios they were necessary, could we stir them up in a blender and then suddenly we would have a living person or a baby or even a developing embryo?

19:15.839 --> 19:22.821
And yet we are taught as young biologists all the way through college that DNA equals genes.

19:22.921 --> 19:24.661
Genes essentially cause disease.

19:24.701 --> 19:30.782
The examples being all the proteins that when they are not encoded correctly result in disease.

19:30.842 --> 19:38.864
And that means that we can go all the way back up there and say we understand evolution through mutation of genes, genes being proteins.

19:40.555 --> 19:48.001
but they haven't explained anything about the trajectory through time and how it occurs.

19:50.423 --> 19:54.065
Nothing, none of that information is available to us at all.

19:54.526 --> 20:02.231
And so instead, they just put it under this rubric called nurture, nature versus nurture.

20:02.592 --> 20:09.197
And since we have so much information about our nature and so many examples about how our nature, our genes,

20:10.515 --> 20:23.419
Even the use of the word nature versus nurture has been made to be dumb simple when we go so far as to call genes are the nature in nature versus nurtured.

20:24.159 --> 20:36.402
Joshua Lederberg never thought that way, but these oversimplifications have taken over our biology 101 and disarmed us as thinking and responsible adults since we were kids.

20:36.942 --> 20:38.143
So I'm gonna put those over there.

20:39.261 --> 20:43.223
make myself a little smaller, and just talk about some of the consequences here.

20:43.263 --> 20:45.924
So that means that most DNA is not even necessary.

20:45.964 --> 20:47.104
They think it's redundant.

20:47.745 --> 20:50.466
You know, it's ribosomal RNA, who cares about that?

20:50.486 --> 21:00.830
There's an endless list of examples of why it is that, you know, well, we sequence the whole genome, but not really, because we don't really need to.

21:01.590 --> 21:02.571
Genes cause disease.

21:02.611 --> 21:05.272
So what diseases are caused by nurture?

21:08.490 --> 21:09.431
Have you ever thought about that?

21:09.471 --> 21:11.953
What diseases are caused by your environment?

21:13.534 --> 21:22.681
Your exposure to toxins, your interaction with your microbiome, your interaction with the microbiome.

21:23.802 --> 21:25.383
What diseases are caused by that?

21:29.966 --> 21:32.927
So what codes for the trajectory through time?

21:32.947 --> 21:34.268
We've already asked this question.

21:34.288 --> 21:36.208
Of course, they don't have any clue about that.

21:36.248 --> 21:37.829
They don't want you to think about that.

21:37.869 --> 21:39.890
They want you to think about self-assembly.

21:40.970 --> 21:45.312
So which one of these do we need to understand more, nature or nurture?

21:45.332 --> 21:49.653
I guess that needs to have a little thingy there.

21:52.755 --> 21:56.236
Which one of these do we need to understand more, nature versus nurture?

21:57.773 --> 21:59.535
These are all questions I think we should ask.

21:59.575 --> 22:13.190
Let's go back to starting to pivot to the new biology, which is life is a pie with a tat, and think about the implications of these ideas in the context of life is a pie with a tat.

22:15.753 --> 22:18.455
Most DNA is probably then not understood.

22:19.448 --> 22:41.023
And maybe that's where this, if, if, if, if, if, if gigantic I F, if DNA and, and that material is consequentially the thing which encodes the pattern integrity, holds the information and, and perpetuates it through time across generations.

22:42.540 --> 22:50.707
then one of the first admissions they would need to make is that this is, we have no fricking idea how this is all encoded in there.

22:50.747 --> 22:55.490
But we can see some protein sequences that appear to be consequential.

22:56.611 --> 22:58.873
But they don't represent it that way at all.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.855
And so you know that they are lying to you.

23:01.375 --> 23:05.338
Number two, protein sequences does not make a pattern integrity.

23:06.619 --> 23:11.844
If you have all the protein sequences and you can make them, and even if you just give them all the folding,

23:12.759 --> 23:14.761
You still don't have the pattern integrity.

23:14.801 --> 23:18.005
You don't have the maintenance schedule.

23:18.045 --> 23:21.248
You don't have the development schedule.

23:22.650 --> 23:23.871
It's all missing.

23:25.899 --> 23:43.285
And so genes, if they are anything, if DNA is anything to do with heredity and plans and architecture and structure and function, then genes at best can create or limit the possibilities, the palette.

23:43.886 --> 23:47.547
How many different colors of ink do you have available?

23:49.531 --> 24:09.402
That's about all we got so far because we can't describe any other aspect of the pattern integrity other than its components and some of the components seem to be encoded in DNA, which is a monumental achievement if that ends up to be a true observation going forward.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.985
But self-assembly of these proteins is not the answer.

24:17.566 --> 24:30.672
Even special assembly of these proteins is not the answer if we cannot find out how it occurs with such regularity and perfection, needing no coercion at all.

24:33.553 --> 24:35.274
Thinking of your little kids.

24:36.732 --> 24:44.735
Thinking of your little kids, there's a word that my friend Joshua Lederberg, many words he came up with.

24:44.835 --> 24:47.276
One of the coolest ones he came up with is euphenics.

24:48.397 --> 24:52.719
And in comparison here, we're going to do euphenics versus eugenics.

24:53.919 --> 25:00.042
And eugenics, I think everyone is very familiar with it, is the optimization of a germline.

25:01.242 --> 25:04.803
Typically, this is thought to as selective breeding.

25:06.264 --> 25:17.111
But it could also, in theory, be some kind of transgenic thing where we know everything about our biology and we can make it better, you know, skip these natural processes.

25:17.171 --> 25:27.058
But if you just think of eugenics using natural processes, it's still, you know, breeding people with the intention of making people better in the coming generations.

25:27.138 --> 25:34.783
And for many, many people in many previous generations and the current one, these ideas are not crazy.

25:34.823 --> 25:35.784
They're just, you know, not

25:36.624 --> 25:43.146
They're not something that we can talk about on TV, but you know, when the smart people get together, they all admit that this isn't a terrible idea.

25:44.327 --> 25:56.331
Now, what Joshua Lederberg argued, and I think this comes into play with regard to the nature versus nurture argument, is he introduced the idea of euphenics.

25:56.471 --> 26:01.252
And so I'm going to go over here for a second, and I got a sniper analogy for you.

26:04.218 --> 26:23.569
Let's think about a guy who comes over to my house and we set up a target in the backyard about 300 yards back on an oak tree and we're given a rifle and we start shooting it.

26:24.410 --> 26:28.032
Let's say he starts shooting it because we're going to think hypothetically of him.

26:29.057 --> 26:35.158
This sniper guy comes over and he's shooting the rifle, but he keeps shooting it into the ground.

26:36.218 --> 26:44.180
Now, we could make several different assumptions about where to start troubleshooting it, right?

26:44.220 --> 26:46.180
We could troubleshoot the scope.

26:46.260 --> 26:50.901
Maybe the scope is off X, Y, Z, up and down, whatever.

26:52.021 --> 26:54.101
Maybe he's just not a very good shot.

26:55.462 --> 26:56.962
Maybe the barrel is bent.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.302
Maybe we need a different gun.

27:00.535 --> 27:24.339
Now, I want you to think about the analogy where if the genes are fine, but we're not hitting the target because we haven't optimized our development, because we haven't optimized our adolescence, because we haven't optimized anything about what comes after conception.

27:26.277 --> 27:31.099
then we have not adequately identified the potential encoded in the genes.

27:31.179 --> 27:44.723
The genes, whatever they are, whatever these people believe they are, the potential that is inherent in the pattern integrity, we are not, as humans, even familiar with what that maximum potential is.

27:45.583 --> 27:51.645
And I don't think anybody on this planet would argue that we haven't done very much to optimize the potential of our children.

27:51.686 --> 27:52.786
Maybe some people do.

27:54.309 --> 28:06.993
but our whole society isn't focused on that as a primary goal like it probably should be if we had a multi-generational time horizon in our mind in the right way.

28:09.269 --> 28:14.552
If our kids were having that time horizon in their mind, then we wouldn't even need to worry about it.

28:14.592 --> 28:30.380
If we raised our children to understand themselves as along on that trajectory and an active part in finding and optimizing that optimal trajectory through time and what is required to obtain it and maintain it, now we're talking about health.

28:31.841 --> 28:33.362
Now we're talking about well-being.

28:35.359 --> 28:43.261
And so it would be very, very bad, right, to assume that the gun is wrong.

28:44.421 --> 28:50.202
Fix the gun, fix the gun, fix the gun, fix the gun, change the gun, move the sight, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

28:50.322 --> 28:57.104
If the sniper himself is terrible, the gun might have been perfect.

28:59.244 --> 29:10.973
And so in this analogy, you can think of the gun as the genes and the sniper as the nurture, if you want to simplify it down, which I still think is a very dangerous thing to do.

29:13.315 --> 29:25.225
And we have been convinced through the Human Genome Project and for 20 years of active persuasion that eugenics, the genes, are ultimately the most important.

29:25.987 --> 29:30.929
to the extent to which that our society functions to hold back people with certain genes.

29:33.930 --> 29:36.031
Promote other people with certain genes.

29:36.071 --> 29:42.554
And we shouldn't worry at all, even think about or consider the possibility that we don't even know our own potential yet.

29:45.305 --> 29:51.007
And what that means is that they have fooled us into believing that they can learn anything here, right?

29:51.107 --> 29:55.908
If you understand that these are undivorceable concepts, they work hand in hand.

29:56.308 --> 30:00.590
We can't possibly understand our genetics.

30:00.910 --> 30:02.850
I still will use the slave speak.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.631
We cannot understand that.

30:06.067 --> 30:29.285
from a biological perspective, if we spend no time at all understanding the optimal trajectory through time and what it is and how to achieve it, only then can we understand what genetic potential, what heredity, what inherited potential, maybe that's how we should talk about it, what inherited potential we were gifted from the previous generation.

30:30.717 --> 30:47.910
And so in fact, because we have so much more control over optimizing our trajectory through time, as opposed to optimizing what we inherit from the previous generation, our entire lives should be bent on euphenics, not on eugenics.

30:47.970 --> 30:57.897
And yet our entire culture focuses on emphasizing and blaming and scapegoating our genes.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.498
And I think that's bad biology 101.

31:02.458 --> 31:04.119
That's bad biology 101.

31:04.239 --> 31:14.801
And so bad biology 101 broke the other day when we started thinking about there are no diseases blamed on bacteriophages, and that bacteriophages are free to pass the gut barrier.

31:14.821 --> 31:18.541
Let's break it a little more by using mitochondria.

31:20.282 --> 31:25.143
And I'd love it if we can see if I have to see what's happening here.

31:26.243 --> 31:27.223
If we can, uh,

31:29.192 --> 31:30.193
Why is that not working?

31:31.353 --> 31:32.754
I have to just check one thing here.

31:32.794 --> 31:33.415
Sorry about that.

31:40.539 --> 31:41.000
Why is that?

31:41.020 --> 31:41.940
Oh, yeah, it should work now.

31:43.841 --> 31:44.342
Remove that.

31:46.603 --> 31:51.346
So life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

31:52.427 --> 31:53.508
Life is a pie with a tat.

31:56.434 --> 32:00.215
Life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

32:00.275 --> 32:05.397
And let's just start with there are no bacteriophage diseases, which is an interesting observation.

32:05.437 --> 32:06.877
I'm sure you find that interesting.

32:07.437 --> 32:11.919
There are also bacteriophages are free to move past the gut barrier.

32:12.559 --> 32:14.459
And I guess they interact with the immune system.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.080
The question is, is what happens then?

32:17.526 --> 32:19.447
Now, there are two things that we know for sure.

32:19.527 --> 32:25.610
From Lynn Margulis, we know that mitochondria are probably endosymbionts.

32:25.690 --> 32:39.117
Now, in that insect video we watched the other day, they called them primary symbionts and secondary symbionts, which is interesting because, again, part of this enchantment, almost exclusively, is semantic.

32:40.441 --> 32:47.824
It's getting biologists and doctors to all use different vocabulary, which overlaps in very unuseful ways and the gears never mesh.

32:48.364 --> 33:07.931
And so somebody like Lynn Margulis would need people to step in front of the work in order to make sure that this endosymbiotic theory didn't get out of control, you know, because somebody like Joshua Lederberg was already debating during his lifetime, where do we draw

33:09.924 --> 33:15.426
Where do we draw the edges of an individual?

33:16.306 --> 33:30.230
And Joshua Lederberg already knew that we couldn't draw the edges of an individual at the epithelial barrier if they had a symbiosis with bacteria.

33:32.711 --> 33:37.653
Especially if that symbiosis extended through the gut, into the payer's patches,

33:38.777 --> 33:52.820
allowed phages to move freely through the body so that the immune system could favor bacteria and work against other bacteria by interfering with their phage communication.

33:53.620 --> 34:08.303
And since mitochondria are endosymbionts, I want you to think about the possibility that why are those phages allowed to go throughout your body and could they also be interacting with the endosymbionts

34:09.912 --> 34:14.114
the remnants of ancient bacteria that are in every cell of your body.

34:15.395 --> 34:24.399
A kind of intracellular communication between the ectosymbionts in your gut and the endosymbionts in every cell.

34:24.819 --> 34:29.342
Maybe hunger is just a symbiotic signaling mechanism.

34:32.043 --> 34:37.686
Now, the reason why I had that echo on is because I want you to see that these ideas are nuts.

34:38.715 --> 34:40.877
but they were right there in front of us all along.

34:40.997 --> 34:53.407
Pears patches and antibodies would be a wonderful way for your body to select which bacterial subtypes they want to assist and which ones they would like to hinder.

34:57.250 --> 35:01.373
The fact of the matter is that some people are really nice to kiss and other people are not.

35:01.433 --> 35:07.598
And maybe that has something to do with a very complex interaction between how our body

35:09.409 --> 35:15.652
is in a symbiosis with a microbiome that's very different than someone else's microbiome.

35:16.613 --> 35:22.016
And a combination of smell and taste can indicate incompatibility or compatibility.

35:24.909 --> 35:40.006
And so here we are with a fake anti-vaccine movement that is dominated by gut biologists who show us rainbow pictures of all of the genomes of the things in the gut and claim to be optimizing it or that SARS-CoV-2 is right there with it.

35:41.988 --> 35:44.831
It's right there in front of us, ladies and gentlemen.

35:44.891 --> 35:46.433
Some of this stuff is speculation.

35:48.663 --> 35:55.866
But there is no speculation about the abundance of phages, their ubiquitous nature, ability to go everywhere.

35:57.007 --> 36:05.731
And there is no debating that this endosymbiosis and this ectosymbiosis occurs throughout nature.

36:05.991 --> 36:16.296
And there is no pattern integrity with a trajectory across time that does not exist exclusively because they are at an interface.

36:17.728 --> 36:22.274
between decomposition and composition, between breakdown and synthesis.

36:24.196 --> 36:33.267
And it is only that orchestrated balance that can allow such a beautiful thing as a pattern integrity as your child to exist.

36:37.062 --> 36:48.105
And so what is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time is the most important question that we can ask as far as I'm concerned going forward and it's going to be the motivation of most of my work.

36:50.045 --> 36:56.187
I want to just point out quick here that although this is dim I want you to see that in the insect video

36:57.591 --> 37:07.000
There were a wide variety of insect and bacterial symbioses and there were primary symbionts and there were secondary symbionts.

37:07.661 --> 37:13.006
The primary symbionts had very reduced genomes and they were more organelle-like.

37:13.026 --> 37:15.008
You could think of these as mitochondria-like.

37:16.009 --> 37:20.033
And the secondary symbionts had a much more dynamic genome

37:20.814 --> 37:32.220
They even exchange genes and acquire genes and, you know, kind of, it seems like an interplay between the host and the ectosymbiont.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.100
And that's what I would say.

37:33.180 --> 37:38.683
Primary symbiont is really an endosymbiont that's inside the cell, ectosymbiont.

37:38.723 --> 37:43.005
And those two come from Lynn Margulis, who had these ideas a long time ago.

37:44.724 --> 37:57.013
And so I just want to play this for a little while to point out to you a few things that should have caught your eye had you gone into that article or had you finished watching this video without me.

37:57.153 --> 37:58.474
And then we'll wrap it up.

37:58.654 --> 37:59.735
What the genomes look like.

38:00.355 --> 38:05.199
So these are largely gut bacteria that could be in other host locations as well.

38:06.420 --> 38:34.243
And for the last decade or so, this has been really the main system I worked on, and I'll talk more about it tomorrow at the Lambda lunch, but we've especially looked in the honey bee, and it has a very specialized microbiome, and we've concentrated on this community that's in the ileum, this one part of the hindgut, and specifically where this part of the hindgut is dominated by two species, Snagressella, which lives right on the ileum wall, and Guillemella apicola, which kind of

38:34.483 --> 38:36.304
Notice the word biofilm here.

38:37.124 --> 38:46.248
Biofilm is something that during COVID they were talking a lot about as possibly something that was unleashed on us, that was being used as bad guy stuff.

38:46.488 --> 38:49.890
It's like part of their bioweapons are biofilms.

38:50.710 --> 38:52.151
But biofilms are everywhere.

38:52.751 --> 38:57.333
And chances are very good we are reliant on one inside of our gut as well.

38:58.373 --> 39:04.299
This is the illusion that they are sustaining, that there is not any parallel here.

39:04.419 --> 39:19.293
And in fact, there's parallel between rhizophagy and between the guts of every higher animal that's ever been on Earth has required any pattern integrity requires this interface to exist.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.621
layered on top of it in clusters.

39:24.442 --> 39:25.983
So these are found only in social bees.

39:26.023 --> 39:32.307
They've evolved with bees based on a lot of different work for over 80 million years based on the age of these bees.

39:33.167 --> 39:37.790
They're socially transmitted in the hive, but it's not strictly maternal.

39:37.830 --> 39:41.433
It's just going among individuals just like our gut microbes do.

39:42.273 --> 39:46.916
And the nice thing here is they're all culturable, so finally can do different kinds of experiments.

39:47.336 --> 39:55.602
And we're developing genetic tools, which are getting more streamlined and more possibilities just by the week almost.

39:56.663 --> 40:00.605
So they acquire this just after emerging from the pupil stage.

40:01.386 --> 40:03.927
What she really means there is that they can clone these things.

40:03.987 --> 40:07.570
They can't culture them, so they have to find another way to make them.

40:09.048 --> 40:11.893
in the hive, and they get them from their sisters.

40:12.414 --> 40:14.899
And the full community is established by about day four.

40:16.840 --> 40:27.004
And that gives us this advantage that if we take the pupae before they meet their sisters and let them emerge in a sterile environment, they will be microbiota free.

40:27.304 --> 40:34.106
So they won't have any of the microbes that are the characteristic ones that take over the microbiota in the gut.

40:34.426 --> 40:38.748
And so normally these specialized microbes will be 95 to 99% of what... So are there phages in breast milk?

40:42.915 --> 40:50.433
Are there phages in breast milk that can set up an environment where only certain bacteria can compete successfully?

40:52.028 --> 41:00.235
These are all questions that should be asked if we were really in the right frame of reference, if we were really thinking about our biology in the correct way.

41:00.275 --> 41:01.856
And I think that's why it's so easy.

41:01.876 --> 41:08.161
You can just pause here and ask questions that are like, whoa, because it's all going to fall in place.

41:08.181 --> 41:13.866
It's going to fall in place for each one of you as you start to be able to hold these ideas in your head.

41:13.886 --> 41:17.869
All things clear up very quickly.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.141
in the bee or in the gut of the bee.

41:22.142 --> 41:29.630
We can basically prevent those from establishing and then we can do experiments where we can control what bacteria are in the bee.

41:30.191 --> 41:33.134
And so this is one naturally exposed showing Snagrasella in purple.

41:33.154 --> 41:37.238
Now be careful, there's a little bait and switch going on here.

41:37.278 --> 41:41.763
They can't keep a bee free of Mycobryota forever or it would be dead.

41:42.830 --> 41:51.155
But what they can do is show by removing the bees early that they acquire their microbiota through social interaction.

41:52.156 --> 41:53.437
That's all this proves.

41:53.477 --> 41:55.618
It doesn't prove that bees don't need it.

41:56.839 --> 41:58.900
It just proves that they acquire it that way.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.501
Be careful.

41:59.541 --> 42:00.842
Don't read too much into this.

42:01.402 --> 42:10.688
Well, this is one exposed to a single inoculation in the lab after four days and you see very robust colonization.

42:12.568 --> 42:23.693
So we know a lot about what these do, and one thing they do, especially this one, Gilumella, is break down recalcitrant polysaccharides that are in the pollen husks.

42:24.033 --> 42:38.600
So the bee has already extracted the good nutrients, the sugar, the protein, but these pollen husks that have plant cell wall components and all kinds of complicated molecules, Gilumella has collected genes, and all the strains differ, it's very diverse.

42:40.441 --> 42:50.585
So how much do you understand about what you can just suck out of your food and what you need the bacteria to first kind of, you know, chop up before you can absorb?

42:51.085 --> 42:52.366
How much do you know about that?

42:54.327 --> 42:54.907
Exactly.

42:56.088 --> 42:56.788
Exactly.

42:56.828 --> 42:58.769
How much does your doctor know about that?

43:00.109 --> 43:00.870
Oh, wow.

43:00.990 --> 43:03.531
I wonder how much Sabine Hazan knows about that.

43:04.702 --> 43:06.542
Now you're getting the picture.

43:06.843 --> 43:08.243
Now you're getting the picture.

43:08.463 --> 43:16.425
...tenases and different glycosyl hydrolases and so on for breaking down these molecules and using the sugars, fermenting the sugars that come out.

43:17.105 --> 43:27.047
And possibly, we know that at least some of the resulting short-chain fatty acids are absorbed by the host, because you can look in the hemolymph, the blood of the bee, and find them there.

43:27.567 --> 43:28.667
So there's some nutritional role.

43:28.687 --> 43:30.848
You don't know how important it is quantitatively.

43:32.173 --> 43:37.316
One thing we started to get into is the, it turns out that there's a lot of strain variation.

43:37.376 --> 43:38.797
I thought this would be a simple system.

43:38.837 --> 43:42.699
There's your... One thing to understand is that bugs have hemolymph.

43:42.899 --> 43:45.220
It's just kind of this yellow goo and that's it.

43:46.341 --> 43:53.564
We have this very special circulatory system made of blood specifically for oxygen.

43:53.584 --> 43:55.626
Yeah, sure.

43:55.686 --> 43:57.226
It gives sugar and stuff like that.

43:57.286 --> 43:57.867
That's fine.

43:58.888 --> 44:09.030
but its primary goal and function is oxygen because a lot of the nutrients that are primarily lipid soluble are not in the blood by definition.

44:09.151 --> 44:25.755
Be careful here and understand how important it is not to see your guts as just a tube that then the good stuff goes into your blood and gets carried where it needs to go and then that's digestion with some acid in your stomach or something like that.

44:26.615 --> 44:27.015
It is a

44:28.348 --> 44:37.675
impossibly complex symphony where we are symbiotic with a whole bouquet of bacteria.

44:38.836 --> 44:52.025
And those bacteria are symbiotic with us in the sense that they provide optimal trade-offs and we provide optimal trade-offs for them, which are mutually beneficial.

44:52.565 --> 44:56.208
And this relationship has apparently either

44:57.935 --> 45:16.140
been honed over millions of years, or is part of a irreducible complexity that we will only scratch the surface of as we attempt to understand it.

45:17.361 --> 45:20.902
But neither way, it is something that they are lying to us about.

45:21.022 --> 45:25.203
Lying, lying, lying about being able to augment

45:28.666 --> 45:29.194
It's awful.

45:30.225 --> 45:31.085
five species.

45:31.966 --> 45:35.647
But each of those species, of course, has all these strains, just like in the human gut.

45:36.387 --> 45:40.008
And it turns out in Gilumella, sometimes those strains are really bona fide species.

45:40.768 --> 45:45.049
So Gilumella apicola and Apis, they're both very closely related.

45:45.829 --> 45:53.311
But one of them, Gilumella apis, lives in this forward part of the gut, right where the nitrogen waste is coming into the bee.

45:54.372 --> 45:58.693
And it's able to use urea and basically ammonia for

45:59.053 --> 46:07.358
making amino acids, whereas Guillemela apicola cannot use urea, but it's got the specialization on all of these polys.

46:08.339 --> 46:15.143
So in an insect whose gut is about four, like what is that, half a centimeter there?

46:15.203 --> 46:22.887
So it's like two centimeters long, has its gut microbiota organized by region.

46:25.208 --> 46:30.169
And our 24-foot hose that our food goes through, ah, who cares?

46:32.170 --> 46:34.750
These glycosyl hydrolases and pectinase and so on.

46:35.090 --> 46:38.171
They also have different pH optima, and we've measured the pH.

46:38.271 --> 46:49.074
Think about what that says if Sabine Hazan shows you a picture of all these different colored bands and claims that she knows all the bacteria that aren't in your gut, but can't tell you their distribution.

46:53.032 --> 46:55.254
knowing what we know about bees.

46:55.834 --> 46:56.955
Come on, guys.

46:57.375 --> 47:00.917
Stop lying!

47:01.778 --> 47:05.941
It's higher in this forward part and lower back here where this fermentation is going on.

47:06.361 --> 47:09.843
So they seem to have diverged in their ecology within a single host.

47:09.883 --> 47:12.385
So every bee has both of these, every honeybee worker.

47:12.765 --> 47:17.848
But they're having this different metabolism and different niches within the gut.

47:18.289 --> 47:20.390
And Snagressella colonizes along the whole gut.

47:22.130 --> 47:28.140
But the main thing that bacteria do in the bee gut is protect against pathogens.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.023
At least that's what I think is the main thing.

47:30.043 --> 47:32.126
There have been a lot of studies from us.

47:32.226 --> 47:33.689
Protect against pathogens.

47:33.849 --> 47:34.790
They select

47:37.020 --> 47:38.822
and maintain the symbiosis.

47:40.403 --> 47:45.847
The bacteria that are not in symbiosis with us are by definition pathogens in this model.

47:45.867 --> 47:59.419
But if you don't think of them that way, but you think of them as bacteria not in symbiosis with us, that would like to occupy that niche and potentially could

48:02.165 --> 48:18.648
And that our immune system, if you will, our recognition system, our molecular cellular system that interacts with this on a molecular basis, it would work to remember that.

48:19.628 --> 48:31.290
And that could cause problems, dysregulation, and an inability to maintain a fine balance between decomposition and composition, resulting in a disease state.

48:33.675 --> 48:39.119
us and other labs showing that they protect against opportunistic bacteria, try panosomatids.

48:39.159 --> 48:40.841
They're opportunistic.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.942
Opportunistic bacteria is much better.

48:43.143 --> 48:46.805
And so protecting against is not, it's more maintaining.

48:46.946 --> 49:00.236
Once that balance is set up early in life, there is a maintenance process and disturbing it might disturb the trajectory through time of the entire pattern integrity.

49:01.797 --> 49:02.558
You could kill the bee.

49:05.287 --> 49:07.848
You could disrupt the development of a child.

49:13.872 --> 49:16.693
And different RNA viruses that are known B pathogens.

49:17.313 --> 49:20.735
It has some implications even just in beekeeping because.

49:20.935 --> 49:24.197
And again, that's just an illusion that goes through everybody's assumptions.

49:24.317 --> 49:31.321
She is a biologist who's not in a position in her mind to question whether those RNA viruses are

49:32.316 --> 49:38.841
a consequence of the microbiota or they just are replicating in the bee.

49:39.201 --> 49:48.489
And she has no biology to believe that they are bee pathogens except for what these RNA virologists have told her in their books and papers.

49:49.570 --> 49:57.596
In reality, they're probably all genetic signaling of the symbionts, the ectosymbionts.

49:59.916 --> 50:14.653
We've done work and others also showing that common beekeeping practices such as giving antibiotics to the bee colony or just agricultural practices such as herbicides that target pathways that are present in

50:14.813 --> 50:20.015
Another terrible way to disrupt the microbiota is to use a product called Miralax.

50:20.135 --> 50:28.277
Miralax is often prescribed to kids that have some kind of bowel disorder, because it helps them to pass.

50:28.817 --> 50:31.638
But what it actually does is it removes all the water.

50:34.839 --> 50:37.480
And how it works is it

50:39.272 --> 50:43.013
It sucks all the water out of everything.

50:43.293 --> 50:49.494
And what that does is basically completely depletes the microbiome if it's used too long.

50:50.715 --> 50:54.155
And it can be devastating, like ridiculous.

50:55.276 --> 50:56.696
Kids go nuts on this stuff.

50:57.136 --> 50:58.736
And there's lots of testimony.

50:58.756 --> 51:00.217
There's a Facebook group about it.

51:00.957 --> 51:05.258
And so again, this is the devastating reality

51:07.048 --> 51:16.145
that ourselves as a pattern integrity needs to be understood as a fine balance and it's a symbiosis.

51:17.628 --> 51:18.770
That's a beautiful word.

51:21.445 --> 51:23.246
because it means so very much.

51:23.646 --> 51:25.006
They disrupt the microbiota.

51:25.206 --> 51:28.087
They cause the in-hive mortality to be higher.

51:28.167 --> 51:32.768
So we can see, we can do mark recapture in the hives and look at mortality in their natural habitat.

51:32.788 --> 51:41.671
So I mean, if you just wanted to reduce population or reduce life expectancy or increase, you know, bad health, it would just disrupt the microbiome.

51:43.147 --> 51:45.589
because bees come back home, that's where they live.

51:46.169 --> 51:47.830
And so we can see how long they persist.

51:48.430 --> 51:57.495
And in lab challenges, we can show that disrupting with these compounds will cause them to... Here you can see the biofilm barrier right here, right?

51:57.535 --> 52:02.438
They're showing you the stuff that they were talking about in COVID as some kind of bioweapon.

52:02.478 --> 52:04.139
And oh my goodness, biofilms.

52:04.199 --> 52:08.301
Look at these pictures and look at these patents and look at these papers about biofilms.

52:08.781 --> 52:09.982
It's all biofilms.

52:11.735 --> 52:26.809
That's all part of the same illusion that is clinging desperately to make sure that we pass on to our kids this bad biology about genes and evolution and bad guys being pathogens.

52:26.989 --> 52:28.670
Everything in the world's out to kill us.

52:30.652 --> 52:32.474
Be more susceptible to pathogens.

52:33.194 --> 52:36.677
So the microbiota is probably most important in protecting against pathogens.

52:37.759 --> 52:48.201
And what a spectacularly dumb answer that is when she just got through saying that they are metabolically required for the bee to thrive.

52:49.681 --> 52:51.421
I mean, that's all you needed to hear.

52:52.162 --> 53:00.483
This is a basic intro to the fact that we are pattern integrities with a trajectory across time.

53:01.243 --> 53:05.564
And the evidence has been right in our face ever since Lynn Margolis really described it best

53:07.258 --> 53:09.500
It has been right in our face with payers patches.

53:10.821 --> 53:15.385
And it's been right in our face with rhizophagy and with the gut of insects.

53:16.506 --> 53:19.329
And this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

53:19.349 --> 53:22.331
That's why there's an anti-vaccine movement that's fake in America.

53:22.351 --> 53:33.761
If you want to save America's children, you've got to save them from these fake anti-vaxxers because if we seek the truth together, we can come to a biology that reveals that background.

53:34.775 --> 53:39.159
and reveals this as just a joke, makes everything go back to green.

53:39.960 --> 53:55.114
And I think situation is actually very green right now if we understand this new biology as a pattern integrity and think about how we've been bamboozled, how we haven't considered some very prime ideas.

53:57.412 --> 54:11.358
like the intercommunication between our mitochondria and our ectosymbionts, even the possibility that we have endosymbionts that we're not aware of or ectosymbionts that pass the gut barrier, for all I know.

54:12.019 --> 54:26.025
Certainly, they go into Peyer's patches at night and interact with the immune system in a way that is grossly underestimated to be central, rather, I think, central to our very existence as a pattern integrity with a tat.

54:27.146 --> 54:43.057
Because we exist at the interface of composition and decomposition and we are the definition of multi-layered symbiosis from our multi-cellular body with endosymbionts all the way to the ectosymbionts in our gut.

54:43.137 --> 54:48.121
Ladies and gentlemen, remember this biology frees us from this lie.

54:49.762 --> 54:52.564
This biology explains the background that they lied about.

54:53.496 --> 54:54.176
And there are two.

54:54.917 --> 54:59.519
The first one is how people die and how many people were expected to die.

54:59.999 --> 55:10.884
And the second one is if they murdered a few people to get some peaks and then modeled on those peaks, then all it would require is a succinct list.

55:11.464 --> 55:13.886
And we've had that succinct list for years.

55:14.706 --> 55:19.548
At the top of that list is the lack of antibiotic use because antibiotics don't work on viruses.

55:20.429 --> 55:22.890
At the top of that list is the absolute

55:23.945 --> 55:32.349
Ridiculous use of ventilators and supplementary oxygen in combination or sequentially to cause ARDS.

55:33.209 --> 55:37.492
Also remdesivir, midazolam, all kinds of ways that they poisoned people.

55:38.032 --> 55:44.995
Opioid deaths on the street contributed to the falling in life expectancy.

55:45.135 --> 55:47.636
And then fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.

55:49.817 --> 55:50.878
And fraud is lying.

55:52.912 --> 55:55.015
So we can summarize it very, very well.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.619
And we have been doing it for a few years.

55:57.779 --> 56:00.803
And this new biology, it actually supports this idea.

56:02.065 --> 56:04.168
I don't know why that's stalling out here.

56:05.049 --> 56:05.710
We're crashing.

56:05.730 --> 56:06.671
We're getting attacked.

56:07.252 --> 56:08.534
It's got to be attacking.

56:08.954 --> 56:09.595
No, I'm just kidding.

56:09.635 --> 56:10.176
I don't know what's up.

56:11.505 --> 56:13.608
The murder and lies can be replaced, though.

56:13.908 --> 56:15.069
We can do something else.

56:15.129 --> 56:18.273
We can offer an alternative to our children.

56:18.313 --> 56:21.377
That alternative is that RNA could never pandemic.

56:21.757 --> 56:27.223
That intramuscular injection is really not a way of administering medicine to healthy kids.

56:27.944 --> 56:55.167
or even healthy adults, that transfection was a methodology that they always knew would result in all of this damage, and that's why they tried to blame the spike as being fancy in the beginning of the pandemic, to make sure that we could confuse the effects of a virus with a gain-of-function spike, with the spike that's now integrating into people's cancers and this kind of thing, with the primary signal being SV40.

56:56.644 --> 57:04.771
one of the most widely produced molecular biological signals in industry and academia for the last 20 years.

57:05.192 --> 57:10.497
Probably the most widely produced DNA sequence on Earth.

57:10.957 --> 57:16.102
And yet now we're supposed to blame the presence of that sequence exclusively on Pfizer.

57:17.383 --> 57:19.144
This is the illusion, ladies and gentlemen.

57:19.564 --> 57:31.508
The population pyramid was a problem that needed solving and all it takes is placebos and non-specific PCR tests for them to lie about a background and for us to teach a mythology to our children.

57:31.568 --> 57:33.009
Please don't do it, ladies and gentlemen.

57:33.389 --> 57:34.929
If you like this work, please share it.

57:35.009 --> 57:37.010
It's at stream.gigaohm.bio.

57:37.050 --> 57:39.591
If you want to support the work, please go to gigaohm.bio.

57:40.851 --> 57:44.792
gigaohmbiological.com, excuse me, and find a way to do that.

57:45.252 --> 57:46.693
We need every little bit we can get.

57:47.133 --> 57:47.753
Thank you very much.

57:47.813 --> 57:52.654
I'll be here again soon, probably sometime over the weekend to try and make up for Thursday.

57:52.694 --> 57:55.775
But if I don't make it over the weekend, don't be mad.

57:56.575 --> 57:58.996
I do have some work to do.

57:59.056 --> 58:02.957
It's not a day job, but it is extra money that we definitely need.

58:03.037 --> 58:04.897
And I made some promises that I need to keep.

58:04.957 --> 58:05.618
Thank you very much.

58:06.158 --> 58:06.938
I'll see you again soon.
