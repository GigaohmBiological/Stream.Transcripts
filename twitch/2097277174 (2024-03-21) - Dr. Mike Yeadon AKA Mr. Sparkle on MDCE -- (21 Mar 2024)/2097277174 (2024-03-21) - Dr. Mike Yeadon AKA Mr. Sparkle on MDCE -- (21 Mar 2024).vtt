WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:35.120
Yeah. All right. We're done. We're ready to go. Thank you for the volunteers who if they if they

00:35.120 --> 00:39.440
get in later, I won't do the intro because it's just an interest of time. But for those of you who

00:39.440 --> 00:44.160
want to see a standard intro, look at another recording. And we're delighted. Thank you,

00:44.160 --> 00:50.320
Stephen, for organizing Mike Yeeten to be with us and for going through those logistical hurdles.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.520
And Mike, we're in your hands and look forward to your conversation.

00:56.480 --> 01:02.320
Can you do your normal speech so that it's the same as usual, even though it's a bit later than usual?

01:02.320 --> 01:08.560
Yes, I can. I'll be quick. So welcome to today's discussion of medical doctors for COVID ethics

01:08.560 --> 01:12.800
international. This group was founded by Dr. Stephen Trust over three years ago with a

01:12.800 --> 01:18.880
desire to pursue truth, ethics, justice, freedom and health. Stephen has stood up against government

01:18.880 --> 01:23.760
and power over the years and has been a whistleblower and activist. His medical specialty is radiology.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.960
I'm Charles Cobess, the moderator of this group on Australasia's passion provocateur.

01:29.680 --> 01:34.000
And we love passionate people in these meetings. And everyone who comes here is passionate.

01:35.280 --> 01:41.040
I backed his law for 20 years before changing career 31 years ago. And in the last 13 years,

01:41.040 --> 01:45.600
I've helped parents and lawyers to strategize remedies for vaccine damage and damage from bad

01:45.600 --> 01:51.920
medical advice. I'm also the CEO of the industrial hemp company. We comprise lots of professions

01:51.920 --> 01:57.200
here. And we're from all around the world. Many of us thought that there's more than

01:57.200 --> 02:02.800
many of us proudly say yes, we are passionate anti-vaxxers. If this is your first time here,

02:02.800 --> 02:07.920
welcome and feel free to introduce yourself in the chat. If you publish a newsletter or a podcast

02:07.920 --> 02:13.040
or you have a radio or TV show or you've written a book, put the links into the chat so we can follow

02:13.040 --> 02:19.040
you, promote you and find you. Most of us understand we're in the middle of World War three. And that

02:19.040 --> 02:25.520
the medical science battle is only one of 12 battle fronts. This is no time for us to be tired.

02:25.520 --> 02:32.480
We are some four years into what I predict is a seven year war. So we're only halfway through. So

02:33.040 --> 02:39.200
regurg your lines. Most of us understand the development of science and that the science is

02:39.200 --> 02:45.600
never settled. And Mike given our guest today is a scientist. I'm sure he knows that. Some of us

02:45.600 --> 02:51.680
believe that viruses exist. Some of us believe that they are a hoax and some of us are sitting on

02:51.680 --> 02:56.640
the fence. This meeting runs for two and a half hours. After which for those with the time, Tom

02:56.640 --> 03:03.280
Rodman runs a video telegram meeting for those with the time to join. We listened to Dr. Mike Yead

03:03.280 --> 03:08.240
and our guest for as long as Mike wishes to speak. And then we have Q&A. Stephen Trust by a long

03:08.240 --> 03:14.000
established tradition asks the first questions for 15 minutes. This is a free speech environment

03:14.000 --> 03:20.480
with appropriate moderating and no ad hominem attacks. You don't attack people. We discuss ideas.

03:21.760 --> 03:27.200
Unfortunately, Mike is not going to be on camera. We are lovingly not interested.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.320
We are just in the way that requires nobody to say anything that may offend another.

03:33.120 --> 03:37.840
We come with an attitude of perspective of love, not fear. Fear is the opposite of love.

03:37.840 --> 03:45.120
Fear swashes you. Love on the other hand expands you. As human beings, our unity is our strength.

03:45.680 --> 03:52.560
Being divided makes us weak. These twice weekly meetings are not just talkfests and extraordinary

03:52.560 --> 03:59.040
range of actions and initiatives have been generated from linkages made by attendees in these meetings.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.840
If you have a solution or a product or links or resources that will help people put the details

04:03.840 --> 04:08.400
into the chat, the meeting is recorded and is uploaded onto the Rumble channel.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.080
And they're welcome to our guest presenter, Dr. Mike Yead.

04:12.640 --> 04:19.200
It is a recording and I am not participating in it. Don't let it seem like that I am. Test test test test.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.240
I can't quite hear myself very well. There we go. No, I'm not there. This was yesterday.

04:24.880 --> 04:32.000
In famously renowned, we're at 100 limit on our meeting size. Mike, that shows how popular you are.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.960
Thank you so much for giving us your time, wisdom and insights. And Mike's CV for those watching

04:38.960 --> 04:43.520
the recording is on the show notes, on this recording that is on the Rumble channel.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.800
And thank you, Stephen Frost again, for creating this group over three years ago and for organising

04:48.800 --> 04:52.480
Mike to be with us today. Over to you, Mike.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.080
Charles, thank you very much. Fantastic introduction and also really good to

04:58.960 --> 05:05.040
just hear about the group and welcome or welcome. Thank you very much everyone for connecting and

05:05.040 --> 05:09.760
listening to me. Stephen, thank you for the invitation to and of course your

05:10.960 --> 05:16.880
your companionship over the years. We've been speaking for a long time. So I'm Dr. Mike Yead.

05:17.680 --> 05:25.760
I would describe myself as a career life scientist. I trained in biochemistry and toxicology, my first

05:25.840 --> 05:33.280
degree. That was an unusual training in that. There were a couple of professors at university

05:33.280 --> 05:37.760
who had specialised in understanding how it is mechanistically at the molecular level.

05:38.320 --> 05:44.080
People can be damaged by certain environmental chemicals, insecticides and so on. So they're

05:44.080 --> 05:50.400
interested given birth to a course and I was a beneficiary. So I call that mechanistic toxicology.

05:51.280 --> 05:57.280
I'm English or don't like bragging, but it's worth saying that university awarded me

05:57.920 --> 06:03.440
the first class honors degree that was head and shoulders higher than any other person had

06:03.440 --> 06:07.360
been awarded from the faculty at the time. So I must have been doing something right.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.560
It was a four year undergraduate training and I spent a year in the scientific civil service,

06:14.560 --> 06:22.400
half of which was at the UK's top secret chemical defence establishment at Porton down,

06:23.440 --> 06:30.960
which used to be and is still now in my view, a biological weapons facility of some kind.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.920
And I did a little bit of research there whose objective was to help protect

06:36.640 --> 06:43.840
British and allied troops from organophosphorous enough agents in a small way.

06:44.640 --> 06:51.920
Then I worked at the forensic science headquarters in order master next to the atomic weapons

06:51.920 --> 06:57.120
for 17. I learned lots of analytical techniques from very clever scientific civil servants.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.640
And at the end of that year, I resolved not to join scientific civil service because

07:02.640 --> 07:09.840
they all they all sounded very bored and and frustrated. So but I always wanted to do applied

07:09.840 --> 07:16.080
work. And so I started to take a PhD. I was offered to be sponsored by the MOD, the same people who

07:16.080 --> 07:22.720
had employed me for a little while as an undergraduate. And I did a very quick PhD and I started

07:22.720 --> 07:29.680
finished, wrote it up and passed the Viva in exactly 36 months. And it was on the effect of

07:29.680 --> 07:36.800
opiates on respiratory function. So I was looking at central and peripheral actions of

07:36.800 --> 07:44.640
of opiates like morphine on various components of the respiratory reflex. And the goal was to see

07:44.640 --> 07:51.120
whether we could separate the receptors involved in pain relief from those involved in cardio

07:51.120 --> 07:58.800
respiratory depression, bad news is we couldn't. But I used an interesting technique or two,

07:58.800 --> 08:05.760
which I was able to take into into industry. And it most importantly, it taught me the scientific

08:05.760 --> 08:11.840
method of reading into a subject, trying to join the dots, thinking of unanswered questions that

08:11.840 --> 08:18.160
were worth answering to formulate them, convert them into experimental plans, and then gain agreement

08:18.160 --> 08:23.120
for those and then go and do them, trying not to drop tubes on the floor and missing the time

08:23.120 --> 08:29.120
points and so on. So I did a three year course, I learned three year PhD and learned how to do

08:30.160 --> 08:35.920
the scientific the scientific method as we as we know it. And then straight away after that,

08:35.920 --> 08:41.840
I joined, I took, I've taken two big jobs in so-called big pharma. So the first seven years,

08:41.840 --> 08:50.480
I was at the welcome research labs, which were then acquired by Glaxo to form eventually Glaxo's

08:50.720 --> 08:59.360
line. And I only now realized what how important that was. And that was probably an event on the

08:59.360 --> 09:04.560
timeline of the plans, believe it or not, to the event we're living in now. Why do I say that? Well,

09:04.560 --> 09:10.960
it's because it liberated an enormous amount of capital, which was used to start the, really,

09:10.960 --> 09:17.680
to fund the welcome foundation. And I believe the welcome foundation is one of a triumvirate of

09:18.640 --> 09:23.920
bodies which have corruptly altered the direction of biology research in the world for the last 30

09:23.920 --> 09:30.880
years. Anyway, so I left welcome. And I was recruited, actively recruited by a head of pharmacology

09:30.880 --> 09:37.920
there who'd seen me give a speech, said, you know, we would like to expand a respiratory drugs

09:38.640 --> 09:43.920
research group here at Sandwich and Kent, we'd like you to come. And I interviewed, loved it,

09:44.000 --> 09:51.120
and I stayed 17 years, and in addition to growing the group and working with over 200 people,

09:51.120 --> 09:54.080
we produced a lot of experimental medicines that were still in progress

09:55.120 --> 10:02.080
at 2011 when the company closed the entire facility. At the time I left, I was worldwide head of

10:02.080 --> 10:07.120
research for allergy and respiratory diseases for Pfizer, which at the time was the biggest

10:08.000 --> 10:15.200
research based drug company. So it means I didn't get to make all the decisions,

10:15.200 --> 10:20.960
but I was expected to have an opinion about everything in my area. And I loved it. It's

10:20.960 --> 10:29.120
really, really good fun. Having left in 2011, I worked very hard to see if I could find other

10:29.120 --> 10:35.600
people interested in the drugs that we in progress that Pfizer was running just to put in the skip,

10:35.600 --> 10:42.080
the dumpster, because they were liberating cash and reducing their internal research footprint,

10:42.080 --> 10:47.200
just in parentheses, all drug companies have realized they have no idea how to

10:47.920 --> 10:54.080
industrialize the process of drug discovery. It's more an art than the science. The methods

10:54.080 --> 11:01.280
you have to use to evaluate things are scientific, but the idea is as much art as anything else.

11:02.160 --> 11:08.320
And I did have the privilege of meeting professors to James Black, who invented both beta blockers

11:08.320 --> 11:14.400
and H2 antihistamines back in the day when those things were considered valuable. And although

11:14.400 --> 11:18.640
those drugs might not be wonderful now, he was a pretty smart guy and I think honest,

11:18.640 --> 11:25.440
and I learned a lot from people like that. So I tried to find new owners for the work I had

11:25.520 --> 11:31.440
been doing. And I was really pleased that it was mostly acquired by the world's second largest

11:31.440 --> 11:37.200
in Eric's company called Mylan, who on the basis of the work I had been doing formed

11:37.200 --> 11:43.440
the UK subsidiary and acquired almost everything. So the people went across and got jobs,

11:43.440 --> 11:49.120
the work continued, and I'm proud to say they launched the products. So I wasn't completely wrong,

11:49.120 --> 11:56.400
Mr. Pfizer. The bits they didn't want, I didn't think about doing anything with them, but for the

11:56.400 --> 12:05.040
first year, having left Pfizer for 2011 to 2012, I was just very lucky people contacted me and said

12:05.040 --> 12:09.440
we'd like you to consult if you'd like to do a day a week or a day a month, whatever it was.

12:09.440 --> 12:15.840
So I started building a little portfolio of consulting clients that were all startups,

12:15.840 --> 12:22.560
all biotechs, mostly in the US. And that happened probably because for 10 years at Pfizer, I did

12:22.560 --> 12:27.760
a job that nobody wants to do, which was to review the external environment for any

12:27.760 --> 12:33.520
in-licensing or acquisition opportunities. Pfizer was like lots of companies, as I mentioned earlier,

12:33.520 --> 12:40.160
was realizing they could not invent drugs internally at the rate required to feed the machine and all

12:40.160 --> 12:44.560
the implied growth rates that Wall Street wants to hear. So it's like, what are we going to do?

12:44.720 --> 12:50.400
It's like, okay, get these scientists if they can't invent stuff to run the radar on everybody else's

12:50.400 --> 12:56.960
smaller companies and so on. And so there were two or three deals I did that learned, I think,

12:56.960 --> 13:02.480
about 10 billion in revenue. So I had to be very persistent. So that taught me persistence

13:02.480 --> 13:08.320
right up to the board level. And the particular example was Pfizer formed a relationship with

13:08.320 --> 13:14.480
Berlin or Lindelheim for a drug called Spareva, which at the time of identification was in early

13:14.480 --> 13:21.840
phase two trials. So I thought that that's a good drug. I think it is. And so anyway, I proved

13:21.840 --> 13:30.080
influential, I could and persistent really. And it's because I kept reviewing things. I reviewed

13:30.080 --> 13:38.240
100 opportunities, 97 of which we declined. So it's not fun. But what I did, and I didn't realize

13:38.320 --> 13:44.160
it at the time, is I was getting a live teaching on how not to do biotech, and when it worked,

13:44.160 --> 13:52.160
how to do it. So when I left Pfizer, I got invited back to consult to some of these folks who'd

13:52.160 --> 13:56.400
started another company saying, you know, you were helpful. A couple of them over coffee said,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.440
what are you going to do with all the stuff that's going to get thrown away? And I said,

13:59.440 --> 14:05.360
no idea. And they said, well, you should spin those assets out. And I had no idea. But anyway,

14:05.360 --> 14:10.560
within a couple of weeks, I'd formulated an idea that, yeah, I could probably do something

14:10.560 --> 14:16.800
with those compounds. So I got together a small team, went to see someone senior advisor, said,

14:16.800 --> 14:22.560
I said, if I raise some private capital, will you at least in principle agree to negotiate

14:22.560 --> 14:29.520
to assign those patents to me? And they said, yeah, 18 months later, I came back with a six million

14:29.600 --> 14:36.000
seed of investment from San Francisco, it's an answer there. And Ziaco was born. And I led

14:36.000 --> 14:43.520
his CEO and we grew up to 25 staff raised about 40 million US dollars, ran a clinical trial,

14:43.520 --> 14:49.280
which was unbelievably positive. We converted a drug that was intended for asthma to a drug

14:49.280 --> 14:54.960
that could be used in atopic dermatitis, a disease of inflammation and itch in the skin for which

14:54.960 --> 15:02.960
there were no oral treatments. And it looked fantastic. And within a few months, Novartis,

15:03.760 --> 15:08.800
the big Swiss drug company acquired my little company for an obscene amount of money.

15:09.920 --> 15:14.880
I only had a little shareholding at that time, but it was enough to retire and I did. That was 2017.

15:16.160 --> 15:24.800
So I was enjoying early retirement when what I call COVID era began. And I think quite

15:24.800 --> 15:28.320
early on, I thought I was very frightened, like most people, you were intended to be.

15:29.120 --> 15:34.960
But I noticed, this is very important, I noticed significant public figures on the television

15:35.600 --> 15:40.240
that I knew because I've been around so long that, for example,

15:40.240 --> 15:45.760
Sepatric balance was a former colleague at welcome over 30 years earlier. So I slightly

15:45.760 --> 15:51.840
knew these people and I noticed that he wasn't telling the truth. So sometimes I spotted him

15:51.840 --> 15:57.040
saying things I knew were not true and I knew he knew them because we'd trained in the same

15:57.920 --> 16:03.200
university ecosystem at the same time. So I thought, why are you lying? Once she spots

16:03.200 --> 16:09.440
someone's telling a lie, you pay a lot of attention. And then there was talk of lockdowns and I kind

16:09.440 --> 16:16.000
of knew this was nonsense. I'll put it to people that for it not to be nonsense, you have to believe

16:16.800 --> 16:22.960
that people without symptoms, that is well people can give a disease they haven't got to other people.

16:23.520 --> 16:29.520
Now, that isn't very likely as it's and it didn't happen. But when you, and I've gotten in the

16:29.520 --> 16:36.560
other thing to say is, it's quite complicated, that I did used to believe in the germ theory model of

16:37.520 --> 16:42.960
acute respiratory diseases. So I don't anymore, but at the time I did. And so I thought, well,

16:42.960 --> 16:48.000
this is crazy. The people who are the best sources of infection are the people who were ill and the

16:48.000 --> 16:53.680
people who were ill already at home or in hospital. And the well people can't infect other people.

16:53.680 --> 17:00.480
So lockdown is stupid. And I started reading the pandemic preparation plans of all countries I

17:00.480 --> 17:06.080
could find starting with UK and then Germany and then France and America. None of them mentioned

17:06.080 --> 17:12.400
lockdown. And it was illogical. And so I said to my wife, something horrible is happening.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.600
So what do you mean? I said, there are all the countries are talking about making a stay at home

17:17.600 --> 17:22.960
and explain to why it was mad. And she looked very concerned. I said, I'm really, really concerned.

17:23.760 --> 17:28.800
And on the day, our then Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, I'm sorry to have to tell you,

17:28.800 --> 17:33.840
you must stay at home. Apparently I was racing up and down the stairs all evening, muttering,

17:33.840 --> 17:39.840
we are in so much trouble. And I knew we were. I didn't know what the hell was happening. But

17:39.840 --> 17:45.680
I knew that something serious was happening. And let me put it to you, ladies and gentlemen,

17:45.680 --> 17:53.440
the only way all the countries of the world pretty much would do the same stupid thing that I knew

17:53.440 --> 18:00.640
was helpless and was not in their plans would be if there was a super national plan,

18:01.280 --> 18:07.520
super national force above those countries. I knew that that evening. I had no idea who they were.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.400
And that's true. They didn't decide to do it on their own. Someone told me to do it.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.680
There's no way they could have independently all decided to do a stupid thing that was out

18:17.680 --> 18:22.560
with their original plans that had been put together by, I think, sincere care for people.

18:23.280 --> 18:28.400
So I knew already in March something was happening. I didn't know what. At the time, as I've said,

18:28.400 --> 18:35.440
I thought that acute respiratory diseases were caused by submicroscopic infectious particles

18:35.440 --> 18:42.400
called viruses. I no longer believe that. And what we'll cut to the chase, all I believe that a

18:44.240 --> 18:52.000
I believe that a fake emergency has been strung up sprung upon us. I didn't think that early on.

18:52.800 --> 19:01.360
But probably in 2021, I encountered Professor Dennis Rancourt or Denis Rancourt. And he had done

19:02.080 --> 19:10.240
a week by week analysis of all cause mortality separately in each of the 50 US states. And

19:10.240 --> 19:17.280
he'd been doing it for some time, before the pandemic. And so he started publishing in the

19:17.280 --> 19:26.640
summer of 2020, saying in no, in no state looking at people dying in terms of sex, age, and data

19:26.640 --> 19:31.840
death. When I, when I do the plots, he said, I see no, there's no sign of anything happening.

19:33.520 --> 19:40.160
Up until the moment when a pandemic was declared, whereupon, you know, the world went mad and

19:41.840 --> 19:47.200
around. So I didn't know, but I now know there was, there was nothing happening prior to the

19:47.200 --> 19:52.320
declaration of a pandemic. And I think that means there wasn't one. So it doesn't matter to me

19:53.040 --> 19:58.880
if there was a virus or not a virus. There wasn't any public health emergency. I think that's

19:58.880 --> 20:05.120
the thing to focus on. There wasn't any public health emergency. And yet the world went crazy.

20:05.120 --> 20:11.680
We were locked down. We made the way it wear masks, wash our hands, keep social distance,

20:11.680 --> 20:17.760
close most businesses, unless they were essential, not do international travel. In some countries,

20:17.760 --> 20:25.200
closed schools and universities, everything went remote. It's like, that is so destructive

20:25.200 --> 20:32.480
on two fronts. It's, I'm enough of an economist to know that if you do that, every country that

20:32.480 --> 20:40.320
does it will go bankrupt. You can't, you can't fund an economy by borrowings for months to years

20:40.320 --> 20:46.240
and not have unbelievably serious consequences seriously. I personally think all the countries

20:46.240 --> 20:53.440
of the world are technically bankrupt and have been kept going by agreement with the central banks

20:54.480 --> 21:00.880
over led by the Bank of International Settlement in Switzerland. So I think they've agreed,

21:00.880 --> 21:07.040
you're all broke, but we'll keep it going. So financial damage was one. There were

21:07.040 --> 21:12.080
individuals at the national level in damage and currency. Also individuals were bankrupted.

21:12.480 --> 21:20.640
And then of course, the third main factor was social dislocation. People whose lives were

21:20.640 --> 21:25.280
only kept meaningful because they were interacting daily with people who mattered to them, became

21:25.280 --> 21:31.280
depressed. And I'm sure many of them died. Humans don't like isolation anymore than if you put a

21:31.280 --> 21:35.200
dog on its own and the can will leave it for a few months, it will probably be dead, even if you feed

21:35.200 --> 21:41.600
it every day. And humans aren't very different. So I believe there was not a public health emergency

21:41.600 --> 21:47.520
one was faked using lies, propaganda, and this wretched piece, the artist, whether or not there

21:47.520 --> 21:54.000
was a virus is irrelevant as there wasn't a public health emergency. And then there were economic

21:54.000 --> 21:59.840
damage, which at the country level, individual level, and a social destruction level. But where

21:59.840 --> 22:06.800
I really come in, and where I think I stand alone, which is very shocking, what I'm going to tell

22:06.880 --> 22:11.760
you, what we know, what I'm going to tell you that it is in, in my opinion, the other, another

22:11.760 --> 22:18.720
of the objectives of this fake pandemic was to incentivize over five billion humans on the planet

22:18.720 --> 22:24.960
to roll their sleeves up to receive an injection of a material that was designed intentionally

22:24.960 --> 22:30.400
to, to get injured kill and reduce fertility. Now, a lot of people have got upset to me with me

22:30.480 --> 22:36.400
when I've said this, I point out my entire career has been in the business of rational

22:36.960 --> 22:43.200
drug design working with colleagues. I put it to you that with the exception of natural products

22:43.200 --> 22:49.600
that can be purified from a source, every synthetic drug, everything that's in a tablet or bottle or

22:49.600 --> 22:54.480
sprayer cream, every atom in there is in there because someone decides to put it in there.

22:55.200 --> 23:01.920
And you only put things in there because they serve a function. And coming right down to the

23:01.920 --> 23:08.000
level of the design of a molecule, it could be a beta blocker or a steroid or this macromolecule,

23:08.560 --> 23:13.840
we're told called modified mRNA, that every single part of it is there for a reason.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.680
And so in a sense, I can virtually lean over the shoulder of the designer, look at the structure

23:19.760 --> 23:30.160
and think, what were you, what were you up to? And I can name, and I will, at least three features

23:30.160 --> 23:37.600
of these molecules, which as a 35 year veteran of this industry, I am certain would not have

23:37.600 --> 23:45.040
gone forward if this was like a drug I was involved in. And I know of other people who have identified

23:45.040 --> 23:50.880
two further mechanisms. So what I'm saying, I'm going to justify that there are multiple

23:51.520 --> 23:59.520
independent designed in toxicities in these injections. And before I describe them, I will say that

23:59.520 --> 24:09.200
with Dr. Wolfgang Vodag, I wrote an open letter to the European medicines agency before any of

24:09.200 --> 24:14.160
these products have, quote, authorization. So we couldn't know what the profile was.

24:14.880 --> 24:21.760
But I detailed, not all of them, but I detailed the ones I thought of at the time, saying, for

24:21.760 --> 24:28.400
good mistake, you know, disease, if you inject millions of people with this, these are the kind

24:28.400 --> 24:33.600
of things I anticipate will happen. Well, they ever will happen. They have all happened.

24:34.320 --> 24:42.000
And more, I hadn't thought about cancer. So I'm going to describe three things that are

24:42.000 --> 24:48.800
blindingly obvious. And then I think what I'll do is I'll stop and take questions on the whole thing.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.400
I recently wrote an open letter to the Metropolitan Police,

24:55.840 --> 25:00.080
and it's on my sub stack. If you look up, Dr. Mike Eden, sub stack is the only

25:00.080 --> 25:05.840
article where a friend of mine said I should put it out there. And in that letter,

25:06.720 --> 25:13.200
I more or less laid out what I've just said so far, who I am, the backdrop, and the awful

25:14.400 --> 25:20.400
allegations. So the three things I'm going to pick out, and there are many more, but these,

25:20.400 --> 25:28.080
I think, are so, I think, I think you can't deny these. So number one, if you express, if you

25:28.080 --> 25:34.880
force a human body to manufacture something that doesn't belong in the human body,

25:35.600 --> 25:43.040
it will be non-self or foreign. And that's what these products do. They provide a genetic instruction,

25:43.840 --> 25:50.800
messenger RNA, it says, please glide into these cells and tell the cells to do what the instruction

25:50.800 --> 25:57.680
is, which is to make whatever is encoded. If you do that, I believe based on simple

25:57.680 --> 26:02.000
immunological principles that have been known for at least 60 or 70 years,

26:02.720 --> 26:11.040
that every cell that does that will mark itself now as foreign. Your immune system plays nice

26:11.040 --> 26:17.040
with itself most of the time, unless you ill, because your immune system is constantly

26:17.040 --> 26:21.440
traveling around your body, T cells and so on, sniffing and sniffing and sniffing, and it keeps

26:21.440 --> 26:27.760
spotting, yep, that's my, yep, that's my, yep, that's my, oh, what's that? And if it finds a cell

26:27.760 --> 26:34.320
that no longer is displaying the sort of, I'm one of you, symbols, your immune system goes to war,

26:34.320 --> 26:40.240
attacks it and kills it. This happens in at least two ways. One is if you get an infection,

26:41.840 --> 26:47.520
and no matter what kind, your immune system will notice something is wrong and it tends to save

26:47.520 --> 26:54.000
you from it by launching a lethal attack on the cells and tissues, doing that non-cell thing.

26:55.360 --> 27:03.360
So what I'm saying is it's axiomatic, that is must follow. If you inject someone with mRNA,

27:04.400 --> 27:11.360
encoding anything other than approaching that belongs in you, you will trigger autoimmune attack,

27:11.360 --> 27:16.160
and depending on the dose and the distribution and how long the stuff persists, you could get,

27:16.560 --> 27:21.840
mild symptoms or it could kill you, but it will not be good and it will happen every time with

27:21.840 --> 27:26.960
everybody, it's just a question of whether it would be seriously bad or not, and that will

27:26.960 --> 27:33.520
depend on, as I say, dose, distribution and your luck. So that's the first thing. It's the wrong,

27:33.520 --> 27:40.400
it's the wrong approach. What do I mean by that? If you wanted to make a vaccine and I'm really

27:40.400 --> 27:47.520
now not happy with with vaccinology at all, but if we just go along with the original narrative,

27:47.520 --> 27:53.600
if you wanted to do that, you wouldn't do it this way, you would do anything else, you know,

27:53.600 --> 27:59.920
extract the pathogen and whatever, show that to your immune system. I know that doesn't work,

27:59.920 --> 28:06.320
but that would have been at least what people expected. So why does this technology exist at

28:06.320 --> 28:11.360
all? Dr. Rawen alone, I think, had patents for its invention. Why does it even exist?

28:11.360 --> 28:16.240
Well, originally, I think people just wanted to know if you could do it, and perhaps that's where

28:16.240 --> 28:22.560
Dr. Malone's PhD research or postdoc research came in, but I remember hearing about it 15 or 20

28:22.560 --> 28:27.680
years ago in Pfizer, and it was presented to me with a perfectly sound rationale, which I'm just

28:27.680 --> 28:35.360
going to briefly explain. It was the idea was that you could use the destructive power of your

28:35.360 --> 28:43.440
immune system to kill tumors that you couldn't get to with surgery, so-called non-resectable

28:43.440 --> 28:50.240
tumors, so like a certain brain tumors. Most tumors have unique markers on their surface,

28:50.240 --> 28:55.200
they are deranged, but they identify themselves with a different postcode on their surface.

28:55.760 --> 29:04.480
And so if you could direct an mRNA sequence to that postcode and inject it, it will mostly go

29:04.480 --> 29:09.280
to that tumor, and your immune system will then kill it. I don't know whether it works,

29:09.280 --> 29:13.520
but the idea is rather beautiful. As a drug discoverer, I thought, yeah, that's pretty clever,

29:13.520 --> 29:20.640
and it's called immuno-oncology. It is a division of many drug companies. There are biotechs

29:20.640 --> 29:29.760
funded to do this stuff, so it does have a potential use, but if you give it to healthy people and

29:29.840 --> 29:35.280
you force them to express something that doesn't belong in their body, it cannot help them.

29:35.280 --> 29:40.160
It's hopelessly inappropriate. It feels still like we're at number one. That's number one.

29:40.720 --> 29:46.800
Number two, I've only got three. Number two, it's not just making your body make something

29:46.800 --> 29:53.200
that doesn't belong in you. The question is, what did they choose to ask or to make your body

29:53.200 --> 30:00.720
manufacture? They could have picked anything from this so-called virus, the so-called SARS-CoV-2,

30:01.280 --> 30:07.120
to which apparently we have the sequence. So they could have had the messenger RNA

30:07.840 --> 30:15.120
in code and make your body make any of the bits of that. So I put it to you. The rule of thumb would

30:15.120 --> 30:22.800
be, don't make it make your body make something you know is dangerous. The only known dangerous

30:23.200 --> 30:29.200
protein in this material, I don't know whether the virus is real or not, but I know the sequence

30:29.200 --> 30:35.440
exists, and if you convert that sequence into protein, the only bit that we know is poisonous

30:35.440 --> 30:41.360
is the so-called spike protein. It is of a nature for which there was much literature,

30:41.360 --> 30:46.320
published literature in the peer review journals to show that these were kind of venom-like

30:46.320 --> 30:51.360
proteins that would activate blood platelets and certainly would stimulate blood

30:51.440 --> 30:58.000
calculation. They were toxic to cardiac muscle, and they altered damaged neuronal transmission.

30:58.640 --> 31:04.640
And so not only do we have a technology that forces your body to make something foreign,

31:04.640 --> 31:09.920
and I told you and no one has told me I'm wrong, that that will make your immune system

31:09.920 --> 31:14.720
think it's invaded and attack your own tissue and destroy it. So the only way your body can save

31:14.720 --> 31:20.880
you from that perceived infection or tumor, as I say, tumors are the other things that causes

31:20.960 --> 31:25.440
this derangement, and your body probably saves you from a tumor every other day, that you never

31:25.440 --> 31:31.360
knew you had from like a solar gamma ray went through you, damaged your DNA, your immune system

31:31.360 --> 31:38.800
noticed a deranged cell and killed it. Good job. But not only do these materials force your body

31:38.800 --> 31:44.240
to make non-self proteins, which will lead to this autoimmune attack, but your body is now making

31:44.240 --> 31:50.560
something which I knew and I can point to the literature, it makes something analogous to

31:50.560 --> 31:56.560
things already proven as toxins. Or guess what? My guess is, you know, depending on where it went

31:56.560 --> 32:02.400
in your body after injection, how well it was taken up, how efficiently it was converted to protein,

32:02.960 --> 32:09.200
and how long that went on, which frankly is a perhaps a lottery for every single individual,

32:10.240 --> 32:14.880
you could get blood clots, you could get heart injury, you could get neurological conditions,

32:14.960 --> 32:20.080
and you're all of those, didn't you folks? And they were predictable, because they follow

32:20.080 --> 32:24.400
from the design choice. And the last one I'm going to mention, there are many more, but I think

32:24.400 --> 32:32.320
three is powerful because they're different and so obvious, the third one. The mRNA products,

32:32.320 --> 32:40.240
Modena and the Pfizer-BioNTech, were formulated. What does that mean? Usually the drug substance,

32:40.240 --> 32:46.240
the actual active, is tiny, often so small you can't see it, it might be milligrams or even

32:46.240 --> 32:53.520
micrograms, you have to bind it up with fillers and, you know, things to to bulk it up so you can

32:53.520 --> 32:58.880
make a tablet or a spray or an ointment or an injection. And that whole process is called

32:58.880 --> 33:05.280
formulation. So you take the drug substance, the thing you've invented, and then clever people in

33:05.280 --> 33:11.600
pharmaceutical sciences work out how to stabilize this molecule, how to make sure it's pure,

33:11.600 --> 33:16.640
that it's stable, that it'll be released when it needs to be and so on and so forth. It's very,

33:16.640 --> 33:23.200
very complicated, not my skill area, but I learned quite a lot about formulations in the respiratory

33:23.200 --> 33:29.840
side. So when I looked at this formulation, the formulation is lipid nanoparticle, so it's a

33:30.160 --> 33:35.440
kind of grease, but it's a particular kind of grease formulated in a particular way. And so I

33:35.440 --> 33:40.960
saw, well, yeah, I can see why you would protect this vulnerable genetic material in this blob of

33:40.960 --> 33:45.840
lipid when you inject it. The lipid will help it just slide through the wall of a cell,

33:45.840 --> 33:49.920
straight through the wall of a, it'll go all around the body, that's what it's designed to do.

33:50.720 --> 33:57.600
So when I was looking it up, when I stumbled upon a 2012 paper, and I read it with mounting

33:57.600 --> 34:05.520
horror, because lipid nanoparticles is one of a category of sort of macro molecule, that means

34:05.520 --> 34:11.920
large molecule carriers, transporters, vehicles. So they've been in use for quite a while,

34:12.480 --> 34:19.200
and it was well known to people in the pharmaceutical science, the formulation end, that these particular

34:19.200 --> 34:25.760
macro molecules lipid nanoparticles have a propensity that is are inclined to accumulate

34:25.760 --> 34:32.800
in the ovaries of every species tested to date. And so I thought, well, I'm a toxicologist.

34:32.800 --> 34:38.480
I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that if you have an observation in your top studies,

34:38.480 --> 34:43.040
toxicology studies, you're not allowed to ignore it. You have to assume that that's what's going

34:43.040 --> 34:49.680
to happen in humans unless you've got data to show it doesn't. So I am now faced with a formulation

34:49.680 --> 34:55.520
of horrible material, which I think is going to damage people by an autoimmunity and a direct

34:55.520 --> 35:02.000
toxicity that's going to accumulate in their ovaries. Then some enterprising person wrote to

35:02.000 --> 35:08.560
the Japanese regulator, and under their Freedom of Information Act, was able to obtain studies,

35:08.560 --> 35:16.320
you know, distribution studies of the finance products. And we translated it from the Japanese.

35:16.400 --> 35:22.000
They had studied its injection distribution, I think, is either in rats or mice. And guess what?

35:22.000 --> 35:30.640
It accumulated in their ovaries as predicted from the literature. So these are not accidental.

35:30.640 --> 35:36.880
The choice of mRNA is dangerous to healthy people. Its original use was immuno-oncology

35:37.840 --> 35:44.480
for people who are beyond saving by chemo or surgery. I've got second thoughts about a lot of

35:44.480 --> 35:50.080
this stuff. But then the spike protein, it's analogous to materials known to be toxic to human

35:50.080 --> 35:57.120
cells in the mainland cells, and they made your body make it. Finally, they formulated a material

35:57.120 --> 36:04.000
already known by people in the industry to lead to accumulation of the payload in the ovaries,

36:04.000 --> 36:10.960
where it will do the two things I just mentioned. So I'll tell you a couple of other things.

36:11.760 --> 36:18.800
The most common reason drugs fail in development. Two most common reasons. One is they don't work.

36:18.800 --> 36:26.640
You know, medical hypothesis was wrong. You put it in people with itchy red skin, and you put it

36:26.640 --> 36:30.720
in a vehicle group and a test group and it's blinded and so on. It's all done properly. That was the

36:30.720 --> 36:35.920
single experiment we did in my biotech. You break the blind and damn it, they're both the groups

36:36.080 --> 36:41.440
of the same. You drive them down anything. So that's why it was so miraculous when ours did work.

36:41.440 --> 36:46.000
But that's the most common outcome. You're wrong. We're not clever enough to work out what's going

36:46.000 --> 36:51.920
to happen. And that's one of the reasons why the industry is it's not just failing. It's failed.

36:51.920 --> 36:57.920
It can no longer, it can't make profit anymore. It's a dead industry. I don't think there'd

36:57.920 --> 37:02.320
been any significant new products that I personally would have been happy to have got behind.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.640
There's something one million pounds anymore. I have to work out what's going to happen.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.200
And that's one of the reasons why the industry is actually it's went properly. That was the

37:11.200 --> 37:18.800
thing that you put it in people with itchy red skin, tooth formulated, and material already known by

37:18.800 --> 37:25.440
people in the industry to lead to accumulation of the payload in the ovaries, where it will do

37:26.000 --> 37:31.680
the two things I just mentioned. So I'll tell you a couple of other things.

37:33.360 --> 37:39.840
The most common reason drugs fail in development. Two most common reasons. One is they don't work.

37:39.840 --> 37:46.000
You know, medical hypothesis was wrong. You put it in people with itchy red skin,

37:46.880 --> 37:50.720
and you put it in a vehicle group and a test group and it's blinded and so on. It's all done

37:50.720 --> 37:55.280
properly. That was the single experiment we did in my biotech. You break the blind and

37:55.440 --> 38:00.000
damn it, both the groups are the same. You drive and die anything. So that's why it was so

38:00.000 --> 38:05.200
miraculous when ours did work. But that's the most common outcome. You're wrong. We're not

38:05.200 --> 38:10.160
clever enough to work out what's going to happen. And that's one of the reasons why the industry is

38:10.160 --> 38:17.040
it's not just failing. It's failed. It can no longer, it can't make profit anymore. It's a dead industry.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.440
I don't think there'd been any significant new products that I personally would have

38:21.440 --> 38:26.320
been happy to have got behind. You know, they're like one million pound a patient,

38:27.280 --> 38:32.560
cancer, biologicals, which I've looked at the data and they might give you a month. I don't even

38:32.560 --> 38:38.400
trust the clinical data now. I think they cheat. So I think they're now at a point where they've

38:38.400 --> 38:43.600
got enormous financial resources and they can't make money in the normal way and whatever. And I

38:43.600 --> 38:48.640
think this is one of the motivations for what's happened is it's between an enormous income for

38:48.720 --> 38:54.720
the pharma companies. But I was going to say that's one of the two main reasons why we fail.

38:54.720 --> 39:00.080
One is we're wrong in the medical hypothesis and the drug simply doesn't work. Now, sometimes

39:00.080 --> 39:05.200
you get a chart and another chart because a different hypothesis comes up and you find a use.

39:05.200 --> 39:11.840
So the classic example is Viagra. Its original use had been to relieve angina by relaxing blood

39:11.840 --> 39:17.840
vessels in the heart and it didn't do that. People did not report improvements. But the famous use

39:17.840 --> 39:23.200
that eventually was discovered was it dilates blood vessels in the penis and helps men have

39:23.200 --> 39:29.360
bigger erections and billions of dollars were made out of it. So you were wrong. They were wrong

39:29.360 --> 39:33.600
in the medical hypothesis, but another medical hypothesis was able to make use of the drug because

39:33.600 --> 39:40.000
it wasn't obviously unsafe. But the other reason drugs fail is because they're toxic. There we go.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.920
Either in people or, you know, in multi dose studies in rats, dogs, monkeys, whatever is required.

39:45.920 --> 39:51.040
So I'm very sorry if there are people who are philosophically set against the intersection

39:51.040 --> 39:56.640
and I do understand that I grew less and less comfortable with that as I got older. Nevertheless,

39:58.480 --> 40:01.760
someone has to be as it were at the guinea pig and I don't want it to be people.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.200
So the main, the second main reason and it's extremely common, unfortunately, is that

40:07.200 --> 40:14.000
for reasons we were not able to anticipate the drug when taking the required dose for long periods

40:14.000 --> 40:19.120
of time, if it was a chronic drug produced unacceptable tops, unacceptable side effects.

40:19.680 --> 40:25.360
So with the first one, medical hypothesis being wrong, my god, you would be grilled.

40:25.920 --> 40:30.800
Like you need to explain your medical hypothesis. What's the evidence supporting that? Is the

40:30.800 --> 40:35.600
counter evidence? What were your peers doing? You know, how quickly could we test the hypothesis?

40:35.600 --> 40:42.560
It was people all over it and rightly so. The second one, everyone got a shot at it. What do I mean?

40:43.360 --> 40:46.640
Before you nominate as a compound, we literally would have

40:47.760 --> 40:53.840
like all hands meetings and your job was if you've been in the industry, you may have an opinion,

40:53.840 --> 40:58.800
you may spot something about the design of that molecule that twiggers a thought where you think

40:58.800 --> 41:05.440
I've seen that before and it led to kidney toxicity in 1978 or something. So we would go

41:05.440 --> 41:10.240
over these damn things and it was called like a structural alerts meeting after something like

41:10.240 --> 41:14.880
that. Each drug company will have its own process because what you don't want to do

41:15.680 --> 41:20.480
is five years down the road after 50 million dollars has been spent to find it fails for

41:20.480 --> 41:24.880
toxicity and someone goes, oh yeah, I thought it would do that. So seriously, that's what used to

41:24.880 --> 41:31.440
happen. So I'm saying these products, if they were proper, would have gone through like a structural

41:31.440 --> 41:39.840
alert review or a top's prospects review and anyone like me or anyone who had been hired by me

41:40.480 --> 41:45.520
would have looked at this and thought, no, you can't meet non-self, it'll cause autoimmune

41:45.520 --> 41:50.400
reactions. No, you damn well better not meet their bodies, make that funny spike protein

41:50.400 --> 41:55.440
because that's analogous to lots of venoms. What the hell are you doing using this

41:56.240 --> 42:00.160
macromolecule lipid nanoparticles? Do you not know it's going to accumulate in ovaries?

42:00.160 --> 42:06.560
So I'm promising you this would not have got out of the door. So I'm going to take a long pause,

42:06.560 --> 42:14.000
but just to say, there are at least two other independent mechanisms of toxicity built into

42:14.000 --> 42:18.800
these molecules. I can't name them because I'm not a molecular biologist, but they are apparently,

42:19.440 --> 42:24.800
there's a nuclear localization signal in the sequence, which means it's going to traffic to

42:24.800 --> 42:29.920
your nucleus, which it doesn't need to be in. And what was the other one is that there is

42:29.920 --> 42:35.280
something called, I think it's a partial SV40 promoter. I think that has something that might

42:35.280 --> 42:40.320
be too mixed up bad for oncological reasons. And apparently you would not tolerate either of

42:40.320 --> 42:45.600
these two things in the product. So that's fine. So I'm going to ask you on the call,

42:46.960 --> 42:53.520
having, having heard me describe my history and training, the processes we use, the most common

42:53.520 --> 42:59.120
reason for failure and what we tried to do to avoid it, and my description of what I thought

42:59.760 --> 43:06.000
would cause harms, and the fact that we wrote them down before they were launched. And then

43:06.000 --> 43:13.280
those things happen. I'm going to ask you, is there anyone on the call horrified that you may be

43:14.160 --> 43:20.880
that doesn't think, as I do, that these were designed intentionally injure, kill, and reduce

43:20.880 --> 43:27.840
fertility. So I will stop. Mike, thank you so much. And for those watching the recording,

43:27.920 --> 43:33.920
who didn't get the note, Mike chooses not to have his video showing at the moment because he's

43:33.920 --> 43:39.920
in in holiday mode. So thank you so much for articulating so beautifully. You addressed us

43:40.960 --> 43:45.680
a couple of years ago, and I've kept your notes and again, you articulate so well.

43:46.400 --> 43:51.520
And many of us know that someone who truly understands their craft can articulate complex

43:51.520 --> 43:58.240
ideas in ways that non experts can understand. So I'm very grateful to the way that you have

43:58.240 --> 44:04.240
done that. So my Stephen Frost gets the first 15 minutes and then we've got lots of hands up,

44:04.240 --> 44:11.440
which is wonderful. So and Stephen, Stephen will have far more than 15 minutes. But anyway,

44:11.440 --> 44:22.400
Stephen, are you ready to go? Yeah, so, yeah, Charles, I'm sorry. I want to say sorry for

44:24.080 --> 44:29.360
losing my cooler little before the meeting. I didn't mean to be sharp with people who were

44:29.360 --> 44:36.080
trying to help me, but I was just trying to concentrate on what I thought I knew was the

44:36.080 --> 44:43.040
correct thing to do and what you also agreed most of the time at least. So I didn't mean ill

44:43.040 --> 44:48.640
towards whoever I snapped at, but I was really under pressure in my mind. Sorry.

44:52.400 --> 44:58.320
As far as your presentation, Mike, it was just brilliant. And

44:58.640 --> 45:06.160
if there were two people born for this crisis, I think you are one of them. Oh, three, maybe.

45:06.160 --> 45:18.000
A secret back to you is another and Archbishop Vigano is another. So I agree with you on everything

45:18.000 --> 45:28.160
you've said. You're so, how shall I say, precise in your use of English? You're maybe shy, but you're

45:28.160 --> 45:34.960
incredibly articulate. And the last one was Archbishop Vigano. And you're always

45:34.960 --> 45:38.400
or is it Begano? I don't know. But a lot of people, of course, including me now,

45:39.040 --> 45:46.240
think that what we need to solve this nonsense, these Trojan horses for totalitarianism

45:47.040 --> 45:54.880
is a spiritual element and that doesn't always involve logic as I'm told. I agree. I absolutely

45:54.960 --> 46:01.440
agree. And I used to be embarrassed in saying what I'm going to say because I'm a scientist

46:01.440 --> 46:10.720
and this isn't science. But in the summer of 2021, I had an encounter.

46:14.160 --> 46:22.080
And I think I took from this encounter an instruction to do what I'm doing. That was it.

46:22.080 --> 46:27.360
No promises. It was like, you have to do this. Good for you. I mean, I was already committed,

46:27.360 --> 46:33.440
but it was there. And also, it had been a terrible time in the previous, as I started to discover

46:33.440 --> 46:39.360
what I've described to you, which I hope I haven't been too cool about. I fell apart because I'd

46:39.360 --> 46:46.960
been a normie until 2020. I listened to the BBC for 41 years. I got the Sunday Times every

46:47.040 --> 46:52.240
Sunday for about 25 years. I kind of believe roughly what I was being told, bits gets

46:52.240 --> 47:01.200
glibbering out again. So to follow the data, as I did, so my head was following and my soul was

47:01.200 --> 47:08.000
screaming. I describe it as psychological whiplash. I think I probably had a mini breakdown by the

47:08.000 --> 47:15.280
end of the year. And I was climbing out of it again, past very, very dark thoughts. And then one night,

47:15.920 --> 47:21.840
something appeared. And it was like, more or less, here's a handful of courage to get on with it.

47:22.400 --> 47:27.520
And I've never felt frightened since that moment. And that was it. That was God. That was God.

47:28.160 --> 47:33.280
Good for you, Mike. Yeah. So I don't know whether you can remember, because at the time, I now

47:33.280 --> 47:40.240
realize you were really psychologically tortured into a corner. And so was I. And I didn't, I thought

47:40.240 --> 47:44.960
we were immune from this psychological torture. And I happen to think, Mike, and I think you

47:44.960 --> 47:50.000
should know this, because you're British as well. I want to hold these bastards to account. And I

47:51.200 --> 47:55.760
I'm also giving information to the police. I wrote to the police. I haven't published it.

47:55.760 --> 48:00.800
Maybe I should, but I kept it very, very tight so that they couldn't gainsay what I'd said to them.

48:01.680 --> 48:06.880
But I think, you know, your letter is absolutely brilliant. Someone was saying to me the other day,

48:07.600 --> 48:14.320
trying to draw my attention even more to your letter. And I will have a look at it again. But

48:15.360 --> 48:22.080
so, Mike, the terrible thing in the United Kingdom is that actually it appears to be better

48:22.960 --> 48:30.000
than in France. And the other countries, you know, which had had hard measures, should we say,

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
an inverted comment, which were never just because there was never any pandemic. There

48:34.000 --> 48:39.760
wasn't even a disease called COVID-19, in my opinion. It wasn't properly diagnosed. And I'm

48:39.760 --> 48:46.960
and that's one of my strong points to the police, because I am a medical doctor. And even if no

48:46.960 --> 48:54.160
one in the world agrees with me, I have a right to a medical opinion. No, you do. Yeah. And I don't

48:54.160 --> 48:59.200
approve it beyond reasonable doubt or beyond the plans of probabilities as in court of law.

48:59.760 --> 49:06.480
And I don't have to, as a scientist, do enormous numbers of randomized controlled trials,

49:06.480 --> 49:12.560
double blinded or whatever. So, but I'm trained as a doctor and my duty is to diagnose

49:13.520 --> 49:21.360
for the patient in the best way possible using all my experience and all my hopefully good

49:21.360 --> 49:26.160
training. And somehow or other, I think I did get a good training because when I was training,

49:27.040 --> 49:32.240
we were told that, you know, even if you believe in viruses, which I'm not sure I do now,

49:32.800 --> 49:39.600
I'm pretty sure I don't, you know, everybody's throwing the viruses out with the bath water,

49:39.600 --> 49:48.560
cause a pandemic. And I was fascinated by that. So, and I can't remember the name of the professor

49:48.560 --> 49:56.960
who taught us this. But I remembered it. And I found out Christmas is a time for me writing

49:56.960 --> 50:01.440
an email to all the people I qualified with and challenging them. And guess what, Mike?

50:01.440 --> 50:05.200
I can't get a single person I qualified at Liverpool University with

50:06.880 --> 50:16.320
to engage with me, even privately, even people I shared flats with. They're that terrified of me.

50:17.280 --> 50:25.200
That's the thing that I have to say that's made me. So, I think I've recorded something like 250

50:25.200 --> 50:30.400
interviews, something like that. And I would just comment actually, it's important for me to mention

50:30.400 --> 50:38.160
in case anyone's listening for the first time. It's no use googling. Dr. Mike Ye, don't please

50:38.160 --> 50:45.120
don't use Safari, Google, whatever they are. Don't use the mainstream search engines or at least

50:45.120 --> 50:51.200
don't only use them. In fact, I invite people, there's a very interesting experiment I did

50:51.200 --> 50:58.400
yesterday is that it's still valid. Most people, including me, I thought that browsers or search

50:58.400 --> 51:04.960
engines were pretty much a generic function. You type in what you want to find and they find it

51:04.960 --> 51:09.440
for you. I didn't understand how it did it, but they're all about the same, right? Well, they're

51:09.440 --> 51:16.320
not. If you type Dr. Mike Eden into Google and then just have a look at the first two or three

51:16.320 --> 51:23.440
pages, you'll find that I'm a very famous anti-vax conspiracy theorist. And you'll find articles

51:23.440 --> 51:30.320
from Reuters saying how wrong I am about all sorts of things. If you type Dr. Mike Eden into

51:30.320 --> 51:37.280
minority search engines of which there are dozens, like something called Mojik, M-O-J-E-E-K,

51:38.000 --> 51:43.680
or Yandex, Y-A-N-D-E-X. If you put a Dr. Mike Eden in any of the small ones,

51:44.320 --> 51:50.880
you get hit with about 50 of my presentations. How interesting. Now, that can't happen unless

51:50.880 --> 51:58.720
someone has decided to filter the... It's not an algorithm. Most people will get because the most

51:58.720 --> 52:05.120
people will use mainstream browsers. It's not an algorithm. You see, it's just a switch that they

52:05.200 --> 52:09.680
flip. If they don't want you to see giga-ome biological, they just flip the switch and it's

52:09.680 --> 52:15.200
not there on the front page. If they don't want people to find Mike Eden, it just won't show up.

52:15.200 --> 52:21.200
It's not a special algorithm. It's a switch. It's an if-then statement. It's basic programming.

52:23.280 --> 52:28.720
And that's the part about it that they want you to think is AI and an algorithm and it's a

52:28.720 --> 52:34.240
black box. We don't really understand, but they can tweak it a little bit. It is not. It is just

52:34.240 --> 52:42.000
very, very simple. If they want everybody on the right that watches Fox News to see

52:42.000 --> 52:48.560
Robert Malone this week, it's done. They just flip that switch. They just add him to that box

52:48.560 --> 52:52.880
and that box and that box and then it goes wherever they go. It's not some magic thing that they have

52:52.880 --> 52:59.680
to know exactly how to tweak the formula. They just have to click a checkbox on his...

53:00.160 --> 53:06.080
I mean, it's that simple. That's the reason why Elon Musk bought the platform X in the first place.

53:06.080 --> 53:12.400
It wasn't to restore free speech. It was to be the controller of it, to be the guy who could

53:12.400 --> 53:18.560
flip that switch and then also go around saying that it's AI and algorithms and stuff like that

53:18.560 --> 53:25.600
and bots. It's simple. The illusion is to try and make you believe that it's a complex thing

53:25.680 --> 53:31.600
that you can't really blame on anybody. It's not. It's really simple. They lie to you on purpose

53:31.600 --> 53:38.560
and they can game the system so that you're not heard and then you can't see the extent to

53:38.560 --> 53:44.080
which you can't be heard. It seems like everybody can hear you. I mean, I can see all the people in

53:44.080 --> 53:49.680
the gym. I can hear my voice echoing in the gym, so I guess everybody can hear me, but that's not

53:49.760 --> 53:56.320
what the internet does. It's an illusion. Mike's seeing it now too and it's exciting because the

53:56.320 --> 54:04.000
more people that see it, the more people we will be there. And what you find lies about me.

54:05.440 --> 54:11.440
Why would someone go to the effort of lying about me and hiding things I have actually done?

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
And I think the answer is obvious. They don't want you to hear from me. Why would they not want you

54:16.000 --> 54:22.560
to hear from me? It could be because I'm telling the truth. It seems to me in a elaborate piece of

54:22.560 --> 54:29.680
work that they would do that. And of course, they may get rid of it now. I've pointed it out. But

54:30.560 --> 54:35.360
I would say that's sort of thing that's quite useful. You can show someone on their own phone

54:36.000 --> 54:40.400
and you ask them beforehand, what would they expect to happen? It should be roughly the same,

54:40.400 --> 54:45.360
right? Because if it's not, what uses a browser is you're just going to get a random garbage.

54:45.360 --> 54:49.040
So it should be roughly the same. It's not even roughly the same.

54:50.480 --> 54:56.400
Anyway, so one of the reasons people have said to me, oh, my sister in Australia,

54:56.400 --> 54:59.680
who thinks I'm a conspiracy. So you can find the rest of this video,

54:59.680 --> 55:05.120
they said. You said it's true, Mike. Why haven't they killed you? I've got a perfectly good answer.

55:05.680 --> 55:11.040
They need to do this. Let me give you that link. If the person lives in the modern technological

55:11.040 --> 55:17.840
world, they have the IT tools that serve the same purpose. They can censor and smear you.

55:17.840 --> 55:22.480
I want to end this stream on a different note because I do think I have another message to send.

55:22.480 --> 55:25.520
It's those listening. This is the full video there. I can see it.

55:25.520 --> 55:28.240
I think I cannot reach further than I have done.

55:30.160 --> 55:35.120
It's not defeatist. Every now and again, we travel. So we'll be in say Heathrow.

55:35.120 --> 55:41.680
So he's saying, he's kind of feeling like the system has limited the extent to which he can

55:41.680 --> 55:47.360
get his message out and he's given 250 speeches and he's tired of it. And I don't totally, I can't

55:47.360 --> 55:52.800
possibly imagine how tired he would be. He was in front of the parliament in the UK at some point

55:52.800 --> 55:57.520
thinking that if he just spoke up, everything was going to be fine and it wasn't. So if anybody

55:57.520 --> 56:02.640
has been staring at the alien for longer than him, I don't know who it is. Maybe Wolfgang Lodach.

56:03.600 --> 56:07.440
But it sounds like to me, according to that description, that when he realized that people

56:07.440 --> 56:12.000
were going to lock down and that there was no going back from it, everybody was committed to it.

56:12.000 --> 56:20.160
He was scared. That sounds like a real story to me. And I got to respect him a lot for telling it.

56:20.160 --> 56:25.120
I felt like that was one of the most honest and that's what it is. Just like Mark Twain said,

56:25.120 --> 56:29.520
if you don't tell lies, you don't have to remember anything. And it feels very much like

56:29.600 --> 56:34.800
Michael Eden does that quite regularly. Now when you get him, he gets a chance. He tells

56:34.800 --> 56:41.360
it as truthfully as he possibly can. Because the moment you start pulling punches, the most

56:41.360 --> 56:47.520
perceptive of your listeners can feel it. And I've been trying to use that strategy as well.

56:48.320 --> 57:02.000
I want you to listen to the bad ideas. Remember we talked about what Peter Thiel said with regard

57:02.000 --> 57:08.080
to these bad ideas and the propensity to be able to lie and exaggerate. And this is how he

57:08.080 --> 57:16.800
thinks things are done. I noticed something interesting when I was looking up listening to

57:16.800 --> 57:22.800
Stephen Hatfield on a recent Tommy podcast. And I was actually listening to it because I wanted

57:22.800 --> 57:29.440
to review this time segment where apparently he said that Robert Malone did not have a vaccine card.

57:30.720 --> 57:42.400
And so while I was reviewing that, I was also looking him up on Amazon because Tommy mentions

57:42.400 --> 57:47.520
that Stephen Hatfield has a book or it's his first book and the book is called

57:47.520 --> 57:49.840
Something. And so I look to see if Amazon has it.

57:51.840 --> 57:54.880
It's Tesser rubbish. It's junk.

57:57.280 --> 58:01.440
Community mayors are spent. And so what he's saying there is that the tests are rubbish.

58:01.440 --> 58:05.520
Okay. So what he's now going to say is that community mayors spend a lot of money on it.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.880
And then he's going to describe a test that we should have used instead. Now keep in mind,

58:08.960 --> 58:14.880
this is narrative. This is narrative recapitulation. And at the same time, we know that we've seen

58:14.880 --> 58:19.840
a video on our own stream. We watched it where he talks about Barney needs to be in a mask so we

58:19.840 --> 58:25.040
convince kids to like little tiny kids to wear a mask. And the idea that if your kid gets sick,

58:25.040 --> 58:29.760
you should wear an apron and booties when you go into their room. This was an extraordinary

58:29.760 --> 58:36.640
interview early on in the pandemic. And this is a guy who released a book in 2019 just before

58:36.640 --> 58:41.680
the pandemic started about the inevitability of a pandemic. And so I wanted to order that book.

58:41.680 --> 58:46.800
And I looked down there and in his in his little about the author, it says,

58:49.360 --> 58:57.360
if you can see my my thing here, he served as a course developer and senior lecturer for the

58:57.360 --> 59:01.200
hospital provider section of the non Luger domestic preparedness program,

59:02.000 --> 59:08.320
which basically means that he did some private contracting for what would be the organization

59:08.320 --> 59:16.160
that would become DITRA, right? DITRA, this organization that Mark has made a pretty cogent

59:16.160 --> 59:22.000
argument for the possibility that DITRA might be more State Department than DOD, or at least

59:22.560 --> 59:28.720
it has its feet in both places. And so cannot be really considered a DOD asset per se,

59:29.440 --> 59:36.240
but some kind of bridge organization between a lot of these agencies. Now, that's pretty

59:36.240 --> 59:42.160
curious because again, remember that I believe another person very high up in DITRA, at least

59:42.160 --> 59:47.840
at the start of the pandemic was David Hone and David Hone and Robert Malone go way back.

59:48.800 --> 59:55.200
So then Robert Malone and and Stephen Hatfield doing a couple three episodes of the Tommy podcast

59:55.200 --> 01:00:05.360
becomes less surprising if they share some colleague in histories with the the whole DITRA

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:15.200
organization, which is curious, right? So let's hear let's hear Stephen Hatfield describe

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.440
the the testing and how silly the testing was. And then let's listen to him describe his trip to

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:30.080
Rome with Robert Malone. His tests are rubbish. These tests are rubbish junk junk.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:38.720
Community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap trying to screen their employees

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.640
and their nursing home sounds like he's been doing too much for something that's not going to turn

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:50.480
positive for a week, even though you're infectious. I said, dude, you gotta you need these capture

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:55.280
antigen things where you're not looking for antibodies. You're actually looking for the virus.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:03.760
So they're expensive. But the antibody is what's on the membrane, the antibody specific to the

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.360
COVID virus. Now, remember, oops, ships. And I had my mouse in the right place. Remember

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.120
that antibodies at the start of the pandemic became a much less valuable commodity and a lot more

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:28.000
difficult to declare as intellectual property. And I think that Mark has and I have made a

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.120
reasonable argument that this probably played a role in the evolution of the response to

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.880
whatever it was that we were responding to because there might have been more motivation and more

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.320
products based on monoclonal antibodies in their use and diagnostics had the patenting of monoclonal

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:57.600
antibodies not been legally encroached upon by a a Supreme Court decision which cited this

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:04.880
Yale Law School review titled the antibody patent paradox. So kudos to Mark again. So let's listen

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.200
to him describe what we should have used as a test, which is a more expensive version of a lateral

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.400
flow, but now looking for antigen instead of yeah, well, that's what they wanted. That's that's it.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.200
Positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.040
I said, dude, you gotta you need these capture antigen things. Dude, you need these looking for

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.120
antibodies. You're actually looking for the virus. Dude, dude, they're expensive. But the

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:40.000
antibody is what's on the membrane, the antibody specific to the COVID virus. So patient sample,

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.280
mix it up, but the whole virus is coming through. And if it latches one of them,

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.840
another antibody comes through and it turns color. So the funny thing is, is that that guy

01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:00.400
Lieber, I think it was that was selling like nanotechnology to the Chinese at $50,000 a year

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.920
at Harvard or wherever he was Columbia. The technology that he was selling were chips

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.520
that could identify different biomarkers that were flowing over them. Oh, isn't that an

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.800
interesting parallel here? Isn't that an interesting funny parallel here? Yeah, right. Come on guys,

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.280
let's wake up and apologize to our children soon so that we can pull our heads out like the

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:32.880
pregnancy test kit. The first one of these I saw, we 2021, we had to go to Rome to speak to the

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:42.720
Italian Senate. And I'm not vaccinated. I don't have a card. Neither to Dr. Malone.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.360
He didn't have a card. So we're raising help. So they're going to take us to see the

01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.720
Senate doctor. 2021, we had to go to Rome to speak to the Italian Senate.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:12.080
And I'm not vaccinated. I don't have a card. Neither to Dr. Malone. He didn't have a card.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.080
So yeah, I know you can't come in the out. So we're raising hell. So is this a mistake?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:27.440
Because in 2021, Robert Malone said he got the shots so that he could travel.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:37.280
So the only way this would jive is if they went to Rome before June 2021. Because in June of 2021,

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.400
and maybe even earlier, he was telling people that he took two shots partly to travel and partly

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:50.000
because he was told that long COVID might be cured by it. And he had long COVID. I think that's

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.880
really important because anybody that claims they have long COVID and is an MD, I gotta say,

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.360
I don't buy it. I don't believe you for a second.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.600
Because we all know that chronic fatigue syndrome and pots and all this other stuff

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.920
was around before the pandemic and nobody took it very seriously.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.280
Sometimes people were even laughed out of out of medical practices. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.840
the idea that Robert Malone had long COVID and then took two shots in order to travel and maybe

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.760
even because he was so you heard rumors that it might help with long COVID.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.640
There's no other way to interpret that because in the same out of the same mouth comes a description

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:42.320
of how we knew that this kind of technology wouldn't work. So we gave it up. And I stopped

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.240
working on it and worked on Enovio's electroporation.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.600
So it's really extraordinary if you see this. It's either a chronological anomaly that he

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:02.640
can say that Robert Malone didn't have a vaccine pass when Robert Malone in his coming out party

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.120
claims to have had a vaccine pass specifically to travel. But Hatfield says that when they went

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:14.240
to Rome to talk to the Roman Parliament, he didn't have a Vax card because he's not vaccinated.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:15.600
And they

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:27.360
and the funny thing is, is that Robert Malone didn't have didn't have a card either, right?

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.600
I'm sure I'm just mistaken. I'm sure I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, right?

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:50.000
So they're going to take us to see the the Senate doctor. He's got these little rapid flow

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:59.360
can and it rips it open and I'm I'm reading this thing antigen test kit, not antibody antigen,

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:07.840
the protein on the it's testing for spike protein. And it's accurate. And it's as accurate as the

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.120
PCR test would have been if you ran into the CT of like 30.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:21.920
So wait, why can he just say that? It's as accurate as the PCR test if you ran the PCR test at like 30.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.480
So again, sometimes we ask questions, sometimes we're given answers to implied questions. And in

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.400
this case, Tommy and his listeners are being given an answer to an implied question, which is how

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.720
are the PCR test used? Were they accurate or not accurate? And then they're given the answer that

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.680
the media has given them before and social media has slipped in before, which is that if you cycle

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:54.400
them right, they're pretty accurate. And then not only that, he's telling you that accuracy,

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.680
the fidelity of those PCR tests is actually pretty equivalent to a lateral flow test looking for

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.960
the antigen, which are more expensive, what we should have used and what they used on him when

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.240
they didn't have a vaccine card and went to Italy to speak to the parliament. What a

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:18.560
spectacular enchantment that he's casting here. Filled with answered questions, filled with models

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:26.720
of reality that have nothing to do with reality, but have such implicit assumptions in them that

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:36.080
that Tommy can't even hear them. It just washes over him like one big mythology blanket that he

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:45.360
can keep his legs warm with while he plays video games between podcasts. Let's listen to this part

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:52.640
now. Again, this is at the end of this last video. We had to go to hern's color, you get like the

01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:02.320
pregnancy test kit. The first one of these I saw, we, 2021, we had to go to her own to speak to the

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:14.800
Italian Senate. And I'm not vaccinated. I don't have a card. Either to Dr Malone. He didn't have a card.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:22.240
So yeah, I know you can't come in the out. So we're raising hell. So they're going to take us to

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:29.920
see the Senate doctor. He's got these little rapid flow can and it rips it open. And I'm

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:39.440
reading this thing, antigen test kit, not antibody antigen, the protein. It's testing for spike

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:47.520
protein. And it's accurate. And it's accurate. As the PCR test would have been, if you ran it at a

01:09:47.520 --> 01:10:03.360
CT of like 30. But before I left, I had to get a test. And they were still running at 40. The CDC

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:12.400
never put the word out. You know, you got to run it at 30. Or it's just a shambles from the word

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.680
go mate. Honestly, mate, I never seen such incompetence anywhere in my life.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.040
It's like Al Bundy was running everything.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.440
Excuse me. What'd you say?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:38.560
Have you seen the badge? No. Oh yeah. I've got a pen, a lapel pen. Yeah.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:46.080
COVID-19. That's what it says underneath. He's got a lapel pin, he says. He's got a lapel pin,

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.240
he says. Interesting. Isn't that what has he got a lapel pin that says? What's he got a lapel pin

01:10:52.240 --> 01:11:01.680
that says? He says he's got a lapel pin that says this. COVID-19 with the C word. Isn't that what he's

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:10.320
saying? What a strange thing to say. Isn't that interesting? Isn't that an interesting thing to

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.840
say? I find that very interesting for him to say that because it's really co-opting what we have

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.320
all been saying for a very long time when I've been wearing a jacket for three years that it says

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.000
it multiple. Actually, I have green and red patches like that. It's really amazing. They are

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.840
going to absorb every little piece and try to make it a part of their limited spectrum of debate

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.160
so that everybody possible can be pulled inside of this little egg of nothing and never question

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.720
the basic public health narrative. And this guy's not going to do it. Nobody's going to do it.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:50.720
Imagine this guy is in a bubble suit in a photograph just like Shenxie Lee was conveniently in a

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.760
photograph in a bubble suit. Have you ever thought about whether or not the photographer that's

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:05.840
taking a picture of the people in the bubble suits is also in a bubble suit? I guess the bubble suit

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:11.520
implies the existence of something very dangerous in that little epindorf. And if I put that bubble suit

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.160
on and held that epindorf in my hand and then I threw that epindorf at you what would your reaction

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:23.600
be? Do you see how powerful these these these images are and how ridiculous it is that this

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:34.240
fireside chat with a geriatric virus hunter should not be taken seriously

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.400
with a guy who seems to have been there at the start of Ditra.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.880
I don't know ladies and gentlemen I'm not feeling it anymore I'm not feeling it anymore with this

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:58.320
dude because this dude is like way too entangled in in in dramas and in stories and that Barney video

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.120
where he says that you should wear apron and and face mask and footies when you have a sick kid

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.560
this guy is part of it he is cooperating to enslave our children please come on

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:20.720
because that's what it was left-handed know what the right hand was doing

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:30.320
um and I mean shot dr. Shaw he's going well well what sensitivities should it have

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.800
why are you asking me you're the one with all the scientists and labs

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:44.400
I shall let you use common sense don't you think it should just be as accurate as a pregnancy test

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.520
kit yeah or you're going to have some college girl jumping off the top of the dorm building

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.640
because she's got a false positive test yeah who jumps off the top of a dorm building when they're

01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:01.920
pregnant holy shit what is that what kind of statement is that to make and then you're saying

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:09.920
that a pregnancy test because of the way that it works is is very accurate and that a COVID test

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.440
should be just as accurate but do you see the the ridiculous bait and switch there that apparently

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:23.920
Tommy's not sophisticated enough to see one is an antibody against an a hormone known to be present

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.760
or not present in the urine of pregnant women

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:40.880
the other purports to be an antibody that is specific for a circulating RNA that's not known

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:48.400
to be present in the respiratory tracks of humans but is supposedly there for the first time ever

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:56.640
starting out at a point and now found almost everywhere but that bait and switch is so fast

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.640
those shells move so quickly Tommy and his listeners don't stand a chance even when this guy's that

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:10.400
old and that decrepit he still can do it maybe because he's totally enchanted himself and actually

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.720
believes the nonsense that he says maybe he does believe the worst case scenario was narrowly

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.000
avoided it's possible i guess but i so much doubt it

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:31.600
i so much doubt it there might be a little bit more left yeah don't you think

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.480
so they brought in uh

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.880
uh when was this video i will find it i can find it i can't remember that i'm sure

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.600
somebody already put it in didn't they already put it in the chat from national cancer institute

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.640
yeah so it's uh i'm going to open it another in another copy the current address and then i'll

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.760
put it over here i think it's uh oh gosh why can't i see my cursor

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.680
it's uh let's see

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.240
no that's not what i want i want this

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:23.200
sorry i'm looking it up this is from this podcast is from June 7th of last year i presume

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.400
so it's it's eight months old i mean this this is part of the you know the scooby-doo is still

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.680
going on it's still going on now but this was really in the heart of last year so last summer

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.480
um it was probably in that string of of robber Malone you know robber Malone and Hatfield

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.720
robber Malone and Hatfield's all those things um

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.200
so the reason why i brought us here an odd last name like that yeah oh yeah that's right he started

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.760
test yes people started to start sharply where was the FDA they're supposed to be testing things

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.720
why are you handing it off to NCI so i found this interesting because actually he says that some

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:11.840
guy at the um the national cancer institute uh i mean it's just so bizarre

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.080
the national cancer institute

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.600
was what is it sharpless i think so i'm sorry i gotta get it up in my history again because i don't

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:34.640
don't have it all there where is this dude sharpless there it is let's open that in another

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.960
so sharpless is the guy that he just mentioned and what he says is that it's really strange that

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.880
the FDA the CDC wasn't doing the testing but they passed it off to the NCI this guy the head of

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:55.120
the national cancer institute at the during the pandemic used to be the professor of medicine

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.520
and genetics at the University of North Carolina isn't that interesting he also acted as the head

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:12.000
of the FDA between the current dude and and uh what's his name maybe it says it over here yes

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.560
Scott Gottlieb he's also interested of course in aging and finding a way to measure molecularly

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:29.120
measure a aging in T lymphocytes oh my gosh and look who he paired up with some other lady who

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:35.440
also works on aging so you can see the transhuman people here right she's working on the major

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:42.720
histocompatibility complex so this is all about immune recognition of epitopes it could also be

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.480
very closely related to what epivacs was doing where you could look at and look for epitopes

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:55.360
that could activate and would activate antigen presentation it is extraordinary how tiny the

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.640
ip window is in which all of these people are involved now if you just throw in a few other

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.880
things like the fact that he passed through massachusetts general hospital which is

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:11.760
harvard's hospital which is where will insky was and and and and so many of the others uh

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.680
mirtha was there the data fiber cancer institute i mean come on ladies and gentlemen do you see

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:26.640
it they're all protecting the same giant lie that they need us to give all of our medical data up

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.920
all of our sequencing day all of our sequence data they need to give up all we need to give up

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:38.400
all of our molecular data that they can possibly collect and they don't want ours they want our

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:45.120
grandchildren's and so they need to separate us from our kids so that our kids trust them more

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:51.280
than they trust us and then they're gonna eventually convince our kids with one or two more crises

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.320
that this is the only thing that we can do you got to turn it all over to us that's where i think

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.040
this is going that's what i think this is all about these people want to be part of the ruling

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:07.600
class and so they are willing to throw out all truth in order to get on that boat they want to

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.440
be on the elite train when the when the airplane stop flying they want to still be able to fly when

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.640
the when the five course meals are all gone they still want to be able to get them when the when

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.440
the really big fancy parties are thrown on yachts they still want to be invited that's what this is

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.400
all about if we want to crack it i think we need to start to understand how models are supposed to

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.880
be used to generate knowledge how models are supposed to be used to make predictions that

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.960
can be verified by measurement and if we start to understand how jeff and and greg glassman

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.240
and and stove and these people who who understand this matt briggs have been trying desperately to

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.360
wake people up to this understanding and we start to bring people to understand this philosophical

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.920
difference between hypothesis falsification and knowledge generation we're gonna get very far

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.760
because these kinds of magic spells won't work us a work on us anymore because we will see this

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.160
for a model of reality and then we will use it to make predictions and if those predictions won't

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:15.360
don't come true then we will discard it rather than reiterate it over and over again even though it

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.960
can't make predictions that can be validated it can't make predictions about measurements in

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:26.160
the future that can be validated therefore this is a terrible model it's not a valid model of the

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:33.680
immune system a terrible model of the immune system would make some predictions and this is a terrible

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:38.800
model of mother nature where there exists pandemic potential in bad caves and in laboratories and

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:46.880
in stitching it's a terrible model because what it predicts doesn't happen what it predicts about

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:51.840
our immune system doesn't happen what it predicts about the fidelity of these viruses doesn't happen

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.280
what it predicts about what we should find in these infected people it doesn't happen that's why we

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:04.320
saw that video yesterday they were there looking down on the on the huge preparation area where

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.440
they were butchering chickens by the hundreds and exclaiming how much virus is down there and

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.680
how those people are just swimming in it and then moments later they're down there with no mass

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:19.680
standing there watching them themselves knowing that bird flu kills 50 to 60 percent of the people

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:29.120
that are infected and that walking contradiction that that idea that that scientists can have models

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:36.640
of reality in their head that are not verifiable in common sensical every day experience and yet

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:43.280
somehow or another they still use them to formulate grants and to give talks and to expound as a

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:52.160
professional authority it is absolutely extraordinary and that the spread of these bad ideas is much

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:58.000
scarier than the the molecule that they tell us has gone around the world that that came from a

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.840
bad cave that might have come from a laboratory that they first found in a bad cave

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:11.680
we can't let this lie become the truth we cannot pass this on to our children ladies and gentlemen

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.000
we can't let these people pass it on to our children and this is the idea they're trying to pass

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.840
on to our children that there was a novel virus it killed millions of people the millions more

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.760
were saved from it it's likely gain a function and gain a function will that means it'll come

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:33.200
again so transfection better be good next time please ladies and gentlemen don't take that seriously

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:40.880
i really hope that you enjoyed the little show i've got to go upstairs and get my kids ready

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.680
ladies and gentlemen please stop all transfections and humans because it was criminally negligent

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:53.440
as mike eden mr sparkle obviously can explain better than most of us can they want to eliminate

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.240
the control group they want to eliminate the free thinkers um and that means that more than

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.080
ever you need to understand these three things and spread them among your family and friends

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.080
