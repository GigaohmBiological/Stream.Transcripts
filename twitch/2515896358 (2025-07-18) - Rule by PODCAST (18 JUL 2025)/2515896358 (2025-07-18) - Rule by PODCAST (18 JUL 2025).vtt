WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:18.607
and we're supposed to oppose it and we're supposed to fight the instinct that we all deeply have embedded in our system but we also know is wrong like what is it about the system everything and you know you're all MAGA or if you're on the left you're blue no matter who you're in a cult

00:19.167 --> 00:24.530
You're in a cult people get into cults and why is that like why is that a part of if we are in a simulation?

00:24.650 --> 00:45.143
why are we so malleable is it because we recognize it and we're supposed to Oppose it and we're supposed to fight the instinct that we all deeply have embedded in our system But we also know is wrong Like what is it about the system everything and you know, you're all maga or if you're on the left you're blue No matter who you're in a cult

00:45.703 --> 00:51.069
You're at a call people get into cults and why is that like why is that a part of if we are in a simulation?

00:51.189 --> 00:52.831
Why are we so malleable?

00:53.391 --> 00:56.995
Is it because we recognize it and we're supposed to?

00:57.556 --> 01:02.241
Oppose it and we're supposed to fight the instinct that we all deeply have in

01:15.282 --> 01:29.030
We'll get our hands here in a second.

01:29.110 --> 01:35.674
Here we go.

01:35.774 --> 01:37.215
Set.

01:37.355 --> 01:39.056
♪♪ No waves, no beats.

03:03.539 --> 03:03.799
Hello.

03:35.998 --> 03:36.247
calls.

04:47.318 --> 04:52.965
The Lancet led to the censure of anyone on social media who mentioned the possibility of a lab leak.

04:53.466 --> 04:54.066
It can't be true.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.769
The Lancet says it's not true.

04:55.789 --> 04:57.931
27 eminent scientists say it's not true.

04:59.253 --> 05:01.936
Only a few scientists in the face of all of this dare to speak up.

05:02.964 --> 05:04.445
One of them was called Gilles Dumeneuve.

05:05.006 --> 05:07.307
He formed a group of researchers called DRASTIC.

05:07.467 --> 05:13.332
That's an acronym for Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team, something that all scientists should be.

05:13.352 --> 05:15.774
Jamie Metzl, the former NSC official, soon joined the group.

05:16.494 --> 05:23.980
Almost immediately, as early as April of last year, it was becoming clear to Metzl that the lab leak theory was not a conspiracy theory.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.061
In fact, it was plausible.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.038
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

05:31.858 --> 05:36.562
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

05:37.643 --> 05:39.145
It's like a marble statue.

05:39.305 --> 05:42.568
Problem with experts even when they're, you know, the good guys.

05:44.249 --> 05:46.571
She's literally trying to raise a smile there.

05:51.630 --> 05:54.232
Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole.

05:54.272 --> 05:55.353
I think of them as good guys.

05:55.373 --> 05:57.075
They've been always outspoken about this.

05:57.735 --> 06:00.538
The problem with... None of that is over.

06:00.618 --> 06:03.040
And it's Sasha Latipova who pointed out this morning.

06:03.060 --> 06:03.901
Sasha Latipova.

06:03.921 --> 06:05.342
L-A-T-Y P-O-V-A.

06:05.382 --> 06:06.403
Sasha Latipova.

06:06.463 --> 06:07.324
Sasha Latipova.

06:07.364 --> 06:07.944
L-A-T-Y P-O-V-A.

06:07.964 --> 06:08.945
Sasha Latipova.

06:09.165 --> 06:11.027
None of that is over.

06:11.147 --> 06:13.449
And it's Sasha Latipova who pointed out this morning.

06:21.287 --> 06:22.768
but you can tell if someone's lying.

06:23.428 --> 06:25.190
You can sort of feel it in people.

06:26.991 --> 06:27.711
And I have lied.

06:27.891 --> 06:28.752
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:28.772 --> 06:29.692
I don't want to lie.

06:29.712 --> 06:31.534
I don't think I'm a liar.

06:31.654 --> 06:32.694
I try not to be a liar.

06:32.714 --> 06:33.555
I don't want to be a liar.

06:34.135 --> 06:36.837
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

06:41.983 --> 06:44.185
Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.486
This guy's been talked about for years.

06:47.107 --> 06:51.069
You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.052
And are people still talking about this guy, this creep?

06:59.895 --> 07:01.636
I had my volume set a little funny there.

07:03.459 --> 07:04.099
Darn it, I couldn't.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.541
I think truth is good for kids.

07:05.961 --> 07:09.804
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.905
We want everybody to feel good.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.267
That's not the way life is.

07:16.048 --> 07:18.330
Hey, no email from Fearla today.

07:18.370 --> 07:23.794
That can happen because she's in the Netherlands and I forgot to send her a text so that she would send you an email.

07:23.854 --> 07:24.934
I apologize for that.

07:25.535 --> 07:26.796
We're trying to pull this off.

07:27.136 --> 07:29.097
I'm separated by six hours.

07:30.018 --> 07:31.179
Mikey, it's okay, buddy.

08:03.393 --> 08:04.574
I don't care how you get there.

08:04.594 --> 08:07.278
I don't care what you do to get there.

08:07.298 --> 08:09.921
The goal is to win.

08:23.305 --> 08:24.166
Good morning, everybody.

08:24.226 --> 08:24.987
Welcome to the show.

08:25.047 --> 08:30.334
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:31.236 --> 08:35.581
I hope I didn't get a chance to change some of these slides in the beginning here.

08:35.641 --> 08:36.443
I apologize.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.486
It is really true, though.

08:39.506 --> 08:40.768
These are not serious people.

08:40.808 --> 08:44.212
This is what Rule by Podcast looks like in 2025.

08:44.332 --> 08:49.999
So you need to get off of social media or stop using it in the way that you're using it now.

08:50.019 --> 08:51.440
I don't have a good...

08:53.783 --> 09:09.957
I don't have a good, succinct way of saying that yet, but I do have a good, succinct way of saying that autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

09:10.498 --> 09:20.406
And they, in fact, did the same thing with pandemics and gain-of-function and coerced us into teaching these myths to our children, which is the most dangerous part of all.

09:21.387 --> 09:28.112
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, you will also have that same problem.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.014
I'm clipping all over the place.

09:31.235 --> 09:34.757
I gotta turn up my ears maybe, and then it'll be better.

09:35.578 --> 09:36.199
Sorry about that.

09:36.219 --> 09:37.419
Wow, I don't know what's going on.

09:39.617 --> 09:44.079
Anywho, this is GigaOM Biological, the biology they ignore.

09:44.799 --> 09:52.363
You can follow me at gigaombiological.com, but also stream.gigaom.bio, which reminds me, I gotta show you that.

09:53.763 --> 09:59.986
And yeah, it's July and six years ago, basically, we had it right in my backyard.

10:01.286 --> 10:22.575
and now we're here where they've murdered people in Scotland and there is a substack which details it that nobody pays any attention to but you should and you should share it with your family and friends because the truth will set us all free and understanding what really happened understanding the biological signal that was available for them to sculpt with murder and lies

10:23.395 --> 10:45.788
manslaughter and lies then you can better understand how we're here but the only way you're gonna get there is if you stay focused watch this eagle focus on the biology you can see it in this slow-mo he's focused he doesn't need to look where he's going because he already knows where that's going that's automatic he's got a focus on the biology and so if he wants to eat if he

10:46.144 --> 10:49.607
If I want to eat, I think I've got to focus on the biology too.

10:50.188 --> 10:59.716
But right now, it's very interesting because loving my neighbor on the internet has taken on a new form.

11:00.436 --> 11:03.399
I don't think I have to love my neighbor on the internet at all.

11:04.239 --> 11:07.282
In fact, I think a lot of my neighbors on the internet aren't people.

11:08.343 --> 11:10.064
And if they are people, they might be Indians.

11:11.480 --> 11:15.366
How this stream works is that viewers financially contribute to sustain the work.

11:15.406 --> 11:18.451
There are ways to do that on GigaOMBiological.com.

11:18.491 --> 11:19.533
And even more importantly,

11:20.228 --> 11:26.610
More viewers every week consistently spread the word of GigaOM Biological, and this biology finds new people.

11:27.190 --> 11:32.571
We have gotten better and better at saying it, and so it's easier and easier for people to follow along.

11:33.112 --> 11:36.032
So if you could, just send people to GigaOMBiological.com.

11:36.072 --> 11:38.893
I know it's not the handiest thing to spell out or anything like that.

11:39.413 --> 11:43.714
But once we get this done, this is going to be a dam that will definitely break.

11:43.774 --> 11:44.895
There's a link called Stuff.

11:44.955 --> 11:48.956
That's always a good place to send people, as well as the Scooby link at the top.

11:49.716 --> 11:56.480
because the Scooby link is where I confess to being a dumbass for a couple years and explain very well the context of my work.

11:57.021 --> 12:01.363
There you can see some of the links to help support and there's a way you can get on the mailing list there.

12:01.383 --> 12:07.907
It's actually better to just email my wife at... Is that not on there either?

12:07.987 --> 12:09.348
It's not on there right now.

12:09.408 --> 12:09.668
Shoot.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.891
But it is gigaohmhq at proton.me

12:15.672 --> 12:17.874
I'm gonna switch over to the rig here.

12:17.894 --> 12:20.256
Hold on one second.

12:20.956 --> 12:23.898
Sometimes I gotta think about how to do this again.

12:24.819 --> 12:26.981
I started the stream with a different hat on.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.462
I gave it away.

12:28.482 --> 12:31.604
I did not want everybody to see my new hat.

12:32.325 --> 12:35.748
I was very, I am very excited about that new hat, but it's not really...

12:36.630 --> 12:41.795
It's not really an appropriate hat to wear for a stream unless I was outside in the backyard or something like that.

12:42.917 --> 12:46.300
And so I will put my hat on backwards.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.302
Oh my gosh, I forgot to put this in.

12:48.763 --> 12:49.103
Darn it.

12:53.699 --> 12:55.160
I'm just going to skip it for now.

12:55.180 --> 13:00.144
I do want to use it though, so I will probably put it in tomorrow.

13:01.465 --> 13:02.706
Or Monday or Sunday.

13:02.726 --> 13:04.848
Wow, what an exciting day.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.871
I had a lot of weird stuff happen to me overnight.

13:09.652 --> 13:11.914
That happens a lot when you're alone with two dogs.

13:12.814 --> 13:36.602
um and six chickens uh it's strange what goes on in the house late at night what thoughts go through my head what youtube videos get served into my i really have the feeling that the text over there is the wrong font which is very annoying to me so although i love those people over there on that scroll i gotta take that off because it's driving me a little bananas um

13:37.242 --> 13:37.903
That one goes.

13:38.043 --> 13:38.725
Sorry about that.

13:38.825 --> 13:40.848
I just, I don't like that font at all.

13:40.868 --> 13:41.829
I don't know what happened there.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.172
It might be because I updated OBS.

13:43.292 --> 13:43.452
Anyway.

13:46.221 --> 13:47.142
Let me see here.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.823
Let me get this music down.

13:48.903 --> 13:49.483
Good morning.

13:49.523 --> 13:50.263
Good afternoon.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.125
It's actually good afternoon for me here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

13:53.145 --> 13:54.446
Um, good to see you.

13:54.486 --> 13:55.386
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

13:55.426 --> 13:57.187
If I haven't seen you before, welcome to the show.

13:57.647 --> 14:00.129
Thanks for taking the second to look at the stream.

14:00.509 --> 14:03.711
I think you will be pleasantly surprised with what we managed to accomplish today.

14:03.751 --> 14:11.315
It's actually a very interesting day on earth for me because this morning, something, something kind of snapped in place.

14:12.135 --> 14:14.777
Um, something that I'd talked to my friend about before.

14:15.486 --> 14:17.267
I don't know what I got for lighting going on here.

14:17.287 --> 14:18.448
I got the back lights on.

14:18.488 --> 14:19.749
I don't have the windows open.

14:20.350 --> 14:21.931
Um, anyway, you're just gonna have to deal with it.

14:21.971 --> 14:24.693
The camera will probably flicker a lot now because this is overexposed.

14:25.554 --> 14:27.655
Um, anyway, where was I?

14:27.695 --> 14:40.605
Yes, the, the, the, the picture that came clear to me this morning, clear to me is probably a bold statement, but something weird aligned, you know, you're walking around and then all of a sudden you see all these

14:41.105 --> 14:44.570
these things line up and you're like, how is that possible?

14:44.630 --> 14:48.254
Now, you know, that's happened a few times to me during the pandemic.

14:48.294 --> 14:56.845
A few times, you know, people come to my house, people have started texting my wife, people have randomly come out of nowhere to be wanting to be on my stream, etc, etc, etc.

14:56.945 --> 14:57.025
And

14:59.828 --> 15:06.413
Some people consider those all to be coincidences and don't need to be considered as a sum.

15:07.053 --> 15:09.035
Other people call me chemtrail retarded.

15:09.775 --> 15:15.139
Some people just don't talk to me anymore after these years of pandemicking and whatnot.

15:20.623 --> 15:23.845
I have to edit that out in the post cut, right Mark?

15:24.946 --> 15:27.148
So I really think

15:28.351 --> 15:35.373
We need to understand the big picture here, why they're going after the FDA, why this is about the Human Genome Project.

15:35.493 --> 15:37.073
Really, really impressive.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.634
Exactly, a chemtrail savant.

15:40.774 --> 15:51.116
I showed you yesterday this video from 2009 with a bunch of Dutch guys that were sitting around celebrating the first case of the flu in 2009.

15:51.837 --> 15:53.337
And this man in the video here,

15:54.558 --> 16:06.636
I guess it's better you can't see the mouse until it's here, and then the mouse is too small Anyway, the guy in the video right there now in the striped shirt the white striped shirt is actually on Ron Fauchier the guy who

16:09.699 --> 16:15.943
enriched avian flu in ferrets and made it supposedly aerosolized.

16:17.063 --> 16:39.357
These people have all been put in place, given a script with even a research script, things that they should do with their research in order to move these objectives forward and make sure that this mythology is firmly implanted in the academic literature upon which the future pandemic will be based.

16:40.629 --> 16:58.763
And so make no mistake about it, I am suggesting, and I think Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS is also suggesting that this is a very long con, the script, albeit maybe a flexible script that can be updated as discoveries are either found or claims are refuted.

16:59.244 --> 17:05.428
But there is a script here that these people are following and the goal is to invert the

17:06.349 --> 17:13.230
sovereignty of nations and their citizens into experimental animal status, essentially like animal farm.

17:14.471 --> 17:31.034
And so these people having a whiskey toast about the, you know, first case in Nederland, and then at the end of the video, this guy walks through some glass doors and gets a text on his phone that says that they've ordered 35 million doses right here.

17:32.150 --> 17:44.640
And so it seems on the surface to be a lot about the money, but yes, of course, people, the little cogs in the wheel, you know, just like, you know, one gear touches another gear in the watch and that's how the thing works.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.821
Well, yeah, sure.

17:46.021 --> 17:50.885
The gears are a lot of times money, but that does not mean that the design of the watch

17:51.605 --> 17:53.565
is revolving around those gears.

17:53.645 --> 17:56.646
That the idea is, you know, gears, gears, gears.

17:57.266 --> 17:59.326
It's the watch that we need to think about.

17:59.427 --> 18:08.468
And the watch that we're talking about, the plan that we're talking about, wherein money is one of the many kinds of gear mechanisms that work inside of it.

18:08.508 --> 18:15.029
But not only is the idea that we are already in the system.

18:15.089 --> 18:17.230
They already have us using social media.

18:18.018 --> 18:34.291
They already have us paying attention to coordinated liars, sometimes as many as four scripted shitheads sitting around a table in a midday news program every day for the last, you know, going on five or eight years.

18:35.992 --> 18:46.321
And what you are seeing there, ladies and gentlemen, is scripted bullshit, just like this scripted bullshit with Ralph Baric.

18:47.597 --> 19:12.448
It is a long con where the biological mythology, the foundation for which is Ralph Baric and EcoHealth Alliance, was laid down over several years on purpose, was put on 60 minutes on purpose, was put in the start of the new Planet of the Apes on purpose, was part of the script for the movie Contagion on purpose.

19:13.429 --> 19:16.410
And so what we are seeing here is a very,

19:16.892 --> 19:24.817
very detailed, coordinated, long con over many decades, which culminated in this pandemic exercise.

19:24.877 --> 19:38.847
And during the pandemic exercise, there were people that were very aware of our susceptibility to, this is three groups, three scripted shitheads sitting around a table talking.

19:40.108 --> 19:41.789
Mikey, you got to stop barking buddy.

19:43.370 --> 19:45.691
And I might have to shut the door.

19:46.512 --> 19:46.572
Um,

19:47.785 --> 20:01.788
The point is that we have a situation where certain rich people, certain influential people, certain owners of social media and their influential rich friends have realized

20:02.557 --> 20:16.485
that social media could transition to supplant, you know, newspapers and magazines and start to be a force to be reckoned with around the world, especially, shoot, I didn't think he was gonna bark so much.

20:16.705 --> 20:18.265
It must be the mailman or something.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.187
Mikey, what are you doing, buddy?

20:23.668 --> 20:24.309
Knock it off.

20:25.389 --> 20:27.370
I'm gonna shut the door and now you're gonna be alone.

20:27.911 --> 20:28.711
That's not nice.

20:29.792 --> 20:30.212
Come on.

20:38.860 --> 20:44.705
I don't know, well somebody's, they're working across the street, so he's barking and he's downstairs in the garage now, that works a lot better.

20:45.546 --> 20:48.248
Because then he can come in here when he wants to, but now he's marred.

20:48.328 --> 20:48.768
I'm sorry.

20:49.889 --> 20:53.192
It is their job, yes it is their job, I know that.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.975
I tried to invite him in, but he wants to stay out there and monitor things.

20:57.035 --> 21:04.882
So anyway, the point is, is that we have transitioned into a system, by design, because they've realized Alex Karp,

21:06.007 --> 21:12.735
went on 60 Minutes and when he was interviewed he said that he became interested in how people know things.

21:13.495 --> 21:17.039
And a very similar statement was made by Peter Thiel.

21:18.421 --> 21:21.644
And so these people have come to understand that social media

21:22.694 --> 21:25.935
can be used to recreate a very similar thing as this.

21:26.595 --> 21:51.239
If you go on Twitter, on X, or on any of these other social media platforms and you scroll through and you see three consecutive accounts agree on something or say the same thing, or kind of argue, but then come to an agreement at the bottom of the thread, it has exactly the same psychological effect as these three guys having a joyful podcast and agreeing about stuff like the subtleties of the COVID vaccine.

21:52.648 --> 21:58.991
and they have discovered that people are very vulnerable to a group of liars.

21:59.191 --> 22:13.338
In other words, if three people come over to your house and hang out and have a good dinner party, but they're all on a coordinated script to convince you of something, by the end of the dinner party, you will almost certainly be convinced.

22:14.118 --> 22:17.920
And if their script is any good, you'll be convinced way before the end of the dinner party.

22:19.229 --> 22:23.835
because coordinated lying is extremely difficult to see through.

22:26.860 --> 22:30.004
And that's why podcasts are working the way that they work.

22:30.124 --> 22:34.811
And it's very rare that you have a podcaster like me who never interviews people.

22:35.839 --> 22:40.841
a podcaster like Mark who never interviews people because that's not how we are being governed.

22:41.301 --> 22:45.203
We are being governed by what is essentially reality theater.

22:45.223 --> 22:53.266
These guys are pretending not to have a script, pretending not to have any preconceived notions of why they're there and what they want to accomplish.

22:53.346 --> 23:01.749
Even though probably at this time already, they knew they were, they were auditioning to be part of the FDA or at least part of the Maha movement in some way.

23:03.359 --> 23:06.060
And so years earlier, these people were queued up.

23:06.120 --> 23:11.582
And the question becomes, who's got enough money and who's got interest in queuing these people up?

23:11.662 --> 23:16.944
Well, the answer is people like Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk.

23:17.424 --> 23:24.527
People who are interested in making social media platforms like Substack and X relevant on a global scale.

23:25.620 --> 23:29.222
so that the way that people know things can be controlled by them.

23:30.063 --> 23:43.331
And they have very effectively accomplished the melding of the Maha movement with the Maga movement and the election of Donald Trump and putting this, this was all this one script.

23:45.112 --> 23:49.454
And it's hard to kind of feel it, but once you start to really see it, you're going to be kind of shocked.

23:49.474 --> 23:52.796
But that's where I've been going for a very long time.

23:52.836 --> 23:54.758
And then very recently, something just

23:55.836 --> 23:56.836
I just can't believe it.

23:56.876 --> 23:58.797
Like, you know, we have this, for example.

23:59.057 --> 24:05.758
So I saw, I was open to the New York Times and I said, top FDA official overrode scientists on COVID-19 shots.

24:05.798 --> 24:07.058
Oops, sorry, I did that wrong.

24:07.078 --> 24:08.519
I thought to myself, who the heck did this?

24:08.539 --> 24:09.539
That sounds really bad.

24:09.619 --> 24:10.899
I read, first thought was, who did this?

24:11.259 --> 24:11.939
This sounds bad.

24:11.959 --> 24:13.220
And how come I don't know about it?

24:13.560 --> 24:16.981
But then of course I read down below and the answer was, apparently I did it.

24:17.061 --> 24:17.401
It was me.

24:17.561 --> 24:19.101
So I was like, okay, wow.

24:20.581 --> 24:23.842
So I want to walk through what exactly I've written on this topic.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.651
So what we're seeing here, right?

24:25.811 --> 24:30.354
What we're seeing here is him just recently responding to, this is him.

24:31.335 --> 24:33.516
This is him apparently running Sieber.

24:34.017 --> 24:36.638
And he gave this presentation like yesterday.

24:37.439 --> 24:41.422
And it's about Spike Vax and what he said and what he didn't say.

24:42.042 --> 24:50.148
And I assure you, he was chosen after a long audition on YouTube with Marty McCary and others.

24:50.970 --> 24:56.056
He was chosen to do this because they trusted him because he's a planted guy.

24:56.116 --> 25:02.244
He was planted in 2017, just like, like the Weinsteins were set up in 2017, 18 and 19.

25:05.387 --> 25:10.890
Don't forget at the beginning of the pandemic, Eric Weinstein was doing podcasts as seriously as his brother.

25:11.350 --> 25:12.550
And it was called The Portal.

25:12.991 --> 25:17.613
And one of the first Portal podcasts was Peter Thiel.

25:18.253 --> 25:24.876
And that's where Peter Thiel says, you know, there's so much specialization in science that you really can't trust anymore because they can all lie.

25:25.597 --> 25:30.019
And so I kind of start with that as my base assumption that most of it's bullshit.

25:31.940 --> 25:47.203
That was a podcast in December of 2019, you know, the same month when Sam Harris went on Brett Weinstein's podcast and said that when we have the next pandemic that's killing 70% of people, then we won't be able to tolerate this anti-vax bullshit anymore.

25:50.603 --> 25:53.424
And so this is what Rule by Podcast looks like.

25:54.524 --> 26:00.105
Because they're also, of course, doing the FDA podcast all the time with, they even have lights now and stuff.

26:01.533 --> 26:22.368
And so this is all one big show and it's all one big show to hide very, very simple truths that this guy is basically just full of shit and he uses synthetically constructed DNA and RNA and claims to be a virologist and that nobody has gotten here in 15 years.

26:22.468 --> 26:23.849
Endemicity is just a myth.

26:25.030 --> 26:27.672
It is not a process and it is not an endpoint.

26:28.991 --> 26:33.455
But the whole use of that word in our everyday lives is on purpose.

26:33.515 --> 26:38.038
The whole use of the phrase going viral in our everyday lives has been on purpose.

26:38.098 --> 26:38.819
It's a script.

26:39.895 --> 26:47.598
that ultimately has crescendoed and come to the point where we have a fake man at the head of NIH.

26:47.638 --> 26:56.802
He's gotta be a fake man because I met him three times during the pandemic at private barbecues, almost like he showed up there specifically to talk to me.

26:57.402 --> 27:03.805
And the last time he did it, he told me three different times on two different days to stop talking about Robert fricking Malone.

27:05.689 --> 27:19.663
I suspect because Robert Malone is one of the people that ultimately has been running the script since the beginning of the pandemic, and they pulled him out of his normal technical role and put him on the Dark Horse podcast because shit was going south fast.

27:22.196 --> 27:28.299
There was this Byram Bridle up in Canada that was coming out to say the shot didn't stay everywhere.

27:28.339 --> 27:34.921
And there was this guy in Pittsburgh from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was saying they were misconstruing a background with spread.

27:35.241 --> 27:36.742
They had to get this under control.

27:37.902 --> 27:50.908
But now we have a guy who has the top of the NHS, or HNIH, and he is promoting Substack, interviewing for Substack, and interviewing on X.

27:52.611 --> 27:59.916
So Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the Weinstein family, all who claim that the FDA is in the way.

28:01.076 --> 28:05.099
We are not being, we are being ruled by this bullshit on the right.

28:05.179 --> 28:10.942
This, this Substack nonsense, this X nonsense, it's all controlled media.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.424
The comments are especially hilarious on Substack.

28:14.636 --> 28:17.337
The idea of how much time these people spend there.

28:17.957 --> 28:23.119
I think I've written three comments in my entire five years of the COVID pandemic.

28:23.159 --> 28:26.840
These people are sometimes writing 30 or 40 replies a day.

28:27.620 --> 28:37.984
People like Sasha Latupova or her likeness is meant, made to seem as though it spends the whole day there and on X and elsewhere writing substacks and painting, I guess.

28:39.079 --> 28:40.519
These people are bullshit.

28:40.579 --> 28:41.880
They're not serious people.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.840
They work for this machine.

28:48.201 --> 28:51.682
And so these people were supposed to have a very easy job.

28:51.742 --> 28:57.964
It was supposed to be very easy to fool everybody into assuming that it's a coverup of a lab leak.

28:58.544 --> 29:02.605
And in fact, that's what they tried to do for me, to me from the very beginning.

29:03.757 --> 29:09.938
and the track record of these people emailing me and wanting to talk to me, the timing is remarkable.

29:12.379 --> 29:16.340
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.320
Taught who?

29:18.040 --> 29:19.260
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

29:19.460 --> 29:19.580
Oh.

29:19.780 --> 29:27.262
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health and through the WIV, because they put a gain of function ban on funding here in the States.

29:27.282 --> 29:27.462
Right.

29:28.102 --> 29:28.722
Obama did that, right?

29:28.742 --> 29:29.323
Obama did that.

29:29.363 --> 29:40.487
And so Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

29:40.527 --> 29:42.648
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

29:42.668 --> 29:43.988
It's going through some intermediary.

29:44.868 --> 29:56.693
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

29:57.793 --> 30:01.896
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

30:03.097 --> 30:07.779
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it, necessarily, from a laboratory.

30:08.620 --> 30:14.723
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

30:15.364 --> 30:18.786
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

30:18.886 --> 30:22.388
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

30:23.268 --> 30:28.670
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

30:29.671 --> 30:32.311
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

30:32.572 --> 30:33.992
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

30:34.012 --> 30:34.692
No, what is that?

30:34.852 --> 30:47.777
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DOD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of, we need to build a vaccine against this, because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

30:48.317 --> 30:51.138
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.719
You'll have something to leak from this.

30:55.099 --> 30:58.921
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.581
We've got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

31:01.962 --> 31:04.422
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

31:04.943 --> 31:07.363
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

31:08.504 --> 31:09.884
Because you just can't.

31:09.904 --> 31:11.825
The grant process is so grueling.

31:12.205 --> 31:15.748
Now what I want to just do is briefly warm you up, right?

31:15.768 --> 31:17.069
This is November of 2024.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.411
We are now in July of 2025.

31:19.872 --> 31:23.655
In November of 2024, of course, Trump would be elected.

31:25.737 --> 31:27.959
And so it's curious, this timing.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.700
It's curious, very, very curious.

31:31.542 --> 31:34.604
The Wuhan cover-up book was released in 2023, in December of 2023.

31:34.704 --> 31:36.266
So it's been out for almost a whole year here.

31:40.685 --> 31:49.974
And I have been working for CHD, you know, this whole time until the end of 2023.

31:50.895 --> 31:55.700
It was in January of 2024 that I got fired from CHD for talking about Robert Malone.

31:56.401 --> 31:58.983
So let's just remember again that in 2018,

32:02.139 --> 32:11.024
Suzanne Humphreys was able to say that she didn't think it was possible to make a good vaccine because the idea was antithetical to the immune system.

32:11.964 --> 32:25.431
And I am accusing her and Mark is accusing her of saying this only because at the time they were in the process of stepping in front of Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn.

32:25.991 --> 32:42.388
And so because Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn were very close to, if not exactly, saying that intramuscular injection is dumb, they were very, very close to saying that, very, very close to saying that there is no good vaccine, but they were saying it better.

32:43.209 --> 32:47.250
And so she started saying that she didn't think there was no vaccine.

32:47.270 --> 32:56.092
In fact, in this interview right here in 2018, she won't say it on Brandi's phone, but she's going to say it on stage at this CalJam event.

32:56.672 --> 33:03.714
And so what's striking about this is in 2025, she was on Joe Rogan for three hours and couldn't find the words.

33:05.375 --> 33:06.515
She never actually said it.

33:07.870 --> 33:11.412
And even when he just blatantly asked her, so what's the deal with vaccines?

33:12.132 --> 33:13.412
She didn't say it.

33:14.313 --> 33:23.897
And certainly not even close, nowhere near, not even the same ballpark of what she could say when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive before the pandemic.

33:24.817 --> 33:28.118
And so, Suzanne Humphries is definitely a traitor.

33:28.178 --> 33:29.939
She's definitely a scripted traitor.

33:29.979 --> 33:31.140
She could be under duress.

33:32.982 --> 33:39.005
But the idea that she's been in this since this book with Roman called dissolving illusions It hasn't made any progress.

33:39.065 --> 33:47.028
In fact has gone backwards in her ability to message about this Labels her as somebody who is on a script and curiously enough.

33:47.068 --> 33:54.130
She also has a very nice following on X now And may also be producing a substack like why not, right?

33:54.150 --> 33:54.170
I

33:58.126 --> 34:03.512
And so if we do this little timeline for Mr. Kevin McKernan, we'll just do it real brief.

34:03.592 --> 34:05.494
I mean, of course, I could do a lot more than this.

34:05.594 --> 34:09.278
It could go on all day if we went month by month.

34:09.379 --> 34:20.391
But let's just say that in 2020, he was already podcasting regularly, and I have at least three examples of him podcasting with people who Meryl Nass actually follows about two weeks later.

34:22.031 --> 34:48.608
And all of these podcasts in 2020 he's basically saying that there is a virus that you can track it with PCR but not the PCR that the who is using and The FDA is in the way and otherwise we'd have a lot more of this shit solved already And also in 2020, there's a drastic member remember drastic is this group that eventually Tucker Carlson announced it was specifically a group of in the DM group in Twitter and

34:49.611 --> 34:55.453
Right, so Twitter is where the truth is coming out on social media, right?

34:56.194 --> 35:04.597
And in 2021, Tucker Carlson is even gonna tell us that drastic is where the truth is coming out, drastic on Twitter.

35:05.293 --> 35:05.493
Right?

35:06.113 --> 35:08.354
So McKernan is still podcasting in 2021.

35:08.874 --> 35:14.095
He teaches Naomi Wolf the narrative on a podcast with her in the same room.

35:15.195 --> 35:22.517
But in June of 2021 is when Bridal from Canada goes public about the shot not staying localized to the deltoid.

35:22.557 --> 35:27.638
And that I think is the main reason why Malone, Kirsch, and Weinstein do a podcast in June

35:28.318 --> 35:54.687
To try and pull the spotlight away from Byron bridal while he's also severely attacked by his employer And so they take the spotlight from Byron bridal It's also curiously enough the same month that Claire Craig started really doing her schtick for heart this really shitty group in the UK Also co-founded by this guy Jonathan Engler who I think is one of the shittiest people on earth and who's also linked to panda and

35:55.948 --> 36:19.067
And Nick Hudson so all in this month Tucker Carlson does that video that I showed you in the beginning where he says that Jamie Metzl and some French guy are the founders of drastic when in reality drastic is a group on Twitter therefore there can be only one founder and the founder was Billy Bo Stixson who is still I guess an anonymous

36:20.069 --> 36:28.057
Twitter user from the UK supposedly, but I never really could figure it out because the drastic website is supposedly administered by somebody in Thailand.

36:28.097 --> 36:28.837
That's what he told me.

36:29.658 --> 36:35.604
So drastic was reported by Tucker as being a French guy who didn't join the group until like I had left.

36:37.371 --> 36:51.182
and Jamie Metzl who's a futurist and like a guy who's done TED talks and stuff about transhumanism and supposedly that guy is the guy who was part of drastic too, which is just a lie.

36:51.222 --> 36:52.503
He was never part of drastic.

36:53.103 --> 37:00.429
So it's odd that Tucker Carlson did that in June of 2021 in the same month that all of this other curious shit happened.

37:02.315 --> 37:10.718
And so if we move on to December of 2021, just to keep this all in context, right, the same year, Kevin McKernan contacted me and wanted to do an interview.

37:11.299 --> 37:12.799
So I interviewed Kevin McKernan.

37:12.839 --> 37:18.602
He told me all about how the RNA wasn't pure and he worked for the Human Genome Project and he was super smart.

37:20.302 --> 37:28.706
And so then two weeks after all that happened in December, culminating in December with McKernan, two weeks later, Rixie just happens to be driving

37:29.397 --> 37:32.240
you know, near Pittsburgh, and he could drop by if he wanted to.

37:32.820 --> 37:43.912
And then he did, and tried to convince me that the diffuse proposal was actually real, and that they had done this, you know, three-month analysis on it, and I should, you know, be in drastic.

37:43.952 --> 37:46.254
I shouldn't leave drastic, or I'm gonna lose all the credit.

37:47.835 --> 37:49.097
He stayed overnight at my house.

37:52.208 --> 37:57.091
So in April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

37:57.131 --> 38:04.376
and Ron Johnson called me on the same day to tell me that Robert Malone sat them down to watch that podcast that I made with Rixey in January.

38:06.317 --> 38:07.177
It's just the way it is.

38:07.257 --> 38:10.259
They both called me on the same day within about a half an hour of each other.

38:10.279 --> 38:17.804
They both told me that Robert Malone told them to watch that podcast with Rixey and now they want to help me or they want me to help them.

38:21.388 --> 38:26.591
Jessica Rose emailed me about a week later and was on my podcast two weeks later.

38:29.493 --> 38:42.581
And Charles Rixey and Crawford and me did a podcast in May of 2022, also about DMED and Diffuse and you know, whatever.

38:43.402 --> 38:45.303
And then Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:45.343 --> 38:47.764
hired Rixey and Cooey in June of 2022.

38:51.053 --> 39:00.563
So in in somewhere in 2022 I should also say I should go back one maybe and also here which is not here Rixey gets fired soon after this and

39:01.869 --> 39:05.032
At first, and for a very long time, I thought that firing was real.

39:05.953 --> 39:14.841
Now I think actually that was just a stunt to try and make sure that I would stay working with the book and that I would believe that these people were believing in me.

39:14.881 --> 39:22.107
And so what they did was they had Rixey bring Kevin McCairn into a private meeting and then had me react to it.

39:22.307 --> 39:24.029
And it wouldn't have mattered how I reacted.

39:24.089 --> 39:25.090
If I'd have reacted like,

39:25.610 --> 39:35.216
you know, Kevin McCarren is fine and we can just talk about the book with him too, then Kevin McCarren would have been in the committee and in the thing and it would have been okay.

39:35.816 --> 39:50.024
And if I said he was bad guy, then they could say, okay, well, we're going to fire Rixey and then that'll really make Jay feel like he's legit and that he's got power and that this job of writing this book with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

39:50.084 --> 39:54.647
is serious because when he told them who McCarren was, they fired Rixey.

39:55.347 --> 40:05.887
But then, for the next two years almost, Rixie sometimes even went to Japan to live with McCairn, and much of their streaming was about me.

40:06.983 --> 40:12.427
and claiming that I had lied to get Rixey fired.

40:12.587 --> 40:26.677
And so the whole accusation of me lying and backstabbing Rixey in the back forced me to defend myself against their accusations, which tricked me into making them more relevant than they were.

40:28.141 --> 40:50.838
Instead of teaching biology or getting farther with understanding how this network works I was still trying to win them over or beat them and that was all part of the illusion All part of the stunt to keep me working to make sure that I would never get to where we are now that Mark would never get to where he is now where we really understand the depth of the illusion and

40:51.963 --> 41:07.451
And so it was in January of 2023 that Sasha Latupova, Meryl Ness, Robert Malone, Asim Maholtra, and Michael Palmer of Doctors for COVID Ethics were on tour, on stage in Stockholm, Sweden, January of 2023.

41:10.083 --> 41:26.717
And it was also in January of 2023 that Matt Crawford claimed to add me to the Steve Kersh Steering Committee that included McKernan, John Bodwin, Stephanie Seneff of MIT, Jessica Rose of the VAERS Report, you know, Steve Kersh, and Marc Giraudeau of Panda.

41:29.113 --> 41:32.454
And so in April of that same year, we did this St.

41:32.494 --> 41:39.155
Patrick's Day thing with Stephanie Seneff and John Bodwin and Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and Jonathan Cui.

41:39.175 --> 41:44.177
And that's the one where Rose says, I really think that the infectious clones are what happened.

41:46.297 --> 41:52.539
And about six weeks later is when McKernan declared me chemtrail retarded on his sub stack.

41:53.399 --> 41:57.940
And in the meantime, all of them went on to promote diffuse as a real leak.

42:00.856 --> 42:16.234
Jessica Rose wrote an article about diffuse Jiki leaks Archmedic wrote an article about diffuse and Kevin McKernan wrote an article about diffuse all in the same week all on substack And so in

42:18.169 --> 42:20.550
Now I'm skipping something here, but just remember that.

42:20.951 --> 42:31.176
McKernan et al are in front of the third Senator Ron Johnson organized COVID truth panel, of which I've never been asked to be on, even though he called me in April of 2022 to tell me I was great.

42:31.796 --> 42:37.419
In January of 2024, he was in front of the Senate saying that there was a DNA contamination in the shot.

42:37.459 --> 42:44.003
Jessica Rose was in front of the Senate, you know, Glasspool Malone and Robert Malone, Brian Hooker, Kevin McKernan,

42:45.205 --> 42:55.133
And almost all of the people who in November of 2023 were in Romania on stage together, but not Nick Hudson and not Denny Rancourt.

42:55.693 --> 42:57.634
They were not there at the Senate panel.

42:58.095 --> 43:04.640
But some other people from the Romanian thing were, including Harvey Reich and Ryan Cole.

43:06.818 --> 43:11.345
uh Brett Weinstein you see the thing here Brett Weinstein was there over there with them too.

43:11.886 --> 43:17.215
So McKernan then Danny Jones podcast in November of 2024 right after the election.

43:20.464 --> 43:26.348
So there's no way that that can't be scripted bullshit then, because look at the Steve Kirsch podcast, right?

43:26.388 --> 43:27.689
First, these guys.

43:29.691 --> 43:40.178
So promoting her now is not only Kevin McCairn, but also Mary Holland and also Mike Eden.

43:40.198 --> 43:44.782
But what's most important to hear is her say about Peter McCullough and

43:45.422 --> 43:47.983
And Ryan Cole, I think of them as good guys.

43:48.003 --> 43:50.024
They've been always outspoken about this.

43:50.224 --> 43:54.106
She thinks of Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole as good guys.

43:55.826 --> 43:56.967
In 2025.

43:58.147 --> 44:07.992
And Kevin McCairn, just like he did to me for like four years, pretends to analyze her and make fun of her because she can't smile and she's like a statue.

44:09.412 --> 44:13.194
But of course, with me, he was saying quite a bit shittier stuff.

44:14.262 --> 44:26.645
Um, with a quite a bit more, uh, let's say aggression and violence implied, including, you know, I wonder if he will soon, because I'll say it right now and then he'll do it.

44:27.065 --> 44:29.665
He's going to have to put a shotgun in her mouth pretty soon.

44:29.785 --> 44:41.548
Otherwise he still won't have topped the things that he's done with me because there's been a few times when he's made it mean with me and a shotgun in my mouth, including one with a prediction that I would be dead in September of 2025.

44:46.294 --> 44:47.535
And so this isn't funny.

44:48.095 --> 44:55.120
This is evidence of the fraud, because here he is on Steve Kirsch's podcast with one of these clowns that Robert Malone runs.

44:55.620 --> 45:07.268
Up on top there, you can see that Steve Kirsch is always promoting Pierre Kory, who was, of course, the head of the FLCCC for a couple years, getting a quarter million dollars a year from a nonprofit.

45:07.748 --> 45:13.512
And there's Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn, who are on the exact same podcast.

45:14.349 --> 45:21.374
broadcast of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation talking about the white clots in 2025.

45:22.655 --> 45:40.229
And remember that Kevin McCairn is a guy who was associated with George Webb's crew, Addy Adds and Paul Cottrell in the beginning of the pandemic in March and April, when they streamed with me, that's right, four people or three people streaming against one person.

45:41.186 --> 45:42.446
That's how the magic is done.

45:43.107 --> 45:47.508
Three scripted liars against one unwitting participant.

45:50.129 --> 46:03.474
And that was in March and April of 2020, when he was pretty much dead on, balls accurate with the lab leak, with Peter Daszak, with the spike protein, amyloid, neurotropic effects, yada, yada, yada.

46:04.471 --> 46:10.634
It is scripted bullshit for years and they're all on the same script because they're all on the same team.

46:11.114 --> 46:19.198
And Sasha Latupova and Kevin McCairn actually make it the most obvious if you pay attention to them versus me.

46:21.539 --> 46:27.962
Because I haven't even put Sasha Latupova's contacting me and wanting to be on my podcast back in 2022.

46:28.402 --> 46:32.764
I haven't put Mary Talley Bowden when she wanted to be on my podcast in 2022.

46:34.588 --> 46:35.529
The list is long.

46:41.172 --> 46:46.395
And so this is... This is really impossible, right?

46:46.436 --> 46:51.859
It's not possible that... I'm gonna escape just to make sure this runs right here.

46:52.760 --> 46:58.443
This whole slide is not possible unless it is an orchestrated, scripted group of liars.

46:58.783 --> 47:01.105
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

47:01.980 --> 47:06.322
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.304
It's like a marble statue.

47:09.464 --> 47:13.506
Problem with experts even when they're, you know, the good guys.

47:14.366 --> 47:16.707
She's literally trying to raise a smile there.

47:21.767 --> 47:24.368
Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole.

47:24.428 --> 47:25.488
I think of them as good guys.

47:25.508 --> 47:27.189
They've been always outspoken about this.

47:27.849 --> 47:30.690
The problem with- None of that is over.

47:30.770 --> 47:31.470
And it's Sasha Lateefov.

47:31.490 --> 47:32.070
Sasha Lateefov.

47:32.110 --> 47:32.910
Sasha Lateefov.

47:32.970 --> 47:34.011
Sasha Lateefov.

47:34.031 --> 47:35.191
Sasha Lateefov.

47:35.471 --> 47:36.532
Sasha Lateefov.

47:36.632 --> 47:37.312
Sasha Lateefov.

47:48.075 --> 48:16.629
Now if you think about this as a global effort to make Substack relevant globally as a media as a media thing a media phenomenon if you think of this as a scripted effort to make X a globally relevant social media platform to make to make locals or or YouTube or Substack a globally relevant

48:17.699 --> 48:22.504
media source, then you can easily see what these people have done for five years.

48:23.125 --> 48:32.614
Because Kevin McKernan was also scripted to say that the truth was coming out on X. These people also have their own telegram groups.

48:33.996 --> 48:35.777
These people communicate with Signal.

48:37.759 --> 48:41.083
These people went to Getter when they were censored on LinkedIn.

48:42.611 --> 48:49.933
It's all an orchestrated theater to make social media globally relevant, to demonstrate how globally relevant it was.

48:50.013 --> 48:51.093
And what did they demonstrate?

48:51.113 --> 48:52.754
Well, they got Trump back in office.

48:52.794 --> 48:54.754
They put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:54.794 --> 48:55.034
with him.

48:55.054 --> 48:58.275
They almost got him to be vice president, but they weren't.

48:58.355 --> 49:00.076
They didn't get him there because why?

49:00.116 --> 49:04.897
Because Peter Thiel's man was put there instead.

49:09.373 --> 49:17.799
And one of the people that was present on the day when this was all announced, and also there at the Republican convention, was Hulk Hogan.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.282
Now why in the world, why in the hell would I bring up Hulk Hogan?

49:22.482 --> 49:24.784
Now this is really where it gets fricking fun.

49:25.665 --> 49:26.345
This is awesome.

49:26.405 --> 49:33.390
So first, let's do this slide to make sure that we understand exactly how scripted of a liar Kevin McCurdy is.

49:33.410 --> 49:36.972
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught Whiv how to create the coronavirus.

49:37.853 --> 49:38.273
To who?

49:39.014 --> 49:40.215
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

49:40.435 --> 49:40.555
Oh.

49:40.755 --> 49:48.440
So there's grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV, because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

49:48.460 --> 49:49.020
Right.

49:49.080 --> 49:49.700
Obama did that, right?

49:49.720 --> 49:50.301
Obama did that.

49:50.341 --> 50:01.468
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:01.508 --> 50:03.609
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

50:03.649 --> 50:04.930
It's going through some intermediary.

50:05.850 --> 50:17.718
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seam technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

50:18.779 --> 50:22.862
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

50:24.083 --> 50:28.726
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it necessarily from a laboratory.

50:29.586 --> 50:35.691
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

50:36.331 --> 50:39.754
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

50:39.854 --> 50:43.396
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

50:44.257 --> 50:49.601
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

50:50.652 --> 50:53.276
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

50:53.296 --> 50:54.938
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

50:54.958 --> 50:55.639
No, what is that?

50:55.819 --> 51:08.756
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of, we need to build a vaccine against this, because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

51:09.296 --> 51:12.120
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

51:13.201 --> 51:15.684
You'll have something to leak from this.

51:16.085 --> 51:19.909
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

51:20.150 --> 51:22.573
We got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

51:22.953 --> 51:25.416
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

51:25.917 --> 51:27.819
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

51:29.460 --> 51:31.161
because you just can't.

51:31.381 --> 51:42.306
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows we can get X'd on, we've demonstrated this piece, we've demonstrated this piece, now we just need to do this last piece.

51:43.567 --> 51:49.590
And in that Diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

51:49.730 --> 51:52.891
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

51:54.232 --> 51:57.694
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

51:58.314 --> 52:00.175
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document.

52:00.215 --> 52:01.835
And so now just think, okay?

52:01.915 --> 52:10.258
Barrick, Wiv, Fauci, Peter Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance, Obama Ban were all on 60 Minutes three times.

52:11.379 --> 52:14.780
Where George Webb was also on 60 Minutes on the last time.

52:15.800 --> 52:16.081
Yeah?

52:17.381 --> 52:24.984
And these are exact scripted talking points taken from McCairn in March of 2020 when I was streaming with him.

52:25.714 --> 52:39.517
with Paul Cottrell, somebody who George Webb, who was on 60 Minutes in February of 2020, promoted as the hero of the pandemic for more than three years and even did a Twitter space trashing me because I said that Paul Cottrell was a fraud.

52:41.257 --> 52:49.819
Seamless ligation or no-see-um is a myth that's supposed to make you think that Ralph Baric is some kind of special baker and he taught them how to make his special cakes.

52:50.319 --> 52:52.400
That's bullshit, okay?

52:54.059 --> 52:57.062
The other thing is using Golden Gate Assembly.

52:57.402 --> 53:01.666
When he says that out loud, as it was shown in the chat, there's a frickin Wikipedia page.

53:01.706 --> 53:03.968
This is not no-see-um technique.

53:04.088 --> 53:06.110
Understand what he's talking about here.

53:07.131 --> 53:13.376
He's talking about constructing a DNA molecule or an RNA molecule that will produce, reliably, a protein.

53:14.377 --> 53:15.338
There is no room

53:16.098 --> 53:19.780
for there to be, you know, well, we had to use this restriction enzyme.

53:19.820 --> 53:33.766
So, you know, we have this A-T-Z-Z-T, that's wrong of course, but you know, we have this sequence here, A-C-G-T-A-C, because we had to use this restriction enzyme, but that's not supposed to be in the protein.

53:34.487 --> 53:43.651
That problem of how do we build a DNA sequence exactly like we want it has been solved already.

53:44.662 --> 53:47.543
Ralph Baric is not one of those people that solved it.

53:47.963 --> 53:52.505
He's one of those people that bought the commercial enzymes necessary to do it.

53:53.346 --> 53:55.867
And the finding, ouch, that was a pop.

53:56.487 --> 54:00.509
The finding of those enzymes,

54:01.369 --> 54:13.379
And the commercial production of them were all necessary for the Human Genome Project to get anywhere and are part of the history of molecular biology that actually comes from, of course, bacteria.

54:13.439 --> 54:21.486
Because restriction enzymes are enzymes that are found in bacteria that cut DNA at particular sequences.

54:21.546 --> 54:24.288
It's not that necessarily we don't have restriction enzymes too.

54:24.789 --> 54:28.512
It's that the restriction enzymes of bacteria are very accessible.

54:30.518 --> 54:33.539
and therefore reproducible and commercializable.

54:33.719 --> 54:36.039
And so that's what all molecular biology is based on.

54:36.399 --> 54:40.120
He's full of shit if he says that Ralph Barrett contributed anything meaningful to that.

54:41.300 --> 54:52.963
And instead, he knows better than most that the Human Genome Project actually invented all of those recipes and all of those technologies, many of which were based on just robotics, to get this stuff to go faster.

54:54.520 --> 55:02.522
and finding a couple enzymes that would work at higher temperatures when DNA denatured or didn't denature when they were brought to those temperatures.

55:02.582 --> 55:17.865
So, this whole idea of fingerprints are a joke because there are restriction enzyme sites everywhere in nature and there are so many different restriction enzymes that, you know, it's not very hard to create a little Scooby-Doo

55:19.494 --> 55:37.795
sort of story where, look, we put these restriction enzymes there and then we tell this mathematician to find them, and we tell this mathematician and this Charles Rixey guy that they should, you know, calculate the odds, and then the mathematician named Alex Washburn will calculate the odds, and then Kevin McKernan will go on this podcast and say, see, that's what it is.

55:38.295 --> 55:38.896
Fingerprints.

55:38.976 --> 55:39.456
They did it.

55:40.430 --> 55:41.151
It's bullshit.

55:41.351 --> 55:43.092
It's complete bullshit.

55:43.673 --> 56:02.628
Now, don't forget that Kevin McKernan was on my broadcast in December of 2021, and just a couple weeks later, Rixey showed up at my door to convince me that the DeFuse proposal was indeed real, not fake like I'd been saying for two months, and that I should rejoin Drastic, because me and him would be the only Americans in Drastic.

56:05.310 --> 56:07.012
And so I kept saying DeFuse was fake.

56:08.366 --> 56:14.748
And I tried to argue that right up until Rixie and I were working for the book.

56:16.549 --> 56:20.030
And I kept saying that it's just, I'm not going to let it go in there as a reel.

56:20.070 --> 56:20.950
That thing is fake.

56:20.970 --> 56:22.471
We're not going to put it in the book at all.

56:24.526 --> 56:51.500
at some point in time I think they orchestrated something to get me to believe in the committee and get me to believe in what I was doing and so After I was called and told that I needed I was hired by Robert F. Kennedy jr They also orchestrated this little event where in one of these meetings supposedly Charles Rixey was violated for a violation of the NDA by bringing a

56:51.980 --> 57:02.489
Kevin McCairn into the view of it of the of his laptop in the hotel room where he was staying in, Texas I don't really know exactly how this all you know why he was in Texas.

57:02.509 --> 57:20.904
He had a house there or something I guess anyway, the point is is that I was Made very effectively to feel as though my speaking out about McCairn being a bad guy Made Rixey a bad guy and that the people that I was working with at CHD to help write that book believed me and so they fired Rixey and

57:22.051 --> 57:30.809
And then after that, of course, Rixie would go on to stream about me with McCairn, sometimes from Tokyo, you know, for years to come.

57:32.484 --> 58:00.904
Sometimes I would be like a three times a week I was in their thumbnail and I'm always in their beginning slides like always I've always been in their beginning slides Since I started to call Kevin McCarron a shithead in 2021 So Kevin they go on to stream together for years with my work as a major theme and now of course, you know in 2024 in 2025 these people have all risen to the top and now Kevin McKernan is actually saying that it was Charles Rixey who helped

58:01.724 --> 58:03.224
helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:03.284 --> 58:06.365
write the book, except my name's in the book, not Rixie's.

58:08.345 --> 58:14.827
And all of the names at the top of this page know exactly that I'm telling the truth.

58:14.907 --> 58:16.267
That's the weird part about it.

58:16.307 --> 58:28.830
If you go to this book, and I think from an American history perspective, screw the fact that CHD gets all the money at this point, this page right here, Acknowledgements, has

58:31.454 --> 58:33.575
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 employees of CHD.

58:33.595 --> 58:39.158
At least half of them that I would gladly read out loud, half of them know for sure that I'm telling the complete truth here.

58:56.786 --> 59:04.910
that Kevin McKernan is an absolute liar, that Charles Rixey was fired, but the firing was probably part of the stunt.

59:06.391 --> 59:09.873
And so that's why they can't come out and say anything.

59:09.913 --> 59:13.915
They can't come out one way or another because it was all a stunt.

59:14.055 --> 59:22.620
And if I figure out now that it was a stunt, then I actually know that quite a few of the people that I thought were very good at CHD are actually all part of it.

59:23.420 --> 59:24.661
And they know who they are now.

59:27.574 --> 59:34.139
And so this narrative is progressing quite badly for them because the book is never going to go away.

59:35.580 --> 59:40.523
My name, if it gets removed from the book, will even be better because I've got a whole box of them in the house already.

59:41.424 --> 59:47.849
Assuming I'm going to be able to sell them for like $1,000 each with a little signature in them and a couple highlighted pages.

59:48.449 --> 59:50.531
In a couple years, those are going to be worth a fortune.

59:53.413 --> 59:54.854
Because this is the reality.

59:56.499 --> 59:57.680
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:15.220
is a scripted fraud, and the script that they are on has been enacted by a couple key liars who unfortunately tried very hard over a few years to get me on board, to convince me that I had solved the mystery of the Scooby-Doo virus.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:24.378
And these people, instead, I progressed to thinking that intramuscular injection is a pretty dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:00:24.438 --> 01:00:36.422
And because that's true, the entire health freedom movement in America defined by, you know, Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and Mary Holland, Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:36.562 --> 01:00:37.783
is a scripted fraud.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:44.202
because they have to be aware that autism spectrum disorder, that pandemics and gain of function are all myths.

01:00:44.262 --> 01:00:46.742
That cancer and SV40 are myths.

01:00:46.802 --> 01:00:49.743
The DNA contamination in the shot is a bullshit story.

01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:50.624
These are all myths.

01:00:52.084 --> 01:00:56.805
And that's quite a bit of fricking progress after 2020 thinking it was a lab leak.

01:00:59.386 --> 01:01:05.488
It's quite a lot of progress that none of these other scripted assholes have been allowed to make because they're on a script.

01:01:07.034 --> 01:01:15.021
and way too unsophisticated to understand how screwed they are now that they chose to play this script because they can't stop.

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:18.504
For the rest of their life, they're going to have to live this fraud.

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:22.828
And if even one of them breaks, this whole thing will fall apart.

01:01:24.409 --> 01:01:24.970
Remember this?

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:27.812
Joe Rogan podcast, check it out.

01:01:27.832 --> 01:01:28.953
The Joe Rogan Experience.

01:01:29.414 --> 01:01:32.637
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.071
It's so fucking weird to be sitting here, bro.

01:01:38.452 --> 01:01:38.592
Now.

01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:48.238
This is cool because I showed you this yesterday This is the guy whose podcast Kevin McKernan went on and said that you know, it's it's it's uh It's Charles Rixey, right?

01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:52.881
Remember that remember that so this one starts out kind of funny.

01:01:53.322 --> 01:01:54.522
Yeah Well, thanks.

01:01:54.682 --> 01:01:59.105
Thank you for being like the number one promoter of my youtube channel over the past I

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:15.421
So now I want to suggest to you something that probably a lot of other people have said before, but Joe Rogan is kind of the top of a little pyramid of a network of people that shares guests, and the guests that circulate on these shows are scripted assholes.

01:02:18.244 --> 01:02:26.071
And the point now to realize is the intellectual dark web is just this dumb idea, but it's actually how they do it.

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:29.872
The intellectual dark web was out there to be discredited.

01:02:29.992 --> 01:02:30.912
Oh, that's ridiculous.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:40.640
But reality was, is that already back then, when they had that meeting, they knew that during the pandemic, we would be governed by podcast.

01:02:40.781 --> 01:02:47.146
And we, they knew that the specifically, it had to be conversations because that's how people come to know things.

01:02:48.615 --> 01:02:51.037
It can't be the Tom Brokaw News Program.

01:02:51.077 --> 01:02:53.079
It can't be PBS NewsHour.

01:02:53.119 --> 01:03:02.446
And that's why PBS NewsHour has transitioned to interviewing, has transitioned to having a whole table of people, or that they even have Washington Week, where it is a host with four people.

01:03:03.167 --> 01:03:11.694
Because they have found, through the years, that those are the most effective ways to get people to know things.

01:03:12.898 --> 01:03:15.780
To make people feel like they understand things.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.364
To make people feel like they have understood or even followed along.

01:03:22.126 --> 01:03:25.188
And that's the magic of being ruled by podcast.

01:03:25.228 --> 01:03:29.251
And Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and some of these other people.

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:31.874
I don't even think Elon Musk should really be counted.

01:03:31.914 --> 01:03:33.835
I think Elon Musk is a friend of Peter Thiel.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.077
I think Peter Thiel is a pretty bright guy.

01:03:36.097 --> 01:03:37.518
I think Elon Musk is a moron.

01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:38.179
But...

01:03:39.312 --> 01:03:43.299
Peter Thiel has also made a lot of mistakes because he's incredibly arrogant.

01:03:45.944 --> 01:03:47.066
Very, very arrogant.

01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:49.477
My pleasure.

01:03:49.517 --> 01:03:50.378
It's great stuff, man.

01:03:50.418 --> 01:03:51.218
I watch it all the time.

01:03:51.339 --> 01:03:51.879
You're really good.

01:03:52.399 --> 01:03:53.440
You got great shows, man.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.100
I appreciate that.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.001
And I get good guests from your show.

01:03:56.302 --> 01:04:01.125
There's a couple people that have been on your show that I've... Okay, remember, this is part of this, right?

01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:05.107
Everything, and you're all MAGA, or if you're on the left, you're blue no matter who.

01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:05.788
You're in a cult.

01:04:06.328 --> 01:04:06.808
You're in a cult.

01:04:06.848 --> 01:04:09.110
People get into cults, and why is that?

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:13.692
Why is that a part of... If we are in a simulation... So that's how this starts, this little clip.

01:04:13.732 --> 01:04:14.453
Listen to this clip.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:28.357
Everything and you know, you're all maga or if you're on the left, you're blue No matter who you're in a cult you're in a cult people get into cults And why is that like why is that a part of if we are in a simulation?

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.138
Why are we so malleable?

01:04:30.698 --> 01:04:45.423
is it because we recognize it and we're supposed to Oppose it and we're supposed to fight the instinct that we all deeply have embedded in our system but we also know is wrong like what is it about these systems like why is that in place and

01:04:45.683 --> 01:04:59.031
Is this simply just an ancient relic of our tribal past where you had to follow the rules of the tribe in order to survive and so it was instilled in people in the psyche and that's how we developed or is there something more to it?

01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:09.137
Is it like part of the mechanism that allows us to resist which allows us to innovate which encourages us to push forward and ask more questions because we know there's a lot of bullshit.

01:05:09.597 --> 01:05:12.599
Like the reason why people ask so many questions now

01:05:13.419 --> 01:05:16.661
In 2025, as opposed to 2019, is because of COVID.

01:05:16.861 --> 01:05:19.543
Because we went through so much bullshit and propaganda.

01:05:19.843 --> 01:05:26.287
We were so gaslit by the government, by the CDC, by everybody, that now we question way more.

01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:33.011
And so the point here is, is that the assumption in this little discussion is that podcasts are innocent.

01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:40.852
That the internet and the content that's there, the interviewing and the podcasts, those are all innocent.

01:05:40.892 --> 01:05:48.155
We were misled by the CDC and by the government and by Big Pharma and by these virologists.

01:05:49.355 --> 01:05:54.897
When in reality, ladies and gentlemen, those people used podcasts to lie to us.

01:05:56.238 --> 01:06:04.041
And in fact, these scripted podcasts are the only reason why we engaged with the mainstream media dum-dum narrative.

01:06:05.387 --> 01:06:14.536
The only reason why we engaged in this Scooby-Doo mystery solving exercise where we now all believe it's a lab leak is because of these scripted podcasts.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:20.622
It has nothing to do with the fact that the CDC censored us and therefore we got clued in.

01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:29.351
The censorship of people like Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone resulted in them getting to go on Tucker Carlson.

01:06:30.919 --> 01:06:41.936
Resulted in them having more followers and so the censorship was also faked Because they were allowed to complain about it very publicly

01:06:43.789 --> 01:07:07.874
And we were too busy with COVID and too busy with the pandemic and too busy with masks and too busy with PCR cycle counts to realize that we were being wholly bamboozled by all the podcasts that we thought we were engaging in a discussion, you know, where the mysteries are being solved on these accounts and these podcasts are at least telling the truth.

01:07:10.177 --> 01:07:24.610
And here he is, six years later, still reinforcing that narrative that he didn't have any role in how we managed to experience the pandemic, that Danny Jones has no role in how we are gonna think about things going forward.

01:07:25.051 --> 01:07:29.995
These are all just spontaneous things that you only see because the algorithm serves them to you.

01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:35.961
I have no responsibility for the current

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.502
Of course, it's going to do that to me now.

01:07:38.762 --> 01:07:41.604
I will queue it up again and then it'll be fine, I think.

01:07:43.285 --> 01:07:44.406
And so I'll get this going again.

01:07:44.426 --> 01:07:44.646
Sorry.

01:07:45.026 --> 01:07:49.069
So it's probably benefited us somewhat to go through that.

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:49.349
Yeah.

01:07:49.889 --> 01:07:51.710
When Mary was on here, did she tell you about Kevin McKiernan?

01:07:53.431 --> 01:07:54.312
Refresh my memory.

01:07:54.332 --> 01:07:55.713
He was the dude who worked for the human.

01:07:55.833 --> 01:07:57.914
So Mary, right, is Mary Talley Bowden.

01:07:57.954 --> 01:07:59.215
And they'd already talked about her.

01:07:59.315 --> 01:08:01.676
So he felt like he could just call her Mary there.

01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:03.297
It's not disrespectful.

01:08:03.337 --> 01:08:05.559
It's only like a few minutes ago that he talked about that.

01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:09.296
And so here he's gonna mention Kevin McKernan now.

01:08:09.816 --> 01:08:12.117
Genome Project, like a DNA wizard.

01:08:12.357 --> 01:08:19.540
He basically was working for the Human Genome Project trying to figure out different sort of medical treatments for cancers based on your genome.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:31.724
So like they could target a specific type of leukemia in you and they would take your DNA and they would like basically make designer drugs to target that cancer, to kill that cancer.

01:08:31.884 --> 01:08:33.185
Wow, that's interesting.

01:08:34.025 --> 01:08:52.342
What an interesting summary of Kevin McKernan's current and former research sort of trajectory, because I thought in 2020 and 2021 he was just walking around like he was just this guy who used to work for the Human Genome Project, sold a couple companies, but now is just minding his own business working on weed.

01:08:54.557 --> 01:09:00.102
Now he's saying that they worked on cancer and specific treatments for specific people's cancer.

01:09:00.623 --> 01:09:06.808
You know, the kind of treatments that can't be tested by standard FDA means because they're personalized.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.751
The whole reason why the FDA is in the way.

01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:14.478
which is what Kevin McKernan was saying already back in 2020.

01:09:14.878 --> 01:09:27.003
And now this guy seems to recall it almost too perfectly that he's interested in, was interested in personalized cancer medicine all the way back 20 years ago.

01:09:28.304 --> 01:09:29.224
A DNA wizard.

01:09:30.745 --> 01:09:32.646
And during the pandemic, somebody,

01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:37.914
sent him four unopened vials of the Pfizer vaccine.

01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:39.636
That's a pretty big skip, right?

01:09:39.756 --> 01:09:44.200
Not, not, that was like three years in after all the murder was over.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:59.874
Someone sent him some vials, but don't forget that at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, he wrote a paper with Claire Craig from heart, Mikey Eden from Pfizer, Thomas Binder,

01:10:01.152 --> 01:10:06.717
A few other people, including one lady from a German lab that now works with CHD and Brian Hooker.

01:10:07.677 --> 01:10:12.802
And they all wrote a paper objecting to the WHO PCR because the WHO PCR test wasn't right.

01:10:12.822 --> 01:10:14.443
It wasn't reviewed correctly.

01:10:14.483 --> 01:10:15.844
It's got primer dimers in it.

01:10:15.904 --> 01:10:17.326
And our PCR test is better.

01:10:20.548 --> 01:10:24.572
And we're just going to skip all that and say, yeah, he was just minding his own business during the pandemic.

01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:26.493
And then suddenly someone sent him some vials.

01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:28.315
And so he did his DNA wizard shit.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:35.404
And he analyzed them and ran them through all of his processing systems, whatever, whatever the fuck he does.

01:10:36.145 --> 01:10:43.911
And he found out there was a DNA plasmid contamination in them, which were like promoters of this SV 40 shit.

01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:45.412
I did hear about that.

01:10:45.572 --> 01:10:45.852
Yeah.

01:10:46.012 --> 01:10:59.142
I talked to Brett Weinstein about that and he was explaining that when they're first, um, we're sequencing certain vaccines, you know, cause with the vaccine you have to use living cells.

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:18.099
in order to create these antibodies initially yeah and when he's for tradition i mean you could see it right he's like he might not be sophisticated enough he might just be a meathead i mean seriously you might just be a meathead

01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:25.065
Right, and so when they started using these things, they were using kidney cells of these monkeys.

01:11:25.085 --> 01:11:26.306
Sorry, buddy, you can come in here.

01:11:26.326 --> 01:11:37.075
And they didn't understand that these monkeys had this SV40, simian virus 40, and that this, when introduced into human cells, causes tumors, causes cancer, like rampant cancer.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:45.843
You see the uptick of cancer and everyone wants to bury their head in the sand and pretend that it didn't happen, but people that took the vaccine are getting fucking cancer at an astounding rate.

01:11:46.783 --> 01:11:53.527
And Kevin was telling me that he was- And it has nothing to do with transfection being a really bad idea.

01:11:53.547 --> 01:11:57.889
It has nothing to do with intramuscular injection in general being a bad idea.

01:11:58.509 --> 01:12:03.772
Now we believe that Brett Weinstein and others have figured out Brett Weinstein and

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:08.053
Kevin McKernan, both of whom were in front of the Senate at the beginning of 2024.

01:12:10.434 --> 01:12:32.019
Brett Weinstein, who was on stage with Steve Hatfill and Robert Malone and Ryan Cole and Denny Rancor and Harvey Reich and Nick Hudson in Romania in November of 2023, about a month before most of them would be in front of the Senate.

01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:40.638
Ladies and gentlemen, you can see it now and you're about to see something extraordinary doing study.

01:12:40.658 --> 01:12:45.224
He pulled some tumors from some people that died somewhere in Europe.

01:12:45.784 --> 01:12:49.089
And he was studying sequencing the tumors of these people that died.

01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:55.136
with the vaccine, and he said that the SV40 was in the tumors.

01:12:56.237 --> 01:12:57.417
It's in the tumor!

01:12:57.437 --> 01:12:58.157
I don't remember the science.

01:12:58.217 --> 01:12:59.218
I'd have to go back and listen to it.

01:12:59.318 --> 01:13:00.938
By the way, that episode got pulled off YouTube.

01:13:01.538 --> 01:13:01.819
Really?

01:13:01.879 --> 01:13:02.339
Off my channel.

01:13:02.359 --> 01:13:03.099
I got a strike for it.

01:13:03.819 --> 01:13:05.200
What did they say?

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.300
Medical misinformation.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.061
What part of it's medical misinformation?

01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:10.501
It's a strike, and so therefore it must be real.

01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:11.442
Oh my gosh.

01:13:11.582 --> 01:13:12.542
You see how they use it?

01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:18.522
He gets to go on Joe Rogan and say it got a strike, so somebody's going to find it on Rumble or elsewhere.

01:13:18.742 --> 01:13:19.383
The whole thing.

01:13:19.443 --> 01:13:21.845
We talked about vaccines and we talked about- What year was this?

01:13:22.105 --> 01:13:25.908
This was like November of last year.

01:13:26.449 --> 01:13:26.989
Whoa.

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:27.510
Yeah.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.792
I wonder if you could put it up now because they seem to have lightened up.

01:13:30.812 --> 01:13:31.313
I would be scared, dude.

01:13:31.353 --> 01:13:31.693
Didn't they?

01:13:31.753 --> 01:13:34.435
They changed their regulations recently.

01:13:34.836 --> 01:13:35.196
Did they?

01:13:35.316 --> 01:13:36.477
Yeah, they changed their guidelines.

01:13:36.838 --> 01:13:38.079
What's the problem with this shit, dude?

01:13:38.139 --> 01:13:41.802
I'm like, I'm so afraid to talk about shit I want to talk about.

01:13:42.122 --> 01:13:42.923
I know, isn't that fucked up?

01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:44.925
It's like, it sucks, dude.

01:13:45.105 --> 01:13:53.473
It sucks because there's no way to know who's telling the truth unless you let people say crazy shit and then have someone come on and refute it and then have the two of them get together and debate it.

01:13:53.573 --> 01:13:53.773
Right.

01:13:54.394 --> 01:13:57.197
You know, and then even then... Okay, so I want to just move on.

01:13:57.257 --> 01:13:58.718
Okay, so look, this is cool, right?

01:13:58.778 --> 01:14:04.103
So Eric Weinstein is a fraud, Sabine Hossenfelder is a fraud, and they're both tied to Peter Thiel.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.501
Now, I just want to make that argument because someone else sees it too.

01:14:09.581 --> 01:14:15.262
This is actually, the video is going to be taken from this guy, Professor Dave Explains.

01:14:15.802 --> 01:14:17.002
He's pretty over the top.

01:14:17.422 --> 01:14:25.544
He definitely believes in vaccines and everything else, but what's interesting is that he sees the Weinstein Brothers as frauds and he's done lots of good videos on it.

01:14:26.124 --> 01:14:30.785
And the end of this video is very curious, so I just want you to listen to the end of this video.

01:14:31.525 --> 01:14:39.412
Remember that Eric Weinstein is a longtime advisor to Peter Thiel's financial company, right?

01:14:39.573 --> 01:14:51.304
And so that ties Peter Thiel directly to Eric Weinstein's dad, who of course was in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, and the first intellectual property lawyer appointed there.

01:14:52.024 --> 01:15:19.362
Part of the the sort of modernization of the FDA that took place at that time And maybe even an antagonist to Estes Kefauver who was maybe killed on the floor of the Senate about three weeks after or before John F. Kennedy, of course, you know, you should know that but you don't Only Marcus told us that only Marcus as said senator keep offers name even more than once besides me And I'm saying it because I learned it from listening to him.

01:15:19.382 --> 01:15:19.402
I

01:15:20.885 --> 01:15:26.910
And so these people are connected in a very strange way because remember that Brett Weinstein streamed with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:31.693
in November of 2021, but didn't actually post the podcast until February of 2023.

01:15:32.274 --> 01:15:39.419
And that's one of the reasons why I thought, wow, I need to email Bobby Kennedy because he might not even know that his dad is connected to Brett's dad.

01:15:43.393 --> 01:15:44.834
That's how much of an idiot I was.

01:15:44.954 --> 01:15:45.214
Okay.

01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:45.974
So let's listen.

01:15:46.895 --> 01:15:54.139
Um, and listen particularly to what Dave, um, professor Dave explains about, you know, what's going on here.

01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:54.799
Cause it's funny.

01:15:55.119 --> 01:16:00.402
The freedom are all that is necessary for the quark, lepton, CKM, PMS, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:12.388
PNMS structure of the universe that basically sweet, salty, sour, and bitter, or, uh, treble mid bass and reverb is all that's necessary to create a universe.

01:16:13.064 --> 01:16:15.345
Treble, mid, bass, and reverb.

01:16:15.725 --> 01:16:17.746
All you need for a universe, brah.

01:16:18.086 --> 01:16:18.547
Hang on.

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:20.587
Let me bust out my acoustic guitar.

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:21.468
I can show you.

01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:23.589
I don't know if you knew that I play guitar.

01:16:23.949 --> 01:16:24.509
Oh, what's that?

01:16:24.549 --> 01:16:27.671
You saw it in the frame down there since I put it there on purpose?

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.091
Yeah, I can't help it.

01:16:29.191 --> 01:16:36.815
I just love the blues because I'm, like, so soulful, but also because you can suck at guitar and still play a blues progression.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:39.016
Can you tell I used to wear a fedora?

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:54.339
Eric is like if you took a physics undergrad in peak stonerdom, did a brain scan to find out all of his wildest delusions of grandeur, and then paid him a hundred million dollars to pretend that he achieved them all while never actually doing anything.

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.280
I have a super dope theory of everything, dudes.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.521
Watch me shred this blues lick.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:00.961
Oh fuck, I'm almost 60.

01:17:01.841 --> 01:17:15.305
Now remember, at the start of the pandemic, Peter Thiel actually did a podcast with this guy where he said he doesn't believe much of science anymore because the specialization makes it easier for people to lie and exaggerate.

01:17:18.086 --> 01:17:18.386
Right?

01:17:19.826 --> 01:17:24.207
Peter Thiel hasn't been on a lot of podcasts, you know, not in 2019.

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:28.849
But he kicked off the Portal podcast for Eric Weinstein.

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:30.409
Far out, man.

01:17:31.286 --> 01:17:32.727
Anyway, I think that's enough.

01:17:32.927 --> 01:17:35.668
It's pretty clear that Eric has been spiraling lately.

01:17:36.049 --> 01:17:38.810
His intellectual dark web is extinct.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:47.515
Most of the people who fell for his schtick in the early 2020s have pieced it together that he's completely full of shit and don't give him the time of day anymore.

01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:50.196
And since he doesn't actually do anything,

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:53.797
This fall from intranet relevance has really hit him hard.

01:17:54.217 --> 01:18:01.320
I'm sure Papa Teal isn't thrilled about it, which is why I hypothesize that he's moved on to bankrolling Sabina Hassenfelder.

01:18:09.858 --> 01:18:10.258
That one.

01:18:10.939 --> 01:18:21.708
Professor Dave seems to realize that she's now funded by him, which I don't really know if that's true or not, but he made that declaration not one month ago, which is kind of odd, right?

01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:26.332
Hence all her academia is communism bullshit she's been churning out.

01:18:26.813 --> 01:18:27.753
I don't have any proof.

01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:30.456
So listen to this, right?

01:18:30.776 --> 01:18:31.597
I've been saying it.

01:18:33.134 --> 01:18:40.838
Professor Dave, who believes in vaccines and viruses, definitely believes all of the bad biology because he's not a biologist.

01:18:41.779 --> 01:18:43.480
But he would be very mean to me.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.720
I can tell you that for sure.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.382
He would shred me like paper.

01:18:47.482 --> 01:18:48.302
I would be terrible.

01:18:48.322 --> 01:18:49.503
I mean, he's good at it.

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:52.345
His scripts are awful and he's terribly good at it.

01:18:53.165 --> 01:18:55.847
But this person has been shredded by him a number of times.

01:18:55.887 --> 01:18:58.288
The Weinsteins have been shredded by him a number of times.

01:18:58.808 --> 01:18:59.509
And so now,

01:19:01.397 --> 01:19:02.578
You have to be able to talk about stuff.

01:19:03.359 --> 01:19:04.721
And some of it's fun.

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:05.942
Yeah, it's fun.

01:19:05.982 --> 01:19:06.703
It's all super fun.

01:19:07.003 --> 01:19:07.484
It is right?

01:19:07.584 --> 01:19:07.744
Yeah.

01:19:07.924 --> 01:19:08.565
How'd you get started?

01:19:10.367 --> 01:19:16.975
Well, I didn't I obviously didn't always do podcasts, but I was originally I was wanting to make movies when I used to call it concrete.

01:19:17.055 --> 01:19:18.597
Why was it called it was called concrete.

01:19:18.657 --> 01:19:20.399
So okay, I'll tell you it was a

01:19:21.821 --> 01:19:24.044
First of all, I always wanted to make movies when I was a little kid.

01:19:24.605 --> 01:19:26.027
I was telling Jamie the story earlier.

01:19:26.047 --> 01:19:34.118
I was going to go to Full Sail where Jamie went in Florida, in Orlando, but I didn't have the money to do it and I couldn't get into UCF because my grades were shit.

01:19:35.252 --> 01:19:37.613
I think these are all film schools that people know about.

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:39.753
So he wanted to be in movies or make movies.

01:19:39.813 --> 01:19:42.674
See, this is already going in the wrong direction, right?

01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:47.135
Because I'm podcasting because I was a scientist and I wanted to be a podcaster.

01:19:47.155 --> 01:19:47.755
I mean, come on.

01:19:48.115 --> 01:19:48.535
High school.

01:19:49.095 --> 01:19:53.737
So luckily, I got the opportunity to work on this movie called Dolphin Tail.

01:19:54.797 --> 01:19:58.658
It was a movie about a dolphin who got its tail stuck in a crab trap.

01:19:58.978 --> 01:20:01.499
And Morgan Freeman came in and built a prosthetic tail.

01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:05.861
And it was swimming around in the aquarium, and Cary Connick Jr.

01:20:05.881 --> 01:20:14.130
and Morgan Freeman were in it, and it was like a big, you know... That movie, Dolphin Tale, will be viewed in this freaking house very soon.

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.232
Whoa!

01:20:17.033 --> 01:20:20.957
And I realized, working as a camera production assistant on that movie,

01:20:22.222 --> 01:20:24.964
It was my film school, but I realized I did not want anything to do with making movies.

01:20:25.284 --> 01:20:28.667
Cause it was the closest thing I ever experienced to work in construction.

01:20:29.548 --> 01:20:37.794
It was like, I was in charge of swapping the camera lenses, the camera batteries, taking the SD cards back to the media truck, getting everybody breakfast and coffee.

01:20:38.374 --> 01:20:41.136
And these dudes, these camera department dudes, a lot of them are really cool.

01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:43.118
Like the dude Pete Zuccherini, who was the underwater.

01:20:43.198 --> 01:20:44.379
This all sounds true to me.

01:20:44.959 --> 01:21:11.203
Just to let you know our cinematographer who filmed all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies He was fucking awesome But a lot of the other guys were like really unhappy like deeply unhappy because they never saw their families They were always on the road faced a lot of them on there like third fourth wives Face timing their kids and it was like, you know, they were like carnies with dental plans They made great money, but they were the noises that Rogan weekly unhappy so like I realized I didn't want to make movies anymore and

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:21.978
So I started an advertising company and make commercials and I started doing like spec ads and like that doesn't really make sense because a commercial is still a set.

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:36.369
I thought so, you know, it's weird unless he's making like, you know, product shots winning a bunch of contests to make commercials and one really one big contest for Land Rover USA where we made like a free ad and they paid us to make a bunch of other ads for him.

01:21:37.654 --> 01:21:39.275
And then that's where Concrete came in.

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:47.318
So it was called something else and I got sued by some advertising company in California saying, hey bitch, can't use this name anymore, change your name.

01:21:47.518 --> 01:21:57.822
So my friend who owns a concrete construction company said, bro, there's this really cool website domain for sale with concrete with a K. He's like, it's like a couple thousand bucks.

01:21:57.842 --> 01:21:58.622
You should buy it.

01:21:58.642 --> 01:21:59.162
I was gonna buy it.

01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:00.303
I'm like, sure, fuck yeah, let's do it.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:06.311
So I called my company concrete stupid and then um, and how'd you start a podcast?

01:22:06.611 --> 01:22:14.404
So so after the advertising stuff I started I Met a bunch of people I met

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:17.040
Met a bunch of people.

01:22:17.061 --> 01:22:17.341
Okay.

01:22:17.361 --> 01:22:19.942
So here's where the lying starts right before this.

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:33.346
There's no light now now he's gonna start pretty much lying his ass in the process of the whole advertising thing because me and Hulk live like five minutes from each other and Stupid and then um, and how'd you start a podcast?

01:22:33.666 --> 01:22:37.788
So so after the advertising stuff I started

01:22:40.499 --> 01:22:41.220
I met a bunch of people.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:50.009
I met Hulk Hogan in the process of the whole advertising thing, because me and Hulk live like five minutes from each other, which is like five minutes from the Church of Scientology, which is great.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:56.716
And I started making a bunch of commercials with him, because he would always have companies that would hit him up and say, yo, let's partner on this new product.

01:22:56.736 --> 01:22:58.698
OK, so why is Hulk Hogan important?

01:23:00.099 --> 01:23:01.260
Well, warning, 2016, here it comes.

01:23:03.973 --> 01:23:06.374
These people are all on a script.

01:23:06.474 --> 01:23:13.016
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an article by Derek Thompson from the Atlantic in PDF form here.

01:23:13.036 --> 01:23:14.517
I'm just going to read it a little bit to you.

01:23:15.177 --> 01:23:27.681
Basically what happened is the magazine Gawker outed Peter Thiel as a gay man.

01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:32.983
And Peter Thiel couldn't do anything about it because Peter Thiel is a gay man.

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:50.658
And so in order to get back at Gawker, Peter Thiel used his big piles of money to hire a bunch of lawyers to scour the work of Gawker to find somebody who had a suitable case and would be willing to litigate against Gawker.

01:23:50.838 --> 01:23:56.380
And the person that Peter Thiel ended up finding was Hulk Hogan because

01:23:58.959 --> 01:24:01.120
It is also probably the strangest.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:13.724
In 2016, Hulk Hogan, the professional wrestler, won a nine-figure lawsuit that ultimately bankrupt Gawker Media, a fleet of sites that epitomized the barbed brilliance of New York's young media crowd.

01:24:14.244 --> 01:24:20.927
The lawsuit concerned a video of Hogan having consensual sex with his best friend's wife while at the same time

01:24:21.983 --> 01:24:42.098
recording the encounter secretly, according to Hogan and later reporting behind the scenes of this tawdry affair, more shocking story was playing out in which Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor seemed to be exercising a deep grudge against Gawker by bankrolling Hogan's lawsuit to destroy the media company that published the sex tape.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:45.941
Interesting, huh?

01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:55.014
that this whole theater that got Peter Thiel's man in a vice presidential position.

01:24:55.054 --> 01:25:11.339
Now think about how weird that is because in this book, in this sky horse publishing book, you know, Tony Lyons and CHD, in this sky horse publishing book from 2008, the epilogue tells a story of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:13.440
running for president as an independent and

01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:20.572
the Democratic or the Republican candidate taking him as vice president and then getting elected together.

01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:25.033
And then the president getting shot and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:25.073 --> 01:25:26.953
becoming president and saving America.

01:25:28.454 --> 01:25:33.134
This book from 2008 predicts almost exactly what happened, but didn't happen.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:41.376
And at the Republican convention, Hulk Hogan was one of the guys that was there to make sure that everybody really liked the choice of

01:25:43.089 --> 01:25:43.409
J.D.

01:25:43.469 --> 01:25:46.431
Vance, the man of Peter Thiel.

01:25:47.832 --> 01:25:48.552
Interesting.

01:25:48.993 --> 01:26:04.262
Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Joe Rogan, Substack, Podcast, Rule by Podcast, going to Germany and trying to figure out how people know things.

01:26:07.024 --> 01:26:08.545
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we got him.

01:26:09.690 --> 01:26:10.490
I think we got them.

01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:14.591
I think you should do a little more research on this while I do it too.

01:26:15.812 --> 01:26:17.532
But this is all one malevolent show.

01:26:17.592 --> 01:26:19.013
These are not serious people.

01:26:19.033 --> 01:26:26.495
These are paid influencers that are on social media to make us ask the wrong questions and to announce what's coming.

01:26:28.675 --> 01:26:30.916
And there's probably no other way to see it.

01:26:30.976 --> 01:26:33.317
These people are part of that show.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.317
They are scripted liars.

01:26:36.617 --> 01:26:37.818
They are part of the same

01:26:38.837 --> 01:26:39.157
thing.

01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:41.279
You gotta get off these platforms.

01:26:41.339 --> 01:26:43.521
This sub stack is shit.

01:26:44.101 --> 01:26:45.022
X is shit.

01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:46.583
Facebook is shit.

01:26:46.943 --> 01:26:55.570
You have to start using independent media and if you don't have any independent media to use then you'll have something else to do with your time besides social media.

01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:57.392
These people are not serious.

01:26:58.132 --> 01:27:09.500
Laura Loomer was auditioning with the same group of podcasters that Soph, the daughter of Sasha Latapova, was auditioning with when she was promoted by Alex Jones in 2019.

01:27:10.421 --> 01:27:12.983
They're both on the same thumbnails together.

01:27:13.923 --> 01:27:22.710
This is all one malevolent show scripted from way back, put in place way back, and funded way, way back.

01:27:23.632 --> 01:27:39.018
That's why this lady who was on billboards swaying votes in the UK 20 years ago is now a rich person who owns property on two continents and still telling the same bullshit story in front of Congress two days ago.

01:27:40.318 --> 01:27:45.580
She is a scripted fraud like the rest of the health freedom movement is, just like Brian Hooker is.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.981
They have all sold us out.

01:27:48.241 --> 01:27:50.482
They have all sold us out.

01:27:52.025 --> 01:27:53.386
They are coordinated liars.

01:27:53.646 --> 01:27:56.747
They are all on the same script and you can't change it.

01:27:56.767 --> 01:28:00.549
You can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:03.070
And I have lied.

01:28:03.251 --> 01:28:04.131
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:28:04.151 --> 01:28:05.071
I don't want to lie.

01:28:05.552 --> 01:28:06.912
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:28:07.012 --> 01:28:08.053
I try not to be a liar.

01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:08.933
I don't want to be a liar.

01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:12.215
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:28:17.382 --> 01:28:19.945
All on the same script, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:19.985 --> 01:28:21.046
I don't know what to tell you.

01:28:21.166 --> 01:28:21.947
It's an illusion.

01:28:22.107 --> 01:28:23.228
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:28:23.268 --> 01:28:23.988
was an illusion.

01:28:24.028 --> 01:28:28.072
When he says that he never wanted to get involved with the Novak's people, I assure you it's true.

01:28:31.595 --> 01:28:32.897
I assure you it is true.

01:28:34.087 --> 01:28:38.308
There's no way that they didn't know that this is actually an anticipated background.

01:28:38.348 --> 01:28:41.909
There's just no way these people didn't understand what was done with the PCR tests.

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:47.971
And the ones that didn't understand are just idiots on Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone's very, very malevolent script.

01:28:48.011 --> 01:28:52.393
The same people definitely could have told you that placebo made it safe.

01:28:52.413 --> 01:28:55.433
They would never have risked transfecting everyone.

01:28:55.994 --> 01:28:57.654
But instead, none of them told you that.

01:28:57.694 --> 01:29:00.195
They argued about all kinds of other shit for five years.

01:29:01.018 --> 01:29:04.702
They're all nasty, nasty scripted traitors.

01:29:06.443 --> 01:29:12.789
That's also why none of these people seem to be aware of a population pyramid problem that might be shared across the West.

01:29:13.635 --> 01:29:18.419
and anticipated rise in all cause mortality that could have been sculpted using murder and lies.

01:29:18.439 --> 01:29:21.941
You know, like letting the opioid crisis run wild in America for five years.

01:29:22.101 --> 01:29:25.083
All of these people are scripted never to come to that conclusion.

01:29:25.103 --> 01:29:31.888
I mean, even people like Pierre Corey and Jessica Rose were scripted to say it was not opioids.

01:29:36.191 --> 01:29:40.575
And these people have also been scripted not to know anything about anything.

01:29:41.414 --> 01:29:47.716
Never to assemble a list and certainly never ever to realize that supplementary oxygen is pretty nasty.

01:29:48.136 --> 01:29:51.178
Never ever to realize that opioid deaths were a problem.

01:29:53.178 --> 01:30:03.482
And so it's gotten even worse because these actors were put in place and I'm going to just get this out of here really quick and then I'm going to insert a video here as a new slide.

01:30:05.063 --> 01:30:05.943
Hold on one second.

01:30:07.887 --> 01:30:09.189
Because there's another one here.

01:30:09.269 --> 01:30:12.192
Oh, I could probably do that really quick, couldn't I?

01:30:12.212 --> 01:30:15.916
I'll take this one over here.

01:30:15.997 --> 01:30:17.438
I mean, this is just shocking.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.701
I can't put together the slide deck quick enough.

01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:20.482
That's the problem.

01:30:20.522 --> 01:30:24.246
It takes me too long because it's so freaking malevolent.

01:30:24.446 --> 01:30:25.628
You can't even believe it.

01:30:29.813 --> 01:30:35.977
And so I'm still building, you know, slides right up until the time I'm starting because it's just so hardcore.

01:30:36.158 --> 01:30:38.559
I can't believe how hardcore it is.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.281
Um, why?

01:30:42.582 --> 01:30:44.063
Oh, there's not enough disc space.

01:30:44.183 --> 01:30:44.784
Oh my gosh.

01:30:44.804 --> 01:30:45.704
So I'm really running it out.

01:30:45.804 --> 01:30:48.166
I'm going to see if I can just play it without that then.

01:30:49.067 --> 01:30:51.348
Um, where was it in this one?

01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.249
Yeah.

01:30:53.404 --> 01:30:53.924
Let's see.

01:30:53.964 --> 01:30:58.629
Now we know that they were doing a lot of therapies that ended up killing the people.

01:30:58.769 --> 01:31:04.274
You know, the therapies were the ones that were actually deadly, but they were trying, you know, you can't blame the doctors, right?

01:31:04.294 --> 01:31:06.115
They were trying their best, doing what they could.

01:31:06.636 --> 01:31:08.177
They didn't really know what to do in the beginning.

01:31:08.217 --> 01:31:10.819
That's kind of why you never want to be the first to catch an illness, right?

01:31:10.859 --> 01:31:15.143
Because then you're the one that they're experimenting on and they don't know exactly how to treat it just yet.

01:31:15.183 --> 01:31:16.464
They don't have all this information.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.266
They're putting a lot of people on ventilators.

01:31:18.426 --> 01:31:20.027
This is Kim Iverson yesterday.

01:31:20.828 --> 01:31:26.030
trying to tell you a narrative about how none of this could have been known because it's a new virus.

01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:34.233
This is the hamster wheel coming back just like it does all the time, this time with Kim Iverson, whose show I've actually been on.

01:31:34.773 --> 01:31:37.654
This is how malevolent it is, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:38.414 --> 01:31:43.076
Her primary streaming is on Rumble, which is, of course, owned by Peter Thiel.

01:31:43.996 --> 01:31:46.497
And now they don't do that anymore.

01:31:46.557 --> 01:31:48.918
From the best of my knowledge, they don't do that anymore.

01:31:49.383 --> 01:31:51.107
So they couldn't oxygenate.

01:31:51.648 --> 01:31:53.934
So they raised the vent settings.

01:31:53.954 --> 01:31:57.963
I'm board certified in anesthesia as part of my subspecialty certification.

01:31:58.604 --> 01:31:59.025
And so

01:32:00.287 --> 01:32:02.869
That's what happened when you're all filled with fluid.

01:32:02.889 --> 01:32:05.892
When you see the fluid on the outside, it's also on the inside.

01:32:05.992 --> 01:32:14.238
Your third spacing, it's called, you have all of this and you can't exchange, you can't get the oxygen you're breathing in into your bloodstream to deliver it to your vital organs.

01:32:14.699 --> 01:32:24.447
And so the increase in the vent settings that look like they were dangerous vent settings are the last ditch effort to save these people's lives.

01:32:24.547 --> 01:32:27.349
Now, the fact that it's payable and all that kind of hoot nanny,

01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:35.192
But there's no doctor that I've been doing this, I graduated med school in 1993, that would ever do it for the money.

01:32:35.572 --> 01:32:40.874
They were trying, it was the last ditch, we're trying to, we can't oxygenate, we can't ventilate, okay?

01:32:41.054 --> 01:32:46.356
So that whole thing, and I know there's doctors on my side of the narrative, but I'm here to tell the truth.

01:32:46.776 --> 01:32:50.638
And I just, that really does bother me, so I'm glad I was able to say that.

01:32:51.939 --> 01:32:56.982
I can't watch any of that anymore because it's so stupid, but there is no way to see it any other way.

01:32:57.042 --> 01:32:59.144
This is a scripted team of liars.

01:33:00.665 --> 01:33:04.208
I'm gonna play a little song here and then I'll be back in a minute.

01:33:04.828 --> 01:33:05.869
Jeez, it's painful.

01:33:06.129 --> 01:33:06.810
My gosh.

01:37:36.038 --> 01:37:47.329
You know, we've heard over and over and over again industry canards and, you know, things that are cringeworthy to me as a parent and as a scientist.

01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:58.219
The preponderance of evidence around vaccines and autism basically in the United States consists of two studies.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:12.279
And so here is Brian Hooker, who in 2013, as a former Department of Energy genetic scientist, did not use the word autism, didn't like the word autism, because his son didn't have autism.

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.222
His son was neurologically damaged.

01:38:16.038 --> 01:38:28.681
And now he's on a script provided to him by these people where he says autism is real and it's caused by some amorphous thing called the vaccination schedule that he's not really sure how to fight.

01:38:30.103 --> 01:38:40.831
and therefore hasn't really gotten anywhere and instead has spent the last six years or seven years or eight years, certainly the last six years since Brett Brandy Vaughn and Tony bark were murdered.

01:38:41.252 --> 01:38:45.935
He's spent building a big top tent of health freedom that doesn't solve any problems at all.

01:38:47.016 --> 01:38:51.960
Has sold a book with sky horse publishing and still gets paid like $200,000 a year to do nothing but be on zoom.

01:38:56.331 --> 01:39:00.274
Now I do think that he's kind of a victim of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:00.554 --> 01:39:02.735
and Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield.

01:39:04.176 --> 01:39:12.622
I do think he's kind of a victim in this because he's got a son and so he's got, you know, very limited choices on what to do, I think, if his son is real.

01:39:14.863 --> 01:39:16.685
But this guy is a scripted fraud.

01:39:17.697 --> 01:39:18.918
He was promised something.

01:39:19.039 --> 01:39:21.021
I guess maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:24.404
would be vice president of Donald Trump, but they didn't quite make it.

01:39:24.464 --> 01:39:27.668
So now he's health and human services secretary and they have to make the best of it.

01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:30.110
But this is a scripted lie.

01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:36.898
And it's a scripted lie that is reflected in that 2008 book and the epilogue of this fricking book.

01:39:37.739 --> 01:39:39.501
They always intended to do this.

01:39:42.881 --> 01:39:52.343
And this bullshit in front of the Senate and CHD raising money on the idea that, you know, we've been fighting for 15 years and we're finally there?

01:39:53.984 --> 01:39:54.564
Come on.

01:39:55.684 --> 01:40:06.467
If it's as simple as intramuscular injection is just plain dumb, then there's no other alternative than to accept the fact that these people were put in place and scripted to never get us there.

01:40:08.666 --> 01:40:19.342
That's who Brian Hooker, Pauly Tommy, Mary Holland, James Lyons-Weiler, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Judy Mickiewicz, and Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, they're all are that!

01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:31.973
that were done by a flawed and fraudulent CDC, one on thimerosal-containing vaccines and one on the MMR vaccine.

01:40:32.093 --> 01:40:41.137
Clearly, in the MMR study, when you look at the table, it shows a statistically significant effect of the MMR when given on time.

01:40:41.897 --> 01:40:50.481
Sixty-seven percent more boys getting the vaccine on time get autism diagnosis than those that merely wait until three years of age.

01:40:51.101 --> 01:40:57.286
Now, I had a whistleblower come forward to me to tell this information, Dr. William Tonsman, in 2013.

01:40:57.766 --> 01:41:16.841
And as I predicted, this is all what Brian was scripted to say, and he's probably promised he was going to get to say it a lot earlier, but then the pandemic came, and it delayed everything, and it paused all kinds of lawsuits that were about ready to win, and Mary Holland was about to dunk, but then the pandemic came, and then they couldn't finish anything.

01:41:18.722 --> 01:41:19.383
Stop lying!

01:41:22.015 --> 01:41:22.695
in 2014.

01:41:23.676 --> 01:41:31.319
We also know that the Verstratten study in 2003 is also flawed, fraught with errors, and fraudulent.

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:46.865
What do all these errors in all of these papers mean if intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the 1800s that apparently people like Suzanne Humphreys and her historian co-author Roman Byzantic couldn't ever come up with?

01:41:47.844 --> 01:41:51.947
but Mark Kulak could cover it thoroughly in about a weeks and a half worth of work.

01:41:51.987 --> 01:41:54.409
And he's already got it archived on his fricking website.

01:41:54.989 --> 01:41:57.091
These people are the worst kinds of traitors.

01:41:57.912 --> 01:42:00.234
They have been following a script for decades.

01:42:01.034 --> 01:42:09.761
Accusing them of directly cherry picking information from the vaccine safety data link because of issues with clinics.

01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:16.006
Now there is a hole in the science around vaccines and autism that you can drive a Mack truck through.

01:42:18.047 --> 01:42:24.096
Yeah, it's a hole where Brian Hooker of 2013 would have said that you don't even, shouldn't even call it autism.

01:42:24.196 --> 01:42:25.999
Autism is not a word that he liked.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.262
Because it's a stupid word.

01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:38.711
that they are using to rope in more and more developmental disorders to make sure that nobody ever comes to the conclusion that intramuscular injection is just dumb.

01:42:39.172 --> 01:42:49.743
The same way that nobody came to that conclusion with infantile pluralisis was going crazy in the early 1915s, 18s, whatever, when Mark Kulak has shown it in spades.

01:42:50.967 --> 01:42:57.109
They just couldn't accept the fact that there is no good combination of substances to inject intramuscularly.

01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:59.149
Maybe it wasn't the sperm oil.

01:42:59.209 --> 01:43:05.291
Maybe it was the lamb's wool oil, or, you know, maybe we should advance this a little bit and, and dissolve it in other lipids.

01:43:07.472 --> 01:43:19.535
But obviously some form of intramuscular injection will work right fricking here is one of these assholes on a script taking the money because someone else would have if he didn't.

01:43:20.936 --> 01:43:26.259
You can't just look at one vaccine and one component and then wave your pixie dust and say they're safe.

01:43:26.419 --> 01:43:28.000
That is just not a fact.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.021
And that is just not how science works.

01:43:30.462 --> 01:43:32.023
Imagine that he didn't get there.

01:43:32.383 --> 01:43:33.584
He just didn't get there.

01:43:36.746 --> 01:43:45.591
CHD children's health defense did not get there in all the years of their existence, all of their work, all of the money.

01:43:47.202 --> 01:43:52.084
They are still thanking you and still claiming that they are fighting the mandate.

01:43:52.124 --> 01:43:55.965
You know, I can show you in my email because I still get emails from these frauds.

01:43:57.126 --> 01:44:04.669
If we look at the email that I got today from CHD, should be here somewhere.

01:44:04.689 --> 01:44:08.110
I have a package coming today.

01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:08.710
Sweet!

01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:10.931
I like getting boxes.

01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:11.691
Where did I put it?

01:44:11.771 --> 01:44:12.572
I didn't delete it.

01:44:12.612 --> 01:44:13.612
I know I didn't delete it.

01:44:15.233 --> 01:44:17.116
But anyway, I don't, there it is.

01:44:17.777 --> 01:44:19.339
Watch, this hasn't happened in 20 years.

01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:20.320
So let me just take this.

01:44:21.182 --> 01:44:22.604
Can I pull this email out?

01:44:26.529 --> 01:44:27.751
I can close this.

01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:28.432
So anyway.

01:44:29.701 --> 01:44:35.145
For the first time in over 20 years, our government has held a hearing on the impact of vaccines, and CHD was there.

01:44:35.225 --> 01:44:43.412
Our own Polly, Tommy, and Brian Hooker joined several other parents of vaccine-injured people, and the hearing was proof that we are breaking through.

01:44:43.932 --> 01:44:48.676
Please donate today to help us keep the pressure on government officials to end mandates.

01:44:48.696 --> 01:44:58.084
And then we go scroll all the way to the bottom, and the other blue highlighted phrase is, please donate today to help us keep the pressure on government officials to end

01:44:58.684 --> 01:45:01.705
mandatory childhood vaccines for children.

01:45:04.446 --> 01:45:15.951
So after all this time and all this possibility given to them by coronavirus and the fake pandemic, they have only managed to continue to

01:45:17.566 --> 01:45:30.288
work against mandates, because people should have a choice as to whether or not they hit their kids in the head with a baseball bat, and they should have choice of how many times they hit them, and in what side of the head they hit them, and at what age they hit them.

01:45:32.989 --> 01:45:35.389
CHD is the- is really shit.

01:45:36.909 --> 01:45:38.210
They are really, really shit.

01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:45.311
And it's- it's terrible, because they fooled me like they fooled so many other people.

01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:48.934
There is no way it's possible.

01:46:04.449 --> 01:46:08.432
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

01:46:08.672 --> 01:46:11.335
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

01:46:11.815 --> 01:46:15.978
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

01:46:16.038 --> 01:46:19.121
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

01:46:20.462 --> 01:46:28.128
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

01:46:28.568 --> 01:46:30.049
All of that was on a global basis.

01:46:31.831 --> 01:46:33.292
That's a liar on a script.

01:46:34.437 --> 01:46:44.430
It's a well-rehearsed liar on a script who has no excuse not to know that this was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that needed to be managed across the Western Hemisphere.

01:46:45.851 --> 01:47:00.723
And this rise in all-cause mortality is something we're still dealing with now, and we will probably deal with for the next 10 or 20 years as our population pyramid becomes more inverted before it finally kind of corrects itself if they keep immigration going as it is.

01:47:00.803 --> 01:47:09.510
So, Denny Rancourt, all of these people were put in place specifically to lie about this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, make sure that nobody ever figured it out.

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:26.308
And now they have people on Kim Iverson claiming that they know all about respiratory shit, but they have no idea that supplementary oxygen given at 60 liters a minute pure might actually cause ARDS and, you know, be confused with COVID if that was what was scripted.

01:47:28.489 --> 01:47:30.890
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth.

01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:34.972
Ladies and gentlemen, it was just a placebo and using their PCR test doesn't make

01:47:35.925 --> 01:47:40.349
COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 real any more than it makes you a virologist.

01:47:40.389 --> 01:47:42.991
So, I don't know what to tell you anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:43.011 --> 01:47:45.073
We are smashing this out of the park now.

01:47:45.493 --> 01:47:46.754
Thank you very much for being here.

01:47:46.814 --> 01:47:51.719
Make sure you work diligently to get your kids off of social media at the very bare minimum.

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:59.004
you need to make very clear to them that coordinated lying on social media is how they intend to govern us going forward.

01:47:59.464 --> 01:48:06.749
And so more than ever it is important to have single sources of information, people who are doing analysis on their own and not

01:48:07.549 --> 01:48:22.555
engaged in a conversation with like three or four people, because if I do a stream with Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose and Kevin McCairn, then whatever comes out of that stream will inevitably be what they want to if they're all scripted liars.

01:48:22.695 --> 01:48:29.238
So ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dum-dum-dum.

01:48:30.158 --> 01:48:35.363
Transfection in healthy humans is always dangerous and viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:48:35.623 --> 01:48:37.225
Damn, we are killing it!

01:48:37.925 --> 01:48:38.946
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

01:48:38.966 --> 01:48:44.511
You can find my academic work on PubMed under the last name Cooey, first name JJ.

01:48:45.052 --> 01:48:47.334
Buy that book because we're gonna need it.

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.876
And if you want to, you could even send it to P.O.

01:48:50.316 --> 01:48:50.476
Box

01:48:53.318 --> 01:49:09.964
802 in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15 102 and then I'll sign it for you and send it on to you I don't know how long I can keep doing that depending but I can use media mail and media mail is very cheap for me to send it so signing the book and Annotating it writing a love letter to you or you know, I could sign it.

01:49:10.004 --> 01:49:16.846
However you want to that's something we could do I've got a couple YouTube channels, but I don't really care Oh

01:49:20.256 --> 01:49:21.537
This is perfect timing.

01:49:21.597 --> 01:49:22.417
I'm so excited.

01:49:22.458 --> 01:49:23.598
We're just going to do this.

01:49:24.299 --> 01:49:25.339
We're just going to do it.

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:26.960
Do it to it.

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:28.542
What?

01:49:29.242 --> 01:49:29.842
Is it not on?

01:49:30.943 --> 01:49:31.203
Shoot.

01:49:31.323 --> 01:49:32.464
Okay, I got to turn this camera on.

01:49:33.565 --> 01:49:38.928
And then I'm going to show you how to install the Peertube app.

01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:43.552
So the first thing I got to do is get out of here and I'm going to delete the Peertube app from my phone.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.109
So I can show you how easy it is, but it's actually really tricky.

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.050
That's the funny thing.

01:49:50.091 --> 01:49:51.854
So I'm going to delete it, remove the app.

01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:53.882
Delete the app, all the data.

01:49:54.882 --> 01:49:55.583
Yes, delete it.

01:49:56.143 --> 01:49:56.603
There it goes.

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.944
Okay, so here we go.

01:50:00.065 --> 01:50:00.665
This should work.

01:50:01.266 --> 01:50:01.546
Yes.

01:50:03.046 --> 01:50:03.767
I don't know what that is.

01:50:06.488 --> 01:50:08.869
Party, oh yeah, Party Pro Manager.

01:50:08.889 --> 01:50:16.333
I don't need you to see that, but I'm starting, I'm gonna start working with my gym for some photography to try and make some extra money.

01:50:16.373 --> 01:50:17.494
That's what that was there for.

01:50:17.874 --> 01:50:19.535
And that goes here, this goes here.

01:50:20.035 --> 01:50:20.915
Okay, so check this out.

01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:24.739
Can I do it before that's over?

01:50:24.759 --> 01:50:25.099
I don't know.

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:29.763
So we're going to go to the App Store and we're going to click on the App Store.

01:50:30.824 --> 01:50:35.608
And then we're going to search for PeerTube.

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:39.712
There's PeerTube.

01:50:40.192 --> 01:50:46.057
And then it'll come up, usually the second one, and it's PeerTube with the little squid with the hat.

01:50:46.097 --> 01:50:49.420
So of course I have it on the cloud already because I just deleted it from here.

01:50:52.831 --> 01:50:55.132
And so you open the PeerTube app.

01:50:55.172 --> 01:50:59.013
And now here's where it gets a little tricky because it's hard to find where it is.

01:50:59.053 --> 01:51:00.133
You got to know where to go.

01:51:00.773 --> 01:51:02.034
And so it'll come up like this.

01:51:02.934 --> 01:51:04.074
You got to go to explore.

01:51:04.694 --> 01:51:08.695
And then when you go to explore there, it looks like you should just put in the whoops.

01:51:09.075 --> 01:51:10.476
It looks like you should just put in the.

01:51:12.377 --> 01:51:15.040
The, the, is that going to show up?

01:51:15.141 --> 01:51:16.402
Sorry, I'm being a dork here.

01:51:16.883 --> 01:51:24.292
It looks like you should put in the URL here, but that's actually not true because if you put it here, it's going to search for already registered Peertube stuff.

01:51:24.312 --> 01:51:26.194
So if you go to Peertube platforms,

01:51:26.875 --> 01:51:31.217
It still won't show up here because it's not really, I mean, I don't know what I have to do to get it on there.

01:51:31.237 --> 01:51:42.463
But anyway, if you search peer-to-platforms and you just go blunk, blunk, blunk, and put dumb letters in, and it can't find anything, then it will add platform with its URL.

01:51:42.523 --> 01:51:51.207
So if you do that, you can go like this, and then you can go stream.gigaohm.

01:51:58.404 --> 01:51:58.985
And connect.

01:52:00.105 --> 01:52:00.985
And you confirm.

01:52:03.266 --> 01:52:05.066
And then it will say, do you want to log in?

01:52:05.106 --> 01:52:06.666
And remember, we don't need to log in.

01:52:07.246 --> 01:52:08.767
And we don't have any logins yet.

01:52:08.867 --> 01:52:13.808
I mean, Mark and I have a login because we post there, but you can just close this and now look what's here.

01:52:14.848 --> 01:52:21.929
It's populated all the videos that are put up and they're populated in order and they're on your phone and it plays even better than the website.

01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:23.930
No logins.

01:52:25.227 --> 01:52:28.328
No logins, no passwords, very small app.

01:52:28.948 --> 01:52:32.349
It won't bring you any other videos other than Mark and I until you add them.

01:52:32.869 --> 01:52:38.431
So if you follow those simple instructions you can have GigaOM on your phone and watch it at your convenience.

01:52:38.471 --> 01:52:40.572
It's also easy to put on an iPad.

01:52:41.252 --> 01:52:44.873
I think this just kicks ass and I think Ted and Peertube

01:52:45.593 --> 01:52:49.257
And our work there is moving forward in such a great way.

01:52:50.238 --> 01:52:51.519
Thank you very much for being here.

01:52:51.539 --> 01:53:00.988
I can't stress enough how happy I am that this is all going so well, and that Mark has done such incredible work recently.

01:53:01.108 --> 01:53:01.469
It's just...

01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:09.377
It's nice because finally it really feels as though somebody is listening and hearing me.

01:53:10.338 --> 01:53:15.684
And even if it took five years, I think I've finally convinced somebody that I'm not nuts.

01:53:16.044 --> 01:53:17.406
And it's taken a long time.

01:53:17.486 --> 01:53:19.028
So thanks very much.

01:53:19.528 --> 01:53:22.892
If you can, please go to Gigoloan Biological and find a way to support this work.

01:53:22.932 --> 01:53:23.392
It is really

01:53:24.496 --> 01:53:48.666
On a shoestring budget that we're working right now, and I don't want to post to substack I don't want to give away my thoughts and ideas to those platforms, and I certainly don't want them taking a cut So I don't know how we're gonna move forward But I do think that one of the greatest ways we could move forward is by a peer tube so sharing that idea and and selling it to your family and friends that this guy is

01:53:49.346 --> 01:53:57.529
And this work is on a platform that doesn't have algorithms, that won't serve you anything else, and it doesn't require a login.

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:01.791
It's not going to take any of the data from your phone.

01:54:01.811 --> 01:54:03.392
You don't have to give it any permissions.

01:54:03.452 --> 01:54:06.633
It's really quite remarkable how nice of an app it is.

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:08.234
The only thing I can tell you is that if you

01:54:08.974 --> 01:54:13.357
If you minimize a video that you're playing, you're not going to be able to bring it back up to view again.

01:54:13.377 --> 01:54:17.881
You're going to have to go out of the app and start the video over because for some reason I don't know how to do that.

01:54:17.921 --> 01:54:19.262
But other than that, it works great.

01:54:20.243 --> 01:54:21.263
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

01:54:21.303 --> 01:54:25.346
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I will see you tomorrow.

01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:34.253
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:54:34.533 --> 01:54:35.214
Stop lying!
