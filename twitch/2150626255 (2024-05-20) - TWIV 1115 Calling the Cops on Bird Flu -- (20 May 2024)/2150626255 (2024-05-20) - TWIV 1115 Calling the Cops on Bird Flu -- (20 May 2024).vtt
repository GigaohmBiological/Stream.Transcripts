00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
I think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
We want everybody to feel good. That's not the way life is.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
You

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
You

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
As a surgeon, you should be speaking out on this. You could save lives.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Dude, what the fuck? I didn't know anything about this. How am I meant to know about this?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You know what? I don't know about everything.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I can

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
You shouldn't think that just because you're on to something that someone else should be doing it to, buddy.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
We've all got our own jobs to do. I don't tell you what to do.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
What the fuck?

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Anyway, I mean, the reason why I try to get through to you, get your number, call you and you're busy last time and I'm not busy

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
is that, look, I went back through the podcast and I'm afraid

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I think it wasn't good enough mate.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I don't know how to explain this to you, but

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
you know, it was about, it was just over an hour, but the thing is

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
what was relevant was like literally just 15 minutes and

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
it was just dragged out and there was not enough substance, not enough facts, not enough details.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
I would also say try and work on your presentation.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
You drag things out and speak very slowly and

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
it's just you need to be a bit more punchy, a bit more punchy,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
a bit more animated, a bit more lively.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
I mean, I don't know if you're just a bit flat that day or what. I don't know.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
His name is J. J. Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
and I believe he has a PhD in

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

07:06.000 --> 07:18.000
Good morning from Pittsburgh,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Pennsylvania. It's 1051 and I'm late for the 10-10 appointment

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
that I had today to dispel the enchantment with you.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
But I am here and pushing the button as often as possible.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
I am not Mark Koolak about to spring together nearly 30 days of continuous broadcast.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
But I am trying to follow his lead and make sure that I'm here regularly.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
There's a lot of balls to juggle and if you don't show up every day to throw a few more in the air,

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
the balls start to hit the ground really fast.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
Your consciousness is still the prime real estate that all these people are positioning themselves to control

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
and what you perceive is probably not true yet

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
because you probably haven't been working as hard as I have

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
to try and understand it now. That could be.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
There are obviously people here that are an exception to that rule.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Most of the people in the chat are here every day.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
There's a group of about 35 or 40 of you guys that are just shout out to you guys.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
This is really impressive.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
There still is really no evidence of spread in New York City.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Infectious clones are still the only thing that nobody can really seem to usefully talk about.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Placebo batches are still just something that nobody really says out loud.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Different doses is very different than placebo batches.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Transfection in healthy mammals is dumb.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
It's actually criminally negligent. Nobody seems to be able to say that either.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
They seem also weary of mentioning that the protocols were murder.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Never trying to explore what other parts of the protocol might have contributed to the murder

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
but rather they want us to settle on a couple dumb ideas.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Gain of function is still a mythology. They're trying to get us to teach our children

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
and this mystery that we're supposed to solve about a gain of function virus

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
with the dog called Scooby-Doo is still happening.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And it's because of a spectacular commitment to lies.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
All of these people are spectacularly committed to telling the lies that they were paid

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
or coerced into telling from the very beginning.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And you will see a very consistent pattern on the Internet.

09:40.000 --> 09:50.000
Now ladies and gentlemen of people trying to attribute bad motives to me.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Bad motives because they don't want to talk about the basic biological principles

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
and statements that we are trying to focus on here.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But instead they want you to believe that I attacked people

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
or was interfering somehow with or slandering them or something like this.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
When in reality you know if you do a stream with Vajon Health and Charles Rixi

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
and someone who calls himself the raccoon commander

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
you might not be choosing your forums very well.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
And if you present with slides that are just covered with words

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
and slides you choose to just kind of skip this one and skip that one.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
There are people who can see through that.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
There are people who can see that that's just patently bullshit.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
That you are not usefully trying to help anyone understand the illusion

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
but you're just really throwing a little more smoke.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Making a little more mud in the water so that no one can really see very far.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Because in the end everybody's trying to climb this ladder

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
to get on board with these people.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
These weaponized piles of money that are slowly trying to erase our history.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
These weaponized piles of money that have been using public health as an excuse

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
to govern us with pharmacology, govern us with toxins.

11:17.000 --> 11:28.000
They've been trying for decades to figure out a way to get control of the population problem as they call it.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And these forward facing brochure people that we have been made to believe

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
by the TV or the people we're supposed to oppose

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
are actually just comic book actors in a show with many more layers.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
And if we want to make gentle the life of this world as we step out of this mythology

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
we're going to have to focus very very much on the biology.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
Especially in America because in America right now we are divided amongst ourselves

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
in a very dangerous way and it's because it's by design.

12:04.000 --> 12:14.000
But I think that if we teach our children to see the wave

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and we teach our children to ride the wave

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I think we can all reach the shore.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
Not only reach the shore but we can reach the shore in style.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
But you're going to have to learn the biology.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
You're going to have to teach your children the way that this system has

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
the waves of this system have been used against us.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And the waves of this system are lies.

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
The waves of this system are an actual focus

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
on trying to control the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
If you want to break out of this wave you're going to have to stay focused on the biology.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
You can't take the bait on social media and you've got to learn to love your neighbor again.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
You've got to learn again what that means.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
So much of our time on social media spends separating us

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
and getting us to explore thought patterns that would have never otherwise been

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
exposed to.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And so we need a wake up call.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
And maybe gig ome biological can be that wake up call for some people.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
That's all I can really hope at this stage.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
It's one person at a time.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Anyway, I'm so happy that there's 48 people here.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It's going to be a jazz show today.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
We're going to do a little bit of a repeat, a little bit of a recap of what we've been doing

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
over the last couple weeks because we've actually set a lot of fires under people's feet.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
And the responses that we are getting are actually very interesting.

13:59.000 --> 14:09.000
I actually think that a recording that I made this weekend may possibly have been part of an effort

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
to try and trap me somehow in some way.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It's also possible that I'm completely mistaken and paranoid.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
And so I'm going to move carefully forward with regard to what I do next.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But that's why I wasn't on yesterday.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
I had an interview yesterday and the interview went very well.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
The interview went very well, but I also felt as though there was a possibility.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Well, I'll get to it in a second.

14:46.000 --> 15:07.000
Good morning, everybody.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
May all your primers be nested indeed.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
What a great idea that is.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm going to say that all the time now. Thank you very much, infectious clone. What a great phrase.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
It is the 20th of May, 2024. I apologize for not being online yesterday.

15:24.000 --> 15:34.000
I did do an interview with a gentleman from Canada who was quite cordial in asking to do the interview, but also a bit strange.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
And up until very recently, I've just attributed that to him being a French Canadian and are having a little bit of a language.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Interesting language difficulty.

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
But yesterday, I was recording the interview.

15:51.000 --> 16:00.000
At the end of the interview, he reminded me that that in the course of our communications before the interview, he had asked me not to stream it live.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
And I remember, you know, kind of thinking to myself, Oh, man, I don't really like that.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
And I also remember thinking to myself, well, you know, whatever, it's okay. He's a nice guy. And I just went on.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
And then the interview came up Sunday.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And again, I didn't stream it, obviously.

16:19.000 --> 16:30.000
And we got to the end of the interview and he said that he was, again, you know, was going to take him a few weeks, maybe up to four weeks in order for the interview to be posted.

16:31.000 --> 16:43.000
In our previous conversations, it was something about front loading a new podcast or something like this. So as far as I understand, although, you know, slap me on the head.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
I didn't really do much background checking on this person. I just said, okay, whatever.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
Interview fine.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
And I don't have any, I don't have a good feeling about a four week delay because it dawned on me that if.

17:03.000 --> 17:16.000
Well, number one, the guy was very sympathetic to some of the no virus players. And so there were a couple times in the interview where I felt as though, wait a minute, you, you have a bias that I didn't understand that you had before.

17:16.000 --> 17:27.000
And I coped with it very well, but there was fairly well, but there were a couple of heated exchanges where I got a little upset, which is, you know, what is that par for the course for me here. I mean, give me a break.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
If you see a two and a half hour interview of me where I don't get upset about something that I guess it's probably not me. It's probably an AI and you should discount it.

17:36.000 --> 17:54.000
So anyway, at the end of the interview, I just felt like, wow, I really worked hard for that two and a half hours to try and get these explanations right and, you know, try and tweak what I just said because he asked to follow up question.

17:54.000 --> 18:10.000
And so I felt like it was a very effective discussion, where even sometimes when I got pushed and I got a little, you know, clause came out, it was for a reason. And when I did that, I was able to grab back on and say, no, this is why.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
And I haven't reviewed.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
What was said, and, and I haven't reviewed my notes.

18:21.000 --> 18:35.000
I sent him an email afterwards saying I'm not really happy with this embargo time. And I'm thinking about maybe making a transcript of what happened and putting it up as a sub stack and.

18:35.000 --> 18:49.000
And then the communications went south. So I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle it, but it may be that what I'll do is, well, you'll see later today I'll take care of it I do have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to do.

18:49.000 --> 18:58.000
But for now, suffice it to say that I just wanted to let everybody that actually pays attention regularly to my work.

18:58.000 --> 19:11.000
Know that there are some, there are some new combinations of words, and there are some new ways of talking about some of the main points that we make on this show out there right now.

19:11.000 --> 19:31.000
And in theory available on a recording that could be being distributed at this time. Why is that bad? Well, if, if the person that I did the interview with this weekend is a good guy and just meaning well, and, and this embargo time is really for him to build up the, you know, the collection or whatever so

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
when he starts is his new thing he has enough material to look like he's sustaining it.

19:38.000 --> 19:56.000
But it's 2024. And so for me, you know, recording is a recording how much editing do you have to do does it take a few hours maybe a day a Saturday I don't know but the idea of front loading a podcast so that you can release.

19:56.000 --> 20:05.000
So it seems like a pretty short sided idea from the perspective of somebody like me and I'm sure my friend Mark coolac would agree.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Mark coolac is about to produce is what 900 and 901 episode.

20:11.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm sure that if Mark had, you know, taken 100 episodes and recorded them before he started releasing them regularly on Monday, I don't think it would have made much of a difference in his current status on the Internet in the same way that had I recorded a few interviews

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
and then released them, you know, every Monday it's not going to make a huge difference in my penetration of the Internet.

20:33.000 --> 20:49.000
And so this excuse started to feel a little bit weak. And when I reread some of the email exchanges before the show I just realized that look I don't, I don't have any obligation to agree to this embargo so I just sent him an email and said I'm not comfortable with it.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
And the reaction was was pretty negative. So we'll see what we do.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
But I want everybody to know that.

20:57.000 --> 21:13.000
I'll reiterate this one more time that there are some new combinations of words out there and some very good explanations about this stuff that I have more or less come up with on the off the cuff and a discussion with somebody and I do think it's valuable enough information

21:13.000 --> 21:33.000
that holding it for four weeks so that some random dude can start a podcast in the way that he wants to or imagines will be most optimal for his venture. I don't think really it doesn't make sense to me if you're really trying to help, you know, save the world, which I don't want to sound like

21:33.000 --> 21:50.000
what else, what else do you call what we're trying to do where we and all of us here, they don't want you to think it's possible so they don't want to say it but what else are we doing here other than trying to save the world trying to get the collective of humanity to pull their heads out.

21:51.000 --> 22:03.000
So I'm a little frustrated but I've got good friends and good advisors. And so I'm probably not going to make any ridiculous mistakes but I do think it's possible.

22:03.000 --> 22:15.000
I do think it's possible that there were some ulterior motives there and so whatever it was we're going to try and mitigate that to make sure that that as little as possible can be used against us so to speak.

22:16.000 --> 22:28.000
I mean think think just very bare minimum, you know, some of the things that I talked about on the podcast couldn't theory be discussed with people and they could come up with what seemed like reasonable counter arguments so that they can throw these things

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
all over the Internet in the next four weeks.

22:31.000 --> 22:44.000
And then when that podcast comes out there already be all this shit out there, you know that that says all this and says all that or or has already started to use words like illusion of consensus on another podcast and claim it's theirs.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
And so those kinds of things are what I'm paranoid about it.

22:49.000 --> 23:03.000
I don't know I mean should I use 20 minutes for this who cares because this show is for you it's for me it's for all the people that take GIGO and biologically is biological as serious as I think it should be taken.

23:03.000 --> 23:14.000
So, you know, here's where we are I expected to be attacked again and I expected that as we've said before they run out of actors so there have to be new ones.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
And is it really surprising that it would be a Canadian I don't think it is.

23:18.000 --> 23:31.000
So apologies to that person if they're listening and it turns out that they're just good guys and I think that if they turn out to be just good guys then this is going to be no problem at all.

23:31.000 --> 23:39.000
But it's just to make sure that everybody realizes that if I start to say that up that stolen from me.

23:39.000 --> 23:54.000
And you haven't heard it before it might very well be because of this interview this weekend and then there are some things with regard to laws in Canada and America that make me a little bit cautious about how much other how many other details I share about the situation

23:54.000 --> 24:11.000
and that's where we are just fun times here at GIGO and biological where I'm a human just like you and I'm actually not very smart because I just have a wife and kids and I rent my house and a former academic biologist just trying to fight a much much much

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
larger system and and and many many piles of weaponized money.

24:17.000 --> 24:35.000
And so yeah I'm going to make mistakes and and and things aren't going to go perfectly even with my IT here because this is not this is a one man show reality TV if you will because what else do you want.

24:35.000 --> 24:47.000
We have a message and that message keeps getting ignored and the more that they ignore it the more that I'm going to repeat it intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

24:54.000 --> 25:04.000
The spread of bad ideas which are counter to the three statements that I just made are actually the best definition of what this pandemic was.

25:04.000 --> 25:15.000
It was an orchestrated spread of bad ideas which made everyone on the left and the right come to the conclusion that there was a lab lead.

25:24.000 --> 25:37.000
So in two days show I would like to watch a Twiv. It's from a couple days ago and I know some people don't like Twiv but actually Vincent Rack and yellow is not in this one he's sick or something.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
It would be a shame if the transfection got him wouldn't it.

25:42.000 --> 25:51.000
Anyway, I wanted to watch this because I want you to see how deeply entrenched academic biologists can be.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
Now I understand that this is a subset of academic biologists that are especially entrenched in virology because they have participated in this Twiv for so long.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
But what is important to understand.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
What is important to understand. Oh, I see what that is.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
Something is playing over here.

26:22.000 --> 26:44.000
What is important to understand is that these people represent how an academic biologist at a university of Pittsburgh School of Medicine could be also made to feel as as though it's okay to offload the responsibility of understanding on to these people.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
What Twiv represents is an illusion of consensus. There's four or three people on the screen.

26:51.000 --> 27:09.000
And they are actively engaging in an agreement about something that most the vast majority of their viewers have no real background with which to evaluate whether or not these people are in agreement about something dumb or an agreement about something that that is valid.

27:09.000 --> 27:34.000
And so it's important to see just like the laugh track on a comedy show makes it harder for you not to laugh because there is an illusion of consensus that gets created when that laugh track is playing in the background that spurs your consciousness to start laughing under the assumption that that illusion of consensus is real.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
And when people engage in watching Twiv or the view.

27:42.000 --> 28:00.000
Or any of these other programs where multiple people discuss something what you're watching is a active creation of an illusion of consensus about what questions are the right questions to ask and what are the right answers to consider.

28:00.000 --> 28:12.000
You don't want to use Twiv as a way of of batting down particular narratives as so much as also an example of how magical it is.

28:12.000 --> 28:26.000
If you take more than one person that has agreed or wittingly or unwittingly to perpetuate an untruth, a lie, a mythology, how easy it is for three people to do.

28:26.000 --> 28:34.000
And then, if I can toot my own horn and toot the horn of Mark Coolack.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
Although some people say that you know Mark needs to be a little more punchy.

28:42.000 --> 28:59.000
It becomes pretty amazing if people can produce content that is interesting and useful and educational all by themselves and convince you to reconsider ideas all by themselves because there's no illusion of consensus here.

28:59.000 --> 29:14.000
There's just some guy with a backwards baseball cap on and goofy hair and eyebrows that get pulled out of position by the hat.

29:14.000 --> 29:28.000
So what I'm suggesting to you is, is that we are all vulnerable to this and in fact it was the magic spell that was cast on us and that in fact, the illusion of consensus that's being created in the background.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
Has been created by a similar illusion of consensus.

29:34.000 --> 29:41.000
Where no matter what podcast you go on and no matter what face you listen to it seems like they all agree.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
And so the illusion of consensus extends across time and space.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
Temporally distributed across these different people.

29:52.000 --> 30:03.000
But because there is a script or more importantly, a series of ideas that they are not allowed to talk about, and then anything else is fine.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
That this illusion of consensus is so magnificent.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
You got to have an appreciation for it really.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
Anyway, let's let's see how this works. I think I have to go out of this.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I need to go over to the brains here I think that work.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Oh no, I can't do that here. I'm going to shift over.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Do that here.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And then I think I have it already up on this computer.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I do.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
So this is on my Mac, which means that sometimes there's going to be an ad and I'm going to have to wait five seconds to click it over.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.000
I apologize for that. I know that's again, you know, it's just the way it works when you stream from your garage.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
Let's do this.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
That's about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 1115 1115.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
He's actually got a pretty nice voice, but my goodness for an academic.

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
For an academic who's supposed to present and teach for a living.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I mean, wow.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
It just is, it's, it's really sad. I mean, my, my son could read it better than him.

31:30.000 --> 31:44.000
I'm going to keep this going at normal speed because they're funny. And, and again, the point is to start to step back a little bit and to try and understand the particular power of a three person illusion.

31:44.000 --> 31:56.000
That on May 17, 2024. I'm Alan Dove. You're listening to the podcast all about viruses and joining me today from Madison, New Jersey, Fran Barker.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
Hi, it's great to be here. It's a great big giant phage and rather cloudy here.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
Good day to be inside. She's getting gray. I feel bad for her.

32:08.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah, it's actually, she's not looking healthier. Trying to be nice weather here. It's 75 and pleasant, but mostly cloudy. So we'll see where that goes. And also joining us. Yeah, that phage is hilarious.

32:21.000 --> 32:32.000
And they call me. Oh, I need this. I need this mouse. Hello. So he doesn't have viruses behind him about what you described. He's got a page right there.

32:32.000 --> 32:41.000
The other thing is that it seems a little sticky. It doesn't seem like it's a good 70 degrees. It seems like it's a little bit.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
It's a wet heat. It's exactly right. Exactly right. Good day for broadcasting. Absolutely.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
And of course I am in Western Massachusetts. So I am the only non New Jersey participant today. That's right.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
A couple of announcements before we dig into the meat of the episode.

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
A couple of public service announcements. First of all, the Mitchellson prizes. Next generation grants are annual. I always find it.

33:07.000 --> 33:23.000
I always find it funny when they when they have have their diplomas in the background. It's not to say that I don't have a diploma, but I actually have my diploma up next to my wife's diploma because it's like we went to the same university and graduated together

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
and it's over there because it's to remind me that we do it together. It's not back there to remind you of me.

33:31.000 --> 33:49.000
And so I've never felt even if I had an office at a university right now, that would be up, not because it's a diploma, but because it's a cool document and it's got this big seal on it because it's an old Dutch graduation document.

33:49.000 --> 34:03.000
But I would never put it up to brag that I did a little research. Like, it's just funny. Once you do a PhD, you realize that anyone could do it. I mean, anyone can do it.

34:03.000 --> 34:16.000
If you wanted to do a PhD in plant biology right now and you could find a lab to take you, you could do it. It's not impossible. It's just a set amount of work and a set amount of time and you just start it and you finish it.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
It's no different than a lot of other things that we do as adults.

34:20.000 --> 34:29.000
And so to raise yourself up as a PhD without actively exhibiting the expertise that you claim to have, it's actually quite sad.

34:29.000 --> 34:38.000
And that is the kind of expert that we're dealing with on the internet with regard to viruses and infectious disease.

34:38.000 --> 34:56.000
We're dealing with armchair quarterbacks and we're dealing with armchair quarterbacks that unless they stave to a very strict set of ideas and broad topics, they can't actually talk to you about where the irreducible complexity starts and where the sacred biology is visible.

34:57.000 --> 35:18.000
And I feel as though people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nasse and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McCurnan and Charles Rixie and all these other people, Christine Grace, that have masqueraded as as experts or or whistle blowers or people that are going to come out and tell us about what biology these people are lying about

35:18.000 --> 35:30.000
or that these people have misled us on, they have not usefully broadened our understanding of the trap we're in.

35:30.000 --> 35:46.000
Instead, they have basically perpetuated a series of narratives that are going to lead to further confusion, further fear and uncertainty in doubt with regard to the future.

35:47.000 --> 36:09.000
And that is the extraordinary effect that all of these people from them, all the way to the darkest corners of the internet where people were also planted is that this illusion of consensus that's created by five people agreeing that isolation and purification.

36:09.000 --> 36:26.000
And that's not what they need to be argued about and redefined and everybody needs to submit to admitting that they don't isolate and they don't purify viruses and when they say culture virus that's not what they mean, they don't culture virus.

36:26.000 --> 36:45.000
The illusion of consensus actually trapped people in a place where they never made one more step and can and said that Oh, they are not actually culturing virus they're just transfecting cell cultures,

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
and the messages that I said on the podcast on Sunday yesterday.

36:50.000 --> 37:09.000
It's a very simple message RNA virology is sustained by the misconception that using a DNA cloned molecule in quantity or an RNA cloned molecule in quantity to transform or transfect a cell culture.

37:09.000 --> 37:17.000
Whatever cellular material results from that transformation and transfection is viral culture.

37:17.000 --> 37:37.000
And we have never succeeded in demanding that virology admit that that the use of a cloned molecule quantity, transfection transformation of cell culture is not virology it's not evidence of viruses in nature.

37:37.000 --> 37:45.000
And amazingly, the illusion of consensus that was created in this no virus camp.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
None of them were able to get there.

37:47.000 --> 38:03.000
And they were just, they were actually just one logical step from saying, Oh my gosh, they're just transforming and transfecting cell cultures and calling that viral production.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
And they were never able to say it.

38:07.000 --> 38:20.000
And I suspect they're never going to say it until they decide to, or they are told to, or they're queued up to, or we make it impossible for them not to try and absorb it as their idea all along.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
Just like the idea that gain of function as a mythology is something that they only started saying after we said it.

38:28.000 --> 38:36.000
Gain of function is a mythology they actually stole that from us and started saying it in 2023.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
And pretending that it was their idea.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Now, is there a separate part of this?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Of course, because inside of this debate here.

38:46.000 --> 39:00.000
There are going to be all kinds of bad questions that academic biologists think are good questions and they're, they're collusion of consensus about what good questions are and what, what the right answers are will make any academic

39:00.000 --> 39:10.000
biologist grad student or interested harm chair biologists think wow these people are really digging down into the weeds and I can follow them and it's I just feel great.

39:10.000 --> 39:25.000
And so let's listen because it is actually pretty amazing what they talk about in the beginning of this because although it is obviously not the side of the narrative that we are on, it is extremely useful to hear them talk about some of the things that they talk about so I'm just

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
Oh, it must be a dinner and this is something. This is something about this is something about the coming.

39:33.000 --> 39:49.000
It's too bad. So I'm going to pause this. There is a American society of virology meeting in Columbus, Ohio at the end of June. And so technically speaking, I could still register for it, but it would cost almost a thousand dollars to go.

39:49.000 --> 39:59.000
Now if there was somebody out there with a crap ton of cash that thinks that that's a great idea. It's at the end of June. So I'll be here.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
It's after the red pill event and it's not that far of a drive.

40:05.000 --> 40:14.000
I would consider going because there's going to be a twiv episode there and it's Columbus, Ohio is really close. I didn't understand that it was so close and I blew it.

40:15.000 --> 40:27.000
Had I known this a couple months earlier, I probably would be going because there's all kinds of potential gains to be made if I could go to that meeting. So they're talking about this meeting that's coming up next month.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
And so I'll just play, but I'm going to click forward until he stops talking about it.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
We'll deliver confident engaging presentations. That's by L. N. A.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Many others.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
Either of the past two years, if you went to a black.

40:45.000 --> 40:57.000
Bring it with the papers, which is that if you like what we are doing, please can consider supporting the science shows of micro TV at micro.tv slash contribute.

40:57.000 --> 41:04.000
So they are they are they are raising money at the end for those who they are raising money. Why would they raise money?

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
They are all 10 year track professors. Why would they be raising money?

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Who are they raising money for?

41:14.000 --> 41:22.000
Are you telling me they can't do a podcast? They need to get compensated for it.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
Think about this very, very carefully here because it's extraordinary that they would ask any money.

41:30.000 --> 41:46.000
Do I ask money, but I don't ask money like that. I'm asking money seriously like, you know, this is not to I don't know make a studio in Manhattan look better or to buy a couch for the studio in Manhattan or to buy a new camera for for Vincent.

41:46.000 --> 41:58.000
It's not we are the people that support this stream are actually putting baloney in the sandwiches. That's what I'm talking about. So thank you very much to everybody that's doing that.

41:58.000 --> 42:10.000
It's very humbling that so many people are willing to support this work. So let's again, let's keep it on topic around because if you listen to a whole episode, then you're really ought to be on board with us.

42:11.000 --> 42:27.000
All right. We have a snippet and a paper. We'll start off with a snippet, which I apologize to those of you who are trying to read these papers. They are both pay walled, but they are good papers. So I can't do that anyway.

42:27.000 --> 42:38.000
I gotta fix that. Sorry about that. The snippet is a paper from the Lancet called immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of a self amplifying RNA COVID-19 vaccine.

42:38.000 --> 42:53.000
All the ark 154 versus BNT 16 to B2. That's comernity. The mRNA vaccine COVID-19 vaccine double line multi center randomized controlled phase three non inferiority trial.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
All right, so to parse that.

42:57.000 --> 43:07.000
There's a company that there are a number of people, a number of companies that have worked on developing self replicating mRNA vaccines over the past many years.

43:07.000 --> 43:19.000
And in fact, I believe Pfizer was working on one for COVID-19, but they ended up going with the mRNA vaccine. Correct that they they felt was the stronger initial candidate.

43:20.000 --> 43:29.000
Yes, there were a few self amplifying mRNA vaccines that were under development. The one that is described here.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
The first author of this paper, by the way, I don't know if we mentioned it was Yoda or Yoda. So almost Yoda.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
I was just going to get to authors in a moment.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
The senior author is waltzing.

43:43.000 --> 43:53.000
And this group has been previously working on this RNA vaccine ark 154 in Japan.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
And it has actually been approved in Japan and was previously trialed in a trial in Vietnam.

44:01.000 --> 44:14.000
Can you, before you started on the meat of this paper, just described for the people who don't know, including myself, what a self amplifying vaccine was just was just going to get to that.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Oh, good.

44:15.000 --> 44:26.000
By the way, these folks on this paper are from Meiji Seika, pharma, Kitasado University in Tokyo, Arcterus Therapeutics in San Diego and Walsen Consulting in Seattle.

44:26.000 --> 44:38.000
Right. So this is, it's an mRNA vaccine like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but with those, what happens is you get injected with the vaccine.

44:38.000 --> 44:49.000
And the mRNA dose that goes in is only encoding the antigen, the spike, like a protein that's going to, you know, give the immune response.

44:49.000 --> 45:03.000
In this case, what you're getting with a self replicating vaccine is the antigen, plus the molecular machinery machinery to replicate this RNA. There's an RNA directed RNA polymerase.

45:03.000 --> 45:10.000
Right. So basically, it's just a longer piece of RNA that encodes both the spike and the polymerase.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
It's a nice reaction by the old guy, right? Oh, wow.

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
So he's actually, I've often had the feeling that I think that's Dixon.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
I've had the feeling that Dixon is a little bit more like, come on.

45:25.000 --> 45:37.000
Sometimes he's like, he's almost falling out of it, you know, like, but he's probably just done so many experiments and understands that people exaggerate and whatever.

45:37.000 --> 45:44.000
And so, you know, he's too old to care, but every once in a while, you can hear this guy kind of like, huh?

45:44.000 --> 46:00.000
So RNA dependent RNA polymerase, presumably according to, according to David Baltimore, a viral enzyme is now going to be encoded in an RNA along with the antigen of choice.

46:00.000 --> 46:13.000
And this is all fine because, you know, the most important enzyme in viral infection can be used as a medical therapeutic with very little problem.

46:13.000 --> 46:30.000
It's very easy for us to use a viral enzyme to create more viral RNA that encodes for more viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase and more viral protein.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
It's very easy for us to do that because viruses and their enzymes are very useful.

46:39.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm sorry for that voice. I just, I'm, I'm at wit's end here because it is just absolutely.

46:49.000 --> 47:08.000
It's mind blowing to me that these people can't see the contradiction, the incongruity, the, the, the, just things that don't line up in this model.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Biology.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
They're just happy to say RNA vaccine over and over and over again.

47:17.000 --> 47:28.000
And they're happy to just read the brochure and say, yeah, they have an RNA dependent RNA polymerase along with the antigen and that's, that's better because it needs less.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
They don't need as much then.

47:34.000 --> 47:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we're in big trouble because the, the academic biology big picture is unavailable anymore.

47:48.000 --> 47:58.000
The, the broad understanding of the irreducible complexity that we are trying to scratch the surface of is unavailable.

47:58.000 --> 48:10.000
And if we don't rush to the aid of those young people that are being actively engaged by these.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
These bad ideas.

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
We're, we're going to be enslaved for generations to come.

48:20.000 --> 48:30.000
And these people may very well be on winning participants. In fact, most of the people in academia are probably on winning participants. I was there.

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
The trap is extremely intricate inside of a university.

48:36.000 --> 48:53.000
Intricate in a way that involves seminars and asking the right questions with the right words at seminars and sending the right emails and showing up at the right meetings and, and, and teaching the right course for the right person and.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
And, and I don't know sharing a methodology with the right grad student.

49:00.000 --> 49:20.000
It's all one big cluster F of hierarchy that is created on purpose to make all of these otherwise very intelligent focused hardworking people have enough hamster wheels to run on so that they never actually usefully get anywhere.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
And that's what also depresses me about it because I was inside of academia I know how beautiful these people are.

49:27.000 --> 49:35.000
And I know how close they are to understanding how.

49:35.000 --> 49:44.000
How insignificant their question really is. And in that insignificance is where the beauty of biology lies and yet.

49:45.000 --> 50:04.000
And yet for some reason or another these people are not quite able to make that step that's it that's how beautiful the cages it's they are right next to this invisible barrier force field like on doom that you can't pass through without moving very slowly and deliberately out.

50:04.000 --> 50:11.000
Otherwise it's completely a solid wall you can't even tell it you can't do anything about it.

50:11.000 --> 50:23.000
People are wholly inside of it because when they get off of this podcast and they, they go back to their room, the confirmation is all around them.

50:23.000 --> 50:34.000
The illusion of consensus that they built up in their home and in their office and amongst their faculty is impenetrable.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
Even through pain and suffering they may not escape.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
And it owes only for the grace of God that I escaped because they fired me.

50:45.000 --> 50:54.000
And I've said this before and I'll say it again if they would have just let me work on that German microscope and that German equipment that I just got for free.

50:54.000 --> 51:06.000
That I just got myself for free and said oh my gosh Jay you got to get that thing working we're going to give you a bigger room and a grad student.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
There would be no giggle biological.

51:11.000 --> 51:27.000
And I'm sure that I would be gladly teaching young graduate students how to do the experiments that I've been doing for the last 20 years and tune the optics of a microscope and and how to get their pipettes the right shape and and all the other tricks and and

51:27.000 --> 51:36.000
that I had to make my experiments as replicable as possible as reliably doable as possible that was my thing.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.000
I wanted nothing more than to just bike ride to that university and keep working there.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
What a mistake they made.

51:46.000 --> 51:54.000
Now I hope that I can be a sort of lifeguard outside of the pool that anybody that actually asked for help I can definitely help them escape.

51:54.000 --> 52:08.000
And it is an active thing you've got to slowly move directly out of academia you can't try to, you know, leave gracefully or or or use it to your advantage that you were there.

52:08.000 --> 52:18.000
But it's a full blown direct active excavation that's required or extraction that's required.

52:18.000 --> 52:27.000
A lot like removing somebody from the matrix in that movie there's there's there's there's there's tubes that need to be yanked out of your head.

52:27.000 --> 52:38.000
There's people because they don't the tubes don't itch anymore and the temperature of their bath is perfectly warm after many years of fine tuning.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
These people are never going to wake up.

52:42.000 --> 52:53.000
And so we need our children to be able to see we need our friend fellow adults our neighbors to be able to see that this magic that's created by three people.

52:53.000 --> 53:07.000
This magic that gets created by multiple people on the PBS NewsHour talking about stuff. This magic needs to be dispelled. We need to go back to a single person talking to us.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
Not having a conversation with somebody else.

53:10.000 --> 53:22.000
But we need to go back to single people talking to us about single ideas one at a time and explaining them so that then we can subsequently evaluate them.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
And the, the spontaneous sometimes.

53:27.000 --> 53:39.000
And otherwise very carefully orchestrated limited spectrums of debate that we are exposed to all to all the time on social media that is the bait.

53:39.000 --> 53:58.000
So these people are trying to convince the old guy that you know, using a viral protein in combination with a viral protein using a viral enzyme RNA in combination with a viral protein RNA is something that we can use to augment the immune system

53:58.000 --> 54:10.000
because we understand how all this stuff works. And he's just a little skeptical but because the tubes have been in his head for 40 years, he's not skeptical enough.

54:10.000 --> 54:17.000
It's not safe for him to be skeptical that just find somebody else to be on this podcast and retire him early. Are you kidding me?

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
Not that he knows that or anything but that's what would happen.

54:23.000 --> 54:30.000
Okay, let's listen to them talk about self replicating RNA and let's listen to them talk about storage because that's also really funny.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
How long does that actually go on.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
There he goes. How long does it keep expressed.

54:36.000 --> 54:45.000
It's a longer piece of RNA that encodes both the spike and the polymerase. How long does that actually go on.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
That I didn't see in this paper.

54:51.000 --> 55:08.000
They don't specifically address how much how long it is expressed, but they talk about the idea that it is hypothesized to express for a longer period of time than the traditional mRNA vaccine.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
But they do not give a they don't in this study sort of go into the details of how long it's expressed.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
And it's still an intramuscular injection.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
It's still intramuscular injection. It's still in a lipid carrier.

55:23.000 --> 55:37.000
All of that's the same. The other thing that becomes really useful about one of the self amplifying vaccines is that you can use a lower dose in the patient because the dose that you put in will amplify.

55:38.000 --> 55:53.000
Absolutely. And since we have seen with some of the mRNA vaccines, some side effects or administration, perhaps by delivering a smaller dose of nucleic acid, we wouldn't have the same types of side effects.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
Yeah, we have any active self replicating vaccines on the market.

55:59.000 --> 56:07.000
Well, other than attenuated vaccines that have been around for decades. I mean, that's an infection.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
Yeah, those are actual infectious virus. Yeah.

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
There is not another vaccine like this one that is a completely self contained.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
It's not actually a virus. It's just the bare minimum equipment you need to replicate the mRNA and produce the antigen.

56:25.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah. And so this group has been working on this. And so this vaccine that they are studying here is probably the furthest along in previous trials in Japan and Vietnam before the child that we're going to talk about here.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Right.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
Right. So as Brian mentioned, this is a vaccine that has now been approved. I think it was approved in January in Japan.

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
And the companies, well, Arcturus Therapeutics is the company that I that developed this.

56:57.000 --> 57:10.000
Arcturus. Do I know that? Do we know that? Mark, are you watching? Do we know that name? Arcturus? I think we do. I don't know it off the top of my head, but I think we do. Anyone know that name.

57:10.000 --> 57:28.000
And then they are, I think, going for European approval next and presumably looking for a wide approvals. The other advantage of this vaccine, I gather it can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, lyophilized.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
Is that a red that somewhere? That was also what I what I read.

57:32.000 --> 57:44.000
And I certainly saw in some of the reviews that it was not something that needed to be stored at all at minus 80. Right. It was not nearly as sensitive as the original mRNA vaccines.

57:44.000 --> 57:56.000
Yeah, so the Pfizer vaccine that was a major stumbling block is you can't just you can't even just put it in a regular freezer. You have to put it in basically liquid nitrogen in order to transport it or for a lab grade minus.

57:56.000 --> 58:17.000
So that's a very strange incongruity here because the Pfizer vaccine was a lipid nanoparticle and an RNA. This is a lipid. They just said it like 30 seconds ago that it's the same lipid nanoparticle in this self replicating RNA.

58:17.000 --> 58:28.000
So, one of the things to understand about this stuff. And I'm just going to draw a picture that's not really relevant but a picture to just try to help you understand what I'm getting at.

58:28.000 --> 58:45.000
I hope this works is that when they package these RNA what they actually do is they have some kind of microfluidics device, which, you know, brings them together in some weird fashion.

58:45.000 --> 58:55.000
But the lipid nanoparticles come through here and maybe there's a funnel or something, you know, that they go in and they are made into a certain size.

58:55.000 --> 59:12.000
And then the RNA comes through here and they mix in such a way that they swirl around in some microfluidics pattern. And then the average lipid nanoparticle size that comes out over here is directly dependent on these various patented processes

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
for introducing the RNA to the lipid nanoparticle complement.

59:17.000 --> 59:35.000
Now, I know that this is an absolutely ridiculously terrible drawing but my point is to understand that the RNA and the lipid nanoparticles are brought together in such a way via microfluidics where the average lipid nanoparticle size is below toxic levels.

59:35.000 --> 59:50.000
Remember that one of the things that we have learned from some of these lipid nanoparticle people when they're not saying nonsense is that the lipid nanoparticles need to be a certain size in order to not be by chemical definition toxic, the larger they get

59:50.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and the more sort of congeulated they become the more toxic the lipid nanoparticle is the lipid portion of the particle is that's the problem that again, some of these people are covering up other people are trying to say that the lipid itself is doing

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:20.000
more damage than the transfection would be. And so all of these things I think are hamster wheels that we've been sort of tricked into running in it's not one or the other it's all of these bad ideas combined into one.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And so the important thing to understand is that there might be many patents here.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:38.000
There are many, many patents here. There are patents on the shape of the microfluidics and the design of the chambers and the machines and the pressures and the whole thing.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:54.000
There's probably many, many more patents that can be potentially made with regard to the processes of bringing together the RNA or the DNA with lipid nanoparticles that could ever be made with monoclonal antibodies for example.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:10.000
In fact monoclonal antibodies are something that the Supreme Court in the United States right at the beginning of the pandemic decided we're not really that patentable anymore because the biology underlying the patents was actually pretty bunk.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And so that's a funny story that that actually has ramifications all the way up until now in this particular story because I want you to see that that if there is a viable reason why lipid nanoparticles that were produced in 2020 needed to be stored at minus 80 degrees

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000
but lipid nanoparticles that are produced in 2024 can be lyophilized and can be stored at room temperature. That's a pretty bold statement.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Lyophilization is the drying and I think it is just just the removal of water but to be honest I would have to look up the word.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I do believe it means that but I'm just going to do it right now.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Lyophilization lyophilized is to resolve precipitate with dissolve and benzene and lyophilize to give a powder.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So you're freeze drying and it says.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Lyophilization is freeze drying a process which water is removed from a product after it's frozen and placed under a vacuum.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So I'm a little confused as to how you could lyophilize something that in 2020 definitely required to be in suspension at minus 80 as opposed to.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And maybe maybe the minus 80 thing was a story that we were supposed to argue about.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Maybe the minus 80 thing was supposed to be a story that was going to be augmenting the idea that there are different doses.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Oh my goodness, some of the doses are very dangerous.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Other of the doses aren't hurting anyone.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Maybe it has to do with their storage.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And now conveniently the chemistry and physical limitations of lipid nanoparticles have been nicely overcome.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And now we don't have to worry about that anymore.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's a wonderful assumption that I don't think any of these people have the biochemistry background to wax intellectual about whether it's real.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But they seem to be pretty convinced that it's real because they're willing to report it as an illusion of consensus on a podcast that they want to reach around the world with.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Right, freezer.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Right, so this has obviously already, as we said, it's already been approved. So obviously it's already been through phase three clinical trials. So why the heck are they doing the phase three clinical trial and publishing it now.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:55.000
This is the it's a follow up study where this is not just about finding out if it leads to antibody production that was the trial in Vietnam.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They proved that it works and it prevents, you know, severe COVID-19 here.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's an actual head to head trial against the Pfizer vaccine to see if it's they don't want to say if it's better.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Let's say if it's not worse. That's a non inferiority trial.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The other thing that's really important about this.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That's nice and non inferiority trial is the is the CDC FDA equivalent of a a test experimental test of a vaccine.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:40.000
So basically they give the previous poison as a control and the new poison as the experimental group. And if there's a difference, they're looking at that difference. They're not looking at any other difference.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This, of course, from Paul office perspective is the ethical way to do it because vaccines are so great. You can't not give somebody a vaccine. So the only thing you can do is compare previous results with the new one.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And of course these people because they have all the hoses still stuck in their head.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:11.000
They have no reason to question it. And in fact, their comfort and their fame and their, their higher, their rank on this hierarchical ladder that they are trapped on inside of their university.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Precludes them realizing that they are full of shit.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You can imagine that as we get further and further from 2020.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
We can think about making improved vaccines and that's awesome.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But it's harder and harder to test them because people already have some immunity.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And so here they're not just testing is this vaccine.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Non inferior.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
They're checking to see whether it's non inferior as a booster.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So that's spectacular, right? Because now they are really talking about nothing because they are working on so many assumptions here.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:04.000
They have previous immunity and she wasn't even clear. What do you mean from previous vaccines? I guess so because they're talking about it in the context of a booster.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And so, you know, the rabbit hole that we are in could be deeper than any of us realize and the whole idea of building immunity to a particular target may already be a giant mythology.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Remember that there's a whole half of of immunology in the early 2000s that was focused on immune memory as damage associated molecular patterns so molecular patterns that were dangerous.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
They were dependent of what particular pathogen they were associated with.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And then there was a whole other field or half of immunology that said pathogen associated molecular patterns so the idea was very different.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
One idea was is that the immune system focused on molecular patterns.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Sounds kind of like Buckminster Fuller molecular patterns that were consistently associated with damage or toxicity.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:15.000
As opposed to pathogen associated molecular patterns, which is actually the immunology that we are being foisted upon here, which is that every pathogen needs to be a separate immune memory set in the immune system.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And that an immune system can be naive to a new pathogen because every pathogen has a unique set of immune signals that our immune system has to learn.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And I think this is a fundamental misconception that is only sustained because of a ridiculous illusion of consensus that is funded by billions of dollars by the NIH.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:49.000
They just stopped funding people who were trying to understand the immune system as a generalizer across damage associated molecular patterns.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They just ended that whole funding stream and all investigations that had that theme.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And instead funded to the tune of billions of dollars every in any lab that was working on pathogen specific associated molecular patterns and the model of the immune system that that descends from that idea.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And then using p values never to actually test the consequences of that model.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Instead using p values to make sure that every experiment that ever gets reported only confirms it's got to be pathogen associated look it's got to be a new memory that that's just the way it just makes sense.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:46.000
This is a very big idea that again is one of those ideas that when it comes out and people try to absorb it it's going to be very clearly coming from us nobody else besides us has said this.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And hat tip to Mark Coolack because Mark Coolack was one of the was the person that sort of pointed this out that back in the day.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
There was this damage associated molecular pattern idea and as soon as I read it I was like oh my gosh Mark you don't even know how important this is.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
This is gigantic.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Because it is a major paradigm shift of immune.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The model of the immune systems function if you think about generalizing across damage associated molecular patterns or generalizing.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Maybe across unique pathogens it's not really clear how their model works other than a unique memory is always needed and tweaked and built and modified.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And why what process with the immune system to decide what part of that 30,000 base pair genome or the proteins that can be produced from it should be the focus of the immune memory.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:10:01.000
These people have no concept of that never elwax intellectual about how that process might be vital to understand but instead just move on with the correlates of immunity that were given to them by their funders and by their mentors before them.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So that their place on the ladder is safe.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Basically if you want to question these things you got to take your hands off the ladder and then you're surely going to fall off of it just like I did.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:32.000
It's a beautiful thing once you see it that these people can't even come to the very simple analysis that I've just done that what chemically or biochemically was altered in the lipid nanoparticle RNA combination produced in the same way in 2020.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And now that that allows life elization.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:49.000
They don't seem to notice they don't seem to care why didn't they lifelize the Pfizer vaccine so that we didn't have to worry about the minus 80 refrigerators at the CBS.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Somebody connected to a minus 80 refrigeration company I mean what the hell.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
How obvious is this.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Those of us who have already gotten previous doses of a traditional mRNA vaccine particularly the Pfizer vaccine, which they're mostly studying here.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Will this work as they they do it as a fourth dose in their patients and is it better or worse than getting another Pfizer vaccine as your fourth dose. Yes.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
So that is pretty much the trial.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They they enrolled from December of 2022 to February of 2023.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Yeah, traditional right participants.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Unbelievable.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Their demographics is to become traditional on this group and randomized.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's totally normalized if she's going to call it traditional.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Oh my gosh.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
People double blind all the proper controls in here.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.000
To receive a fourth booster dose with either the Pfizer vaccine or the the arc 154.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I would still argue vehemently for the idea that placebo doses are placebo batches are still being released.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It's the easiest explanation.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Think how cheap it is.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And think how sure foolproof it is.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's foolproof.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
If you want to convince somebody that this is safe.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That's the foolproof way to do it. Just roll out lots and lots of placebo.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And if you really want to be clever about it, just make sure you know where you're on it on where you aren't.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It's that simple.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And that's I think what that dose story was all about, you know, and all that.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That fretting over which doses which dose and who's storing it where and all this other crap that was all just hamster wheels.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
We were supposed to run around in for a little while.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Nothing more.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And yeah, so they.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Basically found it's actually pretty straightforward paper.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You know, they're.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
They're about equally well tolerated. There weren't any.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Particularly bad. They already knew from earlier trials, this was a safe vaccine, but this is a larger group and obviously you track safety.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
There was one thing that I they don't really talk much about, but they mentioned it. There was a severe adverse event.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
With abnormal hepatic function in the arc 154 group.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
They concluded that it was related to the study vaccine, but they don't detail.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
What was abnormal about the hepatic function?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Or how they knew that that was related to the study back.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
How would you know it was related to the study vaccine?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Because that's where lipid nanoparticles go and every other study that we've ever done.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You see, again, if you don't read the papers, you don't know.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And this is a lot of the frustration that I have now a lot of times when I have an interview with somebody.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And they, they kind of want to go through the corner.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It's not like that.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You can't go through the force field.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Just real quick, you know, just show me the way it's real easy. No, everyone is going to have to do some work.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000
It's not going to be as simple as me sending you a couple links or choosing the right words and finally repeating them.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
That's not going to happen.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
In order for you to appreciate the Grand Canyon, you have to see it with your own eyes.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I've never seen the Grand Canyon with my own eyes and neither of my children or my wife.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So we can't appreciate the Grand. I have no idea.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And I'm happy to admit it.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I have been to the wind rivers in in Wyoming several times and I can tell you that.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
That is one of the most beautiful places on earth and you cannot appreciate it unless you've actually been there.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
30 miles from any other person surrounded by.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The wilderness that our forefathers.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Gave to us.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I can tell you, though, that that we have a chance.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:29.000
There is a chance to save our children from this because it is simply them learning the biology and them seeing this as the real mystery that needs to be solved.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The real mystery that needs to be solved is who are we?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Where is this boundary of of irreducible complexity and how can we more accurately look at it and see it and appreciate it for what it is.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I do think it's possible. I just don't think that these are the people that that are going to do it. I don't these people will be the last to get on board the arc.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Academic biologists will probably be the last people to get on the arc.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
They also might be this some of them might be the most easily saved because they're so close.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:21.000
They're so close to being able to see how awful it is because they're all the way at the top of the building and they, you know, like on Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
They're standing on the railing and they got their head like this right against the window and they're looking down.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:36.000
They can see all the little tiny cars down there and they know for sure that they have no business that high. They have no business being that high.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
So, so certain of the things that got them there.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But when they turn around, it's a really fancy restaurant and all the people are happy they're there.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And so you go back to the dinner. You go back to the faculty meeting where you rank and your opinion matters.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Why would you ever question where you are now and the things and the ideas that got you there?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It's a long road ahead, ladies and gentlemen. It's definitely a long road ahead. This was just a little example.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:27.000
You can watch more of that if you want to. I don't want to watch any of that. I instead would like to give you a very quick summary of where we are and then I'm going to let you go.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Because that's what we do here. We're going to do a little brief summary and then I will let you go using a lot of the old slides that I've used before.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Dr. James Giordano is probably the best place for us to start. We've been starting there for about three years now.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:56.000
People on TV and in social media, many of them were placed there on purpose as part of the operation that James Giordano gives you a very public facing brochure version of.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:05.000
The real version of the fifth generation warfare that's being waged on us involves liars on the Internet.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:22.000
In fact, the same kind of thing that TWIV represents has been done to us on the Tommy podcast and the Shannon Joy podcast and the Defender podcast and all of these podcasts where an illusion of consensus is created by one or more liars.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:32.000
One or more winning or unwitting participants that engage in the flexing of a limited spectrum of debate.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And that limited spectrum of debate right now is limited to talking about how bad the COVID shots are and not talking about the murder and lies that underlie the signal that was used to create the fear, uncertainty and doubt that led to the shots being rolled out

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:00.000
in the first place. In other words, opposing the shots as the shots are bad is not actually exposing the crime.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:18.000
The crime is that they murdered people and also lied about people dying, why they died and also when they died probably in order to create the illusion of an impending all caused mortality crisis.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And without careful scrutiny of the data and the claims and the things that were said and not said in 2020 and 2021, we will not be able to extricate ourselves from this mythology.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And the people that are on the t-shirt side of this slide are actively wittingly or unwittingly coerced. I don't care engaged in this charade where they are hyper focused on the damage of the shots and hyper focused on a gain a function lab leak that's still spreading around the world.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And absolutely positively not interested in reexamining what they said themselves, what they did themselves or what they were up to in 2020 and 2021.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Because careful examination of their behavior and their activities during those two years will reveal that they were in fact part of a team that was designed to make sure that the worst case scenario of a gain a function lab leak spreading around the world for multiple years that might become an endemic problem.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Needed those people in order to take flight needed those people in order to go viral and also needed the active artificial censorship and promotion of these same people.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And that was orchestrated through networks of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and other people that sit at the helm of weaponized piles of money.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And it's still an ongoing operation that is designed to co-opt anybody and everybody that can be co-opted into sticking to that t-shirt and running out the clock on our grandchildren for the people that want to enslave them.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And I have detailed very carefully how this limited spectrum of debate even was curated by the no virus people because we have been consciously and intelligently manipulated by these people for decades.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
This is a quote from 1922, Edward Bernays.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Make no mistake about it. If they unleashed a sort of global information dominance kind of operation on us, which the NSA definitely engages in apparently, the White House makes announcements about global information dominance exercises that have been going on for years.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:13.000
If that was done on social media, if that was done with these videos and with these fake heroes on fake white horses, then they have actively engaged in making it impossible for us to engage in informed consent.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That's a crime.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
That's a crime of the highest order. That's treason in my mind. That's being a traitor to your fellow American.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And there are people in every country that were involved in this, but most importantly, there were Americans, ladies and gentlemen, that were involved in it in every one of those countries.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
There were Americans. I got to let the dog out.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
There were Americans that toured the world.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:54.000
They toured the world for multiple years at multiple conferences in multiple countries and they were all Americans.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Americans and Canadians and NATO people.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Jessica Rose, Robert Malone, Pierre Corey, Meryl Nasse, Sasha Latipova, they have all toured together and been on stage together, spreading the ideas that are meant to enslave us, spreading the fear, uncertainty and doubt that are meant to enslave our children.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
It was their job.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And it remains their job now.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
That's why this week.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:36.000
The story that Robert Malone told to to Neely and control in 2021.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Was repeated by Meryl Nasse at the Kim Aversen show.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And a couple days later was repeated again by Mary Holland on Shannon Joy.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:57.000
A novel virus excess deaths and not willing to commit to the idea that maybe they just murdered people and lied about it.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Despite being at the cutting edge of of of objecting to public health at the cutting edge of establishing a health freedom movement in America, Mary Holland and Meryl Nasse.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
This is their sound effect.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:31.000
This is the sound effect that they deserve because they've achieved nothing but perpetuating the very mythology that was originally seeded by none other than Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone and Steve Kersch.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Along with this fake group drastic, which was almost exclusively foreign medlers.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
You know, the foreign medler group called drastic on Twitter that supposedly solved the origin problem.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:59.000
The one that Charles Ricksey preeminent patriot bald eagle decided to give the diffuse proposal to rather than an American authority or the FBI or, or I don't know, the Department of Justice.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.000
He decided to go to drastic, a group of anonymous international medlers.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That threw me out of their group a few months earlier because I wanted to talk about transmission and didn't think the origin of a virus was as important as waking people up to the idea that transmission ain't vaccination, no matter how many times they call it that.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And so, I'm not a part of CHD because CHD has been a controlled operation sabotaging the energy and time of all of these courageous moms and dads that work for them.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:58.000
They represent one great big giant hamster wheel where none of these people will actually make meaningful progress on most of the issues that are crucial to our grandchildren because of people like Merrill Nasse and Mary Holland.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
They play for them, not for us.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I think I made that very clear last week in the videos that I did and the week before that.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I've made very clear that Robert Malone, Merrill Nasse and Mary Holland all agree that there are bad cave viruses that can cause pandemics.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.000
They all agree that Ralph Barrack and other people are probably passaging viruses and causing even more pandemics.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000
They all agree that passaging in animals is even more dangerous and, oh my gosh, they can stitch this stuff together too.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I heard from Kevin McCurnan that there's SB 40 in the shots.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And this illusion of a worst case scenario is not being dispelled despite my best efforts for the last year inside and outside of that organization and the book writing team.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
It's not happening.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:27:02.000
The closest I got to it, ladies and gentlemen, the closest anyone has gotten to it is right here in the book that nobody wants to talk about.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Let's just go back and we're going to go right into the to the book.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
We're going to go into the index.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
We're going to go right to the C's.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000
We're going to look right over here and there's Jonathan Cooley and we're going to go right to page 441.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But it's not just engineered superbugs that should concern us with such an inventory of genetic sequences of every virus in the world malevolent actors with billions of dollars at stake would attribute even the most harmless seal and colds to a deadly

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
human being.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Pumped up in the media with pandemic porn and then vaccine deployed to terrify the masses as Jonathan Cooley said no actual virus would even be necessary.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So it's almost there.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Again, this is not me writing a book so I can't keep changing the words but I got it pretty damn close.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Because what's impressive about this this paragraph to me is that whether they like it or not it says it right here they have an inventory of the genomic sequences of.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.240
they have an inventory of the genomic sequences of not viruses of all the background signal.

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.840
And if they've been characterizing the background signal for the last decade, then it would

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.600
be very easy for them to take that background signal and mischaracterize it as the spread

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.560
of a deadly novel passage.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:34.240
There would be no actual virus even necessary.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.440
Tell me one other person on the internet or on the anti-vax movement that's gotten

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.320
that close to this truth being out there.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:49.080
Tell me one person who's even come close to dunking that hard.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.160
And that's why Greg James supported me for the last three years.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.840
That's why Stephen Cole, these people support me.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.600
That's why Rodney Mullen supported me for three years.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:03.160
That's why I get the attention of the Broken Science Initiative.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.000
Because there ain't nobody else who's come that close.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.560
No one.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:15.440
That's one zoom meeting away from this being broken.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.600
Don't you think for one second that any attribution of bad motives to me is anything but trying

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.800
to suppress this truth?

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:31.720
The truth that these people have been sustaining for many, many decades that even Ralph Barrick

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.600
is on the scene to sustain.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.080
Right now we're in a situation where we have to play whack-a-mole every ten years where

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.480
a new one's going to emerge.

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.320
Is there some way we can look across the spectrum of the coronavirus and say, you know, these

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.200
are the three or four that we should be looking for in the next few years.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:54.440
I think the advent of synthetic biology or synthetic genome design actually may allow

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.200
us to get to that question cheaply.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.800
So if Christ is synthesizing viral genomes, get down to about five cents a day.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.640
Now they've repeated this too often.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:11.440
Not only that, but it's actually something that Kevin McCurnan repeats all the time too.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.800
And all these human genome project people repeat over and over again.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.280
It's not the same.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.040
Just because they can print lots of books doesn't mean that they understand it.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.440
But it does mean that if they wanted to tell you that a book was spreading around the world,

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:27.440
they could print a lot of copies of it and then distribute it around the world and lie

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.680
to you about it.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.680
Holy shit.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680
The library is enrollment.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.680
It's there too.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680
Wow.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.680
How did that happen?

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.560
It's not because books copy themselves and fly around the world.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.680
It's because DNA and RNA can be copied pretty well and it can be distributed and it can

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:48.400
be tested for using simple methods like PCR.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:56.120
And so the careful orchestrated control of a narrative about coronaviruses as a cover

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:04.880
for the eventual use of self-replicating RNAs in therapeutics seems like almost too

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.080
obvious to me.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:09.120
Do I really have to point that out?

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:14.640
Do I really have to say that if you wanted to convince the people that they should be

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:21.280
allowed to be tested on with self-replicating vaccines or self-replicating RNAs, one of

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.560
the best ways to mess around with them would be to say that all these things are outside

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.560
of you.

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:31.120
So if you find one, if you get sick, if we detect one, we don't know where it came from.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.800
Must have been a Batcave or a laboratory.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.600
Couldn't have possibly been from the testing we're doing.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.480
It couldn't have been possibly in the vaccine that we gave you.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.280
Couldn't be possibly in the food you eat.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.800
It's a crime, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:50.040
It's a crime scene that extends decades into the past and so we shouldn't assume to know

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:56.960
anything at this point, except to know that this guy was, again, laying down a narrative

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.560
which was part of where we are now.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:08.760
It's a continuous narrative, it's a continuous story, there's a prelude like the Hobbit and

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:15.440
then there's the three main stories and so the Hobbit is what you're seeing right here.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.480
This is the creation of the ring.

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:23.640
This is the creation of the mythology of Mordor and all that stuff.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.640
It's there.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.640
It's definitely there.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:30.600
I mean, and now he's very slowly seeding a narrative of now it's even more dangerous

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:36.240
because we can make this shit cheap.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.600
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, they knew this was going to be their narrative.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600
They knew that this was going to be this Scooby-Doo.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.560
That's why it's so beautiful.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.840
Jeff's kiss here.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.800
More than two decades they've been planning to pull this scheme on us so it's not surprising

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.200
that it's a little better than the sting.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.240
You've never seen the movie The Sting.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:07.280
That's one of these things where the setup and the orchestrated setup is here.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.240
The orchestrated setup took decades.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.280
They were setting up an entire bureaucracy and hoping that other bureaucracies around

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:18.920
the world would be set up as well.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.160
They were setting up non-governmental organizations.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:31.400
They were setting up entire populations of Western countries for this exercise.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.000
And they started a long time ago.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.840
I assure you, it is one continuous narrative.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:44.240
That's why Judy Mickovitz's history is so important to understand how close it comes

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:51.080
to Robert Malone's history because it's one continuous theater and they try their best

01:33:51.080 --> 01:34:03.440
not to recycle and add new actors because that's new variables and new potential cracks.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.360
Wait till David Baltimore dies.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.680
Wait until some of these people pass away how quickly things will change.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.240
That's what I'm going to say.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.280
It's scared the hell out of some of this.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.160
But it does allow us to ask the questions in an affordable manner.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.640
The other way to do it even more cheaply is to actually clone out the spike genes and

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.400
make, in essence, the competence where you drop the spike gene in a different bat coronavirus

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:34.000
is that you think may have appropriate properties that could be pre-emergent strains and characterize

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.360
their ability to replicate in human cells, both primary cells and other cells in culture.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.120
So those types of questions.

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:47.800
If Mike Eden were to see some videos of soap and realize that Sasha's daughter was a medler

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:53.200
in the United States promoted by the National Security State onto Alex Jones three times

01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:01.560
or two times in 2019, Michael Eden will discard Sasha Latipova like the Eastern European

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.600
handkerchief that she represents.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:12.480
She will be nothing more than a ratty Shae Guevara t-shirt on the floor of Mike Eden's

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:20.960
new Porsche that he'll dispose of at the earliest convenient garbage can.

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.440
She's a joke and there's no reason to talk about her any more than that.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:29.600
If she has Mike Eden enchanted, then whenever he needs help, all you got to do is send him

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:36.200
a video of soap and then remind him that this young woman was a young lady daughter

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.880
of Sasha Latipova, whatever you want to call her, was making highly produced, most likely,

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:51.240
military intelligence level videos causing chaos and confusion and bad energy in the

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:56.760
United States in 2019 and it wasn't by random.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.360
It's not random.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.320
Her daughter is not random.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:09.280
Her daughter can only be seen as an active operation of some kind or another.

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.000
In my opinion, I don't see any other way to interpret it because it's not.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.840
Watch her interviews with Alex Jones.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:24.920
Listen to what she says about her family and about herself and about what she does.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.960
I just think it's actually sad that they brought Sasha into it.

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:34.280
I mean, it really shows you how off-script they must be or how arrogant they've become

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:40.720
in terms of their confidence and their ability to govern with this mythology and these liars.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:46.640
But you don't have to worry about Sasha, I mean, that is one of the bigger jokes in

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.640
this story to me.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.320
I don't even think about her anymore.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:37:00.560
Her daughter is such a obvious con that there's no other way to take Sasha other than an obvious

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.560
con.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.640
Sasha stepped in front of two people that may have had legitimate messages, Catherine

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.200
Watt, and this guy, Craig Particopper from the UK.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.680
And it doesn't matter what they think of Sasha, you can see very clearly that their messages

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.800
that came out originally are different than Sasha's.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.280
And it doesn't matter if Catherine Watts says she's fine with Sasha representing her

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.680
because I'm not on the internet anymore.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.240
What Sasha does with what I saw Catherine Watt does is boil down a very complicated hierarchy

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.920
into the DoD.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:41.880
Or she makes it about her daughter, you know, like it's not weird.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.160
Like her daughter is not an obvious red flag.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.880
And that to me is where if you see that she was on stage with Robert Malone and Meryl

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.920
Nasse in 2022 and Sweden, like they traveled the world together, this is just blatantly

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:05.520
a military operation, a psychological military operation, probably being run by HHS or DITRA

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.200
or any of these other organizations that can at times influence or impose on the DoD but

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.360
can't tell them what to do.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:21.280
I would go so far as to say the most likely thing is that Ralph Barrack and the CDC and

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:28.720
the NIH like Tony Fauci and all of these people at HHS, they actually staged a pandemic to

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.920
fool the DoD.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.640
And maybe, maybe it's possible that somebody like Robert Malone is involved in that operation

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.080
to fool the DoD into thinking there was a pandemic so that the DoD would indeed do the

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:48.360
stupid shit that they did, which is transfect all the troops.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.360
I want you to think about that very carefully, ladies and gentlemen, who were they on who

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.280
were they fooling in 2020?

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.080
Were they fooling you or me?

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.160
No, they weren't even in front of us in 2020.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.840
They were fooling people behind the scenes.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.160
They were fooling the DoD, I bet.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.360
So that the DoD would be on board on this.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:17.200
And now if the DoD is no longer on board on this, what would you see change?

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.120
What would happen?

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.120
Now you're starting to ask the right questions, ladies and gentlemen.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.240
Now I think we're starting to get somewhere.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:31.720
When we start to see that this illusion is complete, it's not just one guy pretending

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:32.720
to stop the train.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.360
There were hundreds of people that were pretending to stop and start the train, which made this

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.280
illusion so much more effective.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.880
One guy doing it doesn't really work.

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.720
It's actually funny when you watch him do it, right?

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.920
He's going to chalk his hands up now and he's going to push the train to get it started

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.920
again.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.640
But I've said this before and I will say it today again.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.600
Imagine if there were 20 of him and they were very big and they were wearing mech suits

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.000
that made a lot of noise and sparked.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.080
Now the illusion of consensus would be much harder to dispel if they made groaning noises

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.080
and whatever.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.680
You know, it would be much harder to dispel the illusion.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.680
And I need you to see very clearly that if Robert Malone and Meryl Nasse and Mary Holland

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:26.480
and Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kevin

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:33.800
McCarron and Charles Ricksy and Steve Kirsch and Carrot Bundenbalschen and all of these

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:42.240
people around the world have been in a coordinated theater pretending to stop the train, agreeing

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:49.840
that the train exists, agreeing that certain things work to stop it when they don't.

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.680
Agreeing that the train is getting faster or slower, that this blue train is different

01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:01.040
and the red train is how they did it.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.640
It's actually how they did it.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.560
I still keep hearing a little tiny whisper of something in the background like I'm like

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560
I'm missing something.

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560
Is this?

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560
Oh, it was playing.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560
I knew it.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560
Something was going wrong.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.720
Sorry about that.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.240
You probably couldn't hear that, but I could hear it.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.000
And so this list is incomplete, but it's the point that we're trying to make that's

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
important here.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:29.160
The point is, is that the more people that orchestrate and agree to participate, you

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.600
know, if you have five people on Twiv, it's even more effective.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.560
If you have four people on the view, it's even more effective than three.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.800
If Judy Woodruff in interviews two people, it's even more effective than her just talking

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.960
to you.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:50.040
And that's why they have engaged in more and more of these, these fake conversations

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.000
on television rather than just a single reporter.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
A single reporter, his ideas that you can then process in real time and argument is

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.880
something you got to pay attention to and, and, and, and your, your understanding becomes

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.880
limited by that.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.640
And that's how they got us to solve the mystery.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.440
The Scooby-Doo has this thing does.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:15.200
The Scooby-Doo was presented to us at, behind the scenes, I'm sure, by people like Robert

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.000
Malone behind the scenes, by people like Mike Callahan, by people like Rick Brown.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.680
Right, by people like Redfield and Fauci and Burks, all convinced that something was

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:26.680
happening.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:32.120
Then they put it on the PBS NewsHour and before you know it, they fooled the DoD.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.680
That's a scenario that nobody seems to want to consider because remember, the DoD takes

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:37.680
orders.

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:39.480
They don't just do stuff.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.800
So an easy way to blame the DoD would be to fool the DoD into doing something they shouldn't

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.360
have done and then say that they shouldn't know.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360
How would you do that?

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:53.800
You would use a team worst case scenario behind the scenes and several years of, of,

01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:01.380
of pandemic exercises and publications and funding the building of an infrastructure and

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:08.440
response to it and, and James Giordano explaining why we need a response to it and how it would

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.440
work.

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:13.480
And then a careful seeding of a molecular signal that could be misconstrued as a spreading

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:21.160
novel pathogen could trigger a plan that the DoD would execute with brutal precision,

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.680
just like any other kill chain that engages it.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.160
I just learned that phrase this weekend.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.600
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been manipulated.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.440
We have been manipulated by these people who claim to be coming to our rescue on white

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.940
horses.

01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:44.940
They manipulated people behind the scenes in 2020 and 21 to make sure that the bureaucracy

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:50.420
that is the United States government would, for the most part, lumber forward and behind

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:57.820
the scenes, this illusion of consensus resulted in millions of people being coerced, fooled,

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:03.140
or frightened into taking a transfection as a therapeutic.

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:09.740
And people like Robert Malone are engaged in covering up that, that crime.

01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:13.020
They want you to blame the pharmaceutical companies for their rush.

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:15.340
They want you to blame the government for their rush.

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:21.220
They want you to blame contamination in the shots.

01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.180
They don't want you to blame them.

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.700
They don't want you to blame them for lying about the murder.

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.300
They don't want you to blame them for distracting you from the murder.

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:31.740
They don't want you to blame them for covering for the murder.

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:39.380
And they don't want you to blame and even know what they were doing in 2020 and 2021.

01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:45.820
And that's why I make this pretty bold statement when I say that the no virus theme and the

01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:50.820
gain of function lab leak theme were maintained with the same ideas in mind.

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:55.060
They were maintained as a limited spectrum of debate to make sure that we had plenty

01:44:55.060 --> 01:45:00.340
to argue about and plenty of people to listen to argue about it.

01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:08.340
And none of those people usefully talked about the totality of the malfeasance that

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:16.580
was ongoing in 2020 that allowed them to misconstrue really bad ideas as the spread of a really

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:23.140
dangerous RNA pathogen rather than the ideas themselves.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:29.020
Any of these people could have scored a touchdown four years ago like I tried to by writing

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.700
a review that codifies everything they're now talking about.

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:39.380
But on my website, that review is labeled as a gigantic mythology that I myself bought

01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:43.620
into three years ago and have finally pulled my head out of, whereas all of these people

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:50.900
including Meryl Nash, Mary Holland and Robert Malone are actually pushing the exact biology

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:58.020
that is detailed at the Scooby-Doo link on my website, which I disavowed as a mythology

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:04.100
of the national security state more than a year and a half ago now.

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:07.380
This illusion was created actively by them.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:12.580
Robert Malone, Meryl Nash, Mary Holland, they're all part of it.

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:17.540
Wittingly or unwittingly because they refuse to pull their head out of this illusion of

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.540
consensus.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.180
In fact, they keep reinforcing it.

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.780
They keep defending it.

01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:25.700
They keep making sure that we never see this graph.

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:29.900
They keep making sure that they never say anything to the effect of maybe they murdered

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:33.340
people and lied about it.

01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:37.780
Even when they know they murdered people and lied about it, they try their hardest not

01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:43.220
to accentuate that because they're afraid then people might think there's no virus.

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.860
Because what I had it, it was strange.

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.420
Meryl Nash had it three times, although she never tested it.

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.360
And these people have been around the world, ladies and gentlemen, Americans have been

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.960
around the world.

01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:03.040
Canadians have been around the world working for the slavers and absorbing the people

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040
that need absorbing.

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.560
In this case, probably Ryan Cole and probably Nick Hudson and probably Denny Rancor are

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:15.900
being absorbed as his Byron Bridal was absorbed already a long time ago when Robert Malone

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.280
and Brett Weinstein did a podcast pretending that they weren't completely distracting from

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:29.880
Byron Bridal's coming out party in Canada, which occurred in the same frickin' month.

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:37.560
So I think that what you see is that they bring these heroes like Byron Bridal and Denny

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:43.240
Rancor and Nick Hudson to a place like Romania and not to the US Senate.

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:51.300
These same frickin' people, do you think Robert Malone didn't choose the Senate hearing

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:57.000
composition on purpose that, well, Nick Hudson couldn't make it?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.120
You know, Denny Rancor, he couldn't make it.

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.280
They could make it to Romania, but they couldn't make it to the Senate.

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.080
Byron Bridal can't make it down here.

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.440
That's a tough travel.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.840
Once you see these liars for who they are, these meddlers for who they are and how obvious

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:17.520
it is that they have to be liars, that they're meddling with these people, that they're

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.720
actively engaged in our governance through lying because they cover up Denny's work,

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:27.760
Nick's work, Ryan Cole's long speaking out from the very beginning gets marginalized

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:32.080
by these people.

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.360
Do you really think that Jennifer Jessica Rose deserves to make tens of thousands of

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.760
dollars a month as a sub-stack writer given her track record as a virologist, immunologist,

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:52.280
computational biologist, and whatever else she says she is, however many other degrees,

01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:58.760
she says she's got the one thing that threw me off from the very beginning with Jessica

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.600
Rose was her claiming of post-doctoral degrees.

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.320
There's no such thing.

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.720
You don't do a post-doc in immunology and then say you have a post-doctoral degree in

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720
immunology.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.360
That's not how it works, but she's been saying that shit for three years.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.880
That's just bullshit.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.080
That's just deceptive.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.360
She's never had a 10-year track position.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.640
She's never even tried to maintain one.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.840
She's never had an R01 grant or even helped someone write one.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.320
She's never been on a nature neuroscience paper or a science paper.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.880
She's never designed the experiments for one.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:42.160
The best that she has done is create computer models of viral infection, computer models

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:51.280
of viral replication or computer models of viral distribution.

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:58.480
Brett Weinstein's dad worked for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s dad as the first patent lawyer

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:05.280
in the Department of Justice appointed by John F. Kennedy.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:11.960
In 2021, Brett Weinstein had Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his podcast for three hours.

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:14.640
They never mentioned it.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:18.880
Even more interestingly, Brett never released that podcast for almost 14 months.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:24.800
From November 2021, he held on to it until February 2023 and then he played it when it

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:30.600
was cool to amplify Bobby.

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:37.160
And in 2021, I was actually in a signal chat with Brett Weinstein where he never told us

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:43.040
that he interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at that time.

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:49.040
We have been so played, ladies and gentlemen, played by people who play for them.

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:52.840
The piles of weaponized money that control our government, the governments around the

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.240
world, pharmaceutical companies and corporations around the world are all controlled by the

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:02.120
same weaponized piles of money and these players play for them.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:08.400
It is possible that a guy like Dell is absolutely fooled.

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:14.400
That's why he's got a genuine smile on his face, not an uncomfortable one.

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.280
It's very possible that Brian Hooker, this is one of the best days of his life and he's

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.400
just happy he can try to contribute to this group of people.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:31.240
Brian Hooker's got his hands full with a very vaccine injured adult child and all kinds

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.760
of responsibilities at CHD which make him barely able to process on a daily basis what

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.760
he's got to do and how to do it.

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.360
You can't blame him for wanting to try this.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:48.480
You can't blame a lot of these people for having been there.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:53.680
But I do blame the ones that I have circled in green because I do know that these people

01:51:53.680 --> 01:52:02.920
have lied to me to my face about COVID biology or to about their experience with it and more.

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:06.200
And that's why I don't fear calling these people out anymore.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.200
What are they going to do?

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.080
Sue me for the truth.

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:15.160
These people are a part of an organized operation that was designed to make everyone on earth

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:22.880
believe that transfection in healthy humans was rushed but it pretty much worked.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:27.400
And that RNA can cause a pandemic whether it's laboratory or bat cave origin.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:34.400
And these are lies that can be very easily taught around, very easily taught over but

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.800
you need to learn biology and you need to pay attention to what they don't say.

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.760
Pay attention to what they don't talk about.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:48.680
They're really dumb simple explanations or they're extremely stupid complicated explanations.

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.680
Either way, they avoid telling you the simple truth that books have been written about this

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:53.680
for decades.

01:52:53.680 --> 01:53:00.760
I got a whole shelf of them now extend back to the early 90s where they are ceding a narrative

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:09.080
of this worst case scenario.

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:13.840
We've been in the car trapped with these people for four years and then we're in the

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:19.000
car, we're in the back seat and the driver and the passenger and the person sitting next

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:26.400
to us are all coordinatedly lying to us about a novel virus that millions of people died

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:30.000
from, the millions more were saved from, I think came from gain of function and will

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.760
come again.

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.240
And if we don't discard these people as the meddling traders that they are then we will

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:45.600
be effectively enslaving our children by the mythology that they have laid.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.440
Once again, this is our hypothesis.

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.160
They lied to us about a dangerous novel virus and used every means necessary to convince

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:58.040
us of its existence, financial incentives, a previously characterized background misconstrued

01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.040
as spread.

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.040
All of this is possible.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.040
It's a crime.

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.040
I don't know how they did it.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:03.040
I just know that they didn't.

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:08.720
But they say happened, which is an RNA molecule is pandemicking now, did not and cannot happen.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.560
There is no precedence for it in biology.

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:16.560
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.720
the control group by any means necessary.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.320
And if you'd like to help, please share this stream.

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.320
What?

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320
What?

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.320
Blue epidemiology.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.320
Many episodes of Weave are off the line.

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:30.320
I would particularly talk about things that track every position.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320
Oh darn, it's deep.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:34.320
You've got to go over here and stop there again.

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.320
You're here.

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.320
And let's go forward.

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.320
This river is too many.

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.320
Anyway, thanks very much guys.

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:46.320
I really appreciate it.

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.320
Why didn't I stop it?

01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:52.320
I thought I stopped you.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.320
This has been GIGO and Biological.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:59.320
It's a high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.320
We are supported by viewers like you.

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:06.320
So if you'd like to help out with that, please go to GIGO and biological.com and find a way

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.320
to contribute.

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.320
Again, I will be on tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.320
Look for a sub stack.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.320
I'm probably going to put something up later today.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.320
It won't be a video or a transcript.

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:19.320
But it'll be something related to what I talked to at the beginning of the stream so that

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:23.320
we can make sure that we see why.

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:25.320
So to speak, cover our asses.

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.320
Thank you very much and I will see you again soon.

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:56.320
Thanks for watching.
