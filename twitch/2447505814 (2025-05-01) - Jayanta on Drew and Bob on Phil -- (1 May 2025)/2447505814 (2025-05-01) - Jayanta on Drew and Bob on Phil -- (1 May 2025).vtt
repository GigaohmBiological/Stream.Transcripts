Mike Vandenberg, Mixtape.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.154
Good morning, everybody.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.394
Test one, two.

02:22.594 --> 02:23.735
My ears are a little low.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.575
Test one, two.

02:24.675 --> 02:25.515
Good morning, everybody.

02:25.555 --> 02:26.296
Welcome to the show.

02:26.316 --> 02:27.676
This is Gigome Biological.

02:27.736 --> 02:29.076
Good to see everybody in the chat.

02:29.096 --> 02:30.717
The streak is alive, Brother Spoon.

02:30.737 --> 02:31.497
That is correct.

02:32.158 --> 02:34.118
The streak is alive.

02:35.099 --> 02:35.919
Good to see everybody.

02:46.954 --> 02:50.476
Hello, and welcome to episode four of The David Frum Show.

02:51.076 --> 02:53.258
I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic.

02:53.878 --> 02:56.439
Thank you for all who watched and listened the first three episodes.

02:56.920 --> 03:03.063
All of us at The Atlantic and at The David Frum Show are so gratified by the extraordinary response to our first three episodes.

03:03.183 --> 03:17.758
Just to let everybody know, don't forget that the address behind me here is a place where you can send your self-addressed stamped envelope and get a velcro patch that says GigaOMBiological and GigaOMBiological.com like on my arm here.

03:18.319 --> 03:23.404
And you can also get some stickers that are nice to put on your car or your water bottle like is on my water bottle.

03:24.905 --> 03:29.448
And so, yeah, that's also a place where you could, in theory, send donations.

03:29.508 --> 03:32.309
But you can also just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to P.O.

03:32.329 --> 03:35.570
Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

03:35.870 --> 03:39.652
And it's 15-102, and we'll get that right out to you.

03:41.393 --> 03:42.674
And David's crazy.

03:42.734 --> 03:43.494
Listen to this guy.

03:43.534 --> 03:44.715
Answer in virology.

03:45.155 --> 03:47.496
So I'm very glad to be joined today by Alan Bernstein.

03:47.976 --> 03:52.098
And first, some preliminary remarks on the subjects we'll be talking about in today's discussion.

03:53.760 --> 04:03.043
Okay, so David Frum is obviously somebody who's been in front of, let's say, more conservative audiences in America for a long time.

04:04.284 --> 04:07.905
I know David Frum from like the George Bush administration.

04:08.846 --> 04:11.867
And so this guy has been in media for a long time.

04:11.907 --> 04:12.707
He has a long

04:13.147 --> 04:14.828
following with people who vote.

04:15.309 --> 04:22.373
He has a long following with people with a lot of money or people who are sitting on a lot of retirement or a lot of property.

04:22.974 --> 04:32.600
And so these people are the people who are listening to these old people, the same people who still consider Dr. Phil, for example, somebody to listen to.

04:33.060 --> 04:33.961
There is a very

04:35.367 --> 04:51.116
There's a very aimed message that is being aimed through the high precision of social media and the algorithms and programming that are available there, but also just using pre-existing voices that are already

04:52.219 --> 04:53.480
complete puppets, right?

04:53.580 --> 05:02.044
And David Frum is one of these people who is simply not sophisticated enough to understand that he has been a part of this illusion for so long.

05:02.504 --> 05:06.527
He's been playing on their stage for so long that he can no longer

05:07.387 --> 05:13.711
separate his performance and his contribution to that illusion from reality anymore.

05:13.771 --> 05:21.975
But what's remarkable is I think he's a very good barometer for how some of our neighbors are actually feeling right now.

05:22.055 --> 05:28.019
And certainly the consensus that he's going to try and create with the help of this Canadian

05:29.156 --> 05:36.579
authority figure from the equivalent of the Canadian CDC, I guess, is very, very extraordinary.

05:36.619 --> 05:42.440
But his preliminary remarks before he brings on his guest are simply dumbfounding.

05:43.381 --> 05:44.961
So buckle up.

05:45.441 --> 05:52.204
As I record this episode in late April 2025, the United States is gripped by an outbreak of measles.

05:53.157 --> 05:56.418
More than 800 cases have been diagnosed in 24 states.

05:57.098 --> 06:02.480
Three people are dead, two of them unvaccinated school-age children, one of them an unvaccinated adult.

06:04.061 --> 06:12.864
We are only about one third of the way through the year 2025, and yet the United States has suffered nearly triple the number of cases of measles in 2025 as it did in all of 2024.

06:12.944 --> 06:20.867
The measles is caused, of course, by a pathogen, but it is enabled by human ignorance and human neglect.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.171
Rising numbers of children are going unvaccinated.

06:25.372 --> 06:31.897
About a third of American children fail to get the full suite of vaccines that the CDC's Centers for Disease Control recommends.

06:32.337 --> 06:34.959
And about 7% of- The full suite.

06:35.219 --> 06:37.421
Gosh, I love that word when you use it right.

06:37.461 --> 06:41.464
The full suite of recommended CDC vaccines.

06:41.524 --> 06:44.607
It's like, how can you possibly reject this?

06:45.347 --> 06:52.257
this amazing offer from modern civilization to reject this suite of medical interventions.

06:52.738 --> 06:56.143
American children go unvaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella.

06:57.658 --> 07:01.040
These are invitations to human harm and human suffering.

07:01.701 --> 07:09.185
And they come about because of a rise in American attitudes of ignorance and unawareness about the causes of disease and how diseases are prevented.

07:09.746 --> 07:15.749
Let me read you a recent statement from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an important source of health and medical research information.

07:15.889 --> 07:17.070
Here's Kaiser.

07:17.410 --> 07:26.396
I think the Kaiser Family Foundation actually funds the VSRF of Steve Kirsch, or maybe it's the Skoll Foundation, or maybe it's both, I don't know.

07:28.052 --> 07:38.706
When it comes to false claims that the measles vaccines have been proven to cause autism, or that vitamin A can prevent the measles infections, or that getting the measles vaccine is more dangerous than becoming infected with measles,

07:39.488 --> 07:45.135
Less than 5% of adults say they think these claims are definitely true, and much larger shares say they are definitely false.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.698
That's the good news, returning to Kaiser.

07:48.199 --> 07:57.490
However, at least half of adults are uncertain about whether these claims are true or false, falling in the malleable middle and saying each claim is either probably true or probably false.

07:58.285 --> 08:14.174
While at least half of adults express some level of uncertainty, partisans differ in the shares who say each of these false claims is definitely or probably true, with Republicans and independents at least twice as likely as Democrats to believe or lean toward believing each false claim about measles.

08:15.335 --> 08:24.420
One third of Republicans and a quarter of independents say it is definitely or probably true that the MMR vaccines have been proven to cause autism, compared to 1 in 10 Democrats.

08:25.285 --> 08:33.251
Three in 10 Republicans and independents say it is definitely or probably true that vitamin A can prevent measles compared to 14% of Democrats.

08:33.711 --> 08:43.959
Now he is pretending that we have somehow gotten here as an exclusive result, and he's going to say it in a minute, of some kind of MAGA thing.

08:44.459 --> 08:53.086
That it's just because MAGA is so good at messaging that they've really screwed this otherwise obviously

08:54.005 --> 09:07.210
one of the greatest things ever to happen in civilization's history, the vaccination schedule in America, is being undermined by this, I guess they're just too good at telling lies.

09:07.230 --> 09:08.931
They're too good at telling stories.

09:09.371 --> 09:11.292
And so now we're in big trouble in America.

09:11.352 --> 09:13.593
It's a really remarkable narrative.

09:16.214 --> 09:18.335
And wait until you hear how far he goes with it.

09:19.549 --> 09:40.726
one in five republicans and independents believe or lean toward believing that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than measles infection compared to i mean the only thing that would make these polls worse is if he gave a p value that went along with it it's it is absolutely remarkable a poll shows which is essentially trying to cast a weak spell

09:41.827 --> 09:43.667
of an illusion of consensus, right?

09:43.687 --> 09:50.809
It's a weak enchantment, but if it's combined with a lot of other certainty, then that enchantment can become stronger.

09:50.849 --> 09:52.989
And that's what a poll seems to represent.

09:53.149 --> 10:00.151
It's like there is a consensus of humans that believes this, and there's a consensus of humans that believe that.

10:00.691 --> 10:02.691
And this one's a problem and that one's not.

10:02.811 --> 10:08.013
And so it is an amazing enchantment that polls can be used to create.

10:08.313 --> 10:09.893
But one in 10 Democrats.

10:10.785 --> 10:14.128
Republicans are believing things that are putting their own children at risk.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.969
Yes, this is the Atlantic podcast.

10:15.989 --> 10:20.974
We see again how the MAGA cult is becoming a death cult that consumes the lives of its believers.

10:21.834 --> 10:25.978
Hundreds of thousands of Americans died preventably from the COVID virus.

10:26.318 --> 10:30.702
Your chance of dying from COVID was about the same whether you lived, whether you were a Republican or a Democrat.

10:32.123 --> 10:35.026
The disease did not discriminate by political affiliation.

10:35.606 --> 10:38.869
But after vaccines became available, the disease began to discriminate.

10:39.309 --> 10:46.535
Suddenly, people in blue towns and blue states began to survive the disease at much higher rates than people in red towns and red states.

10:47.136 --> 10:58.926
The price... If that is possible, it is because they apply different protocols to people who were entering the hospital vaccinated or unvaccinated.

10:59.946 --> 11:11.778
I would bet dollars to donuts, but of course this guy's gonna portray the and project the utmost certainty that it is a blue and red thing and it is a choice of whether they transfected themselves or not.

11:14.420 --> 11:19.185
Believing your favorite right-of-center influencer could have been your own life.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.864
What kind of political movement sacrifices its own people in that way?

11:24.164 --> 11:28.508
To make some point to make money or to score a political jab against an opponent?

11:29.169 --> 11:32.032
It's a little hard to explain exactly what they thought they were doing.

11:32.432 --> 11:33.273
It's not hard to explain.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.916
It's a little unpleasant to contemplate the explanation of what they thought they were doing.

11:37.137 --> 11:40.060
But we can measure the effect of what they were doing in lost lives.

11:40.600 --> 11:48.787
And now with the spread of measles vaccines, the spread of measles and the shrinkage of measles vaccines, according to political affiliation.

11:49.367 --> 11:50.208
I hope you don't mind.

11:50.228 --> 11:51.329
I'm going to go back a second.

11:51.349 --> 11:56.513
I just got a text from my son saying that the gym is still closed, apparently because they still don't have power.

11:56.573 --> 11:57.614
This is such bullshit.

11:57.754 --> 11:59.455
Anyway, I guess I can't go to the gym today.

11:59.956 --> 12:03.338
I just want to back it up a little bit, because while I was listening to that, I kind of.

12:04.179 --> 12:04.960
I kind of screwed up.

12:04.980 --> 12:07.342
Maybe I have to get my head out of the way for a second.

12:07.582 --> 12:14.609
This same horrible process of your favorite rightist and influencer could have been your own life.

12:15.404 --> 12:23.926
What kind of political movement sacrifices its own people in that way to make some point to make money or to score a political jab against an opponent?

12:24.586 --> 12:26.767
It's a little hard to explain exactly what they think.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.088
Now, what's interesting, what he says here, I knew I had to go back for a reason.

12:30.748 --> 12:36.150
What he says here is that the COVID discussion and the COVID

12:37.992 --> 12:46.536
sort of take the vaccine or not take the vaccine was used in cheap, low, you know, Bush League kind of ways.

12:46.616 --> 12:49.237
Very cheap kind of political stunts were done.

12:49.798 --> 12:51.899
And in the end, it cost a lot of people lives.

12:51.959 --> 12:56.881
And really, it just seems like they were willing to do that in order for a few more votes.

12:58.328 --> 13:14.842
And what's remarkable about my current take on things is that if you step back just a little bit and have a little longer time horizon as you try to understand this, he's not that far off from the truth, but it's not centered in COVID.

13:16.243 --> 13:23.369
COVID was an act in a much longer play, which had its

13:24.218 --> 13:41.545
It's sort of, let's say, a debut, a little opening night over in the UK with the MMR shot and with Andrew Wakefield and with Brian Deere and with Paul Shattuck and with Pauly Tommy.

13:42.385 --> 13:47.447
And then that same shtick was brought to Broadway in the United States.

13:49.988 --> 13:51.709
And they have been using a

13:53.905 --> 14:02.231
health freedom movement to vacuum up all of these different concerns, including the most damaged parents.

14:03.332 --> 14:07.115
It's not the most damaged parents, the parents of the most damaged kids.

14:08.016 --> 14:16.062
And the parents of the most damaged kids are sucked into this movement or stood in front of by this movement.

14:17.863 --> 14:20.866
And it seems like they convinced an awful lot of people

14:22.130 --> 14:27.735
to believe that this movement would ultimately succeed once Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:27.795 --> 14:31.999
got into the White House, and he would change things once Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:32.019 --> 14:33.620
was elected to a office.

14:34.161 --> 14:38.525
And what I find striking is that Skyhorse Publishing

14:39.588 --> 14:41.668
the book publisher of CHD.

14:41.808 --> 14:51.670
One of the reasons why I got fired was because I wasn't helping to sell Robert Malone's books, which are published by Children's Health Defense and Sky Horse Publishing.

14:52.311 --> 15:04.313
They had a book in 2008 with an epilogue in it, which described a scenario where Bobby Kennedy as an independent would help another candidate win the White House.

15:08.206 --> 15:34.726
It's hard for me to believe that that chapter was just a whimsical story told by Jesse Ventura and published by Skyhorse Publishing, given the fact that then, year after year, there is a Wakefield book, a Wakefield book, a James Lyons Wyler book, and then the real Anthony Fauci, all in a nice row, almost like everybody had been co-opted.

15:35.779 --> 15:49.223
And it's really interesting that a lot of these people can be seen on camera or on recording saying things better earlier, before they were co-opted.

15:51.284 --> 16:01.047
And so here we are, what I need you to realize or try to suck in and swallow is that we have been brought here by design.

16:02.045 --> 16:11.654
The Rolling Stone article about measles in Samoa was put there in place with the intention of this now happening.

16:14.702 --> 16:18.564
I can't say that everybody that's involved understands all the working parts.

16:18.644 --> 16:43.878
I don't know how many working parts Donald Trump understands or Bobby Kennedy understands or Jay Bhattacharya understands, but I do understand that there is something else happening here and it is a coordinated sabotage of American politics and of the fabric of America's society so that people on the left and the right believe that the other side is nuts.

16:46.175 --> 16:55.937
And part of the way that this has been achieved is that there are people that are operating on the conservative side of America who are actually lifelong Democrats.

16:58.977 --> 17:06.278
And it does seem like the Democratic Party to a large extent was, they're both corrupt, right?

17:06.419 --> 17:13.560
And it does seem as though there's something going on inside of the Democratic Party, which may be more united in its,

17:15.296 --> 17:22.984
its funding and its commitment to the script than what happens over on the conservative side.

17:23.004 --> 17:33.655
The conservative side may be in America a little bit more like herding cats, trying to get a bunch of people to believe that they're all on the same side when they're maybe not so much on the same side.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.177
Whereas on the left,

17:35.967 --> 18:02.939
There seems to be a very, very strong commitment to a unified front and list of arguments and talking points and visions, and that's a little more frightening, but nevertheless, it is striking to see somebody like this guy, essentially a neocon, on the opposite side of what would be the Bannon populist movement, health, freedom, Mary Holland, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:05.011 --> 18:07.073
thought they were doing, it's not hard to explain it.

18:07.093 --> 18:10.675
It's a little unpleasant to contemplate the explanation of what they thought they were doing.

18:10.896 --> 18:13.838
But we can measure the effect of what they were doing in lost lives.

18:14.378 --> 18:31.792
And now, with the spread of measles vaccines, the spread of measles and the shrinkage of measles vaccines, according to political affiliation, we can say this same horrible process of death by political partisanship reoccurring in the middle 2020s as at the beginning of the 2020s.

18:34.139 --> 18:49.389
Against this spread of weaponized ignorance, what is needed is the clearest possible messages from everyone in positions of authority, whether public or private, that it is your duty as a parent to see that your child is vaccinated against preventable disease.

18:50.029 --> 18:53.591
And if your children are unvaccinated, you have failed in your duty as a parent.

18:53.951 --> 18:57.934
And that is a message that needs to be spread by everyone who's in a position to spread a message.

18:58.638 --> 19:07.346
Now we're starting to get into this category of statements where you can almost hear him justifying extreme measures.

19:08.767 --> 19:12.691
And I think I wanna give another hat tip to Louis C.K.

19:12.991 --> 19:19.117
and the clip that Robert, sorry, that Mark Kulak tipped me off to where Louis C.K.

19:19.257 --> 19:24.902
is waxing intellectual about people that get very upset about abortion clinics.

19:26.796 --> 19:35.304
And he explains that, you know, I kind of understand how they feel because they think that those abortion clinics are killing babies.

19:35.924 --> 19:44.071
And so if you think that they're killing babies, it kind of makes sense that you would go and act a little extreme about it, get a little fired up about it.

19:45.893 --> 19:49.356
And now if you believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:49.436 --> 19:53.480
is putting kids at risk, if you believe that a parent

19:54.704 --> 20:00.109
that does not choose to vaccinate their child is guilty of some kind of crime.

20:02.511 --> 20:20.227
Now there's a social, there's social friction being set up here that is very far from, let's say a Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox rivalry.

20:22.952 --> 20:28.661
And that's what I find most disturbing about what I see on the internet and what I see on mainstream media.

20:28.681 --> 20:33.008
It is frightening because there is a unified front.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.212
This message is very, very clear.

20:37.739 --> 20:51.091
And it is impossible to see the history of this story without seeing this red thread of Bobby Kennedy slowly being inserted into this narrative and pieces of this narrative being laid down.

20:51.611 --> 20:57.917
Meanwhile, people being absorbed into this narrative with the narrative itself actually not making any progress.

21:00.896 --> 21:18.476
Autism has become more and more complicated because we diagnose it differently, but also because the big top tent of health freedom that ICAN and CHD have established have sucked in all kinds of things that aren't involved with injury as a result of intramuscular injection.

21:19.657 --> 21:20.958
Even though in the beginning,

21:21.980 --> 21:31.940
That's why the World Mercury Project changed its name to Children's Health Defense, was to, I guess, fight against the dangers of intramuscular injection.

21:33.282 --> 21:33.423
No.

21:35.677 --> 21:37.278
That's not what they were fighting against.

21:37.338 --> 21:42.681
They were fighting for the truth about autism or something like that.

21:42.801 --> 21:49.646
And that's where these rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear come from.

21:49.686 --> 21:54.409
They don't say anything because their intention was never to get anywhere.

21:54.869 --> 21:57.371
Their intention was to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:57.431 --> 21:57.851
somewhere.

21:59.170 --> 22:03.771
and use these people as the voters, as the masses.

22:04.392 --> 22:05.652
This was their strategy.

22:08.113 --> 22:10.333
And he claims not to be able to see it.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.474
He claims that it's just some MAGA thing.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.735
It's not a cheap stunt, ladies and gentlemen.

22:18.035 --> 22:27.038
It is the inversion of our sovereignty with the intention of changing our children to experimental animals so that they can be sampled regularly for the

22:28.806 --> 22:31.536
for the goals of what was the Human Genome Project.

22:33.556 --> 22:54.408
And the authorities should also say that in the hard cases, where it can be shown that a child died because of an intentional failure by the parent to vaccinate the child, that parent should be held to account in much the same way as, in my opinion, if the child died because of an unsecured firearm in the child's home left there by a parent, the parent should be held to account.

22:54.908 --> 22:57.910
Protecting your child is your most important duty as a parent.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.872
Put the gun in a safe and make sure the child is vaccinated.

23:01.516 --> 23:12.401
And yet, instead, we're seeing people put into positions of high authority who are not only hesitant to spread that message, but in fact, are the leading hoaxers and fraudsters against the vaccines.

23:12.961 --> 23:20.905
At the head of the Department of Health and Human Services is the most notorious proponent of letting people suffer the measles death.

23:21.686 --> 23:22.786
I take issue to that.

23:22.826 --> 23:25.287
The most notorious one is Andrew Wakefield.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.788
Come on, man, get your shit together.

23:28.004 --> 23:34.506
of spreading false claims, outrageous claims, debunked claims, exploded claims against the vaccines.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.687
And by the way, demeaning and insulting people who struggle with autism.

23:40.107 --> 23:56.652
People with autism can live meaningful lives, yet according to our present secretary, they're no better than wasted lives and useless people who need to be counted in some kind of registry so we can keep tab of their numbers for what sinister purpose who can barely begin to imagine.

23:56.994 --> 23:58.014
Oh, we know what it is.

23:58.074 --> 24:00.475
It's to solve the chronic disease crisis, right?

24:00.515 --> 24:10.920
Remember, we heard Nicole Shanahan saying it on the campaign trail that they were going to make a database and they were going to share the data from all other countries to all the countries that want to beat this chronic disease thing.

24:10.940 --> 24:13.661
They're going to use AI and it's going to be great.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.222
Mary Holland has said the same thing.

24:19.563 --> 24:21.424
And now he's going to characterize it as what?

24:23.345 --> 24:26.686
But clearly not from a position, not for a purpose of respect and dignity.

24:28.022 --> 24:44.268
And because of this outrageous and cruel lack of regard for people who are on the autism spectrum, many of which spans a lot of cases, both worse cases and less bad cases, he is urging Americans, or he has over his lifetime urged Americans to leave their children unvaccinated.

24:44.688 --> 24:54.732
And as Secretary of Health and Human Services, is staffing his agency with people who are at mealy mouth or worse in the fight against this preventable, unnecessary cause of death.

24:56.087 --> 24:59.415
The anti-vax ideology comes from some strange places.

25:00.197 --> 25:03.846
It comes, I think, in the first place from a myth of a benign nature.

25:04.392 --> 25:11.218
I think one of the reasons why it tended to, maybe before the Trump era, be so prevalent on certain parts of like the vegetarian left.

25:12.039 --> 25:15.001
If you believe that nature is kind and good and benign.

25:15.101 --> 25:15.822
It's funny, right?

25:15.942 --> 25:21.547
It's the vegetarian left, but now the vegetarian left has become the carnivorous right.

25:21.647 --> 25:23.108
It's so bizarre.

25:23.168 --> 25:23.869
Listen to this.

25:25.070 --> 25:26.531
And the only wickedness is human.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.634
And if you are unaware of how

25:31.294 --> 25:37.397
what tended to, maybe before the Trump era, be so prevalent on certain parts of the vegetarian left.

25:38.238 --> 25:46.642
If you believe that nature is kind and good and benign and the only wickedness is human, and if you are unaware of how

25:48.496 --> 25:52.237
Massively, human lives were at risk from disease before the modern era.

25:53.077 --> 26:01.558
It may seem like, why am I intruding into my beautiful child's body, this sharp needle that makes them squawk for a moment, and introducing these foreign substances?

26:01.918 --> 26:04.979
Why would I do that when nature wants us all to live and rejoice?

26:05.459 --> 26:07.659
Well, nature doesn't want you to live and rejoice.

26:07.779 --> 26:11.680
Nature is utterly indifferent to your hopes and wishes.

26:12.340 --> 26:14.820
And if it were up to nature, half your children would be dead.

26:15.181 --> 26:17.421
And you'd be dead, too, by age 50 at the latest.

26:18.822 --> 26:20.284
Nature is not our friend.

26:20.524 --> 26:23.888
Nature is a resource that we must protect and steward, but it is not our friend.

26:23.928 --> 26:24.749
It does not wish us well.

26:24.789 --> 26:25.850
It doesn't have wishes at all.

26:27.031 --> 26:31.933
I think some of the anti-vax cult also comes from another myth, the myth of malign government.

26:32.453 --> 26:54.360
Not just that government is inefficient, as it often is, and clumsy, as it often is, but that actually there's some kind of secret conspiracy up there of people who, for some bizarre and nefarious purpose, want to prevent Americans from enjoying the beneficent benignity of nature, and instead want to inject them with all of these artificial products, like seat belts.

26:57.402 --> 27:05.925
I think this is the part of the myth that has gained the upper hand most recently, this myth of conspiracy and government in other high places.

27:08.086 --> 27:14.070
But the truth, nature's not benign and government is not malign, but there are a lot of fraudsters out there.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.110
That's the truth.

27:15.751 --> 27:18.472
And they have more ways of reaching people than ever before.

27:18.753 --> 27:19.033
Oh my goodness.

27:19.073 --> 27:22.755
And the cost of these frauds is becoming ever more terrible in lost human lives.

27:23.616 --> 27:27.158
So as you listen to my talk today about Alan Bernstein, we're going to talk about many of these issues.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.514
I think we're going to try to talk as dispassionately as possible.

27:31.754 --> 27:34.176
But as I talk about them, I'm really angry about this.

27:34.717 --> 27:35.678
I'm really angry about this.

27:37.379 --> 27:37.859
It should be.

27:38.920 --> 27:49.143
One of those things, just as there are no Republican and Democrat ways to sweep the streets, shovel the snow, there should be no Republican or Democrat way, disagreement about protecting our children from preventable diseases.

27:49.423 --> 27:51.164
All of us should salute vaccination.

27:51.184 --> 27:54.245
It's one of the most magnificent achievements of human civilization.

27:54.645 --> 28:02.968
One of the ways that marks us off from all the sad eras that went before us, when parents had to leave half their children before their third birthday, before their fourth birthday.

28:04.388 --> 28:07.570
We have an opportunity to live better, healthier lives than ever before in history.

28:07.630 --> 28:09.171
How could we refuse such a thing?

28:09.672 --> 28:17.056
And how much should we condemn and revile those people who deceive their fellow citizens into refusing this magnificent gift of science and technology?

28:17.737 --> 28:20.219
So we're gonna speak dispassionately with Alan Bernstein.

28:20.279 --> 28:23.721
One of the ways that Mark says, ah, from all the sad eras that went before.

28:23.761 --> 28:31.626
Listen to this very carefully because he is talking specifically about how would I deal with somebody like Jonathan Cooey?

28:34.449 --> 28:38.872
Jonathan Cooey is actually a lot worse than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:38.952 --> 28:50.701
or Mary Holland or Brian Hooker or Merrill Nass because I say without hesitation that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances as medicine is a dumb idea.

28:51.321 --> 28:56.065
I will say that the vaccine schedule in America is unequivocally a criminal enterprise.

28:57.469 --> 29:07.054
There is no biological basis for injecting things into the muscle, and anybody that thinks so is just an ill-informed, non-thinking zombie.

29:08.155 --> 29:10.636
It's impossible for me to believe, but it's true.

29:11.016 --> 29:18.780
There is not a single MD that has come to me and said, hey, wait a minute, I've got a couple exceptions to the intramuscular injection is dumb thing.

29:18.820 --> 29:19.581
Be careful, Jay.

29:20.970 --> 29:24.471
Because there isn't any, there aren't any exceptions.

29:24.731 --> 29:27.573
The idea is absolutely preposterous.

29:28.513 --> 29:31.154
That's why it's so hard for it to disappear.

29:31.714 --> 29:44.119
So hard for people to challenge it, especially when there's been a fake anti-vax movement in America, sucking all of these thinking people up into a never-ending hamster wheel where we'll get to it next year.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.561
And let's fight the mandates and advocate for free speech.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.436
RNA cannot pandemic.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.157
Intramuscular injections are dumb.

29:59.237 --> 30:00.738
Transfection is a crime.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.220
And the population pyramid is a real thing.

30:05.041 --> 30:08.363
Our population on Earth is about to go down whether we like it or not.

30:09.683 --> 30:15.147
And the consequences of that may not be so manageable as these people don't want you to know.

30:18.029 --> 30:31.383
There may be a lot of chaos coming because of this change and we need to have our kids ready for it because we don't want them all moving to the cities and accepting all the rules in the cities when they could establish their own communities.

30:35.407 --> 30:39.171
Maybe there's going to be 50 states in the future that are all independent places where

30:39.884 --> 30:43.966
We live together in harmony and trade across our borders.

30:44.006 --> 30:49.368
I don't know what the future of America is, but I know for sure that this guy's not interested in my kid's future.

30:51.469 --> 30:55.610
This guy's not interested in the truth that I have to tell.

30:55.970 --> 31:04.754
He's already been in on this for so long that the only thing he can do is read the script that he's given with the vigor that he reads it with.

31:05.751 --> 31:08.297
Listen carefully, because this is pretty frightening.

31:08.438 --> 31:09.601
This is an American.

31:09.801 --> 31:15.395
For us, when parents had to grieve half their children before their third birthday or before their 20th birthday.

31:16.364 --> 31:19.565
We have an opportunity to live better, healthier lives than ever before in history.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.165
How could we refuse such a thing?

31:21.665 --> 31:29.046
And how much should we condemn and revile those people who deceive their fellow citizens into refusing this magnificent gift of science and technology?

31:29.726 --> 31:32.407
So we're going to speak dispassionately with Alan Bernstein.

31:32.807 --> 31:33.967
I'm not dispassionate about this.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.727
I hope you won't be dispassionate either.

31:36.308 --> 31:38.468
And now my interview with Alan Bernstein.

31:39.488 --> 31:41.448
That's some pretty crap.

31:42.309 --> 31:43.149
And it could go on.

31:43.189 --> 31:44.229
I could go on, but I won't.

31:45.660 --> 31:46.821
I'll get on with the show here.

31:48.081 --> 31:49.222
Thank you very much for being here.

31:49.262 --> 31:49.622
See you soon.

32:19.099 --> 32:19.679
so so

32:39.878 --> 32:39.958
do

33:04.477 --> 33:07.039
Good morning, good morning, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

33:07.079 --> 33:07.959
Welcome to the show.

33:08.019 --> 33:11.561
It is 1149, almost noon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

33:12.522 --> 33:14.383
We had a big storm a couple days ago.

33:14.423 --> 33:18.745
There's still trees all over the place and power's not installed everywhere.

33:18.845 --> 33:20.966
So I got a little extra time for you this afternoon.

33:21.607 --> 33:24.829
Life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

33:24.949 --> 33:26.510
Life is a pie with a tat.

33:28.944 --> 33:33.265
The new Biology 101 is something that makes me bounce out of my bed in the morning.

33:34.065 --> 33:40.968
And up until now, the voice that you're hearing is Jonathan Cooley, the chief biologist of Gigome Biological out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

33:41.988 --> 33:47.490
You can find the work of my previous stuff as an academic biologist on PubMed, of course.

33:48.071 --> 33:50.592
I presented to Panda a few times, but those are all lost.

33:50.652 --> 33:54.113
But you can find a lot of those ideas being recycled quite regularly.

33:54.933 --> 34:15.182
on a blog called Woodhouse76, a woman by the name of Jessica Hockett and a man by the name of Jonathan Engler, also associated with the meddler group Heart in the UK and the meddler group Panda, as I said before, in South Africa.

34:16.663 --> 34:28.493
These two are collaborating often on this Substack Woodhouse 76 to take my ideas and to have fake dialogues with other fake people like Claire Craig or Pierre Cory.

34:29.354 --> 34:40.404
And so if you see any of these articles out there and you think, wow, these ideas are strikingly similar to what Jonathan Cooey says, although a little bit watered down or a little bit

34:41.084 --> 34:52.452
complicated, or they're trying to make some big philosophy out of it, then you can pretty much see the evidence that, again, these people are just desperate at this point.

34:52.852 --> 35:00.297
They tried to get me very, very locked into the lab leak by making me one of the experts in the writing of the Wuhan cover-up book with

35:00.837 --> 35:14.022
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's now the Health and Human Service Secretary of America, and also actually gave me a job for a half a year as a staff scientist under the direction of Brian Hooker at Children's Health Defense.

35:14.062 --> 35:17.503
And at some point in time, this whole illusion just started to fall apart for me.

35:18.163 --> 35:23.785
And as I tried to explain to people what I was realizing, everything just kind of shut down.

35:23.885 --> 35:34.810
Even the guy that used to meet me at parties in California just doesn't talk to me anymore, even as he's rising from virtually a nobody to the head of the NIH.

35:35.410 --> 35:39.052
So people that have paid me aren't paying me anymore, that's for sure.

35:39.892 --> 35:40.732
Welcome to the show.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.974
This is GigaOM Biological, where biology is the way

35:45.195 --> 35:52.963
And we usually do a journal club for GigaOM Biological's New Biology 101 because that's the only work I'm doing right now.

35:52.983 --> 35:53.864
I'm just trying to read.

35:53.964 --> 35:54.325
I can't...

35:55.635 --> 35:58.918
I can't really teach this stuff until I've read a few more books.

35:59.118 --> 36:06.784
And that sounds silly, but actually there are so many books that need to be read again and reassessed.

36:07.304 --> 36:16.612
Because essentially what they've done is they've taken modern virology and written a bunch of books, which are now in front of other books on the bookshelf.

36:16.672 --> 36:24.298
So that when you pull down some books about microbiology, you're actually pulling down some books called virology and you get a whole nother story

36:24.898 --> 36:38.184
which kind of omits this huge part of our biology, which is actually the bacteria and their phages in the background.

36:38.224 --> 36:42.346
That's what I think is really up to here, what's going on.

36:44.454 --> 36:45.334
It's for all the marbles.

36:45.394 --> 36:46.635
It's for the grandchildren of Earth.

36:46.675 --> 36:51.317
That's why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America and why we've had one for a very long time.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.038
I think we have to seek the truth together.

36:53.218 --> 36:54.939
That's what that phrase means up there.

36:55.759 --> 37:02.983
I think the way that we seek the truth together is first try to come to understand what this bad biology is and how

37:03.843 --> 37:06.584
how deceptive it can be if it's applied correctly.

37:06.644 --> 37:08.384
And it's just a language trap, right?

37:08.424 --> 37:17.427
It's just the use of these terms with a lot of confidence and a lot of certainty and reinforcing assumptions that have never actually been proven through experiment.

37:17.867 --> 37:30.830
And that's where we are with evolution because DNA, you know, even Darwin wouldn't be where we are right now, despite the discovery of DNA, unless it wasn't for all the insistence of all these people around.

37:31.363 --> 37:35.086
that this is essentially where we are and everything's done, we've learned something, right?

37:35.526 --> 37:41.370
The Human Genome Project is done in 2000, and now it's on to the human genome business, right?

37:41.430 --> 37:43.792
And that's really the illusion here.

37:46.477 --> 38:03.661
And I think it is really about understanding how this background has been misconstrued as a coronavirus when it's much more likely that this is a irreducibly complex background of DNA signals that have been misconstrued with nonspecific PCR tests.

38:04.241 --> 38:07.842
A way to challenge anybody on that is just to say, wait, RNA cannot pandemic.

38:07.862 --> 38:10.343
It doesn't have any of the magical qualities of DNA.

38:11.539 --> 38:15.801
that enabled evolution that make inheritance so powerful?

38:16.141 --> 38:29.146
How the hell can you say that RNA pandemic can do all of those things when it doesn't have any of the magical qualities of the DNA molecule that supposedly describes evolution or makes evolution possible?

38:30.472 --> 38:33.614
And so that lie has been told for five years straight.

38:33.754 --> 38:40.078
And there have been some very specific people in place to curate that narrative, to make sure that nobody gets too far off of that narrative.

38:40.719 --> 38:56.029
And incidentally, you know, talking about COVID shots, but not talking about 2020 is basically how they do it because none of these people who are making any useful contributions to understanding our way out and haven't up until 2025, really.

38:58.979 --> 39:11.870
And so the best way to explain this to your family and friends about the nonspecific PCR tests is that using their tests to find their ghosts does not make their ghosts real, nor make you a ghostbuster.

39:13.871 --> 39:19.076
And yet all of these people, Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, you know, Ryan Cole,

39:20.097 --> 39:22.759
Peter McCullough, Jessica Rose, none of them.

39:22.919 --> 39:36.126
And perhaps the best one being Kevin McKernan, who was on podcast after podcast in 2020 talking about PCR and how useful it is or might not be and can be, but certainly we can use it to find the novel virus.

39:36.167 --> 39:39.328
It just might've been around a little longer because we haven't been testing.

39:40.789 --> 39:43.711
But his assumptions are that yes, the tests work.

39:43.911 --> 39:45.132
Yes, the ghosts are real.

39:45.432 --> 39:48.694
And yes, you can be a ghostbuster if you start a testing company.

39:50.819 --> 40:04.187
And so if you see that as the primary illusion that none of these people challenged until it was time to say the COVID shots were bad, and then they said the COVID shots were bad, they sustained this illusion.

40:05.205 --> 40:12.971
And there were more than 220 EUA granted products in America for the first two and a half years that allowed this illusion to be created.

40:13.051 --> 40:28.042
And none of these people provided any useful scrutiny of those products, which are now essentially godfathered into approval and being used all across America and around the world as standard diagnostics.

40:29.923 --> 40:32.445
This is very, very bad.

40:36.383 --> 40:40.867
And so I've always tried to put this slide up here, remind you again that we can say it in one slide.

40:40.927 --> 40:53.859
It's very important that when people are saying that Jay's got, I don't know, some problem or he's always mean to everybody, it doesn't really matter anymore who I'm mean to or who I was mean to.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.541
There's a way out and it's very simple.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.325
These ideas are very simple and I don't need my name on them.

41:00.505 --> 41:02.407
We just have to start fighting the real

41:03.635 --> 41:05.796
the real battle, asking the real question.

41:06.276 --> 41:08.978
Is intramuscular injection indeed dumb?

41:09.478 --> 41:10.899
Can, really, RNA?

41:10.979 --> 41:11.900
Cannot, pandemic?

41:11.940 --> 41:12.920
Are we sure about that?

41:12.980 --> 41:17.243
Because if that's true, that might be one of the most important things we teach our kids.

41:17.903 --> 41:24.066
If intramuscular injection is really dumb, maybe that's a phrase that can wake up some doctors who are willing to read.

41:25.507 --> 41:32.071
If transfection is really what it was called back in when Brian Hooker was working for a national institute.

41:32.992 --> 41:41.020
If it was called transformation for years before the pandemic, then indeed, transfecting healthy people is a crime.

41:41.361 --> 41:44.063
And I think Jesse Gelsinger's dad would say so too.

41:44.464 --> 41:55.235
The population pyramid is a problem, and I fear that they have created a mythology in order to have the excuse to continue to manage it.

41:57.312 --> 42:01.214
And the only reason why they've gotten this far is because of placebos, ladies and gentlemen.

42:01.334 --> 42:07.016
Placebos for the COVID shot and probably for a lot of the childhood vaccine schedule in America.

42:10.297 --> 42:11.938
And so how have they gotten away with it?

42:11.958 --> 42:21.882
Well, they've gotten away with it by the overclass, the people that don't care about money because they have so much of it, have put people in place to have arguments that don't get us out.

42:22.813 --> 42:49.659
People like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are the front-facing people of this group of meddlers, this group of weaponized piles of money that have put people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Del Bigtree and all of these people in place to control this populist movement, this health freedom movement that would be skeptical of

42:51.679 --> 43:10.419
electromagnetic radiation and would be skeptical of food dyes and skeptical of processed foods and skeptical of of glyphosate and skeptical of autism and skeptical of what autism is and how to call it that and all of this stuff was rolled up into one political bullshit show

43:11.516 --> 43:14.318
by acolytes which were placed on social media.

43:14.378 --> 43:23.643
This would have never been possible without our active engagement in social media, thinking that on X, that the truth was available.

43:23.703 --> 43:29.246
Kevin McKernan was on podcasts in 2020 saying that the truth was available on X.

43:29.986 --> 43:42.336
Then Elon Musk bought X, and the Health and Human Services Secretary said on Dr. Phil's show not a few days ago that Elon Musk saved free speech in America.

43:45.679 --> 43:58.389
And so they can trick us into believing anything they want about Israel and Gaza, anything they want about Libya, anything that they want about the Euro, anything they want about immigration, and anything that they want about a novel virus.

43:59.366 --> 44:00.967
And that's exactly what they did.

44:03.128 --> 44:08.210
And now they have people in place that are there to make sure that the clock runs out on this murder.

44:09.251 --> 44:11.592
This very clear signal of murder.

44:14.854 --> 44:19.356
Because we lost control of pneumonia.

44:19.556 --> 44:21.257
We had control of for years.

44:21.297 --> 44:25.139
We lost control of it and then suddenly we gained control of it again in 2020.

44:25.359 --> 44:27.800
That's not by accident, that's murder.

44:28.783 --> 44:31.484
that's managing the population pyramid problem.

44:34.064 --> 44:44.667
And the really cruel thing about it is, is that at the end of this, the one thing that escaped scrutiny was the use of PCR as a diagnostic.

44:44.707 --> 44:53.509
And so now PCR can be used to find measles, antibodies can be used to describe whether or not you need a booster for your measles vaccine.

44:54.773 --> 45:04.939
And so they are now encouraging people on the left to go ahead and get a lateral flow test or some other kind of blood test to see if your measles, you know, titer is high enough.

45:05.960 --> 45:06.701
I shit you not.

45:09.722 --> 45:18.988
And all of these remnants are the perfect data set for what the Human Genome Project already knew a long time ago they would need.

45:19.068 --> 45:21.350
Samples, multiple samples from everybody.

45:23.083 --> 45:30.806
And it's going on right now without the scrutiny of the FDA, which probably should have looked at each test as an individual medical device.

45:30.866 --> 45:42.269
But instead, all of these tests are just being, the market is flooded with tests that are just assumed to work because PCR has been established as a diagnostic.

45:42.409 --> 45:46.831
And soon, transfection will be established as a medicine.

45:48.936 --> 45:51.438
they'll still call it vaccine, next generation vaccine.

45:51.538 --> 45:58.803
And this is all accomplished by this team worst case scenario that pretended they had something to say for five years, but did not.

45:58.903 --> 46:16.376
And it includes the fake anti-vax movement, but it also includes their bizarro group reflection in the no virus people, like Tom Cowan with a book and Andy Kaufman and the Baileys.

46:19.167 --> 46:26.911
Now, I know this is hard to take, but I want you to listen very carefully because this is the best illustration that I have of it.

46:26.971 --> 46:28.892
They created an illusion of consensus.

46:28.972 --> 46:39.777
It started with ICANN, expanded to Children's Health Defense, and then during the pandemic, he just had this explosion of organizations here, right?

46:39.818 --> 46:45.040
This is an explosion of organizations that are all health freedom oriented.

46:45.080 --> 46:46.521
They all retweet each other.

46:46.981 --> 46:53.784
And a lot of these players are being supported by, are fellows by, or are founding members of multiple of these organizations.

46:56.806 --> 47:01.368
How many people are on the Brownstone list that are also at the International COVID Summits?

47:02.228 --> 47:08.731
How many people are on the Brownstone list that are also FLCCC or Independent Medical Alliance fellows?

47:09.991 --> 47:13.433
How many people are on Brownstone and also on the Wellness Company?

47:15.612 --> 47:26.497
And how many of all of these people have been on a CHD podcast or an ICANN podcast, but never been able to describe the difference between injection and ingestion?

47:28.619 --> 47:37.123
Never acknowledging that I kind of got there independently of Brandy Vaughn, but then Brandy Vaughn, who all of these people have known, made movies with,

47:38.277 --> 47:48.184
was so good at saying there's a big difference between injection versus ingestion and tried to say the same thing that I was saying with intramuscular injection is dumb.

47:51.006 --> 47:58.751
Listen to Brian Hooker in 2013 tell the story of what happened to his son.

48:00.112 --> 48:04.635
I was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine

48:05.120 --> 48:07.741
that he received that could have thimerosal.

48:07.781 --> 48:15.263
Thimerosal is the mercury-containing organic preservative that they used in vaccines and still use in some instances.

48:15.663 --> 48:20.585
But he had a very, very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines.

48:21.245 --> 48:25.787
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months.

48:27.197 --> 48:32.060
and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.741
I don't like the word autism.

48:34.642 --> 48:35.722
He was vaccine damaged.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.486
I will not use the word autism.

48:42.526 --> 48:44.007
We don't like the word autism.

48:45.388 --> 48:46.809
He was vaccine damaged.

48:51.431 --> 48:52.272
Let me hear that again.

48:53.673 --> 48:53.893
He was

48:59.384 --> 49:19.783
was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine that he received that could have thimerosal, thimerosal is the mercury containing organic preservative that they used in vaccines and still use in some instances, but he had a very, very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines.

49:20.463 --> 49:24.967
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months.

49:26.395 --> 49:31.219
and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

49:31.379 --> 49:32.920
I don't like the word autism.

49:33.821 --> 49:34.842
He was vaccine damaged.

49:35.222 --> 49:45.410
He was neurologically damaged and he's still suffering with many of the effects of that initial damage done at 15 months.

49:45.650 --> 49:51.635
And he regressed rather quickly into neurological difficulties.

49:51.695 --> 49:52.476
He lost language.

49:53.400 --> 50:16.916
um and uh was uh we we lost eye contact he was staring at lights things like that and and uh within um you know within weeks of uh the um initial vaccinations he got five vaccines while he had an active ear infection which is a big no-no it's contraindicated if even if you look at the packet insert

50:18.575 --> 50:29.823
But within weeks we saw profound regression and it continued in a downward cycle until he was about two years old and then it started to stabilize at that point.

50:30.063 --> 50:37.668
OK, and you as a parent, there's not a single doubt in your mind about the connection between the vaccinations and the subsequent regression.

50:38.029 --> 50:38.729
No, not at all.

50:40.050 --> 50:40.370
It was.

50:40.591 --> 50:43.773
It was apparent at the time that he received the vaccines.

50:44.794 --> 50:47.756
and it was then pointed out.

50:48.477 --> 51:02.627
I didn't even know that the vaccinations that he received contained mercury until we had the fortunate experience of working with a specialist who was a part of the Defeat Autism Now movement when my son was about 30 months old.

51:03.620 --> 51:13.487
But that physician alerted us, who became essentially my son's primary doctor at that point, that Tamarazol was in the vaccines.

51:13.567 --> 51:20.471
And we did the calculation, and I was astounded by the amount of mercury that my son received in the vaccines.

51:21.292 --> 51:29.717
Not only that, but as my knowledge has grown, I'm astounded, and I continue to be astounded by the

51:32.771 --> 51:40.198
poor design of these particular therapeutics and the poor rationale for vaccinating in the first place.

51:41.539 --> 51:41.919
Gotcha.

51:43.821 --> 51:47.524
And the poor rationale for vaccinating in the first place.

51:47.584 --> 51:51.127
Sounds like he's really close to this.

51:51.247 --> 51:55.591
In 2013, when he doesn't use the word autism, he doesn't like the word autism.

51:58.450 --> 52:03.134
I want you to feel it here because he uses the word autism now.

52:04.575 --> 52:11.681
Autism has many different levels now.

52:11.821 --> 52:21.949
In 2013, after 17 years of experience trying to genetically modify plants to make medicines, biotech expert Brian Hooker

52:23.442 --> 52:29.245
has a vaccine damaged child that he will not use the word autism to describe in 2013.

52:30.846 --> 52:34.809
In 2020, he has a kid who has autism.

52:40.172 --> 52:50.118
Now, I don't know if Brian is already on a narrative here where he's convinced it's mercury and unaware that there were a lot of other things in those vaccines that you shouldn't just write off.

52:53.706 --> 53:01.111
Brian, sorry, Brett Weinstein and his wife are now trying to slowly give it, they're slowly being given a script about excipients now.

53:01.171 --> 53:02.992
Yesterday they were talking about excipients.

53:03.412 --> 53:08.055
They almost got to the point where they were trying to differentiate between injection versus ingestion.

53:08.536 --> 53:21.304
But I think these people are just so, so sold out to this narrative and so sold out to the provided script or sold out to whatever they thought they knew.

53:22.759 --> 53:24.360
that they can't get here.

53:24.620 --> 53:25.941
They're not supposed to get here.

53:26.001 --> 53:27.062
They will never get here.

53:27.943 --> 53:32.566
And any use of these words is used in an incorrect way.

53:33.086 --> 53:39.631
And if you don't see how impossible it is that somebody like Brian Hooker in 2013 could be there, and now in 2025,

53:44.821 --> 53:56.732
is trying to advocate for the organization of a big top tent of health freedom with slogans like rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

53:58.914 --> 54:00.375
I don't know if I can help you anymore.

54:01.556 --> 54:07.302
If you can't see that Del Bigtree has made no progress

54:08.789 --> 54:25.038
in terms of prioritizing his messaging, prioritizing the understanding of things in the same way that I've tried to do, which is once I figured out that RNA cannot pandemic is an unchallengeable proposition, I started to say it every day.

54:26.337 --> 54:32.981
Once I figured out that intramuscular injection is dumb, is a proposition that nobody was gonna challenge, I started saying it every day.

54:33.622 --> 54:42.487
Once Brandy Vaughn figured out that there's a big difference biologically between injecting something and ingesting something, she started to teach that regularly.

54:44.229 --> 54:54.095
But Brian Hooker, his progression can be charted by, at one point, being a biotech expert with 17 years experience working for a national institute.

54:56.059 --> 55:23.451
transforming and transfecting plants to express and make medicines, would not use the word autism to describe his vaccine-injured son, his now and did talk about asymptomatic spread of COVID, the insufficiently tested COVID vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and a big top tent of health freedom behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:25.566 --> 55:27.088
I need your help, ladies and gentlemen.

55:27.128 --> 55:28.550
America is under attack.

55:28.590 --> 55:40.144
We are being undermined on all sides by people on a malevolent script that is designed to pit Americans against each other on preposterous ideas.

55:43.240 --> 55:55.552
And instead, I think we need to come together and as we realize that these people have overplayed their hand and they've revealed themselves for what they are, because there's no explanation for not getting here after 10 years of fighting or 20 years of fighting.

55:56.173 --> 56:05.482
There's no explanation for not realizing this is a signal, a very, very bright, there's me and me, there's a very bright signal here.

56:09.028 --> 56:13.030
And it only took a little murder in lies, not a lot, just a few thousand.

56:14.191 --> 56:18.633
The rest was already built in to the expected rise in all cause mortality.

56:18.673 --> 56:22.516
The excess number of old people in Scotland was a beautiful example of that.

56:22.576 --> 56:24.397
They murdered people in mass there.

56:25.837 --> 56:27.738
And now immigration's off the chart, of course.

56:28.059 --> 56:30.360
You know, we got to replace the bottom half of the pyramid.

56:34.619 --> 56:39.460
There's no explanation for everybody ignoring this except for that they are on a paid script.

56:41.141 --> 56:44.442
Sam Bailey and Mark Bailey should not be ignoring this slide.

56:45.622 --> 56:56.946
If murder in America was enough to pull off the stunt that happened in New Zealand and got so many New Zealanders to take the transfection, it was murder in America that allowed that to happen.

56:57.306 --> 57:01.267
The same thing in Australia where supposedly Jikki Leaks has been fighting.

57:01.647 --> 57:17.593
The anticipated rise in expected death in America, sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies, including the opioid pandemic, was used to justify the lockdowns around the world, used to justify the mandates of vaccines around the world.

57:19.254 --> 57:26.757
And if it can be explained by an anticipated rise that was used by these traitors, then why aren't any of these people saying it?

57:28.507 --> 57:30.068
because it applies to them too.

57:30.908 --> 57:33.629
The tragedy in New Zealand was only possible.

57:34.089 --> 57:45.294
The Jacinda Ardern show was only possible because they were murdering people in America and murdering people in Scotland and lying about what was happening.

57:49.836 --> 57:53.758
And I do, I am very, very scared of where we are because of who brought us here.

57:54.824 --> 57:58.567
People like Steve Bannon, who brought us Li Min Yan.

58:00.309 --> 58:06.334
People like, like, like Stephen Hatfield, and brought us the lab leak idea in January of 2020.

58:09.377 --> 58:14.342
And soon after came this guy with his bandana and woodshop goggles.

58:16.840 --> 58:28.226
This guy with his history that goes to Hatfill and Callahan and Huff and Rose and Corey and McCullough and Cole and Lee Minyan and Merrill Nass and CHD and Skyhorse Publishing.

58:31.027 --> 58:33.929
This guy who's attached to the FDA by his dad.

58:34.549 --> 58:37.971
This guy who's attached to the FDA by his dad who's still alive.

58:41.223 --> 58:47.045
whose son is attached to Peter Thiel and Elon Musk by some kind of something, something, Palantir, something.

58:49.005 --> 58:50.506
Thiel Capital, I don't know.

58:51.026 --> 59:03.970
And then this guy, the Human Genome Project dude, who spent a couple years slandering me on X, writing a few substacks, calling me chemtrail retarded.

59:04.010 --> 59:09.472
This guy, the former Human Genome Project guy that's now saying there's DNA in the shot.

59:10.236 --> 59:25.803
but knew all along that the RNA would never be made pure, knew all along that the endotoxins could never be removed, and knew exactly the process that couldn't be used to do it that would normally be used on any protein biologic, and that would be anion exchange chromatography.

59:25.843 --> 59:38.629
This guy with patents coming out of his brain, you know, coming out of his ears, who's sold more companies than I've worked for, whose father was into microarray technology,

59:39.397 --> 59:48.361
whose brothers are curing cancer, who said that the FDA was annoying in 2020 and that the EUAs are 10 pages of hassle.

59:52.343 --> 59:55.524
Those people are all behind our Health and Human Services Secretary.

59:55.544 --> 59:57.925
Those people are all behind the head of the NIH.

01:00:00.106 --> 01:00:05.869
And so either these people are going to be doing some of the things that these people want done,

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:16.962
or these people helped him get where he is and now he's just like I described Jay Bhattacharya as the mouse at Chuck E. Cheese's.

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:20.905
He's not, they don't have any meaningful role in the business.

01:00:24.307 --> 01:00:25.588
But I don't think that's the case.

01:00:25.648 --> 01:00:32.874
I think there's some weird struggles still going on in the background and I guess I'm never gonna know.

01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:37.113
But I do know that these people are not working as patriots.

01:00:37.173 --> 01:00:39.495
They're not working for our grandchildren's future.

01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:43.437
They're not trying to plant trees under whose shade they will not shelter.

01:00:43.497 --> 01:00:45.319
They are working for the slavers.

01:00:45.819 --> 01:00:49.101
This guy has ties directly to the Human Genome Project.

01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:54.384
This guy goes all the way back to HIV, Ebola, Zika, the WHO, Gavi, and the Vatican.

01:00:55.565 --> 01:00:58.867
He organized all six COVID international summits.

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:02.710
He toured around

01:01:03.263 --> 01:01:14.702
churches in 2020 and 2021 with Ryan Cole and Li Min Yan, the one that Steve Bannon hugged on stage in 2020.

01:01:21.738 --> 01:01:27.582
When Secretary Kennedy asked me to answer the question, what is causing the rise in autism?

01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:32.105
It's actually surprising how much can they get.

01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:44.393
From the perspective of the other side in America, Jayanta Bhattacharya talking in front of a White House screen with Dr. Drew is like a capital...

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:53.604
It's a, wow, are the people in the Republican party so dumb?

01:01:54.385 --> 01:01:55.285
That's what they think.

01:01:56.406 --> 01:02:06.613
And more importantly, the words that Jayanta Bhattacharya says in this interview will make those people think what in the hell is going on?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.936
This is an obvious bullshitter.

01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:17.779
independent research program where the nation's scientists can bid for funding to study the problem.

01:02:17.799 --> 01:02:21.441
We'll give data available to them so that they can analyze.

01:02:21.461 --> 01:02:25.983
They're going to bid for funding and then they're going to get data from the government to analyze.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.444
That's exactly what he's saying.

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:35.952
the links of autism with environmental exposure, diet.

01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:49.436
Remember, Brian Hooker of 2013 with 17 years experience transforming and transfecting plants does not use the word autism, doesn't like the word autism because his son is vaccine neurologically damaged.

01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:55.138
And those are real parents.

01:02:56.906 --> 01:03:00.450
The trouble is, is that there are a lot of less damaged people.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.975
And then there are a lot of people who have been led to believe that they fit into this category when they don't.

01:03:09.058 --> 01:03:19.109
And that now we're supposed to make some distinction between the people who show real bad symptoms after getting hit in the head with a baseball bat and some people that are still able to do math.

01:03:21.223 --> 01:03:26.245
And if you got hit in the head five times in one day, it's a lot more likely that you're gonna show severe symptoms.

01:03:26.285 --> 01:03:26.965
That's true too.

01:03:28.086 --> 01:03:35.108
But I'm not sure any of those observations have anything to do with the benefits of getting hit with a bat in the head.

01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:49.274
And so we have now in place a couple people who are willing to attribute a variety of environmental and genetic causes

01:03:50.131 --> 01:04:07.204
to the damage that can be done to a child by the world, by nature, and ignore the fact that the vaccine schedule is essentially equivalent to hitting children in the head with a bat.

01:04:09.226 --> 01:04:14.610
That's what these people are in place to do, to make sure that no one is explaining this.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:19.814
No one actually realizes that this is an argument about nothing.

01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:26.462
You are trying to decide whether it should be an aluminum baseball bat or a major league wood bat.

01:04:27.003 --> 01:04:28.843
Whether you're allowed to cork the bat or not.

01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:32.704
Whether there should be a bat donut weight on the bat or not.

01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:36.065
It should be a 34 inch bat.

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:39.026
Should you wear batting gloves when you do it?

01:04:40.446 --> 01:04:47.448
Maybe if you had a nurse on either side of the kid and hit on either side of the head instead of hitting twice on the same side, maybe that'll solve the problem.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:05:07.345
And if you put yourself into the mindset where intramuscular injection is dumb, just like hitting your kid in the head with a baseball bat is dumb, and then you realize that, well, you could argue that it might be less dumb if you hit him in the occipital lobe, because the temporal lobe is really soft.

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.227
So you definitely wouldn't want to hit him above the ear.

01:05:10.287 --> 01:05:11.268
That would be really bad.

01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:19.690
And if you have to hit him more than once in the same day, then maybe you can hit him just in the back corner here and then in the back corner there.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:21.291
Those are really hard round parts.

01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:26.295
It's almost like arguing that, you know what we're going to do?

01:05:26.335 --> 01:05:35.482
We're going to fracture your kid's skull repeatedly during childhood so that he doesn't have to wear a bicycle helmet or a motorcycle helmet when he's older.

01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:42.160
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:53.447
And it is very frightening because not only is this guy on Dr. Drew, but we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:53.507 --> 01:05:55.668
doing a show with Dr. Phil.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:56.369
Now, why?

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.051
Is he can't get on Fox News?

01:06:00.051 --> 01:06:01.332
He can't get on NBC?

01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:02.693
He couldn't get on The View?

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.896
Why is he, what is going on?

01:06:08.578 --> 01:06:11.200
and ask yourself the same question, what's going on here?

01:06:14.623 --> 01:06:15.204
What is this?

01:06:15.424 --> 01:06:19.607
At night these days, top of the list, the health of our loved ones.

01:06:20.328 --> 01:06:29.115
So it's only fitting that Sambrosa Night Syrups has stepped up to sponsor tonight's Dr. Phil primetime special, RFK Jr.

01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:30.336
The First 100 Days.

01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:38.546
From day one, Sambroza has been a massive supporter of the- So he's going to do a commercial here.

01:06:38.606 --> 01:06:40.367
So I'll break into this for a second.

01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:42.708
Remember Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:42.968 --> 01:06:47.551
is the guy who promotes Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy.

01:06:48.031 --> 01:06:57.397
Remember that Pauly Tommy in 1999 said that a wonder drug called secretin had cured her boy, Billy.

01:07:00.051 --> 01:07:00.952
within days.

01:07:01.753 --> 01:07:06.299
I thought we might get to the stage where the improvement stopped or suddenly went back to where he was before.

01:07:06.819 --> 01:07:12.446
Polly tells ITV Tonight with Trevor McDonald, but we are making more and more progress.

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:14.629
At one time, we were worried about Billy's education.

01:07:14.689 --> 01:07:19.395
Now, we are told he can start the mainstream school in September.

01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:30.659
To prove that Secretin was responsible for Billy's improvement, the Tommies withheld the monthly injection, and within days, he deteriorated but improved again once the treatment was restored.

01:07:30.719 --> 01:07:32.580
That convinced us, said Polly.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:41.585
Now a really interesting twist to this story is, ow, shit.

01:07:42.886 --> 01:07:45.928
I pulled out the plug again, that hurts, ow.

01:07:48.413 --> 01:07:53.858
I forget, I'm using a different wire now, and so, ow, I just pulled the plug out of my ears there.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:07.912
In 2008, which by my math is about nine years after Polly Tommy cured her boy with secretin thanks to Andrew Wakefield, in 2008,

01:08:12.992 --> 01:08:22.937
Some lady named Jenny McCarthy is on the front cover of Us Weekly, and it seems like she has also saved her son.

01:08:25.658 --> 01:08:28.079
Her son Evan recovered from autism.

01:08:28.679 --> 01:08:30.360
How I saved my son.

01:08:33.348 --> 01:08:40.093
So I'm confused as to whether or not Polly actually had any luck curing her son.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:48.599
I'm a little confused as to what's going on, but I do know for sure that Brian Hooker in 2013 would not use the word autism.

01:08:50.141 --> 01:08:51.742
I know for sure he uses it now.

01:08:53.023 --> 01:09:00.648
I know for sure that this lady is in Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2 and hasn't made much progress since she cured her son.

01:09:00.728 --> 01:09:02.550
She hasn't cured anybody else that I know of.

01:09:03.464 --> 01:09:06.727
Jenny McCarthy has just recently been on a bunch of programs.

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:16.016
Dr. Drew said in that interview with Jay Bhattacharya that he was going to talk to Jenny McCarthy and he was going to apologize to her because he used to be skeptical.

01:09:18.137 --> 01:09:19.198
But she cured her son.

01:09:20.079 --> 01:09:21.220
Polly cured her son.

01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:24.503
Why aren't all these cures spreading around?

01:09:25.484 --> 01:09:26.245
What's going on?

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:37.155
has been anything but conventional.

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:44.085
He's faced criticism and controversy, yet remained steadfast in his mission

01:09:52.253 --> 01:09:59.739
Tonight, a candid, no-holds-barred conversation about the first 100 days of this administration.

01:10:00.539 --> 01:10:04.102
And this isn't just about me talking to Secretary Kennedy.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.605
It's about him engaging with all of you here.

01:10:08.546 --> 01:10:14.390
This is your town hall, and I'm bringing your questions, your concerns into the conversation.

01:10:15.671 --> 01:10:18.353
But without... Yes, the rest of the world sees this.

01:10:18.573 --> 01:10:21.856
And yes, the rest of the world is saddened

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:28.829
Yes, the rest of the world sees this, and yes, the rest of the world is saddened.

01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:31.711
Do not doubt for one minute that that's not part of this.

01:10:32.912 --> 01:10:42.059
They do not want the rest of the world to see America as anything like what it was when the Dream Team went to Barcelona in 1992.

01:10:42.419 --> 01:10:49.785
They don't want you to think of America when we won the gold medal in hockey,

01:10:50.523 --> 01:10:55.846
They don't want you to think of America in World War II coming to the rescue of Europe or something like that.

01:10:55.906 --> 01:10:58.788
None of these ideas, they're all gone.

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:04.291
And that's on purpose.

01:11:05.992 --> 01:11:10.755
You are witnessing the controlled demolition of America and the only people who can stop it are in America.

01:11:10.815 --> 01:11:18.500
We must disengage from their social media, disengage from their mainstream media and organize local communities

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:25.483
and promote local and independent journalists, if you will.

01:11:25.603 --> 01:11:29.344
I don't know if I'm a journalist yet, but I am definitely a biology coach.

01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:34.346
Yes, I'm a journalist for purposes of FOIA so that I don't have to pay, but I haven't sent any FOIAs yet.

01:11:34.966 --> 01:11:37.027
I'm waiting for the FOIA offices to open.

01:11:38.688 --> 01:11:39.989
See, isn't that unfortunate?

01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:45.571
They said they were gonna be super transparent, but you can't even write a FOIA right now because those offices are closed.

01:11:47.056 --> 01:11:53.880
It's not like I can FOIA, you know, for, for, for information about the COVID vaccines or anything like that.

01:11:57.102 --> 01:11:58.382
And is that accidental?

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:08.708
While Jay Bhattacharya is talking about how, how the, the NIH is going to publish all papers immediately before they're published by journals like that matters.

01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:25.091
If it's bullshit science based on bullshit p-values, based on bullshit assumptions or bullshit models of disease, then who cares if you publish them now or when they get put into a journal and charged money?

01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:25.791
Who cares?

01:12:29.334 --> 01:12:30.355
This is gonna hurt.

01:12:32.136 --> 01:12:33.918
Because as an American, it hurt me.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.219
I don't know how we got here.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.721
Well, I do know how we got here.

01:12:40.894 --> 01:12:44.277
I was in the car with you, but it's remarkable where we are.

01:12:45.198 --> 01:12:58.029
This is the Health and Human Services Secretary of America, a guy who claimed to have cracked the code with the help of Heather Frazier in 2017.

01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:15.464
Without further ado, everyone please welcome my good friend, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:57.978 --> 01:13:59.898
Well, what am I, chopped liver?

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:04.059
You don't act that way when I come out all the time.

01:14:05.179 --> 01:14:06.920
You got some fans in the house, I think.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:14.241
Thank you.

01:14:14.281 --> 01:14:15.502
Listen, thank you for being here.

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:16.402
It's good to see you.

01:14:16.422 --> 01:14:18.542
We haven't seen each other for at least weeks.

01:14:20.402 --> 01:14:21.703
So you've been really busy.

01:14:22.663 --> 01:14:23.163
I have been.

01:14:23.203 --> 01:14:27.124
And thank you for all your support during the campaign and ever since.

01:14:29.187 --> 01:14:37.095
I think done more than any other media figure in helping to drive, to tell people about the movement, and to encourage people, and to drive it.

01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:40.979
I bet Steve Bannon did a lot more than him, but OK, whatever.

01:14:41.299 --> 01:14:44.202
Well, I'm a strong believer in what you're doing.

01:14:45.402 --> 01:14:51.204
Uh, you know, people ask me about that and they asked me what the audio is really bad.

01:14:51.304 --> 01:14:52.305
Like it's echoey.

01:14:52.345 --> 01:14:55.066
I don't know what he's got going there, what you're really like.

01:14:55.826 --> 01:15:04.650
And they say, does he, does he believe everything that he says, uh, is he as committed as he says, or is this all political rhetoric?

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:12.033
And yeah, I can honestly tell people having gotten to know you and spent the time that we have together.

01:15:12.697 --> 01:15:15.838
that not one bit of it is political rhetoric.

01:15:16.738 --> 01:15:29.702
It would be so much easier on you if you were talking politics, but these are things that you are seriously committed to and have been for a long, long time.

01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:32.283
You're not a- There's a little question in the chat.

01:15:33.323 --> 01:15:34.763
I don't know if I put it up here or not.

01:15:34.803 --> 01:15:35.384
Yeah, I can.

01:15:38.137 --> 01:15:42.620
Can anyone explain why RNA can't pandemic?

01:15:44.341 --> 01:15:46.583
I try to explain that every day and I did earlier.

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:52.187
I'm just going to give you that just because it's in the chat and I'll say it right here.

01:15:53.748 --> 01:16:01.553
RNA cannot pandemic because it doesn't have any of the biological magic qualities of DNA.

01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:07.698
One of the most important things to understand about bad biology 101, the biology

01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:29.957
that is taught in Campbell Biology and all the people that are taking biology in high school and in their freshman year of college are learning from a book like this, are learning that DNA, because of its unique chemical structure, is a redundant copy of a code.

01:16:31.097 --> 01:16:34.518
And that redundancy gives it a chemical stability

01:16:35.942 --> 01:16:43.052
and a informational storage fidelity that doesn't exist anywhere else in nature.

01:16:43.993 --> 01:16:44.654
It's magical.

01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:50.162
It's the reason why heredity happens, and it's the reason why evolution occurred.

01:16:50.302 --> 01:16:52.605
That's the whole argument of Biology 101.

01:16:53.889 --> 01:16:57.772
And RNA has none of those qualities.

01:16:57.852 --> 01:17:01.835
It doesn't have the information storage duplicity.

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:03.376
It does not have the

01:17:06.886 --> 01:17:29.021
high fidelity copying capability and it doesn't have this chemical stability because rather than being a double helix where there are no waiting bonds, no exposed bonds to be reacted with, you have a half of that where all of those are potentially reactive species with the environment.

01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:42.272
It is a very, very terrible illusion that is so bad and only sustained because people just insist that that assumption must be accepted.

01:17:42.753 --> 01:17:50.379
Because we gave a Nobel Prize to David Baltimore for reverse transcriptase and he says that the Baltimore scheme is the shit.

01:17:51.206 --> 01:18:06.070
But the Baltimore scheme says that we're allowed to make DNA into RNA, into proteins, and that viruses can do all kinds of other things with single-stranded RNA of both types, with double-stranded DNA, with single-stranded DNA.

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:08.190
And these are all mythologies.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:18.733
These are all mythologies that don't take into account the existence of bacteria and phages, instead try to tell us a story about all this wizardry and nonsense.

01:18:19.949 --> 01:18:21.610
It has nothing to do with reality.

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:23.710
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:26.611
There is no biological basis for that idea.

01:18:26.691 --> 01:18:38.455
And pandemic being that you spill it in a mud puddle in Wuhan and it ends up in all the white-tailed deer and all the zoo animals and all the wherever else COVID spread in the first couple of years.

01:18:38.795 --> 01:18:39.475
It's impossible.

01:18:42.947 --> 01:18:49.913
Johnny, come lately to this wanting people to be healthy again and bringing health back to America.

01:18:49.953 --> 01:18:52.434
This is something you grew up believing.

01:18:52.495 --> 01:19:08.988
You were raised to believe that you really needed to be in the homes of average Americans, helping people get things that they didn't have access to, get to places they couldn't ordinarily get.

01:19:09.368 --> 01:19:10.689
That's the way you were raised.

01:19:10.989 --> 01:19:11.930
Is that a fair statement?

01:19:12.569 --> 01:19:19.032
That was a way, you know, I got, I was an environmental lawyer for 40 years doing advocacy.

01:19:20.553 --> 01:19:24.655
I started the biggest environmental group, clean water group in the world.

01:19:25.295 --> 01:19:29.817
And it's called Waterkeeper and it's still, you know, we're in 46 countries.

01:19:29.857 --> 01:19:37.241
We have 350 water keepers each with a patrol boat on a local waterway that soothes polluters.

01:19:38.499 --> 01:19:39.440
And that was my career.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:46.489
I got dragged kicking and screaming into this arena, which through the vaccine issue.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:50.634
In 2005, I published an article in Rolling Stone.

01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:58.374
on thimerosal, which is a mercury-based preservative that is used in vaccines.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:02.617
It was taken out of some children's vaccines in 2003.

01:20:03.998 --> 01:20:11.244
So it's interesting already, this timeline suggests that Bobby was talking about thimerosal as the cause of something.

01:20:13.269 --> 01:20:15.531
when he was already working on Mercury.

01:20:15.591 --> 01:20:28.162
And then when we heard Brian Hooker talking in 2013, he was also hyper-focused on the Mercury, even though we know from Brandy Vaughn and a lot of other people's work that there's a hell of a lot more in there than just Mercury.

01:20:30.054 --> 01:20:35.517
Same year, the CDC recommended the flu vaccine, which is loaded with mercury.

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:38.758
I really think that is the ultimate question walking right in.

01:20:38.778 --> 01:20:42.920
Well, how and why does that guy have time to appear on Dr. Phil?

01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:45.782
It is the exact same question that you should ask.

01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:54.326
Why is Jay Bhattacharya bringing Dr. Drew on a White House branded set?

01:20:55.134 --> 01:20:56.555
This is inexcusable.

01:20:57.096 --> 01:21:00.219
This is an embarrassment to America and it's on purpose.

01:21:00.259 --> 01:21:02.581
This script is very, very malevolent.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:04.642
We cannot tolerate it.

01:21:04.683 --> 01:21:05.944
We must see it for what it is.

01:21:08.806 --> 01:21:16.193
For pregnant women in any month of pregnancy, for children at six months and every year thereafter,

01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:18.525
And they're actually getting more.

01:21:18.685 --> 01:21:23.867
A kid today could get almost twice as much thiamerosal as children in 2003.

01:21:24.187 --> 01:21:25.428
So there was never any break.

01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:30.389
And it's a neurotoxin, a very potent neurotoxin.

01:21:30.529 --> 01:21:34.590
It's associated with all kinds of neurological and autoimmune illnesses in kids.

01:21:35.711 --> 01:21:39.352
I wrote an article about that, and it really changed the course of my life.

01:21:39.392 --> 01:21:41.032
It wasn't something that I chose to do.

01:21:43.286 --> 01:21:49.090
And it wasn't something that I chose to do.

01:21:50.812 --> 01:21:52.673
It's an interesting choice of words there.

01:21:52.713 --> 01:21:54.594
I don't really know what that means.

01:21:54.634 --> 01:21:55.215
What does that mean?

01:21:55.255 --> 01:21:56.716
They forced you to write the article?

01:21:56.736 --> 01:22:01.579
It was sort of a political choice for me.

01:22:01.599 --> 01:22:05.142
This was literally the worst career choice that I could have made.

01:22:07.162 --> 01:22:09.124
You know, I lost friends immediately.

01:22:09.144 --> 01:22:11.926
I lost a lot of family members.

01:22:12.026 --> 01:22:21.074
I lost a lot of my allies in the environmental movement, relationships that I'd built up, political allies that I'd built up for my whole life.

01:22:21.154 --> 01:22:28.540
And it's only, you know, but I kept working on the issue and it was only by hook and crook and divine providence that I ended up here.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.422
It certainly was not a plan.

01:22:31.164 --> 01:22:32.785
No, I know that it wasn't.

01:22:33.525 --> 01:22:45.790
But now, you've pushed back against authority in the United States, particularly authorities, particularly lately, with regard to health.

01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:47.691
You now are the health authority.

01:22:48.711 --> 01:22:58.976
in the United States, sitting atop the health and human services with 82,000 employees and a $1.7 trillion budget, which represents.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:04.078
And he's on Dr. Phil and he traveled to be in the studio.

01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:16.324
Nearly a third of the entire federal budget

01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:21.386
And he traveled to be on Dr. Phil.

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:33.774
I mean, do y'all realize, this is a third of the entire federal budget and 7% of the GDP.

01:23:35.656 --> 01:23:39.919
This agency is twice the size of the Pentagon, which is the next largest.

01:23:40.539 --> 01:23:45.863
Yeah, twice the size of the Pentagon, our defense budget,

01:23:46.941 --> 01:24:05.167
is dwarfed by it and this is something that is so staggering to me because we have the highest healthcare cost and the poorest healthcare delivery of the other 37 developed nations that it's compared to.

01:24:05.567 --> 01:24:06.728
You intend to change that.

01:24:08.053 --> 01:24:15.279
We spend two to three times what any other country in the world spends on health care, and we have the worst outcomes.

01:24:15.339 --> 01:24:19.042
We're literally the sickest people in the world.

01:24:19.663 --> 01:24:22.725
We have the highest chronic disease burden of any country in the world.

01:24:23.906 --> 01:24:28.510
During COVID, we had the highest death rate from COVID of any country in the world.

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:36.356
So we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in the United States, and we only have 4.2 percent of the world's population.

01:24:37.478 --> 01:24:47.309
So it's a mystery why people are getting awards and kudos and applause for managing COVID in this country, because we literally did worse than any country in the world.

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:52.094
Now, if you ask CDC, you know, why did we do so poorly?

01:24:52.114 --> 01:24:54.517
They say, well, it's not our fault.

01:24:54.817 --> 01:24:59.042
It's because Americans are so sick, which, by the way, is their fault.

01:25:00.217 --> 01:25:04.301
Um, but so he's right on right on narrative, right?

01:25:04.622 --> 01:25:06.443
There's no population pyramid.

01:25:06.484 --> 01:25:09.587
There was no anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:25:09.967 --> 01:25:13.711
There was no reason for concern that we were having an excess of old people.

01:25:15.495 --> 01:25:17.716
and COVID killed people, that none of this happened.

01:25:17.736 --> 01:25:24.460
There was no problem with a lack of antibiotic use or supplementary oxygen or ventilators, a poor use of PCR.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.102
There's no opioid epidemic at all.

01:25:28.842 --> 01:25:36.266
No death certificate fraud or financial incentives that might've been bad news or, you know, PCR is fine, lateral flow test.

01:25:36.306 --> 01:25:37.607
He's the head of the FDA.

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:49.162
He could direct the head of the FDA to retest the lateral flow test to go back through the 220 EUA granted tests to see if there was anything there worth looking at.

01:25:50.263 --> 01:25:52.886
He could reassess the opioid numbers.

01:25:53.786 --> 01:25:56.368
He could reassess the use of supplementary oxygen.

01:25:56.749 --> 01:26:00.312
And he could reassess the lack of antibiotic use to redo the numbers.

01:26:00.392 --> 01:26:04.856
But instead, he's accepting the numbers that he inherited from Fauci.

01:26:05.936 --> 01:26:10.859
He's accepting the numbers that he inherited from Azar or whoever the guy was that he's replacing.

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:14.102
See the malevolence here.

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.164
See the script reading here.

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:21.187
This is not an independent guy.

01:26:21.227 --> 01:26:24.929
This is a guy who auditioned and got the role.

01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:27.491
Maybe not the role that he wanted.

01:26:32.438 --> 01:26:39.680
Your body is a system, and when it's running right, you feel focused, energized, in flow, but sometimes we struggle to find that flow state.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.060
Why?

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.300
Because there's too much static.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:50.462
And so now... The echo flask clears the static by infusing your water with molecular hydrogen.

01:26:50.682 --> 01:26:51.963
Now he does a commercial?

01:26:52.663 --> 01:27:01.885
So we're doing commercials on podcasts using the Health and Human Services Secretary of America to sell supplements.

01:27:04.764 --> 01:27:05.584
Is that okay?

01:27:07.065 --> 01:27:13.247
Dr. Drew using the NIH director to sell supplements, is that okay?

01:27:14.367 --> 01:27:25.571
Because Dr. Drew and Dr. Phil are selling supplements using White House signage and the NIH director and the director of HHS.

01:27:26.252 --> 01:27:27.272
Enter code Phil to save,

01:27:30.518 --> 01:27:31.459
That's what's happening.

01:27:31.599 --> 01:27:36.361
Let's discuss preparedness because we know emergencies happen when we least expect them.

01:27:36.401 --> 01:27:39.563
But instead of just taking it, we can prepare.

01:27:39.763 --> 01:27:41.264
Let's discuss Jay's case.

01:27:41.784 --> 01:27:45.366
Jay's case sounds a lot like the wellness company.

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:50.589
We'll have emergency prescription medications on hand right when you need them.

01:27:50.749 --> 01:27:51.249
Think about it.

01:27:51.529 --> 01:27:58.213
Ever been caught off guard, whether it's a sudden illness or a travel hiccup, the right medications can make all the difference.

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.014
Jay's case is designed

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.717
to take that worry off your plate.

01:28:03.998 --> 01:28:11.783
So from the perspective of somebody who's skeptical of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this just confirms everything that David Frum said.

01:28:12.764 --> 01:28:16.627
This just confirms everything that all these crazy people on the left say.

01:28:18.908 --> 01:28:25.733
How can we get over this unless we are able to come together as a country and disengage from this theater?

01:28:26.514 --> 01:28:27.675
We will never escape.

01:28:29.298 --> 01:28:36.766
The CDC said the average American who died from COVID had 3.8 chronic diseases.

01:28:37.891 --> 01:28:47.198
And so they had obesity or diabetes or asthma and then one other thing or some other combination of chronic disease.

01:28:47.378 --> 01:29:02.148
So they would have been a terrible Medicare patient because they would have been a very expensive Medicare patient, especially in the last six months of their lives when all these chronic diseases would have needed a lot of treatment and keeping them alive would have been expensive.

01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:06.331
The population pyramid is a real problem.

01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:10.944
and our rulers are managing it with a mythology.

01:29:13.606 --> 01:29:20.751
It's an anticipated rise in the number of old people and the number of sick old people and the number of unhealthy Americans and they're managing the problem.

01:29:22.513 --> 01:29:25.215
And that's really what killed them.

01:29:26.035 --> 01:29:29.598
These were people who were so sick that they were basically hanging from a cliff.

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.061
and COVID came along.

01:29:32.081 --> 01:29:32.301
Okay.

01:29:32.321 --> 01:29:33.322
I hate to break it to you.

01:29:33.362 --> 01:29:46.409
You're getting all this stuff in the chat and you're trying to convince me that influenza isn't contagious by saying that they put a cubic centimeter, that's one milliliter of snot in people's noses.

01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:50.452
That's not going to do it if it's a bacteriophage.

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:57.796
And if any of these contagions are bacteriophages, then they're not going to spread by that kind of contact.

01:29:57.856 --> 01:29:59.317
They won't spread very often.

01:30:00.589 --> 01:30:05.693
They won't spread unless the bacteria are actively shedding phages.

01:30:05.753 --> 01:30:07.495
Otherwise, it won't spread like that.

01:30:08.495 --> 01:30:17.583
And so if influenza is a phage-based phenomenon that has been misconstrued as influenza, then you are right.

01:30:17.943 --> 01:30:21.446
It doesn't spread when they try to spread it like they say it spreads.

01:30:22.367 --> 01:30:24.669
But if they understood it with a little more nuance,

01:30:26.769 --> 01:30:37.632
then you might see how influenza and other things can spread, but they don't spread in the way that contagion says it spreads or the way that virology says it spreads, because the mechanism is not the same.

01:30:38.112 --> 01:30:41.333
The biological phenomenon is not the same.

01:30:41.473 --> 01:30:45.874
And it's a lot more variable if you throw in bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:30:46.594 --> 01:30:55.016
Bacteriophages, there's just, it's a remarkable level of complexity that has just been pulled out of the equation and eliminated from the cartoon.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.130
And so the very simple way to make sure that nobody figures that out is to just say influenza is not contagious.

01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:07.873
Look, they put snot up people's nose and nobody got sick.

01:31:08.414 --> 01:31:10.076
What if they made them eat that snot?

01:31:15.166 --> 01:31:17.147
and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off.

01:31:17.367 --> 01:31:22.810
But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.

01:31:23.991 --> 01:31:31.915
And what we need to do as a country, you know, we're really, if you look at the data today, the fertility of our kids is down.

01:31:31.935 --> 01:31:38.779
A teenager today has half the testosterone of a 68-year-old man.

01:31:40.479 --> 01:31:43.221
Is that from the food they eat or their lack of exercise?

01:31:44.363 --> 01:31:48.164
because exercise definitely increases the amount of testosterone.

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:53.546
Muscle use and muscle breakdown causes testosterone production.

01:31:54.386 --> 01:31:59.907
So is it because of the environmental toxins or is it because our gym classes have become pathetic?

01:32:02.448 --> 01:32:08.390
We have the, they have half the sperm counts of an older man.

01:32:09.468 --> 01:32:12.850
They have, our girls are hitting puberty six years early.

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:18.733
Now, earlier than historic levels, they're hitting puberty between 10 and 13 years old.

01:32:19.414 --> 01:32:22.195
See, that's not low hormones, that's early hormones.

01:32:22.255 --> 01:32:25.337
So we're grouping all these things together.

01:32:25.897 --> 01:32:35.043
We're mixing them all together, and we're trying to make sure that people are never able to usefully rank order their exposure to toxins.

01:32:35.603 --> 01:32:55.707
And the most important aspect of this debate is to make sure that people don't realize that there's a whole list of reasons why injection is so much dumber, so much more dangerous, so much more unpredictable, so much more biologically implausible as a medicine than ingestion is.

01:32:58.533 --> 01:33:14.206
And so he has to be very careful and Dr. Phil has to be very dumb in order to not rank those two things as very different and start there and then identify the toxins which we take in injected and toxins that we take in ingested.

01:33:16.467 --> 01:33:18.529
I'm starting to sound like a dead lady here.

01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:24.694
And the infertility is now going up in women and men.

01:33:26.348 --> 01:33:32.456
We have 74% of our kids cannot qualify for military service, so this is a national security issue.

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:50.858
I would go so far to still listening to Reginald Perrin, I still want you to consider the possibility, number one, spreading among different people is not what I'm suggesting because different people will necessarily have a very different microbiome.

01:33:51.418 --> 01:33:59.103
So susceptibility to a very different set of phage signals, if there was going to be a contagion based on phages or bacteria.

01:34:00.744 --> 01:34:02.265
Now people in the same family,

01:34:03.151 --> 01:34:14.968
who eat at the same table and who brush their teeth in the same bathroom and use the same toilets, they are more likely to have a related

01:34:16.832 --> 01:34:19.094
bacterial symbiosis.

01:34:19.274 --> 01:34:45.192
And therefore, a phage disease might be more likely, a phage-carried symptomology might be easier to transmit between people in households or between people who are dating than it would be to present and spread between strangers who are much more likely to have a diverse set of bacteriophage and bacteria, and therefore, less susceptibility to a common phage signal.

01:34:46.343 --> 01:34:58.490
We have to think deeper and you have to start with the new biology 101 where we acknowledge the existence of bacteria and their phages as an irreducible complex background of ourselves.

01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:04.273
If we don't start there, then arguing about contagion is already slave speak.

01:35:06.814 --> 01:35:15.499
And we're spending, you know, I met with the health minister of Indonesia this week and he said in his country they spend

01:35:17.146 --> 01:35:24.891
$3,300 a year per patient, and they have a lifespan, an average lifespan of 84 years old.

01:35:26.092 --> 01:35:32.917
We spend $12,000 a year per patient, per capita, and we have a lifespan of 79.

01:35:33.097 --> 01:35:44.145
We used to have- We have a lowered lifespan because of the opioid crisis in the last five years, and our Health and Human Services Secretary is telling us a story

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:48.268
where it has no real impact.

01:35:48.408 --> 01:35:55.412
That is a mathematically incorrect, it is a malevolently incorrect statement.

01:35:56.572 --> 01:36:02.996
The same lifespan as they did in Europe, but the Europeans have now moved six years ahead of us and we've stayed stagnant.

01:36:04.028 --> 01:36:04.688
This is it.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:09.129
So we're spending four times as much and our life expectancy's going down.

01:36:09.529 --> 01:36:10.230
Something's wrong.

01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:11.530
I mean, clearly something's wrong.

01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:16.571
And the chronic disease among children has gone up.

01:36:16.691 --> 01:36:27.974
We're spending our insurance dollars, our healthcare cost in hospitals is basically managing chronic disease at this point.

01:36:28.054 --> 01:36:30.294
It's not for acute care.

01:36:30.475 --> 01:36:32.355
95% of healthcare costs are for chronic disease.

01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:36.994
When my uncle was president, 3% of Americans had chronic disease.

01:36:37.034 --> 01:36:37.795
Today, it's 60%.

01:36:39.438 --> 01:36:46.687
When my uncle was president, and I was a 10-year-old boy, we spent zero on chronic disease in this country.

01:36:46.727 --> 01:36:51.373
The first pill that people were supposed to take on a regular basis was the pill.

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.855
And but you know we didn't even have treatments back then.

01:36:55.616 --> 01:37:03.242
But now it's 90 95 percent of what we're spending on health care is going to treat chronic disease.

01:37:03.282 --> 01:37:05.904
So it is it's destroying our economy.

01:37:07.245 --> 01:37:11.848
Health care costs rise every year by 2 percent greater than the economy is growing.

01:37:12.269 --> 01:37:13.590
So this is existential.

01:37:13.710 --> 01:37:14.891
We cannot keep this up.

01:37:14.951 --> 01:37:20.255
You know I talk to a the biggest furniture

01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:37.241
manufacturer in Wisconsin the other day, and we were talking about the tariffs and whether those were going to help him bring manufacturing home, and he said, I don't care how high they raise the tariffs, I cannot manufacture in this country because of the health care costs.

01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:40.604
The health care costs that I spend on a single worker

01:37:41.934 --> 01:37:46.661
I can pay the entire salary of a Vietnamese worker.

01:37:47.402 --> 01:37:49.626
So I can't move it back here.

01:37:49.666 --> 01:37:51.509
So it's crippling our business.

01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:52.911
It's crippling our country.

01:37:53.131 --> 01:37:56.236
And we've got to figure out a way to reverse this trend.

01:37:56.633 --> 01:37:58.255
Yeah, and let's talk about this.

01:37:58.535 --> 01:38:07.403
You talk about the chronic disease in children, and one of the things you've come up with is a list of the root causes.

01:38:07.504 --> 01:38:13.730
And I've made a graphic of it up here, so I've given you a big prompter you can use up here.

01:38:14.771 --> 01:38:19.275
The potential root causes of childhood chronic disease epidemic.

01:38:20.556 --> 01:38:25.860
These are the things that you're putting on the list of things to work on, right?

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:41.130
You're talking about... Now isn't Brian Hooker angry that he invested a decade of his life in this man and now when he's got the stage and he's got the power and he's so old, he's got nothing to lose.

01:38:42.211 --> 01:38:45.453
He's got a Hollywood wife and a testosterone body.

01:38:46.814 --> 01:38:50.076
He goes on Dr. Phil and doesn't even talk about

01:38:52.085 --> 01:38:55.106
intramuscular injection just injuring people.

01:38:56.486 --> 01:39:15.050
He's going to talk about the American diet, the absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, government policies, food product production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism.

01:39:17.566 --> 01:39:23.330
American diet, the absorption of toxic material, the absorption, how about the injection of it?

01:39:26.932 --> 01:39:30.274
Medical treatments, medical treatments, what does that mean?

01:39:30.934 --> 01:39:40.320
Like statins, lifestyle, environmental factors, government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation and corporate influence or cronyism.

01:39:43.874 --> 01:39:59.516
if i was brian i would be mad oh no wait i guess brian's not mad because skyhorse publishing published a book he's got great salary and he's got a great insurance policy maybe that's why he's not so upset that

01:40:00.339 --> 01:40:27.592
you know, kids are still getting injected, and new autistic kids are being created every day, and new chronic diseases are being created every day, and new teenagers are being injured by the HPV shot every day, but he doesn't care, because he's got his book, his $200,000 a year salary, and his fat insurance, and Bobby almost made it to the White House, at least he's on Dr. Phil, and Brian and Mary Holland can high five in the background.

01:40:29.119 --> 01:40:29.579
Traitors.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:46.251
Diet, absorption of toxic materials, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence, and cronyism.

01:40:46.991 --> 01:40:52.175
Talk about some of these things that you, these are, this is where this is all coming from.

01:40:52.455 --> 01:40:55.417
No prioritization at all.

01:40:57.506 --> 01:41:05.691
when he already knew from Brandy Vaughn and already knew from me that there is a huge difference between injection and ingestion.

01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:08.592
And injection is actually just dumb.

01:41:09.073 --> 01:41:15.916
There is no justification for injecting intramuscularly a combination of substances and calling that medicine.

01:41:16.657 --> 01:41:21.319
It is just an illusion of consensus among a bunch of really bad people.

01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:25.662
And he apparently is one of them.

01:41:27.751 --> 01:41:30.894
This is a hit list of things that need to be addressed.

01:41:31.534 --> 01:41:34.096
And this is on your to-do list.

01:41:35.337 --> 01:41:40.302
On February 14th, President Trump signed an executive order.

01:41:40.742 --> 01:41:52.512
It's called the Maha Order, to create a commission, a Maha Commission, and these are the metrics that we are now studying.

01:41:52.592 --> 01:41:54.754
So we have 100 days to put out a report,

01:41:55.785 --> 01:42:04.372
and then another 60 days after that to put out a list of deliverables about what we're gonna do to end it.

01:42:05.573 --> 01:42:09.996
And the top, I would say the top concern is the diet.

01:42:11.157 --> 01:42:16.661
We have 10,000 ingredients in our food and in Europe they only have 400.

01:42:17.762 --> 01:42:20.084
Most of the stuff we put in our food is banned in Europe.

01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:25.204
Oh, that is a crazy, that's a crazy ratio.

01:42:25.404 --> 01:42:31.668
And, you know, if you, for example, food dyes, which we've announced now, we're going to get rid of all the food dyes.

01:42:37.311 --> 01:42:39.592
Let me put it, let me put it this way.

01:42:39.632 --> 01:42:42.374
Petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

01:42:42.434 --> 01:42:44.736
We can use vegetable dyes.

01:42:44.776 --> 01:42:46.096
That's what they use in Canada.

01:42:46.116 --> 01:42:48.318
That's what they use in Europe.

01:42:49.577 --> 01:43:02.182
if you buy Froot Loops in this country it is a completely different product and what you would buy across the border in Canada the Canadian version of Froot Loops which is made by he is on dr drew

01:43:03.832 --> 01:43:19.940
As the head of an agency with 80,000 employees and the largest budget in the American government, he is on Dr. Phil talking about Froot Loops and advocating for them to be made safer in the United States.

01:43:22.101 --> 01:43:23.782
And he's not using a few seconds.

01:43:25.223 --> 01:43:31.166
The same company, Kellogg's, has only vegetable dyes and a limited number of ingredients.

01:43:31.226 --> 01:43:33.307
In our country, it's all chemical dyes.

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:41.445
And the food processors say, if we ask them, well, you know, why are you poisoning American kids and you're not poisoning Canadian kids?

01:43:41.505 --> 01:43:45.749
We are a hundred days in, a hundred days, five days ago.

01:43:46.009 --> 01:43:47.570
And look at where we are.

01:43:48.251 --> 01:43:49.392
We have been played.

01:43:49.992 --> 01:43:52.014
America has been sabotaged.

01:43:55.636 --> 01:43:57.718
And the answer, of course, is Canada won't let them.

01:43:59.056 --> 01:44:03.099
But why are they using those ingredients in our country?

01:44:03.139 --> 01:44:06.782
Because they're cheaper and because the colors are more vibrant.

01:44:07.262 --> 01:44:11.065
And they found that if the colors are more vibrant, kids want more of them.

01:44:11.986 --> 01:44:20.792
And that's the problem is that I was involved kind of peripherally in the tobacco litigation back in the late 1980s.

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:29.707
And the tobacco companies were, at that time, the wealthiest countries, the most cash-rich companies on earth.

01:44:30.928 --> 01:44:32.770
And they saw the writing on the wall.

01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:36.373
They saw that they were gonna face litigation and regulatory headwinds.

01:44:36.433 --> 01:44:39.476
They saw that their customer base was shrinking.

01:44:39.496 --> 01:44:42.279
And they began to diversify.

01:44:42.439 --> 01:44:44.861
So they targeted the food companies.

01:44:45.181 --> 01:44:45.442
And by 1994,

01:44:48.643 --> 01:44:51.084
The two biggest food companies in the world were R.J.

01:44:51.164 --> 01:44:53.546
Reynolds and Philip Morris, tobacco companies.

01:44:54.526 --> 01:45:02.971
They took thousands of scientists that were involved in making tobacco more addictive and more attractive, particularly to kids.

01:45:04.352 --> 01:45:07.234
And they transferred those science to their food division.

01:45:08.315 --> 01:45:15.239
And those scientists went into the lab and began creating ingredients and identifying ingredients that make

01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:22.113
Can I just make sure that this Reginald Perrin guy knows that I'm not messing around here?

01:45:22.173 --> 01:45:22.954
Hold on one second.

01:45:22.994 --> 01:45:24.035
Let me unplug and come back.

01:45:54.019 --> 01:45:56.381
Now I'm not, I'm not arguing with you.

01:45:56.421 --> 01:45:59.163
I'm not saying you're wrong or you're right about influenza.

01:45:59.203 --> 01:46:03.266
I'm saying that I have a book here that's called Viral Diseases, Virus Diseases.

01:46:04.467 --> 01:46:07.530
And I just want to show you what is the book, okay?

01:46:08.751 --> 01:46:10.252
Because I'm not messing around.

01:46:11.113 --> 01:46:12.174
I'm not messing around.

01:46:12.874 --> 01:46:14.335
I'm not playing, okay?

01:46:14.395 --> 01:46:15.276
I'm not playing at all.

01:46:16.317 --> 01:46:18.719
And I want to make sure that you understand that I'm not playing.

01:46:20.148 --> 01:46:27.211
Virus Diseases by members of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, including Richard E. Shope, MD.

01:46:28.271 --> 01:46:29.672
And this is from 1943.

01:46:30.872 --> 01:46:39.836
So if you haven't read this book, then just know, sorry, woo, I'm a little tiny guy.

01:46:39.876 --> 01:46:43.077
If you haven't read this book, then know that I'm doing my homework, okay?

01:46:43.137 --> 01:46:45.298
I'm not gonna put, you know,

01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.803
all kinds of stuff out there when I don't know the answers.

01:46:49.883 --> 01:47:02.052
And I think a lot of people before me have been scripted to put stuff out there with a great deal of certainty to try and dismiss a lot of biological ideas that are probably a little more subtle or nuanced.

01:47:03.433 --> 01:47:06.496
in order to completely disarm our children.

01:47:06.756 --> 01:47:08.878
And it's really important to understand that.

01:47:08.918 --> 01:47:18.767
We cannot accept any oversimplified answer for what's going on here, unless it's as simple as saying they're murdering and lying to people, that's fine.

01:47:19.768 --> 01:47:21.730
But we have to be very, very careful.

01:47:23.171 --> 01:47:26.194
And I don't think the no virus people have been very, very careful.

01:47:28.932 --> 01:47:38.577
So putting in loads of sugar, which is addictive, and sodium, and then developing these ingredients that mimic natural flavors.

01:47:39.417 --> 01:47:46.841
So they'll mimic a strawberry flavor, for example, and you're hungry for strawberries, and you can smell and taste this ingredient.

01:47:47.725 --> 01:47:49.105
but it has no nutrients in it.

01:47:49.405 --> 01:47:51.166
When you eat a strawberry, oh, sorry.

01:47:51.686 --> 01:47:57.647
Does it seem as though his phone is going off, making duck noises right now, so he's going to apologize for it.

01:47:57.667 --> 01:48:02.328
Does it seem like his priority is food?

01:48:03.328 --> 01:48:06.008
Or his priority is the mercury in the environment?

01:48:06.028 --> 01:48:11.429
Because he spent years of his life removing mercury from the environment, getting mercury out of the water.

01:48:11.889 --> 01:48:15.750
And then he found out that people were getting mercury injected into them.

01:48:18.098 --> 01:48:25.460
And then it was so important that he decided to change the name of the World Mercury Project to Children's Health Defense.

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:31.762
And now we're here talking about Froot Loops and petroleum-based dyes.

01:48:35.743 --> 01:48:37.323
That's not even a suitable word.

01:48:37.383 --> 01:48:38.404
It should really be.

01:48:38.424 --> 01:48:40.964
It is impossible.

01:48:44.107 --> 01:48:46.948
that we are here right now by accident.

01:48:46.988 --> 01:48:48.188
This is malevolence.

01:48:49.008 --> 01:48:51.108
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:48:53.289 --> 01:48:55.309
And we're arguing about Froot Loops.

01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:57.890
I ducked.

01:49:05.752 --> 01:49:07.112
I'm sorry about that.

01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:11.497
When you eat a strawberry, you're getting- I'm not taking that out, by the way.

01:49:11.517 --> 01:49:12.400
It's staying in.

01:49:13.263 --> 01:49:14.747
The quack and duck is staying in.

01:49:14.767 --> 01:49:15.108
That's okay.

01:49:16.735 --> 01:49:22.117
Despite some post-election optimism, Wall Street is already bracing for a rough rest of 2025.

01:49:22.217 --> 01:49:29.979
When Warren Buffett starts dumping blue chip stocks and stacking up cash, you've got to ask... Another advertisement?

01:49:30.679 --> 01:49:34.120
Is this the way that he sees Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.762
as just kind of an opportunity to sell stuff, to read advertisements?

01:49:38.822 --> 01:49:45.244
Isn't that what the Rumble-sponsored Dr. Drew is gonna do with his spot with Jay Bhattacharya?

01:49:45.284 --> 01:49:46.484
What is going on here?

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:54.003
Dr. Phil, to 50505 to get your free precious metals guide from Preserve Gold.

01:49:54.323 --> 01:50:02.307
With gold prices recently breaking records and analysts predicting this trend to continue through 2025, you cannot afford to wait.

01:50:02.947 --> 01:50:04.428
As a bonus, you can get up to 15,000.

01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:11.492
How many other people are selling gold or encouraging you to convert your IRA to gold or all this other stuff?

01:50:11.592 --> 01:50:12.752
It is remarkable.

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:13.853
To 50505 today.

01:50:17.219 --> 01:50:20.141
When you eat a strawberry, you're getting nutrients in that strawberry.

01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:30.046
When you eat that strawberry flavor, you're not getting any nutrients, and your body recognizes that you're not getting nutrients, so it's craving more and more of it.

01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:34.223
Oh, you have an impulse to eat without ever getting satiated.

01:50:34.584 --> 01:50:39.187
So you stuff yourself with food, trying to get the nutrients, but they never come.

01:50:39.407 --> 01:50:41.929
And what you're getting in that food is making you sick.

01:50:42.449 --> 01:50:44.070
And it's like an itch you can't scratch.

01:50:44.190 --> 01:50:50.355
And you know, like this is a picture of European Froot Loops and our Froot Loops.

01:50:51.636 --> 01:50:53.057
Can you, is the camera getting this?

01:50:54.177 --> 01:50:56.099
And ours are a lot brighter.

01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.061
And what's making them brighter,

01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:03.412
our petrol base dies, right?

01:51:04.132 --> 01:51:17.038
Right, and another thing they did was these scientists realized that your brain actually measures the number of times you chew to tell your stomach when it's full.

01:51:17.259 --> 01:51:22.021
It's one of the many metrics that your brain uses to tell when you're full.

01:51:23.101 --> 01:51:29.324
And so they began adding softeners to our food and make it so you don't have to chew so much.

01:51:29.344 --> 01:51:30.625
You can inhale a Twinkie

01:51:31.778 --> 01:51:37.122
and your brain is telling your body, oh, you haven't eaten anything yet, because you only chewed two or three times.

01:51:39.364 --> 01:51:52.913
These kind of chemicals are designed to make us insatiable, continually eating all day, never full, never satisfied, and getting less and less healthy.

01:51:52.933 --> 01:51:55.936
And then, of course, there's the chemical, the pesticides.

01:51:58.012 --> 01:52:05.961
and these other kind of artifacts, the residues that are left in our food and those are not, they're designed to kill plants and animals.

01:52:07.162 --> 01:52:10.666
And we're an animal and our microbiome is filled with plants.

01:52:11.747 --> 01:52:14.771
So we're literally eating poison.

01:52:15.946 --> 01:52:19.267
Yeah, I wrote a book a long time ago called The Ultimate Weight Solution.

01:52:19.407 --> 01:52:20.907
Our microbiome is plants.

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:22.608
It's a really interesting statement.

01:52:22.628 --> 01:52:23.668
I'm not even gonna go there yet.

01:52:24.028 --> 01:52:25.288
Which was not a diet.

01:52:25.489 --> 01:52:29.510
It was talking about how we eat and interact with food.

01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:34.691
And I talked about high response cost foods and low response cost foods.

01:52:35.091 --> 01:52:42.233
And any food you could eat like a wood chipper, just where you didn't have to put anything into it, was exactly that.

01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.642
your brain wasn't getting the message that you were actually eating.

01:52:46.702 --> 01:52:51.905
So you get a bean and cheese burrito, low response cost food.

01:52:52.085 --> 01:52:53.586
You never got satiated.

01:52:53.626 --> 01:52:55.447
You could just kind of inhale it.

01:52:56.507 --> 01:52:58.628
Imagine this much discussion.

01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:08.034
Imagine being somebody like Brian Hooker who dedicated your life to helping Bobby get where he is.

01:53:09.176 --> 01:53:15.639
sitting watching this on a laptop with your adult child in the background shitting his pants.

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:23.222
I mean, what's going on here?

01:53:27.724 --> 01:53:30.145
Paula Aitken's son is 38 years old.

01:53:32.546 --> 01:53:33.486
What's going on here?

01:53:39.801 --> 01:53:44.664
and it doesn't give your brain the message, and that's a problem.

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:46.004
The same is true of sugar.

01:53:46.204 --> 01:54:03.914
If you have granulated sugar, human beings were designed to eat sugar because when the apples bloomed or the oranges bloomed during certain parts of the year, you had a craving and you would eat them for a short period of time.

01:54:04.855 --> 01:54:09.357
Your body's always craving them because there's a lot of good stuff in that fruit.

01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:13.023
there's fiber and there's vitamins, et cetera.

01:54:13.923 --> 01:54:28.992
But if you're eating granulated sugar, your body is craving it, but your stomach and your mind are telling your body, oh, you haven't really eaten anything, because you haven't had to chew the apple, you haven't had to, you know, there's no effort in it.

01:54:31.226 --> 01:54:33.347
And so we can eat unlimited amounts.

01:54:33.407 --> 01:54:35.248
Of course, sugar is like crack.

01:54:35.348 --> 01:54:38.570
It's poison and it feeds tumors.

01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:39.891
It destroys your brain.

01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:43.012
It destroys all of your organs.

01:54:44.093 --> 01:54:50.796
And we are programmed to eat it every minute of the day, from advertising to it's in everything that we eat.

01:54:51.537 --> 01:54:52.297
I looked this up.

01:54:52.477 --> 01:54:55.159
In 1800, the average person had 18 pounds of sugar a year.

01:54:55.279 --> 01:54:55.399
In 1900,

01:55:00.833 --> 01:55:02.074
90 pounds of sugar a year.

01:55:03.035 --> 01:55:05.257
In 2000, I missed that indeed.

01:55:05.897 --> 01:55:08.999
It's like crack cocaine and ask me how I know.

01:55:09.019 --> 01:55:15.824
980 pounds of sugar a year.

01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:19.747
So that's a half a pound a day.

01:55:20.797 --> 01:55:29.560
So we're eating a lot of sugar these days that we weren't eating back then, and obesity wasn't a big problem back then.

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:32.141
It's not only obesity, but it's diabetes.

01:55:32.181 --> 01:55:42.185
When I was a kid, the typical pediatrician would see one case of diabetes during his entire career, 40 or 50 year career, juvenile diabetes.

01:55:43.476 --> 01:55:47.322
Today, 38% of teens are pre-diabetic or diabetic.

01:55:48.203 --> 01:55:51.888
And we don't have to ask why.

01:55:51.928 --> 01:55:53.611
We're loading our kids with sugar.

01:55:53.631 --> 01:55:57.877
20 years ago, there was virtually no diabetes in China.

01:55:58.803 --> 01:56:03.205
Today, over 50% of the adult population is diabetic or pre-diabetic.

01:56:03.585 --> 01:56:12.348
You even have to ask yourself the question as to whether or not that is due to the exposure of the diet or whether it has to do with the vaccine schedule.

01:56:12.809 --> 01:56:17.370
And you have to ask yourself that in the context of the difference between the prevalence of

01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:27.556
diabetes in other countries with a much less strict and later applied and much lower dose schedule than America.

01:56:27.676 --> 01:56:36.381
But here he's presenting an absolute certainty that we can explain a lot of these chronic disease problems with getting rid of dyes and what we put in our mouths.

01:56:37.602 --> 01:56:46.227
And it's because they built 20,000 fast food joints in China and they are now suffering the consequences too.

01:56:46.926 --> 01:56:53.832
Now, the things that we're talking about, these are not things that are challenging to follow, right?

01:56:53.852 --> 01:56:57.314
I mean, this makes common sense.

01:56:57.935 --> 01:57:05.101
So why do you think people are so threatened by what you're doing?

01:57:05.361 --> 01:57:08.403
It can't be just the confusion about vaccination.

01:57:09.907 --> 01:57:22.175
because you don't have to go very far to find legacy media that either won't talk to you or labels you as some kind of conspiracy crazy nutball.

01:57:22.656 --> 01:57:28.760
Why do you think people are so threatened by the message that you are delivering?

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:35.925
Because you're saying this isn't you coming up with what you're going to do and what you think should be done.

01:57:36.966 --> 01:57:45.269
You have a solid commitment to gold standard science, empirical science that's not corporate captured.

01:57:45.929 --> 01:57:52.692
That is truly empirical, replicable science with good methodology, good sample sizes.

01:57:54.513 --> 01:57:56.953
And what you're talking about here is irrefutable.

01:57:57.374 --> 01:57:58.134
These are facts.

01:57:58.454 --> 01:58:00.875
Why do you think people are so threatened by your message?

01:58:01.055 --> 01:58:02.415
I don't think it's a mystery there.

01:58:02.896 --> 01:58:03.796
The industries.

01:58:05.236 --> 01:58:09.559
that profit from these products are very powerful industries.

01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:18.304
And there are industries that not only control Congress, the pharmaceutical industry has, I think, two or three lobbyists for every member of Congress and the Senate.

01:58:19.845 --> 01:58:24.308
And the processed food industry is also very, very powerful.

01:58:24.448 --> 01:58:28.390
And they're both huge advertisers on the media.

01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:29.631
Roger Ailes, who was

01:58:31.027 --> 01:58:33.108
the founder of Fox News.

01:58:33.448 --> 01:58:42.770
And I had this strange relationship with Roger Ailes because I spent, when I was 19 years old, I spent three months in a tent with him in Africa.

01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:47.031
I actually, at one point in time, said that this was Jeffrey Sachs.

01:58:47.271 --> 01:58:52.272
And so I correct myself now and realize that it was Roger Ailes.

01:58:52.312 --> 01:58:55.153
But that's an interesting guy to spend three months in a tent with.

01:58:55.845 --> 01:58:58.627
doing a film over there and we became good friends.

01:58:59.748 --> 01:59:05.553
And although we were politically antithetical, he was a very smart guy, very funny, very, very funny.

01:59:05.894 --> 01:59:06.834
I knew Roger well.

01:59:07.075 --> 01:59:09.757
And he was also a very, very loyal friend.

01:59:11.098 --> 01:59:14.321
And for years he would have me, he would make Fox News.

01:59:16.013 --> 01:59:28.218
hosts, the show hosts like Sean Hannity and Neil Cavuto and Bill O'Reilly and all the others put me on to talk about the environment, even though he didn't agree with anything I was saying.

01:59:29.538 --> 01:59:37.101
And then I went to him in 2014 because we had just done a film, a documentary film on thimerosal and vaccines.

01:59:38.161 --> 01:59:40.162
And he had a family member who had been affected

01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:43.051
And he said, there's nothing I'd rather do.

01:59:43.151 --> 01:59:44.651
I believe everything in this film.

01:59:44.711 --> 01:59:46.632
There's nothing I'd rather do than put this on.

01:59:48.492 --> 01:59:53.874
If any of my hosts allowed you on to talk about this issue, I would have to fire them.

01:59:54.154 --> 01:59:59.436
And if I didn't fire them, I would hear from Rupert, meaning Rupert Murdoch, within 10 minutes.

02:00:00.476 --> 02:00:09.739
And the reason for that, he said, is 75% of his advertising revenues on the evening news shows were coming from pharmaceutical companies.

02:00:09.759 --> 02:00:10.819
He told me at that time.

02:00:12.273 --> 02:00:21.299
I don't know if this is still true, but typically on an evening news show, there's 22 advertisements, and 17 of those are pharmaceutical ads.

02:00:21.339 --> 02:00:27.483
The pharmaceutical companies really like evening news because only old people watch the news.

02:00:29.024 --> 02:00:34.407
I have a 28-year-old kid, and I said, have you ever seen an evening news show?

02:00:34.467 --> 02:00:35.107
And he said, no.

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:38.930
He's very well informed, but he gets it from other sources.

02:00:40.046 --> 02:00:47.011
And so they're advertising to people who are the biggest buyers, purchase of pharmaceutical products.

02:00:47.131 --> 02:00:50.054
But they're also they're using that leverage.

02:00:51.275 --> 02:00:54.297
I had to go to the bathroom so bad, I couldn't even tell you I was going anywhere.

02:00:54.537 --> 02:00:56.699
I hope I didn't miss anything if I did put it in the chat.

02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:02.383
To get control not only to advertise their products, but to get control of content.

02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:04.905
Oh, you know, Anderson Cooper.

02:01:06.273 --> 02:01:17.197
is get some salary of something like $20 million a year, but probably 75% of that is coming indirectly through pharmaceutical companies.

02:01:17.237 --> 02:01:23.239
Just to be clear, make sure you realize that this whole interview, we are absolutely ignoring this.

02:01:24.439 --> 02:01:25.999
We're absolutely ignoring this.

02:01:26.239 --> 02:01:27.840
We're absolutely ignoring all that.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:30.281
There's no discussion of it at all.

02:01:31.656 --> 02:01:40.164
We have moved on now to the Maha movement, curing chronic disease by September and discovering the cause of autism by September.

02:01:40.204 --> 02:01:41.145
We have moved on.

02:01:42.746 --> 02:01:43.867
See it for what it is.

02:01:43.927 --> 02:01:44.908
COVID is gone.

02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:45.589
It's over.

02:01:45.689 --> 02:01:46.870
It's in the rear view mirror.

02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:49.072
And that is a disaster.

02:01:51.141 --> 02:01:52.723
Oh, that's who his boss is.

02:01:52.944 --> 02:01:54.366
And that's why he's reporting to.

02:01:54.426 --> 02:02:05.323
And that's why during COVID you saw all of these news channels completely on board shaming people who didn't go along with the government orthodoxies.

02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:13.698
and drumming up fear about COVID, you know, printing the deaths on the chyrons every day and the number of cases, et cetera.

02:02:14.459 --> 02:02:21.807
So he doesn't notice, doesn't know, despite being told by me that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:28.292
that RNA cannot pandemic, that they must have lied about it, that the PCR is misconstruing a background.

02:02:28.672 --> 02:02:30.333
He won't tell you any of that.

02:02:30.413 --> 02:02:49.786
Instead, he's stuck exactly to the Peter Daszak, Tony Fauci narrative that in a few more weeks with the help of of Jay Bhattacharya and Tulsi Gabbard will be a confirmation by HHS that it was indeed a lab leak and that maybe we need to indict Fauci after all.

02:02:51.451 --> 02:02:59.758
and fortifying an orthodoxy that just so happens to create huge profits for their advertisers.

02:02:59.778 --> 02:03:04.261
The food companies are the other big advertisers, so the cereal brands, et cetera.

02:03:05.743 --> 02:03:11.207
They have tremendous power over the media, and that's one of the reasons I think that I get such blowback.

02:03:12.188 --> 02:03:15.931
Has it been worse than you expected since you have taken over?

02:03:15.971 --> 02:03:16.892
Has the pushback,

02:03:17.776 --> 02:03:24.243
the character assassination, the twisting of words, the taking out of context.

02:03:24.664 --> 02:03:27.787
Has all that been worse than you thought, or has it been about what you expected?

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:31.091
I mean, I'm pretty used to it, because I've been doing it for 20 years.

02:03:32.452 --> 02:03:35.576
And it was always, you know, I've been censored for 20 years.

02:03:36.477 --> 02:03:38.019
So, you know, and during my

02:03:39.397 --> 02:03:44.681
During COVID, I was surprised because they removed me from Instagram.

02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:48.524
And they said it was because I was passing misinformation.

02:03:49.805 --> 02:03:57.891
But they could not, when I challenged Instagram on it, they could not point to one post that I'd ever made that had any misinformation in it.

02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:12.791
I was always very careful about what I posted because I was used to being challenged, so I didn't want to put something out there that was wrong.

02:04:13.031 --> 02:04:20.233
Every fact that I ever put on Instagram was cited and sourced to either government databases or peer-reviewed publications.

02:04:22.998 --> 02:04:28.083
And I had a fact-checking operation like I think no other in America.

02:04:28.103 --> 02:04:41.915
We had 350 MD physicians and PhD scientists on our advisory board, including the Nobel Laureate, Luc Montagnier, who was the guy who got the Nobel Prize for discovering the HIV virus.

02:04:42.896 --> 02:04:44.377
On whose advisory board?

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.462
Whose advisory board is he talking about?

02:04:52.182 --> 02:05:11.273
Because when I was a staff scientist under Brian Hooker, I understood the advisory board to be a pretty small number of MDs that included Meryl Nass and somebody that by the name of Mumper, who's given a presentation for CHD about how we should have vaccines that are based on your genetic background.

02:05:13.374 --> 02:05:13.674
Really?

02:05:19.719 --> 02:05:25.604
And those people would not have stayed with me for a second if I was posting irresponsibly.

02:05:25.624 --> 02:05:32.030
So, you know, what they, in fact, when we got, you know, I sued them on this.

02:05:33.031 --> 02:05:36.734
I sued the Biden administration and I won that lawsuit.

02:05:37.735 --> 02:05:44.962
And what we found through discovery was that 37 hours after President Biden took the oath of office, swearing to uphold the Constitution,

02:05:46.377 --> 02:05:51.219
He appointed a group in the White House to censor me and other people.

02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:54.561
But I was the first one censored.

02:05:54.741 --> 02:06:07.027
And we now have the emails between this group and Mark Zuckerberg and other people at Twitter, et cetera, which Elon made public.

02:06:08.147 --> 02:06:09.348
And thank God for him.

02:06:16.495 --> 02:06:24.579
I don't think we'd have free speech in this country if it wasn't for Elon Musk because he opened up Twitter and allowed people to see what was actually happening.

02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:33.464
He opened up... He opened up Twitter.

02:06:34.245 --> 02:06:37.326
He opened up Twitter and let us see what was happening.

02:06:38.367 --> 02:06:41.969
He opened up Twitter and let us see what was happening.

02:06:42.889 --> 02:06:44.270
Stop lying!

02:06:47.529 --> 02:06:55.214
Either way, against the advice of all of his attorneys, he turned all these documents over to a bunch of journalists and said, do what you want with them.

02:06:55.455 --> 02:06:57.196
He's still talking about Elon Musk.

02:06:57.256 --> 02:06:57.776
Yes, he is.

02:06:57.796 --> 02:07:00.678
Yeah, that's unheard of.

02:07:00.938 --> 02:07:03.480
So and, you know, he lost billions of dollars.

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:05.942
He's he gained it back and now he's lost it again.

02:07:07.403 --> 02:07:10.965
But but, you know, so I was used to it.

02:07:11.846 --> 02:07:12.726
I Twitter.

02:07:13.187 --> 02:07:13.387
I mean,

02:07:13.917 --> 02:07:17.102
Instagram immediately canceled me, took me off.

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.665
I lost a million followers.

02:07:19.927 --> 02:07:23.030
And for a year, they would not even explain it.

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:25.672
And ultimately, we were able to talk to them.

02:07:25.712 --> 02:07:30.276
And when President Trump came in, they put me back up again.

02:07:30.636 --> 02:07:31.677
Yeah, it's about time.

02:07:32.077 --> 02:07:33.298
We're going to take a quick break.

02:07:34.419 --> 02:07:43.207
But don't go far, because tonight's town hall meeting will have limited commercial breaks, thanks to our main sponsor, Sambrosia Night Syrup.

02:07:43.247 --> 02:07:45.489
Sambrosia is committed to America's health

02:07:46.129 --> 02:07:52.492
through its safe and effective... He's reading this in the presence of the Health and Human Services Secretary now.

02:07:52.612 --> 02:08:01.616
We'll be right back with more of our conversation and our audience is going to start getting involved because this is a town hall, not just a show.

02:08:02.056 --> 02:08:02.536
After the break.

02:08:03.211 --> 02:08:05.613
Welcome back to our special town hall tonight.

02:08:05.893 --> 02:08:06.634
R.F.K.

02:08:06.694 --> 02:08:09.336
Jr., The First Hundred Days.

02:08:10.878 --> 02:08:11.979
Robert Kennedy Jr.

02:08:12.359 --> 02:08:14.941
is the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

02:08:15.622 --> 02:08:17.844
We're talking about the first hundred days.

02:08:18.004 --> 02:08:20.266
We're going to involve the audience here in just a bit.

02:08:21.207 --> 02:08:25.312
and let all of you here ask questions and give comments.

02:08:26.353 --> 02:08:27.275
There's been a lot of comments.

02:08:27.355 --> 02:08:33.623
It's interesting that you say Matt Taibbi was there to observe the event as the USSR folded.

02:08:34.744 --> 02:08:37.448
Mary Holland also did three years in Russia at some point.

02:08:37.488 --> 02:08:38.449
I don't know exactly when.

02:08:38.609 --> 02:08:43.250
We had a conversation recently about whether to get vaccinated in general at the same time.

02:08:43.710 --> 02:08:45.671
We have a measles outbreak.

02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:52.493
Tell us what we need to know about the measles outbreak that's going on right now.

02:08:52.573 --> 02:08:55.014
Is this any more than we've had in previous years?

02:08:55.134 --> 02:08:56.074
Is it about the same?

02:08:56.334 --> 02:08:56.994
Where are we?

02:08:57.074 --> 02:09:02.616
This is the second biggest outbreak since 2000, so the biggest outbreak.

02:09:04.286 --> 02:09:07.288
which is about 1,200 cases was in 2019.

02:09:07.348 --> 02:09:12.670
We have now, I think of this morning, about 847 cases in our country.

02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:13.711
We have three deaths.

02:09:14.931 --> 02:09:22.035
We've had, I think, a total of four deaths from measles since 2020, or since 2000, sorry.

02:09:24.896 --> 02:09:28.278
I mean, I would say that we're doing well.

02:09:28.478 --> 02:09:33.901
If you look at Canada, they have roughly the same number of measles cases, but they have one-eighth of our population.

02:09:35.499 --> 02:09:39.101
Europe has 10 times the amount of measles cases that we have.

02:09:39.161 --> 02:09:39.822
They've got about 7,000.

02:09:39.862 --> 02:09:42.543
Last year, Europe had an outbreak of 127,037 deaths.

02:09:42.563 --> 02:09:44.925
The MMR vaccine, the measles vaccine, pretty much for a time ended measles cases.

02:10:01.906 --> 02:10:06.148
But the vaccine wanes, and also a lot of people don't get vaccinated.

02:10:07.269 --> 02:10:14.253
And the outbreaks are mainly taking place in unvaccinated communities, but there's also some vaccinated people that get sick.

02:10:14.573 --> 02:10:16.714
The vaccine wanes about

02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:19.791
or a little over 4% per year.

02:10:20.872 --> 02:10:26.336
That means a lot of older people are walking around with very little protection, if any protection.

02:10:26.716 --> 02:10:36.443
And here is where the management of the population pyramid problem comes in, because now, of course, we have the excuse to test old people for their vulnerability.

02:10:37.004 --> 02:10:43.949
And if they should not happen to show up as the vulnerability that we want, we can just justify giving them a booster.

02:10:45.097 --> 02:10:49.500
which will most likely reduce their lifespan and make it easier for them to die quick.

02:10:52.221 --> 02:10:55.803
Same thing with the shingles and the pneumonia and the flu.

02:10:56.544 --> 02:10:58.345
This is just another story.

02:10:58.365 --> 02:11:03.028
And he's on script because he's been given it.

02:11:04.128 --> 02:11:04.989
This is gross.

02:11:05.909 --> 02:11:07.130
You should be very angry.

02:11:08.431 --> 02:11:08.811
And that,

02:11:09.645 --> 02:11:21.112
There's the most famous infectious disease, the number one infectious disease expert in the world in 1963 when they put in this fax.

02:11:21.952 --> 02:11:28.076
If you don't believe me, I'm just going to show you because I have another video that will show it to you.

02:11:28.812 --> 02:11:29.772
Right now, the U.S.

02:11:30.013 --> 02:11:35.555
is dangerously close to reaching its 900th measle case as the virus continues to spread.

02:11:36.095 --> 02:11:37.856
Two children have died in Texas.

02:11:38.256 --> 02:11:43.419
Our Erica Edwards asked the CDC's deputy director about that in an exclusive interview.

02:11:44.519 --> 02:11:46.060
You spent a good amount of time here.

02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.442
What are you seeing on the ground right now related to the measles outbreak and the response?

02:11:51.886 --> 02:11:55.129
Well, number one, I can say that people here love their children.

02:11:55.529 --> 02:12:09.703
In Gaines County, there is a real desire to bring this to an end, to make sure that no more children die and that we're able to control the outbreak of measles.

02:12:11.067 --> 02:12:15.090
MSNBC medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta is here with me and back with me.

02:12:15.730 --> 02:12:18.012
MSNBC political analyst Donna Edwards.

02:12:18.052 --> 02:12:19.233
It's always good to have you here.

02:12:20.093 --> 02:12:24.096
So 663 confirmed cases now just in Texas of measles.

02:12:24.516 --> 02:12:32.201
A local paper in Lubbock, and that's where the outbreak started, says the latest case involves an infected person on a college campus.

02:12:33.082 --> 02:12:35.584
At this point, how worried should we be?

02:12:36.254 --> 02:12:37.315
Well, this is going to get worse.

02:12:37.335 --> 02:12:38.295
Look at that background.

02:12:38.315 --> 02:12:39.076
Clearly, for sure.

02:12:39.956 --> 02:12:40.496
Absolutely.

02:12:40.536 --> 02:12:43.058
So I think we're all expecting nothing to guarantee.

02:12:43.118 --> 02:12:59.867
But in terms of expectations of what we should be prepared for, we every state official, Department of Health official in these states needs to be prepared for greater public awareness campaigns on staying home if you have symptoms concerning for measles, because there's of course, there's an incubation period between exposure

02:13:00.607 --> 02:13:03.991
And actually testing positive can be up to a week potentially.

02:13:04.051 --> 02:13:10.618
And so being aware of your symptoms, staying at home if you're developing symptoms that are consistent with measles is critical.

02:13:11.139 --> 02:13:13.501
Also developing an understanding of when to get tested.

02:13:13.801 --> 02:13:14.722
They repeated that.

02:13:15.463 --> 02:13:17.746
Because we just saw the FDA commissioner about a week ago.

02:13:18.406 --> 02:13:29.755
say on national TV or refuse to say on national TV that the best way to protect yourself is through vaccination and to hammer home that message to parents, he missed an opportunity to do that.

02:13:29.795 --> 02:13:30.535
And so we have to emphasize that.

02:13:30.655 --> 02:13:33.738
Now, don't forget that the FDA director is a surgeon.

02:13:33.858 --> 02:13:41.103
So there is no chance that this guy is going to reevaluate the PCR as a proven diagnostic.

02:13:41.203 --> 02:13:43.725
And in fact, it's going to play a role in this show.

02:13:44.045 --> 02:13:44.706
I'm sure of it.

02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:53.534
Yeah, there was an expansion in Virginia of a warning on areas exposed to a child with measles.

02:13:54.435 --> 02:14:02.181
And as we see this continue to grow, can we remind people why the concern is so great and how easily this can spread?

02:14:02.441 --> 02:14:08.209
Well, yeah, first of all, this is probably one of the most contagious, just infectious diseases on the planet, number one.

02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:10.031
And number two, why is this important?

02:14:10.211 --> 02:14:12.754
This is more than just a skin rash, Chris.

02:14:12.814 --> 02:14:17.541
And I think that's what gets lost is often really what happens here and the concern, especially amongst kids.

02:14:18.081 --> 02:14:25.728
or of those that are older, is that what lands in the hospital, especially if they're not protected with the vaccine, is pneumonia-like complications or even swelling of the brain.

02:14:26.108 --> 02:14:28.090
And that's not just an abstract thought.

02:14:28.130 --> 02:14:31.613
That's up to 25% of people unvaccinated and exposed.

02:14:31.633 --> 02:14:34.836
So this is a serious illness, incredibly contagious.

02:14:35.417 --> 02:14:42.103
One person infected in, say, a college dorm room can infect nine other people around them within just a matter of minutes.

02:14:42.622 --> 02:14:48.045
So Donna, the Texas Tribune is reporting a statement from HHS Secretary RFK Jr.

02:14:48.125 --> 02:14:49.586
about kids who get measles.

02:14:49.746 --> 02:14:56.951
Quote, every child who gets measles gets a headline, Kennedy said during the visit alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.

02:14:57.511 --> 02:15:02.914
When I was a kid, there were two million measles cases a year and nobody wrote about them.

02:15:02.974 --> 02:15:05.416
What do you make of that from the top health official?

02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.623
Well, I think it's just highly irresponsible.

02:15:09.063 --> 02:15:25.884
When he was a kid, I was also a kid, and the United States was engaged in a very rapid school-by-school, community-by-community vaccination program, which resulted in many years of very, very few measles cases.

02:15:26.384 --> 02:15:27.244
in this country.

02:15:27.364 --> 02:15:29.445
And so it's so irresponsible.

02:15:29.605 --> 02:15:34.386
And what he puts out is that parents should educate themselves.

02:15:34.446 --> 02:15:42.308
Well, the internet is filled with disinformation about the way measles spread and the impact of vaccines.

02:15:42.428 --> 02:15:52.030
And so it's actually his message coming from HHS is saying that the federal government doesn't believe that this is a problem.

02:15:52.070 --> 02:15:54.571
And that's a really bad message to send to parents.

02:15:55.231 --> 02:15:56.011
and communities.

02:15:56.232 --> 02:16:00.974
And after all, shouldn't two deaths of children be a headline?

02:16:03.135 --> 02:16:09.978
I want to ask you about one other thing, doctor, because there's new guidance from Harvard about a booster shot for adults when it comes to measles.

02:16:10.598 --> 02:16:12.739
What do people out there watching need to know?

02:16:14.585 --> 02:16:24.158
Number one, if you do not know your measles vaccine status, which tends to actually be more people than you think, and you're worried, just get a booster shot.

02:16:24.258 --> 02:16:24.879
It can't hurt you?

02:16:24.899 --> 02:16:25.700
It can't hurt you.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:27.142
Because I keep hearing this number like 1957, 1958, what's...

02:16:29.505 --> 02:16:33.627
You know, I think part of the problem with our health... It can hurt you.

02:16:33.867 --> 02:16:35.407
And I think we're overcomplicating it.

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:42.350
So if you don't know and you were born before 1957, get a booster shot.

02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:54.154
They are telling old people if you don't know to get a booster shot, to take an intramuscular injection of a combination of substances intending to augment your immune system when you might not need it.

02:16:55.339 --> 02:17:00.112
because nobody needs intramuscular injection of any combination of substances like that.

02:17:00.172 --> 02:17:02.258
Nobody needs a baseball bat to the head.

02:17:03.308 --> 02:17:04.429
Holy shit.

02:17:05.109 --> 02:17:07.490
The vaccine status, regardless of your age, you can get a booster shot.

02:17:08.551 --> 02:17:17.116
There is this concern here that if you got the measles vaccine, say, between 1958 and 1989, was that an effective vaccine?

02:17:17.496 --> 02:17:31.504
If that's you, and you don't have titers, because many of us have titers proving immunity, if you're concerned and you know that you have two trials, you can prove your immunity by getting... Many of us have titers which prove our immunity.

02:17:32.065 --> 02:17:32.325
Stop!

02:17:32.966 --> 02:17:33.488
Lion!

02:17:35.375 --> 02:17:36.158
Stop lying!

02:17:39.353 --> 02:17:40.373
Just a simple blood test.

02:17:40.493 --> 02:17:45.414
The next time you're seeing your doctor, if you just, if you don't want to hassle with that, you can get a booster shot.

02:17:45.774 --> 02:17:55.556
And so really the bottom line here is if you're worried at all about your protection, if you have an underlying chronic illness, or you just don't remember or reward the test to prove your immunity is a hassle.

02:17:56.276 --> 02:18:01.737
If you don't want to go through the hassle of testing to prove your immunity, just get a booster.

02:18:02.377 --> 02:18:03.617
Wow.

02:18:04.158 --> 02:18:04.578
Wow.

02:18:07.748 --> 02:18:10.450
I know it's MSNBC garbage, but people watch it.

02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:14.232
And the people who take booster shots are the ones that watch it.

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:17.615
They are the ones that need the active management.

02:18:19.936 --> 02:18:22.298
They are the problem in the population pyramid.

02:18:22.358 --> 02:18:24.179
Don't you see how malevolent this is?

02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:32.165
If we don't watch this, it makes it even more effective and it isolates them even more in this narrative where they're vulnerable.

02:18:32.898 --> 02:18:37.160
Because remember what David Frum said, nature does not give a shit about you.

02:18:37.861 --> 02:18:40.502
Sir Graham Nelson, is that me or you?

02:18:43.604 --> 02:18:44.945
It's not me.

02:18:46.246 --> 02:18:47.026
I don't see it.

02:18:48.567 --> 02:18:51.068
Just be sure I'm going to kill this thing completely.

02:18:53.590 --> 02:18:55.431
I don't bring my phone to the stage.

02:18:55.471 --> 02:18:55.671
I'm sorry.

02:19:01.793 --> 02:19:03.775
I checked my pockets before I said that.

02:19:05.977 --> 02:19:06.638
I saw that.

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:15.686
But Sir Graham Wilson said at that time he said this vaccine is a leaky vaccine and ultimately it's going to wane.

02:19:17.142 --> 02:19:21.145
And the problem, I mean, I'm gonna say, first of all, the measles vaccine works.

02:19:21.165 --> 02:19:25.127
So if you take that vaccine, you're unlikely to get measles.

02:19:25.167 --> 02:19:26.628
You're much less likely to get measles.

02:19:26.928 --> 02:19:36.495
The measles vaccine works is a very specific lawyer chosen statement to say nothing of the MMR vaccine.

02:19:36.575 --> 02:19:37.895
Make sure you understand that.

02:19:37.955 --> 02:19:42.538
If anything, this guy is a lawyer and he knows exactly what he's saying when he says it.

02:19:43.619 --> 02:19:44.480
Measles, then if you don't,

02:19:45.898 --> 02:19:49.780
and HHS continues to recommend that vaccine.

02:19:51.021 --> 02:20:00.546
But there are problems with the vaccine, and the problem is really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination, and it was never safety tested.

02:20:01.667 --> 02:20:09.271
That combination was never safety tested, and people just assume that if the three separate vaccines were safe,

02:20:10.788 --> 02:20:12.790
And when you combine them, they would also be safe.

02:20:12.810 --> 02:20:13.470
But we now know.

02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:21.056
So now he just said that the three vaccines, the measles, the mumps and the rubella vaccine were safe, but now they put them in the same vaccine.

02:20:21.076 --> 02:20:21.557
Do you see?

02:20:24.839 --> 02:20:25.920
It's really bad.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.583
Ladies and gentlemen, these people are not playing for our team.

02:20:29.643 --> 02:20:31.184
They are just reading the script.

02:20:31.244 --> 02:20:31.885
They are given.

02:20:31.945 --> 02:20:35.568
And the script is becoming very malevolent because the truth is getting out.

02:20:35.868 --> 02:20:37.209
There's some viral interference.

02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:39.291
And, um,

02:20:40.157 --> 02:20:48.049
And the combination vaccine seemed to be... He also said viral interference there, which is just appalling.

02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:54.478
Linked to a lot of adverse events that they were not getting from the separate vaccines.

02:20:56.259 --> 02:21:03.123
The mumps part of the vaccine was... That is the exact Andrew Wakefield bullshit story that we heard 20 years ago already.

02:21:03.223 --> 02:21:03.603
Wow.

02:21:03.863 --> 02:21:05.084
It has never worked.

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:16.809
It was actually Merck, which made the vaccine, was sued recently in a whistleblower case by the lab technician who was ordered to commit fraud.

02:21:17.189 --> 02:21:18.330
His name is John Crailing.

02:21:19.689 --> 02:21:26.241
And that case was thrown out on a technicality, but we learned a lot about that vaccine that is disturbing.

02:21:26.301 --> 02:21:31.211
And what we're seeing is we're seeing a lot of mumps cases in older people.

02:21:32.634 --> 02:21:41.364
which would be a paradoxical effect of the vaccine because the childhood mumps is usually a benign disease.

02:21:42.325 --> 02:21:46.349
And if you get it when you're older, it can cause sterility and a lot of other adverse events.

02:21:46.369 --> 02:21:50.974
So we're now, for the first time, nobody's ever looked at the safety science on these before.

02:21:51.114 --> 02:21:54.498
But do you recommend people take the MMR vaccine?

02:21:55.103 --> 02:21:59.267
We are recommending that at this point, but we're also doing studies on it.

02:21:59.407 --> 02:22:21.687
Okay, you're checking it out, but... After 20 years, after having cracked the code, thanks to Heather Fraser, on the peanut allergy epidemic, and what he lists in the foreword of this book, and it's third printing by the organization called Sky Horse Publishing,

02:22:24.898 --> 02:22:45.882
He lists autism, ADD, ADHD, SIDS, OCD, ASD, narcolepsy, sleep and seizure disorders, neurodevelopmental delays, autoimmune diseases, and tics all to the vaccine schedule.

02:22:49.262 --> 02:22:53.323
And 10 years later now, eight years later, after a pandemic,

02:22:55.774 --> 02:23:02.319
of lies and murder, that's where we are.

02:23:03.159 --> 02:23:04.140
He's gonna look into it.

02:23:05.021 --> 02:23:06.061
He's gonna figure it out.

02:23:07.182 --> 02:23:19.571
We're recommending it for now, but we're also gonna look into it because maybe one of these Ms or Ms or Rs or Ds or Ps is actually causing, maybe it's the mercury.

02:23:20.475 --> 02:23:30.612
For the meantime, you tell people... What we're saying is, if you want to avoid measles, if you want to avoid spreading measles, the best thing you can do is take that vaccine.

02:23:30.752 --> 02:23:34.959
And you are reforming the current vaccine adverse event reporting system, so...

02:23:36.207 --> 02:23:42.550
What you're saying is- He's reforming the vaccine adverse reporting system.

02:23:42.610 --> 02:23:44.411
I mean, adverse event reporting system.

02:23:44.451 --> 02:23:51.934
The one that Jessica Rose has been playing the role of Epi-Girl from the Spars document talking about for five and a half years straight.

02:23:53.315 --> 02:23:54.035
I've got to quit.

02:23:54.236 --> 02:23:55.716
This is two hours and 20 minutes.

02:23:55.776 --> 02:23:58.338
I could go on for the whole show because it just gets worse.

02:23:59.518 --> 02:24:03.100
But please understand that we are in trouble in America.

02:24:03.939 --> 02:24:20.996
We are in trouble in America because an anticipated rise in all cause mortality was sculpted using murder and lies to create the illusion of the pandemic all around the world was dependent on murder in a few places like America and Scotland and some in the UK.

02:24:21.436 --> 02:24:22.518
And that's pretty much it.

02:24:22.958 --> 02:24:26.722
That's all that's required besides a spectacular commitment to these lies.

02:24:28.835 --> 02:24:31.417
Arguing about mandates, that's some bullshit.

02:24:31.857 --> 02:24:37.001
Arguing that vaccines work or they're the greatest thing ever, that's some bullshit.

02:24:37.162 --> 02:24:40.604
Arguing about autism and its many causes, that's some bullshit.

02:24:41.125 --> 02:24:44.707
Arguing about gain of function and who's doing it is bullshit.

02:24:45.188 --> 02:24:49.171
And arguing about when AI is gonna wake up and take over is bullshit.

02:24:50.558 --> 02:24:55.080
And the reason why is because we should not be arguing for making poisoning a choice.

02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.542
We should not be intramuscularly injecting anything and calling it medicine.

02:25:01.203 --> 02:25:07.145
We shouldn't be arguing about something that is imaginary like Brian Hooker said it was in 2013.

02:25:08.186 --> 02:25:12.968
We shouldn't be arguing about something that's imaginary and really just synthetic DNA.

02:25:14.212 --> 02:25:23.982
And we shouldn't really be arguing about something that we should have done known better can be used and weaponized against us because it has been weaponized against us for generations.

02:25:24.663 --> 02:25:28.286
Now they're doing it together in concert with groups of liars.

02:25:29.367 --> 02:25:32.350
And that's a very, very malevolent cognitive trap.

02:25:32.431 --> 02:25:37.616
When three people try to lie to you, it's very, very hard to break that illusion.

02:25:38.345 --> 02:25:40.147
But the truth is available, ladies and gentlemen.

02:25:40.207 --> 02:25:41.288
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:25:41.328 --> 02:25:42.470
They just use placebos.

02:25:42.850 --> 02:25:44.332
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:25:44.392 --> 02:25:46.034
Transfecting healthy people is a crime.

02:25:46.434 --> 02:25:49.938
And the population pyramid is a problem that they are actively managing.

02:25:50.519 --> 02:25:51.360
Thanks for being here.

02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:53.402
Thank you very much.

02:25:53.683 --> 02:25:54.864
It is just a background.

02:25:54.884 --> 02:25:56.506
It's just a background.

02:25:56.526 --> 02:25:58.468
It's just biology.

02:25:59.759 --> 02:26:00.859
Seek the truth together.

02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:06.902
Life is a pattern, integrity, a trajectory across time is what's missing from this puzzle.

02:26:07.902 --> 02:26:15.665
It's an interface between composition and decomposition at the heart of that being your hyper symbiosis with bacteria around you.

02:26:17.961 --> 02:26:21.404
The way you can see this is that there are no bacteriophage diseases.

02:26:21.464 --> 02:26:25.867
That's weird because bacteriophages are free to move wherever they want to.

02:26:25.887 --> 02:26:28.028
They're the most abundant signal in nature.

02:26:28.829 --> 02:26:38.376
Mitochondria are your endosymbionts and Peyer's patches and antibodies are probably really integral in maintaining that symbiosis.

02:26:40.851 --> 02:26:42.692
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

02:26:43.032 --> 02:26:46.515
Mitochondria being endosymbionts is not my idea, that's Lynn Margulis.

02:26:47.055 --> 02:26:59.783
And Peyer's Patches versus Rhizophagy, that's been more my thing, but the idea of a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time is really an idea that goes all the way back to Buckminster Fuller.

02:26:59.823 --> 02:27:07.528
So hat tip to him, and hat tip to his book, which is over there on my desk, Children of Earth, To the Children of Earth, great book.

02:27:08.635 --> 02:27:10.296
I'm trying to work on my own version of that.

02:27:10.696 --> 02:27:11.637
We can think our way out.

02:27:11.697 --> 02:27:13.038
Let me be your biology coach.

02:27:13.518 --> 02:27:16.000
I'll see you as soon as the gym opens again.

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:17.041
I'm going to start filming.

02:27:17.081 --> 02:27:17.981
I'm so fired up.

02:27:18.602 --> 02:27:19.822
Uh, thanks very much for being here.

02:27:19.843 --> 02:27:24.886
If you want to be alerted to when the stream is going to happen a few minutes beforehand, you can send an email here.

02:27:25.386 --> 02:27:27.107
Um, that's also communicating with my wife.

02:27:27.167 --> 02:27:28.248
If you just want to say hi.

02:27:28.929 --> 02:27:31.230
Um, and if you want to share the stream, please share it here.

02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:32.691
Stream.GigaOM.Bio.

02:27:33.031 --> 02:27:36.414
I'm a terrible weatherman, but, uh, I'm a great biology teacher.

02:27:36.434 --> 02:27:37.194
Thanks for being here.

02:27:37.234 --> 02:27:38.195
See you guys again soon.
