00:16.806 --> 00:22.787
If I'm a young player coming into the league today, I would really focus on the defensive end of the floor and look at Scottie Pippen.

00:22.907 --> 00:24.248
I mean, this guy was a genius.

00:24.568 --> 00:34.990
His ball pressure, playing passing lanes, blocking shots, taking charges, and he played with a passion on the defensive end of the floor like, no, this is the most exciting part of the game to me.

00:35.010 --> 00:40.051
All right, so here again, Scottie's initiating the action.

00:40.891 --> 00:43.112
He's making Mark work to bring the ball up the floor.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.052
Okay, that's one.

00:44.895 --> 00:48.916
Now, where he's pushing him, he's pushing him into situations where Mark can't really attack.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.717
Right here, you got Michael sitting here waiting, right?

00:54.058 --> 00:55.198
That area's clogged up.

00:55.498 --> 00:56.499
There's nowhere for him to go.

00:56.779 --> 01:01.360
Scotty's fully aware of that, so he knows he can put a lot of pressure on him in these areas, because there's nowhere for him to drive.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.701
So now, where is Mark looking, right?

01:03.721 --> 01:05.641
He's looking for these curl actions here.

01:05.661 --> 01:10.923
Yeah, he couldn't run the play, right?

01:11.043 --> 01:12.243
Scotty took the play away from him.

01:12.644 --> 01:13.704
Here, he cuts the angle off.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.180
Now Mark says, okay, I gotta attack him.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.800
He's bodying up on me, I'm gonna attack him.

01:18.561 --> 01:19.461
Mark attacks him here.

01:19.481 --> 01:25.124
But now Scotty, you know, sensing that Mark wants to feel the contact, right?

01:25.144 --> 01:27.305
Cause Scotty's been bodying him this whole time.

01:27.365 --> 01:29.866
So now Mark seeks the contact and Scotty just backs up.

01:31.487 --> 01:32.387
Scotty just backs up.

01:32.627 --> 01:34.328
I mean, that's just brilliant defense.

01:35.691 --> 01:36.892
I mean, think about that for a second.

01:36.912 --> 01:39.233
I mean, he's bodying Mark the whole game.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.634
Body him, body him, body him.

01:40.674 --> 01:46.158
Now Mark's looking for Scotty's body and Scotty just moves back and lets Mark lose his balance.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.321
That's a game of cat and mouse right there.

01:56.705 --> 01:59.587
Okay, again, you know, Scotty's making the reads.

01:59.627 --> 02:00.568
He knows this action.

02:02.268 --> 02:02.748
He knows it.

02:02.948 --> 02:03.448
Here it is.

02:03.569 --> 02:04.869
He knows the ball comes back there.

02:04.909 --> 02:07.970
He knows they're looking for Starks coming off of a double screen on the weak side.

02:08.510 --> 02:10.671
So he tries to get his hand in that passing lane.

02:10.711 --> 02:11.311
He misses it.

02:12.052 --> 02:17.874
But this shows me that he is keenly aware of the actions that are taking place out here on the floor, which means he prepares.

02:18.934 --> 02:22.455
So if I'm this draft pick coming into the league, I know I got to do my homework.

02:22.495 --> 02:24.456
Homework could give you all the answers, right?

02:27.017 --> 02:28.178
Scotty knows what's coming there.

02:29.218 --> 02:31.859
Right now, this is unbelievable.

02:32.995 --> 02:34.357
Look at all the ground this guy covers.

02:35.678 --> 02:38.201
Here, down, there.

02:41.525 --> 02:42.686
This is the activity.

02:43.587 --> 02:45.109
He plays defense with an energy.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.232
Too many players today play defense just to play defense.

02:48.273 --> 02:49.734
He's attacking these offensive players.

02:50.495 --> 02:51.376
He's going after it.

02:52.417 --> 02:53.839
He's playing with an energy out there.

02:55.973 --> 03:05.622
If I can learn how to cut angles off like Scottie, be aggressive on a defensive end the floor like Scottie, I think they'll just take my game and the team that drafts me to an entirely different level.

03:07.403 --> 03:09.986
For more analysis, go to detail on ESPN+.

03:29.313 --> 03:41.425
you you

03:57.042 --> 03:59.764
Let me see if I can fix that audio for everyone.

03:59.864 --> 04:00.665
Good morning.

04:00.685 --> 04:02.826
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

04:03.026 --> 04:07.209
I am a chief biologist at GigaOM Biological, coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:08.510 --> 04:12.032
You can figure out who I am because I am on the internet as that name.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.653
Welcome to the show.

04:15.155 --> 04:22.299
Today we are going to work on Biology 101, which is not really the same normal show that I do.

04:23.640 --> 04:31.056
um we are gonna try and start a new thing and uh if i might admit it it's a it's a big

04:32.819 --> 04:35.061
It's a big thing to start a new thing.

04:35.862 --> 04:52.418
And so it is with great trepidation that I am starting the new Biology 101 and going to try and get everybody to understand what I'm trying to mean with a pattern integrity across time, a trajectory across time.

04:52.438 --> 04:56.501
I think biology is definitely the way out, but it's a new biology we're going to need.

04:57.342 --> 04:59.785
This is a new biology 101 journal club.

04:59.865 --> 05:07.514
So we are actually going to, we have a paper up on this up on the website in the in the link called stuff.

05:08.775 --> 05:16.544
So if you go to gigaohmbiological.com, and you look up at the links on the top, the farthest one to the right, or

05:17.344 --> 05:27.292
If you're using a pull-down menu because your screen's too small or because you're on your phone, then it will be the last thing in the menu, which is titled Stuff.

05:27.932 --> 05:31.255
And actually, this link is also on the bottom of every page.

05:32.256 --> 05:40.682
And so when you click on Stuff, you'll see the things that we've been working on from the Biology 101 texts to some legal stuff to read.

05:42.103 --> 05:45.066
There's also the Journal Club from today, which is the

05:47.256 --> 05:51.859
Sorry, I might have my ears a little high and maybe that's why my voice is a little low.

05:51.939 --> 05:53.580
I'll try to kick it up a little bit here.

05:56.181 --> 05:59.864
This is the same message, but it's the other side of it, right?

06:00.764 --> 06:05.727
In my normal work or the work that I have been trapped into doing, I feel is necessary to do.

06:07.574 --> 06:23.863
The message is that this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of Earth, and that actually a large swath of the thinking American public is in one way or another under the spell of an anti-vaccine movement that's actually fake.

06:24.778 --> 06:39.377
And it is part and parcel for the same kind of governance theater that we typically think of happening only on news programs and only on Fox News or only on MSNBC.

06:39.397 --> 06:43.082
But actually, this fake anti-vaccine movement is crucial.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.790
Um, for this, this, this thing to have happened.

06:48.250 --> 07:05.157
Um, and, and I, I think it's really important to understand that's why I'm going to continue to do shows, um, which will explain how these murder and lies, um, were committed, how this, you know, pre existing anticipated rise in all cause mortality was used.

07:06.215 --> 07:10.317
to create a mythology that they intend to enslave our children with.

07:10.377 --> 07:17.541
And so I think in my other streams, I have tried very hard to, let me add this over here.

07:17.561 --> 07:19.903
I have tried very hard.

07:19.963 --> 07:21.904
That's still not really adding anything there.

07:22.204 --> 07:23.865
Ooh, let me get this over here.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.386
Yes, that's that one.

07:26.086 --> 07:27.127
And this is that one.

07:27.787 --> 07:31.009
And then I could also probably do this.

07:33.505 --> 07:34.746
RNA cannot pandemic.

07:35.266 --> 07:39.968
Using intramuscular injection to administer medicine to healthy people is wrong.

07:40.028 --> 07:53.653
And that is something that I think the new biology 101 should provide the model that in theory edifies that idea.

07:54.505 --> 08:11.608
If intramuscular injection is a very, very ridiculous way to administer medicine, that it's essentially like hitting someone in the head with a baseball bat, especially children, then there should be a pretty easy way to explain

08:12.972 --> 08:17.034
a model of biology wherein that statement makes sense.

08:17.234 --> 08:33.661
Because right now, our model of biology that includes viruses and vaccines and public health and quarantine and vaccines for the young and the old and for the middle-aged, these things don't work there.

08:34.801 --> 08:41.424
In fact, the main presumption is that intramuscular injection is one of the best ways to administer medicine.

08:43.891 --> 09:02.325
And so this final statement, the Human Genome Project has just begun, I think that's also something that if there is a new Biology 101 to teach, at the foundation of it should be this concept that the Human Genome Project isn't a milestone that was hit, it was a milestone that was defined.

09:04.363 --> 09:22.411
and maybe not even defined but sort of codified or conceived and conceptualized and laid out as a plan when the Human Genome Project was said or declared to be done on the cover of Nature in early 2000s.

09:26.678 --> 09:31.682
Now, in order to make the progress that we need to make, I guess I must have clicked something over here.

09:33.224 --> 09:52.220
We need to get rid of this bad biology 101, which is again, at the heart of this, this background that has been misconstrued as a spread and a novel virus and the need for lockdowns and masks and, and a, a group of people on white horses to come and save us.

09:53.496 --> 09:57.982
This bad biology 101 is all at the foundation of that.

09:58.122 --> 10:05.671
And one way to think about biology 101 in the simplest terms possible is that evolution because DNA.

10:05.691 --> 10:10.938
If I expand that a little bit more, evolution and the whole idea

10:13.294 --> 10:28.826
that we are the emergent properties of physics and chemistry with a little lightning and a mud puddle and lots and lots and lots and lots of time and solar energy, we are in existence.

10:29.186 --> 10:37.132
And it is despite all of the forces in nature which would work against the ever increasing complexity

10:38.522 --> 10:45.091
over billions of years that apparently because we found DNA is absolutely sure to be true.

10:47.054 --> 10:54.465
That's really the essence of this Bad Biology 101 because all of those assumptions are taught in those books.

10:56.715 --> 11:13.929
When you're taught as a biologist, or a budding biology student in high school, and then when you're taught again in college, you are essentially taught twice the same thing, one time, the second time in more detail, that evolution, because DNA.

11:15.302 --> 11:16.042
That's where you get.

11:16.522 --> 11:17.883
That's the end of biology 101.

11:18.403 --> 11:26.145
If you understand that evolution is real and the main evidence we have for it is DNA and genes, then you understand biology 101.

11:26.665 --> 11:29.946
You're ready to be indoctrinated into everything else.

11:34.467 --> 11:43.929
And so I think that that was part of the reason why the murder and lies were possible and why it was possible for this data to be available

11:46.072 --> 11:49.894
this data to be available, but no one to be able to see it.

11:49.934 --> 11:51.635
We lost control of pneumonia.

11:51.695 --> 11:53.036
How the hell did we do that?

11:56.677 --> 12:02.160
And the reason why people couldn't see it is because of this Biology 101 is so bad.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.942
Everyone's Biology 101 is so bad that

12:06.400 --> 12:18.128
dumb, simple explanations or stupid, complicated explanations can be used and weaponized against people and children can be bamboozled and their parents can be lied to.

12:19.228 --> 12:32.437
And so the way we get out of it is a new Biology 101 where people and kids, more importantly, really understand life as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

12:34.056 --> 12:50.951
Once children are growing up with that model of themselves in their head, they will see themselves as sacred enough and that trajectory to be sacred enough to be afraid to perturb it.

12:51.812 --> 13:00.240
And instead they will spend their entire lives exploring ways to optimize it.

13:01.121 --> 13:10.247
Because that's what our kids should be looking to do from the moment that they grow up until the moment they blossom into puberty until the moment that we can declare them adults.

13:10.827 --> 13:19.553
They should have been actively seeking ways to optimize their trajectory across time.

13:23.018 --> 13:43.115
And if we taught children how to think of themselves, their bodies, and their minds as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time that they can contribute to, that they can nurture, that they can optimize, we're going to end up with teenagers that are beautifully in shape, with a wide variety of skills and interests.

13:45.897 --> 13:50.701
We're not going to end up with a bunch of teenagers on phones all sharing Snapchat videos.

13:52.281 --> 14:11.677
That's my vision for high school kids that understand themselves and understand what responsibility comes along with that tremendous opportunity to optimize their trajectory across time, to enhance it.

14:14.073 --> 14:16.114
And so that's what I think a biology coach can do.

14:16.174 --> 14:17.495
I think we can think our way out.

14:17.515 --> 14:20.017
We can think, everybody can think their way out of this.

14:20.077 --> 14:22.018
In the end, it's not going to be my idea.

14:23.239 --> 14:30.944
It's never my, there's books all over the place in this room that every time I open them, I'm thinking, wow, how in the world have I heard this before?

14:32.486 --> 14:35.848
And none of the ideas that I'm going to present to you over the next few weeks are mine.

14:35.868 --> 14:38.910
A lot of them come crazy enough from Joshua Lederberg.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.541
And that didn't work the way that I wanted it to.

14:47.641 --> 14:47.941
Darn it.

14:47.961 --> 14:48.601
What happened here?

14:49.902 --> 14:54.724
This was supposed to have an animation.

14:54.784 --> 14:55.404
Darn it.

14:57.425 --> 14:58.665
Why did that not work?

14:59.445 --> 15:00.246
Let me just fix this.

15:00.306 --> 15:00.586
Sorry.

15:00.606 --> 15:01.826
I want to be able to do this right.

15:01.886 --> 15:04.687
And this will be a useful slide anyway later.

15:04.707 --> 15:05.908
Ctrl-Z.

15:05.928 --> 15:10.770
Hey, let's see how fast I can do things in PowerPoint.

15:14.904 --> 15:15.744
Why didn't that do that?

15:15.784 --> 15:17.025
I thought I sent that up already.

15:17.045 --> 15:18.586
That's weird.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.926
I must have done that with this one then.

15:20.246 --> 15:21.667
No, that one's also not there.

15:21.727 --> 15:23.688
Okay, well, I got to do this one then too.

15:24.568 --> 15:27.809
I'll just do it right away so that it's done.

15:28.069 --> 15:30.710
From the left, click.

15:31.351 --> 15:31.971
There we go.

15:32.151 --> 15:34.112
Okay, so let's start here again.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.110
So what I want to do is help you think your way out.

15:39.150 --> 15:42.553
I want to teach people how to teach their kids how to think their way out.

15:42.593 --> 15:48.859
And more importantly, I want to teach parents how to teach their kids to think about themselves.

15:48.899 --> 15:51.561
And I think, you know, even think about this in the 90s.

15:53.123 --> 15:57.206
when they were telling us your brain on drugs and then they were frying an egg in a pan.

15:57.226 --> 16:04.912
What if they just told you that your body and your mind is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

16:04.952 --> 16:14.599
And so it's, you're kind of obligated to wait until most of that trajectory and direction is determined before you start fooling around with things.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.482
And then maybe you can fool around with things, who knows?

16:18.562 --> 16:20.704
But if you just told people the truth,

16:21.892 --> 16:26.375
about the potential dangers of disrupting a trajectory across time.

16:28.017 --> 16:34.021
Then children would grow up respecting themselves and their bodies in a very different way, right?

16:34.081 --> 16:35.803
I mean, do you see my point?

16:37.424 --> 16:44.209
And so Bad Biology 101, this evolution because DNA has a few things at its center that everybody needs to understand.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.771
First of all, DNA equals genes.

16:46.891 --> 16:49.153
Okay, I gotta move this over a little bit, I apologize.

16:49.173 --> 16:51.235
There we go.

16:52.631 --> 17:05.957
So DNA equals genes, this is already something that we, Mark Kulak and others that are helping us work through this have seen the transition happen because it was already set up.

17:06.037 --> 17:15.781
So they were already thinking about the concept of genes and inheritance and a unit of inheritance already before the molecule of DNA was discovered.

17:16.874 --> 17:37.961
And the discovery of DNA meant to these people that their concept of genes and inheritance of bits of information and then the random mutation of those bits of information being the substrate for evolution.

17:38.001 --> 17:38.441
Do you see?

17:38.481 --> 17:39.442
This is important.

17:40.322 --> 17:46.224
Because evolution, because DNA, is a really important thing to understand.

17:47.168 --> 17:55.033
If we're gonna go forward with the new biology 101, you need to see how bad the bad biology 101 really is.

17:55.153 --> 18:05.459
If evolution, because DNA equals genes, which means that already, and think about how magic this is with six words.

18:06.613 --> 18:22.844
If you count DNA as a word, with six words I'm already able to explain to you the enchantment because built in here is the assumption that the discovery of DNA means evolution by mutation of genes is real.

18:24.505 --> 18:25.426
It explains everything.

18:27.727 --> 18:28.588
That's why we're here.

18:29.268 --> 18:30.829
That's why we're surrounded by bugs.

18:32.550 --> 18:34.211
That's why we all have DNA.

18:34.452 --> 18:34.912
That's it.

18:34.992 --> 18:35.933
That's their answer.

18:36.846 --> 18:42.745
And if that's wrong, think about how much sacred biology just goes poof.

18:44.727 --> 18:56.417
And think about how hard it is for your children to think of themselves and understand the responsibility and the opportunity they've been given by their creator if you start with this bad biology.

18:56.457 --> 18:59.300
The second thing is that genes cause disease.

18:59.360 --> 19:12.491
That's of course what all these people are talking about when they say that we've got to screen 100,000 genomes because I'm a clinical pathologist and I want to figure out how diseases occur, like, you know, Alzheimer's and stuff.

19:14.133 --> 19:24.860
They want to talk about genes causing disease near the end of the trajectory through time.

19:28.097 --> 19:37.245
They want to talk about cancer being caused by genes when it happens at the end of a trajectory across time.

19:37.325 --> 19:43.571
Think about how absurd it is that that is also part of bad biology 101.

19:44.132 --> 19:47.635
That's how people think on TV and social media.

19:47.655 --> 19:50.858
That's how they argue with that assumption.

19:52.870 --> 19:54.490
Genes create potential.

19:54.550 --> 20:02.412
So it doesn't mean that if you have the gene, you're going to get the disease because it's a whole selection of genes that work together.

20:02.452 --> 20:10.374
And so the best we can do is correlate these individual digits with the disease.

20:11.674 --> 20:16.416
This is as far as we are because again, evolution, because DNA, they're kind of trapped.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.056
They're kind of trapped with that explanation.

20:20.096 --> 20:22.197
They're kind of trapped with those questions.

20:24.437 --> 20:28.459
And genes are the nature of nature versus nurture.

20:28.519 --> 20:33.622
Now, nature versus nurture is a very old, almost passé argument at this point.

20:33.662 --> 20:37.724
I don't even know if Kevin McKernan is old enough to have ever even heard this argument before.

20:38.304 --> 20:46.769
But nature versus nurture is this idea that your genes or your heredity contributes something to the adult animal

20:47.609 --> 20:59.292
and also the nature, the nurture, so the environment and for your parents and what happens to you and the chemicals you're surrounded by during development.

21:00.892 --> 21:09.854
And of course, nature versus nurture is not very far off from the idea of a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

21:10.034 --> 21:16.636
It's essentially arguing and discussing the importance of nature being genes

21:19.352 --> 21:27.235
versus nurture being the environment, you know, like your parents and the food you eat and blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.897
Okay, so this is where we are with Biology 101.

21:31.397 --> 21:35.319
If you get that, then basically you got the whole first year of biology in a nutshell.

21:35.979 --> 21:37.800
First high school year for sure.

21:43.652 --> 21:47.273
I did get the email about the car guy.

21:47.313 --> 21:50.314
That's something I'm going to look into later this afternoon, actually.

21:50.354 --> 21:50.974
Thank you very much.

21:53.234 --> 22:02.497
So, I guess the alternative question then would be for the biology coach, what is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time?

22:02.577 --> 22:06.317
So, let me just give you a couple ideas of where I want to take this.

22:07.258 --> 22:12.399
But first, just to remind you that the TV is out there.

22:13.134 --> 22:21.162
The beekeeping industry is in crisis over the shocking and unexplained deaths of hundreds of millions of bees over the last eight months.

22:21.863 --> 22:33.854
It could impact all of us, as bees, called the backbone of agriculture, are responsible for pollinating more than a third of the nation's crops, and current losses are unsustainable.

22:34.515 --> 22:37.318
Janet Chamleon has more on this stinging decline.

22:39.134 --> 22:39.614
Stinging decline.

22:39.634 --> 22:42.015
This is what an unfolding disaster looks like in the U.S.

22:42.095 --> 22:43.235
beekeeping industry.

22:44.476 --> 22:54.678
Each of these hives can hold as many as 80,000 bees, but for reasons no one can pinpoint, the bees in all these hives and tens of thousands more have turned up dead.

22:55.018 --> 22:56.439
Have you ever seen it this bad?

22:56.579 --> 22:57.619
Never, not even close.

22:57.819 --> 23:01.580
The data is showing us that this is the worst bee loss in recorded history.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.541
Blake Shook is one of the nation's top beekeepers.

23:06.089 --> 23:09.991
He owns Desert Creek Honey and several other beekeeping businesses.

23:11.352 --> 23:15.934
One of them is rebuilding dead hives and he's receiving an alarming number of them.

23:16.314 --> 23:17.095
Where are they from?

23:17.115 --> 23:19.496
Yeah, these are from North Dakota that we're looking at right here.

23:19.955 --> 23:24.540
Over there we've got Florida, back here we've got Georgia, I've got California over in that corner.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.662
Bees play a critical role in U.S.

23:26.702 --> 23:27.423
food production.

23:27.903 --> 23:34.309
In addition to making honey, they pollinate 75% of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables grown in the U.S.

23:34.930 --> 23:37.673
That's $15 billion worth of crops.

23:38.293 --> 23:42.758
If this is a multi-year thing, it'll change the way we consume food in the United States.

23:43.308 --> 23:45.129
That's a pretty significant statement.

23:45.289 --> 23:45.709
It's huge.

23:46.310 --> 23:46.690
It's huge.

23:46.730 --> 23:56.475
I mean, if we lose 80% of our bees every year, the industry cannot survive, which means we cannot pollinate at the scale that we need to produce food in the United States.

23:56.856 --> 23:59.377
So what's causing the deaths, and why now?

23:59.957 --> 24:04.960
So these are dead bees in there, and they have always an identifier for a project.

24:05.380 --> 24:09.022
Juliana Rangel is an entomologist at Texas A&M University.

24:09.522 --> 24:11.984
She showed us the lab where they've been studying the bees.

24:12.684 --> 24:17.908
One potential explanation is that over the last few years, we've seen some locations across the U.S.

24:17.928 --> 24:20.770
that have had lower forage available for bees.

24:21.291 --> 24:27.495
So when they're supposed to be blooming, let's say in April, they're blooming either earlier in the year or later in the year.

24:27.615 --> 24:33.720
And so we have these food deserts, basically, in the summer and fall that the bees sometimes cannot withstand.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.762
Back at Shook's Bee Farm... Here we go with the hood.

24:37.082 --> 24:39.544
We suited up for a look at his commercial operation.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.072
Okay, you ready?

24:41.153 --> 24:41.353
Yep.

24:41.694 --> 24:46.229
Alright, the first thing we do is smoke the entrance and that calms the bees down.

24:46.761 --> 24:48.622
This is what a healthy hive looks like.

24:48.902 --> 24:52.244
And then in the center here, this is where the baby bees are raised.

24:52.544 --> 24:57.367
These just returned from California, where the bees were used to pollinate almonds.

24:57.888 --> 25:02.050
Why are honeybees so essential to pollinating the almond crops?

25:02.450 --> 25:05.812
With honeybees, almonds produce 2,000 to 3,000 pounds per acre.

25:06.052 --> 25:08.854
Without bees, they produce 200 pounds per acre.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.776
So there is no almond crop without honeybees.

25:12.165 --> 25:20.833
Beekeeping groups say the losses may put as many as 25% of commercial operations out of business by year's end, with wide-reaching impact.

25:21.033 --> 25:26.398
I got a call from a friend who has 20,000 beehives at the start of winter, and he's at less than 1,000.

25:27.759 --> 25:28.620
And he said, this is it.

25:29.481 --> 25:35.108
And this guy's just collecting their beehives and he's going to rebuild them here and he's got a big factory that's packaging honey.

25:35.148 --> 25:36.830
So I'm not really sure what's going on.

25:37.571 --> 25:40.255
Anyway, the point is, is that the bees are collapsing.

25:40.295 --> 25:41.837
We heard this a few years ago, too.

25:43.058 --> 25:45.419
And they don't really have an explanation.

25:45.879 --> 25:50.960
Her explanation, which was something about there being food deserts or something like that.

25:51.240 --> 25:56.782
I, I'm not buying that one because they're also talking about pollinating food crops.

25:56.942 --> 25:59.382
And in those cases, a lot of times the bees are moved.

25:59.903 --> 26:02.443
So I'm, I'm still not buying it anyway.

26:02.463 --> 26:08.205
I'm going to resume the show and show you that it's also on, you know, they're, they're bombarding everybody with it.

26:08.285 --> 26:10.005
It's on the Saturday morning show.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.706
It's on the afternoon news.

26:13.347 --> 26:14.848
and the evening weekend news.

26:15.948 --> 26:24.414
Tonight, the beekeeping industry is in crisis over the shocking and unexplained deaths of hundreds of millions of bees over the last eight months.

26:24.734 --> 26:35.041
Now, this could impact all of the U.S., as bees, called the backbone of agriculture, are responsible for pollinating, get this, more than a third of the nation's crops.

26:35.401 --> 26:39.004
CBS's Janet Shamlian in Savoy, Texas, has the story.

26:41.235 --> 26:44.096
This is what an unfolding disaster looks like in the U.S.

26:44.156 --> 26:45.297
beekeeping industry.

26:46.537 --> 26:48.198
Each of these hives can hold as many as 80,000.

26:48.998 --> 26:53.980
Now you can see right there, basically recycling the same thing over and over again on the news.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.641
And you got to ask yourself, why?

26:55.701 --> 26:58.142
Is it really because the bees are going away?

26:58.162 --> 27:02.844
Or is it because of something bigger, something more interesting?

27:03.644 --> 27:07.065
And that's what I just want to seed in this little thing.

27:07.665 --> 27:09.926
Remember what I said, maybe I should show you that.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.746
Maybe I'm just going to escape here for a second.

27:12.526 --> 27:16.927
Fire this up and go to GigaOM at home here.

27:17.728 --> 27:20.448
Bring this over this way and show you.

27:20.548 --> 27:23.589
OK, look, here's the home site, GigaOMBiological.com.

27:24.218 --> 27:29.099
And if you go to stuff right here, can you see that finger you push to stuff?

27:29.139 --> 27:31.439
And then here's the journal club.

27:31.519 --> 27:47.722
We're going to talk about this bee microbe review and this rhizophagy review tomorrow as two examples of the kind of thing that are, I think, kind of the unifying phenomenon in a new biology 101.

27:49.022 --> 27:50.363
I'm nervous about this, you know?

27:50.483 --> 27:51.763
I'm nervous about this because

27:52.694 --> 27:58.038
You know, maybe if it's a good enough idea, people will even want to, you know, try to pretend it was theirs.

27:58.478 --> 27:59.779
But I think this is...

28:02.861 --> 28:08.204
This idea and these ideas belong to Joshua Lederberg and Buckminster Fuller.

28:08.644 --> 28:16.127
And there's just too many people that came before me that have made it possible for me to even arrive at these ideas.

28:16.848 --> 28:25.572
And I'm really excited just to share them with you after having them in the background for so long and not really understanding how I was going to get them out.

28:27.270 --> 28:33.693
Just be sure you understand this Twitch video is going to disappear immediately and the YouTube video is going to go private immediately.

28:33.733 --> 28:37.775
This will only remain in Biology 101 on PeerTube.

28:39.275 --> 28:46.018
So the important thing, I think, to understand with regard to what is, there's the question up on top, right?

28:46.779 --> 28:49.900
What is a pattern integrity with the trajectory across time?

28:49.960 --> 28:54.662
If we're going to explain this to our kids, we're going to have to give them the tools to understand it.

28:54.722 --> 28:56.083
And in old

28:57.499 --> 28:57.625
beat.

28:58.078 --> 29:05.183
old bad biology 101 we talk about things like development and development is this trajectory across time.

29:05.223 --> 29:27.278
The annoying part of development is that it kind of starts and stops and it's supposed to have different steps in it and some of that is embryological and so it was just an imperfect word that brought about a lot of imperfect concepts and an imperfect idea because it sort of had a beginning and an end that didn't

29:28.138 --> 29:31.179
sort of coincide with the animal, and that's a little odd.

29:31.860 --> 29:35.281
And so we might try to find a different word for that.

29:35.341 --> 29:39.202
Homeostasis is another word from old biology, which might work.

29:39.742 --> 29:44.264
It might be okay to use it if you understand it in the right context.

29:44.304 --> 29:53.708
So I think two or three more important concepts to have in mind when you think about what is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

29:54.648 --> 29:58.030
And just think about this amorphous thing behind me here.

29:58.850 --> 30:00.111
It's a pattern integrity.

30:00.431 --> 30:05.453
It's kind of this wormy thing with colors and bands that you can see are changing with some balls in there.

30:06.114 --> 30:09.015
It's a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

30:11.550 --> 30:20.077
And so what's happening in this thing are the balls are coming in, the stripes are coming in and breaking up, the waves are coming in and breaking up.

30:20.717 --> 30:26.522
And so you might think about big terms in a new biology like decomposition and synthesis.

30:28.083 --> 30:33.468
Perhaps it's a better way, I'm still debating this, what we should call a decomposition and composition.

30:34.994 --> 30:43.138
But synthesis is an old word from the old biology and so maybe we should change it to composition.

30:43.158 --> 30:50.202
I think I like that better.

30:50.782 --> 31:01.847
So decomposition and composition are at the center of what I would call a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

31:04.565 --> 31:13.533
I'm trying my best to define something as simply as possible so that the most people can get close enough to the finish line today already.

31:14.614 --> 31:22.701
So a pattern integrity, you can kind of think of it as a whirling, amorphous form, you know, like us.

31:23.541 --> 31:30.287
If you thought about you and you sped the film of you up from birth to death over the course of 20 minutes,

31:31.568 --> 32:00.295
now you're kind of getting the idea of what a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time is and and all those frames of that movie that go by in 20 minutes those are the trajectory across time that's smeared across 80 years if you're lucky and during that entire time right at the center of you is an interface of decomposition and composition it has to be by definition it's not

32:01.266 --> 32:11.993
And that's also how you can see a virus or a molecule, by definition, is not a pattern that's occurring at the interface between decomposition and composition.

32:12.033 --> 32:13.113
It's not.

32:13.233 --> 32:17.676
So it's not life, and it's not a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

32:17.756 --> 32:30.064
But when you find one, you will see that at the heart of it is an interface between decomposition and composition, between, if you want to use one of the old words, decomposition and synthesis.

32:33.126 --> 32:38.951
And finally, I would put in the middle here that the biggest word, the most important word is symbiosis.

32:40.132 --> 32:47.038
And understanding a multicellular organism as the most extreme version of symbiosis.

32:48.279 --> 32:57.367
Multicellular organisms are the most extreme version of symbiosis, but symbiosis is essential

32:58.837 --> 33:09.500
to a pattern integrity across time and symbiosis is required for there to be an interface between decomposition and composition.

33:12.141 --> 33:18.423
And now this might not make any sense, maybe it makes no sense to you right now but at the end of this course it will make more sense than

33:21.721 --> 33:26.385
it will make much more sense than bad biology because evolution, because DNA.

33:26.425 --> 33:33.570
So think about these two things as we then we're going to pivot to watching a video, which is just basically a journal club.

33:34.051 --> 33:37.714
It's a discussion about the concept of symbiosis in insects.

33:38.534 --> 33:44.980
And I just want you to digest these two basic ideas.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.823
One, there are no diseases

33:49.964 --> 33:53.526
in humans that are blamed on bacteriophages.

33:53.606 --> 33:59.129
Not one, not a few, but zero.

33:59.149 --> 34:00.970
Okay?

34:02.571 --> 34:05.392
And you can basically say the same thing for bacteria.

34:05.412 --> 34:11.996
There are basically no diseases except for food poisoning, which are based on bacteria.

34:12.076 --> 34:12.456
Zero.

34:14.926 --> 34:23.611
And the second thing is, is that bacteriophages are completely free, unrestricted passers of the gut barrier.

34:24.552 --> 34:26.473
They can go wherever the hell they want to.

34:30.815 --> 34:31.796
Just think about that.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.098
Let those thoughts digest.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.920
There are no diseases that are blamed on bacteriophages.

34:40.141 --> 34:40.701
Zero.

34:42.185 --> 34:46.087
Now add in the fact that a lot of anti-vaxxers are gut biologists.

34:50.289 --> 34:54.372
Even some of the most prominent ones right now study the gut microbiome.

34:57.854 --> 35:02.696
And there's not one disease in humanity blamed on bacteriophages.

35:02.736 --> 35:03.497
That's interesting.

35:03.537 --> 35:11.441
I wonder what Joshua Lederberg would think about that because bacteriophages are also, curiously enough, free to pass the gut barrier.

35:12.469 --> 35:17.531
The immune system, I guess, ignores them.

35:19.111 --> 35:24.773
Okay, so let's watch this video and let's see what we get from it.

35:24.793 --> 35:25.814
I'm going to take some notes.

35:25.974 --> 35:28.855
I'm very happy that I got to share those first ideas with you.

35:28.915 --> 35:37.118
Remember, if you didn't hear me earlier, I am going to make the Twitch video disappear and the YouTube video disappear and the Rumble video disappear.

35:37.879 --> 35:41.041
And this video will only remain available on PeerTube.

35:41.081 --> 35:42.402
That's just the way it is, folks.

35:43.423 --> 35:46.245
We're gonna go to full screen here, and then we're gonna hit play.

35:46.725 --> 35:47.165
Hang on!

35:47.185 --> 35:49.627
I don't listen to NIH videos at 1x.

35:53.254 --> 35:56.295
who don't know who we are, but I think this audience mostly does.

35:57.115 --> 36:02.556
We're a weekly seminar series on primarily prokaryotic topics, but other interesting science as well.

36:02.956 --> 36:04.416
And we invite you to join us.

36:04.497 --> 36:09.398
And we every year nominate our favorite people who haven't been here to come and give WALS.

36:09.438 --> 36:15.319
And we're fortunate enough to have Nancy Moran selected from that nomination for this year's WALS talk.

36:15.899 --> 36:19.643
Nancy is the Warren and Viola May Rainer Chair Professor at the University of Texas in Austin.

36:19.824 --> 36:21.545
She's in the Department of Integrated Biology.

36:21.866 --> 36:33.659
And I think most of us who have been in this field a while recognize that some of the most interesting microbiology and just interesting ideas in general come when we sort of have people from very different viewpoints and bring their science.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.441
Oh yeah, I got to push play on this one.

36:37.853 --> 36:49.177
The Department of Integrative Biology feels at this stage to me, as I'm about to present Biology 101 in a new way, it feels redundant.

36:50.697 --> 36:54.699
And in fact, I think these departments of Integrative Biology

36:56.258 --> 37:08.123
actually underscore how bad biology 101 actually is in our civilization right now because they need a department of integrative biology for goodness sakes.

37:12.385 --> 37:13.286
Okay, so here we go.

37:13.306 --> 37:17.428
Sorry, this is not gonna go well if I don't shut up and listen.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.548
It's a wonderful example of that.

37:18.568 --> 37:22.710
She got her undergraduate education at UT Austin and her PhD in Michigan in zoology.

37:23.343 --> 37:36.032
And she, I think, got interested in insects, aphids, fairly early in her career, and then incorporated the microbiome in about 1990, and really has been doing groundbreaking work on the intersection of the microbiome and insects.

37:36.592 --> 37:46.579
She was recognized with the MacArthur Fellowship in 1997, election to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, a whole long list of prizes, including a lot for molecular ecology, which is not something that us microbiologists are normally thinking about.

37:47.219 --> 37:50.781
And in 2023, received the NAS Selman Waxman Award in Microbiology.

37:53.603 --> 38:03.388
Her PhD, et cetera, she established her lab at the University of Arizona, where she did much of this work, moved in 2010 to Yale for a few years, and then moved from Yale to UT Austin, where she's been from 2013 on.

38:04.428 --> 38:05.569
So we're delighted she could come today.

38:05.609 --> 38:12.092
Now, if at the end you want more, please join us tomorrow for Lambda Lunch at 11 in Building 37 on the sixth floor.

38:12.112 --> 38:14.553
And if you don't know where to go or anything, just catch me at the reception.

38:14.733 --> 38:15.713
And there is a reception after this.

38:15.813 --> 38:16.754
Other important information.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.014
Lambda, as in Lambda phage, I guess.

38:21.154 --> 38:22.554
The CME code is on the board.

38:22.594 --> 38:22.714
It's 50096.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.776
If you are online and want to ask questions, you can send live feedback at any time.

38:28.796 --> 38:31.797
Use the send live feedback button at any time during the talk, or certainly at the end.

38:32.017 --> 38:35.138
For those of you in the room, I guess, unlike Lambda Lunch, we'll save the questions for the end.

38:35.339 --> 38:39.700
But at that point, we'll ask that you come to the microphones so that everyone, including those online, can hear it.

38:39.740 --> 38:41.080
So I'm delighted to have you here, Nancy.

38:41.100 --> 38:41.321
Thanks.

38:41.441 --> 38:43.721
This is her first visit to NIH, which tells you this is long overdue.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.662
So thank you for coming, and we're looking forward to your talk.

38:49.893 --> 38:52.796
Thanks, Susan, and thanks to everyone else who's been organizing this really fun visit.

38:52.856 --> 38:59.142
I've had a lot of great talks with people here today, and I'm looking forward to some more the rest of today and tomorrow, so I'm glad to be here and learning a lot of new things.

38:59.162 --> 39:10.713
Today I'm going to give a very broad talk to kind of cover this very broad field that's developed a lot that I've been part of really since the field started around 1990, and basically it's exploring how microbes interact with insects, and I've always loved insects.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.076
I'm one of those people from a little kid stage that loved insects,

39:13.436 --> 39:22.270
But it's been really a revelation to realize that a lot of what we see in insect biology is due to the microbes living in them, specifically bacteria, in most cases, living in them.

39:22.731 --> 39:27.839
So I'll kind of give a few of the most exciting examples, I think, to show the different ways that this happens.

39:28.820 --> 39:33.882
So insects, okay, you might not know, but they are more than half of all species that are described, of everything.

39:34.562 --> 39:35.403
They are very old.

39:35.423 --> 39:39.184
They originated really when life, when life came onto land.

39:39.244 --> 39:42.365
I mean, they're very ancient, along with the first plants on land about 450 million years ago.

39:44.306 --> 39:51.469
And they have these symbioses, but they were rarely studied until about 30 years ago when molecular tools became available for looking at them.

39:52.189 --> 39:53.970
And then there's been an incredible increase, especially since 2007.

39:54.690 --> 40:01.193
And you might recognize that year as the year when next-gen sequencing became widely available and cheaper, and it really led to a lot more studies.

40:01.213 --> 40:02.913
Wow, interesting.

40:02.953 --> 40:04.494
So in 2007, they finally started looking at

40:07.900 --> 40:09.321
insect microbiota.

40:09.361 --> 40:20.066
It sounds very similar to when Nathan Wolf got his start looking for viruses in the wild and starting all these bioweapons companies in Ukraine.

40:20.506 --> 40:36.214
It's very funny because she is admitting something here, saying something here, but doesn't seem to see the significance of it like I think a real Biology 101 would teach from the very beginning, which is what?

40:37.506 --> 40:47.209
that the whole idea of insects existing in the first place presupposes an insect symbiosis with bacteria in their gut forever.

40:48.669 --> 40:59.712
All of their ancestors going all the way back to whenever would have had this symbiosis with gut bacteria, right?

40:59.772 --> 41:05.114
That 450 million years ago, according to their long clock,

41:06.147 --> 41:13.190
right, where this sort of unstoppable force of evolution started in a mud puddle and got us all the way here.

41:14.790 --> 41:27.195
And through that whole time, although we've only been studying it for like 30 years, the assumption must be that this symbiosis is at the foundation of this biology.

41:30.227 --> 41:36.511
450 million years of it according to her calculations or timeline and her mentor's timeline.

41:38.032 --> 41:47.438
Hope I'm just being seven and you might recognize that year as the year when next-gen sequencing became widely available and cheaper and it really led to a lot more studies.

41:48.300 --> 41:52.544
And there's a huge variety of these interactions, so I'll give you some examples of the different groups.

41:52.584 --> 41:58.289
I can roughly put them into several categories, and the first one I'll talk about are what we sometimes call primary symbionts.

41:58.529 --> 41:59.670
These are obligate for the host.

41:59.690 --> 42:00.991
The host cannot develop without them.

42:01.291 --> 42:07.837
They're strictly maternally transmitted from mother to daughter, from mother to son, too, but he's a dead end, only from mothers, so just like mitochondria.

42:08.757 --> 42:11.280
The genomes are really characteristic, and I'll talk more about that.

42:11.300 --> 42:11.940
They're highly reduced.

42:13.341 --> 42:14.742
Say what?

42:14.802 --> 42:15.082
What?

42:15.662 --> 42:16.863
And examples are a couple of these.

42:16.923 --> 42:20.244
I'll talk more about the examples, especially the Buchenera and aphids, which has been a central model.

42:20.624 --> 42:22.005
So these occur a lot.

42:22.025 --> 42:23.705
They are not restricted to insects.

42:23.905 --> 42:40.772
Are you telling me that these ladies know that insects inherit strains of bacteria from their mothers, just like we inherit our mitochondria from our mothers, but they haven't gone all the way?

42:43.166 --> 42:53.989
They haven't gotten, it's almost like anti-vaxxers that say they're against vaccines, but haven't been able to say that intramuscular injection is obviously dumb.

42:55.529 --> 42:58.130
These people can't get past this?

42:59.771 --> 43:06.432
That if there was evolution, then by definition, this symbiotic relationship occurred at the start?

43:06.813 --> 43:07.073
What?

43:07.573 --> 43:08.013
How are?

43:09.900 --> 43:19.227
There is no complex life on Earth that does not have this at its foundation, and that's something that they don't teach in Biology 101.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.190
Instead, they teach the bad part, which is what?

43:23.630 --> 43:25.312
That there's DNA in all that.

43:28.574 --> 43:33.318
That those insects exist despite all of the pathogens around them.

43:35.791 --> 43:43.912
instead of in symbiosis with, instead of interdependence with, instead of by necessity in symbiosis with.

43:44.953 --> 44:03.716
It's a very subtle difference, ladies and gentlemen, but if you teach a child very early in that very subtle but shitty difference, will result in them being able to passively accept the model of an RNA pandemic and passively accept the consequences of their genes.

44:06.294 --> 44:11.658
and not understand that intramuscular injection is dumb and trust their doctors.

44:17.602 --> 44:19.203
I hope I'm making some sense here.

44:19.363 --> 44:21.065
This is going to take a long time to teach.

44:21.165 --> 44:25.448
A lot of other invertebrates or even in some fungi, but most of the cases that have been studied are in insects.

44:26.550 --> 44:28.372
And then there's a so-called secondary symbionts.

44:28.412 --> 44:30.494
And these are ones that, again, are mostly transmitted maternally.

44:30.534 --> 44:33.597
So in the lab, you can maintain them for hundreds of generations.

44:33.617 --> 44:34.918
They'll be strictly maternally transmitted.

44:35.098 --> 44:46.489
I mean, she's talking about primary and secondary transmitted symbionts, bacteria that are transmitted and that their host is interdependent on.

44:46.609 --> 44:47.370
Come on.

44:48.511 --> 44:49.432
Come on, guys.

44:51.024 --> 44:54.529
Why isn't this the foundation of High School Biology 101?

44:54.609 --> 44:57.052
Why aren't we shown all the examples of this?

44:57.092 --> 45:04.021
The other paper that you can download from my website, from the link, Stuff, is a paper about Rhizophagia.

45:04.081 --> 45:05.123
I wonder what that is.

45:08.669 --> 45:11.690
high fidelity, but we can see that in nature they're jumping around sometimes.

45:11.710 --> 45:13.411
They're horizontally transmitted in nature.

45:13.451 --> 45:15.011
We can see that by doing phylogenies and so on.

45:15.031 --> 45:17.272
And they're more dynamic in terms of their genomes.

45:17.472 --> 45:21.133
They have recombination and bacteriophage and things which are not present in the primary symbionts.

45:21.513 --> 45:24.514
A really common one of these is Wolbachia that is in insects.

45:24.574 --> 45:27.975
It's jumping around, and most insect species have had it in their history, probably all.

45:28.395 --> 45:30.436
And Hamiltonella is an example I'll talk about in aphids.

45:30.996 --> 45:35.519
And then we come to things that are more like gut symbionts and often are gut symbionts.

45:35.579 --> 45:39.341
And this category where there's host specialized symbionts, they live only in the host.

45:39.361 --> 45:41.242
They don't replicate in other environments.

45:41.502 --> 45:43.383
They're restricted to the host, but they're not maternally transmitted.

45:43.403 --> 45:45.845
They're just socially transmitted, just like our gut microbiota.

45:46.405 --> 45:53.429
And then finally, just environmental microbes that might colonize hosts, they might have a big effect on the host, but the microbes themselves live in many different places.

45:54.110 --> 45:55.511
So they haven't evolved specifically with hosts.

45:55.531 --> 45:58.352
So first I'll talk about these so-called primary symbionts.

45:59.093 --> 46:06.857
These are inherited, they're intracellular, usually, there's actually some cases where they're not, but mostly they're intracellular, and they generally live within specialized host cells.

46:07.178 --> 46:08.899
These have evolved again and again, they're called bacteria.

46:09.139 --> 46:12.741
Okay, now I'm not an expert in bacteria, but I did do a master's degree

46:14.124 --> 46:36.283
that ended up to be a Master's of the Arts, but because I didn't finish the research part of it, and that's a long story, but I did a lot of different research projects, and I just kept running into supervisors whose projects were just so bad that after I just couldn't find anybody that I wanted to work with for another year, and it just all fell apart.

46:36.303 --> 46:40.107
So I just did a few more courses and got the hell out of there and wasted a lot of money.

46:41.230 --> 46:45.855
Because I thought a master's would get me into medical school and that was just so dumb.

46:46.595 --> 46:52.661
Anyway, during that time, I did briefly work with somebody who worked on the neurobiology of praying mantises.

46:52.701 --> 46:57.326
And I spent a lot of time learning to dissect them and reading about them and understanding their physiology.

46:57.966 --> 47:00.468
And just so you know, insects are not like us.

47:00.688 --> 47:03.930
They have a very different way of circulating.

47:03.970 --> 47:08.152
Their bodies are very different, differentially organized.

47:08.232 --> 47:10.553
A lot of their neurotransmission is nicotinic.

47:10.613 --> 47:15.096
So, that's the reason why tobacco and nicotine is so poisonous to them.

47:16.697 --> 47:19.298
And so, this is kind of new to me.

47:19.578 --> 47:25.802
And so, when she says intracellular, I just think you should take bacteriocytes.

47:26.582 --> 47:33.309
Somatic cells housing symbionts have evolved repeatedly in insects and other invertebrates.

47:33.349 --> 47:36.171
So, of course, you can see where this is going, right?

47:36.231 --> 47:44.399
Our mitochondria are, and I am not the person who said this, this is a long old idea, our mitochondria are symbionts.

47:44.519 --> 47:46.862
They are not remnants of symbionts.

47:47.844 --> 47:52.287
They are not powerhouses of the cells that used to be Symbionts.

47:52.387 --> 47:56.669
They are Symbionts, is the best way to describe them.

47:57.450 --> 48:05.634
Even if they are generations from the event, or whatever you want to think of as that thing.

48:06.735 --> 48:08.076
They are Symbionts.

48:08.236 --> 48:13.439
If you see them as Symbionts rather than remnants of Symbionts, and that's the most important thing.

48:14.219 --> 48:16.761
Remnants of Symbionts, I gotta get bigger for this one.

48:17.800 --> 48:24.159
Remanence of symbionts is the idea that is required for old biology.

48:25.106 --> 48:49.052
If you want to believe that life is the result of a billion year process that went from simple to complex and you're at the end of it, then you also have to believe that this symbiotic thing that resulted in us having mitochondria occurred so far back in the future that all complex life on earth has mitochondria that are all kind of the same.

48:52.915 --> 48:56.897
And so intracellular in insects, they're fine.

48:56.937 --> 48:58.198
They're called bactericides.

48:58.958 --> 49:00.419
And so we're going to listen to them.

49:00.479 --> 49:05.682
This is the first level, the most primal of intracellular symbionts.

49:05.742 --> 49:06.763
And there's secondary.

49:06.803 --> 49:08.604
And then there's the gut microbiota.

49:09.624 --> 49:10.365
Isn't this cool?

49:13.551 --> 49:21.577
So, they're cells of the host that house the symbionts, usually in the cytoplasm, and often the cytoplasm is basically just stuffed with these bacterial symbionts.

49:22.077 --> 49:28.942
They've evolved over and over, bacteriocytes, from different cell types, and sometimes in the same insect you can have two different cell types that house different bacterial symbionts.

49:29.642 --> 49:30.603
And this is just one example.

49:30.623 --> 49:43.455
The example I'll talk most about, here's an aphid, and it has its gut, and then these yellow things are the ovarioles, and the bacteriocytes are in the body cavity here, and if you just look at one of these tiny embryos, so aphids have prenatal development, and the embryos within the mother.

49:43.715 --> 49:49.461
This is the embryo at a very early stage, and basically almost the entire embryo is the symbionts here.

49:49.501 --> 49:53.404
So basically they're a very big part of development, in many cases early embryonic development.

49:54.265 --> 49:59.490
and this is just showing the later stages, but one important point is in most cases they are actually enclosed in a host derived membrane.

49:59.510 --> 50:01.452
Remember, I'm a neurobiologist.

50:01.552 --> 50:16.867
I learned a lot about the brains of mammals, especially the anatomy of the brains, and neurons, and neuronal function, and ion channels, and ionic currents, and the electrical signals of neurons.

50:16.947 --> 50:17.127
This

50:18.174 --> 50:27.321
This stuff is, you know, there's a lot of stuff that's out there that needs to be brought together under one new Biology 101.

50:27.381 --> 50:28.922
I think it's going to be very easy.

50:28.962 --> 50:30.464
It just falls right in place.

50:31.464 --> 50:43.113
It makes perfect sense if you understand yourself more complexly than public health and the Human Genome Project would like you to understand yourself.

50:44.935 --> 50:47.477
So they're in a vacuole within these bacteriocyte cells.

50:49.178 --> 50:51.159
Well, they're still dominant in embryos.

50:51.279 --> 50:58.083
Early embryologists were looking at insect embryos and other invertebrate embryos, trying to understand development and using light microscopy.

50:58.384 --> 51:01.586
And a very prominent one who noticed these symbionts was named Paul Buchner.

51:02.146 --> 51:03.307
He was an embryologist in Germany.

51:03.587 --> 51:07.069
He documented hundreds of animal symbioses, including hundreds in insects.

51:07.469 --> 51:09.430
He had a lot of treatment of aphids in their symbionts.

51:09.650 --> 51:10.951
And this was all based on microscopy.

51:11.291 --> 51:12.292
And he came up with some ideas.

51:13.012 --> 51:16.835
One, he believed that these symbionts, this type of symbiont, was providing nutrients to the host.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.317
He believed that they were ancient, and these hosts had evolved with him a long time.

51:20.837 --> 51:26.481
And he believed that the host was in control, that these were kind of passive things at this point, and that the host was in control of the symbionts.

51:26.901 --> 51:28.202
He sort of argued this.

51:28.402 --> 51:32.905
His work was translated into English in 1965 in a big book that has all of this kind of ideas in it.

51:33.145 --> 51:38.028
These were mostly right, these ideas, but he had a lot of wrong ideas also in that book because obviously he couldn't know

51:38.348 --> 51:40.310
It's nice that I don't have that book.

51:40.471 --> 51:41.952
I'm looking forward to finding it.

51:42.012 --> 51:48.900
So I think this is quite interesting and the idea of who's controlling who is very interesting.

51:50.062 --> 51:52.505
I don't think that's the right way to think of symbiosis.

51:52.565 --> 51:55.829
I think the idea is that there are always trade-offs.

51:57.259 --> 52:00.580
And I think I would credit Thomas Sowell for that idea.

52:00.640 --> 52:04.980
You know, you can think of social and economic problems as always being trade-offs.

52:05.460 --> 52:08.301
And I don't think that's a bad model for biology either.

52:09.661 --> 52:16.102
And symbiosis is a series, a set of mutually beneficial trade-offs, I think.

52:17.202 --> 52:25.624
But, you know, I'm here to explore the ways that these ideas have been expressed before and to try and

52:26.892 --> 52:29.519
and make sure we don't throw anything out that's already useful.

52:29.679 --> 52:30.521
A lot about what was going on.

52:31.772 --> 52:32.673
So what have we learned since then?

52:32.933 --> 52:37.977
So I'll be using this aphid Buchenera, named after Paul Buchner, symbiosis as a kind of central model.

52:37.997 --> 52:39.898
It really probably is the most studied model of this.

52:40.419 --> 52:46.944
And so in 1989, Paul Bellman at UC Davis was the first to characterize an unculturable symbiont using DNA sequencing.

52:46.984 --> 52:52.949
He used PCR, which was relatively new at the time, and then actually cloned and sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA.

52:53.849 --> 52:58.613
He then gave this bacterium a name, and he noticed that it's close to E. coli.

52:58.633 --> 53:00.675
It's in the same group of gamma proteobacteria.

53:03.036 --> 53:04.896
Luckily, he called me up one day and said, do you want to work on this?

53:04.936 --> 53:12.078
Because I was working on aphids, and I started working with him and dropped the other things I was doing, and ever since then have primarily worked on symbionts.

53:12.118 --> 53:18.000
In 1993, we did some work looking at... So, notice how parallel this is to virology.

53:18.200 --> 53:21.021
It is an unculturable symbiont.

53:21.943 --> 53:28.946
that they then looked at using DNA sequencing, and she said they just sequenced the ribosome, which I know she said it.

53:28.986 --> 53:30.267
I don't know if that's what she means.

53:30.827 --> 53:33.388
Again, think about how much work this is we have to do.

53:34.388 --> 53:36.129
This is me being a biology coach.

53:36.169 --> 53:38.990
I'm trying to show you what I do with my day all the time.

53:39.511 --> 53:45.453
When you open one of these little boxes of goodies, you find a lot of reading.

53:47.034 --> 53:51.296
And right now, just dissecting that little bit of what she said there.

53:53.700 --> 53:55.522
I mean, that's, this is remarkable.

53:55.763 --> 54:01.430
It's remarkable because look, it's the first to characterize an unculturable symbiont.

54:02.191 --> 54:11.482
That is absolutely the same bullshit that they pull with RNA virology, where it's an unculturable virus.

54:13.049 --> 54:29.242
that they have to make a clone of, a pure DNA quantity that they say accurately represents the quantity that they found, the phenomenon that they identified with sequencing in the original unculturable preparation.

54:30.983 --> 54:41.071
Very similar to what a lot of these no-virus people have been focused on for five years, but unfortunately for them, they've been so hyper-focused on it that they never got here.

54:46.701 --> 54:53.904
the phylogenies for these symbionts and comparing those to phylogenies of the host, and it turns out that the host and symbiont phylogeny map onto each other exactly.

54:54.244 --> 55:05.389
So in other words, they've evolved together, and when speciation occurs in the host, you get divergence in the corresponding symbiont, which is what you'd expect if it's strictly maternal, but the timescale is what's impressive, because these are very old groups.

55:05.409 --> 55:10.591
So aphids based on fossils are at least 150 million years back before that common ancestor.

55:10.711 --> 55:13.632
I like what Catherine put in the chat.

55:14.632 --> 55:16.513
I'm just going to see if I can do this really quick.

55:17.593 --> 55:20.275
She says a lot of unculturable, look at that, I can do it.

55:20.756 --> 55:24.259
A lot of unculturable bacteria strains in soil.

55:24.839 --> 55:33.766
I think that's true, but think just, I'm just gonna try and suggest thinking in a different way.

55:34.387 --> 55:44.515
There's lots of genetic evidence that the diversity of bacteria in soil is extreme.

55:45.825 --> 56:05.573
Whether or not that means that there are all these different strains that don't grow, it might just be that you can't grow very many of these things by themselves and get a homogenous signal that you can go, oh yeah, there's all kinds of Toyotas in that dish.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.033
Maybe that's not possible.

56:08.174 --> 56:08.794
Part of this

56:09.864 --> 56:11.465
And I'm just throwing this out there.

56:11.545 --> 56:21.611
Part of this is to try and make sure that we go back far enough in this observation chain to make sure that we're, you know, not already on the wrong road.

56:21.671 --> 56:25.073
Essentially, you know, we're in a maze and we don't know how far back we've got to go.

56:25.113 --> 56:32.537
We don't go back too far that we missed the turn, but we have to go back far enough so that we're not still trapped.

56:33.517 --> 56:34.958
And this is pretty remarkable.

56:34.978 --> 56:35.959
I love this.

56:38.973 --> 56:42.836
And then in 2000, the first symbiont genome was sequenced.

56:42.856 --> 56:46.298
This was early in genome sequencing days, and by Shigenobu et al.

56:46.338 --> 56:48.580
in Japan, and they sequenced Bucnara of P. aphid.

56:49.580 --> 56:53.984
And since that time, there were more than 12,000 papers on Bucnara and aphids alone.

56:54.124 --> 56:58.247
So there's really been a lot of work on this system, but as you'll see, there's still a lot we really don't know.

56:59.327 --> 57:05.652
So the problem I should mention about these symbionts is they can't be cultured in the lab, and that is why we knew so little about them.

57:06.792 --> 57:07.892
So Bucnero, we got a genome.

57:07.972 --> 57:08.613
What was it like?

57:08.733 --> 57:09.713
Well, it turned out to be tiny.

57:09.753 --> 57:13.014
It was 580 encoded proteins, about 600 kilobases.

57:13.435 --> 57:19.217
It looks just, surprisingly at the time at least, it looks just like a reduced E. coli genome, basically a subset of E. coli genes.

57:19.697 --> 57:24.399
There were only two sort of novel orphan genes, and that remains to be the case with many more Bucnero genomes.

57:24.419 --> 57:24.739
Of course.

57:25.339 --> 57:26.480
So many, many gene functions.

57:26.640 --> 57:31.444
Of course, E. coli is the bacteria, one of the bacteria that are in our guts.

57:31.864 --> 57:35.427
And we really need to look at this question with fresh eyes.

57:35.607 --> 57:37.188
Do we understand it?

57:37.848 --> 57:43.252
What those rainbow-colored pictures that Sabine Hazan puts on all of her

57:44.093 --> 57:52.935
all of her talks and pretends that she has a very stupid, complicated explanation for what those colors mean and whether or not those bands are big or small.

57:52.975 --> 57:55.516
And if there's lots of bands, it's better than few bands.

57:56.516 --> 57:59.117
And it's bifidobacteria or whatever she says.

57:59.637 --> 58:10.260
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not by accident that the fake anti-vaccine movement in America has always had someone there to curate the gut narrative.

58:10.440 --> 58:10.960
And now

58:11.536 --> 58:14.838
They have even more people there to curate the gut narrative.

58:15.859 --> 58:39.015
It's because they are still defending the bad biology 101, evolution because DNA, and this whole idea that they can take control of the evolution of the species that goes all the way back to bad, bad old books about it, when they didn't have all this nonsense biological mythology to back up their ideas.

58:42.571 --> 58:44.072
I'm not going to get through this in time.

58:44.112 --> 58:46.013
I can see that already, so I'm just warning you.

58:46.033 --> 58:46.513
We're lost.

58:46.973 --> 59:00.140
Most regulatory genes, most transporters, most DNA repair genes, and also many genes involved in making the cell envelope, peptidoglycan, LPS, and phospholipids, many of those were missing as well.

59:00.720 --> 59:05.383
What was retained, it still retains all the genes for translation, so we're making a ribosome.

59:05.683 --> 59:12.766
tRNA synthetases, DNA polymerase, you know, so replication, transcription, and translation, basic machinery for that is retained.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.507
So, it's still like a cell in many ways.

59:15.127 --> 59:23.090
And then the other thing it retains, kind of impressively given how small these genomes are, are some biosynthetic pathways that are basically what is needed by the host.

59:23.170 --> 59:25.691
So, Buchner had hypothesized they're making nutrients for the host.

59:25.871 --> 59:26.752
That turns out to be true.

59:27.112 --> 59:29.353
And in the case of Buchnera, it's making amino acids.

59:29.873 --> 59:34.718
essential amino acids, so the ones that are essential for animals broadly, including us, but also including insects.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.943
On the right here, so aphids feed on phloem sap.

59:39.343 --> 59:47.612
It's basically a sterile diet that has a lot of sugar in it, and it has free amino acids, but the amino acid profile is very unbalanced from the point of view of animal nutrition.

59:47.632 --> 59:50.756
It's got all these non-essential amino acids, kind of the cheap amino acids,

59:51.497 --> 01:00:03.652
And then the essential amino acids, which tend to have the longer pathways and require more ATP to make them, those are the ones that animals in general have lost, and those are the exact set of pathways that Bupnera has kept, so complementary to what the aphid could do.

01:00:05.177 --> 01:00:18.268
So interestingly, she says that these pathways, metabolic pathways, are often lost by animals and filled in by bacteria, or in this case, I guess, bacteriocytes, right?

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:23.952
Cells that have obligate symbionts in them that are descended from bacteria.

01:00:23.992 --> 01:00:25.934
This is crazy, ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:25.974 --> 01:00:30.638
This is a silly amount of language to describe the

01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:41.773
a pattern integrity that occurs at the interface of decomposition and composition with a trajectory across time.

01:00:43.093 --> 01:00:43.493
That's it.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:48.155
And when you understand it in that way, what does the bacteria do?

01:00:48.215 --> 01:00:53.117
They provide, it's the interface between decomposition and composition.

01:00:55.378 --> 01:01:00.940
You are carrying around a compost heap in your gut and you're not sick.

01:01:03.973 --> 01:01:07.714
You're basically burning, breaking things down.

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:17.875
Chemical bonds are breaking, but in a very controlled manner so that you don't take them all the way down to useless and extract what is necessary.

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:30.998
These are not simple processes that involve you eating at Chick-fil-A and your gut absorbing everything good and rejecting everything not, and then what everything is rejected comes out the other end.

01:01:31.498 --> 01:01:33.198
It is a spectacularly

01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:44.917
well-orchestrated metabolic process where a symbiotic relationship between metabolic symbionts occurs.

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:52.742
And it's not a antagonistic one, where if the bacteria had their way, they would destroy you.

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:57.425
Or if barriers break down, they're going to destroy you.

01:01:57.485 --> 01:02:00.767
Those are all wrong ways of thinking about it.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.971
incorrect ways of thinking about it.

01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:22.443
And I think we can start to put together a better way of thinking about it if we start to teach our children that they are indeed pattern integrities, which is something that occurs and sustains a form, but needs to take things in and requires energy to be there.

01:02:23.023 --> 01:02:23.944
And at the heart

01:02:25.552 --> 01:02:34.095
of any pattern integrity is this interface between decomposition and composition that if the balance is not maintained is unhealthy.

01:02:35.156 --> 01:02:40.077
But maintaining that balance is part of optimizing that trajectory across time.

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:47.280
And that's what it means to be human.

01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:51.662
I think it's really brilliant.

01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:52.983
I think it's really beautiful.

01:02:53.163 --> 01:02:55.124
And then some other work by Paul Bauman's lab.

01:02:55.444 --> 01:02:58.666
We don't have to deny the biology that's out there.

01:02:58.686 --> 01:03:04.210
We have to reclassify the observations and recategorize them and rearrange some books.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:13.556
And then there's a lot of books we have to throw away, but most of them have an SP on the back of their spine, and so they're easy to find in libraries.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:16.538
Back then, and also a lab in Spain, Andres Moya,

01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:28.531
Bupnera genome also includes some plasmids, and those plasmids are devoted to making extra copies of some of the genes that limit the rate of production of tryptophan and leucine, two of the essential amino acids.

01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:32.175
So it seems like specific adaptations to better produce for the host benefit.

01:03:34.164 --> 01:03:38.008
And so since that time, many, many of these nutrient provisioning symbionts have been found.

01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:43.493
And people have done phylogenetics in our lab and other labs to show that these are ancient in the host.

01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:48.178
And a lot of features, major features in the lifestyles of insects are due to these symbionts.

01:03:48.478 --> 01:03:49.860
So example, if you wonder why.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.262
I just see a nice question in the chat, and I thought I would address it.

01:03:54.342 --> 01:04:02.667
So if you spray your salad with E. coli and you adjust it, will that increase your E. coli enough to make you sick when we should be sick already with E. coli in us?

01:04:02.687 --> 01:04:04.287
Well, remember where they sit, right?

01:04:04.427 --> 01:04:05.348
It's a compartment.

01:04:05.448 --> 01:04:06.108
It's a place.

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:08.950
And it's that balance.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.211
I mean, that's what makes it so magical, right?

01:04:11.331 --> 01:04:13.192
It's how do we do that?

01:04:13.292 --> 01:04:14.313
How is that happening?

01:04:14.373 --> 01:04:16.234
How is that not at the center?

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:19.938
of what we understand about our biology.

01:04:20.038 --> 01:04:33.427
How is that not central if the bacteriophages of that compost heap are free to move through our body and interact with our system?

01:04:34.928 --> 01:04:42.653
Then it's not just bacteria on the other side of a wall that we're holding back and hoping that they don't get through.

01:04:44.654 --> 01:04:46.456
What happens in payers' patches?

01:04:47.352 --> 01:04:48.293
with those bacteria?

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.754
What happens at M cells?

01:04:50.274 --> 01:04:51.535
What's happening in the gut?

01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:53.416
What happens in rhizophagy?

01:04:53.456 --> 01:05:02.442
What happens in these relationships with insects and bacteria in these different stages of symbiosis, these different levels of

01:05:05.007 --> 01:05:06.169
Can you see it coming already?

01:05:06.229 --> 01:05:07.471
I think it's just gorgeous.

01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:22.449
It's just the most beautiful thing that the pandemic gave to me is this new way of seeing the world, new way of seeing my kids, a new way of motivating my kids, a new way of explaining and seeing the world.

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:23.691
It's just extraordinary.

01:05:26.132 --> 01:05:27.553
Beetles sometimes are very hard.

01:05:27.573 --> 01:05:28.434
They have that hard cuticle.

01:05:28.654 --> 01:05:33.538
They have a symbiont that makes extra tyrosine, which is a substrate for making melanin, which is what makes beetles hard.

01:05:34.058 --> 01:05:37.161
And then cockroaches, they live on nitrogen-poor diets.

01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:43.045
Their symbiont recycles the cockroach's own nitrogen waste, the uric acid, and then also makes amino acids.

01:05:43.465 --> 01:05:45.147
And then white flies are sort of like aphids.

01:05:45.387 --> 01:05:49.030
They need amino acids because they, essential amino acids, because they feed on phloem sap.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.492
But in this case, they also make carotenoids for white flies.

01:05:53.653 --> 01:05:55.834
And because I'm at NIH, I want to mention something relevant to health.

01:05:56.214 --> 01:06:05.499
So these kind of symbionts also occur in a lot of insects, important to human health, because insects that feed on blood generally are not getting B vitamins that are required in insect metabolism.

01:06:05.539 --> 01:06:10.082
So bedbugs, they have a special version of Wolbachia that makes B vitamins, these lovely things.

01:06:10.802 --> 01:06:19.907
Body lice have another type of symbiont from the gamma proteobacteria that, again, makes B vitamins, but otherwise has this reduced genome and all these features that are similar to what I described for Bucnera.

01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:25.050
And then tsetse flies have a symbiont called Wigglesworthia, and it also makes B vitamins required for the host.

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.651
So these are all blood-feeding insects.

01:06:28.432 --> 01:06:30.192
So in some groups, it gets really complicated.

01:06:30.232 --> 01:06:33.354
And Buchner had a favorite group, which he called the Fairyland of Symbiosis.

01:06:33.935 --> 01:06:35.996
And it's a group of plant sap-feeding insects.

01:06:36.376 --> 01:06:37.456
And it's the okinorhynchus.

01:06:37.496 --> 01:06:38.457
It's called the clade.

01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:39.337
And they feed.

01:06:39.558 --> 01:06:40.338
There's a huge number.

01:06:40.378 --> 01:06:42.879
There are leafhoppers, cicadas, spittlebugs, all these planthoppers.

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.081
So all of these, you've all seen them a lot.

01:06:45.121 --> 01:06:47.342
And they're major agricultural pests in some cases.

01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:48.783
And there's a lot of species of them.

01:06:49.383 --> 01:06:54.305
Well, it turns out that they can have up to three or four different symbionts in the same insect living in different types of bacteriocytes.

01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:56.026
And very commonly, they have two.

01:06:56.506 --> 01:07:12.692
And it turns out with, you know, lots of work by some of the people in my lab, including John and Gordon shown here, that working out phylogenies and where these bacteria live and looking at, we can see that they colonize a couple of bacteria were in the common ancestor of this whole group, about 260 million years, and then diversified with them, but in some cases,

01:07:13.272 --> 01:07:16.214
As long as we're still talking with the chat, I'm almost done here.

01:07:16.274 --> 01:07:17.235
It's well, it's one 30.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:18.736
I can keep going for a while yet.

01:07:19.616 --> 01:07:29.723
Um, if, uh, it's not that there are, it's not that there are strains that are beneficial or not beneficial in my imagination.

01:07:29.943 --> 01:07:38.989
What I think you should be thinking about is the idea that you inherit and you, you develop a,

01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:41.827
compost heap in your gut.

01:07:42.288 --> 01:07:53.062
And that is a consequence of the people that raise you, the people that you're around, the food that you eat, you know, everything, the amount of poop you get in your mouth, the whole thing.

01:07:54.384 --> 01:07:54.544
And

01:07:56.790 --> 01:07:59.472
I don't think it's impossible.

01:07:59.633 --> 01:08:10.041
For example, the thing that's cited in the chat is the E. coli family is large and there are beneficial strains for the human gut and toxin producing strains that kill humans but are benign in cattle.

01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:24.493
I would suggest that we at least imagine the possibility that if you took that strain from the cattle and you exposed a child, a newborn child to that bacteria as part of their breastfeeding,

01:08:25.214 --> 01:08:29.077
that they might develop a gut bacteria closer to that of a cow.

01:08:29.658 --> 01:08:47.353
I could be completely wrong but I want you to think on that as a concept to understand how this symbiosis might have occurred from your day of birth until you were an adult and how that trajectory through time might have been optimized or not optimized.

01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:56.537
Think about how that trajectory across time might've been optimized or not optimized by the intramuscular injection of vaccines, for example.

01:08:57.358 --> 01:09:09.067
That's where I think this, again, I'm trying to edify the biology that I think got us here and sparked this whole re-imagination of Biology 101 in the first place.

01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:16.433
And that is that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent to augment a healthy human

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.580
is really ridiculous.

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:40.690
And I think if you understand your child and yourself has a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, whose trajectory could be optimized by exercise and nutrition and lack of stress and love and friendship, now you're getting closer.

01:09:42.449 --> 01:09:49.171
Because one of them would be lost and replaced by yet a different bacterium that sort of moves into the system and occupies a new cell type, a new type of bacteriocyte.

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:52.391
There's a bit of turnover, but there's sort of this tapestry of symbionts coming and going.

01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:55.872
So this really would have been a dream of Buchner to work out this kind of history.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:58.713
He actually kind of speculated about these kind of events.

01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:09.615
And what we can do that Buchner couldn't, sequencing genomes of these, it turns out that when you look at a pair of these symbionts that are in the same host, they have exactly complementary nutritional capabilities.

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:12.016
So especially in terms of amino acids, which is the main thing they make.

01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:18.682
Okay, just let me make sure for for six girl in the chat, not arguing with you.

01:10:18.722 --> 01:10:23.506
And I'm certainly not claiming to know what would happen or what has happened or what has been tested.

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:28.810
If that is the case, then what you may have is a

01:10:30.672 --> 01:10:39.121
a symbiotic specificity that supersedes this idea that I'm thinking of as a more general symbiotic relationship.

01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:45.388
And in that case, all that means is that this is even more important to understanding

01:10:45.988 --> 01:11:01.515
ourselves as a pattern integrity because it's not just, you know, whatever gut bacteria is in there, but it is essential to understand that symbiotic relationship as part of this trajectory across time and trajectory across generations.

01:11:01.555 --> 01:11:02.236
And I like that.

01:11:02.276 --> 01:11:03.076
I'm fine with that.

01:11:03.116 --> 01:11:04.397
I'm totally fine with that.

01:11:05.557 --> 01:11:18.627
In fact, I think it, in a lot of ways, makes the idea of a new Biology 101 in this kind of context of symbiosis at the interface of decomposition and composition a really compelling idea.

01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:19.928
So, thanks for arguing with me.

01:11:19.988 --> 01:11:20.809
I appreciate that.

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:28.464
So you'll have one making eight of the essential amino acids, the other one making two.

01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:30.586
Or you'll have one making seven, the other one making three.

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:37.533
And they pair up and basically the redundant pathways that must have been present when they first entered the symbiosis, when they all had all the pathways, get lost.

01:11:37.553 --> 01:11:41.257
And so you pair it down to the host has these pathways, each symbiont has a complementary set.

01:11:41.457 --> 01:11:46.683
Those really fit together very beautifully and really kind of gave you confidence in using genomics to understand what's going on.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.744
So one thing that's unexpected in all of this that I mentioned briefly is these are tiny genomes.

01:11:53.024 --> 01:11:56.126
In fact, the tiniest known cellular genomes are in these insect symbionts.

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.088
The record is 120 KB.

01:11:58.108 --> 01:11:59.989
I think it's 130 protein coding genes.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:04.473
It's the bare minimum for making a ribosome translation

01:12:05.073 --> 01:12:07.854
transcription, replication, and making a few nutrients for the host.

01:12:08.474 --> 01:12:10.215
And so we keep discovering these.

01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:11.155
They evolve over and over.

01:12:11.415 --> 01:12:15.056
This is just showing a graph of genome size and number of protein-coding genes in bacteria.

01:12:15.096 --> 01:12:15.596
It's really nice.

01:12:15.936 --> 01:12:17.257
One KB, one gene on average.

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:20.438
But the tiny insect symbiont genomes are down here.

01:12:20.638 --> 01:12:21.818
So very, very small.

01:12:22.618 --> 01:12:24.119
Bucnara itself was not at all the smallest.

01:12:24.439 --> 01:12:25.739
Many smaller ones were found later.

01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:27.840
We found a number of those in different insects.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:34.064
For a little while, all the smallest genomes of cellular organisms were from Tucson, Arizona, where my lab was, because we'd just go out and find them.

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:35.064
It was nothing about Tucson.

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:42.549
They're all over the world, but it was just a matter of discovering them and then figuring out, using the benefit of next-gen sequencing, that these things were out there.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.091
So, how do these things work?

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:53.616
Okay, so again, she states that next-generation sequencing is what is allowing this to happen, and next-generation sequencing is a lot of hocus-pocus.

01:12:54.861 --> 01:12:56.281
It's metagenomic sequencing.

01:12:56.321 --> 01:12:58.802
It's a lot of hocus pocus based on assumptions.

01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:08.944
Assumptions about, you know, distinct strains, assumptions about none of those signals being phage signals, assumptions about all kinds of stuff.

01:13:10.444 --> 01:13:17.686
And yet, despite that, at least their model of this

01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:22.219
pattern integrity, this symbiosis is better.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:34.582
I guess, you know, one of the things to think about with insects is their genetic diversity and whether or not you can even think of a single insect as an individual upon which evolution can act relative to a human.

01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:39.504
Maybe that's one of the biggest gifts that we've been given as a

01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:50.257
as individuals is that we are able to act on our own future and change and build things that we can leave to our children.

01:13:50.738 --> 01:13:51.919
And insects don't do that.

01:13:51.979 --> 01:13:53.001
Plants don't do that.

01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:56.145
And evolution doesn't have that built into it.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:01.652
like we as humans have been given that gift.

01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:22.582
And so think about how important it is that old, the bad biology 101 essentially takes that gift away from you because it says that evolution, because DNA, which means you are just a blip in time, and you are obviously obligated to contribute to the whole, which is the species.

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:44.850
and the evolution of it and where we go in the future, rather than thinking about, you know, what you can contribute to our understanding of this irreducible complexity and our appreciation for it and, and, and, and make sure that the, the sacred nature of ourselves is passed on to our children as opposed to lost.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:49.294
And instead, you know, this bad biology is used to enslave our kids.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.480
I really am happy with where I'm at.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.882
I don't know if this video is really helping me anymore.

01:14:55.902 --> 01:14:59.264
The host has evolved a lot to control and support these symbionts.

01:14:59.304 --> 01:14:59.904
We can tell that.

01:15:00.304 --> 01:15:07.968
What we don't know is the real mechanisms and just the experimental limitations of these systems are really great because we can't grow the symbionts separately from the host.

01:15:08.409 --> 01:15:15.292
But using genomics and transcriptomics and things, we've done a lot of work trying to look at what genes are expressed in the bacteriocytes.

01:15:15.653 --> 01:15:18.234
How do those change during the life cycle of the bacteriocytes?

01:15:18.254 --> 01:15:26.440
And so now again, I just want to point out some of the assumptions that she's making because of the Bad Biology 101 frame that this all has to sit in.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:40.910
The assumption is that there are genes and that they can sequence those genes and monitor their change, even though sequencing itself is a probabilistic result, even though sequencing itself is a model

01:15:41.963 --> 01:15:47.869
that says that we can read a single molecule by making millions of copies of it.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.152
And it's a pretty high fidelity process.

01:15:50.192 --> 01:15:56.619
That's a giant assumption that they were already ready to make already 20 years ago and are still making now.

01:15:58.939 --> 01:16:03.621
And it's assumption based on the idea that genes were always there.

01:16:03.681 --> 01:16:05.482
We were always going to find genes.

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:16.006
And as soon as we found DNA, that meant everything else that we thought about evolution, the whole process, the timeline, the incremental mutations that led to us.

01:16:16.546 --> 01:16:17.847
They all have to be true.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.188
It's just a matter of whether we're going to find them because we found DNA.

01:16:26.098 --> 01:16:30.902
and of the symbiosis within an individual host lifetime, and how does those work together?

01:16:30.922 --> 01:16:41.169
And I won't go into details, but I'll just mention that there are these very clear coordinated shifts in what genes are being expressed in the symbiont and in the host and the bactericide in which it resides.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:48.955
And so we have shifts in metabolism to different states, and it seems to be coordinated and predictable through the life cycle of the aphid.

01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:52.678
So how this happens, what molecules are going back and forth, there's a lot that we don't know about.

01:16:52.978 --> 01:16:55.481
What molecules are going back and forth?

01:16:55.561 --> 01:17:04.012
Gee, I wonder what signaling process is a bacteria or some symbiotic remnant of a bacteria would use to communicate with its host.

01:17:07.694 --> 01:17:28.013
and of course we can end it right here i think that's a perfect place to end i didn't think she would say that that's that's just wonderful we don't know what it is it's just like denny rancor saying you know we have this sustained increase in all-cause mortality but i got no idea where it came from it's just like having a having somebody like nick hudson who's an actuary say the same thing it's just

01:17:28.633 --> 01:17:30.535
It's just absurd, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:30.575 --> 01:17:33.497
It's absolutely absurd where we are.

01:17:34.158 --> 01:17:35.859
This has been Biology 101.

01:17:36.039 --> 01:17:41.464
I hope that this is going to help people understand a little bit about where this is going.

01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:48.730
Tomorrow we're going to have a little better and a little thicker discussion of this and some of the evidences there.

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:52.933
So please take a look at those two journal club papers that I attached.

01:17:52.973 --> 01:17:56.376
If you want to see the rest of this video, I wonder if I can do that for you.

01:17:57.699 --> 01:17:59.360
I saw somebody ask that question.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.384
Let me just bring this over to the other side here and then I'll check that out.

01:18:04.464 --> 01:18:05.485
I think I can do it.

01:18:05.525 --> 01:18:06.826
I think I found it on YouTube.

01:18:06.906 --> 01:18:10.689
So let me just go and see if I got a history that I can follow here.

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:12.631
Is it going to let me switch?

01:18:12.791 --> 01:18:13.511
Yes, it is.

01:18:16.794 --> 01:18:19.176
And history here.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:24.000
And let me search that and see if I can find insects.

01:18:28.812 --> 01:18:58.065
search uh no i'll i'll i'll find it it's a it's i i have it in the folder so maybe i can find the name of the folder hold on one second i'm sorry this is annoying i get it um this is is it here darn it now i'm stalling out killing the end of the show darn thing um

01:19:00.011 --> 01:19:01.395
I don't remember where I stored it.

01:19:02.539 --> 01:19:05.227
Darn, darn, darn, I'm failing miserably here.

01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:07.775
Might be in that folder.

01:19:21.826 --> 01:19:22.506
I can't find it.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:23.747
I'll find it later.

01:19:23.847 --> 01:19:24.548
Oh yeah, here it is.

01:19:24.608 --> 01:19:31.151
It's called The World of Insect Bacterial Symbiosis, What We Have and Have Not Learned.

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:37.035
The World of Insect Bacterial Symbiosis, What We Have and Have Not Learned.

01:19:37.095 --> 01:19:39.576
And it's an NIH discussion.

01:19:39.716 --> 01:19:41.938
I can't remember the name of the YouTube channel.

01:19:42.038 --> 01:19:42.738
Anyway, sorry.

01:19:42.758 --> 01:19:44.179
That's the best you get today.

01:19:44.999 --> 01:19:47.421
What is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time?

01:19:47.461 --> 01:19:49.182
I want you to start thinking about

01:19:52.074 --> 01:20:00.449
a interface between decomposition and synthesis, which we are now going to call, I think we've decided we're going to call it composition.

01:20:02.633 --> 01:20:04.275
Composition.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:25.380
And more importantly, symbiosis and a spectrum of symbiosis, a continuum of symbiosis that goes from ecosystems, you know, all the way to a multicellular organism and understanding that that is a continuum.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:31.902
It's not like you're either symbiotic or you're not, or you're a parasite or you're not, or you're, you know, you're in the food chain or you're not.

01:20:32.062 --> 01:20:34.422
All of these things are old biology.

01:20:34.442 --> 01:20:36.223
We're going to start first and foremost

01:20:36.843 --> 01:20:51.344
had thinking about a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time as occurring at the interface between decomposition and composition and what is required for that interface to exist is a complex symbiosis.

01:20:54.639 --> 01:21:01.290
And so if you want to teach your kids this, you can start teaching your kids that they are responsible for optimizing their trajectory through time.

01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:08.641
In fact, a lot of people who are good at that and end up being good at that end up to be pro-whatevers.

01:21:09.977 --> 01:21:11.098
Because that's how it works.

01:21:11.798 --> 01:21:14.960
Skill is an optimization across time.

01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:20.764
Piano playing, basketball, reading, exercise.

01:21:20.984 --> 01:21:26.327
We've got to optimize our trajectory across time and we've got to teach our children to see themselves as that way.

01:21:26.387 --> 01:21:28.849
See their lives as an opportunity of that nature.

01:21:29.329 --> 01:21:31.050
A responsibility to their maker.

01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:35.873
Ladies and gentlemen, if you like this work, please go to GiggleAndBiological.com and find a way to support it.

01:21:35.913 --> 01:21:37.354
We need every little bit we can.

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:46.548
We do have some big supporters out there that keep kicking it down and making us able to get across the finish line.

01:21:46.588 --> 01:21:51.016
But I don't want to, and I don't think it's right, and I don't think I can.

01:21:52.445 --> 01:22:08.583
Rely on those people forever given how much they give on some months And so please if you can who just find a way ten bucks a month would be fantastic But even just a small one-time donation would be great, but even better if

01:22:09.326 --> 01:22:13.789
What would be really great is an army of people that are just sharing the work.

01:22:14.489 --> 01:22:21.473
And this work will be archived at stream.gigaohm.bio under the Biology 101 channel, which you can find at that home.

01:22:21.933 --> 01:22:25.035
And then we can talk about this stuff at gigaohm.bio as well.

01:22:25.295 --> 01:22:28.017
We're still working on the download thing.

01:22:29.376 --> 01:22:33.277
Is not going to be fixed until the next version of PeerTube, which kind of stinks.

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:42.359
And so I'm not sure really how to figure that out right now, other than I probably have to cut some clips on my own and give Jeff a break for a little while.

01:22:42.859 --> 01:22:46.220
And hopefully we'll get a pretty quick update and it'll be a small one.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.741
And I'm sure that we can get that up as soon as that's available.

01:22:51.501 --> 01:22:52.962
Again, thank you very much for being here.

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:57.063
Really really do appreciate everyone in the chat.

01:22:57.803 --> 01:22:58.643
I am reading them.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:22:59.104
Sometimes.

01:22:59.144 --> 01:23:03.405
I just can't always respond and Let's see.

01:23:03.465 --> 01:23:04.045
What should we?

01:23:05.205 --> 01:23:14.208
What should we play out with I guess this one's alright So, thanks very much guys see you again tomorrow

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.338
Okay, I couldn't find the Pontiac video.

01:25:01.378 --> 01:25:02.440
I promise I look for it.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.241
I'll find it soon.

It's just in the wrong folder.

01:25:04.463 --> 01:25:05.746
I think I moved it on the archive.

01:25:05.766 --> 01:25:06.327
Thanks very much.

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:06.828
See you later.
