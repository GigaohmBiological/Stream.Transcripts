00:07.928 --> 00:08.709
Okay.

01:09.051 --> 01:09.711
uh so

01:49.909 --> 01:56.141
I still have trouble figuring out how I transition from one to the other.

01:56.161 --> 01:58.626
Let me see if this works.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.081
Good morning, everybody.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.002
Welcome to the show.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.464
This is GigaOM Biological.

02:05.524 --> 02:07.005
This morning we are doing Biology 101.

02:07.566 --> 02:08.807
This is the second class.

02:10.288 --> 02:23.778
As I informed you yesterday, or rather Tuesday, in our first discussion, I intend to approach this biology course unlike any biology course that I myself have had or taught before.

02:24.939 --> 02:28.682
My idea is to be more of a biology coach and to try and

02:29.801 --> 02:48.517
work out together with you live how to teach this course correctly or how to get closer to teaching it correctly by fundamentally reorienting how people approach the way that biology is introduced, which is what Biology 101 really is, right?

02:49.907 --> 03:03.233
It's an attempt to give you a framework by which one can approach what would otherwise be something that would almost be too large to tackle in a lifetime or many lifetimes.

03:03.634 --> 03:12.138
And that's the idea, to try and get us young people in our lives to understand life as a pattern integrity,

03:13.078 --> 03:21.321
and to understand what that means in the way that somebody like Buckminster Fuller might understand it in the full concept of pattern integrity.

03:21.361 --> 03:26.082
And then we're going to spend the second half today at 1 or 13.13, 1.15 talking again auditing the course of Matt Briggs.

03:32.944 --> 03:46.603
And we'll do the second installment of that where we're trying to also look at how science has been broken by the misapplication of what appears to be logical, you know, use of probability and instead of

03:48.058 --> 03:48.619
induction.

03:48.739 --> 03:56.932
So anyway, these are things that I'm still working out on my own because I think there's not very many other people trying to do it.

03:57.032 --> 03:59.296
I think this is a good use of our time.

04:00.017 --> 04:02.681
Of course, we will go back to covering the people.

04:03.966 --> 04:09.569
and the meddlers and the history of COVID to try and make sure these things aren't forgotten.

04:10.869 --> 04:25.876
But I think moving forward, it is my intention to provide something in the way of short courses that people can refer to as material ways of getting started with biology in a correct way.

04:26.618 --> 04:31.380
Parents who want to understand what vaccines are and are not.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.241
Parents that want an introduction to immunology.

04:35.161 --> 04:40.223
College students that are looking to study biology at university and not be bamboozled by that system.

04:41.904 --> 04:53.729
People that want to understand what's going on in intellectual property law might also want to understand why a mythological understanding and a mythological framework of understanding in biology

04:54.469 --> 05:01.097
also really has a lot of benefit for people who are trying to create intellectual property within that space.

05:02.438 --> 05:05.261
And so all of these things end up tying together.

05:05.301 --> 05:07.304
And again, you're watching an improv here.

05:07.344 --> 05:10.547
I've got a few notes about what I want to do today.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.010
And I'm actually going to start with yesterday's notes.

05:13.130 --> 05:13.390
And so

05:14.251 --> 05:16.391
Um, this is, you know, we'll just see where we're going to get.

05:16.451 --> 05:20.372
I thank everyone for joining me and for being here in the first place.

05:20.432 --> 05:21.012
It's really cool.

05:22.413 --> 05:24.373
Um, let me see if I've got this right.

05:24.453 --> 05:33.375
Do I, if I switch this first and then do this, then when I do this, it should be no, because I still have to do this.

05:34.495 --> 05:40.196
Um, so yesterday it looks like that's a little foggy, like maybe somebody.

05:44.528 --> 05:48.052
Yesterday I tried to start with what I thought were

05:53.593 --> 06:01.756
big points about how important it is for us to approach biology with the right frame of mind.

06:02.676 --> 06:18.701
And the frame of mind that we approach biology is actually descendant from people like Erwin Schrodinger, Jonas Salk, and the many authors that are found in this Man and His Future book that include

06:22.247 --> 06:34.215
you know, names like Julian Huxley and Hilary Koprowski and Herman Muller and Joshua Lederberg.

06:35.015 --> 06:36.997
And the list is quite long, actually.

06:38.117 --> 06:51.425
If you haven't been paying attention to Housatonic Live, Mark Hulak, yesterday he did an hour and a half of reading from this same book, from the Herman Muller chapter, and it was really actually very extraordinary.

06:51.465 --> 07:05.873
That chapter is titled, Genetic Progress by Voluntarily Conducted Germinal Choice, which is basically like, you know, hopefully, he talks about how the first generation of eugenicists

07:07.493 --> 07:23.140
really kind of hoped that there would be this natural tendency for people with bad traits, you know, like being dumb or simple or handicapped or sickly, would just have less babies than people who were very fit and very intelligent.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.562
And so then the natural progression of the human race

07:27.202 --> 07:41.713
because of the way culture works is that the human race would better itself by a natural process where the more feeble or members of our society would naturally have or choose to have even less babies and

07:42.313 --> 07:46.839
He talks about how that assumption of these eugenicists actually isn't true.

07:47.339 --> 07:59.134
And so it may be that we're going to meet need to, you know, again, as I use this analogy a lot lately, put our big boy pants on and start to take control of this, what we hoped would be a natural trend.

07:59.875 --> 08:04.017
And so that's just one of the little ideas that was inside of that chapter.

08:04.697 --> 08:09.539
And it's very worth your while to spend some time with Mark laughing about the language that was chosen there.

08:09.579 --> 08:13.661
And remember that these people are considered luminaries of their time.

08:14.101 --> 08:21.124
And many of these people went on to mentor some of the people who have mentored the people who are responsible for the pandemic.

08:22.124 --> 08:26.206
And it is that very distinct red line of mentorship

08:27.156 --> 08:28.958
that makes it so important to understand.

08:29.018 --> 08:31.120
It's not hundreds of people.

08:32.241 --> 08:33.763
It's not thousands of people.

08:35.124 --> 08:47.977
It's a few men who are responsible for charting this course where nation states get in the way of mankind finally taking control of his destiny and his future.

08:50.077 --> 09:02.826
And it's very interesting if you look at what a Biology 101 textbook wants you to think about in terms of big ideas, where we saw they break it down into different levels of analysis.

09:05.047 --> 09:22.514
And the next step, of course, progressing from here would be to point out, and most biology textbooks will do this, would be to point out that there are emergent properties which cannot be predicted by understanding the level of organization that you're on.

09:23.394 --> 09:31.261
So in other words, if you understand everything about genetics on the genetic level, you still won't understand how genes combine to produce a cell.

09:31.942 --> 09:45.093
That's a level of complexity that is an emergent property that a lot of the properties of cells aren't explainable by the properties of DNA alone, but emergent properties that need more explanation and that at every level,

09:45.894 --> 09:53.120
There are emergent properties of tissues that couldn't be predicted by the properties of the cells alone.

09:53.460 --> 10:05.870
There are emergent properties of the organs that are composed of those tissues that cannot be predicted by the contents or the mechanisms and the physiology present in the tissues by themselves.

10:06.390 --> 10:10.693
And this goes on and on until you see the communities of animals exhibit

10:11.474 --> 10:23.753
you know, properties and things over time that can't be properly understood when you're looking at the individual organisms, never mind the organs that they are composed of.

10:25.000 --> 10:47.941
And so in one sense, it's nice to hear an introduction in biology that acknowledges these layers of complexity and tries to say that if you want to take a shot at appreciating the beauty of biology, you're going to have to realize that there are some levels upon layers upon layers upon layers of complexity inside of this one pattern integrity.

10:51.778 --> 10:59.626
And only depending on where you draw these arbitrary lines are there separate pattern integrities.

10:59.687 --> 11:02.850
But the whole could be viewed as a pattern integrity.

11:05.785 --> 11:11.768
And the individuality of these pattern integrities has more to do with the temporal and physical space that they occupy.

11:11.808 --> 11:17.090
And that's something that I want to add to this first before we move on.

11:17.190 --> 11:20.712
So let's make sure that we remember where we were yesterday.

11:20.752 --> 11:34.558
We talked about the fact that people in our recent past, maybe the people that it would have been hanging out with our grandfathers, or maybe even with the mentors of our parents,

11:36.733 --> 11:54.274
stopped thinking about planting trees under whose shade they would never shelter and started thinking about the genomes that they were passing on and the consequences of those genomes because they were led to believe that you know everybody I mean let's think about it for a second from the perspective of what's going on here and then we're going to come back to this

11:55.071 --> 12:13.646
later, but as a thought exercise, think back to your grandparents, if you can, and if this is not a painful memory, think back to your grandparents and the children that they had and the number of children per child they got as grandchildren in return.

12:13.786 --> 12:20.651
And then think about the families that you know and extending to how many grandchildren do you expect they will have?

12:21.971 --> 12:26.035
How many grandchildren did my grandmother have, for example, is just one question.

12:26.075 --> 12:27.477
How many children did she have?

12:28.398 --> 12:30.400
How many grandchildren did she end up with?

12:31.604 --> 12:42.549
And what you will see if you do that thought exercise is that it's not just the number of grandchildren that changed in this generation, but also the number of children that people are having.

12:42.589 --> 12:57.034
And so this is a multiplicative effect that many, many people aren't really talking about, but it's definitely part of one of the layers of this kind of biological analysis.

12:57.074 --> 13:00.356
If we were to start to think about the human population

13:02.171 --> 13:08.535
as a kind of pattern integrity that we want to understand, the species as a pattern integrity that we want to understand.

13:08.595 --> 13:29.386
And this is a pretty crucial point to realize that the pattern of reproduction, the number of families that are having, let's say, six kids like my grandmother did, and how many of those six kids are having kids like my grandmother's kids did, versus now, where my brother and his wife have decided not to have kids.

13:30.333 --> 13:42.544
So that's a thing that my grandmother doesn't have in her, in her, in her descendancy map until her grandkids decide not to have children.

13:43.725 --> 13:44.746
So that's a change.

13:45.586 --> 13:50.471
And that change is quite significant from the perspective of trying to understand human biology.

13:51.151 --> 13:57.297
And it is very significant to understand that these people in this book were talking in terms

13:59.301 --> 14:08.986
that acknowledged that that was significant, that acknowledged that we as mankind have come to realize that we have control over those knobs.

14:09.046 --> 14:13.149
We can decide what the population looks like in 50 years if we wanted to.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.351
That's the argument that's being made here.

14:18.717 --> 14:21.819
And I'm not going to go down the, oh, it's a depopulation agenda thing.

14:21.859 --> 14:22.960
It's absolutely not.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.222
It is a ruling thing.

14:25.382 --> 14:28.304
It is a planning thing.

14:28.464 --> 14:29.845
It is a foresight thing.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.826
It is a responsibility thing.

14:31.866 --> 14:36.830
They've turned it into a, you know, the smart people have a responsibility.

14:38.939 --> 14:52.209
to take control of what was once a ship at drift on an ocean of evolution can now be a ship with someone at the helm, with a rudder and sails.

14:53.791 --> 15:00.556
And we can move through this temporal space of evolution through our future with intention.

15:00.636 --> 15:02.157
That's what this book is about.

15:03.598 --> 15:07.061
And if you read the Herman Muller chapter with Mark,

15:10.201 --> 15:25.812
what you will find is someone who is fantasizing about that future, fantasizing about that level of direction and that level of intentionality that these people would like to achieve from a mankind perspective and how nation states get in the way of that.

15:28.837 --> 15:54.583
And what I am starting to come to realize in my heart is that the best explanation for where we are and why we are here is because people who still believe these ideals, despite the ever increasing evidence of the irreducible complexity being impenetrable, being only worthy of our reverence,

15:55.953 --> 16:03.877
They are continuing to insist, as Ray Kurzweiler does, that in 10 years or 20 years, we'll be able to upload our consciousnesses and there will be no more disease.

16:04.557 --> 16:11.661
And we'll be able to put implants in our brains that will allow a seamless integration across space and time and all this other nonsense.

16:13.362 --> 16:22.326
And the way that we've gotten here is by starting to teach biology with this framework that's missing dimensionality to it.

16:24.346 --> 16:34.136
And so I want to add that dimensionality now and then at the first part of this, and then I would like to maybe read a few pages from this book as Mark did.

16:34.897 --> 16:45.909
And I'm going to start from the introduction and the first part, because I think it's a really important part of the book, of course, but in every part of this book,

16:47.222 --> 16:47.822
is a gem.

16:47.943 --> 17:01.392
I mean, if you look at the contents of this book, The Future of Man, Agricultural Productivity in Relation to Population, Sophisticated Diets in Man's Health, World Resources, Control of Reproduction in Mammals.

17:06.505 --> 17:21.275
The sex ratio in human populations, world population, growth and development of social groups, man's relationship to his environment, machines and society, sociological aspects of, that's the discussion, I guess.

17:21.895 --> 17:23.656
The promise of medical science.

17:23.697 --> 17:30.081
Here's Hilary Koprowski's chapter that talks about viruses coming from bats, the future of infectious and malignant diseases.

17:31.462 --> 17:38.928
the longevity of man and his tissues, something that became very important subject of discussion at the start of the pandemic.

17:39.529 --> 17:54.581
Health and disease, genetic progress by voluntarily conducted germinal choices, the chapter that Mark read yesterday on his stream, the biological future of man by Joshua Lederberg himself, eugenics and genetics.

17:54.661 --> 17:56.863
I mean, they even just have it as a part of the title.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.766
Potentialities in the control of behavior.

18:05.008 --> 18:06.789
And then we have the future of the mind.

18:06.849 --> 18:14.274
I'm sure they don't mean, you know, telekinesis and telepathy and all these other things.

18:14.314 --> 18:17.116
I'm sure what they mean is, how are we going to control it?

18:17.156 --> 18:18.617
How are we going to enfeeble it?

18:18.657 --> 18:22.780
How are we going to make sure that people don't get in the way

18:23.798 --> 18:28.100
of our directing the evolution of the human species.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.201
That's what this is about.

18:29.641 --> 18:34.023
The biological possibility for the human species in the next 10,000 years.

18:35.044 --> 18:36.825
Ethical considerations.

18:41.007 --> 18:47.170
And so that's why I've chosen this book to be the introductory text for Biology 101.

18:51.704 --> 18:59.089
Because instead of having this as the introduction to Biology 101, Biology 101 is historically this.

19:00.670 --> 19:04.413
And this is an incomplete framework.

19:05.794 --> 19:09.116
So let me explain why that is an incomplete framework.

19:11.238 --> 19:15.901
So I'm not going to remember it off the top of my head again, because I had a list over here on the table.

19:16.826 --> 19:42.553
to make sure I didn't forget it but I'll do it here now anyway and we'll just see if we can get most of them biosphere and then I think it was ecosystem and then was it community or something like that and then population and then sorry ecosystem, communities, populations, organisms

20:04.560 --> 20:13.654
So, this, the problem with this is, number one, I'm just accepting the divisions that a typical biology 101 textbook would have.

20:15.376 --> 20:22.378
And I'm not suggesting that those divisions are obvious or necessities like, you know, the way the music scale is.

20:22.518 --> 20:26.920
I just mean that I'm accepting that because I want to have a discussion about it and what's missing here.

20:26.960 --> 20:40.484
Now, even if these distinctions are, in the end, the most logical ones, I think one of the most important things to realize is missing from this are the other dimensions that matter so very, very much.

20:41.585 --> 20:45.967
Um, and let me just turn back to make sure I see how I drew it over here.

20:46.827 --> 20:50.249
Um, yeah, so maybe I'll redo it again.

20:50.309 --> 20:53.190
This is, this is the diagram I want to draw again.

20:53.670 --> 20:58.793
So what we really have here, this list in bio, this is, this is biology 101.

21:02.443 --> 21:03.924
And biology 101 is fine.

21:03.964 --> 21:13.547
They've been teaching that for a long time, but what we need to understand is what's missing from this and what makes this so very enticingly oversimplified.

21:14.088 --> 21:18.970
And the basic way to do this is to try and stick with this same thing.

21:19.030 --> 21:26.233
So let's make a new diagram and we'll start with the biosphere at the top.

21:26.873 --> 21:30.934
And this is like, you know, layers of complexity all the way down to

21:33.399 --> 21:35.422
apparently at the bottom is DNA.

21:35.882 --> 21:43.953
You could go back down further to chemicals, I guess, but let's stop at DNA here because that's really where the pattern integrity is found somewhere in here, right?

21:45.495 --> 21:46.696
And so this is a

21:48.234 --> 21:51.615
This is that thing here represented by an arrow.

21:51.655 --> 21:58.616
What's missing from this, of course, is at least one or two extra dimensions, maybe even one coming out.

21:59.436 --> 22:05.197
The first dimension that I would like to point out is that there's a size change here.

22:11.799 --> 22:14.859
And the size change, of course, from big to small

22:18.692 --> 22:31.866
means that there's actually physics changes that occur as we move from the biosphere down to genes, right, and proteins and molecules that are somewhere in between cells and genes here.

22:31.926 --> 22:35.190
Somewhere in between there, there's some small stuff.

22:35.570 --> 22:38.313
And here, the physics is quite different.

22:41.311 --> 22:41.571
Right?

22:41.631 --> 22:44.272
The physics changes a lot at those small sizes.

22:44.352 --> 22:55.957
And so you can't really get too carried away with generalizing your understanding across these things, other than to just say that you're looking for patterns in these different layers.

22:56.037 --> 22:59.959
But Biology 101 is often not taught with that much nuance.

23:00.039 --> 23:05.561
And so very quickly, it is very enticing for the average Biology 101 student to, again,

23:07.262 --> 23:15.663
mistake this for a fluid, complete, thorough understanding of these at different layers, when that is not the case at all.

23:15.683 --> 23:31.266
What this is, is an enticingly simplified version of a highly complex system, impossibly complex system, with an enticing offer to not have any reverence for it.

23:32.386 --> 23:34.187
So the physics are different here.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.227
The physics, of course, are also different here.

23:41.274 --> 23:44.236
And you know, I'm not being very specific here because I don't think we need to.

23:44.296 --> 23:49.901
I think the point is pretty obvious that, that there are different things at play at these different size scales.

23:50.601 --> 23:56.346
And there's another thing that maybe comes out of this thing and goes, you know, that way.

23:56.846 --> 23:59.188
And that of course would be time, right?

24:01.070 --> 24:03.512
And I'm not talking about time, like it moving.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.013
I'm talking about time scales.

24:07.262 --> 24:17.610
And we're talking about on different timescales, you know, the way that DNA and proteins and molecules function is on a timescale that's very different than the way that you age.

24:18.971 --> 24:29.134
It's very different in then the way that populations change, the way that ecosystems change, the way the biosphere changes, the way that tissues evolve, the way that organs age.

24:29.194 --> 24:31.795
This is all different on different time scales.

24:31.855 --> 24:40.158
And so that all combines to where this generalizing across this one axis is pretty dumb.

24:41.621 --> 24:56.313
And yet Biology 101 is basically always emphasizing a sort of exploration up and down this single ladder without emphasizing that as you move up and down this ladder, you're also moving within these other parameter spaces.

24:56.373 --> 25:02.237
And those parameter spaces are often very vital to understanding better

25:03.427 --> 25:12.132
how irreducibly complex the interactions are between these layers on this one axis, which they want to emphasize in biology alone.

25:16.186 --> 25:17.547
I'm not sure if I got that or not.

25:17.647 --> 25:21.009
I mean, that was kind of all I wanted to teach today.

25:21.069 --> 25:40.083
I don't know if that's really what I wanted to coach you about today, was trying to get your imagination to stretch out a little bit and expand the way that it thinks about these things, which already in Biology 101 are meant to expand your understanding of what's going on.

25:41.192 --> 26:08.935
But in reality, what this is doing is already pigeonholing you and already hamstringing your ability to assign enough intellectual space to these concepts and to assign enough intellectual space to their interrelationship along these other axes of timescale and physics of size.

26:11.567 --> 26:25.333
Because of course, electromagnetic forces mean something very different to molecules across a phospholipid bilayer than electromagnetic signals mean between two people in two different houses.

26:27.714 --> 26:37.037
Electromagnetic signals mean something very different for two neurons trapped in an electromagnetic field versus two people

26:39.999 --> 27:02.165
I don't know the right analogy here, but understand what I'm trying to suggest to you, that one of the enticing traps of biology 101 that a lot of academic scientists are still trapped within is this illusion that allows people to sort of

27:03.442 --> 27:09.587
not think in this way that allows them to kind of simplify, oversimplify biology to this.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.869
And then what's further, what's the next step here?

27:12.510 --> 27:28.984
Of course, the next step in academic biology, the next step in specializing in biology is to go over here and pick like one thing where you, you pick a mouse, you pick the brain and you pick SK channels.

27:31.653 --> 27:42.144
And so then by the time you've done your reductionist selection of your layers, right?

27:42.204 --> 27:55.357
This reductionist selection of, I'm gonna study the mouse brain and SK channels in the mouse brain, but then I'm gonna tell stories about how these things control all these different levels.

27:57.008 --> 28:04.672
because since the organism and the brain is ultimately dependent on SK channels in the mouse, then it must also be in the humans.

28:04.712 --> 28:26.244
And then I can run around on this hamster wheel for 20 years of a career and teach a bunch of students about this hamster wheel and claim that I am contributing to understanding human biology, human wellbeing, you know, just contributing something, when in reality, all I'm doing is reinforcing this

28:27.481 --> 28:33.469
oversimplification of what should be always reemphasized as an irreducible complexity.

28:33.529 --> 28:40.258
We can barely draw in two dimensions unless we depict multiple dimensions on the paper.

28:41.809 --> 28:43.850
And yet in biology, that's never done.

28:43.910 --> 28:45.011
It's never, ever done.

28:45.051 --> 28:50.514
And not to the extent to which it should be if the goal was correct.

28:50.574 --> 28:59.020
And I think that's what we're trying to do here is try to show how these kinds of ideas need this.

29:00.936 --> 29:07.961
because they need you to accept that something is primal, that something is, that is the foundation of everything.

29:08.021 --> 29:22.250
And by first building this up as layers of analysis, and then talking about emergent properties, you can create the illusion that everything above this is dependent on the bottom.

29:24.712 --> 29:26.153
And that is not the case.

29:28.854 --> 29:37.358
And I think that that becomes very clear once we start talking about the fact that RNA and DNA are not the pattern integrity.

29:38.578 --> 29:39.518
It's not possible.

29:39.559 --> 29:42.600
And we have very, very good evidence that they're not the pattern integrity.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.341
They contain information, true.

29:45.101 --> 29:48.502
But what information they contain, we've barely scratched the surface of it.

29:48.562 --> 29:57.106
We know that some of these sequences are codes for proteins, but we don't know what of those sequences are responsible for making the difference between species.

29:58.462 --> 30:00.386
We can't describe that at all.

30:03.152 --> 30:05.537
And that concept is lost on a lot of people.

30:06.323 --> 30:11.844
It's a lost on a lot of biologists because we've been making all these statements about how we've been sequencing all of these things.

30:11.904 --> 30:13.525
When in reality, what have we been doing?

30:14.125 --> 30:25.448
We've been making restriction enzyme maps of these genomes after using recombinant DNA methods to make enough of the quantity copies of that genome so that we can do those experiments.

30:25.468 --> 30:30.749
And then after we do those experiments, we publish in paper in nature that says we've sequenced the shrew.

30:35.111 --> 30:43.435
And even if 10 years later we go back and sequence the shrew, we've still only sequenced one shrew.

30:43.555 --> 30:58.701
We still don't understand the variability in the genome of the shrew, nevermind understand how the genome of the shrew and the differences between that genome and ours fundamentally underlie the difference between that species and our own.

30:59.601 --> 31:01.362
If we did, there wouldn't be much work to do.

31:04.178 --> 31:18.265
But the implication of these publications, the implication of the title of these papers, the implication of the title of these 60 Minutes programs is that this represents a fidelity of understanding because we've always said this.

31:19.205 --> 31:20.986
We've always said we were going to do this.

31:21.466 --> 31:23.227
Ray Kurzweiler was always right.

31:25.785 --> 31:37.191
And just because it's become infinitely cheaper to make those DNA sequences and to make those RNA sequences doesn't mean that it's become much more understood.

31:37.291 --> 31:49.157
Just the same as if you could make lots and lots of copies of Chinese books, and before you had to copy them by hand, it doesn't mean that your understanding of the Chinese language is now going to drastically increase.

31:52.813 --> 32:00.339
And this is one of the many illusions that gets created when people are focused exclusively on these few layers.

32:01.420 --> 32:10.588
And then you just work in the idea that, well, we can use recombinant DNA of SK channels to study SK channels.

32:10.648 --> 32:12.229
It's a really useful tool.

32:12.850 --> 32:17.954
We can use a adenovirus to express SK channels in cell culture.

32:17.994 --> 32:18.875
That's really cool.

32:20.325 --> 32:22.827
And then we're still running in this hamster wheel.

32:25.629 --> 32:32.793
And also very much to our benefit, we think that the gene for SK channels is really important.

32:34.154 --> 32:35.435
We're actually encouraged.

32:35.535 --> 32:48.084
There are grant applications for us to look for genetic alterations in the SK channel gene that lead to known and predictable disease states like fainting goats.

32:49.707 --> 32:59.738
And then after we find out the potassium channels lead to fainting goats, now we have another huge story we can tell about how, see, a single change in a gene leads to a huge phenotype.

33:01.560 --> 33:07.687
And so, therefore, our gene must be pretty damn important in this huge continuum of pattern integrity.

33:10.851 --> 33:36.381
And that is really where the bamboozlement has occurred for all academic biologists, where from biology 101 all the way to their PhD and postdoc, they are ever narrowing, ever narrowing their line of questioning under the assumption that somebody else is doing all this work.

33:38.106 --> 33:45.454
and that somebody later will take their reductionist data and combine it with other reductionist data.

33:45.495 --> 33:54.885
And at some point, some other clever PhD student will put those two pieces together and do another reductionist analysis that will help us to understand this better.

33:56.427 --> 33:58.750
Despite just being another incomplete

34:00.316 --> 34:02.477
understanding with a different set of variables.

34:03.297 --> 34:09.259
The hope is, is that eventually there will be overlap enough so that we finally emerge on the other side.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.401
And this is an absolute illusion.

34:15.562 --> 34:24.425
But again, one more time, just to emphasize it, that illusion is what these people need in order for their agenda to be achieved.

34:25.421 --> 34:29.624
And that agenda is the use of humans as experimental animals.

34:29.684 --> 34:32.046
That is the engineering of humans.

34:32.126 --> 34:51.943
That is the loss of the idea that we have sovereignty over our bodies or that somehow our lives are a sacred gift that we should cherish, that our children are sacredly pure and we should protect them rather than they're born flawed and in need of 72 augmentations before they're 12.

34:54.724 --> 35:01.007
This is the kind of thing that I believe is at the heart of the problem, that we teach biology 101 wrong.

35:01.467 --> 35:18.955
And it starts right here with this list, when that list should be a very detailed three-dimensional diagram that is designed and intended to impart a sense of reverence for the amount of complexity that we're about to attempt to describe.

35:20.933 --> 35:25.695
That's the whole reason why they do these things where they have a biologist over here.

35:28.416 --> 35:29.837
And then over here, there's a chemist.

35:31.678 --> 35:33.279
And then over here, there's a physicist.

35:37.361 --> 35:38.981
And then over here, there's a math guy.

35:40.562 --> 35:44.744
And each one of these people is looking at the other one going, wow, they don't know anything.

35:45.728 --> 35:50.349
And they all think that, well, you know, chemistry is the foundation of everything that these people know.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.730
So they don't know squat because they don't know chemistry.

35:53.350 --> 35:57.691
And the physicists think the same thing about chemists to a certain extent, at least that's the joke.

35:58.191 --> 36:06.033
And that math people think the same thing about physicists, except sometimes I think the joke is that math people don't think any of these things even exist.

36:08.474 --> 36:12.275
And this joke is actually, you know, all permutations of it are kind of,

36:13.203 --> 36:19.487
kind of gross because in reality, that it's the truth in a nutshell.

36:20.988 --> 36:29.473
And what's even worse is that the recent permutations of academia, and I'm kind of spinning off into into la la land here, but I don't care.

36:30.054 --> 36:39.580
The recent manifestations of academia, especially in neuroscience, the field that I was in has encouraged physicists

36:41.454 --> 36:50.661
sorry, I gotta open this valve, I forgot, has encouraged physicists and mathematicians to become biologists.

36:52.523 --> 36:54.705
And so that's the real comedy of this, right?

36:55.205 --> 37:04.552
Is that the situation in physics and math has become so dire that they have extra math and physics people available that don't have any classes to teach.

37:05.293 --> 37:08.576
And so they've encouraged those people to go right away into biology.

37:09.502 --> 37:11.063
Because biology is really easy.

37:11.944 --> 37:13.905
Because biology is not that complex.

37:13.945 --> 37:17.768
And in fact, all of your skills are really useful in biology.

37:17.808 --> 37:19.409
But why are they useful in biology?

37:19.449 --> 37:34.581
Because the intention is to use them in very limited contexts, in very reductionist models, where math can be used to bolster the logic of their reductionist model.

37:36.161 --> 37:38.943
And the logic, of course, is what we're talking about with Matt Briggs.

37:39.003 --> 38:00.435
The logic is, if A, then B, and the reverse of it being, if not B, then not A. And so many times in biology, the questions that are being asked are two or three syllogisms away from reality, away from a real known fact, but instead an assumption.

38:01.947 --> 38:07.472
based on assumption, based on assumption with some illusion of a logical relationship between them.

38:08.593 --> 38:10.975
And what is the other thing that falls in between them?

38:11.696 --> 38:12.637
A probability.

38:15.059 --> 38:24.567
And what he was trying to get at yesterday and what I think he will develop very nicely today is this notation that we will use later in Bayesian

38:25.578 --> 38:31.180
probability with this line and therefore meaning and that that's what he's doing there.

38:31.220 --> 38:34.802
And so if you weren't following that this afternoon, we're going to cover that again.

38:34.842 --> 38:38.403
And I think and review it a little bit before we start his video.

38:38.443 --> 38:39.704
And I think it'll be really helpful.

38:40.164 --> 38:41.705
But again, what is going on here?

38:41.725 --> 38:53.870
What am I trying to show you is that this has been kind of an ongoing metamorphosis of our way of pursuing knowledge simply because these people knew it was necessary.

38:55.222 --> 38:59.584
And I believe that if you actually take the time to read this book, you will see that I'm not full of it.

39:00.424 --> 39:08.147
If you take the time to spend some time with Mark, as he reads the Herman Muller chapter, you're gonna see that these people understood this stuff.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.329
And that's not reflected in how we teach Biology 101.

39:14.229 --> 39:18.511
How we teach Biology 101 is very much a job already done.

39:18.631 --> 39:23.053
It's too complex for you to understand because we've already got it all figured out.

39:24.144 --> 39:32.812
And so you've got a lifelong, if you wanna understand everything that we know, you've got a lifelong reading task ahead of you.

39:32.852 --> 39:38.797
But if you wanna get out to the cutting edge, what you're gonna need to do is just study a few things and focus on that.

39:42.020 --> 39:49.226
And that's what they convinced me and they've convinced hundreds of thousands of biology students like me in the past decades to do.

39:50.342 --> 40:05.652
And that's how whole mythologies about the existence of phenomenon can be created, just by this really disingenuous application of reductionist thinking.

40:07.634 --> 40:11.356
even though they all know that it results in an incomplete understanding.

40:11.917 --> 40:24.805
Again, the assumption, just like what is detailed in the Herman Muller chapter in here, the assumption of the original eugenicist was that people that shouldn't have kids would choose not to, and the people that should have kids by nature would.

40:32.429 --> 40:33.230
They've set us up.

40:34.363 --> 40:36.103
And they've been setting us up for a while.

40:36.163 --> 40:39.064
And the goal is for us to teach this crap to our kids.

40:39.124 --> 40:48.226
The goal was for me to be a tenured professor, teaching this biology with pleasure to college freshmen every year until I retired.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.647
And I don't know why I didn't fall into their trap.

40:51.707 --> 41:02.830
I don't know what it was that kept me out of it, but I know for sure that I would have fallen gladly into that trap had they not made the mistake of telling me not to come back.

41:03.656 --> 41:05.085
I begged for them to take me back.

41:06.874 --> 41:10.597
And so it is with great humility that I present this discussion.

41:10.657 --> 41:14.099
It is with great humility that I present this diagram.

41:14.119 --> 41:18.303
And I'm quite certain that somebody will find that I'm not the first person to point this out.

41:18.323 --> 41:23.646
I don't know where who would have done it, but it's hard for me to believe that no one has pointed this out before.

41:24.127 --> 41:33.574
This particular observation about what's going on in neuroscience with regard to encouraging physicists and mathematicians to skip chemistry

41:35.225 --> 41:46.654
skip biochemistry, skip organic chemistry, go right to being a biologist and do experiments with people who are measuring thousands, if not millions of neurons a second.

41:47.695 --> 41:51.538
Go work with biologists who are measuring calcium signals that they don't understand.

41:52.198 --> 41:59.544
Go work with biologists that are measuring FMRI signals that they don't understand, that they're correlating with behaviors that they don't understand.

42:01.960 --> 42:06.223
That can't be a genuine pursuit of knowledge.

42:06.283 --> 42:13.649
This is a purposeful sabotaging of our pursuit of our own understanding.

42:13.769 --> 42:29.581
And it is a sabotaging which is of course bent, in my humble opinion, on getting these skillsets focused on the biological questions that these people knew already decades ago were gonna be the most important questions to answer.

42:30.922 --> 42:42.289
They believe that this hierarchy is a dependency hierarchy, that if they can alter this, understand this, then they have control over everything above it.

42:49.374 --> 42:56.939
And that philosophy is what fuels everything that we've experienced with the pandemic, because the pandemic biology

42:58.317 --> 43:02.281
dovetails precisely like a Japanese carpentry joint.

43:02.701 --> 43:10.029
It dovetails precisely with this idea that we are just genes.

43:10.469 --> 43:17.055
We are just the consequences of the cards we are dealt and that there is no magic to it.

43:17.155 --> 43:22.601
All there is is just a lot of work to do to figure out how this extremely complicated wristwatch works.

43:25.202 --> 43:26.483
And that won't get us anywhere.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.104
That won't get us our kids anywhere.

43:28.144 --> 43:35.628
And more importantly, it won't impress upon our children the role that we actually have.

43:35.688 --> 43:41.912
And so again, just to emphasize this a little bit, I wanted to do something fun because fun is fun.

43:44.113 --> 43:47.875
And what I might do is, did I download it already?

43:47.955 --> 43:48.816
I probably didn't.

43:48.896 --> 43:50.797
So I'm going to download it, and then I'm going to play it.

43:50.917 --> 43:51.938
And that might screw us up.

43:53.224 --> 43:54.245
But hopefully it will not.

43:54.465 --> 43:54.905
Let's see.

43:54.985 --> 43:55.426
Where is it?

43:59.568 --> 44:01.770
I know I gave it to myself here.

44:01.830 --> 44:02.650
I'm sure I did.

44:02.871 --> 44:04.191
And if I didn't, I can find it.

44:04.332 --> 44:05.092
And I apologize.

44:05.112 --> 44:11.997
If you have any questions while we're talking here, you could put them in the chat and maybe I can read them and answer them while I'm trying to download this thing.

44:12.057 --> 44:14.939
And hopefully I'm not going to screw up my bandwidth by doing this.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.181
No, stop it.

44:22.170 --> 44:26.213
I'm gonna clip this then I'm gonna start this program.

44:26.253 --> 44:29.316
So see really I'm doing Probably what I shouldn't be doing.

44:29.716 --> 44:39.983
The goal is intellectual property Well, they want to make the the rainforest intellectual property as far as I understand So yeah, I don't know what to say about that.

44:40.624 --> 44:41.444
Did I do it or what?

44:43.386 --> 44:45.307
Yes, I did shoot it's not doing it

44:54.863 --> 44:59.905
This is just going to play and maybe I'll just do it here.

44:59.925 --> 45:01.466
I could just do it here.

45:02.887 --> 45:06.249
Hopefully this isn't going to interrupt our connections at all here.

45:06.269 --> 45:14.893
I just want to emphasize this relationship that I'm showing over here to kind of get you an idea of the kind of

45:15.976 --> 45:33.221
at least in one direction, how much there, you've seen pictures, right, of molecules in real time and how all those proteins are all going shaking around and the glycosylated groups on the side of the spike protein are flapping all around.

45:33.801 --> 45:36.382
So the timescale thing is very important.

45:36.402 --> 45:42.144
And I thought that there's this really cute video that I remember that really emphasizes this very well.

45:43.144 --> 45:45.425
And so I wanna just see, let me just see if I can,

45:47.631 --> 45:49.412
if I can download it one more time.

45:49.432 --> 45:58.215
And maybe if it doesn't work, then I will just play it over YouTube.

46:00.095 --> 46:01.676
For some reason, this isn't working.

46:01.716 --> 46:04.437
So let me just quickly move this over here.

46:06.658 --> 46:08.378
And that means I have to do this, I think.

46:08.438 --> 46:08.718
Yes.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.661
I think I can pull this over here, though.

46:15.761 --> 46:16.381
Yeah, OK.

46:19.473 --> 46:19.913
Excuse me.

46:22.094 --> 46:23.215
Something weird happened there.

46:23.255 --> 46:23.815
What did I do?

46:25.075 --> 46:26.136
Did I close that window?

46:26.176 --> 46:27.196
I thought I made it big.

46:31.358 --> 46:32.878
I thought I made it big.

46:35.859 --> 46:37.260
And a history.

46:39.541 --> 46:40.401
Isn't that history?

46:40.501 --> 46:40.761
No.

46:42.282 --> 46:43.202
What is happening here?

46:50.726 --> 46:51.367
Okay, here we go.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.017
This is to appreciate timescale.

47:54.626 --> 48:02.611
Look, Q. I think there's another one back there.

48:04.011 --> 48:04.372
Here!

48:04.412 --> 48:11.776
Look at that!

48:14.337 --> 48:18.780
What are they doing again?

48:33.991 --> 48:35.512
Holzhaufen?

48:36.433 --> 48:40.256
Ich sage dir, da steckt System dahinter.

48:47.562 --> 48:49.163
Ich hasse Flechten.

48:49.523 --> 48:54.708
Da ist die Eiszeit vorbei, man freut sich, Sonne aufm Bauch, zack, sind sie wieder da.

48:56.789 --> 48:58.671
Oh nein, ich hab Moos aufm Kopf.

49:04.002 --> 49:05.425
Halbstärke, verdammtes Mist!

49:05.506 --> 49:06.207
Oh, jeep!

49:06.227 --> 49:06.728
Kein Treffer!

50:16.803 --> 50:17.043
No.

50:19.247 --> 50:20.208
You.

50:20.268 --> 50:21.009
Hmm?

50:21.189 --> 50:22.391
Oh.

50:54.525 --> 50:54.945
No, no

51:28.126 --> 51:33.650
Now, I think you probably already see where I wanted to take it with this movie, but you can see what's happening.

51:33.670 --> 51:36.713
The rocks are living on a very different timescale than the people are.

51:37.293 --> 51:44.519
And they're completely unaware of what is making the roads and what's making those piles of stone and piles of wood in the distance.

51:45.199 --> 51:50.704
They have no idea that holding that round rock inspired some guy to build a wheel.

51:50.764 --> 51:55.768
And then hundreds of years later, there were carts and roads going by their house.

51:56.883 --> 51:58.004
or where they're sitting.

51:58.244 --> 51:59.504
They don't understand that.

52:00.204 --> 52:19.953
And if you think about the human species and the ecosystem around these rocks as a series of pattern integrities interacting with their environment and each other, and then the simple augmentation of that pattern integrity over time by him holding that rock.

52:20.693 --> 52:22.234
Now imagine the idea that

52:24.306 --> 52:50.026
a couple generations ago or a couple decades ago, a few people decided it would be a good idea to start a mass campaign of injecting intramuscularly a combination of toxins and recombinant proteins to augment the immune system with no concept of what this idea might result in generations in the future.

52:51.246 --> 53:07.543
And now you might say, and I think it might be a valid argument to say that, well, recombinant proteins and toxins injected into the muscle of kids is probably going to be okay in most kids, and it's not going to change the genome.

53:07.683 --> 53:07.983
Fine.

53:08.444 --> 53:10.446
What about transfection and transformation?

53:11.747 --> 53:13.949
How absolutely sure can you be

53:15.040 --> 53:30.116
that injection of lipid nanoparticles with synthetic RNA and possibly DNA in them is not the one in a million thing that will lead to two generations from now a virtual collapse.

53:33.752 --> 53:50.512
How can it possibly be that we are at the stage where that is completely not discussed with regard to genetically modified plants, genetically modified mosquitoes, genetically modified humans, if you think about the mRNA transfections?

53:51.974 --> 53:52.735
We don't know.

53:53.709 --> 54:04.760
It may very well be that five years from now we find out that these transfections didn't change anybody's genome and we can wipe our forehead and say, great, but what happens if it did?

54:05.501 --> 54:07.283
What happens if it did?

54:08.224 --> 54:14.631
And how in the world can we allow these few people who are in charge to pretend as though they know?

54:16.121 --> 54:26.205
How can we allow ourselves to be bamboozled into arguing about the things that we've argued about for the past five or ten years when these fundamental truths are right in front of our eyes?

54:29.347 --> 54:37.710
That the fundamental idea of Biology 101 has been oversimplified to the point where we can be enslaved by it if we are not careful.

55:19.377 --> 55:19.497
Hmm.

55:21.741 --> 55:22.082
Hmm.

55:33.891 --> 55:34.912
Hey, you!

55:35.292 --> 55:36.413
Das ist genial!

55:36.794 --> 55:38.796
Sie bauen die Wege für diese Dinger!

55:39.797 --> 55:42.219
Das ist... das ist Fortbewegung!

55:42.259 --> 55:43.420
Das ist Transport!

55:43.740 --> 55:44.441
Hier der Weg!

55:45.082 --> 55:46.503
Die Stadt!

55:46.823 --> 55:47.604
Entwicklung!

55:47.864 --> 55:49.586
Die Möglichkeiten!

55:49.886 --> 55:51.387
Junge, schau es dir an!

55:58.485 --> 56:00.387
And the key to all this is this!

56:31.897 --> 56:36.740
Now, I'm aware that the billboard in this movie is kind of scary, so I'll just let you see that.

56:36.820 --> 56:39.221
There's a lot of one-eye stuff on the billboard.

56:39.241 --> 56:40.342
I understand that.

56:40.462 --> 56:40.882
I get it.

56:40.982 --> 56:43.283
I don't know if the guy who did it.

56:43.323 --> 56:44.504
There's moose things.

56:46.725 --> 56:48.226
I'll see if I can do some more here.

56:57.511 --> 56:58.251
Doppel-licker.

57:00.734 --> 57:02.775
There's a symbol we don't know.

57:02.815 --> 57:03.696
That was Jesus.

57:03.736 --> 57:04.997
An eyeball again.

57:05.497 --> 57:07.579
You can see the eyeball several times there.

57:07.619 --> 57:08.980
It's like a head with one eye.

57:10.200 --> 57:10.481
See it?

57:10.521 --> 57:10.961
There it is.

57:11.101 --> 57:11.721
Piercings.

57:12.902 --> 57:13.663
So cool.

57:14.904 --> 57:18.126
But it's still one eye with a G. One eye with a G.

57:44.676 --> 57:45.236
And then what?

57:47.078 --> 57:48.238
Ah, collapse.

57:50.100 --> 57:50.500
I see.

57:56.284 --> 58:00.687
And so my argument would be here that this is all part of the same thing.

58:00.727 --> 58:04.769
The guy who made this video might not know any better, but this video was very popular in 2020 or 2001.

58:04.809 --> 58:06.070
And we know what happened in 2001.

58:14.773 --> 58:22.620
So it's an interesting place that we live right now, an interesting time that we live in.

58:23.741 --> 58:29.286
And I can guarantee you that this time was foreseen by the people that wrote this book.

58:30.787 --> 58:42.437
This time was hoped for by Jonas Salk when he wrote the book Survival of the Wisest, which is also about the wise humans taking control of human evolution.

58:45.196 --> 58:48.757
because we don't want this ship to wander on this sea any longer.

58:49.737 --> 58:56.019
And it is our obligation to future generations to take the wheel.

58:57.879 --> 59:02.700
That's also what is basically argued by Erwin Schrodinger in this book.

59:03.260 --> 59:07.581
That's also what is basically argued in a lot of these books.

59:09.402 --> 59:14.883
And so let's take the chance or the time to read a little bit here.

59:17.432 --> 59:42.184
In the beginning of this book and I apologize ahead of time for reading but I do think it's important Again, I showed you the the table of contents here, which is already very impressive and now I'm gonna read the future of man evolutionary aspects because Henry just to recall one more time I'm reading this and using this as the foundational text for biology 101 and

59:44.451 --> 59:51.276
Because I think the ideas are what Biology 101 in college is actually about.

59:51.316 --> 01:00:00.302
That's why this book, for example, the example book that I have down on the floor here, Campbell Biology, that's why Campbell Biology is written the way it's written.

01:00:00.362 --> 01:00:12.571
That's why on page eight, we're already talking about... Sorry, I didn't have it open.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:23.918
On page 8, we're already talking about these different layers of complexity and we're already talking about aspects of life and what they are.

01:00:24.018 --> 01:00:29.462
So emergent properties and the connection between structure and function, these are all great.

01:00:30.462 --> 01:00:38.688
But at the end of this chapter, they say something that they probably will never say again and virologists definitely don't want them to say.

01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:43.071
Where is it?

01:00:46.013 --> 01:00:46.493
Oh yeah, here.

01:00:46.533 --> 01:00:46.813
Sorry.

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:48.194
The three domains of life.

01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:50.215
Concept of life.

01:00:51.455 --> 01:00:52.256
Core themes.

01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:54.777
Molecules to evolution.

01:00:54.857 --> 01:00:56.618
Requires this, requires that.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:58.399
Inquiring about life.

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:01.240
Some properties of life include order.

01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:03.822
They include energy processing.

01:01:04.462 --> 01:01:10.625
They include evolutionary adaptation, growth and development, response to the environment, reproduction, regulation.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.102
not really getting into the idea of pattern integrity because that is not their goal.

01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:32.608
They aren't trying to, they want us to think of ourselves as part of this larger machine and that collectively we shouldn't think of ourselves as important, we shouldn't think of the choices we make as important, but choices that we make as species as important.

01:01:33.629 --> 01:01:39.331
Evolution of this planet as a unit in the cosmic process has been going on for perhaps 5,000 million years.

01:01:40.312 --> 01:01:41.893
Life has evolved here about half

01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:56.029
here after about half of this huge span of time, and has itself been evolving during the latter half of the period, to be more precise, for some 2,750,000 million years.

01:01:56.889 --> 01:02:02.211
We, like all other living organisms and all other features of the Earth, are products of this process of evolution.

01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:02.911
So here we go.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:04.071
This is the whole thing.

01:02:05.352 --> 01:02:06.272
There's no creator.

01:02:06.312 --> 01:02:07.352
There's no design.

01:02:07.452 --> 01:02:12.574
This is all lightning bolt in a mud puddle, even though there is no possible way

01:02:13.476 --> 01:02:17.178
that that explanation suffices and even Darwin himself knew that.

01:02:18.779 --> 01:02:33.587
We men belong to the latest dominant type to be produced and are now responsible for the future evolution of this planet, which according to astronomers and geophysicists is likely to continue for at least another 2,750 million years.

01:02:33.627 --> 01:02:35.528
That's a lot of time we're responsible for.

01:02:36.909 --> 01:02:47.193
We are privileged to be living at a crucial moment in the cosmic story, the moment when the vast evolutionary process and a small person of acquiring man is becoming conscious of itself.

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:54.776
Evolution can be defined as a natural process of transformation.

01:02:55.658 --> 01:03:18.170
self-operating and irreversible which is in its course generates novelty greater variety more complex organization and eventually higher levels of mental and physiological activity despite the foundational understanding of physics being entropy so the foundational

01:03:19.392 --> 01:03:33.323
basis for our understanding in science physics says that everything is subject to entropy but life goes in exactly the opposite direction through a random irreversible self-operating process

01:03:36.837 --> 01:03:40.498
But this comprehensive process falls naturally into three sectors.

01:03:40.538 --> 01:03:49.660
The first is the inorganic or cosmic sector, operating by physical, simple chemical interaction, and resulting in the evolution of elements, nebulized stars, and planetary systems.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:04:02.684
The second is the organic and biological sector, operating by automatic natural selection, superimposed on physical, chemical interaction, and resulting in the evolution of plant and animal organisms, from fungi to flowers to monkeys to Medusa.

01:04:05.114 --> 01:04:20.039
The third is the human or psychosocial sector operating by mind-accompanied psychosocial pressure superimposed upon natural selection and resulting in human societies and their products for machines and works of art to science and religions.

01:04:22.719 --> 01:04:32.483
What an interesting level and thing of organization relative to what we are told is responsible in Biology 101.

01:04:32.764 --> 01:04:39.927
According to Julian Huxley, the primary layers of organization are the inorganic or cosmic sector,

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:52.933
operating by physical and simple chemical interactions and then the natural selection superimposed on physical chemical interactions resulting in the evolution of plant and animal organisms.

01:04:54.619 --> 01:04:56.620
That's the biological organic sector.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:12.704
And then this third sector of evolution or something which is the human culture and human societies and the intellectual things that are created by them on this earth and presumably in a few other isolated spots in the universe.

01:05:14.204 --> 01:05:19.386
There have thus been two critical points in evolution when it has entered a new phase.

01:05:20.359 --> 01:05:22.761
and with a new properties and characteristics.

01:05:23.422 --> 01:05:41.739
So again, now we're starting to hear this thing that we talked about a long time ago with regard to COVID and OVID and the idea that in order to get a new way of organizing the globe, a new way of organizing the human race, we're going to need to reduce ourselves to chaos before we can get order out of it.

01:05:41.779 --> 01:05:42.360
You can't take

01:05:43.224 --> 01:05:46.085
one order and rearrange it into another order.

01:05:46.145 --> 01:05:48.225
That's not how things work in nature.

01:05:48.925 --> 01:05:55.767
So on this earth there have thus been two critical points of evolution when its characteristics entered on a new phase and with new properties and characteristics.

01:05:56.267 --> 01:06:07.470
The first was when, thanks to the evolution of deoxyribonucleic acid and genes, material organizations became self-varying and self-reproducing and the biological phase began to operate.

01:06:08.393 --> 01:06:13.315
So this is very much akin to describing life as being something that was wound up.

01:06:15.235 --> 01:06:19.877
And once it was wound up, apparently it was able to self-sustain itself.

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:34.422
One nucleic acid combination suddenly appeared that could copy itself and forever after we have been the result of that instance of existence of a pattern integrity.

01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:39.118
That's what he's saying right here.

01:06:39.158 --> 01:06:57.002
This is the foundational myth of our biology, of our creation, is that somewhere this new phase of evolution occurred when a particular molecule came into existence, presumably by combination of electricity and chemistry in a mud puddle.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:08.952
That's the best explanation that these people have to offer, but that explanation means that you have no free will, just like Sam Harris says, that you have no sovereignty over your body.

01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:09.712
That's an illusion.

01:07:09.752 --> 01:07:12.634
That's something that religious fanatics have told us.

01:07:17.095 --> 01:07:18.096
I hear a lot of chickens.

01:07:27.325 --> 01:07:30.206
That's normal.

01:07:30.366 --> 01:07:33.227
When it has entered a new phase, the DNA self-reproducing.

01:07:33.267 --> 01:07:48.492
The second was when, thanks to evolution of conceptual thought, symbolic language, and cumulative transmission of experience by tradition, mental or mind-accompanying organizations have become self-varying, self-reproducing, and the human phase emerged.

01:07:50.638 --> 01:07:55.820
I'll just put something here as a lifelong biologist that I think makes this kind of nonsense.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:11.646
I don't know if you're aware or not, but as far as ecologists are concerned, if we look at the organisms and population level, there are some marine biologists that claim to have discovered that there are cultures of orca.

01:08:13.379 --> 01:08:31.359
So there are orca that grandmothers pass on the preference for food, the techniques for hunting, and the migrational routes to their descendants, and that these cultures are maintained.

01:08:32.205 --> 01:08:46.878
And they segregate so that the culture of, or the socio, the pod of the population of orca that is, you know, actively engaged in eating sharks is different than the one that eats seals.

01:08:47.099 --> 01:08:48.380
And their techniques are different.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:58.429
And the way that they're passed down is not because whales are born knowing how to create a wave that washes a seal off of a small raft of ice.

01:09:01.172 --> 01:09:08.534
There aren't whales that are born to understand how to kill sharks with a battering ram of their head.

01:09:11.555 --> 01:09:18.858
And so these are just small anecdotal examples of what likely

01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:41.438
is something that these people all the way back in these books have wanted to make us the exception so that we would feel the necessary arrogance, not only over mother nature and lordship over her domain and over creation, but also over ourselves and over the people that aren't here yet.

01:09:42.619 --> 01:09:45.022
Because that's what these people are talking about.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:53.914
They're talking about taking control of the lives and the biology and the destiny of future generations.

01:09:57.138 --> 01:09:59.441
And that's exactly how arrogant

01:10:01.277 --> 01:10:06.460
the ideas that have led to the traditional biological 101 teaching scheme.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.901
That's how arrogant they are.

01:10:08.381 --> 01:10:15.505
That's how malevolent those ideas are because they are descended from these people with these ideas in mind.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:19.407
In the psychosocial phase, the process of evolution is predominantly culture.

01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:28.713
It results in the manifestation and variety of societies and their organs like philosophies, legal codes, and social systems that could disappear in 40 years if people don't have children.

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:34.938
disappear in 40 years if we used public funding to undermine the

01:10:36.175 --> 01:10:49.680
the passing of knowledge from one generation to the next, or if we used the disingenuous funding of academic pursuits to effectively neuter the passing of real wisdom from generation to generation.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:11:04.606
This makes it seem as though the power of human culture is somehow on the same level of power that these earlier levels of organization and emergent properties are, and it's not.

01:11:06.718 --> 01:11:07.938
These are not related.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.560
These are emergent properties.

01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:32.146
And so thinking that we can all go all the way down to first causes and that those first causes are DNA and that by meddling with DNA, we can also predictably affect the psychosocial state of future generations and the process of evolution of those future generations is absurd.

01:11:33.609 --> 01:11:37.591
But that's exactly, exactly what these people want.

01:11:37.671 --> 01:11:39.812
It's exactly what these people are teaching.

01:11:39.872 --> 01:11:42.214
It's exactly what is being taught in universities.

01:11:42.754 --> 01:11:46.096
It's exactly what I believed when I was still trying to get tenure in 2022.

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:48.537
Well, 21, by 2022, I had obviously given up.

01:11:48.557 --> 01:11:50.278
But in 2022, I might've still taken my job back.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:11:59.158
Oh, sorry, I'm going to keep reading.

01:11:59.799 --> 01:12:05.345
In this phase, a new mechanism for securing continuity and change has been added and a new fragility.

01:12:06.427 --> 01:12:12.314
A single generation could lose all the progress and we could be right back to the Stone Age.

01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:29.738
In addition to the biological basis of inheritance and variation provided by the gene complex and chromosomes, man has a cultural basis in the shape of complex ideas, beliefs and purposes and their transmissible results, which is broadly called tradition.

01:12:30.218 --> 01:12:36.722
So if these people understand that, then what would stop them from saying that the way to govern these people is to change tradition?

01:12:38.423 --> 01:12:43.886
The way to govern these people and the way to govern future generation is to take control of this.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.048
And that's what this is about.

01:12:47.108 --> 01:12:49.289
That's what Biology 101 is about.

01:12:49.329 --> 01:13:00.451
That's why teaching it correctly hasn't been done in recent memory, because it is about changing the fundamental knowledge that we transmit about ourselves.

01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:05.472
With its aid, he can accomplish something impossible to any other organism.

01:13:05.512 --> 01:13:11.893
He can transmit experience cumulatively down the generation and incorporate his results directly into the evolutionary system.

01:13:11.913 --> 01:13:14.174
But I just got through telling you that orcas are doing that.

01:13:15.646 --> 01:13:29.939
that the orcas of this generation are eating better than the previous generation with the exception of the fact that the oceans are being killed, that the oceans are being overfished, which is definitely true.

01:13:30.419 --> 01:13:31.100
I'm sure it is.

01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:37.867
Because there is no doubt that there is a carrying capacity on Earth.

01:13:38.487 --> 01:13:53.906
And that the carrying capacity on Earth could temporarily be greatly increased by overfishing and by instead of managing the biosphere as part of our pattern integrity over time and space,

01:13:55.168 --> 01:14:06.697
We instead lord over it, try to take as much as we can while we are still alive and think about ourselves as a single generation with a single opportunity to make a change before we're dead.

01:14:08.839 --> 01:14:18.206
And instead of focusing on planting trees under whose shade we will never shelter, we start to make it into this very urgent, what does he say?

01:14:19.605 --> 01:14:22.987
We are privileged to be living at a crucial moment in the cosmic story.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:28.050
It's not so crucial of a moment that it comes down to a decade like they have made it seem.

01:14:32.993 --> 01:14:34.434
That's really the illusion.

01:14:35.835 --> 01:14:46.782
It's a crucial moment in cosmic timescales where a gardener has formed.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.851
on what was otherwise a unconscious garden.

01:14:52.892 --> 01:15:10.600
And that is a beautiful thing, that if we realized our full potential and realized our full role in creation, not only to be a part of it, but to elevate it, to cultivate it, so that what is inherited by our children is greater.

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.842
And think of it more as stewardship.

01:15:15.102 --> 01:15:17.123
There's no word stewardship here.

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:20.925
The idea that we're only holding something for a little while.

01:15:20.965 --> 01:15:28.355
You know, like you might have a petite Philippe watch from your grandfather and the whole point would be is that you don't own that.

01:15:28.756 --> 01:15:34.704
You owe it to your grandkid to make sure that that watch stays nice enough for him to own it or her to own it.

01:15:38.092 --> 01:15:41.113
And that's not what you're listening, that's not what you're hearing here.

01:15:41.493 --> 01:15:51.896
You're hearing a story about the culmination of creation ending in this moment, in these men, in these times.

01:15:52.856 --> 01:16:00.038
And it is up to us to put our big boy pants on and finally put this ship on course.

01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:05.340
And that's why these people are willing to lie to us in concert.

01:16:07.028 --> 01:16:10.249
And that's what leads to many, many unwitting participants.

01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:24.376
That's why we have the university system we have, and that's why we have Biology 101 being this right here, which leads to PhDs in biology that are in the mouse brain focused on a single ion channel.

01:16:25.156 --> 01:16:26.777
And those are called experts.

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:31.359
And that's exactly what these people needed

01:16:32.293 --> 01:16:39.314
in order for their idea of progress to occur and that our tradition to be usurped.

01:16:42.155 --> 01:17:01.819
And our understanding of ourselves as sovereign spiritual beings with a continuity with our ancestors and our grandchildren, we're supposed to think of this as a crucial moment in human history where we have to make some very big decisions about how pagan we've been in the past or how silly we've been in the past, how long we've been cavemen.

01:17:03.939 --> 01:17:10.223
In the cultural evolution, there is no stark distinction between germplasm and soma between genetic basis and its phenotypic results.

01:17:10.723 --> 01:17:23.670
True, the mainstream tradition is constantly shedding some of its pathological and lunatic fringe, just as the mainstream of material germplasm is constantly shedding some of its pathological and unhelpful mutants.

01:17:24.871 --> 01:17:29.053
But in general, culture is simultaneously manifested and transmitted.

01:17:29.194 --> 01:17:29.674
Wow.

01:17:31.977 --> 01:17:34.218
These are considered to be foundational ideas.

01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:38.300
These are considered to be formulative ideas by the best thinkers of their time.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.401
That's why they're all in the same book.

01:17:40.481 --> 01:17:46.383
Joshua Lederberg, Hilary Koprowski, Herman Muller, and Julian Huxley.

01:17:47.544 --> 01:17:52.146
The mechanisms of biological evolution is now in broad outline established.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.583
We are only beginning to study some psychosocial evolution in the same operational way.

01:17:59.123 --> 01:18:07.529
Maybe we do really need to have control over people's thoughts and behaviors so that humankind as a collective can reach a higher order, a higher ideal.

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:11.231
Some things, however, are becoming clear in the first place.

01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:15.113
Basic elements in cultural transmission and transformation are psychological.

01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:21.818
They are patterns and systems of thought and attitude expressed or formulated in transmissible terms of concepts to values.

01:18:23.092 --> 01:18:26.675
for want of a better word, I shall lump them all together and call them ideas.

01:18:27.095 --> 01:18:36.723
The same thing that Alex Karp wanted to go to Germany and understand, how people know things and whether people can really participate in a democracy or not.

01:18:40.746 --> 01:18:52.476
And so we are talking about fundamentally organizing, reorganizing the way we think about ourselves, so that in accepting Biology 101, we also accept that there are people that are smarter than us, that know better than us,

01:18:54.076 --> 01:18:58.777
And that we shouldn't be so arrogant as to think we can possibly understand this like they do.

01:19:00.438 --> 01:19:03.399
So you might as well just go back to the gas station and do another eight hours.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.440
More precise term than psychological would be psychometabolic.

01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:12.762
Man is equipped with, did I say that for a bit?

01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:14.542
Oh yeah, the material elements transmitted.

01:19:14.602 --> 01:19:19.564
Paintings, documents, machines, jewels, primary literature.

01:19:21.127 --> 01:19:32.040
conclusions, grant applications that are funded, DARPA applications that are leaked, are normally vehicles or products of ideas in this loose and general sense.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:41.091
But if we took control of those things, if we put those things out there for people to see and solve as mysteries, then the ideas would be under their control.

01:19:42.639 --> 01:19:47.584
That's why they had to take over the teaching of biology and the teaching of biology in med schools in particular.

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:50.907
The more precise term than psychological would be psychometabolic.

01:19:51.468 --> 01:19:56.153
Man is equipped with two metabolisms, two systems for transforming raw materials of nature.

01:19:57.321 --> 01:19:58.281
in serviceable ways.

01:19:58.921 --> 01:20:09.224
Physiological metabolism utilizes the raw materials of objective nature and elaborates them into biologically operative psychochemical, physiochemical compounds and systems.

01:20:09.904 --> 01:20:21.948
Psychometabolism, on the other hand, utilizes the raw materials of subjective or mind-accompanied experience and elaborates them into psychosocially operative organisms, organizations of thought and feeling.

01:20:22.836 --> 01:20:34.281
including principles like causation, categories like space, abstracts like truth, precepts and concepts, poems and gods, myths and scientific theories, moral commandments and legal codes.

01:20:34.341 --> 01:20:39.004
The weird thing is, is this doesn't take away the relationship between structure and function in biology.

01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:44.566
It doesn't take away the relationship between action and consequences.

01:20:45.787 --> 01:20:48.008
And so ultimately it depends on what people do.

01:20:51.687 --> 01:20:56.508
And so they are overemphasizing in some ways this thing that happens in between our ears.

01:20:59.309 --> 01:21:09.072
Psychometabolism introduces quality into the quantitative world, produces meaningful patterns out of chaos of elementary experience, enables us to graph extremely complex situations as holes.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:14.545
Psychometabolic processes may become diseased, as in schizophrenics.

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:17.987
Their products may be unrelated to the objective world, as in hallucinations.

01:21:18.467 --> 01:21:21.989
And they may be built on false foundations, like racial ideas.

01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:28.013
Or they may be rendered out of date by the march of knowledge, like the notion of demonic possession.

01:21:28.473 --> 01:21:39.359
But they are necessarily a part of our psychosocial machinery, and it behooves us to study them thoroughly and understand how they work, in case using them to govern people would be useful.

01:21:42.039 --> 01:21:43.920
Of course, that's what they intended to do.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.921
They don't write that out, but they're saying it right here.

01:21:49.082 --> 01:21:51.563
They're saying exactly what Edward Bernays said.

01:21:53.003 --> 01:21:59.546
In psychosocial evolution, the struggle for existence has been replaced by what might be termed striving for fulfillment.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.907
People are now striving for fulfillment on their phones.

01:22:04.547 --> 01:22:08.369
The main operative agency in this phase of evolution is psychosocial pressure.

01:22:11.038 --> 01:22:27.985
This is the resultant of several separate pressures on individuals, loves and hates, desires and hopes, needs and purposes, and it is related to the conflicts and problems thrown up by the march of events or events that are perceived and given direction by some general organization of ideas and beliefs.

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:37.149
It has to operate within an organized system of social institutions, which have risen out of past ideas and events, but may often be out of step with later ideas and their results.

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:46.004
As Darwin first pointed out, there has been, during biological evolution, a trend toward improvement, improvement in efficiency and self-regulation.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:49.646
This trend is inevitable, but accompanied by much waste, suffering and extinction.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.308
There's no other way to...

01:22:54.281 --> 01:22:55.962
There's no way to understate that.

01:22:56.162 --> 01:23:11.151
If evolution by itself was responsible for our existence from a mud puddle and a lightning bolt until now, then the number of positive evolutionary steps that have been missed as a result of random failure.

01:23:13.312 --> 01:23:18.455
In other words, how many times was the perfect kid born

01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:25.099
The perfect chimpanzee baby born, but then eaten by a panther.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:38.507
How many times was the perfect trait of intelligence, did it evolve in a baby that had a birth defect that resulted in him dying anyway?

01:23:39.847 --> 01:23:47.092
How many times was the best mosquito produced, but then eaten by a bird the second day it was born, the day after it was born?

01:23:48.482 --> 01:24:02.530
This has to be happening all the time if we're to believe that Darwinian evolution had any chance of getting anywhere and making any meaningful progress that could be seen on the timescale of those rocks.

01:24:06.021 --> 01:24:28.856
And so even if your imagination is prodded to think on those different timescales, it is often prodded to think on those timescales in a very limited way, which reinforces these ideas instead of inspiring reverence to the complexity that those timescales add, to the impossibility that those timescales add.

01:24:29.256 --> 01:24:35.340
You can't even see what's happening in our timescale if you can't slow down to those or speed up to those, and we can't.

01:24:38.049 --> 01:24:42.314
And so, as Darwin pointed out, there's been all this improvement in efficiency and self-regulation.

01:24:42.354 --> 01:24:49.501
This trend is inevitable, but is accompanied by an impossible to underestimate amount of waste, suffering, and extinction, if it were to be true.

01:24:51.704 --> 01:24:58.031
The trend towards improvement continues in the psychosocial evolution through, again, accompanied by suffering, horror, and evil.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:08.985
And so if we're going to make these choices, there's inevitably going to be suffering, horror, and evil, even if in the end it becomes better.

01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:10.526
Don't you see?

01:25:11.626 --> 01:25:22.173
Starvation, war, might just be necessary for our psychosocial evolution and our biological evolution to start to dovetail together.

01:25:22.233 --> 01:25:22.994
Don't you see it?

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:31.013
The trend toward improvement continues in psychosocial evolution, though again accompanied by suffering, horror, and evil.

01:25:31.053 --> 01:25:51.041
Yet in spite of all the waste and misery, the total improvement achieved during the whole process of evolution from origin of life to present day is almost incredible, from a submicroscopic precellular viroid to a self-conscious, civilized human vertebrate throwing up on its way to a fantastic profusion of organic and cultural variety.

01:25:55.558 --> 01:25:57.559
This is both an encouragement and a challenge.

01:25:57.599 --> 01:26:01.401
The challenge is man's obvious imperfection as a psychosocial being.

01:26:02.022 --> 01:26:06.744
Both individually and collectively, he is sadly in need of improvement and clearly improvable.

01:26:08.325 --> 01:26:12.087
As Herman Muller's chapter said, there's a lot of room for improvement.

01:26:12.848 --> 01:26:15.349
The encouragement drives just in the genetics alone.

01:26:15.849 --> 01:26:22.173
The encouragement derives from the fact that of past improvement, I mean, we think, right?

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:37.945
If blind opportunistic and automatic natural selection could conjure man out of a viroid in a couple million years, a viroid, weird language to choose in 1963, don't you think?

01:26:38.885 --> 01:26:50.108
What could not man's conscious and purposeful efforts achieve even in a couple million years, let alone in a thousands of millions to which he can reasonably look forward?

01:26:53.962 --> 01:26:57.943
Julian Huxley says that we are descended from viruses.

01:27:01.525 --> 01:27:02.685
It's one continuum.

01:27:04.526 --> 01:27:11.388
Lightning bolt struck a puddle, I guess, and then viroids formed, and then bacteria, and then cells, and then multicellular.

01:27:12.689 --> 01:27:13.349
That's what he says.

01:27:14.909 --> 01:27:17.871
The next point to note is that the process of improvement is not continuous.

01:27:17.911 --> 01:27:24.236
It takes place in steps by a succession of successful or dominant types of organization, each endowed with new capabilities and possibilities.

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:27.398
Some once-dominant types become extinct.

01:27:27.438 --> 01:27:31.601
Many do persist, though in reduced number and in subordinate position.

01:27:33.823 --> 01:27:39.967
In psychosocial evolution, the dominant types of organization are of thought and belief and of mind-accompanied behavior resulting from them.

01:27:40.007 --> 01:27:42.269
For brevity's sake, we may call them idea systems.

01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:56.714
Thus, in our own history and in early idea system based on magic and witchcraft became subordinated to new theological and metaphysical dominant system of medieval Christianity, which in turn has become largely superseded by the scientific idea system.

01:27:58.114 --> 01:28:04.777
Today, it looks as if new dominant idea system is in the process of being born a system that I will call evolutionary humanism.

01:28:06.963 --> 01:28:12.049
which would later be the foundation of biology 101 teaching at every medical school in the world.

01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:22.803
Of course, the march of ideas is not an autonomous process, but interlocks with the march of historical events and historical man with a series of stimuli, often in the form of painful shocks.

01:28:24.264 --> 01:28:29.847
And so it's okay to use painful shocks to govern people, even if those painful shocks are murder and lies.

01:28:30.327 --> 01:28:32.888
Human power lust and cruelty may get out of hand.

01:28:32.928 --> 01:28:35.869
Human stupidity may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities.

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:40.191
Apparent advance may eventually become frustrating instead of rewarding.

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:47.735
We are now on the threshold of a truly critical step into the phase of self-conscious evolution, where we take control of the cruise ship.

01:28:48.355 --> 01:28:54.798
The current phase of human organization is ending in a tangle of unresolved problems and self-defeating activities.

01:28:55.258 --> 01:28:58.039
They already knew this in 1963, ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:14.826
And that's why the fundamental structure of Biology 101 is this framework of simplification and this reductionist ideology, which leads to expertise that doesn't feed back to the whole.

01:29:16.294 --> 01:29:41.743
because the idea is to make sure that young people never grow up understanding the complexity of the world around them and instead accept the oversimplified version of that world which allows people more clever than them to rule over them, more clever than them to dictate what they do with their bodies and how they should think about themselves and more importantly what they should teach their children.

01:29:43.191 --> 01:29:48.593
We have abdicated the responsibility and wittingly or unwittingly, that's how they've done it.

01:29:48.673 --> 01:29:53.475
And with biologists like myself, with kids like myself, this is how it gets done.

01:29:53.515 --> 01:29:59.117
And a lot of biology teachers are teaching this unwittingly because they're given a book to teach with.

01:29:59.397 --> 01:30:00.837
And that's what it says in this book.

01:30:01.658 --> 01:30:03.878
And that's what the people that wrote this book were taught.

01:30:05.079 --> 01:30:07.800
This was a useful way to reach this pinnacle.

01:30:09.261 --> 01:30:12.002
And this isn't the pinnacle we want our children to reach.

01:30:12.362 --> 01:30:14.722
We want them to have a broad understanding.

01:30:16.303 --> 01:30:19.663
Like the learned people of old had a broad understanding.

01:30:20.904 --> 01:30:26.345
And once you understand that most of the so-called knowledge that's out there is not knowledge.

01:30:28.666 --> 01:30:38.648
Once you understand how a lot of that knowledge was created using the mechanisms that William Briggs is going to bring us to understand and not what can be now more

01:30:39.509 --> 01:30:42.590
is more often described as Bayesian thinking.

01:30:44.730 --> 01:31:02.895
We can reorient ourselves, I think, and teach our children correctly so that they move on without being caught into this trap of comparing levels of analysis this way or comparing the levels of analysis this way, but start to think about the whole and start to have reverence for it.

01:31:02.935 --> 01:31:08.816
And so then when they go into biology or they go into chemistry or they go into physics, they go in with a type of humility

01:31:11.044 --> 01:31:23.230
and a type of reverence that can allow progress in a way that none of these people want, none of them want, because they want our children to be their experimental animals.

01:31:24.611 --> 01:31:30.834
They need that in order to achieve this next phase that they imagine we're going into.

01:31:31.817 --> 01:31:33.779
That's the level of arrogance we're dealing with.

01:31:34.259 --> 01:31:51.414
That's the level of arrogance that we've come to accept unwittingly because of the way these concepts are taught to us, because of the way these different disciplines are taught to look at each other and how these disciplines are intermingling at this time in academia.

01:31:55.922 --> 01:31:59.303
I think it feels like I should stop there, even though this really wasn't biology.

01:31:59.323 --> 01:32:02.384
This was more like a philosophy of science, biology kind of thing.

01:32:03.305 --> 01:32:17.890
It was meant to piggyback on yesterday's thing, which we were talking about how they get us to think about different things and how they get to talk about different things and whether or not we're talking about models or analogies, because analogies can be

01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:21.011
can be talked about ad infinitum and never tested.

01:32:21.072 --> 01:32:23.573
That's what this guy is using all the time, analogies.

01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:28.616
Because if you use models, then what's implied in a model is that you should be testing it.

01:32:28.736 --> 01:32:33.139
And if it isn't verified by your test, then you would throw out the model.

01:32:34.259 --> 01:32:39.943
And so, so often, what we were given during COVID was actually an analogy.

01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:45.426
Because they were called models because they had math in them.

01:32:46.124 --> 01:32:52.489
But when the math never added up, when Denny Rancourt showed that the math doesn't add up, those models weren't discarded.

01:32:52.509 --> 01:32:53.870
They were continued to be used.

01:32:53.931 --> 01:32:55.672
And then that's why you know their analogies.

01:32:57.353 --> 01:33:06.121
And these ideas in biology, these themes in biology, I would argue that Buckminster Fuller would have us think of them as patterns.

01:33:07.358 --> 01:33:20.331
And what patterns, using the word pattern, if you're fluent in English, should help you to see it as a correlation that should not be attributed too much significance.

01:33:22.294 --> 01:33:25.217
And that way you have respect for what it is.

01:33:25.277 --> 01:33:26.518
If you say themes,

01:33:28.134 --> 01:33:33.979
then it very much implies an idea of this simplification working.

01:33:34.499 --> 01:33:35.820
The simplification helps.

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.644
The simplification is an attribute of the thing that we're trying to study, and it's not.

01:33:41.977 --> 01:33:44.279
And that's why I think it's better to think of it as patterns.

01:33:44.339 --> 01:34:00.070
And I think Buckminster Fuller would beg us to think of it as patterns because then you can start to think of pattern integrities and how understanding life is actually trying to understand how that pattern integrity is maintained across time and space.

01:34:01.607 --> 01:34:15.650
Once you understand the real aim of biology is to understand how these pattern integrities, whether you call them humans or squirrels or manatees, how these pattern integrities are maintained over time and space.

01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:18.310
And we've got no clue.

01:34:18.831 --> 01:34:20.291
These guys have no clue.

01:34:20.331 --> 01:34:25.812
We have little hints, but unless we reorient our children to being reverent to this,

01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:38.569
we are very quickly going to be bamboozled into an enslavement that's based on this kind of themes and models, which are really just patterns and analogies.

01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:44.514
And the patterns are being misrepresented as themes, and the analogies are being misrepresented as models.

01:34:45.194 --> 01:34:46.776
And it is really a semantic war.

01:34:47.950 --> 01:35:05.406
Because just like the no-virus people have very accurately pointed out that virology is based on a bunch of redefined words that don't really mean what they imply, and the only people who seem to understand that are the very specialized virologists for whom these misunderstandings benefit the most.

01:35:06.212 --> 01:35:16.617
The whole point of virology is dependent on the semantic misunderstandings of purification and culture and isolation.

01:35:17.097 --> 01:35:18.738
And the no virus people are 100% right about that.

01:35:20.862 --> 01:35:43.552
But what I find frustrating about them is that they ignore all of the other decades of work, including the work of the Human Genome Project, where synthetic RNA and DNA and the technology to make it with ever more precision and ever more quantity and ever more purity has been one of the only things that these people have been able to accomplish with their rearrangement of our thinking.

01:35:46.001 --> 01:36:02.469
They haven't accomplished uploading consciousness or the vanishing of disease or the magic vaccine for everything, but they've definitely accomplished making DNA and RNA cheaper in higher quantities, in longer sequences, in purer quantities.

01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:08.571
That's the extent to which they've accomplished anything that was described in this book thus far.

01:36:10.132 --> 01:36:13.674
And once you understand that, then you understand why

01:36:14.909 --> 01:36:31.291
how, or you can start to understand why and how, the illusion of a biosecurity state, the illusion of bioterrorism, the illusion of gain-of-function viruses, the illusion of the AIDS pandemic, the illusion of retrovirus, all of these things are based on that fundamental inversion.

01:36:33.342 --> 01:36:50.769
that the ever cheaper and accessible methodology for DNA and RNA production in quantity and purity somehow is also has its correlate in our understanding of that system that we purport to be gaining cheaper access to.

01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:59.213
And that is the reason, the fundamental reason why Biology 101 is taught this way.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:10.666
It's the fundamental reason why biology is taught this way, so that all academic biologists that reach this level will accept the primacy of the gene.

01:37:11.187 --> 01:37:16.810
And therefore, by accepting the primacy of the gene, you accept this idea.

01:37:19.252 --> 01:37:24.835
That now that we've become conscious of it, what other choice do we have than to take control of that knob?

01:37:26.036 --> 01:37:29.638
To take the wheel and direct it.

01:37:32.338 --> 01:37:35.239
And most biology students never get that far.

01:37:35.299 --> 01:37:38.760
It's just kind of like an analogy of the Freemasons.

01:37:39.141 --> 01:37:44.202
Most biologists never get to the 33rd degree where you actually realize that this is all a big scam.

01:37:45.003 --> 01:37:53.486
And the ones that do reach the 33rd degree are happy to tell you over drinks at the Christmas party that you got to understand that this is just about getting grants.

01:37:54.306 --> 01:37:55.687
It's not about the science, man.

01:37:56.328 --> 01:38:00.511
If you can get grants by studying Alzheimer's disease, why would you stick to SK Channels?

01:38:01.151 --> 01:38:02.452
Study Alzheimer's disease.

01:38:04.574 --> 01:38:11.339
That is the foundation of this academic trap that we have all wittingly and unwittingly fallen into.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:22.928
It's a reductionist ideology that can be used to enslave our children if they accept it as a useful way to understand themselves.

01:38:23.775 --> 01:38:26.256
instead of just a useful way to formulate a grant call.

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:34.538
Yesterday I got a little bit of heck for not playing you out, so thanks very much for joining me.

01:38:34.578 --> 01:38:35.219
I'll see you again at 1.15, 1.13, 1.13.

01:38:36.799 --> 01:38:40.020
Oh, that's the wrong song.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:43.001
Sorry, I'm gonna stop that and put this one on instead.

01:38:44.061 --> 01:38:45.222
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:38:45.242 --> 01:38:48.643
I hope this was somewhat useful, not completely rambling.

01:38:50.323 --> 01:38:51.844
and a kind of random read here.

01:38:52.384 --> 01:38:55.044
I know that people have been posting the PDF of this book.

01:38:55.084 --> 01:38:56.785
You can find it on the Internet Archive.

01:38:56.845 --> 01:38:57.445
Please get it.

01:38:58.005 --> 01:38:58.685
Please read it.

01:38:58.786 --> 01:39:02.006
It's really easy reading and it's fun reading because it'll wake you up.

01:39:02.266 --> 01:39:04.167
It'll really wake you up to where we're going.

01:39:04.907 --> 01:39:09.108
I'm going to be starting to pull some stuff out of this one soon and you can find this PDF as well.

01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:14.230
And I'll try to get my act together and also put these on my website for basic reference as well.

01:39:15.731 --> 01:39:18.732
And again, 13-13, 1-13 this afternoon.

01:39:18.772 --> 01:39:25.396
We're going to do the second episode of Matt Briggs' uncertainty class.

01:39:25.456 --> 01:39:26.297
And so I'll see you for that.

01:39:26.337 --> 01:39:30.760
I got to get a drink and go to the bathroom.

01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.400
Thank you very much.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.262
I'm going to go over here.

01:39:34.282 --> 01:39:36.383
I'm going to cut like this.

01:39:36.443 --> 01:39:37.123
How does this work?

01:39:37.343 --> 01:39:37.804
Like that.

01:39:38.144 --> 01:39:39.565
And that needs to go away.

01:39:40.285 --> 01:39:40.906
Thank you very much.

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:41.906
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:39:42.547 --> 01:39:43.227
I hope it was good.

01:39:45.265 --> 01:39:54.767
And again, I'm just going to rewatch these things and try to take this first pass of Biology 101 and make it into a good one next time.

01:39:54.827 --> 01:39:57.228
So I don't know when we're going to get to the end.

01:39:57.288 --> 01:39:58.468
Maybe it'll be in a couple weeks.

01:39:59.368 --> 01:40:00.908
The first mini course will be done.

01:40:01.408 --> 01:40:08.310
We're going to move very quickly now as we start to pick up pace and think about the molecular biology here and try to explain

01:40:09.551 --> 01:40:12.496
What we know and what we don't know in the molecular biological realm.

01:40:12.516 --> 01:40:17.324
We're going to kind of end that that mini course in molecular biology and try to

01:40:18.823 --> 01:40:33.532
try to get to the basics of the pandemic and of the Human Genome Project so that we can be challenged, perhaps, by somebody like Kevin McKernan or anybody else that wants to lend their expertise, again, into sharpening this a little bit more.

01:40:33.572 --> 01:40:37.595
Because I am convinced, absolutely convinced, this is the way forward.

01:40:37.615 --> 01:40:38.315
So thank you very much.

01:40:38.375 --> 01:40:39.396
I'll see you again this afternoon.
