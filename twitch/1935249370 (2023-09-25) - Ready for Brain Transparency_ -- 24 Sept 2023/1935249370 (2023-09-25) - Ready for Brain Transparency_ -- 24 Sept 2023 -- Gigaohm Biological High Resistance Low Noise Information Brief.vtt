01:46.000 --> 01:51.100
Mark has a new 20 minute stream on rumble or 20 minute video on rumble that you should really check out

01:51.100 --> 01:57.880
from his latest live stream from last night if you're not following he's a

01:57.880 --> 02:01.680
tiny glide I don't know what you're doing here

02:01.680 --> 02:24.320
he's scheduled for 16 minutes next he's going on French British Italian Japanese television

02:24.320 --> 02:35.160
people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing he had the exact

02:35.160 --> 02:41.840
location laid out on a map then he liked hid the map in the cigar store Indian for safekeeping

02:41.840 --> 02:49.200
too bad we could have been partners now instead of being rich he's in jail hey like what happened

02:49.200 --> 03:07.760
the Scooby Scooby

03:07.760 --> 03:12.200
one of those apples better be for me

03:19.200 --> 03:48.960
good evening ladies and gentlemen this is Gigo biological it's a high resistance

03:48.960 --> 03:56.160
low-noise information free brought to you by biologists you've been coming to you live with

03:56.160 --> 04:01.720
the last 20 days in a row trying to break this limited spectrum of debate that we are trapped

04:01.720 --> 04:11.880
within and I hope we're making some progress with that breaking free

04:48.960 --> 04:53.680
good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show this is Gigo home biological a high

04:53.680 --> 04:59.240
resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist it's the 25th of September

04:59.240 --> 05:08.480
2023 my name is Jonathan Cooey we have been battling against the bait on TV and social media it's not

05:08.480 --> 05:19.040
getting any easier if someone can put a link to now I'm gonna do it here's a tonic live in this

05:19.040 --> 05:26.960
link here I'm just gonna put this here and I'm gonna put home and I'm gonna take this I'm gonna

05:26.960 --> 05:35.000
take that and I'm gonna put that over here besides Jessica Hockett who I highly recommend I'm also

05:35.000 --> 05:40.600
talking about his atomic live that link is right there he's also got three YouTube channels by that

05:40.600 --> 05:46.200
name his atomic live one two and three the first one might be not called one or might just be his

05:46.200 --> 05:55.480
atomic live please don't take the bait on Stevie and social media intramuscular injection of any

05:55.480 --> 06:00.560
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb and if you

06:00.560 --> 06:05.920
want to get specific about it you can say the transfection is an immunization I'm gonna zip

06:05.920 --> 06:10.880
through this beginning because I think is really clear where we are at and where I think we are

06:10.880 --> 06:19.520
at and so I don't think it's really necessary for us to go too much into detail other than to say

06:19.520 --> 06:26.080
that some people misled us into thinking different things about our biology and that misleading of

06:26.240 --> 06:32.240
us about the biology at the beginning of the pandemic really in early 2020 right through the end of

06:32.240 --> 06:40.560
2020 his one allowed hundreds of thousands of people around the world to be killed basically by them

06:40.560 --> 06:46.880
be mistreated under the pretense that this was a novel virus that everyone was vulnerable to and

06:46.880 --> 06:54.880
that we didn't really know what would work and that limited spectrum of debate around the medical

06:54.880 --> 06:59.920
science of covid was very carefully curated through censorship and through amplification

07:00.720 --> 07:09.760
for a whole series of months and in fact even the orchestrated publicized censorship

07:10.640 --> 07:20.720
of certain dissident voices was part of this this crucial sort of really honing in on this

07:20.720 --> 07:26.800
both sides of this debate and and this is really something that I've been trying to wake everybody

07:26.800 --> 07:32.160
up to because again I really feel like the world has been tricked into thinking that this was a

07:32.160 --> 07:39.120
mystery to be solved and that they have witnessed in real time the solving of this mystery over

07:39.120 --> 07:44.400
these last three years and I believe that to be holy a lie I believe they've lied to us about the

07:44.400 --> 07:50.160
pandemic potential that's accessible in laboratories in order to invert our human

07:50.880 --> 07:56.960
and sovereign rights over our our own bodies and our responsibilities for our children to be

07:56.960 --> 08:02.640
absorbed by the state and for us to need to seek permission for everything and that's what this

08:03.600 --> 08:08.880
debate is all about um match difference with Craig Particope I don't know why that's there

08:09.040 --> 08:14.800
that's why it needs fixing so they told us this crazy thing about you know a debate no truth

08:14.800 --> 08:18.080
of the matter was I was always thought about National Institute of Health but but the fact

08:18.080 --> 08:24.000
of the matter is I was the we are at a place where somebody who has worked with and for the FDA for

08:24.000 --> 08:32.560
maybe two decades is the patent holder and at least one vaccine and is a staunch supporter of the

08:33.520 --> 08:41.520
you know the the huge liability free sort of arrangement that these companies have when

08:41.520 --> 08:45.200
they produce vaccines he doesn't want to talk about that he doesn't want to talk about how

08:45.200 --> 08:53.520
they are exempt from real placebo trials but just based on other already safe vaccines a lot of times

08:54.720 --> 09:00.320
and this disingenuous discussion goes all the way to making fun of people whose children have

09:00.320 --> 09:06.880
been permanently damaged by a vaccination as people that are crazy and this happened maybe

09:06.880 --> 09:14.240
two months ago so three months into this pandemic were exactly where they wanted us to be which is

09:14.240 --> 09:20.960
in this place where we are at odds with our friends and our neighbors about the value of vaccination

09:21.920 --> 09:28.240
and even trying to walk that fine line where you say well maybe the other vaccines are okay

09:28.800 --> 09:33.440
but these new ones are garbage and they were never tested and they should have never been

09:33.440 --> 09:39.680
tested in their transfection you can't even you can't even broach that subject with many our

09:39.680 --> 09:45.760
family and friends and many of our neighbors simply because the TV has absolutely checkmate

09:45.760 --> 09:53.040
brainwashed them into believing that that isn't an unfathomable lie you could never think that

09:53.040 --> 09:58.560
that could be true and one of the reasons is because of the amazing spectacular commitment

09:58.560 --> 10:04.560
to this lie that people like Paul Offit Joe and shamelessly will go into a camera

10:06.320 --> 10:11.120
and they will say things they know in their heart are in truth they know what they have to know

10:11.120 --> 10:16.960
they're lying because they're not dumb people they're not making mistakes

10:17.120 --> 10:25.280
and so think about the spectacular nature of this man's behavior when we know that it can't be as

10:25.280 --> 10:32.640
black and white as he's making it out to be let's see if i can make this bigger

10:35.200 --> 10:41.680
oh how i got this like that can i do that you allow me to make you bigger

10:42.560 --> 10:44.560
but you like this

10:48.000 --> 10:51.120
the truth of the matter was i was always thought about the nationalist suits of health but but

10:51.120 --> 10:56.960
the fact of the matter is i was the i was a patent holder on something it became a vaccine now now

10:56.960 --> 11:01.120
i'm the intellectual property of my hospital therefore the hospital really owns the patent but it does

11:01.120 --> 11:06.160
you get tired of explaining it it never convinces anybody anyway because do you work with a pharmaceutical

11:06.160 --> 11:13.440
company there for your evil wait wait wait wait look look at this it's an anti-vax protestor

11:16.160 --> 11:21.760
yeah wow you know what's amazing so see this is this is amazing

11:23.200 --> 11:27.760
really you can't see him in the camera yes so guys guys z-pack wait that's really true

11:27.760 --> 11:34.880
yeah there are actually not a joke does not a joke there are actually anti-vax activists

11:35.440 --> 11:38.320
outside the window right now

11:41.120 --> 11:47.280
and now they're gone because tom turned him off this is what we want to talk about too you hear

11:47.280 --> 11:51.280
him yeah what is he saying is that i can't i don't know but tom's gonna make sure that the

11:51.360 --> 11:53.680
door is locked and also that logan's gun is caught

11:56.480 --> 11:58.720
you hear him yes yes silly dog

12:03.520 --> 12:11.600
to sell drugs and pull off it that's made billions of drugs millions from his vaccine i think he had

12:11.600 --> 12:18.000
the heavy vaccine rotavirus rotavirus right if we've got to be really careful here because we can

12:18.000 --> 12:24.240
fall into the trap and i'm not saying that he's a trap but i'm saying that social media may have

12:24.960 --> 12:30.640
made him jump into this trap and then used him unwittingly to set everybody else that watches this

12:30.640 --> 12:38.240
and shares this video to fall into the same trap where we say that paul often made millions off of

12:38.240 --> 12:45.760
his vaccine when in reality he didn't make that much he probably made 500 000 because the majority

12:45.760 --> 12:50.240
of the money went to the university under which he was working at the time that the patent was

12:50.240 --> 12:55.760
granted to him but nevertheless it also really helped cement it helped cement his place in the

12:55.760 --> 13:03.040
faculty it helped you know grease the wheels for his his rising star as the director of his institute

13:03.040 --> 13:10.480
and whatever and whatever and whatever because intellectual property is very very important and

13:10.480 --> 13:16.400
it becomes increasingly important for young faculty members as a way of adding to their resume

13:16.400 --> 13:24.800
in this sea of candidates a few meaningful patents is ridiculously valuable even if they just mean

13:24.800 --> 13:29.120
that you have the potential to generate more patents should they get you under their roof and

13:30.000 --> 13:36.960
yes he had a rotavirus vaccine patent but we've got to be very careful when we start throwing around

13:36.960 --> 13:40.880
numbers like millions and millions of dollars because it may very well be that he didn't make

13:40.880 --> 13:48.800
millions of dollars himself it may be that millions of dollars were given to the university and some

13:49.440 --> 13:55.440
substantial portion of those were were allowed to be used for his salary and for his lab fees and

13:55.440 --> 14:02.640
for his his his lab employees his lab budget and so you could see that as the same thing but

14:02.720 --> 14:08.240
technically it's not and it becomes deniable by paul office we've got to be very careful but

14:08.240 --> 14:14.000
still i understand why he's upset i understand what he's trying to do here but just you need to

14:14.000 --> 14:21.920
see it for what it is and why this social media is constantly a trap believe what one of the

14:21.920 --> 14:28.080
vaccines that killed my daughter they're alive on facebook she died within 24 hours of vaccines

14:28.160 --> 14:35.600
that was a week and a half before she died she was very beautiful and we're here to honor zara

14:35.600 --> 14:43.760
and to just to make these people realize that we're not scared of them and you know together

14:44.640 --> 14:50.320
we can overcome the propaganda and brainwashing because vaccines are an avoidable unsafe i'm not

14:50.320 --> 14:54.240
saying that you shouldn't take any vaccines but they're they're not interested in doing any

14:54.240 --> 15:00.880
science to make them safer or no science happens when zara died all they try to do is

15:00.880 --> 15:06.080
deny disavow and sweep under the carpet because there's no money in dead babies and guess what

15:07.040 --> 15:13.680
she didn't die of six she was too old for six it was sudden unknown death within 24 hours of

15:13.680 --> 15:26.160
14 vaccinations so let's go show pull off it and zenov hey hey guys that's my daughter oh he's

15:26.160 --> 15:34.800
laughing laughing that's my daughter look look at this it's an anti-vax protester

15:37.440 --> 15:42.400
yeah wow you know what's amazing what's amazing is that i don't think paul offered

15:42.400 --> 15:48.800
thinks it's as funny as z-dog does and actually that shows you the infantile nature of z-dog's role

15:48.800 --> 15:56.320
in this whole thing it shows you his lack of professionalism it shows you his lack of depth of

15:56.320 --> 16:03.680
understanding and it also shows a kind of denial of the reality you could have also seen this as a

16:03.680 --> 16:08.560
moment of professional possibility where he could have said why i wonder if we could bring this

16:08.560 --> 16:15.280
person in here and talk to him and create a moment but that's not what these people are all at all

16:15.280 --> 16:21.840
about like an anti-vaxxer protester is very different than somebody who's just saying hey

16:23.120 --> 16:32.320
hey we got to be honest about this and i find this very important to acknowledge that this

16:32.320 --> 16:39.600
happened i know i used this video once before but it is a very it's a very dark reality where

16:39.600 --> 16:51.280
we are right now um i had a friend come in last night to Pittsburgh and this friend is staying in

16:51.440 --> 17:02.320
uh is staying in in the city and he's got some stuff to do for his work but i'll probably see

17:02.320 --> 17:05.680
him again tomorrow night but he was here last night and i picked him up at the airport brought him

17:05.680 --> 17:14.560
back to the house and fierla and i and him hang out um after the kids went to bed and he is not aware

17:14.960 --> 17:24.320
like to the point of didn't really still didn't really know who uh Robert F. Kennedy jr. was in

17:24.320 --> 17:29.040
children's health defense before last night i mean he knew again i tell me the name of that

17:29.040 --> 17:35.520
organization you work for again and so just because of the nature of his job and you know he's got

17:35.520 --> 17:39.600
two teenage daughters one that just went off to college one that's in high school you know it's

17:40.560 --> 17:45.680
his wife has a career etc so i get it he's very busy and doesn't know but

17:46.320 --> 17:52.480
there's a pretty rude awakening to find out that his mild-mannered you know biologist friend

17:53.360 --> 17:58.640
who at best was a loud-mouthed teacher has uh making a living on the internet with

18:00.160 --> 18:05.120
with sound effects and uh music and and and graphics

18:05.200 --> 18:13.600
um but that's where we are that that these these people like z-dogs viewers

18:14.960 --> 18:21.120
are are jaded and and and biased to the point where they may not be

18:21.120 --> 18:26.080
savable until something very very drastic happens with the rest of the people who are

18:27.280 --> 18:31.280
and these people are going to be offered up as evidence all the time because

18:32.240 --> 18:36.240
that that's what they want they want this kind of evidence to be what you see

18:37.520 --> 18:40.720
isn't it we'd like to talk can we come in

18:43.360 --> 18:45.360
can we come in we brought a book

18:47.600 --> 18:52.320
these people they're not about any type of safety what they want to do is make

18:52.320 --> 18:56.320
and so now they're going to bang on the window and then you heard the rest so i mean i'm not i'm

18:56.320 --> 19:01.040
not trying to overdo the the whole thing about this but i just want you to understand that

19:01.120 --> 19:06.800
this this drama that's been created by these people over here that includes me

19:08.000 --> 19:14.400
trying to figure out if this was a lab leak or not in 2020 and and and doing streams with people

19:14.400 --> 19:22.560
and given my whatever presence and time to groups of people who are trying to push the

19:23.360 --> 19:28.320
worst-case scenario and so essentially i would go on stream with multiple people

19:28.800 --> 19:33.840
and i would be the only one who is arguing for natural immunity or previous immunity

19:35.200 --> 19:40.960
and the not no need for transfection and these four other people would say well i don't agree

19:41.600 --> 19:46.320
i think a billion people are going to die and it's worst-case scenario red dragon event with a

19:46.320 --> 19:47.360
two-year horizon

19:50.400 --> 19:56.720
and so i was there i was doing the performance as well because they got all of our hair on fire

19:57.600 --> 20:02.160
and the question is at one point in time do we were we listening to one another and thinking

20:02.160 --> 20:10.320
together and then slowly drifting out of this red triangle where we question the protocols first

20:10.880 --> 20:15.520
you question the evidence of spread and we question the meaning of these variants

20:16.720 --> 20:19.520
i'm not a very good weatherman i can't point to this stuff on the screen

20:19.680 --> 20:26.480
but we're seriously in a stage now where this is how we break free because

20:27.360 --> 20:32.480
otherwise we have to listen to the whole firehose all the time and we have to try and process

20:32.480 --> 20:38.640
the whole firehose all the time but if we can start to understand what they're trying to do

20:38.640 --> 20:44.960
with this firehose which is keep our ads always focused on the scooby-doo mystery of lab leak

20:45.600 --> 20:51.840
or gain a function lab leak or a natural nasty virus and what's going to come next

20:53.040 --> 20:58.480
then we can start to make some choices that are meaningful instead of continuing to run

20:58.480 --> 21:01.440
in the same direction that we've been running in for the last three years

21:03.040 --> 21:07.040
and so i think it's important to look at the people who are on this thing i think it's important

21:07.040 --> 21:11.200
to look at what peter makala and other people say on a regular basis and then

21:11.200 --> 21:17.120
keep updating the image that we have here so that we understand who to trust

21:17.680 --> 21:23.760
who's related to who who's done streams with with which people and then complained about it later

21:25.840 --> 21:29.680
i haven't done any streams with anybody that got arrested for january 6th

21:32.000 --> 21:37.280
i haven't done any streams with with uh i don't know

21:38.160 --> 21:43.440
i guess i did some streams with paul katrel so you could say that i'm connected to him

21:44.640 --> 21:49.040
i did some streams with kevin makaren i guess you could say i'm connected with him

21:49.760 --> 21:51.600
or was that the whole idea all along

21:53.680 --> 22:00.000
i never had kevin makaren linked on my website but kevin had me on his website for almost three

22:00.000 --> 22:03.200
years i had to beg and plead and complain for him to take it off

22:03.920 --> 22:09.840
and so you can see some of these people like george web and how he associated himself with

22:09.840 --> 22:15.200
marcoolak and other people and harassed other people took other people's research and twisted it

22:15.200 --> 22:22.240
around as another guy whose job was just meant to confuse and to associate you know

22:23.360 --> 22:30.400
with people who who have more integrity in order to bring their own it that person's integrity into

22:30.480 --> 22:38.240
question and i i think we're we're witnessing a lot of this stuff it's really interesting that

22:38.240 --> 22:44.000
robert malone and and and harret van den basch actually worked together and we're in a movie

22:44.000 --> 22:49.600
together in spain and and pretended like they weren't sure if they knew each other or not

22:50.640 --> 22:57.600
but he dropped harret's name in a in a in a live stream with paul katrel so they damn well do

22:57.600 --> 23:03.120
know each other it's extraordinary really it's very extraordinary what's going on and where we

23:03.120 --> 23:08.400
are at this time frame because a lot of people if they've been paying attention over the last three

23:08.400 --> 23:14.880
years would start to see that the dissonant communities a very small group of people that

23:14.880 --> 23:20.400
travel around the world and hot tub together it's a very small group of people that complain

23:21.360 --> 23:26.560
of each other and sue one another but nothing ever seems to happen in any of these lawsuits

23:27.280 --> 23:31.840
george can't even seem to serve robert malone even though robert malone has a lawyer which means

23:32.800 --> 23:34.480
it's pretty hard not to serve it

23:37.200 --> 23:42.400
and robert malone's been suing the bragons for how long now how long has he been selling the

23:42.880 --> 23:50.560
book how long has he been promoting george web as his own private cyberstalker i don't know

24:02.000 --> 24:05.760
one of the things that i think they're doing a lot of which really annoys the hell out of me

24:06.320 --> 24:13.760
is brainwashing people into thinking that somehow we are so close to being able to interface with

24:13.760 --> 24:20.320
our brain in a meaningful way that without only can we augment it but we can upload and

24:20.320 --> 24:27.600
download information into memory and brain and skill and somehow augment the IQ or thought

24:27.600 --> 24:33.440
powers of the brain by actually physically interfacing with wires through the skull

24:34.320 --> 24:42.560
wireless i don't care how and this is a a presentation from the world economic form

24:42.560 --> 24:47.760
dabo's meeting where a woman is going to talk to us about this a woman who she calls herself

24:47.760 --> 24:55.280
a futurist do you remember that word well this is an extraordinary talk which will give you

24:55.280 --> 25:02.080
insight into the level of excuse my language but bullshittery that has been used on the rich

25:02.880 --> 25:08.640
venture capital you know people that are bottling their own

25:09.280 --> 25:16.400
farts and smelling them later kind of people these these people have been brainwashed the people

25:16.400 --> 25:22.160
inside of our government bureaucracies have been brainwashed into believing that gain of function

25:22.160 --> 25:30.720
viruses are real and that brain implants are really just a matter of choice away it's if we

25:30.720 --> 25:35.600
we didn't have so many ethical qualms about cutting holes in people's heads we would already

25:35.600 --> 25:42.160
have this done a long time ago here we go hello everybody i'm nicholas tompson i'm a

25:42.160 --> 25:46.480
cov Atlantic oh yeah i just remember you know this what this is really all about right is getting

25:46.480 --> 25:53.440
rid of the idea that there's anything sacred about you or your baby i mean you can start

25:53.440 --> 25:57.680
like a bonsai tree you know you can start training babies right away you can shape their head

25:57.760 --> 26:00.640
anyway you want to stretch their legs out whatever you want

26:02.240 --> 26:07.040
and these people really want you to believe there's no such thing as God's creation there's no such

26:07.040 --> 26:14.960
thing as a sacred you know lying you don't cross there's no kind of complexity here where

26:16.320 --> 26:22.320
you know we have to respect this some kind of complexity that we can't distill down anymore

26:22.320 --> 26:27.600
and then therefore we shouldn't mess with that part of it no kind of talk like that at all instead

26:28.240 --> 26:35.120
just like it i'm gonna keep saying it just like Robert Malone said that when he was working in his

26:35.120 --> 26:39.920
postdoc he decided to work on retroviruses because he was sure there would be a geneticist at a

26:39.920 --> 26:47.200
hospital at every hospital in 10 years curing childhood genetic diseases with retroviruses

26:48.320 --> 26:50.880
well fast forward 40 years later and

26:50.880 --> 26:58.160
then there are no retroviruses that are being used to cure childhood diseases

26:59.360 --> 27:04.800
and this is the same kind of talk with a little bit more pizzazz and a little bit of sharp language

27:04.800 --> 27:10.480
and and a sharp suit but she's going to try and tell you the same sharp stories about how

27:10.480 --> 27:17.520
just around the next bend just over the next hill holy man you know stay awake we're almost there

27:17.600 --> 27:23.840
buddy we're gonna we're gonna break through you're not gonna believe the kind of stuff she's

27:23.840 --> 27:29.760
promising and i will be your moderator today well you're going to have an incredible session

27:29.760 --> 27:36.160
star the show is Anita Farahani she's a futurist and legal ethicist at Duke and she's so smart

27:36.160 --> 27:40.960
and so interesting you're gonna learn a ton this is how it's gonna work legal ethicist at Duke

27:40.960 --> 27:46.160
she's gonna come on stage and talk and then we're gonna do a little q&a questions from the audience

27:46.160 --> 27:52.720
and that'll be a wrap and you'll leave enlightened and excited so first off a video it's gonna make

27:52.720 --> 27:58.480
you see the future and understand a wonderful future where we can use brainwaves to fight crime

27:58.480 --> 28:05.920
be more productive and find love let's roll you're in the zone even you can't believe how productive

28:05.920 --> 28:12.080
you've been your memo is finished your inbox is under control and you're feeling sharper than

28:12.160 --> 28:17.360
you have in a decade sensing your joy your playlist shifts to your favorite song

28:17.920 --> 28:23.920
sending chills up your spine as the music begins to play you glance at the program running in the

28:23.920 --> 28:29.920
background on your computer screen can i just interrupt here and go back just a second to show

28:29.920 --> 28:36.320
you to make you listen to what they said what the lady said at the very beginning and then i'm

28:36.320 --> 28:41.680
going to pause it again you can't believe how productive you've been your memo is finished

28:41.680 --> 28:46.800
zone be more productive and find love here we go let's roll listen carefully please you're in the

28:46.800 --> 28:54.400
zone even you can't believe how productive you're in the zone now i think it would be okay

28:55.840 --> 29:02.640
with my friend Rodney for me to say that they had been they have been using Rodney

29:03.600 --> 29:07.760
as an example at all of these kinds of meetings now i don't think he's ever been to the w

29:08.320 --> 29:13.840
world economic forum but he's been to a a few food conferences and a lot of TED conferences

29:13.840 --> 29:24.240
and a lot of other conferences where he opens with his own version of of kind of a fascination

29:24.240 --> 29:30.640
with the sacred biology where you get to a stage where you don't really understand how

29:31.680 --> 29:37.840
the the body and the brain are working together to accomplish perfection but after a few

29:38.880 --> 29:45.760
or many extremely painful attempts at a ridiculously impossible stunt how these

29:46.480 --> 29:52.400
friends of his are able to go down these rails and land it and all this other stuff and before

29:52.400 --> 29:56.640
they do that they're falling but their body's falling somehow in a way that doesn't break stuff

29:56.640 --> 30:06.320
much and his whole explanation is the idea of getting into uh what she says you're in the zone

30:07.680 --> 30:16.160
in a flow state where your brain and your body are anticipating the coming reality in such a

30:16.800 --> 30:24.000
precise manner that as you the board flips underneath your feet your feet are dragging up

30:24.000 --> 30:29.440
to the tip of the board in just the right way so that it starts to rotate and then clear the

30:29.440 --> 30:36.080
rail and then come back in a flat position right before your feet come down and your brain and

30:36.080 --> 30:43.520
your feet and the the feeling of the board on your feet as it comes down and the predictability of

30:43.520 --> 30:49.200
what it's going to feel like when the back wheels hit before the front and knowing exactly how far

30:49.200 --> 30:54.160
your feet have to be in over or in front of that back wheel in order to make sure that you go that

30:54.160 --> 31:03.040
way and not over the top of it all of these things become automatic and it's it's this kind of high

31:03.040 --> 31:10.080
level of total body skill hand-eye coordination the whole nine is hand body coordination i i body

31:10.080 --> 31:18.160
coordination that anybody that skateboards does and if it's not clear i don't skateboard that skate

31:18.160 --> 31:27.360
board back there represents Rodney and his encouragement of me but his message coming through me

31:28.080 --> 31:37.600
is that this is a sacred thing this idea of practicing something so

31:41.840 --> 31:47.120
that i don't know i'd like to use the word religiously but practicing with something with so much heart

31:47.120 --> 31:59.040
and so much focus and so much belief that that is possible not only possible but repeatable

32:00.880 --> 32:10.160
i don't know if any there's a there's a

32:10.160 --> 32:21.680
I'm not even really sure what this thing is called but when I was living in Norway and we had a

32:21.680 --> 32:30.960
secret Santa I got this as a secret Santa gift in the end um from a Japanese colleague and I

32:30.960 --> 32:36.960
believe it's a Japanese toy but it could be from another Asian country and I apologize for not

32:37.040 --> 32:40.160
knowing that I hope it doesn't make me racist but if you look on

32:41.360 --> 32:46.880
if you katama I think is what they're called if you look is that right did somebody say it um

32:48.880 --> 32:55.040
the the this thing if you go on the internet and find people who are very skilled with it

32:55.920 --> 33:01.120
you won't believe the kinds of tricks that they can do and repeat it and repeat them over and over

33:01.120 --> 33:09.840
again it's a level of of balance that requires high functioning cerebellar work all body movement

33:09.840 --> 33:16.000
in real time with an object that's moving with gravity and it's juggling in a sense but it's

33:16.720 --> 33:23.200
it's very fine hand movement extremely crazy stuff that people learn to do with a piece of wood with

33:23.200 --> 33:31.280
a ball on a stick on a string not much different than a yo-yo or a piano

33:33.920 --> 33:41.040
you know a guitar drum set maybe these are all things that at some moment become a

33:42.160 --> 33:48.480
a synergy between your brain and your muscles and your conscious understanding of what's coming

33:49.360 --> 33:55.200
and that's what makes it so nice to be a musician in a band you understand what's coming together

33:55.200 --> 34:02.480
with other people and you can anticipate it and move through it together it's a very very beautiful

34:02.480 --> 34:08.000
thing that I've only been able to experience a few times in my life I'm not lucky enough to

34:08.000 --> 34:13.440
ever been in a band or part of a team for a real long time high school you know but

34:14.240 --> 34:20.400
these are extraordinary things and they brought Rodney in to talk about this because their goal

34:20.400 --> 34:28.560
was to take the sacred out of it their goal was to make it seem as though we're about to take the

34:28.560 --> 34:35.840
sacred out of the flow state we're about to take the sacred out of the sacrifice that Rodney Mullen

34:36.560 --> 34:43.680
the sacrifice that Rodney Mullen made in order to become the greatest flatland skater of all time

34:45.120 --> 34:51.200
have you heard the story about him jacking his leg into a wheel well so that he could break away

34:51.200 --> 34:58.480
the cartilage and stuff that built up in his in his hip and how he was grinding that out

34:58.480 --> 35:04.560
with a screwdriver for a year or so so that he could gain mobility from his hip bones back

35:05.520 --> 35:07.440
have you seen the way the guy walks now

35:10.880 --> 35:17.520
there's a reason why he became so good it's because he went through the same pain and suffering

35:17.520 --> 35:23.520
that everybody else has to go through if they want to become a master of something there's nobody

35:23.520 --> 35:29.280
that sits down in the piano and doesn't have to practice you might understand it you might have a

35:29.360 --> 35:36.480
very you might have a very technical grasp just lucky enough for you your brain is just the right

35:36.480 --> 35:43.760
amount of visual learning and sound and whatever that you learn faster but a piano is not something

35:43.760 --> 35:52.480
that's built into anybody music might be but they want you to believe that all of this

35:52.640 --> 36:01.360
what can be gained by hard work and sacrifice dedication to something can instead be replaced

36:01.360 --> 36:09.680
with installations and reprogramming and and and monitoring so that we can understand it enough

36:09.680 --> 36:14.800
with enough data we'll be able to crack the code of what goes on in a brain

36:15.600 --> 36:24.640
and I'm just I'm sad that there's no way for me to share with you all that I've seen as a

36:24.640 --> 36:30.560
neurobiologist all that I've looked at under these microscopes there's no way in hell

36:31.760 --> 36:35.040
we're ever going to usefully augment the function of the human brain

36:37.360 --> 36:43.120
it's too complicated it's too much of an organ it's not a

36:45.120 --> 36:50.080
it's not accessible in that way and you're going to hear it here and I need you to understand that's

36:50.080 --> 36:59.680
why this is so important to me because neurobiology does it medicine does it they all doing it they're

36:59.680 --> 37:04.560
all trying to get rid of the sacred part of biology that part which is so complex you can't distill

37:04.560 --> 37:10.800
it down anymore and trying to pretend that we are at the cusp of cracking through the brain

37:10.800 --> 37:15.680
and the genome and protein folding and how the ribosome works and nanomachines

37:16.480 --> 37:19.440
and it's all it's all mythology

37:22.080 --> 37:28.080
and they want you to believe it's so bad because if you do you'll jump into their control mechanism

37:28.080 --> 37:34.080
before you know it you won't be able to get out if you've been your memo is finished your inbox is

37:34.080 --> 37:39.760
under control and you're feeling sharper than you have in a decade sensing your joy your

37:39.840 --> 37:45.680
playlist chefs to your favorite song sending chills up your spines the music begins to play

37:46.480 --> 37:52.480
you glance at the program running in the background on your computer screen and notice a now familiar

37:52.480 --> 37:58.240
site that appears whenever you're overloaded with pleasure your theta brain wave activity

37:58.240 --> 38:05.200
decreasing in the temporal regions of your brain you mentally move the cursor to the left and scroll

38:05.280 --> 38:11.920
through your brain data over the past few hours you can see your stress levels rising as the deadline

38:11.920 --> 38:17.920
to finish your memo approached causing a peak in your beta brain wave activity right before an

38:17.920 --> 38:24.560
alert popped up telling you to take a brain break but what's that unusual change in your brain

38:24.560 --> 38:31.040
activity when you're asleep it started earlier in the month you send a text message to your doctor

38:31.040 --> 38:36.960
with a mental swipe of your cursor could you take a quick look at my brain data anything to

38:36.960 --> 38:43.680
worry about your mind starts to wander to the new colleague on your team whom you know you shouldn't

38:43.680 --> 38:50.320
be daydreaming about given the policy against intra office romance but you can't help fantasizing

38:50.320 --> 38:56.400
just a little but then you start to worry that your boss will notice your amorous feelings

38:56.400 --> 39:00.880
when she checks your brain activity and shift your attention back to the present

39:01.680 --> 39:05.680
you breathe a sigh of relief when the email she sends you later that day

39:06.320 --> 39:11.280
congratulates you on your brain metrics from the past quarter which have earned you another

39:11.280 --> 39:18.160
performance bonus you head home jamming to the music with your work issued brains hunting earbuds

39:18.160 --> 39:24.800
still in when you arrive at work the next day a somber cloud has fallen over the office

39:25.600 --> 39:32.160
along with emails text messages and gps location data the government has subpoenaed

39:32.160 --> 39:37.680
employees brainwave data from the past year they have compelling evidence that one of your

39:37.680 --> 39:44.400
co-workers has committed massive wire fraud now they're looking for his co-conspirators

39:45.040 --> 39:50.560
you discover they are looking for synchronized brain activity between your co-worker and the

39:50.560 --> 39:56.080
people he has been working with while you know you're innocent of any crime you've been secretly

39:56.080 --> 40:01.200
working with him on a new startup mentor shaking you remove your earbuds

40:04.880 --> 40:08.320
that's pretty funny what do you think is it a future you're ready for

40:11.920 --> 40:16.160
you may be surprised to learn that it's a future that has already arrived

40:16.800 --> 40:21.840
everything in that video that you just saw is based on technology that is already here today

40:22.640 --> 40:28.960
artificial intelligence has enabled advances in decoding brain activity in ways that we never

40:28.960 --> 40:37.920
before thought possible you've heard a lot about AI over the past few years here at Davos it's been

40:37.920 --> 40:45.680
the talk of the hour but i want to talk about it in a different way which is the ability to decode

40:45.680 --> 40:53.920
brainwave activity after all what you think what you feel it's all just data data that in large

40:53.920 --> 41:01.040
patterns can be decoded using artificial intelligence consider this the average person thinks thousands

41:01.040 --> 41:07.760
of thoughts each day as a thought takes form like a math calculation you're happy so this thing

41:07.760 --> 41:13.120
that's being shown back here behind her is not real that's just a cartoon that's supposed to

41:13.120 --> 41:18.400
make you imagine this is what brain activity looks like and this is not what brain activity

41:18.400 --> 41:24.160
looks like keep that in mind because that's part of the enchantment right they want you to believe

41:24.880 --> 41:30.240
that if they have enough data and enough data means that the AI can solve it and if it doesn't

41:30.240 --> 41:34.400
work with that much data they need more data and if it's not going to work now they need a better

41:34.400 --> 41:42.240
device that can collect more data tired you're hungry you're elated neurons are firing in your

41:42.320 --> 41:49.360
brain emitting tiny electrical discharges as a particular thought takes form hundreds of thousands

41:49.360 --> 41:56.080
of neurons firing characteristic patterns that can be decoded with EEG or electroencephalography and

41:56.080 --> 42:05.200
AI powered devices so the EEG would be reading the brainwaves through the the skull i guess or you

42:05.200 --> 42:10.800
know you guys you want to implant something in the ear i guess you're in the skulls i guess you

42:10.800 --> 42:21.120
could do that too but there's no way to adequately sample the just the neocortex even

42:22.320 --> 42:26.320
by doing EEG on the skull or i'm gonna open even you took the skull off

42:28.000 --> 42:33.760
i mean a huge portion of the brain is actually inside you know you can't read it from the outside

42:33.760 --> 42:39.520
edge so it's a very strange it's already very strange like what can you really read with a

42:39.520 --> 42:46.480
headband and a few electrodes you know it's it's absurd if you put a stethoscope on the outside

42:46.480 --> 42:50.320
of your monitor you know or four of them you know really what are you going to learn from that

42:51.040 --> 42:57.200
it's really silly silly talk in fact what you're seeing here is my brain activity while i'm wearing

42:57.200 --> 43:03.680
a simple device like the one on the right we're not talking about implanted devices of the future

43:03.680 --> 43:10.560
i'm talking about wearable devices that is generated by the signals that they get from here

43:11.280 --> 43:18.720
and then extrapolated into a 3d model that's meant to sell that product and meant to sell the idea

43:18.720 --> 43:24.560
that this is possible i guarantee you a hundred percent bs that are like Fitbit's for your brain

43:26.000 --> 43:32.400
it used to be that there was very little Fitbit for your brain is exactly the the stupid analogy

43:32.400 --> 43:38.960
that gives it all away what is a Fitbit it keeps track of your your breathing rate maybe

43:38.960 --> 43:45.120
and your blood pressure and your heartbeat at most so you get three parameters on your whole body

43:46.400 --> 43:52.800
and so let's say you could get three parameters from your brain three electrodes let's say you

43:52.800 --> 44:00.080
could get 30 electrodes what could you possibly learn about a brain with a few more than a million

44:00.080 --> 44:07.360
neurons i mean we're talking about some serious nonsense here we're talking about

44:07.360 --> 44:12.960
some extremely serious nonsense here and sold like she's so confident that this is all true but it's

44:12.960 --> 44:21.840
so not true little we could tell from EEG activity but already using consumer wearable devices these

44:21.840 --> 44:28.800
are headbands uh hats that have sensors that can pick up your brain wave activity earbuds

44:28.800 --> 44:34.560
headphones tiny tattoos that you can wear behind your ear we can pick up emotional states like

44:34.560 --> 44:42.320
are you happy or sad or angry we can pick up and decode faces that you're seeing in your mind

44:43.120 --> 44:51.120
simple shapes numbers your pin number to your bank account it's not just your brain activity

44:51.680 --> 44:56.240
here that we can pick up we can also pick up your brain activity in different places like

44:56.240 --> 45:01.360
as your neurons fire from your brain down your arm and send signals to your hand to tell you

45:01.920 --> 45:10.080
how to type move all of that could be decoded through electromyography and so now we're talking

45:10.080 --> 45:14.560
about something completely different where you're listening to your feeling the muscles as they move

45:15.680 --> 45:22.400
and remember what's going to be here it's not anything magic if the machine learning algorithm

45:22.480 --> 45:32.000
is taught by you typing and then you typing some more and you typing some more and so it gets the

45:32.000 --> 45:37.200
key to all of the signals that it's reading yeah then sure it can pick up what you type

45:37.760 --> 45:42.240
how many letters are there on a keyboard and numbers how many different fans gestures are

45:42.240 --> 45:47.440
involved in typing and how many electrodes do you need to have to pick up on that

45:47.440 --> 45:56.000
you see the deal is here is that if you're going to follow the muscles that's ridiculously easy if

45:56.000 --> 46:03.280
you're going to teach a a brain mind interface how to control a mouse or how to follow your eye move

46:03.280 --> 46:10.320
that's that's easy but we're talking about real things not what she's talking about now which is

46:10.400 --> 46:18.640
trying to confuse the simple measurements and their predictive capability if taught what the

46:18.640 --> 46:24.240
right answers are and what those signals most likely mean then yeah to a certain extent there's

46:24.240 --> 46:32.960
nine numbers if you teach a machine what your temporal lobe looks like when you think numbers

46:32.960 --> 46:38.800
and there's a signal there then you could teach it that sure you could but you put that helmet on

46:38.800 --> 46:44.560
any other person it's not going to be the same signal it might not even be in exactly the same

46:44.560 --> 46:50.160
place or with the same combination of sub regions and you can only read the outside

46:52.480 --> 46:58.320
it's extraordinary bs we're not even five minutes in and that's what you're saying here is a device

46:58.320 --> 47:05.360
now in the form of a simple wearable watch that can pick up that activity and in one of the pivotal

47:05.360 --> 47:11.440
acquisitions of the field meta acquired this company control labs in 2019 because major

47:11.440 --> 47:19.120
tech companies are investing and helping to make these devices universally applicable as the way

47:19.120 --> 47:25.600
in which we interact with the rest of our technology in fact the coming future and i mean near term

47:25.600 --> 47:30.880
future is these devices being the primary way in which we interact with all of the rest of our

47:30.880 --> 47:38.240
technology rather than a mouse or a keyboard you can simply swipe with your mind move your hands

47:38.240 --> 47:44.400
more seamlessly when you're in VR or AR use your brain as the way in which you interact with all

47:44.400 --> 47:50.080
of the rest of your technology which is an exciting and promising future but also a potentially scary

47:50.080 --> 47:56.640
one a transformative one one that will change the way that we interact with other people and even

47:56.640 --> 47:59.760
how we understand ourselves let's take a look

48:07.200 --> 48:13.920
neural interfaces when they work right and we still have a lot of work to go here feel like magic

48:14.480 --> 48:20.080
so if you send a control to your muscle saying i want to move my finger it starts in your brain

48:20.080 --> 48:25.920
it goes down your spine through modern neurons and this is an electrical scene so we should be able

48:25.920 --> 48:32.240
to grab that electrical signal on the muscle and say oh okay the user wants to move their finger

48:33.040 --> 48:38.880
what is it like to feel like pushing a button without actually pushing it that could be a

48:38.880 --> 48:43.600
simple so how are you not pushing the button if the finger that you would normally push the button

48:43.600 --> 48:49.040
is actually going to move and the muscle it's going to push the button is actually going to move

48:49.840 --> 48:56.800
and so the physical interaction electrically with some device with a put and push button motion

48:57.600 --> 49:02.080
is activating it how is that not pushing the button they're making it seem like it's some kind of

49:02.080 --> 49:10.320
magic but it's really not simple as hey i just want to move this cursor up or move it left

49:11.040 --> 49:16.400
well normally i would do that by actually moving but here you're able to move that cursor left and

49:16.400 --> 49:21.360
it's because you and a machine agreed which neurons mean left and which neurons mean right

49:21.360 --> 49:27.520
you're in this constant conversation with the machine this new formula is such bullshit they're

49:27.520 --> 49:32.960
just looking at the motion that they can detect in your you know what they're going to do right

49:32.960 --> 49:39.840
you're going to put the device on and now swipe left how is it any different than putting your

49:39.840 --> 49:45.200
fingerprint on the fingerprint reader okay now put it off center ten times now put it up

49:45.200 --> 49:51.360
aside down ten times now put it on the left ten times and then eventually it gets all the

49:51.360 --> 49:56.080
possibilities that are close enough so that it can definitely tell the difference between you

49:56.080 --> 50:03.280
and somebody else done now we can read fingerprints with one swipe on a macbook and you can just

50:03.280 --> 50:10.480
open it up it's so easy as long as you first input 100 times a picture of your thumbprint

50:10.640 --> 50:18.880
as long as you sit down in the chair and thumb wrestle yourself for five minutes and follow

50:18.880 --> 50:24.160
the directions on the screen of how to thumb wrestle yourself then the watch can learn how

50:24.160 --> 50:29.440
you're thumb wrestling yourself and predict what you want to do and they'll roughly coincide done

50:30.320 --> 50:39.040
how stupidly easy is that that's not magic that's not reading your mind that's not you having a

50:39.040 --> 50:45.520
conversation with a freaking machine that's you having a wristwatch that takes the place of a

50:45.520 --> 50:50.080
freaking mouse come on this is ridiculous

50:52.720 --> 50:58.800
control it requires us to build an interface that adapts to you and why is that screen floating in

50:58.800 --> 51:03.760
front of her face an exciting future see where's that coming from it's a future that has already

51:03.840 --> 51:12.000
arrived in many contacts throughout the world and especially in workplaces so it turns out that

51:12.000 --> 51:17.600
one of the most compelling early applications of this technology is to be able to decode at least

51:17.600 --> 51:23.440
some simple effective states of individuals that can potentially improve their well-being

51:24.240 --> 51:31.280
potentially improve productivity but certainly transform what our lives look like in the workplace

51:31.280 --> 51:37.200
and in our everyday activities well we can't literally decode complex thought just yet

51:37.920 --> 51:43.280
there's a lot that we can already decode that's quite relevant see that's a huge gap we can't

51:43.280 --> 51:50.720
complex we can't decode complex thought just yet but there's a lot we can do like interpret the

51:50.720 --> 51:56.800
movements of your thumb and use your eye movements to direct a mouse on a screen as long as you wear

51:56.800 --> 52:00.160
our big fat glasses and use our special screen it works great

52:02.880 --> 52:10.880
we can read your mind as long as you read this book with our with our glasses on and our our

52:10.880 --> 52:16.720
headband on you read this list of words over and over and over and again out loud and four days later

52:16.720 --> 52:21.360
we'll be able to read your mind it's great as long as you stick to our script and only use those

52:21.360 --> 52:24.880
words in those combinations we can usually figure it out it's like 80 correct

52:26.400 --> 52:31.440
that's what this technology is that's what she's selling you as all we're almost at complex thought

52:33.600 --> 52:38.000
we're almost able to drill a hole into the back of your monitor and figure out how it works

52:39.520 --> 52:46.400
we're almost able to use a stethoscope and a flashlight and a couple thermal sensors and a

52:46.400 --> 52:53.440
few wires to figure out and augment the picture on the screen it's no problem and you know what's

52:53.440 --> 52:58.800
really cool is you can take the HDMI cord that's coming out of the coming into the back of your

52:58.800 --> 53:02.880
monitor and you can just monitor the signal that's going through it it's really easy

53:03.920 --> 53:07.840
and that's what they're going to do they're going to monitor the signals going through your brain

53:07.840 --> 53:12.880
in a useful way by just monitoring the electrical signals that they can catch through your skull

53:12.880 --> 53:14.000
i'm sure that's plenty

53:16.960 --> 53:25.200
whoops for the workplace environment consider the fact that right now many workplaces

53:25.840 --> 53:32.080
have individuals who have to be awake and alert at all times in order to do their jobs well

53:33.360 --> 53:40.800
sometimes that doesn't happen take this example where this trucker decided to take a 20 hour shot

53:41.280 --> 53:48.480
for a 1500 mile ride it's well exceeding the amount of time that any trucker long haul trucker

53:48.480 --> 53:56.240
is supposed to drive his employer didn't discover his choices until the fatal accident that was

53:56.240 --> 54:02.880
disastrous for the company and cost many lives but he could have known much sooner he could have

54:02.880 --> 54:09.120
detected whether or not the trucker was entering into the earliest stages of micro sleep starting

54:09.120 --> 54:14.960
to go from being alert to tired well before it occurred and he could have done so through a

54:14.960 --> 54:21.920
simple hat a simple wearable hat that has embedded electrode sensors that would pick up brainwave

54:21.920 --> 54:27.840
activity and give a score between one to five to help the employer and the employee know

54:28.400 --> 54:33.280
what stage of alertness the person was experiencing and whether or not they were starting to fall

54:33.280 --> 54:38.560
asleep now you might think no so is that that sounds like some serious reading of the brain there huh

54:39.280 --> 54:47.200
boy that's sophisticated as hell okay we have driver assist technology in cars already why do we need

54:47.200 --> 54:52.880
this it's because this happens much sooner much more accurately and it gives you the real-time

54:52.880 --> 54:59.440
information that you need in order to make choices to intervene before a person is parallously

54:59.440 --> 55:04.640
exhausted and we as a society should want that we should want the technology that enables us to be

55:04.640 --> 55:10.240
safer to all be able to exist in an environment we should want that where we pay people enough

55:10.240 --> 55:15.040
money so that they don't have to drive 20 hour shifts in order to make that extra buck and we

55:15.040 --> 55:20.640
should you know pay people enough money and and work people in a way that's very humane so that

55:20.640 --> 55:26.640
they don't break the rules maybe we can just do it that way instead of putting electronic sensors

55:26.640 --> 55:31.600
on people's heads i don't know it doesn't look like brain reading yet though this is not really

55:31.600 --> 55:36.960
brain control it's not really anything like what she's talking about even though she wants

55:36.960 --> 55:42.400
you to make you believe that reading brain waves is a great idea and that everybody should be

55:42.400 --> 55:49.840
recording their brain waves as if they matter as if they mean anything what you have to understand

55:49.840 --> 55:56.000
here is this is all part of the bamboozlement they want you to imagine that we're this close you

55:56.000 --> 56:01.680
know all you got to do is start wearing this shit and before you know it yep it's all going to be

56:01.680 --> 56:05.920
there the AI is going to figure it all out it's going to become sentient the whole nine yards

56:07.200 --> 56:12.320
and it's ridiculous it's ridiculous they've shown us a picture of a lady wearing a

56:12.960 --> 56:18.160
Wonder Woman headband and now they're telling us that we're going to have some kind of baseball cap

56:18.160 --> 56:22.320
with a sensor inside of it hopefully it'll be a better looking trucker cap than that

56:23.200 --> 56:29.200
and that sensor will understand when somebody is going into micro sleep and they'll get a call

56:29.200 --> 56:34.880
from their boss and then the you know the family of five won't get killed what kind of nonsense is

56:34.880 --> 56:40.720
this commercial drivers or individuals who need to be wide awake are wide awake when they're

56:40.720 --> 56:48.160
supposed to be because when they're not the consequences are disastrous while playing crashes are much

56:48.160 --> 56:53.760
less frequent than other forms of accidents at least 16 playing crashes in the past decade

56:53.760 --> 57:02.320
have been attributed to pilot fatigue which is probably why in more than 5,000 companies across

57:02.320 --> 57:08.640
the world employees are already having their brainwave activity monitored to test for their

57:08.640 --> 57:14.400
fatigue levels whether it's the Beijing Shanghai line where train conductors are required to

57:14.400 --> 57:19.040
wear hats that have sensors that pick up their brain activity or mining companies throughout the

57:19.040 --> 57:26.240
world brain activity is such a broad stroke of a term to use here and she does that on purpose

57:27.520 --> 57:33.360
I mean their brain activity could be associated with a tilt sensor too their brain activity I mean

57:37.440 --> 57:41.840
chances are very good that the only thing that they can do is tell when somebody starts to daydream

57:41.920 --> 57:48.160
or go to sleep you can't tell whether they're adequately paying attention to where they're driving

57:48.160 --> 57:53.040
they could be reading and probably paying attention just as hard as if they were looking out the

57:53.040 --> 58:00.880
window but I don't think these people are capable of what they're claiming they're capable of but

58:00.880 --> 58:04.960
what they're trying to argue here is that this is the way forward that we're going to do this

58:04.960 --> 58:10.240
that you're going to have you know an apple headband or something that's going to keep track of all

58:10.240 --> 58:16.080
this stuff employees are already having their brain activity monitored and it may wear it very

58:16.080 --> 58:22.320
well may be something that we want to embrace as a society okay you might be shuttering right that

58:22.320 --> 58:27.440
was certainly my first reaction when I discovered that we are tracking brainwave activity okay so

58:27.440 --> 58:32.400
here she's starting the enchantment number two where you know she tries to identify with her

58:32.400 --> 58:36.560
audience you know I know you're probably worried this was the way I fell too but now follow me

58:37.200 --> 58:42.160
into the next deep dark cave in the workplace and that we can do it at all but I believe we

58:42.160 --> 58:48.000
need to have a much more nuanced conversation about it because I think done well neuro technology

58:48.000 --> 58:53.840
has extraordinary promise done poorly it could become the most oppressive technology we've ever

58:53.840 --> 58:59.600
introduced in a wide scale across society we still have and so isn't it weird it's almost like saying

58:59.600 --> 59:05.600
slavery could be the best way forward in terms of trying to make everything work out so that

59:05.600 --> 59:12.720
everybody has a job and everybody pitches in and even the useless eaters become useful but

59:12.720 --> 59:18.320
slavery has a very bad side and it could be one of the worst things we ever bring back from the past

59:18.320 --> 59:25.760
so we've got to be very careful monitoring genetic information of babies and all of their medical

59:25.760 --> 59:31.520
data and giving it freely to pharmaceutical companies could be useful for curing all kinds

59:31.520 --> 59:36.640
of diseases it'd be a great thing could also be a super scary thing if it gets in the wrong

59:36.640 --> 59:45.840
hands or somebody decides to make a bio weapon it's all the same kind of bamboozling where the

59:45.840 --> 59:51.360
trade-offs for this future godlike power are that we could also have future demons

59:52.720 --> 59:57.920
and so as we expand the power of the good gods we also expand the power of the bad demons

59:58.480 --> 01:00:06.960
but that comes along with taking the place of our deities of the past and shedding the shackles

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:14.480
of our previous ideas of what's sacred that's what they're talking about here it's absolutely

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.920
pathetic these futurists and when you see through them they're just shenanigans they're just charlatans

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:28.160
blasphemers they're they're they're they're off to make it right all right well does the same

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:35.280
analysis hold true if instead of trying to monitor whether a person is falling asleep or a week

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.520
we decide that we want to monitor their attention levels to see whether or not they're paying

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:46.160
attention and being productive i would argue maybe not how many of you wear something like an apple

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:53.040
watch that bit smart device yeah many people it's a many billion dollar company i mean many

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.320
billion dollar industry at this point wearable device is quantifiable self is just a widespread

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:05.680
movement most people are quantifiable self what a stupid it's all this this is all part of the

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.760
enchantment this ridiculous language to make you think that there's so much lingo around it because

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.640
it's such a consensus of interest such a consensus of what the next thing is that there's all this

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.360
lingo that you're never heard of but she could just you know throw out there and spread around

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.800
like cards like a dealer very comfortable with at least some forms of human quantification in

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.600
fact it's become so widespread that most people feel like there's not that much to worry about when

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.160
it comes to doing something like monitoring your heart rate

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.120
but it turns out that that kind of technology in the workplace particularly when it's used to

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.720
monitor productivity of employees where they're moving throughout the factory floor whether or

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.600
not they're taking breaks or unscheduled breaks is the kind of thing that employees resist unionized

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:07.600
against rise up against and undermines morale what we've seen consistently is companies from

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.840
amazon to tesco to walmart and others have introduced what is considered to be bossware or

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.080
surveillance technology that employees really don't like it even if it makes their lives better

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:30.000
okay well if you don't like your job just quit but what if there's nowhere to go what if everywhere

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.360
has ubiquitous monitoring in fact during the pandemic what we so what is that proposal for you

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:44.480
holy crap that almost took the wind out of me so employees they don't like it employees don't

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.640
like it when you make them wear a device that allows you to walk them or walk watch them walk

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.760
around the warehouse monitor them on their breaks they don't like that they don't like bossware

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.440
so what happens if you can just quit and there's no other place to go because everybody's using it

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.000
that's exactly their plan that's why she's saying it here right now that's how we fix that problem

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.640
guys we're all in the room together we're all bosses of big companies wearing iPhones or wearing

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.840
eye watches and that's what this is about that's what she's saying right now

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:30.320
it's incredible so if we just get everybody to do it that no one can complain about it anymore

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.960
we're all private business in america so we can do it all we want found was that 80 percent of

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.680
companies admitted that they use at least some forms of so-called bossware technology to monitor

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.520
the productivity of their employees whether it's a white collar employee monitoring was on their

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:53.280
screen or in any other context surveillance is part of our everyday lives surveillance for

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.160
productivity is part of what has become the norm in the workplace and maybe with good reason

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.080
nine out of ten employees waste time during the workday they focus on other things there may be

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.920
good reasons why we want to be able to find better ways to monitor whether somebody is paying attention

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:16.640
or they're doing something different the newest way to monitor attention is through a device like

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.200
this one these are ear pods that are launching later this year these ear pods much like the video

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.480
you watched earlier are ear pods that can pick up brainwave activity and tell whether or not a

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:36.320
person is paying attention or their mind is wandering okay well you might think fine but even if

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.400
we can tell whether a person is paying attention or their mind is wandering you can't tell

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.760
what they're paying attention to you would be wrong turns out that you can not only tell

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.800
whether whether a person is paying attention or their mind is wandering but you can discriminate

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.680
between the kinds of things that they're paying attention to whether they're doing something like

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:03.280
central tasks like programming peripheral tasks like writing documentation or unrelated tasks

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.240
like surfing social media or online browsing when you combine brainwave activity

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.680
see what she's saying here is that if you classify behavior into central behaviors peripheral

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:21.200
behaviors and unrelated behaviors to work then we can decode brainwaves after a time of learning

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:30.400
for each individual person do you see and so yes over people these brainwaves average out to

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.600
something like very high concentration middle concentration distracted broken concentration

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.200
just like when you're watching the tv show versus when the commercials come on you're

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.920
surprised that if they monitor a few places in your brain they can see the difference between

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:52.800
that are you really surprised are you surprised that they can see the difference between somebody

01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:00.720
trying to work on a program and the logic of a program versus surfing twitter are you surprised

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:08.880
so then why would you be so afraid of it it's not decoding anything it's like saying do you think

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.560
you could tell the difference between somebody who's actively using the bathroom and somebody

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:18.800
that's not i can i can think of all kinds of different ways to set up a device that would be

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.400
able to tell the difference between somebody using the bathroom and somebody who's not

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.560
and these are very similar things

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.640
if the tasks that you classify as central peripheral and unrelated

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:40.000
have signatures that are on a macro scale very different sure that's really great you can tell

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.800
the difference between those things but that doesn't mean that five years from now we're

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.240
going to be able to tell what central task you're working on or what peripheral task you're

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:57.600
thinking about or what social media landscape you're surfing and what you're actually looking at

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.040
but that's the implication you know just like when we talk about retroviruses and the fact that

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:11.040
we can now make them because DNA is even cheaper to make doesn't mean we understand

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:21.120
and it's the same exact thing and just because we're getting ever closer to making super cheap

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.000
DNA doesn't mean we've learned how to use it and we learned how it expresses and you know how it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.960
orchestrates the pattern integrity that's life

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.320
and so just because you can tell the difference between a very concentrated person working on a

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.280
program and a person who's surfing on the internet doesn't mean that eventually you're

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.840
going to be able to read the brain or augment its function that's the whole point here

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.240
just because we can sequence cheap now doesn't mean we're eventually going to win because now we

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.080
can really feed the data into that EI and it's cheap just because we start recording from a

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.800
bunch of people's eye eye watches doesn't mean we're suddenly going to learn how the brain works

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.960
or if people start wearing these hats that's not how this works

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:20.960
the activity together with other forms of software and surveillance technology the power

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:27.920
becomes quite precise so what do we do with this what do we do with technology that enables us

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:34.480
to monitor brainwave activity for attention do we embrace it do we resist it I believe that

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.760
there is a pathway forward with such technology but it's putting it in the hands of so you know it

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:46.240
would be great if you just stopped here you could really make a shitty work week and make a really

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:53.040
shitty workplace where people really did get tracked around the warehouse and get tracked on

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.520
their behavior and get tracked on their attention and get graded on their performance that you

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.920
could do that and maybe that's what they want to do

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.120
but that doesn't mean that they're reading your mind or that they're going to control you in a

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:15.360
way that it's any different than having a dog collar on you this is not magic technology

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:24.800
this is not mind reading but they want you to think it is so that you feel limp you feel helpless

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.720
this is like them telling you that it would be really handy if everybody would just wear ankle

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:38.240
ankle bracelets yeah it'd be really handy but we're not going to do it

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.440
and they want you to believe that this is some kind of inevitability

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:52.160
employees enabling them to use it for themselves as a choice whether or not they want to focus

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.120
whether or not they want the technology in order to improve their own performance but not using it

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.720
as a measure of their brain metrics to decide whether to fire them hire them or to watch for their

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.240
lagging cognitive decline over time and using it as a way to discriminate against them

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:18.400
we might soon even use the technology to help people wake back up this is a haptic scarf that

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.120
MIT Media Lab has developed which uses brainwave technology in a responsive way

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.720
MIT Media Labs is one of those very very shady places

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:39.760
one of those very very shady places that a lot of these people have gone in and out of

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.040
and many people that go through MIT Media Labs go on to work for the government

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.080
MIT Media Labs is a place where

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.480
where

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.480
Esfelt I believe is associated with MIT and the media labs Esfelt is the guy who invented genetic

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:09.040
gene drives and has contributed a lot to the refinement of directed evolution and protein and

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:16.880
enzyme function very interesting reference to give a person a little buzz literally

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.440
when their mind starts to wander to help them refocus and hone their attention

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.640
there's another pathway forward with this technology which I find to actually be quite

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.320
exciting and something that I think companies should be experimenting with and that is the use of

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.080
the technology to make the workplace a more responsive workplace to the individual worker

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.160
we've all heard the whole idea that robots are coming for our jobs that there will be no jobs

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.040
left for humans with generative AI I think we have good reason to wonder how we're going to

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.040
integrate that in ways that keep us relevant and challenged and important in the workplace

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.120
but there's a different pathway forward which is a responsive workplace one where humans and

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:08.240
robots and AI work seamlessly together in order to optimize a better and healthier workplace

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.280
in one experiment Penn State researchers were able to show that by monitoring brainwave activity

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:22.480
with AI in a factory setting the robot could send stress levels in the individual and change the

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.720
speed with which they were giving tasks to the human calibrating it so that rather than suffering

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:35.120
from cognitive overload it would bring it to levels of cognitive load this idea of cognitive

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.760
ergonomics is what I think is the future of the healthier workplace a place that adapts to our

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:49.680
abilities slows down when we need to slow down and helps us to reset so that we don't suffer from

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:56.880
endless cycles of stress in fact Microsoft recently did a study on employees during the pandemic

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.960
using brainwave activity they were able to discover a couple of interesting insights one is zoom based

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.000
or other video based meetings are more tiring for our brains than in-person conversations

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.120
and this is because of misaligned gaze because of also the way we've scheduled it

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.040
people do back-to-back meetings where you have five-minute breaks in between

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.200
they also discovered something else that's quite interesting which is that the different backgrounds

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.240
for each person is also more stressful for the brain so they introduced together mode

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.240
which has the same shared background for each of the employee each of the people who are on the

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:36.000
screen which brings down stress levels all responsive to brainwave activity these are

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.360
innovations that can make our lives better so what's the pathway forward in some ways and in some

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:51.360
context surveillance of the human brain can be powerful helpful useful transform the workplace

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.760
and make our lives better it also has a dystopian possibility of being used to exploit

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:06.880
and bring to the surface our most secret self it threatens fundamentally what our own self

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.480
identity is in some ways and threatens to become a tool of oppression but we can make a choice

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.480
we can make she's telling you what they want to do with it they want to use it as a tool of oppression

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.280
they want you to get rid of your they wanted to take away your feeling of having a self identity

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.520
and being a a sovereign human they wanted they know it will do that that's not a possibility that's

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.640
what it will do but they have to acknowledge that in a way that makes it seem like they're

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:43.600
going to try really hard to avoid it you know but we're going to jump out of this plane and so

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:49.440
eventually you better hope your parachute is going to open but hopefully it will i mean this is a

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:58.240
plan so it i i guess i can keep it going i'm going to speed it up a little bit because i had

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.440
one other video i wanted to show and i didn't want to take all night i did want to be done on time

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.280
and i can't speed it up shit okay here we go a choice to use it well we can make a choice to have

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.080
it be something that empowers individuals that helps them gain insights into their own mental

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.520
health and well-being improves their own productivity and wellness and sets them on a pathway

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.880
so there's no debate about whether this is a violation or or encroaching on what is sacred

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.720
there's no there's no thought of this at all rather this is kind of how are we going to pitch it

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.760
how do we bring this home to our corporate board meeting how do we work this in over the next five

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.840
years that's what this is all about and now i want you to i'm just going to move to this next

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.160
video because i i don't think we need to hear her anymore even i she might say something more

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:59.360
interesting afterward if somebody wants to watch the whole video please do i'll put the link in the

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.920
chat here and then maybe and then maybe we can do it but i want you to hear what this kind of

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.680
shit excuse me i'm just wearing a lot tonight what this kind of stuff has done to our

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:19.840
our lesser of our our discussing moderators on the internet here so this is another

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:26.000
this is a person who gets like cast irl will be live in miami with point us it's probably mean to

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.320
say i shouldn't say that nor a link this the guy who gets many many views every night and he always

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.400
assembles a consensus illusion consensus illusion is a bunch of people who are going to discuss

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.880
something and usually come to an agreement and that agreement serves as an illusion of consensus

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:51.040
that many of their viewers then are bamboozled by and this guy gets 45 000 viewers sometimes at

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.360
night and so he's got quite a lot of influence a lot of people watch his videos and cuts afterward

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:03.200
and so listen to them talking about the idea that neural link which is a implantable device of

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:12.480
some kind made by elan musk is going to be started to use um and it's it's quite comical really because

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:23.440
this is one of those things which will go so so so spectacularly wrong um but let's just listen

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:30.720
to what just this headline does to people who have been faithfully watching television and trying

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:37.920
to decode it faithfully using social media to try and learn the science of neural link and the science

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:44.640
of the brain and maybe watching joe rogan and a few other things but not really reading books

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.320
not really reading papers not really trying to understand where the cutting edge is but just

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:57.680
assuming that whatever's on the internet is pretty close first in human clinical trials is open for

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:03.120
recruitment and i want to soften this a little bit what's going to happen right now is that

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.920
people who are paralyzed who are deaf who can't see are going to get a chance to have their lives

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.240
back or you know if some people are i want to imply that some people are you know miserable or

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.120
unhappy where some people are totally fine and happy and they've adapted and they're living good

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.840
lives but some people may be thinking this is my chance to maybe walk again this is why neural link

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:27.920
is awesome the scary thing is neural link is the is the door that once you open it up the path out

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:34.320
leads to people isolating themselves in pods where they have feeding tubes full of pumping bug

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:40.000
slime into their bellies while they live in the matrix by choice but this is the the latest big

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.280
news Elon must read about it saying the first human patient will soon receive a neural link device

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.920
this ultimately has the potential to restore full body movement in the long term neural link

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:56.160
hopes to play a role in AI risk civilization risk reduction by improving human to AI and human

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:03.040
to human bandwidth by several orders of magnitude imagine if Stephen Hawking had had this imagine

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:11.040
if Stephen Hawking had had this it's such a ridiculous statement but taken at very much face value by

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:17.840
these some of them are not children that worship or at least are paid to worship or

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:24.880
suggest or or coached to worship Elon Musk and this sort of futuristic vision of things without

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.040
actually worshiping it essentially they say it's coming and it's inevitable but you don't really

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:39.920
want it and they talk in crazy terms like he just did where people are going to just plug in

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.080
and turn off as if we're ever going to be able to interface with the brain in that way

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.880
and so that's what they're going to talk about here is the idea that if this technology keeps

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:58.880
going you're going to be able to experience a video game just plug in and experience a video

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:05.200
game and if you could experience a video game why in the world would you ever want to live a real

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.480
life that's what they're going to say right here and that's what they want you to believe that's

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:16.640
what the controllers want you to think that this is an inevitability what they've been showing

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:26.240
you in cartoons is inevitability and it's not an inevitability it's a it's a mythology that they

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:34.960
are pushing on us in order to get us to go limp and we have to stop it right now we can't let

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:42.640
these people make us believe that these these futuristic places are even are even destinations

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.880
that are possible to reach because they're not um I also want to just point out what he's saying

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.560
about AI risk civilization risk reduction he's saying that if humans integrate with the AI it

01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.960
won't destroy us he's talking about integrating human brains with other human brains and I think

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.560
Elon does great work and I think it's important that you know to a certain degree like we certainly

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:12.640
want to cure people who are paralyzed with medical technology but I got to say man it's going to

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:18.080
get scary you guys ready to plug your brain into the matrix yeah absolutely not no that's it's like

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.240
yeah I like I like what Elon Musk is doing with twitter I'm not about to let him put a computer

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.080
in my head I mean that that's ridiculous and you know the other aspect of this is that the first

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.840
people to take advantage of this will be like the elite the people in the um you know and take

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:39.280
advantage of it in a way that is more than just like helping a paralyzed person walk which you

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.640
know obviously that's the way that they're going to introduce it because who would disagree with

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:48.880
that but you know it's way beyond that when Neuralink is capable of in terms of like increasing your

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:56.400
IQ or your all sorts of stuff and so you know you're going to have a sort of feedback loop where

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.120
the people in the highest positions of power in the society get it first and that just solidifies

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:08.400
their position as they you know continue to uh because you know having a brain interface is so

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.400
much better than having really high speed access to all of the wall street trading data before

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:23.440
anybody else gets it having a brain interface will make people like billionaires they'll be even

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.200
more powerful if they have a brain interface as opposed to you know I don't know

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:37.280
secret access to lobbying organizations in the government and and personal relationships with

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.760
everybody in the bureaucracy no no it's the brain chip that we got to worry about and the fact that

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:48.560
those rich people are going to get it before us that's that that's the kind of nonsense we're

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:55.120
talking about here like yeah I'm really mad because I think everybody all those rich people

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.440
are going to get even smarter than the poor people because the rich people will get the super

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:07.280
super brain chips before the poor people and then it'll be even more racism and more class struggle

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.280
because now you'll have a bunch of rich white kids walking around with a with a helmet that

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.840
makes them smarter it's never gonna it's never going to be okay and it's just ridiculous

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.120
where the levers of power are they never going to talk about it and they want you to

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:32.800
to worry constantly about the future coming troubles the ways that the rich people are going to get

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.200
ahead the way that the corporations are going to enslave us so that you never think about changing

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.840
the vaccine act from 1986 or change just wiping the prep act right off the map

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.840
so you never think about just changing fundamentally the way the CDC and the FDA work

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.720
but you focus on absolute nonsense like the possibility of eventually is going to be brain

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:01.680
implants and stuff man and those rich people are going to get them before the poor people

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:07.440
occupied that they say those who have quadriplegia due to cervical spine a spinal cord injury

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.160
or ALS may qualify so for now i mean we're not talking about plugging people's

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.760
brains into the matrix nora link is actually is going to be saving lives and and curing

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:19.760
ailments and i can respect that i know a lot of people are saying don't rag on nora link because

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.600
it's going to provide uh you know treatment for a lot of people and that's really really cool

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.760
my fear i mean all this is is that now they're going to try and stick wires in a brain and and

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:38.080
rewire uh the the spinal cord they're going to try it like that hasn't been tried in animals

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:44.640
before i mean this is just a joke to me they must know or they don't know and they're just doing

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.640
it anyway they've been coached to say this stuff and just go along with it read this out loud

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:58.880
do this this press release because if you could do that you know restore quadriplegia's motion

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:06.240
with with a precisely robotically implanted brain computer interface the prime study

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.720
because it's going to be robotically implanted right there's a machine you're going to put your

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:17.520
head in that's going to do the surgery it's all just so ridiculous it's just all so ridiculous

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.680
but the idea is if they're doing it then i guess it must be real if they leaked it then it must be

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:31.200
real i mean if it's a cdc leaked slide set that it must be real i mean if it's a

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:39.200
a department of defense database leak it must be real if it's a press release where they say

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.400
they're going to use a precisely robotically implanted brain computer interface it must be real

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.320
and if Tim Poole says they're going to cure quadriplegics with it at first before they give it to the

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.600
rich people it must be true it's just that if we ever get to the point where we can

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.440
read right into a person's brain experiences yeah no one's going to live in a little bit anymore

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.680
well the other aspect is you know the the gray reset the the world economic form right you'll

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.920
own nothing you'll have no privacy but you'll be happy i mean that that dates back to the you

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.760
know 1960s when you had Aldous Huxley saying basically they'll put you in a position where you ought

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.080
not be happy but you'll be made happy when they literally are releasing dopamine so you're sitting

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.520
there on like a and you know this is like the 1960s version but you're sitting there on an

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.960
assembly line you should be like miserable like god this is awful but instead you're like this

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.960
is the best thing i've ever this is the most fun i've ever had is putting together these car parts

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.200
because they're literally activating the pleasure center of your brain as you're doing this this

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.040
do you guys uh you guys know what uh you know you know the story of the monkey's paw right

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.680
yes the monkey's paw it gives you three wishes but it twists your wishes in awful ways

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:48.880
and or or there's just like needful things this trope of be careful what you wish for has been

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.080
done for a long time i remember when i was little i can't remember what what movie we were watching

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.920
i was watching with my family and it's like somebody gets a monkey's paw whatever and then

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.600
they're like i wish for a million dollars and then all of a sudden like the person's wife walks out

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.160
to pick up a newspaper it's hit by a car killing her instantly and then the you know the guy in the

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.400
car is like oh no i'll give you a million dollars settlement or whatever like he or an insurance

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.640
payout they're like you're being awarded a million dollars so that the wish is twisted my dad was

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.000
always like you know you know how you beat the monkey's paw you wish for happiness

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.640
wish that you were happy and what could it do to twist it and i was like it'll put you in a mental

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.200
institution in a straight jacket banger head on the wall and go put your happy and i'm like

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.880
that's an interesting way of viewing happiness is that it's technically the truth yeah there's a

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.360
happiness they'll give you there's a truck palinic uh short story that's kind of like that where

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.920
it's this phenomenon where uh all these kids in high school realize that if you like electrocute

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.760
yourself you basically like lobotomize yourself and so it's like a trend of kids like

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.160
electrocuting themselves and lobotomizing themselves because they'd rather be happy and

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.960
mentally incapacitated than have to deal with the stresses of uh of real life yeah people are

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:05.280
going to be like in the real world i work at uh uh you know i i work a menial job but when i go home

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.640
to my pot and plug in man i host this big i do think that that's what facebook would like you

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.080
to think meta is going to be i think that that's what a lot of gaming services would like kids to

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.360
think of as for tonight their avatars as themselves i think that's what they want and so i think it's

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.000
very interesting that tim pool's talking about it in reference to elan musk without any criticism

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.760
for it without any talk of sovereignty or freedom or sacredness it's very very very curious isn't it

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:45.120
but it shouldn't be really because this is exactly how the control system works and we're going to watch

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.520
a few other videos as we go forward and a few other people like tim pool and we're going to see how

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:59.760
this narrative a futurist narrative a transhuman narrative a a pandemic narrative has been layered

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.760
down through the internet where this guy and another guy will argue about what Brett Weinstein

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.960
said to sam heris and one will take one side one will take the other side and so if tim gets a

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:20.560
million and a half views and sam cedar gets a million and a half views and Brett Weinstein

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:27.520
gets a million and a half views you start to see how the whole narrative has been curated because

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:35.120
eventually if the algorithm is putting him and Brett and z dog into your feed and into your

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.920
algorithm eventually you're going to stumble on one of these two arguing about the other two

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:47.200
and then you're going to be sort of enticed to take the illusion of consensus on the natural

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:52.800
side or the illusion of consensus on the lab leak side the illusion of the consensus of the vaccine

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:58.400
workside the illusion of the consensus that what something is wrong

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:06.800
you see the idea is to confuse you into thinking that there is something to figure out

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:14.800
and the only thing to figure out is is that we we have to united united non compliance that's

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.760
how we get out it's not just some things it's all the things

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:29.200
it's all the things it's all the things it's controlled by the algorithm

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.040
and there isn't a lot we can do about that algorithm and the algorithm works in much more

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.480
diabolical ways than most people want to imagine

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.880
because the algorithm works in such a way

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:56.640
that the algorithm works in such a way that there's not only can views be inflated

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.840
so that people who aren't being watched look like they're being watched

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:12.480
but people whose videos are attempted to be shared can be censored and what is the word

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:19.600
now they're using all the time I don't know throttled and all of this goes on

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:25.760
but it's impossible for us to know how far our videos are getting out how far our reach is

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.160
even if we know what our follower count is we don't know

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:36.160
and we don't know how many rooms of people are full of people doing stuff to try and throw

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.800
more nonsense on the fire like he used to tonic house music

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:48.480
like I don't know scooby doo videos that have nothing to do with me from followers that I've

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:52.880
they're people that are not following me are now making scooby doo videos about the unmasking

01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:02.160
of berry can and fauci so we have a lot of work to do to try and explain to everybody how

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:08.160
the who declared a dangerous novel virus that was detectable by a non-specific PCR test

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.800
we have a lot of explaining to do for people to understand that what you see in this graph here

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:22.480
is not what everybody thinks it is that this is mostly a testing artifact and that this

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:28.240
extra death that's up here visible in the all-cause mortality rate is extra death that is caused by

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.480
protocols by not resuscitating people by not giving them the proper treatment for secondary

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:42.240
pneumonia etc etc etc etc and then it is the damage caused by the shot whatever that damage is

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.560
there could have been an infectious clone that's very likely an infectious clone has been used to

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:53.440
see more than one sequence around the world I don't know it's a crime let's figure it out

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.960
but there's no question that they've had a plan to invert our rights to permissions for a very

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:05.840
long time and it's an international global thing that's the reason why the five ice

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:12.960
countries were so on board why the EU countries were so that lady from Germany who was the head of

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:24.400
the EU was so on point because this is the last chance they have to invert this and take all of

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.800
our data because they're selling it just like they're selling that idea that they get the data

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:34.080
for the brain then they'll be able to read your mind they have been selling this idea that if

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:42.720
they could get the genetic data Craig Venter, Venter, Joshua Lederberg all these guys have been

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.240
saying it for so long that this is the way we're going to crack the code

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.160
and so now you have to understand that in America and around the world there's this

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.720
biology and then there's also all the money that can be made from the biology all the control that

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.280
can be created through the biology and all of the intellectual property on which that biology is

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:11.280
enforced and it's that shift in the intellectual property space that Mark Koolack of usutonic

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.080
live recently identified that we are really getting all of our ducks in a row now

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:25.280
to see if we can really start to in broad strokes try to characterize the kinds of waves of change

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.480
that are happening in the background and the kinds of waves of change which actually may be

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:38.160
influencing the behavior of the people on the playing board and why somebody like David Martin

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:44.320
for example would be talking all kinds and nonsense about certain patents without teaching

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:49.520
you about a whole other aspect of patent law and biological patent law in particular with

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:56.080
regard to antibodies and so it's going to take a while yet it's going to take a while to sort

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:02.800
all this out but we're going to do it and in the meantime I'll be at Giga on biological which is a

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:12.960
let me see which is a kind of a Twitter substitute soapbox thing I get those support asks off of

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:18.640
there quickly you can see that giga ohm dot bio there oops there I was right here giga ohm

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.120
dot bio you could also go to giga ohm biological dot com and then find the soapbox link at the

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:29.360
top and that will get you there as well um I'm pretty busy with my day job now so I'm not posting

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.720
there a lot I'm also not posting on Twitter very often but that's how it is instead I'm trying

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:42.160
to focus on being here every single night as often as possible and I do believe that this is

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.640
night number 20 in a row and so as the streak gets longer it's going to be harder and harder

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:54.080
and more painful to break so hopefully that will keep me on thank you very much for joining me

01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:01.760
this has been giga ohm biological high resistance low noise information where you're proud to

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:08.480
be a biologist inter muscular injection is not a means of immunization you want to say it a

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:16.960
little simpler you can say the transfection transfection is not immunization stop all

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.400
transfections and humans because they are trying to get rid of the control group

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:30.720
shout out to my friend uh Emily Kaplan and uh and and and and and Greg Glassman of uh

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:38.240
broken science we haven't watched a video broken science yet so we're gonna get that on the

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.680
study hall this really soon um follow them they've been putting out a lot of really great short

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.520
content um if some might help you communicate some of these ideas to your family as well

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:56.160
um and don't forget that this video still I think is one of the best ways to share my work

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:00.880
with people who don't know me at all um and if you haven't seen it please watch it and share it

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.000
I'm pretty proud of the way I was able to explain the immune system with a little picture

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.520
so if you haven't seen the part where I'm drawing and talking at broad strokes about the immune

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.720
system and how it works I really highly suggest it thanks very much guys and I'll see you again tomorrow

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.440
hundred viewers at the end thanks guys thanks a lot
