WEBVTT

00:00.356 --> 00:00.927
Buzzer.

00:26.209 --> 00:26.710
Test 1, 2.

00:27.090 --> 00:27.590
Test 1, 2.

00:27.851 --> 00:31.174
Ladies and gentlemen, Giga Home Biologicals brought to you by a biologist.

00:31.554 --> 00:44.166
You can find out what I did as a tenure-chasing academic by putting my last name C-O-U-E-Y and the two letters J-J into the library of medicine.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.226
and you can find the stain of my work there.

00:47.246 --> 00:55.848
I suggest, if anything, you start there in case you have any skepticism about who you're listening to and what I might have to say in the next couple hours.

00:56.488 --> 00:57.348
Good morning, everyone.

00:57.388 --> 00:58.029
Good to see you.

00:58.749 --> 00:59.649
And welcome to the show.

01:31.222 --> 01:32.723
You never get used to the pressure.

01:35.844 --> 01:37.144
You just learn to embrace it.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.327
Expectations aren't a burden.

01:44.088 --> 01:44.788
They're a privilege.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.092
Because it could be worse.

01:51.056 --> 01:52.599
No one could expect anything at all.

05:41.093 --> 05:41.274
you

07:28.587 --> 07:29.507
Good morning.

07:29.627 --> 07:31.048
Good morning, everyone.

07:31.128 --> 07:34.709
It's almost afternoon, actually, which is kind of cheating for me.

07:34.809 --> 07:36.870
But welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:36.910 --> 07:38.311
Thank you very much for joining me.

07:38.331 --> 07:42.753
I'm coming to you live from my garage at 1156 on the 16th of December.

07:47.512 --> 08:10.124
2024 it's not to say that I'm that's that's kind of bums me out sometimes when I think about it how far we are but then again if I think about how far we've come and about how close we are maybe to taking advantage of a situation that they had to create in order to take advantage of it themselves and I'm going to try and explain that as often as I can over the next

08:11.201 --> 08:19.953
as often as I can until my kids take over or until something permanent changes or our direction changes.

08:20.554 --> 08:25.480
I think one of the ways out is to start thinking of a new way of teaching biology to our kids, a new way of

08:26.361 --> 08:41.108
of teaching our kids to see the world and especially the life around them so that they can separate this mythology from the sacred biology and the irreducible complexity that they should be focused on if they are biologists.

08:41.389 --> 08:45.571
And I think that's one of the things I want to dedicate a lot of time to in the coming year.

08:46.491 --> 08:48.412
Healthy people don't get sick, ladies and gentlemen.

08:48.452 --> 08:49.493
I think that's the best

08:50.433 --> 09:11.791
overarching truth to start talking about with your family and friends and about how clean water and clean food, a clean environment with clean air, exercising regularly and being surrounded by the love of family and friends is something that all of us have been lacking a lot of, some of us more than others, but certainly

09:13.191 --> 09:15.072
We have not been optimizing these things.

09:15.732 --> 09:25.598
Instead, we've been tricked into begging the government to optimize other things for us or to protect us from other things like bad food and bad water and other stuff.

09:26.913 --> 09:29.315
We've got to really pull our heads out, I think, ladies and gentlemen.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.816
That's what this brief is all about.

09:32.076 --> 09:39.381
It's really about pulling our heads out and trying to really get our, you know, take our responsibility for our lives again.

09:39.421 --> 09:44.284
I think I saw something on the internet a few days ago that made a lot of sense to me.

09:44.324 --> 09:54.170
The more responsibility you take for yourself and your future and your safety and your well-being and your success, the more likely it is that everything is going to be all right.

09:55.090 --> 10:06.676
And the more you look outside of you for something to blame, or look outside of you for help, or look outside of you for some kind of assistance, the more likely it is that you're not going to make it.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.997
So you've got to take control of the knobs that you can reach.

10:10.217 --> 10:11.518
You've got to keep your arms straight.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.460
And you've got to keep pushing forward, even if it's only a few inches every day.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.281
I think that's what we're going to try and do here.

10:18.341 --> 10:19.802
That's the plan going forward.

10:20.982 --> 10:30.386
We are, of course, under a new spell now, and a lot of people are under a new spell, but I would just like to very succinctly explain why this might be a new spell.

10:31.346 --> 10:32.367
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:32.387 --> 10:34.347
doesn't need to get confirmed.

10:36.188 --> 10:37.769
None of these people need to get confirmed.

10:38.609 --> 10:44.271
Right now, we're spending an inordinate amount of energy discussing the potential consequences for, oh boy, here we go.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.812
What are you doing in here?

10:48.593 --> 10:49.633
Who let you down here?

10:50.848 --> 10:51.729
Come on, get over here.

10:51.749 --> 10:55.391
If you're going to interrupt, then you better get over here.

10:55.412 --> 11:03.478
All right, well, he'll probably find the bone under there, and then he'll be quiet for a minute.

11:03.498 --> 11:05.179
I don't know what he's doing.

11:05.981 --> 11:07.662
But we are under a different spell now.

11:08.483 --> 11:22.774
This spell of Donald Trump and all the people that he might potentially appoint is still very, very much a spell that could disappear or change in any number of ways, including very simply that

11:24.938 --> 11:32.203
in front of the Senate with the objection of a few key senators under a few key conditions, these people might not be confirmed.

11:32.243 --> 11:42.790
And within a week, we could be facing an entirely new set of nominees drawn from a more typical, you know, a more typical, how do I say it?

11:43.350 --> 11:52.536
Big pharma, big corporate, big whatever, deep state kind of list of people so that they get through the nomination, because we don't want to have the same thing happen again.

11:52.576 --> 11:54.698
And we're never going to get this administration rolling.

11:55.478 --> 11:57.080
So that's really the problem we have.

11:58.261 --> 12:05.046
That's really the problem we have right now is coming to the realization that we could still be under the spell of a theater.

12:06.046 --> 12:10.049
Maybe even Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:10.169 --> 12:15.694
are under the spell of a theater being cast by J.P.

12:15.774 --> 12:16.894
or J.D.

12:16.934 --> 12:21.598
Vance and Elon Musk and Bannon and Tulsi for all I know.

12:22.674 --> 12:35.085
Maybe Tulsi's under a spell, but all I'm saying is that we are under their collective spell because what they're doing is perpetuating a mythology about how we are governed and who governs us.

12:36.226 --> 12:39.189
And it is not that mythology.

12:40.350 --> 12:48.317
I just don't know how many times we can address this or how often we're gonna have to address it, but we cannot pass this kind of,

12:49.538 --> 12:50.099
There it is.

12:50.560 --> 13:07.821
We cannot pass this kind of governance onto our children, where elaborate theaters are enacted on social media, where elaborate hoaxes are enacted on social media, and then the populace is governed by these things.

13:08.564 --> 13:21.098
We cannot allow this to continue and we definitely cannot allow it to continue about fundamental ideas, fundamental concepts about who we are as sovereign individuals and who we are as a species.

13:24.062 --> 13:25.483
So, yeah, that's what this is all about.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.307
I think that's why we need to keep using this.

13:29.631 --> 13:47.568
this um screen this meddler medley thing where we we really whoops where we really uh think very carefully about this big kind of hand behind us that's really our telephone and our acquiescence to social media on our telephones and on our computers uh

13:48.396 --> 13:50.417
They never dreamed that it would be like this.

13:50.477 --> 13:53.839
Cable TV was the first iteration of this.

13:53.879 --> 13:59.143
And then the idea was to throw a bunch of channels at you that basically had nothing on them.

13:59.863 --> 14:07.027
And so then it was much more likely that you wouldn't find the truth on that landscape.

14:08.028 --> 14:12.010
But at the same time as that happened, it also became

14:15.017 --> 14:22.121
it became no longer imperative from a legal perspective to tell the truth on television.

14:23.722 --> 14:33.408
And that change occurred during my lifetime, during when I was kind of a young man, and that's a very significant change that we are now 20 years past.

14:34.889 --> 14:43.895
And now we have telephones, and our kids have telephones, and our kids' telephones tell them very different things about the world than our telephones tell us about the world.

14:44.878 --> 14:47.940
And that's one of the most terrifying things to come to realize.

14:49.681 --> 14:58.887
You might think it's innocuous that your teenager only looks at garbage on their phone, but that's terrible, actually, because it's very short attention span garbage.

15:00.849 --> 15:02.010
You probably shouldn't have that thing.

15:07.393 --> 15:09.515
Short attention span garbage, it's not

15:11.764 --> 15:15.327
intellectual shorts, if you will, it's not educational shorts.

15:15.947 --> 15:22.793
And so that's the first layer of this that we don't want to pass on to our kids that it's easy to find the truth.

15:22.873 --> 15:24.154
All you have to do is scroll.

15:24.594 --> 15:26.776
We don't want our kids to grow up like that.

15:26.816 --> 15:27.937
It's easy to find the truth.

15:27.997 --> 15:29.098
All you have to do is Google.

15:29.498 --> 15:32.220
We don't want our kids to grow up thinking it's that easy.

15:33.601 --> 15:38.345
We want our kids to understand Wikipedia the way that Mark Kulak understands Wikipedia.

15:40.406 --> 15:40.707
And so

15:42.205 --> 15:47.086
I think that today I'm gonna spend a little time trying to dissect this list that I threw up the other day.

15:47.106 --> 15:53.908
I think it's an important list that could be again sharpened by somebody who wanted to sharpen it.

15:55.848 --> 16:01.469
But yeah, I think we have to really come to terms with where we are so that we understand it.

16:02.029 --> 16:02.930
Is there somebody there?

16:02.950 --> 16:08.491
Oh boy, now I might have to track him down.

16:08.531 --> 16:09.111
We'll see a bit.

16:09.741 --> 16:18.466
Because I think really right now, not only are we right about this, which is that there is only one chance in history to collect the data that's available right now.

16:18.526 --> 16:28.212
And what I mean by that, I haven't said it in a while, but what I mean by that is, is that the population of the world, let's say just for round numbers, it's 10 billion people.

16:29.093 --> 16:40.338
the 10 billion people on this planet, by all projections, biological ones, by the Club of Rome, by the pessimists, and by the optimists, is going to collapse.

16:40.398 --> 16:45.501
It's going to collapse because the population pyramids of a lot of these countries are misshapen.

16:45.521 --> 16:48.722
They're not in a pyramid, but they have this bump at the top.

16:49.103 --> 16:52.824
And once these people disappear, you have a pyramid that's much smaller.

16:53.164 --> 16:54.945
And that's going to happen in a lot of places.

16:54.985 --> 16:55.926
Hold on one second.

16:56.386 --> 16:58.287
Just let me check where this little munchkin is.

17:00.888 --> 17:01.728
Mike, where are you?

17:08.190 --> 17:08.630
Michael.

17:11.571 --> 17:12.231
What are you doing?

17:12.591 --> 17:13.691
Come in here with that thing.

17:25.954 --> 17:26.174
Come.

17:27.075 --> 17:27.635
Come in here.

17:28.395 --> 17:28.535
Yeah.

17:29.665 --> 17:31.966
You're going to get in trouble in the garage.

17:32.366 --> 17:32.706
There you go.

17:32.726 --> 17:37.768
I don't want you in there because I don't know what's on the floor.

17:38.568 --> 17:39.548
But you can play in here.

17:39.568 --> 17:42.029
Just don't pull on any wires.

17:43.670 --> 17:47.991
So that also means, of course, that it's the one time that they have to collect this data.

17:48.031 --> 17:59.015
It's the one time on the downslope, on the downslope of this population curve where we have the growth of the population over time, and then it's going to decrease.

17:59.555 --> 18:00.816
I guess how would I do that on here?

18:00.856 --> 18:03.479
I would guess I have to go this way, this way, what is it?

18:03.519 --> 18:04.059
That way, yeah.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.101
So it's going to decrease in the future.

18:06.662 --> 18:13.187
That concept then also could have been seen coming forward.

18:13.267 --> 18:19.093
So the same reason why the population pyramid is the obvious reason why they knew the pandemic was coming

18:19.773 --> 18:31.558
the population pyramid is also a reason why they know this is the last time they could ever collect this many examples of the human genome and store them away.

18:32.218 --> 18:40.221
It's the last time they can collect this many samples, this many genome sequences, this many representative samples.

18:40.281 --> 18:44.863
I don't know what they're doing or how they're collecting it, but I know that the

18:47.304 --> 19:12.328
The reality is, is that no matter whose numbers you look at, if you wanted to collect as many genomes as possible, like Craig Ventner, and Mark Lander, and Kevin McKernan, and Claire Craig, and all of these other people who believe in the idea that with enough genomes, and enough AI, and enough computing power, a lot of big problems can be solved, these people understand that this resource is limited.

19:14.520 --> 19:36.464
Just like the people who who told us the false history of world war ii understand that this resource was limited If you were going to have a bunch of people and exterminate them, you wouldn't just exterminate them That would be like saying okay, uh, i've got a bunch of uh, I don't know what would be the right uh,

19:37.861 --> 19:39.802
What would be the right way to do it?

19:39.862 --> 19:40.142
I don't know.

19:40.162 --> 19:45.325
I've got a bunch of fireworks and the way that I'm gonna get rid of them is I'm gonna grind them all up and then put them in the water.

19:45.345 --> 19:47.787
I mean, that's kind of a waste.

19:48.847 --> 19:59.434
When you had an opportunity to have a big show or to impress a bunch of people or do whatever, have a party, you decided to grind them all up and make mud and then bury it?

20:01.035 --> 20:03.176
And the idea that they had all these people

20:04.363 --> 20:09.805
and they just put them in work camps and then they gassed them and buried them or gassed them and then burned them.

20:09.945 --> 20:14.707
It's just absurd, especially that what do you need IBM punch card system for that?

20:16.428 --> 20:21.590
And so the same kind of resource that was lied about in the history of World War II

20:23.732 --> 20:31.895
And the same kind of data collection that was lied about in World War II is the shift that they want to make for our children.

20:31.935 --> 20:36.156
They want a seamless shift in our children's generation.

20:36.216 --> 20:39.077
Get down, hey, get down.

20:40.938 --> 20:47.720
They want a seamless shift in our generations, our kids' generation to a acceptance.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.101
You can't go outside that door.

20:49.921 --> 20:51.001
The acceptance that,

20:53.325 --> 21:02.930
Yeah, that they're experimental animals, that their data is not theirs, that they owe it to society to turn it all in, that their de-identified data is already enough a lot of times.

21:03.931 --> 21:10.795
And that's also what you need to realize from the perspective of the pandemic and remnants is that they've been collecting data.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.696
They've been getting this in order.

21:13.836 --> 21:18.319
Every collection, every test, hey, knock it off.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come over here and talk to me like that.

21:23.379 --> 21:24.881
Come over here and talk to me like that.

21:24.961 --> 21:28.524
You can't bite my jackets and stuff and you're not going outside in the backyard.

21:29.385 --> 21:30.646
Because you'll tear it all up.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.370
You gotta call Kira and have Kira come down again.

21:36.032 --> 21:36.833
Start barking at him.

21:38.174 --> 21:44.059
And so that's why I think really it's our only chance to save our children from this enslavement.

21:44.199 --> 21:49.104
This is only our one chance to point out what's going on, to teach our kids to see through it.

21:49.544 --> 21:56.330
And if we teach them the biology correctly, then I don't think any reiteration of this theater will work on them.

21:57.170 --> 22:05.855
I think there will always be children on earth that understand that this theater doesn't work if we are successful in passing this biology on to our kids.

22:05.915 --> 22:10.778
The real understanding of who we are and who we aren't and what is sacred.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.611
And so that's my goal.

22:14.671 --> 22:16.053
Here we are in 2024.

22:16.374 --> 22:18.917
I don't know if I need to explain this again, but I will.

22:19.798 --> 22:27.547
This is my general way of showing the timeline that we've experienced where here is supposedly somewhere in 2019 where the lab leak occurred.

22:27.928 --> 22:31.232
And then we had a pandemic that changed colors as it went around the earth.

22:34.119 --> 22:42.929
And yeah, here we are in 2024 where Byron Bridle is talking with Jessica Rose and Sabine Hazan because Sabine Hazan loves to talk shit.

22:43.610 --> 22:48.415
And Jessica Rose is Epigirl from the original exercise.

22:48.896 --> 22:53.000
And Sean Buckley is a happy collaborator of theirs who was

22:53.741 --> 23:14.089
somehow or another able to usurp the original NCI in Canada and now take it over and no longer wants to hear from people like me, but has a very, very interesting interest in hearing from all the same people that have toured around in the international COVID summits and are being toured around by those people now.

23:14.550 --> 23:19.952
And of course, they need these three people to be on with Dr. Byron Bridle to make sure he stays right on rails

23:20.912 --> 23:24.753
here with the self-replicating RNA vaccine narrative.

23:25.213 --> 23:32.736
We wouldn't want him to say anything off-script because that's the whole reason why these people surrounded him in the first place.

23:32.756 --> 23:33.896
He went off-script.

23:35.317 --> 23:43.219
So just a reminder, just to put everything in frame, I don't know if you're aware, but NPR at one time complained about Dr. Lee Merritt

23:44.260 --> 23:50.406
because she was able to renew her license with a mouse click apparently, and she also shares COVID misinformation.

23:50.766 --> 23:56.231
That's very different than not telling people about Dr. Lee Merritt in 2021.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.933
Nobody did a story about the pit

24:00.235 --> 24:02.818
medical professor who lost his job in 2020.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.624
Nobody did a story about me, but they did stories about her.

24:06.684 --> 24:07.905
They did stories about Brett.

24:07.925 --> 24:10.569
They did stories about Robert Malone.

24:10.609 --> 24:12.131
They did stories about Pierre Kory.

24:12.171 --> 24:16.056
And I think once you see it for what it is, excuse me.

24:16.076 --> 24:16.977
Okay.

24:19.180 --> 24:23.703
Once you see it for what it is, I mean, it's hard to build a timeline because it gets so messy.

24:23.744 --> 24:26.806
If you just look at two months, one month, hello, buddy.

24:27.447 --> 24:37.415
One month at the end of October in 2021, and one month in the end of, here.

24:37.755 --> 24:41.658
Come up here, come up here.

24:42.699 --> 24:44.661
For a second, say hi to everybody.

24:45.555 --> 24:46.735
Hello, this is Big Mike.

24:46.815 --> 24:47.735
See how big he's getting?

24:47.775 --> 24:49.256
It's hard to even lift him up anymore.

24:49.796 --> 24:50.556
He's gigantic.

24:50.916 --> 24:54.777
We should look back at the last videos so you can see how big he is already.

24:55.277 --> 24:55.797
He's a beast.

24:56.837 --> 24:59.277
He's gonna be Big Mike very shortly, unfortunately.

25:00.778 --> 25:13.280
So yeah, in 2021, if you look at this screen over here, in 2021 is actually the first time that Robert Malone was on the Jimmy Dore show.

25:13.860 --> 25:24.563
And in 2021, in late 2021, he was also on stage with Urso and Cole and some lady by the name of Li Min Yan, which is very curious.

25:24.623 --> 25:27.063
I didn't realize that, that wasn't in my timeline.

25:27.563 --> 25:36.045
But as I start fishing around and trying to record and catalog all these videos, I'm just always stunned at how much is there.

25:36.085 --> 25:37.846
And these are all taken from YouTube.

25:37.886 --> 25:38.806
If you just search

25:39.466 --> 25:47.815
Robert Malone on YouTube and go down the list of videos, order them from the earliest to the latest, he'll actually be quite surprised how many videos are there.

25:49.617 --> 25:51.519
The Jimmy Dore show is taken from Rumble.

25:51.559 --> 25:56.645
Everything else is directly from YouTube, including that video with him and Lee Min Yan, which is interesting, isn't it?

25:57.654 --> 25:58.454
It's quite interesting.

25:58.494 --> 26:00.655
That's from September, 2021.

26:01.495 --> 26:03.736
I'm tempted to watch it, but I'm not gonna watch it today.

26:03.776 --> 26:12.638
And then here on the other side, of course, you can also see, you can also see some other videos here from just the beginning of 2022.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.379
Suddenly he's on Fox.

26:15.419 --> 26:17.080
He's on this UK thing.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.020
He got banned from Twitter.

26:19.820 --> 26:22.101
He does a Tommy podcast.

26:22.121 --> 26:22.781
Do you wanna go out?

26:23.861 --> 26:24.602
And the,

26:26.102 --> 26:32.727
VPZD show talks in episode 10 about Robert Malone on Rogan.

26:32.807 --> 26:38.371
So it's not really the censorship that they complain about.

26:38.391 --> 26:39.852
It doesn't really seem to be.

26:40.012 --> 26:41.013
Okay, I'll take you upstairs.

26:41.673 --> 26:42.434
I'll take you upstairs.

26:42.534 --> 26:42.754
Come on.

26:47.057 --> 26:47.518
He's ready.

26:52.121 --> 26:52.942
No, but he's been good.

26:53.922 --> 26:54.843
Don't carry him like that.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.611
Just push that door shut with your butt if you don't mind.

27:05.712 --> 27:06.592
So it's closed tight.

27:09.593 --> 27:17.996
And so there's quite a crop of videos to download and I think you should endeavor to do so simply for your own exercise

27:20.066 --> 27:23.530
to try and double check my work because this is extraordinary to me.

27:24.111 --> 27:28.116
There's no level of evidence of what I've done anywhere.

27:30.259 --> 27:31.961
And there could have never been done.

27:32.021 --> 27:34.144
I would have lost my JC on a bike channel.

27:34.184 --> 27:37.187
I already had two strikes a lot of times during the pandemic.

27:38.127 --> 27:45.712
Um, as has, as, uh, somebody like Mark Kulak, he's operating with a couple of different channels on one or two strikes all the time.

27:45.772 --> 27:56.138
And so it's extraordinary to me how many of these videos, I mean, look at the top one there, the top one, he is on Fox news debating Alex Berenson.

27:57.216 --> 28:04.620
Alex Berenson is this super clown, of course, if you recall, who got banned from Twitter and was actually allowed to sue them.

28:04.660 --> 28:08.441
And it was a whole public charade where he ended up getting a lot of money.

28:08.481 --> 28:10.662
And then he went even further with truth-telling.

28:11.623 --> 28:16.085
Here he is on the Engram Report or the Engram Minute or the Engram whatever it's called.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.666
I mean, talking to Farage?

28:18.806 --> 28:19.226
Really?

28:19.246 --> 28:20.667
In the beginning of 2022?

28:24.192 --> 28:28.254
And it's all because of his appearance on Rogan or supposedly that's what's happening.

28:28.274 --> 28:34.998
But if you look back now and see it in retrospect, what you need to see is this is all scripted, scheduled.

28:35.838 --> 28:36.899
This is how you do it.

28:39.383 --> 28:47.870
And I think it's very important for you to see the earliest examples of these things that aren't so easy to find, that everybody is very quick to ignore.

28:48.471 --> 28:53.355
But these are the examples where people are still not so fluid at performing their shtick.

28:54.096 --> 28:59.260
They're still not fluid in what they're supposed to say and how to say it.

28:59.361 --> 29:05.446
And also the little mini hamster wheels of words that get people right back to where they want them to be.

29:06.493 --> 29:08.634
And they haven't figured all those words out yet.

29:08.694 --> 29:11.775
All those word combinations that make people's eyes go crossed.

29:12.275 --> 29:13.715
They haven't figured them all out yet.

29:13.735 --> 29:15.236
So they're still trying to figure them out.

29:15.276 --> 29:18.637
And at that time, of course, Li Min Yan would still be involved.

29:18.677 --> 29:22.178
At that time, Ryan Cole could still be totally fooled.

29:23.277 --> 29:30.981
and thinking that they really do want him along because he's a guy who knows about natural immunity and it's really awesome that he's along because he knows about natural immunity.

29:31.481 --> 29:33.483
But sooner or later he's going to figure it out.

29:34.263 --> 29:40.246
He has to have figured it out by now because I've talked to him too many times, I've gotten too many little notes from him.

29:41.167 --> 29:44.328
He knows, he's listened, he's heard what I've had to say.

29:44.348 --> 29:47.090
There's no doubt in my mind all of them have.

29:50.703 --> 30:07.101
just like I think a lot of them have seen a lot of Mark Kulak's work and that's why his numbers are so low because it's as easy as tippity-tap-tap-tappity-tap and Mark or I or anybody else would have no idea whether 5,000 people saw our video or 500.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.957
And it might be that 5,000 is the threshold we need to hit.

30:12.977 --> 30:20.964
5,000 is the threshold that they're holding us at because they know if they don't hold us there, we would have already gone all around the world by now.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.748
And I think that's the reality that we live in.

30:26.673 --> 30:28.995
It's nothing as spontaneous on the internet.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.217
And that's not to say anything about me being a victim.

30:32.277 --> 30:35.639
It's to say that the entire thing is fake.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.401
There are no spontaneous risers.

30:38.461 --> 30:42.624
Everybody rises past a line of permission, yes or no.

30:42.784 --> 30:43.845
Should we let this one go?

30:43.865 --> 30:44.885
That sounds pretty good.

30:44.906 --> 30:45.926
Should we call them first?

30:47.007 --> 30:49.369
That's it, without a doubt.

30:50.202 --> 30:52.204
These are private domains.

30:52.304 --> 30:56.109
These are private places that are used to govern us.

30:56.209 --> 31:02.937
Therefore, by definition, you don't even get to see people coming out of the curtain until you're at the first level.

31:02.977 --> 31:06.361
Then you get to go behind the curtain and find out there are lots more curtains.

31:09.758 --> 31:16.500
And the internet is the very first curtain when you realize, you get behind that one and you realize, wow, you mean really all of it's fake?

31:16.560 --> 31:27.222
Oh yes, all of it, not some of it, all of it is selected carefully and populated carefully, mostly with people that they control.

31:28.903 --> 31:29.743
That's the trick.

31:31.704 --> 31:35.805
It's the trick that somebody as old as, what is that guy's name?

31:35.845 --> 31:36.845
The dude that wrote the,

31:37.765 --> 31:39.967
the 33rd degree Mason that wrote that book.

31:40.888 --> 31:43.710
Albert Pike even said it, we'll give them the heroes they need.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.911
That's literally what's happening here.

31:47.893 --> 31:49.534
Actually is what I wanted to say there.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.615
I apologize for that.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.556
And so we could go on and on.

31:52.596 --> 32:01.023
We could add dates from 2022 and go on and on and show how everyone from the World Health Organization or the World Council for Health

32:03.846 --> 32:05.347
Stop lying.

32:05.627 --> 32:12.750
To Teresa Carrizio, she's got a bunch of videos that are on YouTube still about Robert Malone.

32:12.850 --> 32:13.851
They're not censored.

32:13.871 --> 32:14.611
They're not gone.

32:14.651 --> 32:15.371
They're still there.

32:15.391 --> 32:20.514
I mean, the lady from New Zealand did a special on him.

32:20.914 --> 32:24.375
The dude with the fro did a special on him.

32:24.395 --> 32:25.376
They all covered him.

32:25.616 --> 32:26.697
He was on Hannity.

32:28.497 --> 32:31.919
He was on ABC News in California.

32:35.097 --> 32:37.139
This is not a man who is censored.

32:37.179 --> 32:43.585
This is a man who has been put in front of you just like in a real life Scooby-Doo mystery.

32:44.586 --> 32:45.827
But we're not all in a van.

32:46.908 --> 32:48.030
We're all on our phones.

32:51.153 --> 32:51.833
That's the trick.

32:53.034 --> 32:59.581
We're not riding around in a van, but it sure seems like it because we're all looking at our phones and we all see the same thing when we look out the window.

33:02.361 --> 33:07.742
So spontaneously, 2021 on Jimmy Dore.

33:07.762 --> 33:21.106
Some of the questions that I want you to ask yourself or hold in your mind while I play the beginning of this video is, does this sound like Jimmy Dore is happy to have this guy on his show?

33:22.086 --> 33:27.908
Does it sound like this is Jimmy Dore spontaneously interviewing somebody?

33:31.718 --> 33:35.620
Does it sound like somebody who's trying to come to save the world with the truth?

33:40.503 --> 33:43.645
And what words do they use in 2021?

33:46.347 --> 33:52.851
Listen carefully, because it's very, very important for this point to be made, I think.

33:56.943 --> 34:01.905
We are pleased to have with us renowned inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology.

34:02.765 --> 34:09.087
As a researcher at the Salk Institute, he pioneered in vitro RNA transfection technology.

34:09.528 --> 34:15.510
He subsequently pioneered many new innovations in the fields of RNA vaccination and immunization.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.030
We welcome his expertise.

34:17.390 --> 34:18.751
He is Dr. Robert Malone.

34:19.111 --> 34:20.151
Thank you for being on the show.

34:21.352 --> 34:24.353
Thanks for the opportunity, Jimmy, and I look forward to

34:25.197 --> 34:27.579
to sharing ideas with you.

34:27.980 --> 34:29.381
Jimmy does not look comfortable.

34:31.282 --> 34:38.609
Jimmy just read word for word what he was told to say, and this is a transfection technology expert, in case you didn't hear it.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.952
In case you didn't hear it, I'll play it again.

34:41.972 --> 34:47.617
A technology, a transfection technology expert with your audience.

34:48.678 --> 34:48.878
So

34:51.089 --> 34:56.050
We are pleased to have with us renowned inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology.

34:56.910 --> 35:03.232
As a researcher at the Salk Institute, he pioneered in vitro RNA transfection technology.

35:03.672 --> 35:09.654
He subsequently pioneered many new innovations in the fields of RNA vaccination and immunization.

35:09.694 --> 35:11.174
We welcome his expertise.

35:11.534 --> 35:12.894
He is Dr. Robert Malone.

35:13.255 --> 35:14.315
Thank you for being on the show.

35:15.495 --> 35:18.516
Thanks for the opportunity, Jimmy, and I look forward to

35:19.344 --> 35:22.806
to sharing ideas with you and with your audience.

35:23.866 --> 35:31.810
So you seem to be the leading guy on mRNA vaccines.

35:32.431 --> 35:39.514
Could you explain to our audience what an mRNA vaccine is and how they protect against infectious diseases?

35:40.355 --> 35:40.775
Wow.

35:45.879 --> 35:46.859
I mean, wow.

35:46.979 --> 35:54.561
Can you explain to our audience what an mRNA vaccine is and how they protect us from infectious diseases?

35:57.142 --> 35:58.743
It's a transfection technology.

36:02.764 --> 36:09.786
So that's a question that can carry us forward for the next two hours, or I can try to oversimplify everything.

36:09.846 --> 36:12.546
And so please forgive me, because that's what I'm going to do.

36:12.566 --> 36:13.026
OK.

36:13.126 --> 36:14.987
Or we'll be able to talk about anything else.

36:16.804 --> 36:26.246
So I don't mean to in any way talk down to anyone, and if there's any molecular virologists in the audience, I apologize in advance.

36:26.927 --> 36:44.091
The core idea here and insight is that methods developed for gene therapy purposes, for correcting genetic errors, defects,

36:45.177 --> 36:48.860
can also be applied to generating immune response.

36:49.181 --> 36:50.021
So there he said it.

36:50.622 --> 37:08.097
The goal here is, the whole reason why he's out there, that I made the argument a few days ago and other people have made the argument before me, is to protect intellectual property, to create intellectual property space where there is none, because these are all transfection technologies.

37:08.137 --> 37:08.718
And so unless

37:09.398 --> 37:20.293
They can make the illusion, create the illusion that there is sufficient novelty in the technologies that are being unleashed, the technologies that are being rolled out just in time.

37:21.194 --> 37:25.420
And he's saying that the technology to correct genetic defects,

37:29.144 --> 37:37.510
And I think what he's implying there is somehow correcting the genome of people, which I don't think any of us are talking about doing here.

37:38.150 --> 37:40.532
It's not what they tried to do with Jesse Gelsinger.

37:41.552 --> 37:46.736
And so again, I find this to be an incredibly disingenuous representation of what's going on.

37:47.887 --> 38:13.448
It is a maximizing of the illusion that this is part of a suite of incoming, yet-to-be-developed genetic technologies, when in reality, it is the latest iteration of what is essentially lipofectomy, with a commercially impure, by definition, RNA,

38:14.997 --> 38:19.759
put into it by some proprietary manufacturing method.

38:19.799 --> 38:22.240
And it is the manufacturing method, actually.

38:22.340 --> 38:29.764
And that's why, again, Peter Cullis and the stuff that they did, as he said in the video the other day, he could never imagine being so efficient.

38:30.124 --> 38:33.305
That's why it's also important for him to have said that in 2020 and 2021.

38:36.243 --> 38:46.568
Because the whole point is, is that these technologies and in the way that they are manifesting now, is sufficiently different from the stuff that he did, that it deserves new patents.

38:49.290 --> 39:01.977
And so there's a fine line, of course, between arguing that, well, what they're doing is what I'm doing, and not interfering with their new declaration of intellectual property.

39:02.017 --> 39:04.438
The giving of the Nobel Prize is also part of that.

39:05.646 --> 39:12.191
to define the chemically altered mRNA as a new technology, a cutting edge new technology.

39:12.231 --> 39:19.116
And therefore, in an intellectual property case, in a patent, you would write that, you would declare that.

39:22.098 --> 39:33.267
And so I think that one of the things that you can see going on here and makes a lot of sense also from the perspective of someone clown like Steve Kirsch being involved, that this is really about intellectual property.

39:34.568 --> 39:36.189
It's about perceived value.

39:36.269 --> 39:38.609
It's about potential going forward.

39:39.309 --> 39:51.233
And they know already that there is a full-blown push to convert to this technology and to substitute what they already knew a long time ago was dumb because intramuscular injection of stuff is dumb.

39:52.814 --> 39:59.996
But now they want to replace it with something that they're more interested in understanding, more interested in trying to optimize, and that would be, of course, transfection.

40:02.366 --> 40:15.343
but if they don't roll it out as this novel new thing with all these fancy new bells and whistles that makes it much more safe, if they don't declare it more safe with somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., most of us won't listen.

40:17.418 --> 40:31.897
But imagine the disaster that we could have in America if the end result of the Trump administration after a year is that Bobby Kennedy has spent $10 billion studying and realizing that the mRNA vaccines are contaminated.

40:31.917 --> 40:35.542
And if they weren't contaminated with SV40, they would be pretty safe.

40:37.128 --> 40:43.651
And so let's keep vaccinating the old people for shingles and for RSV and for pneumonia until they're all gone.

40:43.691 --> 40:49.934
And we have managed the population pyramid problem and at the same time gotten rid of all the people that might understand what we're doing.

40:55.017 --> 40:58.938
And that would make sense why this guy is playing along in the way that he plays along.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.920
He's allowed to lie and say whatever he wants in every video he's in.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.381
He's not part of the military.

41:08.462 --> 41:10.143
He's not under government contract.

41:10.183 --> 41:12.404
He's not endangering anything.

41:13.304 --> 41:22.128
That's why he can say whatever the hell he wants for the highest bidder and probably organized a whole team of clowns to say whatever was needed for the highest bidder.

41:22.969 --> 41:31.512
And those clowns are associated with Teal and Musk and Rogan and Alex Jones and the Weinstein brothers.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.673
They're all one team.

41:37.406 --> 41:46.412
And if for no other reason than Mark Kulak and Jonathan Cooley exist, Brett Weinstein can't have a lot of these people on his show or won't have a lot of these people on his show.

41:47.053 --> 41:55.719
And that's what makes it so hilarious that he had Jessica Rose on his show and spent the first half hour or 45 minutes talking about the existence of a molecule.

42:01.283 --> 42:03.765
Let's keep listening, because this gets, it's just hilarious.

42:03.845 --> 42:05.846
Remember, this is under duress in my mind.

42:08.244 --> 42:09.904
Jimmy has been faking his laughs.

42:10.145 --> 42:26.473
I mean, it's... So, mRNA vaccines employ a molecule called RNA, which is, in most cases, derived from DNA.

42:27.713 --> 42:33.076
In the case of the virus itself, SARS-CoV-2, that's an RNA virus.

42:34.249 --> 42:36.512
And so here we go again, what is he doing here?

42:36.572 --> 42:50.587
This is the, obviously everybody knows that, you know, cakes are made of flour and bakers make cakes and everybody knows that we put gas in our cars and everybody knows that this, that's exactly what he's doing here.

42:51.488 --> 42:53.771
That's how it carries its genetic information.

42:54.750 --> 42:58.793
It can be done either way with DNA or with RNA in different viruses.

42:59.053 --> 43:00.614
So that's a pretty bold statement.

43:00.694 --> 43:03.956
And I keep and I will keep saying it over and over again.

43:04.016 --> 43:16.983
It is a very bold statement to say that genetic information can be carried either way by double-stranded DNA or single-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA or positive single-stranded or negative single-stranded.

43:17.004 --> 43:17.564
And they mean no.

43:20.339 --> 43:28.502
No way in hell can we let these people get away with these gross exaggerations of understanding and the fidelity of them.

43:28.562 --> 43:37.865
The idea that all of these different ways of transmitting genetic information are possible and they all are part of this evolution because DNA.

43:37.905 --> 43:38.705
There's no way.

43:41.326 --> 43:45.828
The whole excitement of DNA is its ability to proofread when it's being copied.

43:46.028 --> 43:48.469
RNA in a single-stranded form doesn't have that.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.141
And there's lots of evidence, lots of evidence for it.

43:55.042 --> 44:12.990
And it cannot be overlooked that their declaration of what happened here does not compute that somewhere in 2019 from a mud puddle, a very well-designed, fortuitously or on purpose, a very well-designed RNA started spreading.

44:13.070 --> 44:19.513
And here we are now with its descendants in almost all corners of the globe, including the white-tailed deer of North America.

44:22.113 --> 44:25.635
This is just a biological impossibility.

44:28.296 --> 44:39.582
And we have to come to terms with this idea that the only way that any of this molecular biology information could be real is if there is a background signal upon which this narrative has been built.

44:42.524 --> 44:50.428
It's much more likely that than it is that all these tests are just lame, just fake, just overcycled, because those

44:52.947 --> 44:59.630
Narratives are not sufficient to explain the global acceptance of the illusion.

45:00.390 --> 45:10.274
But what would be, what would be is a pre-existing signal that first tested in 2002.

45:11.154 --> 45:22.118
A pure signal on that background was released and they tried to follow that pure signal and they followed it through roughly 700 people back to Canada.

45:23.868 --> 45:24.729
Was that a theater?

45:25.089 --> 45:26.710
Was that a real tracking event?

45:26.870 --> 45:27.511
I'm not sure.

45:28.692 --> 45:41.662
But either way, I assure you that it established the same biological potential, which is that a signal detected somewhere in a remote place or in an urban area of China could be transmitted to the world.

45:42.623 --> 45:51.390
The only question is whether or not we really test deployed something there, and we really did track something, and there was something to track, and then we lost it.

45:54.252 --> 46:08.222
or whether there's a background signal and that background signal is being studied and characterized by people like, I don't know, by Meadow Biota and Peter Daszak.

46:09.723 --> 46:13.685
And once that background signal is characterized, we can roll out tests for it.

46:14.866 --> 46:17.448
And surprise, surprise, the Toyotas are spreading everywhere.

46:21.823 --> 46:26.267
Be careful because this guy is just basically out there saying for sure there's a novel virus.

46:26.327 --> 46:31.953
It's just really a question of when it came and how dangerous it is and how much we're really screwing up.

46:33.514 --> 46:34.836
But there's for sure a virus.

46:35.616 --> 46:41.482
And we can detect it using PCR because Kevin McKernan tells us we can do it, because Claire Craig tells us we can do it.

46:41.882 --> 46:46.447
And those guys were collecting genomes and doing PCR before the pandemic, so we should trust them.

46:48.553 --> 46:52.316
but for this virus, it uses RNA.

46:54.318 --> 46:57.801
People are confused about the M part of the RNA.

46:59.682 --> 47:01.504
That's nothing to be afraid of.

47:01.724 --> 47:03.746
There are different types of RNA.

47:03.986 --> 47:16.176
See, that's also, I really want you to see every individual part, because even saying that people are confused about the M in mRNA is already saying to you,

47:17.560 --> 47:28.829
a very good point to discuss, a very good question, a contentious point, a lot of people think is an illusion of consensus.

47:30.151 --> 47:31.111
Who's a lot of people?

47:31.171 --> 47:33.393
This guy's spending his whole time on a horse farm.

47:33.433 --> 47:34.394
Who's a lot of people?

47:34.814 --> 47:35.875
Is he getting emails?

47:38.017 --> 47:43.662
Maybe he should have said, I get a lot of emails asking me the question on what the M in mRNA means.

47:45.779 --> 48:00.323
This is just another trick to make you think you understand what he's talking about, to get you on the rails, to mystify you, to bamboozle you into thinking that he is the wizard of disambiguation.

48:02.947 --> 48:04.388
but he is absolutely not.

48:04.428 --> 48:21.034
That's the same reason why this guy is writing a book published by CHD with the dog Cerberus on the front, claiming to be explaining how psychological operations are run on you, except for one thing he's omitting, is that he's part of it.

48:23.635 --> 48:24.696
And that's the magic of it.

48:26.016 --> 48:28.397
I would never lie to you, is what they all say.

48:30.138 --> 48:32.639
I would never lie to you, but that's what they all say.

48:39.277 --> 48:39.898
in cells.

48:42.059 --> 48:53.545
Some RNAs are used as scaffolding, as structure, for the little tiny biorobots inside of all of our cells called ribosomes.

48:53.865 --> 48:55.165
Oops, another admission.

48:55.206 --> 48:59.068
So here he is saying that the ribosome is a mini biorobot.

48:59.188 --> 49:05.171
And Mark Kulak is one of the few people I've ever heard put forward the idea that it's all about the ribosome.

49:05.990 --> 49:16.614
I've never heard a tenure track professor tell me that, you know, the biggest question in biology is how ribosomes work because that's where the rubber meets the road as far as genetic code and building materials.

49:18.474 --> 49:26.297
Only Mark Kulak has said that, pointed out different people over the course of history that have said it on camera or on recording.

49:27.455 --> 49:34.060
pointed out the awarding of Nobel prizes and pointing out the lectures that these people give and what they say in those lectures.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.001
That's Mark Kulak.

49:35.041 --> 49:39.804
It's not Jessica Rose or the Midwestern doctor.

49:41.786 --> 49:45.789
And Mark Kulak's not getting invited onto CHD to talk about that stuff either.

49:46.729 --> 49:48.451
Even though in my mind, it's pretty important.

49:48.571 --> 49:51.473
Even though in Robert Malone's mind, it seems to be pretty important.

49:56.789 --> 49:58.250
that manufacture proteins.

49:59.892 --> 50:03.174
So that's one kind of RNA, ribosomal RNA.

50:04.335 --> 50:20.269
mRNA, the M stands for message, is the type of RNA that's used to carry information from the center part of your cell, the nucleus, where the DNA lives, out to those little protein manufacturing

50:21.475 --> 50:45.571
Bio robots that are out in the cytoplasm the outer part of your cell that actually make the proteins So don't be intimidated The mRNA is just designating that it's one particular type of RNA It's a message that goes to these little protein manufacturing facilities called ribosomes and causes them to make a

50:46.149 --> 51:07.161
the protein from the virus called spike in this case and it's a slightly modified version of spike it was designed to make that protein that's produced a little easier for your b cells to recognize to make antibodies now there's a lot of

51:07.910 --> 51:18.873
information, data suggesting that actually that wasn't the... Is this a useful public announcement on a comedy show?

51:18.933 --> 51:20.113
What's going on here?

51:21.734 --> 51:28.096
Of course what you see here is an attempt to sharpen what was pretty dull.

51:29.491 --> 51:46.452
a few months before this on the Brett Weinstein podcast, was pretty dull a few months before this on the Joe Rogan podcast, and is still pretty dull now in 2021 because they still haven't figured out quite how to catch all of their opportunities.

51:46.672 --> 51:47.774
Jill and Malone

51:48.314 --> 51:51.155
and Robert are trying to catch all of their opportunities.

51:51.195 --> 52:01.840
They want to be, at the same time, the inventor of this world-saving technology and part of that wonderful story and the wonderful biology that's there.

52:02.300 --> 52:08.903
But they also want to be a part of the movement that is warning people that it's not ready for the big show yet.

52:11.484 --> 52:13.665
That's what this is, in my humble opinion.

52:14.875 --> 52:17.016
And that's why it was so ham-fisted then.

52:17.096 --> 52:21.777
And when, in retrospect, when we look back on it, it is so ham-fisted because these are meddlers.

52:21.877 --> 52:25.618
I don't know what piles of money are paying them to do it.

52:25.718 --> 52:30.299
I don't know what potential people they're looking at paying them to do this.

52:30.380 --> 52:36.961
Maybe they were just doing this under the pretense that somebody would eventually pick them up, that maybe somebody would pay them, but I doubt it.

52:37.882 --> 52:38.762
I doubt it very much.

52:41.004 --> 52:45.968
I'm very suspicious of his continued appearances on Tommy's podcast.

52:46.028 --> 52:47.269
It just doesn't make any sense.

52:47.850 --> 52:52.374
I'm very, very curious of him being early on Alison Morrow.

52:52.934 --> 52:58.519
I'm very curious about him being with Paul Cottrell and associates several times.

52:58.639 --> 53:03.063
It's not, it doesn't make any sense unless you start to put all these people together.

53:05.265 --> 53:28.736
And because as we move through the narrative from 2021, we move through the history of what happened that's still available on the internet, you can see that all of these meddlers that have come through my life, some of them even come to my house, have all crossed paths with Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and Nick Hudson and Jiki, because it's all one big show.

53:33.584 --> 53:37.946
And Jimmy Dore looks like he's caught up in it because this is not Jimmy's normal show.

53:38.026 --> 53:39.627
It's not Jimmy's interview.

53:40.207 --> 53:44.570
This is here, Jimmy, you read this, and then we'll just let Robert talk.

53:44.610 --> 53:46.771
And then if you have any questions, you can ask him, I guess.

53:46.811 --> 53:48.912
But here's some more questions in case you need anything.

53:51.473 --> 53:59.037
Necessary, that modification, but it was believed to have been necessary back when they engineered the vaccine.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.179
The spike protein that's produced

54:03.997 --> 54:08.845
is largely the same as the spike protein produced from the virus.

54:10.387 --> 54:16.236
And we do know that the spike produced from the virus has certain types of toxicities.

54:18.584 --> 54:21.426
The people that did... So we do know that, you see.

54:21.506 --> 54:29.433
So we've already talked about this several times, but the narrative that was seeded in 2020 was that the spike in particular is what we needed to focus on.

54:30.073 --> 54:43.124
Kevin McCairn and Dr. Fleming and lots of other people were telling us that the spike protein could generate amyloid, that the spike protein could cause clotting, that the spike protein was also a prion.

54:44.730 --> 54:51.496
or a pre-onogenic or something like this because they modeled it or because they grew it in culture or I don't know what.

54:52.657 --> 54:59.582
And this stuff also tied in very well with mitochondrial damage, which a lot of people said the spike was damaging mitochondria.

54:59.682 --> 55:04.406
It couldn't be the lipid nanoparticle and transfection damaging mitochondria.

55:04.526 --> 55:06.288
It is the spike protein doing it.

55:07.712 --> 55:14.614
And that was even somebody like Walter Chestnut, who was saying that mitochondria is being damaged.

55:14.634 --> 55:15.554
It's an aging thing.

55:15.594 --> 55:17.494
It's something like radiation poisoning.

55:18.335 --> 55:20.155
And it couldn't be the lipid nanoparticle.

55:20.255 --> 55:25.236
It couldn't be transfection and the aberrant reaction of the body to it.

55:26.877 --> 55:29.017
But it was, of course, the spike protein.

55:31.298 --> 55:32.138
And I am

55:33.095 --> 55:39.377
Without a doubt, sure, at this stage, I mean, how could we be wrong about this, that these people did this on purpose?

55:39.397 --> 55:40.717
It was a coordinated effort.

55:41.197 --> 55:42.617
Jessica Rose was in on it.

55:44.258 --> 55:49.999
Spike protein sub-stacks, spike protein sub-stacks, promoting other people's spike protein sub-stacks.

55:50.039 --> 55:54.240
And when I was on the spike protein chase, everybody was fine with me.

55:57.661 --> 55:59.902
And you can see that this narrative was seeded by him.

56:03.081 --> 56:15.531
not that dissimilar from how the narrative of there being a CIA agent by the name of Michael Callahan in Wuhan was actually seeded by Robert Malone and Whitney Webb, not by Callahan.

56:20.054 --> 56:31.703
Whitney Webb, the one that we met at the CHD conference in Knoxville, and after her presentation, Robert Malone came out and said, wow, what a firecracker, that Whitney Webb.

56:35.000 --> 56:43.331
So kudos to Mark Kulak for tying some of those loose ends up and making it really obvious what to see here.

56:43.451 --> 56:47.977
We're not aware of those toxicities and problems at the time they did it.

56:49.605 --> 56:53.586
So yes, they- And so now he's saying, and I can just stop at every sentence.

56:53.646 --> 57:01.029
Now he's saying that we wouldn't want to blame Pfizer or Moderna because they didn't know at the time that the spike protein was so toxic.

57:01.049 --> 57:07.951
So we can't really blame them for having chosen it as an antigen because this was a typical antigen chosen before.

57:08.452 --> 57:10.692
And so all they did was try to rush out something.

57:10.732 --> 57:18.395
And how could they know it would be an amyloidogenic, pre-antigenic, time-traveling spike protein with spinning razors on it?

57:21.940 --> 57:29.903
I mean, remember, we watched a video, the TED Talk of that lady from Moderna saying that in 45 minutes they had their vaccine and everybody clapped.

57:31.204 --> 57:41.688
Did make some modifications to the spike protein when they engineered it for putting it into these genetic vaccines, but they weren't designed specifically to make it more.

57:41.848 --> 57:44.409
And he says genetic vaccines, not on accident.

57:44.429 --> 57:46.830
He's reading a script just to the right of him.

57:47.850 --> 57:49.191
It's not on accident.

57:49.211 --> 57:51.312
He's repeating these words on purpose.

57:52.759 --> 57:58.543
because he is trying to create and maintain and curate the idea of how novel these things are.

57:59.083 --> 58:01.565
How little we understand because they're so novel.

58:02.145 --> 58:09.209
But thank goodness Peter Cullis has done something so incredible with the efficiencies of these carriers.

58:12.151 --> 58:12.632
For safe.

58:13.152 --> 58:16.894
They were designed to make it more immunogenic, a better immunogen.

58:18.915 --> 58:21.217
Now the, um, uh,

58:21.855 --> 58:30.457
important thing to understand about all this, I think for all of us, is there are no perfect vaccines, just like there are no perfect drugs.

58:32.281 --> 58:38.163
just like if I, with my table saw or a drill or anything else.

58:38.423 --> 58:42.744
So understand that I would have done a spit take had I not seen this already, but I've seen it already.

58:43.344 --> 58:45.585
So I already knew he was gonna say that, but can you believe it?

58:46.565 --> 58:47.906
There are no good vaccines.

58:47.966 --> 58:48.646
I wonder why.

58:48.726 --> 58:53.928
Is it because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances and calling that medicine is kind of dumb?

58:58.509 --> 59:01.950
I think you have to see the reality here.

59:03.325 --> 59:12.354
The subtle reality is that we are being governed by these people and the illusions of a limited spectrum of debate that they create.

59:12.414 --> 59:16.077
When in reality, we just need tested vaccines.

59:17.578 --> 59:19.560
We just need proven vaccines.

59:20.161 --> 59:22.043
We need safer vaccines.

59:23.735 --> 59:36.727
And so the narrative is coming over the next five years or 10 years or however long it takes for our kids to believe that for their children, vaccines are safe and that transfection is that safe methodology.

59:37.208 --> 59:38.008
That is coming.

59:38.069 --> 59:39.069
That is the goal.

59:39.830 --> 01:00:02.994
make no mistake about it that is the goal the childhood vaccine schedule in america will not end it will be replaced by safe vaccines that donald trump and robert f kennedy jr may very well put their seal approval on by the end of those four years i mean that is you gotta be frightened by that are you not frightened by that because i am

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:10.867
Especially being where I am right now, where I think actually you can say it very succinctly, intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:17.313
Calling intramuscular injection of a combination of substances medicine is crazy.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:25.761
I think there is a real possibility that generations in the future will look back and think, wow, they used to make needles.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:34.377
in convenient sterilized packaging so that they could inject things intramuscularly and call it medicine.

01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:36.918
They did that for three generations.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:37.698
Can you believe it?

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:47.362
Just in the same way they're gonna look back and think, wow, I can't believe that we let our children be enslaved by social media.

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.991
and it's all part of the same show.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:59.453
These people are all playing for them because they have been shown behind the first curtain.

01:00:59.914 --> 01:01:01.895
They know that the internet is an illusion.

01:01:01.935 --> 01:01:04.136
That's why they're free to go on it and lie.

01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:08.978
Because they know it's an illusion, so they don't feel bad about it.

01:01:09.018 --> 01:01:10.959
They realize that it's a theater.

01:01:11.879 --> 01:01:19.623
You think it's on your phone and that it's a spontaneous thing that, you know, it's free speech on your phone here, free speech.

01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:29.029
And they have been taken behind the curtain and shown that there's no free speech on X. This is how we make it work.

01:01:31.831 --> 01:01:41.317
And then they turn around and they say, hey, hey, Roy, give Robert Malone 10,000 followers and make a couple of his tweets go viral.

01:01:41.717 --> 01:01:42.538
Do it quick, would you?

01:01:43.018 --> 01:01:46.080
And then he does, you know, some little thing over here and he reaches over and

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:52.152
Robert Malone gets a message on his phone and it says, wow, you've gone viral.

01:01:53.372 --> 01:01:54.373
It's that easy.

01:01:54.813 --> 01:02:11.981
And once these people are shown that, once these people are shown that Substack is a money laundering scheme, or Locals is a money laundering scheme, and we can essentially pay you with fake accounts, or we can essentially pay you with dummy accounts that are all subscribers that we just create, because there's no auditing this.

01:02:12.581 --> 01:02:13.922
We own Stripe too.

01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:15.883
We own PayPal.

01:02:15.923 --> 01:02:16.543
We do it all.

01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:21.298
The money laundering possibilities are endless.

01:02:23.079 --> 01:02:42.587
And if you get shown behind the curtain, offered comfort and a little fame, and the confidence to know that you're part of a team of people that have all been behind the scenes, that know exactly or kind of what you know is going on, then you will happily participate in it.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:49.534
And you will happily, happily promote those people who are participating in it with you.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:57.240
And that's why they don't promote people like Mark and people like myself and people like Joe Marshall when they find us.

01:03:02.604 --> 01:03:04.145
That's why it happens this way.

01:03:04.925 --> 01:03:12.911
And once we start to see it and can adequately show it to our kids, this whole illusion can be dispelled and people will start to require

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:19.808
a record of integrity that they're going to have to build before anybody will take them seriously.

01:03:20.328 --> 01:03:23.130
And these people that don't have that will be exposed.

01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:40.561
They will be exposed as part of this twisted symphony of people that are pretending to be part of a spontaneous exercise, when in reality it is a well-rehearsed motorcycle stunt inside of a well-rehearsed sequence of events.

01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:47.830
a well-gamed out, scripted, you know, and if they agree on it, then they can alter it however they want to.

01:03:49.291 --> 01:04:06.040
It's just that right now they're on very thin ice because we have pushed them so far off their planned narrative, so far off of their illusion of consensus and having to scramble for new ground and scramble for new people off of the bench.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.781
Because Robert Malone is the weak link.

01:04:09.821 --> 01:04:11.782
Sasha Latapova is another weak link.

01:04:11.842 --> 01:04:13.863
Brett Weinstein is a huge weak link.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:16.325
His brother is a huge weak link.

01:04:16.965 --> 01:04:19.706
Even Joe Rogan becomes a huge weak link.

01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:25.109
And of course, Peter Thiel is a huge weak link.

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:33.873
Once you start to see where he's gone and what he's said and how he says it, it's starting to become very obvious that the illusion might be broken.

01:04:36.937 --> 01:04:52.571
Wouldn't it be crazy if Donald Trump came forward and said, you know, I've got to apologize to the American people because I got fooled into thinking that it was a good idea to fake an assassination attempt in order to make sure that I got elected.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.681
That's not going to happen, of course.

01:04:56.721 --> 01:04:58.982
But if it did happen, it would be pretty big calamity, right?

01:04:59.002 --> 01:05:01.403
It would be a pretty big collapse of American society.

01:05:01.423 --> 01:05:08.886
It would bring about a lot of big disasters there, just like, you know, what would happen if Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:14.649
decided that we needed to get rid of assault rifles and have background checks and do other things that other people don't want.

01:05:14.689 --> 01:05:17.770
How much of a mind loss, mind meld would that be?

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:23.878
just like again, as I've said before, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:23.938 --> 01:05:28.681
pronouncing the new generation of mRNA vaccine safe and effective.

01:05:30.022 --> 01:05:30.822
RFK Jr.

01:05:31.202 --> 01:05:43.590
has, as Pamela, I'm sure would like me to say over and over again, might do all kinds of great things for getting rid of seed oils and over-processed food or better labeling or something like that, but he's not gonna touch GMOs.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.232
He's not gonna talk about GMO insects.

01:05:46.292 --> 01:05:48.033
He's not talking about GMO plants.

01:05:48.513 --> 01:05:51.114
He's not talking about those products with GMO in them.

01:05:53.035 --> 01:05:56.037
And I don't hear Cali means talking about that stuff either.

01:05:56.057 --> 01:05:58.558
I don't hear a lot of these people talking about that stuff.

01:05:58.598 --> 01:06:09.264
And if you say the old vaccine schedule is bad, and you say that the new vaccines were contaminated, you are right on dead on balls narrative for where these people want you to be.

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:17.609
And you can see it if you inspect all the uncensored stuff that they said in these years preceding where we are now.

01:06:18.456 --> 01:06:25.799
If I use it wrong, inappropriately, without caution, I can cut off my finger or do damage.

01:06:26.599 --> 01:06:31.601
Likewise, drugs and vaccines have to be used intelligently and cautiously.

01:06:33.602 --> 01:06:45.147
Now, the important thing to understand about all this, I think for all of us, is there are no perfect vaccines, just like there are no perfect drugs.

01:06:46.994 --> 01:07:00.946
Just like if I, with my table saw or a drill or anything else, if I use it wrong, inappropriately, without caution, I can cut off my finger or do damage.

01:07:01.287 --> 01:07:02.148
And so what is it?

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:02.948
Vaccines?

01:07:03.128 --> 01:07:03.449
No.

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.511
Make no mistake about it.

01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:11.176
Gigaohm Biological's message is that intramuscular injection is what we need to say.

01:07:12.273 --> 01:07:22.797
Vaccines is an amorphous idea that does not provoke a specific and high fidelity concept in anybody's mind.

01:07:23.397 --> 01:07:24.557
And that's why they use it.

01:07:25.037 --> 01:07:26.538
They use it that way on purpose.

01:07:26.638 --> 01:07:35.261
They want pandemic to mean all kinds of very elaborate and crazy, scary, colorful things, mostly red.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.832
But I mean, vaccines, they want to mean almost anything.

01:07:39.872 --> 01:07:46.556
It could be any combination of substances injected to help your immune system learn something could be a vaccine.

01:07:48.036 --> 01:07:54.740
And new vaccines are descended from this technology where we tried to fix genetic defects, which doesn't even make any sense.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.082
Again, that's not what they tried to do with Jesse Gelsinger.

01:07:59.122 --> 01:08:00.903
They tried to replace a missing enzyme.

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:01.583
That's different.

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:20.145
But this imprecise language is actually very precise because it's now and over the last five years has created this illusion that something novel, something new and improved, although rushed, has been unleashed on the world.

01:08:20.185 --> 01:08:20.945
And that's a lie.

01:08:22.386 --> 01:08:27.348
Likewise, drugs and vaccines have to be used intelligently and cautiously.

01:08:28.445 --> 01:08:34.510
And we have to understand the risks so that we can avoid them when it makes sense.

01:08:35.651 --> 01:08:45.278
And so there's much discussion and consternation about the fact that we don't fully understand the risks of these experimental products.

01:08:46.699 --> 01:08:48.541
And I think that there's merit to that.

01:08:49.382 --> 01:08:54.526
But like with everything in life, there's risks when we get into an airplane.

01:08:55.266 --> 01:08:57.428
There's risks when we get into our cars.

01:08:58.704 --> 01:09:04.487
And we, all of us, have learned to deal with those risks.

01:09:06.328 --> 01:09:22.416
What we think about, what we do, is we say, oh, when I get into my car and I need to go to the shopping center, is it a good idea to travel 65 in a 35-mile-an-hour zone?

01:09:22.456 --> 01:09:23.577
No, probably not.

01:09:23.597 --> 01:09:25.398
There's a good chance you're going to get car wreck.

01:09:26.735 --> 01:09:34.597
So we all the time make decisions about what we do and how we do it based on an understanding of risks.

01:09:35.497 --> 01:09:38.797
The same is true with medicines and the same is true for physicians.

01:09:39.798 --> 01:09:51.600
What's important for us to understand is because we're going to take risks, we need to understand those risks and we need to have

01:09:52.287 --> 01:10:00.311
the information necessary for us to make an informed decision about whether or not we wish to take those risks.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:20.761
And that's kind of the core of my position here is let's use the vaccines intelligently and let's make sure that we really understand the risks and that you and your audience understand the risks because it's your body and you have the right to accept or reject

01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:24.059
a medical treatment.

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.301
I believe that is a fundamental right.

01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:31.043
That is spectacularly lame.

01:10:32.304 --> 01:10:39.267
I mean, that is, this is the core of my message.

01:10:40.628 --> 01:10:45.511
Did anybody, was there a college kid in the United States that was saved by that message?

01:10:47.386 --> 01:10:51.828
Was there a grandmother in the United States that was saved by that message?

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:57.331
Was Jimmy Dore saved by that message?

01:11:00.652 --> 01:11:01.553
It's weird, right?

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:10.517
We're supposed to believe something very different happened in 2021 than what actually happened.

01:11:10.597 --> 01:11:14.499
And the really weird part is, is that the truth is still available on YouTube.

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:29.506
You can still go back and find videos of Robert Malone and Paul Cottrell on YouTube talking about people, laughing about people being killed because they were given dexamethasone and sent back to L folks homes where they died.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:32.989
Because dexamethasone is like a hammer for the immune system.

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:37.634
You can see him on podcasts with a January 6th fugitive.

01:11:38.271 --> 01:11:49.353
You can see him on podcasts with people who are associated with George Webb, the guy who was featured on 60 Minutes in February, 2020, talking about the lab leak.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:55.595
And on that 60 Minutes program, they didn't also say Mark Kulak's name.

01:11:55.995 --> 01:11:57.655
They didn't show Mark Kulak's face.

01:11:58.295 --> 01:11:59.395
They showed George Webb.

01:12:03.496 --> 01:12:04.637
They didn't show my face.

01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:06.757
They showed George Webb.

01:12:07.984 --> 01:12:15.472
And Robert Malone hasn't shared a video from me, except for with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:16.193 --> 01:12:19.056
and Senator Ron Johnson, according to them.

01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:27.165
They say that Robert Malone shared a video of me interviewing Rixey in January of 2022, which is really curious.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:38.713
because Robert Malone doesn't know who I am, and even when I shook his hand at the Knoxville CHD conference, he pulled it away in disgust and said he didn't know who I was.

01:12:41.595 --> 01:12:47.418
Even though this is the actual thing that happened to me, my wife was there when I got the phone calls.

01:12:47.478 --> 01:12:48.619
It happened on the same day.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.183
Robert Malone told them to watch my show, but Robert Malone doesn't know who I am.

01:12:56.784 --> 01:12:58.825
Robert Malone was on Jimmy Dore's show.

01:12:59.736 --> 01:13:17.259
introduced as a transfection technology expert i don't think they had gotten their wording down yet you see that's how far off script they are that's how far off script they are

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:37.208
So as long as well, as long as you left it there, let me let me just go ahead and I'm going to jump ahead and just ask you, what are what are the bioethics of the current campaign to get the vaccine in everyone's arm?

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.772
So, again, he's reading a question that he was clearly given.

01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:43.693
What are the bioethics?

01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:47.055
Robert Malone, you are a bioethicist.

01:13:47.175 --> 01:13:48.396
What are the bioethics?

01:13:48.577 --> 01:13:49.757
I was a bioethicist.

01:13:49.837 --> 01:13:51.879
My bioethics advisor told me

01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:57.955
These are all things that he rolled out in the course of the three years after this.

01:13:58.676 --> 01:14:05.661
All kinds of stories about his high level of authority and also his high level of exhibition of bioethics.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:10.705
My goodness.

01:14:11.726 --> 01:14:16.450
You know, who else is a great bioethicist is the, is the wife of Tony Fauci.

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:21.114
She's a, she's a, like one of the biggest bioethics experts in the universe.

01:14:24.099 --> 01:14:29.766
Personally, I find this public position confusing.

01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:41.200
It's not consistent with my training and my understanding of the proper practice of medicine and the proper practice of regulatory oversight.

01:14:44.378 --> 01:14:52.540
These vaccines are known, the government acknowledges that there are risks associated with these vaccines.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.840
This was not the case six to nine months ago.

01:14:56.901 --> 01:15:11.563
So now they've taken the position, they acknowledge there are risks, and the risks that they formally acknowledge in the licensure package for the BioNTech product are incomplete.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:14.004
There are known

01:15:14.545 --> 01:15:16.887
in the literature, numerous other risks.

01:15:18.008 --> 01:15:25.795
And the FDA in that licensure package acknowledges that there are other risks that remain uncharacterized.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:33.602
Risks such as birth defects, the extent of which the cardiac risks manifest,

01:15:35.788 --> 01:15:36.249
etc.

01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:42.192
In addition, there are many other risks, such as reactivation of latent viruses.

01:15:42.832 --> 01:15:52.738
We know this as shingles, also Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and other viruses that can be triggered by vaccination.

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.552
may also be triggered by the infection.

01:15:55.632 --> 01:16:00.055
So there is a portfolio... May also be triggered by the infection.

01:16:00.115 --> 01:16:05.699
Again, very subtly, neurolinguistically programming you to assume that there is a new virus.

01:16:05.739 --> 01:16:07.681
The novel virus is definitely real.

01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:19.430
We all know... ...of risks, only some of which are understood to any significant degree.

01:16:20.274 --> 01:16:30.804
many of which are known to exist, but they're not well characterized yet, even after all these many months of dosing of these experimental products.

01:16:32.345 --> 01:16:38.671
In my opinion, based on both decades of practice

01:16:39.568 --> 01:16:42.111
And I don't think there's anything dangerous.

01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:51.361
In fact, it's a further admission if you think about it, if he keeps calling them experimental products instead of transfections, which is what he is a expert on.

01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:53.043
Right.

01:16:54.346 --> 01:17:03.810
Then he is, by definition, what he is doing is programming everybody to listening to this to differentiate these from old technologies.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:15.894
To say that these are experimental technologies is very similar and almost a synonym to saying these are new technologies, especially in Jimmy's ears and the ears of Jimmy's listeners.

01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:18.615
This is not imprecision.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:22.237
This is perfectly, precisely crafted language.

01:17:23.854 --> 01:17:37.382
to make sure that nobody ever, ever understands these technologies as being already well understood as inappropriate for healthy children, already understood to be inappropriate for pregnant women.

01:17:38.442 --> 01:17:44.526
which he's still in his, well, that's the general message of my, he still hasn't said anything like that.

01:17:44.946 --> 01:17:47.308
I don't know why my microphone is clipping out all the time.

01:17:47.348 --> 01:17:57.175
I have not changed the settings, but I've noticed recently, it might be that my coaching actually, I'm gonna tell a little anecdote here.

01:17:59.376 --> 01:18:01.838
So a little anecdote, how do I do that?

01:18:01.918 --> 01:18:03.579
This way, this way.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:14.214
My daughter takes lessons on piano and the piano teacher's husband is an opera singer.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:21.440
And I coached their kid with my kid last year in basketball when I was assistant.

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:26.564
So I kind of know the parents, but I don't know the father as well as I talked to the mom a few more times.

01:18:28.025 --> 01:18:35.531
And one random time at one of the gyms around here, I ran into the father because his son was there and we were there.

01:18:36.702 --> 01:18:41.345
And he was recently back from a trip where he was singing in some other country.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:48.409
And so I saw that he was there and I thought it was neat that he was at the basketball court sitting on the sideline.

01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:49.910
So I went over and talked to him for a minute.

01:18:50.891 --> 01:18:59.956
And I had recently had this thing happen in my throat where this blood thing burst and some big thing came out and then my voice came back.

01:19:00.476 --> 01:19:04.338
And so a couple months later, I saw him there and I said to him, you know,

01:19:06.547 --> 01:19:07.387
Give me some advice.

01:19:07.607 --> 01:19:08.427
You have a voice.

01:19:09.148 --> 01:19:10.968
This is how you make your living.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:13.469
And his voice is very loud.

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:16.109
It's powerful all the time when he talks.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:20.931
And so what do you do to take care of your voice?

01:19:20.951 --> 01:19:25.832
Do you have to be careful and not yell at your kids or not get too excited at a basketball game?

01:19:26.472 --> 01:19:29.673
And he sang in an opera voice back to me.

01:19:31.195 --> 01:19:35.376
You have to use your voice to keep your voice or something like that.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:36.497
It was very loud.

01:19:36.517 --> 01:19:37.637
It blew my hair back.

01:19:38.457 --> 01:19:45.959
And so maybe what's happening here is that I'm using my voice at basketball two or three nights a week and also at the games on the weekend.

01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:47.780
And now it's becoming stronger finally.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.040
And so that's starting to make a clip.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.120
That could be the thing.

01:19:52.081 --> 01:19:52.421
I don't know.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:55.622
Anyway, sorry if you feel like that was a complete waste of time.

01:19:55.662 --> 01:19:56.682
I just wanted to share that.

01:19:57.284 --> 01:19:57.624
with you.

01:19:58.584 --> 01:19:59.744
So let's keep listening here.

01:19:59.764 --> 01:20:02.905
I'm not going to listen to the whole thing, but he's saying so many interesting things.

01:20:02.945 --> 01:20:04.085
I want to let it go for a little bit.

01:20:04.105 --> 01:20:24.809
International consensus as embodied in the Nuremberg trials and the Helsinki Accord and the Belmont Report here in the United States and captured in the Code of Federal Regulations, that's to say federal case law.

01:20:25.758 --> 01:20:28.221
as what's commonly known as the common rule.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:33.506
And so here I really think that we're getting into very complicated nonsense.

01:20:33.546 --> 01:20:36.950
The idea is to create a very elaborate hamster wheel

01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:40.878
and make sure that there's no way for anybody to think their way out.

01:20:40.918 --> 01:20:42.759
He's never going to say strict scrutiny.

01:20:42.799 --> 01:20:50.362
We should hold the government to strict scrutiny if they're going to declare an emergency like this and avoid suspending these fundamental rights on a whim.

01:20:50.402 --> 01:20:52.363
He's never going to say anything like that.

01:20:52.784 --> 01:20:59.347
Instead, you can see he's maneuvering us already into thinking that it's a free speech thing, that it's a censorship thing, that it's a

01:20:59.807 --> 01:21:03.189
Control of information thing that we need to have all the information.

01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:08.231
They need to tell us the truth so that we can make a decision Why do we need to make a decision about something?

01:21:08.271 --> 01:21:25.059
We already knew would be bad for for for young healthy people We knew it would be bad for healthy people already before the pandemic no one would have ever suggested to transfect somebody before 2020 as a possible way to make them healthier and

01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:44.226
The only time it was ever suggested that transfection be used is in extreme cases of untreatable cancer or genetic diseases that are debilitating, where somebody feels as though or medically has no choice.

01:21:44.306 --> 01:21:46.388
That's when it was used before 2020.

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:54.254
And now we have the little disambiguation wizard gnome telling us that it's a very complicated thing.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:03.764
experimental technologies and complicated bioethics and principles established with the Belmont Report, yada, yada, yada.

01:22:07.445 --> 01:22:07.825
Where is it?

01:22:07.845 --> 01:22:15.449
The Belmont Report and then the Belfort Declaration is the other one that I keep getting mixed up with, but I think that has something to do with countries and stuff.

01:22:15.469 --> 01:22:22.873
There are well-established practices which must be followed for experimental products.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:24.393
And

01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:32.336
in general, need to be followed for all medical procedures, such as when you go and have a surgery.

01:22:34.277 --> 01:22:37.060
You look like you're about in the same age bracket.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.202
And so now keep in mind where he is.

01:22:39.282 --> 01:22:40.523
How far are we into this?

01:22:40.583 --> 01:22:44.186
He's going to be there for an hour and he's never going to succinctly say anything.

01:22:44.266 --> 01:22:52.854
He's never going to give the lay person like Jimmy Dore a leg up on this biology by telling him very succinctly what's going on.

01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:57.812
which was what I told him when I gave him a copy of the book with annotations.

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:09.437
That these people were coordinatedly lying to us and that he needed to call me so that we could talk in private about my experience and maybe he would believe it.

01:23:09.477 --> 01:23:10.718
But here's some notes.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.080
This is a Jimmy Dore under duress here.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:23.543
This is a guy who didn't want to have this guy on his show but had this guy on his show and has had him on his show a number of times.

01:23:24.631 --> 01:23:31.173
as part of the success he's been given, the comfort he's been provided.

01:23:32.253 --> 01:23:34.974
Don't ask any questions, don't look behind that curtain.

01:23:35.414 --> 01:23:43.116
We'll let you in to this side of the green curtain, but now that you know that all these other curtains are back here, you can't look behind any of them.

01:23:45.116 --> 01:23:47.977
That's the status that we're at with these people.

01:23:49.585 --> 01:23:51.747
They have been let behind the first curtain.

01:23:51.787 --> 01:23:55.650
They know that the internet and the algorithms are an illusion.

01:23:58.112 --> 01:24:01.014
And they have been allowed to rise within that system.

01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:09.901
They understand that they are not rising because they're super funny or funnier than anyone else.

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:12.123
And it's just a spontaneous, no, it's real.

01:24:13.387 --> 01:24:17.451
It's a real live set of keyboards that decides what's going on.

01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:18.952
A real live set of people.

01:24:19.493 --> 01:24:20.433
Flips the switches.

01:24:23.656 --> 01:24:28.561
And this was probably when he was introduced to the system, or allowed to be in it, or inducted.

01:24:32.825 --> 01:24:33.786
That's what I would suggest.

01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:49.924
And so of course, like I said, you can go into the future and you can just find countless examples of where he's been and what he said and try to isolate particular time points where he's saying the same thing over and over again that will be different from what he said here.

01:24:51.924 --> 01:25:00.348
Because again, the script is being modified as the populace requires.

01:25:00.408 --> 01:25:02.068
This is herding cats, you see.

01:25:02.108 --> 01:25:04.029
That's why all these people are into cats.

01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:10.012
because that's what this whole exercise is about, herding cats.

01:25:11.533 --> 01:25:22.557
And the more exceptional you become at bringing all kinds of people with different ideas and different questions together, the better you are at herding cats.

01:25:23.217 --> 01:25:33.821
And Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn and Robert Malone and Paul Cottrell, and if they could have, I would also be herding cats for them.

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:52.175
Standing at a podium saying that it was a lab leak is where I should be if I would have taken the the opportunity that was given to me But I didn't because I don't think this is about me or any of us it's about our kids and our kids kids I

01:25:53.444 --> 01:25:56.466
And so this is a battle that we can't acquiesce to.

01:25:56.787 --> 01:26:03.932
We cannot give up on, we can't go passively into this good night or whatever way right to say it, we can't do it.

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:22.667
We gotta keep up the resistance, we gotta keep up the pressure and we gotta keep documenting all this stuff, downloading all these things, filling hard drives with them and then duplicating those hard drives and sending them around so that people can see that there is a chronology here that doesn't compute unless you compute it as a theater.

01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:37.348
Carefully and meticulously orchestrated across five eyes countries across Western civilization English-speaking countries Including South Africa and India and that kind of stuff.

01:26:37.428 --> 01:26:49.534
All this was orchestrated Maybe everywhere where there's a significant big pharma footprint This was orchestrated from Israel to South Africa to India to America to Europe.

01:26:51.095 --> 01:26:51.475
I Don't know

01:26:52.961 --> 01:26:57.225
That's for somebody else to figure out once we accept that this is a crime of the highest order.

01:26:58.787 --> 01:27:04.633
An attempt to govern the world by social media mythology.

01:27:05.614 --> 01:27:10.079
A demonstration, perhaps, of the potential to govern the world by social media mythology.

01:27:11.311 --> 01:27:40.259
And I think it is very, very likely that the staged shooting of Donald Trump was nothing more than another example of that, where a lot of the same players, including Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and Goodman and Cullen and who knows how many others, probably George Webb and a lot of other of these podcasts talked about it for a week or two, about how many different shooters there were speculated about it.

01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:44.170
And what did that do?

01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:46.551
That accepted the monsters.

01:27:46.812 --> 01:27:50.833
When you try to solve the mystery that they give you, then you accept the monsters.

01:27:53.315 --> 01:27:56.156
And that's what the lab leak versus natural virus does.

01:27:56.216 --> 01:28:00.498
That's what the stolen election versus, I don't know, Russian interference does.

01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:08.822
That's what the January 6th thing does to us, is that you accept their narrative and then you accept their monsters.

01:28:10.823 --> 01:28:11.683
But it's all a theater.

01:28:14.139 --> 01:28:17.820
Even the objection to these things is the theater.

01:28:18.781 --> 01:28:22.402
That's the snapping out of the illusion that has to occur for our children.

01:28:23.563 --> 01:28:28.364
And once you see that in 2022, this actually aired, this was real news.

01:28:30.365 --> 01:28:34.847
Nobody ever did a story about Mark Kulak or Jonathan Cui on the ABC News 10.

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:51.924
This is Dr. Robert Malone in the late 1980s when he conducted what Nature magazine calls a landmark experiment in San Diego on the path to the COVID-19 vaccines.

01:28:52.465 --> 01:28:54.646
And this is Dr. Malone today.

01:28:54.887 --> 01:28:59.611
Regarding the genetic COVID vaccines, the science is settled.

01:29:00.879 --> 01:29:01.800
They're not working.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.103
Messages like that have... So this is Dr. Lynn Finn, I believe.

01:29:06.164 --> 01:29:08.666
This is Dr. Ryan Cole.

01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:10.047
This is Erso behind him.

01:29:10.087 --> 01:29:17.533
Remember, these three guys were on stage with Lee Min Yan about four months before this.

01:29:18.014 --> 01:29:18.914
This is videotape.

01:29:18.934 --> 01:29:23.018
That's Jill Glasspool Malone, his wife and often co-author.

01:29:23.058 --> 01:29:25.600
This is that guy, Caridy, I believe his name is.

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.181
And then that's...

01:29:26.801 --> 01:29:54.198
Actually Paul Alexander wearing exactly the same coat Exactly the same coat that he wore when he came to visit me last week in person with his wife and daughter And yeah, I'm gonna show that picture just to make sure you know what I'm saying Yet another person that you can add to the list of people That has come to visit

01:29:55.270 --> 01:30:08.899
Jonathan Cooey, yes, Paul Alexander was here, and yes, he's wearing exactly the same shirt, exactly the same shirt that he's wearing in this picture, or sorry, the same coat that he's wearing in this picture right here.

01:30:08.939 --> 01:30:12.301
So I don't think Paul Alexander is actually making that much money.

01:30:14.422 --> 01:30:20.386
I think Paul Alexander might be in the same position that I am, that he keeps being a little bit

01:30:21.798 --> 01:30:27.003
Frightened by the fact that so many people are actually not on the team that he thought they were on.

01:30:29.785 --> 01:30:35.931
I think he's also a little worried about what's going on with the Trump administration coming from the Trump administration previously.

01:30:35.971 --> 01:30:36.351
I don't know.

01:30:36.371 --> 01:30:39.093
I have a feeling that we're all worried about it.

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:39.914
What's going on?

01:30:40.855 --> 01:30:42.216
What is really happening here?

01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:42.636
Is this real?

01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:56.095
All I know is that Paul Alexander on his very imperfect substack has been one of the few people to promote me as having something to say.

01:30:58.937 --> 01:31:04.561
Mike Yeadon has kind of done it once or twice in a substack comment, but other than that, not at all.

01:31:05.582 --> 01:31:09.825
Nick Hudson has done it a couple times at the end of a podcast, but then really not at all.

01:31:10.205 --> 01:31:12.567
And the same with Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying.

01:31:12.587 --> 01:31:13.808
They've done it, but not really.

01:31:16.218 --> 01:31:18.739
Not to the extent to which it could have been done.

01:31:19.939 --> 01:31:26.122
Not promoting me, but promoting these ideas to get us to this finish line that we should have gotten to already five years ago.

01:31:26.202 --> 01:31:32.424
Before the pandemic, when the movie Vax 2 came out, we should have already had the momentum to get there, but for some reason we didn't.

01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:35.065
Not sure who dropped those balls.

01:31:36.633 --> 01:31:41.418
But we are many, many years past that and we are still dropping balls and fumbling things.

01:31:41.818 --> 01:31:49.586
And I think it's because we keep thinking that Lucy is going to hold the ball and be loyal and we're going to be able to take a good kick.

01:31:50.988 --> 01:31:51.909
But it's not happening.

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:55.633
And it's not happening because it's by design.

01:31:57.892 --> 01:31:59.233
These people were put in place.

01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:00.113
They are part of it.

01:32:00.494 --> 01:32:07.558
They've made the UCSD grad a star in the anti-vaccine community and gotten him banned from Twitter in the process.

01:32:07.958 --> 01:32:16.723
Nearly 300 doctors signed a letter saying Malone spreads predatory medical misinformation like this from the Joe Rogan podcast.

01:32:16.903 --> 01:32:20.345
Think twice about giving these jabs to your kids.

01:32:21.766 --> 01:32:26.649
Among other things, your girls are born with all the eggs they will ever have.

01:32:28.021 --> 01:32:33.505
and these lipids are going to the ovaries, and they appear to be affecting menstruation in some way.

01:32:33.625 --> 01:32:36.047
The CDC flatly rejects that.

01:32:36.387 --> 01:32:39.990
So where does Dr. Malone really fit in to vaccine history?

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:44.593
Yeah, I mean, his papers were landmark papers, and we shouldn't take that away from him.

01:32:44.894 --> 01:32:46.675
Ailey Dolgen is a science journalist

01:32:46.755 --> 01:32:48.597
We should really somebody should do the work.

01:32:48.637 --> 01:32:59.247
I guess i'll have to do it to put it in order Is was he on the jimmy door show as a warm-up to the rogan podcast because now this is in 2022 Getting on tv about the rogan podcast.

01:32:59.267 --> 01:33:09.336
So that's curious to me Maybe the jimmy door show was a first run or one of the first runs like the the brett weinstein show was two rights for nature but his

01:33:11.014 --> 01:33:16.218
uh, sowing doubt in, into the efficacy and the safety of the vaccines are also.

01:33:17.619 --> 01:33:20.321
It is quite frankly, remarkable to me.

01:33:21.022 --> 01:33:24.805
I've still been, you know, trying to figure out who everybody is.

01:33:24.905 --> 01:33:29.308
And quite frankly, I operate on, you know, how I operate that everybody is not to be trusted.

01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:33.992
And Paul has said he was going to come and visit me a few times.

01:33:34.032 --> 01:33:40.577
He was thinking about coming during the Brownstone, but then didn't come coming for the open giga meeting, but didn't come, but

01:33:41.284 --> 01:33:45.826
The fact of the matter is, is that he showed up at my house with that jacket on.

01:33:46.406 --> 01:33:46.866
This is from 2022.

01:33:47.266 --> 01:33:52.228
The dude's still wearing the same winter jacket.

01:33:54.909 --> 01:33:57.650
He just seemed like a guy trying to fight for the truth.

01:33:57.710 --> 01:34:03.672
He just seemed like a guy who didn't know what I know now, and I didn't know what I knew then either.

01:34:03.732 --> 01:34:05.713
I mean, I didn't know any of this before 2023.

01:34:08.533 --> 01:34:18.537
I didn't make any useful progress away from gain of function and that as a mythology until 2020, the end of 2022, really, if I give myself the most leeway.

01:34:20.618 --> 01:34:29.381
And so it's not unusual that also Paul was there and a lot of other people were there and all the academic biologists in the United States that still have a job are still there.

01:34:31.342 --> 01:34:34.743
Just now figuring out it might be a lab leak and the gain of function is dangerous.

01:34:36.817 --> 01:34:46.579
that maybe they're doing gain of function of flu viruses now, according to the substack of Peter McCullough just today.

01:34:47.939 --> 01:34:59.101
This is an ongoing operation where the narrative is being curated by the same people who were recruited very early before this went off the rails.

01:35:01.121 --> 01:35:04.882
I think there are some real weak links in the chain right now.

01:35:05.509 --> 01:35:07.411
that don't want to be part of it anymore.

01:35:09.012 --> 01:35:12.675
They probably didn't want to be part of it already in 2021 or 2022.

01:35:12.995 --> 01:35:15.418
And they finally figured out that something isn't right here.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.422
And now we're in 20, then we got into 2023.

01:35:20.782 --> 01:35:22.804
And again, it was like, ah, something's not right here.

01:35:22.864 --> 01:35:25.306
Now we're at the end of 2024, ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:25.766 --> 01:35:28.689
And a lot of people I think are starting to wake up to the illusion.

01:35:32.731 --> 01:35:40.516
And the illusion being as simple as agreeing that these people should stand in front, that these people have something to say that I shouldn't get in the way of.

01:35:42.817 --> 01:35:49.661
And then these people ran the clock long and far for their own benefit.

01:35:50.233 --> 01:35:51.373
because they're working for them.

01:35:51.853 --> 01:35:55.794
Landmark threats to our public health.

01:35:55.814 --> 01:35:59.595
That's why he's faced, that's why he's featured.

01:35:59.615 --> 01:36:04.795
Dr. Phil Feldner for a series of important early experiments, first at the Salk Institute.

01:36:04.835 --> 01:36:09.376
But not naming all the people like Wolf and the other guys that he made this stuff with.

01:36:09.476 --> 01:36:19.458
So it's really obvious if you know the history and you know how this is done, that this would not happen to somebody who is genuinely being censored.

01:36:20.947 --> 01:36:25.090
This would not happen if this was not information that they actually wanted you to have.

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.252
So that you would engage in the mystery solving.

01:36:29.953 --> 01:36:34.856
And once you engage in the mystery solving, then you really accept all the monsters and they are real.

01:36:36.777 --> 01:36:41.400
Once you really leave cookies for Santa Claus and the cookies are gone, you believe.

01:36:47.363 --> 01:36:48.324
That's how this works.

01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:56.113
then at a San Diego company called VyCal.

01:36:56.533 --> 01:36:59.836
Dr. Feldner invented the first lipid nanoparticle.

01:37:00.136 --> 01:37:04.959
Malone mixed it with mRNA and injected them into the first living organism.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.842
The two are listed on papers together.

01:37:08.062 --> 01:37:11.284
Do you have any idea why he's, like, so soured on the technology?

01:37:11.504 --> 01:37:12.765
He's got a mask on.

01:37:12.865 --> 01:37:18.970
I don't, uh... I don't, uh, have, uh, much of an explanation for that.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.551
It's mysterious to me, too.

01:37:21.191 --> 01:37:22.733
And what slide did he put on there?

01:37:22.813 --> 01:37:25.035
Lipid mRNA, lipid nanoparticle.

01:37:25.055 --> 01:37:26.977
Yeah, it's just, it's insane.

01:37:27.558 --> 01:37:35.767
As for Malone, he did not respond to an email from us seeking comment, but he has said publicly that he feels he's not getting the credit for his work that he deserves.

01:37:36.167 --> 01:37:38.550
He wants to be seen as the inventor of this technology.

01:37:38.610 --> 01:37:43.134
And when he, when he wasn't by the scientific establishment,

01:37:44.494 --> 01:37:47.256
I don't know, I guess he, maybe he just turned against it.

01:37:47.436 --> 01:37:57.883
He considers Dr. Feldner a possible contender for the Nobel Prize and says Dr. Malone might be one too, if not for his crusade against the vaccines.

01:37:58.163 --> 01:38:11.132
I think everything he's done in the past year to sow doubt about the technology will be far more consequential in the grand scheme of things than experiments that he did

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:15.823
that helped move the science forward 30 plus years ago.

01:38:15.983 --> 01:38:17.648
Derek Stahl, ABC 10 News.

01:38:24.324 --> 01:38:26.865
So I was all ready to go nuts about this.

01:38:26.925 --> 01:38:30.145
And then of course, what I was going to predict happened, happened.

01:38:30.205 --> 01:38:41.448
So on Friday, I was going to do a show that would have featured this article, which I believe was on Friday, where they're complaining about this diary of a CEO podcast.

01:38:41.468 --> 01:38:44.449
Now, I don't know if you're familiar with the diary of the CEO podcast.

01:38:45.109 --> 01:39:04.118
It is a YouTube channel with many millions of followers and actually just recently They had some kind of number 200 episode or 100 episodes or whatever it was And in the beginning of that episode this host I think he's formerly from some Some, you know reality show in Britain.

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:11.082
He's got a very fancy British accent and wears earrings in both ears.

01:39:11.122 --> 01:39:11.882
He's kind of like a

01:39:12.469 --> 01:39:14.450
He's kind of like a brown George Michael.

01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:22.253
And of course, so, you know, he's a very successful podcast host, you know, with very good production levels and whatever, and great thumbnails.

01:39:22.653 --> 01:39:25.414
But the really funny part about it is, is that, um,

01:39:27.693 --> 01:39:38.276
They make it seem like he's just a guy who made it spontaneously, but he makes millions of dollars, $11 million a year from ads from this video.

01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:41.196
I mean, this is not spontaneous.

01:39:41.236 --> 01:39:42.157
This is how it works.

01:39:42.617 --> 01:39:43.397
He was set up.

01:39:44.537 --> 01:39:46.738
He's like a Rogan, but on YouTube.

01:39:47.858 --> 01:39:51.299
And now the BBC News is doing advertisements for him.

01:39:52.665 --> 01:39:54.687
Now the interesting thing is, what does that do?

01:39:54.748 --> 01:39:59.273
Well, everybody that's reading the BBC is now maybe curious about what his YouTube channel looks like.

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:05.200
And so if they're curious about what his YouTube channel looks like and they go there, they'll find Jordan Peterson.

01:40:06.698 --> 01:40:15.722
And this character, I don't even know his name anymore, but he's a very interesting one because I think he's kind of connected to some guy who is also advising Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:16.582 --> 01:40:22.704
And then there's this guy that has a podcast that everybody says is interesting and was on Rogue.

01:40:22.724 --> 01:40:23.805
And then there's this lady.

01:40:24.505 --> 01:40:28.407
who talks about nukes and the Pentagon and all kinds of other stuff.

01:40:28.927 --> 01:40:36.711
And then there's this guy who's got a podcast that all of them are on and that Eric Weinstein goes on all the time and talks to him about stuff.

01:40:37.992 --> 01:40:46.917
And then there's this guy who all these people podcast for and he thinks he created a billion dollar business and he's an example of anybody can do it.

01:40:47.317 --> 01:40:52.820
He thinks that he spontaneously created something on YouTube that's worth billions of dollars, which is absurd.

01:40:54.574 --> 01:40:56.035
Maybe Elon believes it too.

01:40:57.035 --> 01:40:59.376
Maybe Jeff Bezos believes it too, but I don't think so.

01:40:59.416 --> 01:41:00.417
I think they all know.

01:41:01.437 --> 01:41:06.940
I don't think this guy here, he might not know, but a lot of these people know that they are part of a theater.

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.462
Annie Jacobson doesn't know.

01:41:09.482 --> 01:41:12.943
She's just, she's just happy to write stuff.

01:41:14.424 --> 01:41:15.605
But a lot of these people know.

01:41:16.825 --> 01:41:20.127
They know that they have been shown behind the first curtain.

01:41:20.765 --> 01:41:30.428
They know that the internet is being used to govern global opinion, to control the movement of people's organized habits and opinions.

01:41:31.509 --> 01:41:36.870
And that if this control is not in the right hands, we could have a serious problem.

01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:44.453
If Russia and China have control over what the American populace thinks about certain things, we could have a problem.

01:41:44.893 --> 01:41:47.854
And so of course it becomes necessary for America to do it.

01:41:49.258 --> 01:41:49.918
Don't you see?

01:41:50.759 --> 01:41:56.283
There is a national security imperative for us to control the internet and the opinion on it.

01:41:56.703 --> 01:42:05.049
We can't let it go spontaneously because if we do that, then we will acquiesce to its control by other influencers, by other influences.

01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:11.033
State actors that also operate their own anonymous accounts.

01:42:11.493 --> 01:42:14.815
State actors that also influence their own podcasters.

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:19.018
And now you can see it a little clearer.

01:42:20.495 --> 01:42:22.356
All of these people are examples of this.

01:42:22.416 --> 01:42:26.358
That's why the AI guy was also on there.

01:42:27.879 --> 01:42:30.841
The Yuri Gavalli, whatever.

01:42:31.941 --> 01:42:33.842
That's why Sam Harris was on there.

01:42:34.383 --> 01:42:37.645
That's why this cancer guy was on there.

01:42:40.326 --> 01:42:42.467
That pushes the Warburg effect, basically.

01:42:43.848 --> 01:42:45.289
That's why this guy was on there.

01:42:46.288 --> 01:42:57.592
the guy that was on stage with Jordan Peterson and Brett Weinstein at the Rescue the Republic, these two foreigners, Jordan Peterson up there in the corner and this guy.

01:42:57.612 --> 01:42:59.412
They're all on the same show, really?

01:42:59.432 --> 01:43:01.113
Oh, wait, this guy too?

01:43:01.953 --> 01:43:03.013
No, you're kidding me.

01:43:03.513 --> 01:43:11.776
Oh, and who was most recently on pushing misinformation on the Diary of a CEO podcast?

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.141
none other than Brett Weinstein.

01:43:19.581 --> 01:43:26.203
And so, of course, we were going to be given this in on a platter here, right?

01:43:26.263 --> 01:43:36.326
Because then a couple days later, of course, he's got the excuse to do a podcast where he says that the BBC World Service has gotten this guy wrong.

01:43:37.467 --> 01:43:38.947
I know because he's a friend of mine.

01:43:38.987 --> 01:43:40.528
I was just on his show recently.

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.868
You know, don't bother watching that.

01:43:43.248 --> 01:43:44.849
But it's important to watch that

01:43:46.704 --> 01:43:53.090
And I've been censored and now this good friend of mine, this diary of a CEO podcast guy, he's also being censored.

01:43:55.472 --> 01:43:57.494
Think about how extraordinary that is.

01:43:57.554 --> 01:43:58.755
This is not a joke.

01:43:59.176 --> 01:44:05.722
This is the BBC News, essentially indirectly promoting the intellectual dark web.

01:44:07.583 --> 01:44:12.228
Is it just a pay in that reporter to write a dumb story like this?

01:44:14.316 --> 01:44:39.527
or did they set up the diary of a CEO, drive him to a certain level of objectivity with followers and with fortune and fame and then set him up just for this play to continue to spread the knowledge, the awareness of the limited spectrum of debate and who is reinforcing it?

01:44:40.987 --> 01:44:53.998
And so by populating his program with all of these people and then doing a BBC article about it, they have essentially indirectly promoted all of these people.

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:57.301
This is not accidental.

01:44:57.321 --> 01:45:02.766
This is how we are being governed.

01:45:03.809 --> 01:45:14.019
and Brett Weinstein is participating in it and trying to maximize his role in it and his ability to extract wealth, comfort, and fame from it.

01:45:16.641 --> 01:45:18.142
There is no teaching here.

01:45:18.222 --> 01:45:19.504
There is no end game.

01:45:19.564 --> 01:45:24.028
There is no goal except for maximum grift.

01:45:25.029 --> 01:45:26.590
I hate the word, but that's what it is.

01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:28.332
They are just siphoning off the top.

01:45:29.625 --> 01:45:38.347
and not questioning anything useful because they know that that would, by definition, disqualify them from being behind the curtain.

01:45:42.168 --> 01:45:45.209
That's the best that I can do as far as trying to break it.

01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:56.772
I wanted to talk about a piece of correspondence that showed up in my email, which suggests another landscape of horror.

01:45:57.072 --> 01:45:57.412
Oh, good.

01:45:58.511 --> 01:46:07.918
So actually, if you would show the email that I received from a reporter at the BBC.

01:46:08.298 --> 01:46:12.101
Of course the reporter at the BBC asked for his opinion.

01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:19.186
And of course the reporter at the BBC News Hour declared him to be part of the misinformation.

01:46:20.487 --> 01:46:23.449
And so now Brett has to respond to the BBC.

01:46:29.306 --> 01:46:30.086
Stop lying!

01:46:30.547 --> 01:46:33.428
Do you know how easily this could be staged?

01:46:35.588 --> 01:46:37.289
How ridiculous this could be?

01:46:37.929 --> 01:46:40.010
Especially if he doesn't name the reporter.

01:46:41.351 --> 01:46:41.851
Let's listen.

01:46:43.635 --> 01:46:43.895
Okay.

01:46:43.935 --> 01:46:48.376
So, the uh letter reads, dear Brett Weinstein, that's me by the way.

01:46:49.137 --> 01:46:50.697
I'm that's not in the letter.

01:46:50.717 --> 01:46:51.537
I was just commenting.

01:46:52.118 --> 01:46:59.400
I am a journalist with the BBC World Service Languages Disinformation Team based in the UK.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:06.722
We are currently looking at the disinformation being amplified on quote the diary of a CEO podcast.

01:47:07.725 --> 01:47:17.562
We have found that in the episode you were invited to, you shared false information, which if followed could lead to patient harm, i.e.

01:47:18.023 --> 01:47:20.568
negative outcome for those following that advice.

01:47:21.926 --> 01:47:40.218
We plan to publish a story on the BBC's platforms in England, and by BBC World Services and other languages, and would like to provide you with the opportunity to respond to our findings.

01:47:40.479 --> 01:47:43.661
Specifically, we are likely to make reference to the following.

01:47:44.827 --> 01:47:53.721
Before appearing on the podcast, you spread climate change conspiracies and anti-vaccine conspiracies, among many others.

01:47:53.981 --> 01:47:54.362
Could you?

01:47:54.382 --> 01:47:55.463
I know.

01:47:56.903 --> 01:48:01.026
on the podcast, you promoted 17 harmful claims.

01:48:01.846 --> 01:48:15.856
These include widely debunked statements such as that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are more effective than the COVID-19 vaccine and that the COVID vaccine was a kind of gene therapy.

01:48:16.536 --> 01:48:16.797
I know.

01:48:17.917 --> 01:48:20.418
Oh my gosh, and now they're gonna laugh about it, you see?

01:48:20.498 --> 01:48:26.940
So now they're doing the same thing that Robert Malone did all the way back on Jimmy Dore in 2021, in 2024.

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:31.021
They are getting you to accept it as a gene therapy.

01:48:31.061 --> 01:48:32.961
Well, they are a gene therapy, duh.

01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:34.862
That's why it's so funny.

01:48:35.582 --> 01:48:38.063
Robert Malone already explained how they're gene therapies.

01:48:38.103 --> 01:48:39.303
They're not transfection.

01:48:39.703 --> 01:48:45.965
Even though I have a slide of tweets where Brett says that's the right word, I guarantee he's not gonna say that here.

01:48:47.079 --> 01:48:49.121
And if he does, I'll probably fall out of my chair.

01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:50.262
I haven't watched this yet.

01:48:51.363 --> 01:48:52.243
This is a live one.

01:48:56.147 --> 01:48:59.029
We would be grateful for a written response.

01:48:59.089 --> 01:48:59.770
Oh, but wait a minute.

01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:00.711
So harmful.

01:49:01.532 --> 01:49:03.994
They didn't say that those were disinformation, actually.

01:49:04.014 --> 01:49:04.974
They just said they're harmful.

01:49:06.738 --> 01:49:16.212
We would be grateful for a written response by no later than 17 o'clock GMT, UK local on the 28th of November 2024.

01:49:17.314 --> 01:49:21.160
If you have any further questions, feel free to email me, Jackie Wakefield.

01:49:22.406 --> 01:49:25.989
Now, I will say, Jackie Wakefield gets a point.

01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.869
Does she?

01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:28.611
Yes, she does get a point.

01:49:29.191 --> 01:49:33.594
She actually reached out and she actually gave me enough time for me to respond to her.

01:49:33.774 --> 01:49:37.757
Not a ton of time, but enough time that I could, in principle, write back to her.

01:49:37.817 --> 01:49:40.800
Now, what she would do with what I wrote back, I don't know.

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.503
But I do, you know, as much as I find this ridiculous,

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.782
the opportunity to actually respond is journalistically responsible.

01:49:52.802 --> 01:49:55.423
And so anyway, Jackie, did he respond?

01:49:59.165 --> 01:50:04.328
Are you telling me that on the, did somebody asked him to respond before November 28th?

01:50:04.428 --> 01:50:09.650
And we are now at the, that was the 15th and the 16th of December.

01:50:09.690 --> 01:50:11.011
Did he respond or not?

01:50:11.091 --> 01:50:12.632
Is he about to read the response?

01:50:13.672 --> 01:50:16.714
Because if he didn't respond, I mean, think about that.

01:50:17.895 --> 01:50:20.196
Think about the opportunity that he had.

01:50:22.536 --> 01:50:43.103
The opportunity that I thought I had when I was in a signal chat with him in 2020 and 2021, trying desperately to explain to him why it was so important to teach people that this is old technology called transfection and transformation, and that that would help people to understand that it's not new, it's not gene therapy, and it's not a vaccine.

01:50:44.183 --> 01:50:46.444
It's transfection, and they know it's not good for you.

01:50:48.393 --> 01:50:49.234
We have to stop.

01:50:49.374 --> 01:51:02.687
Why is it that we're in 2024 and these people, although there's video evidence and signal chat evidence and Twitter evidence that they know and knew for years,

01:51:04.028 --> 01:51:07.189
They're still not capable of saying that it was murder.

01:51:07.569 --> 01:51:12.951
They're still not capable of saying these technologies are old and were never appropriate for healthy people.

01:51:13.472 --> 01:51:17.513
And they're still incapable of saying that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:51:17.673 --> 01:51:18.593
Not even close.

01:51:19.734 --> 01:51:23.575
They are decades away from saying that if they're ever going to get there at all.

01:51:25.396 --> 01:51:26.476
It's not on their map.

01:51:27.777 --> 01:51:28.737
It's not a goal.

01:51:28.817 --> 01:51:30.618
They don't want people to understand that.

01:51:32.383 --> 01:51:43.350
just like they don't want people to understand what transfection meant before the pandemic, just like they don't want people to understand that endemicity cannot be differentiated from a background without any data.

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:52.837
And those are things that I tried for literally years to convince these people of, a lot of them.

01:51:55.218 --> 01:52:02.103
That's why I probably won't be able to stop for a few more years, at least, until something seriously different happens.

01:52:03.166 --> 01:52:10.178
Because this truth needs to get out, even if it needs to get out one day at a time, one stream at a time, one book at a time, one article at a time.

01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.345
Somebody will do it at some point, I assume.

01:52:14.685 --> 01:52:15.467
Thank you for doing that.

01:52:16.534 --> 01:52:23.436
Um, I do want to say that she is part of an endeavor I've lost track of the title of it, but she wait a minute.

01:52:23.676 --> 01:52:25.336
Are we going past that now?

01:52:26.137 --> 01:52:39.080
He's gonna say that the reporter Deserves a gold star for giving me the opportunity to respond with a kind of enough time to do so But then he didn't respond Are you kidding?

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.181
And his his his

01:52:43.286 --> 01:52:51.577
I guess drooling on themselves, viewers are not sophisticated enough to be like, whoa, back the truck up, Brett.

01:52:51.977 --> 01:52:52.959
What was your answer?

01:52:58.581 --> 01:53:00.622
This is going to be remarkable.

01:53:00.863 --> 01:53:09.308
He is effectively on the BBC's disinformation beat, which is preposterous on its face, right?

01:53:09.348 --> 01:53:18.754
This is just more of the same bullshit that we saw at the Stanford Internet Observatory and the ill-fated Ministry of Truth.

01:53:19.155 --> 01:53:28.521
The whole idea that there's a group of people who are possessed of the facts, who are in a position to say who amongst us is speaking about things that are counter to the facts,

01:53:29.081 --> 01:53:31.422
is, of course, insane on its face.

01:53:32.303 --> 01:53:48.931
The facts are something that we arrive at having had a vigorous discussion in which different perspectives that can't be reconciled are allowed to compete with each other and we discover, frankly, Jackie, I don't know if you know this, but the test is who has predictive power.

01:53:49.091 --> 01:53:51.473
That's how we know which facts are correct, not

01:53:52.233 --> 01:54:00.901
because we looked them up on some official looking website in which the CDC told us what was true or something like that which is presumably the method that that you are using.

01:54:01.562 --> 01:54:07.287
The CDC which during COVID at one point the head of it admitted that she was getting her information from CNN.

01:54:07.788 --> 01:54:07.988
Right.

01:54:08.248 --> 01:54:09.609
So it's a circle jerk at best.

01:54:10.931 --> 01:54:11.992
A circle jerk at best.

01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:14.634
I'm gonna try not to name the episode that but

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:18.181
in any case.

01:54:18.421 --> 01:54:21.324
So, A, I find something interesting about this.

01:54:21.364 --> 01:54:32.234
For one thing, that episode of Diary of a CEO has been widely circulated and very well received in a lot of different quadrants.

01:54:32.434 --> 01:54:36.638
I was not aware of Diary of a CEO until they invited me to go on the program.

01:54:37.159 --> 01:54:41.483
I was very impressed with what they did, and so they came to LA, they flew me down,

01:54:42.383 --> 01:54:49.948
And, uh, that guy has, like I said, he makes $11 million a year from ads and he has 50 employees.

01:54:51.049 --> 01:54:54.031
The diary of the CEO podcast, 50 employees.

01:54:54.691 --> 01:54:56.192
I don't have an it guy.

01:54:56.332 --> 01:54:58.534
I don't have somebody pushing any buttons for me.

01:54:58.574 --> 01:55:00.655
I don't have anybody editing anything for me.

01:55:00.675 --> 01:55:05.458
I don't even have a camera person helping me set things up and push buttons to start them.

01:55:06.218 --> 01:55:06.939
I have nothing.

01:55:08.624 --> 01:55:14.066
At most, I have my son that can carry my water bottle in if it doesn't fit in my equipment case.

01:55:14.126 --> 01:55:14.546
That's it.

01:55:18.347 --> 01:55:20.408
These people have 50 employees.

01:55:20.468 --> 01:55:23.649
These people make tens of millions of dollars a year.

01:55:23.989 --> 01:55:26.109
This guy got $500,000 from his former employer when he had to resign.

01:55:34.764 --> 01:55:40.847
I didn't even get a Christmas card from the University of Pittsburgh.

01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:53.794
I just don't understand how it is possible other than to, how we're gonna win, other than to keep pointing out that none of this is real.

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:59.857
Bret Weinstein's whole shtick is not real.

01:56:00.477 --> 01:56:01.618
He's playing a character

01:56:02.662 --> 01:56:08.025
He's as fake as the third podcast, portal podcast, where his brother and him do the shtick.

01:56:08.505 --> 01:56:11.386
It is as fake then and is as fake now.

01:56:13.027 --> 01:56:15.108
These are not authorities on anything.

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.789
These are not deep thinkers.

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:19.370
These are deep thinker posers.

01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:25.113
They are the Steven Seagal of, of science.

01:56:26.013 --> 01:56:28.815
The Steven Seagal of biology right here and his wife.

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:29.615
That's what this is.

01:56:35.296 --> 01:56:39.339
were very well researched on topics that I was interested in.

01:56:39.399 --> 01:56:45.143
The host, Stephen Bartlett, was excellent at engaging in dialogue, giving good pushback.

01:56:45.203 --> 01:56:48.826
Anyway, I thought it was a great podcast.

01:56:48.966 --> 01:56:51.928
OK, so he's going to plug that, of course, and that's going to be what this is.

01:56:51.968 --> 01:56:55.951
But what you got to do is you got to put it in the context of recent history and deeper history.

01:56:56.732 --> 01:57:03.157
You got to put it into the context of the idea that that the the no virus people are definitely a charade.

01:57:04.366 --> 01:57:10.673
led by the chief of that charade most likely Andy Kaufman and probably Tom Collin.

01:57:11.414 --> 01:57:23.888
They probably recruited the Bailey's and that's why Mark Bailey is never really that excited about doing streams with them but his wife really likes the fame and fortune that they got from it so he went along with it.

01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:25.850
But

01:57:27.031 --> 01:57:29.253
That picture right there should be all you need to know.

01:57:29.313 --> 01:57:39.060
He was making equipment to track potential suicides in getting a grant for tracking potential suicides in prisons.

01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:42.323
That's why he's shaking his hand right there.

01:57:43.564 --> 01:57:51.190
Now, of course, Stephen Hadfield would be an interesting character all of his own because of his interesting involvement in the post 9-11 dramas.

01:57:53.388 --> 01:58:07.853
and the anthrax letter drama, that would be interesting enough if it wasn't for the fact that he was also tied to Africa, like Meryl Nass is tied to Africa, and Ebola, like Meryl Nass is tied to Ebola.

01:58:08.253 --> 01:58:18.136
And it would be really, really, really interesting, wouldn't it, if in 2023, at an international COVID summit organized by Robert Malone, Meryl Nass,

01:58:19.378 --> 01:58:32.447
and Steven Hadfill and Brett Weinstein and Denny Rancor and Nick Hudson and Jessica Rose all posed for a photograph on the same stage in Romania.

01:58:33.728 --> 01:58:38.071
Because, you know, that's the best place to hold a COVID summit if you're trying to save the grandkids.

01:58:42.794 --> 01:58:44.015
That's the reality of this.

01:58:44.537 --> 01:59:01.222
the guy wearing the bandana and woodshop goggles in Dark Horse podcast number three, the guy who had Sam Harris on podcast number eight to say that, you know, when a real pandemic comes and it's killing 70% of the people it infects, we won't have any time to tolerate anti-vaxxers.

01:59:03.601 --> 01:59:25.246
If you put all of this stuff into context and see that there is no way to explain what Steven Hatfill is doing on the Tommy podcast with Robert Malone repeatedly, there is no way to explain him appearing on some podcasts in 2020 saying that when your kid is sick with COVID, you should go into his room with a rubber apron on.

01:59:26.391 --> 01:59:33.055
There is no way to explain how that guy was in Romania on stage with those people taking a picture.

01:59:33.075 --> 01:59:33.635
There's no way.

01:59:34.516 --> 01:59:36.076
Absolutely, positively, no way.

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:43.501
Other than to say that they are all part of the same elaborate

01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:57.990
set of theatrical machinery that is being unleashed and used against us to create the illusion that RNA can pandemic, that something happened that saved a lot of people, that transfection, although imperfect, is definitely the way forward.

01:59:58.411 --> 02:00:12.221
And all of these people will continue to be involved in it in one way or another, including creating usefully useless narratives that don't ask any useful questions to the people that engage in them.

02:00:15.734 --> 02:00:28.816
And that's why we are here right now where Sasha Latapova is still squeaking and still making noise in the corner somewhere, trying to maintain some level of usefulness to this clown show.

02:00:30.097 --> 02:00:31.197
The mother of Soph.

02:00:34.677 --> 02:00:38.958
The mother of Soph that was interviewed two or three times by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:00:39.158 --> 02:00:43.699
on his podcast, interviewed by the Epoch Times as an American thought leader.

02:00:45.444 --> 02:01:10.050
which of course then automatically puts the Epoch Times on the same team as Robert Malone, the same team as Whitney Webb, the same team as Sasha Latipova, the same team as Pierre Corey, the same team as the reluctant Peter McCullough, the same team as Jessica Rose that's been on the team since the beginning, the same team as Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig, and probably as bad as saying the same team as Mike Eden.

02:01:12.332 --> 02:01:23.662
because all of them in the end have not usefully questioned the narrative and have not sufficiently taken and tried to score a touchdown by saying they murdered people and lied about it.

02:01:24.764 --> 02:01:27.405
in order to create the illusion that RNA can pandemic.

02:01:27.425 --> 02:01:29.425
Do you see how easy it is that they could say that?

02:01:29.485 --> 02:01:30.946
And none of them have ever managed to.

02:01:31.546 --> 02:01:35.267
Mike has been able to say that they designed the shots to hurt people.

02:01:36.008 --> 02:01:43.970
He says they've designed the shots to be toxic, but he didn't ever say that they murdered people and lied about it in order to coerce people into taking it.

02:01:46.107 --> 02:01:50.449
And I refuse to believe that he's not clever enough with the English language to have said that by now.

02:01:50.509 --> 02:01:56.190
I also refuse to believe that Mike Eden is not clever enough to know that Sasha Latupova is full of shit.

02:01:58.831 --> 02:01:59.892
But he promotes her now.

02:02:01.192 --> 02:02:06.794
And that makes me very sad because Sasha Latupova was on stage with Robert Malone at the beginning of 2023.

02:02:07.474 --> 02:02:14.757
And on stage, not only with Robert Malone, but also Asim Malhotra and Michael Palmer and Meryl Nass.

02:02:16.693 --> 02:02:26.085
saying nothing useful, essentially promoting one another as dissidents from the other side.

02:02:27.127 --> 02:02:28.709
And they are all players in this.

02:02:28.789 --> 02:02:34.757
That's why Asim Malhotra was on the diary of the CEO and now is essentially being indirectly promoted by BBC itself.

02:02:37.932 --> 02:02:39.012
It's all one show.

02:02:39.713 --> 02:03:01.342
And if we start to show that it's all one show that goes back to Soph and Alex Jones, that goes back to Alex Jones and Joe Rogan, that goes back to Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, goes back to the Weinstein brothers and their dad, and that's how it goes back to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:03:01.462 --> 02:03:06.544
and his dad, the Department of Justice where Brett Weinstein's father

02:03:07.793 --> 02:03:20.258
cut his teeth as a patent lawyer during the formation of the FDA when Senator Kiefhofer was alive, when the thalidomide scandal occurred.

02:03:22.018 --> 02:03:26.060
It is not by chance that these histories are all intertwined.

02:03:26.988 --> 02:03:45.683
These histories are all intertwined because they are all one history that has come to this moment, this five year or 10 year moment that we are now in right now, that we can wake our children up to realize is as paper thin as any paper mache that has ever been made.

02:03:45.723 --> 02:03:55.371
This is really spectacular time right now because it is brutally obvious that they are all in on the Scooby-Doo, brutally obvious.

02:03:56.974 --> 02:04:18.808
Just in the last week, brutally obvious that the Scooby-Doo is in play, that it is a lab leak, that one half will still say it's ridiculous, the other half will say it's obvious, and we are gonna have this screaming debate on TV, and it is going to be hosted by Jay Bhattacharya and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:04:18.928 --> 02:04:24.712
in their Senate confirmations, and it is gonna be a theater of the macabre, I tell you for sure.

02:04:27.042 --> 02:04:38.791
And so if you want to understand how we got here, if you want to understand that, you want to understand that this is real and you can see it on the news right now.

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:39.812
It's going to continue.

02:04:40.313 --> 02:04:41.353
I've shown it to you once.

02:04:41.413 --> 02:04:42.434
I'm going to show it to you again.

02:04:42.494 --> 02:04:43.195
These are real.

02:04:43.335 --> 02:04:44.216
These are right now.

02:04:44.316 --> 02:04:45.797
This is the last week and a half.

02:04:46.758 --> 02:04:48.099
So on the accountability level,

02:04:48.892 --> 02:04:52.875
I agree with the Democrat minority comments about Fauci.

02:04:53.115 --> 02:05:08.364
I do not believe Fauci was the architect of hiding that this happened in a lab or that he made COVID and that he wanted a gain-of-function research that would make it into a bioweapon the way the Republicans seem to make it go.

02:05:09.024 --> 02:05:12.707
Matt, you believe that there is some meat on the bones of that idea.

02:05:12.767 --> 02:05:12.987
Why?

02:05:15.129 --> 02:05:16.430
Uh, well, for a couple of reasons.

02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:27.737
I mean, one of the stories that I worked on was, um, how the, uh, famed article in nature medicine magazine called the proximal origin of COV2, uh, got to be published.

02:05:27.857 --> 02:05:38.424
How is it possible that in the end of 2024 with this intrepid journalist, Matt Tlaiby, we're still there where people are bringing up the proximal origin paper.

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:40.846
Is he about to say that Christian Anderson is a bad guy?

02:05:42.065 --> 02:05:44.907
And Redfield is sitting in on this one?

02:05:46.988 --> 02:05:49.550
And they're all gonna agree that it was a Scooby-Doo mystery.

02:05:49.590 --> 02:05:53.393
We just gotta figure out who the villains are, who's responsible for this.

02:05:55.994 --> 02:05:58.356
I don't think it was Tony Fauci, but you do.

02:05:58.936 --> 02:05:59.757
Let me know why.

02:06:04.068 --> 02:06:15.238
The scientists who put together that article, we were able to get access to their private Slack chats where you can see them early in the process talking quite candidly.

02:06:15.338 --> 02:06:21.443
Private Slack chats are no different than super secret signal groups.

02:06:23.906 --> 02:06:25.948
They create an illusion of consensus.

02:06:26.988 --> 02:06:30.630
They can create an illusion of consensus after the fact if they release them.

02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:33.291
You know what else can create an illusion of consensus?

02:06:33.651 --> 02:06:37.693
A fake grant proposal that gets leaked from some guy.

02:06:38.673 --> 02:06:40.034
And then we take it as evidence.

02:06:40.994 --> 02:06:43.055
That can also create an illusion of consensus.

02:06:43.515 --> 02:06:50.839
And you could create that illusion of consensus even more effectively if you got a bunch of different people to agree that it was worth talking about.

02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:53.780
For years.

02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:55.981
Or maybe worth including in a book.

02:07:00.246 --> 02:07:08.111
about how they think accidental release from a lab is a likely, or at least a serious possibility.

02:07:08.571 --> 02:07:12.953
And then they have communications with Anthony Fauci and they changed their mind.

02:07:13.093 --> 02:07:17.716
And there was, remember, there was testimony in Congress that there was no interaction.

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:19.257
So Redfield is there for what?

02:07:19.297 --> 02:07:26.081
To make sure that this doesn't go too far one way or another, stays right on the rails because the script is getting harder and harder to walk?

02:07:26.781 --> 02:07:29.523
The tight rope is getting harder and harder to balance on.

02:07:29.663 --> 02:07:30.064
I don't know.

02:07:31.284 --> 02:07:38.290
But he's definitely there, which is lending all kinds of the illusion of consensus to the idea that this is where we are right now.

02:07:42.364 --> 02:07:43.505
Next video, I don't know.

02:07:43.525 --> 02:07:44.526
I mean, we could keep going.

02:07:44.546 --> 02:07:45.907
I don't know how long this one is.

02:07:45.927 --> 02:07:47.108
This one might not be very long.

02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:51.693
In between these scientists and Dr. Fauci, and that just wasn't the case.

02:07:51.753 --> 02:07:53.174
And we were able to demonstrate that.

02:07:53.234 --> 02:08:02.883
And so that- Were you able to demonstrate that Fauci was on a chain or that Fauci personally spoke to them or whatever, communicated with them?

02:08:04.110 --> 02:08:06.351
he was on a conference he was on a conference call

02:08:26.118 --> 02:08:29.580
would get a pass for not knowing what was happening even though he's at the top of the food chain.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:37.624
Do you believe that Fauci is accurate, Bob, when it comes to what research was funded and whether or not it could have led to what is making me sick?

02:08:39.278 --> 02:08:48.165
Well, the exact grant that Tony's alluding to is not the virus that turned in to be COVID-19.

02:08:48.685 --> 02:08:59.413
But it's not to say that the money that the NIH and USAID, State Department, DOD gave to that lab to do gain of function.

02:08:59.594 --> 02:09:00.754
OK, so we can skip this.

02:09:00.795 --> 02:09:03.837
You know what he's going to say, and it's just curious that it's Redfield.

02:09:05.118 --> 02:09:07.700
So let's go on to the next video, just quick, same week.

02:09:12.093 --> 02:09:13.917
I might have to go out and come back in.

02:09:13.937 --> 02:09:16.143
Sorry about that.

02:09:23.012 --> 02:09:27.455
Congress's Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic is out with its final report.

02:09:27.875 --> 02:09:44.087
The 557-page document titled, After Action Review of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Lessons Learned and a Path Forward, has determined that a lab-related incident involving dangerous gain-of-function research in China is the most likely origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

02:09:44.707 --> 02:09:54.470
Per the subcommittee, the five strongest arguments in favor of the lab leak theory include, one, the virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not likely to be found in nature.

02:09:55.091 --> 02:10:04.774
Two, data shows that all COVID-19 cases stemming from a single introduction into humans, this runs contrary to previous pandemics where there were in fact multiple spillover events.

02:10:05.474 --> 02:10:13.477
Third, Wuhan is home to China's foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain-of-function research at inadequate biosafety levels.

02:10:13.777 --> 02:10:16.099
inadequate biosafety levels.

02:10:16.119 --> 02:10:21.643
Researchers were sick with a COVID-like virus in the fall of 2019, months before.

02:10:22.003 --> 02:10:23.304
You know who was else sick?

02:10:23.385 --> 02:10:32.351
There's a whole list of early COVID survivors that is hosted by Mark Kulak of Housatonic Live, and you should really go check out that list.

02:10:32.412 --> 02:10:41.739
It's a very curious cast of characters who publicly declared that they had COVID at the beginning of COVID, and that it was really strange and almost killed me.

02:10:43.735 --> 02:10:45.980
COVID-19 was discovered at the wet market.

02:10:46.541 --> 02:10:53.074
And five, by nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin, it would have already surfaced.

02:10:53.720 --> 02:11:01.827
The findings state that EcoHealth Alliance nonprofit used American taxpayer dollars to facilitate gain of function research in Wuhan, China.

02:11:02.428 --> 02:11:14.518
And the Proximal Origin publication, which was used to discredit the lab leak theory, was prompted by Dr. Anthony Fauci to push the preferred narrative that COVID-19 originated in nature.

02:11:15.059 --> 02:11:18.081
The report also states that more than 160,000 businesses closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic

02:11:21.496 --> 02:11:39.003
With 60% of those closures classified as permanent, unemployment rates surged to levels not seen since the Great Depression, and children experienced historic learning loss, higher rates of psychological distress, and decreased physical well-being due to school closures.

02:11:39.926 --> 02:11:44.709
Reactions on X are pouring in, and some people are less than pleased, saying the report does not go far enough.

02:11:45.329 --> 02:11:54.034
Media pundit Jeff Carlson posted, this report reads like a whitewash of Fauci, NIH, and the rest of our government, pinning most of the blame onto EcoHealth.

02:11:54.114 --> 02:11:57.136
Federal government was deeply involved in funding Gain of Function.

02:11:57.596 --> 02:11:59.938
Dasik's EcoHealth was simply the mechanism.

02:12:00.318 --> 02:12:01.799
We need a true accounting.

02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.082
Oh, did he skip the tag there?

02:12:06.122 --> 02:12:07.243
That was kind of mean.

02:12:07.823 --> 02:12:08.784
He skipped the tag.

02:12:08.824 --> 02:12:11.286
The tag was to Jay Bhattacharya, which I found interesting.

02:12:11.306 --> 02:12:11.486
See that?

02:12:19.917 --> 02:12:23.418
Now understand how this works, understand how this could potentially work.

02:12:23.938 --> 02:12:29.600
You have podcasters that you support on YouTube, you being the weaponized pile of money.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:42.843
And you also have accounts on X that can be used to say things, and then you can coach the people, the podcasts, the intellectual dark web that you control to quote these accounts.

02:12:45.359 --> 02:12:58.703
And now if he goes on to agree with these accounts and this is in your view, then without actually saying Dr. Bhattacharya, this whole podcast has just promoted him by quoting some random dude.

02:13:01.464 --> 02:13:05.305
Think about this for a second because this is how they're going to do it going forward.

02:13:05.325 --> 02:13:06.505
It's going to get better and better.

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:08.186
They're going to get better and better at it.

02:13:09.164 --> 02:13:36.819
And it's the cross-promotion that we are supposed to believe is just them going on the internet and seeing what the algorithm gives them, rather than it being a scripted set of characters that is promoting other people's scripted set of characters in order to make sure that a very limited spectrum of debate is exquisitely curated by what appears to be a completely random sampling of the internet activity available to us.

02:13:41.889 --> 02:13:43.553
Getting most of the blame onto EcoHealth.

02:13:43.613 --> 02:13:46.661
Federal government was deeply involved in funding Gain of Function.

02:13:47.122 --> 02:13:49.448
Dasik's EcoHealth was simply the mechanism.

02:13:49.829 --> 02:13:51.332
We needed true accounting.

02:13:52.668 --> 02:13:54.989
Other users wrote, when do the prosecutions start?

02:13:55.049 --> 02:14:00.270
The four years of trauma, four nasty cases of COVID-19 and damages accumulated by it.

02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:03.491
Nowhere is it expressly stated who will be held accountable for anything.

02:14:03.891 --> 02:14:09.072
None of this will matter unless actual humans are held accountable with financial loss and imprisonment.

02:14:09.452 --> 02:14:12.473
Select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic should be ashamed.

02:14:12.573 --> 02:14:13.273
Final report?

02:14:13.313 --> 02:14:15.594
This should just be the beginning.

02:14:16.554 --> 02:14:28.740
And I do appreciate the conclusions the report draws in terms of strengthening, bolstering the idea that this did in fact come from the lab and pointing out to the numerous failures.

02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.020
Who are these people?

02:14:31.121 --> 02:14:33.042
That's the question you have to ask yourself.

02:14:33.582 --> 02:14:36.483
There's no reason to be listening to these adults.

02:14:36.803 --> 02:14:37.544
Are they adults?

02:14:37.804 --> 02:14:42.206
Are they just pretending to be adults by wearing adult clothes and having an adult backdrop?

02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:47.715
Like these guys don't have the life experience to tell us what they think.

02:14:49.156 --> 02:14:54.502
These guys haven't done the necessary and prerequisite work to tell us what these things mean.

02:14:54.522 --> 02:15:04.252
And in fact, the internet is absolutely chock full of people who don't have the requisite experience to tell us exactly what they're talking about or explain it in more detail.

02:15:04.873 --> 02:15:05.474
They are

02:15:06.002 --> 02:15:06.823
script readers.

02:15:07.303 --> 02:15:08.384
They are actors.

02:15:09.045 --> 02:15:10.306
They are playing roles.

02:15:10.766 --> 02:15:17.593
They are doing what they are told, and they are being compensated very handsomely relative to the average Joe.

02:15:18.313 --> 02:15:21.997
They are being compensated very handsomely, and so they're going to continue to do it.

02:15:23.318 --> 02:15:25.460
There are no principles operating here.

02:15:27.842 --> 02:15:31.125
These are not the cream of the crop Boy Scouts.

02:15:33.612 --> 02:15:39.399
These are not the cream of the crop truth tellers that have risen spontaneously to prominence on the internet.

02:15:39.439 --> 02:15:40.720
That does not happen.

02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.546
The internet is the curtain, the first curtain.

02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:50.412
The internet is just the first curtain.

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.462
There's the irresponsible behavior of EcoHealth Alliance.

02:15:58.023 --> 02:16:09.152
I agree that our own governments, our own agency, NIH, Fauci himself, have not properly been held accountable for greenlighting this funding.

02:16:10.613 --> 02:16:14.995
I am increasingly sick of reports about reports about reports.

02:16:15.595 --> 02:16:30.301
I want to see the raw intelligence, and this is something I hope Cash Patel does when he gets into the FBI, because the FBI is one of two federal agencies, along with the Energy Department, that did conclude a lab origin was more likely than natural animal stuff.

02:16:31.581 --> 02:16:33.262
Natural animal stuff, that's the scientific term.

02:16:33.282 --> 02:16:34.443
Yes, the wet market.

02:16:35.643 --> 02:16:39.606
So the Department of Energy, of course, is where the Human Genome Project sat.

02:16:39.626 --> 02:16:41.927
The Department of Energy is also where nukes sit.

02:16:41.947 --> 02:16:46.350
The Department of Energy, I think, is probably pretty closely connected to DITRA and CBERN.

02:16:47.471 --> 02:16:57.258
And so it's interesting that the two people that they cite there are two what I would consider to be highly suspect agencies in this story.

02:16:58.638 --> 02:17:01.821
It was a lab leak based on some information they have.

02:17:02.663 --> 02:17:08.286
And the smoking gun, the strongest evidence would be that the scientists sick at the lab.

02:17:08.446 --> 02:17:15.349
If scientists are sick at the lab before the wet market happened, and they're sick at the lab with something resembling COVID, it's open and shut.

02:17:15.409 --> 02:17:15.769
It's done.

02:17:15.809 --> 02:17:17.410
That solves the issue.

02:17:17.430 --> 02:17:18.190
That's the smoking gun.

02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:20.011
And we have heard that.

02:17:20.251 --> 02:17:22.273
The Wall Street Journal has reported that that was the case.

02:17:22.853 --> 02:17:25.175
Other independent journalists have reported that that's the case.

02:17:25.415 --> 02:17:27.677
But I would like to see the raw intelligence that that is the case.

02:17:27.937 --> 02:17:33.161
That is what I presume the FBI has and the Energy Department and maybe that this selects up.

02:17:33.441 --> 02:17:35.543
The Department of Energy and the FBI.

02:17:35.603 --> 02:17:44.169
The FBI is another very good candidate for who's behind somebody like George Webb and maybe even, I don't know, not Robert Malone, but I don't know, maybe.

02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:50.223
or some private intelligence operation that the FBI contracted.

02:17:50.343 --> 02:17:50.704
I don't know.

02:17:51.364 --> 02:17:55.448
But George Webb feels to me like a possible FBI guy.

02:17:55.488 --> 02:17:57.830
And remember, FBI agents are fake all the time.

02:17:58.290 --> 02:18:08.019
The original plot in 1992 to blow up the World Trade Center was actually a plot run by the FBI, and that was purported by Time magazine.

02:18:08.059 --> 02:18:09.260
So we know that they do this.

02:18:10.866 --> 02:18:14.589
And so one of the things that we never talk about is the DOD.

02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:16.972
Sorry, we never talk about is the FBI.

02:18:17.012 --> 02:18:20.656
We're always talking about DOD, and we're always talking about CIA.

02:18:20.676 --> 02:18:25.841
I mean, Denny Rancor said on that Jason Levine podcast that I shared with him,

02:18:26.301 --> 02:18:29.263
He said that all these rich people are taking orders from the CIA.

02:18:29.284 --> 02:18:39.331
And I said, well, that's pretty, because there's like 18 other intelligence agencies in the United States that you have absolved from any role in this by saying that.

02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:40.192
That's just absurd.

02:18:40.232 --> 02:18:43.474
But you know, he knew he had to say, and he was scripted to say that.

02:18:43.514 --> 02:18:45.256
That's why he said it with so much gusto.

02:18:45.656 --> 02:18:49.599
He had no idea that I would come back so hard and fast with him and dunk on him like that.

02:18:49.979 --> 02:18:51.260
You can go see on the podcast.

02:18:53.322 --> 02:18:55.384
You can see how I put him back in his place.

02:18:55.844 --> 02:18:57.686
It's absurd what's going on here.

02:18:57.726 --> 02:18:59.148
These people are all playing.

02:18:59.628 --> 02:19:19.567
And the reason why I'm pretty confident that Denny Rancor is playing is because from the moment he told me he was going to Romania, and the moment I saw the picture of all the people who were in Romania that included Jessica Rose and Brett Weinstein and Steven Hatfill and Nick Hudson and Meryl Nass and Jill Glasspool Malone and Robert Malone,

02:19:21.684 --> 02:19:23.345
And I think Ryan Cole was there too.

02:19:23.446 --> 02:19:30.632
I don't know how many other people were there, but it's just disturbing because it's all one traveling clown show for seven.

02:19:30.652 --> 02:19:33.775
I'm going to go on seven international COVID summits.

02:19:33.835 --> 02:19:35.116
It's the same clown show.

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:38.389
Committee was able to see.

02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:40.270
But I'm sick of just hearing that asserted.

02:19:40.390 --> 02:19:42.590
I want to see the evidence that they have for that.

02:19:42.670 --> 02:19:43.711
And then it's and then it's done.

02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:44.711
And then we know it for sure.

02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:49.632
And we deserve to know it for sure, because it has to do with what we fund and where the culpability is.

02:19:49.893 --> 02:19:52.733
So that's the Scooby Doo mystery solved as far as he's concerned.

02:19:52.773 --> 02:20:01.956
And now, of course, the last one I'm going to play is of this Bloomberg character and of MSNBC News coverage of

02:20:03.186 --> 02:20:06.627
Bloomberg's response to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:20:06.687 --> 02:20:09.429
being nominated for HHS secretary.

02:20:09.989 --> 02:20:25.415
Now remember, Bloomberg is also the guy that funds the Bloomberg originals that I covered the other day, where they have one lady who's talking all about transhumanism and the human life to come and new human life and breaking all the rules of biology.

02:20:26.365 --> 02:20:36.370
And then there's another lady who they recruited from the BBC who actually did the hazelmere fiasco or the hazelmere prep.

02:20:39.178 --> 02:20:41.040
prep, uh, what would you call it?

02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.561
Operation or exercise.

02:20:42.601 --> 02:20:42.821
Sorry.

02:20:42.841 --> 02:20:43.902
That was the word I was looking for.

02:20:43.922 --> 02:20:56.112
Uh, that occurred in 2019 that you can find a lot of videos from pig Huey about, um, where really they just staged a pandemic using mobile phones in some town in the BBC or in the UK.

02:20:56.532 --> 02:21:02.957
And then at the beginning of the pandemic, curiously enough, that same town was one of the first places where there was a COVID case.

02:21:03.678 --> 02:21:05.019
Um, this guy, uh,

02:21:07.608 --> 02:21:15.853
Bloomberg is funding that girl's YouTube channel where she's doing all kinds of stuff with AI is going to solve all kinds of stuff.

02:21:16.314 --> 02:21:17.975
AI is going to do all kinds of magic.

02:21:18.075 --> 02:21:19.015
AI is dangerous.

02:21:19.115 --> 02:21:20.016
AI is wonderful.

02:21:21.117 --> 02:21:25.480
And so that guy's got something to say about Kennedy.

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:26.140
So let's listen.

02:21:27.025 --> 02:21:32.727
We can't allow Kennedy or Trump or anyone else to bring unimaginable suffering to the American people.

02:21:33.387 --> 02:21:42.190
So if the president-elect doesn't reconsider the nomination, the Senate has a duty to our whole country, but especially to our children, to vote no.

02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:45.712
So you can see the setup is happening already, right?

02:21:45.852 --> 02:21:52.274
If he gets confirmed, it will be some kind of victory that will then allow them to do whatever they want, including declare

02:21:52.794 --> 02:22:03.161
that the new generation of transfection-based vaccines are totally safe because they got the contamination out thanks to the help of Kevin McKernan and Philip Buckhalter.

02:22:06.323 --> 02:22:14.027
If he doesn't get the nomination, then somebody from Big Pharma will get it and we'll be right back on narrative and they'll just say, well, it's because of that senator or that senator.

02:22:14.448 --> 02:22:18.970
And a bunch of us will be very disappointed because we thought that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.731
was going to save us.

02:22:22.441 --> 02:22:27.784
Something like that is obviously coming because that's how this obviously works.

02:22:31.526 --> 02:22:47.894
With a nation facing a possible bird flu outbreak, are they really prepared to roll the dice on the lives of their constituents by placing someone in charge of public health who has made it clear that he will prevent or she will prevent the approval of life-saving vaccines?

02:22:49.773 --> 02:23:02.823
That was just a sample of Michael Bloomberg's plea to United States senators today, directly asking them to reject an anti-vaxxer as the country's Health and Human Services, HHS secretary.

02:23:03.323 --> 02:23:10.308
Bloomberg warned that the next pandemic isn't a question of if, but a question of when, and that putting RFK Jr.

02:23:10.388 --> 02:23:16.593
in charge of vaccine policy would be, quote, medical malpractice on a mass scale, end quote.

02:23:17.244 --> 02:23:18.645
It's not just that Kennedy.

02:23:18.745 --> 02:23:29.689
So now remember, there are going to be people on the internet that agree with him and think that this will be medical malpractice on a mass scale, which will drive some subset of people in the United States mad.

02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:31.370
Like crazy.

02:23:32.591 --> 02:23:46.623
I wonder if I'll be able to talk to one of my aunts because she definitely can't have a conversation about Donald Trump without some, you know, series of disengagements in gears happening and then smoke being produced.

02:23:47.984 --> 02:23:58.273
And so in this context right now, listening to this news program, it makes me very frightened as to what that person is thinking and what a lot of other people are thinking with regard to how bad

02:23:58.976 --> 02:24:01.777
the potential is that Donald Trump is doing this.

02:24:02.578 --> 02:24:19.786
It is a nightmare scenario, what they are saying here, because they're not saying it in jest or in sort of for comedic value, or this is meant to be as genuine as they can possibly portray it.

02:24:20.717 --> 02:24:34.548
He has promoted anti-vaccine conspiracies for years, or that he heads a group that specifically aims to undermine children's vaccines and the competence people have in them, or that he has no medical or public health degrees.

02:24:35.088 --> 02:24:44.535
But we actually know for a fact what vaccines do, thanks to studies and science and pediatricians and our own experience.

02:24:44.655 --> 02:24:50.200
The COVID-19 vaccine saved nearly 20 million lives globally during just the first year

02:24:50.640 --> 02:25:13.784
of vaccinations that's 20 million institutes of health which as part of hhs would think about how many more millions of people would have died of covid had we not rolled out transfection think about that statement 19 million wow that's a pretty remarkable result also fall under kennedy's control

02:25:14.434 --> 02:25:22.378
And of course, the assumption here is, is that these people wouldn't be lying about it, wittingly or unwittingly, just doing their job, not knowing that they're lying.

02:25:23.959 --> 02:25:27.381
The assumption is, is that there's no way that that could be a lie.

02:25:27.421 --> 02:25:29.502
There's no way that she's reading a lie.

02:25:29.542 --> 02:25:32.063
There's no way that the NIH published a lie.

02:25:34.584 --> 02:25:35.785
That's just not possible.

02:25:35.845 --> 02:25:37.326
It's not even on their radar.

02:25:37.346 --> 02:25:40.087
You have to see that because on our radar, it's obvious.

02:25:41.148 --> 02:25:42.008
Obviously they did.

02:25:44.073 --> 02:25:47.117
That's a very dangerous chasm between us right now.

02:25:48.919 --> 02:25:55.646
And yet Kennedy outrageously and falsely called it the deadliest vaccine ever made.

02:25:56.027 --> 02:25:57.809
Here's more from Michael Bloomberg today.

02:25:59.179 --> 02:26:06.525
After all, Kennedy has attacked what may be President Trump's biggest first-term accomplishment, something called Operation Warp Speed.

02:26:06.765 --> 02:26:13.911
It saved millions of lives, allowed the economy to reopen, and helped Americans get back to their normal routines.

02:26:14.171 --> 02:26:16.153
And just imagine if RFK Jr.

02:26:16.193 --> 02:26:18.475
had been in office during Trump's first term.

02:26:18.995 --> 02:26:23.679
How many fewer people... So is he now saying that Trump did well, that Warp Speed saved people?

02:26:23.699 --> 02:26:24.580
Of course he is!

02:26:25.961 --> 02:26:26.841
Of course he is.

02:26:27.844 --> 02:26:32.128
And it's in Donald Trump's best interest to never let them know that he doesn't think the same thing.

02:26:32.408 --> 02:26:46.781
Because the moment that they find out that he might understand that Warp Speed was him being taken advantage of, him rushing into something that he should have never rushed into and taking their word for it, he's no longer useful to them.

02:26:48.523 --> 02:26:49.944
People would have gotten the shot.

02:26:50.465 --> 02:26:52.447
How many more people would have died?

02:26:54.339 --> 02:27:07.107
our conversation, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Peter Hotez is here, Tim Miller is back with us as well.

02:27:08.168 --> 02:27:15.012
Dr. Hotez, let me just add a few more pieces of reporting into the conversation.

02:27:15.052 --> 02:27:16.853
The Associated Press last year reported

02:27:17.273 --> 02:27:19.074
that RFK Jr.

02:27:19.094 --> 02:27:21.174
has made his opposition to vaccines clear.

02:27:21.274 --> 02:27:26.016
Quote, in July, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that, quote, there is no vaccine.

02:27:26.576 --> 02:27:28.777
There's no vaccine that is safe and effective.

02:27:29.437 --> 02:27:35.479
RFK told Fox News that he still believes in the long ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.

02:27:35.879 --> 02:27:46.123
Now, keep in mind that I'm making the argument that safe and effective, the words are actually chosen very specifically because that is the actual mandate of the FDA.

02:27:47.560 --> 02:28:04.047
And so Fauci has been saying it, everybody has been saying it from the very beginning because the goal of this multi-year program is to bait and switch, shell game us into accepting the idea that personalized medicine is the future.

02:28:04.288 --> 02:28:07.729
And with personalized medicine, the FDA doesn't really play a role in that.

02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:16.273
And since the FDA is also responsible for us having really bad food and allowing really bad stuff to be in our food, then we should get rid of the FDA.

02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:25.141
has a sort of end around to this idea that personalized medicine isn't compatible with the FDA.

02:28:26.642 --> 02:28:45.585
There is no way for the FDA to exist as it exists and at the same time supervise personalized medicine because their mandate is to test and prove and to regulate the safety and effectiveness of products in the United States and their proper labeling.

02:28:48.257 --> 02:28:52.959
And so personalized medicine doesn't really fit into that whole scheme very well.

02:28:53.059 --> 02:28:58.421
And in fact, the existence of the FDA could be seen as prohibitive to it.

02:29:00.042 --> 02:29:10.727
And so what interesting, you know, sort of red thread that runs through all of these people's history, these families' history, these people's financial history, these interests,

02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:19.382
is the interest in intellectual property, the role that FDA plays in the intellectual property, the role that the FDA plays in approval of it.

02:29:23.002 --> 02:29:31.344
And so I think it's very likely that the FDA and its control or demolition or controlled demolition is at the heart of a lot of the motivation here.

02:29:31.864 --> 02:29:33.965
Because again, we're talking about billions of dollars.

02:29:34.747 --> 02:29:46.211
billions, if not trillions of dollars in potential pharmaceutical profits from mRNA, especially the mRNA transfection technology as applied in a personal manner.

02:29:47.551 --> 02:29:52.853
That's why Elon Musk and all of these guys like Peter Thiel are into printed mRNA.

02:29:53.513 --> 02:29:58.955
mRNA that is printed is not made by bacteria is the next step is the way that they clean it up.

02:30:01.909 --> 02:30:25.534
technologies are limited in the sequence length that they can make but they're nevertheless better and of course those technologies were already around at the beginning of the pandemic but then if they would have gotten us all the way there already then they wouldn't have been able to walk us through this five years of a scooby-doo that got everybody to number one except the existence of RNA viruses and their ability to pandemic but the potential for them to be generated in a laboratory released on purpose or accident

02:30:27.406 --> 02:30:31.947
and the appropriateness of a personalized vaccine for that kind of thing.

02:30:31.987 --> 02:30:53.692
Because, you know, like the guy on Jay Bhattacharya's podcast said a few months ago, you know, these all vaccines are not really that good because they should be designed for your own HLA receptor in particular, which is again, what somebody like Annie DeGroat could tell us about, the lady that worked at EpiVax and works at EpiVax, worked at EpiVax with Robert Malone.

02:30:55.693 --> 02:30:56.973
This biology is all known.

02:30:58.683 --> 02:31:01.745
And these people are coordinatedly lying about it for a very long time.

02:31:01.805 --> 02:31:09.849
They all have ties back to the earliest parts of AIDS and virology and immunology and the vaccine schedule.

02:31:11.310 --> 02:31:12.391
All the same mentors.

02:31:17.679 --> 02:31:24.444
In a 2021 podcast, he urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should be vaccinated.

02:31:24.724 --> 02:31:33.310
Quote, I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby, and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated, end quote, Kennedy said.

02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:44.337
And so wouldn't it have been a much bigger and better thing for him to say that if I see a pregnant woman on the hiking trail, I tell her don't get vaccinated.

02:31:44.377 --> 02:31:46.399
That would have been a much better one, wouldn't it have been?

02:31:47.287 --> 02:31:50.608
Too bad that's not what they said because this one's really easy to argue with.

02:31:51.708 --> 02:31:58.070
Let me just deal in facts and science since we have you and it's such a treat to get to talk to you.

02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:59.531
I really like her.

02:31:59.691 --> 02:32:04.092
She grates on my nerves so much that it feels like somebody's scratching my back.

02:32:04.312 --> 02:32:05.953
She's fantastic.

02:32:07.713 --> 02:32:12.575
On the link between vaccines and autism, I know this is an area of expertise for you.

02:32:13.115 --> 02:32:13.815
What are the facts?

02:32:15.629 --> 02:32:19.454
Yeah, the facts are, Nicole, vaccines do not cause autism.

02:32:19.494 --> 02:32:23.980
In fact, I wrote a book about my daughter because I'm a pediatrician, a vaccine scientist.

02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:25.582
I develop vaccines.

02:32:25.622 --> 02:32:31.190
We developed a COVID vaccine reaching 100 million people in India and Indonesia in our laboratories.

02:32:32.050 --> 02:32:50.434
and I also am the parent of an adult daughter with autism and I wrote a book called Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism to put that away and the massive scientific evidence showing there's no link and they allege different vaccines that started with the MMR vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella, then Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

02:32:50.654 --> 02:32:54.475
Now he's going to carefully reiterate the fake

02:32:55.839 --> 02:33:05.585
timeline that I have been trying to dismantle for a while now, the fake timeline that kind of starts with Mary Holland coming on the Democracy Now!

02:33:05.665 --> 02:33:13.390
program in 2015, the same year that Peter Daszak publishes the Gain of Function paper with Shengxi Li.

02:33:15.892 --> 02:33:20.555
And that's where this whole narrative started, where Ken, remember Wakefield in the UK,

02:33:21.741 --> 02:33:24.944
and Mary Holland in America both had the same objection.

02:33:25.484 --> 02:33:37.475
They said that these were not adequately tested and that some component of the MMR vaccine damaged my kid, or in the case of Wakefield, damaged these 24 kids that I'm writing a paper about.

02:33:38.856 --> 02:33:48.965
And so now he is very specifically re-articulating that history from 10 years ago, where not vaccines in general,

02:33:50.097 --> 02:34:05.286
but a specific component of a specific vaccine as being very carefully blamed for the injuring of kids and the causing of autism, which is not in any way, shape, or form even remotely approaching the idea that intramuscular injection in general is dumb.

02:34:06.186 --> 02:34:07.187
And they're still not there.

02:34:08.098 --> 02:34:21.189
After 10 years of fighting, 10 years of leading a crusade with rise and resist and people over profits and truth over lies and courage over fear, Mary Holland is nowhere closer to saying that intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:34:22.210 --> 02:34:24.352
Nowhere near close enough to saying

02:34:25.575 --> 02:34:29.776
RNA kidnap pandemic after having a professional relationship with me for more than a year.

02:34:30.216 --> 02:34:33.357
These people are traitors to our grandchildren.

02:34:33.417 --> 02:34:45.921
And it is obvious that they are all on the same team because now he's going to tell us this curious story about a Rolling Stone article that also Vincent Rack and Yellow and Paul Offit will tell us to go look up the Rolling Stone article.

02:34:46.321 --> 02:34:49.182
And they'll all say the same thing because they all have to.

02:34:50.455 --> 02:35:00.407
because there is one script, there is one history, and they must stick to that one history, or you will notice that this is not working out like it should have worked out.

02:35:00.467 --> 02:35:01.689
This is a Truman show.

02:35:04.151 --> 02:35:08.232
came out in 2005 in Rolling Stone Magazine, said it was thimerosal.

02:35:08.272 --> 02:35:09.133
It's all nonsense.

02:35:09.973 --> 02:35:15.034
And then also what we know about the genetics of autism, and now we have a number of autism genes.

02:35:15.354 --> 02:35:23.237
Genetics of autism, also something that none other than James Lyons Weiler knew enough to write a book with the title Genetic Causes of Autism.

02:35:23.937 --> 02:35:25.059
right before the pandemic.

02:35:25.099 --> 02:35:36.276
The same guy who right before the pandemic was saying that, I don't know if you guys know, but I know that all the vaccine preventable diseases are still circulating asymptomatically in the background.

02:35:36.777 --> 02:35:37.218
Duh!

02:35:38.615 --> 02:35:43.319
And then in 2020, that was one of the guys that first knew that it's a fear and cleavage site.

02:35:43.399 --> 02:35:44.900
Hmm, that's interesting.

02:35:44.980 --> 02:36:05.235
And even the highly dubious Harvard to the big house guy, Dan Saratkin, he even knew that he needed to find and found the blog of James Lyons Weiler and cited him as the guy who saw the fear and cleavage site first.

02:36:05.255 --> 02:36:07.177
Do you see how crazy that is?

02:36:08.353 --> 02:36:25.300
that a guy whose dad who works at Los Alamos Laboratory on sequencing algorithms that came out supposedly promoted by the Zero Hedge article that got my JC on a bike YouTube video like 15,000 views in a week.

02:36:28.117 --> 02:36:40.708
that I made a Jaycee on a Bike video about, that guy was already promoting James Lyons Weiler as the guy who knew that the fear and cleavage site was signed, that it was probably gain-of-function research in February of 2020.

02:36:40.788 --> 02:36:52.399
The same guy that CHD has had on stage at every one of their conferences from the inaugural one in 2020 to the last one last year, and he's probably gonna be at the one in a few months.

02:36:54.721 --> 02:37:00.603
The same guy who wrote a book, The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism Before the Pandemic.

02:37:03.124 --> 02:37:08.785
Just like Tom Cowan wrote a book that said that something's wrong, but not really anything precisely.

02:37:10.886 --> 02:37:12.467
They're all part of it, ladies and gentlemen.

02:37:12.487 --> 02:37:13.567
They were all put in place.

02:37:13.887 --> 02:37:14.867
That's how this worked.

02:37:15.387 --> 02:37:23.330
It was a long game, a long con, a long global con that has been

02:37:26.161 --> 02:37:31.965
permitted only because we accepted at the start of the pandemic that social media was what we had to communicate.

02:37:32.025 --> 02:37:35.268
Social media was going to way that we were going to figure out the truth.

02:37:36.809 --> 02:37:41.152
That's why all of them agree that, you know, I guess it's on Twitter where this truth is being censored.

02:37:41.212 --> 02:37:44.555
So I'm doing the best I can with my putting the truth on Twitter.

02:37:46.147 --> 02:37:47.288
that have been identified.

02:37:47.328 --> 02:37:49.250
So we have a complete story about it.

02:37:49.290 --> 02:37:51.413
So that is completely erroneous.

02:37:51.433 --> 02:37:55.297
There is no link between vaccines and autism, and it's awful that he keeps on pushing it.

02:37:55.617 --> 02:38:05.347
I mean, here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff, Nicole, is that we have some big-picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.

02:38:06.588 --> 02:38:10.451
Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1, that I'm really worried about.

02:38:10.531 --> 02:38:17.516
It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States, and going up in the north it's getting into the poultry.

02:38:17.857 --> 02:38:23.261
We're seeing sporadic human cases, no human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.

02:38:23.301 --> 02:38:26.283
It's in the cattle, it's in the milk, and that's just the beginning.

02:38:26.323 --> 02:38:30.086
We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.

02:38:30.126 --> 02:38:31.547
We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2, COVID-19 in 2019,

02:38:35.470 --> 02:38:39.793
And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.

02:38:40.353 --> 02:38:41.354
But that's, there's still more.

02:38:41.494 --> 02:38:48.618
Thousands of times a year, just like Peter Daszak says, 1.7 million viruses waiting to jump.

02:38:48.678 --> 02:38:50.880
It's all the same nonsense.

02:38:52.824 --> 02:38:53.825
It's all the same.

02:38:53.905 --> 02:38:57.088
It's not any going to change because this was the whole play.

02:38:57.108 --> 02:39:04.296
We know that we have a big problem with mosquito transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast where I am here in Texas.

02:39:04.316 --> 02:39:10.042
We're expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back or Apuche virus.

02:39:10.442 --> 02:39:40.082
maybe even yellow fever and there's more then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine preventable diseases going up because of in part the anti-vaccine activism that's so prominent right now we have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases whooping cough over the last year 15 measles outbreaks this year we've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York state all that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on on the Trump administration we need a really really good team to be able to handle this

02:39:40.422 --> 02:39:42.623
Wow, we need a very good team.

02:39:43.664 --> 02:40:00.153
All it takes, I mean RFK said I'm not going to take away anyone's vaccines, that may or may not be true, but all it takes is to say what he said on a hiking trail to a parent carrying a little baby, quote, I say to him better not get them vaccinated,

02:40:00.733 --> 02:40:05.677
And you've got people very, very sick or dying of all the diseases Dr. Hotos just listed.

02:40:05.937 --> 02:40:11.041
It's not about what you take away or don't supply.

02:40:11.421 --> 02:40:14.283
It's about what the country does.

02:40:14.943 --> 02:40:17.785
And I think we know already what the country will do.

02:40:17.865 --> 02:40:29.454
The pipeline of scientific disinformation, the attacks on Dr. Hotos specifically, and doctors and scientists generally, it's a play the right has been running for years.

02:40:30.755 --> 02:40:39.905
Your thoughts as we head into the final period where you might have science-based government health agencies?

02:40:42.301 --> 02:40:43.822
Yeah, and there's a lot concerning there.

02:40:43.842 --> 02:40:51.549
I would just start, since Dr. Hotez is here for his expertise on the science, I can bring my insight into the human condition.

02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:58.255
That is an insane person that stops on a hiking trail and says to a stranger, stranger.

02:40:58.455 --> 02:41:00.217
Now, keep in mind what this does.

02:41:00.477 --> 02:41:07.423
It's very much akin to, I think the guy who said it best is Dave Chappelle.

02:41:09.158 --> 02:41:12.179
because when you call people crazy, it's dismissive.

02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:16.961
You don't have to take any of their ideas seriously if you call them crazy.

02:41:16.981 --> 02:41:18.282
And that's what's happening right here.

02:41:18.682 --> 02:41:22.243
And it is a very dangerous position to take on anyone.

02:41:23.304 --> 02:41:26.725
It would be dangerous to call Robert Malone crazy, because he's not.

02:41:32.202 --> 02:41:34.185
And so understand what's happening here.

02:41:34.245 --> 02:41:36.448
The fracturing of America is ongoing.

02:41:36.488 --> 02:41:39.071
The controlled demolition is happening as we speak.

02:41:39.532 --> 02:41:46.801
And because we are so compartmentalized on social media, you may not be aware of how bad it is, how far away some of these people are from us.

02:41:47.722 --> 02:41:50.426
But it is a very dangerous position that we are in right now.

02:41:51.584 --> 02:41:53.264
They should not vaccinate their child.

02:41:53.364 --> 02:42:00.686
I could you imagine if I was in that situation walking on a hiking trail with my child, I would be running away as quickly as possible.

02:42:00.707 --> 02:42:02.047
Like, please do not talk to me, sir.

02:42:02.627 --> 02:42:13.250
And so like the idea that having a deranged person in charge of HHS like leads to a lot of potential risks and problems and it just ensures management in addition to what

02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:15.871
We're talking about here specifically with regards to vaccines.

02:42:15.891 --> 02:42:30.418
So I think that's number one I really hope this guy is not in charge of anything other than the time and temperature of Coffee roasting or something like that because this is really frightening one number two is just like the messaging element of all of this

02:42:30.658 --> 02:42:40.385
I think that you can play a nudging role within government that is different from laws and rules.

02:42:41.025 --> 02:42:48.210
Having government officials raising questions about this changes human behavior.

02:42:48.350 --> 02:42:53.073
I think that's very concerning, particularly when it comes to vaccines.

02:42:53.834 --> 02:42:56.816
The last thing I'll just say about this is having Michael Bloomberg as an advocate.

02:42:57.356 --> 02:42:59.557
He might be a Democrat, but in a lot of ways,

02:43:00.618 --> 02:43:26.553
RFK like have some weird overlap and like that make America healthy again uh space like Bloomberg has credibility here he really there are legit ways the government could come in and you could disagree or agree on whether that's government's role as far as you know big gulps and discouraging health and like there are ways to do that and so for Bloomberg to be the voice there I think is very telling because like you could imagine a different world where him and RFK would have areas of agreement and instead he's sounding the alarm.

02:43:27.734 --> 02:43:28.094
All right any

02:43:29.801 --> 02:43:32.422
So yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at here.

02:43:32.442 --> 02:43:33.983
This is what they are subjected to.

02:43:34.023 --> 02:43:35.563
This is what we are subjected to.

02:43:35.623 --> 02:43:38.824
And so I want to go through this very quickly because I know we don't have a lot of time.

02:43:38.864 --> 02:43:40.425
The server is probably crashing already.

02:43:41.826 --> 02:43:43.066
This is how they did it, right?

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:45.607
It's an illusion that they created over time.

02:43:45.727 --> 02:43:46.667
They sustained it.

02:43:46.767 --> 02:43:49.568
They made us ask dumb questions for many, many years.

02:43:50.109 --> 02:43:57.431
And those dumb questions served to put in everybody's head the idea after five years that this probably could have been a lab leak.

02:43:57.451 --> 02:43:58.832
And if not, the next one could be.

02:43:59.372 --> 02:44:03.735
And there's infinite potential for this to go wrong if we stop vaccinating our children.

02:44:05.277 --> 02:44:06.217
And that's how we're here.

02:44:06.257 --> 02:44:07.658
That's what 2024 is.

02:44:07.698 --> 02:44:08.719
That's what we just watched.

02:44:08.779 --> 02:44:09.600
It's a lab leak.

02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:14.924
And vaccines are good or bad or dangerously questioned or something like that.

02:44:15.685 --> 02:44:16.185
And in 2020,

02:44:18.911 --> 02:44:26.475
In July was when I was saying that this is likely originated from a laboratory source, but SARS-1 and its descendants have gone endemic.

02:44:27.135 --> 02:44:32.518
And so the current PCR test is not specific for SARS-CoV-2, but it's on a background.

02:44:32.558 --> 02:44:33.579
We are being duped.

02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:38.081
That's what it says right there on that slide in July of 2020.

02:44:38.241 --> 02:44:43.364
And that's why these people entered my life for the next five years, because I had it almost right.

02:44:45.199 --> 02:44:51.972
And the most essential part of that is, is that a background could be misconstrued as spread if they wanted to.

02:44:52.393 --> 02:44:54.317
And it would be very, very easy.

02:44:57.776 --> 02:45:04.302
And that's why in 2024, it is so miraculous that we are so perfectly divided on this absurd narrative.

02:45:04.782 --> 02:45:06.604
And how perfectly divided are we?

02:45:06.644 --> 02:45:09.947
Well, first of all, it is way more than perfect.

02:45:10.027 --> 02:45:11.728
It is beautiful like a script.

02:45:12.169 --> 02:45:17.693
Pandemics are real, but Fauci's a hero versus pandemics are real, but Fauci is responsible.

02:45:17.754 --> 02:45:18.374
You just heard it.

02:45:19.615 --> 02:45:22.798
Natural virus would kill millions every year if it weren't for vaccines.

02:45:22.818 --> 02:45:23.438
You just heard it.

02:45:24.289 --> 02:45:26.950
Natural viruses are not as bad as laboratory viruses.

02:45:26.970 --> 02:45:27.610
You just heard it.

02:45:27.791 --> 02:45:28.971
Flu vaccines are lame.

02:45:29.011 --> 02:45:29.691
You're gonna hear it.

02:45:31.792 --> 02:45:34.774
Millions have died of COVID, but millions more were saved.

02:45:34.794 --> 02:45:36.634
The lockdowns prevented some of those things.

02:45:36.694 --> 02:45:37.455
Nah, they didn't.

02:45:38.095 --> 02:45:39.136
COVID shots are fine.

02:45:39.176 --> 02:45:39.836
Don't talk about 2020.

02:45:40.856 --> 02:45:41.997
COVID shots are bad.

02:45:42.057 --> 02:45:43.017
Don't talk about 2020.

02:45:44.438 --> 02:45:47.379
Vaccines are one of the greatest advances in medical history.

02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:52.181
Vaccines might work, but they haven't been tested, and RFK's gonna get all the data.

02:45:52.221 --> 02:45:53.642
He's gonna put a pause on it.

02:45:55.424 --> 02:45:57.625
Lab viruses are real, but necessary.

02:45:57.665 --> 02:45:59.566
You can't stop gain-of-function research.

02:45:59.606 --> 02:46:00.186
That's absurd.

02:46:00.226 --> 02:46:01.187
We need that stuff.

02:46:01.527 --> 02:46:03.008
We just have to strictly regulate it.

02:46:03.028 --> 02:46:03.828
We already do.

02:46:06.209 --> 02:46:07.770
We need to more strictly regulate it.

02:46:07.810 --> 02:46:08.751
They're very dangerous.

02:46:08.771 --> 02:46:13.213
They're doing flu vaccines and flu experiments in Rotterdam.

02:46:15.598 --> 02:46:32.490
This is a diabolical trap because if you make the argument that sex is determined by chromosomes, you are gonna start to very quickly be tricked into making an argument that all disease and all biology that we need to understand is controlled by chromosomes and by DNA.

02:46:33.310 --> 02:46:37.013
It's a very big trap that fits right nicely into this thing.

02:46:37.033 --> 02:46:40.155
And then of course down here, we got the stuff that we can all agree on.

02:46:40.255 --> 02:46:41.696
Ukraine is fighting for freedom.

02:46:42.456 --> 02:46:44.078
No, Ukraine is a fake country.

02:46:45.014 --> 02:46:46.695
but also a neocon scam.

02:46:47.095 --> 02:46:50.538
Oh, but Ukraine is fighting for freedom, but also it's a neocon mess.

02:46:50.598 --> 02:46:54.040
And so we've got, we've got aspects of this on both sides.

02:46:54.180 --> 02:46:55.761
Israel has the right to defend itself.

02:46:55.801 --> 02:46:56.802
Don't talk about Gaza.

02:46:57.262 --> 02:46:58.864
Israel has the right to defend itself.

02:46:58.904 --> 02:47:02.026
Don't talk about Gaza is exactly the same thing that Bobby says.

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:13.423
And interestingly, Jessica Rose, dual citizen of Israel and Canada, has nothing to say about Israel rights to defend itself or about the children of Gaza at all.

02:47:13.863 --> 02:47:20.825
She's more concerned about going on Brett Weinstein's podcast, also a Jew, and talking about the existence of a molecule.

02:47:20.945 --> 02:47:22.186
Isn't that strange?

02:47:26.564 --> 02:47:31.427
Processed foods, seed oils, fast food, cosmetics, sunscreen, water, air, soil pollution.

02:47:31.548 --> 02:47:33.649
Oh yeah, they're all free to talk about that.

02:47:33.709 --> 02:47:40.214
And in fact, RFK and Bloomberg could agree on that, is what they just said in the last program.

02:47:43.256 --> 02:47:51.181
And now you see it, ladies and gentlemen, they have fractured us so exquisitely like surgery, fractured us cognitively.

02:47:52.762 --> 02:47:56.225
And now all they have to do is put the pressure in the right place and the thing will fall apart.

02:47:58.342 --> 02:48:00.384
And then they can do whatever they want in that chaos.

02:48:00.404 --> 02:48:01.966
They can reorganize the FDA.

02:48:02.006 --> 02:48:03.287
They can declare something this.

02:48:03.327 --> 02:48:04.529
They can declare something that.

02:48:04.549 --> 02:48:05.670
They can take away the guns.

02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:09.253
They can stage a false flag of this or a false flag of that.

02:48:09.294 --> 02:48:10.575
Maybe there's going to be a fake nuke.

02:48:10.615 --> 02:48:11.075
Who knows?

02:48:12.997 --> 02:48:20.025
As long as they have us this broken and this separated, then we're not going to be able to go across the street and say, what do you think about the news story?

02:48:21.493 --> 02:48:31.118
Because the new story will be fractured exactly the same as these, and there will be no stopping that from keeping us separated if it works the way they want it to work.

02:48:31.558 --> 02:48:38.061
We need to bridge this gap by bringing people to understand that we are both victims of the same operation.

02:48:38.121 --> 02:48:39.902
That's why it's so exquisite.

02:48:44.810 --> 02:48:46.191
But this still is real.

02:48:46.251 --> 02:48:47.973
They fooled us into solving their mysteries.

02:48:48.033 --> 02:48:50.675
And by doing so, we have accepted their monsters.

02:48:50.735 --> 02:48:52.356
That is the best way to see it.

02:48:52.797 --> 02:49:01.544
And they are doing it now with Ukraine and with Russia and with China and with climate and with gender and with transgender people.

02:49:01.945 --> 02:49:05.308
And they still need us to teach this to our children or it won't work.

02:49:06.709 --> 02:49:10.392
It's a long game and we've got to be vigilant for years to come.

02:49:12.406 --> 02:49:13.326
It's a long game.

02:49:13.386 --> 02:49:15.467
We've got a lot to teach our children to see.

02:49:15.827 --> 02:49:17.748
We've got a lot to teach our family to see.

02:49:18.088 --> 02:49:20.129
We've got a lot to teach our friends to see.

02:49:20.509 --> 02:49:24.970
But it can be done as long as you realize that in 2019, we were not here.

02:49:26.751 --> 02:49:30.832
None of this crazy biological dichotomy existed in 2019.

02:49:31.152 --> 02:49:40.015
But if you feel it in 2020, even the gender debate went full throttle, set to 11 at the start of the pandemic.

02:49:40.035 --> 02:49:41.876
That's remarkable if you see it now.

02:49:43.097 --> 02:49:50.145
but you gotta see it with enough time horizon, enough standing back from the wall so that you can see enough years.

02:49:51.406 --> 02:50:00.656
If you can't see many years at the same time and understand how these timelines line up in a criminal way, then you're never gonna see the illusion in how they put it down.

02:50:03.243 --> 02:50:08.610
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to spread ideas from this podcast, please start with this slide.

02:50:09.010 --> 02:50:13.976
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:50:14.377 --> 02:50:20.344
You could also read just the capital letters there and say it is likely that intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:50:21.129 --> 02:50:23.693
Transfection of healthy humans was always criminal.

02:50:23.773 --> 02:50:25.695
And I think all of these people have known that.

02:50:25.735 --> 02:50:31.043
That's why they've been in place to try and implicate that it's a new thing.

02:50:31.904 --> 02:50:33.306
And RNA cannot pandemic.

02:50:33.346 --> 02:50:36.611
This is an illusion that goes all the way back to

02:50:37.228 --> 02:50:46.714
before the Human Genome Project, and I think the Human Genome Project is essentially a fake it until you make it kind of thing, first declared in that Nature paper and still ongoing.

02:50:47.595 --> 02:50:49.476
The way out is biology, ladies and gentlemen.

02:50:49.496 --> 02:50:50.437
That's all I got to say.

02:50:50.477 --> 02:50:51.758
The way out is biology.

02:50:52.158 --> 02:50:56.101

Thank you very much for joining me.

02:51:02.765 --> 02:51:07.048
This has been Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:51:07.528 --> 02:51:08.629
I hope it was okay.

02:51:09.669 --> 02:51:13.250
And again, I will see you guys again tomorrow for Biology 101.

02:51:13.530 --> 02:51:18.792
I'm not sure if we're going to do a study hall or if I've got some reading that I'm ready to present, but we'll see.

02:51:19.172 --> 02:51:22.594
I'll be back here tomorrow, hopefully at 1010 and on time.

02:51:23.034 --> 02:51:23.594
Thanks very much.

02:51:23.614 --> 02:51:24.514
I'll see you again soon.

02:51:24.574 --> 02:51:25.795
Sorry for no music, Pam.

02:51:26.475 --> 02:51:28.496
Pamela, sorry for no music.

02:51:29.436 --> 02:51:30.597
Maybe I should play it anyway.

02:51:30.617 --> 02:51:32.417
I think I can cue it up over here.

02:51:32.497 --> 02:51:33.197
Thank you very much.

02:51:33.297 --> 02:51:33.918
See you guys again.

02:51:34.978 --> 02:51:35.359
Soon.

02:51:36.119 --> 02:51:36.540
Soon.

02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:37.981
Soon is coming.

02:51:38.321 --> 02:51:39.322
Soon we come back.

02:51:40.424 --> 02:51:41.585
Ah, soon we come back.

02:51:41.625 --> 02:51:43.026
What is the name of that song again?

02:51:43.206 --> 02:51:48.051
It is, uh... I don't remember what the name of that song is.

02:51:48.852 --> 02:51:51.614
If I don't know the name, I can't play it.

02:51:53.116 --> 02:51:57.020
It's called... I think it's called... This.

02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:05.961
That's the wrong button.

02:52:05.981 --> 02:52:08.502
No, that's not it.

02:52:08.942 --> 02:52:09.442
This one then.

02:52:12.024 --> 02:52:12.584
Is it that one?

02:52:16.506 --> 02:52:19.147
No, it's not that one.

02:52:19.227 --> 02:52:19.527
Shoot.

02:52:19.807 --> 02:52:20.928
Then I have to do it this way.

Thanks very much for joining me, guys.

02:52:26.851 --> 02:52:27.591
