Good evening everybody welcome to Giga Home Biological.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.380
You can find me at gigaombiological.com or Gigaome.cia.

00:51.380 --> 00:56.220
All of this stuff is on the same website.

00:56.220 --> 01:02.300
able to download the stream deck every Friday. It used to be free. It used to come by email.

01:02.300 --> 01:08.460
It's going to start again. The broadcast schedule is usually pretty up to date, although it's

01:08.460 --> 01:13.100
going to be hard for me to promise any given start time, although I will try very hard.

01:13.100 --> 01:19.020
At the email link, you can also find a voicemail that you can call in. Leave a question. I leave

01:19.020 --> 01:24.300
a comment. You can also subscribe there if you'd like to become part of this officially.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.940
Thanks very much, guys, for being here. Good to see all of you here again. And yeah,

01:31.740 --> 01:37.740

02:49.020 --> 02:54.020
his many, many pages on many, many people.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.100
Don't be afraid to do it.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.260
If you're bored, it's a great place.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.100
It's getting place.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.980
Sixteen minutes next.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.340
He's going on French, British, Italian,

03:03.340 --> 03:04.900
Japanese television.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.140
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.420
It's embarrassing.

03:10.420 --> 03:13.880
But not again.

03:40.420 --> 04:10.420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

04:40.420 --> 04:48.100
my ears in today so I won't have this too bad. No it's not a replay. I'm here. Whoa and I'm not

04:48.100 --> 05:00.580
pushing the buttons. Happy Friday Diva song. Happy Friday. Happy Friday it is indeed the faith

05:00.580 --> 05:06.020
in the novel virus is still there and the faith is still alive. We've got to get this message out

05:06.020 --> 05:11.780
ladies and gentlemen good to see you Idaho garden girl. I just saw a recent little documentary

05:11.780 --> 05:18.420
about how Idaho people don't want anymore. Idahoans that's pretty cute. I can imagine that that's

05:18.420 --> 05:30.980
the case. It feels like that in Pittsburgh too actually. Don't forget what these people are

05:30.980 --> 05:35.780
defending is this faith in a novel virus. This is what we've got to dispel over the holidays if we

05:35.780 --> 05:40.180
can for even one person. We've got to bring them to the light. We've got to get them out of the cave

05:40.180 --> 05:52.260
ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining me. Oh now see that every once in a while the timing

05:52.260 --> 05:58.820
is right. Every once in a while the timing is right. Good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome

05:58.820 --> 06:03.140
to the show. This is King of home biological high resistance low noise information brief brought

06:03.140 --> 06:08.500
to you by a biologist in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. It is the 24th of

06:08.500 --> 06:18.100
November 2023 and we are still battling against this this illusion of consensus about a dangerous

06:18.100 --> 06:23.860
novel virus. We are still battling this mystery we got tricked into solving about whether or not

06:23.860 --> 06:30.900
they were covering up a lab leak and who was responsible for it and this slow role of a narrative

06:30.900 --> 06:36.900
to make us believe that we actually figured out what happened and it indeed was a pandemic.

06:38.020 --> 06:44.740
This is the trick that they played on us. And not everybody was participating willingly.

06:45.380 --> 06:55.460
I went along with it for a very long time 2020. I was mostly bamboozled. 2021 still not quite there

06:55.460 --> 06:59.940
yet seeing the whole picture for what it was still thinking there was something to figure out.

07:01.860 --> 07:07.540
And so I participated as much as many others did. I just want to switch over to this really quick

07:07.540 --> 07:13.860
because I think it's an interesting thing to cut about. I didn't point out all the people yesterday

07:13.860 --> 07:19.220
because I wasn't so good at it. So I'm going to transform the picture now and try to point out

07:19.220 --> 07:25.060
some of these people that I think are really important. First of all the people that we have

07:25.140 --> 07:30.900
up on our diagram already Robert Malone, Nick Hudson, Brett Weinstein, and Denny Rancor.

07:31.860 --> 07:35.220
I don't think I need to explain to you why their colors are different because

07:35.940 --> 07:41.620
I have some suspicions that Brett Weinstein is an entirely on our team. I also have these

07:41.620 --> 07:46.900
sneaky suspicion that Robert Malone is an entirely on our team. Does that mean that they're bad guys?

07:46.900 --> 07:53.700
Not necessarily. It could just mean for any number of reasons they've chosen to work for the large

07:53.700 --> 08:01.380
weaponized piles of money that in reality control our societies. And we have to be pretty honest

08:01.380 --> 08:06.260
about it using pretty broad terms but we can, I think we can think about it this way, that there

08:06.260 --> 08:12.740
are weaponized piles of money, piles of money that are large enough so that they can effectively be

08:12.740 --> 08:21.220
used to control people, even set up a combination of different social media apps that can be used

08:21.220 --> 08:28.820
to control people. Even use those apps to amplify people artificially to make it seem like certain

08:28.820 --> 08:37.700
people are rising to the top and then use those people to limit the spectrum of debate, create a

08:37.700 --> 08:44.740
very lively debate within that spectrum and make sure that the real presuppositions that are being

08:44.740 --> 08:51.620
used to govern the people are never questioned. And so think very carefully about why it would be

08:51.620 --> 08:57.460
that Steven Hatfield would be standing right there in the middle of that old picture.

09:00.260 --> 09:02.900
What in the world is that guy doing there?

09:05.620 --> 09:13.060
Harvard professor Harvey Reich, not really much to say about the dangerous novel virus

09:13.060 --> 09:18.740
and millions of people died. The last time I talked to him, he said he had had his second case

09:18.740 --> 09:24.500
of COVID, I believe, and it was really, really bad despite the fact that he had had all the shots

09:24.500 --> 09:31.620
that he was supposed to have and was using hydroxychloroquine. And so basically everything that he thought he

09:31.620 --> 09:37.460
understood about whatever this is, apparently he doesn't understand it. But that's okay.

09:37.460 --> 09:50.260
There's Jill, Robert's wife, there's Meryl Nasse, long-time friend of the movement and

09:50.260 --> 10:01.220
a long-time activist on behalf of the older anthrax vaccines was when she first came on the scene

10:01.300 --> 10:06.580
speaking out against their deployment in the in the military.

10:09.380 --> 10:15.700
So it's a really, really curious photo, especially with this guy right there in the middle. He is a

10:15.700 --> 10:24.180
very strange fella. I don't exactly understand his role, but I can guarantee you that he is not

10:24.180 --> 10:30.420
just some property owner with a wood shop in his garage who would just as soon have everybody

10:30.420 --> 10:35.780
leave him alone so that he can make cabinets. I guarantee you that that's not the case.

10:36.500 --> 10:42.180
He is in Romania for a reason. I don't know what it is, but every one of these people is there

10:42.820 --> 10:49.540
for a reason. That's Byron Brittle, a very good guy, I believe. The guy that actually was breaking

10:49.540 --> 10:57.700
the the story of the distribution of the RNA or sorry, I apologize, the lipid nanoparticle

10:57.700 --> 11:03.540
from the Japanese data. And it was around that time, actually, that Robert Malone came out on

11:03.540 --> 11:09.460
Brett Weinstein's podcast. I don't know exactly the timing there, but about the same time they

11:09.460 --> 11:15.540
were burning Byron Brittle. I hope I'm not saying that wrong. I think it's Brittle, not Brittle. But

11:15.540 --> 11:21.780
anyway, that's when Robert Malone started to become prominent. So it's an interesting

11:22.580 --> 11:35.540
wall of people, especially in this social media space of Twitter, GAB, getter, telegram, signal,

11:36.260 --> 11:43.220
discord, locals. All of these people tend to kind of operate on that level, except for those

11:43.220 --> 11:49.700
that are more mainstream and can still do it on YouTube. And many, many, many of these people

11:49.780 --> 11:54.660
are capable of, you know, they have staff and whatever that are capable of number one,

11:55.860 --> 12:03.540
populating a channel of shorts, number two, populating multiple channels on multiple platforms.

12:04.500 --> 12:09.700
So there's a lot of things that these people all share in common with regard to how their message

12:09.700 --> 12:16.820
gets out there and how it is perceived to be amplified or censored and how they use that story

12:16.820 --> 12:21.140
to say that, you know, you have to pay attention to me. Most of the time you have to pay attention

12:21.140 --> 12:27.540
to them because they were censored and because they say they suffered so much from it. And if

12:27.540 --> 12:32.980
you look around this circle, you can actually see quite a few people whose whose primary shtick

12:32.980 --> 12:39.780
is that Stephen Kersch claims to be the number one misinformation spreader. Brett Weinstein

12:39.780 --> 12:44.660
claims to have lost over half of his family's income when his YouTube channel was demonetized

12:44.660 --> 12:51.460
because he put Robert Malone on who was is risking a whole lifetime career of of money and lives a

12:51.460 --> 12:59.380
very meager life on a horse farm. All of these people have the same sort of kind of story here. I

12:59.380 --> 13:07.620
mean, if you think about it, not necessarily all being censored, but all having some kind of reason

13:08.580 --> 13:14.260
to speak out. But then none of these people are are streaming from a garage that they rent.

13:17.060 --> 13:21.540
None of these people can claim to have been fired from a medical school because they spoke out

13:21.540 --> 13:27.540
against testing and they spoke out against taking temperature at the door and they spoke out against

13:27.540 --> 13:34.020
transfection. None of them can say that. There are people like that in the world. There are lots of

13:34.100 --> 13:40.180
people like that in the world that gave up their career. They burnt their they lost their lifelong

13:40.180 --> 13:47.700
business because they stood up for something. But for whatever reason, none of those people

13:47.700 --> 13:52.500
seem to have risen to the cream of the crop in terms of the the dissident narrative and in

13:52.500 --> 13:58.660
terms of the people that seem to get to travel from the United States to Romania and from the

13:58.740 --> 14:05.940
United States to Sweden and from the United States to Brussels, from the United States to Italy and

14:05.940 --> 14:14.740
from the United States to San Juan and from the mainland United States to Hawaii. I mean,

14:14.740 --> 14:21.620
this this same group of people plus or minus has been a lot of places over the last three years.

14:21.940 --> 14:29.860
And none of them are streaming from their garage. None of them have lost everything. None of them

14:29.860 --> 14:37.540
have. I mean, you can lose everything and not lose everything, right? And then you can lose

14:37.540 --> 14:43.540
everything. Like if you have Brett Weinstein says that he lost everything in 2017 despite the fact

14:43.540 --> 14:48.340
that he got a half a million dollar settlement. I'm not really sure that's being completely

14:49.300 --> 14:54.900
genuine. If if you say that you lost everything when your YouTube channel got demonetized, but

14:54.900 --> 15:00.740
you replaced it with a whole host of other income that got even better and you sold a book

15:01.700 --> 15:06.340
at the end, I mean, I don't know if you really lost everything

15:08.980 --> 15:14.020
or did getting your YouTube channel sell twice as many books as would have sold if you didn't get

15:14.260 --> 15:22.100
you know what I mean? I'm not really sure this math is being done as as genuinely as it could be.

15:24.260 --> 15:28.340
And again, it has to do with protecting this narrative. That's the bottom line. Anybody

15:28.340 --> 15:34.660
who's not explaining it at this point is being disingenuous, including the people who met

15:34.660 --> 15:41.140
Denny Rancor in person in Romania, then came back and still haven't tweeted that Denny Rancor's

15:41.140 --> 15:49.140
data shows that there's no spread. None of them have tweeted it. Robert Malone has very

15:49.140 --> 15:54.740
conspicuously tweeted twice at least and done one sub stack, which is just the transcript of

15:54.740 --> 16:04.340
Denny's talk and titled it 17 million people dead from the shot. So unless you read Denny's

16:04.340 --> 16:10.260
transcript, which I guess most people aren't going to do because Robert puts out so many

16:10.340 --> 16:18.020
sub stack articles, but unless you read it and you read that one line, you're actually not

16:18.020 --> 16:23.380
going to read it. It's not going to really hit you like it should hit you because he's got other

16:23.380 --> 16:28.900
papers, not just this one. That's about the shot, but he's got other papers that show that there's

16:28.900 --> 16:37.460
no evidence of spread across counties in America. And so that's just, I mean, you know, they talk

16:37.460 --> 16:42.740
to each other in person. They questioned each other. There's no doubt in my mind you've had,

16:42.740 --> 16:50.580
you've seen Denny on our on our stream. If he took a selfie with Jessica Rose and Jessica Rose

16:50.580 --> 16:57.300
saw his talk and she had any questions, he would have answered them. So she's aware that not only

16:57.940 --> 17:03.140
does it show that millions of people perhaps have been killed by the shot, but it definitely

17:03.140 --> 17:06.340
more importantly shows that there was no real evidence of spread.

17:08.980 --> 17:14.820
And that should that should be on everybody's top priority list. I know it's on a mixed priority

17:14.820 --> 17:23.940
list. He was there. But somehow the impression that was left on everybody at that place is not

17:23.940 --> 17:29.540
strong enough for any of those prominent people in that picture to have tweeted anything about

17:29.540 --> 17:37.780
there being no spread. Nobody did. And that should tell you all you need to know.

17:39.380 --> 17:44.580
So why was Denny there? Well, it's to me. I'm sorry, but it's the same reason why I've been

17:44.580 --> 17:49.300
invited to places, I'm afraid. It's to make you feel like you're making progress. It's make to

17:49.300 --> 17:57.300
make you feel like people are hearing you. If they flew Denny Rancor into the Senate

17:58.180 --> 18:04.580
or flew him into the parliament and and wherever it is in Canada, is it in Toronto? I don't know where it is.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.980
But they're not they flew him to Romania.

18:14.020 --> 18:18.500
I just don't I don't buy it. I don't think we're moving fast enough. I think we're being held back

18:18.500 --> 18:23.300
by the same mythology. I think we're being held back because this mythology is not being questioned.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.940
This illusion of consensus about a worst case scenario is not being questioned at all.

18:29.060 --> 18:33.780
And nobody wants us to. Nobody will is allowed to question it. Otherwise, everybody would be

18:33.780 --> 18:42.500
pouncing on this. It's very conspicuous that this is the border of the new world order. We are seeing

18:42.500 --> 18:49.700
the bricks. We just ran into the wall here. And if nothing progresses from this point on when

18:49.780 --> 18:55.540
they've all met him in person, when they've all seen his talk. And if all we're going to get out

18:55.540 --> 19:00.660
of Robert Malone is that wow, 15 million, I mean, 17 million people have been killed by the RNA.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.860
If that's all we're going to get out of it, we're not going to get a whole sub stack about how

19:05.860 --> 19:08.740
striking it is that there's no evidence of spread.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.780
That's pretty biologically striking. Is it not? Is that not remarkable?

19:19.700 --> 19:32.820
I mean, I would love it if if mathematicians and statisticians would ask Denny for the data

19:32.820 --> 19:38.180
and then go and verify it and people would put in the due diligence to prove him wrong.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.820
To find a different signal.

19:43.940 --> 19:47.860
You know, maybe we could put somebody on it. Maybe somebody like Steve Kirsch could put somebody

19:47.860 --> 19:52.260
on it. Pair him up with with Denny and make sure that we're not screwing this up. But you

19:52.260 --> 19:57.780
know, Denny's already publishing with a guy at Harvard. What more do you want? By the way,

19:57.780 --> 20:04.900
single strand or small interfering RNAs indeed double stranded. I can explain it a little bit

20:04.900 --> 20:12.660
now and I understand it a little bit better. But apparently, there is a protein complex that gets

20:13.300 --> 20:20.020
formed with small interfering RNAs that allows the double stranded RNA to unfold and one side

20:20.020 --> 20:26.820
stays in this complex and one side is then able to interact with complementary RNAs and

20:29.780 --> 20:35.860
that's how it gets down regulates the the RNA that it's so it is this it is the mechanism that I

20:35.860 --> 20:44.820
described but I was wrong and the lady did have the correct cartoon for the double stranded RNA

20:44.820 --> 20:51.780
as being the small inhibitory RNA. My bad. I never claimed to be a high level molecular

20:51.780 --> 20:56.820
biologist. I hope you realize that. I've taught myself all the molecular molecular biology I know

20:56.820 --> 21:01.860
and everything that I knew before the start of the pandemic was because I needed to do in a specific

21:01.940 --> 21:09.540
experiment and there's a fine line between announcement and warning and that's really

21:09.540 --> 21:12.820
something that I want you to think about a lot as we move forward in this card game.

21:15.540 --> 21:20.020
We have a lousy society. Our children have been taught all the wrong values and it's going to be

21:20.020 --> 21:25.140
okay that it all comes apart. It's not something that that's not a giga ohm biological message

21:25.300 --> 21:32.180
and anybody that tells you that it's okay if America falls apart is not being truthful.

21:33.060 --> 21:42.900
It's not okay and in fact that may be the only way that we can save the future for our children

21:42.900 --> 21:51.860
is to save what's left of the American republic and rebuild it. Not to allow chaos to develop

21:51.940 --> 21:56.180
not to allow a full societal breakdown which is not okay

21:58.740 --> 22:03.380
and yet there seems to be a message system happening right now on our side that says you

22:03.380 --> 22:07.460
know get your bug out bag ready make sure you're ready to load your car up and drive out of the

22:07.460 --> 22:11.060
city make sure you got enough guns for the zombie apocalypse.

22:14.660 --> 22:19.780
What if we just didn't have a zombie apocalypse? What if we just took over our school boards? What

22:19.780 --> 22:25.540
if we just made our neighborhoods the place that we want it to be? What if we just

22:26.740 --> 22:32.100
taught this biology to everybody in the United States or enough people in the United States so

22:32.100 --> 22:39.700
that we could avoid this calamity? Don't be lured into we're going to just let this happen.

22:39.700 --> 22:45.300
It's just that I think the public needs to be informed we need to be told the benefits versus

22:45.380 --> 22:50.500
the risk. We need to know what we're facing. Well the darker side of a polio vaccine and what

22:50.500 --> 22:55.780
nobody knows is that Jonas Salk has pointed out that in the last 10 years in this country

22:55.780 --> 23:00.980
two-thirds of all the cases of polio have been vaccinated. How many days is this on top and

23:02.020 --> 23:06.260
there's nothing I can do about this sound it's an extremely old video but what we're talking

23:06.260 --> 23:13.700
about here is 1985 on the Donahue show that's on television they're discussing whether or not

23:13.700 --> 23:16.020
people are being injured by the polio vaccine.

23:21.220 --> 23:27.060
Would you not interrupt me for a second? I know that doctors are used to interrupting patients

23:27.060 --> 23:39.700
but not another doctor. I think but let's get he does make a point that we should also say

23:39.700 --> 23:46.500
Sabin is live and the live vaccine in Salk is inactive as we say in the laboratory aren't

23:47.060 --> 23:54.260
how many was it they asked? Well how many people know that the European epidemic of polio there

23:54.260 --> 23:59.860
were about 20 or 30 cases in this country now of course the American doctors will argue that the

23:59.860 --> 24:08.340
reason why polio disappeared in this country was because of the vaccine but then why did it disappear

24:08.420 --> 24:15.220
in Europe in the 1940s and the 1950s without mass vaccination and I doesn't occur in the third world

24:15.220 --> 24:19.540
where only 10% of the people have never been immunized against polio or anything else. So in

24:19.540 --> 24:24.500
other words we may be fighting a tiger that died. That's quite correct. Ask the people in Great

24:24.500 --> 24:32.020
Britain. Ask the people in Japan who are all over. Back here. Gentlemen if you please I've got

24:32.100 --> 24:39.060
probably the smartest audience we've ever had. I have a question how long a delayed action

24:39.060 --> 24:41.620
if any would you connect this with like MS?

24:44.500 --> 24:50.740
MS a possibility. Would multiple sclerosis be one of the possible results? As a matter of fact

24:50.740 --> 24:55.540
there's a new publication that just came out from John Hoffman the closest associate of Tony

24:56.500 --> 25:03.780
that gives the references linking MS in later life to the early introduction of live virus

25:03.780 --> 25:10.020
vaccines like measles and like some of the others in the live viruses. Now at the present time

25:10.020 --> 25:18.260
I would recommend that anybody who has MS or amiotrophic lateral sclerosis or any of those

25:18.260 --> 25:23.940
degenerative neurologic conditions of later life carefully review their vaccine histories.

25:23.940 --> 25:28.820
I would also like to comment to that because in connection with my case I've been doing some

25:28.820 --> 25:32.900
research. Let me tell them once again Ms. Gundy that you're a Guillain-Barre victim

25:33.700 --> 25:38.580
contracted following the following year receipt of the swine flu vaccination.

25:38.580 --> 25:43.540
Yes and I am in the process of writing a book about my experience and in the process I've done

25:43.540 --> 25:49.220
considerable research and from what I have learned it looks as if immunizations frequently caught

25:49.220 --> 25:54.740
out of immune diseases not only on the race syndrome but lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,

25:54.740 --> 25:58.580
multiple sclerosis and other types of things. Now I have no data at this point.

25:58.580 --> 26:03.540
We should also say that there's a good deal of evidence suggesting that multiple sclerosis may

26:03.540 --> 26:08.660
be the result of a distemper in an animal that the victim received during childhood.

26:10.180 --> 26:15.460
None of this is absolutely nailed to the wall but that's the problem with this. How's

26:15.460 --> 26:21.540
what's a mother to do with all of these balls in the air and nobody really certain.

26:21.540 --> 26:27.540
I would just like to also comment that we had 46 million people vaccinated at the swine flu shot

26:27.540 --> 26:32.020
and I have written to Ralph Nader's organization. I have written to some of the other organizations

26:32.020 --> 26:38.260
claim to get them to do a survey, a long-going survey to see if these vaccinations do cause

26:38.260 --> 26:42.980
all the immune diseases or not the reactions are. I can't even get a response because I'm not a

26:42.980 --> 26:47.060
doctor. I have no clout. I'm a nobody. Mrs. Graham, why were you shaking your head?

26:47.060 --> 26:51.460
Well, it is known with that vaccine. It's a law vaccine. They are not interested in the

26:51.460 --> 26:55.940
adverse reactions. As a matter of fact, if I may, I'd like to invite anyone to write to me if they'd

26:55.940 --> 26:59.700
have an adverse reaction. I'd like to help the government because they don't want to know but

26:59.700 --> 27:04.020
I would like to know. I am a mother of three children and I have been informed and I've read

27:04.020 --> 27:08.980
up on these things and I chose not to vaccinate my children but when they get to school, why is

27:09.060 --> 27:12.660
it that I have to fight for my rights as a mother and a choice I can make?

27:12.660 --> 27:17.140
Just quickly, we're along but that's a very important question. Here are the states

27:18.260 --> 27:25.060
in which you either have the totally free decision about whether or not to vaccinate or there's,

27:25.060 --> 27:30.180
we're calling them loophole states, states where they're not going to send your child to

27:30.820 --> 27:37.860
solitary if you don't have a scar. All right, California, not all children must be immunized

27:37.860 --> 27:42.340
in these states. Some require religious reasons. Some places there is a bureaucratic

27:42.340 --> 27:48.580
find this Colorado, Toronto, Vermont, Washington. You see that this is Phil Donahue in 1985. What

27:48.580 --> 27:57.380
happens one year later? The vaccine act is passed and the discussion is ended and you will never

27:57.380 --> 28:04.260
have a state or federal court case about it because again, the vaccine act established this thing

28:04.260 --> 28:09.700
where there's a court with a special master that's not even really a court.

28:13.620 --> 28:19.380
And the crazy thing is my new friend Ralph Hazelhurst is actually one of the guys whose kid is in the

28:19.380 --> 28:27.300
one of the original autism omnibus cases is one of the lawyers at CHD

28:27.700 --> 28:38.180
been fighting for years. Just running around in circles with these people saying that nobody's

28:38.180 --> 28:42.420
ever been injured. Nobody gets injured. The people that have been injured have been compensated.

28:44.180 --> 28:51.860
We've got nothing to complain about. There's nothing to see here. 1985

28:52.180 --> 29:01.220
All you college kids out there who are too young to know, too young to be aware of this,

29:01.220 --> 29:08.500
you have to understand that this history is there. It's still barely findable, but it's there.

29:10.740 --> 29:14.180
And this is the history you need to understand. This is where it started.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.780
It hasn't always been this way.

29:20.420 --> 29:25.300
People didn't always lie. America wasn't always about fake until you make it.

29:27.220 --> 29:36.260
America actually used to be about being honest and working hard to get where you needed to go

29:37.460 --> 29:40.260
to achieve your goals if that's the way you want to phrase it.

29:40.740 --> 29:46.420
We need to get back there, ladies and gentlemen, and don't let them tell you that we can't.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.180
Don't let them tell you that we can't.

29:53.060 --> 30:02.980
Even in the process of trying to remember how it used to be, we will improve ourselves infinitely.

30:04.820 --> 30:09.700
If we let these people keep leading us by our nose, we're going to be stuck in this trap forever.

30:10.820 --> 30:21.460
Anyone who fortunately took the vaccine is a much higher risk for blood clots.

30:22.260 --> 30:28.740
So there's over the counter substance called enacetylcysteine, or NAC.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.700
And it's a powerful substance that prevents blood clots,

30:34.660 --> 30:37.700
inhibited sulfide bonds, whatever, but it prevents blood clots.

30:38.900 --> 30:42.900
It's also it makes glutathione, which is a very powerful antioxidant.

30:43.540 --> 30:49.460
And when human cells are attacked, they get what's called oxidative stress.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.780
So it's like an extra layer of protection against assault.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.540
So that's for people that have been vaccinated or at high risk for the blood clots.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.420
Then I recommend a zinc ionophore.

31:02.980 --> 31:07.460
In other words, if you get enough zinc into your cell, you'll be protected from single-stranded RNA

31:07.460 --> 31:10.100
viruses. What are single-stranded RNA viruses?

31:10.740 --> 31:16.740
All the strains of COVID, I'm going to say to you, call the strains of COVID.

31:16.740 --> 31:20.660
I don't care which variant is, all variants are treated the same way by me.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.140
It also inhibits influenza virus.

31:25.140 --> 31:31.300
I'm sure the pharmaceutical industry is very happy that I'm

31:33.140 --> 31:38.180
basically disseminating information that the flu shot is no longer

31:39.540 --> 31:43.060
really necessary at best. It works around 38% a year.

31:43.060 --> 31:49.060
And even with the flu shot from 2015 to 2020, each year we had 40 million cases

31:49.060 --> 31:52.740
of the flu in America and around 40,000 dead, half of which were kids.

31:53.700 --> 31:58.020
So the influenza shot and the treatment approaches that we have aren't very good.

31:59.220 --> 31:59.940
No, they're not.

31:59.940 --> 32:01.060
That's trusted zinc.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.180
Yeah, but you need to get zinc in the right place, but you need a zinc ionophore.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.460
And those are the over-the-counter options.

32:10.340 --> 32:15.620
You have a corsetin, q-u-e-r-c-e-t-i-n,

32:16.180 --> 32:20.180
so biflavinoid derivative of onions and apple peels.

32:22.580 --> 32:23.620
Go to the counter.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.820
And then there's another one called EGCG, which is even more powerful.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.540
EGCG is a green tea extract.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.660
The point is there's peer-reviewed papers on the NIH that all document

32:34.660 --> 32:37.620
that these substances are very powerful zinc ionophores.

32:38.660 --> 32:39.700
Then obviously you need zinc.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.260
Vitamin D3 is absolutely essential.

32:45.220 --> 32:47.700
And you should have levels between 15 and 70.

32:48.420 --> 32:54.980
Because all the data shows, every few papers that people have high normal levels of vitamin D,

32:55.940 --> 32:59.460
they're virtually assured not to get admitted in the intensive care use.

32:59.460 --> 33:04.340
Otherwise your immune response is upregulated, it's very robust,

33:04.340 --> 33:09.620
and it protects you and helps you overcome any infection or most infections.

33:10.340 --> 33:15.860
And vitamin C. Vitamin C is an important cofactor in many processes.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.980
It's a three-year immune system.

33:17.700 --> 33:22.820
And so those substances, which are all available over the counter,

33:23.700 --> 33:28.340
they're affordable, should be within grasp of every single entity.

33:31.460 --> 33:38.020
And so of course we know how that message was elevated and how quickly that went viral

33:38.020 --> 33:42.580
on the internet and how quickly everybody around the world had high respect for

33:43.460 --> 33:49.940
Dr. Zebzalenko and his insight into how all single-stranded RNA viruses could potentially be

33:50.820 --> 33:51.860
fortified against.

33:52.740 --> 33:56.820
I know that we saw this on the front page of most magazines and newspapers,

33:57.620 --> 33:59.140
and some even had a fold out.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.420
Now in a real world, in a real good world, in a real,

34:05.220 --> 34:09.780
if that really is what was necessary, and that was really the answer,

34:09.780 --> 34:13.780
because it was an RNA virus spreading around the world, that knowledge

34:15.700 --> 34:17.300
should have gone somewhere, but it didn't.

34:18.180 --> 34:19.540
Maybe it got where it needed to go.

34:22.820 --> 34:26.020
But I'll tell you what got where it needed to go actually.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.380
I think we're in the middle of it.

34:27.380 --> 34:34.260
Excuse me, is you can find this on Ube Alshner's

34:35.540 --> 34:40.740
substack and on his Twitter.

34:42.340 --> 34:49.540
There was a second corona supposium put on by the alternative for Germany party.

34:50.260 --> 34:55.620
And if you're not familiar with the AFD, that is the party that Christine

34:56.580 --> 35:01.220
Anderson is a part of, a quite prominent spokesman,

35:01.220 --> 35:07.620
a spokeswoman in the European Parliament and a very outspoken person about certain things

35:07.620 --> 35:11.700
with regard to the pandemic and lockdowns and this kind of thing.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.820
It was a five hour or so symposium.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.500
The link is here.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.340
I can probably, I think we're in the middle of it.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.100
I can probably give that to you.

35:22.180 --> 35:27.700
I'm going to go back here and maybe I have it, maybe I have it here.

35:29.460 --> 35:33.060
So this, this movie is pretty long,

35:35.140 --> 35:40.020
but you can grab that link and then it's at three hours and 28 minutes that Michael

35:40.020 --> 35:41.060
Yeden has mentioned.

35:41.780 --> 35:45.300
And so I'm going to play this video first so I can kind of remind you of the kind of

35:45.300 --> 35:46.900
things that Michael Yeden says.

35:46.900 --> 35:51.460
And then hopefully I'm just queuing you up right now, 86 people in the chat.

35:51.460 --> 35:57.220
If anybody speaks German, go get your Q-tips and clean your ears or go get your earbuds

35:57.220 --> 36:01.860
and put them on because after this, I'm going to play a couple clips from that,

36:02.820 --> 36:07.540
that section where I think we can glean some information about what was said

36:08.260 --> 36:12.340
with regard to Mike and then what was said at the edit.

36:13.780 --> 36:17.860
And Sukhred Bhakti actually says something that I've included in here and I hope we can

36:17.860 --> 36:18.660
watch it together.

36:19.140 --> 36:20.340
And then I'm going to go to bed.

36:20.820 --> 36:23.460
So let's listen, see if we can get this to go.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.860
I think we're in the middle of an ongoing crime.

36:27.860 --> 36:29.860
I've no idea how long it's going to last.

36:29.860 --> 36:34.740
I think it's, I'm convinced that it will be the biggest crime in history.

36:34.740 --> 36:39.460
It's global, it has the intent of control, removing everybody's freedom.

36:39.460 --> 36:44.020
And I personally think we'll involve killing further millions, if not billions of people.

36:44.020 --> 36:48.020
That makes it a pretty big competitor for the title, World's Crime and History.

36:48.020 --> 36:49.300
It is long plans.

36:49.940 --> 36:54.340
I went boy with the details, but I've definitely come across information that shows that the

36:54.340 --> 37:02.100
components of the deceit that they've used, PCR, exaggerated PCR testing, the use of fear-based

37:02.100 --> 37:07.780
messaging through the media, this stuff's been rehearsed by militaries and the people we might

37:07.780 --> 37:12.180
think of as the spooks for at least 25 years and possibly longer.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.340
So it's long plan, very serious.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.580
Here's the thing why I'm calling you to arm.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.700
It's not going to return to the old normal.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.380
One, that's never their intention.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.220
So it's not going to happen passively because it's not, there isn't an actual

37:25.220 --> 37:26.500
phenomenon that's going to wear off.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.820
They're not going to allow it to return to normal.

37:28.820 --> 37:35.220
So if you comply with this tyranny, it will end with the loss of your liberty and probably your

37:35.220 --> 37:41.380
life. The supply chains that move materials, raw materials and finished goods around the world

37:41.460 --> 37:44.100
are being sawn through on a global scale.

37:44.100 --> 37:47.540
You only got to look at where the shipping is, where it should be and where it actually is.

37:48.020 --> 37:54.500
And, terrifyingly, the same is happening to food production, worldwide food and fertiliser production.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.460
It's in the wrong place.

37:55.460 --> 37:56.180
It's deliberate.

37:56.180 --> 38:02.420
They're smashing the means of manufacturing enough calories to keep 7.8 billion people alive.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.220
And, you know, where do you think that's going to end?

38:05.220 --> 38:11.060
Well, the answer is mass starvation or a global migration.

38:11.060 --> 38:16.420
That's what's going to happen if you and everybody else choose to do nothing at all.

38:17.540 --> 38:20.740
Also, economic instruction, we can see happening around us.

38:20.740 --> 38:26.260
Interest rates will rise on the back of huge debts that will just cause mass bankruptcies,

38:26.260 --> 38:29.700
rolling, recessions, depressions, things like that.

38:29.700 --> 38:34.340
And I would also imagine loss of confidence in the very thing called money.

38:34.340 --> 38:37.460
So any savings you've got, I think they'll just vanish.

38:37.460 --> 38:40.180
Literally, people will just say, I no longer trust sterling.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.540
I don't want to accept it.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.860
And so all your savings are worth nothing.

38:43.860 --> 38:46.420
So if you wait, I believe it will be too late.

38:46.420 --> 38:51.380
I think you already know that I'm broadly telling you something that's closer to the

38:51.380 --> 38:53.380
reality than what government's telling me.

38:53.380 --> 39:00.020
But I believe that we can head off the worst crimes in history by actively withdrawing our

39:00.020 --> 39:06.500
consent and definitely not accepting these digital ID for any reason, any reason.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.060
If you accept it, they will sweep over us.

39:10.020 --> 39:13.860
And so just in the last few words, I implore you to get involved,

39:13.860 --> 39:18.100
to use some of what I and others are saying to you, be brave actually.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.180
You have to be brave now and risk embarrassment.

39:21.300 --> 39:26.500
So let's presume that he basically said the same thing at this thing, right?

39:26.500 --> 39:27.540
We can presume that.

39:28.500 --> 39:33.620
So the first thing that I will point out is that this guy got introduced.

39:34.100 --> 39:37.540
I'm going to put the video forward in a second because the clip is too long.

39:37.540 --> 39:38.260
There's a suit.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.540
Can you see my arrow?

39:39.540 --> 39:41.220
Succard Bockty sitting right here.

39:42.420 --> 39:47.540
And this guy is speaking, who I think is Dr. Hawkert's here that's listed.

39:48.500 --> 39:52.260
And then right here, it says DY, but that's actually Michael Eden.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.180
And you can see it here.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.780
It says Dr. Mike Eden.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.340
So this is Dr. Mike Eden, DY.

39:58.340 --> 40:00.660
So he's waiting on zoom and he's going to speak.

40:00.740 --> 40:05.300
But when we go forward to this three minutes here, and then we watch it from here,

40:05.300 --> 40:06.820
I'm going to search from the beginning.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.380
See, so he's going to introduce him Dr. Michael Eden,

40:15.380 --> 40:18.500
is to show us how it is.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.900
There's a secret to Professor Hawkert.

40:23.260 --> 40:46.000
I'll start now where he's going to come from from this

40:46.000 --> 40:47.420
good keeps going.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.940
And then there's a cut last month prescription.

40:51.940 --> 40:58.900
international and interdisciplinary and now some other people are speaking. So there was no

40:58.900 --> 41:09.860
my own and so now I'm gonna go back again and I'm gonna try and find more. I just wanted to make

41:09.860 --> 41:35.940
sure that he was actually saying it, but he is, we've confirmed it multiple ways. So this is not

41:35.940 --> 41:41.380
my work. This is actually Uve's work. So don't don't think that I've done this. This is a German

41:41.380 --> 41:47.860
friend of mine. Long story about how he met, but he's one of the real freedom fighters over there.

41:47.860 --> 41:56.900
And yeah, it's he's become a very fast friend of mine. And so this has really worried me a lot.

41:57.620 --> 42:03.060
I'm really happy that he brought it to my attention. I think everybody that has any

42:03.060 --> 42:10.260
possibility of acting on behalf of this, because think about this. I want you to see it very

42:10.260 --> 42:20.180
carefully. Christine Anderson's party put on a corona symposium at which Michael Yeadon spoke

42:20.180 --> 42:27.300
and then their archive of it doesn't have the Michael Yeadon speech in it. That would be like

42:27.300 --> 42:36.100
Donald Trump's party. Donald Trump throws a coronavirus party and then everybody that speaks

42:36.100 --> 42:43.860
and then you know, I don't know who do you want it to be? Michael Yeadon speaks and they edited it out.

42:46.500 --> 42:53.780
Would that be okay with you? If Donald Trump did that, would it be okay with you in the Netherlands?

42:53.780 --> 43:00.420
If Wilders did that, the Netherlands just elected a guy who thinks that Gaza should be a parking lot.

43:01.860 --> 43:08.420
The Netherlands just elected a guy who is ultra right, but also totally in photographs with

43:09.060 --> 43:11.300
WEF people and with Bill Gates.

43:11.300 --> 43:25.220
It is absolutely shocking that the skilled TV watchers are lemming themselves off the cliff

43:25.220 --> 43:31.940
right now and we must wake them up because their the state is not playing around anymore.

43:31.940 --> 43:34.580
Germany's not even faking it. They're not even pretending.

43:34.980 --> 43:41.060
Their own right-wing parties are controlled.

43:44.900 --> 43:50.500
I'm going to have Uve on my show in the next week or so and we're going to talk all about Germany

43:50.500 --> 43:54.500
and about well, we need to talk about a lot of things.

43:59.060 --> 44:03.700
But this is unacceptable, but this is where we are. Germany is not playing.

44:04.820 --> 44:09.460
But what's strange about it is is that remember that Sucred Bakhti was also under threat of

44:10.340 --> 44:13.220
jail or something. He was accused of trees and I thought.

44:15.460 --> 44:20.420
But now here he is at this far right party, far right party in Germany.

44:23.060 --> 44:28.340
Did you know that there was a real far right party in Germany that the German government tried to ban?

44:29.220 --> 44:32.420
And then the Supreme Court of Germany said no, we're not going to ban it.

44:32.500 --> 44:36.660
Well, why aren't you going to ban it? Well, because you already have it infiltrated to the highest levels.

44:38.580 --> 44:44.820
So why would we ban a party that's actually run by the government? That's in court documents in Germany.

44:46.180 --> 44:51.780
Here we are a decade later and they seem to more or less be doing it the same way but with more sophistication.

44:54.420 --> 44:58.980
But think about how important it is that they threw a party for the dissidents.

44:58.980 --> 45:05.060
They had five hours of lectures and of all the lectures that they decided to edit out. Let's not have mics in there.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.700
Wouldn't want mics in there.

45:11.620 --> 45:14.580
Where he likely said what he said in that previous video.

45:16.340 --> 45:21.060
Which is as Tony said in the chat, it's pretty big downer when he's so bang on the money.

45:24.260 --> 45:26.900
Because withdrawing our consent is a big move.

45:27.860 --> 45:31.940
And the first few people who do it are going to feel really alone.

45:34.740 --> 45:36.340
Maybe for a really long time.

45:38.420 --> 45:41.540
But we've got to do it, ladies and gentlemen. I think we've got to start doing it.

45:41.540 --> 45:44.180
We've got to find ways for us to start doing it.

45:47.620 --> 45:50.980
So listen, what does he say here?

45:56.900 --> 45:57.700
Yeah.

46:01.620 --> 46:07.060
It's, it's hard, decent, tight, spontan, fuhoiter,

46:08.020 --> 46:09.780
eing about it for four guests then.

46:11.940 --> 46:21.140
That's why I can't understand German. But I swear he just said that this was not planned.

46:21.140 --> 46:25.700
I swear he said it.

46:27.780 --> 46:30.580
Did he not say it? Did anybody hear it?

46:32.100 --> 46:37.140
He said that it's not planned. He said it was a spontaneous something something, but it was not planned.

46:37.140 --> 46:37.780
It's planned.

46:46.340 --> 46:46.740
Hurry up.

46:46.740 --> 46:47.540
Would you hear it?

46:48.260 --> 46:48.660
Listen.

46:52.260 --> 46:56.740
It's hard, decent, tight, spontan, fuhoiter,

46:57.620 --> 46:59.380
eing about it for four guests then.

47:01.540 --> 47:02.900
That's why I can't understand.

47:02.900 --> 47:03.540
Did you hear it?

47:03.940 --> 47:07.140
This one needs to be planned.

47:07.140 --> 47:16.980
And I understand that Dutch and German are not the same language, so I could be a retard,

47:16.980 --> 47:20.100
but I'm telling you, I'm sorry, Jackie, I could be an idiot.

47:21.300 --> 47:26.260
But this sure sounds like he's saying this was spontaneous, this was not planned.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.620
It's not done yet.

47:32.660 --> 47:39.780
It's hard, decent, tight, spontan, fuhoiter, eing about it for four guests then.

47:41.940 --> 47:43.140
The sponger needs to be planned.

47:46.340 --> 47:51.220
So they probably took him out because he said that and probably

47:52.180 --> 47:53.700
the secret doesn't mind.

47:57.540 --> 48:01.700
The guy who oh my gosh, I can't even believe I I want to say this,

48:02.500 --> 48:04.500
but do you see what I where we're going here?

48:04.500 --> 48:06.180
Do you see how scary it is?

48:06.740 --> 48:08.580
Who's going to say it if I don't say it?

48:10.260 --> 48:13.620
Who else is going to dare look at this and just add this up?

48:17.300 --> 48:18.820
Who's going to do it?

48:18.820 --> 48:22.100
I'm dividing everybody now, secret's a hero.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.220
Yes, secret is a hero, absolutely.

48:31.460 --> 48:34.340
But why don't we put it all the way to the goal line?

48:35.780 --> 48:38.740
Does he really believe that this wasn't planned?

48:41.460 --> 48:42.660
I guess it's possible.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.820
I guess it's possible that it wasn't planned.

48:49.060 --> 49:00.660
But then why does it hurt to have that idea out there?

49:03.620 --> 49:12.740
Wouldn't a spontaneous disaster be different from a planned event

49:13.460 --> 49:16.900
and stand the scrutiny that a planned event wouldn't?

49:19.060 --> 49:24.180
Are we so afraid of a narrative that's untrue that we can't talk about it?

49:26.740 --> 49:29.620
I thought that's what we were fighting about for the first two years.

49:33.380 --> 49:35.060
It's not like he's just nobody.

49:36.420 --> 49:37.300
He's Mike Eden.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
He's been speaking out as long as anyone.

49:41.860 --> 49:44.180
I find this to be a problem.

49:45.220 --> 49:46.660
I don't know who the problem is.

49:46.740 --> 49:49.140
It could be that the party is the problem.

49:49.140 --> 49:52.340
And we don't even know the name of the people who decided to take that out.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.620
Maybe Sukhid Bhakti complained.

49:55.620 --> 49:56.500
Maybe he was mad.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.180
Maybe he was never even consulted.

49:58.180 --> 49:59.940
And once he finds out, he'll say something.

49:59.940 --> 50:03.140
I don't know, but I hope that's for sure.

50:04.900 --> 50:09.220
Because if this just fizzles out into the wind and nobody says anything to anyone

50:09.220 --> 50:13.460
and nobody asks Christine Anderson, what the hell's going on with the AFD party?

50:16.660 --> 50:20.260
Wouldn't this be a wonderful time for Christine Anderson to come forward and say,

50:20.260 --> 50:25.220
hey, somebody in my party took down Mike Eden's video.

50:26.740 --> 50:30.900
All Mike Eden says is that they're going to do digital ID and digital currencies in

50:30.900 --> 50:31.940
order to control us.

50:32.980 --> 50:35.380
Is Christine Anderson afraid to say that?

50:37.620 --> 50:41.460
Because if she's worried about our freedom, she should be a hell of a lot more worried about that

50:41.460 --> 50:42.500
than the WHO.

50:42.500 --> 50:47.060
Holy balls.

50:47.060 --> 50:50.500
This is some serious, serious stuff here, ladies and gentlemen.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.340
This is absolutely serious.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.740
Red alert, serious.

50:54.740 --> 50:55.940
I don't have that one anywhere.

50:56.900 --> 50:57.860
I need a red alert.

51:01.060 --> 51:04.900
Whole ladies and gentlemen, this train pulling and pushing exercise has been going

51:04.900 --> 51:06.180
along for a while.

51:06.180 --> 51:10.420
And they fooled us because they all did it together in coordinated action.

51:10.420 --> 51:14.340
They pretended that they were doing something useful to augment a natural

51:14.340 --> 51:17.380
phenomenon, a conflated background signal.

51:17.380 --> 51:21.540
They all participated in this theater at some point, wittingly or unwittingly.

51:21.540 --> 51:23.460
And now they're still participating in it.

51:25.300 --> 51:30.180
Making these stories last longer and longer and people keep asking this question when they

51:30.180 --> 51:32.420
should be asking, is there evidence of spread?

51:37.460 --> 51:39.220
Is this evidence of spread?

51:40.020 --> 51:42.100
Is this evidence of a novel virus?

51:44.180 --> 51:46.580
It's not because the math isn't done.

51:46.580 --> 51:50.260
You've got to subtract all the people that you didn't resuscitate because you were afraid to

51:50.260 --> 51:52.660
bring them into the hospital in New York City.

51:52.660 --> 51:55.460
You got to separate all the subtract all the people that you've

51:55.460 --> 51:58.340
ventilated with extra pressure so that the virus wouldn't get out.

52:00.980 --> 52:07.220
You got to all the people that you sent back to old folks homes without antibiotics and steroids.

52:08.020 --> 52:13.940
All the people that you put on Remdesivir in the hospitals over 2020 and 2021 and 2022.

52:13.940 --> 52:19.940
And oh my gosh, can you believe it's still 2023 and almost 2024.

52:19.940 --> 52:24.100
Hopioi deaths, ladies and gentlemen, are just continuing to rise.

52:24.100 --> 52:25.380
Nobody cares.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.780
And the accounting is really great, right?

52:29.780 --> 52:36.020
Because the death certificate fraud is wide and crazy and there is a financial reason to do it.

52:37.940 --> 52:44.340
They lied to us about this with a consensus and the consensus still exists.

52:45.380 --> 52:46.740
It's not gone.

52:46.740 --> 52:47.620
It's there.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.300
It was there in Romania.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.940
In that picture, the consensus was there.

52:51.940 --> 52:53.380
That there was a novel virus.

52:53.380 --> 52:58.660
Even if there was a new star of the show named Denny Rancor,

52:58.660 --> 53:04.980
the faith in the novel virus escaped Romania unscathed, unchallenged.

53:08.020 --> 53:13.700
And that faith is a lie because that has to be a conflated background signal.

53:13.700 --> 53:14.500
It has to be.

53:15.220 --> 53:23.140
It is the only possible biological explanation that does not involve further human intervention

53:23.140 --> 53:27.220
and malfeasance on top of a conflated background signal.

53:30.260 --> 53:36.100
In other words, I am also certain that if you subtract whatever man-made nonsense

53:36.260 --> 53:38.820
was added to that conflated background signal,

53:38.820 --> 53:41.700
the conflated background signal is still pretty dominant.

53:46.180 --> 53:51.380
I think they're doing this because they need to invert our children's sovereignty to permission

53:51.380 --> 53:55.140
so that they can start to require that all of their data is collected.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.140
They don't need everybody.

53:57.140 --> 54:00.020
They just need most of us and they don't need us.

54:00.020 --> 54:01.140
They need our children.

54:01.140 --> 54:01.940
We're too old.

54:03.460 --> 54:05.220
They need our DNA from the start.

54:05.220 --> 54:06.980
They need our medical data from the start.

54:06.980 --> 54:08.340
The more they can get, the better.

54:09.860 --> 54:12.660
Who knows where they're going to store it or how they're going to store it long enough

54:12.660 --> 54:14.180
until they can feed it into their AI.

54:14.180 --> 54:16.340
But I'm sure they got lots of plans on how to do it.

54:16.340 --> 54:16.740
It's great.

54:16.740 --> 54:18.580
It's probably just an infrastructure problem.

54:20.100 --> 54:23.940
Please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group

54:23.940 --> 54:25.140
by any means necessary.

54:25.140 --> 54:27.940
Share Mr. Sparkles videos wherever you find them.

54:28.580 --> 54:30.980
The more you know, the better will be.

54:31.860 --> 54:35.300
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

54:35.300 --> 54:38.100
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

54:38.100 --> 54:45.140
Transfection in healthy animals is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned in tegrities.

54:48.100 --> 54:51.300
I am going to sound like a broken record with regard to these statements,

54:51.300 --> 54:54.820
ladies and gentlemen, because these are the core message of giga-ol biological

54:54.820 --> 54:58.500
a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

54:59.060 --> 55:03.060
Thank you very much for joining me and I will see you again tomorrow because

55:03.060 --> 55:06.660
tomorrow is another day and we do it every day here at Gigo and Biological.

55:07.460 --> 55:13.140
The independent bright web, the interdisciplinary bright web, the invisible bright web.

55:13.140 --> 55:21.940
We're here now and add some people every week and every month and until we have something

55:21.940 --> 55:31.060
that encounter the governance mythology and its various means of deployment.

55:32.260 --> 55:36.340
The mythology is being deployed and we have to work against it.

55:36.340 --> 55:38.420
That's what the independent bright web is going to be.

55:39.460 --> 55:40.420
Maybe it'll catch on.

55:40.420 --> 55:40.820
I don't know.

55:42.180 --> 55:42.900
I hope it does.

55:44.660 --> 55:45.700
See you guys again tomorrow.

55:46.340 --> 55:51.780
Have a good night.

56:22.820 --> 56:25.940
Thanks ladies and gentlemen again.

56:25.940 --> 56:29.060
I will see you tomorrow as Streak will stay alive.

56:29.060 --> 56:30.180
I can promise you that.

56:30.180 --> 56:34.100
I feel great and thank you very much for joining me.
