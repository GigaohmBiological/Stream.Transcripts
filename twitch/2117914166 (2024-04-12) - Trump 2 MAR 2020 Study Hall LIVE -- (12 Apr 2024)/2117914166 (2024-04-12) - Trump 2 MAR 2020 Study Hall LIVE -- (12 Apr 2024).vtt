00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

00:45.680 --> 00:50.840
Hello Daniel, I don't know I think you're first I don't see anybody else

00:52.280 --> 00:56.600
Zardoz you would be second. I don't see anyone else who's first

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
Maybe it's a tie

01:03.320 --> 01:08.840
But from my side it looks like Daniel made it in so Daniel's gonna win the the cash award

01:08.840 --> 01:14.080
You got to send in your email and mailing address in the cash will come in the mail Daniel. Congratulations

01:21.000 --> 01:25.600
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're feeling with essentially a worst case scenario

01:25.600 --> 01:29.880
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case

01:40.560 --> 01:45.200
And I have no idea how to say that but I do think that means something like howdy in

01:46.400 --> 01:48.400
Irish or something or Welsh

01:49.160 --> 01:55.320
I mean, I apologize. I don't know what it says, but I am assuming it means something like let's go get him or

01:56.440 --> 02:02.920
Maybe good afternoon. I don't know anyway. I'm appreciating everyone who's here. Welcome to the show. I

02:04.400 --> 02:10.260
Think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more than society

02:10.520 --> 02:14.800
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

02:18.160 --> 02:22.420
This episode is sponsored by Mointe that's move plus point

02:26.480 --> 02:33.240
This my point is that if if we were able to just like we're trying to get everybody to take the vaccine

02:33.240 --> 02:39.400
If we had put that into getting everybody to take I've imagined in fluvoxamine for for a month

02:39.720 --> 02:45.000
If we and if we could accomplish that then COVID would be wiped out we could do it and actually

02:45.000 --> 02:56.880
You can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

02:58.160 --> 03:03.120
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar

03:03.120 --> 03:08.480
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
You

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
This is so crazy

04:56.040 --> 05:01.760
Well, here we are again, I'm finally putting in putting in some time I

05:03.960 --> 05:10.920
Apologize for the absence this week and it's a complicated situation at home right now trying to make ends meet and

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
It is not without

05:15.480 --> 05:21.000
Where we're all very grateful for the people that are supporting the stream is sharing our work, but

05:22.160 --> 05:27.680
The reality of it is that I also have to do other things that I do have to scramble around for other money

05:27.680 --> 05:29.680
And I'm lucky enough actually

05:29.880 --> 05:33.040
I'm lucky enough actually and make you make sure you hear that

05:34.160 --> 05:36.160
I'm lucky enough to have other ways

05:36.560 --> 05:42.960
and and another source of income in the form of consulting work and that comes and goes and

05:43.440 --> 05:49.000
Lucky enough this week it a little bit more showed up at the door today, and so I could

05:49.760 --> 05:53.760
This week and so I could make a little extra money on the side and maybe

05:54.600 --> 05:55.760
April's

05:55.760 --> 06:03.040
Rent is almost paid, but don't get me wrong. I still have so much so much gratitude for all the people on this list

06:04.000 --> 06:05.560
and

06:05.560 --> 06:10.160
You know my family and I are just yeah, we'll be eternally grateful for all of these people

06:10.160 --> 06:13.440
I mean people like Greg James and Christian Ormond and

06:14.080 --> 06:16.080
Jane Martin and

06:16.160 --> 06:18.160
You know Jeff from earth

06:19.280 --> 06:25.200
Steph and Cone these are people that have been coming through for years now often on sometimes

06:25.600 --> 06:29.360
Consistently for years sometimes here and there with huge donations

06:30.000 --> 06:36.280
And what do I consider a huge donation? I'm sorry, but anybody that gives more than a hundred dollars to anybody on the internet

06:36.880 --> 06:38.320
has

06:38.320 --> 06:44.480
grossly exceeded the amount of money that I've donated to people over time and I've been the

06:46.000 --> 06:49.840
Humble recipient of a lot of support of that kind of

06:50.720 --> 06:52.720
input and so

06:54.000 --> 07:00.360
When you get more than that then it's really pretty shocking and the independent bright web is not hasn't become glamorous yet

07:00.880 --> 07:04.160
And I don't even know if there are any other members of the

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
About you know

07:08.320 --> 07:11.040
This illusion is sustained only through your active participation

07:11.040 --> 07:16.080
So I think what I need to realize and we all need to realize we all got to do our part

07:16.080 --> 07:20.480
and maybe my part is this maybe my part is being here and

07:21.920 --> 07:27.520
You know for whatever little bit of this is this is one more fire burning in the distance that other people can see

07:28.480 --> 07:31.600
And so again, I'm just really grateful for having me

07:33.920 --> 07:35.760
The circumstances where I can do it

07:35.840 --> 07:41.040
So you've gotten a long way since we made this logo lots of long ways since I thought wow

07:41.760 --> 07:43.760
Patch clampers need a clothing line

07:44.480 --> 07:46.480
We'll call it gig ome biological

07:47.600 --> 07:55.520
And then it turned out to be a symbol that I would use for a stream where I was trying to teach biology on the internet because biology isn't available on tv

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
Because biology isn't available on youtube

07:59.840 --> 08:04.720
And one of the safest ways to get biology in your head nowadays is actually gig ome biological

08:04.720 --> 08:06.720
It's actually pretty crazy

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
and

08:09.040 --> 08:12.240
It's the 12th of april 2020 for and I am still

08:13.040 --> 08:14.880
grinding I really thought that

08:14.880 --> 08:19.200
Somewhere in 2021 one of my streams would have a breakthrough it'd go viral

08:19.760 --> 08:24.400
and then this you know this conscious and intelligent manipulation of our

08:25.360 --> 08:30.720
Habits and opinions would become obvious to everyone and that the way that we were fooled by

08:31.280 --> 08:35.520
Being sent to home and told to watch television and read facebook

08:36.000 --> 08:38.560
We were fooled into trying to solve this mystery

08:39.200 --> 08:42.240
And in solving that mystery, of course, we completely

08:42.800 --> 08:47.600
Fumbled the ball uninformed consent for ourselves for our children for the kids that went off to

08:48.160 --> 08:51.520
To college in 2020 in 2021

08:52.000 --> 08:57.760
We just didn't protect each other in our families and and it was because of this incredible

08:58.560 --> 09:00.560
incredible

09:00.560 --> 09:02.160
agreement

09:02.160 --> 09:06.480
that that this this curve here early in in

09:08.160 --> 09:10.240
Early in march represented something

09:10.880 --> 09:16.880
Like a novel virus that that all these people that were dying in new york city could be extrapolated across the united states

09:16.880 --> 09:19.760
And we can expect that to happen everywhere. I hope we can see my arrow

09:20.640 --> 09:21.920
um

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
And so it's uh, it's a real

09:25.120 --> 09:30.480
It's a real important thing to keep in mind but our hypothesis is which is that a who declared a pandemic of a

09:30.560 --> 09:38.080
Dangerous novel virus that was detectable by a nonspecific PCR test for RNA viruses applied to a low prevalence population

09:38.560 --> 09:40.720
So that means a high percentage of false positives

09:41.120 --> 09:47.040
With and correlated with poor and detrimental health protocols through financial incentives to follow orders from above

09:47.440 --> 09:53.360
And of course this had a lot to do with okay. Is there a deadly virus or not? They told us there is so we better protect ourselves

09:53.840 --> 09:58.880
Um, does pulse ox matter for this apparently it does so when we measure it and we find it low

09:58.880 --> 10:04.720
Maybe we should give them oxygen. Maybe we should try to stop spread by ventilating people these kinds of ideas

10:05.360 --> 10:10.640
Were what were financially incentivized early on and maybe only in a few places where they

10:11.200 --> 10:14.240
completely taken to the full extent and and

10:14.720 --> 10:19.680
Hundreds or thousands of people were killed by these protocols in a very short period of time

10:19.680 --> 10:24.720
But that short period of time which occurred primarily in new york city and a few other places

10:25.680 --> 10:31.600
Was sufficient for organizations like sage and and bureaucracies like the cdc

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
And the nih to claim that this was evidence of appending appending doom

10:36.400 --> 10:38.800
And so this at the same time because of these

10:39.200 --> 10:46.960
Haysp nonspecific PCR test allowed a conversion of a larger percentage of all cause mortality than just

10:47.600 --> 10:54.240
pneumonia and influenza to be prioritized as a national security threat because pneumonia and influenza is this blue

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
Thing down here

10:56.560 --> 11:00.960
And so in order to get this to explode what they essentially had to do was get us to treat

11:01.680 --> 11:08.800
Pea and I treat what we would have normally called pneumonia and influenza without even really caring about how it was detected

11:09.520 --> 11:14.080
They they tricked doctors around the united states and around the world to treat

11:14.640 --> 11:20.720
What was already a well treatable source of all cause mortality completely differently

11:21.440 --> 11:27.360
And by changing the way that we we treated these people let me throw some let me throw some some lines up here

11:27.920 --> 11:33.600
The way that we changed by treating these people this way was which we ended up increasing all cause mortality

11:33.600 --> 11:39.040
And that's why you see here in this graph that the light blue region which represents mortality to

11:39.600 --> 11:44.800
pneumonia skyrocketed during the pandemic because we started treating pneumonia incorrectly

11:46.160 --> 11:49.920
On the advice of the cdc the nih and each other organizations

11:50.480 --> 11:58.000
It is possible that an niaid funded infectious clone of a coronavirus may or may not have involved in the initial biological incidents

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
But in RNA molecule cannot sustain a pandemic

12:02.240 --> 12:06.720
The goal is a total surrender of individual sovereignty and enforcement of a global inversion

12:07.040 --> 12:10.160
From basic human rights to basic granted permissions

12:10.640 --> 12:15.600
I don't think this is a very big deal anymore to say this in the in a general context

12:15.600 --> 12:19.920
But I do think it's a very big deal to say it in the context of the pandemic

12:21.040 --> 12:23.760
And we are saying that they want to invert

12:24.480 --> 12:30.080
Our sovereignty to permissions and they are used they have orchestrated the pandemic to do it

12:30.400 --> 12:35.920
Is is about the best way to say it now mRNAs involved and genetic testing is involved

12:36.480 --> 12:44.560
And that's all what this inversion of from sovereignty to permissions is about because if you don't have sovereignty over your body then the data

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
Is it yours either?

12:48.560 --> 12:54.240
Your genetic sequence is in yours your medical data is in yours, especially if the state is providing your health care

12:54.320 --> 12:56.000
How can it possibly be yours?

12:56.000 --> 13:01.360
And in fact, that's one of the disadvantages of the american system is that a lot of these databases are privatized

13:02.160 --> 13:05.520
And so unlike china and unlike some of these more socialized

13:06.080 --> 13:12.080
Places like israel or sweden or norway or or or the uk

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
We don't have this possibility of

13:16.000 --> 13:18.320
Nefariously or or behind the scenes

13:18.880 --> 13:22.560
a massing a database that could be used eventually to

13:23.680 --> 13:28.400
achieve or or attempt to achieve some of these transgenic goals we've been talking about

13:28.960 --> 13:33.360
And so america was behind the ball at the start of the pandemic and the pandemic was going to be

13:34.080 --> 13:37.920
I think america's way of catching up to some of these systems that they have

13:38.400 --> 13:44.000
Led themselves to believe are very much ahead of us because of their ability to collect data and amass a database

13:44.400 --> 13:49.360
Of useful data for an ai to eventually start to understand how the human genome really works

13:52.960 --> 13:55.840
And so if you start to be able to see the very big picture of course

13:56.400 --> 13:58.560
understanding how the human genome works and how

13:59.760 --> 14:03.520
whatever human biology is in the end how to penetrate that

14:04.080 --> 14:10.960
irreducible complexity to get rid of the sacred aspects of biology has been a goal since the late 50s

14:11.680 --> 14:13.680
probably much earlier

14:14.640 --> 14:16.640
Once it was understood that

14:16.640 --> 14:17.760
that

14:17.760 --> 14:21.760
Biology as it existed was essentially an appreciation for the sacred

14:22.240 --> 14:26.480
And it had admiration for what we can't understand and for what little parts of it

14:26.480 --> 14:31.120
We can't understand it needed to be inverted and so for many decades

14:31.760 --> 14:37.680
Biology went from being what I think was a more appreciation of the natural world to a sort of

14:39.040 --> 14:41.040
An abomination of it or or or a

14:42.560 --> 14:44.800
Desecration of it was the right word I was looking for

14:45.760 --> 14:50.560
And so they they've essentially convinced biologists like me when I was still in academia

14:51.040 --> 14:55.440
Not to think about our work as having any sacred aspects of it even though I understood that

14:55.920 --> 14:58.400
like animal ethics and and and and

14:59.280 --> 15:04.240
Experimental ethics had something to do with the sacredness of the animal subjects that we were using

15:04.640 --> 15:11.520
It never really got to me the way it gets to me now in retrospect being outside of the system and outside of that field

15:11.920 --> 15:17.040
And so for me like many other people it has to be an awakening that takes many years

15:17.520 --> 15:24.000
And so it took me a long time to see that I was involved in this scooby-doo that I didn't get it for a very long time

15:24.160 --> 15:26.160
I didn't have this hypothesis

15:26.960 --> 15:35.040
All of it as as sorted as it is now at some point in may or or june or july of 2020. I was pretty close

15:36.000 --> 15:39.680
but the idea that that that there would be uh

15:41.120 --> 15:43.840
a way a molecular explanation

15:45.200 --> 15:49.520
For all of rna virology basically being an exaggeration

15:50.080 --> 15:55.680
That part of it was lost on me in 2020 and in fact it was lost on me because of the

15:55.760 --> 15:59.120
what I see now as a pretty amazing

16:01.360 --> 16:06.480
No virus position which was so boldly presented and

16:07.920 --> 16:12.800
Somehow curated in a way that it made it very unattractive to people like me who were trying to

16:13.440 --> 16:15.440
question what we thought we knew but

16:16.320 --> 16:18.480
Still cling to something that we thought we did

16:19.520 --> 16:21.520
and so in a way

16:21.520 --> 16:22.880
um

16:22.880 --> 16:28.640
They played different roles at different times and I don't know who's doing what I just know for sure that there was a many

16:28.640 --> 16:31.120
There were many times in my own involvement of this

16:31.920 --> 16:37.600
Evolution of this hypothesis where I felt like there was about to be a unity moment where everybody was going to realize

16:37.600 --> 16:39.680
Oh my gosh. They lied to us

16:39.680 --> 16:45.680
And every time we got to the point where I thought there was going to be this thing where people got together and said

16:45.680 --> 16:47.920
You know what we disagree about some of this biology

16:48.320 --> 16:51.440
But the bottom line is we agree that those people lied to us

16:52.240 --> 16:54.000
And then it didn't happen

16:54.000 --> 16:57.520
and then for some reason or another personal attacks got in the way or

16:58.080 --> 17:01.280
Or somebody didn't show up or somebody wrote a sub stack

17:01.360 --> 17:08.880
They shouldn't have or somebody backed out because the the rules of engagement were in agreement upon after several email exchanges

17:10.880 --> 17:13.200
And these dramas I think were all orchestrated

17:14.400 --> 17:19.760
I think a lot of these dramas were performed by both sides of a drama

17:20.240 --> 17:23.840
To make the people that were that thought that they were participating in that drama

17:24.400 --> 17:28.320
Feel like something happened when in reality they had nothing to do with what happened

17:29.040 --> 17:33.840
These people had already agreed to be opponents in this limited spectrum of debate

17:34.240 --> 17:38.320
And to include you and make you feel like you were participating in it

17:38.320 --> 17:41.840
But in reality, they already knew where it was going to go and where it was going to land

17:42.880 --> 17:48.000
And that's why several times during the course of the pandemic. I felt like I was making progress with people

17:48.480 --> 17:52.640
But then it suddenly they decided that I was a absolute nutcase

17:54.480 --> 18:00.480
I would go from having the respect of someone to being called crazy and it's happened several times in the last four years

18:01.360 --> 18:08.320
All the while slowly but surely moving toward this conclusion that so much can be explained by lying

18:09.280 --> 18:15.600
That it's it's unnecessary for there to be a spreading novel gain a function pathogen

18:15.600 --> 18:23.040
And then it just happens to be the Denny Rancor and several other people have I've not really been able to identify the signal of such

18:28.320 --> 18:35.920
It's absolutely impossible that the pandemic was just a biological phenomenon that governments around the world were responding to it's absolutely impossible

18:37.040 --> 18:41.200
Even if the theater was so convincing for so many years that we actually fell for it

18:41.440 --> 18:47.040
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga on biological high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist that should say

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
Oh, yeah, it does say the 12th

18:49.920 --> 18:56.160
April 2024. I am a human just like you. I have a mama and a papa and

18:57.120 --> 19:01.440
Yeah, biology is the way out. So don't think that we've escaped. It's just started

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
Today

19:04.400 --> 19:09.040
Today on Giga on biological we're going to look at a video. Did I change it?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.400
I don't think I changed it. I'm gonna have to change it right now. Sorry about that

19:12.880 --> 19:16.800
I mean, it's gonna say american frontline doctors 2020. We're gonna save that for later

19:17.520 --> 19:20.640
um, we're actually going to do a

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
Donald Trump

19:26.800 --> 19:30.640
Uh second of march 2020 is what we're gonna do

19:31.360 --> 19:33.360
and so that

19:33.360 --> 19:37.120
Means that when we do this and I hit resume slideshow

19:37.200 --> 19:40.160
It's gonna play the music again, which I think is from tic-tac-dope

19:43.120 --> 19:45.120
And that should have had a

19:45.280 --> 19:49.840
I don't know why that didn't flies that there right now already and then donald will come in

19:52.320 --> 19:58.640
Okay, so I screwed up the animation when I edited that I apologize. I'm not very good at editing my slides on the fly

19:58.720 --> 20:01.680
Anyway, Donald Trump second of our march 2020

20:02.320 --> 20:06.880
Um without further ado here we go. I think this is going to be a really fun video

20:06.960 --> 20:12.000
Remember what we're watching here is history and if we roll down we will actually see

20:12.880 --> 20:17.680
That there are 18 subscribers to this channel only 5,000 people have seen it

20:17.760 --> 20:19.600
He loaded it up

20:19.600 --> 20:26.560
Four years ago and the only well the most recent common is mine. Inovio is Malone. Hi, he's so deep state

20:26.880 --> 20:28.880
I don't know why I wrote that anyway

20:28.880 --> 20:36.480
Um, here we go. This is called Inovio CEO Dr. Kim discusses coronavirus vaccine with president trump and vice president

20:36.480 --> 20:38.560
10 second of march 2020

20:38.560 --> 20:44.640
It's actually a 56 minute long video. So I I suspect we're gonna hear a lot of cool stuff

20:44.800 --> 20:48.400
Um, I might put it slightly faster although

20:50.800 --> 20:54.000
It's two o'clock. I've got enough time. Hopefully I won't interrupt too much

20:59.360 --> 21:01.840
Biotechnology companies the biggest in the world

21:02.960 --> 21:05.280
Most prestigious the ones that get down to

21:06.160 --> 21:12.880
The bottom line very quickly to discuss how the federal government can accelerate the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments

21:13.760 --> 21:16.720
For the coronavirus. We want to welcome

21:17.360 --> 21:19.360
Dr. Deborah Burke

21:19.360 --> 21:21.360
And dr. Burke has been

21:21.440 --> 21:27.280
To the White House a lot over her career and she's now going to be here working with Mike Pence and everybody

21:28.160 --> 21:32.320
Full-time and we appreciate it. We appreciate it very much Dr. Brooks

21:32.960 --> 21:33.840
and

21:33.840 --> 21:36.480
A real expert in her field and if you'd like you could

21:36.960 --> 21:39.600
Ask her a couple of questions when we're finished. We work to

21:40.800 --> 21:45.440
We're working very hard to expedite the longer process of developing a vaccine

21:46.080 --> 21:48.800
We're also moving with maximum speed to develop

21:49.680 --> 21:56.160
Therapies so that we can help people we cover as quickly as possible. We have a lot of recovery going on

21:56.800 --> 21:58.960
We want to see if we can advance that

21:59.600 --> 22:04.240
It's likely that therapies will be available before a vaccine is actually ready and we'll

22:04.880 --> 22:10.320
Seek to bring all effective treatments to mark and as soon as possible some very good work has been done on the vaccine

22:10.320 --> 22:15.120
However, they have some good progress and you'll be able to ask a couple of questions of the folks here

22:15.840 --> 22:20.880
We're also working with congress to ensure that america has what it needs to respond to this challenge

22:21.440 --> 22:24.560
Great challenge, but everybody's responding very well

22:25.280 --> 22:31.600
Since the start of the outbreak my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to protect our citizens and losing

22:32.080 --> 22:36.480
Including closing our borders very early a lot earlier than people wanted us to do

22:37.120 --> 22:39.440
And that turned out to be a good decision. I ordered

22:40.080 --> 22:46.320
Sweeping travel restrictions increased travel advisory levels established screening measures and opposed historic

22:47.120 --> 22:49.120
Quarantines

22:49.120 --> 22:51.120
Quarantines all over the country a lot of

22:51.840 --> 22:57.120
The corona virus shows the importance of bringing manufacturing back to america

22:57.200 --> 23:04.960
So that we are producing at home the medicines and equipment and everything else that we need to protect the public's health

23:05.680 --> 23:09.920
And i've been talking about this for a long time that process has already started it started

23:10.640 --> 23:12.640
Long before we ever knew about this

23:13.840 --> 23:17.840
So that's pretty funny because I know that a lot of the supplies of

23:18.560 --> 23:22.960
PCR testing at least around the world in different places came from china

23:23.840 --> 23:25.840
lateral flow tests from china pcr

23:26.720 --> 23:28.720
reactions from china

23:28.720 --> 23:34.560
I've been looking into one particular testing company on the west coast that used a company known as

23:35.520 --> 23:36.800
BGI

23:36.800 --> 23:39.200
And I think actually jikki is done jikki leaks

23:39.760 --> 23:44.240
The mouse guy on twitter has done a lot of work on bgi and how their tests were terrible

23:44.640 --> 23:50.000
And how many tests they distributed and if you look that company up, I think it's Beijing genetic something something

23:50.560 --> 23:54.640
Um, they are partners of the human genome project already from a couple decades ago

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
So I think we're going to find as we move forward

24:03.280 --> 24:07.120
All we got to do is just keep track of what we find and keep

24:07.520 --> 24:10.720
Putting things on the bulletin board and eventually all this stuff will keep

24:10.720 --> 24:15.600
I mean, it's all still lining up, right? If I tell you that one of the biggest distributors of

24:16.480 --> 24:18.480
EUA tests in

24:18.640 --> 24:24.000
In the united states was a chinese company that was partnered with the human genome project already in

24:24.560 --> 24:25.680
2006

24:25.680 --> 24:29.760
Then that's when you look at the timeline and things line up like wow, that's weird

24:32.400 --> 24:35.360
And so just just realize that's what we're really working with here

24:35.440 --> 24:39.920
That's what's going to continue to happen as we look back if we are vigilant and we are

24:40.400 --> 24:41.920
We do the work

24:41.920 --> 24:44.720
Um, and that's what it's going to be is just doing this work

24:45.280 --> 24:47.680
Um, we are going to find it. We are going to see it

24:47.760 --> 24:50.320
It's going to become more and more obvious because again

24:50.880 --> 24:53.200
Unless they start erasing this kind of history

24:53.600 --> 25:00.080
It's still available right now and it it becomes a starker and starker contrast to what we know now

25:00.640 --> 25:03.920
As we move forward and as long as we don't let it get out of

25:04.480 --> 25:08.160
Get away from us. We can still bring other people to still see it

25:08.960 --> 25:10.720
Right if we're

25:10.720 --> 25:16.000
We have a lot of work to do between now and the election and whatever is going to stir up in everybody's head

25:16.400 --> 25:18.640
When that happens because that's going to be one of these

25:19.200 --> 25:25.120
You know high density information times that that makes it seem like a lot more time has passed

25:25.200 --> 25:30.960
And if you have one of those scenarios again, what ends up happening is is that 2020

25:31.440 --> 25:34.240
Cognitively feels like a longer time ago

25:34.240 --> 25:37.200
It becomes more and more work to get back to it

25:37.200 --> 25:40.560
And even if we have this kind of internet assistance

25:40.560 --> 25:44.800
It's still going to be a lot of cognitive work for people to roll back there

25:45.120 --> 25:47.920
They're thinking all the way this far. That's the whole

25:48.800 --> 25:50.240
Awfulness of social media

25:50.240 --> 25:54.000
So we've got a lot of work to do right now while we still everybody's attention

25:54.400 --> 25:58.720
And people are still trying to figure out still walking around a little bit days

25:58.800 --> 26:01.760
We have we have the chance right now. So I think this is a really

26:02.400 --> 26:05.040
great video great great place to start

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
Make certain things at home

26:07.760 --> 26:10.800
We want to be doing our manufacturing at home

26:10.880 --> 26:15.520
That's not only done in giant it's done in many other places including Ireland and

26:16.320 --> 26:18.320
A lot of places make our different

26:19.040 --> 26:22.480
drugs and things that we need so badly and it's not good to be

26:24.320 --> 26:27.520
Dealing with one or two or three countries and we do very little at home

26:27.520 --> 26:31.680
And we're going to start doing it at home and we've been talking about that for a long time

26:32.080 --> 26:36.560
And a lot of the drug companies because of what we've done in terms of incentives and taxes

26:37.040 --> 26:39.040
They're heading back here anyway

26:39.600 --> 26:46.000
The coronavirus shows the importance of bringing all of that manufacturing back to america and we will have that

26:46.640 --> 26:49.840
Started it's already started frankly. It started about a year ago

26:50.720 --> 26:58.000
The white house coronavirus task force led by vice president Mike Pence has been meeting daily and coordinating closely with the state

26:58.480 --> 27:01.920
And local governments Mike had a call today with 53 governors

27:02.880 --> 27:07.680
And I heard it was a very good call and everybody's very well coordinated

27:08.400 --> 27:11.920
And the governors and the states all of them. I can't think of an exception

27:11.920 --> 27:17.200
They've been really working closely with us. It's been it's been a very good very good relationship

27:18.240 --> 27:24.240
We will confront this challenge together and we will continue to do exactly what we're doing

27:24.960 --> 27:27.360
And we're going to be very successful

27:28.640 --> 27:33.280
A lot of things are happening a lot of very exciting things are happening and they're happening very rapidly

27:33.760 --> 27:35.760
So with that, I'd like to introduce

27:35.760 --> 27:39.840
Mike and you can say a little bit as to your calls and some of the things that are happening today

27:40.320 --> 27:42.320
Well, thank you, mr. President and

27:42.320 --> 27:43.360
the

27:43.360 --> 27:46.560
White house corona task force. We'll be meeting again this afternoon

27:47.360 --> 27:52.240
But as you mentioned earlier today your direction we host I think we should assume that

27:52.720 --> 27:57.520
Mike pence's loyalty is not to donald trump in this scenario. I don't have any

27:58.160 --> 28:01.280
Idea whether donald trump is totally in or not

28:02.080 --> 28:08.480
My assumption is that he would like to be in my assumption is that he has the same desire that his dad did to be included in this

28:08.960 --> 28:13.760
Higher society that was in new york city at that time, which is really what we're talking about here still

28:14.160 --> 28:18.160
We're talking about the governing elite. I think donald trump would like to be a member of it

28:18.160 --> 28:19.680
Is he already a member or not?

28:19.680 --> 28:21.520
That's the real only question

28:21.520 --> 28:25.280
That anyone should really be asking if they're trying to penetrate this illusion

28:25.760 --> 28:33.680
And I don't think that in this scenario at this time even if donald trump isn't at this time still kind of outside of

28:34.240 --> 28:36.240
out of their control

28:36.240 --> 28:38.240
Mike pence is not

28:38.560 --> 28:43.440
And so putting mike pence in charge of the response to the pandemic is actually

28:44.160 --> 28:47.600
Quite alarming and it was quite alarming to me already in

28:48.480 --> 28:54.560
2020, but it wasn't really clear to me why but this this is why because I don't think this guy

28:55.280 --> 28:57.280
um

28:59.760 --> 29:01.760
I mean you want to believe it right that he's a

29:02.560 --> 29:04.080
He

29:04.080 --> 29:08.640
Reminds us that he is a christian whenever he can and I want to believe it with all of my heart

29:09.360 --> 29:11.360
um

29:12.320 --> 29:17.280
But you know you you have to go by people's actions and so um he's been in too long

29:17.760 --> 29:19.920
That's really what I think he's been in too long

29:20.800 --> 29:21.920
so

29:21.920 --> 29:25.600
Anyway and telephone conference call with 53 governors

29:26.640 --> 29:30.640
As the president said many times we're all in this together and today's meeting

29:32.240 --> 29:38.560
Is a reflection of back that this president understands that industry is a part of the one team in america that's going to

29:39.360 --> 29:41.840
address the coronavirus in this country

29:41.840 --> 29:47.280
I'm grateful for these leaders of the nation's top pharmaceutical companies come in to speak to us about

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
the development of vaccines

29:49.840 --> 29:51.840
but also the development of therapeutic

29:52.480 --> 29:54.480
medications that

29:55.040 --> 29:59.200
Can be available in the short term and we're grateful for your participation

29:59.840 --> 30:04.240
The president will also be traveling tomorrow to the national institute of health

30:04.800 --> 30:06.640
cdc before the week is out

30:07.440 --> 30:12.720
And we will be meeting with leaders of the airline industry will be meeting with with leaders of

30:13.360 --> 30:15.360
the cruise line industry

30:15.600 --> 30:17.600
And we welcome the partnership

30:17.600 --> 30:23.440
With industry in this country as very is same mark work out the president's top priority mark is the guy who gave me this

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
Video to watch so thanks mark

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
And let me also mr. President

30:28.480 --> 30:31.440
extend my welcome to dr. Deborah barris

30:32.240 --> 30:33.440
one of the

30:33.440 --> 30:37.680
One of the leading experts in infectious diseases in the world

30:38.160 --> 30:43.040
She has served in the uniform of the united states. She has served in multiple administrations and

30:44.000 --> 30:47.280
She's going to be our right arm here as we implement

30:48.160 --> 30:50.160
your vision for

30:50.160 --> 30:54.080
Putting the health and safety and well the of the american people first

30:54.560 --> 30:57.600
So with that mr. President, I know secretary

30:57.600 --> 31:02.800
I do think that bergs is worth considering as one of the major players at least at this time

31:03.520 --> 31:09.440
um, she was given an extraordinary amount of power and I do think that she is a ladder climber and

31:10.400 --> 31:15.520
Someone that one way or another. I don't know if her history includes places where she's been pinched before

31:16.240 --> 31:19.360
Or places where fraud was uncovered or anything like that

31:19.360 --> 31:24.320
But I do know that he she moved up the ranks basically working on hib

31:24.400 --> 31:28.400
Which should be not by now for anybody watching this show an extreme red flag

31:29.040 --> 31:33.040
In terms of people moving up the bureaucracy of the united states government

31:33.600 --> 31:37.280
um and in this case, this is definitely one of the acolytes of all the

31:38.000 --> 31:39.520
of all the

31:39.520 --> 31:46.400
About she himself. So, um, it's a really cool thing to see that in march of 2020. We are still pretending

31:47.040 --> 31:54.000
Um, like she's just being added to the team. They've selected her. Donald trump is about to say her name incorrectly

31:54.000 --> 31:55.440
It's really kind of fun.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.440
These are has a few thoughts and

31:59.200 --> 32:04.880
Alex, maybe you can give a little update and then we'll go around the room and people can introduce themselves if that's okay

32:05.520 --> 32:07.520
Thank you, mr. President, mr. Vice president

32:08.160 --> 32:14.560
So, uh, we continue to see cases here in the united states. Uh, as you know, we tragically have experienced uh, several more deaths

32:15.120 --> 32:20.480
Reporting today. I think this is the guy who declares the health emergency, right? This is the hhs secretary

32:20.560 --> 32:25.680
So this is the dude who actually pulls the fire alarm that puts the prep act in action

32:26.160 --> 32:29.600
Allows euase to be granted and tells everybody it's time to go

32:29.920 --> 32:30.720
day

32:30.720 --> 32:33.440
Uh, and our condolences go out to their families of course

32:33.760 --> 32:37.360
Um, that's why the president's leading this whole of government response

32:37.440 --> 32:42.160
Let me just go back quick to see if I can see what i was on his thing secretary. He's our

32:43.440 --> 32:46.880
Department of health and human services. Yes, that's correct. I knew it vice president

32:47.520 --> 32:54.400
Uh, so, uh, we continue to see cases here in the united states. Uh, as you know, we tragically have experienced uh, several more deaths

32:54.640 --> 32:58.880
Tragically says, uh, and our condolences go out to their families, of course

32:59.360 --> 33:04.720
Uh, that's why the president's leading this whole of government response at the direction of the vice president

33:05.520 --> 33:09.680
We're here working with the pharmaceutical company leaders on three key issues

33:10.480 --> 33:16.480
How do we speed vaccines? How do we speed therapeutics and one of the supply chain challenges that we may be facing

33:16.880 --> 33:19.120
For pharmaceutical products here in the united states

33:19.680 --> 33:26.080
With regard to with regard to therapeutics and vaccines. We want to know how we can not get in their way, but rather speed

33:26.480 --> 33:28.560
That development process along

33:28.560 --> 33:32.800
I want to make sure that they all know that we've got commissioner han here from the fda

33:32.880 --> 33:37.840
And this is all in the context of emergency powers emergency use authorizations

33:37.840 --> 33:42.960
There we go. The president will be asking you how can we make it faster? How can we make anything faster?

33:42.960 --> 33:46.080
How can we challenge some of those normal pharma timelines

33:46.880 --> 33:48.880
That can be a little slow and bureaucratic

33:49.280 --> 33:54.160
What could we do to speed that along given the nature of this emergency and be a good partner?

33:54.720 --> 33:55.920
with you

33:55.920 --> 34:02.000
And making that happen, especially once we get the emergency supplemental passed by congress in the next week or so

34:02.800 --> 34:08.160
So with that said mr. Thank you very much and supplemental is moving along very rapidly

34:09.280 --> 34:13.920
Everyone what I assume that's money is to get that done moving more quickly

34:14.480 --> 34:16.000
Emma please

34:16.000 --> 34:19.360
Emma warms leave from black so smith going first of all i'd like to

34:20.160 --> 34:25.040
Really say how much we welcome the leadership mr. President of this task force nich and vada

34:25.520 --> 34:31.200
And recognize the very substantial efforts that have already been made by the administration to protect people here in the us

34:32.000 --> 34:36.640
As a science led company with a very large including manufacturing presence here

34:36.640 --> 34:39.600
We know we have a responsibility and a vital role to play

34:40.080 --> 34:44.400
And our priority is to make sure we make available as part of this one team

34:45.120 --> 34:48.000
our pandemic adjuvant technology available to

34:48.880 --> 34:55.040
Any company with a high highly promising vaccine because this new technology could

34:55.680 --> 34:56.960
make

34:56.960 --> 35:04.800
These other vaccines either this new technology could with a high highly available to part of this one team

35:05.520 --> 35:08.400
our pandemic adjuvant technology available to

35:09.200 --> 35:15.440
Any company with a high highly promising vaccine because this new technology could

35:16.000 --> 35:21.280
Make these other vaccines either bring more efficacy or indeed

35:23.200 --> 35:26.800
Allow them to be antigen sparing, which means we could protect more people

35:27.120 --> 35:31.440
Which is obviously incredibly important as we're trying to work a pace and a scale

35:31.520 --> 35:38.320
We've already announced two collaborations and hope to announce more. We're also ready to produce should the us government

35:39.200 --> 35:41.360
Require it a stockpile of this

35:42.160 --> 35:43.200
Adjubins

35:43.200 --> 35:47.440
So that's interesting. Um, what I hear there is a

35:48.400 --> 35:51.440
Reference to this is the Glasgow Smith's Klein lady

35:52.080 --> 35:57.760
Pandemic adjuvant technology more efficacy. I presume would be more antibodies

35:58.240 --> 36:00.240
This would be an antibody thing

36:00.240 --> 36:03.120
Right because that's the that's the nature of the the whole

36:03.760 --> 36:08.960
Model of that that immune correlate and then she says antigen sparing

36:08.960 --> 36:12.160
So here I think she's actually talking about the manufacturer

36:12.880 --> 36:19.120
Of spike protein and spike protein being an antigen that would need an adjuvant technology

36:19.120 --> 36:24.160
And it could also mean the the the manufacturer of mRNA and that you could use

36:24.560 --> 36:29.200
Manufacture less mRNA if you use the pandemic adjuvant technology

36:29.600 --> 36:35.680
It's interesting that they tag on the name here pandemic adjuvant technology because it's not really clear to me

36:35.680 --> 36:41.120
What would differentiate an adjuvant that's not a pandemic adjuvant for example?

36:41.120 --> 36:43.840
I think that's already here a huge

36:44.960 --> 36:49.040
You know level of disingenuousness designed specifically to

36:49.840 --> 36:56.240
Maximize the the illusion of consensus here that may also be an illusion of consensus that is being

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
Directed at Donald Trump

37:00.560 --> 37:04.080
I mean, I'm not I'm not against that idea. No

37:05.040 --> 37:11.120
Fighting COVID-19 requires a global effort and the US is the vital leader in this

37:11.200 --> 37:14.000
We're absolutely committed to play our part in the talk. Thank you

37:14.960 --> 37:16.960
Thank you very much. Please

37:18.080 --> 37:19.520
Anthony go ahead

37:19.520 --> 37:21.520
I'd like you to share something anyway

37:22.320 --> 37:26.560
I'm Tony Fauci the director of the national astute of allergy and infectious diseases

37:27.120 --> 37:32.080
Very pleased to be on this task force, which I think you're going to see is working extraordinarily smoothly

37:32.560 --> 37:37.600
Under the leadership of the vice president and and secretary asa and as you know, we're involved

37:37.680 --> 37:40.160
And that's the reason why I'm pleased to be with in this room

37:40.720 --> 37:44.160
With you all because we're involved in the fundamental basic and clinical research

37:44.560 --> 37:47.840
To develop countermeasures in the form of therapeutics and vaccines

37:48.240 --> 37:53.520
And I'm sure i'll be working with many of you around the room and I look forward to thank you. Mr. He's so excited

37:54.720 --> 37:56.720
Thank you

37:56.880 --> 37:58.880
Director of cdc. I

38:00.000 --> 38:01.760
Also want to

38:01.760 --> 38:07.600
Thank you all for being here. I want to extend that there's anything cdc can also do as you begin to try to evaluate

38:08.640 --> 38:11.680
Some of your fruits of your labor, you know, we're here to

38:12.640 --> 38:14.640
Make that would we have available help

38:15.520 --> 38:17.520
We're all we're all no fauci

38:17.680 --> 38:23.680
New countermen fauci very very very distinctly hat tipped as our azar and

38:24.320 --> 38:27.120
And pence, which I think makes perfect sense

38:34.800 --> 38:38.320
Mr. Vice President thanks for having me here. Good afternoon. I'm dan medicella

38:38.400 --> 38:43.680
It's very rare that you get such a view of his hair being I mean usually you think it's like a kind of a

38:45.200 --> 38:49.360
It's like a bit of an exaggeration, but in this particular shot with that particular lighting boy

38:49.440 --> 38:53.120
It doesn't there's no exaggeration here at all. It's funny here. It's fun. It's nice

38:53.200 --> 38:58.400
Thank you, mr. President. Mr. Vice President. Thanks for having me here. Good afternoon. I'm dan medicella. CEO of cure back

38:58.960 --> 39:03.120
We're a clinical stage biotech cure back. We use messenger RNA technology

39:03.920 --> 39:07.120
Oppenized messenger RNA molecules once injected into the body

39:07.840 --> 39:10.720
They instruct the cells on how to make proteins for instance

39:10.720 --> 39:18.640
We can use the mRNA technology to trigger an immune response against viruses or we can get the body to increase its production of T cells for cancer vaccines

39:19.360 --> 39:21.360
In this way cure back can make potent

39:21.360 --> 39:27.520
Prophylactic vaccines and cancer treatments the technology also works well to replace missing proteins so we can also work in a rare disease

39:29.120 --> 39:33.840
One strength of our technology is that we can produce prophylactic vaccines using a very low dose

39:34.320 --> 39:40.480
So for instance the phase one rabies trial that we just completed was done at a one microgram dose

39:40.640 --> 39:43.680
So in other words a millionth of a gram dose a very very tiny gross

39:44.320 --> 39:46.960
And so more broadly our company focuses

39:47.280 --> 39:52.800
So this year we have four programs in phase one clinical trials and the coronavirus program will be the fifth program in phase one

39:52.960 --> 39:57.600
We expect that the phase one program or coronavirus will start beginning of June

39:59.040 --> 40:06.640
Our technology platform is fast and it's agile. We were the first messenger RNA company to have GMP manufacturing. We started in 2006

40:07.440 --> 40:10.240
Currently, we have three large-scale GMP facilities

40:10.800 --> 40:13.360
And we were up and running up and running now today

40:13.360 --> 40:17.520
We have a fourth facility built and we're looking for additional capex to put the machinery in there

40:17.840 --> 40:23.440
Once we have that machinery in the fourth building we can make hundreds of millions of doses of the coronavirus vaccine

40:23.840 --> 40:25.840
So we're very excited about that if we want to help there

40:26.560 --> 40:28.880
That is spectacular. I mean

40:30.800 --> 40:35.360
He seems to claim that they were ahead on the man the basic manufacturing stuff ahead of

40:36.160 --> 40:36.960
I

40:36.960 --> 40:41.200
Head of Moderna. I don't know if that's true or not, but it does seem like he's claiming that

40:43.040 --> 40:45.520
Additionally, we have developed a fully automated production

40:46.720 --> 40:51.920
Machine this automated machine is part of the collaboration with sepi and additionally with sepi

40:51.920 --> 40:57.600
We are working on the coronavirus. They have funded our efforts to get the program and the vaccine into phase one

40:58.000 --> 41:02.080
By june. I mean you could see this as being completely nonsense

41:02.080 --> 41:09.280
He already said that that it's an optimized mRNA tech that can produce T cells for cancer

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
Replace missing proteins

41:12.640 --> 41:16.720
Excuse me, but where can you do that? How can you do that? What give me the example?

41:17.280 --> 41:21.040
This is absolutely par for the course here. We just

41:22.000 --> 41:27.680
I don't think we should be surprised. We're seeing this but what we should be surprised is that we didn't see it

41:28.640 --> 41:35.440
That none of us saw it. I didn't even see it. I didn't get it none none of the academic biologists in america basically said wait

41:35.840 --> 41:42.320
What are you talking about here? This is just transfection. I didn't get it yet in march. I mean I didn't see it

41:43.760 --> 41:49.600
Wasn't until bill gates explained it on pbs news hour that I was like wait what get out of here

41:50.160 --> 41:55.680
Now I hear it. What's going on? I had to have that guy before I could see through it

41:55.680 --> 41:57.200
I

41:57.200 --> 42:03.760
Don't even know if I saw this discussion, but I find it very impressive isn't kirvak the one that that elan musk is involved in

42:04.160 --> 42:10.000
Key point here being that we believe we can develop the vaccine for covid 19 very very quickly and we have a wherewithal to manufacture it

42:10.080 --> 42:13.600
Although we would like some additional help on our largest gmp4 facility

42:14.080 --> 42:18.080
Um, again, we appreciate the opportunity to be here today and uh, thank you very much

42:21.600 --> 42:23.600
John

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Again, a vaccine research

42:29.520 --> 42:32.240
Studies in making vaccine for 100 years

42:32.800 --> 42:36.080
And we're for this project. We're working with proprietary

42:36.400 --> 42:41.840
Undercomative protein technology and make the first flu vaccine that's on an x

42:44.240 --> 42:46.720
Um, it's as a potential to define guard

42:48.400 --> 42:52.400
Early work done the star related guard is very common to me

42:55.680 --> 43:01.520
Uh, because we are a major, you know, a flu vaccine producer with this technology

43:01.840 --> 43:05.760
We have the ability to produce a large amount of vaccine

43:06.640 --> 43:12.400
Depending upon the final formulation 100 to 600 million doses per year made in New York

43:13.040 --> 43:18.080
And for we made both of our about 90 percent of our flu product that we can do

43:18.560 --> 43:23.520
Mark says that this is john shiver at the university of pennsylvania. I didn't catch the beginning there

43:23.600 --> 43:25.600
So thanks mark if that's correct

43:33.600 --> 43:35.600
To work with you in this administration

43:43.040 --> 43:47.440
When do you think you could have the vaccine when you think you'd be able to have it stuck reducing it

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
Now

43:53.520 --> 43:55.520
Some of the other technologies are

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
We do

43:59.920 --> 44:04.640
And depending upon the nature of how the epidemic goes or does it go

44:05.200 --> 44:08.960
Uh, you know, we would end with the help of the agencies of this country

44:09.440 --> 44:16.560
Uh, you know, perhaps it's a few except where you're difficult to predict your president knowing that a vaccine has to be booked safe in

44:17.680 --> 44:19.680
Because it's given the healthy people

44:20.080 --> 44:22.080
Okay, thank you very much

44:22.880 --> 44:24.880
Thanks, Mr. President for having us

44:26.080 --> 44:28.080
Family and CEO

44:28.960 --> 44:30.960
Regeneron

44:33.680 --> 44:40.880
And we are a monopolyant about if i'm already centered in a company, we are no strangers to collaborate with the administration

44:41.280 --> 44:42.480
We work with

44:42.480 --> 44:47.040
Secretary as our scooters barter and leave him up with a cure for Ebola

44:47.520 --> 44:49.520
And we're very proud of that

44:51.920 --> 44:53.920
Testing that under unbelievable condition

44:55.600 --> 44:58.080
And it didn't create quite as much a site because they could

44:58.880 --> 45:04.480
Hit our shorts, but we can use the exact same technology. We already have we have thousands of antibodies

45:05.120 --> 45:08.160
That are already sitting in fishes with screen them or selecting them

45:08.640 --> 45:10.640
We anticipate of all those well

45:11.440 --> 45:16.800
200,000 doses per month and come out of our factory in New York kind of starting or

45:17.840 --> 45:25.040
And of course we know that this is extra significant to think about this proposal in light of the fact that supreme court was about to change its mind

45:25.680 --> 45:28.480
About the intellectual property rights surrounding

45:29.200 --> 45:34.240
The production of monoclonal antibodies and it had just become exposed on a

45:35.120 --> 45:37.120
On the Yale law school review

45:37.520 --> 45:43.840
Um in a article titled the antibody patent paradox that was then later cited by the supreme court

45:44.400 --> 45:47.040
Um in its decision written by gorsage to

45:47.600 --> 45:55.600
Basically say that a lot of these patents would not hold up and that would they they don't enable the making of an antibody that is

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
That is pure and because of the nature of how antibodies work

46:00.480 --> 46:05.360
A lot of the descriptions actually fell short of the current understanding of biology

46:05.440 --> 46:10.080
And it was just kind of decided that these things weren't going to hold up to strict scrutiny

46:10.080 --> 46:14.400
If they if they were actually challenged on on pat and law basis and so

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
proposing monoclonal antibodies

46:17.440 --> 46:19.920
Um is a very interest. It's a very interesting

46:21.360 --> 46:22.800
Side story

46:22.800 --> 46:28.080
To the machinations that were going on behind the scenes because remember somewhere in this crowd

46:28.640 --> 46:30.000
um

46:30.000 --> 46:36.240
There are people from a novio and from other companies that all think it's possible that their

46:36.800 --> 46:42.080
Technology may get a significant part of this pie that is going to be billions of doses

46:42.160 --> 46:48.640
Everybody in this room already knows that there are going to be billions of doses if the coronavirus disappears tomorrow

46:49.200 --> 46:54.720
These people don't care because the motion the wheels that are being said in motion right now

46:55.120 --> 46:59.760
Are going to spend that money anyway those doses are are already in the bag

47:00.240 --> 47:06.080
These cons they're just trying to position themselves for the largest contract and the most attention

47:07.200 --> 47:12.080
That's what you're seeing here and and it's separate from the orchestration of

47:12.640 --> 47:17.440
The appearance of the pandemic and the presence of a novel virus that's separate from this

47:18.320 --> 47:21.760
These people believe it many of these people believe it

47:21.760 --> 47:25.520
They don't they're not sophisticated enough to understand it and in fact

47:25.840 --> 47:31.520
Even if they are sophisticated enough to understand that they understand that their whole livelihood in the industry that they represent

47:31.920 --> 47:33.920
Exists because of that mythology

47:33.920 --> 47:39.760
You need to think about our thing now that means you'd be able to use the vaccine that early

47:40.880 --> 47:42.880
Depends on what uh we see

47:43.120 --> 47:45.120
How we work closely with the fda

47:45.120 --> 47:46.640
Which is what we will do

47:46.640 --> 47:51.520
The fda is what we reached out to us, but we got to work so that process would be faster than jobs

47:53.760 --> 47:55.760
Um, do you explain why that would be

47:56.320 --> 47:58.320
Well, so we make

47:58.480 --> 48:00.480
passive

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
Vaccine

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
Our drug will be able to protect you

48:06.480 --> 48:12.640
Whether or not you're infected and protect you from getting infected or if you are infected it would treat you and the

48:13.360 --> 48:16.640
We have just taken processes that only take

48:18.000 --> 48:24.800
Literally years and we put them end-to-end and now do them in weeks to month but nobody else the industry can do

48:24.960 --> 48:26.960
so we're very excited to

48:26.960 --> 48:34.240
Collaborate once again. That is quite a claim of a vaccine and also it will put it in a different way make you better quicker

48:34.480 --> 48:38.240
And we'll think of it this way if you if you get immunized with one of these vaccines

48:38.560 --> 48:40.560
You're going to make some antibiotics to protect you

48:40.960 --> 48:45.360
We're going to have already make those antibodies and give them to you so you don't have to go through that whole process

48:45.680 --> 48:49.440
So to protect you and as we showed with Ebola you're giving up for them

48:49.600 --> 48:52.960
We it was life-saving life truly life-saving

48:53.040 --> 48:55.040
I wonder if his is Ebola

48:55.760 --> 49:01.520
Ebola monoclonal antibodies were like a triplet cocktail like z-map was or whether

49:02.240 --> 49:06.320
Um, it's a single what they claim monoclonal antibody. It's interesting

49:09.120 --> 49:13.760
It was the way to go. It's very predictable. I just want to say I hope everybody succeeds here

49:13.760 --> 49:18.800
I mean, this is bringing everybody together here is we want everybody to make a billion dollars

49:19.120 --> 49:24.720
There's going to be success. This industry is really talented as an industry

49:24.720 --> 49:29.280
Sometimes we want to stray, but we're going to get this done. We're going to get this done

49:29.440 --> 49:34.560
We're going to we're going to take every contract and we're going to fulfill every contract. Thank you very much. Thanks

49:38.960 --> 49:40.960
Oh

49:48.800 --> 49:51.360
In only 42 days from the sequence of a virus

49:52.080 --> 49:55.280
Our vaccine to Dr. Fauci's team at the NIH

49:55.840 --> 50:02.160
We're now waiting for the vaccine to be green light from the idea so that the team can start those in as soon as possible

50:03.200 --> 50:06.320
What is very interesting about our technology is that we use messenger RNA

50:06.880 --> 50:11.680
So basically it's an information molecule that allows to go very quickly from virginity information of a virus

50:12.240 --> 50:14.960
We're having a vaccine. So we have already have nine vaccine in the clinic

50:15.920 --> 50:20.800
In the US in Germany and in Australia. We have five of those risk authorities

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
We've always departed with data from departmental defense with further

50:26.480 --> 50:28.880
from HHS. We're having ongoing discussions

50:29.200 --> 50:34.320
We were able to go so fast because we are working for many years with the NIH and we'll work with

50:34.960 --> 50:37.440
a class half system on the MEIS

50:38.800 --> 50:42.560
vaccine for the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which is so coronavirus

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
And so we're able to move very very fast

50:45.440 --> 50:49.360
From a coupon calls to getting a vaccine made ready for the clinic

50:49.920 --> 50:51.920
We're now working on the phase two material

50:52.400 --> 50:57.520
But as soon as we get the phase one dose out of the NIH we'll be able to start the phase two right away

50:58.080 --> 51:00.080
What is your time?

51:00.080 --> 51:01.600
So we're hoping to get the

51:01.760 --> 51:03.760
The phase one stuff very soon now

51:03.920 --> 51:05.680
We're just waiting for a green light

51:05.680 --> 51:07.680
The product is at the NIH

51:08.000 --> 51:10.800
And then we should be a few months to get the human data

51:11.280 --> 51:15.200
That will allow us to pick a therapeutic dose to start the phase two right away

51:15.200 --> 51:18.080
So you're talking over the next few months. I think you don't have a vaccine

51:20.400 --> 51:22.400
Yeah, if we have a vaccine

51:22.400 --> 51:24.400
You'll have a vaccine to go into tests

51:26.400 --> 51:28.400
And how long would that take

51:28.400 --> 51:30.800
The phase two will take a few months before they're going to phase four

51:31.040 --> 51:33.520
So you're talking within a year like i've been telling you

51:34.480 --> 51:37.200
A year to many is talking about two months

51:41.200 --> 51:43.680
So you're talking within a year like i've been telling you

51:44.800 --> 51:47.360
A year to many is talking about two months

51:48.480 --> 51:51.840
I think fauci says a year to two years there at some point

51:51.840 --> 51:55.760
Which is kind of on the timeline that mark was suggesting in the original

51:56.240 --> 52:00.160
It's also what what paul cotrell was saying like an 18 month

52:01.120 --> 52:04.160
Uh an 18 month horizon or something like that

52:04.480 --> 52:07.040
The phase two will take a few months before they're going to phase four

52:07.040 --> 52:09.600
All right, so you're talking within a year like i've been telling you

52:10.560 --> 52:13.200
A year to many is talking about two months

52:18.640 --> 52:20.640
In a couple of months

52:20.880 --> 52:23.040
I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better

52:23.040 --> 52:29.520
But when you say june phase one initiation right in june not a completed vaccine

52:43.120 --> 52:45.520
Look at his face look at fauci's face

52:45.680 --> 52:47.680
He's

52:49.200 --> 52:51.200
He's hard at hard time not laughing

52:52.640 --> 52:56.560
Look at him. Oh my gosh. What is happening here?

53:00.800 --> 53:02.800
Is

53:08.160 --> 53:10.160
Look at him

53:11.840 --> 53:13.840
What do you say to that lenny

53:15.520 --> 53:17.520
I sense the cost of this

53:20.160 --> 53:21.200
Because

53:21.200 --> 53:25.920
Vaccines have to be tested because there's precedent for vaccines to actually make diseases worse

53:26.320 --> 53:30.880
And you really don't want to make it you want to rush and treat a million people and find out you make him

53:31.360 --> 53:36.480
900,000 worse to good idea. So yeah, so that's why I think why

53:37.760 --> 53:43.520
The cautious I don't speak and it's good for him because then he has more time to roll out his monoclonal anybody

53:43.680 --> 53:49.200
So good for him to come to the rescue of fauci and give him praise for being so careful

53:55.680 --> 54:01.520
So we need to prove that you know, I think that with our technology by knowing that we have neutralizing

54:02.080 --> 54:07.840
Antibodies that would give we know that this approach work for although we know that it worked for mergers and animals

54:08.240 --> 54:10.240
We have a greater degree of confidence

54:10.240 --> 54:12.240
And it's and if this would work

54:13.920 --> 54:15.920
Okay

54:24.560 --> 54:26.560
Thank you for having a

54:27.360 --> 54:31.200
We're not a vaccine company we're a therapeutic company focused on antivirals

54:32.320 --> 54:35.280
Gilead science as I know is worth a lot of people around the table here

54:35.280 --> 54:39.840
Let me first take the opportunity to thank you for the effort to the administration the secretary on the

54:40.240 --> 54:42.240
hiv elimination program

54:44.320 --> 54:46.320
With HIV incredible

54:49.280 --> 54:54.240
10 years, but now we're into nine years because it could have been started earlier and somebody else didn't start it early

54:54.240 --> 54:56.240
But we started it right away

54:56.880 --> 55:02.560
And now I'm now saying I started off saying 10 years now. I'm down to nine years. You think by the end of nine years

55:03.520 --> 55:05.520
HIV is where

55:07.360 --> 55:09.360
Can you imagine we'll be eliminated

55:10.480 --> 55:12.480
Prevent it now

55:15.920 --> 55:17.920
Is he kind of taking

55:17.920 --> 55:25.360
He's kind of getting excited about the idea that he feels somewhat responsible for having accepted this idea as being a good thing and going at it

55:25.360 --> 55:27.360
and I find that

55:27.360 --> 55:32.720
An easy way that's that potentially as I understand him as a man

55:33.440 --> 55:39.040
How donald trump could easily be bamboozled i'm i'm not i'm pretty sure he's not a biologist

55:39.840 --> 55:43.040
I have no matter how smart his brother was at mit or whatever it is

55:44.400 --> 55:50.640
I'm pretty sure he's not a biologist. I'm pretty sure that it takes a lot of time and study before you can get to the stage where you're

55:51.520 --> 55:57.760
sophisticated enough to really understand this level of bamboozlement this level of

55:58.640 --> 56:03.680
Illusion of consensus a lot of these people are unwitting participants in this illusion of consensus

56:04.000 --> 56:09.360
They built their whole career accepting the illusion of consensus about hib the necessary

56:09.920 --> 56:16.640
Then the need to treat these people and how to treat them and the accepted ways of treating them and writing the grant applications

56:16.640 --> 56:22.800
Or writing the grant proposals to those grant calls has gotten them to accept those mysteries as solved

56:23.760 --> 56:25.760
And the bad guys is who they are

56:26.320 --> 56:32.320
And it's viruses and so he doesn't in 2002. I didn't all right in march

56:33.120 --> 56:36.480
2020 on the second of march. I didn't know any better either

56:37.200 --> 56:39.200
Remember back 10 years ago horrible

56:39.520 --> 56:42.000
That was and a little beyond the 10 years and now

56:42.960 --> 56:45.920
To think about what you've done what what's happened. So daniel

56:46.400 --> 56:51.840
Let's talk about the same antiviral experience. Gilean has a decade to have to apply to coronavirus

56:51.840 --> 56:53.840
So we have a medicine called remdesivir

56:54.080 --> 56:58.240
Which is like a decade long development. So it's weird. Why would domain?

56:59.040 --> 57:01.040
Identify remdesivir

57:01.440 --> 57:08.880
If gilean already is gilead gonna say that the reason why we think it'll work for coronavirus is because the domain server identified it

57:08.880 --> 57:10.720
I don't think so

57:10.720 --> 57:14.400
Or the domain program identified it. I don't think so. So where is this?

57:15.280 --> 57:19.360
It was used for Ebola was used for Zika was used for all these things. Why?

57:20.000 --> 57:26.480
I think mark has done a few videos about this trying to understand what in the world is so special about remdesivir

57:26.880 --> 57:32.640
The that's an antiviral used to treat coronaviruses the same viruses that

57:33.680 --> 57:39.280
The same family of SARS and MERS and we're hoping that has effect now against the covid-19

57:39.440 --> 57:42.960
So we know in vitro that it has very high effect

57:43.040 --> 57:47.280
So you have a medicine that's already involved with the coronaviruses

57:47.920 --> 57:50.400
And now you have to see it specifically for this

57:51.040 --> 57:56.400
When name you can know that tomorrow. Okay. Well, we have now the critical thing is to do clinical trials

57:56.480 --> 58:02.560
And we're in the process. We have two clinical trials going on in china that were started several weeks ago

58:02.800 --> 58:04.800
There are 400 patient trials each

58:05.760 --> 58:08.880
They're getting close to halfway enrolled or any response yet

58:09.360 --> 58:12.080
Well, we don't know because they're double blind randomized trials

58:12.160 --> 58:15.600
We have to wait till the conclusion the trial we expect to get that information in April

58:16.000 --> 58:19.920
Then we've been working with tony in the group at NIH to have another protocol

58:20.400 --> 58:26.320
And na id that will also be protocol that we'll use in china outside china here in the United

58:26.480 --> 58:33.040
States to test for the virus and we have two other clinical trials that we're going to initiate next week anything here

58:33.440 --> 58:38.080
Anything that yes. Yeah, well the naad trial already had its first patient in the brass gun

58:39.120 --> 58:42.880
And i'm thinking tony we're working on your washington washington washington

58:43.040 --> 58:48.160
You go to washington state where is he washington they're mentioning the shihumish county mountain

58:49.440 --> 58:51.440
So the intention is to begin

58:51.680 --> 58:53.680
I think it's a great idea

58:54.400 --> 58:56.400
The trial is really ready to go

58:56.400 --> 59:01.840
And mark says that the china trial was already stalling at this time and so this guy's a little bit BSing

59:01.840 --> 59:04.080
I don't know if I can verify that but I trust mark

59:04.800 --> 59:08.400
We're going to specifically the nursing home with that and how brick

59:08.640 --> 59:10.640
Yes and the community of course

59:11.200 --> 59:15.920
The health care workers and that family members when you when will that take place?

59:16.080 --> 59:18.880
Well, literally I think I would go so far

59:18.960 --> 59:23.840
You know, I would go so far as to say just to step out a minute to the chat and say

59:24.400 --> 59:30.000
That you should really go to youtube and look at some of the early campaign speeches for governor

59:31.040 --> 59:33.520
Or rather that governor of california

59:34.240 --> 59:36.720
Ronald reagan did as he was running for president

59:36.800 --> 59:38.800
one of the things you're going to be disturbed by

59:39.360 --> 59:45.120
Is the level of language used and its delivery is going to make you feel like you're a little dumb

59:45.840 --> 59:49.040
Because essentially back then when he ran for office

59:49.520 --> 59:58.080
The average adult was smarter than they treat us now and the language they chose to speak to adults was smarter than it is

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.520
Now it's more sophisticated and the vocabulary was deeper

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.280
And you will see talks faster. He says things and people laugh in the audience. It's a real different kind of speech

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:16.400
Than what we see now with somebody as atrocious as joe biden or even somebody that a lot of people like like donald trump

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.120
It's just not the same level of information exchange

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.760
It's not the same level of idea pontification. It's not the same level of of exchange at all

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.920
intellectually

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.640
And so ronald reagan was killed

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.920
If you talk to or listen to what nancy reagan says

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.560
My take on ronald reagan is that he tried to do the right thing and people took advantage of that

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.760
And they put him in a position where he thought he could do the right thing

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.000
And at some point he realized that the tax system in america was not fair

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.560
And they killed it

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:58.800
And that's basically the story as i understand it and that's very different than what's happening with donald trump right now

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.800
So if donald trump's an actor

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.880
Very different kind of actor than ronald reagan was and i do think you owe it to yourself

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.840
And the history of america to go back and double check

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.880
What's available about ronald reagan and what's available about his assassination?

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.040
And maybe reconsider the fact of equating these two

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.640
Just as actors because i do think that ronald reagan

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.320
A rose in a time when people were used by other people and didn't only know didn't always know how they were being used

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.600
And it was a much more precarious kind of

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.280
meddling that it's now being done which is almost ultimate

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:44.240
Which is almost omnipotent because they can read social media control social media because the algorithms are different for everyone because what we see is different

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.200
And we can't really tell how far our message is going

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.680
It's a very different world in which we are being controlled a very different set of tools

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.480
That is being used to control us than what was being used back then when ronald reagan was president i assure you i assure you

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040
Tony's involved it'll be tomorrow morning

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:17.040
We worked on the protocols together obviously yeah i know i'm sorry i did say assassinated when he was attempted to be assassinated at that stage though

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.200
They neutralized him right i mean

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.520
He wasn't it wasn't ever the same again. He didn't i mean and we kind of

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.880
I do really think that this had something to do with what he was doing behind the scenes with regard to tax and and the dollar and

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.080
We're working hand in glove with many people around the table to make sure that whether

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.440
So what would you know if it works i mean you already have this medicine well i do think we'll know in the April time

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.760
And

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.160
April that's pretty good. That's when uh

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:57.200
Tony fauci announced it was in april that remdesivir was running if you're able to say do you have any negative kickaxe kickouts like you told

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.160
utility analyses or vsmb reviews

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.840
In the trial in china

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.640
Probably take a look at some of that data in march so far

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.040
That would be only stop though for thank you

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.000
You really have to wait at the end of the trial to see up

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.160
So we're moving as fast as we can and i think everybody around the table moving

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.600
And on top of that, of course, we have to anticipate says there were significantly investing in a manufacturing facility and capacity

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.280
We've been working closely with the administration to make sure we already built a facility

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.000
To manufacture we have facilities that were recurposed into the coronavirus. This would be tremendous news if that works

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080
Yes, it would be true because you're there

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240
You have the plant you have everything ready

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:45.280
Trial and severe patient and more moderate patient. It's in remdesivir like a pretty complicated thing to manufacture

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:52.240
Like all kinds of special and that rick bright was actually working to get a bunch of that stuff ready right away and oh gosh

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.320
It's just crazy

01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.560
Epidemiology is what went where and when is the best place? It's very exciting get it done. Yeah, we're on it

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.720
Don't disappoint us Daniel you understand that

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.040
Great company really great company. Thank you. Dr. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words. Yeah, thank you

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.360
Mr. Vice President

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.000
It's really an honor to be here with you. I'm the FDA guy

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.960
The efforts that are ongoing

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.440
You know that we're working with you very closely now with many of you and it's been a great relationship

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.720
We're very interested. This is the message I want to say and we're very interested in facilitating the development of therapeutics diagnostics vaccines

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.200
not for the benefit of the american people and

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.920
This is the first time we've heard the word diagnostic

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.200
Which I find very intriguing because the fda meeting that we watched on february 3rd

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.320
We have a call. We just watched it a couple days ago

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.280
That meeting one month before this meeting was exclusively

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.440
exclusively focused on diagnostics and diagnostic

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.800
evaluation in the context of Ebola and diagnostics as being the most important thing

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.280
According to in cutel. I mean it was pretty an extraordinary thing

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.360
And then the rest of that seminar was just about getting an EU a diagnostic into full market use

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:15.040
And how we could streamline that and make sure more of these diagnostics were successful in becoming fully approved medical devices

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.600
It's a very interesting thing to know

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.400
That a month before this that was the focus now today

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.120
All but one person when they said vaccines and therapeutics always said it in that order

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.680
Only one guy

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.200
The antibody guy didn't say it in that order and he did say it the first time he said it, but the second time he said

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.760
therapeutics and vaccines

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:47.760
It's an extraordinary thing to see now and again remember this is us looking backwards in time and having things line up in a very peculiar way

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:54.000
A very peculiar level of certainty about what would happen in the this is 2020

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:06.640
Don't let that math fool you 2020 2021 2021 2022 2023 2024 five years ago

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.240
We of course want them to be safe and efficacious but really look forward to working with you on this

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.240
Thank you

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.240
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.240
I'm chief scientist for Pfizer. Yeah

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.200
We are very pleased to be here

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.080
And for us it been always important when our major public health threats to come together

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.080
Cross the industry with biotechs and federal agencies

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.720
We were highly appreciative of the initiative that you're taking this powerful way to have all of us around this table

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.760
Pfizer as you know is a proud american company

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.800
We have 170 years of experience

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.320
Originally founded in brooklyn and head port in new york and we have brought many vaccines

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:05.120
Computics of smaller large types for patients suffering from many different diseases including

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.640
infectious disease now specifically for the

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.600
COVID-19 the corona virus

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.760
You realize how expensive this meeting is how much time is at the table here?

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.600
A lot of these guys probably get six or eight hundred dollars an hour in the

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.240
identified compound

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240
medicine that we have

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.080
That we think due to your activity against very related

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.800
viruses have

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.040
good high probability to be active against

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.880
COVID-19 and in march we are confirming that

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.600
Assumption with laboratories that have access to do this

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.240
hazardous work of

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.840
Using the live virus to confirm activity

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.720
That would allow us to work closely with

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.520
Dr. Horn here at fda and identify the past the past

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:01.040
To bring it to patients that should happen if things were well this year

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.440
And as soon as possible I can hear your encouragement to all of us

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.360
um

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360
I want to also to say that

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.280
Pfizer has

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.480
30 three zero or dm manufacturing sites in the u.s

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.800
More than 30 thousand americans involved in making or discovery medicine

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.920
And we're willing to share our experience our

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.880
capabilities as a team here

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.120
To make sure that the public in america gets the best solutions

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.680
Your competitors, but in this case it's different

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.720
Uh, this is something we want to get done very quickly

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:41.040
Do you expect to be sharing your own capabilities with Pfizer and everybody else?

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.560
Good. I think the core tension that have come from you is correct makes all of us feel that we should be one team here

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.600
I agree

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.080
We would appreciate that and at the closing remarks

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.640
We've had a tremendous partnership with nih and nid

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:04.400
In many areas being pioneering to bring medicine or advances forward with cdc dialogues and with fda here

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.760
So for us to look forward to extend this relationship to make sure that

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.920
americans

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.560
Can as fast as possible given your

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.920
Encouragement to us and with um have different options to protect them

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.720
Protection is by vaccines to

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.320
Deal with those that are exposed we need treatments and those that are ill when treatment

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.120
so

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.080
It's not just one solution. I think from this team we should offer

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.440
multiple approaches to cutic and vaccines

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.680
Does it have a few different variants of what we're talking about?

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:45.520
Do you see that happening where maybe they're different either therapeutics or vaccines for both?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
They don't have anything use

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Pfizer doesn't have anything

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.280
Maybe in different areas. You are right on the frontier of science

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.880
Uh, it is about combination and even looking at our colleagues here at dilliard

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.240
We have learned that if you have two different the mechanism put them together as treatment the likelihood of

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.240
Churing or very long-dasking responses is higher and we actually work on complementary mechanism

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.440
I love the complimentary

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.160
Yeah, that's fantastic. Thank you very much. It's really very exciting. Please

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880
Mr. Vice President

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880
My name is joseph ken

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.640
I run a company called a no-view pharmaceutical set of pennsylvania. We're a proud american biotech company

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.800
With uh rnd and manufacturing california as well

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.040
Uh, no-view is the leader in coronavirus vaccine development in the world

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.040
Uh, we have a phase two product for relating

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.920
MERS uh coronavirus vaccine

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720
in phase two stage

01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:00.640
Uh when the new outbreak occurred, we applied our very innovative 21st century

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.240
Uh platform called dna medicines platform

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800
to covid 19

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.720
Uh by getting the just the dna sequence of the virus

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.880
We're able to fully construct our vaccine within three hours

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760
and we've been working on pre-clinical

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.480
and

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.160
preparation work

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.000
Uh with the help of the fda and acceleration and really working very well together

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:35.600
Uh our plan is to start the us base clinical trials for covid 19 vaccine in april of this year

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400
followed by shortly thereafter

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.480
Uh trial in china in south korea. There are a lot more infections in those areas

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.200
Um, we can give you an area

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920
No, we can't

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920
You take a look at seattle again

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.640
Oh wow, we could give you an area

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.160
There are more infections in south korea and in china so that they need to work over there

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.120
And he could give us an area if you take a look at seattle again, we could give you an area

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.680
We could give you an area

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.120
So if you don't mind, uh, we've been collaborating with

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.440
Us agencies like dark up nih

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.880
We collaborated with octobergsta in hru vaccines and many many years ago

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.120
um

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.120
with existing

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.320
Resources and capacity by end of this year

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.160
Uh, you know, we have to deliver about 1 million doses

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.840
But to scale by by end of this year, but to scale beyond that

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.840
We need your help mr. president

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.000
We need to work with you and your agency varga and others

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.200
Uh to help us scale or a vaccine

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.720
So there you see the problem, right? He's asking for help. They can't make more than a million doses

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.640
That might be the reason why they miss the bid

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.560
Because the other people at the table already said they could do more than that

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.440
They already said they had much more manufacturing capacity than that. So it's an interesting

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.040
Admission more or less. Um, it's cool

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.760
to manufacture in america to protect american public

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.080
Uh, also to lead the world in vaccine development from america. Thank you very much

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.320
You'll have our help

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320
Thank you, please

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.720
Mr. president, mr. vice president. Um, i'm post office law hall sign vice chairman and chute scientific office officer for johnson and johnson

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.200
I'm in uh in

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.280
Vaccine research in 30 years. It's simple to ask for hiv

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.760
At the moment working within the vaccine platform, which has been deployed for is being deployed in hiv

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.280
We did uh in the times of zika as well as now in ebola

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.560
We are working with throwny on a face to win a face tree study with the hiv with the same platform

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.240
Um with varda. We have extensively collaborated on uh on ebola a vaccine at the moment

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.320
We are vaccinating thousand people a day in the walnut and in d orc showing the safety of uh

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.480
And the same vaccine platform. We are now deploying for for corona

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.280
Um, since the availability of the information on the virus mid january

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.320
We have been uh working day and i from getting to a vaccine

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.280
The first versions of that are being tested in animals at the moment with positive results

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.880
And in parallel the company has decided to start up scaling now

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.480
um, time to resolve uh will depend on

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.080
on uh

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.840
On gmp manufacturing safety frequently the safety have to work closely together with i have beyond that

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.400
uh before the year and uh

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.680
Hopefully in november we have the first clinical data starting and early next year the results of that

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.880
And at the same time we're looking for significant quality of vaccines being uh being already produced in that time frame

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.720
Uh, but you've come to anything else than at the moment starting parallel

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.200
Um, the biological clinical work and parallel doing the upscaling

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.320
Uh, and let's see where where we end as fast as possible

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.120
Do you have different concepts and methods then you you know fizer and johnson and johnson all great companies

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.400
Are you having different some seem to be the face the face here look at that

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.000
Are you having different some seem to be faster than others and others

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.480
They they do seem to be different

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.960
Concepts the difference in the concept is that we are using a cold virus and a dino vector

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.080
Which which that is a place where you can place a piece of corona a ball average

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.600
I mean so we trick the body with another virus and generate the in generate the antibody

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.840
And that's different from the others difference on the others

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.680
Difference is also

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.320
It's been used for many years now. It has been proven for many years that you could do it like that

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.640
And we also have a validated upscaling but this guy's accent is Dutch

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.040
Platform which can produce millions of doses in a premature time frame

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.400
And that's a parallel process where we develop the cell line

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.680
Which if we follow what we could do with a baller

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.080
We could produce like up to hundreds of millions of vaccines in a in a small let's say reasonably small facility for manufacturing

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.680
So can you have it ready for next season any of you? I mean would you say

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.480
The next season

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.360
Seems to be very seasonal we have to be we have to be very careful here if you're vaccinating

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:36.280
Make sure it works works and safe doesn't doesn't hurt. Yeah, that's right. I agree. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great company

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.820
She's cdc and mark says that that lady is basically the inspiration for the movie contagion

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.200
Novavax

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:25.040
Kids we have our flu vaccine. We all know we need a better flu weight. So an obio was testing

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.520
Novio was testing a rsv vaccine on pregnant women at the start of the pandemic

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.080
Did you hear that?

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.720
For 4600 pregnant women to protect the infants from our species. Wow

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.040
You see we have our flu vaccine. We all know we need a better flu vaccine

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.800
And we have one in phase three trials. We're going to unblind in four weeks

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.520
Exciting type of company, but we actually our company is focused on emerging infectious diseases

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.400
We had two coronavirus vaccines. We made one for SARS

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.360
We made one for MERS. We tested MERS and all the way through animal challenge trials

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
I'm showed a hundred percent protection

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:26.320
We have an Ebola vaccine that what the NIH showed in four different non-human studies

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.240
So many companies have made an Ebola vaccine. It's really very extraordinary

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.560
I think Robert Malone tells the story about brokering the purchase of

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.680
an Ebola vaccine by Merck

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.320
But now when you listen to this table, it seems like every company had an Ebola vaccine everybody

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.880
Every company worked with barda to make any Ebola vaccine. So that's a lot of money

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:57.600
That's a lot of money that gets spent behind the scenes that we weren't paying any attention to before the pandemic started

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:05.440
But when you look backwards in time and you look backwards and see how these things align how these motivations align how these bureaucracy

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:11.040
bureaucratic motivations align you start to see that it's really hard

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.120
In 2020 for to take them seriously when they said there was a pandemic right now

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's very hard to take it seriously

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.400
Given the fact that they're all chomping at the bit for there to be one

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
And the given the fact that they are so

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.400
United in the consensus that these responses are necessary that these

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.200
Billions if not trillions of dollars need to be spent. They just can't wait

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.160
For them to be spent

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.880
extremely low doses

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:50.400
And we made a pandemic flu vaccine for age seven and nine and others and we've twice now taken from the gene sequence

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040
To the first of human studies

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.600
And we're once again doing the same thing since the gene sequence was

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:08.240
Identify it. I think it published on January 10th. We've taken their same the competent nanoparticle platform

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.000
And have been in animal studies for a couple weeks

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.200
We expect data this week on one of us on corona and on this. I'm sorry on corona. Yes

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.560
and

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.280
We're going to be non-human primates this week with the coronavirus

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.320
vaccine candidate so so what do you think in terms of timing? What do you think timing is

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.920
What you hear around the table is as we can get into humans in the made you in timetable

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.920
And

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.680
Also, but we'll have primate data. So those are a lot of speeds I think pretty much

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.640
We'll make it very easy for you, but those are and we have to be very safe, but those are on our own speeds

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600
And we're trying to identify

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.440
Scale so that we can get to the billion million scale both where we have a vaccine antigen

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.920
Also

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.440
So he's talking about the fact

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:11.280
He's talking about the fact that novavax is going to use a protein produced by some other recombinant method

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.360
I think they might have used silk worms or something like that or a mothworm. I don't know

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.800
Um, it doesn't matter. They were going to make the spike protein

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.960
Using recombinant methods. So then the injection was going to be a protein plus an adjuvant

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.520
So maybe they can use the the specialized protein. What was it called?

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.640
it was called a

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:38.240
pandemic adjuvant technology that's glaxo smith Klein on the other end of this on the other end of

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.640
Are the other side of donald trump has available?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.120
Maybe they can combine that with their protein

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.560
Instead of waiting 30 days for

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960
10 days or 20 whatever the numbers

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.720
But there are a lot of things that we can do with the FDA and frankly, we need money. We're a biotech company

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280
I'm not we need money

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.040
We need money

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:16.000
Let me just say the gig ome biological also needs money if you'd like to subscribe, please go to gig ome biological.com. Thank you very much

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.200
And we have worked with the other companies in this particular

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.920
instance we have not yet, okay

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:27.040
Dr. Stephen Han by the way is the new head of the FDA for those of you that don't know and he's

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.600
One of the most respected people in the country and this is the man we wanted

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.000
And this is the man we got you didn't know you were going to be hit with this your first month

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:43.840
You're here for a couple of months and this was pretty big ever. Would you like to say something? Oh, Debbie

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.000
Well, thank you. It's a privilege to be here. Thank you. Mr. President. Mr. Vice President

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.760
I think what was exciting to hear around the table as you have a potential for a bridge

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.240
A bridge between the therapeutics and monoclonals while we work on the vaccines

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:03.040
And I think that's the most promising piece for the american people to know that there's technology that can be used as an immediate bridge

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.840
And then as we work on the vaccines, I think

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.280
Making sure that we've tested all of the antivirals that you have in your collection

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.720
Against this particular virus do I see fifties across the board many of you have

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.480
Antibiral medication that I think just to assure the american people that we have tried

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:29.680
Using our innovators to actually screen all the current drugs for potential activity against this virus would be key

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:36.240
But I think this is very promising with this linkage that you put together in this room between monoclonal antibodies

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.240
There are a few extra vaccines

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.440
It is very exciting and the speed is very exciting too

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Anybody else have anything to say?

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.760
Tony was something on the screening. So we set up already a

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:55.920
Industry construction the duchy everyone is not able to submit by a take off pharmaceuticals to submit to a screening

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.400
Which is set up for everybody supported by barda and support them by

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.640
Yeah, so barda in what was supporting a universal screening thing

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.800
By a take off pharmaceuticals to submit to a screening

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.280
Which is set up for everybody supported by barda and support them by

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.960
You move rapidly by barda in europe. I think he said interesting

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.480
Media would you like to ask any questions of any of the geniuses or

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.240
Markets up today. Our country is very strong economically as you know

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.320
this was a

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:42.560
Something that came out of china that was a big surprise to the world it happened just a few weeks ago and

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.080
I'm sure the fed is looking at it. I hope the fed is looking at they shouldn't be but a lot of the central banks are looking at

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.160
interest stimulus and one thing I want to add we keep talking about for america but really we're looking at for a cure for the

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.680
All-world because this is a world cure not just united states

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:05.040
We want to take care of the united states, but whatever we do is going to annuit to the benefit of the world

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.000
So we want to do that and save in the world

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.240
Some of your companies are so large you can you can handle that but you work together

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:19.840
Thereby making it even better. So we appreciate that we would love to have you work together on this get it done and get it done safely and quickly

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.560
But I think I had a word very strong shape very strong shape

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.200
Actually very strong shape and you know I have to tell you I came into the room not expected to hear quite what I've heard

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.200
But a lot of work has already been done. We've been encouraging them for the last few weeks. I mean literally from

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
First day when we shut it down when we shut down the border so to speak

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.600
We shut it down to china something we didn't like to do but we made a good decision

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.840
but we also call some of the companies around the tables and get going just in case get going and

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:58.960
We're very proud of the work that some of them have done some are very advanced already on this particular coronavirus

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.480
So we appreciate it. It's tremendous news. And I think the speed is a lot greater than a lot of people would have

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.760
Well, I don't know I think you're so rich. I know the company is very well. Some of them are so rich

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.880
I think they can actually loan money to the federal government

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.040
They don't need body they need time. I think what they need more than anything else

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.040
Well, I don't know. I think you're so rich. I know the company is very well. Some of them are so rich

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.960
I think they can actually loan money. Do you remember him saying that? Wow, that's pretty

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.200
That's a good one. I'll give him prey. I'll give him a point for that

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.040
They don't need body they need time. I think what they need more than anything else to any you might tell me but

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.200
I think what you need is

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.640
FDA and

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.640
Tony have to help you get through the process as quickly as possible

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:59.360
The bureaucratic stuff and and we don't have bureaucrats here. We have people that really know how to get it between Tony and Bob and

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.600
Steven

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.160
They'll get you folks through very very quickly

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160
Is that a good speaking of us getting on the Fed?

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160
Well, I think we should have a meeting already

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.880
I don't know what that noise is. It's going to be talking about various things tomorrow

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.920
Uh, but we'll see what happens, but I think it's on the recording. I guess already. I don't know what takes them so long

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.960
I'll see what happens. Let's see what happens tomorrow

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040
You're buying what

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.840
Listen as the president has said we've said from the out get to the choppa

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.680
And we need to be prepared

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.600
We need we prepare for the worst case. We hope for the best case

01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.840
Part of preparing is normal preparedness activities by individuals. He's turning red dot go

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.640
To get normal air for the seer of the united states and we need to be prepared

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.960
We need we prepare for the worst case. We hope for the best case

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:18.320
Tony loves this because it's like he orchestrated everybody's doing exactly what he wanted them to do when it came to a pandemic response

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.240
Part of preparing is normal preparedness activities by individuals go to cdc dot go

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.760
To get information about just sound preparedness at home like you would have for a hurricane or for the blue season

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.920
That's the same type of activity now. So having some food

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.640
Having some hand sanitizer, but frankly soap and water a good a good soap and water hand washing

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:49.360
Um for an appropriate amount of time if you look at cdc dot go for 20 seconds is as effective as that kind of sanitizer

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:55.280
20 seconds people should not be panicked. They shouldn't be I know they may feel that they may feel a sense of unease

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.040
They feel the uncertainty. We're trying to reveal all information we have

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:06.080
Um, but there are steps people can take like that just good every day preparedness

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.200
Nothing different today than they would I would have advised six months ago

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.160
Yes, we are to certain countries where they have more of a breakout

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.760
We are you know what those countries are not to say but

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.920
We are doing that and we've already done it as you know with three countries

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.540
In addition to China, so we will be doing

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.680
I don't think you'll be that because I really think we're in you know extremely weak shape

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.600
We're prepared for anything that we could always do that in a later date if we need it

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.640
But I don't think we need that at this stage, you know interestingly

01:29:52.640 --> 01:30:00.960
We would discuss a unique question. It's weird because I would say that already the emergency they help and human services emergency has already been declared

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.200
Correct me if I'm wrong

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.400
but

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.800
If I'm wrong that I want to know when but I do think that the emergency has already been declared

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.920
I think he's talking about declaring a national emergency

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:19.280
Which is a bit different than an hhs hhs declared emergency, which is very separate from that and I think that's that's

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840
Okay, maybe for fema then yet, right?

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.080
Should I get asked a lot by people is

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.640
On average you lose from

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.280
26,000 to 70,000 or so and even in some cases more from the flu

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:38.720
We lose we have deaths of that per year worldwide. It's hundreds of thousands of deaths from the common flu

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.840
And they ask you know, what's the difference and how does this

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.480
I differ and I guess there are things that are similar and things that are different every one of them is different

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.560
It might not be a bad question to ask because I get that all the time

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.600
So so far we have six here

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.120
You have

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.240
You know the country is very I mean china obviously got hit the hardest

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.960
I noticed that south gurus hit very hard. Italy is being

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.960
six

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.520
Did he just say we have six here?

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.880
He couldn't have just said that that's not possible

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.160
Be a bad question to ask because I get that all the time

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.960
So so far we have six here

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.720
You have

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.840
You know the country is very I mean china obviously got hit the hardest

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.280
I noticed that south gurus hit very hard

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:32.480
So we had six cases in the united states and we got all the richest ceos in america pharma

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.640
And got them into the room at the same time

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:41.840
Can you imagine that that that's extraordinary these people are definitely ready to go

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640
And they think about this

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.880
Really is being hit very hard

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.720
But I would like to maybe not because I am oftentimes this we

01:31:53.280 --> 01:32:00.560
Average I suspect tony I think you said from around 26 27 000 up to 60 or 70 000 deaths per year

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.560
That's a lot of deaths and

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.000
Here we're talking about a much smaller range now

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.160
Hopefully it stays remember that all flew deaths up until this point are more or less a modeled

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:16.400
Number of deaths that are assumed in order that the cdc can justify the rollout of the flu vaccine every year

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:23.040
The flu vaccine is not funded unless the cdc declares that enough people are dying of flu for it to be funded

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.880
And I do think that this has been fact checked by more than one of my viewers

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.960
But it's definitely true in my understanding that the cdc can't just fund the flu vaccine

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.360
It actually has to jump through a formal hoop of declaring a flu epidemic every year

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.440
And that I could epidemic is defined by a modeling scheme

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:48.480
Which you know tries to look at all cause mortality and respiratory disease in hospitals and attributes some of it to p&i

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:55.520
That's what we're dealing with here. There's a disconnect. I'm not even sure that donald trump is at the stage where he understands it yet

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.200
Is at a much smaller range and again we're prepared for anything

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.280
Uh, could I ask you uh or any of you if you'd like to answer that question

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.960
Where would the public what would the public think when you have so many

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:13.680
And that's taken routinely and I was shocked to hear this, you know three four weeks ago. I said, well, how many people die

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:20.960
A year from the flu and in this country, I think last year was 36 or 37,000 people and i'm saying wow

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.400
Nobody knew that information worldwide. You just multiply it out times in the world, right?

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.880
Uh, so what is the different state?

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.520
I think there are people around the table that i don't think are more medically qualified, but I mean

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.680
Clearly what we're represent around the table is the ability to prevent

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.480
uh, you know

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.880
You know an endemic of sorts and the ability to treat

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:52.320
An endemic of sorts to prevent an endemic of sorts. I knew it was going to come up

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.520
I knew zero covid was going to come up because

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.360
Zero covid is something that Brett Weinstein was still

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.160
Vociferously advocating for in june of 2021 that it was still an achievable goal

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:13.760
That's why I play that video in the beginning of these episodes because you really need to understand that certain concepts were already

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.480
Pre-laid they were already found in that cnn video

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.240
We watched a couple weeks ago where the lady that that that reporter garret says that well

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:28.320
The worst case scenario with one of these things is that a virus isn't stopped and then it goes endemic

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.000
And so he's already trying to coin a term here

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.320
He's already trying to suggest that a pandemic could become an endemic

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.680
Has if an endemic is bad an endemic is something that was always there. It's in the background

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.960
It's endemic

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.400
Like automobiles are endemic to western civilization

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440
I want to hear him say it again

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:05.680
You know an endemic of sorts and the ability to treat those two and endemic of sorts

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.880
You may have to up our research on the flu

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:25.680
Yeah, we actually have taken on the challenge that you just mentioned so we are investing in what could be

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.920
New technology into completely shaped outcome of flu when you need to think about

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:37.360
How you can move fast from the first cases to have the right type of vaccine and how you can be able to manufacturing very fast

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.440
Because I think you are right on top point that the numbers in flu are so large and we haven't come

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.640
That to that level yet, but I think it's also the fear that there is no

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.680
Experience yet with these virus and we don't have the feeling of

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:58.240
Going to CVS and get the flu vaccine or use some of the early developed drugs

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.440
But I think you summarized it very well. It's our

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080
challenge is we should take on

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.880
Year by year and advance and protect lives

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.240
Tony they have to maybe hey, don't eat

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.440
Because when you lose that many people, yeah

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.800
Tony is that we have a major effort to develop what we call a universal flu vaccine

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.520
Man

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:33.040
That would cover all the different strains of the universal flu vaccine not to be confused with the universal coronavax

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.440
Coronavirus vaccine both of which we are going to need very soon and are just around the corner

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.640
And then around the next corner is going to be when we use retroviruses to cure child

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:50.960
The diseases then around the next corner is where there is no more disease at all on the world than that we live forever, right?

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.940
That's where you don't have to keep worrying about it mutating from year to year

01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.240
Yeah, so that's a major effort that we have. Thanks Max nonsense. Have a good day

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.600
And then you know I hear numbers that are not great

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.160
60% 70% coverage

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.640
success

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.160
And yet I hear numbers that are better than that with respect to corona. You think you could really knock it out

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.960
And that's because you know, oh

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.960
Do you hear what he's saying?

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.160
Please tell me you just heard what he said. This is beautiful

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.960
He's talking about previous conversations that he's had with these people before this meeting

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.840
Where they talk about how we get flu vaccines to go sometimes 70% coverage

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.680
And that they thought they could get this one a lot farther than that

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.560
Shall we listen to it again

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.880
Shall we listen to it again because that was really tasty for my ears

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:54.400
It was that was like choice cuts right there. Here it comes. I'm sure I heard it right

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.680
And then you know I hear numbers that are not great

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.240
60% 70% coverage

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.720
success

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:08.240
And yet I hear numbers that are better than that with respect to corona. You think you could really knock it out

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.520
And that's because you know specifically what it is. I suspect so that's impressive

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.840
What do you think?

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.960
Surprises surprises there are always surprises in a Scooby-Doo episode

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.240
That's the best part about Scooby-Doo is that it's very surprising what happens in a Scooby-Doo episode

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.960
Surprises

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:41.200
Man this pen is disappointing me

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.760
Because I shouldn't hold it in my hand for a few seconds uncapped and then have it completely dry

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.240
It's super annoying because it's a nice pen, but it doesn't work like I needed to work

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.040
um only certain pens

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320
Certain fountain pens are able to cope with

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.720
Occasional writing and it's very impressive the ones that stay wet and the ones that don't in my collection

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.960
Um

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.240
Some of them that work very well when you write all the time just don't work very well when you're taking notes

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.480
And I get very frustrated with things that don't start writing when I want to start writing

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.440
Why am I talking about that? I don't know this guy gets referred to as Lenny a few times

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.800
I wonder if they have been friends already for longer than this meeting. Maybe he's the one he feels most comfortable with

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.600
Around the table. Um, it's interesting that he refers him to it as Lenny

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.880
Maybe a hundred million people are just checking his vaccinate

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.360
We have nobody in this country vaccinated for coronavirus

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.760
So that goes but the same vaccine could not work you take a solid flu vaccine

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.960
You don't think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.040
Probably none

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.680
So

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600
Yeah

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.600
He said totally naked to this virus, that's an interesting way of putting it everybody's vulnerable remember

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.320
That was part of the key narrative of the novel virus

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.760
It's a novel virus for which everyone is vulnerable that

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.440
Was a an assured agree. They are all in consensus about that

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.640
Obviously we're all vulnerable because it's a new virus none of us have seen it before

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:41.840
This was essential part of the worst case scenario an essential part of the worst case scenario being enforced here

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.600
and also in the darkest corners of the internet by by

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.840
Low level and high level players basically

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:57.120
All people that were encouraged with comfort and fame and fortune and and promotion and likes

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.320
In order to fuel the idea that a worst case scenario could be a billion people dead

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.200
It could be

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:09.440
Endemicity of a deadly virus that right now at this table people think could be 30 percent lethal

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880
Yeah

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.520
Who are in an industry where optimism is an essential part of the toolkit

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.480
But realism is that you know 95 percent of what we all work on doesn't go too far

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.920
So we that's why it's so important have so many different

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:49.120
Approaches you can't but it seems to me just based on what you said and also what the other folks said from great companies companies

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:54.240
I know very well from just seeing you know what they do and I find it very interesting

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.600
I have for a long time

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.680
It would seem to me that

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.000
You already know pretty much where you're going and where you're headed and what the answer is going to be

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.400
This is interesting. That's an interesting observation. I didn't notice it

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.800
Let me go back to that cut and see if I agree with you

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:16.880
It's supposed to be recorded from a live meeting, but I do not know that it's recorded from a live meeting. It's not a it's on a on a non

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.600
Popular youtube channel, right? It looks like it was uploaded four years ago

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.600
But that's an interesting question

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.760
Because it doesn't really I mean

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.400
How would they cut like this in a live meeting? It's good. I I mean, I know they can cut in a live meeting like this

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.360
But they must have had a camera guy walking around then it's interesting. I like that question. Thank you for asking it

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.400
But realism is that you know 95 percent of what we all work on doesn't go too far

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.760
So we that's why it's so important have so many different

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:53.040
Can't but it seems to me just based on what you said and also what the other folks said from great companies companies

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:59.120
I know very well from just seeing you know what they do and I find it very interesting. I have for a long time

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.520
it would seem to me that

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.000
You already know pretty much where you're going and where you're headed and what the answer is going to be

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.920
It would seem that steep doesn't seem

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.000
You seem to know what the answer is to this you have to get it done

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.720
Yeah, they know what the answer is they're going to make a spike protein oriented vaccine

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.120
And that is a very extraordinary choice that all of them have agreed on from the very very beginning

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.880
That's an extraordinary choice that no one really seems to want to highlight

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.800
Instead wants to focus on the gain of function portion and the gain of function of a lab leak and the

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.040
spreading novel pathogen for which we are all vulnerable

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:49.200
And not one person here except for Donald Trump seems to notice that you guys pretty much already know what the answer is it seems

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.200
You just have to finish

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.840
You guys have all this in manufacture and not one of you has chosen a different protein

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:00.320
Not one they've all agreed that the spike protein is the obvious target

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.120
Even the Novavax people that are going to make the protein itself. Why would you make a toxin?

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:08.160
In in huge quantities

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.040
Unless

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040
There was just a consensus

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.680
Was that too optimistic or statement

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.080
I think some of the new technologies that have come

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:27.360
That we heard today with about the m or nay in dna where you use competing youth right tools and technologies

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:32.960
They give us an opportunity to move fast and that's why some of the companies that have been working on early diseases

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.760
Can quickly

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.200
Change priorities and that means huge public health threat

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:45.120
But I think we should take on as a team to do something with the seasonal flu and actually

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:50.080
I think Robert Redfield that has been one of your key priorities and we've certainly picked up on that

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:53.280
I know where there would be a great thing if you could do that just aside from this meeting

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.680
If you could do that, that would be a great thing. Does anybody else have anything to say please

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.840
Well, I want to just thank you all very much for being here and it sounds

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.240
I'm very it's a very optimistic meeting. I didn't realize you were that far advanced and you'll

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.680
Get together if you have to you that far advanced

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.960
See he's not aware of the fact that all these people got phone calls and they went immediately full board

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:20.960
The dutch guy said they've already gone into full upscale of the jnj. Should they know they're going to get bought doses bought

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.960
You know with tony and bob and you'll deal with uh, hey tony and

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.800
Get it done. We need it. We want it fast. Okay

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:39.200
I don't know what the time will be. I don't think they know what the time will be

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.880
I've heard

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:46.000
Very quick numbers a matter of months that i've heard pretty much a year would be an outside number

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.520
So I think that's not a bad that's not a bad range

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:54.880
But if you're talking about three to four months in a couple of cases and a year and other cases

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.360
Would you say doctor would that be about?

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:04.080
I mean, how certain can you be that you need something when you only have six cases and you've closed the borders and you think that zero

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:06.160
COVID is possible?

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:12.880
Don't you understand even if they had zero COVID even if all these tests were negative they were planning to go forward with

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.840
Vaccination because the virus is circulating in china. It's inevitable that it's going to get here

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.480
endemic and

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.880
Endemic he said the word endemic

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.840
Like it was a verb or a or a or a something that could happen an endemic could happen

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:36.880
We are really in trouble ladies and gentlemen if we look at the history and we see this we should not discount it

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:44.960
It feels very much to me like there is evidence of malevolence here that this is a preconceived notion of what we were going to do next

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.880
And donald trump is just kind of a guy who's trying to pretend that

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:56.000
All this illusion of consensus doesn't have an effect on him that he's he's not impressed by it

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.480
But of course he is how can anyone not be impressed by this level of consensus

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.760
Well, you have the greatest companies in the world sitting around the table

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.280
I mean johnson and johnson advisor and all of the companies gilead

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.840
You have all of these great companies and that's what they're saying. So I think that

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:24.400
I didn't make sure you get the president information that a vaccine that you make and start testing

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:29.040
The year is not a vaccine that's deployable. So he's asking the question

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:35.040
When is it going to be deployable and that is going to be at the earliest a year to a year and a half

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:41.600
No matter how fast you go a year to a year and a half, but they got it done in nine months

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:49.840
They were injecting people in the uk already in december and feb and and november of 2020

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:53.920
They were already doing the trials like ladies and gentlemen

01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:00.000
What tony fauci saying here is actually kind of what mark kulek says is

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:05.120
Likely the original plan was for it to be a couple years. This was supposed to be longer

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.440
And

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:13.840
I don't think they were able to sustain the level of fear and conformity that they thought they were going to be able to sustain

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:23.120
And that's why the role of the dissident movement has become so prominent where it was never meant to be

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.760
who was meant to be a sideshow

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.560
And it's become half the story

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.720
And that's not the way they wanted it to be as he said with the flu vaccine

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.440
They were pretty sure they could get this all the way

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.240
That everybody would take it

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.800
And that would have required more drama and more psychological

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.320
Torture and more censorship than they could muster

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.040
apparently

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.600
I am very optimistic when I watch this because I do think it confirms a lot of things that

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.400
Mark and I have been talking about over the last few years and more importantly it confirms the fact

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.240
that so many people that are members of this bureaucracy and that are members of the

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.000
Of the elite that feed from this bureaucracy

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.800
That there was no stopping them once offered this this possibility there was no stopping them

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.640
No stopping fauci no stopping cdc and no stopping these companies

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.920
From making sure that this illusion never went away

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.080
I would go so far as to say that I could imagine at this table that there's enough money at this table to pay

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.840
people

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840
To go on the internet and worry

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.680
I would say that there's enough money at this table to pay people that used to work for them

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:40.720
That still work for them to go on the internet and make

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.920
the worst case scenario real

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.000
To make sure that this train did not stop

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.400
To make sure that no one was able to get off before the doors closed

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:56.800
And that we were off to the races in march already of 2020

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.760
How would you do that? Well, you would put a bunch of people on the internet

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.440
fake doctors claiming to be

01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:06.480
investment

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.840
Gurus turned health nuts

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:18.240
You would put all kinds of people out there people with three degrees claiming to know what was going on

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.240
Nurses

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.640
Claiming to know what's going on doctors claiming to know what's going on

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.120
In order to make sure that the worst case scenario was not only believable but assumed to be true

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:38.880
Because you've got a fool the bureaucracy too

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:48.400
It's hard to really tell where it all came from it's hard to really say that it would be all the department of defense when you see all of this

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.960
Motivation

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.320
Potential

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.320
Billions of dollars are available

01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:04.720
If the worst case scenario is believed long enough billions if not trillions of dollars are available if the worst case scenario remains gray enough

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.000
And so there are

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.600
Billions of reasons why people would have been paid

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:18.400
To make sure that the worst case scenario was always believable was always on people's mind

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:26.400
And that people instead went to the possibility of a laboratory leak as a result of of hubris

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400
And by trying to solve that mystery

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.680
They accepted this

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.680
I

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.920
Might be more exciting

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:58.240
Ambassador burks I think laid out a really nice framework as we think about managing expectations ambassador burks

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.080
Which is be thinking antiviral therapeutics

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:10.080
Transitioning to monoclonal antibodies and eventually to vaccines as we think about the continuum of research and development here

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:17.440
Well, you know, I think Tony. I think that's interesting because they don't eat treatment in a certain way

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.600
Especially when you have people that are

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.360
Looking for treatment. They've already got they're beyond the vaccine stage

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:29.520
That would be very exciting and it always goes faster than vaccine because you're dealing with someone who's already sick

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.480
That's the safety issues are going to be much much different

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.120
And you will know you result almost immediately whereas with vaccines

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:44.160
So then what would be your timing for treatment spectacular therapeutics commonly known

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.040
For us

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.240
And

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:02.480
Said you're going to find out very quickly suddenly a mystery whether these things work or not

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.920
We're pretty confident that among our parts of the monoclonal antibody

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.560
Leni is re-generant

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:15.920
You think that that approach has a very high probability in the near term of delivery and test itself so that so treatment

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I mean just the media so the treatment element of it goes faster than the vaccine element of it

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.800
Which in my opinion in this case would be better

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.720
But I mean the remdesivir are medicine. It's in phase three trials right now. These trials are conducted very fast

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.880
I mean we're talking about 30 day endpoints

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.040
So you recruit them

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.640
You know in 30 days, you know once you recruit whether it works or not

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.560
You know in 30 days whether it works or not

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.280
That's amazing. Thankfully so far the drugs seem to be very safe

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.760
But we have to determine is this level of

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.360
Clinical effectiveness and now as I said, we'll know

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:56.640
As a treatment somebody is sick, right?

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.720
They have the problem

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.480
It has been used when do you think it could be used?

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:05.200
Well, if if the trial that that daniel was talking about proves efficacy

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.600
Which you likely might know in a few months whether it's effective effective enough

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.080
If you know by june

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:16.800
That it's effective that you just scale up and manufacture it and you're good to go

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.280
How good is that?

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.480
That's good even by your statement

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.400
Let me give you an example for instance with with the regenoron product with the bowl

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.280
So tony fauci and his team

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.680
In the world health organization ran a historic forearm clinical trial

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.400
in the war zone and eastern convo

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.360
And two of the products one of them developed by nid

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
developed by regenoron

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.080
Proved so effective that the ethical board said stop on the other two

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.440
Treating and when I went to the Congo

01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.840
I got to see people that even before

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:07.360
FBA approval are being treated still in the extension of this clinical trial and being cured of Ebola now walking out

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.800
Where they would have had a death sentence before which is that's what that's what we would try to do

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.680
That's what we would try to do. He just got back from the Congo

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.720
And uh, that's dedication. He was that was not an easy trip one of the best laboratories in the world probably

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:38.100
I mean, it wasn't easy very

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.100
President, I'll be at an age tomorrow

01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.660
Look forward to working with all of you. And I want to I want to commend each and every one of you for

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:47.380
Responding to the president's call for action

01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.460
This is all hands-on deck

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:52.500
And the news out of this meeting that you've already formed a consortium

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:56.500
We know we have the greatest pharmaceutical industry in the world in the united states, mr

01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:02.820
President now we know they will be working together to create therapeutics and ultimately a new vaccine to deal

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:05.540
coronavirus and thank you

01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:08.020
And anybody delays you please call me

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:10.900
I know just called Tony and Bob

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:14.020
All right

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:17.220
13,000

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.380
They must have heard about this meeting

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.780
Who's talking outside?

01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:29.460
Now this is a very optimistic way. Look, I know optimism and not optimism and pestle if the worst pessimism and I will tell you

01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:34.420
Uh, the whole thing with therapeutics to me is very exciting and obviously vaccine

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:37.780
But therapeutics is very exciting especially when you're so far

01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:42.820
As you know, um, it's time for basketball

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:46.660
Um, and so I'm gonna head over to the hoops

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:50.900
and uh spend an hour with my sons and then

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.780
Maybe I'll be back on this afternoon or this evening. Otherwise for sure tomorrow

01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.380
Um, I'm getting my act together very slowly, but surely get my head together slowly, but surely

01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.940
um and and developing

01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:06.740
Um

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:13.780
Strategy on how to bring more to the table over the coming coming weeks. Um, so that I have more to

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:18.180
Um, ask you to support. I understand that I haven't

01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:21.380
I haven't been putting out as much

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.460
Content has I've been promising. Um, but that

01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:33.700
That's just the way life is right now. Um, and until we have enough where we can totally devote

01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:39.140
All of my free time to this working time to this, um, it's just going to have to be a

01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:44.740
A crapshoot like this, but I'm trying my best and I will continue to try to hone it

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:49.700
So that we can be on, um, at predictable times times that are on the schedule

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:53.780
Um, I'm not sure if it's going to stay one o'clock it might move before lunch

01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:58.020
It might move right to 1212 or 1111. I don't know

01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:02.260
Um, but I do know that that we're going to try and and make

01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:08.340
More and more effort as we go forward. So I just want to thank everybody that's supporting the stream now

01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:09.940
Um, of course

01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:14.740
I love it if more people would support but I'm going to give you reasons in the next couple weeks to

01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:20.900
To click that button. So if you're still on the fence and still enjoying this content then please share it

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:22.420
and uh

01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:27.380
And and and stay tuned because uh, we're going to keep working. Thanks very much for joining me. I'll see you again soon

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:35.140
