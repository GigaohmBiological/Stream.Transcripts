WEBVTT

00:25.592 --> 00:44.101
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

00:44.401 --> 00:46.402
It's just a big hassle in the end.

00:47.002 --> 00:53.125
But no, when, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and

00:59.362 --> 01:02.704
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:02.764 --> 01:05.265
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

01:08.459 --> 01:27.031
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:28.131 --> 01:36.577
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment

01:38.757 --> 01:40.318
I think truth is good for kids.

01:40.738 --> 01:44.521
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:45.041 --> 01:46.682
We want everybody to feel good.

01:47.603 --> 01:49.044
That's not the way life is.

01:51.526 --> 01:53.027
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:53.687 --> 01:55.448
You can sort of feel it in people.

01:57.249 --> 01:57.970
And I have lied.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.031
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:59.051 --> 01:59.971
I don't want to lie.

02:00.832 --> 02:01.812
I don't think I'm a liar.

02:01.912 --> 02:02.953
I try not to be a liar.

02:02.973 --> 02:03.834
I don't want to be a liar.

02:04.394 --> 02:07.116
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.561
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:13.062 --> 02:14.842
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:16.843 --> 02:17.243
Isolation?

02:17.263 --> 02:17.603
What was that?

02:18.404 --> 02:19.004
Isolation and purification.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.445
Of the virus?

02:21.525 --> 02:21.725
Yes.

02:22.966 --> 02:24.746
Well, you isolate a virus by

02:31.545 --> 02:54.465
finding the virus which causes a disease you purify a virus by making a lot of I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus I don't understand what the issue they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different no it depends on how they used it can you explain the process of HIV isolation

02:57.008 --> 02:58.949
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:59.009 --> 03:05.051
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:05.131 --> 03:07.192
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:11.374 --> 03:12.674
I'm afraid that the latest data...

03:33.336 --> 03:35.438
All right, next I'd like to get into the halftime shuffle groove.

03:36.158 --> 03:39.641
This groove is one of my favorites, some of my favorite drummers.

03:39.941 --> 03:41.643
I love hearing them play this kind of groove.

03:44.545 --> 03:48.348
I used the halftime shuffle groove on the tune Rosanna, the Toto Cut.

03:49.229 --> 03:55.434
And I've been asked about that beat a lot, so I'd like to try to explain that beat at the best of my ability right now, get it clear.

03:56.435 --> 03:59.117
I stole that beat from listening to two records.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.139
One was Home At Last.

04:02.205 --> 04:05.167
and Babylon Sisters, which is Bernard Purdy, Steely Dan Records.

04:06.048 --> 04:09.831
Another is the John Bonham on Fool in the Rain, a Led Zeppelin tune.

04:10.992 --> 04:16.096
The Bernard Purdy thing, I like to call it the Bernard Purdy halftime shuffle, is basically this.

04:26.604 --> 04:30.948
The John Bonham beat that I copied from Fool in the Rain was something like this.

04:39.343 --> 04:43.007
Putting those two beats together, I came up with my own little kind of hybrid.

04:43.808 --> 04:47.773
For Rosanna, I added the Bo Diddley figure.

04:47.793 --> 04:49.214
It's a shuffle Bo Diddley figure.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.099
Basically.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.702
And putting them together, this is what it came up with.

05:24.002 --> 05:27.664
Wake up in the morning, see your eyes.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.625
Rosanna, Rosanna.

05:31.225 --> 05:34.687
Never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me.

05:36.187 --> 05:37.068
Rosanna.

06:01.824 --> 06:27.678
Rosanna, yeah Now she's gone and I have to stay Me too, all the way Me too, all the way Rosanna, yeah Me too, all the way

06:39.845 --> 06:44.250
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side.

06:45.150 --> 06:47.553
Rosanna, Rosanna.

06:47.893 --> 06:52.337
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad.

06:53.759 --> 06:54.560
Rosanna.

07:19.492 --> 07:21.610
Losing my head

09:08.841 --> 09:09.404
All the way!

10:50.180 --> 10:50.921
The End

11:30.848 --> 11:32.049
Good morning, everybody.

11:32.129 --> 11:34.731
I can't agree more about Elon Musk.

11:34.751 --> 11:36.192
I can't agree more.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.354
It drives me bananas sometimes.

11:38.374 --> 11:38.694
I have to

11:39.574 --> 11:45.376
I have to count my, I have to count to 10 or something every once in a while because I just can't believe it.

11:45.436 --> 11:57.479
And I, what, what really strikes me as odd is that there were several people in 2020 and 2021 that I was interacting with in private that were actually super Elon Musk.

11:58.099 --> 12:05.045
Like, he's the man, he's the guy, he's the most patriotic billionaire.

12:05.726 --> 12:11.310
And they were all convinced of it, especially in behind the scenes in a signal chat.

12:11.711 --> 12:17.996
And this always drove me nuts because I kept telling these people, like, this whole Neuralink thing is dumb.

12:18.056 --> 12:20.558
Like, I don't know how to tell you how bad it is.

12:21.038 --> 12:24.001
They don't need to go into your brain to do tricks like that.

12:24.081 --> 12:26.363
And I kept repeating it over and over.

12:26.903 --> 12:32.732
And these people just kind of were like immune to words or something, immune to logic, and they just ignored it.

12:32.792 --> 12:41.305
The same people, the same people who ignore that there's no evidence of spread in New York City, that infectious clones is the only real term you need to understand.

12:41.405 --> 12:41.646
Whoops.

12:43.328 --> 12:45.509
The placebo batches were likely distributed.

12:45.529 --> 12:47.450
That would be the easiest way to pull this off.

12:47.510 --> 12:50.131
And transfection in healthy humans was always dumb.

12:50.511 --> 12:59.095
The same people that keep ignoring that the protocols were murder from the supplemental oxygen at 60 liters a minute all the way to the end.

12:59.635 --> 13:02.436
Gain of function is a mythology and it always has been.

13:02.496 --> 13:05.398
All you need to do is publish papers about it and it's real.

13:06.298 --> 13:35.052
and then the Scooby-Doo mystery that we were tricked into solving is what's getting us to constantly revolve back to people like Tony Fauci and Bill Gates and Peter Daszak, who I totally agree, they need to be thrown into a woodchipper, but that's not where we stop, because it's the masterminds of these ideas that we need to identify and we need to put in the woodchipper, at least from the perspective of our culture and from our leadership,

13:35.572 --> 13:40.203
Because it is a spectacular commitment to these lies that these guys have crafted.

13:41.185 --> 13:42.708
That's all that's required right now.

13:44.502 --> 13:48.345
And they're using weaponized piles of money to get us to argue about these things.

13:48.425 --> 13:54.370
And when we argue about what they want us to argue about, then we accept the premises of their arguments.

13:55.270 --> 14:00.254
That's what Noam Chomsky and this Edward Bernays guys were talking about.

14:00.314 --> 14:04.958
We are governed by this theater where the argument on mainstream media and social media

14:05.862 --> 14:07.082
is governed by them.

14:07.943 --> 14:15.865
And as long as you jump into their mud pit and fight on their terms, then you're accepting their mythologies.

14:19.966 --> 14:29.569
And the way that the only fight resistance that they have against us at this point, as we can see them so clearly, is to attribute bad motives to us.

14:29.629 --> 14:30.810
And that's what they will do now.

14:31.963 --> 14:35.684
for the remainder of the show, basically.

14:36.744 --> 14:51.546
Because as long as these weaponized piles of money continue to dominate, I don't care if they're from Venice and you can see them because they all have lions behind them, or if they're from the city of London, I don't really necessarily need to be shown that.

14:51.646 --> 15:00.028
I just know for sure that we are not dealing with grassroots Americans fighting for America, patriots running for office, this kind of thing.

15:01.434 --> 15:17.684
And it's because these same people for decades have been interested in ultimately where we are now, where we can collect data about genomes, or at least they can tell stories that they can and feed it into AIs, which might get us back to collecting more data or something, I don't know.

15:18.744 --> 15:20.986
The point is, is that if you get into the history,

15:24.727 --> 15:33.292
If you get into the history of these people and you get into the history of these ideas, you can see how we've been stuck in the mud here for 30 years or more.

15:33.492 --> 15:45.360
Maybe even two generations we've been stuck in the mud with these bad ideas that originated around the end of World War II and are the foundation of the vaccine schedule, which is especially criminal in America.

15:46.775 --> 15:49.636
And we inherited the power that they have over us.

15:49.676 --> 15:51.537
That was an inherited situation.

15:51.557 --> 15:56.619
We got that from our parents, because our parents were already bamboozled by these people's mentors.

15:56.659 --> 16:06.624
And that's why I think Mark Kulak's work is so important at Housatonic Live, because the mentors of these people need to be sort of accurately mapped together.

16:06.684 --> 16:09.465
And I think he's one of the few people that's at least trying to do that.

16:09.505 --> 16:12.587
I mean, if there's someone else trying to do that, I'd love to see who they are.

16:13.928 --> 16:17.511
The other problem is that there are charlatans that are pretending to be heroes.

16:18.532 --> 16:27.301
And in so doing, they are perpetuating the exact same mythology that the national biosecurity state wants us to teach our children.

16:28.302 --> 16:34.408
And so if we're going to save our kids from this, we've got to see through all of their illusions, even the multi-generational illusions.

16:35.171 --> 16:46.838
And if we're going to make gentle the life of this world, the life of our kids, as we break out of this mythology, we're going to have to teach them how social media is actually a illusion of consensus.

16:46.918 --> 16:49.540
It's a wave of consensus that appears out of nowhere.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.821
And you think it's a wave, but it's not.

16:51.921 --> 16:52.661
It's a fake wave.

16:52.741 --> 16:54.482
It's got a train over there that's pushing it.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.304
It's got a blade under the water.

16:56.384 --> 16:59.325
It's moving away from the shallow instead of going toward it.

16:59.826 --> 17:00.866
And so it's a fake wave.

17:00.906 --> 17:03.668
And you can think you're surfing right now, and it might be useful for

17:04.228 --> 17:05.969
getting into arguments and stuff like that.

17:06.009 --> 17:12.732
But when you get back to the real world, you need to realize that the waves you've been surfing on on social media are an illusion.

17:13.713 --> 17:27.219
And if those waves are a series of questions, if those waves are a series of assumptions, and then you leave and go into the regular world with those assumptions, you could be vulnerable to enslavement.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.323
If you wanna stay away from that, you gotta stay focused on the biology.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.004
You can't take the bait on social media.

17:33.024 --> 17:37.887
Maybe you have to get off of it entirely and focus on teaching your kids to love their neighbors.

17:39.155 --> 17:46.623
It's especially a American-made message, American-born, American-made message, but it's for the whole world.

17:47.665 --> 17:54.052
It's for all humans that want to listen, because we are team human over here at GigaOM Biological.

17:54.713 --> 17:56.935
And the way this works is I need people to share the stream.

17:56.955 --> 17:58.016
You're just not doing enough.

17:59.057 --> 18:01.900
I don't need you to send me money, although that would be great if you want to.

18:02.161 --> 18:03.122
That would be wonderful.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.066
But what I really need is people to share the work, because we're not getting anywhere.

18:07.106 --> 18:12.011
This is not going anywhere, and it's not because we're not doing a good jazz show here.

18:12.051 --> 18:16.575
It's because somehow or another there's resistance, which means everybody's got to push.

18:16.715 --> 18:18.757
This is like trying to get water to flow uphill.

18:19.358 --> 18:24.103
And so if everybody's not gonna do their part, it's just, it's not gonna happen.

18:25.184 --> 18:30.149
There's not gonna be any spontaneous explosion of gigaohm biological around the world.

18:30.229 --> 18:40.779
It's gonna happen when each and every one of you starts sending an email with a single link in it saying, hey, go to this stream.gigaohm.bio and check out any of the videos.

18:41.500 --> 18:54.229
This biology teacher there is somebody that I listen to and I really like his interpretation about how the paradigm shift could work for our kids instead of against our kids.

18:54.269 --> 18:55.290
That's really what I want.

18:55.870 --> 19:00.974
I want the paradigm shift that these monkeys are trying to initiate with a bunch of chaos.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.536
I want that paradigm shift to help our kids pull their hands down.

19:04.576 --> 19:08.299
I want this to help our kids engage in informed non-compliance.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.681
And so I want to teach

19:12.588 --> 19:22.820
high school kids and college kids a 30,000 foot view of biology that allows them to engage in non-compliance against public health for the rest of their lives.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.582
That's the goal of GigaOM Biological.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.424
I hope you'll help me share this work.

19:32.073 --> 19:32.133
so

19:58.237 --> 19:59.318
Good morning, everybody.

19:59.358 --> 20:01.560
It is not just just morning.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.643
It is 1157 on the 13th of July.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.364
It's Saturday.

20:05.424 --> 20:09.388
I don't normally have a show scheduled, but I do have an empty house.

20:09.468 --> 20:11.250
And so it's I got plenty of time.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.772
I have no excuse not to be here.

20:13.572 --> 20:15.414
Ladies and gentlemen, I am a human just like you.

20:15.454 --> 20:16.936
I think biology is the way out.

20:17.056 --> 20:19.618
And so I do this stream as often as I possibly can.

20:20.359 --> 20:27.846
to teach the biology that edifies the following three basic declarations or statements.

20:27.966 --> 20:29.287
And I'm happy.

20:29.367 --> 20:30.629
I would be thrilled.

20:31.627 --> 20:43.557
If someone with the requisite knowledge could explain to me the exceptions to the first one, if there are any, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

20:44.057 --> 20:54.446
Quite frankly, I think there are places and times, like in advanced cancer, when injecting a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system might work for a time

20:55.026 --> 20:58.148
to prolong the life of somebody who was already going to die.

20:58.648 --> 21:06.632
On the other hand, I think the important thing to realize is that we're talking about the augmentation of healthy children, healthy newborn babies.

21:07.192 --> 21:14.816
These are the kinds of absolute mythologies that need to be dispelled once and for all, not for a few weeks, but for generations to come.

21:15.396 --> 21:24.261
Transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and this is a lesson that every academic biologist and every

21:24.981 --> 21:35.207
academic medical scientist in every university in America and around the Western world needs to come to the humble conclusion that this is true.

21:35.247 --> 21:44.852
And the final one is, of course, that RNA cannot pandemic, and there is no explanation for how it can, especially if that explanation involves fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts.

21:45.413 --> 21:52.717
So at this stage where we are, and we must realize this soon so that we can teach our kids effectively before they can't remember it anymore,

21:53.297 --> 22:10.200
Remember, as older adults, our memory of our recent experience is a little bit better and a little more focused and a little bit more in context with the rest of our lives than it is for our younger people, especially those that sort of broke into adulthood while they were going back to university.

22:10.260 --> 22:10.920
Think about this.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.101
People were freshmen in college in the fall of 2020.

22:14.141 --> 22:18.361
I mean, think about how mentally

22:23.769 --> 22:28.351
traumatized those children are because those parents didn't tell them to stay home.

22:28.971 --> 22:37.795
Those parents put them into the, at the mercy of these absolutely perverted and abominated universities in America and so

22:38.993 --> 22:42.436
We have a real big problem here because the young people need rescuing.

22:43.097 --> 22:44.078
They need this truth.

22:44.218 --> 22:48.763
They need the truth that the government lies to them and that it has been lying to us for generations.

22:49.243 --> 22:53.407
We need people alive who can still tell the story of Vietnam to tell it.

22:53.948 --> 22:57.491
We need people who are still alive who can tell these stories to tell them.

22:58.308 --> 23:08.198
because it is these lived experiences that they also, you know, conveniently kind of got rid of with a lot of those, you know, focused vaccination campaigns and continuing to focus.

23:08.979 --> 23:21.371
I just want to let you know that, for example, at my gym where the boys and I go, I told you a story probably a month and a half ago of a guy that works there that had coached at over 20 different universities, or maybe it was only 12.

23:23.052 --> 23:26.294
And so he said that he had spent more time in the gym than anybody he knew.

23:26.314 --> 23:36.438
He got a shingles vaccine and he isn't able to sleep anymore because he has this shooting pain from the top of his head that runs down his arm and goes back into the spine and the shoulder.

23:36.478 --> 23:40.239
And it's some kind of spinal, I don't know what they call it.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.740
I used to know, I mean, I wrote it down.

23:43.060 --> 23:46.882
I looked it up at one point in time and it didn't go away so much so that he's now retiring.

23:49.225 --> 23:55.467
And it's a heartbreaking thing because I swear on, I mean, I know that this is true.

23:56.708 --> 24:05.391
This guy won't talk to me anymore about his pain because he doesn't want to talk about the fact that it comes from the single shot.

24:05.871 --> 24:10.913
And so he's not telling everybody why he's retiring, but he knows that I know.

24:11.053 --> 24:17.255
And you can see that I let a huge weight go off of his shoulders when I,

24:18.649 --> 24:19.950
when I don't ask about it.

24:21.691 --> 24:24.133
And every day that I see him and he says, hey, how are you?

24:24.173 --> 24:29.017
You know, it's like, he's cringing to see if I'm gonna ask him why he's still moving like this.

24:29.037 --> 24:31.819
Of course I know why he's still moving like that.

24:34.059 --> 24:41.983
And so the social media platforms are part of this and the people on them, this is the most important part, it's not just the algorithm.

24:42.584 --> 24:48.827
They don't just use the algorithm to shuffle the really smart people out of the way so that everybody stays dumb.

24:51.377 --> 24:52.918
they have actually put people there.

24:53.439 --> 24:54.339
Of course they did.

24:54.940 --> 25:05.028
They weren't gonna let the internet become a spontaneously populated group of people communicating spontaneously depending on how, you know, their message caught on.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.029
That's not, that cannot possibly be.

25:08.109 --> 25:11.170
what they did with any of these social media platforms.

25:11.190 --> 25:18.893
And once you see it for what it is, they put fake accounts there and they put real live people there with the goal of bamboozling us.

25:19.673 --> 25:22.594
These weaponized piles of money are part of the governance structure.

25:23.034 --> 25:31.137
And that's why it's very important to see that Noam Chomsky and Edward Bernays

25:32.944 --> 25:36.565
These people have been telling us for generations that this is how we are governed.

25:36.625 --> 25:41.606
The real way that we are governed is by a limited spectrum of debate and a lively debate within it.

25:43.827 --> 25:53.029
That's why I hammer home the fact that this guy was put in place because they needed people in place, but Brett Weinstein was put in place earlier.

25:53.109 --> 25:54.889
Sam Harris put in place earlier.

25:55.289 --> 25:57.510
The intellectual dark web put in place earlier.

25:57.570 --> 26:00.971
This all happened in the context of this

26:02.728 --> 26:11.198
ongoing struggle to invert our sovereignty and whatever's left of it here in America into permanent enslavement for our children.

26:12.199 --> 26:18.646
And that's why I think that this is the most apt way to say it, a quote from Thomas Sowell.

26:19.387 --> 26:23.412
These people are misleading our children and they're doing it on podcasts.

26:25.421 --> 26:30.332
that millions of people watch because that's the clips that circulate on Instagram.

26:30.372 --> 26:33.018
Not Jeff from Earth's clips, but these clips.

26:34.380 --> 26:39.902
That's the clips that circulate on every social media platform because it's by design.

26:39.942 --> 26:41.462
They can program that to happen.

26:41.482 --> 26:52.885
And that's the same reason why all of these people rose to prominence, not because they had the right message or because they put out so many great Substack articles, it's because the program was there.

26:52.905 --> 27:00.007
The artificial network of people that was gonna agree to argue with each other and agree to focus on each other.

27:00.067 --> 27:01.628
That was all part of this show.

27:05.600 --> 27:15.168
And the mirror reflection of that is how some of these people on this screen have never talked about each other in a useful and critical way.

27:17.970 --> 27:27.558
How in three and a half years, somebody in Japan who says burn it all down has never really talked critically of Robert Malone until this year.

27:27.598 --> 27:28.759
I mean, it's comical.

27:31.035 --> 27:43.106
How, on the other hand, George Webb was amplified by Robert Malone, where Robert Malone has even done a substack about his 60 Minutes episode and shared the link to the CBS archive of it.

27:45.668 --> 27:53.816
And once you see what that is, that's Robert Malone telling his one million subscribers that if you're going to pay attention to anybody, pay attention to George Webb, and here's why.

27:55.339 --> 27:59.942
You can see why this has been a Lollapalooza of liars, a coordinated Lollapalooza of liars.

27:59.982 --> 28:01.183
They're meeting backstage.

28:05.445 --> 28:14.691
That's why no matter which stage you go to for the next, you know, set or whatever, it's like, ah, this is eerily similar to the last band we saw.

28:16.158 --> 28:19.721
Different take on one idea, but the rest is the same.

28:20.242 --> 28:31.532
This guy, for example, could have told anyone, could have had me on the show because I was the one telling him it in 2021, that we had to teach people what transfection and transformation was.

28:32.974 --> 28:39.780
We might have even gotten to transduction and had a three T words that we would teach everybody the history of.

28:42.366 --> 28:44.687
But instead, this guy tried to drive me bananas.

28:44.747 --> 28:50.608
And eventually him and other people coordinated some kind of drama where other people were leaving the signal chat, because they were also mad.

28:50.648 --> 28:55.390
And so then I followed them, thinking that they agreed with me that Bret Weinstein was obfuscating things.

28:56.570 --> 29:00.351
And they still were part of this theater, this giant theater of liars.

29:00.391 --> 29:01.911
And you think, oh, I don't like this stage.

29:01.931 --> 29:02.952
I'm going to go to another stage.

29:03.012 --> 29:04.072
Oh, these people rock.

29:05.612 --> 29:06.813
They're all taking the same money.

29:09.244 --> 29:15.806
Doesn't matter who you think rocks and who you don't think rocks, if all these bands are gonna get onto the same bus and drive away laughing.

29:18.527 --> 29:19.107
And they are.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.527
They're all gonna get on the gain of function bus.

29:23.428 --> 29:29.170
They've all been on the gain of function bus, the incapacitating agent bus.

29:29.210 --> 29:35.791
It's an incapacitating agent, but it's also causes prions and amyloid and clotting and heart attacks.

29:35.891 --> 29:37.392
And the list is endless.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.905
crosses the blood-brain barrier.

29:39.965 --> 29:46.628
No, no, it goes up the nose and it goes right up the nose and right up the olfactory nerve.

29:48.989 --> 29:52.391
And none of these people in four and a half years will address any of these points.

29:52.431 --> 29:53.471
They won't even touch them.

29:55.072 --> 29:56.933
Well, these cooies write about these things.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.057
And how are they doing it?

30:05.097 --> 30:15.625
They're doing it with this extended, you know, song and dance about what something that happened in 2019, I guess, you know, it might've happened a little earlier than 2020, and we call it a pandemic.

30:16.406 --> 30:19.108
And we can follow it around, you know, we can see it.

30:19.288 --> 30:31.398
It's probably come from a gain-of-function laboratory, and it's changed over the course of these times, and we're waiting for a highly infectious variant of Omicron to come, according to Geert van den Bosch.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.559
These people created this illusion, all of them together.

30:37.481 --> 30:38.663
It wasn't an argument.

30:40.025 --> 30:40.906
It wasn't a fight.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.047
It wasn't a resistance.

30:42.968 --> 30:43.729
It was a theater.

30:45.452 --> 30:49.997
Geert van den Bosch, Merrill Nass, Robert Malone, all of them.

30:51.084 --> 30:52.364
All of them, unfortunately.

30:52.424 --> 30:53.765
That's the terrible part of it.

30:53.805 --> 31:09.508
It's all of them that are still pushing this worst case scenario with this illusion of consensus about what happened, about what happening, about long COVID, about COVID, about the shots, and who's gonna rescue us, who's coming to save us before they kill us all.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.288
These are all the same things that everybody's saying.

31:12.328 --> 31:19.410
If you say incapacitating agent or prions, or if you say avian flu is real, but it's not dangerous, you're still saying all the same shit.

31:23.905 --> 31:28.166
And the way they get away with it is they don't ever scrutinize what they were doing in 2020 and 2021.

31:28.527 --> 31:30.807
We don't scrutinize what they said.

31:30.867 --> 31:40.151
We don't realize that in those two years, these people got us onto this train of solving the mystery, of accepting their argument.

31:40.211 --> 31:41.131
That was their job.

31:43.166 --> 31:47.810
to make sure that everybody paid attention, that it sure looks like these emails look like a coverup.

31:48.311 --> 31:49.231
Everybody paid attention.

31:49.291 --> 31:55.017
It looks like that discussion in the Senate sure is an argument between Rand Paul and Tony Fauci.

31:55.037 --> 31:56.458
It looks like Fauci got burned.

32:00.165 --> 32:21.315
And this faith in the novel virus that's continuing to circulate the globe, that is preached by Human Genome Project entrepreneur Kevin McKernan, and Tony Fauci, and Peter Daszak, and most of the rest of the quote-unquote resistance, is the evidence of the faith.

32:23.536 --> 32:27.698
It's very, very simple to see, once you see it, that none of them contradict this faith.

32:29.946 --> 32:30.546
Don't talk about 2020.

32:30.986 --> 32:36.349
I think we ran out again.

32:37.109 --> 32:38.050
Just do that quick.

32:47.474 --> 32:48.214
This is the faith.

32:48.354 --> 32:50.115
This is the faith that they keep protecting.

32:51.216 --> 32:52.136
We're in the car with them.

32:52.156 --> 32:53.276
We have to stop the car.

32:53.336 --> 32:54.197
We have to get out.

32:56.622 --> 32:59.666
and make sure that nobody else gets in the car with them again.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.229
They can't just let them drive on and go pick up other people.

33:04.271 --> 33:06.394
We got to stop them from giving people rides.

33:06.474 --> 33:10.539
We got to start getting people to realize that they don't talk about any of these people.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.142
They don't talk about any of these things.

33:15.250 --> 33:21.311
And the reason why is because a lot of the policies, a lot of the ideas can be seen in these people's behavior.

33:21.411 --> 33:32.673
The idea that we wanted medical data to be centralized, the idea that we knew we needed to start testing people, sampling people, we don't know to what extent they've gone and how far they've gone with it.

33:33.894 --> 33:40.735
Especially because the only information we really have is that that's publicly available, which we already know is not exhaustive.

33:43.096 --> 33:44.956
Now, I don't want to talk about dead people.

33:46.172 --> 33:58.776
But Joshua Lederberg is somebody that you can use to, you know, if you have a point over there and then another point over here and then another point over there and they all line up intellectually, then it's important.

33:58.916 --> 34:14.040
And Joshua Lederberg is one of these people that's got like a nice history line that goes right back intellectually through a lot of these things that if that line, which is defined by Joshua Lederberg fits through a bunch of living people,

34:15.486 --> 34:26.536
then we have to see it for what it is, a continuous line of thought, a continuous line of reasoning about how humans just morally might as well be thought of as experimental animals.

34:26.716 --> 34:31.640
And we can, as long as we think about it the right way and talk about it the right way.

34:31.680 --> 34:38.046
And so that line is why Joshua Lederberg is important, even though he is currently a dead dude.

34:39.807 --> 34:49.937
And that's another reason why it's very conspicuous that these people haven't been able to give us a kind of insight into the history of these ideas that people like Mark Kulak have.

34:54.783 --> 34:57.145
And so that repeated again, I got to check that better.

34:57.205 --> 35:00.908
So anyway, I just wanted to make sure you realize that I'm still mentioning names.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.150
I still think it's really important to mention names.

35:03.731 --> 35:10.596
And I still think it's really important what we did about four or five days ago when we looked at a two part series.

35:11.617 --> 35:18.462
with Robert Malone on Vajon Health in 2021, because he said a lot of things that he never really repeated.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.344
And some of those things are summarized here in this slide.

35:21.384 --> 35:23.405
Number one, he said he worked on retroviruses.

35:23.445 --> 35:28.869
He had a very big enthusiasm for using retroviruses for genetic therapy.

35:29.249 --> 35:29.949
Yes, that's right.

35:29.969 --> 35:31.050
He said genetic therapy.

35:31.971 --> 35:34.152
The guy did not say genetic engineering.

35:34.172 --> 35:41.037
He said genetic therapy, which is the term that was, of course, described in the Joshua Lederberg article with

35:43.080 --> 35:49.570
Mr. Wolf, Mr. Wolf being the whole, maybe he's a doctor, but Mr. Wolf being the guy who, is it?

35:50.470 --> 35:56.875
It's something A. Wolf, I can't remember if it's Richard A. Wolf or, I'm sorry, I would have to look and I don't wanna click out.

35:57.756 --> 36:06.602
The point is, is that that guy's the first author on the transformation paper, the Naked DNA paper, and Robert Malone never mentions him.

36:08.023 --> 36:15.889
And in this case, that guy wrote a review four years after that article with Joshua Lederberg, which I would say is a,

36:18.160 --> 36:20.621
is a very big badge of honor.

36:20.641 --> 36:31.905
I mean, you know, I worked with Edward Moser and Maybritt Moser for many years and they've held my children when they were babies.

36:32.225 --> 36:43.729
And those people will never call me up to do a review about biology when they have current students and they have current postdocs and they have, you know, current collaborators and whatever, they'll never call me up.

36:44.749 --> 36:51.411
And so when somebody like Joshua Lederberg says, hey, let's write a review together, that's a very big hat tip.

36:51.551 --> 37:03.635
And so Robert Malone says he was interested specifically and did his, I don't know, some of his graduate work on packaging sequences, which I'm going to spend the next few days trying to put into the context of

37:04.515 --> 37:24.189
of the biology metaphor of computers because a lot of energy is spent in neurobiology and a lot of energy is spent in molecular biology thinking on and off about these molecular and cellular processes as having a homologue in computers.

37:24.329 --> 37:31.254
In other words, thinking about how a computer works we can learn how the brain works or if we use computer as a model of how

37:32.472 --> 37:39.038
thinking might occur, then I guess we can look for analogous parts of a computer in the brain or vice versa.

37:39.118 --> 37:48.486
And they've also thought about this with regard to molecules and genes, how genes are signals or translated and how molecular signals can be done.

37:48.947 --> 37:52.550
And so these metaphors are terrible, right?

37:52.590 --> 37:56.854
Little molecular machines is what they think of cellular machinery as just a little clock.

37:57.654 --> 37:59.035
And all of these metaphors

38:00.267 --> 38:14.092
fall short of capturing the irreducible complexity and acknowledging it, but rather try to talk around it and ignore it and oversimplify what we know into something that can be used to bamboozle us and our children.

38:15.129 --> 38:21.774
And this is a part of it, this idea of virology and what it means, how it fits in with us.

38:22.255 --> 38:28.019
And the best analogy that I've come up with is this idea that you can't make a cuckoo clock make toast.

38:28.099 --> 38:29.080
I won't do that here.

38:29.640 --> 38:40.449
But again, he also says that he suffered PTSD because he was so ethically superior compared to the way that that lab was structured and the way that people treated his intellectual property.

38:41.470 --> 38:56.224
And after several setbacks, he eventually became employed by DITRA and DOD and gave speeches in front of the WHO, presentations at the WHO, and chaired study sections where he gave away or helped people

38:57.024 --> 38:59.325
write grants for the tune of more than $50 billion.

39:00.585 --> 39:16.369
He won't touch Judy Mikovits, hasn't really talked about her, even though I think she descends directly from the same mentor chain, idea chain of old white men, which I find very, very curious from the perspective of them also being in music videos together.

39:16.389 --> 39:20.810
And he also did a music, no, it's not a music video, it's like a,

39:21.830 --> 39:39.677
a overproduced video in the mountains of Spain in 2021, talking about GERD and talking with GERD about how the limited transfection to the spike, and they didn't use that word, might cause the virus to mutate or to evolve, yada, yada, yada.

39:39.737 --> 39:43.679
If you want to find out more about these people, please go to houstatonicits.com.

39:44.099 --> 39:46.560
I think that's probably the best database that you can look at.

39:56.276 --> 39:58.958
Now I was going to talk about this email that I got.

39:59.618 --> 40:00.899
I got an email chain.

40:01.379 --> 40:10.526
The last few days, let's say a week and a half or so, I've been getting an email that I paid attention to and then I missed it again and then I paid attention to it again because it came with another Adenim.

40:10.566 --> 40:14.929
But we've got this really, I think, very clever follower.

40:16.755 --> 40:21.917
first name with an A, and that's all I'll say for now so that the person knows who I'm talking about.

40:22.137 --> 40:33.360
And they gave me a lot of very handy information, ideas, analogies, and in-depth analogies with regard to computer programming, computer signaling, this kind of thing.

40:33.520 --> 40:42.403
And I think that my friend Mark Kulak is also going to really appreciate these analogies, but they just appeared in my email box, or the best one in my humble opinion.

40:43.500 --> 40:49.885
that really caught my attention and made me understand the rest of them better, appeared in my email box this morning.

40:49.925 --> 40:57.890
So I thought even briefly about not doing Elon Musk is a not a visionary today because it was so important.

40:57.910 --> 41:08.057
But instead, I think it's more important for me to do this because I have it planned and delve a little deeper into how to use the entire set of analogies that he put in those emails.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.218
But cheers for that.

41:09.839 --> 41:10.799
It's a real goldmine.

41:10.839 --> 41:11.360
I really love it.

41:12.555 --> 41:24.460
So the reason why I want to do Elon Musk is not a visionary is because he did a recent video two days ago or three days ago with an update on Neuralink.

41:24.720 --> 41:31.904
And I want to take a hard look at this first, like in a study hall sense.

41:32.404 --> 41:34.705
It's like a 39-minute video, so it's not that long.

41:35.305 --> 41:37.286
But given my style, it'll take us an hour.

41:38.566 --> 41:41.628
But I want you to see the kinds of things he's representing.

41:42.830 --> 41:47.832
Then I want to show you a very brief news report from Colorado.

41:48.993 --> 42:04.260
And then tomorrow, I think we can summarize what we do today and then do a journal club about a paper for which I have a great deal of background and can explain probably in a good enough way to

42:07.102 --> 42:10.645
sort of emphasize the ridiculousness of what we'll cover today.

42:10.805 --> 42:14.589
So again, we're going to cover this today, and it's two videos.

42:14.729 --> 42:23.977
One video of Elon Musk and his Neuralink team that just got up on YouTube a couple days ago, and then a Colorado news program from a couple days ago.

42:24.918 --> 42:42.913
And then tomorrow we're going to again use this as a stepping stone to do a detailed journal club about a very particular paper in my previous, you know, I guess you could call it current still, specialty neurobiology and the study of spatial awareness and spatial coding and memory in the brain.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.602
And so I think it'll be a really nice program tomorrow.

42:46.642 --> 43:02.065
I like the idea of Sunday being a program where we really appreciate the irreducible complexity and try to get a good handle on how we can see it, even in the literature of, primary literature of neurobiology.

43:02.125 --> 43:06.445
So without further ado, Elon Musk is not a visionary part one.

43:06.505 --> 43:08.986
Again, we're gonna start with a video of the,

43:10.787 --> 43:14.589
the recent Neuralink thing, a massive Neuralink update was the title.

43:14.609 --> 43:14.809
Welcome.

43:14.849 --> 43:15.630
I hope this is working.

43:15.790 --> 43:17.671
Welcome to Neuralink live update.

43:17.811 --> 43:20.233
We're going to tell you about the progress.

43:20.273 --> 43:21.674
Sorry for the volume there.

43:21.694 --> 43:22.454
My bad.

43:22.674 --> 43:25.036
And a recap of the progress there.

43:25.276 --> 43:32.541
Then talk about what changes we were making for the second patient, which we're hoping to do an implant in the next week or so.

43:32.741 --> 43:38.745
And this is for our first product, which is called Telepathy, which enables you to control a computer or a phone just by thinking.

43:39.045 --> 43:41.606
So let's, in fact, so we'll start off with just some introductions.

43:41.766 --> 43:42.427
DJ, you want to start?

43:42.567 --> 43:43.027
Hi, everyone.

43:43.147 --> 43:44.187
My name is DJ Seo.

43:44.467 --> 43:46.848
I'm an electrical engineer and a chip designer by training.

43:47.129 --> 43:51.710
I led the design of first several generations of the Neuralink implant.

43:51.891 --> 43:54.512
Currently, I was on the founding team and currently a president.

43:54.692 --> 43:55.532
I'm Matthew McDougall.

43:55.612 --> 43:59.034
I'm a practicing neurosurgeon and head of neurosurgery at Neuralink.

43:59.454 --> 43:59.994
Yeah, go ahead.

44:00.536 --> 44:02.138
Head of Brain Interfaces Applications.

44:02.378 --> 44:02.818
And I'm Bliss.

44:02.898 --> 44:06.882
I'm a software engineer at Neuralink, trying to figure out how to turn brain activity into cool stuff in the world.

44:06.902 --> 44:07.843
All right, thank you.

44:07.943 --> 44:08.223
Let's see.

44:08.263 --> 44:10.205
So we'll just get going into the presentation.

44:10.605 --> 44:18.432
Our first product is something, like I said, we call telepathy, which enables the person with the Neuralink implant to control their phone or computer just by thinking.

44:18.632 --> 44:23.936
And once you can control your phone or computer, you can essentially control almost anything, literally just by thinking.

44:24.016 --> 44:25.878
So there's no eye tracking or anything.

44:25.938 --> 44:26.939
It is purely your thoughts.

44:27.339 --> 44:33.764
This is really quite a profound device that can help a lot of people who have lost the connection between their brain and body.

44:34.044 --> 44:40.590
Imagine people like Stephen Hawking who, imagine if he could communicate at the same speed as someone who still had the connection to their brain and body.

44:40.670 --> 44:43.992
Now remember that Stephen Hawking could communicate at the same speed.

44:44.012 --> 44:46.194
He could probably talk faster than half America.

44:47.335 --> 44:48.936
With his little speak and spell thing.

44:49.797 --> 44:50.998
I don't know if that was real.

44:51.278 --> 44:52.098
I assume it was.

44:53.106 --> 44:54.807
I got something caught in my pen here.

44:54.827 --> 44:56.088
I gotta pull out quick.

44:56.628 --> 44:56.908
Shit.

44:57.449 --> 44:58.309
Excuse my language.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.551
Darn it, I don't know what's stuck in there.

45:01.591 --> 45:04.933
It's some kind of piece of paper that's getting me all messed up.

45:06.194 --> 45:06.855
Did that come out?

45:09.556 --> 45:09.816
No.

45:11.517 --> 45:12.158
Get out.

45:15.006 --> 45:15.686
Okay, there went out.

45:16.726 --> 45:18.727
So our first product is telepathy.

45:18.867 --> 45:23.988
So generalized brain interface to restore autonomy, those with unmet medical needs.

45:24.648 --> 45:31.210
So again, this is something that he's trying to tell you wasn't already solved in Stephen Hawking.

45:31.270 --> 45:37.331
Imagine if Stephen Hawking could move his mouse without having to, you know, use the remaining muscles that he has.

45:39.076 --> 45:43.798
Imagine if Stephen Hawking, you know, this kind of thing is absolutely ridiculous.

45:43.918 --> 45:46.959
And by the end of this show, I'm going to have you convinced.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.100
But they call it telepathy.

45:49.200 --> 45:53.202
Telepathy would be more from the Dungeons and Dragons perspective.

45:53.262 --> 45:59.105
Telepathy is the ability to send thoughts or read thoughts of somebody else.

45:59.185 --> 46:03.067
So he's already using the word incorrectly from its previous definition.

46:03.087 --> 46:03.447
And I'm not,

46:04.187 --> 46:06.611
I'm not saying the Dungeons and Dragons defines anything.

46:06.651 --> 46:15.303
I'm just saying that a lot of these words are very well defined in mythologies that have existed for decades and decades.

46:15.343 --> 46:18.628
And those mythologies, whether you like it or not, often were

46:20.029 --> 46:22.190
collected all in that game Dungeons and Dragons.

46:22.250 --> 46:24.391
And one of these, you know, there were spells.

46:24.451 --> 46:28.393
There were teleportation, telepathy, telekinesis.

46:28.433 --> 46:31.114
These are all words that have very specific meanings.

46:31.754 --> 46:34.996
Teleportation, you move from one place to another instantaneously.

46:35.036 --> 46:36.377
The movie Fly is about that.

46:36.837 --> 46:41.619
Telepathy should be reading thoughts, sharing thoughts, or even imposing thoughts.

46:42.159 --> 46:46.721
And then telekinesis would be the ability to move objects with your mind.

46:47.241 --> 46:51.703
So the idea of telepathy is already, it's already wrong.

46:51.763 --> 46:52.603
It's already dumb.

46:52.683 --> 46:55.764
It should be called telekinesis then because they're going to move the mouse.

46:55.804 --> 46:56.885
They're going to move a keyboard.

46:56.925 --> 46:58.085
They're going to type.

46:58.145 --> 47:00.106
They're going to do silly things.

47:01.311 --> 47:02.132
Listen carefully.

47:03.072 --> 47:05.914
It's really something that can help millions of people around the world.

47:06.354 --> 47:16.301
Help millions of people around the world give them something that they then become dependent on instead of finding a way to empower them to work despite their handicap.

47:16.722 --> 47:19.944
Do you see how extraordinarily lame this is?

47:20.998 --> 47:28.663
It's part of our overall goal of enabling very high bandwidth connection between the brain and the rest of the world and your computers.

47:28.883 --> 47:40.010
The long-term goal, which sounds a little esoteric, is to mitigate the risk of AI by having a closer symbiosis between human intelligence and digital intelligence.

47:40.590 --> 47:40.770
Oh.

47:41.631 --> 47:41.791
Oh.

47:44.092 --> 47:44.813
Oh my gosh.

47:48.939 --> 48:04.171
He thinks that if we get ahead of the AI and we make a useful brain-mind interface before AI becomes fully conscious and crazy, that we will have a better chance of containing it in the future.

48:05.051 --> 48:05.752
Stop lying!

48:06.232 --> 48:08.514
I mean, that's just, that is hilarious.

48:08.574 --> 48:17.641
I should have had bourbon or something here because I would be laughing uncontrollably right now, but instead I'm in my usual mode of, oh my gosh, this guy drives me bananas.

48:21.833 --> 48:29.642
It's part of our overall goal of enabling very high bandwidth connection between the brain and the rest of the world and your computers.

48:29.862 --> 48:40.994
The long-term goal, which sounds a little esoteric, is to mitigate the risk of AI by having a closer symbiosis between human intelligence and digital intelligence.

48:41.234 --> 48:42.696
But that'll take many years.

48:42.776 --> 48:50.162
Because putting electrodes in somebody's brain or a mouse's brain is a closer symbiosis between the computer and the brain.

48:50.222 --> 49:02.513
So when neuroscientists put electrodes in rats and watch them walk around in a box, that is a closer symbiosis between machine and animal than the day before.

49:04.793 --> 49:28.267
I mean, this kind of mythology can only work on really, really misinformed people or people that use social media at a skilled level so that this illusion of consensus is so overwhelming that so many people like Brett Weinstein and Alexandros Marinos and Chris Martinson and Jordan Peterson all agree that Elon Musk is like a super genius.

49:28.687 --> 49:57.842
then when he goes on on any of these places and says any of these things and all of these people are standing behind them going yeah yeah yeah for a fat paycheck and fame he is selling the worst kind of lie here because it is misleading only kids and adults that don't have the requisite knowledge to know how ridiculous this is that's why we have to we have to hit here hard and often

49:58.666 --> 50:00.267
This illusion can be broken.

50:00.327 --> 50:04.711
He's masquerading as a renaissance man.

50:05.512 --> 50:11.097
Maybe not that dissimilar from how Robert Malone is masquerading as a renaissance man.

50:12.178 --> 50:16.742
Along the way, we're going to help solve a lot of brain injury or spinal injury issues.

50:17.342 --> 50:20.983
And then with our first product, telepathy, that's going to be really quite profound.

50:21.323 --> 50:33.365
There is also potential long term for bridging the gaps if there are damaged or severed neurons, being able to span the gap between the brain's motor cortex to the spine to enable someone to use their body again.

50:33.585 --> 50:34.766
I think that would be very exciting.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.746
And it's... I would think that would be very exciting.

50:37.766 --> 50:41.527
And that's not anything that anyone in neuroscience didn't say already 30 years ago.

50:41.547 --> 50:44.888
That's not anything that Chris Reeve hasn't said a million times over.

50:45.448 --> 50:46.548
This is so silly.

50:47.208 --> 50:51.431
It's not like they're the first people to ever look at this as a problem.

50:51.451 --> 51:01.218
There are people who purposefully rip the part or cut the spine of rats to see if they can cause spontaneous rewiring and they've been doing it for a decade or more.

51:01.238 --> 51:02.098
Are you kidding me?

51:02.118 --> 51:06.962
This is just ridiculous.

51:08.843 --> 51:12.906
And again, it is malevolent because they are misleading our young with this dumb shit.

51:14.284 --> 51:16.525
That is something that is possible in the long term.

51:16.965 --> 51:28.347
And then our second product, which we've demonstrated to work with monkeys, is blindsight, which would enable someone who is completely blind, lost both eyes, or completely lost their optic nerve to be able to see.

51:28.607 --> 51:30.948
So that's something that we hope to demonstrate in the future.

51:31.388 --> 51:36.129
Think about all those different things that he said that they could fix, because they're not all the same.

51:36.889 --> 51:41.310
Somebody that has optic nerve damage still has all of the cortical wiring.

51:41.350 --> 51:51.473
I mean... Or bridging the gaps, if there are damaged or severed neurons, being able to span the gap between the brain's motor cortex to the spine to enable someone to use their body again.

51:51.673 --> 51:52.853
I think that would be very exciting.

51:53.153 --> 51:56.574
And that is something that is possible in the long term.

51:57.014 --> 52:05.997
And then our second product, which we've demonstrated to work with monkeys, is blindsight, which would enable... We've demonstrated works with monkeys.

52:09.352 --> 52:12.054
They've demonstrated it works with monkeys.

52:12.154 --> 52:14.255
My guess is that this is bullshit.

52:16.656 --> 52:19.198
My guess is this is a gigantic lie.

52:20.158 --> 52:24.281
Because if this was possible, it would be like Nobel Prize level.

52:25.737 --> 52:26.638
neurobiology.

52:27.398 --> 52:34.663
Like this, if what he is saying, and I'm decoding it correctly, this would be ridiculously badass.

52:34.863 --> 52:36.584
And of course, it's got to be a lie.

52:36.624 --> 52:37.625
I'm going to rewind 30.

52:37.665 --> 52:42.888
And it's that that is something that is possible in the long term.

52:43.348 --> 53:06.201
and then our second product which we've demonstrated to work with monkeys is blindsight which would enable someone who is completely blind lost both eyes or completely lost their optic nerve to be able to see so that's what they say he just claimed it right there that somebody who lost their eyes or had optic nerve damage could see again and they have what they have done it in monkeys

53:09.011 --> 53:18.875
Is he claiming that he severed the optic nerve of monkeys in an ethical experiment and then restored sight and is somehow able to see it?

53:20.315 --> 53:24.817
Because what, the monkey recognizes his friends again or the monkey can still play chess?

53:25.437 --> 53:26.538
How do they evaluate it?

53:26.578 --> 53:27.858
Where's that nature paper?

53:30.299 --> 53:32.100
That is a bold,

53:33.086 --> 53:47.849
bold claim to just kind of put in here as you know if you just you know if you walked out of the room a second or you you started drinking and you and you were swallowing too loud you might have missed that part

53:51.667 --> 53:53.908
to enable someone to use their body again.

53:54.128 --> 53:55.308
I think that would be very exciting.

53:55.609 --> 53:59.030
And that is something that is possible in the long term.

53:59.470 --> 54:10.834
And then our second product, which we've demonstrated to work with monkeys, is blindsight, which would enable someone who is completely blind, lost both eyes, or completely lost their optic nerve to be able to see.

54:11.114 --> 54:13.455
So that's something that we hope to demonstrate in the future.

54:13.695 --> 54:14.496
So this just gives you a sense.

54:14.556 --> 54:17.417
Wait, so they've done it in monkeys or not?

54:17.557 --> 54:19.778
Could they restore light sensitivity?

54:20.598 --> 54:20.818
Sure.

54:23.547 --> 54:31.474
But this claim that he just made and we hope to show it soon that they're gonna do it in people and blind people, it's not the same thing.

54:31.494 --> 54:36.438
Again, if you can restore light sensitivity, sure, that's great.

54:36.498 --> 54:37.839
That's not very hard, dude.

54:40.021 --> 54:43.183
But restore vision, get the nerves to regrow.

54:43.243 --> 54:46.946
These are all different kinds of claims that have nothing to do with neurons.

54:47.227 --> 54:49.629
I mean, electrodes and implants.

54:50.834 --> 54:54.498
And so we're doing all kinds of shell games here with what are we really talking about?

54:54.538 --> 54:56.239
What's our primary technology here?

54:56.740 --> 55:01.364
Is it a robot that does surgery and implants a little chip?

55:02.285 --> 55:07.590
Or is it a drug that restores neuronal growth or stimulates it?

55:07.750 --> 55:11.094
Or is it a wire that you put across, you know?

55:13.936 --> 55:16.878
This is just the biggest bunch of bullshit ever.

55:16.938 --> 55:17.499
So here we go.

55:17.559 --> 55:19.320
Surgical implant of the thing.

55:19.340 --> 55:20.721
There's the thing we're talking about.

55:21.222 --> 55:25.005
Neural decoding software to translate brain signals into useful output.

55:25.065 --> 55:25.665
So here we go.

55:26.246 --> 55:27.527
Let's see what he says about this.

55:28.167 --> 55:33.131
A way to think about the neural link device is like a Fitbit or an Apple watch with

55:33.371 --> 55:35.212
tiny wires or electrodes.

55:35.292 --> 55:40.073
Those tiny wires are implanted in the brain and they read and write electrical signals.

55:40.554 --> 55:43.675
A lot of people think the brain is this incredibly mysterious thing.

55:43.815 --> 55:47.656
It is mysterious in a lot of ways, but it is actually, it does operate with electrical signals.

55:47.836 --> 55:51.557
So if you can read and write those electrical signals, you can interface with the brain.

55:51.857 --> 55:54.838
And the device is sized so that it is the same size.

55:55.179 --> 55:57.399
If you can read and write those signals.

55:57.479 --> 56:02.061
Now the problem with reading and writing those signals is, is the following.

56:03.399 --> 56:05.240
as best as we can understand it, okay?

56:05.260 --> 56:14.186
So, I don't know how many people will shell me for this, but I'm just going to teach and, you know, people can shell me for it later.

56:14.226 --> 56:27.975
But what we're talking about here, let's just talk about a simple neuronal network that, for example, represents the feeling and image I get right now when my best friend is in the Netherlands and I think about her.

56:28.715 --> 56:31.957
So we're going to make a super simple analogy here.

56:32.397 --> 56:39.222
But there might be neurons in my visual cortex that can remember what V looks like.

56:39.262 --> 56:45.046
And there might be neurons in my auditory cortex that kind of can remember her laugh.

56:45.786 --> 56:52.891
There might be some neurons that are in my olfactory cortex that can remember her perfume or her soap.

56:54.011 --> 56:57.133
And there might be some neurons in my

57:00.003 --> 57:03.848
I don't know, amygdala, because I have such an emotional connection with her.

57:04.529 --> 57:16.686
And so these neurons have long range connections with each other and the axon will have, I mean, when they map these, the axons of single neurons in the brain, it is absolutely absurd.

57:17.937 --> 57:24.681
It's exactly the opposite of what you might think of from the perspective of roots for a tree, for example.

57:24.721 --> 57:37.187
Because this neuron might have dendrites that are all very local and maybe stay within, let's say, a cubic millimeter.

57:38.607 --> 57:40.048
Again, these might be wrong.

57:40.468 --> 57:42.389
It might be off by a little bit.

57:42.970 --> 57:45.151
But the axon can travel all around the brain.

57:46.021 --> 57:51.643
The axon from that single neuron that has dendrites that are only in like one cubic millimeter.

57:52.338 --> 58:18.948
could vary, I mean, maybe they've got some dendrites up here that go two cubic millimeters or something like that, but we're not, we're not, I'm not under, under, I'm not going too far off here when I say that the axon of this neuron could span for millimeters, centimeters, it could go from one side of the brain all the way to the other through the corpus callosum and then synapse on a thousand other neurons in five different regions of the brain over here.

58:19.588 --> 58:22.351
and that would not be an unusual projection pattern at all.

58:23.392 --> 58:27.256
So what Elon Musk just said is that if we can read and write

58:28.598 --> 58:33.020
to that set of signals, then we can interface with the brain.

58:33.060 --> 58:50.548
Now, if you stick an electrode in here, and you can see the signals from all the neurons in this square, but you can also see the signals from the axons of these neurons that are going past here, but not necessarily synapsing there, because those signals are also real.

58:51.448 --> 58:58.191
you can lower an electrode down into a bundle of axons like the corpus callosum and you can record lots of signals.

58:58.351 --> 59:13.718
In fact, early people recording from the brain had to learn to differentiate between when they were in a laminar structure that had lots of axons in it versus when they were in the cortex or a place where the neuronal cell bodies were.

59:14.258 --> 59:17.940
And although that's doable, that was part of the exploration.

59:17.960 --> 59:18.881
They had to learn that.

59:18.941 --> 59:25.765
So what Elon Musk is doing is putting a bunch of electrodes in a place that can be no bigger than, what, a centimeter around?

59:27.086 --> 59:40.995
And then he's pretending that we can read useful signals from a network that is decentralized across trillions of neurons in countless brain regions yet to be identified as functionally significant.

59:42.782 --> 59:54.637
And yet somehow or another, he purports that with that little thing there and some electrodes in one place, that this is the start of a technology that's going to understand how a

59:59.864 --> 01:00:12.928
disparately distributed random network of neurons that has built up their connections over decades is going to be usefully augmented by drilling a hole in the skull and putting some electrodes into one tiny little part of that.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.685
Your brain is not even as well uniformly organized as a computer or a television.

01:00:20.725 --> 01:00:23.867
It would be absurd to propose to do that in that context.

01:00:24.428 --> 01:00:39.419
Now we're talking about an irreducible complexity of hundreds of billions of neurons and hundreds of billions of signals that actually summate to become you, the conscious, intelligent, free will being that you are.

01:00:43.044 --> 01:00:54.577
Even if you believe most of reductionist biology, you must believe that, that at some point the emergence of who we are is greater than the sum of any of these parts.

01:00:54.637 --> 01:01:00.584
And yet he is talking as though it is just as simple as putting a couple electrodes into a television set.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:03.768
And if you do it enough times, you'll eventually figure out how the image appears.

01:01:06.716 --> 01:01:08.539
You couldn't do that with a television.

01:01:08.599 --> 01:01:13.548
So there's no freaking way you can do it with the biological entity that is the human brain.

01:01:14.522 --> 01:01:22.148
And yet here he is in his little crew of illusion of consensus crowd telling you that he can and will.

01:01:22.168 --> 01:01:24.129
That's the piece of skull that is removed.

01:01:24.209 --> 01:01:27.451
So it's like a few centimeters diameter of skull that's removed.

01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:32.295
We replaced that with the device after implanting the tiny wires with the surgical robot.

01:01:32.675 --> 01:01:35.797
And that enables read-write capability to the neurons.

01:01:36.078 --> 01:01:36.278
Yes.

01:01:36.438 --> 01:01:39.360
It enables read-write capability to the neurons.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:39.420
No.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:39.940
No.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.040
Stop.

01:01:42.602 --> 01:01:43.222
No!

01:01:44.243 --> 01:01:44.823
No!

01:01:45.183 --> 01:01:46.523
That is so wrong!

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:48.924
No!

01:01:49.064 --> 01:01:53.786
If you put electrodes into the soil, does that give you read-write capability to the microbes?

01:01:56.127 --> 01:02:02.669
If you put electrodes into a fish and record signals, now can you just feed back to them?

01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:03.269
No!

01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.329
No!

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.389
No!

01:02:07.813 --> 01:02:19.206
The very simple answer would be because you don't even know if you put your electrodes into a bundle of axons or if you're putting your electrodes into a useful place to stimulate the activity of a single neuron.

01:02:19.326 --> 01:02:22.690
It's just so stupid.

01:02:26.274 --> 01:02:27.756
And yet he's allowed to get away with it.

01:02:29.878 --> 01:02:38.964
And people like Brett Weinstein and, and Alexandros Marinos and a hundred thousand other people don't ever bother to usefully question this.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.186
But this is really, really bad.

01:02:42.346 --> 01:02:46.108
Like it's not even, it's not even like, it's bad.

01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:58.796
You know, Theranos was claiming to do something that I think in the grand scheme of things might be easier to have done with existing technologies like Lieber's technology than what he's claiming to do.

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:02.661
Exactly.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.023
It's completely wirelessly.

01:03:04.063 --> 01:03:05.464
I could have a neural link right now, you wouldn't know.

01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:07.086
And it charges inductively.

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:11.951
So you could just basically have an electromagnetic pad that you charge the device with.

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:13.953
So yeah, it's like an Apple Watch.

01:03:13.993 --> 01:03:14.333
Exactly.

01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:22.382
Except that it's actually a much harder technical challenge to solve, given that there's a limit as to how much you eat the brain tissue, whereas for

01:03:22.682 --> 01:03:24.763
You can have a hot watch or whatever.

01:03:24.783 --> 01:03:25.143
Sure.

01:03:25.163 --> 01:03:28.384
Yeah, so it's got to go through scan and stuff as well in our case.

01:03:28.444 --> 01:03:35.626
So it is a tougher challenge to charge and to have high bandwidth communications given that it's got... We're not talking about a toy.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.906
We're not talking about a pen.

01:03:38.066 --> 01:03:39.947
We're not talking about a custom knife.

01:03:40.047 --> 01:03:43.128
We're not even talking about a very fancy Swiss watch.

01:03:45.608 --> 01:03:51.710
They are... and in any of those cases you would never talk about just willy-nilly we're just gonna put stuff in it.

01:03:52.827 --> 01:03:59.712
He wouldn't just get out a, I don't know, a really expensive watch and say that we're just gonna open it up and start playing around and see if we can make it work better.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:11.120
But somehow or another, these five guys are helping and standing by Elon Musk as he claims that that's exactly what they endeavor to do.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:11.961
They're already doing it.

01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:13.202
It works in monkeys already.

01:04:13.402 --> 01:04:14.182
Blindsight.

01:04:15.383 --> 01:04:16.044
Stop lying!

01:04:17.079 --> 01:04:18.700
to go through skin and hair and stuff.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.801
We have solved it.

01:04:19.821 --> 01:04:20.421
We have solved it, yeah.

01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:27.666
Yeah, so our first step with telepathy is basically to... They're more interested in the problem of how do we charge the device than anything else.

01:04:27.706 --> 01:04:30.067
How does the device go through a scanner than anything else?

01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:33.950
They don't give a hoot about the biology they are encroaching upon.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:37.832
Oh, can you play Civilization with one of these things in your head?

01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:40.534
Well, that's just moving a mouse, isn't it?

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.495
That's just telekinesis of the mouse.

01:04:42.535 --> 01:04:43.396
That's just dumb.

01:04:43.996 --> 01:04:47.598
They can do that with monkeys without implanting anything.

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:56.743
Unlock digital independence for people with paralysis and to allow them to control the computer just with their mind without moving the body.

01:04:57.043 --> 01:05:04.407
And our goal is to provide them the same level of control, functionality, and reliability that I have when I'm using a computer.

01:05:04.747 --> 01:05:06.468
Even better than the level of control I have.

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:07.629
It's not a high bar for you.

01:05:07.669 --> 01:05:09.890
To be clear, this guy, he's controlling this with his brain.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:13.593
So he's not, you can't see his hands in this video, but he's not using a mouse and keyboard.

01:05:13.853 --> 01:05:16.955
Just thinking about how to move the cursor and playing Civilization VI.

01:05:16.995 --> 01:05:17.715
No eye tracker.

01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:17.895
Right.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:18.996
There's no eye tracker.

01:05:19.196 --> 01:05:20.517
He's live streaming it.

01:05:20.537 --> 01:05:25.440
Now the illusion that they've created here is that there was no machine learning involved.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.702
They want you to believe that the device can be go...

01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:34.029
right onto the head and instantaneously, oh wow, look, I can control my mouse.

01:05:34.149 --> 01:05:35.210
No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:35.991 --> 01:05:42.258
There would be hundreds of hours most likely of training the implant after implantation.

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:51.555
And so maybe it's only 10 hours, but it's still hours where he needs to move the mouse in some other way.

01:05:51.775 --> 01:06:09.950
And then the machine learning algorithm that supports what's happening here eventually figures out by averaging the signals that it sees there and comparing each time you try to move the mouse to the upright, lower right, up, just like when you calibrate a joystick on the switch,

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:22.003
Just like when you calibrate a joystick for your remote control for an airplane or for a helicopter, they just do that for his brain.

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:22.863
Okay, think about it.

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:26.294
And then the signals are recorded.

01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:30.918
And you wouldn't need the electrodes to be in the brain for those signals to be recorded.

01:06:30.938 --> 01:06:33.921
You could put a whole headpiece on.

01:06:34.101 --> 01:06:36.603
You could have a focused reader.

01:06:37.023 --> 01:06:39.946
You could have electrodes that are just here on your hand.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:44.209
And the signals could be reading a nerve from your arm.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:48.253
There's lots of different ways it's already been done in monkeys.

01:06:50.461 --> 01:06:53.543
And they already know you don't need to implant anything.

01:06:53.603 --> 01:06:55.304
This is dumb.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:07:00.989
And yet they are showing it to you as if this is a breakthrough.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.951
We're saving this guy.

01:07:03.991 --> 01:07:08.154
We're making his life better because now he can control that with his mind.

01:07:11.936 --> 01:07:13.738
At least as long as he doesn't lose his charger.

01:07:14.637 --> 01:07:16.618
He's not thinking cursor move here.

01:07:16.838 --> 01:07:18.639
That's the other thing that's so stupid.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.880
What he's thinking about is moving his hand.

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:34.376
Even if he can't move his hands, he can still think about moving his hands.

01:07:34.436 --> 01:07:41.500
And in doing that, he creates a pattern that becomes stereotypic for moving your hand to the upper right, to the lower right, to there, to that, to that.

01:07:41.901 --> 01:07:48.265
And they can say that they don't have his eye data, but I can guarantee you when they were training,

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:52.997
When they were training the algorithm, they used his eye data.

01:07:53.038 --> 01:07:53.978
They tracked his eyes.

01:07:54.098 --> 01:08:01.543
They probably have to put a set of goggles on him, and then he moves the mouse with his mind, and using his eyes, looking where he wants to look.

01:08:01.863 --> 01:08:09.529
And then at some point, they don't need him to look where he's looking for it to go exactly where it goes, because that's how generic these signals are.

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:19.075
And the interesting part about this, ladies and gentlemen, is that's because it does seem that certain signals in the brain are represented disparately, you know, across the brain, distributed signals.

01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:29.324
And so certain signals like motion and body position can be represented in several places in the brain simultaneously.

01:08:29.364 --> 01:08:30.445
And that kind of makes sense.

01:08:31.145 --> 01:08:35.729
But we haven't had the ability to sort of see this until very recently.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:41.334
And so it isn't very unusual that you don't have to put this in a particularly special place.

01:08:41.374 --> 01:08:44.076
But if you put it in the right place, you'll see a lot of these signals.

01:08:44.096 --> 01:08:45.858
So they put it in the motor cortex, of course.

01:08:47.093 --> 01:08:55.492
where a lot of these signals are very highly represented and very highly represented with a pretty high signal-to-noise ratio, even the imagining of movement.

01:08:56.963 --> 01:09:08.796
It's a trick, ladies and gentlemen, it's a parlor trick and you're going to see in a few minutes that actually you don't need to put any device, you don't need to put any electrodes into somebody's brain to do exactly what they're claiming this guy's doing now.

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:10.738
He also described that he's using the... Yeah.

01:09:10.818 --> 01:09:13.420
There's many more videos on his, on the platform.

01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:16.844
Yeah, so he can, he's streaming that live and also can talk and move his head...

01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:19.967
Yeah, you can also, if you join this live stream, you can ask him questions.

01:09:19.987 --> 01:09:22.029
He'll tell you all about what it's like to move.

01:09:22.169 --> 01:09:26.332
Also, I think I haven't played Civilization myself, but I think this is actually not easy mode.

01:09:26.372 --> 01:09:27.293
This is expert mode.

01:09:27.433 --> 01:09:28.194
This is emperor mode.

01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:28.855
Emperor mode.

01:09:29.015 --> 01:09:31.277
If you have played Civ, emperor mode is like the highest difficulty level.

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:36.942
Just the point is, this is a cognitively demanding task while live streaming, playing the hardest mode game, and he's able to do that while moving.

01:09:36.962 --> 01:09:39.644
Yeah, talking, engaging with the audience while playing.

01:09:39.963 --> 01:09:42.424
One of the other games he likes to play a lot is chess.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:47.786
Wow, so he's on Twitch demonstrating that he can use this device to do this and it's gross.

01:09:47.806 --> 01:09:51.508
I think it gets lost sometimes that he's actually playing speed chess.

01:09:51.648 --> 01:10:04.594
The funny thing is, is that they might have a slightly higher resolution of control or a slightly higher palette or a larger palette of control because of the amount of signals that they may be able to get from electrodes as opposed to trans

01:10:05.214 --> 01:10:11.399
cranial something or other, you know, like magnetics or whatever you would use in that sense, or even measuring from a peripheral nerve.

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:13.761
And so in that sense, I'll give him that.

01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:16.262
That, wow, no kidding, right?

01:10:16.302 --> 01:10:19.785
You can put electrodes in and you get better signals, a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

01:10:19.825 --> 01:10:20.886
Wow, surprise, surprise.

01:10:20.906 --> 01:10:26.310
But that doesn't mean that what he's doing is some magic trick or that they've solved any problems at all.

01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:36.554
All they have to do is make sure that that guy's head doesn't get infected, because if it gets infected and he dies from the infection, then this whole thing is a joke, right?

01:10:37.575 --> 01:10:40.177
Hope he doesn't get infected in the next 40 years of his life.

01:10:40.978 --> 01:10:44.982
Which requires an incredibly high fidelity degree of control.

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:50.448
Can you go play basketball without a cycle helmet on or something?

01:10:50.968 --> 01:10:51.629
How does that work?

01:10:54.386 --> 01:10:56.255
I hit my head a lot in the garage and stuff.

01:10:56.275 --> 01:10:58.002
Would that be a problem if I hit my head?

01:10:59.473 --> 01:11:01.795
and speed of control in order to be able to win.

01:11:02.415 --> 01:11:10.181
Also, another cool stuff about our device is that you can use it anywhere, anytime, also on a plane, during a flight, while creating really cool memes of games.

01:11:10.301 --> 01:11:15.445
Also, our device unlocks things that previously were impossible for our participants.

01:11:15.565 --> 01:11:27.033
For example, we were able to connect him to his gaming consoles, which play Mario Kart with friends and family, and it was lovely to see them playing together after years that he couldn't do it since his injury.

01:11:27.193 --> 01:11:29.254
Imagine if you're sitting on a row over from this guy.

01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:31.776
You look over, he's making a cat meme.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.537
No hands, no movement.

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:34.718
Yeah.

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:36.719
But even that's a lie, right?

01:11:36.739 --> 01:11:37.380
You can see it.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.321
I mean, he's, what did he do?

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:42.944
He took a picture and he added a, he drew some mustache on it.

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:45.705
Ooh, he's really good, isn't he?

01:11:45.765 --> 01:11:46.726
It's really precise.

01:11:46.766 --> 01:11:49.608
He's a great drawer and they restored drawing.

01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:51.069
What a joke.

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:54.500
and he couldn't do it since he's injured.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.702
Imagine if you're sitting on a row over from this guy.

01:11:56.722 --> 01:11:59.264
You look over, he's making a cat meme.

01:11:59.464 --> 01:12:00.404
No hands, no movement.

01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:01.525
Living in a real world.

01:12:01.745 --> 01:12:03.486
Yeah, it's a strange time.

01:12:03.526 --> 01:12:10.291
Yeah, and he loves using the device and using it independently daily to watch videos, read, play games using the browser.

01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:17.596
And the key metrics that we care is to make sure our device is actually useful is to basically the amount of hours we use the device daily and weekly.

01:12:17.616 --> 01:12:19.537
And we track it since the surgery.

01:12:20.558 --> 01:12:27.341
And on weeks that he's not too busy and not traveling, he can even reach 70 hours of using the device a week.

01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:28.281
This is amazing.

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:32.823
And he would, of course, love to use it more, but need to run and he needs to sleep sometimes.

01:12:33.003 --> 01:12:34.963
And also, of course, to charge the device once in a while.

01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:36.704
Hopefully, we'll improve that over time.

01:12:37.204 --> 01:12:39.085
Maybe not obvious to people who are watching this.

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:40.586
It's a normal MacBook he's controlling.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:43.107
This isn't like some limited edition thing where there's only a few options.

01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:45.087
You can just do anything that you can do on a MacBook Pro.

01:12:45.287 --> 01:12:46.448
Same one I have on my desk, actually.

01:12:46.468 --> 01:12:47.048
It's the exact same one.

01:12:48.889 --> 01:12:50.589
You notice that they didn't show him typing.

01:12:57.192 --> 01:13:01.593
I'm sure he can type, but he can't type any faster than I can with Hunt and Peck.

01:13:01.733 --> 01:13:03.514
It's not like he can think the words and they show up.

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:17.168
So they're not reading anybody's brain.

01:13:17.208 --> 01:13:23.730
And even when they do that, and they will eventually probably be able to do that with rudimentary words, maybe it's possible, I don't know.

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:36.735
They still will not be doing what they claim to be doing because they will use machine learning in a training session that could be weeks or months before any rudimentary language could ever be read out, even if it was only 50 words.

01:13:40.456 --> 01:13:41.980
and what you visualized.

01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:44.466
Even that is going to take them a long time.

01:13:44.506 --> 01:13:48.615
And remember, they started out by saying that blindsight works in monkeys.

01:13:49.616 --> 01:13:51.797
that they'd already gotten it to work in Monkeys.

01:13:52.017 --> 01:13:54.058
And now they're telling you, I mean.

01:13:54.078 --> 01:13:59.141
I was able to outperform about 10% of our engineer at Neuralink.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.202
And you can be sure that we are very good in this game and very quick.

01:14:02.342 --> 01:14:06.244
And if you want to check out how well you can do it, you can do it on our website.

01:14:06.384 --> 01:14:07.725
And it's a very addictive game.

01:14:07.885 --> 01:14:09.025
Yeah, it's a very simple game.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.086
You just have to click on the square.

01:14:10.186 --> 01:14:16.029
But actually, even though it sounds silly, it's quite a, yeah, it can be quite, it sounds like it can be quite addictive.

01:14:17.249 --> 01:14:19.690
Especially if you get a low score and you think, there's no way I got it.

01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:26.372
Anyone who wants to try this, I recommend going to the Neuralink.com website and seeing if you can beat Nolan's record.

01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:28.673
And you will find that it's actually quite difficult to do.

01:14:28.733 --> 01:14:34.635
This is really with version one of the device and with only a small percentage of the electrodes that are working.

01:14:34.995 --> 01:14:39.979
So this is really just the beginning, but even the beginning is twice as good as the world record.

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:41.621
This is important to emphasize.

01:14:41.841 --> 01:14:47.445
The media has a habit of saying that the glass is 10% empty, but actually it's 90% full.

01:14:47.686 --> 01:14:56.193
I think it's really quite an accomplishment of the Neuralink team to have achieved with the first patient, the first device, twice the world record for the brain-to-computer bandwidth.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.315
That's really an astonishing, amazingly great outcome.

01:14:59.616 --> 01:15:01.157
And it's only going to get better from here.

01:15:01.557 --> 01:15:05.580
So the potential is to ultimately get, I think, to megabit level.

01:15:06.681 --> 01:15:09.523
I mean, the guy is not even articulate.

01:15:09.563 --> 01:15:11.464
It's really frustrating.

01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:20.090
He's made out to be this polymath, super interesting guy, and I've never heard him say anything profound in all the years that I've been listening to him.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:28.538
He's never explained anything really profound or very deep, and he's never demonstrated any insight at all.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:35.303
Some of the things that he's said about the brain so far are just absolutely adolescent, if not infantile.

01:15:35.985 --> 01:15:39.310
long-term goal of improving the bandwidth of the brain-computer interface.

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:45.739
If you think about how low the bandwidth normally is between a human and... You can see that they've cut this, right?

01:15:45.779 --> 01:15:52.308
I mean, they've even cut it to try and improve his fluidity, and it's still gosh-awful.

01:15:52.688 --> 01:15:54.889
device, the average bandwidth is extremely low.

01:15:55.029 --> 01:15:58.671
It's, I'd say, less than one bit per second over the course of a day.

01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:07.114
If there are 86,400 seconds in a day, you're outputting less than that number of bits to any given device, except in perhaps very rare circumstances.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:16.538
This is actually quite important for AI, basically for human-AI symbiosis, is just being able to communicate at a speed the AI can follow.

01:16:16.798 --> 01:16:32.213
Yeah, just to emphasize again, he's performing at this extremely high level with about... That's the second time that he's made the argument that this is a precursor technology which will allow us to interact with computers at a speed that will be helpful in containing AI's danger.

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:34.936
It's the second time he's said that stupid shit.

01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:37.178
And it's just ridiculous.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:46.346
Now, I will agree with Endless Current in the chat that experimenting in ways to help handicapped people is fine.

01:16:46.826 --> 01:16:47.567
I'm fine with that.

01:16:47.727 --> 01:16:53.571
Just like I'm fine with if you want to use mRNA to cure somebody with an advanced cancer and it works, great.

01:16:54.051 --> 01:16:55.012
I'm totally down with that.

01:16:55.052 --> 01:16:55.753
That's possible.

01:16:56.813 --> 01:17:07.021
But the idea that these technologies are useful in augmenting a healthy human and useful, like a cell phone is useful to your little kid, this is just absurd.

01:17:10.013 --> 01:17:22.062
And the idea that if we just, you know, we don't start now, then we're not going to have a human interface with computers that is going to be sufficient to restrain the AI in some useful way.

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:31.268
This idea that he keeps repeating is repeated on purpose because it is part of a mythology they would like to teach our children.

01:17:33.163 --> 01:17:43.754
It is a real mythology that we need a brain-mind interface that's of high enough resolution before AI becomes conscious or holy crap, we're certain doom.

01:17:44.414 --> 01:17:45.636
That's what he's saying here.

01:17:47.769 --> 01:17:48.850
15% of his channels.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.774
And so we want to mitigate any of the problems that led to that situation.

01:17:53.014 --> 01:17:54.676
The brain is a fascinating organ.

01:17:54.696 --> 01:17:57.118
I'll share with you some of the secrets about the brain.

01:17:57.318 --> 01:18:01.962
During any typical brain surgery, a small amount of air is introduced into the skull.

01:18:02.363 --> 01:18:06.226
That's because neurosurgeons like to have as much room as possible around the brain.

01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:10.470
And so there's this little known control mechanism of allowing the

01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:19.199
that concentration in the blood to rise a bit, which allows the brain to either expand or contract depending on where you target that CO2.

01:18:19.379 --> 01:18:23.343
But typically, neurosurgeons will have the brain shrink by lowering CO2.

01:18:23.603 --> 01:18:34.374
What we're going to do in our future surgeries is keep the CO2 concentration actually quite normal, maybe even slightly elevated, and that'll allow the brain to stay its normal size and shape during surgery.

01:18:34.554 --> 01:18:37.695
That should eliminate this air pocket that we saw in the first participant.

01:18:37.995 --> 01:18:47.838
That air pocket, we think, may have contributed to eating up some of the thread slack as the air bubble migrated to be under the implant, pushed the brain away from the implant.

01:18:48.018 --> 01:18:49.379
And so that's easy enough to fix.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.259
And so think about that.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.700
Think about that.

01:18:58.021 --> 01:19:03.003
He's describing some kind of, you know, methodological thing that they figured out on a human.

01:19:05.578 --> 01:19:09.820
Maybe we shouldn't use the same CO2 concentration that makes the brain shrink a little bit.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.222
Maybe we should instead keep it swollen.

01:19:12.262 --> 01:19:16.744
Maybe we have to do brain surgery a little different in order to implant these stupid devices.

01:19:18.705 --> 01:19:20.786
Does this guy really believe that that was ethical?

01:19:21.586 --> 01:19:25.989
That that was ethical for that, just because he signed the paper, you know, might as well do it.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:28.870
This is just gross.

01:19:30.151 --> 01:19:33.213
It's so irreverent to the person.

01:19:34.226 --> 01:19:38.896
who they did this to, and it's so irreverent to the problem they purport to be trying to solve.

01:19:39.016 --> 01:19:40.780
It's just disgusting.

01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:44.809
And it's intellectually insulting.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:53.492
They have contributed to eating up some of the thread slack as the air bubble migrated to be under the implant, pushed the brain away from the implant.

01:19:53.672 --> 01:19:55.032
And so that's easy enough to fix.

01:19:55.173 --> 01:20:04.836
Another consideration that we want to focus on for our upcoming participants is that the brain, think of it like a really complex folded onion.

01:20:04.996 --> 01:20:11.799
It's layer upon layer of sheets of neurons all over the surface of the brain folded into this odd looking shape.

01:20:12.219 --> 01:20:19.124
the folds of the brain travel down deep into the brain, and along with it go those onion layers of neurons.

01:20:19.604 --> 01:20:33.273
And if we insert very close to one of the folds, where there may be very useful information encoded in neurons, we may end up traveling with our threads parallel to some of the layers of neurons that we're most interested in, avoiding them entirely.

01:20:33.533 --> 01:20:39.177
To avoid that possibility, we're going to insert in our future participants more close to the middle of

01:20:39.737 --> 01:20:45.220
the apex of the folds, ensuring that we're crossing the layers of interest, layer five of the cortex.

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.740
So this is just so silly.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.281
It is just so silly.

01:20:50.662 --> 01:20:57.805
The way that he talks about it, and again, he's talking about it like a surgeon, not even talking about it like somebody who appreciates the beauty of it.

01:20:59.566 --> 01:21:03.188
I think I might have the screen up here also available.

01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:03.608
Yeah.

01:21:04.636 --> 01:21:09.179
Here's the one I have on my Mac has all the different brains of all the mammals.

01:21:10.139 --> 01:21:11.700
I think this one right here is a dolphin.

01:21:13.241 --> 01:21:15.562
I'm pretty sure that one over there in the corner is a human.

01:21:17.864 --> 01:21:19.004
I think this is a dolphin.

01:21:19.885 --> 01:21:22.446
One of those up there, the big fat one is a manatee, I think.

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.710
Some mid-range ones are monkeys and dogs.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.652
And then the rodents are up there in the corner, although I don't know

01:21:33.127 --> 01:21:33.787
Can't do that one.

01:21:34.068 --> 01:21:35.268
I don't know what this one is.

01:21:35.928 --> 01:21:37.289
I'm pretty sure this is a human.

01:21:37.349 --> 01:21:47.614
I'm pretty sure this is a dolphin I'm pretty sure this one is a manatee and then these are like lions and and and and Dogs and wolves or something like that.

01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:53.316
I'd have to look it up again And so what he's talking about is is that this structure right here?

01:21:55.557 --> 01:21:56.998
Actually is a

01:21:58.649 --> 01:22:09.352
The neocortex is made up of these curves, and if you could cut them sideways, what you would see is that there are neurons that are arranged around the bends like this into layers.

01:22:11.913 --> 01:22:15.934
And those layers are like that, and then they go around, right?

01:22:16.074 --> 01:22:17.274
So the layers are like this.

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:38.824
And so what he's arguing is if you think of this as a three-dimensional thing like my finger, then these layers, even if you turn this thing this way, then these layers are also present like if you turned it that way, then I guess the layers would kind of look like this in the cross-section, right, with neurons like this.

01:22:40.515 --> 01:22:47.557
But then if you dropped your electrodes down in this way, then you'd be moving parallel to like this.

01:22:47.598 --> 01:22:55.660
You'd turn this this way, then your electrodes would be moving like this across these things instead of necessarily like down, for example.

01:22:56.401 --> 01:22:59.262
This is a funny little pen that somebody in Pennsylvania makes.

01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:04.323
It's got a really cool design because it should be kind of non-leak proof.

01:23:04.844 --> 01:23:08.425
But it's getting all over me only because this thing had a little fuzz in it.

01:23:09.145 --> 01:23:32.248
and then it's uh it's machined right so he machines all of these things and then it goes like this and it's all airtight so it doesn't leak or anything like that super tiny pen it's really cool um i should probably put a link somewhere but anyway i bought it so it's not like i'm i'm advertising for him but i just wanted you to see why i was using such a tiny pen anyway the point is is that that's what he's talking about

01:23:33.183 --> 01:23:34.744
The cortex is a bunch of wrinkles.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.185
Again, I showed you all the wrinkles over here.

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:38.766
The cortex is like this.

01:23:38.826 --> 01:23:44.769
And if you were to cut this, you know, like this, that way you just slice it flat and then you would see something like that.

01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:48.892
And if you take it and turn the wrinkle like that, you might see something like this.

01:23:48.952 --> 01:23:56.456
And so depending on how you put the electrode in at the top of the brain, then you're going to either be going down into the top.

01:23:57.347 --> 01:24:04.670
of a wrinkle like this, or you might be going down into a wrinkle like this or the other way, you know, that's what he's talking about.

01:24:05.211 --> 01:24:12.174
And so to say that that is the same across every person, it's close to the same.

01:24:12.194 --> 01:24:17.736
A lot of the, I mean, the vast majority of the landmark folds are present in every person.

01:24:17.796 --> 01:24:21.358
So you don't have to think of this as like a variable

01:24:22.512 --> 01:24:24.515
the structure of this to be variable.

01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:31.704
I mean, a lot of these gyri are known and, you know, they can get very close to predicting which ones will be which ones.

01:24:33.567 --> 01:24:34.909
Gee, I hope I got that right.

01:24:35.429 --> 01:24:38.313
Now I'm starting to doubt it because I don't see any cerebellum in that one.

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:39.555
But anyway,

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:41.490
You know, all the brains are there.

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:42.951
Anyway, let's go over here.

01:24:43.051 --> 01:24:46.872
Let's go over here and then hit play again.

01:24:46.912 --> 01:24:51.734
So what he's showing you here is actually not a very big piece at all, right?

01:24:51.774 --> 01:24:54.195
That's what's underneath that little coin device.

01:24:54.875 --> 01:25:03.878
And so that would mean that essentially we're talking about a single wrinkle and then he's kind of showing it from some, I don't know, three-dimensional angle like that.

01:25:04.358 --> 01:25:06.439
And so then you're putting electrodes down in

01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:11.743
And remember, as you drop electrodes down, you're not going through anything or nothing.

01:25:11.783 --> 01:25:18.970
You're going through axons, you're going through neurons, and you're puncturing neurons, and you're breaking dendrites.

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:24.976
And it's not possible for you to put this through this material without severing connections that exist.

01:25:26.557 --> 01:25:27.098
It's just not.

01:25:28.703 --> 01:25:43.484
If the immune system comes in months or years or days later and tries to interact with those dead neurons or those dead structures or the foreign material that you've put in here, then you could have inflammation at this site at any given time.

01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:51.832
And so all of this is just ignored and assumed that it's going to go fine because it's sterile or whatever.

01:25:52.452 --> 01:26:00.835
They're not talking about this as a useful augmentation of a healthy human, even though they are pretending that that's what their goal is.

01:26:02.773 --> 01:26:11.679
This is like giving an mRNA talk about working on terminal cancer patients and talking about mRNA as it's the vaccine of the future.

01:26:11.719 --> 01:26:18.243
You see, it's the same kind of exaggeration, but maybe with several more layers of bullshit.

01:26:18.723 --> 01:26:23.106
I also think that it's important to highlight here those tiny wires that Elon mentioned.

01:26:23.366 --> 01:26:24.527
They're a fraction of a human hair.

01:26:24.607 --> 01:26:25.567
They're very flexible.

01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:31.211
Intentionally so, because the brain's constantly moving and you want the electrodes to be moving with the brain, causing less of the scarring.

01:26:31.571 --> 01:26:37.395
And it's actually impossible for a human, however talented Matthew is, to actually maneuver them.

01:26:37.415 --> 01:26:49.123
We have a surgical robot that we built that can actually precisely target them in any three-dimensional space, X, Y, as well as Z, with micron-level precision, while avoiding vasculature, so that you don't disrupt and cause immune response from happening.

01:26:49.243 --> 01:26:54.067
We actually have- Oh, so if you don't hit any capillaries, there will be no immune response.

01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:56.608
Sorry, that's wrong.

01:26:57.668 --> 01:27:02.011
There's no freaking way they have any biology to support that statement.

01:27:02.031 --> 01:27:06.474
And then what's even stupider is that this guy is the chip designer dude.

01:27:07.495 --> 01:27:09.357
What is he, why is he saying this?

01:27:10.357 --> 01:27:11.978
Think about how silly this is.

01:27:12.039 --> 01:27:17.142
This is like a, it's a sales group and they agree on the sales pitch.

01:27:17.202 --> 01:27:19.824
So that's why they can all jump in at different times.

01:27:19.864 --> 01:27:20.985
He's not a biologist.

01:27:21.065 --> 01:27:21.605
What is this?

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:32.199
to precisely target them in any three-dimensional space, X, Y, as well as Z, with micron-level precision, while avoiding vasculature so that you don't disrupt and cause immune response from happening.

01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:35.902
We actually have the technology to be able to place them exactly where we want them.

01:27:35.922 --> 01:27:42.548
Yeah, it was truly amazing to see the surface of the brain after the robot had inserted all the electrodes on the first participant without

01:27:42.988 --> 01:27:45.529
a drop of blood in sight is really quite an achievement.

01:27:47.129 --> 01:27:54.031
I've seen an entire brain surgery where they removed a baseball-sized glioma and there was no real blood to see.

01:27:54.971 --> 01:27:56.231
What is going on?

01:27:56.251 --> 01:28:01.833
It is really funny what they're doing here.

01:28:02.873 --> 01:28:12.015
Most people don't realize is that the brain appears to be somewhat undifferentiated so if you look at the cortex it looks... Here he goes he's about to tell you all he knows about the brain

01:28:14.003 --> 01:28:14.583
Oh, gosh.

01:28:15.283 --> 01:28:16.504
This is going to be brutal.

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:22.385
This is going to be like a high school junior's presentation in biology 2.

01:28:22.625 --> 01:28:25.166
A drop of blood in sight is really quite an achievement.

01:28:25.406 --> 01:28:25.886
Yes.

01:28:25.906 --> 01:28:30.867
Something that probably most people don't realize is that the brain appears to be somewhat undifferentiated.

01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:35.749
So if you look at the cortex, it looks like a whole bunch of folds that were maybe like that.

01:28:36.049 --> 01:28:40.450
It's not obvious just looking at, say, a picture of the brain that the brain is highly differentiated.

01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:49.092
You pretty much know exactly where the part of the brain is that controls your right hand and your left hand and your leg and that kind of thing.

01:28:49.132 --> 01:28:58.354
So the interesting thing about this limited understanding of the brain is that there's a very big theme that runs through neuroscience, especially with regard to the neocortex.

01:28:58.394 --> 01:29:02.615
The neocortex, again, being this wrinkled part of the brain.

01:29:04.733 --> 01:29:11.795
The neocortex in higher animals, this folded structure is a repeated circuit.

01:29:12.956 --> 01:29:31.922
And I actually got slapped down in 1993 by Bert Sackman, the winner of the 1991 Prize for Medicine and Physiology for his discovery or invention of the patch clamp technique with Erwin Nair.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:39.144
And we had dinner and we were talking about how, what we wanted to do with our lives.

01:29:39.464 --> 01:29:58.336
And I said that I wanted to find out the difference between what he's talking about here, the difference between the circuits of visual cortex and auditory cortex and try to, you know, record or map those circuits and see if I could see the difference in pattern that is present in a visual cortex versus

01:29:58.965 --> 01:30:00.046
and auditory cortex.

01:30:00.086 --> 01:30:07.250
And now, as I repeat this story, I realize how naive I sounded back then, but I was just a naive young grad student.

01:30:08.391 --> 01:30:12.073
And he said, well, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

01:30:13.134 --> 01:30:15.555
All of the neocortex circuitry is the same.

01:30:16.156 --> 01:30:21.259
And we need to understand what is similar across all of these circuits, not what's different.

01:30:22.782 --> 01:30:24.624
And now he didn't say it that nicely.

01:30:24.664 --> 01:30:25.705
He said it even worse.

01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:34.252
He just said that that's not the right question because the entire neocortex circuit is the same.

01:30:35.133 --> 01:30:37.375
And I didn't understand how profound that was.

01:30:37.435 --> 01:30:45.902
For a long time, I would tell that story as evidence that he didn't get it and that he didn't think that my way of wanting to investigate the brain was a very good idea.

01:30:45.942 --> 01:30:47.223
But the more I look at it,

01:30:47.987 --> 01:31:03.578
And the more I step back from it 20 years later after that happened, I see the point that he was trying to make, that we needed to understand how the neocortex, having a very similar circuit being used for all these disparate modalities, how can we understand that?

01:31:03.638 --> 01:31:07.921
How can we understand the biological principle that is being, that is, that is

01:31:08.621 --> 01:31:30.836
that is evident in the fact that there are the same layers with the same morphologies and the same arrangements of neurons and interneurons in the auditory cortex and the retrospinal cortex and the medial entorhinal cortex, even though we know when we record from these places in the brain, they have very different signaling regimes depending on the behavior of the animal.

01:31:33.678 --> 01:31:35.619
And so this beauty

01:31:37.349 --> 01:31:44.506
has already been very meticulously described, and our inability to penetrate it.

01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:52.939
has already been meticulously identified by people like Burt Sackman and those people that came before him when they realized that this is a repeating circuit.

01:31:53.519 --> 01:31:59.841
The structure function relationship must almost be identical across all of these disparate modalities.

01:32:00.361 --> 01:32:11.025
So if we're gonna understand what the brain is doing in the neocortex, we're gonna have to understand what it's doing in the context of using the same basic palette of microcircuits.

01:32:12.304 --> 01:32:18.806
And my idea was, well, there must be differences and they must be manifest in the structure function relationship.

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:21.246
Otherwise, how could these things do different jobs?

01:32:21.766 --> 01:32:38.070
The argument that Bert Sackman was making is probably more closely related to the idea of how can we understand how these jobs could be done by the same circuit or what contribution to these different modalities could be made by the same circuit.

01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:43.594
And then we'll finally be asking the right question and be probing these circuits in the right way.

01:32:45.895 --> 01:33:02.847
And neurobiology is still in the infant stage of being able to ask the right questions about some of these very profound biological observations, like the one that is that all of these higher mammals have this gigantic, repeated, wrinkling circuit of layered neurons.

01:33:03.547 --> 01:33:06.369
And they use the same circuit for auditory and

01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:15.116
and proprioception and, and visual processing and, and its hierarchical circuits because they project to one another.

01:33:15.136 --> 01:33:22.482
And it's a chain of things that seems to build up the information or add the information or, or integrated in stages.

01:33:22.542 --> 01:33:36.114
And so that's the reason why a lot of these computer analogies are used in the first place because of the repeating circuitry that's evident in the anatomy of the neuro, the, the neocortex across all of these animals.

01:33:39.025 --> 01:33:55.240
And so rather than bringing you to understand the beauty of it and see the irreducible complexity of it and all the different manifestations of it across higher creation, this guy is trying to tell you that, you know, we know all what we're doing.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.602
We can just put these things in there and it's all really cool.

01:33:57.642 --> 01:34:00.544
You might not know how complicated the brain is, but we sure do.

01:34:02.186 --> 01:34:02.867
Stop lying.

01:34:03.968 --> 01:34:05.829
appears to be somewhat undifferentiated.

01:34:05.909 --> 01:34:26.963
So if you look at the cortex, it looks like a whole bunch of folds that were maybe like, it's not obvious, just looking at a picture of the brain, that that it's the brain is highly differentiated, that there's, you pretty much know exactly where the part of the brain is that controls your right hand and your left hand and your leg and that kind of thing, or vision, it's actually quite precisely located.

01:34:27.043 --> 01:34:30.346
It's not some people I think look the brain like, oh, it could be it could be anywhere.

01:34:30.406 --> 01:34:33.808
But actually, we it's brain is highly differentiated, even though it doesn't look

01:34:34.429 --> 01:34:39.895
So he's talking to people who know nothing, I mean know nothing about the brain, right?

01:34:39.935 --> 01:34:43.519
This is not even remotely designed for a 12th grade

01:34:46.303 --> 01:34:47.964
Advanced biology understanding.

01:34:48.084 --> 01:34:49.245
I know for sure.

01:34:49.425 --> 01:34:55.289
I knew more about the brain in high school than what he's addressing right now, which is Absolutely malevolent.

01:34:55.369 --> 01:34:56.850
It's insulting and it's gross.

01:34:57.151 --> 01:35:01.434
Yeah Do you want to describe how we actually where like how we identify where to drill the queen?

01:35:01.454 --> 01:35:07.458
Yeah, so we can put a patient that is considering this implant into an MRI so functional

01:35:07.918 --> 01:35:14.140
magnetic resonance imaging machine and ask them to imagine hand movements that because of the spinal cord injury don't happen.

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:20.103
But just imagining those hand movements causes these areas of the brain to light up in the fMRI scanner.

01:35:20.563 --> 01:35:21.143
Do you see?

01:35:22.123 --> 01:35:29.146
Just imagining the movements and now you just keep imagining them and imagining them and they're just calibrating a joystick.

01:35:30.672 --> 01:35:33.393
It's as simple as calibrating a joystick.

01:35:33.453 --> 01:35:34.274
That's all it is.

01:35:34.334 --> 01:35:37.255
He's moving a cursor on a screen for shit's sake.

01:35:37.616 --> 01:35:38.916
He's not making an omelet.

01:35:39.737 --> 01:35:49.662
So we have a pretty good idea based in fact for each individual participant which part of their brain is going to respond to imagined movements of the hand.

01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:53.523
And so we can map those imagined movements much as we all do when moving.

01:35:53.583 --> 01:35:54.644
It's exactly what I

01:35:54.804 --> 01:36:20.696
just told you it is absolutely exactly what i just told you they put it where your hand movements are they tell you to imagine the hand movements and they use a stupid machine learning algorithm to decode that over many many many training sessions and then they show you him playing civilization and say see we have telepathy stop lying mouse to controlling a cursor on a screen even without the use of a mouse yeah but anyway i think it's an important point that it's not like

01:36:21.786 --> 01:36:24.428
the part of your brain that controls your hand might be anywhere in the cortex.

01:36:25.048 --> 01:36:25.729
This is not the case.

01:36:25.749 --> 01:36:28.971
It's going to be in a very specific region, and it's going to be- Precision is key too.

01:36:29.231 --> 01:36:29.431
Yeah.

01:36:29.771 --> 01:36:31.493
The left-handed, right-handed thing in my mind too.

01:36:31.573 --> 01:36:34.635
If you're right-handed, you want the device on the left side.

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:34.835
Yeah.

01:36:34.995 --> 01:36:38.437
The left side of your brain.

01:36:38.457 --> 01:36:45.661
Oh, but if you want it to be on the right hand, don't forget it's got to be on the left side because everything crosses.

01:36:46.762 --> 01:36:47.783
Oh my gosh.

01:36:54.147 --> 01:36:56.031
I mean, this is really awful.

01:36:56.051 --> 01:37:04.548
I would be willing to bet that both of my sons already know that the left side of their brain controls the right side of their body and it's not very...

01:37:05.626 --> 01:37:07.528
They're acting like, oh, I didn't know that.

01:37:07.568 --> 01:37:10.970
That was sure pretty fascinating, wasn't it?

01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:16.415
Another of the risk mitigations we're looking at in the future is that the implant has a certain size.

01:37:16.715 --> 01:37:21.439
The depth of the bottom of the implant is actually thinner than the average human skull.

01:37:21.639 --> 01:37:26.683
And so what we want to be able to do is control the size of the gap under the implant.

01:37:27.123 --> 01:37:48.221
give the threat all of these problems are physical problems with interfacing with the the skull and their device all of these problems have nothing to do with the irreducible complex problem that they purport to have already solved in monkeys called blindsight holy shit stop lying

01:37:48.982 --> 01:37:53.103
heads that travel from the implant into the brain as much slack as possible.

01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:59.845
We didn't do this in the first participant because we didn't want to manipulate any of their tissue that we didn't absolutely have to.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:14.808
In upcoming implants, our plan is to sculpt the surface of the skull very intentionally to minimize the gap under the implant such that the bottom of the implant travels perfectly flush with the normal contour of the inner side of the skull.

01:38:15.008 --> 01:38:16.829
That will put the implant closer to the brain

01:38:17.369 --> 01:38:19.791
will eliminate some of the tension on the threads.

01:38:19.991 --> 01:38:23.233
And we think it will reduce some of the tendency of threads to retract.

01:38:23.493 --> 01:38:25.114
And we actually built the tool to do that.

01:38:25.555 --> 01:38:28.016
Yeah, this is actually a very important detail.

01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:36.762
You really want the inner contour of the skull to be flush so that the implant, there's no, the brain doesn't want to pucker up into the gap.

01:38:37.002 --> 01:38:38.243
That's really quite a big deal.

01:38:38.463 --> 01:38:39.984
I mean, it's really quite a big deal.

01:38:40.025 --> 01:38:45.068
They're really talking about the mechanical implications of making a hole in the brain and putting a plug in it.

01:38:46.468 --> 01:38:50.889
And all these big problems they had to solve because they're engineering geniuses.

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:53.550
This is a lot harder than landing a rocket.

01:38:56.091 --> 01:38:58.172
This is major league stupid.

01:38:59.252 --> 01:39:01.193
It's major league stupid.

01:39:01.253 --> 01:39:01.853
These people...

01:39:04.588 --> 01:39:10.651
Minimizing the air pocket and the implant being flush with the inside contour of the skull are two very important.

01:39:10.771 --> 01:39:16.795
The additional benefit here is that you do see some amount of stick-up, what we call stick-up, so a minor bump in the head.

01:39:17.075 --> 01:39:18.216
What we call stick-up.

01:39:19.516 --> 01:39:23.078
One of the big problems with the designing of this implant is stick-up.

01:39:23.118 --> 01:39:25.180
You know, we're limited by the thickness of the skull.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.820
Anything above that is stick-up.

01:39:27.321 --> 01:39:31.123
And so we've got a whole team focused on reducing the stick-up.

01:39:33.899 --> 01:39:33.980
Bye.

01:39:37.657 --> 01:39:39.558
but this actually eliminates that even further.

01:39:39.638 --> 01:39:55.182
Yes, really, our goal is that if you run your hand over the top of the skull, you don't feel any bump, you don't feel any device, and that even if someone was bald, you wouldn't really... Think about how much time they're spending to let you know that while we're really trying to reduce it, you won't even feel it in the next generation.

01:39:55.322 --> 01:40:04.084
You'd notice it, and then from the inner contour of the skull, the brain, from a physical standpoint, doesn't really notice that there's a divot in the skull, because there's no divot.

01:40:04.284 --> 01:40:11.148
Okay, another aspect of the human brain that obviously differs from any of the animals that we tested in is that the human brain is a lot bigger.

01:40:11.529 --> 01:40:14.371
And so you may not realize that means the human brain.

01:40:14.551 --> 01:40:17.473
One of the most spectacular cartoons I've ever seen.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:25.558
They are trying to simulate to you the relative movement of the skull relative to the brain in a human versus in a macaque or a sheep or a swine.

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.720
Because I guess they measured it.

01:40:31.482 --> 01:40:33.343
Maybe they even, you know, did a whole

01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:41.708
Maybe they got this from implants that they did.

01:40:41.788 --> 01:40:42.068
Maybe.

01:40:42.268 --> 01:40:42.949
It's possible.

01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.449
I don't know.

01:40:43.749 --> 01:40:48.713
It moves quite a bit more than any of these other smaller brained creatures.

01:40:49.233 --> 01:40:58.259
And so when we open the skull, we see the brain travel toward and away from the robot about three millimeters in total as the heart beats and the breathing takes place.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:05.304
And so that movement, it adds a small challenge for the robot in precisely choosing a depth to insert each thread.

01:41:05.524 --> 01:41:07.005
It's not an enormous challenge.

01:41:07.025 --> 01:41:08.526
And we've already upgraded the robots.

01:41:09.026 --> 01:41:17.095
capabilities to be able to... If that's how the human brain moves, then how would wires that are really flexible, how would that work?

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:24.143
So you got to put in enough slack in there so that the wire is like going like this all the time, like a little spring in that space.

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:27.165
What are they, what are we supposed to conceptualize there?

01:41:27.245 --> 01:41:30.407
Or is the wire sliding up and down inside of the impaled brain?

01:41:30.887 --> 01:41:32.088
This is so stupid.

01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:33.428
It's just gross.

01:41:33.769 --> 01:41:39.732
Even more precisely target depth in even a very rapidly moving brain with a high amplitude of movement.

01:41:39.932 --> 01:41:44.397
You may think the most obvious mitigation for threads that pulled out of the brain is to insert them deeper.

01:41:44.838 --> 01:41:45.479
We think so too.

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:50.524
And so we're going to broaden the range of depths at which we insert threads.

01:41:50.745 --> 01:41:55.230
For the very first participant, we had an enormous amount of data from our animal work.

01:41:55.590 --> 01:42:05.053
and we had very highly optimized our insertion depth to maximize the crossing of the layers of interest in the cortex with the electrodes that we're recording from.

01:42:05.474 --> 01:42:20.439
Now that we know retraction is a possibility, we're going to insert at a variety of depths that even in several cases of differing amounts of retracting threads, we're going to have electrodes at the proper depth and with the deepest threads be able to track

01:42:20.859 --> 01:42:24.801
how much retraction has occurred across the surface of the brain from each thread.

01:42:24.861 --> 01:42:30.505
And so we're going to both have more threads in the right layer and have better data on how much retraction.

01:42:30.605 --> 01:42:31.525
Now think about that.

01:42:31.565 --> 01:42:36.488
They're talking about the relative locations of the electrodes from which they're deriving all their data.

01:42:36.989 --> 01:42:38.890
And it doesn't sound like it matters that much.

01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:46.214
If it moves around a little bit, if they put them here and there and everywhere, because again, they're not decoding anything.

01:42:47.725 --> 01:42:51.988
They're just going to record the noise and correlate it with what the person is thinking.

01:42:52.008 --> 01:42:59.693
And if they put it in the right place, there will be enough signal to noise for a machine learning algorithm to decode basic movement of a mouse.

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:00.934
Whoop-de-doo.

01:43:01.694 --> 01:43:02.695
It's so dumb.

01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:05.268
It's getting hot in here.

01:43:05.288 --> 01:43:14.151
If you're a PCI nerd, you might know that being able to control individual Z depth or thread is not something that most neural interface devices offer.

01:43:14.791 --> 01:43:18.812
And so now they're selling the idea that they can raise and lower individual electrodes.

01:43:18.872 --> 01:43:19.733
And that's really cool.

01:43:19.813 --> 01:43:27.275
I had a friend in grad school who went and spent a whole year and a half of his life designing a

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:45.796
a 16 electrode microdrive that would allow the researcher to lower 16 different electrodes into the hippocampus of a rat and put them wherever they wanted to and so they could measure anatomically across the entire length of the medial entorhinal cortex.

01:43:46.477 --> 01:43:50.880
And so, that was an implant that had electrodes going into the brain.

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.864
And so, they're talking about something that this is the first time that anything is done like that.

01:43:56.904 --> 01:44:00.246
And the Mosers had a grad student that invented one from scratch.

01:44:03.188 --> 01:44:07.291
And they have several nature papers about that, the measurements that they gathered from that.

01:44:07.331 --> 01:44:08.952
That's what we're going to talk about tomorrow.

01:44:11.892 --> 01:44:34.751
so they're already talking about something that they either don't have the background to know or they're just lying because that was a while ago that was like more than 10 years ago they already have their own lab in the south of Norway now like they've they've done been there done that already and that was their grad school time like this is

01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:37.772
What he just said is absurd.

01:44:38.113 --> 01:44:42.997
To track how much retraction has occurred across the surface of the brain from each thread.

01:44:43.037 --> 01:44:49.202
And so we're going to both have more threads in the right layer and have better data on how much retraction has occurred.

01:44:49.222 --> 01:44:57.208
If you're a PCI nerd, you might know that being able to control individual Z depth per thread is not something that most neural interface devices offer.

01:44:57.309 --> 01:44:58.950
Most neural interface devices are static.

01:44:59.369 --> 01:45:02.231
fixed rigid array that you push in, and all the retros are on depth.

01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:05.053
To be able to do this is actually a pretty novel part of the robot.

01:45:05.213 --> 01:45:09.916
Yeah, the historical approach is to actually pound in a sort of bed of nails with an air hammer into the brain.

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:10.617
It would look crazy.

01:45:10.777 --> 01:45:12.958
Yeah, just out of camera.

01:45:13.199 --> 01:45:15.280
It sounds somewhat barbaric.

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.542
This is not what we do, but this is what's been done before.

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:20.824
It's literally just hammering in what looks like a bed of nails with the brain.

01:45:21.124 --> 01:45:22.225
Which actually works.

01:45:22.325 --> 01:45:24.225
It's astonishing that it actually works.

01:45:24.425 --> 01:45:27.907
They are doing nothing different except that their wires are smaller.

01:45:27.927 --> 01:45:30.648
It's exactly the same as any other electrode experiment.

01:45:30.668 --> 01:45:32.969
And for them to tell you that it's different is ridiculous.

01:45:33.789 --> 01:45:35.390
They're doing exactly the same thing.

01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:38.151
They're just pushing wires down into the brain.

01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:39.632
Maybe they don't hammer them.

01:45:39.652 --> 01:45:41.673
Maybe they're very fancy how they go down.

01:45:41.713 --> 01:45:44.014
Maybe the robot is very fancy how it goes down.

01:45:44.054 --> 01:45:45.654
It's the same stupid stuff.

01:45:45.674 --> 01:45:47.415
You're going to get the same stupid measurement.

01:45:47.835 --> 01:45:49.276
And that's why he said it works.

01:45:50.578 --> 01:45:54.120
Because this same kind of thing has worked in monkeys for a very long time.

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.181
It's very rudimentary.

01:45:55.221 --> 01:45:56.442
It's a freaking magic trick.

01:45:57.102 --> 01:45:58.063
That was somewhat barbaric.

01:45:58.083 --> 01:46:00.344
This is not what we do, but this is what's been done before.

01:46:00.364 --> 01:46:05.047
It's literally just hammering in what looks like a bed of nails to the brain, which actually works.

01:46:05.107 --> 01:46:06.648
It's astonishing that it actually works.

01:46:06.668 --> 01:46:09.470
Some people have manual, like DBS probes, you're just sticking in by hand.

01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:16.134
Those are several orders of magnitude more volume of brain tissue that you're destroying compared to what we're doing.

01:46:16.354 --> 01:46:18.295
But that deep brain simulation stuff does actually work.

01:46:18.475 --> 01:46:19.636
It actually helps people a lot.

01:46:19.756 --> 01:46:19.916
Yeah.

01:46:20.237 --> 01:46:20.457
Yeah.

01:46:20.497 --> 01:46:20.677
Yeah.

01:46:20.737 --> 01:46:21.798
That's a great product.

01:46:21.878 --> 01:46:25.280
I think we'll be able to do a much more finessed version of that down the road.

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.101
It's really difficult.

01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:32.765
The Neuralink device is something that really absolutely minimizes damage to the brain, absolutely minimizes the load on the patient.

01:46:33.105 --> 01:46:35.687
And the goal is to allow someone to live a completely normal life.

01:46:36.667 --> 01:46:39.268
I mean, it won't even infect your hairline, which is pretty cool.

01:46:39.348 --> 01:46:41.108
Notice that someone even has the device.

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:45.949
So, like I said, with the ability to control your computer and phone, that's our telepathy.

01:46:46.069 --> 01:46:49.790
And then next device, being able to allow people to see that could not see before.

01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:54.111
In fact, you can allow people to see Geordi La Forge in Star Trek in any, whatever.

01:46:55.031 --> 01:46:59.932
He just said Geordi La Forge of Star Trek.

01:47:00.902 --> 01:47:02.062
This is just a lie.

01:47:02.122 --> 01:47:02.802
It's a lie.

01:47:02.882 --> 01:47:04.303
It's such an awful lie.

01:47:04.403 --> 01:47:05.523
It's just ridiculous.

01:47:05.583 --> 01:47:06.283
It's stupid.

01:47:06.443 --> 01:47:07.003
It's a lie.

01:47:09.324 --> 01:47:10.184
It's just awful.

01:47:10.904 --> 01:47:11.144
Yeah.

01:47:11.244 --> 01:47:13.225
Infrared, ultraviolet, radar.

01:47:13.465 --> 01:47:17.546
So I think another way of saying it is that we want to give people superpowers.

01:47:17.846 --> 01:47:25.168
So it's not just that we're restoring your prior brain functionality, but that you actually have functionality far greater than a normal human.

01:47:25.328 --> 01:47:26.128
That's a super big deal.

01:47:26.388 --> 01:47:30.729
And I also think oftentimes the questions that we get a lot is, why do you have to actually go into the brain?

01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:33.750
What if you place it on the surface or outside the skull?

01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:42.373
Basically, the long story short, the physics of how it works, you really need to get the sensors, which are these facing in the brain, next to the source, which is as close to it as possible.

01:47:42.393 --> 01:47:47.495
Otherwise, what you get is you get a population response and not be able to do the level of controls that we believe

01:47:48.075 --> 01:47:57.665
Yeah, maybe a good sort of analogy would be like, if you're trying to understand what goes on in a factory, you need to go into the factory, you can't just put a stethoscope on the wall and try to figure out what's going on.

01:47:57.885 --> 01:47:58.706
Let's try this.

01:48:00.997 --> 01:48:02.258
Let's watch this one.

01:48:02.358 --> 01:48:14.182
Advances in artificial intelligence are leading to medical breakthroughs once thought impossible, including devices that can actually read minds and alter our brains to help treat conditions like anxiety, Alzheimer's.

01:48:14.202 --> 01:48:16.742
But that technology raises privacy concerns.

01:48:16.822 --> 01:48:21.524
That's why Colorado passed a first-of-its-kind law aimed at ensuring our private thoughts remain private.

01:48:21.924 --> 01:48:24.945
Your political reporter Shawn Boyd joins us live from the Capitol tonight.

01:48:25.225 --> 01:48:27.834
Shawn, this is really mind-blowing even to think about.

01:48:28.195 --> 01:48:30.282
Who has access to this technology?

01:48:32.242 --> 01:48:41.308
Karen, everyone, believe it or not, you can buy devices on the internet right now that can, to varying degrees, decode your brainwaves.

01:48:41.408 --> 01:48:53.476
And the technology being developed by the likes of Elon Musk, Apple, Meta, and OpenAI can change, enhance, and control your thoughts, emotions, even your memories.

01:48:53.976 --> 01:48:58.079
It's the dawn of a new era filled with promise and peril.

01:48:58.926 --> 01:49:26.993
you wanted to do you can move your computer with your mind and you can control it with your mind using this device if you think telepathy or mind control is the stuff of science fiction he just put that on his head and he's showing you right now how he is calibrating it and you wanted to do you can move your computer with your mind and you can control it see using this device it said right up in the corner right training look have a new era filled with promise watch and peril

01:49:27.688 --> 01:49:32.050
Anything you wanted to do, you can move your computer with your mind and you can see right training.

01:49:32.110 --> 01:49:32.850
It says right there.

01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:33.910
So he's got to train it.

01:49:34.730 --> 01:49:37.571
You see, he trains it to move, right?

01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:38.872
He trains it to move left.

01:49:38.912 --> 01:49:46.575
He trains it to move up and down and wallah through his skull with a plastic set of, of, of transcranial electrodes.

01:49:46.615 --> 01:49:53.297
They can decode enough brain region, differentiate enough brain activity to tell what you mean.

01:49:54.482 --> 01:49:55.122
Don't you see?

01:49:55.142 --> 01:50:05.570
The distributed signal of the neocortex, as long as you just, if you just, this doesn't imply understanding.

01:50:06.651 --> 01:50:07.391
It's a hack.

01:50:08.812 --> 01:50:14.096
It's a neat hack because moving a mouse on a screen is not that big a deal.

01:50:17.138 --> 01:50:19.720
You can control it with your mind using this device.

01:50:20.262 --> 01:50:25.703
If you think telepathy or mind control is the stuff of science fiction, think again.

01:50:26.003 --> 01:50:34.566
This is kind of like the first consumer-grade brain-computer interface that anyone can have and anyone can control their computer using this technology.

01:50:34.746 --> 01:50:47.949
It's called neurotechnology, and neurologist Sean Pazoski at UCHealth says it's revolutionizing healthcare, enabling people who can't move or speak to do what was previously thought impossible.

01:50:48.129 --> 01:50:49.970
I thought Elon Musk was doing that.

01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:59.418
I thought that he was the only one who could do that because you gotta drill a hole in the brain in order to restore functionality and get people to be able to play Civilization again.

01:51:02.492 --> 01:51:05.534
communicate with just a thought or expression.

01:51:05.694 --> 01:51:14.100
You could use this device to move the cursor to the letter that you wanted, and then if you wanted that letter, you could just smile and give the command to enter that.

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:18.723
This headset, one of 30 devices you can now buy on the internet.

01:51:18.903 --> 01:51:23.086
And then when you stop smiling and just think about it at some point, it will be trained.

01:51:23.106 --> 01:51:29.611
You see, the only difference between these devices and what Elon Musk is doing is the computer behind it.

01:51:30.509 --> 01:51:36.453
These devices are limited because it's a little device with probably no more than a cell phone level computer on it.

01:51:36.493 --> 01:51:40.636
But Elon Musk is doing things a little differently.

01:51:40.696 --> 01:51:47.561
The training program and the computer training that's learning that's happening is a computer, not the device.

01:51:47.861 --> 01:51:51.284
And if it is the device, it's still probably a better computer than these, that's all.

01:51:52.423 --> 01:51:54.605
And it's most likely a separate computer.

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:58.408
And then they put that decoding into the device.

01:51:58.648 --> 01:52:06.854
And so the whole process of building the machine learning network that underlies that interface is probably done outside of the device.

01:52:06.934 --> 01:52:13.239
And then it's eventually loaded into the device, specifically for you, derived from the signals of that device.

01:52:13.279 --> 01:52:21.666
But you could outsource, or you could put that high level computing power that is used to train it, could be on your laptop, just like he's showing.

01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:27.412
And then once the training is over with, then the code can be here.

01:52:27.452 --> 01:52:35.416
Because the decoding is a very small thing when it comes to the limited variable set of moving a mouse around and then wanting to say click or not click.

01:52:37.257 --> 01:52:39.558
It's not an infinite palette of actions.

01:52:39.678 --> 01:52:46.002
It's a very limited spectrum of information and control.

01:52:46.062 --> 01:52:48.523
So it's not all it's cracked up to be.

01:52:51.294 --> 01:53:00.559
You get me to the stage where somebody can fly a remote control helicopter using one of these devices, you still won't be beyond two joysticks.

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:02.460
Do you see that?

01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:09.964
You still won't be beyond doing two joysticks, which could be as easy as two implants or two electrode sets.

01:53:11.255 --> 01:53:11.936
just silly.

01:53:12.036 --> 01:53:15.540
Peer into your brain and in some cases alter it.

01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:17.703
So it is actually modulating.

01:53:17.963 --> 01:53:28.395
And so in some cases alter it so it is modulating this one might have some kind of magnetic signal that it does but that that is still absolute snake oil.

01:53:28.596 --> 01:53:31.279
Stimulating your brain to help you get a better night's sleep.

01:53:31.721 --> 01:53:37.143
The devices promise to not only improve brain function, but identify impairments.

01:53:37.383 --> 01:53:44.066
Pazowski is using the technology at UCHealth to detect epileptic seizures as they happen.

01:53:44.086 --> 01:53:45.606
We were never able to do that before.

01:53:45.746 --> 01:53:51.309
This takes out all the guesswork and allows us to change medications in real time.

01:53:51.329 --> 01:53:53.089
That probably works really well.

01:53:53.129 --> 01:53:54.450
And again, it's not an implant.

01:53:54.630 --> 01:53:58.832
It's just something on your skull reading the signals through your... I mean, it's amazing, right?

01:54:00.034 --> 01:54:02.255
This is how you see through Elon's show.

01:54:02.355 --> 01:54:03.136
It's just dumb.

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:15.243
What it is, what Elon's show is for is to remove the sacredness of what he's doing, to remove the reverence for what we would have, you know, a generation ago, that whole concept would have been stupid.

01:54:15.283 --> 01:54:19.486
A generation ago, you know, it was considered kind of dumb to get a tattoo.

01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:31.736
Certainly it was considered dumb to get a tattoo that wasn't covered by your t-shirt or your shorts.

01:54:32.576 --> 01:54:34.057
Like why would anybody do that?

01:54:37.138 --> 01:54:38.198
You see what I mean here?

01:54:38.978 --> 01:54:44.820
It's been a slow roll for a couple generations to undermine our sense of what is sacred and what isn't.

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.021
To the point where we don't really see our children as sacred.

01:54:51.345 --> 01:54:53.606
The at-home devices are impressive.

01:54:53.666 --> 01:54:56.447
Those being used in the lab are even more so.

01:54:56.887 --> 01:55:13.314
Our brainwaves are like encrypted signals, and using artificial intelligence, researchers have cracked the code, identifying frequencies for specific words to turn thought to text with 40% accuracy.

01:55:13.334 --> 01:55:17.156
40% accuracy when it comes to the difference between a screwdriver and an igloo.

01:55:18.176 --> 01:55:19.177
Holy cow.

01:55:21.368 --> 01:55:23.149
A screwdriver and an igloo.

01:55:23.169 --> 01:55:26.031
I mean, keep in mind what we're talking about here, right?

01:55:26.051 --> 01:55:26.551
For specific words.

01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:29.613
The difference between igloo and screwdriver.

01:55:29.633 --> 01:55:31.735
That's definitely not, um, you know, what drill bit do you want?

01:55:52.543 --> 01:55:53.704
Did you say torque wrench?

01:55:54.445 --> 01:55:55.806
If you choose really disparate words, you know, like

01:56:07.685 --> 01:56:12.731
I don't know, baseball cap and what, birthday cake?

01:56:12.751 --> 01:56:14.153
I mean, I'm trying, geez.

01:56:14.853 --> 01:56:17.456
Igloo and screwdriver was fantastic.

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:18.758
And we're probably talking 80, 90%.

01:56:18.958 --> 01:56:23.864
That I just think it and AI knows what I'm thinking.

01:56:23.964 --> 01:56:26.186
Knife and apartment, also very good.

01:56:26.267 --> 01:56:26.367
Yes.

01:56:27.748 --> 01:56:34.974
Not only do words have distinctive brain patterns, so do conditions like Alzheimer's, anxiety, and addiction.

01:56:35.354 --> 01:56:45.382
Conditions researchers are working to reverse using electrical stimulation to alter the frequencies or regions of the brain where the condition originates.

01:56:45.722 --> 01:56:47.243
The benefits are going to be off the charts.

01:56:48.284 --> 01:56:51.086
Patients are going to have dozens of more options.

01:56:51.506 --> 01:56:53.608
But with the benefits come risks.

01:56:54.013 --> 01:56:58.097
It is some of the most sensitive data that you could possibly share with anyone.

01:56:58.117 --> 01:57:01.360
Oh, so now here we are.

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.321
Now we're realizing what we're doing here.

01:57:03.381 --> 01:57:05.984
This is just normalizing data collection.

01:57:07.765 --> 01:57:19.315
Normalizing you as an experimental animal, normalizing observations about you being the public domain, maybe the private domain or the person who owns the patents domain.

01:57:19.355 --> 01:57:19.696
I don't know.

01:57:21.055 --> 01:57:29.681
They are slowly eroding our idea of sovereignty, especially our kids' idea of sovereignty, because, you know, this technology is unavoidable.

01:57:29.721 --> 01:57:31.542
You're not gonna not wanna have one.

01:57:32.322 --> 01:57:35.885
Once it doesn't hurt your hairline anymore, there'll be no excuse not to adopt it.

01:57:36.105 --> 01:57:43.049
Friends companies could use to discriminate, law enforcement to interrogate, and advertisers to manipulate.

01:57:43.529 --> 01:57:50.354
Government, too, could get into our heads and potentially- Ever since I got this implant, I can't stop going to Chick-fil-A.

01:57:52.518 --> 01:57:57.102
alter our thoughts, emotions, and memories as the technology advances.

01:57:57.402 --> 01:58:01.505
Nobody wants to live in a world where some of these misuses or abuses exist.

01:58:01.725 --> 01:58:16.577
While medical research facilities are subject to private Think about the idea that one of these companies, even if their interface is kind of dumb and it doesn't look very cool on your head, at some point they can just sell all the data that they've collected to somebody else and go out of business.

01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:21.533
And I can almost guarantee you that's exactly what will happen with a lot of these companies.

01:58:21.573 --> 01:58:25.996
Well, we got 20,000 people to put these on and wear them all day.

01:58:26.436 --> 01:58:28.177
So we have that data if you want it.

01:58:35.903 --> 01:58:38.325
Imagine if they also got a COVID test from those people.

01:58:39.551 --> 01:58:45.418
privacy laws, private companies that are amassing large caches of brain data are not.

01:58:45.779 --> 01:58:52.187
And based on a study by the Neural Rights Foundation, two-thirds of... Hey, Rafa Justa, I know who that guy is.

01:58:52.267 --> 01:58:53.608
Funny that he's writing that.

01:58:53.789 --> 01:58:54.870
That's crazy.

01:58:55.891 --> 01:58:59.814
Rafa Joost, I know that guy and he knows a lot about structure and function in the brain.

01:58:59.854 --> 01:59:11.244
That guy actually is a guy that my PhD advisor, Heibert Mansfelder, did his last postdoc with him in New York City before he moved back to Amsterdam and then I was his first grad student.

01:59:11.764 --> 01:59:13.505
So I definitely know who Rafa Just is.

01:59:13.545 --> 01:59:14.226
That's funny.

01:59:14.366 --> 01:59:17.929
...are already sharing or selling the data with third parties.

01:59:18.409 --> 01:59:28.277
The vast majority of them also don't disclose where the data is stored, how long they keep it, who has access to it, and what happens if there's a security breach.

01:59:28.858 --> 01:59:34.963
I wonder if any of those companies back up their servers anywhere else or even have their servers backed up unknowingly, you know?

01:59:35.737 --> 01:59:36.558
Interesting question.

01:59:36.578 --> 01:59:53.737
That's why Pazowski, medical director of the foundation, led the passage of a first-in-the-nation law in Colorado that includes biological or brain data in the State Privacy Act, similar to fingerprints, if the data is being used to identify people.

01:59:53.957 --> 01:59:57.101
This is a first step, but we still have a long way to go.

01:59:57.671 --> 01:59:59.612
and with companies and countries.

01:59:59.672 --> 02:00:02.553
As long as you de-identify it, though, the data's fine.

02:00:02.953 --> 02:00:07.634
Countries racing to access, analyze, and alter our brains.

02:00:07.994 --> 02:00:12.996
Pazoski says privacy protections should be a no-brainer.

02:00:13.156 --> 02:00:14.236
It's everything that we are.

02:00:15.136 --> 02:00:20.298
It's everything about our thoughts, our emotions, our memories, our intentions.

02:00:22.523 --> 02:00:32.465
The new law takes effect August 8th, but it's unclear which companies will be subject to it because, again, it only applies to those that are using the data to identify people.

02:00:32.545 --> 02:00:38.166
It's also unclear how it will be enforced, especially against those companies that are out of the country.

02:00:38.526 --> 02:00:44.747
Pazowski and the Neural Rights Foundation are pushing for a federal law and even a global accord.

02:00:44.827 --> 02:00:52.429
They don't want brain data to end up like DNA data that people sent to genealogy sites only to learn that they shared or sold

02:00:52.549 --> 02:00:54.030
it to a third party.

02:00:55.371 --> 02:00:59.595
The privacy of our mind may be the only privacy we have left.

02:00:59.975 --> 02:01:01.536
Whoa.

02:01:01.877 --> 02:01:03.298
Fascinating.

02:01:03.818 --> 02:01:05.379
Fascinating.

02:01:05.479 --> 02:01:09.142
So how much do these, the only privacy we have left?

02:01:09.182 --> 02:01:09.703
Do they work?

02:01:12.077 --> 02:01:17.020
Most of them are in the $200 to $400 range, for some are in the thousands of dollars.

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:26.285
Because they're marketed as wellness devices, they're not regulated by the FDA, but Pozovsky says the ones that he's tried... Whoa, nice dog!

02:01:26.685 --> 02:01:28.686
Look at that big dog, wow!

02:01:28.746 --> 02:01:30.387
Big ol' mastiff.

02:01:30.507 --> 02:01:38.392
Elon Musk has developed an implantable chip that actually allows you to move a cursor, for example, with just your thoughts.

02:01:39.032 --> 02:01:43.696
And Chad, we're also wondering, can any of these devices actually control a person's thoughts?

02:01:46.039 --> 02:01:52.424
Not a person's, Michaelia, but they have been used to control the thoughts of mice in a lab.

02:01:53.685 --> 02:01:54.806
All right, so much to take in.

02:01:54.867 --> 02:01:59.311
They have been used to control mice in the lab.

02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:01.452
You see how much ridiculous?

02:02:02.734 --> 02:02:03.815
That is just awful.

02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:17.570
And what I want you to see what this is evidence of is that just like they are doing with AI and computer interfaces with the brain and mind reading and mind control and that we can already do it.

02:02:17.610 --> 02:02:20.912
And Blindsight already works in monkeys.

02:02:20.993 --> 02:02:27.857
She said that these devices can't do it in humans yet, but we can already control the thoughts of mice.

02:02:28.018 --> 02:02:30.699
And we cannot, we can't even read the thoughts of mice.

02:02:30.719 --> 02:02:31.660
I mean, are you kidding me?

02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:32.641
This is a joke.

02:02:35.785 --> 02:02:53.241
And just like they are constructing this mythology about AI and brain interface and brain-mind interface and how they're going to be able to, if we don't do it now, the AI is going to become conscious before we can interact with it in a meaningful way, which is what Elon said a couple times in half of that video.

02:02:53.862 --> 02:02:56.865
They have created the illusion of the pandemic.

02:02:57.841 --> 02:03:04.266
They created this illusion by agreeing on what questions to ask in 2020 and the answers to those questions.

02:03:04.767 --> 02:03:10.291
And these people that told us this story, they created this illusion of consensus.

02:03:10.351 --> 02:03:14.755
The arguments on television created this illusion of consensus.

02:03:14.815 --> 02:03:19.919
The arguments that these people engaged in created this illusion of consensus.

02:03:20.019 --> 02:03:26.785
And it's these people that we need to see as clearly as the ones on TV if we're going to have our children escape from this.

02:03:29.329 --> 02:03:34.091
this worst case scenario on the internet must be dispelled as the mythology that it is.

02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:37.572
And the way to dispel it is to make them talk about what they were doing in 2020.

02:03:38.472 --> 02:03:40.593
Where the hell were you in 2021?

02:03:41.673 --> 02:03:44.974
Because none of them were dispelling the myth of the faith.

02:03:45.174 --> 02:03:52.737
Instead, they were intimately involved in making sure that our children believed it, that adults didn't question it.

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.125
and didn't ask the right questions that would get them meaningful progress.

02:03:58.785 --> 02:04:02.849
They didn't ask any questions about the fidelity of RNA in culture.

02:04:03.450 --> 02:04:12.800
They didn't question the idea that, well, they do make copies of this RNA, and they assemble it, and when they can make DNA of it, and they could make a lot of that.

02:04:14.741 --> 02:04:25.303
Jonathan Cooley's right about that, that they actually have this technology in spades because that's how they make venom, that's how they make antibodies, that's how they make insulin, that's how they make all this stuff.

02:04:29.076 --> 02:04:30.356
just bacterial culture.

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:35.678
If they have to make it bigger, they just make several different little plasmids and then stitch them all together in the end.

02:04:36.138 --> 02:04:37.918
They can make RNA from it if they want to.

02:04:37.958 --> 02:04:40.659
They can electroporate the DNA right into a cell culture.

02:04:40.679 --> 02:04:46.500
But whether they apply it to a cell culture or an animal or send it to their friends, this is not virology.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.320
They call this virology.

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.361
It's not virology.

02:04:49.401 --> 02:04:50.601
It's infectious clones.

02:04:51.201 --> 02:05:02.987
And that means that they could use the industrial processes that are used to make venom or the mRNA vaccine or antibodies to make a large quantity of any sequence they wanted to.

02:05:03.027 --> 02:05:04.968
And then PCR and sequencing would find it.

02:05:06.188 --> 02:05:09.790
And if they made a lot of it, you'd find a very high-fidelity signal wherever you put it in.

02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:11.611
It would just be synthetic DNA.

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:13.732
It would just be synthetic RNA.

02:05:13.752 --> 02:05:14.872
It wouldn't be the spread of it.

02:05:15.393 --> 02:05:16.793
It wouldn't be the replication of it.

02:05:16.813 --> 02:05:19.855
It wouldn't be the loss of control of a gain-of-function version of it.

02:05:20.595 --> 02:05:26.417
It would just be a signal that they created using synthetic DNA or RNA.

02:05:26.517 --> 02:05:30.058
And that's indeed what this virology illusion is all about.

02:05:30.618 --> 02:05:37.100
They create these sequences and they passage them in cell culture, and then they claim to have found them on the other end.

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:39.380
And that is gain of function.

02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:40.761
That's it, nothing else.

02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:43.813
They want you to believe this.

02:05:43.974 --> 02:05:46.699
They created this illusion about the worst case scenario.

02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:53.672
They created this illusion about the worst case scenario being a gain of function virus and agreed to agree on it.

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.714
They created that.

02:05:56.701 --> 02:05:58.022
And it's all synthetic DNA.

02:05:58.082 --> 02:06:00.284
It's all possible with synthetic DNA.

02:06:00.324 --> 02:06:13.214
It covers up the idea that all of these illusions are created using nothing more than synthetic DNA and RNA and claiming that it's virology, claiming that it's immunology, claiming that it's vaccines, claiming it's understanding and it's not.

02:06:13.274 --> 02:06:18.397
Just publish the papers and now pandemic potential exists and it's all lies about this stuff.

02:06:18.417 --> 02:06:21.500
There are no viruses there, just sequences.

02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:26.195
Because you can't make a cell do something that it doesn't already do.

02:06:26.275 --> 02:06:28.558
So if these sequences get packaged, so be it.

02:06:28.979 --> 02:06:30.761
Robert Malone definitely knows it.

02:06:31.562 --> 02:06:32.984
I don't think Pierre Kory knows it.

02:06:33.004 --> 02:06:38.932
I think Pierre Kory is just probably regrettably

02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:46.123
participant, a regrettable participation in this illusion, this fight against these truths.

02:06:46.564 --> 02:06:51.827
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system has always been dumb.

02:06:52.347 --> 02:06:56.590
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:06:57.070 --> 02:06:58.391
There are other ways to say this.

02:07:00.031 --> 02:07:05.693
You know, weaponized piles of money got us to argue about the stuff they want us to argue about, and they're still doing it today.

02:07:06.173 --> 02:07:14.976
That's why we don't know the truth about Ukraine, we don't know the truth about Israel, or Russia, or money, or banking, or student loans, or bankruptcy.

02:07:16.276 --> 02:07:16.636
None of it.

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:21.018
Because it's all one great big weaponized pile of money illusion.

02:07:21.998 --> 02:07:25.419
Lots of weaponized piles of money, maybe some of them are Venetian, I don't know.

02:07:26.826 --> 02:07:31.870
Stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:07:31.890 --> 02:07:47.180
And we'll be back again tomorrow with a continuated version of this with some more hardcore science and more hardcore neurobiology to kind of put this into the context of how absurd it actually is.
