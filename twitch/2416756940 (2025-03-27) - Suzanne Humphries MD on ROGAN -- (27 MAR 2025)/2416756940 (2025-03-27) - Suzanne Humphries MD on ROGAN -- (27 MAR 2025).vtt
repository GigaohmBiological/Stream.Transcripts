00:47.315 --> 00:48.095
Hello, Tony.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.356
I see you there, sir.

00:49.436 --> 00:50.736
I'm just getting everything set up.

00:50.776 --> 00:52.057
Brother Spoon, good to see you.

00:52.097 --> 00:53.837
Tony is first in the chat.

00:56.918 --> 00:57.919
Let me see here.

00:57.979 --> 01:10.503
We're going to go... How about that?

01:10.703 --> 01:11.483
That'll be better.

01:12.944 --> 01:13.704
And go like this.

01:16.883 --> 01:18.905
And then let's see if this works.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.629
We can go over here and hit resume.

01:25.651 --> 01:26.692
Excellent connection.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.094
All right, we're going to hit resume.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.555
Ah, good to see you guys.

01:29.595 --> 01:30.456
Good to see everybody.

01:31.257 --> 01:31.977
Good to see everyone.

01:48.410 --> 01:53.133
Trust me, it's real.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.035
It's real.

01:55.195 --> 01:56.976
Full speed, Kevin.

02:35.550 --> 02:42.153
On a western bay and it serves a hundred ships a day.

02:42.594 --> 02:49.237
Lonely sailors pass the time away and talk about their homes.

02:50.097 --> 02:57.641
And there's a girl in this harbor town and she works laying whiskey down.

02:57.741 --> 02:58.802
They say brandy

02:59.924 --> 03:06.473
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:09.992 --> 03:10.712
And I have lied.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.773
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:11.793 --> 03:14.554
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

03:14.654 --> 03:15.715
I try not to be a liar.

03:15.735 --> 03:16.555
I don't want to be a liar.

03:17.136 --> 03:21.918
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

03:22.138 --> 03:35.805
Specialization should make you suspicious because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, and it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be, you know, a little bit suspicious, and that's sort of my starting bias.

03:38.579 --> 03:48.202
John Watts wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.584
The greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

04:06.991 --> 04:32.338
Brandy used to watch his eyes When he told his sailor's story She could feel the ocean fall and rise She saw its rage and glory But he had always told the truth Lord, he was an honest man And Brandy does her best to understand

04:37.995 --> 04:48.659
Tonight, when the bars close down, Brandy walks through a silent town and loves a man who's not around.

04:49.259 --> 04:51.559
She still can't hear him say.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.921
She hears him say, Brandy, you're a fine girl.

04:56.041 --> 04:59.242
What a good wife you would be.

04:59.382 --> 05:05.044
But my life, my love, and my lady is the same.

05:13.641 --> 05:14.802
Such a nice song.

05:15.922 --> 05:18.503
Just like that girl in the background there.

05:18.623 --> 05:20.164
Soph is such a nice girl.

05:21.264 --> 05:25.786
It's just, it's so cool how everything comes together in the end.

05:26.687 --> 05:40.453
It is the birthday month of Brandy Vaughn and I'm happy to be still pushing her message along with any additions that myself and other people have made since.

05:40.813 --> 05:42.394
It's welcome everyone to be here.

05:43.514 --> 05:45.237
I'm really happy to be here myself.

05:46.038 --> 05:57.752
I consider myself lucky to be here and potentially part of this realization of what these people have done and how they've used social media against us.

05:58.373 --> 06:00.295
They can only make admissions at this point.

06:01.276 --> 06:13.463
and then show those admissions to the people that need to see them and everybody else that wouldn't understand these admissions doesn't see them or sees them in a context that doesn't matter.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.485
And that's the trick that they can pull with social media.

06:17.025 --> 06:26.951
That's why they can put the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project on a great big podcast and have him tell lies for about an hour and a half.

06:27.971 --> 06:34.336
a very limited spectrum of debate about a biological mythology that he's at the heart of curating.

06:35.477 --> 06:41.621
They are so committed to this that they would go that far and they have indeed gone that far.

06:42.922 --> 06:52.889
And they have people like Ryan Cole who testified in front of the Senate in Tennessee about the fact that he had done already 150,000 COVID diagnostic tests in his office.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.875
And so these tests are the trap, ladies and gentlemen.

06:58.895 --> 07:02.958
These are the basis for this spectacular commitment to lies.

07:02.999 --> 07:13.849
That's the reason why not only these people have never talked to you about the ridiculous nature of PCR as a diagnostic, but all of these people have never bothered to tell you either.

07:15.387 --> 07:17.388
We gotta take the power back from these charlatans.

07:17.428 --> 07:24.370
This time can definitely be different because this time social media, as powerful as it is, also allows us to see it.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.311
If you start looking in the right way, you can see it.

07:27.351 --> 07:28.271
That's why I have hope.

07:28.711 --> 07:29.892
I have hope that my kids...

07:30.532 --> 07:36.974
My kids are not gonna be vulnerable to this kind of manipulation because my kids already understand that you can lie on YouTube.

07:37.454 --> 07:45.496
That people on YouTube can have contestants on their show that are their friends and pretend that somebody won when in all reality they're all their family members.

07:46.056 --> 07:48.797
Ladies and gentlemen, you know what we're up against.

07:49.397 --> 07:54.499
You know how long we've been up against it and you know how this is a little bit of a crescendo in their operation.

07:55.939 --> 08:06.264
And I think one of the best ways to see through it is to look for people who saw it as it was and said it and dropped everything and realized that there's nothing more important.

08:06.884 --> 08:13.447
You know, you can't figure this stuff out and then still go on with your life and have everything be normal.

08:13.487 --> 08:14.687
That doesn't make any sense.

08:14.747 --> 08:17.468
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice you're hearing is Jonathan J. Cooey.

08:17.848 --> 08:19.989
I'm the chief biologist at Giga Home Biological.

08:20.390 --> 08:23.411
I come to you out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from the planet Earth.

08:24.251 --> 08:30.774
You can find a record of my previous work as an academic biologist on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

08:31.714 --> 08:43.319
Use my last name, Jonathan J. Cooey is my first name, of course, Jonathan J., but you only need JJ on the National Library of Medicine and you will get a clean list of all the papers that I've contributed to.

08:44.819 --> 09:02.727
And more importantly, I think this biology that I've been trying to share over the last couple of years has been available to all the people that have risen in the ranks, has been available to all the people who have risen throughout social media over these last five years.

09:03.227 --> 09:05.448
And they are all consistently ignoring me.

09:06.008 --> 09:11.331
All the people that are associated with the group Panda are ignoring me to the extent to which they even lost all three

09:12.051 --> 09:13.372
presentations that I give.

09:13.912 --> 09:26.181
The people at the National Citizens Inquiry are nothing more than a firehose of confusion and frustration, and they're not helping really anyone get the word out about the truth.

09:26.801 --> 09:31.444
The Wellness Company is, I don't know, a group of people that are selling supplements, I guess.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.145
I don't really know how to characterize them.

09:33.185 --> 09:33.806
They know what's up.

09:34.646 --> 09:43.913
Children's Health Defense is a group of people that all takes incredibly nice salaries with incredibly nice insurance for their children and their family.

09:45.093 --> 09:50.597
They have a very cush job where they work from home and they have not moved the ball.

09:50.617 --> 09:51.958
They don't even have really goals.

09:52.839 --> 09:58.483
Children's Health Defense is about rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear, whatever that means.

09:58.983 --> 10:02.846
Give them as much money as you can, of course, because they're a wonderful organization.

10:03.562 --> 10:09.225
And people like Pierre Corey or Robert Malone or Merrill Nass will tell you all about it.

10:10.146 --> 10:13.288
I helped Children's Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:13.348 --> 10:15.089
complete the book, The Wuhan Cover-Up.

10:15.569 --> 10:19.591
And in the course of that work, I figured out that it wasn't possible.

10:20.092 --> 10:23.974
I figured out the biology and started to understand how I might teach it to my children.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.555
And I think I've succeeded in that.

10:26.055 --> 10:29.017
And now I'm trying to find a way to teach that to others.

10:29.637 --> 10:35.879
I thought maybe going to things like the Red Pill Expo would be ways to get to adults and to see the adults that needed to see me.

10:36.580 --> 10:45.403
I've come to learn that maybe that's also just a great big group of meddlers and not any fault of G. Edward Griffins, but you know, there's just so many of them.

10:45.483 --> 10:50.105
So many people that are willing to lie in order to sabotage the United States of America.

10:50.125 --> 10:57.808
And that's why I'm kind of adopting the United States basketball team and its symbols and the whole idea of being a basketball coach as my

10:58.568 --> 11:21.514
My my shtick because I really want to help people understand this and I want people to understand that these are Exercises that I can't do for you Nobody can get you in shape except for you and nobody can help you to shake the illusion that has been put on you like an elaborate spell of many layers and enchantment like you can't imagine and

11:22.210 --> 11:33.944
has been put on you by the coordinated effort of witting and unwitting participants that have become militarized by the extent to which we use social media.

11:35.239 --> 11:43.028
And although this is a biology program, one of my biggest messages going forward is that social media is a disaster for our children.

11:43.488 --> 11:46.832
And we need to start making and curating our own social media.

11:46.852 --> 11:48.093
And I'm trying to lead the way.

11:48.754 --> 11:51.297
We have a conversation at GigaOM.bio.

11:51.317 --> 11:55.141
We have all of our videos on a YouTube killing.

11:56.543 --> 12:10.320
federatedhoststream.gigaohm.bio slash home thanks ted and we also have our own website gigaohmbiological.com that can also help you get around but essentially all the links that you need to find are at gigaohm.bio

12:11.344 --> 12:12.365
There on the right.

12:12.385 --> 12:18.947
We'll look at that later And if you want to send anything to me and my family you can send it to JJ Cooley at P.O.

12:18.987 --> 12:35.093
Box 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102 I'm just through the tunnel from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where Fred Rogers was doing his thing Can't omit my bird

12:40.643 --> 12:50.549
I'm very excited today because an important voice in the anti-vax movement was on the Joe Rogan podcast.

12:51.189 --> 12:58.793
And it's quite a significant, a lot of people think it's quite a significant advance for our position.

12:58.833 --> 12:59.254
Good morning.

12:59.694 --> 13:00.514
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

13:00.534 --> 13:03.436
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage, although it

13:04.025 --> 13:05.327
Looks a little bit fancier than that.

13:05.387 --> 13:07.109
It really is just the back of my garage.

13:07.149 --> 13:09.112
There was a little shop back here at some point.

13:09.132 --> 13:14.799
There's like some holes in the window for, I presume, like venting, you know, sawdust and stuff like that.

13:16.021 --> 13:17.903
Anyway, it's a nice little room.

13:17.983 --> 13:20.747
It's, I don't know, 12 by 15 or something like that.

13:20.787 --> 13:22.069
You can't use it for anything else.

13:22.969 --> 13:28.875
And so this house just happened to have this one nice little room in the back of the garage And so I'm very lucky.

13:28.915 --> 13:48.733
I have my own little extra bedroom It's it's everyone every man's dream apparently to have their own man cave and I kind of have that I'm pretty lucky to have that I don't get back here enough and get enough stuff done with regard to streaming, but I can tell you now with confidence that starting next week, I think I

13:49.713 --> 13:55.137
A lot of people's opinions about what's happening here at Gigalem Biological are going to change pretty drastically.

13:55.517 --> 13:58.299
We're going to finally move forward with Teaching Biology 101.

13:58.900 --> 14:02.222
I haven't decided yet how many days a week I'm going to do it.

14:02.282 --> 14:04.304
I'll update the schedule over the weekend.

14:04.764 --> 14:12.170
I need to get through today and tomorrow because there's some things going on in the background that are just important to get done.

14:13.010 --> 14:19.774
And when those things are done and settled and I don't have to worry about those balls in the air, then I'm going to take care of scheduling next week.

14:20.675 --> 14:24.998
I don't think you need to expect some kind of five-day-a-week lecture schedule.

14:25.018 --> 14:33.623
I'm going to try and be very careful about how we move forward with these big ideas and how quickly we reveal all of them.

14:35.324 --> 14:37.205
But we are going to try and start out with a

14:38.526 --> 14:48.655
30,000 foot view of a new biology 101 that will help, number one, kind of bring together the whole idea of the pandemic and what really occurred.

14:50.516 --> 15:06.870
And also the sort of the pretenses of my objections to it will all kind of be tied together with a new biology 101 because we need to sort of start with a foundation different than whatever is in this Campbell biology, for example, that

15:07.369 --> 15:11.611
that's down there that they use at universities, et cetera.

15:12.472 --> 15:14.953
Today is March 27th, 2025.

15:16.394 --> 15:18.795
I think I probably should switch down here to the bottom.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.037
Let me just quick do that.

15:24.417 --> 15:29.038
This is a message of hope that is not for everyone, but is for anyone.

15:29.858 --> 15:32.079
And it's a tough one to swallow.

15:32.159 --> 15:35.679
The main message, of course, is that this is for all the marbles.

15:35.699 --> 15:37.440
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

15:37.460 --> 15:46.002
You need to start thinking, if you're seeing me for the first time, you need to start expanding the way that you think about your plans and think about how you understand history,

15:47.602 --> 16:03.852
because the people that are working against us, that I oftentimes refer to as the slavers, the slavers are actually thinking on a multi-generational timescale and they're thinking about using your grandkids as lab rats and your children as lab rats.

16:03.873 --> 16:05.714
They're not thinking about you much anymore.

16:06.414 --> 16:14.784
They might be thinking about, you know, not letting you go to waste and collecting as much basic data as they can, but they understand that this is a test run.

16:15.384 --> 16:25.456
It is a dry run to assembling the basic working parts that would be necessary to accomplish their goal, which is to sort of understand the evolution of the

16:26.216 --> 16:37.938
the human species on a molecular level, and then start to usefully augment that process outside of, you know, heredity and generational change.

16:39.678 --> 16:41.659
Those are big, those are big ideas, right?

16:41.699 --> 16:53.881
It's not a, it's not a message for everyone, if we're talking about people who want to control the future evolution of the species and think about their actions in that context.

16:55.017 --> 17:01.183
If you're thinking about the future evolution of the species and you see a person that you don't think should contribute,

17:02.992 --> 17:05.034
there are a few things you can do about it, right?

17:05.094 --> 17:20.869
And if you, if your overarching motivation as a very rich person is something to do with controlling the evolution of the species, and now you can start to maybe get a grasp of what we're dealing with here.

17:20.929 --> 17:26.374
And for those of you who've been here for a long time, I hope I'm just kind of saying it in a way that I haven't said it before.

17:27.449 --> 17:46.079
Now, in the context of what happened in 2020 through 2022, I've been clear in my previous streams and part of what we will teach in the next month or so will be the basic biology that underlies this foundational truth that pure oxygen causes ARDS.

17:46.219 --> 17:55.764
And there are textbook chapters and there are primary literature papers pre-pandemic, sometimes by decade, that will teach us this.

17:57.148 --> 18:03.653
And so we don't need to ask doctors, we don't need to, you know, wonder what's going on here.

18:03.693 --> 18:08.257
We just need to realize that this information was out there.

18:09.017 --> 18:10.719
This statement is a fact.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.482
And that means that there was a lot of murder and lies here.

18:16.964 --> 18:21.067
The second thing is, is that PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool.

18:21.487 --> 18:23.389
And once we explain the biological

18:26.013 --> 18:38.164
facts, really, the biological observations that make that true, then we'll know that an additional quantity of this can only be described as murder and lies.

18:38.204 --> 18:53.037
And then finally, when we get doctors to realize that not using antibiotics for pneumonia, or for urinary tract infection, or for sepsis, perhaps even, would be, of course, murder.

18:54.321 --> 19:02.783
And all three of these things occurred en masse, and I think are at the heart of the lie that is the pandemic.

19:02.823 --> 19:09.644
Now, the problem is, is that we have a bunch of people on the left and the right that are certain they're right, that have never, ever said this.

19:10.304 --> 19:16.205
There's nobody in Trump's HHS that has said any of these things.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.186
There's nobody, uh,

19:19.486 --> 19:36.001
on the Trump administration that understands how many Americans were just simply murdered and then many more Americans were just simply expected to die and swept together a little bit with a little bit of these things just to help it out, to make the timing useful.

19:37.743 --> 19:43.809
And with a little pure oxygen and a little less antibiotics, it would be very easy to sculpt

19:44.898 --> 19:54.485
this expected rise in all-cause mortality into something that could be misconstrued as a crazy crisis, a pandemic.

19:57.067 --> 20:03.332
And so if we explain it that simply, then it's also kind of easy to understand how we're here.

20:08.493 --> 20:20.476
It's almost like it was scripted, you know, to use Tulsi Gabbard as a person that would be in the administration and everybody would think is great and could go on, was John Joe Rogan and all this other stuff.

20:21.036 --> 20:26.558
And then within what, two weeks of her being in the administration, she seems to have dropped the ball.

20:27.438 --> 20:31.739
And she says in front of Congress that she can't remember the conversation.

20:32.240 --> 20:37.081
Now remember, this is the director of national intelligence, whatever that post means.

20:38.646 --> 20:42.809
Does she have more power than that lady with white hair that's sitting next to Trump all the time?

20:42.849 --> 20:47.092
Does she know more than that lady with white hair who's sitting next to Trump all the time?

20:47.653 --> 20:51.155
Or is the Director of National Intelligence more important than the Chief of Staff?

20:51.195 --> 21:06.987
I don't understand what the Director of National Intelligence does, but it's very odd that two weeks into the job, she's in front of Congress testifying about a signal chat that she's not sure if it was classified or not, because she can't remember the conversation

21:09.946 --> 21:11.386
What happens if she resigns?

21:11.426 --> 21:14.887
Would you be willing to accept that this was all just a fumble?

21:20.149 --> 21:28.351
Do you think it's just a fumble that the person that they appointed to the CDC is being appointed instead of the whole CDC being dismantled?

21:34.833 --> 21:37.974
I don't like to be the guy who's got to bring this message of hope.

21:39.206 --> 21:40.487
because it isn't for everyone.

21:41.487 --> 21:42.348
And that makes it hard.

21:43.429 --> 21:44.790
It makes a lot of people angry.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.192
But nobody has come to our rescue.

21:49.272 --> 21:52.074
And I don't see any evidence of anyone coming anytime soon.

21:52.114 --> 21:55.196
We're going to need to pull our big boy pants on and do it ourselves.

21:56.017 --> 22:04.142
We're going to have to do it ourselves by learning the biology that edifies these ideas, that their illusion requires our participation.

22:04.182 --> 22:06.984
If we stop, first of all, this whole thing ends.

22:09.335 --> 22:12.077
Transfection, they always knew that's what it was.

22:12.197 --> 22:15.660
Transformation, the adenovirus, Johnson & Johnson.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.281
Transfection, the mRNA.

22:17.662 --> 22:28.030
They always knew that these were pre-existing technologies that were being lied about as novel developments, as investigational vaccines.

22:28.751 --> 22:37.678
Then, of course, once you realize the biology of RNA doesn't support a infinite, you know, self-sustaining molecule,

22:38.817 --> 22:43.580
then you realize that the whole idea of a pandemic is just that an RNA coated in fat can do that.

22:43.660 --> 22:44.580
That's ridiculous.

22:46.081 --> 22:49.143
And finally, intramuscular injection is dumb.

22:49.183 --> 22:56.067
This is something that I've been waiting for someone, anyone to explain to me, you know, the exceptions to this rule.

22:56.527 --> 23:05.612
And there hasn't been an MD that will touch it with a 10 foot pole because in reality, this is probably the easiest way to dispel their enchantment.

23:06.476 --> 23:17.390
It's not about talking about adjuvants or giving less vaccines or giving them later or don't vaccinate when people are sick or any of these things are just ridiculous.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.431
Oh, it's the MMR.

23:18.491 --> 23:19.452
No, it's flu shots.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.575
No, it's Tylenol after the flu shot.

23:24.673 --> 23:26.937
It's intramuscular injection being dumb.

23:27.078 --> 23:33.671
If intramuscular injection is dumb, especially when combined with antibiotics, then why talk about antibiotics?

23:33.711 --> 23:36.737
Why not talk about intramuscular injection being dumb first?

23:40.987 --> 23:47.355
And that's the reason why I'm a little frustrated, and you should be too, that we've had this language pretty down pat for a while.

23:48.055 --> 23:56.726
And like Brandy Vaughn figured out the hard way, a lot of these people just won't quite say it, and certainly not anywhere where they'll reach a lot of people.

23:59.241 --> 24:04.705
and they're definitely not just gonna say the words, the US vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

24:04.745 --> 24:10.489
And why, how can you, if you're on YouTube and you're thinking I'm nuts, how could you figure this out for yourself?

24:10.529 --> 24:25.100
Well, what you could do is you could go on Google and you could try to find the vaccine schedule, the recommendations in other countries like Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Germany, the UK, go where you want.

24:25.908 --> 24:26.848
And just count up.

24:27.469 --> 24:28.669
How many do they recommend?

24:28.729 --> 24:29.730
What do they recommend?

24:30.250 --> 24:31.850
And see what ages they recommend.

24:32.251 --> 24:40.254
And understand that the earlier that you hit a small child in the head with a baseball bat, the more likely it is to damage them permanently.

24:41.794 --> 24:43.675
And I think that's not too hard to understand.

24:43.715 --> 24:55.440
If you hit a newborn baby in the head with a baseball bat, it's much more likely that they're not going to grow up sharp than if you hit a three-year-old on the head with a baseball bat in the exact same tink

24:59.337 --> 25:00.698
That's just, that's easy.

25:04.341 --> 25:08.723
Now, that argument is not to say that intramuscular injection is good.

25:08.783 --> 25:15.828
It's to say that any insult, any injury is better the later it happens in development.

25:15.868 --> 25:23.293
But that is not an argument for understanding what is going on, what the fundamental problem with intramuscular injection is.

25:28.547 --> 25:32.970
And I think the people that are learning this biology are starting to assemble.

25:33.731 --> 25:36.653
I'm starting to get the feeling that there is a little panic happening.

25:37.894 --> 25:39.555
A little scramble is happening.

25:39.595 --> 25:43.778
I don't think they intended for me or ever thought that I would get on Kim Iverson.

25:44.839 --> 25:46.901
Let's just summarize this very easy.

25:47.802 --> 25:53.946
There's only one chance for these people to ever sample from a population around 10 billion.

25:55.007 --> 25:56.168
If their plans work,

25:57.452 --> 26:02.634
the population of the earth is going to reduce over the next 50 years to around 2 billion.

26:03.334 --> 26:19.961
And so at that stage, the amount of genetic and medical data and the variance, the variability, the diversity in that information available will be an order of magnitude less.

26:20.422 --> 26:21.082
Can you see that?

26:22.205 --> 26:41.617
And so if they know on a multi-generational time plan that these people are only going to be around for 50 years, then they can also make the choice that when we reach this peak, that we will transition into a data collection of these people that will not let this opportunity go to waste.

26:41.757 --> 26:49.322
So that when the population of the earth reduces naturally down to 2 billion again, because the population pyramids are that way,

26:50.888 --> 27:03.142
we will have collected a lot or most of this data without letting this opportunity, once in many generations, high in the human population on Earth.

27:03.702 --> 27:11.051
Maybe this is one of the reasons why they allowed the population to go as high as it would, so that they would have this much data to collect.

27:12.603 --> 27:14.164
never thought about that until right now.

27:14.224 --> 27:25.767
Imagine that it was like a race to see who could get as many people as possible to set up a data collection sort of scramble as the population pyramid changed.

27:25.847 --> 27:35.990
And now imagine that the fear that the story that they tell in the secret meetings in the West is that the Chinese already have more people.

27:36.670 --> 27:42.012
And the worst part is that their genome is more homogeneous, which means that their

27:42.910 --> 27:59.456
their data will be more valuable to them than our data would be valuable to us because our population is so much more genetically diverse that it is in some ways more difficult to extract easy information from it.

28:00.694 --> 28:02.756
And so you could tell the story both ways, of course.

28:02.796 --> 28:20.775
You could also say that the American population is much more valuable because the Chinese population, being more homogeneous as a genotype, would therefore need less examples of the same game to understand it than this more multi-racial, multi-ethnic, whatever you want to call it,

28:21.856 --> 28:23.117
group of people in America.

28:23.777 --> 28:31.704
But understand that this conversation that I'm having is the conversation that they have, that they have had, that they think about.

28:33.745 --> 28:39.370
That's why Kevin McKernan is on that thing saying there's only like 800 variants of the human genome.

28:39.690 --> 28:43.273
800 variants, and each one of them could be considered a separate game.

28:44.636 --> 28:50.422
that needs a whole set of games to feed into the AI in order to solve.

28:50.482 --> 29:00.552
So then if we solve all 800 games, then we'll have some clue about how, what, how do those 800 games combine then?

29:01.072 --> 29:07.599
It's a combinatorial problem that they've been lying about for so long, and it's the Human Genome Project.

29:08.672 --> 29:15.627
It's this idea that it's just as simple as collecting everybody's genome, sequencing it and feeding it into an AI.

29:15.667 --> 29:19.895
And then we'll be able to reorganize stuff and make stuff super humans.

29:21.616 --> 29:23.858
That's the story they've been telling since the 50s.

29:23.918 --> 29:26.620
That's the story that we've been talking about in all these books.

29:27.180 --> 29:42.811
That's the story that I think, and Mark thinks, Joshua Lederberg was a part of, that Hilary Koprowski was a part of, that Stanley Plotkin, and Tony Fauci, and Murray Gardner, and Bob Gallo, and David Baltimore, and the list is endless.

29:43.131 --> 29:45.113
They were all involved in this project.

29:46.946 --> 29:58.649
Because even before they knew what they were going to call the genetic material, what they would know they need to sequence, before they had even found anything like that in the nucleus of a cell, they already knew what they wanted to do.

29:59.629 --> 30:01.149
They were already writing books about it.

30:01.789 --> 30:06.350
They wanted to take control of the evolution of the species and it was imperative.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.811
It was their moral obligation as smart men to do it.

30:11.854 --> 30:13.896
And the Human Genome Project is part of that.

30:14.016 --> 30:19.840
And so need to understand that the Human Genome Project doesn't even know what all the data is.

30:20.481 --> 30:22.342
So they got to take a couple cracks at it.

30:22.402 --> 30:23.843
That's going to take a generation.

30:24.424 --> 30:27.947
They got to try and see if they collect the genomes of all the college kids.

30:28.547 --> 30:38.336
And then they use AI to go back to the Epic database of all their medical records and interface back and see if they match those up and then put that in an AI.

30:38.376 --> 30:39.637
Do they learn anything or not?

30:39.697 --> 30:43.100
They don't know the answer to that question yet because that's ongoing.

30:44.441 --> 30:45.882
Is that all the data or not?

30:45.942 --> 30:46.583
They don't know.

30:46.623 --> 30:50.807
But when they finally figure out that, no, I guess we're going to need more data than that, then they'll go get it.

30:52.659 --> 31:02.808
And so let's just pretend that in 10 years, they figure out what all the data is, and all the data ends up to be well, we need to sequence the baby right after it's born.

31:02.848 --> 31:16.740
And then we need to look at the, the epigenetic, the methylation of the DNA in every cell in that kid's body throughout his lifetime, at least until he's through puberty, and then we'll understand stuff.

31:19.465 --> 31:25.307
And that's not even a scratching the surface of what I think the irreducible complexity of that data might be.

31:25.647 --> 31:42.792
And you can already see how easy it would be to create layer and layer and layer of more data on top of that, which would create an impossibility in the computing, in the idea that they would store that data somewhere, nevermind store that data and have it accessible to a machine learning algorithm.

31:47.108 --> 31:50.750
nevermind get to the point where they can make predictions that can be validated.

31:50.791 --> 32:01.197
They've already done these little silly things, you know, like we could transfect somebody's liver and replace the protein that's missing and fix their congenital defect.

32:03.799 --> 32:04.460
That didn't work.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.001
Jesse Gelsinger can tell you that.

32:08.182 --> 32:14.086
Their little assumptions, their predictions, they've never come true.

32:18.706 --> 32:20.748
So they're just going, they got to keep going.

32:21.289 --> 32:34.504
And that's what this this goal, you know, they got to keep going, because this, this is their one opportunity, this generation, or this two generations, where it's going to be around 10 billion people, this is their last chance.

32:36.442 --> 32:44.506
They've only got about 70 years to collect this data and more importantly, to convince our kids to allow their baby's data to be collected.

32:44.566 --> 32:46.927
And then after that, the population is going to collapse.

32:47.467 --> 32:58.432
And that's why they put these people on the internet that are all associated with virology and with vaccines and with public health and with the Human Genome Project.

33:05.003 --> 33:19.589
So Susan Humphreys was on Joe Rogan and I thought it would be appropriate to first maybe watch a Susan Humphreys from 2018 at Cal Jam where she was interviewed by some chick named Brandy Vaughn.

33:19.649 --> 33:29.834
Because maybe we can see a difference between what this lady would say in a 15 minute spontaneous interview in 2018 versus what she says in the first 20 minutes

33:33.471 --> 33:38.657
of a two and a half hours, say as much as you want to, to this donor opportunity.

33:39.642 --> 33:48.588
and see if she can hit any home runs here and hit any home runs there or whether she hits any home runs or avoids hitting home runs.

33:48.628 --> 33:49.489
What she looks like.

33:49.529 --> 33:50.229
Is she happy?

33:50.809 --> 34:02.978
Remember, we watched a video with Brandy and with Polly from exactly the same event where Polly looks very uncomfortable with being called one of Brandy's heroes.

34:03.438 --> 34:09.322
I wonder what Suzanne Humphreys will look like when Brandy says Suzanne is one of her heroes.

34:10.681 --> 34:11.234
Take it away.

34:15.495 --> 34:21.837
Hi everyone, live from Cal Jam again, and this time I have Dr. Suzanne Humphries, who's one of my major heroes.

34:22.277 --> 34:27.439
So I'm really, really excited for this video and to meet her and talk to her more.

34:27.539 --> 34:29.680
I've met her once before, but of course that wasn't enough.

34:30.880 --> 34:35.442
And she's here at Cal Jam speaking about her latest book called Rising from the Dead.

34:36.062 --> 34:37.223
And it's an amazing book.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.703
Everyone should get it.

34:39.443 --> 34:43.985
And I wanted to ask her what she's going to talk about tomorrow at the conference.

34:44.085 --> 34:50.569
It's funny, right, that Brandy doesn't have a book, but Susan Humphreys has like two, three, I don't know.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.571
I mean, Pierre Kory got an Ivermectin book.

34:53.691 --> 34:57.234
Jessica Rose is in like three people's books.

34:58.034 --> 35:01.497
Matt Eret and his wife have published like six books in four years.

35:03.498 --> 35:09.122
Robert Malone's on his third book, if you don't include the Coronavirus Guide to Safety book.

35:11.189 --> 35:13.211
You know, James Lyons Wyler got a book.

35:13.631 --> 35:19.876
Even Tom Cowan had a book before the pandemic that didn't really say anything, but kind of said something about chronic disease.

35:21.037 --> 35:26.541
It's really extraordinary when you see it that, I mean, it's just remarkable.

35:27.202 --> 35:33.187
I want to believe that this is a good guy, but I don't think I'm going to be there by the end of this video.

35:35.074 --> 35:40.115
Well, I can tell you kind of what I'm going to talk about, but I can also tell you that people can live stream it.

35:40.175 --> 35:48.517
If you go to Dr. Suzanne Humphreys on my webpage and you'll see how you can go and live stream it for a cost, but the cost goes to charity, 100% to charity.

35:49.077 --> 35:51.818
So if you can't get here, you can go and check that out.

35:52.498 --> 35:57.439
So the title of my talk is Vaccination Manipulating a Mystery.

35:59.339 --> 36:03.440
And it's basically my opinion on the potential for having safe vaccines.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.125
So what is your opinion on safe vaccines?

36:08.867 --> 36:11.371
Well, I think I'd rather tell you that tomorrow night rather than tonight.

36:11.612 --> 36:13.455
I mean, that's pretty extraordinary, right?

36:13.575 --> 36:16.120
I mean, that's kind of where we are.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.887
Brian Hooker could have said that these are transfections.

36:21.087 --> 36:23.248
They're not investigational vaccines.

36:23.709 --> 36:30.575
And I've been fighting the previous vaccine schedule for like 10 years because my son was injured by them.

36:30.615 --> 36:36.860
And I'm not really sure how it happened, but I've been questioning the whole idea of vaccination since like 2012, but he didn't say that.

36:41.129 --> 36:54.336
If she really thinks that vaccines are just poisoning kids with an intramuscular injection, then I don't know if that's a message that you should put behind a paywall or goof around about saying into somebody's cell phone recording.

36:56.537 --> 37:04.541
I would never say, well, intramuscular injection is dumb, but I can't tell you that right now, but you can check my website for the truth.

37:06.522 --> 37:11.571
Why would I not at any opportunity try to spread the truth if I knew it?

37:13.594 --> 37:16.199
That's what Brandy does, but Brandy's gonna tolerate it.

37:16.219 --> 37:16.619
You'll see.

37:16.679 --> 37:18.983
Brandy doesn't understand yet.

37:19.044 --> 37:19.304
This is 2018.

37:20.794 --> 37:21.034
All right.

37:21.054 --> 37:24.135
I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, you don't want to ruin it.

37:24.155 --> 37:25.496
Yeah, definitely.

37:26.256 --> 37:28.777
Well, you can live stream it on her Facebook page.

37:29.538 --> 37:38.341
And also, you know, what's really going on here, of course, is that Brandy knows and hopes that the message is that all vaccinations are bad.

37:41.923 --> 37:42.043
And

37:43.436 --> 37:47.937
It still hasn't dawned on her that that's not what Suzanne is going to say.

37:48.297 --> 37:55.058
It hasn't dawned on her that this message is going to be so convoluted and obfuscated that there will be no main points.

37:56.318 --> 38:00.279
Yet you'll see it in this video that that's exactly what's going to happen.

38:00.359 --> 38:08.940
And more importantly, I have no doubt in my mind when I play the Joe Rogan video, it's not going to be anywhere near.

38:10.061 --> 38:11.941
First, let me start with an elevator pitch.

38:13.140 --> 38:15.622
so that everybody can understand the big picture.

38:15.783 --> 38:17.404
It's never gonna be that way.

38:17.464 --> 38:18.205
It's not here.

38:18.725 --> 38:20.967
She's never done it on stage with CHD.

38:21.588 --> 38:22.509
Nobody ever does.

38:24.090 --> 38:27.454
It's always about come to my website, come here to find it.

38:28.495 --> 38:31.477
I'm sorry, intramuscular injection is dumb.

38:31.718 --> 38:33.459
I don't have an answer yet.

38:33.559 --> 38:36.822
None of these doctors have been able to say, well, you know, I guess I,

38:37.782 --> 38:39.723
I guess I could say it that way.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.444
None of them, they all ignore it.

38:41.545 --> 38:44.847
And there's a reason why it's gotta be more complicated.

38:44.907 --> 38:50.190
Why it was MMR and measles virus in the gut with Andrew Wakefield.

38:51.731 --> 38:54.873
Why it was separate shots instead of the MMR together.

38:55.414 --> 38:56.955
Why it was the gut.

38:57.315 --> 38:59.416
There is a reason for all of that.

39:04.139 --> 39:06.141
Does anyone have questions for Suzanne?

39:07.409 --> 39:10.992
I know we have a lot of people out there who love all of her work in Dissolving Illusions.

39:11.132 --> 39:16.677
Oh, by the way, I share that book all the time and all of the research that went into it.

39:17.637 --> 39:27.840
So I think it's one of the keystone, keystones of the foundation of really proving that diseases didn't decline necessarily because of vaccines, not like we're told.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.020
And, you know, it's really about profit over health.

39:32.281 --> 39:37.102
So, and I really, you know, I love the way you speak because you tell the truth, right?

39:37.262 --> 39:42.723
And like the full truth and not maybe, you know, sugarcoating it or anything like that.

39:42.863 --> 39:44.484
So I really appreciate that because,

39:46.224 --> 39:52.425
you know, it's important that we have a lot of truth-tellers in the movement and, you know, getting that information out there, so.

39:52.665 --> 39:54.866
I think we should thank Roman Bistrianic also.

39:54.926 --> 39:55.346
Ah, yes!

39:55.386 --> 40:10.248
Because, like, I get all the blame for the book, but he should get all the praise, really, because he actually, it was his idea to write the book, he started it, he found all of the data, he made all the graphs himself, he did most of the historical research, and then I wrote the medical stuff.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.969
So, it was a... No, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.

40:16.548 --> 40:21.513
But you can go on X and find that guy very, very active.

40:23.876 --> 40:26.899
And very specifically, sometimes even active against me.

40:32.745 --> 40:34.948
There's something going on here.

40:35.628 --> 40:38.611
If you can't simply say, as a doctor,

40:39.448 --> 40:45.212
who's been working on this for years, that intramuscular injection itself might be the problem.

40:45.653 --> 40:54.119
There's no explanation for somebody not getting there, especially with what she says in this video.

40:56.221 --> 41:00.104
It was a collaborative effort, but without that, without Roman, there would be no dissolving.

41:00.244 --> 41:00.824
I would trust me.

41:00.844 --> 41:01.545
I would have never.

41:01.925 --> 41:02.746
In this book,

41:03.993 --> 41:06.255
We talk about polio virus.

41:06.836 --> 41:09.178
In this book, we talk about smallpox.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.863
In this video, we're not gonna talk about polio.

41:14.883 --> 41:16.944
We're gonna talk about flu shots.

41:19.487 --> 41:25.232
So in this book, she claims that Roman got all the data, made all the graphs,

41:27.116 --> 41:39.920
and showed that the collapse of disease was due to sanitation and water and good food, probably just sanitation and water really, and antibiotics.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.341
And this whole book, right?

41:46.021 --> 41:49.723
After writing this whole book in when?

41:49.743 --> 41:54.504
2013, the same year that Brian Hooker was questioning the vaccine schedule in general,

41:55.998 --> 42:00.799
The same year that Brian Hooker was not blaming it on one shot at all.

42:00.819 --> 42:10.921
2013, we are in 2025 and she was just on the Joe Rogan podcast.

42:11.381 --> 42:14.922
She can't go back from wherever she is in 2018.

42:15.002 --> 42:17.283
If she had a book in 2013, can she?

42:17.323 --> 42:18.603
She can't go backwards, can she?

42:25.089 --> 42:37.034
If she didn't know intramuscular injection was bad in 2013, and she didn't know it was bad enough to just say it in 2018, standing next to someone who could say it already in 2016, stop lying!

42:37.054 --> 42:39.515
What's going on here?

42:52.295 --> 42:53.675
I've never been able to do that book on my own.

42:53.755 --> 42:58.456
I look at that book now and I just go, wow, like, I don't know how this happened, but yeah.

42:58.516 --> 42:59.417
Cause I love that book.

42:59.477 --> 43:16.540
I mean, so for those of you who are still a little bit new to all of this, um, dissolving illusions is an amazing book that shows that, um, really what we've been told about vaccines saving us from all of these epidemics and all of that, um, is not the full picture and it goes into, you know, the historical data.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.741
There's great, uh, graphs on there.

43:19.521 --> 43:19.601
Um,

43:20.401 --> 43:31.091
And, you know, they really did a ton of research into the historical data, the real history, not the pharma propagandized history that, you know, wants to sell vaccines at all costs.

43:31.931 --> 43:33.012
Well, at the cost of our health.

43:33.032 --> 43:38.357
If you go to dissolvingillusions.com, you can see all the graphs in color for free.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.259
You can see the author's introduction for free.

43:41.279 --> 43:42.521
You can see Jane Donegan's.

43:42.581 --> 43:44.502
I mean, how does that all happen, right?

43:44.562 --> 43:45.403
I don't understand.

43:45.423 --> 43:47.084
I have like three people

43:47.825 --> 43:53.489
that support this stream and then 140 other people that give 10 bucks a month and that's it.

43:54.529 --> 44:08.378
That's how we make our whatever it is $3,500 or $4,000 a month that pays the rent here besides extra work that I do at the gym and extra work that my wife does as a yoga teacher which brings in like 100 bucks a week.

44:10.697 --> 44:23.407
How is it that these people have like book deals with co-authors that, I don't know, do all the research for them and make all the graphs themselves and have the idea for the book.

44:23.447 --> 44:27.209
And then they just get a website where you can see it all right there.

44:27.750 --> 44:32.553
And I'm gonna give a talk about it, but I can't tell you right now and we're raising everything for charity.

44:33.954 --> 44:36.276
What in the nine hells is going on?

44:36.336 --> 44:38.178
Why didn't anybody do that for Brandy?

44:38.998 --> 44:40.019
She came from Merck.

44:44.565 --> 44:58.917
Why did Polly get 90 billboards about autism with her own picture on it in the UK in the 90s and then get to move to America around the same time that Andrew Wakefield did and then this shit started?

45:01.860 --> 45:05.303
The MMR, the adjuvants,

45:07.639 --> 45:09.880
And they were so good at their messaging.

45:09.940 --> 45:15.461
They were so much warriors that they saved practically nobody's kids.

45:20.263 --> 45:24.564
And save Brandy, nobody even saved their own kids in this movement.

45:25.572 --> 45:47.021
amazing forward and I believe you can see all of the photographs and maybe like the first page of each chapter at dissolvingillusions.com Yes, and you know what I just met Jane last week in London, and she's amazing I really have a lot of respect for her for her work as well and So what would you tell a new parent?

45:48.177 --> 45:48.898
about vaccines.

45:49.198 --> 46:07.150
I would tell the new parent to talk to an old parent, especially an old parent who has children that are 20 years old or higher, that they've never vaccinated and ask them how their health was, how many rounds of antibiotics they had, how many doctor visits they had, how many chronic diseases they have, how they dealt with illnesses when they come up.

46:07.630 --> 46:12.313
And I would get a chiropractor on board with your, for your primary care health for your family.

46:12.553 --> 46:16.036
Now chiropractor, I don't, I don't know what to say about that.

46:16.056 --> 46:17.737
That's a weird thing to drop in there.

46:19.118 --> 46:37.910
And talking to parents with kids that are unvaccinated is a nice curveball, indirect way of saying, I guess what she's going to say tomorrow, which is that unvaccinated kids are the healthiest, are healthy, which is really what you should say, right?

46:37.970 --> 46:38.770
That's the answer.

46:39.511 --> 46:42.353
Not talk to other parents because then that's anecdotal.

46:43.493 --> 46:44.334
You're the doctor.

46:46.874 --> 46:48.135
Talk to other parents.

46:48.816 --> 46:51.198
The doctor is saying, talk to other parents.

46:51.218 --> 46:54.381
Should I talk to other parents also about the infection in my leg?

46:56.623 --> 47:00.326
Should I talk to other parents about how to set my bones when they break?

47:01.147 --> 47:02.888
What should I talk to you about?

47:06.251 --> 47:08.273
I'm sorry, I find this to be kind of a cop-out.

47:09.440 --> 47:14.163
She's an MD who claims she's putting everything on the line, but then what do you say to new parents?

47:14.283 --> 47:16.944
Talk to other parents that have unvaccinated kids?

47:17.325 --> 47:18.345
How do I find those?

47:18.405 --> 47:21.047
What if I don't have friends that have unvaccinated children?

47:21.087 --> 47:21.827
Then what do I do?

47:22.247 --> 47:23.268
How do I get an answer?

47:24.589 --> 47:30.052
This is the biggest cop-out bullshit ever here on a Facebook video that nobody's watching.

47:31.013 --> 47:32.473
It's a safe audience.

47:33.334 --> 47:34.555
It's her Facebook.

47:37.036 --> 47:38.517
Talk to other parents?

47:41.260 --> 47:49.143
And what if I have a couple of parents who have an unvaccinated kid that's sick some other way or has some other problem, then what do I do then?

47:49.183 --> 47:49.524
How do I?

47:51.164 --> 47:52.725
So much bullshit.

47:53.605 --> 48:02.749
And research as much as you can on both sides, because you know, the worst thing for me is to see somebody just listen to somebody off the cuff and not vaccinate.

48:03.310 --> 48:08.552
And then when they- Now just do this thought experiment for me so that you can see why I'm angry.

48:10.829 --> 48:23.157
If vaccination, intramuscular injection is no good, then it is medically equivalent to hitting a child on the head with an aluminum baseball bat.

48:26.439 --> 48:27.559
And it's kind of random, right?

48:27.599 --> 48:28.460
How hard do you hit them?

48:29.020 --> 48:32.662
Well, you got to make a sound for it to qualify as hitting them.

48:32.742 --> 48:34.924
So try to do it without hurting them.

48:35.044 --> 48:39.987
That's basically what they do then with intramuscular injection if it's not good.

48:42.028 --> 48:52.856
So then the answer has a doctor to something that I think she understands as equivalent to hitting a kid on the head with a baseball bat.

48:53.316 --> 48:56.238
She says, do research on both sides.

48:57.299 --> 49:01.862
She says, talk to parents who haven't hit their kid on the head with a baseball bat.

49:05.765 --> 49:07.086
Do you see the problem here?

49:09.427 --> 49:12.060
It's not clear messaging.

49:17.645 --> 49:21.467
Shit hits the fan and somebody gets an infection, they lose their cookies, okay?

49:21.707 --> 49:25.609
You have to know how you're gonna deal with infections, whether your children are vaccinated or not.

49:25.910 --> 49:28.371
So don't think that just because you vaccinate, everything's gonna be fine.

49:28.391 --> 49:42.699
You need to understand nutrition, you need to understand the use of vitamin C, you need to understand what real primary care is, which is- And if you're, you don't, if what, holy shit, she said, if you don't think that if your kids are vaccinated, you don't have to worry.

49:43.119 --> 49:44.740
You still need to know about nutrition.

49:46.264 --> 49:47.365
She just said it right there.

49:47.486 --> 49:49.408
I'm sorry, but she just said it right there.

49:49.868 --> 49:54.753
I can play it for you again, but she said it right there.

49:54.793 --> 50:05.344
They lose their cookies and research as much as you can on both sides because, you know, the worst thing for me is to see somebody just listen to somebody off the cuff and not vaccinate.

50:05.925 --> 50:10.530
And then when the shit hits the fan and somebody gets an infection, they lose their cookies.

50:10.790 --> 50:14.674
You have to know how you're going to deal with infections, whether your children are vaccinated or not.

50:14.994 --> 50:17.437
So don't think that just because you vaccinate, everything's going to be fine.

50:17.477 --> 50:18.858
You need to understand nutrition.

50:18.898 --> 50:26.105
You need to understand the use of vitamin C. You need to understand what real primary care is, which is actually health care and not sick care, which is what?

50:27.406 --> 50:30.107
the well baby visits are all about, which you don't need.

50:30.487 --> 50:41.772
So I think the most valuable resource to a new parent, just like in the old days, it's the older parents who have already been through it and done it, maybe made their mistakes, maybe have five kids, two that are vaccinated and three that aren't.

50:41.812 --> 50:47.874
And it's not a coincidence that the ones that aren't vaccinated are always healthier than the ones that are vaccinated.

50:47.894 --> 50:48.454
Yeah.

50:48.815 --> 50:49.755
You know, I lived in Europe.

50:49.895 --> 50:51.937
Why did it take so long for her to say that?

50:51.997 --> 51:00.743
And what are the consequences of that observation as a doctor that somebody who's just raising their own kids can't make?

51:02.564 --> 51:10.230
What can you use your years of experience and knowledge to generalize across that observation to say to parents?

51:10.791 --> 51:11.611
What can she do?

51:11.631 --> 51:12.992
Nothing.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.221
She did nothing.

51:15.261 --> 51:16.763
She just said, talk to those parents.

51:16.823 --> 51:22.770
Cause I can't tell you what it means that those kids are always healthier.

51:22.791 --> 51:25.874
I don't know why they're always healthier.

51:25.914 --> 51:29.279
I just know that kids that aren't vaccinated are healthier.

51:34.434 --> 51:36.535
Let me be crystal fricking clear.

51:37.475 --> 51:39.716
I am explaining the mechanism.

51:40.236 --> 51:45.958
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

51:46.378 --> 51:47.578
It amounts to poisoning.

51:47.658 --> 51:50.399
If it's done early enough, it amounts to brain poisoning.

51:50.819 --> 51:54.620
And so no wonder a lot of kids, the younger they are vaccinated, i.e.

51:54.741 --> 52:02.223
intramuscularly injected with a random combination of pharmaceutical substances results in neurological damage.

52:02.543 --> 52:05.484
But it's not surprising that it's not the only thing that happens.

52:06.825 --> 52:10.346
And now the problem is, is that all of these shots have all different things in them.

52:10.386 --> 52:15.689
And so every one of them has different cocktail of potential, a different bouquet of potential outcomes.

52:16.109 --> 52:30.435
But that the bottom line is, is the reason why all these kids that are unvaccinated, as we call them in slave speak, are healthier is because they've never had a pharmaceutical product injected into them.

52:32.675 --> 52:38.516
Why in the... Why in the world can't she say that?

52:39.777 --> 52:42.898
She's been busy with that message since 2013!

52:44.098 --> 52:51.560
It is now 2018, five years later, and she still can't say it!

52:53.840 --> 52:56.621
Or you gotta go on her Facebook Live tomorrow, and then maybe she'll say it.

52:56.681 --> 52:57.021
I don't know.

53:01.135 --> 53:03.197
and the whole vaccine program is totally different.

53:03.217 --> 53:08.040
And that's where I learned kind of to see the veil.

53:08.080 --> 53:15.686
I mean, I learned also working for Merck, obviously with Vioxx and stuff like that, but where I saw real health, you know, and health being done, homeopathy is really big.

53:15.746 --> 53:16.446
I was in Holland.

53:16.486 --> 53:18.328
I had my son over there in a home.

53:18.388 --> 53:26.113
You know, I think it's great that she had this experience in Holland, but I can tell you firsthand that Holland is also a bit dark ages.

53:26.954 --> 53:32.379
These home births don't result in very high numbers.

53:32.439 --> 53:38.765
They have one of the worst birth death rates in the Western world because their births are at home.

53:39.866 --> 53:43.389
It's not to say that they have a terrible system or it doesn't work.

53:43.429 --> 53:47.713
I'm just saying that the outcomes are not as good as Norway.

53:49.161 --> 53:56.668
where most people or quite a few people give birth in the hospital, or more importantly, you see what I mean?

53:57.529 --> 54:00.391
So it's great that she found it there.

54:00.431 --> 54:13.483
The main reason why she found it in Holland is because the vaccine schedule is not mandated, the doctors are not trained to look at that as a primary thing to stick to in order to keep kids out of the grave.

54:14.281 --> 54:18.683
where they are kind of, pediatricians are drilled that way here for some reason in America.

54:18.703 --> 54:19.723
And I'm not a doctor.

54:20.083 --> 54:21.244
I've never trained with them.

54:21.304 --> 54:23.025
I don't know why it's that way.

54:24.465 --> 54:29.327
Susan Humphreys in this video is gonna make some joke about how they were all hypnotized or something like that.

54:29.907 --> 54:38.611
No, it's because when people seem to figure out the truth, it seems that they still can't really say it in a way that will snap people out of it.

54:41.718 --> 54:54.751
You know, if you went to a friend that you really loved and her husband was cheating on him and you knew it because you were a man and you hung out with him and you found out or you heard through a friend.

54:56.519 --> 54:57.759
And she was really your friend.

54:57.799 --> 54:58.520
You had nothing.

54:58.960 --> 55:02.401
He knew there was, you know, this is, uh, no kids in the marriage.

55:02.901 --> 55:03.762
She's unhappy.

55:04.382 --> 55:08.844
She thinks that, you know, she's not doing enough for him and she's your friend.

55:09.244 --> 55:13.605
And you're like, look, the guy's a shithead and yada, yada, yada.

55:14.586 --> 55:18.587
Would you tell her, you know, I don't know.

55:19.528 --> 55:20.528
Would you tell her the truth?

55:22.162 --> 55:27.204
Or would you tell her a bunch of stories and fables and, you know, it'll be okay.

55:27.304 --> 55:29.986
And maybe, you know, he should get a new boyfriend.

55:30.006 --> 55:30.786
No, I love him.

55:30.806 --> 55:34.368
You know, are you going to tell her the truth or not?

55:36.028 --> 55:40.450
And if that friend won't hear it, will you just say, Hey, he's cheating on you.

55:40.991 --> 55:41.931
He doesn't love you.

55:42.591 --> 55:45.733
Listen to me, wake up.

55:48.314 --> 56:03.233
And at some point in time, ladies and gentlemen, we need one doctor with a head and fortitude in their guts to actually say what I'm saying, what Brandy said before me.

56:04.261 --> 56:06.383
which is intramuscular injection is dumb.

56:06.823 --> 56:10.867
That's how you can understand why the vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

56:11.267 --> 56:15.411
It's not a criminal enterprise because they have no liability for the products they produce.

56:15.431 --> 56:18.854
That's a legal situation.

56:20.035 --> 56:24.540
It is criminal because there is no biological justification

56:25.342 --> 56:29.227
to inject things into the muscle of a healthy child.

56:29.907 --> 56:33.772
That's how we object to this schedule.

56:33.812 --> 56:36.976
We don't object to it because nothing should be mandated.

56:37.016 --> 56:37.997
We're a free people.

56:38.438 --> 56:40.280
We object to it because it's dumb.

56:40.760 --> 56:55.652
in the same way that if they mandated you to hit your kid with a baseball bat four times before it was six months old and show a video on social media so that they can confirm you did it, you wouldn't say you can't mandate baseball bats?

56:59.315 --> 57:01.816
You can't, you wouldn't say we need health freedom?

57:02.977 --> 57:06.020
You wouldn't say that you need safe baseball bats?

57:11.573 --> 57:12.374
birth and everything.

57:12.594 --> 57:16.757
And, um, he's completely vaccine free at six years old and he's super healthy.

57:17.478 --> 57:25.204
And it's like, it's night and day and what we're being told, you know, it's, I mean, it's seeing it from the inside.

57:25.284 --> 57:29.567
It's so much about profit and it really is at the sacrifice of our health.

57:30.247 --> 57:34.150
And, um, and so this is where Brandy has gotten it wrong.

57:34.871 --> 57:35.932
And I'm happy to say it.

57:36.092 --> 57:37.453
She thinks it's about profit.

57:37.513 --> 57:41.116
She thinks these pharmaceutical companies are doing it and it's much bigger than that.

57:42.256 --> 57:48.239
As I said in the beginning of the program, it's about the Human Genome Project, which is not an NIH project.

57:48.299 --> 57:55.844
It is a multinational cooperative project that includes Chinese partners.

57:58.245 --> 58:08.351
That coincidentally, some of those Chinese partners of the Human Genome Project are the companies that provided the PCR tests in America to define the pandemic.

58:14.744 --> 58:18.886
And so, yes, it is still, this was the progress, right?

58:18.926 --> 58:19.606
It's progress.

58:20.006 --> 58:21.187
Brandy made progress.

58:21.267 --> 58:23.427
We're making progress from where Brandy was.

58:24.328 --> 58:26.309
We're picking up the ball and running farther.

58:26.329 --> 58:33.071
These well visits, I mean, I think we should just call them vaccine visits, really, because it feels like that's what it is to me.

58:33.151 --> 58:35.492
Well, the thing is, they'll vaccinate them whether they're well or not anymore.

58:35.652 --> 58:35.772
Yeah.

58:35.872 --> 58:36.472
Oh my gosh, yeah.

58:36.492 --> 58:42.675
Some of the worst disasters that we know about that you hear of the stories that Polly gets on the bus are people that get vaccinated while their kids are sick.

58:43.035 --> 58:45.357
Polly gets these stories on the bus.

58:45.397 --> 58:46.057
So there you go.

58:46.137 --> 58:51.161
Now we're plugging another probably co-opted meddler that came over here with Andrew Wakefield.

58:51.662 --> 59:01.330
And the stories are just like Brian Hooker said in 2020 on that stream, that his kid was given like five shots when he had an ear infection.

59:01.350 --> 59:02.951
And he's pretty sure that's part of it.

59:03.391 --> 59:10.417
Kind of implying that if you give vaccines when your kid's not got an ear infection, then it's probably okay and you won't get autism.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.459
And of course, that's what she's saying here too.

59:14.819 --> 59:24.483
It's almost like they talked to each other and made a checkbox of the things that they should say to make sure that they stay on narrative and make sure that this person never realizes it.

59:25.143 --> 59:26.984
It's just like an illusion of consensus.

59:27.044 --> 59:29.105
It's funny how everybody agrees.

59:29.585 --> 59:31.826
Polly agrees that she finds that on the bus.

59:32.226 --> 59:33.647
She makes sure that she agrees.

59:34.027 --> 59:38.929
Even Brian Hooker agrees that it must've been the, you know, not when he said that in 2000, he didn't say that in 2013.

59:39.129 --> 59:40.349
He said that in 2020, that his kid.

59:42.523 --> 59:44.683
had an ear infection, he thinks that was important.

59:44.703 --> 59:48.684
The doctor says, well, you know, it's probably okay.

59:49.124 --> 59:51.205
Don't ever let a needle go into your child when they're sick.

59:51.305 --> 59:52.025
That's for sure.

59:52.365 --> 59:52.525
Yeah.

59:52.685 --> 59:57.206
Don't ever let a needle go into your child when they're sick.

01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:05.328
And the other appropriate sound for that would be... I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:10.289
Do not let a needle go into your child ever unless it's an IV.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:12.089
How about that?

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:15.466
This is a joke to me.

01:00:34.324 --> 01:00:40.047
So adults were getting kidney problems because of the flu vaccine and she took them seriously.

01:00:40.507 --> 01:00:47.370
That's interesting because this book is about polio and about smallpox and about measles.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:53.093
And so what's weird about that is that's at least three shots that all have different components.

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:56.114
Some of them have aluminum or mercury or whatever.

01:00:56.594 --> 01:00:57.975
And so rather than,

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:03.797
coming to the conclusion that maybe it doesn't matter what kind of bullshit you put in that needle.

01:01:04.237 --> 01:01:06.901
It's the needle itself that's the dumb idea.

01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:13.591
She's just writing more books and selling seminars on Facebook Live and not telling you the truth.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:27.836
So I looked into what's in vaccines and the potential for inflammation and the case reports that are out there all over the medical literature from decades of people having acute kidney failure after vaccination, after flu shots, which is what I saw.

01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:38.825
So I started my research there and it just moved into the childhood vaccines because you can't see what's happening to the adults and not wonder how a newborn baby or a pregnant mother or 69 vaccines

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:44.410
doses, I should say, of vaccines is going to do in a child.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:49.955
When I saw what one dose can do to an elderly person or even just a 40-year-old, you know what I've been hearing.

01:01:50.175 --> 01:01:56.621
So she still didn't come to the conclusion that intramuscular injection was dumb if one could hurt an adult?

01:01:57.962 --> 01:01:59.183
Can you not see this yet?

01:02:00.144 --> 01:02:01.245
Can you not see it?

01:02:02.326 --> 01:02:05.368
It's really a baseball bat to your head.

01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:11.066
And she is talking about, you know, don't hit them in the head when they're sick, that's for sure.

01:02:11.086 --> 01:02:21.728
Hearing a lot from nurses is that patients are having a lot of strokes in the hospital after they give the flu vaccine, the older patients.

01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:22.988
And some of them are coding.

01:02:23.108 --> 01:02:23.968
Oh, yeah.

01:02:24.168 --> 01:02:24.908
Oh, absolutely.

01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:27.409
It's just incredible what they're doing.

01:02:27.609 --> 01:02:29.269
And I know that the medical community is.

01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:33.130
So it wouldn't be an easy way to manage the population pyramid, would it?

01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:40.063
You know, you got all these old people and if they retire and they live until they're 80, they'll take some money, right?

01:02:40.503 --> 01:02:45.204
If they retire and they live until they're 70, they'll take a little less money.

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:50.966
So what if we just gave them flu shots for a few years and a certain percentage of them stroked out?

01:02:51.006 --> 01:02:56.907
Maybe we could just reduce the burden on the social security budget by just pushing the flu shot.

01:02:59.033 --> 01:03:00.974
Is she gonna, no?

01:03:01.494 --> 01:03:01.794
What?

01:03:02.435 --> 01:03:03.195
What's happening?

01:03:04.075 --> 01:03:05.216
Where is the summary?

01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:09.538
Where's the understanding here after five years and a fricking book?

01:03:11.318 --> 01:03:12.019
Two books.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.880
She mentioned another book, Rising From the Dead.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.060
That's her second book.

01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:19.842
Where's the, oh my gosh, if you can't see it.

01:03:19.902 --> 01:03:20.622
Very brainwashed.

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.543
I mean, I was as well, working for Merck.

01:03:23.744 --> 01:03:28.266
But why do you think more doctors and nurses don't wake up when it's right in front of their face?

01:03:30.359 --> 01:03:32.000
You know, everybody asks me that question.

01:03:32.021 --> 01:03:44.451
I think I must have been absent in medical school the day that they did that, you know, that hypnosis technique on everybody that made them believe that everything they did was the best that could be offered and that the CDC and the World Health Organization can do no wrong.

01:03:44.712 --> 01:03:49.316
The CDC and the World Health Organization are also bad guys in her story.

01:03:50.953 --> 01:04:01.478
It has nothing to do with the idea that doctors are taught that intramuscular injection is a very good way to give medicine.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:02.859
And it's not.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:09.362
It's just an assumption that these people have been taught is a good one.

01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:17.266
And it is an accepted illusion of consensus across Western medicine that maybe was put in place by a few shitheads.

01:04:17.406 --> 01:04:19.207
I don't know, but it's everywhere now.

01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.301
Why wouldn't she just say that?

01:04:22.341 --> 01:04:23.263
It's so simple.

01:04:23.603 --> 01:04:32.554
You don't need, you don't need to write a 477 page book to say the stuff that's the truth.

01:04:32.654 --> 01:04:34.436
That's the, that's the problem, right?

01:04:34.476 --> 01:04:38.441
It's just, that's the problem.

01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:45.902
So I can't understand that I can't explain it because it's not that the doctors are evil.

01:04:45.962 --> 01:04:52.184
It's not that they're trying to do harm to people, but they're incredibly impermeable to new information.

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:56.065
It's not new information if you don't explain it right.

01:04:56.705 --> 01:05:06.648
It's not new information if you tell them a bunch of things that are incoherent and some of them are incongruent and never come to any logical conclusion based on what they say.

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:10.551
And so of course nobody's gonna listen to this lady.

01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:15.372
She never brings it to a point where someone can say, hmm, what's he saying again?

01:05:15.392 --> 01:05:19.013
I wanna really understand the challenge that she's saying.

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:19.773
What is she saying?

01:05:19.793 --> 01:05:20.273
We don't know.

01:05:20.953 --> 01:05:21.713
What is the truth?

01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:23.354
She hasn't said it yet.

01:05:24.314 --> 01:05:26.595
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:05:27.615 --> 01:05:28.355
Now argue.

01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:35.957
Give me five examples of where intramuscular injection's a great idea and it works perfect.

01:05:37.256 --> 01:05:38.637
exactly as intended.

01:05:39.257 --> 01:05:57.345
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe with a pure substance, you know, like something diluted in saline, like aspirin or a metabolic steroid in saline, if it's pure and clean and whatever.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:03.728
Maybe putting that intramuscularly is not something that's going to go absolutely haywire because

01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:12.522
There are saline, there's liquid, and there's salt, and there's hormones in your blood or something like that.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.464
But we're not talking about that.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:22.673
We're talking about a combination of substances, preservatives, and chemicals, and biologics, which have no business being there.

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:35.238
and doing it over and over and over again with the intention of attracting the immune system, using a word called adjuvant, which is just another name for toxin.

01:06:35.278 --> 01:06:38.599
And the more toxic they are, the better the adjuvant is.

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:47.622
And so this whole concept is again, they want you to believe that, oh, maybe it's the adjuvant so that they can substitute the adjuvants for something else, but it's not.

01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:52.083
It's intramuscular injection and transfection or transformation

01:06:54.195 --> 01:06:54.955
It's even worse.

01:06:58.816 --> 01:07:01.237
Especially if it goes against what they've already been told.

01:07:02.158 --> 01:07:09.480
But there were a few doctors who stopped taking their own flu shots and who stopped giving their own kids excessive amounts of vaccines.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.620
Excessive amounts of vaccines?

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.562
What about the doctors in Chicago, the doctor in Chicago who is giving nobody vaccines?

01:07:18.263 --> 01:07:22.704
What about the doctors in Chicago that give nobody vaccines?

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:32.743
There's a Jewish doctor in Chicago in the in the 90s that was giving no vaccines and he was famous and none of these people will say his name.

01:07:34.206 --> 01:07:35.829
That's why you don't know his name right now.

01:07:40.796 --> 01:07:50.643
But they still, all in all, believed in vaccination and refused to stand next to me, you know, when I was writing my manifesto about, you know, the problem with vaccination to renal patients.

01:07:51.044 --> 01:07:55.547
There was nobody that was willing to stand there and say, I agree with her, even though they didn't quite.

01:07:56.247 --> 01:07:57.348
What, agree with what?

01:07:57.889 --> 01:07:59.390
That it was causing that problem?

01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:06.995
Or that intramuscular injection without anything would be dumb, that augmenting the immune system that way is ridiculous.

01:08:07.816 --> 01:08:09.097
Nope, we're not getting there.

01:08:09.177 --> 01:08:09.978
And this is an MD.

01:08:11.673 --> 01:08:14.284
supposedly an expert on human physiology.

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:19.210
Behind closed doors, there was some support, but out in the open, nothing.

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:22.872
Yeah, and that's one of the questions I get all the time as well.

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.353
Why don't more people in pharma speak out?

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.314
They must see it as well.

01:08:26.674 --> 01:08:28.815
Why don't more people in the medical communities?

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:42.762
And what I experienced was that pharmaceutical reps and pharma in general has so much power over the entire medical system, over doctors, over hospitals, over the health insurance companies even, and it's just,

01:08:43.762 --> 01:08:44.823
It's just, it's crazy.

01:08:44.864 --> 01:08:53.393
You know, most people who haven't seen it from the inside, like we have, I feel like it's harder for them to grasp, even though it's a billion dollar, multi-billion dollar industry.

01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:57.657
It's just seeing it up close was, yeah, disturbing.

01:08:57.777 --> 01:09:02.302
Let's just think about one thing in particular somebody just brought up.

01:09:03.083 --> 01:09:05.445
What happens when you inject something into a vein?

01:09:05.485 --> 01:09:06.006
Where does it go?

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.241
Have you ever thought about that?

01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:11.223
Do you know enough about human physiology?

01:09:11.263 --> 01:09:26.155
I wonder if even if I know enough about human physiology, as far as I understand it, um, that might mean that the blood would first go back to the heart, um, and then go through the lungs.

01:09:28.216 --> 01:09:29.778
Um, it could go through the liver.

01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:37.584
Um, it could go right up to the brain and blood brain barrier, but then, you know, wherever it goes, um,

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:42.227
Intramuscular injection is not like that.

01:09:43.188 --> 01:09:46.108
Intramuscular injection could go in a number of different places.

01:09:46.168 --> 01:09:47.529
It could find itself in the lymph.

01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:55.091
It could find itself in the interstitial space where the lymph is, where the extracellular fluid is and flowing.

01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:56.831
It could find itself in the blood.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.313
And it can find itself in between muscle cells and in muscle cells.

01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:03.413
And I don't know what that means.

01:10:04.566 --> 01:10:08.168
It could find itself in the adipose tissue that also is part of the muscle.

01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:13.971
It could find itself in the connective tissue or in between the connective tissue, the fascia.

01:10:15.072 --> 01:10:20.195
It could be in any number of places and then slowly but surely leak out over weeks and weeks and weeks.

01:10:22.716 --> 01:10:31.261
Perhaps even longer, but certainly over more than hours and possibly more than days.

01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:40.820
And so, what you're dealing with here is a propensity not to know what's happening.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.086
In fact, if you inject something in the vein, you usually have to inject it in a very controlled way.

01:10:46.627 --> 01:10:51.132
Somebody who's doing heroin will pass out if they inject into the vein all at once and it's too much.

01:10:51.192 --> 01:10:51.873
They pass out.

01:10:51.913 --> 01:10:52.133
They go

01:10:54.831 --> 01:10:59.534
unconscious because the rise in concentration of the drug is so high.

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:01.215
I mean, so quick.

01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:18.887
It's the same reason why people who are injecting steroids will do it in big muscles and occasionally it's not comfortable because it goes in to a vein or an artery and it gets into their system very quickly and they can feel that change and it's not nice.

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:37.638
So it's interesting to think about the idea that we are injecting children at an age when they are unable to report the symptoms.

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:48.267
And then we're injecting them in a place that will, by necessity, by definition, will temporarily spread out the potential consequences over time.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:56.963
in a person that's already unable to associate symptoms with what just happened, even if it were only a few hours.

01:12:01.487 --> 01:12:06.111
And so there's a lot of layers here with regard to intramuscular injection that's nasty.

01:12:06.632 --> 01:12:11.096
One of the nastiest one of them is that the effects of the toxin

01:12:12.034 --> 01:12:19.763
will be temporarily spread out and crescendo slowly through time relative to an intravenous or arterial injection.

01:12:22.225 --> 01:12:28.853
And, you know, a cutaneous injection might not even reach deep circulation.

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.106
So, it's interesting.

01:12:32.146 --> 01:12:49.216
And certainly, if you drink something, it's got to go, make it through your gut, make it through your stomach, make it into the absorption area of the small intestine, and then pass through the mucus, pass into the lymph, and then actually move.

01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:52.297
It can only go one place then.

01:12:52.838 --> 01:12:58.241
Either it goes directly through your immune system and meets a wall of immune cells,

01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:01.872
Or it goes through your liver first.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:08.314
And the likelihood of, I mean, the liver is a wonderful toxic processor.

01:13:10.455 --> 01:13:11.556
Gets rid of a lot of stuff.

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.958
So intramuscular injection is spectacularly dumb.

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:32.578
And the biology of intramuscular injection is spectacularly in the favor of people who would like you to not understand that simply because again, it is the dumbest place to put medicine if the idea is to understand what that medicine does.

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:38.859
If you had an intention and you knew what it was doing, you would put it in a place other than the muscle.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.640
That's just the reality of it.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.081
And I think Susan Humphreys must know this by now.

01:13:47.769 --> 01:14:10.492
and I really honor you because you did speak out you know and like you said there are doctors behind the scenes that that thank you and that agree with you but they won't come forward and I'm hoping that you will your inspiration will inspire them to to speak out and I thank you because it takes you know it takes a lot of courage and

01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:15.276
Yeah, and boldness and ethics to come forward.

01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:19.600
I have no, actually, illusion or hope that doctors are going to start waking up.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.201
I really don't.

01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:24.084
I saw the potential for that and I just had to walk away from it.

01:14:24.104 --> 01:14:32.011
But I think parents waking up, because there are way more parents than there are doctors, and I have seen some parents turn around the minds of some doctors.

01:14:32.671 --> 01:14:38.555
So I think parents, that's my mission is to get parents to see, because they're the ones at the interface between their child and that needle.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:41.177
And they're the ones that are responsible when things go bad.

01:14:41.597 --> 01:14:52.045
So they're the ones that really I am interested in getting them to explore on their own, everything the CDC has to say, everything you have to say, everything I have to say, and then coming to their own determination.

01:14:52.225 --> 01:15:02.152
So again, what I think I see here is a distinct effort not to rank order priority of messaging.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.531
There is no priority of messaging.

01:15:05.571 --> 01:15:07.532
You should read what the CDC puts out.

01:15:08.153 --> 01:15:09.754
You should read what the WHO puts out.

01:15:10.195 --> 01:15:11.796
You should read what Brandy puts out.

01:15:11.856 --> 01:15:12.997
You should read my books.

01:15:13.157 --> 01:15:18.702
And then you should make up your own mind because there is no right or wrong answer.

01:15:18.782 --> 01:15:23.005
It's just what you feel after you've read all sides.

01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:27.870
Hopefully you'll come to the conclusion that I did, which is that, you know,

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:35.728
hitting your kid in the head later and less times and with a safe baseball bat is better than I don't know what.

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:39.130
I think you can see it.

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.171
I hope you can see it.

01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:41.331
This is a joke to me.

01:15:41.992 --> 01:15:52.757
And I'm annoyed because we are in 2025, seven years later, and there are hundreds of thousands of people on the internet celebrating this lady being on Rogan.

01:15:53.991 --> 01:15:58.853
And I guarantee you dollars to donuts, that's two and a half hours of bullshit.

01:16:01.134 --> 01:16:04.416
Because you can tell the truth about sanitation.

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:06.817
You can tell the truth about clean water.

01:16:07.197 --> 01:16:09.058
You can tell the truth about washing hands.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.779
You can tell the truth about not getting poop in your mouth.

01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:14.420
You can tell the truth about chlorinated water.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.082
You can tell the truth about pesticides and DDT.

01:16:19.767 --> 01:16:22.750
and you still won't save a single person.

01:16:22.851 --> 01:16:25.373
You won't change the mind of a single doctor.

01:16:25.413 --> 01:16:30.519
She even says her goal as a doctor is not to change the mind of any doctors.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.487
She wants to talk to parents who will easily dismiss her as anti-vax, but that's okay.

01:16:38.737 --> 01:16:41.178
The hard one would be to try and convince doctors.

01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:44.059
That's what GigaOM Biological is trying to do.

01:16:44.119 --> 01:16:51.242
That's why we use language like intramuscular injection is dumb, transfection was always a crime, and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:16:51.682 --> 01:16:58.885
Because we're challenging people that think that they have the requisite technical knowledge to bring anything useful to this table.

01:16:59.765 --> 01:17:01.006
I just don't think they do.

01:17:01.906 --> 01:17:05.872
Otherwise they would address those terms and those questions by now.

01:17:06.352 --> 01:17:15.465
This woman would have gotten to intramuscular injection is dumb by now, but she hasn't and that can only be because she's on script.

01:17:17.659 --> 01:17:18.499
Doctors, no.

01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:22.080
I think we just need, you know, it's really- I still have my fingers crossed.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.461
But why, you know what, you really, for the majority of doctor visits, really, they're not necessary.

01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:34.243
I think it's just better that we abandon them and only use them when they're truly needed, when there's an organ failure, a broken bone.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.063
Crisis care.

01:17:35.143 --> 01:17:35.623
Exactly.

01:17:35.963 --> 01:17:44.965
Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things I talk about is, you know, the medical system is great at crisis care, but in terms of prevention, in terms of health, I mean, we have a sick care system.

01:17:45.205 --> 01:17:52.795
So we're into this video quite far, and now her message is that we should ditch our allopathic MD.

01:17:53.872 --> 01:18:00.817
for a chiropractor and only go to an MD when like, you know, it's systemic failure or they need an operation.

01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:02.579
We don't have a healthcare system.

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:02.739
Yeah.

01:18:02.759 --> 01:18:03.900
I mean, it's not just vaccines.

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.380
That's the problem.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.684
I think we need, I think we need a safety commission on medical doctors in general, not just on vaccination.

01:18:09.964 --> 01:18:10.745
Yeah, I agree.

01:18:10.905 --> 01:18:19.652
And you know, but vaccination, one of the things that we don't have, I've noticed, we don't have a safety commission or any, we don't have any, what, what the hell is she talking about here?

01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:26.953
I mean, that's really the foundation for the house of cards, you know, because it creates lifelong customers in some cases.

01:18:27.173 --> 01:18:32.276
And usually there will be some issue, the more and more and more toxins and vaccines that you get.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:41.822
And that creates a base, a customer base for all of these medications, for depression, for anxiety, for seizures, for type one diabetes, you know, all of these things.

01:18:42.142 --> 01:18:43.963
I mean, and cancer of course, eventually.

01:18:44.524 --> 01:18:45.905
Why aren't you nodding?

01:18:46.225 --> 01:18:47.105
Why aren't you nodding?

01:18:47.266 --> 01:18:49.287
It does, but you know, here we go.

01:18:49.887 --> 01:19:00.052
I really, from what I observe, without those doctors giving antibiotics for every sniffle, every sneeze, every skin infection, those vaccines wouldn't do half the amount of harm that they do.

01:19:00.192 --> 01:19:06.296
It's a culmination of all the abuses that the medical system has to offer from conception to birth.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:19.919
That is, to me, very remarkable, because I don't think there's any reason to compare the possible effects of antibiotics with the possible effects of intramuscular injection of toxins.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:31.682
And yet here she is saying, yeah, but you know, I think vaccines are just as culpable as antibiotics, even though antibiotics should be, should be

01:19:34.048 --> 01:19:40.013
should be part of this story, which is sanitation, clean water, and yes, antibiotics.

01:19:40.073 --> 01:19:53.004
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've never had an acute skin infection from having a puncture wound, if you've never had a cellulitis infection from eczema,

01:19:53.945 --> 01:20:07.071
If you've never had a bite wound and gone into sepsis and had IV antibiotics cure you, then you need to stop talking about what antibiotics do and don't do.

01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:10.692
Is it possible that oral antibiotics are bad?

01:20:10.752 --> 01:20:11.573
Yeah, it's possible.

01:20:12.513 --> 01:20:18.156
Is it possible that the overuse of certain oral antibiotics could be terrible for your gut microbiome?

01:20:18.176 --> 01:20:18.996
Yeah, of course it is.

01:20:19.036 --> 01:20:20.937
And that could drive people nuts.

01:20:21.297 --> 01:20:22.418
Kids could get all kinds.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:23.258
Yes, of course.

01:20:26.536 --> 01:20:30.321
But the foundation of this is not antibiotics.

01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:36.188
There's not a single kid that has autism because of antibiotics.

01:20:36.388 --> 01:20:38.812
I would bet dollars to donuts on it.

01:20:39.764 --> 01:20:46.209
Unless you can show me some example of somebody that was on antibiotics for weeks and weeks and weeks and all different kinds of antibiotics.

01:20:46.269 --> 01:20:48.271
And so sure, I get it.

01:20:48.351 --> 01:20:49.472
Then that's an example.

01:20:50.213 --> 01:21:00.101
But the use of antibiotics when you need them is a foundation of Western medicine and a foundation of how we've gotten this far.

01:21:01.445 --> 01:21:06.407
Without antibiotics, an awful lot of infections would lead to death.

01:21:06.587 --> 01:21:16.710
A lot of stab wounds, a lot of gunshot wounds, a lot of ladder accidents, a lot of broken compound fractures would have led to death.

01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:21.492
Now, is there another way to treat sepsis?

01:21:21.552 --> 01:21:23.112
Maybe with high dose vitamin C?

01:21:23.192 --> 01:21:24.513
Sure, maybe that's possible.

01:21:27.314 --> 01:21:29.835
But to say that antibiotics are more bad than good

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:35.312
when used when needed is absurd.

01:21:36.994 --> 01:21:51.703
And I think I can teach a new biology 101 that will put antibiotics right where they belong, put the microbiome right where it belongs, put our biology right in the frame that it belongs, and all of these myths will disappear.

01:21:52.484 --> 01:22:01.370
All of these mythologies and these objections and these, you know, limited spectrums of debate will just vanish because they'll seem dumb.

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:07.367
because the elephant in the room will finally be visible.

01:22:07.648 --> 01:22:12.988
And it's visible in this video because these people can't seem to say it.

01:22:13.009 --> 01:22:17.129
The vaccines are just part of it.

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:19.770
I know, it's true.

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.230
Vaccines are just part of it.

01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.550
Yeah, I know it's true.

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:28.951
You've got to be able to rank order priority here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:31.852
And if kids are eating hamburgers,

01:22:33.109 --> 01:22:45.437
and some doctors are prescribing too much antibiotics, and a lot of pediatricians are hitting kids in the heads with baseball bats repeatedly before they're six months old, one of those three is the most important.

01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:49.660
Gosh darn it, one of the three is the most important, and you need to see it.

01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:52.002
We need to see it.

01:22:53.262 --> 01:22:57.125
And if you can see it, then you'll understand why this person had a book in 2013,

01:22:59.139 --> 01:23:14.614
is in a Facebook video with Brandy Vaughn in 2018, has never mentioned Brandy Vaughn to you or anybody else, was in the movie Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2, and is on Joe Rogan in 2025, and still can't tell you the truth!

01:23:17.256 --> 01:23:18.758
Uh, all right, so...

01:23:20.146 --> 01:23:21.006
How can we stop it?

01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:21.707
What can we do?

01:23:21.727 --> 01:23:23.027
You talked about the parents.

01:23:23.127 --> 01:23:24.468
I started learntherisk.org.

01:23:24.548 --> 01:23:25.268
Everyone go there.

01:23:25.688 --> 01:23:33.692
I know most of you who follow me know all about it, but we did launch a billboard near Cal Jam in honor of Cal Jam and everyone here just two blocks away.

01:23:34.072 --> 01:23:35.353
Please help, please volunteer.

01:23:35.393 --> 01:23:38.474
We're starting chapters in all different states and areas.

01:23:39.294 --> 01:23:41.315
We have flyers, free flyers to distribute.

01:23:41.995 --> 01:23:42.936
What else can we do?

01:23:43.516 --> 01:23:44.436
Dr. Humphreys, you know.

01:23:44.637 --> 01:23:47.718
This is how a person looks when they know that somebody's duped.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:59.359
Watch the video from the beginning again, and this is how a lot of people, I think, probably looked at me for the two or three years that I was chasing them around like a puppy dog, just like she.

01:23:59.799 --> 01:24:01.140
This is one of my heroes.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.280
I was shaking their hand.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.360
Boy, you're one of my, boy, you're one of my heroes.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.441
I can't believe how brave you are.

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:09.281
Boy, can I take a selfie with you, Ryan Cole?

01:24:09.321 --> 01:24:11.242
Can I take a selfie with you, Pierre Corey?

01:24:11.262 --> 01:24:13.822
Can I take a selfie with you, Vera Sharov?

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:16.283
Can I take a selfie with you, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:24:16.303 --> 01:24:17.683
Can I take a selfie with you,

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.528
Jay Bhattacharya, you guys are so awesome.

01:24:20.568 --> 01:24:25.998
I can't believe how much you put on the line to get the truth out, whatever the truth is.

01:24:29.323 --> 01:24:31.364
I really don't know because I'm not a politician.

01:24:31.424 --> 01:24:33.345
I don't know how to move masses of people.

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:35.166
I know how to dig up information.

01:24:35.606 --> 01:24:42.309
I know how to describe what the science that exists and how it doesn't make sense in the way that it's, you know, being abused.

01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:44.250
And that's really my mission.

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:51.393
As far as the bigger picture, you know, I leave that to the attorneys and the parents and the people that are much better at organizing large groups of people.

01:24:53.417 --> 01:25:01.481
All right, so Dr. Humphreys says that we need to... Do I know any biology that backs up what statements that intramuscular injection is dumb?

01:25:03.382 --> 01:25:11.086
Every bit of biology that's in any biology book will tell you that if you learn it correctly.

01:25:12.329 --> 01:25:13.310
I think it's kind of funny.

01:25:13.331 --> 01:25:14.572
There's a new guy in the chat.

01:25:15.072 --> 01:25:16.694
It's good to see Fatty Liver King.

01:25:17.555 --> 01:25:18.496
I'm glad you're here.

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:24.622
It's good to see people, you know, trying to understand what's going on.

01:25:25.183 --> 01:25:33.331
I'm afraid that if intramuscular injection seems like a given to you, then you got a lot of work to do, man.

01:25:33.711 --> 01:25:34.993
There's a long way to go.

01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:41.728
for you to understand how bad things are if you're asking that question in this forum.

01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:44.012
But I'm really happy that you're here.

01:25:44.052 --> 01:25:46.455
I'm really happy that you have an open enough mind to be here.

01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:47.096
So good to see you.

01:25:47.336 --> 01:25:49.980
To motivate and get out there.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.102
And it's the parents.

01:25:51.442 --> 01:25:53.963
It's the parents who are going to change the conversation.

01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:59.006
I agree, because legislatively, in the courts, we're outmanned right now.

01:25:59.506 --> 01:26:00.987
It's the parents that have to rise up.

01:26:01.147 --> 01:26:06.110
And in California, we had 1,000 people go to the Capitol, and it didn't make a difference at all.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:17.436
The reason why I don't think the parents can rise up is because parents who do not have what they see as a vaccine-injured kid have no reason to stand up.

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:23.055
and the people that have a vaccine injured kid have already stood up.

01:26:24.857 --> 01:26:29.382
And so in reality, what we need are people with the requisite knowledge

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:35.451
that understand the biology to stand up, to learn it and understand it and then speak out.

01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:38.512
That's why we need doctors to stand up.

01:26:38.572 --> 01:26:49.974
That's why I think we need biologists to stand up to say that, wait a minute, if PCR was used like Dr. Cooey says it was used, then PCR is bullshit as a diagnostic.

01:26:50.435 --> 01:26:53.935
Because that's not how I use it to make my nature papers.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:56.256
And that's what I assumed that they would do.

01:26:58.097 --> 01:26:59.718
The same thing with transfection.

01:26:59.778 --> 01:27:06.684
We need people with a professional background to realize they've been fooled.

01:27:07.665 --> 01:27:17.172
We need doctors with a professional experience of 20 years to realize the changes that have occurred during their career and wake up.

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:23.537
Because old doctors are old enough to still remember that this is a change that occurred in the 80s, in the 90s.

01:27:27.489 --> 01:27:39.478
That's why it's important to appeal to doctors, to her peers, instead of appealing to people that are below her in their intellectual ability to grasp the trap they're in.

01:27:45.048 --> 01:27:48.271
So, apparently, until we're 100,000, they're not going to listen.

01:27:48.851 --> 01:27:52.034
So, please help us get the grassroots going.

01:27:52.054 --> 01:27:53.936
Educate yourselves.

01:27:54.296 --> 01:27:58.699
You know, that's really the best thing, I think, because you're not going to convince anybody else.

01:27:58.759 --> 01:28:08.767
I mean, your healthy children are good evidence, but you're not going to have necessarily assurance of healthy children if you don't educate yourselves about health and disease, not just about the ingredients of vaccines.

01:28:08.808 --> 01:28:09.428
That's not enough.

01:28:09.468 --> 01:28:12.130
You have to understand how to maintain a healthy immune system.

01:28:13.902 --> 01:28:17.564
Knowing the ingredients of the vaccines is not enough.

01:28:17.884 --> 01:28:21.606
You have to know how to maintain a healthy immune system.

01:28:21.626 --> 01:28:27.770
Spread the word the best that you can in the most grounded, calm, you know, educated way that you can.

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:28.510
And it's possible.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:29.330
Any parent can do it.

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:37.575
I've seen people, parents without even a high school education, become better able to debate the issues with health and disease and vaccination than a doctor.

01:28:37.935 --> 01:28:39.359
Yep, I've seen it too.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:45.834
Alright, so on that note, healthiness, what supplements should everybody be on every day?

01:28:46.972 --> 01:28:59.377
food, good food, whole food, organic if you can, grow your own as much as you can, have backyard chickens, have your own garden, do your sprouts in the spring, and there's nothing like good, holistic nutrition.

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:05.259
Supplements, I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm ever gonna sign on to the You Need Masses of Supplements campaign.

01:29:05.299 --> 01:29:08.421
You can't eat a garbage diet and think you're gonna save yourself with supplements.

01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:16.624
Now, even if you're in a healthy state, I don't even believe you need supplement with vitamin C, and I'm a total vitamin C freak, but I think that if you're eating enough

01:29:16.904 --> 01:29:25.490
you know, red peppers and cilantro and parsley and those kind of things that are really rich in whole vitamin C, and you're not sick, you don't have any chronic diseases, you don't need any of that.

01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.130
Yep.

01:29:26.150 --> 01:29:26.851
All right.

01:29:27.291 --> 01:29:31.434
No exercise in this doctor's recommendation at all.

01:29:32.651 --> 01:29:38.437
I would say that exercising every day now that I'm doing it is probably the most important thing in my regiment.

01:29:40.199 --> 01:29:42.020
It's what makes my lymph move.

01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:44.583
It's what makes my circulation happen.

01:29:44.683 --> 01:29:48.287
It's what keeps me from being injured.

01:29:49.047 --> 01:29:53.412
I just, for me, it is most important to move.

01:29:54.605 --> 01:30:00.191
I married a dancer not knowing that one of the reasons why I married her is because of how she moves.

01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:03.195
It's because of her cerebellum, if you will.

01:30:04.096 --> 01:30:05.317
And my kids have it too.

01:30:05.357 --> 01:30:09.021
My kids are all very graceful thanks to her and her cerebellum.

01:30:10.683 --> 01:30:15.688
I'm sorry, I think I just got to add that exercise is very important.

01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:18.451
Exercise in children is ridiculously important.

01:30:18.471 --> 01:30:25.098
You essentially are setting the precedence for a pattern integrity that will go on in time forever.

01:30:25.558 --> 01:30:32.645
A child who doesn't exercise is setting a precedence of a pattern where exercise isn't required.

01:30:33.286 --> 01:30:43.571
And so, the joints, the ligaments, the bones, and the muscles will not have developed in the context of exercise and movement.

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.071
And this is interesting.

01:30:45.111 --> 01:30:46.212
There's a term for this.

01:30:46.272 --> 01:30:47.713
This is called euphenics.

01:30:48.493 --> 01:30:57.417
Euphenics is a term that Joshua Lederberg came up with that describes the optimum and optimization of development.

01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:26.641
And one of his arguments was that we can't really understand eugenics, you know, optimizing the genome, until we first understand what the optimal developmental conditions and optimal developmental trajectory of a human is, so that we first understand our full genetic potential as it is naturally occurring, before we ever dream of interpreting it, and then hoping to augment it.

01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:36.515
Do you see how much nonsense is out there and how easy it is to say things?

01:31:36.555 --> 01:31:37.276
Right, I agree.

01:31:37.296 --> 01:31:39.758
So thank you so much for joining us.

01:31:39.798 --> 01:31:41.159
I can't wait until your talk tomorrow.

01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:45.122
Everybody go to dissolvingillusions.com.

01:31:45.923 --> 01:31:51.207
And you can see the book also on my website and see talks from Suzanne at learntherisk.org.

01:31:51.227 --> 01:31:52.929
Who's she looking at?

01:31:52.949 --> 01:31:58.934
And also Rising from the Dead is an amazing book that everyone should go get on Amazon and check it out.

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:00.455
And thank you.

01:32:00.996 --> 01:32:01.757
Thank you for joining us.

01:32:02.378 --> 01:32:03.459
All right.

01:32:03.539 --> 01:32:09.926
If I would have been interviewed by Brandi, I would have had my arms around her and my head right next to hers at the end of the video.

01:32:10.807 --> 01:32:12.549
And this looks terrifying to me.

01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:13.751
I think this is evidence.

01:32:15.112 --> 01:32:16.474
I think it's a giant admission.

01:32:17.475 --> 01:32:18.697
I'm not very happy about it.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.546
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:23.587 --> 01:32:25.347
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:32:25.887 --> 01:32:35.590
That's the reason why none of these people like Susan Humphreys, who's had two books and 10 years to tell you, will never tell you that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:32:35.630 --> 01:32:37.690
She'll never tell you that Brandy's got a point, you know.

01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:50.254
Injection of a pharmaceutical's a lot different than ingestion, and we sure spend a lot of money and do a lot of trials and require a lot of proof for things that we're gonna ingest.

01:32:50.894 --> 01:32:58.776
And we require none of that for stuff that we're going to inject, even though it doesn't even make biological sense to augment the immune system from behind it.

01:33:01.796 --> 01:33:02.056
Whoops.

01:33:05.217 --> 01:33:05.517
Uh-oh.

01:33:05.797 --> 01:33:08.478
We may have a small crashing problem here.

01:33:08.498 --> 01:33:09.338
Hold on one second.

01:33:09.358 --> 01:33:12.699
I think we're having a crash here.

01:33:12.759 --> 01:33:13.799
Do you guys see me still?

01:33:13.939 --> 01:33:14.879
Can you still see me?

01:33:14.899 --> 01:33:17.600
Because maybe it's just PowerPoint doing this.

01:33:22.043 --> 01:33:22.924
Can you still see me?

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:23.204
Yes.

01:33:23.304 --> 01:33:24.344
Juanta says yes.

01:33:24.464 --> 01:33:27.326
Okay, so I'm going to see if I can fix this problem here.

01:33:27.366 --> 01:33:28.927
What's going on with PowerPoint?

01:33:29.327 --> 01:33:29.687
Wow.

01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:33.650
I don't know what's up.

01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:36.271
I might just kill it right here.

01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:39.413
I don't know why I can't advance slides anymore or

01:33:40.113 --> 01:33:41.154
resume the show.

01:33:41.174 --> 01:33:44.999
Let me see if I get some.

01:33:45.079 --> 01:33:47.041
Yes, you can still see me on Twitch.

01:33:47.101 --> 01:33:49.443
Okay, so I can probably wrap it up here.

01:33:50.164 --> 01:33:52.647
We'll just slide over to the other side here.

01:33:52.667 --> 01:33:54.929
I don't know what happened sometimes every once in a while.

01:33:54.969 --> 01:33:55.530
Whoops, I guess.

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:59.612
you get a little problem here with PowerPoint too much.

01:34:00.733 --> 01:34:09.177
Anyway, it's been 2013 since Brian Hooker was able to say that, you know, maybe the whole idea of vaccination is kind of crazy.

01:34:10.518 --> 01:34:13.219
And we're in 2025, he's not saying it anymore.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.721
Susan Humphreys has actually had a book

01:34:16.662 --> 01:34:27.777
that came out in 2013 where she says that polio is kind of a scam and that it was a lot of water and sanitation and maybe it was DDT and measles is also part of that scam.

01:34:28.798 --> 01:34:30.020
But then later now we hear in 2018,

01:34:31.502 --> 01:34:35.783
that she told Brandy that it was all about the flu shot in adults that really woke her up.

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:55.528
And yet, despite all of these bad outcomes from all of these different intramuscular injections, an MD like her with multiple books and many, many years on this project or problem has not been able to succinctly come to the conclusion that intramuscular injection in general of toxins might be dumb.

01:34:57.188 --> 01:34:59.070
That's unfortunate, but that's where we are.

01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:06.437
I will play us out like this and see if I go over here.

01:35:07.138 --> 01:35:08.179
Maybe I can do this.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.601
Does this work still?

01:35:09.701 --> 01:35:10.481
Oh, look at that.

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.287
I can't really see that though.

01:35:16.327 --> 01:35:18.730
I guess I have to switch over like this.

01:35:24.967 --> 01:35:25.947
Oh, that's me too tiny.

01:35:26.208 --> 01:35:26.848
I'm too tiny.

01:35:27.389 --> 01:35:28.730
I need to be a little bit bigger.

01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:30.531
There we go.

01:35:31.953 --> 01:35:33.154
Good to see everybody here.

01:35:33.174 --> 01:35:41.221
I can put the chat up and then check out Peertube's chat too.

01:35:41.281 --> 01:35:42.682
I guess there's nobody on Peertube.

01:35:43.202 --> 01:35:47.946
If you want to very briefly go to Peertube and type something into the chat, you don't have to log in.

01:35:48.587 --> 01:35:50.609
Just choose a name and start typing.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.001
I hope this was a decent show.

01:35:54.061 --> 01:35:56.423
Next week, we're going to start with Biology 101.

01:35:56.923 --> 01:35:57.523
Stay tuned.

01:35:58.024 --> 01:36:05.208
We will send an email update to all the people on the website, all the people on the mailing list over the weekend.

01:36:06.009 --> 01:36:11.773
It's Friday tomorrow, though, so I'll still be online tomorrow, most likely with a show around the same time.

01:36:11.793 --> 01:36:14.514
I don't know, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, something like that.

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:15.775
Good to see everybody.

01:36:15.795 --> 01:36:17.336
Thank you very much for being here.

01:36:18.097 --> 01:36:19.478
I will be back soon.

01:36:40.387 --> 01:36:43.212
Hey, there's Solar Fire on, there it is.

01:36:43.894 --> 01:36:48.081
It's on, I see it on PeerTube as well, so it's working.

01:36:48.141 --> 01:36:50.706
Thanks, Solar Fire, five by five, wonderful.

01:36:51.748 --> 01:36:52.469
Wonderful.
