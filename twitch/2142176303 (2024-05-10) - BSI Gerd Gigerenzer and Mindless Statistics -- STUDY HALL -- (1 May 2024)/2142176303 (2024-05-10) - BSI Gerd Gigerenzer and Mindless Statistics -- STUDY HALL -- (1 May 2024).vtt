00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I

00:44.200 --> 00:47.640
Can't believe it Cara you're not even second place

00:48.160 --> 00:51.560
You're not even third place Cara. Where are you?

00:51.560 --> 00:59.580
I mean, I was trying to get Cara to win the cash money this morning and then Cara's not even fifth. Oh my gosh

00:59.620 --> 01:03.620
She's not even gonna make six place. Oh my goodness

01:05.580 --> 01:07.580
What is happening

01:08.540 --> 01:15.660
Good morning, Christy good morning solar fire Daniel Annie where in the heck is Cara? She didn't make it

01:16.660 --> 01:18.660
It's like she didn't I

01:18.700 --> 01:23.500
Really she like texted me and said she was gonna be first in the chat and it was gonna be all cool

01:23.500 --> 01:29.220
And she was gonna win the money the big cash prize and and Cara's not there like wow

01:29.580 --> 01:32.020
She didn't make it very funny

01:33.540 --> 01:35.540
Very very odd

01:38.660 --> 01:44.540
But that's where we are ladies and gentlemen, this is where we are ladies and gentlemen good morning Jeff from Earth

01:45.120 --> 01:49.460
You guys really relate like what's up with that? I totally had it set up

01:52.780 --> 01:56.660
Wow good to see you guys. Thank you very much for joining me

01:59.580 --> 02:01.580
You

02:29.580 --> 02:31.580
Ladies

02:57.180 --> 02:59.180
Mark put it all on the line yesterday

03:00.100 --> 03:05.340
Missed his trying it for a third time check that check that stream out

03:08.540 --> 03:11.700
Say it like it is you're not talking about murder and

03:12.740 --> 03:17.460
Lying about it, then you're not I know the dates wrong in the title. I can't fix it now live

03:17.460 --> 03:19.860
But I will fix it again. I guess I left out the zero

03:20.700 --> 03:23.700
I might have run out of room. Maybe I didn't have enough

03:24.700 --> 03:30.780
I might not have had enough text and it might not have let me fill that in so I'll fix it in the in the post

03:31.300 --> 03:33.300
Sorry about that

03:33.340 --> 03:35.340
One-man show

03:44.460 --> 03:50.620
I think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more than society

03:50.620 --> 03:55.140
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

03:57.220 --> 04:01.660
Think but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

04:02.940 --> 04:06.060
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

04:06.220 --> 04:09.940
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

04:09.940 --> 04:13.300
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

04:20.620 --> 04:22.620
No

04:28.940 --> 04:36.300
I'm not sure exactly who he is his name is J. J. Cooley, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD

04:37.020 --> 04:44.300
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand

04:50.940 --> 04:52.940
I like that and I don't like that

04:55.420 --> 05:02.700
I like the idea that storytelling is a form of lying. It certainly can be good storytelling can be

05:04.340 --> 05:08.940
Incredibly effective way of excuse me of lying. I'm gonna drink a lot of coffee just now

05:10.060 --> 05:12.060
But it worries me a little bit

05:13.300 --> 05:15.540
That that statement also kind of

05:16.540 --> 05:23.420
Discounts the power of storytelling and why storytelling can be used to pass on very important knowledge

05:24.700 --> 05:34.100
Without necessarily on the face being that important now. I just I do think we have to be very careful because what we do here

05:34.740 --> 05:37.340
I'm gonna go on biologicals try to tell the story

05:37.820 --> 05:43.860
succinctly of the of the sacred biology and hope that that story makes more sense than the

05:44.580 --> 05:48.380
Stories the lies that they have been told and so it is

05:49.420 --> 06:00.420
Storytelling is how humans communicate actually and storytelling is an art form that that that you know goes back many many many generations

06:01.940 --> 06:06.060
Communicating with with other humans through stories is is

06:07.180 --> 06:10.620
Essentially the enchantment. It's how enchantments are cast

06:10.620 --> 06:15.780
And being able to tell that that story

06:18.100 --> 06:24.100
You know it has to do with being able to distort the truth into simple simple

06:27.020 --> 06:32.900
Simple models and simple explanations and that people accept because they are able to make rudimentary

06:33.700 --> 06:40.340
Predictions with those or have been meant led to believe that those models can make predictions that they can't

06:40.900 --> 06:43.380
Which I think is closer to the truth

06:45.020 --> 06:49.180
And so if you have bros with shows that are telling stories

06:51.420 --> 06:55.020
Then it doesn't really matter what's true it matters what's perceived to be true

06:55.020 --> 06:59.260
especially if people are gonna listen intently to those bros with shows and

07:00.220 --> 07:01.940
Essentially, that's what's going on right now

07:01.940 --> 07:09.300
You got bros with shows that have taught our children our young people to attribute bad motives to those that disagree with them

07:09.300 --> 07:12.020
rather than arguing with logic or facts and

07:13.020 --> 07:19.100
Of course, this maneuver has taken many years. It's happened in our schools and universities as well as

07:20.020 --> 07:22.020
the interwebs

07:22.020 --> 07:26.340
With these people that they put in front of us that don't seem to be able to talk about

07:26.820 --> 07:32.460
The real value of money or fiat currencies or what fractional reserve means and whether or not

07:32.940 --> 07:37.500
Tractional Reserve banking is good or bad and who who controls it does that matter?

07:37.500 --> 07:40.860
None of this stuff is discussed by any of these bros with shows

07:41.580 --> 07:47.900
Because they are involved in making sure that we don't ask the right questions that we don't ask the right questions

07:47.900 --> 07:54.260
That will it will allow our children to see because they know there are three classes of people and they want our children to be

07:54.940 --> 08:00.420
Firmly in the third group of people that do not see

08:02.460 --> 08:06.380
And they can do that. They can do that by teaching our kids not to see

08:09.220 --> 08:10.220
And

08:10.220 --> 08:18.220
They want our kids to believe that AI is the real God that they need to be afraid of the real power that they need to worship the real

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
the real ruling class

08:22.340 --> 08:28.260
They're all submitting to it and it's because they've all been told over several decades

08:29.100 --> 08:33.300
They've all been told over several decades that if we just collect the data

08:34.700 --> 08:40.060
That we can solve giant problems that we could become demigods that we could control

08:40.860 --> 08:45.380
the evolution of humans and these are these are people who are

08:45.620 --> 08:51.780
Descendent from a history of bad ideas back when the special cancer virus program was thinking that they could

08:52.340 --> 08:54.820
accelerate human evolution by exposing

08:55.300 --> 08:57.300
animals and humans and cells to

08:57.940 --> 09:05.100
Radiation and so so much of the work on nuclear energy and nuclear bombs and cancer and

09:05.860 --> 09:13.300
Evolution and DNA was all tied together back when these people were really really bonafide dark-age dipshits

09:14.020 --> 09:18.420
And those people taught their students and taught their students and believe it or not

09:18.420 --> 09:26.940
A lot of those students are now in front of us right now pretending that their model of the world with retroviruses and coronaviruses is the model

09:27.780 --> 09:33.460
And if we don't learn the history of where these dumb ideas came from and who put them there and who

09:33.780 --> 09:42.620
Perpetuated them and identify them for the charlatans that they are before the history is erased our children will be enslaved by these charlatans

09:48.420 --> 10:02.860
Not just these charlatans, but also the charlatans that are currently wearing the

10:03.500 --> 10:07.300
COVID shots is bad, but don't talk about 20-20 t-shirts

10:09.020 --> 10:14.660
Because they are not interested in making gentle the life of this world. They're not interested in the freedom of your

10:15.140 --> 10:21.260
Grandchildren, they're actually working for the slavers. They're actually trying to work for the slavers the

10:21.540 --> 10:29.540
the owners of the weaponized piles of money that actually run the show the control social media that control the television

10:29.940 --> 10:36.340
those those weaponized piles of money that are creating the wave that we need to make our children aware of

10:37.300 --> 10:41.940
make our teachers aware of make our neighbors aware of and this wave of

10:42.500 --> 10:49.500
Chaos and destruction is is produced by these weaponized piles of money this wave that's currently crashing our

10:49.900 --> 10:52.940
Civilization this wave was created by these weaponized piles of money

10:52.940 --> 10:55.420
And if we're gonna teach our kids to surf on it

10:55.420 --> 10:56.540
They've got to be aware of it

10:56.540 --> 11:01.100
They've got to know who the people are and they've got to know the lies they told and that's our job

11:01.300 --> 11:04.020
It's gonna take us doing it us adults

11:04.780 --> 11:08.820
that have already been trying to surf this wave for four plus years and

11:09.300 --> 11:16.100
Adults that have been trying to surf this wave for longer you realize that there are people that have been fighting against the biology of

11:16.380 --> 11:21.300
The vaccine schedule since before the pandemic and none of those people are in front of us right now

11:22.740 --> 11:25.980
None of those people are helping us stay focused on the biology

11:25.980 --> 11:31.980
None of those people are helping us not take the bait on TV and none of those people are helping us love our neighbor because the

11:32.220 --> 11:35.780
Algorithms won't let us see them. They won't even let us know they're there

11:36.500 --> 11:43.500
Because the primary anti-vaxxer that we're supposed to pay attention to is Robert Wallace Malone one of the biggest fakes on

11:44.460 --> 11:46.460
the internet

11:46.660 --> 11:51.900
Ladies and gentlemen the way this works is if you can share it, so please continue to share it everywhere that

11:52.340 --> 11:54.340
Social media works we need to pollute

11:54.660 --> 12:00.860
That that cesspool of information with our own cleanliness and hope that some of the soap smell

12:01.620 --> 12:03.620
spreads around and that people wake up

12:04.220 --> 12:06.220
That's what we need to do

12:06.220 --> 12:08.220
That's how we need to win

12:09.700 --> 12:17.580
Ladies and gentlemen, this I guess is a gig ome biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

12:18.060 --> 12:23.700
and we are coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of a garage of a rented house and

12:24.900 --> 12:30.580
We are funded unlike PBS NewsHour only by fellow peasants like you

12:31.100 --> 12:33.420
fellow people who are not in the big club

12:34.340 --> 12:37.940
fellow people who a lot of you probably didn't know that the

12:38.180 --> 12:43.900
Vaccine schedule was criminal before the pandemic you were just like me you thought that if they were lying

12:43.900 --> 12:45.900
But I mean they weren't really lying were they?

12:46.780 --> 12:51.660
And it really is gonna require all of us to take our hands down all of us to drop our

12:52.620 --> 12:55.220
See 15 year anti-vaxxers man

12:55.260 --> 13:01.940
That's what I'm talking about you guys make me look like a chump because I've had my hands above my in front of my eyes

13:01.940 --> 13:06.260
Since since really 2022 is the last year that I didn't know it

13:06.780 --> 13:12.820
Ladies and gentlemen United non-compliance. This is gig ome biological. I'm a human just like you welcome to the show

13:26.060 --> 13:28.060
Well

13:39.380 --> 13:42.100
Well in case it wasn't obvious that this is a one-man show

13:42.100 --> 13:47.900
I still can't produce the show live as well as I would like to I'm still making a lot of mistakes with what buttons to push and

13:47.900 --> 13:49.900
Where to go and what timings?

13:49.900 --> 13:52.420
But this is gig ome biological welcome to the show

13:52.420 --> 13:54.420
It's the 10th of May 2024

13:54.460 --> 13:57.020
I've got a little different thing that I want to do today

13:57.020 --> 13:58.980
So just a quick introduction ladies and gentlemen

13:58.980 --> 14:03.700
Tra muscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

14:04.420 --> 14:08.140
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic

14:08.220 --> 14:15.540
We will spend a day or two every week talking about some aspect of these main statements these main messages of gig ome biological

14:15.700 --> 14:21.740
but today we're going to take a little step back and look a little bit at where broken science and Greg Glassman and

14:22.220 --> 14:29.940
Emily Kaplan have opened my mind to another aspect of the illusion from a from a different perspective a different angle

14:29.940 --> 14:33.740
It's a different part of the elephant and I do think it's something that over time

14:33.740 --> 14:37.780
Gig ome biological is going to incorporate more and more of this pursuit of

14:38.420 --> 14:41.820
Understanding of this level of the of the illusion to to

14:42.820 --> 14:45.740
To the show and so today I want to do one of the first

14:45.980 --> 14:49.700
But I want is high morbidity one of the first broken science initiative one

14:49.700 --> 14:52.100
So I'm just going to give you a brief introduction of where we are

14:52.260 --> 14:57.460
Remember the idea is is that people on the internet were seeding this narrative from the very beginning

14:57.460 --> 15:01.460
We assumed that that the the narrative was really just on television

15:01.660 --> 15:04.460
But actually the narrative much more

15:05.100 --> 15:11.780
malevolently than any of us including myself ever estimated would also be seeded on the internet by people large and

15:11.820 --> 15:18.140
small by people promoted and not promoted and in fact, it's even possible that a

15:19.180 --> 15:24.940
Exorbitant amount of people were seeded and the ones that spontaneously were able to attract attention

15:25.380 --> 15:27.380
were the ones that then the

15:27.740 --> 15:35.900
Operation you know sort of promoted and some of these people may have missed the audition space or missed the the audition cutoff and didn't get promoted

15:35.900 --> 15:39.060
Or didn't get their sub stack up or or whatever. And so in

15:40.020 --> 15:43.100
2024 we're really left with a selection of the best

15:43.860 --> 15:49.140
Narrative controllers were bet we're left with the best most committed most trustworthy

15:50.100 --> 15:52.740
participants in the national security narrative and

15:53.100 --> 15:58.780
I think it's very possible that that national security narrative is very adequately

15:59.740 --> 16:06.100
Summarized by this slide. I do think it's possible that if you think about it, there really are only two groups

16:06.100 --> 16:12.980
there's a group of people that says that the COVID shots are bad and they've been saying it for kind of a while and

16:14.500 --> 16:21.620
Those same people have been focused from the very beginning on making sure that you don't think about how long it took before you saw them

16:23.020 --> 16:26.220
Specifically, I'm talking right now about Brett Weinstein

16:26.860 --> 16:31.300
Robert Malone and Steve Kurish who came out on in June of

16:32.020 --> 16:39.380
2021 exactly one year and and six months too late to make any difference for the

16:39.940 --> 16:45.260
Resistance for the dissident ideas that might have been in place before

16:46.020 --> 16:50.380
The university students were forced to go back to university under full

16:51.020 --> 16:52.420
COVID

16:52.460 --> 16:54.420
Delusions in

16:54.420 --> 16:59.220
2020 back when Richard Ebrite said it would be criminal to open up the universities because it might kill

17:00.140 --> 17:02.620
250,000 university students before Christmas

17:04.060 --> 17:09.660
Richard Ebrite should really be on this screen here as part of one of these worst case scenario people

17:09.780 --> 17:16.300
But Richard Ebrite never made a phone call to me was never in a signal chat with me. He's never sent me an email or anything like that

17:17.300 --> 17:19.300
Whereas with all of these other people

17:19.620 --> 17:26.620
I've smelled their breath shaking their hand taking a selfie with them and have them blow sunshine up my ass about how cool

17:26.620 --> 17:28.620
It is the work that you do

17:29.580 --> 17:36.940
But absolutely none of these people on social media have ever promoted the cool work that I do none of these people have really

17:37.060 --> 17:39.060
Made an effort to try and

17:39.900 --> 17:41.900
Try and raise my boat

17:41.900 --> 17:47.540
But instead have made a very concerted effort to find out what I think and take whatever useful

17:48.180 --> 17:51.300
tidbits that they are still able to use and not

17:52.180 --> 17:54.660
not qualified to wear that t-shirt and

17:55.700 --> 17:57.900
So for a little while some of these

17:58.500 --> 18:05.420
posers were starting to talk about clones because they thought that they could convince me that clones could spread around just like a

18:05.420 --> 18:11.580
regular RNA virus they say can spread around and the moment that I push back against that and the moment

18:11.580 --> 18:12.660
I said no

18:12.700 --> 18:20.420
what I'm arguing is is that the regular RNAs don't spread around because there's no evidence for that in the literature and

18:21.620 --> 18:29.300
Therefore the way that they have overcome that problem is that they resort to making synthetic clones and the synthetic clones are only useful because

18:29.580 --> 18:35.380
Then many laboratories can start from the same pure place and then they can use the same cell culture and basically

18:35.380 --> 18:36.660
It's the same

18:36.660 --> 18:39.820
experimental starting point which can make sense from a biological perspective

18:40.580 --> 18:46.020
Unless the starting point of synthetic infectious clones is already a dumb

18:46.620 --> 18:51.460
place to start because it doesn't recapitulate whatever signal is in nature, but instead

18:52.260 --> 18:56.900
Creates a purity of an RNA or a DNA molecule that would never exist

18:56.900 --> 19:03.780
And so whatever you get when you put that on a cell culture is also something that would never exist and doesn't recapitulate whatever it was

19:04.340 --> 19:10.460
From which you you say you're deriving the original DNA or RNA signal from and this illusion

19:10.900 --> 19:12.900
stays very consistent from AIDS

19:13.980 --> 19:17.980
to the chronic fatigue syndrome dramas that that

19:18.460 --> 19:24.980
Judy Mickovitz was involved in all the way up until now when we talked about flu for 15 years

19:24.980 --> 19:27.980
And then all the way up until now when we've talked about

19:29.540 --> 19:33.180
Coronaviruses and flu is one of these things that fits right in

19:33.780 --> 19:35.780
But it's kind of doesn't

19:36.660 --> 19:41.460
Because flu viruses are really interesting. They need their own they need their own enzymes

19:41.620 --> 19:45.940
They're they're not readable RNAs the RNAs are fragmented

19:46.500 --> 19:50.340
They can grow them and eggs, but they can't really grow them in eggs because

19:51.380 --> 19:55.700
Sometimes they don't grow what they're supposed to grow or the strains are different

19:55.700 --> 20:00.660
And so it's actually interesting the flu isn't actually an interesting phenomenon

20:00.660 --> 20:04.900
which may have more basis in reality than any of these other

20:05.860 --> 20:11.540
Any of these other things that we're supposed to be more focused on and I think that's also part of the illusion that these people

20:12.180 --> 20:19.140
Are wittingly or unwittingly protecting. I do think it's very likely although, you know, at this stage

20:19.140 --> 20:24.980
I like to take Mike Eden's position and I'm just not sophisticated enough to know because they've been lying for so long

20:25.380 --> 20:27.620
But I suspect that some of these signals

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
maybe herpes virus

20:31.220 --> 20:34.420
Maybe some of these cytomegaloviruses that are really big

20:34.420 --> 20:40.260
Maybe some of these viruses are real phenomenon that we don't understand that have been mischaracterized

20:40.820 --> 20:42.820
as representing

20:42.820 --> 20:49.620
edifying parallel phenomenon which support the idea of AIDS and support the idea of coronavirus

20:50.900 --> 20:57.140
And so we can identify and study some of these viruses and then some of these biologists are actually doing real work

20:57.380 --> 21:03.460
And then assume that the coronavirus biologists in the AIDS viruses people are doing good work too

21:05.460 --> 21:11.460
So the illusion seated over many many years in the scientific literature and in the universities

21:12.100 --> 21:13.460
is now

21:13.460 --> 21:18.420
Was now and and I believe before the pandemic actually becoming questioned

21:19.620 --> 21:23.060
because of people like brian hooker and laura bono

21:23.860 --> 21:29.620
And all of these autism moms that were starting to organize behind I can and chd

21:30.820 --> 21:33.700
And children's health defense and I can therefore

21:34.180 --> 21:36.180
needed to be controlled either

21:36.580 --> 21:41.700
Upon their formation they were already controlled because they knew this was a problem that the vaccine schedule

21:42.100 --> 21:45.220
People were starting to become skeptical that it was starting to spread around

21:45.620 --> 21:47.620
They made a movie that that

21:48.020 --> 21:54.180
Robert de niro went on the the morning news and said everybody should see and that was the movie vaxxed

21:55.700 --> 21:59.380
And so the crazy part is ladies and gentlemen and let's think about this for a second

21:59.380 --> 22:03.220
The movie vax came out a few years before the pandemic

22:03.620 --> 22:06.740
And then Robert de niro was on the news saying that you know

22:06.740 --> 22:12.340
Maybe autism is caused by the vaccine schedule and then crazy enough and those same years

22:12.740 --> 22:17.220
That's when that's when the intellectual dark web was established that

22:17.700 --> 22:25.700
Jordan peterson and bret wine steins suddenly were very popular and public on the on the social media about how they were standing up against

22:26.180 --> 22:29.780
Against their university or some kind of free speech or

22:32.020 --> 22:34.020
That kind of thing

22:34.020 --> 22:38.020
That sam heres decided to do a podcast that joe rogan got the big deal

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
That

22:41.940 --> 22:50.100
That tom kawan had a book that that that june mikovitz has a book that that andy slavitt has a book that that um

22:50.820 --> 22:57.780
That the real anthony fauci book came out that elina chan had a book that all these books coming out in

22:59.440 --> 23:06.580
2016-17-18-19 when everybody is really starting to wake up about the idea that the vaccine schedule in america might be screwed

23:07.540 --> 23:10.020
The movie vax to is being produced

23:12.260 --> 23:18.980
And so I think what you need to see it's a combination of the obviously the financial system in america eventually going to collapse

23:19.380 --> 23:25.700
And the simultaneous illusion of the public health system in america was about to collapse

23:26.420 --> 23:30.420
Because you have all this profit you have all these advertisements on tv

23:30.740 --> 23:34.900
You have these autism moms that are getting attention on the night on the today show

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
Because of robert deniro

23:39.220 --> 23:41.060
And then what do you do?

23:41.060 --> 23:44.100
Well, you make sure that i can is never going to make progress

23:45.700 --> 23:48.980
You make sure that chd is never going to make progress because

23:50.180 --> 23:55.540
brian hooker could change the world if they put him in front of the of the chd all the time and they said

23:56.180 --> 23:57.060
That

23:57.060 --> 24:02.820
Absolutely specifically we want to stop the vaccine schedule because we have evidence to believe that it's criminal in america

24:03.220 --> 24:07.940
That would have been a message that would have caused chd to either succeed or need to be destroyed

24:10.420 --> 24:13.780
And so i'm going to say something very hardcore here, but i'm going to say it

24:13.780 --> 24:18.500
I think chd and maybe also i can are organizations that because of

24:19.220 --> 24:24.420
saboteurs inside of both of those organizations that some people may or may not be aware of

24:25.780 --> 24:27.940
They have effectively not gotten a touchdown

24:28.740 --> 24:32.260
Even though they probably were close to scoring a touchdown with vaxx

24:33.140 --> 24:35.140
And with vaxx to

24:36.020 --> 24:38.020
They didn't score a touchdown

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
And i think that's by design

24:45.540 --> 24:51.620
And i think for a while they were trying to incorporate me into it with comfort and money

24:54.260 --> 24:56.100
And i didn't go along with it

24:56.100 --> 25:01.300
I was offered an nda and eight thousand dollars if i would keep my mouth shut after they laid me off

25:01.380 --> 25:04.740
And I did not take that money even though my family desperately needed it and

25:05.380 --> 25:08.900
Now we're basically paying part of our bills every month with a credit card

25:09.700 --> 25:12.340
And you might say wow you're pretty stupid, but you know what?

25:13.540 --> 25:15.540
We don't have this is it

25:18.100 --> 25:20.260
I know it. I know it in my bones

25:22.500 --> 25:26.980
My kids will either be free because I fought and stood up and did not

25:27.620 --> 25:32.180
Back down or my kids will be enslaved because I stopped

25:32.820 --> 25:34.020
because I I

25:34.020 --> 25:37.940
Wimped out because I felt overwhelmed or because I I

25:38.980 --> 25:40.980
I just thought we couldn't win

25:41.540 --> 25:47.220
And i'm not i'm I don't believe that I believe that actually we are are right now at a crucial stage

25:48.660 --> 25:55.060
Where all of those people wearing that covid shots are bad don't talk about 2020 they're all doubling down

25:56.020 --> 25:58.500
And they have no alternative but to ignore me

26:00.980 --> 26:02.340
Because

26:02.340 --> 26:09.380
It's going to get much much worse one of the things that I would suggest you do as homework before I show you how bad it is

26:10.020 --> 26:16.340
Is to look at some of the videos that mark kulak is loading up on usatonic live three

26:17.940 --> 26:22.180
And they are specifically there is one that's absolutely extraordinary and maybe more

26:22.980 --> 26:24.980
Where none other than paul cottrell

26:25.700 --> 26:27.860
the absolutely fake doctor

26:28.900 --> 26:31.300
Who was absolutely streaming with?

26:32.180 --> 26:35.540
Addy ads myself and kevin mccairn

26:36.340 --> 26:39.140
For nearly two months at the beginning of the pandemic

26:39.620 --> 26:45.380
pretending to be an md all the while having a phd in chaos theory and finance

26:46.740 --> 26:51.860
Claiming to have going through some pre-med program at harvard or

26:52.340 --> 26:54.340
And he's a liar

26:54.900 --> 26:58.100
He was promoted by george web who's also a liar

26:59.940 --> 27:05.700
And he did several streams with robert wallace malone

27:07.860 --> 27:09.860
Who on his stream characterized

27:10.580 --> 27:12.580
DoD as us

27:12.580 --> 27:16.660
Who on his stream talked about insider connections in

27:17.220 --> 27:19.940
DARPA and or sorry in ditra and in

27:20.740 --> 27:28.420
Other places bragged about his connections with cad lick bragged about his connections with three-letter agencies

27:30.100 --> 27:33.620
With paul cottrell taking paul cottrell's questions seriously

27:34.100 --> 27:38.180
Actually lending credibility to a fake doctor

27:39.860 --> 27:41.380
Who in my mind

27:41.940 --> 27:48.820
It's extraordinary to think that somebody like robert wallace malone would be on in august of 2021

27:48.900 --> 27:51.300
After being on brett wine steins podcast

27:52.020 --> 27:54.020
slumming

27:54.580 --> 27:56.580
with paul cottrell

27:57.220 --> 27:59.220
An obvious fraud

27:59.620 --> 28:02.340
I mean, it's pathetic even kevin mccairn

28:02.740 --> 28:10.820
His schtick was built around the idea that that that that paul cottrell was a fraud part of his his schtick for the whole

28:11.140 --> 28:14.100
2020 was that paul cottrell is selling selling

28:14.980 --> 28:16.980
selling silver supplements or some shit

28:17.780 --> 28:18.580
And

28:18.580 --> 28:21.940
As i've said yesterday and we'll say again part of the schtick

28:22.660 --> 28:26.420
That these people have played on each other and other people that have tried to

28:26.900 --> 28:34.420
Get their message out through them is that they they make these little arguments between each other and pretend that you know like uh

28:34.900 --> 28:39.860
I don't know steve doesn't agree with brett and so there's some there's some

28:40.260 --> 28:41.140
You know

28:41.140 --> 28:46.660
Debate that you should take a side on and then if you take a side of steve curse and steve curse will make you feel like

28:47.060 --> 28:50.900
He agrees with you and you are together in opposing the idea of brett

28:51.140 --> 28:56.180
And then so it really feels like they're paying attention to you when in reality. They're just they're just screwed around

28:57.540 --> 29:04.180
And they did this on telegram gab signal anywhere that they existed. That's the that's the joke that these people are

29:05.940 --> 29:11.380
And I think some of the biggest players are people like kevin mccurnan who have been involved in

29:11.940 --> 29:16.660
Wrangling these cats since the very beginning and the best example I have

29:17.860 --> 29:20.500
How early is the korman jorston report?

29:21.220 --> 29:29.460
Kevin mccurnan is on a paper not objecting to pcr testing for coronavirus but objecting to the the primers set that they chose

29:31.540 --> 29:35.540
And i'm just going to throw this speculation out there i'm willing to bet that that that

29:36.340 --> 29:42.020
Michael eden doesn't know enough about pcr primers to have written a paper about objecting about the pcr primers

29:42.500 --> 29:48.660
I'm willing to bet that that the other people on that paper a lot of them are not sophisticated enough clear kleg

29:50.660 --> 29:52.660
Claire kreg you think so

29:53.060 --> 29:56.260
What about thomas bender do you think he knows a lot about pcr primers

29:57.220 --> 30:02.500
i'm not saying thomas benders a bad guy i'm saying that he got roped in to that paper

30:02.980 --> 30:06.420
Kevin mccurnan and by the other guy that organized it that

30:07.220 --> 30:12.340
That other name i can't remember it anymore, but it's it's the first author of that paper i believe

30:13.540 --> 30:15.860
Peter borger is another person that i'm not sure

30:16.580 --> 30:20.580
Is a bad guy or a good guy but was definitely involved in that paper and setting this

30:21.060 --> 30:26.340
This group of people up to be dissidents and beyond the same team and agree about stuff

30:26.420 --> 30:31.700
And then what that also did of course was it put kevin mccurnan very early in contact with

30:32.180 --> 30:35.460
The people that probably needed the most con the most control

30:36.340 --> 30:38.660
The ones that have turned out to be the most problem

30:39.860 --> 30:44.180
How is it that kevin mccurnan mister human genome project mister?

30:44.900 --> 30:48.340
Applied biosystems mister marble head mansion guy

30:48.980 --> 30:56.260
With $10,000 cats is having a paper about pcr primers not objecting to using pcr

30:56.820 --> 31:01.620
But objecting to the who getting a paper published so quick with the wrong primers

31:04.340 --> 31:10.340
Why would he be on that paper? Why would he be on that paper unless the idea was to introduce a an expert

31:10.980 --> 31:16.900
To them so that they themselves would never think that they needed to dig themselves out of a

31:17.300 --> 31:24.340
A coronavirus mystery that involved lying about a pcr test because we have this great expert kevin mccurnan on the paper with us

31:24.420 --> 31:28.740
And he explained what's going on. He's written a great paper that really

31:29.060 --> 31:35.300
It's just mind-blowing how smart he is because he talks about primer dimers and and melting points and oh my gosh

31:35.380 --> 31:39.940
He's this is just great. I got to put my name on this paper for sure because we got to end this ship

31:42.660 --> 31:49.140
And that was in 2020 and it's been going on for four years that player has been on my stream twice

31:49.620 --> 31:52.900
Trying to tell me that i'm doing the right thing and explaining to me how they

31:53.300 --> 31:59.620
RNA was not right or that there are stop codons that can happen with the chemical alterations or that there could be frame shifts

32:01.380 --> 32:07.940
And the moment he couldn't convince me that RNA virology was definitely real and that infectious clones were just a distraction

32:08.260 --> 32:14.900
As soon as he couldn't convince me of that he had to block me on twitter had to start attacking me and calling me a fool

32:15.300 --> 32:17.300
even though we were on a stream

32:17.860 --> 32:24.820
In in in march of 2023 where I explained the clone theory and he fumbled the ball like four times

32:24.900 --> 32:26.500
So, what do you mean j?

32:26.500 --> 32:35.780
So, what do you mean j? I don't understand j. I don't get it j. What about exo exo nj and every time he tried to lob something at me

32:35.780 --> 32:38.500
I just kind of threw it back to him like I already read that paper

32:39.220 --> 32:41.060
No, not like that

32:41.060 --> 32:46.020
Because he was distorting the idea trying to make it seem like I hadn't found what I had found

32:46.020 --> 32:53.060
But that's really what we found there is no doubt in my mind that that's what those people up in the top corner are hiding as well

32:54.820 --> 33:01.460
Because if you're not sophisticated enough to say that they've been lying about viruses, but the observations aren't fake

33:03.780 --> 33:05.780
Then you are essentially dismissing

33:06.260 --> 33:12.500
thousands and thousands of human hours of work as fake instead of misinterpreted

33:13.380 --> 33:14.420
Just

33:14.420 --> 33:23.860
Instead of being a very complicated picture of biology of ourselves where our immune system and all the tissues in our body during health and disease

33:24.500 --> 33:28.660
Communicate with small vesicles that contain genetic information on them

33:29.140 --> 33:35.860
We have been led to believe that all of this is outside of us and the only other alternative that we've been given since the beginning of the pandemic

33:36.180 --> 33:39.540
Is up there which is that there are none of viruses at all

33:40.420 --> 33:42.420
There are no signals at all none of this

33:42.420 --> 33:49.860
I don't we and the funny part is is that I'm starting to get these emails where people say so those people up there have explained

33:50.260 --> 33:54.020
Where disease comes from already in 2020?

33:54.420 --> 34:00.260
What's your explanation for disease and now you see the other side of the trick?

34:03.060 --> 34:08.740
It's just like the clones thing it is just like the PCR thing

34:08.740 --> 34:09.940
It's just like

34:09.940 --> 34:12.100
Transfection they want you

34:12.820 --> 34:14.820
After having called 911

34:15.300 --> 34:21.700
Before they're gonna believe you that there's some crime happening they want you to explain the details of the motivation of the murderer

34:22.420 --> 34:26.580
They want you to explain the the motivations of the person that just broke into your house

34:26.580 --> 34:31.460
They want you to explain why it is that the attacker that you're calling the the

34:32.100 --> 34:36.900
Criminal is doing what he or she is doing. They don't want they want an explanation

34:37.780 --> 34:46.260
And so if you say that virology has been lying now all of a sudden that it's my obligation to explain disease

34:48.980 --> 34:50.980
Imagine that

34:51.620 --> 34:58.580
Imagine if you said for example that I don't think that what they said happened on 9-11 happened and that they were no one would listen to you until you

34:58.580 --> 35:00.580
Had a had an explanation for it

35:03.940 --> 35:05.940
And that's the that's the joke

35:06.820 --> 35:08.820
Right, that's the joke

35:09.140 --> 35:11.140
Because there are no viruses

35:11.620 --> 35:14.340
And and and water and 5g

35:15.220 --> 35:22.180
And tie in all those things together with with some mealy mouth 10 minute presentation doesn't make knowledge

35:22.740 --> 35:26.900
It doesn't make understanding and my argument would be just like Mike Edens

35:27.220 --> 35:31.620
We're not sophisticated enough right now to be able to just pull our heads out and then know

35:32.340 --> 35:36.660
How disease works if these people and their their mentors

35:37.540 --> 35:43.060
And their mentors before them have been lying about this biology for a couple decades. We're not going to just be able to go

35:43.060 --> 35:47.300
Oh, yeah, it's this instead and that's what's the problem with those people

35:52.020 --> 35:54.020
That's the trap that they represent

35:54.020 --> 36:01.060
You're not going to usefully help your children by telling them that these are the biologists

36:01.060 --> 36:09.300
You should pay attention to you're going to help your children by telling them that they themselves need to work hard to understand what's going on

36:09.300 --> 36:15.140
They themselves need to seek out the sacred in the irreducible complexity of our biology

36:15.620 --> 36:22.100
Because having someone like them or someone like these people over there help you out with it

36:22.260 --> 36:24.260
You will never find it

36:28.180 --> 36:34.660
I would argue you'd be better off doing yoga trying to find the sacred biology in yourself or meditation or

36:35.060 --> 36:40.420
Playing basketball or trying to get into CrossFit and see if you can work out hard enough to vomit a couple times

36:40.900 --> 36:43.620
Before you realize how connected your mind and body are

36:45.780 --> 36:48.740
Before you realize how much of a symphony of biology

36:49.620 --> 36:56.900
The creator gave you and you have not been using it because social media divorces your body from your mind

36:57.620 --> 37:05.700
That sitting on a chair eight hours a day doesn't just ruin your back why i'm standing today, but it also divorces your mind from your body

37:10.660 --> 37:14.420
Body was a temple was something my grandma used to always say to me. You never hear that now

37:14.420 --> 37:18.660
I don't hear my my kids by ed teachers telling them that it's it's actually

37:19.140 --> 37:26.900
Terrifying how long I can stay on this slide because this is the reality in which we live right now. This is it. This is the answer

37:27.940 --> 37:33.140
And there are some people over here on the screen that could be pulled out

37:33.860 --> 37:37.940
Of this group could be pulled out of this some of them. I think could be pulled out

37:38.340 --> 37:42.420
Kevin McCurnan will never wake up because he has been a part of this

37:42.420 --> 37:46.980
He used to work for the department of energy ladies and gentlemen as part of the human genome project

37:47.460 --> 37:51.460
Which was basically as secret as nuclear weapons for a while

37:53.460 --> 37:58.180
And he was able to take some patents out of that work and sell them and make companies and so

37:58.660 --> 38:04.100
His family his brothers were rich when his dad was already in biotech

38:04.180 --> 38:06.180
And then the brothers all went on

38:06.180 --> 38:09.700
On the front of newspapers and stuff. These are not suffering individuals

38:09.780 --> 38:14.820
These are individuals who are an intimate part of a real gear in this machine

38:16.580 --> 38:22.420
And make no mistake about it his interest in genetics of cannabis is his interest in

38:22.980 --> 38:23.940
in

38:23.940 --> 38:27.140
Using genetics in plants is no different than

38:28.020 --> 38:34.020
It's transplantism, right? It's it's it's messing around with stuff that i'm i'm pretty sure we should

38:34.100 --> 38:36.340
be messing around with

38:36.340 --> 38:42.740
And he wants to go into virions which are naked RNAs that can infect these plants and it's probably true

38:44.020 --> 38:47.380
But he will distort it as a pathogenic process

38:47.380 --> 38:53.700
He will distort it as something that he has a solution for he will distort it into something that he has tests for

38:55.060 --> 38:56.740
And he knows he's going to get away with it

38:56.740 --> 38:59.700
He knows because they've already told him this is the next thing

38:59.780 --> 39:06.900
So you know take care of this stuff make sure that everybody focuses on buck halter and and the double stranded dna

39:07.780 --> 39:09.780
And we'll take care of the rest

39:13.460 --> 39:20.900
I'm sure he is absolutely one of the worst players in this because he had too much contact with me for him not to be

39:21.620 --> 39:24.900
It would be so easy for him to have called me and tried to be my friend

39:25.540 --> 39:29.540
Called me and tried to convince me of stuff work together to try and understand

39:30.340 --> 39:32.340
the subtleties of what

39:32.340 --> 39:36.340
These so-called infectious clones these pure dna and rna

39:36.580 --> 39:41.460
Transfections and transformations that they put on cell cultures. What could they really result in or not?

39:42.500 --> 39:48.820
But instead he has fought tooth and nail to make sure that nobody ever looks at that again

39:50.100 --> 39:54.740
And just make sure that he says apple back a few times and and tries to equivolate

39:55.380 --> 39:56.260
the

39:56.260 --> 39:59.700
the use of dna and rna molecular clones

40:00.340 --> 40:07.300
Transforming and transfecting cell cultures as being basically a good proxy for virology, which is the

40:08.100 --> 40:10.100
central lie

40:10.420 --> 40:14.580
More or less, I guess that AIDS is based on that that that human

40:15.540 --> 40:23.620
T cell lymph leukemia viruses and and and even uh xmorv they're all based on these kinds of experiments

40:24.420 --> 40:29.780
That are essentially transformation and transfection experiments that these people have agreed to agree

40:30.580 --> 40:33.220
represent high fidelity virology

40:34.180 --> 40:39.140
It's high fidelity because we make you know a pure molecule so we can study it even better

40:41.380 --> 40:45.700
They're not studying anything. They're not studying a phenomenon. They are creating a field

40:46.340 --> 40:53.540
Which bamboozles us into believing that biology that is most likely our own and the and and and part of every other

40:54.100 --> 40:56.100
highly complex life form on the planet

40:58.100 --> 41:02.100
And pretend that it's totally a signal outside of us and they all agree to be

41:02.580 --> 41:06.740
Part of this governing structure that's based on this mythology every one of them

41:09.780 --> 41:16.020
And i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen the idea for example that robert malone is mad about sashalatapova is fake

41:16.580 --> 41:20.900
Just like the idea that robert malone is mad about george web is fake

41:21.380 --> 41:27.940
How could it possibly be that he's mad about george web when he puts links in to george web's

41:28.420 --> 41:30.740
60 minutes episode in his sub stack

41:33.060 --> 41:39.860
And how could george web be a bad guy if george web says that and paul cotrell is one of the biggest md heroes

41:39.860 --> 41:45.940
doctor heroes of the pandemic and robert malone was on a podcast being interviewed by

41:46.580 --> 41:51.620
paul cotrell multiple times in 2021 are we to believe that paul cotrell fooled

41:52.180 --> 41:55.780
robert malone into believing that he was a legitimate legitimate

41:56.420 --> 41:58.420
medical care professional

41:58.980 --> 42:05.060
Are we are we to believe that robert malone was fooled by that other dude that was hosting the show the

42:05.460 --> 42:08.180
Whatever it was called black and white podcast what

42:10.260 --> 42:15.700
Is that what we're supposed to believe just like we were supposed to believe that robert malone got lied to by peter colis

42:15.780 --> 42:18.820
About the the localization of the lipid nanoparticle

42:18.820 --> 42:22.900
And that's the only reason why he took it because he was well aware that that was a problem

42:24.100 --> 42:30.100
And he wouldn't have taken it because he knew that was a problem except peter colis told him that they'd solved that problem

42:30.100 --> 42:36.100
So he took the shock so he didn't say that peter lied, but he kind of said peter lied because we have a video of peter

42:36.100 --> 42:41.540
In 2022 saying that we never solved that problem. He admitted it in an open lecture

42:42.180 --> 42:49.140
2022 so it's strange that peter would have said that to robert malone unless maybe somebody lied to peter

42:49.140 --> 42:51.140
Maybe peter's not that smart

42:52.420 --> 42:55.940
Maybe peter's kind of naive and if somebody said oh it works, then he would say wow

42:55.940 --> 43:00.180
That's great and open a scotch before he ever thought very deeply about it. It's possible

43:03.940 --> 43:07.860
But then we're supposed to believe what that he forgot his card when he went to roem with

43:08.340 --> 43:11.700
Stephen Hatfield or that Stephen Hatfield tells that story, but it's a lie

43:15.940 --> 43:22.820
Ladies and gentlemen, robert malone's story doesn't add up robert malone's behavior doesn't add up robert malone's story changes over the

43:22.820 --> 43:30.500
Three years that he became public and a lot of these people down there. They all seem to ignore it. They don't want to admit it

43:34.180 --> 43:36.180
Think about the fact that kevin mccain

43:36.740 --> 43:44.980
Some some clown in in in japan who has been saying that there might be a billion people dead

43:44.980 --> 43:48.580
And has been saying that it's a gain of function lab leak since it was

43:49.220 --> 43:51.940
Ridiculously cool to say it in 2020

43:54.180 --> 43:59.460
Has been saying worst case scenario since the very beginning and now his worst case scenario involves a virus

43:59.940 --> 44:05.300
And the combination of a bio weapon injection that was you know designed to work together or something

44:07.060 --> 44:10.580
Think about that guy right there has no critiques for robert malone

44:11.700 --> 44:18.100
That guy there who opposed paul katrel in 2020 because I was on streams with him. I have got recordings. We could watch

44:18.900 --> 44:24.740
That guy who was communicating me with behind the scenes with phone calls and or or or

44:26.340 --> 44:30.820
Emails talking about how we should make sure we oppose some of these ideas of paul katrel together

44:31.620 --> 44:35.380
This guy has made no no criticisms of robert malone at all

44:35.380 --> 44:40.980
It's like he doesn't even exist even though he is is is used hours and hours to

44:41.460 --> 44:49.380
Make fun of me and his meme people have used hours and hours to make fun of me kevin mccain won't touch robert malone

44:52.660 --> 44:54.660
Won't touch him

44:54.820 --> 44:56.820
I

44:59.220 --> 45:04.500
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is it. I think this is the brick wall what you see right here

45:06.260 --> 45:13.140
In the interview with paul katrel in 2021 robert malone refers to the intellectual dark web

45:15.460 --> 45:19.860
And refers to it as a good thing refers to himself as being a part of it

45:20.340 --> 45:22.340
I

45:23.780 --> 45:26.340
Ladies and gentlemen, they didn't think we were going to get this far

45:26.340 --> 45:28.500
They didn't think that we were actually going to figure it out

45:28.500 --> 45:34.980
They didn't think that mark and I would ever take each other seriously and they were working very hard behind the scenes to make sure we wouldn't

45:36.980 --> 45:39.940
Somebody told mark very early on that I was a fake christian

45:43.700 --> 45:49.620
Somebody told me very early on that I should be careful of mark because he's so connected to george web and george web is definitely an idiot

45:49.700 --> 45:52.660
And that was pretty obvious to me so I was pretty worried about mark

45:54.900 --> 46:01.380
And then at some point george web had an absolute meltdown and did a twitter space where he called both mark and I

46:02.020 --> 46:05.140
Really bad names and said that we were terrible for having attacked

46:05.780 --> 46:10.100
Paul katrel and calling out paul katrel is a fake he totally doubled down on paul katrel

46:10.500 --> 46:12.500
So now you there you have it

46:12.500 --> 46:14.740
There's no it's no more mistaking it anymore

46:15.220 --> 46:18.260
The list that robert malone put out was a fake list

46:18.900 --> 46:24.500
And the list included people that i've always identified as bad and people didn't believe me

46:26.020 --> 46:28.820
Including mary holland on the list

46:32.580 --> 46:36.260
Including george web on the list

46:39.460 --> 46:44.500
Including sashalata pova on the list all fake it's all part of the same network of bullshit

46:45.460 --> 46:54.420
Designed to create a lollapalooza of dissidents that you could choose a particular stage from and watch

46:56.340 --> 46:58.340
And never get your kids out

47:02.100 --> 47:04.100
That's what this is

47:04.660 --> 47:08.100
That's why poly the amazing poly hasn't gotten this far

47:08.740 --> 47:14.180
It's just the wellness company and a bunch of people on a on a on a new narrative network

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
It's

47:19.460 --> 47:21.460
It's too big of a picture

47:23.140 --> 47:27.620
Jimmy dor and and russell brand maybe maybe

47:28.740 --> 47:32.820
Already playing for the same group of weaponized piles of money

47:34.580 --> 47:40.420
But what I need you to see is that there is a very specific group of people that has controlled the covid narrative

47:41.300 --> 47:45.940
A very specific group of people that has been there to control the covid narrative

47:46.340 --> 47:52.420
That is separate and different from these monkeys that were put in place at the beginning of the pandemic and before to be just kind of

47:53.060 --> 47:55.060
generally present

47:56.100 --> 47:58.100
These podcasts like

47:58.100 --> 48:01.700
like joe rogan and bret wine stein and eric wine stein and

48:02.260 --> 48:04.500
Shapiro and rubin and

48:04.500 --> 48:07.300
pool and cedar and all this

48:07.940 --> 48:13.460
This bros with shows on the internet were put there to be like nightly news stations

48:16.420 --> 48:23.220
They weren't put there to be experts on particular things. That's why bret wine stein is casting such a large net of

48:23.860 --> 48:28.740
evolutionary biology and the kinds of things that he can apply the evolutionary paradigm to

48:29.780 --> 48:35.940
You know complex systems is my specialty so I can talk about whatever I want to that's because he's a nightly news

48:36.900 --> 48:38.900
intellectual dark web

48:40.260 --> 48:41.700
Professional

48:41.700 --> 48:42.980
Slaver

48:42.980 --> 48:47.060
Working for the weaponized piles of money that are enslaving us that are

48:47.780 --> 48:53.700
Slowly executing a controlled demolition of the republics of the west and they are playing for those those teams

48:55.300 --> 48:57.780
That's why robert melon and and andy

48:58.340 --> 49:04.660
Andrew huff did some podcast together until we shredded andrew huff and now you know, they pretty much can't do that anymore

49:04.660 --> 49:11.060
That's why he stopped working with paul cattrell because that didn't work out. It wasn't they were off script a long time ago, ladies and gentlemen

49:12.500 --> 49:16.260
They were off script a long time ago because they didn't get 80 or 90

49:16.820 --> 49:19.460
Noncompliance in the first year like they hoped they would

49:20.900 --> 49:29.300
The zero covid arguments that were being made didn't take like they hoped they would people like mike eden and wolf gang wodock and in america

49:29.380 --> 49:34.100
You can really easy forget that kenut with koski also spoke out very

49:34.420 --> 49:38.900
Volhymantly about reopening schools in 2020 and they wrecked him

49:40.980 --> 49:42.980
They wrecked him

49:47.140 --> 49:51.220
And they don't want you to know it they don't none of these people want you to know that

49:52.580 --> 49:56.500
J about a charia and the rest of the great barrington declaration

49:56.500 --> 50:02.100
Don't want you to realize that kenut with koski said it months before they did and pointed out why

50:06.260 --> 50:09.220
And they were still arguing for a lockdown of old people

50:09.940 --> 50:16.740
And probably for the application of the back scene to old people they were not the resistors that we were told they were

50:18.180 --> 50:26.340
Because they also supported this and and edified this limited spectrum of debate and never questioned the idea of a pandemic in the first place

50:27.460 --> 50:34.020
Even though they were epidemiologists and could have had the data or could have called out the fact that we don't have enough data

50:34.020 --> 50:37.140
Or that the the data in new york is is weird

50:38.100 --> 50:42.100
And they didn't don't you see they didn't they still haven't done it

50:42.660 --> 50:50.900
These amazing epidemiologists that supposedly were smart enough to put the great barrington declaration yet still ignore jessica

50:51.380 --> 50:58.820
And the now public data in new york that doesn't fit their basic models of respiratory viral spread

51:00.580 --> 51:08.420
You don't think gupta or or bada chara or the or cold or could could look at that and go wow, maybe jessica's right

51:09.940 --> 51:16.100
That's what i see and i don't want to be this guy but nobody's helping us

51:16.580 --> 51:22.980
Because nobody's talking about the bodies that were floating in the pool from the very beginning

51:26.900 --> 51:33.700
Everybody's pretending that the drownings didn't happen in order to scare people into into taking a life jacket

51:35.460 --> 51:39.140
Even though the pool is only four feet deep and it's full of bodies

51:39.140 --> 51:45.220
We've been told that all those people died in the pool because you know, they didn't have their life jacket on

51:47.060 --> 51:50.580
But their heads were all held under the water before you got there

51:51.060 --> 51:54.820
And we were told that if you don't put on a life jacket, we could all drown in this pool

51:55.140 --> 52:00.900
But the pool had we same time we have people arguing no way the pool could drown us the pool is only

52:01.540 --> 52:05.140
Six inches deep. They're totally lying about the danger of the pool

52:07.620 --> 52:10.980
No, they're lying about the fact that the people who are dead in the pool were murdered

52:11.860 --> 52:15.140
Trying to pretend that they don't really know why those people are dead

52:15.140 --> 52:19.940
But whoever they're dead they didn't die from the from the water so we don't need life preservers

52:22.580 --> 52:28.260
So then how did they die they were murdered and those people can't say murder those people over there can't say murder

52:28.340 --> 52:35.700
Nobody says murder but but you know this guy and this guy and that guy and they don't even really say murder only I do in mark

52:35.700 --> 52:43.780
And we do need to say it we do need to say that they killed people to create this illusion

52:43.780 --> 52:47.460
I think Mike Eden should say that they killed people to create the illusion

52:47.460 --> 52:55.140
I think I think also Thomas binder and and denny ran core the only conclusion you can come to if there wasn't a risk additive

52:56.500 --> 52:59.780
Novel spreading pathogen in any of the data that we see

53:01.060 --> 53:05.140
Is that they lied about it and in order to lie about it they needed excess deaths

53:05.780 --> 53:09.620
And so they needed to find as many ways as possible to create those excess deaths

53:09.620 --> 53:14.340
And then put people in place to make sure that we didn't ask the right questions that would find those excess deaths

53:22.020 --> 53:26.980
I have seen the alien ladies and gentlemen and so every day I got to spend a little time

53:27.780 --> 53:29.380
working through

53:29.380 --> 53:32.020
Telling people that I've seen the alien that they can't see

53:32.900 --> 53:36.580
And so I apologize if this gets gets tiring

53:37.220 --> 53:42.980
But it's just the way it's going to be and so we're always going to have show at like 11 o'clock because 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock

53:42.980 --> 53:48.980
It's always going to be trying to recapitulate this trying to catch another person to understand

53:49.620 --> 53:52.260
How effective it is when two people

53:52.980 --> 53:58.820
lie to you never mind four five or six or seven or eight or a hundred

53:59.460 --> 54:08.100
Which is closer to where we were in the pandemic with people like nurse erin and and and paul cotrell and george web and

54:08.660 --> 54:15.700
and robert malone and maryll nass and and steve kershen and hert bunden bosshen and

54:16.180 --> 54:20.340
And and andrew huffin mccernan and cori

54:21.140 --> 54:27.860
All of these people who have chosen to tell one little part of the story never question r&a virology

54:28.420 --> 54:31.780
Never use the word transfection and completely ignore me

54:32.420 --> 54:39.540
Since about 2023 when I finally could succinctly explain why r&a virology might be a problem

54:39.860 --> 54:44.340
And why these people might be working very hard to make sure that we don't actually figure it out

54:44.900 --> 54:46.900
That was like annoying

54:47.860 --> 54:50.100
They didn't they didn't like it and neither did they

54:51.060 --> 54:55.060
That I could say well actually you both might be right and maybe if we could get together

54:55.540 --> 55:02.020
Under the understanding of what r&a virology is that maybe we would get there none of them none of them want that none of them wanted it

55:03.220 --> 55:05.220
Thank you

55:05.780 --> 55:07.620
And that's a problem

55:07.620 --> 55:12.020
And that's a continuing problem. We're always going to have this problem. This is always going to be the story now

55:12.340 --> 55:18.180
I don't think they have any more permutations of the story. There's no more moves they can make

55:18.980 --> 55:22.660
What are they going to do bring some more actors out to to oppose

55:23.460 --> 55:28.100
Some more actors to say oh, it's the shocks. Oh my goodness. It's the lipid nanoparticle

55:28.420 --> 55:30.820
I'm sure the lipid nanoparticle is also nasty

55:32.180 --> 55:34.180
I'm sure of it

55:34.740 --> 55:37.700
But you don't think robert melon could have known that because peter

55:38.260 --> 55:42.900
Peter colas lied to me otherwise I would have known that the lipid nanoparticle was also dangerous

55:43.780 --> 55:49.700
Isn't that the conclusion that we should come to given what he just said on steve curse's podcast three days ago

55:50.660 --> 55:55.940
That podcast with steve curse is going to be needed to be erased. That's how bad it is

55:56.580 --> 56:01.460
Because robert melon thinks I think somehow that he that nobody sees

56:02.900 --> 56:04.660
But we see it

56:04.660 --> 56:06.660
And a lot of people are starting to see it

56:07.460 --> 56:12.900
And that's why I think in that podcast they had to triple down on the idea that nobody sees it

56:12.900 --> 56:14.900
And then i'm just a legendary

56:15.380 --> 56:16.660
whistleblower

56:16.660 --> 56:18.660
Which is how steve curse treats him

56:19.700 --> 56:24.500
Or at least titles that there is an absolute lapping stock to me right now

56:25.700 --> 56:27.700
It's a laughing stock to me

56:28.340 --> 56:31.140
Sash a lot to pova is a laughing stock. I mean

56:32.180 --> 56:38.740
George web is a laughing stock and I really do believe that that that robert melon is an absolute laughing stock

56:38.820 --> 56:45.300
We are being manipulated on the dissident side by people that the rest of the world doesn't even know exist

56:46.100 --> 56:51.380
And we've been arguing with them when the rest of the world doesn't even know they exist most normal

56:51.940 --> 56:56.340
skilled tv watchers have no clue that any of these performers even exist

56:57.700 --> 57:04.100
And yet we've been wasting all of our time trying to convince them that our ideas mean something or that people were murdered

57:04.660 --> 57:07.300
And we keep thinking that they're listening to us for three years

57:07.300 --> 57:09.300
But they were never ever ever ever

57:09.940 --> 57:17.380
Going to say what needed to be said and I am one of the few people who knows exactly how malevolent they've been because I know how long they've known

57:19.380 --> 57:21.860
Some of them have known for more than three and a half years

57:23.220 --> 57:26.980
And that should make you so pissed off you can barely breathe

57:32.340 --> 57:35.380
Ladies and gentlemen, they lied about a dangerous novel virus

57:36.260 --> 57:41.940
And if you want to understand why you have to use infectious clone as a search term on PubMed

57:42.020 --> 57:47.620
It's not that it's a great term. It's a term that they made up. So it's just as dumb as the infectious cycle cartoon

57:48.500 --> 57:54.260
But infectious clone is the way to use PubMed to understand how this illusion was created over many decades

58:06.180 --> 58:08.180
If uh

58:08.180 --> 58:10.180
If del is asking the wrong questions

58:11.140 --> 58:16.420
Under coercion or asking the wrong questions under duress then you know del could be a good guy

58:17.220 --> 58:19.220
There's lots of other people and I can though

58:20.740 --> 58:23.940
And uh erin siri is one of them erin siri is

58:24.820 --> 58:30.180
Interesting because he never talks about the the bicp or the cicp

58:31.060 --> 58:32.900
in these two kangaroo courts that they

58:33.460 --> 58:42.100
Deal with vaccine injuries and he's never talked about them as being a seventh amendment violation of our constitutional right to sue for damages never

58:42.980 --> 58:46.900
And he doesn't talk very often about how we could just strike the prep act by

58:47.380 --> 58:50.500
Trying to get a case to pursue that and why is that?

58:50.580 --> 58:58.260
I believe because you kind of have a conflict of interest if you bring cases to the cicp or the vicp as a lawyer

58:59.060 --> 59:04.740
You can't really then also simultaneously say that that's unconstitutional because by taking people

59:05.300 --> 59:10.660
To that court you essentially are telling them that it's legitimate and then you can't at the same time as you

59:11.060 --> 59:16.260
Consul them to use that court also in another way say that that court's unconstitutional

59:16.260 --> 59:18.500
It's very conflicting and then

59:18.500 --> 59:20.980
On top of that of course you may or may not be aware

59:20.980 --> 59:24.820
But the cicp and the vicp are the only place in the legal system

59:25.300 --> 59:29.140
Where the losing lawyers are also fully compensated for their time

59:30.820 --> 59:36.420
I want you to think just carefully about what that ethically creates for lawyers and if you can't get there in a couple seconds i'll tell you

59:43.460 --> 59:46.580
But part of the reason why it's difficult to bring suit

59:47.940 --> 59:51.220
If you're not a lawyer is because you need to hire a lawyer to do it and

59:51.780 --> 59:56.420
If the lawyer thinks that they're going to lose then they obviously know that they will not get their fees paid

59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.100
So the lawyers in the real world of criminal law are

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:05.300
under some professional constraint to take cases that they think they can win

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.380
Whereas in the cicp and the vicp there is no

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.900
There is no reason to do that because even if you know the case is going to lose

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:19.940
You could spend hundreds of hours on it and bill it all and the crazy part is is that before a decision is made they'll already pay you

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.180
I

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.660
Mean the problem with this is is that I want to do other things

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.140
I want to bring other ideas and and be positive every morning for you

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:42.180
But we are in a dire situation right now and so it's it's of utmost importance to me to get this off of my chest every day

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.860
And to take another swing at expressing these ideas because

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:50.820
I really do I have come to believe it with all of my heart and soul

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.660
And that's why I'm putting my my family in front of this train

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.340
Because I think that they have been under the realization that this whole charade was about to break

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.700
And that trump selection may have been

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.500
I don't know

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:18.100
I do know that that whatever is happening right now is not something that started in 2020 with confusion

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:24.260
But started in 2020 in 2020 as a continuum of a plan that it started earlier

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:31.380
That included people in place on the internet so that when that pandemic was declared the illusion of consensus would be

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.100
absolute

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.900
And the illusion of consensus would not be absolute on tv but also on social media

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:46.660
So get ready for a an extreme gear shift as we move from saying stop

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.380
To moving to saying stop lying

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:58.100
And in this case we are going to move to saying stop lying with the idea of mindless statistics

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:03.300
So this a talk that we're going to watch today is by gert giga renzer who is a german

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:10.260
Who I had the privilege to meet in uh april of this year at the broken science initiative meeting in

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.180
2024 thanks to the generous greg glassman

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.900
who has been

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:23.620
allowing me to participate in this in this initiative and and interact with some of the people that are that are

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:32.100
Providing the the content and ideas like malcom kendrick and and uh richard kimbal and and

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:40.340
matt briggs and also gert giga renzer who I actually had the hilarious privilege of riding around in a waymo in

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.780
In arizona while I was there with him because he really

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.260
Wanted to try the no

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.460
Driving car but you need to have a cell phone in america to do it

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:57.060
And so I volunteered to take him and it was it was kind of a fun ride and then it dropped us off ridiculously far from our hotel because it didn't have any

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.300
Potential place to park by that we didn't know how to use it and it's weird

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.820
And so it's suggested to drop us off somewhere nearby our hotel and then we had like a 20 more minute walk

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.900
Anyway, and so I actually

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.900
In the brief period of time that I was in in

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.020
Arizona for that meeting got to know gert quite well because then the next day we saw each other again and of course we were

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.860
We were

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:23.220
You know good buddies and he heard that my wife was dutch and that we lived in holland and so on that walk and that that ride we

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:28.100
We became sort of I don't know if we became friends, but i'm pretty confident that

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.380
That gert will be on the show at some point

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.740
We've already agreed that that will happen, but I wanted to make sure that I give adequate

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.660
um

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.500
Introduction to him. I don't want to have him come on the show and give a talk that he's already given

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:47.540
When we could learn and and see that talk and then look at some of his papers before we have him on

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.220
So that we could have some kind of advanced discussion about what he does

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.060
Um, so this is gert gigareanser and I think it's going to be a nice talk

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.740
I think you'll enjoy it a lot

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:03.220
There's a little time there where some longhair is in the way of the camera and uh, don't don't think that's me because that's me

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.500
um, so this was recorded with me in the room and

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:10.740
In the question and answer I ask a question, but I don't think it's as good a question

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.340
as

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.980
It's not formulated as well as it could be so I might not

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:18.740
Allow this to go all the way to the end because I don't think it's necessary

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.900
The main thing I want to do is introduce you to gert and introduce you to his idea

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.060
Which he's been publishing about for quite some time

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.340
Um, and that oh, sorry. I didn't need to do that darn it darn it darn it darn it

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:35.220
I have this new setup here not new setup, but I had a

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.420
The opportunity to bring a screen from the

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.700
From the Mac over here, and so I have the video on this side

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:47.220
So that means I can go back and forth between my slides whenever I want to without having to drop them back and forth

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:52.100
It's a slightly better than it used to be. It's just you know me having fun

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.020
Gotta make this fun somehow besides besides the funny noises

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.380
Is that plain?

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.260
I

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.700
Today I will talk about our striking leap of assistance and ornament

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.780
in the social and biomedical sciences

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.900
mindless statistics

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.300
Let me begin with a story

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.500
Herbert Simon is the only person

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:34.660
Who have received both the Nobel Prize in economics and the Turing Award in computer science the two highest distinctions in both disciplines

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:43.460
Shortly before he died, that's my head herb sent me a letter in which he mentioned

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.900
What has frustrated him?

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:53.940
Almost more than anything else. Yeah, I can speak during his scientific career. I'll speak it

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.900
Just a little bit significant testing

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.820
now he

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.820
wrote the frustration does not lie

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.580
in the statistical test themselves, but

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:13.300
in the stubbornness with which social scientists hold a misapplication

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:18.420
That is consistently announced by professional statisticians

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.260
Herbert Simon was not alone

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.220
the mass mass mathematicians aren't done can lose

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.620
spoke of

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.100
mindless hypothesis testing in lieu of doing good science

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.740
the

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.060
experimental psychologist have been boring

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:43.300
spoke of a meaningless ordeal of pedantic calculations and

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:50.420
a Paul Meale the academic psychologist and a former president of the American Psychological Society

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.060
called significance testing

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.020
one of the worst things that have ever happened to psychology

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.940
What is going on? Why these emotions?

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:12.180
What could be wrong with what most psychologists social scientists and biomedical scientists are doing

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.300
In this talk, I will explain what is going wrong

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:25.220
the institutionalization of a statistical ritual instead of good statistics

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:33.620
I will explain what the ritual is. I will explain how it fuels the replication crisis

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.420
how it brings blind spots in the mind of

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.980
the researchers and also

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.780
how it creates a conflict for

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.060
researchers young and old between

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.700
doing good science and doing everything to get a significant result

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.180
Okay, so I want to stop it here an example

01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:01.620
I gave a lecture. Come on. Oh, no, sorry. I had to do it that way. I forgot what computer I was using

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.820
So there you go. Um, I'm going to turn my voice down a little bit because I have I have your gert turned up

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.860
Um, I just want to throw out a question there for you just to make sure that we're all on the same page here

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.620
um

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:21.140
Just to ask you a question really simply if I say that I did an experiment and the p-value is below

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.020
0.05

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.740
Does that mean that if I do the experiment again

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.060
95% of the time I will get the right the same result

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740
Yes or no

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:44.740
So p-value of 0.05 means that if I did this experiment again 95% of the time

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:50.900
I would get this result or does it mean that only 5% of the time I would get this result

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.380
It's actually neither, right? It's neither

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.260
And that's one of the things that I

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.700
As an at a catamagician a well-trained catamagician didn't understand when I was doing it

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.900
I thought that the whole idea was to take enough measurements until there was a p-value that was significant

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.180
And then that when the p-value became significant now you had

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:19.060
Knowledge now you had an observation that was worth talking about

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:28.340
And I didn't understand what I was doing that this was a ritual that had something to do with a hidden no hypothesis that was absolute bullshit

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.540
And so I'm hoping that that's what gert's going to bring through here

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:39.060
Is the idea that we have been consciously and intelligently manipulated as a species as a population

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.060
For decades and unfortunately that includes at the academy level

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.780
Where we have been bamboozled into believing that statistics can be used as a way of

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.580
discerning knowledge from

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:59.300
From of noise and and distilling knowledge into understanding and it's completely wrong

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.340
Um, so I'm really excited to do this show

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.340
Go ahead

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.460
Also on the important of trust and honesty in science

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.340
After I finished

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:23.220
In the discussion section a student from an ivy league university stood up and said told me

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.420
You can afford

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.220
To follow the rules of science. I can't

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.660
I have to publish and get a job

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:40.820
My own advisor tells me to do anything to get a significant result

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:49.300
That's known as slicing and dicing data or also pea hacking

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.820
so um

01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:00.420
It'd be interesting to go back to virology and find how often they actually didn't even care about statistics

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:06.580
It'd be very interesting to go back to virology and see how many of those papers were not doing this but

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.700
We don't we don't have time to do that today

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.340
The student is not to blame. He was honest

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:21.780
But he has to go through a ritual that is not in the service of science

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.660
So let me start

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.660
with the replication crisis

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:33.380
So every couple of weeks the media proclaims the discovery of a new tumor marker

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:39.220
That promises personalized diagnostic or even treatment of king. Here we go

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.380
And medically researched tumor research is even more productive

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.940
everyday four to

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.460
five studies

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.460
report at least one

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.620
significant new

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.620
marker that

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.220
And

01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:03.780
Nevertheless despite this mass of results few have been replicated and even fewer have been put into clinical practice

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.460
When a team of hundred scientists at the bio

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:14.340
Take company angiom try to replicate the findings of 53 landmark studies

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.060
They succeeded only with six

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.580
when the

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.660
Pharmaceutical company

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.700
bio

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.140
examined

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:29.780
67 projects on oncology women's health and cardiovascular medicine

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.740
They were able to replicate only 40

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.060
So

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:41.860
What do you do when your doctor prescribes your drug based on a brain about trials that showed that's efficient

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.140
But then it seems to fade away

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.300
Now

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.820
Medical research seems to be preoccupied by producing non reproducible results

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.220
Ian traumas

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.860
one of the founders of the Cochrane society and

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.620
Paul clasium chair of the international society

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.260
for evidence-based health care

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.980
estimated that

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.780
85 percent of medical research

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.820
is avoidably wasted

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.500
And

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:22.660
They estimated a loss of 170 billion dollars every year worldwide

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:31.620
So that's a great way to enslave people isn't it would be a great way to create a mythology would be to spend 170 billion dollars every year on bullshit research

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.700
And that's what they do

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:43.300
They spend billions of dollars every year getting people to study like genetic correlations with autism in models in mice

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:51.300
genetic models of autism in mice which presuppose the idea that one particular gene might play a role

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.340
And so if we knock out that gene or alter that gene in this mouse and it has

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:02.260
Some p-value measurable difference in its behavior that we can call it a model of autism

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.420
And then people after us can call it a model of autism

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.180
And then people after us will believe that this gene has something to do with autism

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.060
And then eventually we can have some dude

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.260
And eventually we can have some dude, oh it's even cramping in my hamstrings

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.260
It's all just a bad right side in

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.780
2016 right a bullshit book that says the environmental and genetic causes of autism

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.260
Instead of a book that says, you know

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.740
Vaccination is a criminal

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.940
The vaccination schedule is criminal in america and we should do something about it. It's like uh

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:56.740
You know make it open. Maybe it's even viruses for all I know james lion's wiler might think that too

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.140
That's how much of a fraud I think he is

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.540
And it's unfortunate because ipac has a lot of people that like them

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:06.900
And i'm sure there are probably lots of people that are really nice at ipac

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.140
But what's this guy's problem for me?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:15.460
This bullshitter knew about the fear and cleavage site and wrote a blog post about it in february of 2020

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:21.140
And there's no way in god's green earth you can convince me that this charlatan knew that the fear and cleavage site

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:26.100
Which is only a few bases was a significant indicator of a lab leak

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.540
It was given that tip just like he was told right this book and it'll be great

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:36.980
Because it'll make the autism moms feel like somebody's listening to him

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.500
But it also won't threaten the vaccine schedule at all

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:46.820
And I think you'll find that pattern holds true

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.300
Even with

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:56.660
With with other book companies you'll see they might publish an anti-vax book and then they'll publish a couple

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.140
Bullshit books alongside of it

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:06.820
And I think this guy is fake because of the fear and cleavage site before that

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.740
I didn't really know but he used to live in pittsburgh for all of 2020

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:16.340
He lived in pittsburgh and guess who he wouldn't talk to for 2020. That's right jc on a bike

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:26.820
Guess who this guy never shook hands with all the times we saw each other at chd conferences guess who just smiled and walked past

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.260
James lion's wiler

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.660
When I sent emails about him, I call him james lion winer

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:43.300
Because I think he's one of the fakest of all these dissidents and he was put in place

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:50.660
To do in all his bullshit during the time when backs came out during the time when unfortunately on the today show

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.220
A hollywood movie star called out some bullshit

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.380
That momentum needed control ladies and gentlemen

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.940
They needed to vent some of that

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.020
And so they vented through people like james lion

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.780
Weiner

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.660
They vented through stupid books that don't actually tell you the truth

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.340
Who little did you know they have encouraged those people to write those books

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:25.140
Oh

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:30.580
My back of hamstrings are killing me right now on my right side. It's it's brutal. I don't know if i'm gonna make it through this

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.700
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be a weak ass. I'm trying to say that

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.980
Might need to rest

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.980
Put my leg up here on this table

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:45.220
Ships, okay. I'm just gonna keep going but I can go on and on about this because they're they're obvious now

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:51.140
You know the first person to write about james lion's wilders blog about the fear and cleavage site

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:56.580
It was one of the first citations in harvard to the big house's original article

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:05.220
About the lab leak that got published on on on on zero hedge and that he actually linked to my bike rides in

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.900
That's right

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:17.060
Now you see it and who did dan seratkin who did his dad work for los alamos laboratories

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.780
That's not just nobody lady

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.220
He worked on genetic sequencing algorithms

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:32.260
So that's somebody who could definitely know the transfection and transformation would have been pretty stupid and healthy individuals

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:39.380
And yet his son is the guy that was supposedly blowing the whistle the earliest his son

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.900
I mean

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.020
And then that's how I got involved in drastic in 2020

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.420
That's how I got involved in the day trading with with these people on slack

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:57.460
And that I realized that yuri dagan had to be fake because he was in that day trading group

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.580
But he blocked me and and and threw me out of his group of drastic because I didn't want to talk about

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.300
The origins of the virus. I wanted to talk about transfection and transformation

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.100
See ladies and gentlemen, we are being lied to

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:19.860
Consistently to cover up something that has needed covering up for a lot longer than the start of the pandemic

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.100
It's billions of wasted dollars

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:31.540
Being used actively to create the illusion of pandemic potential to create the illusion of the need for public health

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:37.620
To create the illusion of genetic causes of all these diseases and therefore we need to look at your genes

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:41.780
We need your genes. We need your data because it's all genetics

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:46.820
It can't be the pollution it can't be the processed food

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:52.100
It can't be the shitty pharmaceuticals that we prescribe instead of helping you to get healthier

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:58.900
It's got to be viruses. It's got to be disease. It's got to be public health. It's got to be you're broken

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.100
And that's what Garrett is referring to at the helicopter level about how this is done

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.060
It's just done because if you want to be malevolent

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:15.380
And and this is the way science is done. It's pretty easy to be malevolent

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:18.980
It doesn't mean all scientists are malevolent. It doesn't mean all science is bad

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.660
It means exactly what i've said with regard to these people on the screen

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.380
See this is where I think it'll be good because I can just go back and get up here

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.340
That's exactly what all these people did they tricked us

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:45.620
And so when I say that these people are protecting something i'm talking about all of these people right here

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.500
They are protecting something that the people on that t-shirt screen

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:56.740
And part of what they are protecting is this illusion that knowledge has been created over these many years

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.060
Why do I say that because

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.900
Kevin McCurnan is one of the people who has to protect the most

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:09.540
Because as I've been calling out off and out on this stream, I believe that the human genome project was a lie

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.620
I'm not saying they didn't do anything

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:19.060
I'm saying what they said they did and what they actually did is not the same and mark lander and some of these people have been telling us for years

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:25.620
They made some landmarks. They found some landmarks that they can use to look at one genome to the other genome

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:32.260
They didn't sequence the whole human genome and now they know where all the genes are

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.100
They made restriction enzyme maps

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:43.620
Of the human genome that would allow them to compare those landmarks across other human genomes

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.180
That's what they did make no mistake about it

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.900
Any other details to that may have come later

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.260
But the way that

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.540
Genomic

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:03.220
Association studies are done where you can blame a genetic cause on autism is done with these

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.580
Magic tricks and these rituals of statistics

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:14.740
That identify the genes in the first place and then if you make a knockout mouse of a gene and it has some some

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:18.100
Some behavioral phenotype would you really be surprised?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:25.860
And yet then you go on and you test the p-value difference between the wild type mouse and the knockout mouse and since there's a significant difference

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.620
Now you've created knowledge and maybe even a model of autism

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:37.220
Please see how malevolent it is that that people like me

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.060
Get trained in such a way that we could actually

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:46.660
Get sucked into this and become part of this system where everybody just agrees. This is the way it is

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:50.340
You just got to get good at it so that nobody thinks you're doing it badly

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.540
if you cut the sausage well

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:59.460
And can make the story good then you're considered a great scientist if you don't cut the story so well

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.300
Then you just don't get tenure

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.860
But if you can find a way to make it work for you this system is great and that's what a lot of these people have done

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.460
I'm gonna have to quit sooner. I'm gonna have to figure out another way

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.820
To get going here. Maybe I need to drink more water

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:17.300
Um, okay, so I'm going back to this one and we'll get this going

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.460
The discovery that too many

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:29.540
The scientific results appear to be false alarms has been baptized the

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.740
replication crisis

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:40.580
In recent years, I do and I do I think that's very right. I think it's very good that thoranos failed

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.300
It's very good. That would have been a disaster

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.180
Often young researchers

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:51.860
Have tried to systematically it could have also failed on purpose to make sure that we think that when people are frauds

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:57.060
They get caught and when people aren't frauds, they don't get caught or they they they they succeed

01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.140
They could have also been that kind of thing

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.540
to what degree the problem is and typically the

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.940
results show that between a third and two-thirds of

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:14.980
published findings cannot be replicated and among those who can be replicated the effect size

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.620
is on average half

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:20.180
So

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.500
In medical research for instance the efficacy of anti-depressants

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.700
plummeted drastically from study to study

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:35.540
And the second generation anti-psychotics that earned Eli Lilly a fortune

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.420
Seem to lose their efficacy when retested

01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:46.020
Which would explain why a lot of these anti-depressants would be wanting to be recycled as

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.300
Repurposed drugs by people like Steve Kirsch or

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.580
Robert Malone who have been working for these same weaponized piles of money their whole lives

01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.780
Right make perfect sense

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:03.300
Let's take something that we know didn't work for one thing and see if we can repurpose it for another why didn't it work?

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.380
Well, because depression was

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:09.300
Defined by p-values because depression was defined by p-values

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:16.340
Therefore, you could measure the depression in a subjective way and then and then orchestrate p-values and then sell products

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.940
Billions of dollars were at stake. Of course, they'll fake shit

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:25.460
And we can do it with with the statistical ritual of p-hacking

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.340
It's interesting how the scientific community reacted

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.020
So what would it do if your result that made you famous

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.620
disappears

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.860
Some researchers like the psychologist jonathan schooler

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.900
faced the problem and tried to think about

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.860
what's the reason and

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.020
jonathan came up

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.900
with the idea of cosmic habituation

01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.660
In his words

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:05.220
It was as if nature gave me this great result and then tried to take it back

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.540
unbelievable

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:12.660
The New Yorker called this the true spheres of phenolmen truth wears off

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.460
Reacted so as a real researchers reacted differently

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.060
And we're not happy

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.300
with those who tried to replicate their studies and failed

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.180
And waged personal attacks on those

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:32.180
speaking of I quote replication police

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.220
shameless little bullies

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.300
which hunts

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.300
all compared them to this dasi

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.300
nice

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.100
So

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.500
Here we are at the beginning of the 21st century

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:51.380
one of the most cited claims in the social and biomedical sciences was i can't do any

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.740
I'll need is

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740
most scientific

01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.380
In 2017

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:03.460
Just to give a hint about the possible political consequences. Okay, I'll be fine

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.180
The news website right part dot com

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.700
Headliner claim by worton school professor scott armstrong

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.380
That I quote fewer than one percent

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:23.460
In of papers in scientific journals follow scientific method end of quote

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:25.780
Now

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:31.780
We have seen in this country and we're also other countries politicians trying to cut down funding of research

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:36.580
And if they would read more about this, they would be more going in this

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.620
In this direction

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:46.580
And those who point out that so many results are not I did a replicable they face a double problem

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.820
They want to save science at the same time to run the danger

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:57.540
That maybe Donald Trump someone else will use this to cut funding totally down

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.980
Oh, that's an interesting thing. So how did we get there?

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.020
The replication crisis has been blamed

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:05.780
on

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.140
Economic on false economic incentives like publish and perish

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.220
and

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:13.460
I want to make a point today

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:18.340
That we need to go beyond the important role of external incentives

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.140
and focus on an internal

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:25.780
a problem that fuels the replication crisis

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.180
And

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:33.940
This is the factor that good scientific practice has been replaced by a statistical ritual

01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.340
My point is

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.180
Researchers follow this ritual not

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.780
Because or they're not only because of external pressure. No

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.740
They have internalized the ritual

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.740
And many generally believe in it

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:59.700
And that can be seen most clearly by the delusions they have about the p-value the product of the ritual

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:06.900
So statistical methods are not just applied to a science. They can change the entire science

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:11.140
So think about parapsychology

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.100
Which once was the study

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:21.300
Um, I'm going to just answer a question in the chat giga ohm does not have anything to do with g proteins g proteins are

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:27.060
Are a protein signaling mechanism part of g protein coupled receptors

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.660
And so no giga ohm means giga

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.620
as in

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.340
I think it's a million, you know like giga watt

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:39.460
in in the movie

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:44.340
In the movie back to the future gigawatts 1.21 gigawatts

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.900
Well giga ohms is is not watts, but it's ohm so it's a amount an amount of resistance

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.460
It's gigawatts. He said gigawatts, but it's really gigawatts

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.660
Oh, sorry

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.460
Messages by the deal departed

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:06.900
And it turned into the study of repetitive court guessing

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.660
Because that's what the statistic method demanded

01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.860
In a similar way

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:20.180
The social sciences have been changed by the introduction of statistical inference

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:25.140
And typically social science scientists first encountered

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.100
Sir Ronald Fisher's theories

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.660
And particular his 1935 book he wrote three books

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.300
The first was too much about

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.620
Agriculture and manure

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:41.620
And technically too difficult for most social scientists, but the second one was just right

01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.140
And it didn't smell anymore

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:51.620
I thought I started writing textbooks and then I became aware of

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:58.980
A competing theory by the Polish statistician jersey naman and the British statistician ego and piercing

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.940
Uh the fissure had a theory

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:10.500
So at least it's not a process testing where he had just one hypothesis naman insisted that you need two

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.900
Fisher had the PV a little computed after the experiment

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.060
Naman appears insisting to do everything in advance. I've just

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:26.420
Gave you an idea about the fundamental differences and I give you an idea about the flavor of the cone controversy

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:32.900
Fisher rendered naman's theory as childish and horrifying for the freedom of the west

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.100
And linked naman peers in theory to starlings five-year program

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:46.660
Also to americans who cannot distinguish or don't want to distinguish within making money and doing science

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.740
Incidentally naman was born in russia and moved to gurgling the u.s

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:58.500
And uh naman for his part responded to the sum of fissures

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:05.060
Tests and said these are in a mathematically specified sense worse than useless

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.780
What he meant was that that the power was smaller than alpha

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.140
Such in uh the famous

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.700
uh lady key test

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:22.100
So what do textbook writers do when there are two

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:27.300
different ideas about statistically inference one solution would have been

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.180
You present both

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.180
And maybe also base

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.860
Or two key

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.860
Anasos and teach

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:44.660
Researchers to use their judgment to develop a sense in what situation is start working and where it's better to do this

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:48.580
No, that was not what textbook writers were going for

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:57.220
They created a hybrid theory of statistical inference that didn't exist and doesn't exist in statistics proper

01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.340
taking some parts for fissure some parts from naman

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:02.100
and

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:09.300
Adding their own parts mostly about the idea that scientific inference must be without any judgment

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:12.740
That's what I mean mindless automatic

01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.060
There it is and the essence of this hybrid theory

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.420
Is the null ritual all right

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:27.460
No ritual has three steps first. This is the perfect part set up a null hypothesis of no mean differences or

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.420
zero correlation and most important

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:35.300
Do not specify your own hypothesis or theory?

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.940
No, it's prediction

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.540
second step

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.540
Use 5% as a convention

01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:49.940
For it checking the null hypothesis if the test is significant claim victory for your hypothesis that you have never specified

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.940
If the test result

01:33:54.740 --> 01:34:00.020
And report the test results as p smaller than 5% or 1% or 0.1%

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.380
whichever level is is met by

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:09.220
Your results and the third step is a unique step

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:14.820
It says always perform this procedure period

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.660
now

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:22.580
Niesa Fisher not to be sure naman peers would have approved of this procedure

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:30.500
And Fisher for instance said no scientific researcher will ever have the same level of his significant from experimental experiments

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:36.500
He will give us thoughts name and also and Pearson emphasized the role of judgment

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:43.540
Okay, so before we go any farther, I just want to give you one example of this so that you know exactly what i'm freaking talking about because i'm getting pissed

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:47.140
I'm getting angry

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.420
Um, and I don't like to be angry

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:57.460
But that's what I feel right now. I feel anger because people are not seeming to pay attention anymore

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:05.940
And uh, when you don't pay attention anymore, then you uh, you abdicate those responsibilities to others

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.740
And that drives me absolutely bananas

01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:14.740
Um, and uh, so let's see if I can find this

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.780
Um video that I was watching already

01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:25.220
I guess it would have been this one

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:32.260
Here and index is a great way to stabilize and get out the door and that is

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:40.420
One way that it's used in some hospital and server and it but in with the tight relationships there and there

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:47.540
So let's just look, you know, because that's what we really are trying to do. I don't want to take anything away from gert. Okay. That's not my plan

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.460
Um

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:55.540
I want you to pay close attention to gert. Um, but gert is giving us a 30,000 foot view

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.100
Of a system

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:04.740
From which these people have emerged and in fact they are trying to protect so what I want to do is just listen to a random

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:08.500
Portion of this to see if we can find any

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:14.580
Times when robert malone will refer to p values as knowledge. Okay

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:19.780
And and it's very interesting because we just heard gert kind of explain in a

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:27.220
In a german sort of way why randomize control trials don't give you any information and in fact the worse

01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:32.820
They are designed the worst information that they will give you and they often don't even test a hypothesis

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.900
So in the case of covid

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:42.100
If you assume there's covid and then you look for statistical differences between two groups when there is no covid

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.940
What are you finding?

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:51.380
And of course that would have been what these people were involved in from the very beginning by assuming there's covid

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:55.140
And then doing clinical trials and reporting significant results

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.140
You are using

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.500
Paparian

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.300
falsification of a null hypothesis, which is what

01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:07.140
Well, if there was no difference between these two groups then the then the statistics would show it

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:13.300
And since the statistics show difference between these groups then I guess my repurposed drug works

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.580
So it would be crazy right if in august of 2021

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.900
Talking to the obviously fake paul cotrell live

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:34.020
Still on youtube does anybody else not find it strange that this video wouldn't get a strike just because robert malone is supposedly this

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.420
ultra censored guy

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:44.180
That a month before this bret Weinstein lost the monetization of his channel and his

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:49.380
Income to his his family was threatened because he put his life on the line

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:54.500
And his livelihood on the line to give robert malone a place to talk on his on his stream

01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:00.100
Isn't it kind of striking that this bullshit is still up on youtube

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.620
Because it is it's just that marks up re-uploading them again

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.780
You see the problem here

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.740
I

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:18.980
Mark does a stream about stanley plotkin and and hillary kaprowski and it gets a strike but but then what

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:25.460
Talks about murder he gets a strike but but paul cotrell and and darryl neely

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.100
discussing the finer points of

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:35.700
Of the pandemic with robert malone is totally okay, even though what? I guess robert malone wasn't very off narrative then was he?

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:42.580
Let's listen to this because this this first 10 minutes of this video is frickin unbelievable

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:54.260
Remember who he's talking to he's talking to paul frickin cotrell and somebody who was definitely at january 6th just like

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.300
um george web was for example

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:04.180
Let's just go from the beginning. I know it's not more than 15 minutes of this before we're going to be absolutely shocked

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.940
to murk vaccines under marice hillman for about nine million bucks

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.700
Then murk failed to deliver and develop a product given back to vikal

01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:15.780
They continue to try to develop products for about 20 for the rest of the life of paten

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:22.100
um and uh well keeping out of people from doing it and then finally the patans expired and the fields took off

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:30.500
So meanwhile, I did a lot of additional work. I my wife and I uh were issued a fundamental patent that covered all vectors

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.780
uh

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.620
um technology for

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:39.060
Vaccine purposes via intranasal and mucosal administration. So this is covered adenoviral vectors

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:45.140
Aav or other methods as well as mRNA and DNA. So we have the broad patent for

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:49.140
um, holly nucleotide mucosal. So he wants you to believe

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:57.540
He wants you to believe that he has the patent for everything. He has the actual intellectual property patent. Although it's expired. I think

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:05.060
He wants you to believe he has the patent for av for mRNA. He came up with the whole idea of what

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.700
For me, it's very intellectually obvious

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:15.860
He came up with the idea of using transformation and transfection as a vaccine methodology

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:18.820
That's all

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:23.060
He came up with the idea and a lot of people tried it and it didn't work because of course it wouldn't work

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:28.180
But he came up with the idea and he's talking shit about coming up with the idea

01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:32.340
But not talking shit about standing up for the fact that we shouldn't have rolled out an av

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:38.180
Remember he supposedly lost his career speaking out for jessie gelsinger

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:45.220
I wonder if he's going to say that to paul control in august of 21 or if he's going to wait until um, you know later

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.980
To whine about it later

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:55.540
Wine about it when everybody's forgotten what he has done in 2020 or what he did before june of 21

01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.260
These people are malevolent

01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:04.020
Participants working for the slavers ladies and gentlemen

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:07.780
And many other patents and and products

01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:12.340
Marketed products having to do with the kennonic with the delivery technology as well as

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.940
uh delivery for vaccine purposes using post-electral fields

01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:20.820
And we were involved in in the initial incorporation of a company called anovia, which is one of the other standard

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.620
uh technology platforms it's currently introduced

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:28.740
Now my understanding of that platform is that it's just presenting a protein

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:36.260
Yeah, isn't it? No, no, no. No, we sure that's that's using post-electral fields to deliver pulling nucleotides into skin and muscle

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:42.580
Oh, okay. Okay. So so so most most of your so he's being interviewed by paul control

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.220
This guy is one of the biggest shitheads out there

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.500
Maximum shithead

01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:52.420
Because he had the the actual stick

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:57.140
That he was doing at the beginning of 2020 including on streams with me

01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:03.220
Is that he was a doctor or a medical student or some expert that knew a hell of a lot more than I did

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:13.860
And now this piece of shit is talking to robert malone and robert malone is essentially rendering his four screen

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:15.940
bullshit

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.940
credibility

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.260
But he says that george web's a bad guy

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.460
Can't you see how?

01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:29.700
Ridiculously damning this video is there's no other way to see it because it wasn't the only time that he was on with them

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:39.620
There's no other way to see it robert malone and jill were duped by paul cattrell and by george web really

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:43.700
They are part of the same show

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.260
The exact same show

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:55.540
Let's say patents or research has been on the the rna molecule or

01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.180
Also the lip and nano

01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:02.820
The the lip and nano particle technology the structure of the rna the synthesis large scale

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:08.180
No one was ever doing large scale synthesis proctor 911. I've worked with virtually all of the nature

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:11.860
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.900
Mark kulak. Did you hear that?

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.060
Did you hear it?

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.420
Did you hear it mark?

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:29.220
Before 911 nobody was doing large scale manufacturing of nucleotides and he helped all of them do it

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.260
Technically the structure of the rna the synthesis large scale

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:37.300
No one was ever doing large scale synthesis proctor 911

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.700
I've worked with virtually all of the nature

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:42.740
Vaccine candidates for biofence purposes

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:48.340
I was at the tip of the spear and in bringing the public health agency canada vaccine forward

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.580
That we now call the murk of ole vaccine

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:56.740
I got murk involved and I got the money from the no even government that funded the ring vaccination trials and then um

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.060
The ring vaccination trials were stupid

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.780
What they were was vaccinating

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:10.820
Vaccinating villages around an outbreak to see if they could make a ring of vaccinated people that would stop the spread of Ebola

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.300
Do you hear how stupid that is?

01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:17.220
Do you hear how stupid that is now that we know what we know

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:21.780
Ebola vaccines in a ring applied to healthy people

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:26.500
Around the outbreak that he got funding from the Norwegian government for that

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:29.540
As a what is he a farmer?

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.940
I

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:38.660
Have also been right at the forefront of drug repurposing for first persica

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:44.340
There's a number of papers relating to zika and zika pathogenesis and drug repurposing

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:48.420
Started a company that went bankrupt. I've done I think four different startups in my life

01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:55.620
Uh and because there was no funding for drug repurposing and then uh since the beginning of this outbreak I got a call from a

01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:01.300
And remember the intelligence community that was in luhan that i've published with in the past

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:05.220
Uh was in luhan during the fourth quarter of 2019 and he called me on

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:09.940
uh, january 4th of 2020 and told me that I need to get my team spun up

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:16.660
Uh because of this new pathogen. So we started working on the funny thing is there might not be anything like Ebola

01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:21.460
but there is a patent out there by cena bovari um for

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:30.260
Uh elongated vaccine or sorry elongated viral-like particles that assemble a lot like what the Ebola virus looks like

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:33.060
Which is this long rod shaped like structure

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:42.260
So ebola virus might not exist but viral-like particles in the shape of ebola might exist and they might have been released and tested in remote places

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.260
In africa to see what they would do

01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.620
And then call ebola and then people like

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:55.300
Steven hatville and maryll nass and uh when oh air maryll nass was not ebola she was she was anthrax

01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.700
um

01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.700
All of these stories have been

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.620
Have been controlled

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:06.740
Narratives in order to put people in place as experts and then you know keep them there in case they need them

01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.340
I suspect that's what most of these people are

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.500
That's why there's a transcript of

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:23.060
Of maryll nass and bira shirab and and rober malone all talking about the anthrax vaccine in 2011

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:32.980
Because this this narrative and the skepticism in public health has needed control for many more years than just the last four

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:38.660
And some of these people have been involved in controlling that narrative even in closed circles of just

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:43.140
Just autism moms for the last 10 years because

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:47.460
For a long time autism moms and autism dads were just relegated to

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:53.700
The biggest deepest corners of the internet where no one would listen to them and that ended up being iCan and

01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:58.580
thd and they thought that chb and iCan meant progress but

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:05.620
In the end, I think because of saboteurs within both of those organizations essentially they don't accomplish everything they could

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:11.860
And they make these these people that are are donating and people that are acting

01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:16.500
In good faith they make them feel like that this is the best way that they can move forward

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:22.820
Um, but they are all collectively frustrated by what happens at the top. I think that's very clear

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:30.580
Um, and the ones that aren't frustrated just don't understand that the questions that these people are asking aren't going to solve the problem that

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.980
Is represented by the vaccine schedule

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:39.540
And I don't want to be critical, but I do want to be honest if if you keep arguing that

01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:42.740
You want randomized controlled trials for vaccines

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.540
You're not arguing for the truth

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.820
If you keep arguing that you want health freedom and the freedom to tell the truth because

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:55.540
You know free speech is important, but then you're not really fighting for the truth

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.580
I mean, yes, you are but no, you're not because

01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:06.820
The truth is is that the vaccine schedules is a criminal enterprise in the united states and and to not say that out loud

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.980
Knowing it is is essentially lying and I think that

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.420
That's that's where we are

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.020
And this video with robert malone

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.820
interacting in a

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.020
Seemingly respectful and reciprocally professional way with paul cottrell

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.860
Who has himself up there? You can see very clearly as

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.660
doctor paul cottrell

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:35.860
Robert malone doesn't even call himself a doctor in his own

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:41.780
In his own caption here. So you see that's a problem, right? I don't call myself doctor coo

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:47.380
But paul cottrell has been calling himself doctor paul cottrell as long as he's been

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:53.060
in front of his camera with his four blank screens and that should be a huge red flag because

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:59.780
He's not a doctor and his phd is in finance and he worked for a catholic charity

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.500
before this

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.780
which is kind of bizarre because the catholics are one of the

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.740
oldest and largest

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.380
weaponized piles of money that nobody talks about

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:18.740
And i'm a catholic. I was raised catholic went to ccd the whole thing. So you know, I I I know what the catholic church faith is

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:21.300
I know what it's all about. I've read about its history. I've been

01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.900
Of two minds for a long time about the idea that my priest for example that

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.500
That I grew up with I know is one of the best people I've ever met

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.620
And the reason why i'm a ham radio operator is because of him

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:37.940
I used to go over to his house and listen to him talk to a guy in japan or it was just freaking awesome

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:45.540
Because the radio was like the coolest piece of equipment i've ever seen in the way that he used it and and and

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500
It just was cool

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820
And and so I had a

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:53.140
relationship with a priest

01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.620
father garum

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:59.540
a long time as a kid who who made me believe that

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:01.220
that

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:04.260
people of faith are some of the most beautiful and

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:05.940
and

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:08.580
And heartwarming and gentle people in the world

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:14.020
That was my model was one of the i'm sure one of the best priests in the catholic church in early age

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:20.340
I tried to take his uh call sign actually, but that that turned out to be not possible

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.700
When I registered and I never really went back to it

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:27.460
But I still kind of wanted to catch his call sign because it's not available again, but

01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:32.340
Anyway, I don't remember why I got to that

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.180
um

01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:41.620
Oh, because paul control work for a catholic charity. It's just interesting computational screening and docking of uh entire library of licensed drugs

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.500
Uh, but lower. Sorry about that. That definitely led to my self-administering

01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:50.980
Some of those when I became infected with a biogen outbreak at the end of february

01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:54.900
Uh 2020 and that led to the discovery of pomodidine or pepcid

01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:58.660
So a biogen outbreak and then he discovered

01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:04.420
Pomodidine and pepcid so I got to go back a little bit because I don't know if he said domain server or what he said

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.020
Fourth of 2020 and uh told me that I need to get my team spun up

01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:16.100
Because this new pathogen so we started working on uh computational screening and docking of uh entire library of licensed drugs

01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:18.260
uh and um

01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:22.740
That eventually led to my self-administering some of those when I became infected

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.820
So here he wasn't very specific about what it was that he was looking at their docking to

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.900
Um, which is already revealing to me because in other interviews

01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:33.780
He said a little bit more about what they were docking to at one point

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:36.900
He said that he made a computer model of an x-ray crystallography

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:43.940
Reconstruction dam of the uh of the three l's three cl protease, but he didn't say that here

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:49.860
Um, so it changes over time with the biogen outbreak at the end of february

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:54.580
Uh 2020 and that led to the discovery of pomodidine the biogen outbreak

01:51:54.580 --> 01:52:02.100
It's like the uh super spreader event in korea that that kevin mccaren was infected by it's the exact same bull shit story

01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.220
pepcid

01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:06.980
I wrote the uh north will it could not be a bullshit story

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.980
It could also be the release of a a

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:14.180
Transfection at those places so that those people would test positive or a release of a toxin so that those people

01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:18.340
Would experience some respiratory systems or a combination of both? I don't know

01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:25.620
But my guess is is that it's it's uh part of the show. That's why uh kevin mccaren

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:29.780
Also has a story like that. Oh contract for that together with jim tartan

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:31.220
uh

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:35.940
Northwell screwed up those trials, but we've carried on i've got multiple papers published or impressed

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.620
Involving pomodidine and then the combination of pomodidine and celicoxid

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:44.820
And it's taken the first of those papers was uploaded in july of 2020

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:51.060
It's been through peer review three times and still not been published. It's been proved in peer review three times proved in peer review

01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:53.060
by the editors of frontiers

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:55.540
Uh at the last minute just like pure cori's paper was

01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:00.020
But those those are the trials that we finally have fba clearance to proceed on

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:01.940
So I i'm

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:05.460
One of not very many people that understand this whole spectrum of vaccines

01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:08.340
pandemics drug repurposing pharmacology

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:10.900
Um and uh molecular virology

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:15.940
It sounds kind of like uh jessica rose whose computational mathematics

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:22.180
Computational biology immunology virology and and something else right

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:30.260
So there's a new drug that is in clinical trials three, I believe uh, it's called i mean you pronouncing wrong but um

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:36.420
Mel new pyro pyro talking about the murk product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's originally called the idd

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:41.700
2801. It was initially funded by the uh crew that I work with at defense their reduction agency

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:49.300
Uh, we tried to get the crew that he works with at the defense reduction threat reduction agency the the did ditra

01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:55.700
You know ditra the one that was originally supposed to clean up nuclear weapons using in cooperation with the state department

01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:00.580
That in uh as part of the formulations we freezing a multi drug approach

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:06.180
And we wanted to include it as the antiviral in our in our combination the other agents are anti-inflammatories

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.060
Uh, but murk required it from ridgeback

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:18.500
Uh, the same character that I was just referring to uh that works for the three-letter agencies used to report to uh, the assistant secretary for preparedness and in defense

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.060
Uh, bob kadlick. Um

01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:23.060
He he helped broker the murk deal

01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:27.780
So he's pretty close to bob kadlick then right because the the guy who used to work for bob

01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:34.420
Broker to deal for him. So if he says that bob kadlick's a real bad guy would be very interesting right because he's you know

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.500
he works with ditra and uh

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:43.380
And he's he's he's not a whistleblower ladies and gentlemen because he didn't lose his job with ditra for speaking out

01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:48.580
He didn't lose his consulting with murk for speaking out

01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:58.420
This august 2021 he's still talking shit can still remember the original names of these compounds before they came up with something like mole pulvineer

01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:06.020
Uh, so yeah, eid 2801 there are so the the name, uh, it has to do with the emery drug discovery group

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:10.820
Uh, ration aussies a famous member of that. Uh, so that's the origin of the original acronym

01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:15.860
And uh, there are others at emery that feel that this is a highly inappropriate compound to be advancing

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:20.900
Because of potential reproductive toxicology issues that they're concerned about we'll see how that fares

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:27.060
There's also so this is this is one of the new hopes for direct acting antiviral. The other one is the Pfizer

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:32.340
Uh, three cl protease inhibitor. So when tony fauci kind of did his great pivot two weeks ago

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:38.980
And suddenly started talking about what we need drugs that we can administer early and turn call it into something like the common cold

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:45.220
He was only really thinking about these two agents and uh, he he has no enthusiasm for repurpose drug

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:51.540
Um, if the dod fortunately, we're entirely separate from uh, dr. Fauci's control. What's that?

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:54.260
Um

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:57.140
At the dod. We're completely separate. Did he just say that?

01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:04.580
These two agents and uh, he he has no enthusiasm for repurpose drug. Um,

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:12.420
At the dod fortunately, we're entirely separate from uh, dr. Fauci's control and uh oversight and so uh,

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:16.100
We're able to pursue the science that we see as most appropriate

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:20.900
And we've been focusing on drug repurposing as I said from the beginning of the of 2020

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.460
And uh, we actually

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:27.860
Uh, in the trials we had designed a three-arm outpatient trial that would be placebo versus

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.460
Cellicoxid and formatidine versus cellicoxid formatidine and ivermectin

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:37.540
But the fda created such a storm with their objections to uh, including ivermectin

01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:42.340
They put clauses in there that were so intenable who would have taken us six months to a year to satisfy them

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:49.940
So we just dropped the ivermectin arm, but the data suggested the triple combination is really potent and and surprisingly the addition of

01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:55.460
So we've been very laboratory focused in terms of so that from our dean and cellicoxid combination

01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.060
Even in certainly an infant outpatients, but in inpatients we can see

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:05.620
Uh, a point of inflection in a lot of the key labs, uh, that are predicted that outcomes of cobbid when we started ministering drug

01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:09.220
It's quite striking. We we now can manage cobbid

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:13.860
Um using classical laboratory assays and make decisions about clinical management

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:17.380
One of the things that was intriguing about the addition those with ivermectin

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:20.980
Is that we saw much more rapid improvement leukocyte fraction

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:30.420
um in the cbc counts, uh, and uh, it it appears that there is some benefit in terms of, uh, lipocyte recovery and uh, but

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:36.580
Then there's the recent data out of israel that that i had thought was was not going to be forthcoming

01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:40.500
There's longed speculation that ivermectin might have some direct acting antiviral activity

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:46.820
And and the new israeli double bling randomized clinical trial with only 55 i think is where i went 50 or 60 patients

01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:53.540
It's statistical significance, um and demonstrated that there is an antiviral component to the ivermectin activity

01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:57.860
So ivermectin is an iver antiviral because of statistical significance

01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:06.340
A p-value that is measured against a null hypothesis, which is we would see no difference between the groups unless ivermectin did something

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:15.940
So, uh, you know, uh, we'll we'll be testing uh, commodity and cellicoxid because that's what we could get through the fda and that took us three months of negotiation

01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:21.620
Uh, but, uh, i suspected in the end people will find that the triple might be the more useful

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:27.540
There by by dress that spectrum of of pharmaceuticals and so you saw that blue box i mean data came in positive today

01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.660
That's more news. Um, something like 38

01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:32.660
Percent 35

01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:38.260
35 to 38 protection is absolutely

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:44.260
That right there tells you that he's a liar

01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:49.860
You don't need to hear anything else because there is no questioning the novelty of the virus

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:54.180
There is only reinforcing the novelty reinforcing the new

01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.180
Cause of death the the the risk additive pathogen that has been added to the mix

01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:06.100
He is absolutely positively reinforcing the worst case scenario

01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:12.340
He's lying about it because he's telling my friend nathan that there's reason for a guy at

01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:20.900
At ditra to be working on repurposed drugs that there's a reason that's malevolence that that they're not telling people that these drugs work

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:26.580
He says that he can treat covid with standard laboratory procedures and repurposed drugs now and they're lying about it

01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:31.220
Who's he saying it to?

01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:35.620
The absolute biggest fraud of them all

01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.140
And we're supposed to believe he's unaware

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:47.060
We're supposed to believe that Robert Malone who works for ditra didn't didn't check either of these two clowns before he went on the podcast

01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:55.940
It was easier to be naive in 2021 when we were all afraid and scared ladies and gentlemen

01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:59.300
There's no excuse for being naive now not when it's so obvious

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:05.860
Listen to the next part rct's ibermectin on that same trial did not show efficacy

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:10.180
But they administered the ibermectin late and it relatively low doses

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:14.420
So okay, it's going to be made that that one was kind of set up to fail for the ibermectin arm

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.300
But the fluvoxamine definitely gets statistical significance

02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:24.340
So we now need to have it hit statistical significance what did he say 35 to 37 protection?

02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:27.060
Wow

02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:28.660
Lion

02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:35.300
The voxamine is another agent that we already knew that uh, you know, I I don't know how it tuned you've been up to the fluvoxamine story

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:42.100
But uh, i'm i'm in touch with steve kirsch, you know almost hourly. He's the one that funded the george washington studies

02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:46.900
I'm in touch with steve kirsch almost hourly

02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:49.140
Stop lying

02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:54.420
Stop lying together, please. That's how we got here people lying together in concert

02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:59.620
Uh, um, this is a difference. So this is now the fourth study about two voxamine

02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:02.980
Uh, that's great. You know, let's see the main

02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:09.300
The watchers need to realize that there is they there is more tools in the toolbox as research researchers like yourself

02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.460
Um are

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:17.700
Investigating compounds to try to fight the disease coven 19 or you know, the virus SARS-CoV-2. There isn't

02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:24.180
Necessarily the vaccine and the way fauci has been spinning it. It was madderna madderna madderna

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:27.380
From very from the kick. Oh, you know, that's right

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:31.140
And madderna was created by dartha

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:36.820
Um, so uh, there's yeah, there's all kinds of angles here that I prefer not to go into

02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:45.060
Having to do with bill and will in the gates foundation and the tight relationships there and they're lobbying and uh, you know zuckerberg can and

02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:52.900
Uh, robert with johnson and who and facebook and there's just a huge array of folks that are

02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:57.780
With with money and power so he hasn't said anything about adenovirus being shit

02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.660
And he hasn't said anything about transfection being shit

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:04.260
He hasn't told anybody anything about the dangers that are to come

02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:08.980
Neither as the bus rider md paul katrel we are

02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.420
We are quite a few minutes into this little podcast 10 minutes already in and I don't feel any danger

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:19.700
I just feel the narrative of a novel virus that people don't understand and are lying about

02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.500
That have gone all in on vaccines as the only solution

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:29.140
And I think I'm a vaccinologist, but my assessment from the upset was that

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:34.820
That the risk of antibody dependent enhancement based on prior work with toronto virus vaccine development

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:39.380
Was so great that in the timelines to demonstrate a safe and effective vaccine were so long

02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.900
And the uh risk that this was going to hit the states

02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:45.940
Remember I started in in the beginning of january. I was

02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:53.540
We have to go back because this is another extremely incriminating statement

02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.300
Why is it incriminating?

02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:59.540
Because he's telling you a story

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:06.100
A story about antibody dependent enhancement, which is a story where vaccination works

02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.100
And

02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:16.100
Antibody dependent enhancement is a story where vaccination works just not as we expected or it doesn't work out perfect

02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:22.260
It occasionally goes wrong. That's what the story of antibody dependent enhancement is

02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:25.380
Antibody dependent enhancement is probably bullshit

02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:31.780
It's if it's real. It is a very small subset of what occurs when vaccination goes wrong

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:33.940
And

02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:38.980
The subsequent exposure to the same pathogen causes a devastating disease state that's

02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:44.420
It's not just antibody dependent enhancement if it is then, you know, I'm wrong

02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:52.740
But I have a feeling that antibody dependent enhancement is a pretty convenient story that still keeps antibodies at the center at the primary

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.260
You know

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:56.820
A model of immunity, which is again his job

02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:59.060
And

02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:05.620
That means that unlike the story that he told j about a charia on the on the

02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:09.620
Illusion of consensus podcast this year

02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:14.980
That he lost his career because he spoke out against jesse gelsinger in the use of a av

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:20.660
On a on a healthy kid that that needed a nude that needed a gene replaced in his liver

02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:23.380
And

02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:30.660
Blowing the whistle on them going off off of the protocol and increasing his dose was what cost him his career

02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:34.580
That he had to get out of gene

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:42.260
Transfection technology and instead had to resort to I don't know starting a breast cancer firm

02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:45.780
Yeah, breast cancer laboratory in Maryland

02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:54.580
That was what resulted from him losing his his his career speaking out on behalf of jesse gelsinger kind of

02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.940
And so here he is now saying that I thought the av or the rna might cause antibody dependent enhancement

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.380
That's why I spoke out

02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:12.260
Which is exactly not saying that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:16.820
It's not saying that transfection and transformation in healthy humans is criminally negligent

02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:19.700
And it's not saying that rna can't pandemic

02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:25.540
It's in reinforcing all the opposites of those things that we have defeated things in the fore asked with vaccines

02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:27.780
And these vaccines may or may not work

02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:30.580
But there are other ways we could deal with it right paul

02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:39.060
Stocking compounds on january 11th after the uh seafood market wuhan seafood market virus sequence was first uploaded

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:44.980
I didn't focus on three cl pro which is what the uh, um, visor drug is is inhibiting

02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:50.660
It's pretty severe rather. I focused on the papain-like protease because I knew that there was all the papain-like protease

02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:53.780
Okay, so I'm gonna find if I don't think he's I don't think he's right

02:05:57.860 --> 02:05:59.860
I think

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.380
Just let me write that down the papain-like protease

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:06.820
I think it's possible that he said in other interviews that he worked on

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:10.740
x-ray crystallography of the three of the three cl protease

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:18.020
And then interfaced all of known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the fda catalog against that computer model

02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:21.060
And if I find that

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:27.620
And I can play him saying those words out loud and that would be really strange right because he says in this interview

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.340
Wouldn't that be crazy robert?

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:36.500
Hey robert Malone if you're watching wouldn't it be crazy if you did an interview a year after this where you said that you

02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:40.420
Used x-ray crystallography models in a computer to model

02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:42.980
the three-dimensional form of

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:47.940
The three cl protease and then interfaced that with all the fda drugs and pharmaceuticals

02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:54.100
Because here when talking to the fake dr. Paul cattrell you say you didn't bother to do the three cl protease

02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.180
You did the papain-like protease

02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:03.380
Boy, it would be terrible if I found a video where you said the opposite wouldn't that be weird to the

02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:10.740
Seafood market wuhan seafood market virus sequence was first uploaded. I didn't focus on three cl pro, which is what the

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:15.140
Pfizer drug is is inhibiting it's pretty similar rather

02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:21.300
I focused on the papain-like protease because I knew that there was already a lot of candidates out there and a lot of attention on three

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.820
cl pro

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:27.860
And ama Pfizer is one of many that are that are candidates for inhibitors of three cl pro

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:34.260
These are both serine proteases and serine proteases inhibitors are notoriously nonspecific in the pharmaceutical industry

02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.900
and prone to

02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:39.940
those limiting toxicity and complications so

02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:46.340
Time will tell how that plays out and I you know, I wish them the best but in with my group of pharmaceutical experts

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:54.100
We've always been very wary of the potential risks associated with focusing on serine protease

02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:55.700
So

02:07:55.700 --> 02:08:00.180
The cocktail that you've been investigating is that with or without the corticosteroids

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:02.100
for individual that

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:04.980
Matter of fact, we've got strong data that if you add dexamethasone, you kill people

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:11.780
Uh, they no, I'm not kidding you. You can laugh the paper is out there. We just had it provision wait. So paul control just laughed

02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:16.660
dexamethadone kills people

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.740
What if dexamethasone is on protocols like the flcc protocol

02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:25.380
What if dexamethasone was on cdc protocols?

02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:29.140
What if if the misuse of steroids

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.340
Was on my slide for the last three years

02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:36.340
And the misuse of steroids can do what it can kill people

02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:42.980
Explain that robert actually accepted. I just got to make a couple modifications about how many people in the uh, study group were smokers

02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:47.140
Uh, which no effects on the risk. Um, and not a waste in a negative way

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:55.220
Uh, so, um, they were not active smokers. They were recovered smokers. Uh, and that actually because of the groups

02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:02.580
They were in it actually makes our conclusions even stronger, but uh, you know, if if your readers or if you want to post a link

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:08.260
Um, I can send you the uh, we put everything up on pre-print service right away because of the nature of the emergency

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.500
and uh

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:15.220
So the formatidine plus selocotsive with and without dexamethasone because of the nature of the emergency

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:20.100
He didn't bother to tell you the transfection and transformation and healthy humans is criminally negligent

02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:25.540
He didn't tell you that they started, uh, manufacturing these things because they've always been

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:30.980
Planning to change the warm base of manufacturing from stuff done in eggs to stuff done

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:39.620
With nucleotides even though he admitted that on the podcast. I was on with him with robert f Kennedy jr and maryll nass

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:46.100
But he could have said it right now in 2021 right here to paul cotrell and just told him just like he did

02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:49.780
Earlier in this interview where he said before 9-11 nobody was making

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:57.940
Uh, nucleotides at large scale nobody was doing that kind of manufacturing and he helped all those people develop that manufacturing after 9-11

02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:03.780
Which is a curious thing to say because marcus said that 9-11 was supposed to be a bioterror attack

02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:07.380
But for some reason it wasn't and he still can't really figure out why

02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:16.340
So it's curious that he just drops that data point because around 9-11 was when he was in maryll and working on this breast cancer institute

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:21.300
So it's weird while he was working on this breast cancer institute with a couple of nigerians

02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:26.260
That he he and his wife are also apparently working on setting up this

02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.580
Manufacturing of nucleotides all around the united states with all these different players

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:36.580
It's all one continuous operation one continuous story

02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:45.780
And they told you that something significant happened at the beginning of 2020 with people like him who were involved before the event occurred

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:55.940
And therefore are very well aware that they need to see the narrative in 2020 and 2021 of a novel virus and when he came out in 2021

02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:04.500
He was still fully on board with the perpetuation of the idea that a novel RNA molecule starting from a mud puddle in a market

02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:08.180
Has gone around the world and continues to go around the world and can be

02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.420
mitigated by

02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:16.020
The things that he and his team that he spun up found as well as potentially transformation and

02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:23.380
Transfection of which he is the foremost expert because him and his wife are the holder of all the relevant patents from years ago

02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:28.340
And he would still be doing it had he not spoke out against jesse bell gelsinger's

02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:34.900
Going off protocol when then he had to resort to opening a breast breast cancer institute and get out of this

02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.060
Forever at least for a little while because he was of course head of an oveo

02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:42.340
Which is one of the horses in the race in this time

02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:47.380
And he even says an oveo is one of the people making or one of the the firms making

02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:52.260
Vaccines so it's an extraordinary level of contradiction that's available

02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:56.980
To anyone who wants to see it now it might have been available even when it first came out

02:11:56.980 --> 02:12:02.180
But we were too confused and too afraid and we were still playing along with the scooby-doo

02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:05.620
So we definitely couldn't see him for the charlatan that he is

02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:10.580
But in 2024 if you can't see him for the charlatan that he is

02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:16.020
Just because he spent hours with dr. paul-catrell

02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:22.260
Then I challenge you to listen to his words that he says to paul-catrell and not see him

02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:25.700
As a fraud because it's almost impossible from paper

02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:30.180
It's readily available on a preprint server and it clearly shows

02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:32.900
We jump from zero percent case fatality rate

02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:38.740
He definitely emphasizes different things at different times because they've been off script for a long time

02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:43.780
It may be that robert melon wasn't even supposed to go public. They didn't even expect to need to

02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:48.980
Because they expected 85 or 95 percent of the people to take the shot and they didn't

02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:58.100
And so this is 2021 where they're still thinking that maybe they can get the rest of the people to comply by the end of the year

02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:00.740
That's what this guy's all about

02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:05.220
Maybe they can get the rest of the people in the world to think that a novel virus is still circulating

02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:07.540
And that if they go on a white house

02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:13.700
Briefing right before christmas and tell everybody that there's going to be a winter of severe disease and death that people will take

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:15.780
Seriously because that's going to happen after this

02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:24.020
And that's why it seems like he flip-flops or tells the story in different ways because it's improvising

02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:26.420
They're off script

02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:33.460
They thought they would get a lot more compliance with the illusion of consensus on tv that they projected in 2020 and we didn't

02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:37.220
In hospitalized cobbid wcho, you know, four to six

02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:41.860
Um to something like 23 or 25 mortality because it's a dexamethasone

02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:46.740
We then verified that's not generally understood by most docs

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.500
but the

02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.500
The data supporting dex

02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:55.940
Is really quite tenuous. It took a lot of statistical manipulation to show statistical significance

02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:58.020
It's in a very small cohort

02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:00.420
Yeah, so so they he says

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:05.540
um, it should not be here's the perfect example of the charlatanism

02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:07.300
because

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.340
Here he's saying that they did some kind of significance

02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:14.500
Testing and that's that's not enough or they did it it disingenuously

02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:19.380
But his result of 35 to 38 percent effectiveness isn't that same ship

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:25.620
And that's how you get these academy dishes. That's how they work

02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:33.460
They do it right. It's the other people who do it wrong. I use p values the right way. They use p values disingenuously

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:39.300
And so we're supposed to believe that although he's a 20 year insider

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:42.420
He wouldn't use p values that way to make money. No

02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:45.060
Even though he's from the industry

02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:52.020
Even though he's brokered deals for these things that people use p values to create value out of he would never do that

02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:55.220
It is just laughable

02:14:55.220 --> 02:15:00.820
How ridiculous this guy is to be taken seriously enough to be on tucker carlson

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:05.700
And

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:09.620
That should have undermined his credibility, but it somehow doesn't and him being on

02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:16.180
Alex jones a week ago doesn't undermine this credibility or Alex jones is apparently how stupid are we?

02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:22.820
We got to wake up and apologize for having followed these people for so long

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:29.300
I know i'm apologizing to everybody that needs my apology regularly and I have a permanent link on my website

02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:35.780
That that is self-deprecating enough to say that I was wrong in 2020 and 21

02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:41.380
And even if I was very close to right people like robert malone and kevin mccairn and charles rixi

02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:46.500
And and richard flemming and richard ebright and all of these people that

02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:54.340
Talk talk talk talk talk talk in my ear and in everybody else's ear made us think that there was a scooby-doo mystery to solve

02:15:54.580 --> 02:16:00.580
And so we didn't get across the finish line quick enough to save any college kid

02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:03.700
We didn't get across the finish line quick enough to save any

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:06.580
Adult that we love

02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:08.580
from making the mistake

02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:12.980
And you can hear robert malone's language his language is not

02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:17.620
Effectively going to stop anybody from transfection or transformation at all

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:24.020
And if he's the expert he says he was and he's standing up the way he says he was then that should be his only

02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:25.620
message

02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:30.020
He shouldn't be trying to bamboozle everybody with stupid complicated explanations about a murk

02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:36.340
Product or that murk product or that murk product or that thing I did or that incorporated product that I did or that company that I worked for

02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:37.940
I brokered that thing

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.140
He would be just really simple

02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:44.500
I I know a lot about transformation and transfection because I hold all the relevant patents although they're

02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:51.140
They're expand expired and I moved my career onto other things because that shit ain't good for humans yet

02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:58.260
But he doesn't say that he never said it on brat. He doesn't say it here. He still really isn't saying it now

02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:02.020
And neither is kevin mccurnan

02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:05.860
He didn't need it

02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:09.140
He shouldn't have taken it

02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:15.620
And once you see that kevin mccurnan and and robert malone are very likely

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.900
Running in exactly the same circles

02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:24.100
With exactly the same weaponized piles of money influencing them

02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:27.540
And that paul katrel just wants to be a part of it

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:32.500
It's pretty easy

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:36.180
And who's the only guy that he promoted so far in this in this interview

02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.500
Pierre

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:41.700
Cory the hero of the ivermectin book

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:44.660
Guy who says that

02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:49.300
Pulsock simmeters were the primary way of identifying covid in new york city

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:52.900
Even though he didn't show up until after the big death wave was already over

02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:58.260
And yet somehow or another he's the head was the head of flcc for a

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:03.940
$230,000 salary for a year or two. He's the one who got the ivermectin book deal

02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.700
And he's the one despite all

02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:10.420
Being all there in the first part of the pandemic

02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:15.220
Doesn't seem to realize that we might have killed people with protocols like dexamethasone

02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:22.420
Isn't that what robert malone is saying right here that he knows that they were killing people with dexamethasone

02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:30.500
Which would have created the illusion of a of an advancing deadly virus, but they didn't what he used just widely as it's being used

02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:32.580
based if you were going to go fully evidence based

02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:34.740
uh and um

02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:38.500
We're there's overlap in terms of the mechanism of action with cellotoxin

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:42.580
When you add the two they are definitely more toxic and lethal

02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:47.940
And uh, this was verified in a platform trial called iSpy that hasn't been published yet

02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:50.260
Uh that we also funded through dod

02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.780
Uh, we had we had counsel that they should not put so we is ditra

02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:58.900
I'm assuming we is ditra because he says his team was ditra and it's dod. So

02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:01.220
one of the

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:07.300
The things that the secret things that I think he's doing here now in in four years in in retrospect

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:10.660
Is that he's connecting in the minds of the people that are listening

02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:13.700
ditra to the dod

02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:18.100
But the real connection ditra should have is to a bunch of shit

02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:23.380
Including the state department and the executive branch. They are not really

02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.340
Do d like darpa's do

02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:30.580
They're not really dod like dod is dod

02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:37.060
They may partner with dod maybe even his team partners with some people in the department of defense

02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:42.900
But ditra is an organization connected to a lot of other intelligence agencies and originally formed

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:48.020
Has a partnership between the state department and the dod correct me if i'm wrong in the chat

02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:53.620
So it's very curious to me that he is interchanging ditra and dod

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:56.420
In this talk. I think it's on purpose to

02:19:56.900 --> 02:20:01.700
Obfuscate the fact that ditra has also deep long ties to the state department

02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:05.620
Which I think is central in terms of conducting this operation

02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:06.900
It's the one

02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:13.540
Intelligence agency that all these monkeys don't talk about they love to say nsa and see us cia and fbi and

02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:17.300
And uh hhs and and and dod

02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:21.380
But they never say state department even though they're the only people that are in every country

02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:25.220
They're the only people that can move in and out of countries

02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:27.940
Easily and seamlessly

02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:32.580
And they're the only way that the dod or any other authorities could move seamlessly

02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:35.140
from country to country

02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:37.140
Is through the state department

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:45.460
Charles rixi's uh uncle or something like that used to work at the state department the state department sells weapons for the united states

02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:52.900
Robert Malone's been to romania three times in two years or two times in one year or something like that

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:57.380
Because you know, that's where the resistance is proceed with the trial arm

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:03.380
In the presence of decks, but they insisted that they do so because they considered it standard of care in their uh,

02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:10.260
They're basically a who 5 6 cohort. So this is under uh hypo oxygen or or intubation

02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:13.220
And uh, so that is where decks is indicated

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:15.700
Uh, they insisted that we had to have decks on board

02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:19.220
And they wanted to go ahead with the trial and in fact they verified that uh,

02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:21.860
The trends were such that we would be

02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:24.660
Um, I don't know how to say this delicately

02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:26.100
Uh

02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:28.900
More more patients would be lost on the triple combination

02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:36.660
Their study also has a standard of care and disappear and I suspect that your viewership may be aware that then disappears efficacy is

02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:39.140
Um, not quite what we really led to believe

02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:44.740
Uh, and and uh must would say that it doesn't support the license that it has right now the authorization

02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:48.660
Uh, in any case, that's that's a tangent that's going down the rabbit hole

02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.260
Uh, but yeah stay away from the steroids that you're going to use commodity and sell toxic

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:55.300
And it's a good thing and you'll see in a paper. You've got a lengthy discussion

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.060
Uh

02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:03.140
In that one, uh, in which I extensively quote tonichachi for an interesting review paper to get on decks a few years ago

02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:04.420
Um

02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:07.380
Decks decks is like a great big hammer to the immune system

02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:12.020
And okay, I'm going to read this absolutely not you know a case can be made that that decks is a great drug

02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:17.060
If you've got hospitalized cob it and you want to pump your numbers up by getting them out the door and transferring them

02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:19.460
To a extended care facility

02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:23.700
Uh, instead of having them dying in your hospital to be a little bit jaded, but in fact, that's what goes on

02:22:24.180 --> 02:22:27.860
Okay, so there he just admitted it right there that they're murdering people and lying about it

02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:31.700
Listen again very clearly because I want you to see how he's smiling

02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:39.060
He's laughing about the idea that adding decks amethasone could create the illusion that they cured people and they could send people

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:43.620
With bacterial pneumonia back to care homes and out of a hospital

02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:49.220
And so they were encouraging people to give them decks amethasone to reduce their immune

02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:52.740
They reduce their their symptoms so that they could clear beds

02:22:53.780 --> 02:23:00.180
And that these people probably had bacterial pneumonia they get sent to a care home where they don't get antibiotics and then they die of

02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:05.540
And he's laughing about it because he because he doesn't want anybody

02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:11.220
There's no reason to think that they would kill people and then lie about it in order to create the illusion of a pandemic

02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:14.660
But he pretty much already knows that they're killing people

02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:18.900
For an interesting review paper to get on decks a few years ago

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:20.180
um

02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:23.140
Decks decks is like a great big hammer to the immune system

02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:24.740
and uh

02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:27.780
Absolutely not you know a case can be made that that decks is a great drug

02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:34.900
If you've got hospitalized carbon and you want to pump your numbers up by getting them out the door and transferring them to a extended care facility

02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:39.460
Uh instead of having them dying in your hospital to be a little bit jaded, but in fact, that's what goes on

02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:42.100
Oh

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:44.580
Is that what goes on?

02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:50.420
This is just the tip of the iceberg of how malevolent this lying machine is

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:55.620
This is just the tip of the iceberg of how malevolent this show was

02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:00.340
I

02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:07.460
If the math isn't working out for you now, I don't know how to help but i'm going to keep trying every day

02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:14.100
Robert Malone is one of the largest frauds that has ever been perpetrated on the united states

02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:22.980
And anybody that's connected to him is obviously also part of this illusion

02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:26.660
And working for them the slavers as I call them

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:30.340
This is a shameless

02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.420
traitor to the united states

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:39.460
Posing as a conservative american, but actually a long lifelong democratic operative as his wife

02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:43.940
Has his steve kirsch one of the largest single donors to the dnc

02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:48.260
These people are pathetic

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:52.020
And they are lying to us so that we are a lie to our kids about this stuff

02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:59.300
And if we don't wake up in the next few months by a significant number of people to fully reject people like this

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:02.740
We may not ever escape

02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:11.780
Clearly this election is screwed clearly no matter who gets elected in this election. We are still going to be fighting this fraud

02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:20.500
And so this is this is just the start of the fight ladies and gentlemen the uni party

02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:23.060
needs to be destroyed

02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:30.900
That dichotomy that that Robert Malone and steve kirsch and all these people are trying to enforce needs to be destroyed

02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:38.020
And we need to elect some plumbers and some teachers and some

02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:39.700
some

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:45.540
some carpenters and some entrepreneurs and some social workers and some

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:54.820
People that have actually lived in reality and sacrificed their their adulthood for the sake of others to office in the united states

02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:00.740
We need to open the books. We need to put cameras in the rooms where these people talk in private

02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:06.500
We need to publish their discussions and take the cameras off the streets and put them into our

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:09.220
Congress and into our house of representatives

02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:11.700
The

02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:17.300
People like Robert Malone who have been brokering these multi-million and multi-billion dollar deals for

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:22.580
Pharmaceutical products that are proven to work only by the ritual of

02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:25.860
statistical mindlessness

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:28.740
Need to be ended as relevant

02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:36.980
He is an a perfect example of academy justians and how they work just like what

02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:39.540
Garrett is talking about

02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:47.140
Two fighting came agreed on one thing it was scientific inference cannot be mechanical

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:49.940
You need to use your brain

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:55.300
And that was exactly the message the non-ritual did not convey

02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:58.580
Maybe it wanted a mechanical procedure

02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:03.860
So that's what that's what he's telling you is the reason why some of his drug recombination

02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:14.180
These recombinant drug these these repurposed combinations of drugs reach significance, but it's not his fault

02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:22.660
It's just the way it is either it's not or it is and it looks like statistically it is so therefore we have knowledge

02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:28.180
Robert Malone is an academy justian but not an academy justian that's just naive

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:34.100
He works for people who he knows regularly game this bullshit system

02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:36.980
He helps them do it

02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.260
He helps them do it with the illusion of integrity

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:47.220
And at the same time at the other side of his mouth he says that nobody in this field has integrity

02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:50.180
Thought she doesn't have integrity just me

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:57.140
Is there's a lot of manipulation of hospital case fatality rates by off-living

02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:01.140
patients to

02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:06.660
Various triage options. Oh, and so that doesn't mean that they're lying about murder

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:16.100
Interesting right he says they're lying about murder, but he doesn't say they're murdering anybody. It's like what accident? It's bad information

02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:20.660
It's not creating a fake pandemic from nothing

02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.540
And

02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:27.780
Who's he talking to the brilliant Paul Catrell? He's so insightful isn't he?

02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:34.660
It's crazy the kinds of questions that he asks ladies and gentlemen Paul Catrell and Robert Malone being on the same podcast

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.300
More than once talking for hours about the bullshit

02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:40.980
You just heard them talking about and more than 70 minutes more

02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:47.860
Is the most damning evidence that Robert Malone is on the team of the slavers than anything i've ever seen

02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:55.060
Never mind that the contents of that interview contradict the contents of interviews that come after

02:28:56.820 --> 02:29:02.500
That his story changes that his emphasis changes Robert Malone is awful

02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:08.420
And anybody that says that there's sub stack defending Robert Malone

02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:14.660
In 2023 is the most important sub stack they've ever written is just as awful as him

02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:21.540
And yes, i'm talking about Meryl nass because she wrote a sub stack saying that this was the most important sub stack

02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:23.620
She ever wrote and was defending Robert Malone

02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:30.260
And then a month later Robert Malone came out and said that chd was a shitty organization and evidence of how

02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:33.940
Shitty a manager Robert or Robert F Kennedy jr. Is

02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:38.180
Despite the fact that that shitty organization

02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:41.940
Published his shitty book

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:44.900
Right

02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:55.300
I can't wait until I see Robert Malone in person again so I can watch him get on all fours

02:29:55.780 --> 02:29:57.220
the tail

02:29:57.220 --> 02:30:01.220
Fall out of his pants and him scramble away like the giant rat that he is

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:06.740
Measure the quality of an article

02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:14.100
Now what did the poor readers of this text box do with a mishmash of two theories

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:18.980
Which would not mention that it is a mishmash

02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:23.060
Not in the names of naming and piercing attached to the theories

02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:29.940
So the result was that the external conflict between the two groups of statistician

02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:33.940
The decision went into an internal conflict in the average researcher

02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:35.620
So the average

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:38.100
I use a Freudian analogy to make that clear

02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:40.980
So the super ego was name and piercing theory

02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:44.820
So the average researcher somehow believed that he or she had to

02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:53.460
Have two hypothesis and and actually give thought about alpha and the power before the experiment and calculate the number of substitutes you need

02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:56.740
But the ego the fisher in part

02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:59.860
Got the things done and published

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.300
But left is a feeling of guilt of having violated the rules

02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:08.180
And at the at the bottom was the Bayesian aid

02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:15.140
longing for probabilities of hypothesis which neither of these two theories could deliver

02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:19.380
How did all these come apart?

02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:22.180
So how could this happen?

02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:24.820
I'll give you another story

02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:29.060
I once visited a distinguished statistical textbook writer

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:31.620
whose book went through

02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:33.620
many edition and whose name doesn't matter

02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:36.820
He was one of the only ones

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:40.260
Actually, his book was one of the best one in the social sciences

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:46.020
And he was the only one who had in an early edition a chapter on base and also

02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:48.740
albeit only one sentence

02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:55.700
Mentioning that there is a theory of fisher and a different one of person name and person

02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:58.500
So

02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:02.820
To mention the existence of alternative theories was unheard of

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:06.180
And even names attached to that

02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:09.300
So I asked him

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:14.020
Why he took out the chapter on base and this one sentence

02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:17.300
From all further editions

02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:22.900
When I met him was just busy having I think was the fifth edition of his best selling book

02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:28.020
And why he I asked him created a

02:32:30.580 --> 02:32:32.580
inconsistent hybrid

02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.220
That every decent statistician would have rejected

02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:40.260
To his credit, I should say that he also did not

02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:44.740
attempt to deny that he had produced an illusion, but

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:50.260
He let me know whom to blame for and where three culprits first

02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:57.460
His fellow researchers, then the university administration and third his publisher

02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:04.100
His fellow researchers he said are not interested in doing good statistics. I want that papers published

02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:07.380
The university administration promoted people

02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:12.980
By the number of publications which were enforced the researchers added to it

02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:15.860
And his publisher

02:33:16.660 --> 02:33:21.540
Did not want to hear about different theories

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:25.300
He wanted a single recipe cookbook

02:33:25.940 --> 02:33:30.500
And forced him so the author told me to take out the Bayesian chapter

02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:37.540
And even this single only one sentence about fisher and name and person series

02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:41.780
At the end of our conversation

02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:44.660
I asked him

02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:47.940
In what statistical theory he himself believes

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:52.420
And he said

02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:55.220
In my heart

02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:57.220
I'm a Bayesian

02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.380
Now

02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:02.660
If they also was telling me the truth he had sold his heart

02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:06.580
For multiple editions of a famous book

02:34:07.380 --> 02:34:09.620
Whose message he did not believe in

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:16.500
10,000 students have read this text believing that it reveals the method of science

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:21.620
Dozens of less informed textbook writers copied his text

02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:29.220
Joining out a flood of offspring textbooks inconsistent and not noticing the mess

02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:35.540
Now you understand right you understand right that what this means and what caret and girt is trying to tell you

02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:39.620
Is that these ideas of how to use probability without

02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:42.820
Your mind

02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:46.340
In other words, you have a null hypothesis and then one you think you're testing

02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:48.340
But then the experiment doesn't test that

02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:52.740
Because the null hypothesis is kind of like there's no difference. So that's not really

02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:55.940
It's not explaining anything

02:34:56.740 --> 02:35:03.220
And your test of whether the null hypothesis is different from your hypothesis actually doesn't test your hypothesis at all

02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:08.260
And so the argument that was

02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:14.420
Bled together from these two separate kind of ideas on how to use statistics to test observations

02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:17.780
Were put together to create this illusion that you could

02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:23.540
Mindlessly use statistics to find observations that were significant

02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:29.460
This was actually sustained in textbooks

02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:35.140
Imagine the malevolence

02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:43.300
That needs to be present in order for our entire academia to have been turned upside down by people who understand it

02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:46.100
And choose not to teach it

02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:49.300
And so you have this huge

02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:52.180
behemoth of money

02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:54.660
That's being

02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:59.220
Fed to universities and then they are employing it to create this noise

02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:05.140
Create this knowledge and they are using a fundamentally for a flawed procedure

02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:07.700
Because they've all agreed that it's

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.260
it's it's

02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:13.700
And they know how to use

02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:19.620
And Robert Malone as he showed very definitively in that

02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:25.540
In that interview knows that this can be gained. It can be used can be lied to you can p-hack

02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:28.580
But he doesn't do it

02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:33.460
Yet in that same little discussion he tells you that a 35 to 38

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:40.100
Difference between placebo and the experimental group is a significant result

02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:44.980
Because he doesn't p-hack they p-hack

02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:57.540
And the reality is is that everybody that uses these p-values and a null hypothesis the null hypothesis for Robert Malone

02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:03.460
Well, there's no difference between us giving them these three drugs and not giving them these three drugs

02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:09.300
And if there is a difference then the difference we see is because of these three drugs

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:12.420
And since we assume

02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:18.580
Our hypothesis is that these drugs work on covid and we're not going to test whether they actually have covid or whether

02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:20.580
It's real covid or what covid is

02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:24.420
We're just going to look at a difference between these two groups and because over here

02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:27.940
Way outside of the wording of the paper

02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:31.860
There's this hypothesis that we're not testing that these drugs work on covid

02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:36.580
Then when we get a significant result that there is a difference between these two groups

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:43.380
We assume we've tested this hypothesis over here when really all we've asked is whether or not there's a difference between

02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:47.380
People that get these drugs and people that don't get these drugs

02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:51.700
Is it surprising that if you give people a combination of three drugs that they have different

02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:59.220
Behavioral and and symptom different symptomologies than people who don't get those drugs. Is that not surprising? Is that surprising to you?

02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:05.700
And that's how they do it

02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:14.660
That's why I didn't make it in academic biology because I couldn't figure out how to make this work for me and feel good about it

02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:20.180
And I didn't understand that it was a cognitive dissonance that was preventing me from doing it

02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:21.940
I just thought that I wasn't very good at it

02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:26.900
And that's more importantly what a lot of those people made me feel like that I wasn't very good at it

02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:31.700
But I was more frustrated with the questions we're asking don't really feel like they're moving the ball forward

02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:33.700
I want to ask different questions. No, no, no

02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:37.460
We got to ask little questions that have little answers

02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:40.180
So we can make a little progress

02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:43.780
toward addressing that hypothesis in the other room

02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:47.540
That's how this works

02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:53.380
Firm ritual for this procedure for the essence of the hybrid logic

02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:56.820
Because it resembles two social rights

02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:03.460
Social rights have typically the following elements. They are sacred numbers or colors

02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:08.420
Then there's a repetition of the same action again and again

02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.500
And then there's fear fear about being punished if you don't

02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:15.700
Repeat this action and finally delusions

02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:21.140
You have to have delusions in order to conduct the ritual

02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:26.660
The non ritual contains all of these features. There's a fixation on 5%

02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:30.980
I mean functional MRI. It's colors

02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:37.380
Second functional MRI my gosh if that hasn't ruined

02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:41.860
Cognitive neuroscience. I don't know what has this idea that if they just

02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:48.100
Take a magnetic picture of the of the oxygenated and unoxygenated hemoglobin in your brain

02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:50.340
They can pinpoint where

02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:55.540
Certain activity in the brain is and therefore they can learn whether certain parts of the brain are involved in anything

02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:58.900
And the crazy thing is depending on how they set the color scheme

02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:04.340
And depending on what they say is significance then they can find pretty much whatever they want to and indeed

02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:05.620
mRNA

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:07.700
MRI

02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:12.420
The field itself is just it's just become a giant toilet bowl of noise

02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:17.620
Great way to stabilize them get out the door and that is one way that is used in some hospital guidance

02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:24.100
That's very interesting. So let's let's pin it to the antibody dependent enhancement and vaccine

02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:29.700
Sorry, I pushed the wrong video again this one. There's repetitive

02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:31.300
behavior

02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:33.300
resembling compulsive handwashing

02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:36.020
And third there's fear of sanctions

02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:38.500
by editors

02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:44.020
Or advisors and finally there's a delusion about what a p-value means

02:40:45.140 --> 02:40:52.900
And about describe that in moment. Let me just give you a few examples about the mindless performance of the ritual

02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:56.260
There may be funny

02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:58.740
But deep it's really disconcerning

02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:04.900
So in an internet study on implicit theories of moral courage

02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:11.940
Philip Simbardo who's famous for his stain for prison experiments and two colleagues

02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:14.660
ask their participants

02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:20.420
Do you feel that there's a difference between altruism and heroism?

02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:22.820
hmm

02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:24.820
Most felt so

02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:29.620
2347 respondents said yes and only 58 said no

02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:33.940
Now they also computed a chi-square test

02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:38.340
To answer whether these two numbers are the same or different

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:42.900
And I found that I indeed different

02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:47.540
A greater student of mine a smart one

02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:50.500
Had the opposite situation

02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.340
His name is pogo pogo ran

02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:59.140
an experiment with two groups and found that the two means are exactly the same

02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:02.580
but pogo could not just write that or

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:05.060
Say that

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:13.460
He felt he had to do a statistical test a t-test to find out whether the two exactly same numbers differ significantly and he found that they don't

02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:16.740
And the p-value was impressively high

02:42:18.100 --> 02:42:20.900
He is a third illustration

02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:29.780
I recently reviewed an article in which the number of subjects was 57

02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:37.140
They also calculated a 95% confidence interval

02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:44.820
These are great too for the number of subjects and concluded the confidence interval is between 47 and 67

02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:49.620
Don't ask why I did it. It's mindless

02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:55.060
Almost every number in this paper was scrutinized in the same way

02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:00.100
There are only numbers in the paper that had no confidence where the page numbers

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:05.620
This is an extreme case

02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:08.260
But unfortunately, it's not exception

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:15.540
Consider all behavioral neuropsychological and medical studies in nature in the year 2011

02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:18.420
89% of his studies

02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:21.300
report only p-values

02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:28.660
And nothing else that's of importance such as no effect sizes, no power, no model estimation

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.900
or an analysis of the academy of management term

02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:41.220
In a year later reported that the average number of p-values in an article is guess

02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:44.340
How many p-values

02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:46.420
If you have two hypotheses, you wouldn't need two

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:50.660
99

02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:53.140
It's a mechanical testing of any number

02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:58.740
So the idol of automatic universal inference

02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:01.700
However, it's not unique to p-values

02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:04.260
Or confidence intervals

02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:05.860
Then it's Lindley

02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:09.700
A leading advocate of Bayesian statistics once declared that

02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:12.900
The only good statistic is Bayesian statistics

02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:14.820
And

02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:18.260
That Bayesian methods are even more automatic

02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:21.060
in his opinion than

02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:23.060
Fisher's friend methods

02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:24.980
So the danger is here

02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:29.140
You don't have much progress if you use Bayes factors just as mindless

02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:31.060
That's not

02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:38.900
So let me go on an extremely important point that can be illustrated in neuroscience because neuroscience is one of the places where

02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:43.220
Bayesian statistics kind of took off first and people started to use

02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:49.700
And again, if you make a dumb model and then you make dumb predictions with that model

02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:52.740
And then test it with Bayesian statistics or any other statistics

02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:54.900
You're still working on a dumb model

02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:58.820
So that happens a lot in neuroscience and I actually got a lot of

02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:02.820
Flack for one of the last bike rides I rode because I did a

02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:08.020
Pretty detailed talk about how they had this experimental data

02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:09.620
And then they made an experimental model

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:15.140
It was so simple and so dumb that using that model to make some statistical

02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:22.180
Estimate of whether or not it had anything to do with their experimental data was just kind of dumb

02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:24.340
Because we know the brain isn't that simple

02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:30.100
So why would you even test if your model recapitulates that we don't believe the brain works like your model

02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:35.380
So why would you test it? And that's why he calls it mindless statistics because

02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:40.100
editors of journals and reviewers of journals like it when you

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:43.860
When you do a statistical test and tell them that a number is significant

02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:47.620
Even if it has nothing to do with testing the hypothesis that they think you're testing

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:55.700
Examples about mindless use sound funny, but there are deep costs of the ritual. I'll give you a few examples

02:45:56.260 --> 02:46:00.340
Maybe the first and quite interesting one is that you actually fear better

02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:05.060
If you don't specify your own hypothesis bingo, why?

02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:08.340
Paul Mille

02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:10.660
Once pointed out

02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:13.940
And messodal logic paradox. Here's a disease. I'm sorry

02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:17.220
Here's where I really want to make a point that's coming to my mind now

02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:18.660
And I want to make it again

02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:22.260
I had made the point earlier that if it's a if you're calling a

02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:24.820
Calling the police on a crime

02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:30.420
Then you don't have to tell people what what the motivation of the criminal is you just have to call and say you need help

02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:35.860
I'm going to give you another example of that kind of scenario where we are being baited

02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:41.620
Into providing an answer that we're not obligated to provide and because we don't want to provide that answer

02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:46.180
We are being told that that means that our objections are irrelevant

02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:50.260
And so if I say that I don't think virology

02:46:51.220 --> 02:46:55.780
Is a field like virology would like you to believe it is then i'm being

02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:59.460
Asked so then what is your explanation for this stuff?

02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:03.940
And I think that that is part of their own trap

02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:09.140
That's the reason why kevin mccurnan was so interested in trying to bait me into explaining

02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:11.860
In more detail what I thought was going on

02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:16.740
Because then I would get into a hamster wheel of explanation and a

02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:22.580
Hypothesis that would never actually be tested and then I would be playing the same bullshit game as them

02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:26.260
When in reality if I tell you that string theory

02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:32.740
In physics as far as i'm concerned doesn't really make any sense and I think these people are just playing mathematical games with you

02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:39.620
I don't really need to be sophisticated enough to give you an alternative explanation for quantum theory

02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:42.100
I

02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:46.580
Just have to point out that lots and lots of other people that are much more much more

02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:52.660
Savvy than I am have also said that string theory is just a gigantic mathematical bullshit story

02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:59.140
And that can't be tested that hasn't been tested and the p values around it are not testing it

02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:04.260
So I don't have to come up with an alternative for a bullshit theory

02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:08.980
Anymore than I have to come up with an alternative for a bullshit theory for irna virology

02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:11.700
and

02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:18.100
I certainly don't think that now I am undermining my credibility by not explaining disease

02:48:18.180 --> 02:48:20.740
Whereas the no virus people have explained disease

02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:26.660
So obviously the no virus people are much more and have much more integrity than jonathan cooey

02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:34.100
Please understand that that is the most obvious ploy of bullshit ever

02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:42.420
We are not under any obligation to replace virology with high fidelity understanding before anybody should take us seriously

02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:48.660
And we are not under any obligation to explain respiratory disease or any other diseases

02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:53.780
If we say that that coronavirus and the pandemic was a lie

02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:58.580
And that is what a lot of these medlers would like us to do

02:48:58.580 --> 02:49:02.340
They want us to spend our time waxing intellectual about what virology is

02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:07.620
Or what exosomes are or whatever these other things are all we got to know is that this

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:13.060
This ritual of mindless statistics has been used to create whole fields

02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:15.700
Has been used to create whole

02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:23.060
Subfields of what the people inside and out of them think our knowledge, but are actually just nonsense

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:32.020
Based on a mindless ritual of applying p values to numbers and then if the p values are right those numbers are significant observations

02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:35.300
And without the mind

02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:42.340
Without a clever scientist with a real idea and a real model of reality that he or she is testing

02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:46.980
Mindless statistical rituals can be used to create phd's

02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:53.380
Or could use to create research lines used to get nature articles used to get tenure

02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:57.620
And these people don't ever need to create knowledge their entire career

02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:00.500
And this guy can teach you how

02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:08.980
Measurement and amount of data make it harder for a theory to pass because you can more easier distinguish between the

02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:11.380
Prediction of the theory and the actual data

02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:14.260
In fields that rely on the

02:50:15.220 --> 02:50:17.220
Knowledge ritual, it's the opposite

02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:20.260
so the

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:24.340
Because it tests a null in which you don't believe

02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:27.540
So improvements of what does he mean by that?

02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:29.540
What does he mean by that?

02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:31.860
Robert Malone

02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:34.740
Was working under the hypothesis

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:42.340
That silicoxib in combination with femotidine would have some effect on covid the disease

02:50:45.380 --> 02:50:49.060
So his null hypothesis is that they don't have any effect on the disease

02:50:49.700 --> 02:50:50.900
And that

02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:56.500
Is actually what he tests when he does a p value he's not testing whether it has any effect on the disease

02:50:56.820 --> 02:50:59.940
He's testing whether it doesn't have any effect on the disease

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:04.500
And if he gets a significant result, then he has disproven

02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:07.140
That it doesn't have any effect

02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:11.620
And the default then is to assume that the effect is due to the drugs

02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:21.780
And if you can see how that's absolutely not testing whether or not it helps people on covid

02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:23.780
But it's testing whether it doesn't

02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:31.940
And if you're testing whether it doesn't and you're basing that on a statistical difference between two groups

02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:39.220
You're not actually testing anything that you believe in because Robert Malone believes that these drugs because of the domain work

02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.660
He's done

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:42.660
Will help with covid

02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:52.260
And so if you're inside of a construct of a pandemic that you know is a biosecurity state operation and a lie

02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:58.260
Then think about how his extraordinary it is how confident he is that he can sustain that lie

02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:03.940
By telling you that he went through this mindless ritual statistics and produced knowledge

02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:09.540
Now do you see why there is no doubt

02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:14.020
It can be no doubt in anyone's mind that Robert Malone is 100 playing for them

02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:20.820
Because he is using the mindless statistical ritual of testing a null hypothesis to demonstrate to you

02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:28.980
That there is a 35 to 37 percent effectiveness of the bullshit combinations that he's testing on behalf of ditra and dod

02:52:29.860 --> 02:52:32.340
And he told that to someone as fraudulent as

02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:34.500
Paul cattrell in

02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:41.220
August of 2021 after he had been on the Brett Wayne steins podcast with steve kirsch a month earlier

02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:46.340
Two months earlier

02:52:47.220 --> 02:52:52.020
At the heart of all of this is the p-value no hypothesis ritual

02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:58.420
At the heart of this is the illusion that academics create knowledge by using this no

02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:01.220
hypothesis p-value ritual

02:53:04.420 --> 02:53:08.020
I can't wait to have girt on our program. It's going to be mind-blowing

02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:12.740
To detect the difference between the data and the no

02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:14.260
Hmm

02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:20.180
And that means more easily reject the null and you can claim victory for your hypothesis

02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:26.740
Let's hear that again. That's another factor that leads to the irrepidability of result

02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:31.140
The only good statistic is Bayesian statistics

02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:33.060
And

02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:36.500
That Bayesian methods are even more automatic

02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:39.300
in his opinion than

02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:41.300
Fisher's brand methods

02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:43.220
So the danger is here

02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:47.380
You don't have much progress if you use base factors just as mindlessly

02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:49.300
That's done

02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:50.980
So let me go on

02:53:50.980 --> 02:53:55.300
The examples about mindless use sound funny, but there are deep costs of the ritual

02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.140
I'll give you a few examples

02:53:57.140 --> 02:54:01.220
Maybe the first and quite interesting one is that you actually fear better

02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:04.260
If you don't specify your own hypothesis

02:54:05.700 --> 02:54:07.140
Why?

02:54:07.140 --> 02:54:09.140
Paul meal

02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:11.460
Once pointed out

02:54:11.460 --> 02:54:12.900
a method a lot to do paradox

02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:19.380
I mean think about this improvement of experimental measurement and amount of data is is harder for the theory

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:25.940
What is Robert Malone testing in his in his thing if there is no SARS-CoV-2

02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:32.420
What is he testing in that?

02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:38.660
Think about how malevolent it is

02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:43.380
Think about how malevolent it is, please

02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:48.980
Once pointed out

02:54:48.980 --> 02:54:50.900
a method a lot to do paradox

02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:51.860
In physics

02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:54.820
improvement of experimental measurement and amount of data

02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:57.300
Make it harder for the theory to pass

02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:03.220
Because it can more easier distinguish between the prediction of the theory and the actual data

02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:04.820
In fields

02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:07.620
This is the problem with virology of course

02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:12.260
That as the resolution of our genetic sequencing capabilities our

02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:18.340
Our genetic manufacturing capabilities our ability to see and isolate single sequences

02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:21.460
Who have like nanopore sequencing and this kind of thing

02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:26.180
Should make it easier for us to raise the level of understanding we have

02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:32.020
In virology, but these people are stuck with methods that are still from the 40s and they're fine with it

02:55:32.580 --> 02:55:40.100
Plaque assays and cytopathic effect assays which the no the no virus people are very right to lambast them about

02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:45.700
Nevermind that they generate p-values from those really dumb methodologies

02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:53.140
That have never been challenged because their hypothesis that they're testing is not the hypothesis of how viruses work

02:55:55.060 --> 02:56:01.060
Their hypothesis is the no hypothesis that they're testing that whatever they're doing in their experiments isn't causing anything

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:04.340
Which is something they don't believe in

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:10.100
So they're not testing their hypothesis their testing eye hypothesis

02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:16.660
They don't believe in and then when they get results they say that that result proves the thing they never tested

02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:24.100
On the uh no ritual it's the opposite

02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:27.460
So the

02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:33.940
Because it tests a null in which you don't believe if there's no covid then uh actually

02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:40.180
Silicoxib and femotidine and ivermectin there's no way to test their effectiveness on it

02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:44.740
You see that right

02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:49.780
And so that's why the illusion of a novel virus that needs novel treatments

02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:53.300
That's killing millions of people that millions more could be saved from that likely came from a

02:56:54.260 --> 02:56:56.500
Laboratory leak and then likely could come again

02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:03.140
That's why that faith is so dangerous and why it's so obviously malevolent that melon is not questioning any of that faith

02:57:03.540 --> 02:57:09.620
Instead fully reinforcing it with an absolute malevolent fraud like paul cottrell

02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:17.620
So improvements of measurement make it more easier

02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:20.660
To detect the difference between the data and the no

02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:28.020
And that means more easily reject the null and you can claim victory for your hypothesis

02:57:28.580 --> 02:57:34.660
And you can just imagine that's another factor that leads to the irrepidability of results

02:57:36.260 --> 02:57:39.380
Second point and then i'll get to the delusions

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:47.780
And about this sacred object the p-value now a p-value is the probability

02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:51.860
of a result or a more extreme one if

02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:58.420
The null hypothesis is correct and more technically correct. It is the probability of a test statistic

02:57:59.460 --> 02:58:01.460
given an entire model

02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:05.860
And but the point is it's a probability of data

02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.620
given our hypothesis not the Bayesian probability

02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:15.220
And that should be easy to understand for any academic research

02:58:15.540 --> 02:58:19.060
Except they don't teach it and also it's not the probability

02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:21.460
that you

02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:23.460
Will be able to replicate it

02:58:24.580 --> 02:58:25.620
And the

02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:31.220
replication you would actually be surprised how many academicicians actually can't annunciate that though

02:58:32.020 --> 02:58:37.620
That p-value is not the odds by which you can replicate it. It's not the odds that you will see it again

02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:39.700
It's nothing like that

02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:45.140
And a lot of people including graduate students in the biomedical sciences would explain it that way in a harpy

02:58:45.220 --> 02:58:50.340
Because they've learned from these shitty statistics books that kind of tell it that way you see the problem

02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.220
Illusion that's the first one

02:58:53.780 --> 02:58:55.140
is

02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:57.300
That when you have a p-value of 1%

02:58:58.020 --> 02:59:03.060
Then logically it follows the probability that you can replicate your result is 99

02:59:04.020 --> 02:59:05.060
Okay

02:59:05.060 --> 02:59:06.180
So

02:59:06.180 --> 02:59:13.300
This illusion has been already told in the book that it break pointed out by none of the it's a great reading

02:59:13.780 --> 02:59:17.220
If you have fun, you want to really have fun read the old textbooks about

02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:22.420
Statistics, they're all not written by statisticians otherwise they wouldn't have been used

02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:25.380
So

02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:28.260
And for instance, none of the writes that's fantastic

02:59:28.980 --> 02:59:36.180
What does a p-value of 5% mean is answered the investigator can be confident with odds of 95 out of 100

02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:40.500
That the observed difference will hold up in further investigation

02:59:41.140 --> 02:59:43.140
Wrong

02:59:43.140 --> 02:59:47.060
Wow, that is so wrong and it's wonderful. They've written this into books

02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:50.180
What is the state today?

02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:55.220
Do academic researchers understand

02:59:56.180 --> 03:00:00.900
What a p-value means so the the the object they are looking for

03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:06.420
So I serve it all studies available here you go in six different countries

03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:12.100
With a total of over 800 academic psychologists and about 1000 students

03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:20.180
And they will all ask what does a p-value of 1% mean? Oh boy. Here we go. How many of these? Oh my gosh

03:00:20.180 --> 03:00:22.180
It's going to break your heart

03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:24.180
Cherries the replica

03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:32.260
So in the sample there were 115 persons who taught statistics

03:00:33.220 --> 03:00:38.820
But you should know that in the social sciences mostly and certainly not in psychology

03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:41.540
Those who teach statistic are not statisticians

03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:44.580
For the same reason because they would notice what's going on

03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:48.180
So what do you think?

03:00:48.580 --> 03:00:53.060
What proportion of 115 statistic teachers that's across six countries

03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:56.100
fall prey to the illusion

03:00:56.740 --> 03:01:00.260
Of breathability should be zero. It is 20 percent. Damn

03:01:01.140 --> 03:01:05.300
Then we have looked at the professors and that's over 700 in this study

03:01:06.180 --> 03:01:09.220
In the professor, it's 39 percent. Hey

03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:14.340
There you go. So the students actually know it better than the professors

03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:22.260
Do you see the professors must understand it in the incorrect way in order to use it correctly

03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:25.220
That

03:01:25.220 --> 03:01:27.220
That's why I failed

03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:32.340
And i'm not saying it in a bad way. I'm just saying that I couldn't get it. I didn't get it

03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:37.220
I didn't understand it and if gert would have been my friend when I was in academic biology

03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:43.860
I might have left earlier or I might have tried harder to do it correctly and then

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:50.500
Found a knee shirt or found a right mentor or made the right choices, but for whatever reason

03:01:51.460 --> 03:01:56.260
Right up until the very end. I was still just playing this game of trying to make measurements

03:01:56.260 --> 03:02:02.020
And seeing if they're significant and then trying to explain that significance in some biologically significant way

03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:04.740
Playing this game

03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:08.340
And once you see it, it's like wow really

03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:16.420
Because I learned a lot. I had a lot of fun. I read a lot of of papers and I thought about a lot of interesting things

03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:19.380
Um, but I've also watched a lot of people

03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:24.980
Create a lot of noise and somewhat participated in it on the sideline

03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:27.700
Maybe I didn't create as much noise as other people were creating

03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:32.340
But I was caught up in the idea of trying to understand how all this noise

03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:38.100
Which at the time I thought was knowledge needed to be incorporated into my understanding of the brain

03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:43.540
And of course when you're incorporating garbage you get garbage out

03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:45.940
And

03:02:45.940 --> 03:02:48.100
So that's where the damage is done, right?

03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:54.660
If you got all these neuroscientists juggling around the idea of how to find p-values for genes that are associated with autism

03:02:54.980 --> 03:03:02.020
And trying to create significant animal models of autism that are only measured in their significance by this mindless ritual

03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:07.860
Then you can understand how billions of dollars could be wasted on animal models that don't recapitulate the disease

03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:13.300
And in experimental models that don't recapitulate the situation or actually test the hypothesis

03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:19.540
Just conveniently produce p-values of significance that can be distorted as testing a

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:28.500
A real hypothesis instead of disproving a no that the review are the that the designer of the experiment never believed in in the first place

03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:33.380
You know like silicoxib and and femotidine have no effect on

03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:38.660
On covid which would be the no hypothesis that robermalone tested

03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:46.020
Capillary illusion the almost double and among the poor students is is 66 percent

03:03:46.580 --> 03:03:48.740
They have inherited the delusion

03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:55.860
And note that this is another reason by the replicability

03:03:56.500 --> 03:04:02.020
Crisis is not being noticed until recently because of this illusion. I have a problem

03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:05.860
It is a p-value of 1 percent. I can be almost sure it can be replicated

03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:09.620
Now it's not the only delusion

03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:14.260
That is shared by the academic researchers

03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:20.100
So the next illusion is that you think that p-value is probably the data given

03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:25.220
A hypothesis tells you about the probability of the hypothesis

03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:30.820
And the maturity of academic

03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:33.300
Psychologists in six countries

03:04:34.100 --> 03:04:36.100
And in every study

03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:37.220
shares

03:04:37.220 --> 03:04:45.060
At least one and typically several of these illusions including the the p-value of 1 percent tells you that the

03:04:46.020 --> 03:04:48.580
Probability that it not happens is true. It's also 1 percent

03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:54.100
Or that the alternative hypothesis is true is 99 percent and so it goes on

03:04:55.620 --> 03:04:57.620
This is a remarkable

03:04:57.940 --> 03:04:59.220
state

03:04:59.220 --> 03:05:00.180
of

03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:02.180
the art of doing science

03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:04.980
Remarkable because everyone of this academic

03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:09.860
Researchers understand the probability of A even B is not the probability of B even A

03:05:10.420 --> 03:05:13.620
But within the ritual thinking is blocked. Yes

03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:20.580
Say it gird. So another blind spot and cost is obviously effect size. There is no effect size in

03:05:21.060 --> 03:05:24.900
The ritual there's an effect of enlightenment prison. Yeah, but that's not being told

03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:30.020
So does everybody understand that if you're a statistic student at all

03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:33.220
You would have heard of effect size and that has to do with okay

03:05:33.220 --> 03:05:40.500
How many numbers are you testing if it's only a difference between five people and five people the power and the the

03:05:40.900 --> 03:05:44.980
The effect size might be smaller than if it's a thousand people and a thousand people

03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:50.980
And the difference between them is x or y and so there is there are these all kinds of other

03:05:51.620 --> 03:05:58.580
Statistical numbers that could be included in the ritual that would in theory give the ritual more resolution

03:05:59.620 --> 03:06:03.780
To distinguish between the result and and randomness

03:06:03.780 --> 03:06:10.580
But instead the ritual contains none of these things that that should have been incorporated from the original theories

03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:13.940
But instead leaves them out almost seemingly on purpose

03:06:16.340 --> 03:06:18.660
Ski and celiac asked a question

03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:24.340
Do economists distinguish between significance?

03:06:25.860 --> 03:06:32.580
And now think about the fact that economy and economics models and finance and financial models

03:06:32.980 --> 03:06:38.420
Have been made to create the illusion of knowledge using the same frickin ritual

03:06:39.460 --> 03:06:43.300
That actually paul cottrell got a phd in finance using the same

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:49.940
p-value ritual and probably didn't even test the hypothesis about chaos or anything like that

03:06:50.580 --> 03:06:54.180
Those statistical significance in economic significance

03:06:55.300 --> 03:07:00.660
And they looked at the papers in the top in one of the top journals the american economic review

03:07:01.300 --> 03:07:05.940
and of 182 papers 70% did not

03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:09.460
Make a distinction

03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:11.780
And what celiac and make loskey did

03:07:12.580 --> 03:07:14.580
They published the names of those

03:07:15.700 --> 03:07:19.620
Who got most confused including a number of no blores hopes

03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:26.020
10 years later they repeated that assuming that everyone must have read that and people are now more

03:07:27.060 --> 03:07:28.260
reasonable

03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:33.620
But the 70% who confused it the number didn't go down. It went up to 82

03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:39.940
Similar there's a blind spot for statistical power. There is no power in the knowledge ritual

03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:44.820
And paul means the probability that you find an effect if there is one

03:07:45.540 --> 03:07:48.420
And that should be 80 percent 90 percent higher

03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:53.140
The psychologist do you understand that there is a there is a

03:07:53.860 --> 03:07:56.740
sort of minimum threshold of samples that you

03:07:57.300 --> 03:08:01.700
Can take in order to have a pretty good chance of seeing a difference

03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:05.940
And if there is very little difference between the groups and you're going to need a lot more numbers

03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:08.420
In order to see it reliably

03:08:08.980 --> 03:08:15.380
Then if for example, there's a giant difference like the difference between my height and the height of all other little kids

03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:21.460
Under the age of four you wouldn't need very many kids under the age of four to get a statistical result

03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:29.300
And the likelihood that you would find a result is very high because the the difference is very big between me and all kids

03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:33.460
But if it was between me and other high school basketball players

03:08:33.940 --> 03:08:37.700
Then although our ages are different our height might be tend to be very much similar

03:08:38.100 --> 03:08:42.420
So in order to see whether there's any difference between me and them you might need a lot more of them

03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:45.620
And that's a very bad example because I I'm a group of one

03:08:46.260 --> 03:08:50.100
But he is trying to teach or trying to cite a very

03:08:50.900 --> 03:08:57.940
broad idea in statistics and show to you that the resolution of a statistical result

03:08:58.900 --> 03:09:03.540
In the null ritual is absolutely positively not the goal

03:09:04.660 --> 03:09:10.740
If the goal was to accurately describe the statistical result, then you would use power

03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:16.180
And you would use effect size to describe the p-value with some

03:09:17.460 --> 03:09:18.980
parameters

03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:25.860
But they're not part of the null hypothesis despite the fact that they were part of the statistical theories from which the null hypothesis

03:09:25.940 --> 03:09:30.740
is purported to be drawn or the testing of the null hypothesis is purported to be drawn

03:09:31.300 --> 03:09:33.300
And it is this illusion

03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:39.940
This this fake mechanism of knowledge creation that has been used malevolently against us

03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:48.820
To create the illusion of RNA viruses the need for for public health and the effectiveness of the vaccine schedule

03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:51.700
These are all very very central

03:09:52.180 --> 03:09:57.620
And they are very very much created protected by and edified by this null ritual

03:09:58.100 --> 03:10:02.740
That gert has now so eloquently shown us is running rampant across all

03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:06.340
Academic fields including economy economics

03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:15.460
Psychology and biomedical sciences including frickin drugs like robert malone just added it just wonderfully explained to paulcatrell

03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:21.460
When was the first one who systematically studied the power of a major clique in travel

03:10:22.260 --> 03:10:27.220
And he found that the average power for a medium effect was

03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:30.260
46 percent

03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:32.660
That wasn't much

03:10:32.660 --> 03:10:34.660
Now petacidlimire and I

03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:37.220
25 years later

03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:43.380
Which should be a time that things change that airplane is in Arizona. Sorry. I can't get rid of that sound

03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:46.900
Looked analyze the power in the same term

03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:53.940
Before it was 46 it went down to 37. Why? Because

03:10:54.900 --> 03:10:58.260
Many researchers noted alpha adjustment which decreases the power

03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:03.140
And

03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:05.540
Notice what that means

03:11:07.220 --> 03:11:08.900
If you

03:11:08.900 --> 03:11:10.900
If you set up an experiment

03:11:11.620 --> 03:11:18.740
That has only a power of say 30 percent to detect the effect if there's one

03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:25.220
You could do better and much more cheaper by throwing a coin

03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:28.260
And you would have a power of 50 percent

03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:31.380
clear

03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:37.540
How extraordinary is that how extraordinary is that the null hypothesis does not involve

03:11:38.260 --> 03:11:39.300
even

03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:46.580
Finding out whether the number of measurements you've made has any real statistical power to find a result if there is one

03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:49.300
They don't even they don't even have to tell you that

03:11:56.180 --> 03:11:58.180
You could spare

03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:00.900
All of this effort

03:12:00.980 --> 03:12:03.620
And what I've told you now are even the better results

03:12:04.340 --> 03:12:06.340
Uh studies in neuroscience

03:12:06.740 --> 03:12:16.900
So for instance studies about Alzheimer's disease genetics gains of biomarkers the median power of more than 700 studies is 21 percent

03:12:21.300 --> 03:12:26.420
Cancer biomarkers genetics you mean like the genetic causes of autism

03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:30.420
You see where i'm going with this ladies and gentlemen

03:12:30.420 --> 03:12:35.540
You see where the broken science initiative is going with this why the broken science initiative is so important

03:12:36.100 --> 03:12:39.380
That malcom kendrick the placebo master

03:12:39.940 --> 03:12:47.620
And the statin sky is in the same room as gert giga renzer is in the same room as the guy who runs giga home biological

03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:54.580
Is in the same room as the guy who invented crossfit is in the same room as matt brigs is in the same room

03:12:55.220 --> 03:12:57.220
Um

03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:07.220
Bringing these people together and trying to find an organized way to start to spread these knowledge this knowledge spread these ideas

03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:08.660
and to

03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:16.580
Slowly dismantle the mythology that has been created using these ideas is of utmost importance to our children

03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:19.140
I

03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:24.820
Want to watch the rest of this but I don't have time and my back is absolutely murdering me right now

03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:29.140
And i'm going to pull the trigger and say or pull the ripcord right now and I apologize for that

03:13:29.140 --> 03:13:31.140
I will watch the rest of this

03:13:31.140 --> 03:13:38.020
Maybe maybe we'll watch the rest of it tomorrow. I do think that I I put extra stuff in here with the paul control video

03:13:38.420 --> 03:13:40.420
And so it makes it a little harder

03:13:40.740 --> 03:13:42.740
um to to

03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:46.100
To

03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:48.100
But just don't forget

03:13:48.100 --> 03:13:51.060
This is our hypothesis ladies and gentlemen. It's not going to change

03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:53.300
um

03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:55.300
And uh, this was gert giga renzer

03:13:55.780 --> 03:14:01.460
Um mindless statistics the broken science initiative you can find this full video on youtube

03:14:01.460 --> 03:14:04.100
You can also find it on the broken science initiative website

03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:08.260
It would be great if you guys would go to the broken science initiative website and make a

03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:12.580
Make a member, you know, just join and and and make a username

03:14:13.060 --> 03:14:14.980
um, so that

03:14:14.980 --> 03:14:20.100
You know that that emily can see that i'm pushing people there and drawing attention to their work

03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:21.940
There's lots of other videos there

03:14:22.580 --> 03:14:27.380
Including videos by malcom kendrick who's one of the more entertaining people to talk about this kind of stuff

03:14:27.780 --> 03:14:31.060
And malcom is also going to be on our show in the next couple of weeks. I think

03:14:31.460 --> 03:14:33.700
Um, so just looking forward

03:14:34.340 --> 03:14:36.340
Seeing the progress. I hope you can see it too

03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:41.700
Broken science initiative is really the way that gigo and biological is going to get off of this

03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:44.340
this uh covid

03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:46.500
Dissident narrative

03:14:46.500 --> 03:14:48.260
breaking and uh

03:14:48.260 --> 03:14:50.900
And and move on to bigger and better things during the week

03:14:51.300 --> 03:14:54.900
And then maybe only once a week we have to revisit some of these posers

03:14:55.380 --> 03:15:01.620
And the um, mythologies that they are still perpetuating on social media remember don't take their bait on tv

03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:07.300
Remember, um, stay focused on the biology and remember that uh, you got to love your neighbors

03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:10.580
Um, I love you all very much ladies and gentlemen. See you again soon

03:15:14.340 --> 03:15:16.340
So

03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:26.900
Thomas koon and feribend are also guys that are featured

03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:34.660
Actually in one of my favorite books that i'm reading for the second time already and that's this one pauper and after written by

03:15:35.380 --> 03:15:36.420
David stove

03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:41.380
So this is a book actually that the broken science initiative now owns the rights too

03:15:41.380 --> 03:15:45.540
And so I think on the broken science initiative website. You can actually get a pdf of this book

03:15:45.940 --> 03:15:47.380
It's really thin

03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:53.860
And it's really easy and it's the only basis for which I understand any of this stuff that gert and other people are talking about

03:15:54.260 --> 03:15:59.220
I'm now breaking into trying to read matt, uh, Briggs's book. I'm about randomness

03:15:59.300 --> 03:16:00.260
Um

03:16:00.260 --> 03:16:05.700
But uh, this is the one that's helped me get to the stage where I can at least have a conversation with these some of these people

03:16:05.700 --> 03:16:09.460
And know what they're talking about and so don't ever think that i'm an expert

03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:14.580
We're just doing it together at best. I'm a tutor. Um, and a biologist. It's read a few more

03:16:15.380 --> 03:16:21.380
Hours than you have on some of these topics and that's it. Otherwise, I'm just uh, a

03:16:22.340 --> 03:16:27.620
imperfect husband and an imperfect papa and I love you all very much and thanks very much for your support

03:16:27.620 --> 03:16:29.620
I'll see you again soon
