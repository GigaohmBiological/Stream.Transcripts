WEBVTT

02:49.520 --> 02:52.020
for 16 minutes next.

02:52.020 --> 02:58.120
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.520
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
It's embarrassing.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.020
Hey, listen to this gang.

03:11.020 --> 03:14.320
Teenage sleuth, solved boat hijacking mystery.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.820
Captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sheriff.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.320
That was some plan they had.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.320
First spreading the phony story about Cutler,

03:23.320 --> 03:26.320
and then stealing the yachts from the marina.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.820
That night on the beach, Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks

03:29.820 --> 03:31.320
in the graveyard of the ship.

03:31.320 --> 03:36.820
Yeah, but like his diving suit got covered with that kooky-glowing seaweed.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.820
And that's where the glowing ghost story came from.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.820
Well, that cold is the mystery.

03:48.820 --> 03:52.320
How did Scooby do with that?

03:52.320 --> 03:55.320
I guess that's another mystery.

04:18.820 --> 04:23.820
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.820
From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, this is Gago on Biological.

04:29.820 --> 04:32.820
I'm going to do something a little bit sneaky tonight.

04:35.820 --> 04:36.820
Oops, that was a little quick.

04:36.820 --> 04:44.820
We are going to look at the spectrum of debate that was allowed in 2019

04:45.820 --> 04:54.320
by looking at a highly produced example of this business in 2019,

04:54.320 --> 04:58.820
and how this narrative was being laid down and prepared for us in our brain.

05:01.820 --> 05:07.820
I see you guys mentioning in the chat the CHD interview I did with Dr. Brian Hooker.

05:07.820 --> 05:11.820
It was a really good interview, but on the live recording or the live release,

05:11.820 --> 05:14.820
rather, the sound cutouts, they had to re-render the movie.

05:14.820 --> 05:20.820
The link is now there again, but for the time when it was supposed to be there,

05:20.820 --> 05:22.820
it actually wasn't there.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.820
And so that was a little bit disappointing at some moment.

05:26.820 --> 05:31.820
I was getting really excited about what I was saying, and then the sound went out.

05:31.820 --> 05:36.820
And so they cut the live stream, and then they re-edited the video, and now it's available.

05:36.820 --> 05:40.820
And I think the video or the interview is at least okay.

05:42.820 --> 05:46.820
And so I'm going to watch it at some point, I think, just to make sure that I didn't make any crazy mistakes

05:46.820 --> 05:49.820
other than the DC sign nonsense that I did there.

05:50.820 --> 05:51.820
Welcome to the show.

05:51.820 --> 05:54.820
This is Giga Home Biological Eye Resistance Low Noise Information Stream,

05:54.820 --> 05:56.820
brought to you by a biologist.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.820
The biologist is Jonathan Cooey.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.820
I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.820
I have three kids and a lovely wife.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.820
And most things are pretty good here.

06:07.820 --> 06:15.820
We are blessed to be, I'm blessed to be a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense.

06:16.820 --> 06:26.820
But in this program, and on this program, I speak for myself and for my little LLC called Giga Home Biological Run Out of My Garage.

06:27.820 --> 06:32.820
That being said, all the names that are scrolling above my head here in one way or another

06:32.820 --> 06:34.820
are financially supporting me.

06:35.820 --> 06:43.820
Some of them have been my financial supporters for several years and are responsible for that time between 2021 and 2022

06:44.820 --> 06:46.820
when I had nobody else but them.

06:47.820 --> 06:52.820
So, I don't know what to say other than thank all of you very, very much.

06:52.820 --> 06:59.820
And thank you for giving me to the point where I can give out such a succinct message as intramuscular injection

07:00.820 --> 07:02.820
is not a valid means of immunization.

07:02.820 --> 07:03.820
It's really, really nice.

07:04.820 --> 07:09.820
If you need something more specific for COVID, just say the transfection is not immunization.

07:15.820 --> 07:17.820
Oh yeah, so I wanted to plug this.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.820
I'm not sure why I should have probably put some text here.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.820
I don't know what I was thinking I was going to accomplish with this slide here.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.820
And then not to put my head here either.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.820
This is a video, this is kind of neat.

07:29.820 --> 07:35.820
It's like a little, this is a video clip or a screenshot from Mr. Eden,

07:36.820 --> 07:40.820
AKA Mr. Sparkle on September 8th, 2023.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.820
It's one of my most important streams in the last month.

07:45.820 --> 07:52.820
And if you're new to the channel or you haven't watched a lot of the stuff that I've done in the last couple of weeks,

07:53.820 --> 07:54.820
there's a lot of videos to choose from.

07:55.820 --> 07:57.820
And I suggest you go to this one first.

07:58.820 --> 08:04.820
Not only because of how succinct and on message Mike Eden is,

08:06.820 --> 08:12.820
but how I think I tie it up real nice and make sure that it's understandable

08:13.820 --> 08:18.820
and why it's so important to think about how Steve Kirsch and other people

08:19.820 --> 08:24.820
through maybe no fault of their own, but maybe some fault of their own.

08:24.820 --> 08:29.820
Wittingly or unwittingly have changed the way that we think over the last few years.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.820
And specifically, some of these people really stepped in to make sure

08:34.820 --> 08:36.820
that we changed the way we think about certain things.

08:37.820 --> 08:40.820
And that being that there's a novel virus, we had to do something

08:41.820 --> 08:43.820
and that mRNA might be handy, you know, if it was done right.

08:44.820 --> 08:49.820
And gain of function is a real danger from which this virus may have originated.

08:50.820 --> 08:58.820
And so this faith was instituted in people en masse through the TV and through social media.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.820
And it was done by changing their mind about fundamentals in biology

09:03.820 --> 09:09.820
that up until 2019 were pretty solid ground in terms of our understanding

09:09.820 --> 09:12.820
and our admitted lack of understanding.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.820
But instead they changed our way, the way we think about these things.

09:17.820 --> 09:26.820
And then doctors were duped into, pressured into, or dumb enough to take part in,

09:27.820 --> 09:31.820
protocol changes which ended up killing hundreds of thousands of people

09:32.820 --> 09:36.820
and really just muddying the water in terms of where is this novel entity

09:37.820 --> 09:40.820
for which we purport to be able to test with a PCR exam,

09:40.820 --> 09:45.820
but also not if the symptoms are there and we can just make that assumption.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.820
And then we used a bunch of things that would have otherwise been called poisons

09:49.820 --> 09:55.820
had they been through the real normal testing procedure of drugs and therapeutics

09:56.820 --> 09:58.820
like Remdesivir, for example.

10:01.820 --> 10:04.820
And I believe, and I've been trying to explain this for many weeks now,

10:05.820 --> 10:10.820
that I believe that it is very likely that an orchestrated effort

10:12.820 --> 10:16.820
by government entities, intelligence agencies, I don't know who,

10:18.820 --> 10:23.820
but a large network of individuals and people with like-minded interests

10:24.820 --> 10:29.820
have carefully crafted this narrative of a pandemic

10:30.820 --> 10:34.820
so that they can position themselves to be in positions of power in perpetuity

10:35.820 --> 10:38.820
and these positions of power that they have assumed

10:39.820 --> 10:42.820
are all based on the idea of this pandemic potential.

10:45.820 --> 10:48.820
And so you have to believe in the pandemic potential

10:48.820 --> 10:51.820
and more importantly you have to believe in the idea that there are bad guys

10:52.820 --> 10:56.820
who flaunted Mother Nature's laws

10:57.820 --> 10:59.820
and who flaunted Mother Nature's possibilities

11:00.820 --> 11:02.820
and created a virus that otherwise wouldn't exist

11:03.820 --> 11:05.820
and it got out and it injured millions of people.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.820
And so you've got to believe that there's a mystery to solve,

11:10.820 --> 11:12.820
that there are bad guys to identify and people to punish.

11:14.820 --> 11:16.820
And there are bad guys to identify and people to punish,

11:17.820 --> 11:21.820
but the question is what do you, what crime do you accuse them of committing?

11:22.820 --> 11:26.820
And what they want you to do is accuse a very few people,

11:27.820 --> 11:32.820
maybe two or three people of shuffling money around in backrooms

11:33.820 --> 11:37.820
and of combining molecular parts of a virus in a laboratory

11:37.820 --> 11:40.820
in an irresponsible way that led to the pandemic.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.820
That's what they want you to believe happened

11:44.820 --> 11:48.820
so that the real fake monster of the story is never unmasked

11:49.820 --> 11:53.820
and that fake monster is an RNA viral pandemic.

11:54.820 --> 11:55.820
That monster can't exist,

11:56.820 --> 11:59.820
but they have created a scenario with real data,

12:00.820 --> 12:03.820
real biology or what appears to be real biology

12:04.820 --> 12:05.820
and real confusion

12:06.820 --> 12:08.820
and effectively created a pandemic

12:09.820 --> 12:11.820
not that dissimilar to what Dr. Giordano has described

12:12.820 --> 12:14.820
many times in the past on my stream.

12:15.820 --> 12:18.820
And so they lied to us over several decades

12:18.820 --> 12:20.820
about the pandemic potential found in caves

12:21.820 --> 12:24.820
and how it can be accessed in cell culture and aminal passage.

12:24.820 --> 12:28.820
And more recently they've lied to us about how viral particles can be

12:29.820 --> 12:32.820
stitched together or viral genomes can be stitched together

12:33.820 --> 12:37.820
to also yield pandemic potential heretofore, undescribed.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.820
And they want you to believe this pandemic potential

12:40.820 --> 12:41.820
is almost never ending

12:42.820 --> 12:45.820
so that they can invert your sovereignty over your body

12:45.820 --> 12:49.820
and your children to something more of a social debt

12:49.820 --> 12:51.820
that you owe to society

12:51.820 --> 12:54.820
and therefore permissions that you have to earn.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.820
And I believe that many of these people

12:59.820 --> 13:02.820
wittingly or unwittingly have been co-opted

13:02.820 --> 13:05.820
into perpetuating this myth of gain of function viruses

13:05.820 --> 13:09.820
and co-opted into perpetuating this myth of a novel virus

13:09.820 --> 13:11.820
which circulated the globe for three years

13:11.820 --> 13:14.820
and is still ever evolving.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.820
And whether these people really believe what they say or not

13:18.820 --> 13:20.820
is kind of irrelevant

13:21.820 --> 13:24.820
because they won't discuss aspects of the biology

13:24.820 --> 13:26.820
which would otherwise probably set them free

13:27.820 --> 13:29.820
from the certainty that they are under right now.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.820
And they are under a spell of certainty

13:32.820 --> 13:34.820
all of the people in the red triangle

13:35.820 --> 13:38.820
because all of them are under the spell of certainty

13:38.820 --> 13:43.820
that a novel virus most definitely was not present in 2018

13:44.820 --> 13:46.820
became present in 2019

13:47.820 --> 13:51.820
and then nearly destroyed the global economy in 2020.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
They all believe that we had to do something.

13:54.820 --> 13:57.820
They all believe that maybe even a large proportion

13:57.820 --> 13:59.820
of the people that have taken the mRNA

13:59.820 --> 14:01.820
gained some short-term benefit.

14:02.820 --> 14:06.820
And for sure all the people on, sorry, on this side

14:06.820 --> 14:11.820
of the red triangle, they all believe that a gain of function virus is possible

14:12.820 --> 14:15.820
and it's dangerous and they're doing it.

14:16.820 --> 14:17.820
It's just that the people down here

14:17.820 --> 14:19.820
don't believe that this virus was one of those.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.820
They definitely exist.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.820
It's just that this wasn't a gain of function virus

14:24.820 --> 14:28.820
whereas these people up here think it was a gain of function virus.

14:29.820 --> 14:33.820
The kooky thing is is that the moment you question

14:33.820 --> 14:38.820
the veracity of the story of an RNA virus being able to perpetuate itself

14:38.820 --> 14:42.820
for three years through millions and millions and millions of serial cases.

14:43.820 --> 14:46.820
You get put into this yellow zone over here

14:46.820 --> 14:49.820
and you no longer get any attention on social media.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.820
You get everything actually silenced

14:53.820 --> 14:55.820
not canceled where everybody talks about you

14:56.820 --> 14:59.820
and promotes you and shares your story on sub-stack

15:00.820 --> 15:02.820
and sends people to Mexico to look for you

15:03.820 --> 15:05.820
but canceled in the sense of

15:05.820 --> 15:07.820
nobody hears from you anymore.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.820
Nobody can see your account.

15:14.820 --> 15:21.820
Your Twitch followers stagnate at 2,700 for like a year straight.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.820
That's what we're talking about here when we say canceled.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.820
Not canceled like it promoted

15:28.820 --> 15:30.820
under two more platforms.

15:31.820 --> 15:36.820
Not canceled like oh I get to whine about it forever to my millions of followers.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.820
We're talking about actually erased

15:41.820 --> 15:44.820
where people don't ever acknowledge that you exist

15:45.820 --> 15:48.820
because that's where all the people in the yellow are here.

15:49.820 --> 15:50.820
No one talks about Mikey.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.820
No one talks about Wolfgang Woda.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.820
No one talks about Nick Hudson

15:57.820 --> 16:00.820
and very few people are willing to talk about Denny Ranglu.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.820
You know even Sukhrin Bhakti

16:05.820 --> 16:07.820
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.820
are virtually off limits for mentioning them

16:10.820 --> 16:13.820
even though Bobby is largely on gain a function narrative

16:13.820 --> 16:14.820
Sukhrin's not

16:15.820 --> 16:19.820
but Sukhrin also is not doubting the spread of a virus

16:19.820 --> 16:21.820
but no one's really shown him Jessica Hakka's data.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.820
No one's shown Bobby

16:25.820 --> 16:26.820
Jessica Hakka's data.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.820
And so I think because I put Bobby on that line

16:30.820 --> 16:33.820
because he at least had Denny Rancor on his podcast

16:33.820 --> 16:34.820
and listened to Denny

16:34.820 --> 16:36.820
and pushed back hard on Denny.

16:41.820 --> 16:43.820
And so this spectrum of debate

16:43.820 --> 16:46.820
which we have been captured by this mystery

16:46.820 --> 16:50.820
the Scooby-Doo mystery that we've been fooled into

16:50.820 --> 16:54.820
investing our energies into solving

16:54.820 --> 16:56.820
this Scooby-Doo mystery

16:56.820 --> 16:59.820
that we've invested ourselves in solving

16:59.820 --> 17:02.820
and the purported people that are helping us solve it

17:02.820 --> 17:07.820
are actually all people who are involved in making sure

17:07.820 --> 17:11.820
that we think when we successfully solve this

17:11.820 --> 17:12.820
that we understand

17:13.820 --> 17:16.820
and the goal of Paul Catrell

17:16.820 --> 17:17.820
and Robert Malone

17:17.820 --> 17:20.820
who we saw did a stream together in 2021

17:20.820 --> 17:23.820
Robert Malone doesn't waste his time with clowns

17:24.820 --> 17:26.820
why in the world would he waste his time

17:26.820 --> 17:28.820
with Dr. Paul Catrell

17:29.820 --> 17:31.820
Paul Catrell must be legit

17:31.820 --> 17:34.820
if Robert Malone took the time to stream with him

17:34.820 --> 17:36.820
took the time to stream with him

17:36.820 --> 17:39.820
and explain the dexamethasone would be a great way

17:39.820 --> 17:41.820
to increase the number of deaths

17:41.820 --> 17:43.820
because it just crushes

17:43.820 --> 17:45.820
COVID patients

17:45.820 --> 17:48.820
so a great way to make the numbers worse

17:48.820 --> 17:51.820
and Remdesivir is not as effective as everybody thought it was

17:51.820 --> 17:54.820
but that's a rabbit hole he didn't want to talk about

17:54.820 --> 17:58.820
honest he said those things on a stream with Paul Catrell

17:58.820 --> 18:01.820
basically saying that the

18:01.820 --> 18:03.820
that the protocols were

18:03.820 --> 18:05.820
being used to greatly inflate the numbers

18:05.820 --> 18:07.820
and the deadliness of the virus

18:07.820 --> 18:10.820
the severity of the disease

18:10.820 --> 18:13.820
he said that with Paul Catrell

18:13.820 --> 18:17.820
on a stream in August of 2021

18:17.820 --> 18:21.820
as part of this crafting of this narrative

18:21.820 --> 18:23.820
on all parts and all sides

18:23.820 --> 18:27.820
mainstream media, Fox News

18:27.820 --> 18:30.820
conservative media

18:30.820 --> 18:32.820
everywhere

18:32.820 --> 18:35.820
even on fringe

18:35.820 --> 18:39.820
not so important podcasts like

18:39.820 --> 18:41.820
Paul Catrells

18:42.820 --> 18:44.820
you can't discount that

18:44.820 --> 18:47.820
that's a very significant

18:47.820 --> 18:49.820
data point if remember

18:49.820 --> 18:51.820
Robert Malone's

18:51.820 --> 18:53.820
cyberstalker list

18:53.820 --> 18:55.820
included a guy by the name of

18:55.820 --> 18:57.820
George Webb

18:57.820 --> 18:59.820
and it included a link to George Webb's

18:59.820 --> 19:01.820
60 minutes program

19:01.820 --> 19:03.820
George Webb over here

19:03.820 --> 19:07.820
considers Paul Catrell to be his

19:07.820 --> 19:09.820
his best scientific advisor

19:09.820 --> 19:11.820
Robert Malone was on a stream

19:11.820 --> 19:13.820
with Paul Catrell in 2021

19:13.820 --> 19:17.820
Robert Malone says that

19:17.820 --> 19:19.820
George Webb is his worst

19:19.820 --> 19:21.820
one of his worst cyberstalkers

19:21.820 --> 19:25.820
it's a controlled

19:25.820 --> 19:29.820
dance of performers

19:29.820 --> 19:31.820
that all make noises in the dark

19:31.820 --> 19:33.820
at different times and so we're all

19:33.820 --> 19:35.820
looking over here and looking over there

19:35.820 --> 19:37.820
and it turns out that they're all

19:37.820 --> 19:39.820
on each other's webpage

19:39.820 --> 19:41.820
they're all on each other's podcasts

19:41.820 --> 19:43.820
they all have each other

19:43.820 --> 19:45.820
in their phone book

19:45.820 --> 19:47.820
they're all sharing my phone number

19:47.820 --> 19:49.820
with

19:49.820 --> 19:51.820
with Bobby

19:51.820 --> 19:53.820
I don't know who's making all these

19:53.820 --> 19:55.820
phone calls in the background

19:55.820 --> 19:57.820
I got a phone call from Bobby

19:57.820 --> 19:59.820
but apparently there were phone calls

19:59.820 --> 20:01.820
from Malone to Rixie and Rixie to Malone

20:01.820 --> 20:03.820
and Paul Catrell and Robert Malone

20:03.820 --> 20:05.820
apparently have phone numbers

20:05.820 --> 20:07.820
right otherwise how would they be on

20:07.820 --> 20:09.820
a podcast in 2021

20:09.820 --> 20:11.820
I mean

20:11.820 --> 20:13.820
this is a whole network of people

20:13.820 --> 20:15.820
who's all been pushing

20:15.820 --> 20:17.820
this worst-case scenario

20:17.820 --> 20:19.820
from the inside and the outside

20:19.820 --> 20:21.820
I mean while Robert Malone

20:21.820 --> 20:23.820
was trying to get EUAs for five

20:23.820 --> 20:25.820
different drugs with

20:25.820 --> 20:27.820
in contact with what did he say to Paul

20:27.820 --> 20:29.820
he was in contact with Steve Kirsch

20:29.820 --> 20:31.820
almost hourly

20:31.820 --> 20:33.820
while they were doing that

20:33.820 --> 20:35.820
in 2020

20:35.820 --> 20:37.820
Paul was on the internet

20:37.820 --> 20:39.820
pushing the worst-case scenario

20:39.820 --> 20:41.820
talking to people from Taiwan

20:41.820 --> 20:43.820
who were telling him that the only thing that was working in Taiwan

20:43.820 --> 20:45.820
was Remdesivir

20:47.820 --> 20:49.820
and then he talks to Robert Malone

20:49.820 --> 20:51.820
and Robert Malone says that Remdesivir

20:51.820 --> 20:53.820
isn't really working as well

20:53.820 --> 20:55.820
as everybody thought and that doesn't strike

20:55.820 --> 20:57.820
Paul Catrell as odd

20:57.820 --> 20:59.820
because he heard earlier

20:59.820 --> 21:01.820
than anyone else

21:01.820 --> 21:03.820
there were millions of people who were going to die

21:03.820 --> 21:05.820
from some CDC leak

21:05.820 --> 21:07.820
and then he also got a phone call from Taiwan

21:07.820 --> 21:09.820
from some lady

21:09.820 --> 21:11.820
saying that the only thing that was working in Hong Kong

21:11.820 --> 21:13.820
was Remdesivir

21:13.820 --> 21:15.820
it's a great big show

21:15.820 --> 21:17.820
ladies and gentlemen

21:17.820 --> 21:19.820
and the show started in 2019

21:21.820 --> 21:23.820
the show started

21:23.820 --> 21:25.820
in 2019

21:31.820 --> 21:35.820
the show started in 2019

21:35.820 --> 21:39.820
check this out

21:39.820 --> 21:41.820
now I can't show you the very very start

21:41.820 --> 21:43.820
because it's got this red N

21:43.820 --> 21:47.820
and then it makes this sound good

21:47.820 --> 21:49.820
okay so you just imagine

21:49.820 --> 21:51.820
the red N

21:51.820 --> 21:53.820
and then something something

21:53.820 --> 21:55.820
and then here we'll start it

21:57.820 --> 21:59.820
let's imagine for a second

21:59.820 --> 22:01.820
all the ways the world could end

22:01.820 --> 22:03.820
it could be something

22:03.820 --> 22:05.820
from above

22:05.820 --> 22:07.820
or something from below

22:09.820 --> 22:11.820
or it could be something we did

22:11.820 --> 22:13.820
to ourselves

22:13.820 --> 22:15.820
but there's one thing that consistently ranks

22:15.820 --> 22:17.820
as one of the most likely things

22:17.820 --> 22:19.820
to end the world

22:19.820 --> 22:21.820
well if you think of anything that could come along

22:21.820 --> 22:23.820
that would kill millions of people

22:23.820 --> 22:25.820
the pandemic is our greatest risk

22:25.820 --> 22:27.820
a pandemic is a disease

22:27.820 --> 22:29.820
our control

22:29.820 --> 22:31.820
sweeping across the world

22:31.820 --> 22:33.820
killing millions and changing civilizations

22:33.820 --> 22:35.820
we know this because we've seen it before

22:35.820 --> 22:37.820
a few times

22:37.820 --> 22:39.820
in the sixth century

22:39.820 --> 22:41.820
a pandemic killed half the world's population

22:41.820 --> 22:43.820
in the 14th another wiped out

22:43.820 --> 22:45.820
half of Europe

22:45.820 --> 22:47.820
and in the 20th a pandemic killed

22:47.820 --> 22:49.820
almost 5% of the world's population

22:49.820 --> 22:51.820
in just two years

22:51.820 --> 22:53.820
but that was a hundred years ago

22:53.820 --> 22:55.820
we've learned from these past

22:55.820 --> 22:57.820
pandemics and made incredible advances

22:57.820 --> 22:59.820
improved response

22:59.820 --> 23:01.820
improved training

23:01.820 --> 23:03.820
improved workforce

23:03.820 --> 23:05.820
we have improved surveillance systems

23:05.820 --> 23:07.820
improved communications

23:07.820 --> 23:09.820
we have organizations like the world health organization

23:09.820 --> 23:11.820
CDC we have improved diagnostics

23:11.820 --> 23:13.820
improved drugs

23:13.820 --> 23:15.820
therapeutics vaccines

23:15.820 --> 23:17.820
and yet the risk of it happening again

23:17.820 --> 23:19.820
has never been higher

23:19.820 --> 23:21.820
we've done the math on this

23:21.820 --> 23:23.820
we estimate there about five new emerging diseases

23:23.820 --> 23:25.820
happen somewhere on the planet every year

23:25.820 --> 23:27.820
and that rate is accelerated so it is inevitable

23:27.820 --> 23:29.820
that they will become pandemics

23:29.820 --> 23:31.820
mother nature is the ultimate bioterrorist

23:31.820 --> 23:33.820
nice

23:33.820 --> 23:35.820
mistakes couldn't be higher

23:35.820 --> 23:37.820
this simulation estimates that a pandemic today

23:37.820 --> 23:39.820
could kill 33 million people

23:39.820 --> 23:41.820
one billion

23:41.820 --> 23:43.820
months in terms of

23:43.820 --> 23:45.820
one billion a pandemic

23:45.820 --> 23:47.820
would rival even the gigantic wars of the past

23:47.820 --> 23:49.820
there we go

23:49.820 --> 23:51.820
the economy will shut down

23:51.820 --> 23:53.820
the cost to humanity will be unbelievable

23:53.820 --> 23:55.820
unbelievable when is this

23:55.820 --> 23:57.820
this is in 2019

23:57.820 --> 23:59.820
ladies and gentlemen

23:59.820 --> 24:01.820
were they preparing anybody for anything

24:01.820 --> 24:03.820
do you think

24:03.820 --> 24:05.820
I mean if you see it now

24:05.820 --> 24:07.820
and you see it from 2023

24:07.820 --> 24:09.820
it's called explained

24:09.820 --> 24:11.820
and it's the next pandemic

24:11.820 --> 24:13.820
I mean are you shitting me

24:13.820 --> 24:17.820
country will be immune from the problem

24:17.820 --> 24:19.820
this will create

24:19.820 --> 24:21.820
the question is not is the next pandemic coming

24:21.820 --> 24:23.820
there are only three things

24:23.820 --> 24:25.820
that are inevitable in this world

24:25.820 --> 24:27.820
death taxes and flu pandemics

24:27.820 --> 24:29.820
or when is the next pandemic coming

24:29.820 --> 24:31.820
we estimate there around one and a half million

24:31.820 --> 24:33.820
viruses in wildlife

24:33.820 --> 24:35.820
that we don't yet know that

24:35.820 --> 24:37.820
any one of those could be spilling over into

24:37.820 --> 24:39.820
human population right now

24:39.820 --> 24:41.820
the question is

24:41.820 --> 24:43.820
will we be ready for it

24:43.820 --> 24:45.820
influenza pandemics must be taken seriously

24:45.820 --> 24:47.820
the world is fighting the worst Ebola epidemic

24:47.820 --> 24:49.820
in history

24:49.820 --> 24:51.820
mistakes could be any higher bars

24:51.820 --> 24:53.820
can be just as destructive as a bomb

24:53.820 --> 24:55.820
or a mr. Panogenic organism

24:55.820 --> 24:57.820
Vox I mean Vox

24:57.820 --> 24:59.820
you know already what this is right

24:59.820 --> 25:01.820
it's propaganda but still you got to see it

25:01.820 --> 25:03.820
because that's what they did to us

25:03.820 --> 25:05.820
everybody that saw this was

25:05.820 --> 25:07.820
was primed

25:07.820 --> 25:09.820
maybe Brett Weinstein saw this

25:09.820 --> 25:11.820
and that's the reason why he got a bandana

25:11.820 --> 25:13.820
right away and locked down for nine months

25:13.820 --> 25:15.820
no what the future is going to hold

25:15.820 --> 25:19.820
pandemics begin in a world

25:19.820 --> 25:21.820
invisible to the naked eye

25:21.820 --> 25:23.820
microbes were likely the first

25:23.820 --> 25:25.820
living things on earth

25:25.820 --> 25:27.820
many can't replicate on their own

25:27.820 --> 25:29.820
so they hijack other living cells

25:29.820 --> 25:31.820
and today they're all around us

25:31.820 --> 25:33.820
and on us

25:33.820 --> 25:35.820
and in us

25:35.820 --> 25:37.820
many arrive in peace but others

25:37.820 --> 25:39.820
damage or kill our bodies cells

25:39.820 --> 25:43.820
fever coughing sneezing diarrhea

25:43.820 --> 25:45.820
that's our body fighting back

25:45.820 --> 25:47.820
but some are so strong

25:47.820 --> 25:49.820
they can overwhelm our immune system

25:49.820 --> 25:51.820
and kill us

25:51.820 --> 25:53.820
pandemics are mainly caused by

25:53.820 --> 25:55.820
two types of microbes

25:55.820 --> 25:57.820
bacteria and viruses

25:57.820 --> 25:59.820
the interesting thing about viruses is they are

25:59.820 --> 26:01.820
supremely adapted

26:01.820 --> 26:03.820
to jump from one species to another

26:03.820 --> 26:05.820
they're the most likely microbes

26:05.820 --> 26:07.820
to become the next pandemic

26:07.820 --> 26:09.820
as you can probably guess viruses

26:09.820 --> 26:11.820
that cause bird flu come from birds

26:11.820 --> 26:13.820
swine flu comes from pigs

26:13.820 --> 26:15.820
HIV came from chimpanzees

26:15.820 --> 26:17.820
Ebola likely comes from bats

26:17.820 --> 26:21.820
and several diseases come from mosquitoes

26:21.820 --> 26:23.820
when these spill over to humans

26:23.820 --> 26:25.820
the new virus is called a zoonotic virus

26:25.820 --> 26:27.820
and they're extremely dangerous

26:27.820 --> 26:31.820
these are viruses which mutate rapidly

26:31.820 --> 26:33.820
and therefore change the surface

26:33.820 --> 26:35.820
and evade immune responses quickly

26:35.820 --> 26:37.820
they can transform into a new virus

26:37.820 --> 26:39.820
once they get into the human population

26:39.820 --> 26:41.820
now those don't happen

26:41.820 --> 26:43.820
all the time they're quite rare events

26:43.820 --> 26:45.820
but when they do the effects

26:45.820 --> 26:47.820
can be devastating

26:47.820 --> 26:49.820
which brings us to a farm in Kansas

26:49.820 --> 26:51.820
a century ago

26:51.820 --> 26:53.820
experts aren't certain but they believe

26:53.820 --> 26:55.820
the 1918 flu pandemic could have started

26:55.820 --> 26:57.820
when an infected bird and an infected human

26:57.820 --> 26:59.820
met the same pig

26:59.820 --> 27:01.820
the bird had bird flu

27:01.820 --> 27:03.820
a type of influenza virus that had been

27:03.820 --> 27:05.820
infecting chickens, geese and ducks

27:05.820 --> 27:07.820
for at least a hundred years

27:07.820 --> 27:09.820
while the person had a different influenza strain

27:09.820 --> 27:11.820
the seasonal flu that had made

27:11.820 --> 27:13.820
humans feel stuffed up and feverish

27:13.820 --> 27:15.820
for centuries

27:15.820 --> 27:17.820
the two viruses couldn't infect each other's species

27:17.820 --> 27:19.820
but they could both infect pigs

27:19.820 --> 27:21.820
and in one pig cell

27:21.820 --> 27:23.820
those two viruses combined

27:23.820 --> 27:25.820
creating a new zoonotic virus

27:25.820 --> 27:27.820
H1N1

27:27.820 --> 27:29.820
these parts from the human virus

27:29.820 --> 27:31.820
gave it the ability to infect humans

27:31.820 --> 27:33.820
but these parts from the bird virus

27:33.820 --> 27:35.820
prevented immune systems from

27:35.820 --> 27:37.820
effectively fighting back

27:37.820 --> 27:39.820
a deadly combination

27:39.820 --> 27:41.820
it killed somewhere between

27:41.820 --> 27:43.820
triangles and circles

27:43.820 --> 27:45.820
is a deadly combination

27:45.820 --> 27:47.820
you got to watch out

27:47.820 --> 27:49.820
but it is true that flu can

27:49.820 --> 27:51.820
reassort like that

27:51.820 --> 27:53.820
it's a different sort of process

27:53.820 --> 27:55.820
according to the mythology

27:55.820 --> 27:57.820
for coronaviruses

27:57.820 --> 27:59.820
because flu viruses have separate

27:59.820 --> 28:01.820
RNA molecules

28:01.820 --> 28:03.820
that are independently

28:03.820 --> 28:05.820
sorted into the

28:05.820 --> 28:07.820
particle

28:07.820 --> 28:09.820
and so when you

28:09.820 --> 28:11.820
when you have more than one

28:11.820 --> 28:13.820
flu type inside of your body at once

28:13.820 --> 28:15.820
you can have a reassortment of

28:15.820 --> 28:17.820
those genes in a way that

28:17.820 --> 28:19.820
is apparently

28:19.820 --> 28:21.820
apparently more difficult

28:21.820 --> 28:23.820
in coronavirus because of its

28:23.820 --> 28:25.820
single continuous RNA genome

28:25.820 --> 28:29.820
now you can find

28:29.820 --> 28:31.820
lectures by

28:31.820 --> 28:33.820
Denison and lectures by Ralph

28:33.820 --> 28:35.820
Berwick where they're talking about

28:35.820 --> 28:37.820
recombination in coronaviruses

28:37.820 --> 28:39.820
and it is due to

28:39.820 --> 28:41.820
the fact that the

28:41.820 --> 28:43.820
the RNA dependent RNA

28:43.820 --> 28:45.820
polymerase will hop

28:45.820 --> 28:47.820
from RNA strand to RNA strand

28:47.820 --> 28:49.820
and although you're imagining

28:49.820 --> 28:51.820
that okay well when does that happen

28:51.820 --> 28:55.820
let your imagination run the camera

28:55.820 --> 28:59.820
forward so the virus copies

28:59.820 --> 29:01.820
its own RNA genome

29:01.820 --> 29:03.820
and now it has two copies

29:03.820 --> 29:05.820
of that genome and one of those

29:05.820 --> 29:07.820
genomes is about three

29:07.820 --> 29:09.820
nucleotides different than the

29:09.820 --> 29:11.820
original genome

29:11.820 --> 29:13.820
and now the RNA dependent RNA

29:13.820 --> 29:15.820
polymerase has got to float around

29:15.820 --> 29:17.820
and find the front end of another

29:17.820 --> 29:19.820
RNA and it has a choice of two of

29:19.820 --> 29:21.820
them right now if you think of a

29:21.820 --> 29:23.820
simple cartoon

29:23.820 --> 29:25.820
and as that goes on and on and on

29:25.820 --> 29:27.820
there are more and more viral

29:27.820 --> 29:29.820
RNAs in theory

29:29.820 --> 29:31.820
that are available for this

29:31.820 --> 29:33.820
RNA dependent RNA polymerase which is

29:33.820 --> 29:35.820
in limited quantity

29:35.820 --> 29:37.820
in order for it to make another copy

29:37.820 --> 29:39.820
and so it's not clear

29:39.820 --> 29:41.820
how all that works because they

29:41.820 --> 29:43.820
need to be packaged and gone you know

29:43.820 --> 29:45.820
they need to go into other viral

29:45.820 --> 29:47.820
particles but they've already

29:47.820 --> 29:49.820
documented it in experiments where

29:49.820 --> 29:51.820
these various genomic RNAs

29:51.820 --> 29:53.820
compete for RNA dependent

29:53.820 --> 29:55.820
RNA polymerase time

29:55.820 --> 29:57.820
so that being said when the RNA

29:57.820 --> 29:59.820
dependent RNA polymerase

29:59.820 --> 30:01.820
is going along and traveling

30:01.820 --> 30:03.820
it can

30:03.820 --> 30:05.820
jump off of one template

30:05.820 --> 30:07.820
and leap over

30:07.820 --> 30:09.820
on to another

30:09.820 --> 30:11.820
because according to

30:11.820 --> 30:13.820
pericandenosine up to 25

30:13.820 --> 30:15.820
percent of the genomes

30:15.820 --> 30:17.820
in any given coronavirus

30:17.820 --> 30:19.820
infection are actually recombinant

30:19.820 --> 30:21.820
genomes that recombine between

30:21.820 --> 30:23.820
a co-infection

30:23.820 --> 30:27.820
and so the

30:27.820 --> 30:29.820
co-infection of a coronavirus

30:29.820 --> 30:31.820
is likely to generate recombinant

30:31.820 --> 30:33.820
coronavirus genomes

30:33.820 --> 30:35.820
but flu has this extra

30:35.820 --> 30:37.820
added ability because of its

30:37.820 --> 30:39.820
compartmentalized or I guess you'd

30:39.820 --> 30:41.820
call it fragmented genome

30:41.820 --> 30:43.820
and so those fragments can

30:43.820 --> 30:45.820
reassort more readily. 50 and 100 million

30:45.820 --> 30:47.820
people around the world

30:47.820 --> 30:49.820
it was unlike anything else

30:49.820 --> 30:51.820
in history. You can

30:51.820 --> 30:53.820
think of a disease on two scales

30:53.820 --> 30:55.820
how contagious it is and how

30:55.820 --> 30:57.820
deadly it is. Here is the

30:57.820 --> 30:59.820
seasonal human flu while this

30:59.820 --> 31:01.820
is the bird flu and this

31:01.820 --> 31:03.820
is the 1918 combination.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.820
It was so contagious because

31:05.820 --> 31:07.820
it was airborne meaning the virus

31:07.820 --> 31:09.820
could hang in the air infecting

31:09.820 --> 31:11.820
any this is the bird flu.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.820
Now notice that this is not a

31:13.820 --> 31:15.820
scientific graph that says

31:15.820 --> 31:17.820
extremely deadly deadly quite

31:17.820 --> 31:19.820
deadly and deadly less deadly

31:19.820 --> 31:21.820
and then here it says not

31:21.820 --> 31:23.820
contagious contagious very

31:23.820 --> 31:25.820
and extremely contagious

31:25.820 --> 31:27.820
so it's not really clear

31:27.820 --> 31:29.820
why this red space is as big

31:29.820 --> 31:31.820
and this red space is less big

31:31.820 --> 31:33.820
and this base is the smallest

31:33.820 --> 31:35.820
but apparently most of the

31:35.820 --> 31:37.820
diseases are out here

31:37.820 --> 31:39.820
and the extremely deadly

31:39.820 --> 31:41.820
and extremely contagious range

31:41.820 --> 31:43.820
and very few

31:43.820 --> 31:45.820
very few diseases are down here

31:45.820 --> 31:47.820
and the contagious and

31:47.820 --> 31:49.820
and safe they're all quite

31:49.820 --> 31:51.820
deadly already and the

31:51.820 --> 31:53.820
human flu is on the border of

31:53.820 --> 31:55.820
not and quite deadly

31:55.820 --> 31:57.820
and it's not very contagious whereas

31:57.820 --> 31:59.820
the bird flu is only

31:59.820 --> 32:01.820
slightly more contagious but it's

32:01.820 --> 32:03.820
extremely deadly. And this

32:03.820 --> 32:05.820
is the 1918 combination

32:05.820 --> 32:07.820
it was so contagious because it

32:07.820 --> 32:09.820
was airborne meaning the virus

32:09.820 --> 32:11.820
could hang in the air infecting

32:11.820 --> 32:13.820
anyone who inhaled it and in

32:13.820 --> 32:15.820
1918 it infected one in every

32:15.820 --> 32:17.820
people on earth

32:17.820 --> 32:19.820
then it killed almost five percent

32:19.820 --> 32:21.820
of the world's population.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.820
I mean those are some big

32:23.820 --> 32:25.820
ass numbers that's some really

32:25.820 --> 32:27.820
big numbers and it hangs in the

32:27.820 --> 32:29.820
air and could infect anyone

32:29.820 --> 32:31.820
that came in contact with

32:31.820 --> 32:33.820
that's a highly detailed

32:33.820 --> 32:35.820
description of the contagious

32:35.820 --> 32:37.820
of something from a hundred years

32:37.820 --> 32:39.820
ago. Final ingredient was

32:39.820 --> 32:41.820
human technology. Oh here we go.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.820
This flu emerged in the middle

32:43.820 --> 32:45.820
we were sending people across from

32:45.820 --> 32:47.820
the US into Europe for war and

32:47.820 --> 32:49.820
then we're bringing them back so

32:49.820 --> 32:51.820
this virus exploited those

32:51.820 --> 32:53.820
travel patterns and they're not

32:53.820 --> 32:55.820
mentioning the fact that these

32:55.820 --> 32:57.820
boats also had animals on them.

32:57.820 --> 32:59.820
I think Mark has told us many

32:59.820 --> 33:01.820
times that that's a huge

33:01.820 --> 33:03.820
issue with regard to

33:03.820 --> 33:05.820
obviously the crowded boats to

33:05.820 --> 33:07.820
spread around the world very

33:07.820 --> 33:09.820
quickly and very effectively.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.820
In fact in every past

33:11.820 --> 33:13.820
human technology is responsible

33:13.820 --> 33:15.820
for taking diseases around the

33:15.820 --> 33:17.820
world.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.820
The black death arrived in

33:19.820 --> 33:21.820
Europe on ships in the 14th

33:21.820 --> 33:23.820
century. It was two distinct

33:23.820 --> 33:25.820
diseases bubonic plague which

33:25.820 --> 33:27.820
killed as many as 60 percent of

33:27.820 --> 33:29.820
the people who got it and

33:29.820 --> 33:31.820
pneumonic plague which killed

33:31.820 --> 33:33.820
almost everyone who got it.

33:33.820 --> 33:35.820
Then there was smallpox.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.820
It was less deadly than the

33:37.820 --> 33:39.820
black death killing 30 percent

33:39.820 --> 33:41.820
of the people who got it but it

33:41.820 --> 33:43.820
was more contagious.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.820
Humans spread it around the world.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.820
In the 20th century alone

33:47.820 --> 33:49.820
it killed around 400 million

33:49.820 --> 33:51.820
people. These other diseases

33:51.820 --> 33:53.820
have also become pandemics.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.820
But eventually we developed

33:55.820 --> 33:57.820
technology that could defend

33:57.820 --> 33:59.820
us.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.820
The practice of isolating

34:01.820 --> 34:03.820
travelers for a time to see

34:03.820 --> 34:05.820
if they were infected, now known as

34:05.820 --> 34:07.820
quarantine, was first developed

34:07.820 --> 34:09.820
during the black death.

34:09.820 --> 34:11.820
Then we invented microscopes

34:11.820 --> 34:13.820
allowing us to see the enemy for

34:13.820 --> 34:15.820
the first time.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.820
Next we developed antibiotics.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.820
These made these diseases

34:19.820 --> 34:21.820
spread by bacteria far less

34:21.820 --> 34:23.820
deadly. And smallpox led to the

34:23.820 --> 34:25.820
development of the first ever

34:25.820 --> 34:27.820
vaccine which defends us

34:27.820 --> 34:29.820
against some viruses.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.820
The way a vaccine works is we

34:31.820 --> 34:33.820
get injected with proteins from

34:33.820 --> 34:35.820
the virus and we create our

34:35.820 --> 34:37.820
antibodies. These are little

34:37.820 --> 34:39.820
molecules attached to those

34:39.820 --> 34:41.820
proteins and neutralize the

34:41.820 --> 34:43.820
virus and allow it to be swept

34:43.820 --> 34:45.820
out of the body. So when we then

34:45.820 --> 34:47.820
get infected by a real virus we

34:47.820 --> 34:49.820
can rapidly create an immune

34:49.820 --> 34:51.820
response, send out these antibodies

34:51.820 --> 34:53.820
and get rid of the virus.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.820
If enough people in a population

34:55.820 --> 34:57.820
get vaccinated it's almost

34:57.820 --> 34:59.820
impossible for the disease to

34:59.820 --> 35:01.820
spread. So smallpox was

35:01.820 --> 35:03.820
declared eradicated in 1980.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.820
This is why studies show that

35:05.820 --> 35:07.820
fewer people are contracting

35:07.820 --> 35:09.820
infectious diseases today.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.820
But at the same time, the number

35:11.820 --> 35:13.820
of outbreaks is increasing

35:13.820 --> 35:15.820
and that is largely because of

35:15.820 --> 35:17.820
emerging zoonotic viruses.

35:17.820 --> 35:19.820
Out of an estimated 1.6 million

35:19.820 --> 35:21.820
unknowns of the virus,

35:21.820 --> 35:23.820
we can see that the virus is

35:23.820 --> 35:25.820
getting infected.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.820
We can see that the virus is

35:27.820 --> 35:29.820
getting infected.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.820
We can see that the virus is

35:31.820 --> 35:33.820
getting infected.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.820
We can see that the virus is

35:35.820 --> 35:37.820
getting infected.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.820
1.6 million unknown viruses

35:39.820 --> 35:41.820
in wildlife.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.820
We currently know of about

35:43.820 --> 35:45.820
3,000.

35:45.820 --> 35:47.820
So it's really less than 0.1%.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.820
That means the next pandemic

35:49.820 --> 35:51.820
could be a virus that we're not

35:51.820 --> 35:53.820
prepared for.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.820
So that's also the sales

35:55.820 --> 35:57.820
pitch of meadow biota that

35:57.820 --> 35:59.820
there are billions of viruses

35:59.820 --> 36:01.820
of course, Peter Desak,

36:01.820 --> 36:03.820
the guy who was set up to

36:03.820 --> 36:05.820
be one of these Scooby-Doo villains.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.820
And he was set up

36:07.820 --> 36:09.820
by this movie and many movies

36:09.820 --> 36:11.820
like it and interestingly

36:11.820 --> 36:13.820
by 60 minutes appearances

36:13.820 --> 36:15.820
in the years

36:15.820 --> 36:17.820
between the first stars and this

36:17.820 --> 36:19.820
outbreak.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.820
He has been on 60 minutes

36:21.820 --> 36:23.820
more than once.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.820
And so try to imagine a scenario

36:27.820 --> 36:29.820
where a

36:29.820 --> 36:31.820
multinational

36:31.820 --> 36:33.820
group of people

36:33.820 --> 36:35.820
trying to take control

36:35.820 --> 36:37.820
of governments all around the world

36:37.820 --> 36:39.820
has seeded a narrative

36:39.820 --> 36:43.820
of pandemic potential.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.820
And seeded a narrative

36:45.820 --> 36:47.820
really like in the deepest way

36:47.820 --> 36:49.820
you can see it by seeding it

36:49.820 --> 36:51.820
right into academic science

36:51.820 --> 36:55.820
right into the primary literature.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.820
Right into the grant proposals

36:57.820 --> 36:59.820
of DARPA and the

36:59.820 --> 37:01.820
DOD and the NIH and the

37:01.820 --> 37:03.820
NIAID and the USAID

37:03.820 --> 37:05.820
that coronaviruses

37:05.820 --> 37:07.820
have pandemic potential.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.820
It's worth investigating.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.820
It gets results.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.820
It gets grants funded.

37:13.820 --> 37:15.820
It gets people on 60 minutes.

37:15.820 --> 37:17.820
And so there's nothing left to do

37:17.820 --> 37:19.820
but pull the trigger

37:19.820 --> 37:21.820
because everybody is

37:21.820 --> 37:23.820
this is the highest produced

37:23.820 --> 37:25.820
I mean come on.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.820
You could tell a story

37:27.820 --> 37:29.820
about anything

37:29.820 --> 37:31.820
with this degree

37:31.820 --> 37:33.820
of media production

37:33.820 --> 37:35.820
and people would buy into it.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820
Especially over many many years.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.820
Especially if you told the same

37:39.820 --> 37:41.820
story and implanted it in several

37:41.820 --> 37:43.820
Hollywood movies and TV shows.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.820
We know some pretty

37:51.820 --> 37:53.820
wonderful ones but we expect

37:53.820 --> 37:55.820
that there are others out there

37:55.820 --> 37:57.820
that are more lethal that are

37:57.820 --> 37:59.820
better at being transmitted

37:59.820 --> 38:01.820
where we've got no drugs and no

38:01.820 --> 38:03.820
vaccines. They're the big risk.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.820
This is called disease X

38:05.820 --> 38:07.820
and we know we're unprepared

38:07.820 --> 38:09.820
because we've seen them

38:09.820 --> 38:11.820
before.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.820
West market.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.820
West market in Leang,

38:15.820 --> 38:17.820
China.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.820
Unlike markets in much of the

38:19.820 --> 38:21.820
world, they're already dead

38:21.820 --> 38:23.820
when they arrive.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.820
This wet market sells meat

38:25.820 --> 38:27.820
that's very fresh.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.820
It's killed on site.

38:29.820 --> 38:31.820
That's what makes it a

38:31.820 --> 38:33.820
disease X factory.

38:33.820 --> 38:35.820
Many different animal species

38:35.820 --> 38:37.820
are stacked on top of each other.

38:37.820 --> 38:39.820
Their blood and meat mixed

38:39.820 --> 38:41.820
before being passed from human

38:41.820 --> 38:43.820
to human.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.820
All the while their viruses are

38:45.820 --> 38:47.820
mixing and mutating, increasing

38:47.820 --> 38:49.820
from 2002.

38:49.820 --> 38:51.820
Back then, some wet markets in

38:51.820 --> 38:53.820
China sold wild animals like

38:53.820 --> 38:55.820
snakes, civet cats, and bats.

38:55.820 --> 38:57.820
And demand for them was high.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.820
On November 16th, a man in

38:59.820 --> 39:01.820
Foshan, China, got sick after

39:01.820 --> 39:03.820
preparing a meal of chicken,

39:03.820 --> 39:05.820
cat, and snake.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.820
He had the symptoms of pneumonia,

39:07.820 --> 39:09.820
fever, cough, and trouble breathing.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.820
When treatments for pneumonia

39:11.820 --> 39:13.820
didn't work, Chinese officials

39:13.820 --> 39:15.820
reported it simply as

39:15.820 --> 39:17.820
well.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.820
Michael Podinger was involved in

39:19.820 --> 39:21.820
the early spreading of this

39:21.820 --> 39:23.820
story, and Michael Podinger

39:23.820 --> 39:25.820
is also involved in this pandemic

39:25.820 --> 39:27.820
and in several other things in

39:27.820 --> 39:29.820
between.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.820
Mark is much better at

39:31.820 --> 39:33.820
explaining this first star

39:33.820 --> 39:35.820
story, and the people involved

39:35.820 --> 39:37.820
in it than I am.

39:37.820 --> 39:39.820
But then it started spreading,

39:39.820 --> 39:41.820
and people started dying.

39:41.820 --> 39:43.820
There were reports of

39:43.820 --> 39:45.820
hospitals in China.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.820
But we're used to that.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.820
There were strains of

39:49.820 --> 39:51.820
influenza virus that caused

39:51.820 --> 39:53.820
flu in Asia many times over.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.820
And we always noted them, and

39:55.820 --> 39:57.820
there was always concern, but

39:57.820 --> 39:59.820
they were not particularly

39:59.820 --> 40:01.820
scary to us.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.820
But people like the CDC and the

40:03.820 --> 40:05.820
World Health Organization start

40:05.820 --> 40:07.820
to take notice of these rumors

40:07.820 --> 40:09.820
of illness and went to the

40:09.820 --> 40:11.820
Chinese government and asked

40:11.820 --> 40:13.820
about it.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.820
Is that someone from one of

40:15.820 --> 40:17.820
those towns decided to go

40:17.820 --> 40:19.820
to Hong Kong.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.820
Hong Kong was a uniquely

40:21.820 --> 40:23.820
bad place for this to happen.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.820
In 2003, Hong Kong was

40:25.820 --> 40:27.820
home to about 7 million people.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.820
Over 16 million tourists

40:29.820 --> 40:31.820
visited each year, and

40:31.820 --> 40:33.820
over 500 international

40:33.820 --> 40:35.820
flights took off and landed

40:35.820 --> 40:37.820
there every day.

40:37.820 --> 40:39.820
On February 21st,

40:39.820 --> 40:41.820
one man arrived.

40:41.820 --> 40:43.820
He was already feeling sick.

40:43.820 --> 40:45.820
He checked into the

40:45.820 --> 40:47.820
Metropole Hotel and headed up

40:47.820 --> 40:49.820
to his room on the ninth floor.

40:49.820 --> 40:51.820
There he threw up or coughed,

40:51.820 --> 40:53.820
spewing droplets all over the

40:53.820 --> 40:55.820
elevator and hallway.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.820
That's how he infected 16 people

40:57.820 --> 40:59.820
who would spread the disease

40:59.820 --> 41:01.820
around the world.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.820
The man in this room boarded a

41:03.820 --> 41:05.820
flight the following day,

41:05.820 --> 41:07.820
arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam,

41:07.820 --> 41:08.820
and checked himself into the

41:08.820 --> 41:10.820
hospital.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.820
He expected doctors and nurses.

41:12.820 --> 41:14.820
One of those doctors then took

41:14.820 --> 41:16.820
the disease to Bangkok.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.820
That's when the World Health

41:18.820 --> 41:20.820
Organization declared an

41:20.820 --> 41:22.820
international emergency

41:22.820 --> 41:24.820
and officially named the

41:24.820 --> 41:26.820
disease.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.820
Survey acute respiratory syndrome

41:28.820 --> 41:30.820
or SARS for short.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.820
A few days later, scientists

41:32.820 --> 41:34.820
found the cause.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.820
A virus they had never seen

41:36.820 --> 41:38.820
into the hospital.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.820
I remember sitting there, my kids

41:40.820 --> 41:42.820
were there, and I was watching

41:42.820 --> 41:44.820
the news, and all of a sudden

41:44.820 --> 41:46.820
I saw a picture of my hospital

41:46.820 --> 41:48.820
and outside a hospital on the

41:48.820 --> 41:50.820
news.

41:50.820 --> 41:52.820
That was the first time it hit

41:52.820 --> 41:54.820
home that this was going to be

41:54.820 --> 41:56.820
a problem.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.820
It was about a week later

41:58.820 --> 42:00.820
when we identified that there

42:00.820 --> 42:02.820
were a substantial number of

42:02.820 --> 42:04.820
staff at the hospital who were

42:04.820 --> 42:06.820
in the hospital.

42:06.820 --> 42:08.820
We have to get somebody else to

42:08.820 --> 42:10.820
be on call on Tuesday.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.820
What was their job, what was

42:12.820 --> 42:14.820
going to fill in for them?

42:14.820 --> 42:16.820
Sometimes just losing one senior

42:16.820 --> 42:18.820
resident in our department

42:18.820 --> 42:20.820
throws the whole department into

42:20.820 --> 42:22.820
chaos.

42:22.820 --> 42:24.820
I was feeling fine when I got

42:24.820 --> 42:26.820
home, but I woke up in the

42:26.820 --> 42:28.820
middle of the night, not feeling

42:28.820 --> 42:30.820
well with a fever.

42:30.820 --> 42:32.820
That was probably what I had.

42:32.820 --> 42:34.820
Early symptoms were subtle and

42:34.820 --> 42:36.820
hard to identify, causing

42:36.820 --> 42:38.820
outbreaks even in advanced

42:38.820 --> 42:40.820
hospitals.

42:40.820 --> 42:42.820
Back in Hong Kong, a nightmare

42:42.820 --> 42:44.820
was taking place, SARS was

42:44.820 --> 42:46.820
spreading faster than ever.

42:46.820 --> 42:48.820
A man with SARS was in this

42:48.820 --> 42:50.820
unit of an apartment complex.

42:50.820 --> 42:52.820
He had diarrhea, and when he

42:52.820 --> 42:54.820
used his toilet, the SARS

42:54.820 --> 42:56.820
virus was carried through the

42:56.820 --> 42:58.820
pipes to the unit below where a

42:58.820 --> 43:00.820
fan blew the virus back up

43:00.820 --> 43:02.820
and it was likely blowing the

43:02.820 --> 43:04.820
virus to nearby buildings, making

43:04.820 --> 43:06.820
it much more difficult to contain.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.820
That's truly a nightmare scenario.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.820
You're not physically in contact

43:10.820 --> 43:12.820
with a known infected person.

43:12.820 --> 43:14.820
So it's much harder to track

43:14.820 --> 43:16.820
because we don't necessarily know

43:16.820 --> 43:18.820
the source of the contamination.

43:18.820 --> 43:20.820
What are they talking about?

43:20.820 --> 43:22.820
29 people were infected in

43:22.820 --> 43:24.820
this apartment complex, and

43:24.820 --> 43:26.820
hundreds were quarantined.

43:26.820 --> 43:28.820
By now the world was panicking.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.820
Someone was talking about this

43:30.820 --> 43:32.820
in America and

43:32.820 --> 43:34.820
postulating as to whether

43:34.820 --> 43:36.820
rodents were carrying the

43:36.820 --> 43:38.820
virus in these apartment complexes

43:38.820 --> 43:40.820
and that's why they had closed

43:40.820 --> 43:42.820
the apartment complexes.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.820
So one of the things you have

43:44.820 --> 43:46.820
to see here or think about here

43:46.820 --> 43:48.820
is that this was a

43:48.820 --> 43:50.820
possible clone release

43:50.820 --> 43:52.820
or clone release.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.820
And so if a clone was released

43:54.820 --> 43:56.820
somewhere

43:56.820 --> 43:58.820
and spread

43:58.820 --> 44:00.820
in this manner,

44:00.820 --> 44:02.820
you might start to make

44:02.820 --> 44:04.820
a rough estimate in your mind of

44:04.820 --> 44:06.820
okay, so what happens when

44:06.820 --> 44:08.820
people are infected with a clone?

44:08.820 --> 44:10.820
This might be what it

44:10.820 --> 44:12.820
happens. This might be the

44:12.820 --> 44:14.820
extent to which

44:14.820 --> 44:16.820
a replication

44:16.820 --> 44:18.820
competent RNA infectious clone

44:18.820 --> 44:20.820
insufficient quantities

44:20.820 --> 44:22.820
could be spread. Maybe even

44:22.820 --> 44:24.820
move from country to country on

44:24.820 --> 44:26.820
Earth for a little while.

44:26.820 --> 44:28.820
But how far does it go?

44:28.820 --> 44:30.820
And how many people really get

44:30.820 --> 44:32.820
it before it changes

44:32.820 --> 44:34.820
and goes away? Because that's

44:34.820 --> 44:36.820
what Alina Chan's paper shows.

44:36.820 --> 44:40.820
That there were 50 amino acid

44:40.820 --> 44:42.820
changes per person, per infection

44:42.820 --> 44:44.820
that was sequenced

44:44.820 --> 44:46.820
in the first SARS outbreak.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.820
And in the first six months

44:48.820 --> 44:50.820
of SARS-CoV-2, there was less

44:50.820 --> 44:52.820
than 10 amino acids changed in

44:52.820 --> 44:54.820
the world.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.820
The only way that can happen is

44:56.820 --> 44:58.820
with a clone.

44:58.820 --> 45:00.820
A simultaneous application

45:00.820 --> 45:02.820
of a clone or a bunch of

45:02.820 --> 45:04.820
people with a clone sent to

45:04.820 --> 45:06.820
different places and allowed

45:06.820 --> 45:08.820
to infect people. Maybe that's

45:08.820 --> 45:10.820
the case too. I don't know how

45:10.820 --> 45:12.820
they did it. I'm just calling

45:12.820 --> 45:14.820
in the crime.

45:14.820 --> 45:16.820
Fear that dogs and cats can carry

45:16.820 --> 45:18.820
SARS has led some residents in

45:18.820 --> 45:20.820
Beijing to abandon their

45:20.820 --> 45:22.820
points to test cab drivers

45:22.820 --> 45:24.820
for high temperatures, one of

45:24.820 --> 45:26.820
the symptoms of SARS.

45:26.820 --> 45:28.820
In part, it's all down to how

45:28.820 --> 45:30.820
much we, the public, trust what

45:30.820 --> 45:32.820
we're told by officials.

45:32.820 --> 45:34.820
Is it absolutely out of the

45:34.820 --> 45:36.820
question that this could have been

45:36.820 --> 45:38.820
something inflicted upon people

45:38.820 --> 45:40.820
by a terrorist agent of some sort?

45:40.820 --> 45:42.820
I think in March of the year

45:42.820 --> 45:44.820
2003, we exclude nothing.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.820
1755 people were infected in

45:46.820 --> 45:48.820
Hong Kong and 300 died.

45:48.820 --> 45:50.820
With cases in at least 26 other

45:50.820 --> 45:52.820
countries.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.820
Ultimately, SARS killed

45:54.820 --> 45:56.820
774 people. About 10 percent

45:56.820 --> 45:58.820
of those had infected.

45:58.820 --> 46:00.820
But then SARS did something

46:00.820 --> 46:02.820
totally unexpected.

46:02.820 --> 46:04.820
The funny thing about SARS is that

46:04.820 --> 46:06.820
after a while, it just kind of goes

46:06.820 --> 46:08.820
away. SARS just wasn't that

46:08.820 --> 46:10.820
hearty of SARS. We didn't know

46:10.820 --> 46:12.820
that when it started, but that's

46:12.820 --> 46:14.820
how it turned out. But I don't

46:14.820 --> 46:16.820
think that.

46:16.820 --> 46:18.820
SARS are supposed to behave.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.820
That's why I really believe that

46:20.820 --> 46:22.820
SARS was probably an example of

46:22.820 --> 46:24.820
the release of a clone or the

46:24.820 --> 46:26.820
leak of a clone in a semi

46:26.820 --> 46:28.820
legit quantity.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.820
But nothing

46:30.820 --> 46:32.820
on the order of, you know,

46:32.820 --> 46:34.820
hundreds of liters.

46:34.820 --> 46:36.820
And again, it wouldn't matter

46:36.820 --> 46:38.820
because you still have this

46:38.820 --> 46:40.820
limitation of what RNA can do.

46:40.820 --> 46:42.820
And so unless you artificially

46:42.820 --> 46:44.820
put it in a bunch of different

46:44.820 --> 46:46.820
viruses, it would be

46:46.820 --> 46:48.820
impossible for this virus.

46:48.820 --> 46:50.820
The virus that was

46:50.820 --> 46:52.820
spread to Canada

46:52.820 --> 46:54.820
was in no way shape or form the

46:54.820 --> 46:56.820
same virus that was found

46:56.820 --> 46:58.820
originally in the first

46:58.820 --> 47:00.820
outbreak in China.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.820
They were different by

47:02.820 --> 47:04.820
hundreds of amino acids by

47:04.820 --> 47:06.820
them. And that's a really

47:06.820 --> 47:08.820
important thing to realize

47:08.820 --> 47:10.820
that a zoonotic virus or a

47:10.820 --> 47:12.820
virus that's not adapted to

47:12.820 --> 47:14.820
humans is still going to

47:14.820 --> 47:16.820
change quite significantly

47:16.820 --> 47:18.820
when it goes through

47:18.820 --> 47:20.820
thousands of them.

47:20.820 --> 47:22.820
And so if a virus has the

47:22.820 --> 47:24.820
ability to go through

47:24.820 --> 47:26.820
thousands of them, then it

47:26.820 --> 47:28.820
will have also the requisite

47:28.820 --> 47:30.820
changes that will occur after

47:30.820 --> 47:32.820
those thousands, if not

47:32.820 --> 47:34.820
hundreds of thousands of copying

47:34.820 --> 47:36.820
events.

47:36.820 --> 47:38.820
And so they make it seem like

47:38.820 --> 47:40.820
SARS did something magic.

47:40.820 --> 47:42.820
But SARS did exactly what you

47:42.820 --> 47:44.820
would expect it to do.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.820
If it started extremely

47:46.820 --> 47:48.820
pure,

47:48.820 --> 47:50.820
if it started extremely

47:50.820 --> 47:52.820
pure rather than at the

47:52.820 --> 47:54.820
normal swarm state

47:54.820 --> 47:56.820
where the vast majority of

47:56.820 --> 47:58.820
particles in any given infection

47:58.820 --> 48:00.820
are not infectious

48:00.820 --> 48:02.820
but it started in a very

48:02.820 --> 48:04.820
high purity state

48:04.820 --> 48:06.820
and it started in a few people

48:06.820 --> 48:08.820
being exposed

48:08.820 --> 48:10.820
and it's very easy to imagine

48:10.820 --> 48:12.820
how if those people

48:12.820 --> 48:14.820
exposed a few other people

48:14.820 --> 48:16.820
and it spread to them

48:16.820 --> 48:18.820
and it still remained

48:18.820 --> 48:20.820
relatively replication

48:20.820 --> 48:22.820
competent and high purity

48:22.820 --> 48:24.820
and they got it at an airplane

48:24.820 --> 48:26.820
or got it on a train

48:26.820 --> 48:28.820
you're going to see some

48:28.820 --> 48:30.820
spread.

48:30.820 --> 48:32.820
Because if you get infected

48:32.820 --> 48:34.820
by an RNA infectious clone

48:34.820 --> 48:36.820
you have many more

48:36.820 --> 48:37.820
competent particles than somebody

48:37.820 --> 48:39.820
that's very simple.

48:41.820 --> 48:43.820
It's a success story.

48:43.820 --> 48:45.820
I think a lot of that is just

48:45.820 --> 48:47.820
luck.

48:47.820 --> 48:49.820
Because a lot of mistakes were made.

48:49.820 --> 48:51.820
Chinese health officials only

48:51.820 --> 48:53.820
admitted there was an outbreak

48:53.820 --> 48:55.820
after 18 people had already

48:55.820 --> 48:57.820
died and hundreds of others

48:57.820 --> 48:59.820
were sick.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.820
After the SARS epidemic

49:01.820 --> 49:03.820
the World Health Organization

49:03.820 --> 49:05.820
brought together 196 countries

49:05.820 --> 49:07.820
and they all committed to

49:07.820 --> 49:09.820
improving their ability to

49:09.820 --> 49:11.820
detect, assess, notify and

49:11.820 --> 49:13.820
report public health events

49:13.820 --> 49:15.820
including outbreaks.

49:15.820 --> 49:17.820
In 2014 only a third of them

49:17.820 --> 49:19.820
were in compliance.

49:19.820 --> 49:21.820
The big problem with the

49:21.820 --> 49:23.820
pandemic is we don't know

49:23.820 --> 49:25.820
when it will come

49:25.820 --> 49:27.820
and so it's very easy

49:27.820 --> 49:29.820
to put off to another day.

49:29.820 --> 49:31.820
It really takes an extraordinary

49:31.820 --> 49:33.820
act of political will to say

49:33.820 --> 49:35.820
that right now things don't

49:35.820 --> 49:37.820
look that bad but we're going to

49:37.820 --> 49:39.820
send funding to public health

49:39.820 --> 49:41.820
anyway because we know that

49:41.820 --> 49:43.820
someday it will be bad.

49:43.820 --> 49:45.820
SARS showed how far and fast

49:45.820 --> 49:47.820
a virus can travel in our modern

49:47.820 --> 49:49.820
world.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.820
SARS went around the world in

49:51.820 --> 49:53.820
weeks.

49:53.820 --> 49:55.820
It's entirely possible that the

49:55.820 --> 49:57.820
next will go around the world in

49:57.820 --> 49:59.820
days. That's far faster than we

49:59.820 --> 50:01.820
could ever catch up.

50:01.820 --> 50:03.820
SARS began at the source.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.820
SARS began as a virus

50:05.820 --> 50:07.820
living silently in a wild

50:07.820 --> 50:09.820
animal.

50:09.820 --> 50:11.820
Experts believe it was bats

50:11.820 --> 50:13.820
here in southern China.

50:13.820 --> 50:15.820
These scientists have been coming

50:15.820 --> 50:17.820
to these caves since the outbreak

50:17.820 --> 50:19.820
catching bats and scanning

50:19.820 --> 50:21.820
them for viruses similar to

50:21.820 --> 50:23.820
SARS.

50:23.820 --> 50:25.820
And they're finding a lot

50:25.820 --> 50:27.820
which is allowing them to create

50:27.820 --> 50:29.820
an early warning system.

50:29.820 --> 50:31.820
And when we find them we raise the

50:31.820 --> 50:33.820
alert and the government of China

50:33.820 --> 50:35.820
comes in and tries to reduce

50:35.820 --> 50:37.820
the exposure of those populations

50:37.820 --> 50:39.820
to viruses.

50:39.820 --> 50:41.820
China is not the only place these

50:41.820 --> 50:43.820
viruses are being found.

50:43.820 --> 50:45.820
This map shows where a new

50:45.820 --> 50:47.820
virus is most likely to emerge.

50:47.820 --> 50:49.820
The front line for disease

50:49.820 --> 50:51.820
emergence are places like the

50:51.820 --> 50:53.820
end of the road in a tropical

50:53.820 --> 50:55.820
forest where someone's just

50:55.820 --> 50:57.820
built a new mining concession

50:57.820 --> 50:59.820
in the garden hunt wildlife.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.820
Or it's a farm in southeast

51:01.820 --> 51:03.820
Asia that's been expanding and

51:03.820 --> 51:05.820
intensifying that has bats

51:05.820 --> 51:07.820
nearby that spread.

51:07.820 --> 51:09.820
What's extraordinary is that this

51:09.820 --> 51:11.820
guy was able to procure millions

51:11.820 --> 51:13.820
of dollars from the US and USAID

51:13.820 --> 51:15.820
for funding of this nonsense

51:15.820 --> 51:17.820
just by telling these stories

51:17.820 --> 51:19.820
in an English accent.

51:19.820 --> 51:21.820
Stories of 1.7 million

51:21.820 --> 51:23.820
viruses waiting to zoonautically

51:23.820 --> 51:24.820
jump.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.820
Stories of third world countries

51:26.820 --> 51:28.820
like the US and USAID

51:28.820 --> 51:30.820
for us is being cut down.

51:30.820 --> 51:32.820
That's where it's really

51:32.820 --> 51:34.820
dangerous because these people

51:34.820 --> 51:36.820
are eating bush meat.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.820
I mean we might as well have

51:38.820 --> 51:40.820
Brent Weinstein on here to tell

51:40.820 --> 51:42.820
us how AIDS and everything else

51:42.820 --> 51:44.820
came from bush meat.

51:44.820 --> 51:46.820
And this most certainly came

51:46.820 --> 51:48.820
from bush meat.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.820
And this guy maybe got millions

51:50.820 --> 51:52.820
of dollars in grants, hundreds

51:52.820 --> 51:54.820
of thousands of dollars in

51:54.820 --> 51:56.820
their life.

51:56.820 --> 51:58.820
And the other thing that I think

51:58.820 --> 52:00.820
is the way that they

52:00.820 --> 52:02.820
hypothesize is that

52:02.820 --> 52:04.820
that these zoonautic jumps will

52:04.820 --> 52:06.820
occur.

52:06.820 --> 52:08.820
These people were telling stories

52:08.820 --> 52:10.820
they weren't really making

52:10.820 --> 52:12.820
viruses.

52:12.820 --> 52:14.820
They weren't really going to put

52:14.820 --> 52:16.820
fear and you think this guy

52:16.820 --> 52:18.820
was going to put fear and cleavage

52:18.820 --> 52:20.820
sites into 20 different

52:20.820 --> 52:22.820
coronaviruses and then make a

52:22.820 --> 52:24.820
decision.

52:24.820 --> 52:26.820
And do you really believe that

52:26.820 --> 52:28.820
or do you believe that this guy

52:28.820 --> 52:30.820
is you know all about

52:30.820 --> 52:32.820
telling stories?

52:32.820 --> 52:34.820
All about telling stories

52:34.820 --> 52:36.820
so that people can go on

52:36.820 --> 52:38.820
and tell stories about his

52:38.820 --> 52:40.820
stories.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.820
And so that Dr. Giordano can tell

52:42.820 --> 52:44.820
stories about his stories.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.820
And collectively we can

52:46.820 --> 52:48.820
bamboozle the world

52:48.820 --> 52:50.820
about the importance of public

52:50.820 --> 52:52.820
health.

52:52.820 --> 52:54.820
Because even though it doesn't

52:54.820 --> 52:56.820
seem important right now we

52:56.820 --> 52:58.820
should invest in it because we

52:58.820 --> 53:00.820
know it's going to be important

53:00.820 --> 53:02.820
in the future.

53:02.820 --> 53:04.820
This is a revolutionary way to

53:04.820 --> 53:06.820
defend ourselves against future

53:06.820 --> 53:08.820
pandemics but it won't catch

53:08.820 --> 53:10.820
every new disease.

53:10.820 --> 53:12.820
For that we need to improve our

53:12.820 --> 53:14.820
vaccines.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.820
If a disease comes along that we

53:16.820 --> 53:18.820
haven't seen before typically

53:18.820 --> 53:20.820
that disease.

53:20.820 --> 53:22.820
And new technologies might

53:22.820 --> 53:24.820
shorten those times.

53:24.820 --> 53:26.820
That's why an organization called

53:26.820 --> 53:28.820
SEPI was founded and they're

53:28.820 --> 53:30.820
developing a vaccine for

53:30.820 --> 53:32.820
disease acts.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.820
Traditional vaccines inject

53:34.820 --> 53:36.820
protein molecules from a virus

53:36.820 --> 53:38.820
and manufacturing these proteins

53:38.820 --> 53:40.820
is a long and expensive process

53:40.820 --> 53:42.820
but this new vaccine doesn't use

53:42.820 --> 53:44.820
proteins.

53:44.820 --> 53:46.820
It injects genetic material that

53:46.820 --> 53:48.820
actually forms the

53:48.820 --> 53:50.820
manufacturer creating the

53:50.820 --> 53:52.820
protein molecules and then the

53:52.820 --> 53:54.820
antibodies for them.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.820
My shortness times.

53:56.820 --> 53:58.820
That's why an organization called

53:58.820 --> 54:00.820
SEPI was founded and they're

54:00.820 --> 54:02.820
developing a vaccine for

54:02.820 --> 54:04.820
disease acts.

54:04.820 --> 54:06.820
Traditional vaccines inject

54:06.820 --> 54:08.820
protein molecules from a

54:08.820 --> 54:10.820
virus and manufacturing these

54:10.820 --> 54:12.820
proteins is a long.

54:12.820 --> 54:14.820
Did you know that SEPI was

54:14.820 --> 54:16.820
formed specifically to develop

54:16.820 --> 54:18.820
genetic vaccines so then SEPI

54:18.820 --> 54:20.820
also funded Moderna I suppose?

54:20.820 --> 54:22.820
Interesting.

54:22.820 --> 54:24.820
Long and expensive process but

54:24.820 --> 54:26.820
this new vaccine doesn't use

54:26.820 --> 54:28.820
proteins. It injects genetic

54:28.820 --> 54:30.820
material that tells the body to

54:30.820 --> 54:32.820
produce those proteins itself.

54:32.820 --> 54:34.820
Your body becomes the

54:34.820 --> 54:36.820
manufacturer creating the

54:36.820 --> 54:38.820
protein molecules and then the

54:38.820 --> 54:40.820
antibodies for them.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.820
Scientists can customize the

54:42.820 --> 54:44.820
material to get the body to

54:44.820 --> 54:46.820
produce the protein molecules of

54:46.820 --> 54:48.820
almost any virus.

54:48.820 --> 54:50.820
Once they figure out how to

54:50.820 --> 54:52.820
deliver this into the body it

54:52.820 --> 54:54.820
could reduce the time it takes to

54:54.820 --> 54:56.820
develop a new vaccine from

54:56.820 --> 54:58.820
several years to just 16 weeks.

54:58.820 --> 55:00.820
There was the rub.

55:00.820 --> 55:02.820
Once they figure it out how to

55:02.820 --> 55:04.820
deliver this to the body it could

55:04.820 --> 55:06.820
reduce from six years to 16

55:06.820 --> 55:08.820
weeks. Listen carefully.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.820
It injects genetic material that

55:10.820 --> 55:12.820
tells the body to produce those

55:12.820 --> 55:14.820
proteins itself.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.820
Your body becomes the

55:16.820 --> 55:18.820
manufacturer creating the

55:18.820 --> 55:20.820
protein molecules and then the

55:20.820 --> 55:22.820
antibodies for them.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.820
Scientists can customize the

55:24.820 --> 55:26.820
material to get the body to

55:26.820 --> 55:28.820
produce the protein molecules of

55:28.820 --> 55:30.820
almost any virus.

55:30.820 --> 55:32.820
Once they figure out how to

55:32.820 --> 55:34.820
deliver this into the body it could

55:34.820 --> 55:36.820
reduce the time it takes to

55:36.820 --> 55:38.820
develop a new vaccine from

55:38.820 --> 55:40.820
the body.

55:40.820 --> 55:42.820
Meanwhile scientists are trying to

55:42.820 --> 55:44.820
develop a universal influenza

55:44.820 --> 55:46.820
vaccine. One shot that could

55:46.820 --> 55:48.820
immunize us from every possible

55:48.820 --> 55:50.820
flu strain for life.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.820
I mean think about how stupid

55:52.820 --> 55:54.820
that story is.

55:54.820 --> 55:56.820
Think about how ridiculous that

55:56.820 --> 55:58.820
story is knowing what you know

55:58.820 --> 56:00.820
about the immune system after

56:00.820 --> 56:02.820
hanging out with me for a little

56:02.820 --> 56:04.820
while.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.820
They've been talking about a

56:06.820 --> 56:08.820
little bit about how she was

56:08.820 --> 56:10.820
40.

56:10.820 --> 56:12.820
I mean come on.

56:12.820 --> 56:14.820
This is crazy talk.

56:14.820 --> 56:16.820
And this was from 2019.

56:16.820 --> 56:18.820
It's a Netflix show man.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.820
From a series called

56:20.820 --> 56:22.820
Explained.

56:22.820 --> 56:24.820
And this one was called the

56:24.820 --> 56:26.820
next pandemic.

56:26.820 --> 56:28.820
I mean this is just as

56:28.820 --> 56:30.820
damning as Brett Weinstein

56:30.820 --> 56:32.820
having Sam Harris on his

56:32.820 --> 56:34.820
podcast in December of

56:34.820 --> 56:36.820
2020.

56:36.820 --> 56:38.820
This is the anti-vex

56:38.820 --> 56:40.820
attitude if there's a real

56:40.820 --> 56:42.820
pandemic.

56:42.820 --> 56:44.820
This is absolutely insane.

56:44.820 --> 56:46.820
We have been

56:46.820 --> 56:48.820
had.

56:48.820 --> 56:50.820
This is not a mystery that needs

56:50.820 --> 56:52.820
solving.

56:52.820 --> 56:54.820
This was a mystery that we were

56:54.820 --> 56:56.820
handed.

56:56.820 --> 56:58.820
Forced fed.

56:58.820 --> 57:00.820
Tied down.

57:00.820 --> 57:02.820
Our eyes were pinned open.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.820
It was a mystery.

57:04.820 --> 57:06.820
It was a mystery.

57:06.820 --> 57:08.820
None of those

57:08.820 --> 57:10.820
universal flu vaccines

57:10.820 --> 57:12.820
as they're called are

57:12.820 --> 57:14.820
anywhere near to being deployed

57:14.820 --> 57:16.820
in the population yet.

57:16.820 --> 57:18.820
But the U.S. federal government

57:18.820 --> 57:20.820
and governments in Europe

57:20.820 --> 57:22.820
have been supporting that

57:22.820 --> 57:24.820
research in a way that they

57:24.820 --> 57:26.820
didn't in a couple of decades

57:26.820 --> 57:28.820
before.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.820
Because they understand that

57:30.820 --> 57:32.820
it's not a mystery.

57:32.820 --> 57:34.820
Because human technology

57:34.820 --> 57:36.820
has made the next pandemic

57:36.820 --> 57:38.820
inevitable.

57:38.820 --> 57:40.820
Deforestation is bringing more

57:40.820 --> 57:42.820
wild animals into contact

57:42.820 --> 57:44.820
with more people.

57:44.820 --> 57:46.820
And factory farming is pushing

57:46.820 --> 57:48.820
animals closer together

57:48.820 --> 57:50.820
giving their viruses more

57:50.820 --> 57:52.820
opportunities to combine

57:52.820 --> 57:54.820
into one that could infect us.

57:54.820 --> 57:56.820
Then we give them more ways

57:56.820 --> 57:58.820
than ever to spread.

57:58.820 --> 58:00.820
We've been in this race since

58:00.820 --> 58:02.820
life on Earth began.

58:02.820 --> 58:04.820
When a pandemic comes along

58:04.820 --> 58:06.820
of any size, we always look

58:06.820 --> 58:08.820
back and wish we'd invested more.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.820
We are far short of what

58:14.820 --> 58:16.820
needs to be done.

58:20.820 --> 58:22.820
Well, I hope I've convinced

58:22.820 --> 58:24.820
you that this is no joke.

58:24.820 --> 58:26.820
They have been planning this

58:26.820 --> 58:28.820
at some time and they've been

58:28.820 --> 58:30.820
brainwashing people for some

58:30.820 --> 58:32.820
time.

58:32.820 --> 58:34.820
And we're not going to do this

58:34.820 --> 58:36.820
one.

58:36.820 --> 58:38.820
And so it's really something that

58:38.820 --> 58:40.820
we've got to be aware of.

58:40.820 --> 58:42.820
We've got to be alert to.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.820
We've got to understand that

58:44.820 --> 58:46.820
that's happening.

58:46.820 --> 58:48.820
And it's really something that

58:48.820 --> 58:50.820
needs talking about regularly.

58:50.820 --> 58:52.820
So that's why I'm going to keep

58:52.820 --> 58:54.820
repeating myself here

58:54.820 --> 58:56.820
that was the show.

59:00.820 --> 59:02.820
I'm not sure if that's

59:02.820 --> 59:04.820
from

59:04.820 --> 59:06.820
$64,000

59:06.820 --> 59:08.820
pyramid or if that's from Hollywood

59:08.820 --> 59:10.820
squares.

59:10.820 --> 59:12.820
They told us that there

59:12.820 --> 59:14.820
was an especially dangerous pandemic

59:14.820 --> 59:16.820
but it really wasn't. It was a bunch of

59:16.820 --> 59:18.820
protocols. And the only reason

59:18.820 --> 59:20.820
why we're buying it is because of this illusion of

59:20.820 --> 59:22.820
consensus.

59:22.820 --> 59:24.820
Is a lot like the laugh track

59:24.820 --> 59:26.820
on Seinfeld.

59:26.820 --> 59:28.820
Not only does it tell you when to laugh

59:28.820 --> 59:30.820
but it actually tricks your

59:30.820 --> 59:32.820
brain into thinking

59:32.820 --> 59:34.820
that a lot of other people think what's

59:34.820 --> 59:36.820
happening on the screen is funny

59:36.820 --> 59:38.820
and that makes it funnier for you.

59:38.820 --> 59:40.820
You might be not aware of this

59:40.820 --> 59:42.820
but actually that's also the reason

59:42.820 --> 59:44.820
why a joke is funnier

59:44.820 --> 59:46.820
when you tell it to lots of people

59:46.820 --> 59:48.820
that's why a comedian is much funnier

59:48.820 --> 59:50.820
when there's lots of people in the

59:50.820 --> 59:52.820
that's why a rock concert is

59:52.820 --> 59:54.820
more enjoyable when you go

59:54.820 --> 59:56.820
with your friends. That's why a

59:56.820 --> 59:58.820
church service is more

59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.820
invigorating than watching a church service on

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.820
Zoom because

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.820
being around other people

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.820
that are sharing an experience with

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.820
you and enjoying

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.820
the same experience or

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.820
fearing the same experience

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.820
can amplify the emotion of the

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.820
experience for you because

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820
we're social animals

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.820
and that's how it works.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.820
That's also why when somebody tells a joke

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.820
and you don't know that it's funny

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.820
but everybody else laughs

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.820
you tend to laugh along

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.820
maybe you'll get it later

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.820
maybe you won't

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.820
but at least you won't feel like

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.820
left out or like an idiot

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.820
and this impetus is real

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.820
and this impetus can be

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.820
hijacked by social media

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.820
if every time you open your phone

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.820
you scroll past 50 people

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.820
who all think the same thing

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.820
it's going to be harder

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.820
for you to disagree with

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.820
that same thing than it

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.820
would have been before you opened your phone

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.820
if you

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.820
watch a news program

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.820
with four people talking and all

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.820
those four people agree about

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.820
something to do with the city council

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.820
it's going to be hard for you

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.820
or harder for you

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.820
than it was before that news program

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.820
to go against that idea

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.820
simply because of the illusion

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.820
of consensus

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.820
if you remove the illusion of consensus

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.820
it becomes clear how powerful it is

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.820
medium turkey chili

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.820
medium crab bis

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.820
you didn't get any bread

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.820
just forget it but it go

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.820
excuse me I think you forgot my bread

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.820
bread two dollars extra

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.820
two dollars but everyone in front of me

01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.820
got three bread

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.820
you want bread?

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.820
yes please

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.820
three dollars

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.820
nothing for you

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.820
no soup for you

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.820
and you can tell that these players

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:12.820
are all playing along

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.820
because they're ignoring the things that could

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.820
reduce the impact

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.820
of the novel virus

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.820
reduce the need

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.820
for the intervention

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.820
reduce the excuse

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.820
for the application

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.820
of the blind protocols

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.820
you see the whole excuse

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.820
for stumbling into remdesivir

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.820
and stumbling into ventilation

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.820
was the unknown aspect

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.820
of the novel virus

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.820
but if you remove the unknown aspect

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.820
of the novel virus

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.820
then it becomes clear

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.820
what really happened is a crime

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.820
iatrogenic murder

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.820
that's why

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.820
Robert Malone is very curious

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.820
talking to Paul Catrell

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.820
on a stream

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.820
in August of 2021

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.820
saying the dexamethasone

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.820
could be used to drive up the kill rate

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.820
and that remdesivir

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.820
was a rabbit hole that he didn't want to go down

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.820
well isn't that curious

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.820
how can we stop saying that?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.820
why didn't he say that

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.820
on Brett Weinstein's street?

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.820
one of the three tv scenarios

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.820
is a laboratory or a bad cave zone

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.820
and we saw that in spades

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.820
on that program

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.820
with Peter Dasek and Bill Gates

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.820
here on Netflix

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.820
and that is the mystery that we were supposed to solve

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.820
and we were supposed to argue

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.820
that the lab leak had come on

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820
it can't be a lab leak

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.820
it just came from those dirty markets

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820
and then with the cover up

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.820
and people lying and covering up their emails

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.820
and slack messages

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.820
it became clear

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.820
that even people on the natural

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.820
zoonosis side

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.820
were covering up their

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.820
suspicions that it was a lab leak

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.820
so now the whole world

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.820
has kind of come to the conclusion

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.820
that it's a lab leak

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.820
that means that a lab leak

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.820
can come in the future

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.820
and there's nothing you can do about it

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.820
as Robert Malone said

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.820
it's easier and easier to build the

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.820
by the equipment on eBay

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.820
and do it in your garage

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.820
for goodness sakes

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.820
but I'm suggesting

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.820
that the PCR test

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.820
independently unable to differentiate

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.820
from a conflated background signal

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.820
could easily be used

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.820
as a psychological weapon

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.820
to drive people mad

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.820
and to think that there's the spread

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.820
of a novel virus because they're naive

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.820
and because the TV

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.820
and the social media can be used

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.820
to create an illusion of consensus

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.820
that not very many people

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.820
are immune to

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.820
and so the way they did it

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.820
it could have been a many many many

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.820
different things it could have been

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.820
an endemic background coronavirus

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.820
and they're just lying

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.820
because the robustness

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.820
of the early signals

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.820
and they're

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.820
let's say gusto

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.820
in displaying the

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.820
apparent fidelity

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.820
of these early molecular signals

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.820
leads me to believe

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.820
that the protocols were murder and

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.820
transfection is not medicine

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.820
but it's actually an infectious clone

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.820
release around the world

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.820
in many places

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.820
especially in Iran

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.820
people or certain

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.820
certain sentinel cases

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.820
in places

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.820
around the world

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.820
in those sentinel cases

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.820
that were intended to be sequenced

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.820
most certainly had

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.820
the intended viral sequence

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.820
present because of an infectious clone

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.820
and

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.820
that infectious clone included

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.820
a spike protein that may or may not

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.820
have been designed to be immunogenic

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.820
so that when it was applied

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.820
as an mRNA

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.820
antigen

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.820
that it would be effective

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.820
in generating a robust antibody response

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.820
and so what better way to do it right

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.820
you don't want to take any chances

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.820
so you might as well release

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.820
an viral clone that has a sequence

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.820
you've already tested

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.820
and know

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.820
at least have a good idea

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.820
that when you transfect somebody with this

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.820
you're going to get an antibody response to it

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.820
that doesn't make it medicine

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.820
could have been a

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.820
transfection agent release

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.820
you could think of an infectious clone as that

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.820
but you could also think of a

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.820
transfection agent just carrying the spike protein

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.820
might be enough

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.820
aerosolized DNA of the spike protein

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.820
would definitely be enough to give you

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.820
a PCR positive

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.820
but protocols remain murder

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.820
and transfection is not medicine

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.820
it could also just be a conflated background

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.820
signals where the protocols kill

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.820
there's no release, no spread

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.820
of a background signal and nobody cares

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.820
still means that the protocols

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.820
are murder and transfection is not medicine

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.820
the people who are saying there are no viruses

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.820
are just flat out

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.820
frustrating

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.820
and I do believe that you have to

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.820
characterize this as somewhat disingenuous

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.820
because again there is

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.820
transfection, there is aerosolized

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.820
RNA and DNA, there is

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.820
these applications

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.820
for the molecular biology that we do

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.820
know exists

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.820
and we do know that we can make large quantities

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.820
of it, we can fill this whole bottle

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:28.820
full of spike protein DNA

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.820
or spike protein RNA

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.820
if we wanted to

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.820
and that bottle would be enough to

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.820
probably

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.820
transfect people with symptoms

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.820
and detectable levels of the protein

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.820
or the DNA or the RNA

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.820
hundreds or thousands or

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.820
maybe even hundreds of thousands of people

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.820
with just this bottle

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.820
depending on how efficiently you were able to distribute it

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.820
so the idea that a

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.820
signal that could be called

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.820
a pandemic couldn't be created

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.820
is just absurd, of course it could be created

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.820
of course that

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.820
signal

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.820
where in the hell is my mouse

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.820
of course that signal could be created

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.820
the point is, is there a conflated

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.820
background signal?

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.820
is there one?

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.820
how conflated is it?

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.820
how are we going to solve that problem?

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.820
I don't know

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.820
but again I'm calling 911

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.820
I shouldn't have to explain

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.820
the motivations of

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.820
the intruder, I shouldn't have to explain

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.820
what he's trying to get, what he's doing there

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.820
or

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.820
or whatever

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.820
all I should have is the cops coming

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.820
and right now we need to call this

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.820
what it is, protocols for murder,

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.820
transfection is not medicine, so somebody's in trouble

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.820
for this because they knew this

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.820
already a long time ago

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.820
I actually think a lot of the performers

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820
knew this a long time ago

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.820
a lot of the performers

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.820
knew this a long time ago

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820
but their job is to change our mind

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.820
about this stuff and more importantly

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.820
their job is not to question the faith

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.820
their job is not to question

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.820
the pandemic potential

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.820
of viruses in mother nature

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.820
is the greatest bioterrorist

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.820
they're definitely not supposed to question

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.820
the possibilities and potentials

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.820
that are accessible in cell culture

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.820
or in animal passage

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.820
and nobody can question the potential

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.820
that's

01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.820
available with CRISPR, CAS9

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.820
and all these other fancy techniques

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.820
that we can use to stitch viruses

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.820
together from scratch

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.820
and they won't question this mythology

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.820
because they are part of a movement

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.820
which is designed to get rid of

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.820
national borders

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.820
to get rid of individual sovereignty

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.820
to get rid of sovereignty

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.820
of parents

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.820
and their kids

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.820
that that that's sovereignty of the family

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.820
they're trying to get rid of all of that

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.820
in the name of public health

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.820
because you're too dumb to know

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.820
and because this this is way too

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.820
freaking dangerous

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.820
and that's what they want you to believe

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.820
so that you'll surrender

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.820
they want you to think

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.820
holy man

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.820
people like Peter Desak

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.820
I mean

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.820
I don't want to trust Bill Gates either

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.820
but I mean come on

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.820
if you have to choose between those two guys

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.820
I'll trust Bill Gates any day

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.820
give me a vaccine

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.820
that's what they want you to think

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.820
that's how scared they want you to be

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.820
that's why they changed

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820
how you think about

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.820
a coronavirus swarm

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.820
and they all cause mortality

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.820
and respiratory virus

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.820
in response to it as well as vaccines

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.820
so that they could ventilate people

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.820
and you wouldn't say anything

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.820
so they could roll out a brand new thing

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.820
called Remdesivir

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.820
and nobody would question it

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.820
and that's why Robert Malone said

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.820
it was a rabbit hole he didn't want to go down

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.820
in August of 2021

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.820
when he could have spoke out

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.820
against Remdesivir

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.820
and ended all those deaths

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.820
those people who were still going to receive

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.820
Remdesivir for another year

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.820
but he didn't because it was a rabbit

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.820
all he didn't want to go down

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.820
and dexamethasone is another way

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.820
to blow up the numbers

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.820
by the way

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.820
why would they want to blow up the numbers Robert

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.820
so they lied to us

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.820
about the PCR being able to

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:28.820
detect a dangerous novel virus

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.820
and they made people

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.820
follow these orders with

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.820
financial incentives

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.820
that included, you know,

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.820
bonuses for people that were ventilated

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.820
and bonuses for deaths

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.820
there was an RNA infectious clone

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.820
that was likely used to see the sequence

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.820
in certain places

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.820
so that a spike protein

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.820
of their choice could be used

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.820
as the vaccine target

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.820
or vaccine candidate

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.820
and I think there has been a plan

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.820
all along

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.820
to surrender our individual sovereignty

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.820
to force a global fundamental

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.820
inversion from basic human rights

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.820
to basic granted permissions

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.820
because we are at a time point

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.820
where human diversity is at its peak

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.820
for all time

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.820
there will never be more genetic diversity

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.820
available again so they need to collect it

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.820
that's why they need to change the minds

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.820
of the young

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.820
they're specifically after young people

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.820
they're not after people like me

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.820
they're 51 years old

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.820
they're not after people like me

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.820
they're after my kids kids

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.820
if they can convince

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.820
my 14 year old son

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.820
that his dad's nuts and the diseases

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.820
are real

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.820
and the genetics are way beyond him

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.820
and he might as well turn his over

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.820
then he'll grow up

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.820
into a digital prison that he'll never be able

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.820
to escape and might even not even realize

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.820
is there

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.820
because it'll govern his behavior

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.820
in every part of his life

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.820
even to the point of deciding when

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.820
many kids he can have

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.820
that's the plan

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.820
that's the plan ladies and gentlemen

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.820
the plan is to collect

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.820
2 billion genomes in the next 10 years

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.820
and all of the data associated with them

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.820
they want it to be normal

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.820
for us to just give all of our data

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.820
from birth

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.820
because you know I mean it's good for the community

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.820
it's good for the country

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.820
it's good for everybody

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.820
ladies and gentlemen you can find me

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.820
at gigalombio.com

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.820
and that's here

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.820
up at the top

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.820
gigalomb.bio

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.820
and you can also find me

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.820
at gigalombiological.com

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:42.820
I think

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.820
yes, transfection is not immunization

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.820
intramuscular injection

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.820
of any combination of substances

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.820
to augment the immune system is pretty dumb

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.820
and I believe that wholeheartedly

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.820
I think over the next few years

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.820
that's going to be the main job

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.820
that we have is trying to convince people

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.820
that this is not a crazy idea

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.820
but it's something that we should have come to a long time ago

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.820
please stop all transfections

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.820
and humans because they're trying to eliminate

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.820
the control group by any means

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.820
necessary

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.820
this has been gigalombiological

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.820
high-resistance low noise information stream

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.820
brought to you by a biologist

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.820
I'm just a big shout out to the

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.820
Broken Science Initiative

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.820
the live release glitched out

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.820
of the doctors and scientists

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.820
interview that I did with Brian Hooker

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.820
but they fixed it

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.820
and it's up now and

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.820
I guess I can probably find that link

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.820
really quick

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.820
I bet I can find it really quick

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:40.820
let's see where it is

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.820
here it is

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.820
oh Christy you beat me

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.820
you demon

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.820
how did you do that

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.820
wow Christy beat me to the link

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.820
that's really fast

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.820
okay thanks very much for joining me guys

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.820
I will see you again tomorrow

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:04.820
tomorrow's Saturday

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.820
that I'll try to be on

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.820
my friend

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.820
just Janarito in the chat

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820
just clued me into a person

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.820
who apparently is an old school

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.820
a lot of the stuff that goes on

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.820
in the FDA in the early years

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.820
and

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.820
I'm looking forward

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.820
to

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.820
watching a couple of these

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.820
videos

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.820
it looks like the guy's name is

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.820
Peter Huber

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.820
so I think tomorrow

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.820
we're going to watch a video

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.820
by Peter Huber

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.820
who's going to be talking about

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.820
personalized medicine in the 21st century

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.820
I'm going to look up some stuff about him

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.820
before I get to that tomorrow

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.820
thanks very much guys

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.820
I'll see you again have a great night
