WEBVTT

01:14.980 --> 01:17.140
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.980
I want people to complain.

01:18.980 --> 01:19.980
So what do I do?

01:19.980 --> 01:20.980
I go to Des Moines.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.980
Ladies and gentlemen and people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines.

01:23.980 --> 01:24.980
I live there for four years.

01:24.980 --> 01:25.980
I go to Des Moines.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.980
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

01:28.980 --> 01:29.980
I go to Seattle.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.980
I infect a couple of cases there.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.980
I go to North Carolina.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.980
I go to Wisconsin.

01:35.980 --> 01:42.980
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

01:42.980 --> 01:44.980
These individuals complain.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.980
Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.980
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

01:48.980 --> 01:54.980
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.980
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

01:58.980 --> 02:00.980
I take attribution for that.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.980
Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

02:02.980 --> 02:09.980
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x, y, and z.

02:09.980 --> 02:11.980
These people are really sick with this.

02:11.980 --> 02:23.980
Then I say others who are also infected will show subdramal, predrome signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

02:23.980 --> 02:33.980
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.980
The CDC comes back and says nonsense.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.980
That's not real.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.980
I come back and say that's fake news.

02:40.980 --> 02:46.980
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

02:46.980 --> 02:52.980
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

02:55.980 --> 03:04.980
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.980
And, you know, it's not, you know, measles plus.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.980
I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.980
It's just a big hassle in the end.

03:17.980 --> 03:33.980
But no, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.980
There'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

03:36.980 --> 03:41.980
And this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another.

03:41.980 --> 03:42.980
I mean, so.

03:45.980 --> 03:57.980
And I also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooey, who some of you will know from his lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a bike journal club on a bike.

03:58.980 --> 04:04.980
That he also has advanced a version of this hypothesis. So I don't claim it to be unique. I do think I arrived at it independently.

04:04.980 --> 04:25.980
Where, you know, I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to.

04:26.980 --> 04:34.980
So that's the best I can do with that. I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.980
We're going to be starting here in a few seconds.

04:44.980 --> 04:52.980
I always need to straighten a bunch of things out in the background here because I push the button to make sure that I don't back out.

04:52.980 --> 04:57.980
And then I usually figure out that something isn't quite right. And so.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.980
Anyway, I'm getting there. It's almost done.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.980
17th of January, 2024, I mean.

05:11.980 --> 05:18.980
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

05:18.980 --> 05:25.980
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

05:42.980 --> 05:53.980
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally in these COVID vaccines or vaccines, the flu vaccines vaccine.

05:53.980 --> 05:58.980
Okay. But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines and.

05:58.980 --> 06:07.980
You know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada saying nine months is as actually J.

06:08.980 --> 06:13.980
Insistence and I think he's right. I'm calling them transfections rather than the vaccines.

06:14.980 --> 06:42.980
You scheduled for 60 minutes next is going on French British Italian Japanese television.

06:42.980 --> 06:48.980
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

08:27.980 --> 08:33.980
So, we are being manipulated

08:33.980 --> 08:43.100
So we are being manipulated by an unseen mechanism and that unseen mechanism has increased in

08:43.100 --> 08:52.860
power in ways that we can't really fully fathom. But it has a lot to do with with machine learning

08:53.660 --> 08:58.380
and artificial intelligence if you want to call it that but those algorithms that they use

08:59.260 --> 09:05.180
have been turned against us and they've they've led us to believe that the idea is that AI is

09:05.180 --> 09:10.300
going to solve a lot of really big problems but it's actually just going to be our prison

09:11.340 --> 09:15.980
and if we don't learn our history real quick it's going to be race that's for darn sure

09:17.660 --> 09:23.420
because they don't want anyone to be able to see anymore they don't want anyone to be shown

09:23.420 --> 09:29.500
anymore they want all of us to be those types of people who do not see they want our children

09:30.460 --> 09:38.940
to be those types of people that do not see even when they're shown and that's what this

09:38.940 --> 09:43.500
this whole operation is all about it's ignoring the biology that would free our

09:43.500 --> 09:48.620
children if you ignore the biology that will free our children then it doesn't really matter what

09:48.700 --> 09:55.420
you do you can you can you can really fight and seem like you're fighting but you'll be

09:55.420 --> 10:01.180
bamboozled the whole time and as you're bamboozled you will lose interest in finding the truth because

10:01.180 --> 10:07.020
your salary will depend on you not finding the truth because your family will depend on you not

10:07.020 --> 10:11.180
finding the truth and that's where a lot of these people are they've given into the charlatan

10:11.900 --> 10:17.500
and now they can't turn their back on it anymore even if they know and some of these people know

10:18.380 --> 10:23.660
some of them don't want to know the lookaway doctrine it's everywhere now

10:26.380 --> 10:31.180
yeah so you know Frank Zappa's dad whatever it doesn't mean that he didn't tell the truth

10:31.180 --> 10:36.300
a lot of these people are telling the truth it's just what they don't tell you or what they don't

10:36.300 --> 10:43.420
question that traps you that's how you see the theater for what it is

10:44.220 --> 10:50.060
because you see that they've been making us ask questions that are irrelevant

10:51.500 --> 10:58.380
asking questions that are irrelevant has gotten us 50 years through history without asking the

10:58.380 --> 11:05.260
relevant questions about this situation and only now are we starting to question those things

11:05.260 --> 11:09.420
ladies and gentlemen this is a stream brought to you by a patch clamp physiologist kick home

11:10.220 --> 11:16.060
is a resistance measurement that applies to patch clamp physiological recordings

11:16.060 --> 11:20.700
and so this is a Gigaohm Biological high resistance low noise information brief

11:21.260 --> 11:27.900
you can find me at Gigaohm Biological dot com and gigaohm.bio. gigaohm.bio is a little

11:27.900 --> 11:33.420
bit more of a messaging board um you can also find my confession at that link called scooby

11:33.420 --> 11:38.380
you can find a one-time support link there and support giga ohm you can find a link to watch

11:38.380 --> 11:44.060
the brief a schedule a download of the stream deck is coming very soon online every week

11:45.580 --> 11:50.300
and there's a voicemail box an email address and then there's the subscribers

11:51.500 --> 11:57.100
we're trying to get enough of these so that Gigaohm Biological is completely 100 independent

11:57.100 --> 12:05.980
news source 100 independent reporting of biological scientific natural news if you will

12:06.700 --> 12:10.380
i know there's lots of different sources like that but that doesn't mean we don't need more

12:11.020 --> 12:17.500
independent sources and sources that can teach um i'm gonna put my neck out there and say that

12:17.500 --> 12:23.740
i am a talented teacher and that's what i want to do going forward these people are supporting

12:23.740 --> 12:31.180
my work now and you can join them by simply subscribing to my work there and any uh contribution would

12:31.180 --> 12:37.420
be great um i don't know what's going on here this is really what i want

12:43.340 --> 12:49.580
i'm just gonna do that again so keep in mind we're still trying to break through this idea

12:49.580 --> 12:55.980
that something happened in 2019 that we got to tell our kids about we got to tell our kids about

12:55.980 --> 13:01.500
what happened in 2020 that our kids have to remember the way the pandemic went when they

13:01.500 --> 13:07.180
were in high school we got to break this faith in a novel virus we really got to break it because

13:07.180 --> 13:13.020
if our kids grow up believing this and the the kids that are in college right now are about to

13:13.020 --> 13:21.020
graduate believing this this faith um we could be in really really really big trouble um we don't

13:21.020 --> 13:25.660
want the voting public not to understand that intramuscular injection of any combination of

13:25.660 --> 13:30.060
substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb we need everybody to understand

13:30.060 --> 13:46.540
that we really do and so we are fighting against this faith in a novel virus that kills millions

13:46.540 --> 13:51.660
that millions more were saved from that's likely from gain of function and that will definitely

13:51.660 --> 13:56.940
come again and perhaps even more deadly forms they've been lost on this road for a long time

13:56.940 --> 14:01.420
but we can break out people like jessica hockett and others have been noticing that there's no

14:01.420 --> 14:06.620
evidence for spread in new york city and other places where mass casualty events occurred uh

14:06.620 --> 14:11.740
some biologists like jonathan cooley have noticed that infectious clones are the only real rna threat

14:11.740 --> 14:16.860
and if placebo batches are likely distributed heck even kevin mccaren found placebo batches

14:16.860 --> 14:22.460
over in japan and is completely forgotten it seems like transfection and healthy mammals is dumb

14:23.180 --> 14:27.660
um the protocols were murdered gain of function is just a mythology especially with regard to

14:27.660 --> 14:33.660
coronavirus um you know scooby-doo is real i mean this is a mystery that we've been fooled into

14:33.660 --> 14:38.300
solving we've been we've been fooled into believing these people are arguing and backstabbing each

14:38.380 --> 14:44.060
other and suing each other and really what you're seeing is a spectacular commitment to lies that's

14:44.060 --> 14:51.660
what you're seeing it's really hard to crack the belief of a novel virus with college kids i

14:51.660 --> 14:59.660
know it i can't even imagine jill i can't even imagine um if you ever want me to zoom with them

14:59.900 --> 15:07.100
uh you know independently off offline i would be happy to do it jill

15:09.420 --> 15:15.180
i actually a long long time ago tried and did a two and a half hour stream with a husband

15:16.700 --> 15:25.260
trying to stop a divorce and i'm not even kidding i really i either did that or was or was made to

15:25.340 --> 15:33.500
believe that i had done that um i'm not really sure how to how else to say that because that's

15:33.500 --> 15:39.340
really how all of us need to think about our experiences during this pandemic have you been

15:39.340 --> 15:45.420
led to believe something or did you actually experience something that has led you to believe

15:45.420 --> 15:50.380
it or were you tricked into asking the wrong questions and then given the wrong answers and

15:50.380 --> 15:55.420
therefore led to believe something or have you really objectively experienced something that has

15:55.420 --> 16:01.500
given you an experience that leads you to understand the world better and therefore really knows

16:01.500 --> 16:08.860
something and that's really what's super duper tricky about the pandemic and and the uh what i

16:08.860 --> 16:16.700
now have pretty much come to understand as a theater um that has been enacted upon us and it's

16:16.700 --> 16:25.260
just really a question of why was the theater triggered um and and really who could have

16:26.140 --> 16:29.900
stopped it and i think you're going to figure out that an awful lot of people could have

16:29.900 --> 16:36.620
stopped it but didn't and that will that will bring you to a sort of different conclusion about how

16:36.620 --> 16:44.300
the theater was sustained um and you almost need to come to the conclusion that that the theater was

16:44.300 --> 16:51.900
sustained sort of on purpose um so i'm going to skip out of this and get a new

16:52.780 --> 17:00.220
slide deck up here if you don't mind just real quick um giggle on biological is the safest way

17:00.220 --> 17:08.220
to get biology into your brain um this is a supporter jeff from earth he's actually jeff from

17:08.220 --> 17:17.260
canada um who recently had a glioma removed from his skull um i'm not sure why they decided to

17:17.260 --> 17:26.860
install the extra pocket on his head um but that's quite a scar um i'm sure if he didn't already

17:26.860 --> 17:33.020
have kids and a wonderful wife um that would be real handy on the bar scene oh wait there's no

17:33.020 --> 17:39.260
bar scene anymore gee well anyway um thanks very much for all your support jeff and thanks very

17:39.260 --> 17:45.740
much for getting that scar in your head in the shape of an ohm um again this 17th of january

17:45.740 --> 17:54.780
2020 and we are still dealing with what essentially could be characterized as a military response

17:55.420 --> 18:01.740
um to an emergency uh the interesting thing about this military response to an emergency

18:02.380 --> 18:06.860
is that didn't i do that um is that we've heard

18:11.980 --> 18:15.820
we've heard a story several times on this stream and we play it every time in the beginning

18:17.420 --> 18:24.300
about how this might be done in the sense of trying to give the impression of of widespread

18:25.340 --> 18:33.100
pathogenic spread of some new weapon virus whatever um and dr jeer donno explains very well

18:33.100 --> 18:38.700
how actually with the help of the internet you would only need a few cases that presented in the

18:38.700 --> 18:47.180
correct way that presented in the crisis sort of way and then you would use the internet to propel

18:47.180 --> 18:54.860
the the idea that this was an impending disaster an impending doom an impending possibility that

18:54.860 --> 19:01.820
without lockdowns and all the other responses maybe without countermeasure use or protocols um that

19:01.820 --> 19:11.020
that a disaster would was inevitable and then by fracturing the trust between the government

19:11.020 --> 19:17.340
and the populace you essentially wreck a country and and wreck it for a long time and now the

19:17.340 --> 19:21.980
interesting thing about what dr jeer donno explains in this video that we've played

19:21.980 --> 19:27.500
too many times to count is that he doesn't explain the possibility that a country could

19:27.500 --> 19:35.900
already be fractured on many different political and socioeconomic lines and that such an operation

19:35.900 --> 19:43.740
using a false flag or using a a limited bio weapon that could be misconstrued as spread or or

19:44.300 --> 19:48.940
staging mass casualty events that could be misconstrued and spread or some combination of both

19:50.940 --> 19:55.100
in a country that was already politically and socioeconomically fractured

19:56.140 --> 20:02.940
that a narrative about a lab leak or a terrorist attack or a lab leak or a foreign

20:03.500 --> 20:11.180
lab leak or or a native lab leak or all the other speculation that went on in 2020 could be used

20:11.180 --> 20:18.860
in a way that far exceeds what the scenario that he now describes he's simply describing a

20:18.860 --> 20:26.220
relatively stable country that then has this sort of scenario unleashed upon it but what about a

20:26.220 --> 20:32.380
country that's already highly unstable what about a country that's already been fractured and and

20:33.820 --> 20:43.820
divided for for a decade what about a country that has been riled up and and it's it's racial

20:43.820 --> 20:50.700
divides reinvigorated when in fact they they were in fact pretty okay in the 90s

20:52.940 --> 21:01.660
and so we're really talking here about a a much more dangerous scenario than than what's described

21:01.740 --> 21:09.740
here by Dr. Giordano because again if the Scooby-Doo was applied in such a way so that there was a

21:10.460 --> 21:17.740
host of people on all sides to argue for a lab leak possibility to argue for the natural

21:17.740 --> 21:25.420
possibility to make that absurd to insult one another like the Rasmussen's and the

21:26.300 --> 21:31.820
um I don't know who would have been on the other side of of of this thing I guess um

21:34.940 --> 21:40.860
well me and drastic and the people that were arguing that this had to be a lab leak that

21:40.860 --> 21:47.580
they were covering it up it was obvious it didn't dawn on me right away I knew for sure that

21:47.580 --> 21:53.020
Rand Paul and Tony Fauci were doing something in front of the senate that didn't make sense

21:53.020 --> 22:01.660
to me but at the time the concept that that the dangers of coronavirus could be exaggerated

22:01.660 --> 22:09.500
never mind that the existence of and the fidelity of the coronavirus biology signal whatever that is

22:09.500 --> 22:16.620
in the wild could be grossly over exaggerated or even wholly made from from from fresh cloth I don't

22:16.700 --> 22:22.940
know it took me a long time to see that and I don't necessarily think it was all of those

22:22.940 --> 22:30.620
people's fault up there I don't know if I would blame the Bailey's for example I don't know if

22:30.620 --> 22:39.100
I would blame Christine Massey for example it's hard for me to know who to blame up there because

22:39.100 --> 22:46.620
they were right they have been isolated a virus and proven that it causes the symptomology that's

22:46.620 --> 22:54.060
there and that that is a an argument but if you believe that there are viruses if you believe that

22:54.060 --> 22:58.940
that all of this stuff couldn't have been all made up from whole cloth then it's very difficult

22:58.940 --> 23:05.500
to reconcile those two ideas because there were people dying there were doctors complaining there

23:05.580 --> 23:11.180
were people complaining some of us got sick there was a whole list of of early covid survivors

23:11.900 --> 23:13.740
many of whom are on this screen here

23:19.180 --> 23:24.060
and so it's a very very wicked game that has been played on us because even those of us who

23:24.060 --> 23:26.940
were looking for the truth there were traps on all sides

23:27.100 --> 23:36.220
it seems as though the no virus trap above my head was really something of an isolation trap

23:36.220 --> 23:42.060
something that it's hard to really codify because at any moment in time they could just come forward

23:42.060 --> 23:49.180
now and say that Remdesivir killed people not a virus they can say that opioids killed people

23:49.180 --> 23:54.940
not a virus they could say that all kinds of changes in hospital protocols or emergency

23:54.940 --> 24:00.380
social policies that caused an increase in all caused mortality could then been misconstrued

24:00.380 --> 24:10.300
using a non-specific PCR test to cause what looks like mass casualty events are spread but they're

24:10.300 --> 24:16.780
not and those people up there didn't take much time to try and explain what was actually happening

24:16.780 --> 24:22.060
they just told you that nothing was happening that there is no virus they didn't isolate it

24:22.140 --> 24:26.620
but they didn't explain what was going on they couldn't explain away what all these doctors were

24:26.620 --> 24:33.900
seeing or why they were seeing it or what was going on I do think that Alex Zeck at times had

24:33.900 --> 24:41.420
had made um hypotheses or said things that maybe it could be a toxin and that a toxin could explain

24:41.420 --> 24:48.540
it and I don't think that that's necessarily incorrect and because we need to treat this like

24:48.540 --> 24:55.900
a crime scene then whatever was causing these mass casualty events and potentially it could have

24:55.900 --> 25:03.660
been some kind of aerosolized toxin that triggered that but we need some proof then right we got to

25:03.660 --> 25:09.180
go back and get it we got to get angry we got to do it we need people in charge that can actually

25:09.180 --> 25:14.620
go figure this out because they have convinced us that there was a lab leak cover-up happening

25:14.620 --> 25:18.940
before our eyes and the vast majority of skilled tv watchers believe it

25:22.300 --> 25:27.100
and so we have been left with people like Brett Weinstein who argue that if lockdowns can be

25:27.100 --> 25:32.140
effective if you live on an island lockdowns can be effective if you lock down hard enough

25:32.140 --> 25:37.420
or you lock down the right people or if you forcefully drug everybody with 60 days of ivermectin

25:39.660 --> 25:43.660
these are not theories that are off the table anymore these are not theories that he has

25:43.660 --> 25:52.540
disowned he just discussed them not even a couple months ago with Shellenberger or whatever it is

25:52.540 --> 26:00.940
that lockdowns are effective and so we are still left with this idea that there was a novel virus

26:00.940 --> 26:04.780
that millions died and more and more saved from and that it's gained a function is real and that

26:04.860 --> 26:09.580
a virus will come again very few of these people except for those at the top

26:11.180 --> 26:25.900
like Mike Eden and Wolfgang Wodach and and sorry and uh Denny Rancour and Nick Hudson I don't know

26:25.900 --> 26:29.980
that Sukhid Bhakti believes that I think Sukhid Bhakti thinks that there was a virus and then

26:29.980 --> 26:35.820
it went around and then it maybe it was very bad and that the spike protein was toxic I think

26:35.820 --> 26:40.860
that's possible that he still believes that I know that still Peter McCullough believes that I still

26:40.860 --> 26:50.300
know that Robert F Kennedy Jr believes that and so almost all of these other people on this

26:50.300 --> 26:55.900
page believe that there was a novel virus that gained a function is real and very dangerous

26:56.540 --> 27:02.300
Robert Malone believes that that that a bachelor's student can make viruses in their garage

27:04.060 --> 27:12.620
and this is not this is not some small exaggeration that is harmlessly being passed on to these

27:12.620 --> 27:16.460
college students that were terrorized for the last three years that had to be tested

27:17.420 --> 27:21.580
that get have to quarantine and wear masks in their classes all the time

27:22.140 --> 27:28.140
this had a real effect on them this is three years of brainwashing basically brainwashing

27:28.140 --> 27:35.580
into believing this and even if we don't believe it they believe that we need to save them we need

27:35.580 --> 27:42.620
to actively seek out ways of saving these kids these young adults who are going to go on and

27:42.620 --> 27:47.420
if they do go on to have children they're going to go on to have children and pass it along

27:52.380 --> 28:01.420
sorry I'm going to start it again yes I was I was observing already what happened in 2021

28:01.420 --> 28:12.860
exactly December of 2020 when they start massive vaccination hold on one second this is Wolfgang

28:12.860 --> 28:19.660
Wodach yes I was I was observing and he is

28:23.900 --> 28:33.820
he is whoa what is this that shouldn't be that big sorry about that um he is going to talk about

28:33.820 --> 28:38.700
his book author false pandemics yada yada but he's going to tell basically what he thought

28:39.260 --> 28:45.500
remember that Wolfgang Wodach is one of the first people to speak out in 2020 I played a

28:45.500 --> 28:52.140
couple videos of his very early on in 2020 he's one of the people that made me realize that this

28:52.140 --> 28:59.740
could really just be nonsense him and Michael Eden are the two guys that question very early

28:59.740 --> 29:06.860
on the novelty of it and the the idea that we wouldn't have overlapping immunity from other

29:06.860 --> 29:13.980
illnesses it didn't really necessarily none of us got the biology right as I see it now

29:15.020 --> 29:24.220
um most of us and I think including Wolfgang and Michael Eden still operate with some model of

29:24.220 --> 29:29.740
the biological world that includes RNA and DNA signals at this time at this size scale

29:31.180 --> 29:36.460
and they may or may not be infectious we don't necessarily need and and and replicate and stuff

29:36.460 --> 29:49.100
like that but we do need to acknowledge that the idea here is novelty the idea here is that

29:49.100 --> 29:56.700
everyone is vulnerable the idea here is that no one has previous immunity those principles those

29:56.700 --> 30:05.180
biological parameters are part of the narrative that must be reinforced by these people or it becomes

30:05.180 --> 30:10.860
a complete mythology because the whole thing tumbles apart until you get to the point where

30:10.860 --> 30:20.460
you realize that RNA can't do what they claim it did but the tumbling doesn't start until you

30:20.460 --> 30:25.980
stop acknowledging that there are viruses that do these things and we need to start talking about

30:25.980 --> 30:33.580
we don't really understand how this transmission occurs all the time there are some reasonable

30:33.580 --> 30:41.660
examples that seem to indicate that there's some almost tangible RNA signal that can be

30:41.660 --> 30:47.180
transferred from human to human or animal to animal but it's not it's not definitive evidence the

30:47.180 --> 30:54.140
way that it is portrayed by virology and I don't think that Wolfgang Wodach is free of that yet but

30:54.140 --> 30:59.580
he is free of the idea that that pandemics are something that the world needs to shut down from

31:00.380 --> 31:06.620
or let's just listen to see where he is already with what what they did with when the clinical

31:06.620 --> 31:13.580
studies in 2020 started and they published the clinical studies were published and we can see

31:13.580 --> 31:19.020
we could see that you needed to to to give the injection to more than hundred people

31:20.300 --> 31:27.820
just to prevent one case of corona flu and so this is a very ineffective

31:27.820 --> 31:35.500
and not effective way of protecting people and and so he's arguing against the vaccinations

31:36.140 --> 31:43.180
he's arguing against the vaccinations using data about PCR based infections

31:45.020 --> 31:52.940
and so in some ways he's still playing the game of the Scooby-Doo in in the much the same way you

31:52.940 --> 31:58.540
would be if you accepted the sequences that are given to you by the CDC or if you accepted the

31:59.260 --> 32:05.260
the PCR positivities that are given to you by the CDC at the beginning of the pandemic it's just

32:05.260 --> 32:12.300
not very logical to accept their data at face value given what we know from Jessica Hockett

32:12.300 --> 32:19.900
given what we know from Denny Rancourt and yet he's still basically walking that line where

32:19.900 --> 32:27.100
there was a novel virus but it wasn't very dangerous and of course this is the very wicked

32:27.100 --> 32:32.940
enchantment that you would be casting on your children because again once you accept that

32:32.940 --> 32:38.300
there's a virus the question of whether or not it was laboratory created or we got lucky this time

32:38.300 --> 32:45.980
is now an all all an in question of interpretation and so there is no way to save college kids

32:46.700 --> 32:51.980
college young adults if you use this narrative there's no way that's not saving them at all

32:51.980 --> 32:56.860
and in fact it leaves the door open for them to interpret that indeed it was a novel virus

32:56.860 --> 33:02.140
it was from a laboratory but we got lucky and we need to be very careful that we don't let any

33:02.140 --> 33:08.060
of our family and friends fall into that trap and we saw in the same time that the that the

33:08.140 --> 33:15.660
nanoparticles and the RNA which was injected is a gene therapy it was called a vaccine but it was

33:15.660 --> 33:23.980
a gene therapy so just imagine oh shoot I can't do this like this okay I'll do it right now then

33:23.980 --> 33:41.820
you would have told the people five years ago oh dear people we want to give you we want to

33:41.820 --> 33:46.620
change your genes we want to make your genes do something or yourselves do something the

33:46.620 --> 33:52.140
never did before we give you an injection you will be genetically modified for some time at least

33:52.780 --> 34:00.940
and this can just protect you against the flu people would say I'm not crazy but the propaganda

34:00.940 --> 34:08.140
worked a lot and so this this is what what happened and I was I was saying this already with my with

34:08.140 --> 34:14.140
my geed and with the former if you were former director of Pfizer science director of Pfizer and

34:14.140 --> 34:21.820
we wrote a letter to the email to the to the agency pharmaceutical agency and in in for from

34:21.820 --> 34:27.900
the EU and we told them stop those clinical studies there's there can only be nonsense out of it

34:27.900 --> 34:33.580
and it was nonsense what was out of it and but they went on and they had the contracts

34:33.580 --> 34:39.980
mrs. van der Leiden bought all those millions of doses they made a lot of business billions they

34:39.980 --> 34:46.380
earned and this this all went on and I was observing them when it started when the injections were

34:46.380 --> 34:52.220
given to the people it were not is what not the doctors normal doctors but they came with with

34:52.220 --> 34:59.580
just such gangs of farmers of medicine of doctors which were which were hired extra for that and

34:59.580 --> 35:06.860
they were accompanied by soldiers and this it was very very it was a campaign where the normal

35:06.940 --> 35:13.740
medical service was was bypassed and like that they bypassed critical doctors they just started

35:13.740 --> 35:21.420
injecting the people with the assistance of soldiers and afterwards the doctors started

35:21.420 --> 35:26.620
injecting two because they and they they got a lot of money for each injection they got 30

35:26.620 --> 35:33.900
30 euros for one injection which is very easy money and there were many doctors were following

35:33.900 --> 35:39.020
this because you can earn a lot of money so this is a way of corrupting doctors doing things they

35:39.020 --> 35:45.180
would never have done before and this was all going on and I was observing the data of Robert

35:45.180 --> 35:51.340
Koch Institute where they where you can see when when there is an emergency in a case where you

35:51.340 --> 35:57.100
know whether where the blue light on the on the on the cars and they go to hospital and emergency

35:57.180 --> 36:06.300
cases and they have they have they they write down how many emergency cases are there for respiratory

36:06.300 --> 36:15.580
reasons respiratory diseases or for cardiovascular diseases so a heart attack or stroke or something

36:15.580 --> 36:24.060
like that and and for nervous the nervous system and I found out that there was no nothing happening

36:24.620 --> 36:32.300
with the respiratory diseases it stayed the same but the cardiovascular cases the emergencies

36:32.300 --> 36:40.060
they were going up there was skyrocketing in the same time as the injections were given

36:40.060 --> 36:45.740
and the same was with the neurological with the neurological diseases and all this happened

36:46.700 --> 36:52.380
this were for me the first indicators there there's something going on and it must be some

36:52.780 --> 36:58.220
some effect of those injections which is very rapidly coming so it was coming

36:58.220 --> 37:04.940
in the of just the first two weeks after the injection most of this and so we went on we

37:04.940 --> 37:10.300
went on discussing how the mechanism how this pattern mechanism could be like when you inject

37:10.300 --> 37:17.980
those RNA and we there was Mr. Professor Bakti and others and we had we had very good explanations

37:17.980 --> 37:26.140
for what was going on and we were we were shouting alarm don't take this shot you will be ill

37:26.140 --> 37:32.540
they don't protect you and we were we were they tried to silence us they tried to make us

37:33.820 --> 37:41.580
panic we make panic and so and this is yeah why I made the show I make we were not very successful

37:41.580 --> 37:45.980
although there were many people who who were listening to us they were protected they didn't

37:46.060 --> 37:56.140
take shot they had problems yeah so that's what that's definitely one of the heroes of the

37:56.780 --> 38:02.940
2009 swine flu he actually spoke out against that and and and brought the idea of a fake pandemic

38:02.940 --> 38:09.340
to the fore and let us see that the who and other organizations had a vested interest in this

38:09.340 --> 38:15.100
happening that they were signing contracts with governments so that governments when

38:15.100 --> 38:20.460
the who declared a pandemic that they were triggering purchasing contracts of flu vaccine

38:21.340 --> 38:26.700
and they were actually pitting countries against one another saying that you know Denmark bought

38:26.700 --> 38:31.900
so many doses and so if you don't buy this many doses when we go and sell to the Netherlands there

38:31.900 --> 38:36.220
might not be enough for you and so you better reserve enough and they were signing contracts

38:36.780 --> 38:43.180
with countries like this before the the swine flu occurred and so Germany had a contract which

38:43.180 --> 38:49.420
was triggered by the who's declaration of the swine flu pandemic and the rollout of that vaccine

38:49.980 --> 38:55.500
had lots of side effects that he spoke out about and got it stopped and and also then

38:55.500 --> 39:04.300
pointed to this as being a sort of racketeering or cartel type operation and so he was in a unique

39:04.300 --> 39:08.860
position to speak out at the beginning of the pandemic and people that heard him amplified him

39:08.860 --> 39:16.860
and some people didn't and I think if you figure out who didn't amplify Mike Eden, Wolfgang Woda,

39:16.860 --> 39:22.780
Knutwitskowski you will find the teamwork case scenario you will find a whole bunch of people

39:22.780 --> 39:29.580
who just ignored these guys in 2020 and these are teamwork case scenario these are people

39:29.660 --> 39:36.140
who are disingenuously representing the calamity as a potential billion people dead

39:36.780 --> 39:42.540
and the end of civilization as we know it that potential was implied on purpose so that people

39:42.540 --> 39:47.500
would transfect themselves so that people would think wow maybe I should get transfected because

39:47.500 --> 39:54.300
it can't be as bad as this virus that is something that was implied and we need to acknowledge that a

39:54.300 --> 40:04.700
lot of people we know implied it and now what's going on is that people who have the truth people

40:04.700 --> 40:14.220
that have the the real story that needs to be told are being silenced they are being given some

40:14.220 --> 40:22.380
attention and some fame but inevitably they themselves will not rise their story will not

40:22.460 --> 40:31.100
actually fully be told but it will be absorbed by someone else someone else who will seem to

40:31.100 --> 40:37.420
hat tip to them will seem to tell some of their story will seem to say hey this contribution is

40:37.420 --> 40:43.420
great but will leave out very key aspects of their contributions so that actually no one ever hears

40:43.420 --> 40:52.140
it I believe that this conference in Romania in Bucharest has a number of people that were

40:52.140 --> 40:56.380
invited to this conference in order that they would feel like their message was getting out that

40:56.380 --> 41:02.700
they were being heard that they were making progress that things were okay and in reality

41:02.700 --> 41:07.100
there were people there that were just simply going to make them feel that way and then step

41:07.100 --> 41:13.020
in front of them and promote them in a way that actually didn't move the narrative that didn't

41:13.020 --> 41:18.940
move the narrative of a novel virus that millions were killed by that millions of more were saved

41:18.940 --> 41:25.580
from it that that is intact even if there are people on this stage with data that shows that

41:25.580 --> 41:33.260
that can't be true that doesn't matter because the end result is the end message out of this

41:33.260 --> 41:38.220
this this conference was controlled and I'm going to show you how that is here's an example

41:38.780 --> 41:44.220
of someone who wasn't even at the conference but for some reason doesn't know that Denny

41:44.220 --> 41:49.100
Rancor's data shows that there's no evidence of spread that it can't cross borders and that

41:49.100 --> 41:55.580
the shot is killing the old people selectively which makes it even a worse idea listen carefully

41:56.220 --> 42:01.500
to this ask you about some things you told me in the break you're going to be testifying

42:02.620 --> 42:07.660
in front of Congress here about the vaccine and so forth and I played some things for

42:07.660 --> 42:11.100
people on the program here I played some things from a conference that was held in Romania here

42:11.100 --> 42:19.020
a few weeks ago where they had the graphs of the all-cause mortality all-cause mortality and how

42:19.020 --> 42:26.140
it spiked following the release of the vaccines from the different companies and their conclusion

42:26.140 --> 42:29.820
from all the numbers from all the countries and all the extrapolations they came up with this

42:29.820 --> 42:36.460
17 million people died globally roughly in their estimation from when you put out billions of

42:36.460 --> 42:41.500
vaccines 17 million was their takeaway does that strike you is shocking there's a strike you

42:41.500 --> 42:45.580
is believable what do you make of that I know you spent a lot of time looking at Anthony Fauci

42:45.580 --> 42:50.460
and the vaccines and all the things related to covid what do you make of such a claim

42:51.420 --> 42:58.620
the adjective is catastrophic it's a catastrophic biological safety disaster these vaccines that

42:58.620 --> 43:04.780
the the number was derived from a paper that was published by Dennis Rancourt from Canada

43:04.780 --> 43:13.180
and it's an ecological analysis that implies the vaccines have backfired instead of saving lives

43:13.180 --> 43:20.780
they've cost lives and in the United States you know our CDC is admitting to over 18,000 Americans

43:20.780 --> 43:25.660
have died after the vaccines people have reported this and they think the vaccines caused the death

43:25.660 --> 43:32.620
that's underreported probably 30 to 1 so in the United States we're approaching 600,000 American

43:32.620 --> 43:39.740
lives lost with the vaccine oh the 18,000 the CDC has recorded 1150 happened right in the vaccine

43:39.740 --> 43:45.500
center for a few hours afterwards so 600,000 is the number you're looking at

43:46.140 --> 43:54.780
caused directly by the injection this experimental application of mRNA technology however in the

43:54.780 --> 44:00.300
United States only I got it so 17 million is the number that you believe is is credible right

44:00.380 --> 44:06.620
that's what you're telling us 17 million globally 600,000 Americans I think those should be the

44:06.620 --> 44:15.500
numbers we should work with these are catastrophic this is worse than a war this is not a minor side

44:15.500 --> 44:20.780
effect or a minor issue there are calls to pull these vaccines off the market now for a long time

44:20.780 --> 44:25.500
from the world council for health the association of American physician surgeons I've made the

44:25.500 --> 44:31.260
call in the u.s. senate european parliament now florida surgeon general joel adapo says

44:31.260 --> 44:39.100
pull them off the market they're not safe so joel adapo said that there's a potential for

44:39.100 --> 44:43.820
dna integration some people on the other side are laughing that that's ridiculous

44:45.980 --> 44:52.380
and in this episode there's no mention of who dies of protocols or who might have died from

44:53.340 --> 44:59.500
um mistreatment in the hospitals even though I've heard him say elsewhere that this is there's

44:59.500 --> 45:09.500
iatrogenic um iatrogenic murders or or iatrogenic deaths um we didn't really hear it here and we

45:09.500 --> 45:17.580
are still um focused only on the shot um and not we're not focused on the fact that there's no

45:17.660 --> 45:22.860
evidence of spread and that's not necessarily something that can be done on this interview

45:22.860 --> 45:29.020
item not saying that that peter is doing bad here in this interview i just want you to see

45:29.660 --> 45:34.700
that we are still kind of stuck behind that ball and we need to find ways to get people to

45:34.700 --> 45:42.780
consider the possibility that that this that the no evidence of spread needs to be acknowledged

45:42.780 --> 45:47.660
they're fine with 17 million people being killed by by the transfection

45:49.500 --> 45:52.060
but they're going to keep calling them vaccines they don't want to call them

45:52.060 --> 45:56.220
transfections they're going to call them vaccines they're fine with that number but they're not fine

45:56.780 --> 46:00.940
with trying to think about how many people were killed by the hospital protocols how many people

46:00.940 --> 46:07.740
were killed by social changes that occurred um social measures that took their toll and hospital

46:07.740 --> 46:11.900
protocols that were were just plain deadly um

46:14.940 --> 46:21.020
so again uh what i want you to want to suggest here is that i don't think that

46:21.020 --> 46:27.020
denny rancor gave a poor presentation while he was in romania i think what it is is that

46:27.660 --> 46:34.220
the those people who were in romania that are responsible for maintaining

46:35.020 --> 46:41.180
the potential worst case scenario as an open possibility and i've been calling these people

46:41.180 --> 46:48.220
team worst case scenario these people have taken to promoting one particular part of denny rancor's

46:48.220 --> 46:54.300
data and that is the 17 million people number they are not at all interested in promoting the

46:54.300 --> 46:59.900
observation that it doesn't seem that any of these mash casualty events are spreading events

47:00.460 --> 47:04.860
they occur and then they disappear and he doesn't have an explanation for that

47:04.860 --> 47:11.980
he also doesn't notice a lot of all caused more uh increased all-cause mortality around the world

47:11.980 --> 47:19.020
at the time of the covid spread in the united states there are a few mass casualty events but

47:19.020 --> 47:26.780
nothing really big deal except for in new york so it's a very odd situation that in reality what

47:26.780 --> 47:33.820
happens is it seems that a lot of old people a lot of old people sick people

47:35.180 --> 47:41.660
are killed in a few places and that protocols are used to kill people based on a test

47:43.420 --> 47:49.420
and that this all-cause mortality overlaps with the rollout of the shot

47:49.420 --> 47:57.660
that this all-cause mortality doesn't really come out in the wash unless you look at specific

47:57.660 --> 48:05.820
places and it doesn't cross any borders even counties in america and so just that statement

48:05.820 --> 48:10.380
alone you would think would interest brett weinstein you would think it would interest

48:11.180 --> 48:16.620
it would interest jessica rose but those two curiously have not covered at all you would think

48:16.620 --> 48:22.060
you would interest uh mary nash she's writing a lot of of sub-stacks lately and blog posts

48:23.340 --> 48:28.140
you'd think that she would be interested in that key observation that the shot seems to be really

48:28.140 --> 48:38.620
hurting old people that's a very very very curious pattern here another thing that all of these

48:38.620 --> 48:44.060
people seem to be non-plus by is the presentation that nick hudson gave there i don't know what it

48:44.140 --> 48:49.180
was i didn't get to see a copy of it but i'm pretty sure it was pretty tight on the idea that the

48:49.180 --> 48:57.260
numbers don't support the declaration that it was aatrogenic murder i'm pretty sure that's what

48:57.260 --> 49:01.580
nick hudson would have said when he was on stage i've seen him presented elsewhere

49:03.100 --> 49:11.020
and they have wholly ignored him nobody's mentioned him literally no one that was at this

49:11.500 --> 49:15.660
conference has mentioned him yet i don't want to say literally there i just blew it

49:16.620 --> 49:23.020
actually no one at this conference that has blogged about it has mentioned nick hudson's talk

49:26.300 --> 49:32.220
and so what i want you to see here is how i believe and i think other people have noticed

49:32.780 --> 49:34.860
that this narrative is probably curated

49:35.260 --> 49:41.420
it is curated by people who are committed to this narrative can committed to this faith

49:41.980 --> 49:50.620
and protected at all costs and that is indeed their job that's how this pandemic was created

49:52.860 --> 49:59.420
there have been people who it was their job to move a little money and take a little salary and

50:00.060 --> 50:02.300
collaborate with some chinese labs

50:05.500 --> 50:11.500
write some grand proposals and some papers that imply pandemic potential

50:12.460 --> 50:19.100
none of the papers that we've ever seen from the wiv or from ralph barrick's lab have shown us pandemic

50:19.100 --> 50:26.700
potential but have implied that the measurements or the manipulations that they've made in combinations

50:26.780 --> 50:31.900
with the observations have changed indicate the pandemic potential exists

50:33.260 --> 50:38.780
the only other way that we have any existence of it are who declared pandemics of sars and mares

50:41.980 --> 50:46.940
they've also conducted upper level exercises drilling the response to a gain of function

50:46.940 --> 50:55.820
bio-weapon pandemic whatever from crimson contagion to clade x to dark winter

50:57.260 --> 50:59.820
all the way to event 201 of course

51:03.500 --> 51:07.900
and so seeding mash casualty events with the complications it's expected for the

51:07.900 --> 51:12.140
transfection expected for the countermeasure they already knew they were going to transfect

51:12.140 --> 51:21.020
people because they already knew mederna and anovio were the top runners we saw anovio's

51:21.020 --> 51:28.940
video on the bbc like they were the top one of the top in running potential vaccine candidates

51:30.940 --> 51:38.300
we saw the the vats of of the the spike protein dna being grown behind the lady of the bbc who

51:38.300 --> 51:45.980
said that she could smell it and so they knew that they were going to transfect us to the spike

51:45.980 --> 51:55.420
protein the question is is that spike protein a a biologic which has been altered in a way that

51:55.420 --> 52:04.540
maybe a company like epivacs in in road island might alter a protein by adding a specific epitope

52:04.540 --> 52:13.100
to it an epitope that your immune system couldn't ignore did they then seed that that protein

52:13.100 --> 52:17.100
in certain places around the world so that it would be sequenced and reported

52:19.580 --> 52:23.340
and so that when they rolled out the countermeasure that was already planned

52:24.140 --> 52:27.820
as a change to transfection when they rolled out this countermeasure

52:28.540 --> 52:34.780
that it would already have an immunogen built into it that it would already have an epitope inside

52:34.780 --> 52:39.180
of this spike protein that they just decided after 45 minutes to start running with it

52:41.180 --> 52:45.900
that that wouldn't be just serendipitously a highly immunogenic protein that would make a

52:45.900 --> 52:52.300
robust immune response after 20 after five transfections but it would have been a planted pre-designed

52:52.380 --> 52:59.180
protein to have the right epitope or epitopes so that when people were transfected by it they

52:59.180 --> 53:04.700
would show a robust response but also come with some complications that they would just

53:04.700 --> 53:14.460
seed into the narrative of the lab leak seed into the narrative of the spreading pandemic in the first

53:14.460 --> 53:20.140
year or two years depending on how long it would take to actually start the transfections

53:22.700 --> 53:27.100
some people have posited that it was supposed to be longer than it was

53:27.900 --> 53:34.460
and that something changed to make them speed up this whole schedule it was supposed to be two

53:34.460 --> 53:38.780
years until the vaccine came out i know that vince and racquet yellow said that i know that mark

53:38.780 --> 53:45.180
kulak has hypothesized that but without a doubt the most one of the most important things

53:45.740 --> 53:52.860
was to have a team worst case scenario several team worst case scenarios on network news on

53:52.860 --> 54:01.260
social media in the backwaters of the dark web of the internet ready and waiting

54:03.660 --> 54:10.460
already primed to speculate about the worst case scenario billion people dead you better

54:10.460 --> 54:16.540
make some masks might as well lock down we need a lot more than 15 days this is a red dragon event

54:16.540 --> 54:22.540
maybe you know remdesivir works but everybody else is dying people are dropping dead in the

54:22.540 --> 54:28.460
street look at this video look at that video those people were real i know because they sucked me

54:28.460 --> 54:34.460
in i know because they chatted with me offline i know because they called me i know because they

54:34.460 --> 54:41.020
came to my house i know because they've shook my hand i've known because they've taken pictures

54:41.020 --> 54:43.900
with me i know because they've lied to my face

54:49.180 --> 54:54.300
and the fact of the matter is this was a national security response it's a national security

54:54.300 --> 55:00.300
operation so very many of these people that we've been looking to for help and guidance may very

55:00.300 --> 55:06.540
well be restricted in what they can say may very well be participating in such a way that

55:06.540 --> 55:13.020
makes it impossible for them to contribute to our freedom impossible for them to help

55:13.020 --> 55:20.940
actually save our kids and so the toxicity of an imaginary virus has been conflated with the

55:20.940 --> 55:29.500
toxicity of a very real transfection that may or may not be the real transfection of a real

55:29.500 --> 55:35.900
immunogen that has been designed to stimulate our immune system it doesn't necessarily have to

55:35.900 --> 55:42.540
be nonsense it doesn't necessarily have to be badly made it could have had doses and and lots

55:42.540 --> 55:48.380
that were well made well taken care of reasonably well prepared and actually transfected this very

55:48.380 --> 55:53.980
live protein which could have toxic effects which are beyond that of just expressing a foreign

55:54.060 --> 56:00.460
protein in yourselves which we already know by definition would be very dangerous

56:01.980 --> 56:06.060
especially in any mammal that you wanted to live a long happy life afterward

56:07.340 --> 56:12.460
but nonetheless we have all been fooled by this teamwork case scenario to accepting the

56:12.460 --> 56:18.780
pandemic potential and bad caves in culture in animal passage and in genetic stitching

56:19.340 --> 56:22.060
and the reason why is because they want our kids sovereignty

56:23.900 --> 56:29.740
and so they have fooled us into this believing that all these people agree from Fauci to Malone

56:30.700 --> 56:35.340
that there is a worst case scenario that could be worse than a nuclear weapon from rixie

56:36.060 --> 56:44.140
to to kim.com from Sam Harris all the way to Brett Weinstein they all agree Sam Harris and

56:44.140 --> 56:49.660
Brett's Weinstein both agree the gain of function is real and that this could be the worst case

56:49.660 --> 57:00.460
scenario and if it wasn't the next one will be 75 mortality Brett and and John Campbell and

57:00.460 --> 57:09.980
Joe Rogan and and and Mike Osterholm and and Ron Fauci in the Netherlands and all of these people

57:09.980 --> 57:16.540
all agree that this is real and so there's really no debate anymore

57:17.900 --> 57:22.540
they've really fooled us into accepting this because for three years we were solving their

57:22.540 --> 57:27.420
mystery we were unmasking the bad guys and then the bad guys were confessing to us

57:29.580 --> 57:34.780
that's what we've been watching is this fake Scooby-Doo where they diminish the value

57:34.780 --> 57:38.060
and the expertise of our national health care societies and international health

57:38.060 --> 57:44.380
exercise like the WHO and the CDC however they they I think those are our bodies that are built

57:44.380 --> 57:51.020
for peacetime and not for war and we're at war right now with this virus and we're at war with

57:51.020 --> 57:59.180
this virus right now you see he's giving a message that he's told to give it's almost certain in my

57:59.180 --> 58:04.380
mind that he was co-opted that he was absorbed by this national security priority that's why he

58:04.460 --> 58:09.500
got to write a book about ivermectin and spends most of his time talking about ivermectin it's

58:09.500 --> 58:15.820
part of this if you solve the mystery of ivermectin and ivermectin studies and ivermectin

58:15.820 --> 58:21.820
effectiveness you have already accepted that there is a virus from which you need saving

58:23.500 --> 58:30.700
you have already accepted a monster that's behind you you've already accepted bad guys need unmasking

58:30.860 --> 58:38.380
and that's not where we are because the mystery virus does not equal excess deaths until you

58:38.380 --> 58:45.020
do the math and nobody will do this math nobody on at the government will do the math nobody on

58:45.020 --> 58:50.620
the news will do the math none of these mystery virus people will do the math they've all accepted

58:50.620 --> 58:56.700
the pandemic they've all accepted it and they all ignore all of these things they have to they have

58:56.780 --> 59:04.060
to ignore all of these things otherwise there was no spread they have to ignore all this fraud

59:04.060 --> 59:08.780
or there was no spread they don't talk about any of it anymore none of it

59:13.100 --> 59:20.540
and so we've seen Brett Weinstein on the the less the Lex Friedman podcast talking about

59:20.540 --> 59:26.620
the potential lab leak the idea that zero covid is still possible we heard him say that

59:27.740 --> 59:32.140
and we've heard lots of other people say that we've actually heard some people say that

59:32.140 --> 59:38.540
and demicity is the worst case scenario in a lab leak because that means that you didn't

59:38.540 --> 59:43.420
lock down harden you didn't control the spread and that it became endemic and that you're stuck

59:43.420 --> 59:49.740
with it forever we've heard people say that this is the kind of immunomythology that they want our

59:49.740 --> 59:57.020
children to believe just happened to them and we can't let it this was also this was also

59:57.020 --> 01:00:03.820
brought on us by bad ideas that were spread the the actual Scooby-Doo that I call the mystery of

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:11.820
the lab leak virus whatever was seeded by people like Yuri Dagan and Brett Weinstein

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:19.020
Yuri Dagan is a member of drastic he's one of the people that voted me out because I wanted

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:26.460
to study the transfection and Brett Weinstein had him on his podcast to see that Scooby-Doo

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.500
narrative back in the day that helped me to believe that that was really a mystery worth solving

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.020
and I kept coming back to the idea but if our immune system can handle it because it's just a

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:45.100
coronavirus then who cares what is this story really about why is everybody so interested

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.060
in making it a lab leak but of course if you make it a lab leak then people are scared enough to

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:55.260
take a transfection if you make it a lab leak then it makes sense that that heart attacks are

01:00:55.260 --> 01:01:03.260
caused by this crazy virus kidney failures are caused by this crazy virus it's multi systemic

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:14.620
inflammatory nuttiness and so that's how they got us they got us to solve the mystery they got us

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:20.540
to play Scooby-Doo they got us to believe that we were teenagers watching the the adults argue

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.340
and the adults kept making mistakes that led us to believe that wow the adults are lying to us

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.340
and finally we trapped a couple of these people and pulled off their mask and lo and behold there's

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.620
Peter Dasek there's Tony Fauci there they are

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.660
so what I've got here for you is a video that was sent to me by one of my viewers

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.340
who I really who's sub-stack I really should be plugging right now but I'm not plugging it so

01:01:53.340 --> 01:02:03.100
I'm gonna do it tomorrow this is a a video that was prepared for a university in Australia

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:08.860
who was teaching a course to undergraduates called biosecurity and

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.300
okay I'm not gonna remember it but again I'm gonna find it but it was a

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.780
biosecurity and like global health or something like that and so this is a five-part movie that

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:28.220
has been merged all into one it's not that long and it's a movie doing a scenario about

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:35.420
a impending pandemic so I want you to listen to this and realize that what this is his part of this

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.620
illusion of consensus which was established already long long ago

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:54.620
as a inside and out assumption that you know if things go wrong if we get unlucky a pandemic

01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:01.900
could kill millions if not billions of people and that's what is implied here in these exercises

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:11.820
in these tabletop exercises and in these university courses where a very high level production

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:19.580
movie is made to spark discussion among the students about what a pandemic is and how to

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:28.380
manage it now if you hear that and see that this as part of that it's absolutely extraordinary

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:34.860
so just enjoy this please enjoy this because it's shocking the counterterrorism unit at

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:50.780
megalopolis okay so it's an imaginary place but they're all Australian

01:03:50.780 --> 01:04:09.900
thank you

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:17.660
marasoni maras alex a long time is it the flu that's what they're saying out of season that

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.460
sudden department of health hasn't heard anything i like how i'm just this source of

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:31.100
information after record it's always off the record so what do you want to do or rest the

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:35.820
flu i want to bring someone in who could identify whether this even is the flu well the sniffles

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:41.260
don't go away why was i put in charge of disease control and bioterrorism if no one is going to

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:48.300
take me seriously it presents just as big a threat as bombings or rogue gunmen bigger

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.460
i tell you what why don't you keep an eye on things and in the meantime i promise to wash

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.900
my hands and cover the mouth of a cough okay

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.540
so

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.540
doctor hardy what can you tell us about the flu outbreak well i'll say what i said this morning

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:19.820
the most likely cause is severe flu so please just take caution um just to make note antonia hardy

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:29.580
anthony fauci and tonya hardy anthony fauci just notice that

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:43.020
alex oh shit nice to see you too well you came halfway across the city with good news

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:48.300
hospitals are filling up but that's not why i'm here we initially saw the spread originating

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:55.260
from one place mandona primary school makes sense but looking closer there are multiple origins

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.180
whether so there's no common link between the clusters

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:06.780
terrorism let's not jump to any conclusions it could still be undetected chains of transmission

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:12.060
it could still be the flu but people are dying people die from the flu okay incubation period two

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:17.260
to seven days fever chills body aches a shortness of breath coughing still symptoms of severe flu

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:24.620
i don't think it's what what's wrong it's a dead toe update it's bigger than i thought

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:38.060
okay call me if anything changes bye so that would have been a pause for discussion i guess

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.500
oh truth dot com oh secret weapons and secret information

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:54.860
oh truth is spreading and it's doing anything about it so we did make a profit there's a university

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.820
and then a stand it will all be come here

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:10.780
they're sorry i'm working on it my wife is sick and she's in quarantine sorry later

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:22.700
flat white with one i've stopped taking sugar sorry that's fine actually i could use the energy

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.980
as a parliament are considering a full quarantine if it continues to grow which

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.020
looks likely none of these groups are known for chemical warfare we have guns knives

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:36.300
so yeah it's done so sorry sorry um we're having trouble finding the owner of our block is either

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:41.340
going through a router or a high tech encryption we'll keep working better sure sure where the

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:47.340
counter terrorism union and we can't even crack a conspiracy theorist website nobody kills 100

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.820
people just to kill 100 people you do it to send a message you do it to make a point

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:57.580
maybe they're waiting for the body count to grow pandemics a big business money fame prestige

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.100
what do you know about the university of men don't know it's a university they don't do with

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:10.060
this kind of thing plus its government fund it's super regulated oh it's wife died that's pretty

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:17.020
quick oh that is like a hour more dead you hear about frank's wife people are getting antsy

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:22.060
where days away from a full blown riot so it's a strain of bird flu but the lab test shows several

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.220
genetic mutations which means it's possibly engineered but no one's coming forward so so

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.300
that's all we that's all i know

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:39.100
i might have found something thank god that blog you sent me the one you thought was crazy

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.980
i did a little dig it the owner of the blog also posted on some forums in one of these forums

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:49.740
he mentions a secret lab which he says is connected to Antonia Hardy the university of

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:57.740
men donut but Hardy when she's head of research she's respected i mean he's not unheard of people

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:04.380
to go rogue what do you think i think it's a little too little to go on seven one three eight

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:10.220
four seven three seven six six if you want to talk didn't you say i never applied yeah

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:17.340
we've got a lot of news up it's Rachelle it's Alex i need a favor

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.980
now keep in mind the production level of this right this is for a course in australia

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:38.380
at the university of new south wales i think anyway the point is is that this is produced

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:43.900
for a university course and this level of production is not a joke but it's few that the

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.660
many are wondering how could this happen and why there are no answers

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:54.940
Hardy what do you think about the allegations that are for your research people are dying

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.300
we're working on a way to stop that but aren't the allegations true me party

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.100
the university is currently suing the owner of that blog for defamation

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:09.500
does that answer your question do we know who owns the blog well we don't know who runs the blog

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:15.020
she either does or she doesn't she's not suing them maria did you just see the news

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:20.300
is this Alex Papalia my name is Joia i'm sorry i don't know who that is i run the truth

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:28.700
meet this uh yeah joey uh tell me about the secret lab i used to work at the university

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.100
oh you have to sell the lab wish you would

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.020
joey so what happened at this lab right

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.620
don't do joey you know me break the police

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:48.140
ha the witness got killed did you hear the bullet did you guys hear the bullet the bullet was

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.020
he killed him wow look at that the guy knew of the secret lab and then he killed him he was

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:59.100
going to whistle blow and say go to this address find anything you can grab lucy on the way get

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:04.060
her to find me everything that she can on joey addams at nton get hardy and find every employee

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:10.620
at the university men donor named rick or richard or ricki this came for you uh oh

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:25.260
no no time for character arcs indeed oh he got a usb stick i wonder what was on it

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:35.660
oh he's gonna put it in right now type it's not a virus

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:53.100
oh wow oh all right get this printed joe joey addams ex-employee at mandurne university research

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:59.500
scientists fired in 2012 for workplace harassment richard phalst known to his co-workers as rick

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.340
head of private security at the university ex-military ex-drawal ex-corp too

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:08.220
hardy's preface posting because she just carries him with her like a handbag and this is hardy

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:20.940
let me call you back i hope you know more than last time elix i've spoken with judge turner to

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:25.580
a ranger warrant i'm assembling a small team to bring antonia hardy in she's one of the few people

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.300
working on a vaccine i believe she's already developed i spoke with an ex-employee of always

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:36.380
told me about a secret lab for off-the-record research there are documents and emails from

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:41.420
heidi referring to the virus from before the outbreak so he's not worried at all that the

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:46.620
guy got shot on the phone we're not we're not that's not part of the story you know only more do you

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:53.900
notice that that it's just about the it's about the lab now it's not about the fact that in addition

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:59.180
to all this evidence the guy got shot while he was on the phone with me that might corroborate

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:06.140
your claim a little more it's it's funny how he ignores that simply killed i believe by hardy's

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:10.460
head of security somebody didn't want him talking and all he was talking about was hard and uh

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:16.220
turn it just gave you the warrant well no i was hoping that you would vouch for me oh no he just

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:22.140
said it right there sorry it's not a part of it i need to send a unit to the address just as reconnaissance

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:27.980
if you're wrong Alex i'm not wrong

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.180
you got a warrant getting is the unit president right there on the way but Alex we couldn't get

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:39.100
full protective care they said it was a waste of money and unnecessary well what do they go

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:58.300
okay the team we're about to reach the destination did you want to listen in Alex

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:20.620
what are they doing oh they're going to get that lady okay

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.340
oh they're spilling stuff

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:32.540
hold on there's someone here there's a gun put the gun

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.340
suspect down we're shooting fast

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:45.900
sitting out the back there's a trail of blood someone's been dragged

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.540
they're sent almost Alex unbelievable

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:59.980
let's go get hardy again remember they're teaching students with this video what are they

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:07.900
teaching this i did it for my country a few thousand people from your country i did people die all

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:16.700
the time i created the vaccine you created the disease i saved millions i will be remembered

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.020
Alex can i see you for a second

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:29.980
that's Antonia Hardy she created the virus and the vaccine

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:37.660
Antonia Hardy what she submitted to everything she wanted to be famous narcissist or but

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:41.980
she's a psychopath i'm not saying anything different but it's not going to be a trial

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.620
no either you have to let it go i'm sorry Alex

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.420
makes you feel any better she'll be monitored for the rest of her life she won't build her

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.660
so much as even looking at the test you

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:04.220
done done done he did a good job he did a great job you found her

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:15.660
that's fantastic dr Hardy said the recent outbreak has made her realize how important

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:20.300
family is and how easily the things we love can be taken away

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:25.820
cardie's team discovered the vaccine late last night i shut it to think what could have been

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:32.140
if they hadn't channel 22 news would like to wish that so it also implies that vaccines are

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:38.780
just the way you can switch it off at the remote right wow hey oh yeah better they're also going

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:44.540
to do it here what happened yeah yeah hottie's been loaded as a hero it's exactly what she wanted

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.780
well the government was too invested in their work they had to lie yeah the government told

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.500
the truth happened anybody trust them anyway i just wanted to stop by and say good work

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:59.500
it's a shame it took an emergency to get us working together off the record always off the record

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:05.660
i gotta go as everything going at the department administering the vaccine counting the dead i'm

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:11.420
still technically on sick leave we should grab a coffee catch up we'll stay

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:22.220
i mean love interest in the end of the movie it's it's amazing it's an amazing it's it's an

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:30.780
educational film in five parts for a course in australia a place where they locked everybody down

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:39.740
and they did it hard look i'm going to go a little faster here maybe i can go to the end

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.980
sorry about that all you starring people just let's see where it ends here at what what they

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:55.260
show at the end i want this to end like the breakfast club yeah that would be nice here look look

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:11.180
what did i dismiss it come on you demon so the university of north new new south whales i think

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.940
is that one paper moose i guess is the what what made it but then king's college london

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:23.180
arizona state king's college london is where they did all that that modeling and stuff right that

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:29.100
that was one of the worst places in the universe for thinking about the pandemic and then australia

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:34.860
again is where they they really really locked down in australia and people accepted it or at least

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:40.940
we were made to see in in america that they basically accepted it i don't know how much

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:47.500
they really resisted i'm sure there were resistors but um so that's that's pretty phenomenal right

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:53.580
because i remember it's not only about what they did during the pandemic but what how they got people

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:59.660
to participate in this his regular exercises before the pandemic that drilled them into

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:05.740
believing that this is how the trains stop this is how the train starts when we declare a pandemic

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:11.900
we need your help we need your help we need you to get alongside this train and start pulling and

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:18.380
pushing and they make these people feel if you want a metaphor for this they make these people

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:24.540
feel as though if there's enough people on the train then you actually don't know for sure if

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:31.100
you're not helping maybe we are doing this and the people that participate in this little charade

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.540
with this guy actually start to convince themselves the more people that participate

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:42.300
they start to convince themselves that they're actually helping it's a bit like a tug-of-war

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:47.340
at a certain moment if there's enough people on the rope it's really actually hard to tell how

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:52.380
much you're contributing and at any given time if you lose your footing and you're not pulling on

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:58.380
the rope at all the rope doesn't suddenly slide away because the contribution that you make is

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:04.540
relatively small and the more people that you stack up on the side of this train the harder it is for

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:10.700
any individual person to say hey am i really helping stop this pandemic am i really helping

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:17.500
with the dissident movement and so much of the dissident movement is based on the idea that

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.620
people thought they were helping they were told they were helping they were told this is how you

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:29.180
can help you can help us by perpetuating these narratives and these discussions you can help

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:35.660
us by leading these discussions you can help us by making sure that we don't have any of these

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:44.700
discussions and so everyone as part of a national security priority was enveloped

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:53.020
in this elaborate exercise that made it seem like to the populace that there was an ongoing

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:59.980
response to an ongoing spread of a novel pathogen for which everyone was vulnerable and they all

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:07.100
agreed on that and by agreeing on it and agreeing to argue or not argue about these things

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:12.780
there were hundreds of people lined up against this train making us believe that they were stopping

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:21.180
and starting it that they were doing what was necessary and they weren't they were actually

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:29.100
doing the opposite they were sustaining an illusion that the worst case scenario potential of a pandemic

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:35.900
exists and is ongoing and that evidence for it includes the need for novel

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:44.780
treatments it includes the obvious obfuscation of effectivity of these novel treatments

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:53.500
so the whole fiasco about ivermectin and about hydroxychloroquine and the patently obvious fact

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:58.780
that some of these trials were just dumb done in the wrong way with the wrong doses and the

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:04.780
wrong timing made it possible for there to be a very vigorous debate about how ridiculous it was

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:09.980
that the government was covering up the effectiveness of these otherwise underutilized drugs

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.860
it's not for nothing that those trials were designed so poorly

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:23.740
it's so that this limited spectrum but very vigorous debate within it could be created

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:28.380
and maintained by these people and they are still maintaining it today

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:36.540
it is something that was so aptly described by our friend or used to be friend gnom Chomsky

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:41.260
smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of a acceptable

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:46.060
opinion but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum even encourage the more critical

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:55.660
and dissonant views even amplify using algorithms even amplify using fake or pseudo censorship

01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:04.300
those limited spectrum of debate narrative curators like Brett Weinstein, Eric Weinstein,

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:14.060
Robert uh uh Joe Rogan, all these people, Alex Berenson and if you'd have got in the car with any

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.220
of those people when the novel virus was declared and that millions of people were dying from it

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:22.540
if you'd have gotten in the car with any of these people like I did you would have been fooled

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:28.380
and it would have mattered who you got in the car with they all agreed that there was a novel

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:34.460
virus they all agreed that millions of people were killed they all agreed that terrible things were

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:39.260
done but a lot of people were saved under the lockdown I mean they all agreed that gain a

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.020
function was a possibility they all agree it's going to come again Robert Malone does too

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.500
not too long ago Robert Malone did a left turn right turn left turn maneuver

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:58.140
that involves saying that that Robert F Kennedy junior wasn't as good of a presidential candidate

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:07.980
as as Donald Trump put his hat in the ring for Donald Trump and said that some evidence of of

01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:13.820
things not going so well for Robert F Kennedy junior was the amazing organization CHD

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:25.020
and it's it's it's shocking because again Robert Malone's book is published by CHD's own own label

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:33.020
and that when he needed help and looked for for some support when he decided to to jettison his

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.900
career to save mankind more likely to try and claim a Nobel Prize

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:46.140
that this guy went to CHD for help went to Bobby for help and found it they published his book

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.260
and now after attending Bobby's announcement in Boston

01:24:53.020 --> 01:25:00.060
and hugging the scientific advisor for Bobby and for CHD for many years Meryl Nasse at that

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:06.300
event in front of everyone less than a year later he's throwing Bobby under the bus for Donald Trump

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:13.900
and CHD under the bus for Donald Trump strange the only organization one of the only organizations

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:19.260
in America really fighting for children's health it's right there in the name

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:29.420
or proximal is what was the what were the origins of the virus that we're starting to get down to

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:35.420
breast axon and there's been all these other theories about whether it was released during

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:43.340
the military games etc that that right now is unsubstantiated rumor but we do have documentation

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:51.020
for is a cast now it's so bizarre for him to mention that because again we have George Webb

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:57.980
on 60 minutes in February of 2020 talking about how the American military may have released the virus

01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:06.300
at the Wuhan games in October of that year and actually they did a whole stunt about him on 60

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:15.740
minutes with regard to censorship on social media Robert Malone declares George Webb is one of his

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:22.700
worst cyber enemies and has said it repeatedly and included him on a list that I'm also on

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:30.380
now it's very interesting that he now mentions the Wuhan games as being an unsubstantiated rumor

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:36.220
again that's another hat tip to George Webb it's an interesting hat tip to someone that he says is

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:43.180
just a medler a continuous hat tip over many articles over many mentions over many live links

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.940
and now yet another one let's go on to who else does he tat tip in this discussion

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.900
creative events that happened in the fall of 2019 involving the Wuhan Institute of

01:26:53.900 --> 01:27:03.660
Virology and before that receding that involved uh eco-health alliance Peter Dazzack and uh USAID

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:14.380
and uh DITRA I broke the DITRA story uh and uh NIH and others uh including the CIA interacting

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:20.780
with the Wuhan Institute of Virology so those are the things that we can document those are the

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:25.100
things that we can document and we can document them in lots of books and in fact if you want

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:32.620
documents of that that probably the best book and it's a book that's got some biology of mine in it

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:37.020
is this one right here I think this one is probably the best book that documents that work and in

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:46.220
fact on the back of this book Robert Malone says let's see if we could do this here um Robert

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:56.300
Malone says did that not work here Robert Malone says this book is the most comprehensive historic

01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.460
summary and indictment of the history of the United States BioWarefare Bio Defense program

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:08.060
ever written. Summarizing an amazing sweep of untold censored his untold censored history

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:15.260
the Wuhan cover-up offers a case study demonstrating the consequences of the situational ethical slide

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:21.420
which often occurs when a massive administrative bureaucracy fuses with an intelligence community.

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:27.180
Interesting among the other people who said good things about the book Meryl Nass is down here

01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:35.900
Peter McCullough, Gavin De Becker, David Stockman, Francis Boyle, Tucker Carlson and Naomi Wolf.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:45.340
Interesting interesting interesting so that's the book I'd recommend um so let's keep listening here

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:52.620
okay and uh we can go through all of these things you know one by one by one I know let's just talk

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:57.900
about let's just talk about what you said about the FDA so I had Sasha Latipova on the podcast and

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:05.100
she was very clear about this these are countermeasures and it's DoD and DARPA yeah you know when Sasha

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:14.860
Latipova says a lot of shit and she attacks me all the time she says a lot a lot of shit and she

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:21.980
attacks me all the time now there's something that I've been applying for a while on Twitter and

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:28.620
on the soapbox and I want to emphasize it here again I think that Robert Malone in his sub-stacks

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.660
where he's made a list of all the people that he thinks are bad guys most of those people on that

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:38.940
list are actually actors most of that people on those lists are actually in some way or another

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:44.460
coordinating their behavior with him even if it just means that they're pretending to antagonize

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:52.140
one another but are coordinatively pretending or rather protecting the the narrative of the

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:58.540
novel virus that was likely from gain of function and so I would argue that his suing of the

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:06.940
Breggans was uh not real I would argue that his antagonizing of George Webb is not real I would

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:14.060
argue that because of his streaming with repeatedly somebody like Paul Catrell who is

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:21.740
actually a fake medical doctor promoted by George Webb there's also reason there the list goes on

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:32.380
for a very very long list of reasons why it is absolutely um absolutely to note that right now

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:37.500
there is little or no difference between what Robert Malone says in this interview and what

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:43.180
is said on television now the argument that I want to make here is that on that list of people

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:52.620
that he says are bad guys include Sasha La Topova but Sasha La Topova and he have been on stage

01:30:52.620 --> 01:31:00.300
together in Europe multiple times so it's hard for me for me to believe that somehow or another

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:06.780
they've had this huge falling out now and that hers say suggesting that somehow or another the

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:14.300
DoD or something like that is involved is somehow offensive to Robert Malone she said that on stage

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:22.380
next to him before on the same stage where also Merrill Nas was sitting in Stockholm Sweden

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:29.660
so there can be no doubt that something strange is happening when he has

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:37.980
very rarely lost his composure but suddenly decides here to lose his composure about Sasha

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:45.100
La Topova again someone who he's presented with internationally more than once uh as part of this

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:50.060
dissident movement that he's engaged in let me just escape out of here

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.940
and restart this slide to make sure we get it going correctly again

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.940
or proximal is what was the what were the origins of there's a lot of people that think that Sasha

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:12.140
La Topova actually is over says a lot of shit and she attacks me all the time okay she she

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:16.700
there's a lot of people that think that Sasha La Topova actually is controlled opposition

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:23.900
so hey she makes a lot of statements that are unsubstantiated and if you look at the documents

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:31.020
they are not nearly what she asserts they are okay but can i just clarify them i am i'm like

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:35.340
Sasha i'm actually an expert in government affairs and writing government contracts and

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:41.420
regulatory affairs okay i know what i'm talking about i have written OTA contracts

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:49.820
i know those clauses intimately okay i also did the deep dive into the emergency health

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:58.780
regulation documents and what they stipulate they stipulate uh for for declaration of emergency

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:10.300
that the DoD will be involved now Sasha makes wild claims that this is a DoD controlled operation

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:17.020
okay i haven't seen that documentation what i've seen is the clear documentation that

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:26.860
operation warp speed was conceived of by Bob Cadwick and Peter Marks that is well documented

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:36.060
okay those neither one of those are DoD personnel Bob Cadwick may well be CIA i don't know that for

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:41.580
a fact but there's a lot of things around him that suggest that that's the case but he is not DoD

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:47.900
okay those are the two that created operation warp speed and we're now deep in the bowels

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:57.820
of nitpicking out what actually transpired who did what okay and uh the what she so for instance

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:04.620
the uh i'm not sure if he's a lieutenant colonel or colonel now it was appointed

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:16.940
to head up the Moderna focus group by US government because he had prior experience in Ebola during

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:25.340
which time i mentored him came to me about a year and a half ago and and seemed to want to

01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:31.500
unburden his soul about what transpired in those meetings and the dose selection for Moderna

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:39.820
but he was not driving the bus the DoD was not driving the bus it was essentially a selection

01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:46.300
of DC bureaucrats working in public private partnership with Moderna that's that's what

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:51.980
that's the facts so it could have been so it could have been him she wants and she can attack me

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:57.340
until the cows come home but okay i know what i'm talking about okay okay i think i think i didn't

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.340
mean to mention i didn't realize she was attacking it by the way i don't um know about all this

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:08.060
stuff so i think it's it's trick or shit roby and others just go on and on and on right let's move

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:14.700
on from that so i think that that's that's nonsense um i'm going to i'm going to throw that out there

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:21.900
as the main message of this stream i don't think that sasha latipova and robert malone have an actual

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:29.020
rivalry here at all and i don't think that this argument is a real argument because in the end

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.620
they're not arguing at all about placebo batches they're not arguing at all about protocols they're

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:39.820
not arguing at all about the role of the opioid deaths in the totals they're not arguing at all

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:46.140
about excess mortality they're not arguing at all about the the the usefulness of transfection

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.340
they're not arguing at all about any of the things that would save our children from being

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:58.060
trapped in this mythology they're arguing about stuff that doesn't matter who leaked the virus

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:05.500
who's responsible for rolling out the shot or orchestrating the whole thing the the military

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.820
was most likely involved and we've said it in that first slide in the orchestration of the mass

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:17.100
casualty events maybe the mash casualty event in new york city but for the most part the rollout

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:23.420
of the shot if it was coordinated by the military in any way it was not dictated by the military

01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:27.420
and that's what robert malone is probably telling the truth about here now let's

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:38.940
it was known that uh based on studies in stanford that the uh case fatality rate for infection

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.940
was about 0.02 percent that's j bonicharius

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:53.980
uh the pcr assay i remember you know in detail in the early situation um no one was allowed to run

01:36:53.980 --> 01:37:00.860
a pcr assay or a diagnostic assay in the first few months they all had to be shipped to cdc

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:08.540
who it turns out at a horrible test okay so it's interesting to say that then right

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:13.100
that no one was allowed to do pcr in a bench no one was allowed to do it you had to send all

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:19.260
the samples to the cdc think about that think about that for a minute with all the drive-throughs

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:24.940
think about that with all the drive-throughs what was going on there and how unlikely it is

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:31.260
that those samples remained relevant as they were transported from drive-throughs

01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:38.300
across the country to the cdc there's only one cdc there's only one building where this went on

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:45.580
so he's admitting that right now as part of the let's say wow what actually happened

01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:53.100
what did we actually do how did we decide to institute these protocols and why did we

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.700
choose remdesivir this is completely missing from this discussion it's interesting and we're

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.700
gonna go i want to play the rest of this video and then i want to remind some people or point

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.820
out some of the things that are just absent from this two-hour interview with with

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.660
amadmalaq it's it's on you know that's a whole nother

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:20.140
rat's nest or rabbit hole i know what's up well went on at cdc so can we just agree one thing you

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:24.060
know with john i knew these paper i think he's from stanford and the you know princess diamond

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:31.420
data i mean the only pandemic was one on paper would you agree with me just say yes say yes i

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:43.100
disagree oh damn it just say yes there was an infectious virus that circulated the globe

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:50.780
do you disagree you know what even if there was there was nothing novel about it is that not a

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:56.140
purity test there was a novel virus that circulated the globe do you disagree

01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:03.260
so there's the test right there it's all about sequences it's all about the sequencing if the

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:10.300
sequences aren't real then there was no novel virus if the sequences are not real there was no

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:18.860
novel virus we don't have any sequencing data from before 2020 we don't have any pcr data from 2020

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:26.380
never mind from before that so there is no data about the prevalence of this signal

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.660
before the pandemic because we weren't testing for it we didn't have tests that we thought were

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:37.260
specific for it we weren't sequencing for it because we didn't have a sequence primer set

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:42.700
that we thought was specific for it and those things all appeared after the declaration of the

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:48.540
pandemic and in fact he just said it that we didn't have a good pcr test so then we definitely

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:54.860
didn't have 99 primer sets that could be used to sequence the whole virus how does that work

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:05.020
how can we have a pcr test that doesn't have very good primers that's only found at the CDC

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:11.820
behind closed doors but but we were sequencing the virus how can we sequence the virus if we

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:19.580
don't have primers that are specific for it and then how did we develop the 99 primers that are

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:28.460
used in the Arctic sequencing primer set how does that work there are giant contradictions here that

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:36.380
we need to get down to the brass tacks about as mr boy said and that's what i think we need to

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:43.260
spend the next couple weeks doing is starting to get a really good understanding of how pcr

01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:48.700
is supposed to work how it was implemented how it wasn't implemented and how sequencing is

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:54.060
supposed to work how it was implemented how it wasn't implemented so that we can understand

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:59.100
exactly how bamboozled we have become because this guy is not going to clear it up for us this

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:04.220
disambiguation wizard is going to maintain this faith in a novel novel virus forever

01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:11.580
that's his job that's why he's here you know it's been around a long time come on that that is

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.620
that is just bullshit people people didn't die novel about it how about the fear and cleavage site

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:27.260
how about the fear and cleavage site four extra amino acids around 20 extra bases

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:33.340
how about the fear and cleavage site i mean at least you could have gone for the end of

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:39.100
nucleation sites right at least you could you could imply that it was a cloned coronavirus that

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:44.540
was made in a laboratory at least use the methodologies that would be relevant here

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:51.740
don't point out the fear and cleavage site that somebody as basic as as as Yuri Dagan said was

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.780
evidence for it being a a laboratory virus

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:04.540
don't use the one thing that charles rixie said made it the most transmissible virus in

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:10.380
history when we know that that's just nonsense what would those four amino acids do for the

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:18.460
replication competence of the virus what would those four amino acids do for the aerosol

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:26.060
transmission of the virus because these are again are things that rixie says and other people say

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:30.460
are very important it's a unique thing about this virus that it's not just by droplets it's

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:38.060
also by aerosol of course it is look at the size of these things and it doesn't matter if you add

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:45.580
a few more bases or a few more amino acids to the spike protein and this is the exact same illusion

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:51.500
that they did with the enrichment of avian flu and ferrets to make it aerosolized that

01:42:51.500 --> 01:43:01.980
was a mythology the aerosolization of avian flu using ferrets what molecular changes in these

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:05.900
proteins resulted in the aerosol transmission of flu

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:13.980
you see the mythology they've laid down they fooled us into believing something that just isn't

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:22.860
congruent with reality what changes could you make to a small lipoprotein coated RNA

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:32.140
thing that would change its aerosolizable properties with a few bases or a few amino

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:38.620
acids what do you couldn't you imagine i can't and certainly these people have not demonstrated

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:43.900
such a thing such a phenomenon and yet somehow or another the fear and cleavage site that he

01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:54.380
just mentioned was the source of debate lab or natural for more than two years it was the reason

01:43:54.380 --> 01:44:01.100
why it was so transmissible so dangerous so wacky and that's what they covered up that's what they

01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:08.060
lied about and then lo and behold that's what they were inserting in the in the diffuse proposal was

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:12.380
fear and cleavage sites into viruses that will then spray into bad caves

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:22.540
how about the fear and cleavage site says the disambiguation wizard Robert Malone

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:27.660
well that that is that is just bullshit people people didn't die novel about it how about the

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:34.460
fear and cleavage site the average life you just said is completely at odds with the data the

01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:41.180
sequence data so the sequence data is what it's at odds with the 15 000 sequences that we have

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:48.300
found are obviously evidence of a spreading pathogen it couldn't be a pre-existing background

01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:55.260
signal it couldn't be a confounded background signal it couldn't be nonsense it's gotta be

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:59.580
because the sequences it's at odds with the sequencing data a mad

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:07.900
Ahmed Dr. Malek don't you understand it's at odds with the sequencing data and Kevin McCurden can

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:15.020
tell you all about the sequencing data and you can't argue with him i mean what did they make him all up

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:30.060
ladies and gentlemen it is exceedingly odd that this many NATO members need to go to Romania

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:36.220
together that this many Americans need to go to Romania together what's really odd is how many of

01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:45.020
these Americans are tied to the anthrax vaccines in the 90s including Robert Malone

01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:53.500
Stephen Hatfield and Meryl Nass all involved in this really interesting song and dance

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:59.020
it had to do with old vaccines and new vaccines and whether they should be given or not given

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:09.900
everybody all these these three i mean what is Stephen Hatfield doing there how can he possibly

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:17.500
pretend to be a dissident when he wanted Barney masked at the beginning of the pandemic was telling

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:24.060
the worst stories about teamwork the teamwork case scenario could tell has been on the Bannon show

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:32.380
from the beginning till now and is now writing a book about hydroxychloroquine and how hydroxychloroquine

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:39.340
could have saved everybody and how it was sabotaged right in line with the Scooby-Doo

01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.580
goes right with all the other books that we show on this stream all the time it just fits right in

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:51.100
hell the hydroxychloroquine story is featured in this one as well

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:57.740
it's part of the narrative guys it's part of the way that they've convinced even the author of this book

01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:03.100
that there was a spreading pathogen that they were covering up for it that they were doing all kinds

01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:10.620
of nefarious things to make worst-case scenario come true that's what they tell in this book

01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:17.180
and it's not that far off from the truth because they did a lot of things and they sent a lot of

01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:24.220
people around the world and on a lot of podcasts to make sure that the worst-case scenario would

01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:33.740
be believed including by people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. including by organizations like

01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:42.700
CHD and ICANN Network and all the other organizations that probably should be stronger as dissident

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:49.180
organizations but have been weakened or sabotaged from the inside by people who are

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:53.580
associated with team worst-case scenario that's what I think is happening here that's what you see

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:04.220
none of these people on the back of this book are promoting it they're promoting their own books

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:10.620
they're promoting their own their own nonprofits they're not promoting CHD even those CHD permits

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:13.420
his books he's not going to promote CHD he's going to trash it

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:22.300
Meryl Nast is starting her own non-profit to oppose the who but why can't CHD oppose the who

01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:30.940
why do you need to take donors away from that organization and that wonderful cause that's

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.740
actually fighting the vaccine schedule and raising awareness that this is just one big scam

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:41.420
why would you ever want to break away from that organization to start an organization that

01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:49.740
opposes the who when CHD and and and those moms and dads that work there are opposing the vaccine

01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:56.220
schedule which really needs to be stopped in America it needs to be I mean come on

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:05.100
how are all these people abandoning that cause how can they have have gone from not knowing

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.140
what's going on to figuring out that all of this is a great big scam and then not

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.460
realize that the vaccine schedule in America is the biggest part of that scam

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:25.820
how is Jessica Rose not saying that all the time even though that she has a a program on CHD TV

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:30.620
how is she not saying that all the time even though she's on a program on CHD all the time

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:36.380
but they don't say that the vaccine schedule is criminal they don't talk about strict liability

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:39.180
they don't talk about the lack of spread why

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:51.980
why don't they do the math why can't the disambiguation wizard Robert Malone do the math why doesn't he

01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:57.980
talk about the protocols having killed a pretty significant portion why doesn't he talk about

01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:06.620
the fact that PCR could be misused it wasn't very useful before the pandemic why doesn't he

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:11.740
tell us all this stuff why doesn't he talk about the the projected Medicare costs that have been

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:19.420
saved by this lucky move he's definitely aware of him he's told you he's been an insider for years

01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:24.700
it's annoying because he knows what he's talking about he's been walking around these

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:34.940
backrooms for decades so he knows that strict liability would kill this whole field this whole

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:44.780
industry he knows that strict liability would end this entire industry he knows that that the CICP

01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:52.060
and the VICP and the kangaroo administrative court that that they represent is actually a

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:54.540
seventh amendment violation he's got to know that

01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:02.380
just like a lot of lawyers know that but don't do anything about it they don't say anything

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:07.500
about it because they're part of this narrative they're part of this narrative that was started

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:17.020
decades ago that has been perpetuated with with exercises behind the scenes and which was was

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:22.300
seeded by this military exercise to make sure that the countermeasures would be rolled out

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:29.020
successfully and that their toxicity would be confounded with that of the pathogen and therefore

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:37.660
they could successfully convert us from one type of crappy vaccine to a much more interesting one

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:44.620
to them because it's cheaper and it is the rolling out of gene therapies which they really need to

01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:50.060
test on people you can't test them on animals you need to test them on people

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:56.860
and they tell us the truth about this right they tell us the truth about this look

01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:03.180
I'm gonna I'm gonna insert it right here I'm gonna make a real change to this grad this thing

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:10.140
quick hold on just one second let me insert a video and let me let someone else tell you

01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:17.260
how this works because I think it's really important for you to understand how this works

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:26.860
and let me just do this really quick sorry it takes me just a second to get it in and here

01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:36.780
and this goes up there and it's there and then with it so here let's do this again thank you very

01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:45.580
much for that little chant so again we have these we we did papers we funded

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:51.340
research and implied that there was pandemic potential we told a bunch of people in bureaucracies

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:56.460
that there was pandemic potential and we funded those grants and then we seeded the narrative at

01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:02.220
the beginning using a team of worst case scenario actors in order to make sure that all of the

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:06.220
possibilities that would happen with the transfection of the novel protein

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:10.860
would actually be blamed on the virus and so that could be confounded and we used a national

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:15.500
security priority and to make sure that we can control these participants either the ones that

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:21.660
we trained or the ones that we co-opted oh um Tedros is going to be your doctor he will tell you

01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:27.500
what the what vaccines you must have what drugs you must have if there's a pandemic and what drugs

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:34.620
you're not allowed to have so you can forget ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine next time right um there's

01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:42.780
a lot more to it than that it's um the way they're going to push the 100 day vaccines is by shaving

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:49.580
time off of every part of vaccine development like safety and efficacy every single new i mean we

01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:54.060
just reported today right you have a new booster it's being tried on mice there's no human studies

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:59.340
being done these are brand new forms of the virus right if we're looking at some people

01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:03.820
to even argue that armacron wasn't the original virus to begin with so it's a different virus

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:08.060
and so whatever doesn't matter how much it changed if it's totally different we're just gonna try it

01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:13.340
on mice because hey our human trials went so well we don't even have to do that again right well

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:18.380
precisely you don't want to test it on humans because you might find out right it's not safe right it

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:24.620
doesn't work um what i want the audience to know is that you cannot do safety trials in animals

01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:30.300
it's impossible animals behave very differently than humans yeah you must vaccinate or give a

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.780
drug to humans and then you have to watch them and you have to watch them for a period of time like

01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:40.060
at least six months to find out what are the long-term side effects for vaccines you often get auto

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:45.260
immune effects and they can take a considerable time to develop yeah so testing on mice is like

01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:53.180
not testing at all um so if we want to be bound by these new amendments and a and new treaty

01:54:54.780 --> 01:55:03.180
basically we can say goodbye to democracy and freedom and so she's arguing that the who and the

01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:09.340
treaty that the who is is altering is going to is going to take away our democracy and our freedom

01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:14.060
she's not reminding you that we could just strike the prep act using a seventh amendment

01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:20.460
violation he's she's not reminding you that the vaccine act of 1986 could also be removed in theory

01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:26.300
we could just elect people that would write new laws or get rid of the ability for

01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:31.340
health and human services to declare an emergency these are things that America can do

01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:36.860
we can just step out of the who and stop giving money to them and so it's really weird because

01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.420
the solution that's offered is not really a very workable one and it's not a very

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.700
doesn't seem to be a very tangible one and more importantly she seems to be

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:53.580
enunciating very clearly what what marcoolac has implied and that is that they're trying to shift

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:59.100
us into accepting the fact that the only way we're going to ever learn how any of these potential

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:06.060
transfection technologies could be useful is to use them on people and so we are going to be

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.660
the test subjects

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:15.740
and and I think that this is a pretty accurate way of thinking about what they want to do with our

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:23.820
children they want them to surrender their sovereignty and their medical data to monitoring so that

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:32.380
that therapies can be tried that transfections can be can be or or other methodologies can be tried

01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:40.620
all under the pretense that because of the bonus that the the the basic methodology of

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:48.780
transfection was proven to fundamentally work by the pandemic then we have this huge problem

01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:55.180
where where we can be it can be substituted now we don't need to test it all because again it's

01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.940
checked out you know that message is coming and more or less that's the same message that

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:05.820
maryll's giving here she's just giving it to you in a more cynical and you shouldn't like it sort

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:11.900
of way but she's telling you why it is because testing these things in mice isn't going to do

01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:18.140
anything testing this stuff and mice isn't going to teach us anything so she's telling you the truth

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:26.540
just not really in my mind giving you a very tangible way to oppose that that the imposition

01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:33.100
of that truth the imposition of that new world order and that's because she's not really

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:37.260
freeing you from the idea that pandemic potential in badcaves is a joke

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:45.020
that pandemic potential in laboratories is a joke that the only real danger is infectious

01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:53.340
clones that could be made in quantity and that these self replicating RNAs could potentially

01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:59.980
cause symptomologies that could be misconstrued as viral spread and that virology is basically

01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:06.540
done using these molecular preparations and therefore the whole illusion of pandemic potential

01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:13.580
is essentially based on it and if this truth is forgotten if this lie becomes the truth then

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:19.660
we're in big trouble our kids are in huge trouble because the compartmentalization of biology is

01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:24.140
going to stay the same and then these kids are never going to never going to be able to break through

01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:33.340
it because once the liars are dead then the people that are perpetuating the teaching of the liars

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:38.140
are just just doing what they think their guru wants them to do right so we're really

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:45.580
at a crossroads here because it's it's it's even remotely possible that a lot of what

01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:51.660
Robert Malone says he believes because he was trained by some of these people who are the

01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:58.140
actual liars if Robert Gallo for example and and and David Baltimore are liars

01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:06.140
about the fundamentals of virology the fundamentals of cancer biology the fundamentals of molecular

01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:12.940
biology and with reference to these viral particles and retroviruses then all these people that have

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:18.060
learned from them as gurus they're in big trouble because they're trapped in that

01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:24.860
and maybe that's why Robert Malone is so annoyed right now because he is still trapped like I was

01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:31.420
trapped because I had limited experience with using adenovirus transfection therefore I figured

01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:38.220
well and other viruses must exist too when in reality adenovirus transfection might very well

01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:47.340
be just that a preparation so why are they creating this pandemic there's a million different

01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:53.020
reasons but the main one is to protect this mythology forever this immunomethology about viruses

01:59:53.820 --> 02:00:01.580
about pathogens that can be fought with with vaccination and this long history of this medical

02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:07.980
miracle they want the youth to submit to this they want the youth to accept it they want us

02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:16.140
to teach our kids that a pandemic happened and that mistakes were made they want our kids to grow

02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:21.420
out believing that some of those mistakes when corrected will result in a new normal

02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:29.500
and that new normal will be the fracturing of western civilization on this break and the

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:38.220
scattering of it to the wind we can't let our kids be beat we can't let this happen

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:45.580
can't let our kids get on this train and ride away can't let them grow up believing that

02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:51.900
epidemics have been stopped by vaccination we can't grow up we let them grow up in schools where

02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:57.100
this the science teacher is teaching that novel coronaviruses can jump and that that's what

02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:02.860
happened a few years ago we can't let science teachers in our schools teach that asymptomatic

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:09.340
spread is real and that masks can help stop that we can't let our science teachers in our high

02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:16.060
schools teach that gain of function research is real and that RNA can pandemic we can't

02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:20.380
we've got to get our kids off this train before it pulls out of the station

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:24.860
we've got to get our kids off this train before it pulls out of the station

02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:31.900
we've got to get our kids off this train before it pulls out of the station or we'll lose them forever

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:43.180
and so I think the way to pull them out and the way to pull our heads out is to realize that clones

02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:49.740
are a lot like viruses are a lot like mixtapes whatever they found whatever metabioda found

02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:57.900
whatever they purport to find as RNA signals in the wild are just ghosts and those ghosts don't grow

02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:04.860
they can't be copied and when they do copy them they are not very easy to copy they don't do it

02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:11.740
very well they fizzle out very quick they're not like CDs that you can make a mixed CD and then

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:17.020
make a copy of that mix and it'll be pretty good you can't do that with viruses viruses are RNA

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:24.700
RNA is single-stranded and no matter what it is in a bat no matter what it is in a human when

02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:29.580
you try to culture it it usually doesn't work it doesn't work it doesn't last you can't just

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:36.860
keep it going because it's changing all the time because it's making mistakes all the time because

02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:42.460
the vast majority of those particles are replication incompetent thank you Robert Malone the way that

02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:47.420
coronavirus has overcome this the coronavirus science biology has overcome this

02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:55.100
is they sequence these RNAs and then they make a DNA of them i'm going to escape for a second

02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:58.540
restart this slide because it's playing a little slow

02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:09.580
it's going to keep going slow it looks like so they can sequence the viruses and they can make

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:15.340
a DNA copy of them and those DNAs that's the equivalent of not the cassette tape but the CD

02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:21.980
and the DNA because it's double-stranded has a real proofreading mechanism and it can be grown

02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:29.980
with high fidelity in a bacterial culture bacteria will reliably replicate that DNA in

02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:36.380
high relatively high fidelity and so with a coronavirus and a very large genome like a coronavirus you

02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:44.220
might need to use five different plasmids here in this diagram five different plasmids to constitute

02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:49.980
the whole genome of the coronavirus but then after you do that you can you can take this

02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:55.660
bacteria out of these cultures you can lice them you can take the DNA out of them you can

02:03:55.660 --> 02:04:01.660
ligate the DNA together and then using RNA polymerase or applying it to a cell culture

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:08.700
using electroporation or something else you can convert it to RNA if you use a commercial

02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:14.140
enzyme like RNA polymerase like a t7 RNA polymerase then you can you will get errors

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:22.220
but the DNA that you start with will be pretty darn close to pure which means that the RNA that

02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:29.340
you produce will also be pretty darn close to pure it will be a very high quantity of that RNA

02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:37.580
and it will be much much much more pure and abundant at a higher concentration than anything

02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:44.940
that could be produced from the sample that you found in nature thousands if not hundreds of

02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:51.180
thousands of times more concentrated more pure than anything that you could generate from the RNA

02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:58.060
sample that you find in nature and because you made it in DNA you can make as much as you want you

02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:02.220
can go back to the DNA as often as you want and anytime you make RNA you can

02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:08.380
create cell cultures that will show cytotoxic effect you can create animal models that will

02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:13.740
show immune reaction and you can send it to other laboratories so that they can do those things

02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:19.500
you could also make an industrial size amount of it and you could deploy it

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:27.820
and effectively transfect people with the RNA that you make if it has an RNA dependent RNA

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:31.900
polymerase then you're essentially trying to make self-replicating RNA and then you could spray

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:38.940
that around and everywhere you sprayed it it would be detectable by PCR because that RNA could be

02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:44.060
converted with RNA or with reverse transcriptase to DNA and then you could do a PCR reaction on it

02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:51.100
so infectious clones or the DNA that is used to produce infectious clones could be deployed as

02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:58.940
a way of creating a PCR background that is positive now that may not have been necessary

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:03.740
they may have already known that there was a background that could be confounded as a signal

02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:11.340
but for sure there is a very definitive way in which that they could insert the signal that they

02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:20.300
wanted to find even make it impossible for the Chinese not to report the signal that they wanted

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:26.940
them to find and in fact the sequence of the spike protein that they wanted them to find could

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:33.340
easily have been implanted implanted in these places using infectious clones and that's why they

02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:38.860
don't talk about it that's why this is the biology that they ignore they don't want to talk about

02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:44.860
the infectious cycle because that's the biology they want to ignore and about those things and

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:48.780
those incongruencies that no virus people like the Bailey's were definitely right

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:57.100
and so here we are with this illusion of consensus after five years and going that a novel virus

02:06:57.100 --> 02:07:01.340
circulated the globe and is still circulating that we have evidence of its spread and evidence of

02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:06.860
its evolution and this faith in a novel virus has resulted in seven million people being killed

02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:12.860
worldwide by a virus and many more by bad protocols and and lockdowns and this kind of thing but we

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:18.620
had to do it because gain of function is real and thank heaven transfection works better than

02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:25.100
expected and saves so many people this is what people believe and we can't let them believe it

02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:35.020
look five years show that to the college kids show the trillions of dollars that have been made

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:41.500
show the data that's been collected on them as they sold all the remnants of all the tests that

02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:50.940
they had to do in 2021 2020 and 2021 they went back to college in 2020 and Richard Ebright said that

02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:55.740
250,000 college kids were going to die if we sent them back to college and we did we sent them back

02:07:55.740 --> 02:08:01.740
to college we made them test all the time we made them quarantine the whole nine yards and that was

02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:10.620
and that was only in 2020 and in 2021 before any of these supposed dissident leaders like Brett

02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:17.500
Weinstein or or Steve Kirsch or Robert Mon had anything to say that would have saved them

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:24.700
they helped in every way possible to brainwash these young people into believing that there was

02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:29.740
an ongoing pandemic despite the fact that there were doctors all over the world and adults all

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:35.420
over the world that were saying that that was impossible they drawn them out to seed the faith

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:39.820
and the faith is a lie it's a background signal it doesn't have to be viruses it can just be

02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:45.660
RNA and DNA noise that has been confounded by people like Nathan wolf and meadow biota and

02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:55.020
metagenomic sequencing to be evidence of spreading pathogens and it's just not there it's just not

02:08:55.100 --> 02:09:01.900
real but the childhood vaccine schedule is dependent on us believing that and so we need to call for

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:09.820
a pause a stop of the childhood vaccine schedule now strict liability for all pharmaceutical products

02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:15.020
and investigation into this whole mess and get out of the who entirely get rid of our CDC if you

02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:18.940
want to know who the medlers are they're not talking about the childhood vaccine schedule in America

02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:24.300
as being a crime they're not talking about strict liability for all pharmaceutical products they're

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:30.220
not talking about the deadly protocols at all not one mention of the deadly protocols in that

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:37.100
Dr. Malik interview at all would have been nice if Dr. Malik could have mentioned the protocols

02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:43.900
and asked what proportion Robert Malone thought that that we could explain because we would have

02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:50.460
heard very clearly him defend the fact that nobody was killed by the protocols I also didn't hear

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:55.580
anything in that Robert Malone video about the domain program even though the domain program was

02:09:55.580 --> 02:10:01.580
something that he bragged about for the first year and about how he made a a computer model of x-ray

02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:09.260
crystallography of the main three cl protease so that he could interface that with all known drugs

02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:15.900
and pharmaceuticals from the FDA and see which ones would help and remdesivir and femotidine were

02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:20.220
two of them that were selected how come he didn't mention that at all in

02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:25.420
Malik's podcast even though he's told that story a million times the domain

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:32.060
program hasn't been mentioned in a long long time not since people like Mark Koolack and myself

02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:39.500
have trashed it as probably just a joke you couldn't have done that in three weeks with a volunteer

02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:48.060
team but that's what Robert Malone told Stephen Hatfield on the Tommy podcast Stephen Hatfield

02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:54.380
the guy in the same picture in Romania that that one the guy that was originally accused of the

02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:02.140
anthrax leaks in 2001 that guy that's right they don't use the word transfection

02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:08.700
except we're enforced they don't talk about clones at all except for David Martin

02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:16.700
who talks about clones relative to infectious replication defective clones

02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:23.420
implying that there are replication competent clones and I'm suggesting to you that the whole

02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:30.460
existence of clones implies that there aren't replication competent viruses that really circle

02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:35.740
the globe that you need to make a clone of them even to study them and to get them to exist for

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:45.100
any length of time oh ladies and gentlemen we are so close to breaking this we just got to keep

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:50.060
the steady pressure i'm going to pick up the slack a little bit as mark usatonic reorganizes in the

02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:58.140
background and gets his energy back and and re-orient because I know that he's not giving up or or

02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:05.100
dropping out but this takes time and people with real lives and real families with real wives and

02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:11.660
maybe even in a not planned grandchild that you have to take care of these people have stuff to do

02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:19.100
i've got three kids and a wife i've got rent to pay and i've i just recently was laid off

02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:25.580
by what i thought was going to be a dream job for telling the truth about this telling the truth

02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:32.620
about these people and so i do definitely need your help i do definitely need your support to

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:41.020
keep breaking this illusion and so stop all transfections in humans is my my main message

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:46.300
they are trying to eliminate the control group but i do also have another message and that is

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:51.260
that the sacred biology is something that you can come to understand if you come to understand

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:56.060
that sacred biology will become obvious to you why intramuscular injection of any combination of

02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:01.180
substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb it will become obvious

02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:07.580
why transfections in humans is criminally negligent there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands

02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:13.820
of academic biologists who should have done known better and still can be awakened

02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:19.740
and this is the kind of momentum that we need to go for because if those people can be awakened

02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:26.060
then we maybe can save these young people who are currently completely trapped in this mythology

02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:32.380
and it is definitely a mythology that was seeded by people like the intellectual dark web

02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:39.980
and so let's try to build this idea of an intellectual bright web of people that you can trust people

02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:45.260
that are supported by moms and dads and hard-working americans and hard-working people around the world

02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:52.540
that want freedom and prosperity and and and and well-being for their children and their grandchildren

02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.500
that's what giga-home biological is all about

02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:04.620
so please if you can share my work share my websites and most importantly if you can please

02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:12.140
subscribe it's down at the bottom the first level is ten dollars a month and if we had a thousand

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:20.140
of those people this work would be perpetuated forever if we have a thousand annual subscribers

02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:26.860
then maybe we we make an institute or we make uh we make some kind of uh school where people can

02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:33.980
come and stay and and and maybe we develop a curriculum i don't know but i do know that that

02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:39.820
dream and the dream of giga-home biological being like a permanent fixture on the internet

02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:45.980
is already being supported by these people and so if you want to help and you want that to be a

02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:54.540
reality please dream with me giga-home biological or the foreseeable future i really think it's

02:14:54.540 --> 02:15:10.460
possible i really think that we they we have earned it so join the team and i'll see you tomorrow
