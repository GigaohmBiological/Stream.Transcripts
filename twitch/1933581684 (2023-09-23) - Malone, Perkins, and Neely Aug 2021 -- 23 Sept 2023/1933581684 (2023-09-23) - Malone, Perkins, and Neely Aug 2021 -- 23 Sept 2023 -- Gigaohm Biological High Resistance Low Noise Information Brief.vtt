02:00.000 --> 02:21.480
And drop in a link to that new video, Mark, drop in a link to that new video of you posted,

02:21.480 --> 02:22.480
please.

02:23.480 --> 02:29.480
If you're not following Houston on a glib, you need to get off your, you know what,

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
and figure it out.

02:30.480 --> 02:37.980
The last couple of days have been gigantic.

02:37.980 --> 02:46.400
We got to get our, we got to get this message out, ladies and gentlemen, if the fire is hot,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.880
the steady pressure is working.

02:48.880 --> 02:53.880
I know I'm late tonight, but I believe we are well over two weeks straight.

02:53.880 --> 02:54.880
I don't know.

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
It could even be three.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.880
We're getting close to three weeks straight.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.880
You scheduled for 16 minutes next.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.880
He's going on French.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.880
Drop a link in the chat, Mark, you mark.

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
Japanese televisions.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
Smooth and tronic.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.880
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
It's embarrassing.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.880
Teenage sleuths solved bone hijacking mystery.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.880
Test one two.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.880
That's not too loud.

03:25.880 --> 03:26.880
Test one two.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.880
Some plan they had.

03:27.880 --> 03:33.880
First spreading the phony story about cover, and then feeling the yachts from the marina.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.880
That night on the beach, color was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of the ship.

03:38.880 --> 03:46.880
Yeah, but like his diving suit got covered with that kooky glowing seaweed.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.880
And that's where the glowing ghost story came from.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.880
Well, that close is the mystery.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.880
How did scuba do with that?

04:00.880 --> 04:03.880
I guess that's another mystery.

04:17.880 --> 04:33.880
Music

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:34.880 --> 04:39.880
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

04:39.880 --> 04:45.880
It's the 23rd of September, 2023.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.880
I believe it's much more likely it's elaborate.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.880
Oh, ships, what's going on here?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.880
Some kind of freak out.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.880
There we go.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.880
There was no spread in New York City, I don't think.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.880
The infectious clones, yeah, they're real.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.880
The placebo batches, they're real.

05:07.880 --> 05:14.880
And the transfection, yeah, it's always been a tool that wasn't really intended for healthy animals.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.880
I don't know what to tell you.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.880
Breaker, breaker, one-nine, protocols were murdered.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.880
Again, a function is a mythology, and the scuba do is real.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.880
They're liars.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.880
This is Giga Home Biological.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.880
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.880
Welcome to the show.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.880
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

05:41.880 --> 05:45.880
and the people that are streaming there above my head.

05:45.880 --> 05:50.880
If you would like to support the work of this stream, first and foremost,

05:50.880 --> 05:55.880
do something that almost nobody does and share this stream.

05:55.880 --> 06:01.880
I am gainfully employed at the moment as a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense,

06:01.880 --> 06:09.880
and although I speak for myself and for my little LLC in the back of my garage here on Giga Home Biological,

06:09.880 --> 06:16.880
it means that I don't need to beg for money except for in the sense of how much more of this can I do

06:16.880 --> 06:20.880
and how much more independent could I be.

06:20.880 --> 06:27.880
I'm not against going completely on my own in a year from now and trying to do something on my own

06:27.880 --> 06:33.880
and maybe raising money for that, but for now, what we need is this thing out there.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.880
And I have all of these friends above that are supporting me

06:37.880 --> 06:41.880
and they're supporting me because they've been supporting me for a long time

06:41.880 --> 06:48.880
and it's those little things that keep everything going here, make it possible to have birthday gifts

06:48.880 --> 06:51.880
and things like that that are a little bit better than normal.

06:51.880 --> 06:58.880
And along before that, it was actually putting food on the table and paying my rent.

06:58.880 --> 07:03.880
So a lot of those names that are up there are not necessarily giving what they used to be giving

07:03.880 --> 07:07.880
and some of them have been giving only a little bit for a very long time.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.880
The point is the stream needs sharing.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.880
Mark's work needs sharing.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
That's how this wins.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.880
That's how we get this over the finish line is more people need to see it.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.880
Share my CHD stream with Brian Hooker from the other day, please.

07:25.880 --> 07:30.880
It's a really decent representation of our work here

07:30.880 --> 07:33.880
and what we've been doing together for so long.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.880
And it's not a bad way for people to be introduced to me.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.880
We don't talk about the virus at all.

07:38.880 --> 07:43.880
So it's a real safe kind of intro into who is Jonathan Cooey.

07:43.880 --> 07:48.880
And so please share it and share this stream because, again,

07:48.880 --> 07:53.880
we're really trying to bust our hump here to be here every night

07:53.880 --> 07:56.880
and make sure that we keep steady pressure on this because I think it's actually working.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.880
The sand castle is starting to melt.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.880
So please don't take the bait on TV or social media.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
The bait is going to get worse.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.880
I can guarantee it.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.880
I am especially insulated from it.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
Transfection is not immunization.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.880
If you want to be a little more fancy about it,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.880
you can say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

08:17.880 --> 08:20.880
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.880
I'm actually pretty excited about the fact that I feel confident.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.880
Oh, I didn't check my camera.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
I was not on.

08:29.880 --> 08:30.880
I should have been on like this.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.880
I feel pretty confident now that our steady pressure is working

08:35.880 --> 08:39.880
in terms of having some effect on people's behavior,

08:39.880 --> 08:42.880
effect on their rhetoric,

08:42.880 --> 08:46.880
and maybe even influencing relationships behind the scenes

08:46.880 --> 08:50.880
and weakening the once, I would say,

08:50.880 --> 08:54.880
pretty good stronghold on the dissident movement

08:54.880 --> 08:59.880
and the thinking of dissonance within the movement.

08:59.880 --> 09:04.880
It wasn't too long ago that the sort of thing

09:04.880 --> 09:08.880
that everybody was repeating was that we don't want to cause any division

09:08.880 --> 09:11.880
and we have to try to stay together.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.880
At the same time, doing world tours all around the United States

09:16.880 --> 09:21.880
and Europe telling us about fifth generation warfare

09:21.880 --> 09:23.880
that we could never figure out.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.880
These people did actually change the way that we think about things.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.880
Very specifically, they changed the way that we think about our biology

09:33.880 --> 09:38.880
and our biology of our population, but also our biology as individuals.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
And changing the way that we think about that biology

09:41.880 --> 09:44.880
and our responsibility for it,

09:44.880 --> 09:47.880
changing the way that we think about this biology

09:47.880 --> 09:51.880
and a doctor's responsibility for it,

09:51.880 --> 09:54.880
allowed people to be ventilated that didn't need to be ventilated

09:54.880 --> 09:58.880
and allowed a poison like Remdesivir to be used en masse

09:58.880 --> 10:02.880
in the United States, especially at certain hospitals

10:02.880 --> 10:05.880
where the CDC and federal protocols

10:05.880 --> 10:08.880
could be more strictly enforced.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.880
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen,

10:11.880 --> 10:14.880
we are making accusations of iatrogenic murder.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.880
You want to call it genocide.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.880
I don't think it's a really good idea because it turns

10:19.880 --> 10:24.880
the mouth-breathing TV watchers, their brains turn off.

10:24.880 --> 10:29.880
They've already been programmed not to really compute that word

10:29.880 --> 10:32.880
unless it's said by someone on the TV.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.880
And so I think it's better just to call it iatrogenic murder,

10:36.880 --> 10:38.880
hospitalized murder.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.880
And this control of our discussion over the last three years

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
has really worn us down.

10:48.880 --> 10:53.880
It's really worn us down as we've watched these actors

10:53.880 --> 10:56.880
pretend to try and argue their way out of this,

10:56.880 --> 11:00.880
or argue our way out of this, or sue our way out of this,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.880
or bring a criminal case to get our way out of this,

11:03.880 --> 11:07.880
or be a whistleblower to get our way out of this,

11:07.880 --> 11:11.880
or to leak a document and get our way out of this,

11:11.880 --> 11:14.880
all to solve the puzzle of who made this virus,

11:14.880 --> 11:17.880
who's responsible for it,

11:17.880 --> 11:22.880
as if it's possible to release an RNA sequence on the floor,

11:22.880 --> 11:24.880
on the bottom of somebody's shoe,

11:24.880 --> 11:29.880
or in an animal at a wet market,

11:30.880 --> 11:33.880
and that could result in a pandemic,

11:33.880 --> 11:36.880
where a single RNA sequence,

11:36.880 --> 11:38.880
or let's say a thousand of them,

11:38.880 --> 11:41.880
decide to cover the planet.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.880
It just didn't happen, ladies and gentlemen,

11:43.880 --> 11:47.880
and you've been fooled into believing that this mystery is worth solving.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.880
And in so coming to solve that mystery,

11:50.880 --> 11:53.880
you've been fooled into believing that there's pandemic potential

11:53.880 --> 11:57.880
in bad caves, in petri dishes, in animal cultures,

11:57.880 --> 12:01.880
and in the genetic tools and toolboxes

12:01.880 --> 12:04.880
of molecular biologists all around the world.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.880
And you've been led to believe this in order that your fear,

12:08.880 --> 12:10.880
uncertainty and doubt,

12:10.880 --> 12:14.880
will convince you that the convenience of a digital ID

12:14.880 --> 12:17.880
and digital currency is worth it,

12:17.880 --> 12:19.880
given the fact that, well, you know,

12:19.880 --> 12:22.880
we've got all these diseases we might as well keep track of people.

12:22.880 --> 12:29.880
That's what this controlled descent is all about,

12:29.880 --> 12:32.880
is to make sure that even though we're resisting,

12:32.880 --> 12:35.880
we walk right into the avatar.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.880
And the way that happens is if you don't understand

12:39.880 --> 12:44.880
that the potential for RNA viruses to pandemic

12:44.880 --> 12:48.880
has been grossly over-exaggerated,

12:48.880 --> 12:51.880
you must understand this.

12:51.880 --> 12:57.880
And SARS-CoV-2 is not some molecular exception to this rule.

12:57.880 --> 13:02.880
It is exactly the opposite of that.

13:02.880 --> 13:08.880
It is a mythology based around the idea that this rule doesn't exist,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.880
that this limit doesn't exist,

13:10.880 --> 13:15.880
that this biology isn't better understood than it is.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.880
These people have wholly lied about the ability of PCR

13:18.880 --> 13:20.880
to detect this thing,

13:20.880 --> 13:25.880
and they've wholly lied about its potential to hurt everyone.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.880
And the people who are in on this narrative

13:27.880 --> 13:31.880
are perpetuating the idea that the virus and its effects

13:31.880 --> 13:34.880
grossly exceed that of any mistakes that would have been made

13:34.880 --> 13:37.880
by the humans trying to do their best.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.880
Let me repeat that.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.880
None of these people that are perpetuating this narrative

13:43.880 --> 13:47.880
will step out of bounds with regard to the idea

13:47.880 --> 13:51.880
that the virus is responsible for orders of magnitude

13:51.880 --> 13:55.880
more damage than any of the mistakes made by the people

13:55.880 --> 14:00.880
trying their best to solve the problem that was the novel virus.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.880
That's the central myth of this mythology.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.880
That's the central myth that most of the people in this red triangle

14:08.880 --> 14:11.880
are still sustaining.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.880
And I'm being very generous when I slide Bobby underneath that red line.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.880
I'm actually being quite generous with Sucred Bhagti as well

14:20.880 --> 14:22.880
because he considers himself a virologist

14:22.880 --> 14:25.880
and he has no doubt that there was one.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.880
And so he still needs a little more convincing from Denny

14:29.880 --> 14:33.880
and from Mike Eden and others.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.880
But the rest of these people in one way or another,

14:36.880 --> 14:39.880
they know what they're up to because they got a phone call

14:39.880 --> 14:42.880
that told them what to talk about.

14:42.880 --> 14:48.880
Nobody just becomes famous on substacks spontaneously.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.880
Nobody just is censored on LinkedIn

14:52.880 --> 14:54.880
but then gets to cry about it on Twitter

14:54.880 --> 14:59.880
and then start a whole new set of social media tools

14:59.880 --> 15:02.880
like Telegram and GAB and then come back to Twitter

15:02.880 --> 15:08.880
in a ticker tape parade and call that censorship.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.880
That's all of us being led around by our nose.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
Real censorship's silence.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.880
Real censorship is being on Twitch

15:17.880 --> 15:22.880
and having only 2,700 followers for about a year.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.880
Real censorship is being on YouTube

15:25.880 --> 15:29.880
and having 6,000 followers for four or five years

15:29.880 --> 15:35.880
after four or five years of putting out videos.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.880
Real censorship is losing channels, you know?

15:38.880 --> 15:42.880
Not losing my monetization

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
and then being able to go all around the internet

15:44.880 --> 15:51.880
and cry about it like Russell Brandt is doing right now.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.880
And so I've been trying to make maps of these people

15:54.880 --> 15:58.880
and try to make it a little more friendly to think about

15:58.880 --> 16:01.880
and I'm thinking about it more like a map, like a puzzle

16:01.880 --> 16:03.880
where pieces move around

16:03.880 --> 16:06.880
and as we learn things about people

16:06.880 --> 16:08.880
and move those pieces around

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
because they're connected to other pieces,

16:10.880 --> 16:13.880
sometimes we learn a lot when one person talks

16:13.880 --> 16:17.880
and I find it really important, Robert Malone.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.880
Robert Malone is really important.

16:19.880 --> 16:25.880
I don't know why, but he's involved in everything.

16:25.880 --> 16:30.880
And it bothers me a lot that we're not a little bit more aware

16:30.880 --> 16:32.880
of how bad this is.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.880
And last night and the night before

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
were some really big nights

16:36.880 --> 16:41.880
for figuring out what's going on here.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.880
I looked at a video that was only 20 minutes long

16:45.880 --> 16:53.880
and the host of it was the Enlightenment Radio Network.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.880
The people that were talking were Dr. Paul Catrell,

16:57.880 --> 16:59.880
Dr. Busrider MD,

16:59.880 --> 17:02.880
and Dr. Robert Malone,

17:02.880 --> 17:05.880
disambiguation wizard,

17:05.880 --> 17:09.880
and self-proclaimed inventor of all vaccination

17:09.880 --> 17:13.880
that has to do with genetics.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.880
And in this discussion, he sent a couple things

17:15.880 --> 17:19.880
that were pretty inflammatory for me and for Mark,

17:19.880 --> 17:22.880
one of which was that dexamethasone is a drug

17:22.880 --> 17:26.880
that could be easily used to drive up the kill rate of the virus,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.880
ha ha ha.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.880
And that remdesivir was also something

17:30.880 --> 17:32.880
that wasn't living up to its rep,

17:32.880 --> 17:37.880
and it was a rabbit hole that they didn't want to go down.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.880
So basically in a couple sentences,

17:39.880 --> 17:42.880
they admitted that there's a real big chance

17:42.880 --> 17:45.880
that the protocols are screwing people up pretty rapidly.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.880
And it's not that big a deal,

17:47.880 --> 17:50.880
because actually maybe people would be doing that on purpose.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.880
The only reason why he would know that, of course,

17:52.880 --> 17:55.880
is that he was round when that was done for the AIDS virus.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.880
But we're not going to go there right now.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.880
I think it's really important for everybody to see this.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
The MMR and Dr. Wakefield.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.880
The reason I mention this is you've had the...

18:07.880 --> 18:11.880
your change in kind of view around vaccines in general

18:11.880 --> 18:15.880
has also coincided with your...

18:15.880 --> 18:17.880
I don't know if it's a real acquaintance with

18:17.880 --> 18:20.880
or an acquaintance with the case of Wakefield.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.880
So for the Brits here, just to hear this from you,

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
do you think he was perhaps right all along?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.880
I think he was right all along,

18:27.880 --> 18:30.880
and I think he will be vindicated, absolutely.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Wow.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
So do you agree with Tess then?

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
Have you...

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
Has your...

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
So my view has changed.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
Now I can tell you,

18:36.880 --> 18:39.880
if I was a young parent today,

18:39.880 --> 18:43.880
what I would do is I would forgo the vaccines.

18:43.880 --> 18:44.880
I'm not an anti-vaxxer.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.880
I can't be.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
I'm a pin cushion.

18:46.880 --> 18:47.880
I took all these vaccines.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.880
Now what I am though,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.880
is I'm now vaccine risk aware.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.880
And let me tell you what Andy Wakefield was, right?

18:54.880 --> 18:57.880
And all Andy Wakefield could have this famous...

18:57.880 --> 19:01.880
I wonder how many people in the audience

19:01.880 --> 19:04.880
who haven't seen this understand how significant it is.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.880
And I wonder how many people in the audience

19:06.880 --> 19:09.880
understand how significant this is.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.880
Because I'm going to put this out there right now

19:12.880 --> 19:15.880
in case you haven't considered it.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.880
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has never said that.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.880
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says that he wants the vaccines tested.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.880
He's never actually said the words,

19:28.880 --> 19:31.880
I would say, if I was a mom right now,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.880
I would forgo the vaccines.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.880
It's never said that.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.880
Never, ever, ever said that.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.880
Never even come close to it.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.880
It's not because he's smart.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.880
It's because he's a lawyer,

19:43.880 --> 19:46.880
because that's the thing they do.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.880
That's what they do.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.880
And he has stuck to the line of,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
well, I want them tested.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.880
I want them tested against a placebo.

19:55.880 --> 20:01.880
It's the exact same line that Aaron Ciri defends.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.880
This is gigantic,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.880
because it's the same thing that I'm saying

20:07.880 --> 20:08.880
at the beginning of the stream,

20:08.880 --> 20:09.880
and it's not...

20:09.880 --> 20:11.880
We're not leaders.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.880
Because we just came to this realization.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.880
I came to it in 2022.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.880
He's coming to it in 2022 or 23 as well.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.880
And so there's people that have already been there,

20:24.880 --> 20:28.880
that already have been taken bullets for years.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.880
And some of them, many of them took...

20:30.880 --> 20:35.880
The first bullet they took was with their kid.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.880
So we got no excuse.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.880
But this is giant.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.880
Because every single person that stands up in the lawn section

20:45.880 --> 20:49.880
and starts dancing is one more person that can lead to it.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.880
A massive change.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.880
And that won't be stoppable.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.880
There will be people who will turn their TV up really loud

20:59.880 --> 21:02.880
to make sure that they don't hear it.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.880
But it will be unstoppable.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
And more importantly,

21:07.880 --> 21:09.880
those people that are waking up like that

21:09.880 --> 21:13.880
will definitely make their way to the voting booth, I hope.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.880
And I'm terrified to think of how rigged it is.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.880
I'm terrified to even think about it.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.880
But the most important thing is that people are waking up.

21:22.880 --> 21:29.880
And this is a sign that Dr. Peter McCullough may just have been told

21:29.880 --> 21:31.880
what he can say and what he cannot say.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.880
And that's why he's...

21:33.880 --> 21:38.880
When he was on my show, it was almost as if he was under duress.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.880
Because he knew coming on my show he was going to be pushed to say

21:41.880 --> 21:44.880
the stuff that he's not allowed to say and he didn't say it.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.880
And that's fine if he's going to say this.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.880
Let's listen to it again because this is really an extraordinary moment

21:54.880 --> 21:57.880
in this pandemic.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.880
It is of the MMR and Dr. Wakefield.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.880
The reason I mention this is you've had the...

22:03.880 --> 22:07.880
Your change in kind of view around vaccines in general

22:07.880 --> 22:10.880
has also coincided with your...

22:10.880 --> 22:13.880
I don't know if it's a reacquaintance with or an acquaintance

22:13.880 --> 22:15.880
with the case of Wakefield.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.880
So for the Brits here just to hear this from you,

22:18.880 --> 22:20.880
do you think he was perhaps right all along?

22:20.880 --> 22:24.880
I think he was right all along and I think he will be vindicated

22:24.880 --> 22:26.880
absolutely.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.880
So do you agree with Tess then?

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
Has your view moved?

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
My view has changed.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.880
Now I can tell you, if I was a young parent today,

22:34.880 --> 22:38.880
what I would do is I would forego the vaccines.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.880
I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I can't be. I'm a pin cushion.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.880
I took all these vaccines.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.880
Now what I am though is I'm now vaccine risk aware.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.880
And let me tell you what Andy Wakefield was right.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.880
But all Andy Wakefield was saying is that maybe it's too intense.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.880
Maybe we ought to just kind of spread him out.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.880
That's all he was really saying.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.880
It's really important that you understand how important

23:06.880 --> 23:08.880
that what that really means.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.880
Because when pieces move around like this,

23:10.880 --> 23:14.880
we really need to understand how they're shifting.

23:14.880 --> 23:20.880
And I think it's very likely that we can start to think of

23:20.880 --> 23:24.880
and we need to start thinking of

23:24.880 --> 23:30.880
Bobby and Peter as being closer to Green than anything.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.880
I mean we just have to bring them onto the side of understanding

23:32.880 --> 23:34.880
that there wasn't any spread in New York

23:34.880 --> 23:36.880
and therefore it had to be something else.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.880
We have to think about it like something else.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.880
And so I want you to watch a movie with me today

23:44.880 --> 23:48.880
because there's another video that I found that's from the same

23:48.880 --> 23:52.880
Enlightenment radio network that Mark exposed and looked at

23:52.880 --> 23:55.880
with his stream the other night and the one that I happened upon

23:55.880 --> 23:58.880
that I didn't really realize was such a gold mine

23:58.880 --> 24:02.880
of Robert Malone footage.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.880
And I want you to realize

24:05.880 --> 24:10.880
that I put Robert Malone above my head now because

24:10.880 --> 24:14.880
okay so he's streaming with Paul Catrell on this

24:14.880 --> 24:17.880
Enlightenment radio network.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.880
He's plugging George Webb all the oops

24:20.880 --> 24:22.880
can you see my arrow? No you couldn't.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.880
So he's streaming with Paul Catrell.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.880
He's doing George Webb promotions on his website

24:30.880 --> 24:34.880
like more than three times he's promoted George Webb

24:34.880 --> 24:37.880
to his subscribers that are more than a million right?

24:37.880 --> 24:40.880
So that seems a little kind of like shooting yourself in the foot.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.880
He's done Paul Catrell shows which I also find very extraordinary

24:47.880 --> 24:51.880
if you can come out on, if you can come out on,

24:51.880 --> 24:55.880
I mean why is he wasting his time with those people?

24:55.880 --> 24:58.880
Those videos have like 47 views

24:58.880 --> 25:00.880
were they streaming on some other platform?

25:00.880 --> 25:03.880
Was it really a radio show? I don't know.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.880
But it's extraordinary.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.880
And it tells us something because of what Mark found last night

25:09.880 --> 25:16.880
which is that that guy Neely was actually

25:16.880 --> 25:22.880
was actually arrested on January 6th at the Capitol.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.880
Now it's not to say that that makes him a good guy or a bad guy.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.880
It means something though.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.880
It's bizarre.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.880
It's weird though.

25:33.880 --> 25:38.880
And we've got to really consider the fact that he was there

25:38.880 --> 25:42.880
that Robert has worked with these guys many times

25:42.880 --> 25:45.880
and what this means from the perspective of who all these people are

25:45.880 --> 25:48.880
why are they all connected.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.880
And on that map that we were looking at back there you know

25:51.880 --> 25:55.880
there's a real, oh yeah we don't leave this off for now.

25:55.880 --> 26:02.880
There's a real, it's just, it's so,

26:02.880 --> 26:09.880
it's so defeating to think that, you know, over here,

26:09.880 --> 26:13.880
that's it, there we go.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.880
And I don't think the podcast is called Black and White.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.880
I don't think it's called Blacks and Whites.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.880
But that's how they wrote it in here.

26:21.880 --> 26:26.880
When you look at the thumbnail, it's Black and White I believe.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.880
But it's, anyway, here we go.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.880
Let's just do this.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.880
I'm going to set it fast though because I don't want to stay up super late.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.880
I want to get done.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.880
And I know you guys don't mind, right?

26:38.880 --> 26:40.880
I mean I'm going to do a one and a half times.

26:40.880 --> 26:45.880
I hope that's going to be fast enough to get done.

26:45.880 --> 26:46.880
We only want to deal with facts.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.880
It's time for you to re-enter from there.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.880
It's time for Dan and Darryl.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
I'll put myself a little small.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
Welcome back to Black and White.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.880
And we have, I call it one of our favorite people.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
So he's been on more than anybody else.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.880
Dr. Robert Long, he'll be on just a minute.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.880
But I want to just take a minute or so and raise a couple of quick issues.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.880
The story came out yesterday that in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia,

27:06.880 --> 27:09.880
there are more people dying from gun shot wounds than from the virus.

27:09.880 --> 27:10.880
I'm going to say that again.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.880
More people dying from gun shot wounds in New York,

27:12.880 --> 27:16.880
Philadelphia and Chicago than the virus.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.880
And so if you start to look and you try and find out how many people have died of delta,

27:21.880 --> 27:23.880
it's almost impossible to find out.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.880
They keep talking about the infection rates are up and people in the hospital are up,

27:26.880 --> 27:29.880
but the death rates seem to be not moving very much.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.880
So that the virus we're dealing with delta apparently spreads more

27:33.880 --> 27:36.880
and affects more people and puts some people in the hospital.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.880
But it's not killing people anywhere near it's big sister was.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.880
So with that to talk about the second stage of the delta trilogy,

27:44.880 --> 27:47.880
it's Dr. Robert Malone who's been with us three or four times before.

27:47.880 --> 27:52.880
And so Dr. welcome back to Black and White.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.880
My pleasure Dan and I look forward to what you post this as a podcast

27:56.880 --> 27:59.880
and being able to cross post it on Twitter.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.880
I think we've got some important topics today.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.880
Well, I was going to suggest something but I've changed my mind, Dr. since

28:04.880 --> 28:07.880
you're a hell of a lot smarter than me, probably a girl smarter than me.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.880
So but you tell us what is the most important message

28:11.880 --> 28:13.880
that you want to communicate to our listeners today.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.880
What's first and foremost in your mind?

28:15.880 --> 28:17.880
Actually, I've got about four of them right now.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.880
They're all at the same time.

28:19.880 --> 28:23.880
So this is like reading the news over the last week really quickly.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.880
One of the things that the big bombshell that dropped last Friday

28:26.880 --> 28:30.880
was the Washington Post article based on a leaked CDC slide deck about delta,

28:30.880 --> 28:32.880
among other things.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.880
And the press and the Washington Post downplayed it,

28:34.880 --> 28:39.880
but the slide deck you can read it yourself and I put links to that in my Twitter account

28:39.880 --> 28:41.880
or you can get it from the Washington Post.

28:41.880 --> 28:45.880
So it clearly documents that delta is able to infect people

28:45.880 --> 28:47.880
that have been previously vaccinated.

28:47.880 --> 28:48.880
So that's a bombshell.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.880
It also documents that delta is about as infectious as the chickenpox virus.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.880
What that means for those that are technical, you know, epidemiologists

28:56.880 --> 28:58.880
in training, which seems like most of us these days,

28:58.880 --> 29:01.880
is the are not the reproductive coefficient is about eight.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.880
The prior reproductive coefficient for the alpha variant was about two to two and a half.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.880
So we're in the range of, you know, arguably three to four times more infectious.

29:09.880 --> 29:14.880
According to the CDC's own slide deck, their estimate is, as you say,

29:14.880 --> 29:18.880
delta is not more pathogenic than alpha.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.880
So more infectious and a minimum not significantly more pathogenic.

29:22.880 --> 29:28.880
No, in terms of your point about, you know, what are the deaths, et cetera.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.880
Right now the two countries that are kind of ahead of the curve

29:31.880 --> 29:34.880
that have more comprehensive data are Great Britain and Israel.

29:34.880 --> 29:38.880
And so many of us are busy looking at those data that's fascinating in the UK data

29:38.880 --> 29:43.880
where you've got a fairly high percent of the population is vaccinated like 75 to 80%.

29:43.880 --> 29:47.880
And really dense vaccination in the high risk persons is just as you say,

29:47.880 --> 29:49.880
there's a big spike in new cases for delta.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.880
There's not a big spike in deaths.

29:51.880 --> 29:56.880
And one of the things we've also learned over the last week about the Israeli data is fascinating.

29:56.880 --> 30:02.880
The CDC and others have been saying, oh, but there's no adverse events being reported in the Israeli data set.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.880
So I had a chance to talk to some Israeli physicians and scientists to learn more about this.

30:06.880 --> 30:12.880
And the truth is that there was a deal struck between Netanyahu's government and Pfizer early on

30:12.880 --> 30:17.880
that provided the early access to the Pfizer vaccine to Israel and its population.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.880
And the population there was very compliant.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.880
You know, it was expressed to me that this one woman that I was talking to scientists said that

30:22.880 --> 30:25.880
we've had three wars that she's been there over the last four years, I think.

30:25.880 --> 30:29.880
And when the government tells you to run for the bunkers, you generally run for bunkers.

30:29.880 --> 30:34.880
So people are pretty willing to do whatever the government tells them to do, which is why they've had such good vaccine uptake.

30:34.880 --> 30:42.880
But it turns out that the reason why we're not seeing reports of adverse events in Israel is because they're forbidden by law.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.880
To report those adverse events, the contract that the government executed with Pfizer.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.880
So Pfizer gets all the data, but the adverse event data is by contract locked away for 30 years.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.880
Pfizer's got it, but the Israeli government can't share it with anybody else.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.880
So that ties that one down.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.880
There's some kind of Israeli pirate positions in scientists.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.880
They're now collecting their own adverse events, data sets.

31:03.880 --> 31:08.880
And so they're the ones that are starting to reveal a lot of these effects that are coming out.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.880
Another big bombshell was just dropped last night.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.880
Yesterday was a very experienced senior pathologist that's been paid by the government of Germany.

31:15.880 --> 31:21.880
They were autopsies, including autopsies on people that have received vaccine within two weeks of their date of death.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.880
He's just reported a series about 50 autopsies.

31:23.880 --> 31:31.880
And he's claiming that about 50% of those show clear signs of death consequent to vaccine administration, mostly cardiac clocks and things like that.

31:31.880 --> 31:36.880
So this is all comers folks that died within two weeks after vaccine administration.

31:36.880 --> 31:42.880
So it does appear that the deaths and other adverse events, again, we're getting the same data in different ways.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.880
It's all coming together.

31:44.880 --> 31:50.880
The deaths and adverse events from vaccines, and these aren't adults, are showing much of the same pathology that was detected in the adolescence.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.880
We discussed this, I think, in a last podcast.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
So that's another big one.

31:54.880 --> 32:01.880
There's a very knowledgeable virologist in the Netherlands named Gert van der Bosch.

32:01.880 --> 32:07.880
Who I used to work with when I worked for Solve with him on the development of influenza vaccines, new influenza vaccine technology.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.880
So Solve is based in the Netherlands, and that's where Gert lives.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.880
Gert's a veterinary immunologist and vaccinologist.

32:13.880 --> 32:19.880
And the general practice in the Netherlands is you don't vaccinate the herds, you don't vaccinate food animals, because you don't want to select for vaccine escape variants.

32:20.880 --> 32:25.880
So what they do is they call a flock, let's say, chickens that gets an infection, rather than vaccinating to try to get out of it.

32:25.880 --> 32:32.880
Gert, obviously, we can't do that with humans. Gert has been the one that's been making a really strong case that he cannot vaccinate into the teeth of a pandemic.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.880
Because what she will do is select increasingly potent vaccine escape variants.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.880
And by the way, those escape variants aren't coming from the unvaccinated, they're coming from the vaccinated.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.880
So that's another lie that we've been given.

32:42.880 --> 32:48.880
Just chalk up that the whiteboard is getting full, figure it out to go right into the 50s, I think, of lies we've been pulled.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.880
So it's not the unvaccinated, the problem is the vaccinated.

32:51.880 --> 32:55.880
And Gert makes the point, and it's entirely consistent with what we're seeing with these new mutants.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.880
It's not only Delta, but Lambda now is cropping up.

32:58.880 --> 33:04.880
And basically what's happening is by doing universal, trying to push universal vaccination over the world,

33:04.880 --> 33:08.880
what we're doing is training everybody's immune system to respond in the same way,

33:08.880 --> 33:12.880
as opposed to the normal situation with natural infection, is because of our genetic diversity,

33:12.880 --> 33:17.880
we all respond to a threat pathogen in a different way immunologically, suddenly different.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.880
And that's a good thing for the survival of human species.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.880
That's how that's supposed to work.

33:21.880 --> 33:26.880
That was one of the things that's selected for preservation of the under-called DNA, by the way, in Europe years millennia ago,

33:26.880 --> 33:29.880
is this kind of genetic selection against infectious disease.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.880
So by training everybody's immune system to respond to the same antigen in the same way,

33:32.880 --> 33:35.880
what it means is the virus is going to get better and better and better and better

33:35.880 --> 33:38.880
at escaping that particular type of immune response.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.880
And when it gets there, even if it gets close to it, it's going to result in mutants that replicate much better

33:42.880 --> 33:46.880
and completely evade the immune response in all of us that have been vaccinated.

33:46.880 --> 33:50.880
And we're setting ourselves up, basically, I'm sorry to say I don't mean to sound alarmist,

33:50.880 --> 33:53.880
but Bert's point is we're setting ourselves up for a global catastrophe.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.880
And I got a...

33:54.880 --> 34:00.880
Now let's cover what he said first up until now, up until the global catastrophe,

34:00.880 --> 34:03.880
so that we can boil it down a little bit.

34:04.880 --> 34:12.880
And don't get too upset with regard to...

34:12.880 --> 34:15.880
Let me get the desk open here.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.880
Isn't that the desk open or is this the desk open?

34:18.880 --> 34:20.880
This must be the desk open.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.880
No, that's awesome.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.880
I'm going to get rid of that.

34:25.880 --> 34:33.880
Okay, that I can do this, yes.

34:33.880 --> 34:39.880
So in this interview, he started with talking about the Delta variant,

34:39.880 --> 34:46.880
and specifically he said that it was a slide deck that was leaked by the CDC.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.880
Now, if you can remember very clearly, what does a leak mean?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.880
A leak means most likely that they want you to know this,

34:53.880 --> 34:57.880
and he's going to break it down for you and let you know exactly what it's all about.

34:57.880 --> 35:01.880
An R0 of 8 is absurd.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.880
And what it means is that this...

35:03.880 --> 35:07.880
Now they're keying into a different background signal.

35:07.880 --> 35:11.880
And this new background signal or a new clone, if you want to have a new clone,

35:11.880 --> 35:14.880
but I'm not buying that.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.880
And it's very tricky because we don't really know who's doing the sequencing

35:19.880 --> 35:22.880
when they're doing the sequencing, where the sequences are coming from,

35:22.880 --> 35:27.880
we're just told that they're coming from all over the world.

35:27.880 --> 35:31.880
Israel and the UK are particularly vaccinated populations,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.880
but there's not a big spike in deaths.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.880
And so what that seems to mean, what he seems to imply there,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.880
is that the RNA is not working terribly.

35:40.880 --> 35:44.880
And in the UK, the people that got AstraZeneca and didn't die,

35:44.880 --> 35:48.880
it's not working terribly.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.880
Now he tells the same thing about no adverse events in Israel

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
because the Pfizer deal can't report it,

35:54.880 --> 35:59.880
and he also tells this story about how when the Israelis are so drilled to respond

35:59.880 --> 36:02.880
to the governments of commands,

36:02.880 --> 36:06.880
that when they were told to take the shots, they did it.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.880
He also talks about the fact that there's somebody doing autopsies in Germany

36:10.880 --> 36:13.880
and finding up to 50% of the deaths that happen right after the vaccine

36:13.880 --> 36:16.880
are probably caused by the vaccine because of the clotting

36:16.880 --> 36:20.880
and because of the stating for this spike in certain places.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.880
But he says the adverse events area are the same across age groups,

36:24.880 --> 36:28.880
and often seems to imply something to do with clotting.

36:28.880 --> 36:33.880
So then he goes to say that Herod Vonenbalsch is an old friend of his

36:33.880 --> 36:37.880
who he used to work with at Solve on the flu vaccine.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
Interesting, isn't it?

36:39.880 --> 36:42.880
That they also made a video in the north of Spain,

36:42.880 --> 36:45.880
and it had drone footage and all this other stuff,

36:45.880 --> 36:51.880
Malone is wearing some kind of baseball cap or cabbie baseball cap kind of hat.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.880
So here we see already that on the people map we should really connect

36:59.880 --> 37:03.880
Herod Vonenbalsch and Robert Malone because,

37:03.880 --> 37:07.880
I mean, they used to work together for goodness sakes.

37:07.880 --> 37:12.880
So there's no question that their messaging is being coordinated to some respect.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.880
I mean, they're literally a phone call away from one another.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.880
And so it's important for me to drop in here right now

37:20.880 --> 37:23.880
that we've talked about Merrick's disease often.

37:23.880 --> 37:28.880
And the example of Merrick's disease is not really applicable here

37:28.880 --> 37:31.880
in the way that you might think it is.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.880
Because with Merrick's disease in chickens,

37:34.880 --> 37:41.880
the particularly virulent version of the virus already existed in nature.

37:41.880 --> 37:46.880
And was competing with other less virulent forms.

37:46.880 --> 37:53.880
And so the chickens were building immunity to a whole range of Merrick's disease type viruses

37:53.880 --> 37:55.880
all related to one another.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.880
Some of them would succumb to more virulent versions.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.880
Others of them would not succumb to less virulent versions.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.880
And some would.

38:05.880 --> 38:09.880
But they were all there when the chickens started to become vaccinated and mass.

38:09.880 --> 38:14.880
And so then when the vaccinated chickens were still carrying high viral loads,

38:14.880 --> 38:24.880
then the more virulent virus was able to perpetuate and stay around

38:24.880 --> 38:26.880
and kill the sentinel birds.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.880
Now we need to look at that paper again so that you understand exactly what happens in that paper

38:30.880 --> 38:36.880
and why it happens because with regard to our immune system versus the transfected

38:36.880 --> 38:41.880
or multiple transfected, it is very different than Merrick's disease

38:41.880 --> 38:45.880
and the vaccine and non-vaccine case.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.880
Because unlike the chickens that are vaccinated,

38:48.880 --> 38:53.880
these people's immune system is not being boosted anymore.

38:53.880 --> 38:58.880
And what's more likely happening is some kind of tolerance is being built up

38:58.880 --> 39:02.880
to that particular protein which will make virimium more likely

39:03.880 --> 39:08.880
and perhaps perhaps it will result in vaccine enhanced disease in the old.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.880
I don't know.

39:10.880 --> 39:15.880
But it's not going to result in the kind of long-term protection that we are inevitably getting

39:15.880 --> 39:21.880
as members of the control group.

39:21.880 --> 39:27.880
Okay, we're really in a different situation than they are because our immune system

39:27.880 --> 39:31.880
is continually learning just the way it's supposed to.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.880
And we are taking care of our bodies in ways so that our immune system can function

39:36.880 --> 39:39.880
as optimally as possible.

39:39.880 --> 39:45.880
And that's something that, you know, we need to focus more and more on as we go forward

39:45.880 --> 39:48.880
because there are going to be other challenges.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.880
They make this talk about unvaxed and vaxed.

39:51.880 --> 39:58.880
And then he says genetically our responses are unique.

39:59.880 --> 40:04.880
And it's actually in history, the history of this biology is that that's the reason

40:04.880 --> 40:07.880
why pandemics aren't really possible.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.880
Because in order for a virus to move from person to person,

40:10.880 --> 40:13.880
it inevitably needs to change a little bit.

40:13.880 --> 40:18.880
And as it changes,

40:18.880 --> 40:22.880
it's got to get through a brand new immune system each time.

40:22.880 --> 40:27.880
And the odds are not very good because we've seen RNA viruses before.

40:28.880 --> 40:33.880
And so this illusion that there can be an RNA virus for which you have no defense

40:33.880 --> 40:36.880
is just 100% complete.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.880
It's nothing. It's wrong.

40:39.880 --> 40:45.880
And this is Robert Malone basically saying the same thing in a different way.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.880
Trying not to really let the cat out of the bag while really having, you know,

40:49.880 --> 40:56.880
wanting to tell the truth and liking his newfound attention.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
But it's not good, ladies and gentlemen.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.880
It's not good because this is really part of the mythology.

41:01.880 --> 41:07.880
And he seems to be in some ways meddling in this.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.880
And I don't know.

41:10.880 --> 41:15.880
I got to learn more from Mark and I've got to do more of my own research

41:15.880 --> 41:21.880
to understand the breadth and the depth of what patents he owns

41:21.880 --> 41:29.880
and the potential intellectual property over which he may have some monopoly power.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.880
It's hard for me to imagine that that really matters.

41:33.880 --> 41:40.880
It may just be one of these things where he can blackmail companies.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.880
Essentially, he can go to a company and say,

41:43.880 --> 41:46.880
Hey, are you making something that people inhale and it's RNA?

41:46.880 --> 41:51.880
Are you making something that people are going to put in their mucosa?

41:51.880 --> 41:56.880
And it's got RNA or DNA in it because I own that patent.

41:56.880 --> 42:02.880
And so if you don't want me to bring suit against you and take you for everything you're worth,

42:02.880 --> 42:07.880
why don't you pay for my horses to get flown to Saudi Arabia

42:07.880 --> 42:11.880
and put some money in my bank account?

42:11.880 --> 42:14.880
And he can probably make that phone call because he knows who to call

42:14.880 --> 42:17.880
and because he knows what to say and because he knows how the law works

42:17.880 --> 42:24.880
and because maybe he's friends with less Weinstein.

42:24.880 --> 42:29.880
I don't really know, but I do know for sure that if he has intellectual property

42:29.880 --> 42:38.880
over genetic immunizations in the mucosa and inhaled genetic vaccines,

42:38.880 --> 42:45.880
then he's got a pretty big intellectual property bone to pick

42:45.880 --> 42:48.880
if these technologies move forward.

42:48.880 --> 42:52.880
If any of these inhaled vaccines move forward,

42:52.880 --> 42:56.880
it could be potentially that they're all his and he's just not saying it

42:56.880 --> 43:01.880
instead making a stink about this other stuff over there.

43:01.880 --> 43:05.880
All the while to get everybody's attention and make sure you know what can happen

43:05.880 --> 43:08.880
because I'm not fooling around.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.880
I can be on nine podcasts today telling you, telling people all about

43:12.880 --> 43:16.880
what my intellectual property covers.

43:16.880 --> 43:20.880
Is it a threat? Is it a display of power?

43:20.880 --> 43:24.880
A display of endurance? Are they going to finally get revenge?

43:24.880 --> 43:28.880
For Merck taking that patent and doing nothing with it for ten years?

43:28.880 --> 43:31.880
I don't know.

43:31.880 --> 43:36.880
But I have the feeling that this meddling is no joke.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.880
I have the feeling that this meddling is no joke.

43:39.880 --> 43:44.880
Tell you as a seasoned virologist, I'm not as knowledgeable as he is

43:44.880 --> 43:48.880
about the molecular epidemiology that's going on.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.880
He has very detailed understanding of this and has been talking

43:51.880 --> 43:54.880
intensely with other molecular epidemiologists.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.880
I'm completely convinced by his argument.

43:56.880 --> 43:59.880
By doing vaccination, mass vaccination, using only spike.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.880
We're setting up a policy where we're putting the entire global

44:02.880 --> 44:03.880
population at risk.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.880
And it's just coming out of pure stupidity and thoughtlessness.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.880
Now, the CDC slide deck that came out among the other bombshells,

44:09.880 --> 44:13.880
they assert that natural infection also doesn't last until about

44:13.880 --> 44:16.880
for many more than about six months, which is by the way.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.880
So there's the other one, right?

44:18.880 --> 44:23.880
There's the other bomb drop that the CDC's leaked slide deck also says

44:23.880 --> 44:27.880
that natural immunity only lasts for six months.

44:27.880 --> 44:32.880
And so now think about how diabolical it is to make it a leak

44:32.880 --> 44:35.880
so that it must be real.

44:35.880 --> 44:36.880
I mean, it must be real.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.880
So then everybody's going, oh, wow, the CDC wasn't even going to tell us

44:40.880 --> 44:43.880
that natural immunity didn't work.

44:43.880 --> 44:47.880
And it's crazy because then you would never have any,

44:47.880 --> 44:51.880
you would never have any expectations for the mRNA to work any longer

44:51.880 --> 44:52.880
than six months.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.880
If natural immunity doesn't last any longer than six months, right?

44:56.880 --> 45:00.880
I see.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.880
But of course we know that's nonsense.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.880
You know that that's what I was saying from the absolute very start

45:05.880 --> 45:10.880
that we had previous immunity to other RNA viruses that would help us

45:10.880 --> 45:11.880
with this one.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.880
It was absurd to call it novel.

45:13.880 --> 45:20.880
And now here we have Robert Malone going right with the faith,

45:20.880 --> 45:22.880
right with the mythology.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.880
The way the number for the Pfizer vaccine,

45:24.880 --> 45:26.880
Pfizer groups out at six months.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.880
Among the other bombshells, they assert that natural infection also doesn't

45:30.880 --> 45:33.880
last until about, from any more than about six months, which is by the way,

45:33.880 --> 45:37.880
the number for the Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer groups out at six months.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.880
So Pfizer, you may recall a few weeks ago, said we're going to have to have

45:40.880 --> 45:41.880
boosters at six months.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.880
They knew this course because they had all the Israeli data.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.880
Tony Fauci came out and reprimanded them so they had no right to say that

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
without his permission.

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
They backed down.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.880
And then two weeks later, HHS came out with an announcement saying that we

45:50.880 --> 45:53.880
are going to have all the elderly and high-risk individuals are going to have

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
to get re-vaccinated six months.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
Okay.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.880
Now, by the way, today, the WHO comes out with a statement saying, no, no,

45:58.880 --> 45:59.880
no, no, we can't do that.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.880
We've got to vaccinate the whole world.

46:01.880 --> 46:05.880
And so we should be moving these vaccines into the emerging economies that

46:05.880 --> 46:07.880
don't have the money and the access to the high-tech Western medicine.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.880
Because if we don't get them there, we're just going to have more problems.

46:10.880 --> 46:15.880
Now, there's a statement along the lines that about 10% of the populations target

46:15.880 --> 46:18.880
the WHO talk about is about 10% of the populations in all these emerging

46:18.880 --> 46:19.880
economies.

46:19.880 --> 46:22.880
Well, that pretty much lines up with the idea that Gert has loaded and I'm very

46:22.880 --> 46:24.880
actively promoting and also floating.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.880
What we really ought to be doing is an extent that we're vaccinating.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.880
We ought to be vaccinating people that are highest-risk, the elderly and

46:29.880 --> 46:32.880
morbidly obese and the other folks that are at very high risk because they're

46:32.880 --> 46:33.880
pre-existing conditions.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.880
Anybody that we want to get rid of, we should be vaccinating right now.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.880
That's, I think, his attitude here.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.880
Anybody that we want to get rid of, we should be vaccinating right now.

46:41.880 --> 46:47.880
Anybody that's a burden on the system, you know, young people,

46:47.880 --> 46:55.880
young people that are in permanent care, people without, you know,

46:55.880 --> 47:01.880
relatives, old, old, old people with multiple comorbidities,

47:01.880 --> 47:05.880
these people need to be vaccinated.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.880
And that's saying that the vaccine works, right?

47:08.880 --> 47:11.880
Can you please see that this means that the vaccine works?

47:11.880 --> 47:19.880
He's not saying that the risk benefit for transfection for anybody is bad,

47:19.880 --> 47:22.880
which is what I'm saying.

47:22.880 --> 47:27.880
He's saying that for certain people,

47:27.880 --> 47:32.880
transfection is fine because the virus in combination with their really bad

47:32.880 --> 47:37.880
health makes the risks of transfection worthwhile.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.880
And this is diabolical.

47:41.880 --> 47:50.880
I mean, it's diabolical because this is the slippery slope, right?

47:50.880 --> 47:56.880
Because you're on Carol, who's really, you know, worried about it.

47:56.880 --> 47:59.880
She's going to take the vaccine then.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.880
And you're, you know, your mom's friend from the bowling alley.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.880
She's, she's going to take it.

48:03.880 --> 48:07.880
She's going to make all of her friends take it because, you know,

48:07.880 --> 48:09.880
the virus is really bad.

48:09.880 --> 48:12.880
I don't want long COVID.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.880
That's what this is so dire.

48:14.880 --> 48:15.880
That's why this is so diabolical.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.880
He's not really coming out, guys.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.880
He's not coming out and saying don't take it.

48:21.880 --> 48:28.880
If he says, well, teenagers probably, probably shouldn't take it.

48:28.880 --> 48:31.880
And that's why you know, that's how you know.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.880
He came to be on Bobby's team.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.880
And then he never said one damn word about the vaccine.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.880
Is Peter McCulloch trying to get on the Bobby train?

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
No.

48:41.880 --> 48:46.880
Is Peter McCulloch saying, don't take the kids' shots.

48:46.880 --> 48:51.880
Your damn right he is.

48:51.880 --> 48:58.880
And that's gigantic because that's what separates Robert Malone from Bobby.

48:58.880 --> 49:02.880
It's what separates Robert Malone from so many of the people on this side.

49:02.880 --> 49:10.880
It even separates him from people like the Braggons who have been speaking up about this stuff for years.

49:10.880 --> 49:18.880
But it most certainly separates him from Bobby because he has not spoken once, not one time,

49:18.880 --> 49:22.880
about the vaccination schedule and why would he?

49:22.880 --> 49:28.880
He's been advocating for vaccines and their testing

49:28.880 --> 49:33.880
and technologies for their fill and finish.

49:33.880 --> 49:43.880
And he's been working with companies like Solve on on flu vaccines with people like hair-funded motion.

49:43.880 --> 49:48.880
This guy has had his uniform on for 20 years.

49:48.880 --> 49:53.880
And now just because he's not wearing it and he's on vacation or retired,

49:53.880 --> 49:57.880
you think that his values have changed?

49:57.880 --> 50:00.880
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.880
Now that we can see through this guy, what do we know?

50:04.880 --> 50:09.880
How do the pieces move on the board when Dr. Peter McCulloch says, you know what?

50:09.880 --> 50:13.880
If I was a mom today, I would forego the vaccines.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.880
Wow.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.880
Wow.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.880
I mean, wow.

50:21.880 --> 50:25.880
Do you think Robert Malone's ever going to say those words come up?

50:25.880 --> 50:32.880
He's never going to even approach the possibility of saying those words.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.880
And that's how you know.

50:35.880 --> 50:38.880
That's how you know.

50:38.880 --> 50:43.880
You can just see it because people either continue and climb all the way out of the cave and go,

50:43.880 --> 50:48.880
holy shit, was it dark in there?

50:48.880 --> 50:54.880
Or they stop right before the hole and they start reading stories.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.880
And that's what this guy's doing.

50:57.880 --> 51:02.880
He's stopping right below the hole, kick the ladder out of the way,

51:02.880 --> 51:04.880
let the light come down a little bit.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.880
He's telling stories and making shadows with the light from the hole.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.880
That's all he's doing.

51:09.880 --> 51:15.880
He substituted the fire with another light source and we're getting a little more fresh air.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.880
That's it.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.880
Nothing else.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.880
And we're so close, ladies and gentlemen, how close are we?

51:23.880 --> 51:28.880
Because Peter McCulloch just freaking climbed out.

51:28.880 --> 51:30.880
Peter McCulloch just climbed out of the hole, man.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.880
It's just fantastic.

51:33.880 --> 51:38.880
Let's listen to this, this most interesting disambiguation wizard.

51:38.880 --> 51:44.880
So that's where the vaccine should go and we should not be vaccinating everybody else because we're just going to create a monster over the long term.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
Of a resisted virus.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.880
And then our vaccines are not going to be useful for anything.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
See, so the vaccines are good.

51:50.880 --> 51:59.880
It's just that mass applying a vaccine which builds immunity to the spike protein is going to push that virus in weird curvy ways.

51:59.880 --> 52:07.880
And once it goes in weird curvy ways, we're going to have viral variants that affect everybody.

52:07.880 --> 52:12.880
It'll just be a disaster, but that's 100% wrong.

52:12.880 --> 52:20.880
It's 100% wrong because all the control group is going to be fine.

52:20.880 --> 52:25.880
And it's not the virus that's changing, ladies and gentlemen.

52:25.880 --> 52:29.880
It's the transfected people.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.880
And that's the worst part of this mythology that nobody seems to have grasped yet.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.880
Not even really me.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.880
But that's how this story has its motion.

52:40.880 --> 52:48.880
That's why when you open the books pages, the little people pop out.

52:48.880 --> 52:55.880
That's how it works because the immune system of the transfected people is being weakened.

52:55.880 --> 53:03.880
And maybe they're building a tolerance to coronaviruses that allows coronavirus infection to be more sustained.

53:03.880 --> 53:08.880
Maybe it allows it to become more severe.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.880
Maybe it'll take a while before anything happens.

53:12.880 --> 53:20.880
But in no way shape or form is coronavirus becoming stronger because people are being transfected.

53:20.880 --> 53:24.880
Think about how dumb that sounds when you say it out loud.

53:24.880 --> 53:32.880
The virus is getting stronger because people are being transfected.

53:32.880 --> 53:37.880
No way that makes any sense.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.880
There's no way that makes any sense.

53:39.880 --> 53:48.880
But what we can imagine is that the people who are being transfected are being permanently altered in a way that makes them sick more often.

53:48.880 --> 53:57.880
And using PCR to decide how they're being sick is just plain ridiculous at this point while we're winning.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.880
We're winning with this steady pressure, ladies and gentlemen, we're winning.

54:02.880 --> 54:06.880
So the last part of this whole logic now that I rolled out with Peter Navarro.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.880
This is not a plug for Steve Bannon.

54:08.880 --> 54:13.880
On his war room on Saturday, I actually drove up to BC to the recording studio to talk about this.

54:13.880 --> 54:20.880
The other part of this is we got to emphasize drugs for those people that aren't vaccinated that do develop sickness or do end up in the hospital.

54:20.880 --> 54:24.880
And preferably for those people, right now we've got to sit for those people that are outpatients.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.880
Right now we've got a situation where if you get sick with COVID and you go to the emergency room, they say,

54:28.880 --> 54:31.880
come back when your lips are blue, and then maybe we'll treat you.

54:31.880 --> 54:37.880
And they send you out the door with anything? No, they send you out with a pat on the head and the direction to come back when you're really sick.

54:37.880 --> 54:43.880
This makes it so that the disease progresses in all these people, like you and me, if we happen to get this delta variant and we aren't already vaccinated.

54:43.880 --> 54:47.880
So the logical thing to do is to make drugs available and promote them.

54:47.880 --> 54:55.880
Actually, when they sent those people home at that time, when they had low oxygen level and they couldn't breathe and it was painful, they probably already had pneumonia.

54:58.880 --> 55:04.880
And so they sent them home with bacterial pneumonia and told them to come back when they're really sick.

55:06.880 --> 55:11.880
How many people would they have to do that to on average before something terrible would happen?

55:14.880 --> 55:16.880
You see what we're dealing with here?

55:16.880 --> 55:23.880
We're dealing with a very carefully crafted narrative where you drive really fast past the truth.

55:24.880 --> 55:32.880
And because he's telling a story and you're paying attention and the suspension on the car is really good, you don't notice the potholes.

55:32.880 --> 55:42.880
You miss the homeless people. You don't see the blood. You don't hear the gunshots because the car is so silent and the doors close with such a...

55:46.880 --> 55:49.880
And that's what this guy's doing. That's what the TV does.

55:50.880 --> 55:59.880
It takes you through the inner city where everybody's dying in a luxury sedan with NPR on.

56:00.880 --> 56:04.880
And you go through this like all the lights are green.

56:05.880 --> 56:12.880
And before you know it, you've had a little conversation and he lit a cigar and before you know it, you're back in the northern suburbs.

56:13.880 --> 56:21.880
And you're talking about bullshit. You're not talking about people dying from remdesivir anymore.

56:21.880 --> 56:24.880
You're not talking about people dying from being over ventilated.

56:24.880 --> 56:28.880
You're not talking about people dying because they weren't given antibiotics.

56:28.880 --> 56:32.880
But just said, oh, or back to the care home.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.880
Not talking about any of this.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.880
Because that's not his role.

56:38.880 --> 56:43.880
His role is not disambiguation wizard. It's exactly the opposite.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.880
And that's how fifth generation warfare works.

56:48.880 --> 56:52.880
People look into the camera and they tell you exactly the opposite of what they want you to think.

56:53.880 --> 56:56.880
Exactly the opposite of what they want you to know.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.880
And this guy is the master.

57:03.880 --> 57:11.880
He's been doing it since day one. I don't know who else is on his team, but I'm sure there are more.

57:13.880 --> 57:16.880
But there's no way to see it anymore.

57:16.880 --> 57:27.880
There's no way to see it because none of these early appearances are a guy in tears because he's afraid 10 million people are going to be damaged.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.880
Don't you hear this?

57:31.880 --> 57:35.880
He's not worried about people being damaged by this technology.

57:35.880 --> 57:44.880
He's worried about the virus being encouraged to get worse by this technology's working really well.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.880
Please tell me you can hear this.

57:49.880 --> 57:55.880
This is not a man who's warning everybody that we need to pause this whole idea of

57:55.880 --> 58:00.880
transfecting healthy humans because transfection ain't immunization.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
That's not what he's saying.

58:03.880 --> 58:21.880
He's saying that him and his colleague from Solve agree that this vaccination into the teeth of a pandemic is bound to piss the virus off and make it angry and make a global catastrophe.

58:22.880 --> 58:30.880
So how is that questioning the spread of a novel virus or the fact that we have to do something or that the mRNA worked or that it's gain a function and it will come again?

58:31.880 --> 58:34.880
It's not questioning at all. Is it?

58:35.880 --> 58:41.880
Because he's not coming out to save everybody in 2021. Now is he?

58:43.880 --> 58:46.880
So the people get them as soon as possible after they started developing disease.

58:47.880 --> 58:50.880
Everybody off positions all over the world have been shouting this and being censored.

58:50.880 --> 58:53.880
So Peter Navarro, people in Canada are losing their license.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.880
People in the UK are losing their license.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.880
We're saying it's very message.

58:57.880 --> 59:07.880
Now there's a statement out from the licensing board, the governance licensing board for all the states in the United States for physicians saying that if you circulate medical misinformation, say things that aren't otherwise approved, you're at risk for losing your license.

59:07.880 --> 59:10.880
So now I'm at risk for losing mine because of this new policy.

59:11.880 --> 59:21.880
And as it, you know, magically, today we have announcement by Tony Fauci in a talk session at a think tank in DC where he's rolled out.

59:21.880 --> 59:27.880
Oh, now we need to focus on drugs and developing drugs and getting drugs out to the people as soon as possible after they get infected.

59:27.880 --> 59:32.880
But oh, by the way, drugs that he's focused on are the new ones that the pharmaceutical industry has patents on.

59:33.880 --> 59:34.880
He's not talking about hypermechanics.

59:34.880 --> 59:35.880
He's not talking about hydroxychloroquine.

59:35.880 --> 59:41.880
He's not talking about pomodidine or stolocoxid or monoluchast or any of these other agents that have been shown to have activity.

59:41.880 --> 59:45.880
He's talking about the new stuff that the pharmaceutical industries are developing and have patents on.

59:45.880 --> 59:46.880
But this is a huge shift.

59:46.880 --> 01:00:01.880
Peter Navarro and I predicted this last Saturday is that there had to be a great pivot that Tony Fauci was working on how to manage that because the data coming out of CDC, that leak slide deck, just puts, you know, makes the lies transparent, makes it so clear.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.880
What's going on and that we've been misled.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.880
They can't deny those.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:12.880
Don't you understand how amazing the Scooby-Doo is because they are convincing you that you've been misled.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:19.880
And that leaked slide deck is clearly evidence that you've been misled.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.880
And so it's really like they're.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.880
It's like a double cross.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.880
You know, you, you.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.880
It's really extraordinary what they've done to us because.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.880
And then he leads us right by the nose.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.880
How many times did he say leaked CDC slide deck.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.880
Does he have to keep repeating that phrase over and over?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.880
Is that part of the neuro linguistic programming that's going on here.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880
And so what else made the lies transparent.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.880
The redacted emails, the leaked messages from Slack.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.880
The diffuse proposal that was leaked from a D.O.D. server.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.880
What other things make the lies apparent.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:29.880
What other things make us feel like teenagers with a big dog solving a mystery by pulling the mask off of a monster to find out it's the shopkeeper.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.880
Come on guys.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880
This is awesome.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.880
We are really so close to breaking this wide open.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880
Miss led.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880
They can't, they can't deny those things now.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880
They have to deal with them finally.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.880
And in particular, I don't think I mentioned one of the key things in the CDC said deck is it shows that by their own calculations.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.880
We cannot control the spread of this virus.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:58.880
With these leaky vaccines, even if 100% of people take it and perfect mask compliance from everybody.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.880
Even with that combination, we still can't control this.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.880
Perfect mask compliance from everybody.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.880
We still couldn't control the spread.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.880
Is that saying that masks work or don't work?

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.880
I think it's saying that masks work.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.880
And even if everybody used masks and everybody took this vaccine, we wouldn't stop the virus.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.880
Well, he's right above that.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:33.880
Spread by the CDC's own calculations, which is why you saw, you know, I don't know if you caught Aaron Burnett having a meltdown on CNN and all of this, you know, this, this flop flop.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:40.880
It's going on by the CDC director and Tony Fauci, et cetera, is that they kind of been caught in the lie.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.880
And now they're having to confront the fact that everybody can see it.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.880
The press can see they've been lied to.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.880
And they're now having to in, you know, out in the open with all of us able to see them.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.880
They're having to come up with a whole new storyline and promote it.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880
And that's what's going on today.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.880
So, Dr, let me, let me, there's a lot of stuff on packs there.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.880
Let me start with just to make sure I understood and our audience understands clearly what you were saying.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:18.880
Are you suggesting that the report that you saw that leaked out of the CDC is that the CDC has basically admitted that the vaccines don't offer any long term protection and in fact, millions themselves do more harm than good.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880
That's my first question.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:28.880
And number two, they've got to change the narrative to medicines as opposed to vaccines because medicines are probably where they should have started first as opposed to vaccines.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880
Dr.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:39.880
So, on the first point, no, they're not quite yet to owning the fact that the vaccines in many age groups are provide cause more damage more risk to people than the disease does.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.880
They're still not coming clean on that one, but they are coming clean to some extent.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
You know, remember, this is a leaked document.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:55.880
They didn't intend this to go public art are clearly acknowledging that these vaccines are leaky and they don't provide protection, full protection against infection replication and transmission to others.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:05.880
Furthermore, they're very clear that the levels of replication in people that are vaccinated when they get infected are at least the same if not a little bit higher than in people that haven't been vaccinated.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880
And I saw that.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.880
Because that's the other ticking time bomb right now, it's that the sign of potential antibody dependent enhancement.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.880
And that's that's the big bomb that's sitting underneath all of this.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880
But have they come clean on the risk benefit ratio?

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880
No, they haven't.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.880
Dr, can you define now to the drugs as you say per toning.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880
That's exactly what we predicted.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:32.880
And by the way, when I did my threat assessment back in the beginning of January, 2010, when I got on the fourth, I did my assessment and I said our only option in the short term is going to be drugs, particularly repurpose drugs.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.880
And that's what I've committed my team to ever since for the last year and half.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.880
We've had all kinds of barriers put up.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.880
Hopefully we're about to finally get FDA approval to proceed.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.880
But we had to drop by vermectants in our testing because they just threw up too many roadblocks for that.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.880
Now, that's that feeds into another storyline that we now know from this new data.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:58.880
So in August of 2021, he's still working on getting you a for certain combinations of repurposed drugs.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:05.880
That I find a little surprising. I guess I didn't hear that when I scanned this video before. That's that's interesting.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:18.880
There was another thing I wanted to say there, but I'm never going to get done up. I keep interrupting Israel showing that, in fact, I bring back an administered early on in a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial in Israeli adults is showing significant benefits.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:28.880
So I just I need to I didn't want to get too far away from defined for me and in turn for our audience when you what you mean when you say leaky by vaccines.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:37.880
So the the vaccines are have been calculated based on the clinical trial data, which there's some evidence that that was manipulated in some ways.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:43.880
But the official calculation is that they provide 90 plus percent protection against death and disease.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:55.880
What they don't tell you is that and I think we talked about this in the last time we came together, but they don't tell you about is that they didn't know how effective they are at preventing infection by the virus replication and particularly transmission.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:05.880
Remember, I made the point that all of this talk that we had to have 70% vaccine uptake to get to herd immunity was just a BS because they didn't have the data to actually calculate how much vaccine uptake they needed.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:16.880
Now they're saying based on the Israeli data that there's some indications that there the ability of the vaccine Pfizer to protect you from infection is something of the range of 60%.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.880
So 40% unprotected for anyone person getting encountering the virus in aggregate.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.880
So it doesn't protect you from completely at all from infection.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.880
It absolutely per the CDC if you do get infected.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:35.880
So what is he talking about here? If Jessica Hawkins data is correct.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.880
If the numbers that she has are correct and there's absolutely no evidence of spread.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:49.880
If he knows that dexamethasone and remdesivir are being used to grossly over inflate the numbers because of a financial incentive to do so.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.880
Why isn't he talking about that here? But instead talking about the spread.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.880
And how effective or not effective the RNA is at stopping spread.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:07.880
We're talking about details of something that should have never been rolled out in the first place.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:14.880
And not talking about the things that are being done in order to make it possible for this thing to be rolled out.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.880
That's the thing that's the point that Mark has been trying to make so long and he gets so breathless because people don't seem to understand it.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:34.880
We shouldn't even be having this conversation in August of 2021 about how well the mRNA is working because we should have never been able to scare people into thinking we needed it.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.880
If we hadn't have used the combinations of drugs that he's talking about include remdesivir.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:08:00.880
And if we would have been honest about whether there was spread or not, if we would have been honest about not sending people or not giving people antibiotics, if we would have been honest from the very beginning, we wouldn't have needed to roll out and mass into the teeth of a pandemic.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.880
The mRNA.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.880
But he's not talking about that.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:19.880
He's not connecting the fact that his parading around in the background in 2020 was part of the Ant Hill that was shuffling around to get all this stuff going.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:32.880
He's not talking about the fact that all of that shuffling around and all of that ignoring remdesivir from April onward was the reason why anybody or many people were dying to begin with.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:56.880
And the concept that those two are disconnected from one another that the whole reason why he's able to be a year and a half into it still going after emergency use authorizations is because of perpetuating this narrative about a dangerous virus and delta spreading and are not factor eight.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.880
He can't have one without the other.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:13.880
He can't not sustain that narrative if he's also going to be pushing a combination of drugs in the background as a leading trial dot it out, whatever he is.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.880
And we're never going to get to the point where we can use inhaled vaccines or vaccines that are muculsily targeted with genetic material.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.880
If we don't get rid of this, this mRNA shit that's not under patent anymore.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:38.880
But he's got to walk a very fine line because he doesn't want to say there's no virus because we've got to have vaccines in the future because he's got the patents for him.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:49.880
He doesn't want to say there's no virus because he's trying to get you a's and getting it on that side game a little bit by consulting with people who want to get on that side game a little bit.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:10:06.880
You know, like Steve Kirsch that he was talking to almost every hour at this time because that's what he said on the Paul control video that he's talking to Steve Kirsch almost every hour at this point.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:15.880
We are pushing back. We are pushing back hard to get your body are the same or higher than people who were never vaccinated in the first place.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:25.880
And it doesn't protect against your ability to infect a third party and it could well be that those higher levels of virus replication when you do get infected leads to even better infection than with the alpha virus variants.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.880
That's what the numbers would say they are not at eight.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.880
So this is incredibly infectious.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.880
As you say the data randomly infectious and my wife was pulling through the press article this morning.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.880
She noticed that what they are doing is again and again again the press is saying, oh this hospital is full and that it's all anecdotal.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:52.880
And it doesn't account for the fact that much of this hospital traffic has actually been delayed treatments for elective surgeries and things like that that people have scheduled because they felt that we were finally coming out of the cloud of carbon.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.880
Schedule elective surgery tomorrow as you know, you know, you got to get in line.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.880
And so much of the surge in the hospitals is nothing to do with COVID.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.880
I think you kind of touched on that in your opening there.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:10.880
So, so the press is clearly pushing the story still pushing the storyline of universal vaccination that the unvaccinated of the problem they're killing the rest of us.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880
Blah, blah, blah.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
It's so bad.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
Our hospitals are filling up the data.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
As you say, do not support that.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.880
That is just more scare tactics.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.880
Maybe that's going to change, but not right now.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.880
Dr. Daryl and I had a long discussion about the question I want to ask you.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.880
And we were convinced ourselves that it was going to be a very controversial question.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:34.880
And I want to ask you the question, but I want to premise it by saying if, for whatever reason, you choose not to want to answer the question, we'll respect your opinion.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
Okay, fair enough.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Dr.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:47.880
Some people who are not medical professionals have instincts and they, on lots of different things, they seem to know, at least for them,

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.880
what might be right and what might be wrong.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:12:04.880
And my question to you is that the Biden administration is unmercifully chastising blacks and minorities who have chosen not to get the vaccine for their own particular reasons as being anti American racist, whatever you want to call there.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880
They're going after them with a vengeance.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.880
But there's a part of me that wants to ask you the question.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.880
Maybe intuitively the blacks and minorities who have refused the vaccine are smarter than the rest of us.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880
I'm totally okay talking about that.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:25.880
So we talked about this before a little bit, you know, that these groups have prior experience with the heavy handed government when it comes to public health.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.880
And we mentioned Tuskegee as the poster child for this, but there are many others.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:41.880
There was a study done that was published in one of the main newspapers of the day at things new times that looked at the level of knowledge of people that were.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:49.880
Vaccine hesitant, I think, is the term that's used the politically correct term, which is to say the ones that aren't accepting the vaccine. They're not necessarily rabid, both anti-vaxxers.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.880
You know, they're not go big tree, but they are in the same position of, hey, I'm not convinced that this makes sense for me.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.880
And so the study was done. Are these people just basically the uneducated?

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.880
You know, we've heard the deplorables or other things, you know, these are the deplorables that are uneducated that are refusing to take vaccine or what.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:14.880
It turns out they're very highly educated and have very good understanding of the issue, perhaps because they have to defend themselves to all their peers that are saying, I mean, that's so why aren't you taking the vaccine?

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.880
But in fact, the evidence is that the people that are not accepting vaccine have a very high degree of understanding.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.880
So this fits into the meme of the sheeple versus non sheeple.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:30.880
And the data kind of supports the people that are in this position of being vaccine hesitant are actually more informed than most of the ones that are just saying go along and get along.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:41.880
So, you know, if the these various subpopulations that you're referring to that are characterized by their, you know, by the skin color, but, you know, for instance, just to make the point, I have dark skin.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.880
But I'm not African Americans, I'm not a vaccine that I took it, but I wish I hadn't made me sicker.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.880
But I don't think you can really define people by their skin color.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.880
Does he have dark skin to you?

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.880
The hell is he talking about?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.880
He's got dark skin.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.880
Did he really just say that?

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:04.880
I'm a little confused what just happened there. Did he really say that he has dark skin and he's not vaccine hesitant?

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.880
The other guy used the word blacks. Can we use that word?

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Is that allowed? Does that, does that, I don't even know how that rule works anymore?

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.880
That doesn't sound like a word that they use on TV very often, blacks.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880
I don't know.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.880
It seemed a little, but that's the name of their thing.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.880
I think it's more about their culture and that's my personal opinion.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:33.880
And these cultures that you're identifying being reluctant, I think a lot of them, as you say, have experiential wisdom.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.880
It goes back off in generations and a healthy skepticism.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.880
And in this day and age, I got to say, who can you trust anymore?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.880
That's my message all along has been, but the government owes us.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.880
I agree with Mark. He actually looks surprisingly like Morgan Friedman.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.880
It's just he's missing some freckles. I mean, other than that, it's practically the same.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.880
The government is supposed to give us full disclosure and they need to let us make our own choice.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.880
And if you want to just go along with the party line, that's your choice.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.880
I'm not telling you what to do. I'm not telling you to take vaccine or don't take vaccine.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:08.880
My position is get educated, make your decision about what works for you and your body and your risk factors.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.880
And then go.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.880
So he's not telling you whether to take it or not. Do you hear him?

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.880
He's not telling you whether to take it or not. It may have 2021.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:29.880
I wrote in a article where I said that we should pause and everybody should stop.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.880
At that time, I didn't realize that it was as bad as it was.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.880
I really thought that it might be doing something also to the virus. I didn't.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:46.880
I hadn't become so introspective on the biology of RNA yet and therefore I haven't really learned.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880
How bad.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880
The.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.880
How bad the mythology was.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.880
Now, if I could add one more log to that part.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.880
I have some colleagues that have developed artificial intelligence and machine learning based tools.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880
You can load on your cell phone.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.880
Pretty much all of us have got one now.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.880
Maybe grandmother does it.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880
But for the most part, we all have smartphones.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880
And you can load these applications on your smartphones.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.880
He and answer a little questionnaire about your characteristics where you live.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.880
And they will give you a numeric risk factor for what your risk is of getting hospitalized or dying from COVID.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.880
And why don't we have something like that? Why isn't that distributed by the government?

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880
The government wants to do us good.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.880
They ought to give us the information, give us a tool to figure out our own risk and enable us to make informed decisions.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.880
Not take this authoritarian.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.880
You know, you're going to.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.880
Did you hear that?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.880
He just said.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.880
Am I sparking out here? I feel like I'm sparking out.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.880
He just said that why doesn't there, you know, these A.I.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.880
These A.I. things exist.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.880
And you could just put it on your phone and you could tell your A.I.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.880
You could tell your A.I. where you live and your characteristics.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.880
And it could give you generic risk factors for COVID.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.880
You know, based on where you live and your lifestyle and your body fat and all other stuff.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:15.880
Why doesn't the government do that for us so that we can make informed decisions about what we should do next?

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.880
Why doesn't the government give us an app on our phone where we can put in all of our biological data?

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.880
And then the A.I. can tell us what to do?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.880
Why doesn't the government do something like that for us as Robert Malone?

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.880
Why doesn't the government give us an A.I. on our phone that will tell us what to do, says Robert Malone?

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.880
He and, you know, answer a little questionnaire about your characteristics where you live.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.880
And they will give you a numeric risk factor for what your risk is of getting hospitalized or dying from COVID.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.880
And why don't we have something like that?

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Why is that distributed by the government?

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880
The government wants to do us good.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880
They ought to give us the information.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.880
Give us a tool to figure out our own risk and enable us to make informed decisions.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.880
Not take this authoritarian, you know, you're going to do this or else.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.880
We're going to make it so you can't get employment and you have to get tested every week and spend $250 a test.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.880
And all this kind of crazy talk that we're all, you know, being shoved down a throat.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.880
And why is the Biden administration doing this?

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.880
I don't know.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.880
It seems so self-defeating.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.880
I mean, those populations you just talked about and the angry mothers and the young adults that are being forced to take the jab

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880
when they go back to university.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.880
That's it.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.880
Those populations don't vote democratic.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.880
It's going to be hard times in River City for this locian company.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.880
So I think that they're just cutting off their nose.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.880
Despite their face.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.880
I don't understand it.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880
Doctor, I have one more question.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880
Then we're going to go to Daryl.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.880
I'm going to call.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.880
So it's really all about votes.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.880
It's not about saving lives or, you know, it's about governance.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.880
It's about politics.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880
It's about power.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880
And influence.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.880
It's not about saving kids.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.880
He could just say right now, if I had one message, because he asked him, what is the one message you want to give to my viewers?

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:57.880
He could have said, well, I'd like to tell all those college kids that it would be better to take a year off than to take a shot to go back.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.880
Because that's what I said.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.880
And I can't believe how many people wouldn't do it.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.880
I can't believe how many people thought that was crazy.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.880
But that's really what we should have said to all of them.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.880
And that would have ended this nonsense in one fell swoop.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.880
But nobody had the balls to say that.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.880
At least of all this guy.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Because he wasn't coming out to save us.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.880
He was just coming out to make sure that we didn't stray from the narrative.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.880
That we didn't stray from the faith.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.880
That there was a novel virus that was called Delta at this time.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.880
That we had to do something and we probably should probably work pretty well.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.880
But it won't work if we give it to everybody.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.880
I mean, masks don't even work if we give those to everybody.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880
But then goodness, we did something.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.880
And it might come again because, you know, they were doing, they were fooling around.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880
And that's coming later.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880
We're going to get them to come in later.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880
The whole time.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880
So they're all getting ready.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.880
Doctor, I want to try and answer your question.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.880
Your recent question will lie.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.880
Darren, I've discussed this and I believe and I've written that this is all destruction.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.880
Why we're back on the virus and vaccinations and testing and all this stuff is that the

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:17.880
Democrats realize they got a problem called the border, called inflation, called rising

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.880
prices of gasoline and food and lumber and everything else.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.880
And the American people are not happy.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.880
So the Democrats have to go back to fear and that's COVID and the new Delta virus to distract

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.880
the American people using fear as a weapon to distract them away from the other problems

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.880
that are going on in our country.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.880
So that's my answer to you.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.880
I like that hypothesis a lot better than there's a grand conspiracy at Davos between George

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880
Soros and Bill Gates and Tony Fauci.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.880
That's what you just laid out as real policy.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.880
And in my experience, that's the way the world really is.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.880
These grand conspiracies that happen among rich people, maybe they happen, maybe they don't,

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.880
but they don't invite me.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.880
But that, which you just laid out, that's real world.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.880
And I think there is probably a lot of merit to that.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.880
You might guess you at any time you want.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880
Daryl, it's up to you.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
Alrighty.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:05.880
I think there's a lot more merit to the idea that there are people on both sides of the

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.880
aisle that are working together to do this and has nothing to do with Democrat or Republican,

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.880
but they damn well would love you to think it does.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.880
They would love you to think it does.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.880
What do most people in America think of this guy right now?

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.880
Do they think of him as blue or red?

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.880
I have the feeling that the people on the view think of him as red.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:31.880
They might even think of him as white nationalists.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.880
And that's an illusion.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.880
Mark Hewsatonic, Mark Koolak has shown us over and over and over again in this guy's history

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.880
that him and his wife have supported everybody on the left.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.880
They've praised Peter Hotez.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.880
They have praised Barack Obama.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:22:00.880
They have lambasted the idea that the election was stolen.

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:06.880
This is incredible times, ladies and gentlemen, because the illusion is breaking.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.880
The House of Mirrors, somebody is going through the House of Mirrors right now.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:16.880
Mark and I are going through the House of Mirrors right now with hammers.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.880
And every room that we enter becomes less difficult to navigate once we leave it.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.880
And the House of Mirrors is running out of rooms, ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.880
so people are starting to find the way out.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.880
Well, you know, Dr. Malone, I love you, brother.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880
I mean, you still rock.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.880
All right, the question I have for you is, do you find it strange that after, I mean,

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:48.880
the virus is, it is basically a man-made virus used for, some people call it warfare.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880
Okay, we can deal with that word.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880
And it was released.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:23:01.880
Do you find it strange that Fauci and the rest of the fun bunch really disavow themselves from it?

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:06.880
So, to your point, let's take a ride in the way back machine.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.880
And remember, once a long ago that Mr. Biden came out and said,

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.880
we're going to get to the bottom of this lab leak hypothesis.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.880
And I'm going to ask, and I'm going to insist on the CIA giving me the full story.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.880
And we're going to get to the bottom of this right away.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.880
And then it has been nothing but crickets chirping ever since.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.880
And that, but I swear, after he did that, I saw his face get long ever since.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880
He just seems to have kind of gotten grim.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.880
And I, you know, this, you know, this is like, did he finally get access to the Kennedy?

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.880
Of course this is on, you know, too.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.880
It, it sure looks like he had it come to Jesus moment and he didn't like it very much.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.880
And, um.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:46.880
I'll give you the lingola.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.880
For your archiving pleasure, I suggest you watch it.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:56.880
There it is.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:04.880
I mean, many of my peers are increasingly of the opinion that this has hallmarks of a product of gain of function research.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.880
The thing that I can't, which is a fancy way of saying that manufactured.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880
The thing I can't.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.880
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.880
You didn't sneak out the back door and move on.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.880
And yes, the signs are that both my friends at DOD and the good Dr. Fauci.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.880
Um, you know, we're told that you cannot do gain of function research.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.880
And so they, they kind of pivoted and said, oh, it's okay.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880
We're going to let the Chinese to cook for that makes a lot of sense.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.880
And we're going to send them a bunch of money to do it.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.880
Um, so, so there's those, those, those red crumbs of this.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.880
So gain of function research and coronavirus has definitely happened.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880
Uh, is this the product of that gain of function research?

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880
This is another one of those.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880
It looks like a duck.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880
It walks like a duck.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880
It quacks like a duck.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880
But how can you approve?

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.880
It's a duck.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880
Um, you know, maybe it's a pigeon.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880
Uh, but it sure looks like a duck.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880
And, uh, the thing I can't sort out and I don't know.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.880
Anybody can is did it escape out the back door at the Wuhan lab?

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.880
You know, by, and they're filling the blank.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880
There's a number of ways that could happen.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880
There was an event in the laboratory.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.880
People got infected and then they walked around and spread it because it has a long

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.880
prodrome period was somebody selling dead carcasses from laboratory animals

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880
out the back door to go to the secret.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880
A long prodrome period.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.880
Who else used that word?

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880
Dr. Giordano used that word.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880
I think he called it a predrome.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880
Predrome old period.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.880
I mean, we're talking about the worst kind of Scooby-Doo being laid out right here

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.880
just right before your eyes.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:35.880
Just like the leaked CDC slide deck reveals that they've been covering up the

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880
fact that the vaccine won't stop Delta.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.880
And covering up the fact that natural immunity only lasts for about six

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.880
months, just like the vaccine.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.880
How cooinky, dinky, curious is that now we can't say the vaccine doesn't work

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880
because our own bodies don't work.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.880
And now he's telling us that another sort of kind of leak thing

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.880
where people are slowly telling us the truth.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.880
It's all being done with the same tactics all the time.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.880
Making you feel like that you're watching a mystery being solved.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.880
You're catching people in their lives.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.880
Masks are being removed.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.880
And eventually there's going to be a perp walk.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:28.880
And one of these really fancy lawyers, you know, like Thomas Wrens or

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.880
I don't know, Barnes or somebody else is going to be

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.880
standing at some podium saying we brought justice.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.880
It's not going to happen.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.880
The market would be, you know, or, or, you know, animals off experiment.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.880
That kind of thing totally makes sense.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.880
Having worked at the Primate Research Center, you know, there's always

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.880
interest in recycling lab animals after they've been used any way you can.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.880
And if it was a country like China where you got people eating, you know,

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.880
buying live animals in a market, it's located just a couple blocks from the

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.880
fiberball GS to kind of why wouldn't that happen?

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880
You'd expect it to happen almost.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.880
They'd have to have pretty tight controls to keep it from happening, you know,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.880
the janitor, right?

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880
You know, look at the collection.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880
It's all like, hey, I can make an extra buck or yen or whatever the monetary thing

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880
is.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880
And you know, how can you say this wouldn't happen?

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.880
The other thing that could have happened, and you mentioned the word

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.880
biowarefare or bioweapon, there's no way to rule out that somebody didn't

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.880
let this puppy lose intentionally.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.880
And who would have let, who would want.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.880
And that's the trick about clones that everybody needs to understand.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.880
If you let this puppy out intentionally and you only had a glass full,

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.880
it wouldn't go anywhere.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.880
If you let this puppy out intentionally and you had it aerosolized

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.880
and you had several liters of it and you applied it in the right place,

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.880
it could go somewhere for a while.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.880
Fill it, fill a plane full of it, and it could go somewhere for a while.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.880
But like the original SARS virus that infected roughly 10,000 people

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.880
and killed 700, there's not really much more that a clone can do.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:10.880
But what it can do, if applied widely enough, is be cloned.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.880
I mean, sorry, be sequenced.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.880
And that sequence can be shared.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:20.880
And so people in Italy and in Iran and Wuhan and in Washington

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.880
can all find the same sequence.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880
And it can be very high fidelity.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:32.880
It can be very easy to culture and get a very high fidelity sequence read on it.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880
And is he going to tell you that?

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880
No.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.880
Is he going to explain to you why it would be very rare for an RNA to do this?

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.880
No.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.880
He's just going to talk about how it got out and how it would be almost impossible

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.880
to stop it from getting out.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.880
But if it doesn't get out in sufficient quantities, where's it going to go?

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880
It's going to go nowhere.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.880
Nowhere.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.880
Nowhere.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880
It's not quite a watch, okay?

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.880
But it's kind of like a watch.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.880
You make a really fancy watch that works really well.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.880
You put it out on the street and people can make it.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.880
And they've never seen a watch before.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.880
Somebody might try to make it.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.880
And somebody might be able to make it pretty well, but not very many people.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.880
And the ones that can make it well will be able to sell those watches that they make.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.880
But they won't go very far either because those people won't be able to repair them

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.880
and they won't want to make them.

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.880
And some people will learn how to make those, but they won't be as good as the original ones

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.880
because the original one is much better.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:43.880
And if you don't have that one to look at, you don't really have a model to make.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:48.880
And so if you make the most perfect watch in the world and you put it out on the street

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.880
in the most perfect watchmaking city in Switzerland,

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:58.880
it's not going to take over the whole watchmaking industry and spread all around the world

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.880
until everybody was wearing that watch.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.880
No matter how good it is, because that's not the way the way this thing works.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.880
That's not the way these things work.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:16.880
And if there is an occasional virus that is detectable in that way,

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:22.880
is uniform in that way, it's not able to pandemic because, as he just said earlier,

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.880
genetically each of our responses is unique.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:34.880
Just like our genetic code is unique, our immune response is based largely

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.880
on genetic sequences found in our genome,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:43.880
which are generated by the combination of immune sequences from your mother

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.880
and from your father.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:51.880
And that combination, by definition, is unique even from your brothers and sisters.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.880
And therefore, when a virus moves through you and it avoids your immune system

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:02.880
and able to replicate because of its fitness

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.880
because of its shape or however you want to imagine it,

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.880
when it encounters the immune system of your family member,

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.880
it's not going to encounter somebody with the same holes in their armor.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.880
Because for the same virus that your brother met,

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.880
he will have a whole different complement of T cells that are aimed

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.880
at a whole different complement of epitopes.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.880
Some of them will focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.880
Some will focus on the end protein, but none of them will focus on exactly

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:38.880
the same epitopes that your immune system focused on.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.880
And so even if the precise fit of this coronavirus was good for you,

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.880
it's not going to be good for everybody around you

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.880
because they too have coronavirus immunity,

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.880
but it's very different than yours.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.880
It's so different, it's unique.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.880
Just as Robert Malone pointed out 20 minutes ago in this video.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.880
To let loose an agent in the literally beating industrial heart of China,

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.880
I doubt it was the People's Republic of China.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:13.880
So I can't resolve these different potential ways that this agent could have gotten loose,

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.880
but the fearing cleavage site and some of the other signs,

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.880
whether or not there is an HIV sequence in there.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.880
The veer and cleavage site,

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.880
so an extra enzyme site makes it possible for it to pandemic,

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.880
according to people like Rick See.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.880
And his evidence is that because when they find a fear and cleavage site,

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.880
they take it out of the flu vaccine.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.880
And so they're real careful about fear and cleavage site with the flu vaccine.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.880
They never put that in flu vaccines.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.880
And so that must mean that a fear and cleavage site in the coronavirus

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:51.880
would mean like a nuclear bomb, you know, like kim.com nuclear bomb.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.880
And so he mentions fear and cleavage site.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.880
He mentions the AIDS sequences.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.880
Why HIV sequences? Why does he do that?

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.880
Because it's a Scooby-Doo.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:06.880
Because he is laying down all the narrative.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:11.880
Maybe he's going to repeat this leaked slide deck again.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.880
It kind of, it looks an awful lot like something that came out of laboratory research.

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.880
But in the sense, it kind of doesn't matter because here we are.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.880
You know, it's gone worldwide.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.880
Now, one of the things about this, all this issue about what happened to women is that...

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.880
So it kind of doesn't matter because it's already gone worldwide.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:32.880
Now, how magical is that if it was a background?

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.880
How magical is that spell that he just cast?

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.880
If this is really just a background coronavirus signal,

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.880
a background exosomal signal, a background RNA virus signal,

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.880
it would have been detectable just as robustly in 2018

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.880
as it was in 2019, as it was in 2020.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.880
And it was the rollout of all these crazy protocols

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880
and the assumption that we didn't know what we were doing

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.880
and that antibiotics don't work on a virus

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.880
that ended up making this disease or this signal

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.880
that was detectable by PCR.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.880
This signal became deadly because of the protocols.

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.880
What if that's the case?

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.880
And that that signal was always there.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.880
And then he says something like this.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.880
But in the sense, it kind of doesn't matter because here we are.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880
You know, it's gone worldwide.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.880
Now, one of the things about this...

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.880
What does it mean if he says that?

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.880
Laboratory research.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.880
But in the sense, it kind of doesn't matter because here we are.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.880
You know, it's gone worldwide.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.880
Now, one of the things about this, all this...

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.880
It means that you've already accepted the faith.

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.880
And so then the only thing left to do is solve the scooby-doo.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.880
You are being bamboozled by this man and others

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.880
to accept the faith in a common novel virus

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.880
for which everyone was vulnerable.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.880
You are being bamboozled into accepting the faith

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.880
that the mRNA was effective

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880
just as we chose the wrong protein

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.880
and that we can't vaccinate it into the teeth of a pandemic

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.880
and that it's the reason why Delta is avoiding us

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.880
and the reason why all these variants will avoid us.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.880
It's not that the transfection is wholly inadequate to augment the immune system.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.880
It's nothing to do with the dangers of transfection.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.880
It has to do with the unfortunate consequences

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.880
of gain-of-function research in a pandemic.

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.880
But it doesn't really matter if it's gain-of-function research.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.880
I mean, yeah, you can tell stories and make people scared,

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880
but it doesn't really matter because it's here now.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.880
But it might be a great reason to take the shot, you know,

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.880
because you don't want gain-of-function long COVID.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.880
I mean, a long COVID was bad before,

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.880
but gain-of-function long COVID.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.880
Now, that shit's bad.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.880
The issue about what happened in World War II

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.880
is that I had this colleague that I published with before

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.880
who works for one of our three better agencies in the government.

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:07.880
And early on, he assured me that this absolutely was not a lably

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.880
and it was not an engineered virus.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.880
Absolutely.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.880
He said, my guys have looked at it carefully

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.880
and it has none of the signs of being engineered.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.880
Well, he said that so early in the outbreak

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.880
that that in and of itself is a little odd.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.880
And he told me the story that the Chinese had this amazing infrastructure

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.880
that they'd spent over a billion a year on for years and years

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.880
after the SARS outbreak designed to contain any SARS-like virus,

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.880
whole bunch of infrastructure.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880
Now, clearly, that didn't work so good.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.880
It's like imagine a line in France to keep the German tanks away.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880
You remember how well that worked.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.880
But they thought they had this.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.880
So one could imagine a scenario wherein an agent was released

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.880
with a full expectation that they would damage the Chinese economy,

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.880
but they would keep it in check.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880
So did that happen?

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.880
I don't know.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:49.880
It's a possibility.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.880
The other thing about this, as you mentioned,

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.880
is that I mentioned the tree.

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.880
So an agent was released in Wuhan

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880
and they thought that China would contain it,

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.880
but they didn't contain it.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.880
So how do we explain what happened in Iran then?

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.880
This is some shady business right here.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.880
This is some magic campfire story shit right here,

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.880
and we've got to wake up and apologize for not seeing it earlier

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.880
because this is some real wicked stuff.

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:25.880
We are really in the midst of uncovering the most malevolent scheme

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.880
in American history.

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.880
People playing both sides of the aisle,

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.880
red team and blue team are hurting us into the avatar as we speak.

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880
That we have with most nations,

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.880
in which we agree that we're not going to produce legal bioworefer agents

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880
and just deploy them.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:44.880
We shut all that down.

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.880
We used to do it.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:46.880
We developed some of the most legal in the world.

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.880
We've never seen before.

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:48.880
We actually tested them in the field.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880
That's no longer classified.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.880
So I can mention it.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.880
We developed some really nasty stuff in the 60s that worked like gamebusters.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.880
But then we signed this treaty with the Soviet Union and others

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880
saying that we wouldn't do it, they wouldn't do it.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.880
But what the treaty doesn't say is that you can't develop and deploy

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:03.880
what are called incapacitating agents.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.880
These are things that make you so sick that you're not willing to go carry a gun

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.880
or fight anybody.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880
You're not willing to do much of anything.

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.880
You know, maybe you've got a really bad headache or whatever,

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.880
or meningitis, but it doesn't kill you.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.880
Well, technically those things are still allowed.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.880
And I can tell you that our government is very aware of that, that's the case.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.880
And that's why they pay people like me, in part,

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.880
but directly or indirectly, is to come up with new systems

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.880
so that make it so that if somebody does deploy an incapacitating agent,

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.880
we have things that will protect our firefighters from that.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.880
But the scenario that you've mentioned, as I'm saying,

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.880
there's no way that I can say who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.880
It's just too twisted up to make miracles.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.880
Well, I mean, you gave a very nice explanation of it.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880
And it was kind.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880
I like what you said.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:46.880
It was very kind.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.880
And instead of just saying, excuse me,

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.880
now you're in pharmaceuticals.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.880
At first you were doing this, Fauci.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:54.880
Now the whole fun bunch is on another level.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:04.880
Can we accurately say that the HIV AIDS virus was data functioning?

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.880
No.

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:12.880
That has been traced really thoroughly back into primate populations in Africa.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.880
So that one has pretty well been run to ground.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.880
Now, I can tell you that having been discovered,

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.880
people that I used to work next to at UC Davis,

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.880
we're busy doing data function research and creating hybrid viruses

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.880
between the human AIDS virus and the monkey AIDS virus

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.880
and putting inside of kinds and other things

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.880
to make those recombinants more pathogenic.

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:32.880
And they thought that was perfectly okay.

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.880
When I objected to them, they did everything they could to drive me out of the laboratory.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.880
But we talked about this before, you know,

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.880
there are some kind of science people that they think that they...

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880
That sound wasn't in my room.

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.880
That seems to confirm the idea that Gallo was mixing a bunch of sarcoma viruses

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.880
in a dish to try and get them to recombine in the nastier things,

01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.880
which is what that guy that was lost his mind over the AIDS virus

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.880
and did all those really nice documentaries said for a very long time

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.880
and that he even confronted Gallo in a videotaped press conference

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.880
where Gallo made fun of him for saying that he did that stuff, but he did it.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.880
And here's Robert Malone regaling the same tale

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.880
and about how he said it wasn't a good idea either.

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.880
Is he absorbing that guy's story right now

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.880
and pretending that he spoke out against the recombinant

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.880
fooling around with sarcoma viruses from different animals?

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.880
Is he really saying that? I think he is.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.880
Are sufficient smartness and training and status

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.880
but they should be allowed to play with their toys

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.880
and we don't have the right to tell them not to.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.880
And clearly that's not the case.

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.880
And somehow we've got to reign those people in

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.880
and make it so that if they do play with their toys in ways that we all agree they shouldn't,

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.880
they lose their right to have anything to do with this space.

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.880
And it's not okay when we say no, no, no, you can't do that.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.880
You can't play with your toys like that.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.880
They just go offshore and go do it through surrogates in China.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:11.880
That deserves a pretty heavy response in my opinion, but nothing is being done.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.880
You know, there's no consequences.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.880
And so what do you think is going to happen next time?

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.880
Everybody's going to look at that and they're going to say, well, who cares?

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.880
So what? Those are the rules. I can do whatever I want because you're not going to come after.

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.880
Right? Isn't that the way that works?

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.880
That's the way it looks like it works. I mean, in modern times.

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.880
If I can go rock the Bank of America down the street and everybody says, oh, that's okay, boy.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.880
You know, you are smart and well educated and we're not going to do anything about it.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.880
Next time I might, who needs an ATM?

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.880
So how come that doesn't apply to vaccines? How come that doesn't apply to countermeasures?

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.880
How come that doesn't apply to working on DOD contracts?

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.880
Of course it applies to that. It's what he's describing himself when he's laughing about that.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.880
Who needs an ATM when you can get government contracts?

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.880
Who needs an ATM when you can get no bid government contracts?

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.880
Who needs an ATM when you can work for DITRA and contract for people who work for DITRA?

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:12.880
Who needs an ATM when your best friend who used to sleep on your couch is the head of science DITRA?

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:17.880
So, you know, I just don't know what to say. There just doesn't seem to be any rules anymore

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.880
that apply to these people that are in these positions.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.880
The thing that's blown my mind is the justice that this happened a couple weeks ago.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.880
The justice department, the Biden administration got their justice department to put down a decision

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.880
saying that the FDA is not bound by the common rule and all of the federal law that has to do

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.880
with clinical research protections for human subjects.

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.880
So, yeah, that doesn't mean that remember tough TV.

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:46.880
You're right. And there's now a formal opinion that the FDA doesn't have to abide by those rules.

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:53.880
I thought Congress got together and said, hey, why is he smiling so much?

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.880
I'm going to go to bed because it's 11 o'clock and I don't want to cut it off so short,

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.880
but I also don't want it. I don't want it to go any longer.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:09.880
And I'm done. I gave you the stream once. I'm going to give it to you again, or the video, rather,

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:12.880
so that if you want to watch the rest of it, you can.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:26.880
And if you find something interesting, please give me a link to it and we'll get on with it from there.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:36.880
I don't know. I just feel like at some point, you know, the message is out and we've got to just keep pushing.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:44.880
All we got to do is keep pushing. Remember that I think that they told us that there was a novel virus, but there really wasn't.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:49.880
And there was probably a clone which they used to seed the pandemic in different places.

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.880
And depending on how much clone they actually distributed it and how they distributed it,

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.880
many people could have shown various symptoms depending on what that clone was.

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:09.880
If it was a clone of the entire virus or just a transvection of the spike, any of these would have been expected to cause some kind of immune response.

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:16.880
Now, if the goal was to sequence the virus and make sure that it was many places, they would have used the whole clone.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:23.880
The point is that they rolled this in with influenza and any other respiratory virus

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:30.880
and any other poor person with multiple core morbidities that they could as long as the PCR test was positive

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.880
or as long as they could manage to sneak them in.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:41.880
And I think in places like New York City, some really nasty things went on in order to seed the narrative.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:46.880
Something really bad had to happen in New York for everybody else to believe what was going on

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.880
in order for these protocols to be enforced all around the United States.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:45:00.880
And the protocols allowed this graph down here to happen and their plan is really to take it all away from us.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.880
It's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen. It's really for all the marbles.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:07.880
It's for your kids' futures and it's for your grandchildren's futures.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:13.880
It's for all the marbles. If you want to talk to me or chat with me, you can go to GigaOM.Bio

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:20.880
or you can go to GigaOMbiological.com and you can find the soapbox link, which will also take you there.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.880
This has been GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Street brought to you by a biologist.

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:32.880
Transfection is an immunization and injection of any combination of chemicals into your muscle

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.880
in order to augment your immune system is dumb.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:42.880
Again, stop all transfections and humans because they're trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:49.880
Thanks very much for joining me, guys.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:55.880
There's been a lot of people here tonight. Wow, a hundred something. That's really great.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:01.880
I am Katniss, Susie. Fun times. I see a lot of people. I recognize. I'm really happy.

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.880
I hope you're seeing how much work I'm putting in.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:14.880
I hope I'm doing all of my subscribers service here and making them proud.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:20.880
It's three years, man. Three years we've been doing this now.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:27.880
Really, really three years we've been doing this. Thanks very much for making it possible.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.880
Don't forget to check this out. It's a really good introduction to me.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:39.880
If you want to share something that somebody has never met before, this would probably be the one.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.880
And then after that, we can invite them to the stream and push them into the deep end.

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.880
Thanks, guys.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:06.880
Keep the flashlight forward, baby. Keep the flashlight forward.

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:10.880
Love you, Pamela. Good to see you, Jason. M.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.880
Meltdown. Lisa.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.880
The Baeke.

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.880
I don't know what that is, H.I.D.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.880
Garden variety, humans. Good to see you.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:27.880
You can apply six. All you guys, thanks for joining me. I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.880
You got to watch the whole one, though, Piano Fab. Not just half of it.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.880
The part where I start drawing is actually the best part, so if you haven't seen me drawing, you're missing it.
