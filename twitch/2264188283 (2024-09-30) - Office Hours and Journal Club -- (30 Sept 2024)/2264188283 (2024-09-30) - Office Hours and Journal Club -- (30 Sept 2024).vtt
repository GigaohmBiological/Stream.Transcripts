WEBVTT

00:28.416 --> 00:28.477
Bye.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.347
Something's wrong there.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.227
Hold on a second.

02:00.529 --> 02:01.510
Oh, I see.

02:01.570 --> 02:01.970
Hold on.

02:02.010 --> 02:02.550
I got that.

02:02.730 --> 02:03.151
I got it.

02:04.812 --> 02:05.492
Let's go back.

02:07.454 --> 02:08.875
We will make sure we go back.

02:13.158 --> 02:14.539
My bad on the sound.

02:14.579 --> 02:15.639
That's why we do this.

02:15.759 --> 02:20.363
We got to make sure everything is set up correctly and this is quite a goofy little rig I got here.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.645
Let's see if we can pull that off again.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.770
Chickens are loud, it's raining outside.

02:30.332 --> 02:32.714
And the purpose is to rid the planet of certain people.

02:33.034 --> 02:36.557
I believe that AIDS in reality is not a natural accident.

02:36.617 --> 02:39.199
It's not a natural disease that just sort of evolved.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.400
Somebody cooked it up.

02:41.041 --> 02:49.968
I think that it's something that either escaped from a genetic engineering laboratory or something that was manufactured on purpose in a genetic engineering laboratory to somebody's specifications.

02:50.828 --> 02:55.610
I also believe that all the warfare of the future will be conducted with these biological agents.

02:56.110 --> 03:08.774
Because now that gene splicing is a thing that can be done, it is feasible to consider the preparation of certain diseases which will kill only specific races, nationalities, or people with certain interests.

03:09.374 --> 03:14.356
Because you can tailor the disease to attack certain things in certain categories.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.042
For example, there are diseases now which affect only certain types of people.

03:19.302 --> 03:22.383
Ty Sachs disease, which affects certain Jewish people.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.104
Sickle cell anemia, which affects black people.

03:25.824 --> 03:39.990
If you want to narrow it down and carry it to ridiculous extremes, I could see somebody in an American laboratory, or maybe even in a Swiss laboratory, making a disease that would kill only Iraqis, or only Iranians, or only Libyans, or only Russians.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.310
Let's look at the world the way it really is.

03:42.551 --> 03:43.571
Government is a joke.

03:44.111 --> 03:45.392
Governments don't do anything.

03:45.472 --> 03:48.653
That's like a cardboard cutout that hides where the real machinery is.

03:49.153 --> 03:51.134
The world is a place that does business.

03:51.834 --> 03:57.777
The world is run by multinational businesses that mostly sell weapons to each other.

03:57.897 --> 04:02.099
Then you have sugar business, oil business, coal business, you know, business.

04:03.059 --> 04:07.821
And when the guys who run these things say jump, all governments jump.

04:08.636 --> 04:15.160
It's foolish to consider the possibility of nuclear war, because from a business standpoint, it's impractical.

04:16.001 --> 04:17.142
It stops all business.

04:17.942 --> 04:31.692
So, the way you have to look at it is, the chances are much more likely that the sales will continue of missile delivery systems, but what will be in the warheads will not be things that destroy real estate.

04:33.186 --> 04:49.737
It's much more practical to think of missiles going someplace and putting out chemicals or microbes that enable the one party to subjugate the other party by controlling its labor force while leaving the buildings intact.

05:11.124 --> 05:25.216
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America.

05:25.376 --> 05:25.796
I don't know.

05:26.457 --> 05:27.298
Crash the dollar.

05:27.518 --> 05:27.938
I don't know.

05:28.499 --> 05:32.422
Steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left.

05:32.642 --> 05:33.163
I don't know.

05:34.724 --> 05:35.685
But I know for sure

05:36.089 --> 05:53.532
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

05:55.686 --> 06:02.432
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

06:02.852 --> 06:05.895
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

06:05.975 --> 06:15.423
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is actually J.J.

06:15.443 --> 06:22.049
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

07:35.461 --> 07:47.510
A man in a silk suit hurries by as he catches the poor old lady's eyes.

07:48.251 --> 07:51.753
Just for fun he says, get a job.

07:54.355 --> 07:55.836
That's just the way it is.

07:58.658 --> 08:00.560
Some things will never change.

08:17.339 --> 08:20.784
Said, hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.870
You don't look like they do.

08:26.032 --> 08:29.737
Said, hey, old man, how can you stand to think that way?

08:30.358 --> 08:33.643
Did you really think about it before you made the move?

08:41.777 --> 08:45.532
Some things have never changed.

08:46.054 --> 08:47.500
That's just the way it is.

09:52.385 --> 09:56.888
Well, they passed a law in 64 to give those who ain't got a little more.

09:57.809 --> 09:59.931
But it only goes so far.

10:01.011 --> 10:10.018
Because the law don't change another's mind when all it sees at the hiring time is the line on the color bar.

10:10.338 --> 10:13.960
That's just the way it is.

10:16.802 --> 10:18.604
Some things will never change.

10:21.186 --> 10:21.886
That's just the way it is.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.788
That's just the way it is.

11:35.223 --> 11:35.344
you

12:11.075 --> 12:12.996
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

12:14.096 --> 12:18.838
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

12:20.238 --> 12:21.999
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

12:23.540 --> 12:24.300
It's embarrassing.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.609
There are just too many sliders for me.

12:35.709 --> 12:36.850
Sometimes I miss one.

12:36.870 --> 12:46.777
I actually had to stop that last slide to acknowledge the fact that Laura Logan asking Russell Brand to baptize her if he stripped down to his underwear.

12:47.578 --> 12:49.259
It's just really extraordinary.

12:49.599 --> 12:53.742
There's no other way to characterize that other than extraordinary.

12:53.822 --> 13:01.708
These admissions, I've learned from a very good friend of mine a few years ago during the pandemic that everything is an admission.

13:02.869 --> 13:15.332
And if you think of the things that happened on stage yesterday as admissions, and evaluate them in that way, you can really see things that you don't normally see if you just listen to the words.

13:15.432 --> 13:23.154
Because remember, your consciousness is the prime real estate they are competing for, and the words that they use are how they access it.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.210
It's charlatanism.

13:26.270 --> 13:31.752
These people are just very, very clever in their use of words, in their coordinated lying.

13:32.392 --> 13:35.573
And we inherited this kind of governance from our parents.

13:35.993 --> 13:37.274
It's not our fault.

13:37.354 --> 13:44.296
We just have to realize and take responsibility as the adults in the room and take back the power from these charlatans.

13:44.336 --> 13:45.236
That's what we need to do.

13:45.916 --> 13:52.006
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

13:52.466 --> 14:00.519
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic simply because viruses are not pattern integrities.

14:01.300 --> 14:05.805
I'm really happy to be here today again, trying to keep up this schedule that I post.

14:05.865 --> 14:06.887
I know I'm a little bit late.

14:07.808 --> 14:17.058
It remains true that their mythology about a mystery virus that can account for the excess deaths that we're seeing is an absolute lie.

14:17.839 --> 14:23.942
And the reason why it's a lie, of course, is because there are a million better explanations for why these people are dying.

14:24.722 --> 14:29.064
And one of them is not a spreading pathogen.

14:29.104 --> 14:39.688
In fact, the way you can see it is by listening to the lawyers that are supposedly coming to our rescue because they can't explain strict liability and they can't explain the Seventh Amendment and how it might apply here.

14:39.728 --> 14:44.090
Because again, this is a coordinated group of liars trying to cover up

14:44.730 --> 14:45.730
the murder and lies.

14:45.790 --> 14:56.513
The murder and lies, of course, were used to make sure that we did not usefully wake up to the idea that the vaccine schedule in America was already a criminal enterprise before the pandemic started.

14:57.053 --> 15:07.476
The transfection in healthy humans would have always been criminally negligent and thousands, thousands, thousands of academic biologists should have known better.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.361
And RNA cannot pandemic.

15:11.401 --> 15:15.062
And again, thousands of academic biologists should have known better.

15:15.102 --> 15:16.923
They should have been able to figure this out already.

15:16.963 --> 15:24.826
But because of the way academia works, none of them feel responsibility to do so.

15:26.647 --> 15:32.750
And of course, this illusion of consensus that was created by this absolutely magnificent

15:33.909 --> 15:35.090
set of meddlers.

15:37.131 --> 15:41.374
Also made it very hard for academic biologists to come out and say it.

15:44.246 --> 15:52.290
And that's because we are transitioning to a new kind of totalitarianism first described by Aldous Huxley, brother of Julian Huxley.

15:54.551 --> 16:03.535
And it's just an extraordinary mentor chain that we have been following back to these ideas and how united

16:04.875 --> 16:15.940
All of these acolytes are in their appreciation for these scholarsly ideas about how mankind should take control of his evolution as a species.

16:17.998 --> 16:20.800
And the population pyramid is the hidden explanation.

16:20.900 --> 16:25.184
The real biology is that they knew a bunch of people were going to die.

16:25.224 --> 16:29.707
They've known it for decades, and they took advantage of this to stage the plandemic.

16:30.808 --> 16:38.835
And they've added people to their team, their cover-up team that covers up the murder and lies that can be explained by this list.

16:38.895 --> 16:41.136
And the list is longer than this, of course.

16:42.130 --> 17:05.172
Perhaps a couple of the most egregious things missing from anyone's explanation are the supplementary oxygen and how pure oxygen is deadly, and the opioid deaths, the opioid epidemic in America and how it contributes to the decreased life expectancy in America, which has been a tribute, of course, to COVID.

17:06.758 --> 17:13.722
So weaponized piles of money have used their acolytes on social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

17:15.222 --> 17:24.908
And by arguing with them, we have accepted the premise of the state narrative, the state narrative being bioterrorism, bioweapons, climate change, racism.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.142
You know, some rich guys are good, some are bad.

17:30.563 --> 17:32.484
That's the theater that governs us.

17:32.744 --> 17:42.650
And because we have acquiesced to using social media as a substitute for free speech and direct communication, we are very susceptible to this type of governance.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.790
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to know who you're talking to, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

17:46.810 --> 17:48.411
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

17:48.471 --> 17:49.913
I grew up in northern Wisconsin.

17:49.953 --> 17:57.660
I became a biologist as a bird watcher with my grandmother, as a snake catcher and a rabbit keeper.

17:59.864 --> 18:03.726
And then I grew up to be an academic biologist wannabe.

18:03.806 --> 18:08.268
I chased tenure for about 20 years, doing everything I thought I needed to do.

18:08.308 --> 18:13.931
You can find the stain of that work on PubMed by just looking for C-O-U-E-Y-J-J.

18:15.531 --> 18:26.877
And you can find a whole list of things here, a whole list of experiences I've had in the last four years that might suggest that I've seen an alien that a lot of other people who claim

18:27.737 --> 18:30.007
to have seen the alien actually have not.

18:32.458 --> 18:39.240
Anyway, if you're, you shouldn't probably be, you're probably not watching at stream.gigaohm.bio right now.

18:39.320 --> 18:46.863
And that might be because our server isn't strong enough to support the live stream for a bunch of people, but some people can watch there and it works okay.

18:47.283 --> 18:51.345
There's also a archive there, a previous broadcast that we maintain.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.385
There's a clips channel.

18:53.645 --> 18:56.406
There is a calendar that I'm trying to follow the, the,

18:58.067 --> 19:02.193
The videos of Biology 101 and Uncertainty 101, the course that we're doing are there.

19:02.273 --> 19:04.236
The books that you need to download are there.

19:04.256 --> 19:04.316
And

19:07.921 --> 19:14.825
The Batcave is there, which is a significant archive of videos, and Housatonic also has an archive there.

19:14.865 --> 19:16.326
So it's a pretty nice place to go.

19:16.346 --> 19:21.269
No algorithm, no login, paid for by viewers just like you.

19:22.649 --> 19:25.911
And so it would be really great if more people would share that.

19:25.971 --> 19:27.952
It is doing really well, I have to admit.

19:29.275 --> 19:46.548
my channel personally is over 30,000 views and that's you know that's that's a channel that that social media doesn't share and and you know this is all just linear growth produced by people like you um and it's really awesome because uh i'm starting to believe that

19:47.208 --> 19:55.694
by just keeping going, that Mark and I are going to make some serious progress and eventually become self-sustaining.

19:55.754 --> 19:56.935
I mean, that's the hope.

19:57.956 --> 19:59.877
Whoa, that's pretty loud.

19:59.897 --> 20:03.200
I don't know why that text disappeared.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.281
I guess I did that wrong.

20:07.717 --> 20:10.119
It is the 30th of September, 2024.

20:10.439 --> 20:11.440
I'm very happy to be here.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.281
This is an Office Hours, Journal Club thing.

20:13.301 --> 20:17.444
We're just going to talk about a few things, just trying to keep on the air on Mondays.

20:17.464 --> 20:24.769
I'm going to leave Monday kind of open like that with Journal Club and Office Hours so that I can basically do whatever I want as long as I show up on time.

20:26.030 --> 20:29.793
You can see the people there streaming down on the left side of your screen.

20:29.833 --> 20:32.336
Those are some of the supporters of the stream.

20:32.376 --> 20:34.378
Some of the supporters don't want their name up there.

20:35.759 --> 20:44.527
Some of them just haven't gotten their name there yet because I'm still trying to do all of the accounting and name tracking and this kind of thing, so I apologize.

20:45.248 --> 20:47.169
to anybody who might be offended by that.

20:48.430 --> 20:51.331
I still think it's really important to discuss the basics every day.

20:51.371 --> 20:53.492
So I'm probably going to keep doing that for a while.

20:53.572 --> 20:55.073
So you're just going to have to deal with that.

20:55.533 --> 20:57.194
I still think it's really important.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.875
I'm going to get rid of the globe, because that's only useful sometimes.

21:01.296 --> 21:07.739
It's really important to realize that the big picture here is that these people don't want to look at 2020 anymore.

21:07.759 --> 21:08.720
They don't want to look at 2019, 2020, or 2021.

21:11.621 --> 21:26.750
They want you to focus on here and now and going forward and what we have to do now and who we have to work with and we shouldn't critique anyone because it's a unity party with everybody that you would ever want to be on your team already on your team.

21:26.830 --> 21:28.591
So why would we want to reflect?

21:29.151 --> 21:34.894
on what any of these people were doing in 2020 and whether or not they had the principles they claim to have now.

21:35.454 --> 21:45.399
That is the role that the Brett Weinstein-Weinstock meeting that occurred yesterday in Washington, D.C., that was the role that it had.

21:46.434 --> 22:00.720
was to paint this picture, this very false and artificial picture of a group of people that from the beginning have had the principles and have had the leadership and have had the qualities that we needed in order to get us out.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.922
And they have not, they have been working for the narrative.

22:05.819 --> 22:22.766
This is how national security and governance works nowadays, that we have been, again, tricked into using social media as our primary form of communication and our primary form of outward thought projection, gives all that information to them.

22:23.247 --> 22:27.388
And that has been very malevolently turned around and used against us.

22:28.089 --> 22:31.950
And we have been fooled into thinking we solved the mystery of a novel virus.

22:31.991 --> 22:32.791
That's where we are.

22:34.662 --> 22:36.404
Hell, why is my click not working?

22:38.565 --> 22:59.923
And so that's why I think it is important and we'll continue to spend time going back to 2020 to investigate what these people were talking about and how on narrative they were about repurposed drugs, the spike, the fear and cleavage site, HIV inserts, gait of function, lab bleak, databases being deleted, amyloid and prion stuff, neurological effects, cardiological effects, mitochondrial damage.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.025
All of this stuff was seeded in 2020

23:03.266 --> 23:10.811
And if you use the archive that's available to you on YouTube and on other social media, you can verify this claim.

23:11.031 --> 23:27.842
All of the people that were in that meeting yesterday that were on stage or claimed to be adjacent to them were intimately involved in seeding the narrative of the Scooby-Doo Laboratory Mystery Cover-Up Virus Lab Leak.

23:29.464 --> 23:32.586
And by definition, because you argued about that with them,

23:33.618 --> 23:38.503
and very vigorously, you accepted the existence of the novel virus.

23:38.523 --> 23:48.874
You accepted the principle of RNA that can free range around the earth for five years and that we need to be afraid of the possibility that it might go endemic.

23:50.076 --> 23:52.018
All of that biology was built in.

23:52.768 --> 24:07.771
to their initial inquiries, their interesting whistleblower type declarations about the fear and cleavage site or the Indian paper that was withdrawn from preprint status that detailed HIV inserts.

24:08.331 --> 24:22.434
These were all seeded to these people, encouraged, given to these people so that this could seed a narrative that would seed expected outcomes for the rollout of the transfections.

24:23.570 --> 24:29.234
and not just the COVID transfections, but the transfections that are to come for the years in the future.

24:29.294 --> 24:32.736
There is no going back from this if we stick with their plan.

24:33.496 --> 24:48.986
We will eventually accept that the old vaccines were pretty kludgy and that they hurt people or that we should have cleaned them up better or we should have been more paying attention and yeah, but now we've got this new technology and thank goodness

24:49.986 --> 24:54.948
Not only did it save people in the pandemic, but we figured out the problems, the shortcomings of it.

24:54.988 --> 25:02.151
And we can, in future reiterations of this, replace the vaccine schedule with safe ones.

25:02.792 --> 25:10.295
And of course, we just heard Steve Kirsch say that exact thing on Stu Peters and evoke the name of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:10.355 --> 25:15.878
as the guy who in five years would have provided us with a safe vaccine schedule.

25:21.926 --> 25:23.927
I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable.

25:26.988 --> 25:45.978
And so one of the people, one of the many people that I think was wittingly or unwittingly involved, maybe unwittingly placed or allowed to rise on social media before the pandemic, even given some pretty good guests before the pandemic so that he would rise and be present.

25:46.798 --> 26:02.098
and intimately connected with Brett Weinstein or Joe Rogan or any of these people and want to be a part of this, you know, new media podcasting universe is this guy here, Tom Bilyeu, who is, it's called the impact factor or something like that, or impact theory.

26:03.220 --> 26:07.262
And he's got this idea that he's going to teach the youth and that's how he's going to change the world.

26:07.302 --> 26:09.463
And in principle, that's not such a bad idea.

26:09.943 --> 26:18.468
But what is he really teaching the youth by having a podcast on with a bunch of meddlers and liars that are provided to him by these weaponized piles of money?

26:18.988 --> 26:23.330
And so as long as he gives them a microphone, how much is he really helping the youth?

26:23.671 --> 26:28.173
He's more or less helping the military industrial complex that puts these people on his show.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.662
And so, of course, there should be a pretty good example of that, right?

26:32.682 --> 26:44.970
If we were to look back to 2020 and see if Jonathan Cooley is right about this, then there should be pretty conspicuous examples of, oh, wait, from August of 2020, embrace death?

26:46.571 --> 26:49.173
The thumbnail says embrace death?

26:51.174 --> 26:53.256
Gee, I wonder what they're going to talk about here.

26:54.534 --> 27:03.961
Could it be that these people are also wittingly or unwittingly gonna seed a narrative with the expected outcomes for transfection to new proteins in humans?

27:04.862 --> 27:11.647
Could it possibly be that all of the little nuggets would be in a podcast already on August, 2020?

27:12.047 --> 27:12.968
Well, why not?

27:14.269 --> 27:20.134
That's several months after Kevin McKernan has already been on many podcasts explaining everything.

27:20.973 --> 27:28.119
It's already several months after Pierre Cory has testified in front of the Senate as to the disaster that's occurring in New York.

27:30.380 --> 27:41.529
So why not on August of 2020 on Tom's show, why not have somebody and then make the thumbnail say embrace death?

27:44.198 --> 27:47.100
Guys, this episode ended up getting amazing.

27:47.840 --> 27:56.086
Roughly, we'll put the time code, but we got onto an absolutely fascinating topic, and I'll be heartbroken if you don't at least watch that.

27:56.866 --> 27:58.027
So this episode was rad.

27:58.107 --> 27:59.328
I promise you, you will not regret it.

27:59.648 --> 28:06.112
You can go into the beginning where we talk hardcore COVID stuff, or you can skip right to the time code that's gonna be right there.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.154
We'll put it, I don't remember where it was, roughly sort of halfway through the episode.

28:09.995 --> 28:13.197
We got into end of life and some really, really fascinating stuff.

28:13.737 --> 28:14.518
Be sure to check that out.

28:20.555 --> 28:30.479
Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by our sponsor, BetterHelp, an online counseling company with the mission to make professional counseling accessible, affordable, and convenient.

28:30.759 --> 28:38.242
So he was impact theory, but for COVID, he decided to go and do at home and do health theory.

28:38.322 --> 28:48.866
So number one, remember if he is influencing his million followers with an attitude of fear, with an attitude of uncertainty,

28:50.071 --> 29:05.471
an attitude of doubt with an attitude about the worst case scenario, then the people that listen to him will feel that just like if Brett Weinstein wears a bandana and woodshop goggles and says that this is a viable strategy for going to Home Depot and protecting yourself.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.753
then his millions of followers might do that.

29:08.853 --> 29:12.534
They might think, well, I'm not as smart as Brett Weinstein.

29:12.995 --> 29:22.338
And so there are young people that he's been trying to influence, that YouTube is allowing him to influence, that social media owners are allowing him to influence.

29:22.398 --> 29:35.123
And so he's decided to do this promotion of BetterHelp, and he's decided to call his impact theory now health theory, and we're gonna hear about what he thinks and what he experienced during COVID.

29:35.523 --> 29:36.183
I hope you enjoy.

29:37.364 --> 29:40.105
Dr. Jennifer Hay, thank you so much for joining me.

29:40.666 --> 29:43.387
I'm super excited to get this chance to talk to you.

29:43.948 --> 29:44.808
Thank you for having me.

29:44.828 --> 29:45.709
I'm excited too.

29:46.229 --> 29:46.509
Awesome.

29:46.629 --> 29:49.931
So this is a pretty weird time to be in the medical field.

29:50.671 --> 29:52.832
I see your scrubs hanging behind you.

29:53.072 --> 29:59.376
Are you more at Columbia University, the school, or are you more at the actual hospital?

30:00.512 --> 30:06.057
Yeah, so we have a medical center that's associated with our university, Columbia University Medical Center.

30:06.258 --> 30:10.982
I mean, you can see on the bottom here, it says COVID-19 isn't over, and this is August of 2020.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.966
So again, interesting, right?

30:15.006 --> 30:17.228
COVID isn't over, is it gonna go endemic?

30:18.109 --> 30:25.436
COVID long-term, that's what they're probably gonna talk about, protect your health, face death, make death better, culture and death.

30:26.857 --> 30:28.218
Sounds like a great program.

30:28.258 --> 30:29.399
I just can't wait to watch.

30:29.439 --> 30:31.100
We're not going to watch all of it, promise.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.182
And that's where I had spent most of my COVID days.

30:35.202 --> 30:37.423
And is it still pretty hardcore?

30:37.443 --> 30:39.565
Is it pretty hardcore COVID there still?

30:40.345 --> 30:42.506
You know, it's actually calmed down a bit, a lot.

30:42.706 --> 30:46.929
I would say, you know, it was pretty intense there for a while.

30:46.969 --> 30:48.610
I had never seen anything like it.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.591
And frankly, I didn't think that any of my

30:51.238 --> 30:55.861
mentors and older doctors that I have worked with for so many years had seen anything like it.

30:55.921 --> 30:59.984
It was really, it was pretty overwhelming.

31:00.004 --> 31:05.327
The entire hospital became, I would say, probably close to 80% COVID.

31:06.588 --> 31:11.691
Lots of floors had to pop up and turn into intensive care units to manage these patients.

31:12.251 --> 31:19.456
And one day, I walked around and I suddenly saw that every ICU bed had two patients to a room

31:20.091 --> 31:27.813
Every operating room had four patients in a room, all on ventilators, and it just felt like the whole hospital was on a ventilator, and everyone had the same exact symptoms.

31:27.834 --> 31:32.155
The whole hospital was on a ventilator, and everybody had the same symptoms.

31:32.195 --> 31:47.520
Let's just go back and listen to it again, and make sure you realize that if they were being ventilated with pure oxygen, or even 80% or higher, then the medical certainty was that they would go into ARDS in a few hours.

31:48.385 --> 32:04.214
We did a whole journal club on it a couple weeks ago where we looked at medical textbooks and primary literature about it from the past two, from the past five or eight years, not even that long ago, only back to 2018.

32:05.354 --> 32:10.457
And the results and the conclusions are overwhelming in every journal.

32:11.246 --> 32:15.010
that they've known this for years, that giving people pure oxygen doesn't work.

32:15.731 --> 32:16.892
It's not good for you.

32:17.012 --> 32:17.833
It doesn't work.

32:18.534 --> 32:19.515
It can kill you.

32:20.336 --> 32:21.577
It damages your lungs.

32:21.677 --> 32:23.419
It causes ARDS.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.642
It's said it in a textbook.

32:27.853 --> 32:45.209
And so if she's talking about ventilation at the wrong pressure, which was very common because they recommended pressures because Pierre Corey recommended air pressures and oxygen concentrations because people like Kyle Seidel were talking about 60 liters a minute.

32:49.833 --> 32:51.094
We know this is true.

32:52.250 --> 32:56.473
And so let's listen carefully to this lady, because it's an admission.

32:56.793 --> 33:01.957
They don't think they're going to get caught because they're not thinking that they're doing anything wrong.

33:02.698 --> 33:04.159
They're following protocol.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.542
It became, I would say, probably close to 80% COVID.

33:10.803 --> 33:15.847
Lots of floors had to pop up and turn into intensive care units to manage these patients.

33:16.451 --> 33:23.732
And one day, you know, I walked around and I suddenly saw that, you know, every ICU bed had two patients to a room.

33:24.292 --> 33:27.853
Every operating room had four patients in a room, all on ventilators.

33:27.973 --> 33:32.374
And it just felt like the whole hospital was on a ventilator and everyone had the same exact disease.

33:32.774 --> 33:33.594
Everyone had COVID.

33:34.214 --> 33:36.815
And it was really, it was bizarre.

33:36.995 --> 33:40.355
It felt almost like what I would think war would feel like a bit, you know.

33:40.795 --> 33:43.376
So it feels a little bit like, um,

33:44.614 --> 33:49.278
Somebody went into a cave and they saw a bunch of crystals that they've never seen before.

33:50.298 --> 33:55.823
And it really felt like, you know, you were on an alien planet and it was so fascinating.

33:56.343 --> 34:02.208
And I just couldn't believe how beautiful it was to see this uniform pattern and wow.

34:03.989 --> 34:07.732
No tragedy, no trauma, no scarring.

34:10.526 --> 34:23.069
It's like you went past a car wreck where there was a burning school bus and you're fascinated by the screaming and the blood and the smell of burning backpacks.

34:23.289 --> 34:26.910
Like, what in the hell is going on here?

34:28.890 --> 34:29.650
It's like war.

34:29.711 --> 34:30.971
I was really proud, you know?

34:30.991 --> 34:32.591
It was like all the dead bodies around.

34:32.631 --> 34:33.651
Boy, that was cool.

34:37.872 --> 34:39.933
You have your teams and you trust your teams.

34:41.056 --> 34:45.258
You really depend on them to sort of get you through and support each other.

34:45.298 --> 34:46.939
And it was, it was, it was heavy.

34:47.699 --> 34:48.019
Yeah.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.000
That sounds real heavy.

34:50.341 --> 34:52.522
Something everybody seemed to be super focused on in the beginning.

34:52.682 --> 34:54.723
I'd think that that story would have resonated.

34:54.743 --> 34:58.805
It would have been like front page news, somebody telling a story like that.

34:59.285 --> 35:03.367
Now I'm beginning to worry that either because of summer, um,

35:04.347 --> 35:18.652
or just like the climate where people have been pent up, bad things are happening to the economy, obviously what's gone on with the protesting, that people are so fed up with so many things that now- Protesting what?

35:19.152 --> 35:19.852
George Floyd?

35:19.892 --> 35:21.013
This is August, right?

35:21.053 --> 35:30.276
Didn't Floyd 19, as Greg Glassman tweeted, Floyd 19, didn't Floyd 19 go on for like seven months?

35:31.257 --> 35:36.767
There was even a public debate about whether you had to wear a mask or not when you went to... Oh my gosh.

35:37.828 --> 35:39.692
It's an amazing thing they did to us.

35:40.152 --> 35:43.739
It's an absolutely amazing show that they put on for us.

35:46.479 --> 35:50.523
They're acting like the virus will give them a breather.

35:51.223 --> 35:55.768
But you're saying that we're not seeing the sort of explosive need of the hospital.

35:55.788 --> 35:56.889
What do you think is going on?

35:57.049 --> 36:01.613
Is it that it's summer months, it's vitamin D, it's sunlight, it's people being outdoors?

36:02.014 --> 36:04.196
Is it that the lockdown was actually effective?

36:04.296 --> 36:05.677
Is it that the virus is mutating?

36:06.778 --> 36:12.623
What do you, if you had to hazard a guess, and I know that right now it would be- So there went the whole limited spectrum of debate right there, right?

36:12.723 --> 36:14.885
It couldn't have been overblown.

36:14.965 --> 36:18.067
It couldn't have been a misconstrued something else.

36:18.147 --> 36:20.129
It couldn't have been a military operation.

36:20.670 --> 36:22.271
It couldn't have been confusion.

36:23.212 --> 36:27.055
It was definitely a virus, but the virus might be mutating.

36:28.482 --> 36:30.543
Maybe it's vitamin D or something like that.

36:31.043 --> 36:41.568
What I find very interesting about Mike Yeadon's recent promotion of Jonathan Engler and my reflection on it is that one of the first people to come out very early

36:42.529 --> 36:44.470
in 2020 was Mike Eden.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.631
And what did he come out about?

36:46.052 --> 36:48.113
He came out about natural immunity.

36:48.313 --> 37:00.001
And I don't want to be too much of a negative Nelly, but natural immunity is an argument that fits right into the limited spectrum of debate where there is a virus.

37:01.582 --> 37:06.546
It could be novel, but natural immunity would be better than what they're suggesting you do.

37:08.922 --> 37:20.369
And so going in front of the UK parliament and going on social media and saying that natural immunity was a big deal seemed right, and in fact got me to do it for a year or two.

37:21.689 --> 37:24.091
I wrote a review about natural immunity.

37:24.211 --> 37:30.414
I learned the immune system to try and understand natural immunity and being able to teach it.

37:30.454 --> 37:38.099
And by doing so, I accepted the limited spectrum of debate that there is a novel virus, and I didn't even know I was doing it.

37:39.608 --> 37:47.434
And so you could see Mike Eden coming out very early as having not challenged the real narrative at the heart of this.

37:48.055 --> 38:08.850
And so if Mike Eden after four and a half years or five years is now on the No Virus team promoting their books and promoting that clown from Panda that I know to be a liar because of the way that he tried to get me to write a terrible virology review with him that is still available on his sub stack that you can still see

38:09.731 --> 38:22.987
as plain as day is now being promoted by Mike Eden, not my work, not the idea that virology could be explained to a large part using

38:24.594 --> 38:35.780
synthetic DNA and RNA to transfect and transform these experimental methodologies rather than harvesting viruses out of the wild and growing them in culture, which they can't do.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.181
They don't see this subtlety.

38:38.621 --> 38:53.329
Mike Eden is not sophisticated enough to see that synthetic DNA and RNA would be all that they would need in order to seed any of the signals that they claim are high fidelity evidence for the pandemic.

38:54.645 --> 39:00.130
Instead, he's just running around promoting people that we know are meddlers.

39:04.102 --> 39:06.144
I'm very pessimistic at this stage.

39:06.664 --> 39:14.209
And if Mike Eden's a good guy, then I'd love him to come on the show and talk to me about what infectious clones are and explain them away.

39:14.629 --> 39:32.842
And I would love for him to come on and explain why, if there are pharmaceutical companies all around the world with the manufacturing capabilities to make large quantities of pure DNA, that any of this needs to be believed and that virology can't be faked, because it definitely can.

39:33.342 --> 39:43.845
with transfection and transformation, taking advantage of the cells that already make extracellular vesicles, exosomes, whatever you want to call them.

39:45.946 --> 39:49.347
Viruses don't make your cells do something they don't already do.

39:49.407 --> 39:56.469
That means that if you transfect and transform them, it's not surprising that some of that extra DNA and RNA gets packaged and released.

39:58.134 --> 40:08.151
It's not very surprising that you can take whatever supernatant is produced in that transfection or transformation cell culture and put it on another cell culture and then it still shows up there.

40:08.191 --> 40:09.232
That's not surprising.

40:10.270 --> 40:24.700
It's not virology, but it is synthetic molecular biology that can be done in quantity by the pharmaceutical companies using standard molecular biological manufacturing techniques that have been used to make biologics for decades.

40:25.201 --> 40:28.423
You know, the stuff that Brian Artis is talking about with regard to venom.

40:30.905 --> 40:51.943
And so you can see the curation of the narrative, and you can see the curation of the debate about the biology, which actually very, very carefully excludes this space where all of our cells make exosomes or extracellular vesicles.

40:52.003 --> 40:57.348
And some of those extracellular vesicles have proteins on the outside, and some of them have genetic information in them.

40:59.659 --> 41:03.141
and healthy tissues and disease tissues signal like this.

41:04.041 --> 41:13.165
And they have been interested in it since the 80s, when they discovered this part of the immune system in the form of retroviruses.

41:14.026 --> 41:21.109
And people like David Baltimore, Vincent Rackengiello, and many, many others.

41:22.065 --> 41:41.769
have taken virology and run with it, taken virology and like somebody learning recipes, have just replicated it, wittingly and unwittingly, going forward, substituting synthetic DNA or RNA wherever it's needed, or wherever it's convenient.

41:43.810 --> 41:49.011
And here we are, where the signal for AIDS is reverse transcriptase,

41:50.177 --> 42:01.001
attributed exclusively to viruses outside of us and that our own pattern integrity would never use an RNA dependent RNA polymerase or a reverse transcript.

42:01.041 --> 42:02.162
That would be crazy, right?

42:04.382 --> 42:09.624
And decades later, of course, the truth is, is that all of these enzymes are used by our body.

42:10.625 --> 42:12.145
All of these enzymes are present.

42:12.946 --> 42:18.528
All of these signals, packet communication and genetic packet communication is present and they've known about it.

42:19.434 --> 42:43.826
And there are whole faculties that are, or whole labs that are devoted to exosomal communication just in very narrow windows of disease or very narrow windows of questions, not as sort of an investigation into the universal aspect, this universal aspect of all pattern integrities on earth.

42:44.625 --> 42:49.788
It's very likely that from fungi all the way up to higher plants, there is exosomal signaling.

42:50.388 --> 42:51.328
We're surrounded by it.

42:51.368 --> 42:52.149
We're bathing in it.

42:52.249 --> 43:02.954
And it's most likely that the exosomal signaling is the homologue to the phages of bacteria.

43:03.494 --> 43:10.758
We know, and nobody denies that, not even the no-virus people deny, that bacteriophages exist, that bacteria can send

43:12.152 --> 43:17.296
genetic information to other bacteria and then those bacteria get transformed by that information.

43:17.677 --> 43:19.498
There's no doubt that that occurs.

43:20.119 --> 43:21.179
Nobody debates that.

43:21.620 --> 43:30.987
And so the only debate is, is if there is a homologue of this type of communication that exists inside of a multicellular organism like ourselves.

43:31.047 --> 43:32.048
But of course it does.

43:33.069 --> 43:38.713
Our basic biology is based on the idea that our cellular components like mitochondria,

43:39.608 --> 43:49.751
or the cellular components of a plant like chloroplasts, they have all the hallmarks of being symbiotic bacteria.

43:52.432 --> 43:55.212
That's why mitochondria look like little bacteria.

43:55.252 --> 43:56.713
That's why they have their own DNA.

43:56.753 --> 44:03.895
That's why chloroplasts have a glycoprotein coat on the outside, or not glycoprotein, but a

44:06.257 --> 44:09.520
proteoglycan coat on the outside, just like bacteria do.

44:11.422 --> 44:18.530
These are organelles that probably are descendant from single cellular organisms.

44:18.690 --> 44:27.299
If you believe the thing that tie hard Chardin believes, that life has a tendency to complexify.

44:28.584 --> 44:47.558
And that complexification can be seen in multicellular pattern integrities like ourselves, where even our cellular components are actually previously, you know, existing single cellular organisms that have assembled together to form the functional unit of ourselves.

44:47.698 --> 44:55.144
This irreducible complexity is much, much more irreducible than they want you to understand.

44:57.076 --> 44:58.899
And I don't know how in the hell I got this far.

44:59.540 --> 45:01.844
But anyway, let's go back to this video.

45:02.345 --> 45:05.851
If you had to hazard a guess, why are times getting better?

45:07.073 --> 45:08.976
I think it's probably a couple of different things.

45:09.196 --> 45:10.499
One, I think that there was

45:11.127 --> 45:16.549
this latent period where we didn't know the virus was spreading between people and people were getting infected.

45:16.569 --> 45:24.432
And since we know that most people that get COVID have pretty mild symptoms and aren't gonna be that, they probably thought they had the flu or a bad cold.

45:24.492 --> 45:26.233
And so they were home spreading and spreading it.

45:26.273 --> 45:29.534
And then we reached this just sort of massive.

45:29.854 --> 45:34.116
Do you notice how sometimes it's like insistent that it was strange?

45:35.208 --> 45:43.310
And then, but for convenience sake, there's also a tremendous number of people who they can confuse it with the cold.

45:43.711 --> 45:48.132
And there's a tremendous number of people that have asymptomatic and they don't even know they're spreading it.

45:48.252 --> 45:53.574
But then there's this other subset of people that have this super strange disease.

45:54.594 --> 45:56.775
And so I just, I can't square that.

45:57.495 --> 45:58.475
Honestly, I can't.

45:58.715 --> 46:04.397
I can't square that as a manifestation of the same biological phenomenon in multiple people.

46:05.575 --> 46:12.378
I see it as a manifestation of the same psychosis in multiple people, the same delusion.

46:13.699 --> 46:20.162
It's not biology, except insofar as psychological delusions are definitely biological.

46:21.302 --> 46:22.803
Number of people infected.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.144
Psychological delusions are the noosphere.

46:26.428 --> 46:51.309
The psychological delusion that they induced in us was the Scooby-Doo mystery of a novel virus that might be going around that could kill a billion people, that they might be lying to us about how dangerous it is, that maybe multiple infections could be like flying AIDS, like Paul Cattrall said, or Kevin McCarran said, or Harvard to the Big House wrote and got published in the, what is that silly?

46:56.204 --> 46:56.905
Zero hedge.

46:58.646 --> 47:04.471
So this author that Mark and I are exploring and reading, this is not easy reading.

47:04.551 --> 47:07.734
So it's not like we're going to take you through chapter by chapter in a few weeks.

47:07.794 --> 47:13.138
This is like the book that you need to read, need to own for yourself.

47:13.198 --> 47:15.841
It's only like seven bucks on eBay if you want one of these.

47:16.361 --> 47:23.027
I've got a few of them that I was thinking about buying a whole pile of them and then offering them to raise funds and autograph them and then send them out.

47:23.047 --> 47:24.248
But I don't know if I'm going to do that or not.

47:24.727 --> 47:28.808
And now that I said it, Robert Malone will probably buy all these books off of eBay.

47:28.828 --> 47:36.489
But anyway, go get yourself a copy or download the PDF that's available at any link that you can Google and start reading this.

47:36.589 --> 47:44.310
Because the noosphere is this place where humans swim in groups.

47:44.550 --> 47:53.192
So the analogy that I've been using, I think I'm stealing it from Aldous Huxley, or sorry, Julian Huxley, who wrote the introduction to this book.

47:54.042 --> 47:56.684
who wrote the first chapter in this book a few years later.

47:57.964 --> 48:15.555
This book is a book written in the 30s, published in the 50s, and is those two books, this book is in the 63, but these two books are the main reading for Biology 101 to get you in the right mindset to understand

48:16.638 --> 48:31.610
The biology that's in our textbooks was written by people who think like this and whose end goal is to have a set of ideas that are strong enough to pass down from generation to generation.

48:31.670 --> 48:33.872
And what are we talking about here, right?

48:34.473 --> 48:37.735
We are talking, and we've been talking about this since the very beginning.

48:42.299 --> 48:44.521
We have been talking about this since the very beginning.

48:46.550 --> 48:47.871
and this book and this book.

48:52.235 --> 49:11.571
But Brett talked about it, and people have been talking about it for a long time, that the idea is what notions, what structures of thought are able to transmit successfully across generations?

49:12.529 --> 49:19.394
And so the lame version of this that Jordan Peterson and Brett Weinstein have discussed is the meme.

49:20.774 --> 49:33.603
But they've also mentioned, curiously, a couple of days ago, the Catholic Church as being one of these entities which is capable of transmitting information across generations, despite cultural change and technological change.

49:33.663 --> 49:36.805
Remember, this is what this is about.

49:36.865 --> 49:37.986
How do we transmit?

49:38.866 --> 49:53.652
useful and crucial cultural ideas across generations, and the Catholic Church could be seen as being one of the more successful sets of ideas or mythologies, stories, if you will, if you take

49:54.358 --> 49:59.661
if you take Jordan Peterson from yesterday, the stories that transmit the information across time.

49:59.741 --> 50:03.483
So it is interesting that this guy is a Jesuit.

50:03.583 --> 50:10.987
It's interesting that Peter Hotez likes this guy, that Francis Collins likes this guy.

50:11.047 --> 50:17.831
It's very interesting that Alan Dulles' brother was a Catholic bishop and he also likes this guy.

50:20.563 --> 50:32.654
And so Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS has unearthed this idea, this fact, that Alan Dulles' brother was a Catholic bishop and that he was a very prolific writer.

50:33.896 --> 50:38.880
And so some of the things that I would like to share with you are involved in that.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.444
So if I go back, just quick, so you can download them before they're needed.

50:44.788 --> 50:47.170
I'm just going to shift this over to this screen.

50:47.950 --> 50:52.973
And then I just want to show you that our website has been updated a little bit.

50:53.354 --> 51:02.059
And more importantly, if you go down here, you can see that the office hours and everything is listed and it's right.

51:02.299 --> 51:03.180
Let me get this off here.

51:06.335 --> 51:08.357
And if you go down, there's ways to help.

51:08.417 --> 51:13.540
And if you go all the way down here, I just, I don't, I don't, I don't want it to be something that everybody knows.

51:13.600 --> 51:14.601
I want it to be for you.

51:15.241 --> 51:17.363
There is a link down here called stuff.

51:18.564 --> 51:22.747
And so I'm going to try and update this link anytime that it helps.

51:23.187 --> 51:28.351
Um, and I'm just going to keep it running, but it's not going to be, it's not going to be a link that's up here at the top.

51:28.411 --> 51:30.572
You see, it's not, it's not up here.

51:31.593 --> 51:32.814
It's only going to be down here.

51:33.094 --> 51:35.376
And if you go down to the bottom and you click on stuff,

51:36.411 --> 51:56.914
then you'll go to a page where for today you can see the journal clubs and what needs to be downloaded and they're just articles that I've taken from these links that Mark found and I've made them into a fresh text only PDF so you don't get all the and you can find these if you search for the title on Google you can find the original link

51:58.015 --> 52:07.421
At some point, maybe I'll also put the original links under here, but for right now, I'm a little bit limited by my web page template, and so it's just easier for me to do it like this.

52:07.481 --> 52:16.807
I also have a slide deck there from the 28th of September that you can download as a PDF, and then I can keep updating this page, and it'll just keep building up, right?

52:16.827 --> 52:19.829
At some point, maybe we'll have to do stuff 2 or something like that.

52:20.830 --> 52:22.651
But for now, I think this will work.

52:23.311 --> 52:24.172
Hopefully this will work.

52:24.778 --> 52:28.500
And so I think you can just click on these and they'll download.

52:30.822 --> 52:31.822
And is it downloading?

52:32.242 --> 52:32.763
I can't see.

52:39.487 --> 52:39.707
Hmm.

52:41.340 --> 52:41.820
There it goes.

52:42.741 --> 52:46.425
And so this is what I would like to read with you today.

52:46.505 --> 52:52.351
This is an article that was sent to me again by Mark Housatonic, Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS.

52:53.012 --> 52:56.255
And it is an article about Avery Cardinal Dulles.

52:56.956 --> 52:58.858
This is the brother of Alan Dulles.

52:59.819 --> 53:01.581
And it's interesting because

53:03.973 --> 53:06.894
Well, they touch on biology a lot here, actually.

53:07.494 --> 53:15.377
And what I think is the crux of this is a place in scripture where they say that God is love.

53:17.237 --> 53:26.060
And Avery and Teilhard and a few others would make the argument that God is also life.

53:26.600 --> 53:30.582
And I think that God being life,

53:32.885 --> 53:50.556
is a philosophical exploration direction that can lead to a further appreciation of the Creator and humility to the Creator, or it could lead to a false end where you are appreciating creation and man as part of creation

53:52.728 --> 53:53.989
and ignoring the creator.

53:54.029 --> 53:56.990
And so I see maybe a little trap there.

53:57.010 --> 53:59.631
And so again, this is Journal Club, right?

53:59.651 --> 54:01.272
So I'm not trying to teach anything.

54:01.312 --> 54:03.212
I'm trying to learn something with you as we go.

54:04.953 --> 54:13.857
And so again, we're talking about, I guess I wanna, we're talking about Avery,

54:14.827 --> 54:20.551
Cardinal Dulles was a lean man who wrote lean prose, and that he was never prolix.

54:21.191 --> 54:23.353
I don't know what prolix means, and I'm not going to look it up right now.

54:23.373 --> 54:25.674
It makes it all the more remarkable that he was so prolific.

54:26.495 --> 54:34.980
Of the millions of words that he published in his long, productive career, perhaps the most quoted are a handful that make up a certain passage from A Testimonial to Grace, his autobiography.

54:36.201 --> 54:44.447
In articles about him during his lifetime and now in the obituaries that began to appear only hours after his death, we are always reading about that blear,

54:45.939 --> 54:53.385
February day when as an undergraduate at Harvard he took a long walk on the Charles River and he noticed the early buds on the trees and had an epiphany.

54:55.106 --> 55:00.090
It led him from atheism to theism and in short order Catholicism.

55:02.271 --> 55:09.237
I've heard a story like that before where a guy was out in the woods and all of the the

55:10.373 --> 55:17.655
life around him started to kind of reverberate in an extra sort of light or aura and he started to realize that it was all one.

55:17.675 --> 55:21.476
So that's an interesting story.

55:21.536 --> 55:36.921
That typically is the import of the story when it is set as a quote, a sort of verbal paragraph, a photograph somewhere in the middle of one of those engrossing pieces about the scion of Washington aristocracy and how he ended up the prince, a prince of the church of Rome

55:39.602 --> 55:44.706
We understand immediately the spiritual context in which Dulles situated this anecdote from his youth.

55:45.186 --> 55:49.149
But there is also an intellectual context, which requires some explication.

55:49.990 --> 55:53.913
Dulles's own language at that point is, though spare enough, a bit lyrical.

55:54.633 --> 56:04.941
And the image, a young man from storybook background embarks on coming of age adventure that holds great surprises, is romantic.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.804
It is hard to hear the words beneath the music.

56:07.844 --> 56:21.737
In a lecture he delivered toward the end of his life, Dulles rephrased the idea in terms that, being less picturesque, actually do justice to the idea as idea, as opposed to biographical datum.

56:22.217 --> 56:23.638
So let's see if this helps us at all.

56:25.460 --> 56:27.202
This is key to understanding

56:28.484 --> 56:35.491
the position that the Catholic Church takes with regard to evolution and with regard to science.

56:36.211 --> 56:43.318
Remember at some point in time the Catholic Church took the idea that science and

56:44.878 --> 56:47.479
and how God sees the world can clash.

56:47.519 --> 56:52.320
And then, you know, we have to put somebody in jail or something like that because they said the sun is in the middle or something.

56:52.760 --> 56:54.100
That's the history we've been given.

56:54.140 --> 56:55.401
I'm not teaching that history now.

56:55.461 --> 56:56.881
I'm not accepting that history now.

56:57.441 --> 57:10.084
But as far as I understand, there was this time in the Catholic church where they had to make this pivot to accepting science and the progress from scientific perspective of understanding our physical, chemical, electrical world

57:10.782 --> 57:22.670
that there were going to be things that the Catholic Church was just going to have to accept as scientific fact, and they might get in the way of some of the things like, you know, they have said before about what scientific fact was.

57:22.810 --> 57:33.438
And so I think that's where this can best be seen as contributing to a very mature and, sorry, I got a message.

57:43.422 --> 58:05.053
my son is uh my son is unfortunately passing through the fire of freshman year of high school he took a lot of AP courses um and he's been kind of underestimating the requirement to study he's a very sharp kid you know he's a one one

58:06.372 --> 58:34.174
one trial learner a lot of times he's pretty good at math and even when he gets things wrong it's mostly because he's going too fast or he didn't simplify but uh AP history is you know a lot of facts and a lot of dates and a lot of people and a lot of spelling and uh it's not something that if you're not very enthusiastic about it you're not going to keep it track in your head and I think today's going to be the first day where he has a little bit of an awakening about how much

58:35.472 --> 58:41.654
you know, work, just small w work is going to be required to meet the requirements of some of these courses.

58:41.794 --> 58:48.557
Anyway, I just got a text from him saying that his history teacher is mixing up the way that the test is being done, so he might have studied wrong.

58:48.577 --> 58:50.357
And you can hear the panic in his text.

58:50.417 --> 58:52.018
It sucks.

58:52.178 --> 58:56.880
Anyway, here's Dulles' quote.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.881
That's this thing right here, this part that we're looking at here.

59:03.516 --> 59:09.479
The behavior of living organisms cannot be explained without taking into account their striving for life and growth.

59:09.659 --> 59:15.321
Plants, by reaching out for sunlight and nourishment, betray an intrinsic aspiration to live and grow.

59:16.342 --> 59:21.724
This internal finality makes them capable of success and failure in ways that stones and minerals are not.

59:22.124 --> 59:23.945
I think he's talking about a pattern integrity.

59:25.336 --> 59:33.323
Because of the ontological gap that separates the living from the non-living, the emergence of life cannot be accounted for on the basis of pure mechanical principles.

59:33.803 --> 59:38.207
So it wasn't a lightning bolt hitting a mud puddle and then just a tremendous amount of time.

59:39.949 --> 59:40.389
Interesting.

59:42.411 --> 59:43.512
I kind of like this so far.

59:46.866 --> 01:00:01.809
In tune with this school of thought, the English mathematical physicist John Polkinghorne holds that Darwinism is incapable of explaining why multicellular plants and animals arrive when single cellular organisms seem to cope with the environment quite successfully.

01:00:03.189 --> 01:00:09.570
There must be in the universe a thrust toward higher, more complex forms.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:15.811
Materialistic Darwinism is incapable of explaining why the universe gives rise to subjectivity,

01:00:16.974 --> 01:00:18.836
feeling, and striving.

01:00:20.878 --> 01:00:25.903
Now I find this a very interesting concept, the idea that life and pattern integrity strive.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.346
A virus doesn't strive.

01:00:28.406 --> 01:00:34.032
An RNA molecule, no matter what fear and cleavage sites or HIV inserts it has in it, does not strive.

01:00:35.618 --> 01:00:47.468
And that really is a spectacular little quote there, because I think it's right in tune with what people like Buckminster Fuller would rather have us understand biology as.

01:00:47.548 --> 01:00:59.217
And again, I'm referring to this children's book, Buckminster Fuller, To the Children of Earth, where he explains what a pattern integrity is using the analogy of a multi-spliced rope.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.063
And so the emergence of life is unintelligible unless it is assumed to be deeply purpose-driven.

01:01:06.783 --> 01:01:22.212
In characteristic fashion, Dulles presents this not as his own original thought, but rather as a precise of one of three main Christian perspectives on evolution, although it is the perspective that he said himself, he himself inclined toward.

01:01:23.032 --> 01:01:41.401
From his autobiography, we know that his appreciation for the fact of biological life, of bios, preceded, logically anyway, if not necessarily chronologically, with his appreciation for the fact of spiritual life, of which he found to flourish most truly in the environment that is the Catholic Church.

01:01:45.043 --> 01:01:49.385
But to say all that in one sentence is to risk understanding him too quickly.

01:01:49.465 --> 01:01:51.446
First of all, let's stop and pause with him

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:55.243
before the fact of mere bios.

01:01:56.143 --> 01:01:59.265
Does its theological aspect begin to come into focus for you?

01:01:59.365 --> 01:02:00.266
If not, think again.

01:02:00.326 --> 01:02:01.267
Consider Israel.

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:16.516
The literal meaning of Israel in Hebrew is usually translated as the man who strives with God, in accordance with the account in Genesis 32, although both etymology and the Bible story would support a man who strives after God.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:28.863
which speaks even more directly to the intuition that God is what life in its manifold expressions is hardwired to strive after or toward.

01:02:29.664 --> 01:02:30.565
So let me say that again.

01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:40.072
Which speaks even more directly to the intuition that God is what life in its manifold expressions is hardwired to strive after or toward.

01:02:40.652 --> 01:02:43.975
So all life on earth is striving toward the Creator.

01:02:50.009 --> 01:03:08.433
or following the cue that Dulles provides elsewhere in the lecture quoted above, read Bergson, Teilhard, and Polvani, who look at the biological reality from various angles and in unusual frequencies of light.

01:03:09.514 --> 01:03:11.214
God is love, as St.

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:18.576
John wrote so succinctly, and as Christians have never tired of reminding themselves and the world.

01:03:19.582 --> 01:03:20.403
But what about life?

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:21.924
Is God also that?

01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:25.548
To answer that question we would have to define God and then life.

01:03:26.689 --> 01:03:31.133
And such a monumental task I would not presume to undertake here.

01:03:31.714 --> 01:03:33.335
This is again Dulles talking.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.040
Oh no.

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:40.770
Yeah, it is.

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.272
This is dullest talking, I think.

01:03:43.332 --> 01:03:49.675
To answer this question, we would have to define God and then life, and such a monumental task I will not presume to undertake here.

01:03:49.735 --> 01:03:52.157
For my present purpose, it is enough to quote St.

01:03:52.197 --> 01:03:58.901
John, quoting Jesus, I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:15.444
A friend, a liberal nun, for whom the good news that God is love was the air she breathed and the water she drank, once told me that she was shaken when another visitation sister said to her in passing that the Christian promise has two pillars, not one, and that they are love, of course, and life.

01:04:16.224 --> 01:04:25.790
Explaining to me that she recognized the truth of that statement once it had been formulated for her so starkly, she went on to marvel that it had taken her so long.

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.010
She was in her 50s.

01:04:28.553 --> 01:04:36.517
and now she had, too, had an epiphany about the mere, the fact of mere life and that it may be of her own mortality.

01:04:38.779 --> 01:04:40.960
She died of cancer less than two years later.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.240
I don't know how those two things go together.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:50.425
In her case, the context for the epiphany, or at least for her telling me about it, was a cluster of conversations we had recently about abortion.

01:04:51.285 --> 01:04:56.008
More callow than my age, early 30s warranted, I was,

01:04:57.915 --> 01:05:02.557
Troubled to find myself troubled by the thought of unborn children being killed.

01:05:03.398 --> 01:05:05.659
I was even, I thought, you know, against it.

01:05:06.519 --> 01:05:15.324
Immersed in the prejudices of secular university, I had been affiliated with so much of my adult life, I began to worry that I was losing my mental stability.

01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:16.444
What would my friends think?

01:05:16.524 --> 01:05:18.185
Abortion was not high on St.

01:05:18.225 --> 01:05:22.487
Mary's list of injustices, or as I'd say senior, I think it should be St.

01:05:22.507 --> 01:05:25.769
Mary's list of injustices, that as a Christian she felt

01:05:28.274 --> 01:05:32.117
to confront, called to confront, but she listened to me sympathetically.

01:05:32.217 --> 01:05:33.759
Oh, okay, so that's Sister Mary.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:34.479
Sorry, I get it.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.061
Sister Mary's list of injustices.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:42.166
Abortion was not high on this sister's list, but she felt the need to listen.

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:52.815
And she sympathetically and encouraged me to follow through my instinct to take up the cause that was impressing itself on my own consciousness, on my own conscience.

01:05:54.201 --> 01:06:02.505
The rough truth emerging from our friendly little dialogue was that for liberal Christians, the shibboleth is love, and that for conservative Christians, it's life.

01:06:04.246 --> 01:06:08.808
A matter of not clashing values, but of different and complementary emphasis.

01:06:10.449 --> 01:06:23.616
Avery Dulles' particular attraction to the life pillar of his Christian faith directed his mind along paths that, for the most part, believers are anxious to avoid alignment with what they regard as the losing side in a culture war

01:06:25.418 --> 01:06:26.399
Fear to follow.

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:27.539
I got to read that again.

01:06:27.579 --> 01:06:28.400
I guess I read it wrong.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:44.251
Avery Dulles's particular attraction to the life pillar of his Christian faith directed his mind along paths that, for the most part, believers who are anxious to avoid alignment with what they regard as a losing side in a culture war, fear to follow.

01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:56.969
So the pillar of life is a Christian philosophy that few people are willing to discuss because it's a losing part of the cult.

01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.669
I don't get that.

01:06:57.729 --> 01:06:59.330
But OK, I'm not a very good reader, I guess.

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:06.876
In agreement with the magisterium of the Catholic Church, Dulles had no quarrel with evolution per se.

01:07:07.576 --> 01:07:12.420
The problem, which he patiently expounded, is what you mean by it.

01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:14.922
Strictly interpreted, it

01:07:16.634 --> 01:07:27.157
Strictly interpreted, it does not entail materialism, nor is it incompatible with the teleology that informs his view of the life sciences.

01:07:37.242 --> 01:08:05.437
Atheists who exploit or are exploited by the popular misunderstanding about God and evolution that they are mutually exclusive propositions report to us that they have chosen one side in the matter so that they and So that they so that have we if we believe in God The difference being that they as they believe have chosen for truth and we for error so you can see where we're going here where we're going is that the God of the Catholic Church is

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:09.450
uses evolution and creation.

01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:10.410
It's like one thing.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:24.733
And so insofar as the Catholic Church has no gripes with evolution, Darwinian evolution, it also doesn't think that it can explain all the way back to life before it was striving.

01:08:28.134 --> 01:08:33.995
And so there's this interesting sort of incongruity that gets held here.

01:08:35.538 --> 01:08:42.604
as we try to accept all of evolution and science, even the fake knowledge of science.

01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:55.196
It doesn't acknowledge the possibility that the scientific method using, you know, p-values and testing null hypotheses is capable of manufacturing fake or false information.

01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:58.339
That's not part of this view at all.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.541
What it is, is simply a discussion of how

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:13.404
sounds like how Catholicism can exist and within and on top of that ongoing search for something.

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:21.547
And I find it very interesting that this is the way that they talk about it in 2009 or whatever this is because this isn't that long ago.

01:09:22.747 --> 01:09:23.808
This is when the

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:36.444
university system and the academic system and the NIH and the Wellcome Trust and all this stuff are at their finest hour, where most of it is good.

01:09:36.984 --> 01:09:46.946
Most of it is still done with some degree of earnestness and whatever, but the vast majority of it is already on its way out.

01:09:48.286 --> 01:09:50.907
And then 10 years later, you have the pandemic.

01:09:54.150 --> 01:10:08.120
And so this little thing here, where you either believe in evolution and then you don't believe in God, is something that the Catholic Church, I can remember already back from my experience at the University of DePaul, which is a Catholic university,

01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:24.872
Shoot, it might even be a Jesuit university where they were talking about this, this idea that some of those professors in the biology department actually spoke these words in their introduction, you know, that I don't think there's any problem with believing in God.

01:10:24.912 --> 01:10:31.879
If we figured out that evolution has contributed to who we are as a species, then that is just a sort of

01:10:33.365 --> 01:10:39.929
It's information that was available to us, out there to find, that God left there for us to find.

01:10:40.009 --> 01:10:53.758
And maybe he's revealed a little bit about how creation worked, but it's still an irreducible complexity that doesn't get us all the way back to the moment of creation by any stretch of the imagination.

01:10:53.818 --> 01:10:58.581
And so Catholic science doesn't see it as a challenge to them.

01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:00.542
And I think rightfully so.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:17.988
It's a strong position that enables others to sound moderate when they argue instead that the two realms should coexist on either side of a scrupulously guarded iron curtain.

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:29.819
But that's an arrangement that can't be sustained either unless you consistently halt your train of thought as soon as you suspect it's on course to cross and crisscross the border between MIT and the Angelicum.

01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:35.225
The beauty and symmetry found in nature do not by themselves transport us to faith.

01:11:35.305 --> 01:11:35.846
It is true.

01:11:36.627 --> 01:11:37.889
They only direct us to it.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:45.960
Although out of a stubbornness we might, like a dog, refuse to avert our gaze from the hand to what the hand is pointing to.

01:11:47.085 --> 01:12:04.783
on the other side of the border argue, if you wish, that the varieties of religious experience are dispositive of nothing except the robust nature of human psychology, but you would have to be limited by sadly stunted imagination not to take providence as you experience it in your personal life and notice it

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:17.568
You notice in it that something that just begs to be given a chance to try out for the position of organizing principle of life in general, of life in its grand sweep and in its minute intricacy.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:23.332
Call it the biosphere, the web of life you have been observing all these years on God's green earth.

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:27.391
Let's return to Cardinal Dulles' lecture on evolution.

01:12:27.932 --> 01:12:41.501
During the question and answer period afterward, the high school science teacher stood up and asked his eminence if he thought that in the classroom, intelligent design and theories of evolution that had explicit theological content ought to be taught alongside Darwinism.

01:12:42.561 --> 01:12:46.204
Dulles' answer was, in a word, yes.

01:12:47.005 --> 01:12:53.489
He thought that the prevailing form of science curriculum fails to maintain neutrality between theism and atheism.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:13:05.918
It subtly favors the latter and to redress the imbalance, a measure of theology needs to be integrated into discussions, not only of biology, but of all the natural sciences.

01:13:05.938 --> 01:13:07.799
What an interesting fellow this guy is.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:15.082
After a few more questions from the audience, the moderator intervened to make his concluding remarks and thank the Cardinal.

01:13:15.122 --> 01:13:16.303
We stood and applauded.

01:13:16.843 --> 01:13:24.327
As the crowd began to file out of the auditorium, I asked the high school teacher who was sitting near me what he thought of Dulles' response to his good question.

01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:31.072
His whole demeanor bristled with indignation as he said something about laboratories and experiments and the scientific method.

01:13:31.632 --> 01:13:33.113
I said something about the Big Bang.

01:13:33.133 --> 01:13:35.355
He shot back that that was physics, not biology.

01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:38.417
I replied that it was cosmology to be more precise.

01:13:39.198 --> 01:13:48.785
And that anyway, my point was that perhaps his disagreement with the August theologian was not really about science, but about the philosophy of science.

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:54.430
His parting words were that if he did anything like what Dulles recommended, he'd be fired in an instant.

01:13:55.151 --> 01:14:05.259
It was a non sequitur in terms of the logical argument we were proving so lame and attempting to play out here on Fordham Rose's Hill Campus that rainy April evening a year and a half ago.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.243
In terms of the emotional argument that was playing us, however, the comment made some sense.

01:14:10.984 --> 01:14:15.448
You could hear it in the familiar voice of cognitive dissidents being

01:14:17.526 --> 01:14:27.314
being caught as if in a vice between two demands, plain spoken reason on one side and on the other powerful social pressure to disavow it.

01:14:29.937 --> 01:14:31.698
So I think this is an interesting article.

01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:33.560
I'm happy that Mark sent it to me.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:39.685
There's actually a link down here to the original Avery Cardinal Dulles is

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.971
this lecture here.

01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:51.018
And then there's also another article in the same First Things publication that you can click to.

01:14:51.098 --> 01:14:58.747
And this one here is in one of the downloads that you can find over here.

01:14:59.448 --> 01:14:59.628
No?

01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:01.530
I thought I did that right.

01:15:02.211 --> 01:15:03.112
Oh no, I had it up here.

01:15:03.192 --> 01:15:03.893
Sorry, I'm an idiot.

01:15:04.878 --> 01:15:06.900
You can find that here on the Stuff's link, right?

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.840
So these three things.

01:15:08.381 --> 01:15:10.742
So this one is a Time article.

01:15:10.782 --> 01:15:21.511
The one over here is a Time article about him and about, not about Avery Dulles, but about this dude.

01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:27.175
And so that one is one that we're going to look at soon, but I thought I would give it to you already.

01:15:27.215 --> 01:15:29.797
We might look at that later today or something like that if I have time.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:36.023
And then this one is the article that the one that we just read refers to.

01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:37.684
And so this one's also a good one to read.

01:15:37.744 --> 01:15:38.565
It's also interesting.

01:15:38.605 --> 01:15:53.798
So these two and these three are a good way to get yourself excited about why I'm recommending that you read this book, why we're going to read excerpts of it, why I'm taking notes on this in the original PDF and highlighting things so that we can do it in biology together tomorrow.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.893
This is the work that needs to be done.

01:15:56.933 --> 01:16:07.942
We need to understand why it is that we teach biology the way that we teach it, and not in a way that I would say Cardinal Dulles actually advocates for.

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:15.488
Now, I'm not saying I'm going to teach some kind of new Catholic biology or something like that, but I am trying to teach a biology which

01:16:16.409 --> 01:16:43.866
is fundamentally anchored in this understanding that out there and inside of us is an irreducible complexity that should be seen as sacred all around us and evidence of the Creator and our need to strive to fulfill whatever it is that the Creator put us on earth to do.

01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:48.390
I think that's what I find very exciting about the direction that we're moving.

01:16:48.411 --> 01:16:53.504
It feels very, very much more like what I was

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.555
meant to be doing right now.

01:16:55.635 --> 01:16:59.337
And so I'm excited about tomorrow and Biology 101, the fourth lecture.

01:16:59.757 --> 01:17:03.438
I'm excited about going to the fourth class of Matt Briggs tomorrow.

01:17:04.098 --> 01:17:09.640
And again, this is a link which is only found on the bottom of my web page.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:15.722
You actually have to go down to the bottom over here, if I can get this to work.

01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:19.605
You have to go down to the bottom and you have to look down here at stuff.

01:17:19.805 --> 01:17:21.226
That's the only place where it's going to be.

01:17:21.246 --> 01:17:23.167
I'm going to put my slide decks at that link.

01:17:23.647 --> 01:17:28.770
And I'm going to put the notes and I'm going to put the PDFs and the papers that I want you to download there as well.

01:17:29.671 --> 01:17:31.392
So that we're going to discuss something.

01:17:31.432 --> 01:17:35.294
We can discuss it together and you can have these local to you as well.

01:17:35.334 --> 01:17:38.196
So you can share them and use them the way that you want to use them.

01:17:38.216 --> 01:17:43.259
And use them to share the ideas the way that when you make them your own.

01:17:43.319 --> 01:17:44.119
That's the idea.

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:45.080
I think one of the best

01:17:46.089 --> 01:17:59.220
The best things that has happened with regard to my work is seeing these few people that are really taking it on all by themselves and going with it and running with it.

01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:04.384
There are some people out there who have really taken it and run with it.

01:18:04.404 --> 01:18:06.806
And I'm really, really proud and happy that I've

01:18:07.594 --> 01:18:12.618
maybe help to inspire some people to take action as well, because that's what we need.

01:18:12.658 --> 01:18:14.660
We need adults taking action.

01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:17.462
We need adults informing themselves.

01:18:18.223 --> 01:18:21.466
And GigaOM Biological needs you to share our work.

01:18:21.646 --> 01:18:26.911
If it's at all possible, it would be really great if you could help us out by sharing our work.

01:18:29.192 --> 01:18:32.976
This has been a Journal Club presentation.

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:37.286
I think I can do it like this.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:45.133
We don't need to watch the rest of this, but I could go forward a little bit, and I could play for you the part.

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:46.114
Maybe I'll do that later.

01:18:46.534 --> 01:18:53.800
I can play for you the part where she talks about the specifically asks her, because she's a cardiologist, what's going on in the heart space.

01:18:54.381 --> 01:19:02.728
So this is kind of the opposite of Peter McCullough, the exact same medical space, but with the opposite message of Peter McCullough.

01:19:03.809 --> 01:19:05.410
It's in a really extraordinary interview.

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:08.092
I don't know if I used it effectively or not in this Journal Club.

01:19:08.112 --> 01:19:18.640
I don't know if this Office Hours Journal Club thing is going to work as well as me having, you know, a kind of a red thread that I've figured out and want to get to an endpoint here.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:25.005
But I do think for sure that Journal Club and Office Hours will get me online every day on Monday.

01:19:25.025 --> 01:19:26.486
And so that's why I'm going to keep going with it.

01:19:28.588 --> 01:19:31.790
I do think that there is an explanation that leads us out.

01:19:34.468 --> 01:19:39.537
I'm going to escape from that and go down here and do this one instead.

01:19:39.677 --> 01:19:44.665
I do think that there is an explanation that gets us out.

01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:46.388
The explanation can be hinted at.

01:19:47.488 --> 01:19:49.069
if we put pressure on these people.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:20:12.867
And I'm going to keep using this clip because I think it's so vital to understand that even when Brett Weinstein and his wife decided to give me a shout out in 2022 about the word transfection and about how it was the right word, not only did they not keep using it, not only did they not define it correctly in this statement, but they never defined it correctly thereafter.

01:20:13.815 --> 01:20:23.653
It is evidence of their traitorous and malevolent role in curating the narrative that hid the murder and lies in America in 2020.

01:20:26.353 --> 01:20:35.979
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay, but actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:20:36.059 --> 01:20:45.506
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months is as actually J.J.

01:20:45.526 --> 01:20:52.791
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines, right?

01:20:53.877 --> 01:20:58.340
And so she clearly did not say why we should call them transfections, not even close.

01:20:58.961 --> 01:21:07.847
And in fact, implied that we should call them something else, not vaccines, because their efficacy is not as good as other vaccines.

01:21:07.887 --> 01:21:10.108
So they don't deserve the name.

01:21:10.188 --> 01:21:12.670
That's actually what she said.

01:21:17.867 --> 01:21:22.073
And so I think that all of these people can be seen as meddlers.

01:21:23.154 --> 01:21:26.699
The latest person to block me is Jordan Peterson.

01:21:26.739 --> 01:21:29.222
I find that just extraordinary and wonderful.

01:21:29.763 --> 01:21:31.224
I guess I didn't add him to this slide.

01:21:31.264 --> 01:21:33.447
I added him to the first slide in the beginning of the deck.

01:21:34.688 --> 01:21:35.788
What are they covering up?

01:21:35.888 --> 01:21:37.629
What are they not talking about?

01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:39.689
Why won't anybody talk about these things?

01:21:39.869 --> 01:21:40.569
I don't know.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.290
I guess it's because they are the truth.

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:49.091
The first thing that none of these people will talk about is the idea that a background signal could be misconstrued as spread.

01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:59.673
It could be a genetic background signal, meaning an RNA or DNA or some other signal that's in the background that they're just lying about, that they already knew was there, even took,

01:22:00.313 --> 01:22:04.835
the years between SARS and SARS-2 to accurately characterize it.

01:22:05.315 --> 01:22:06.735
Maybe that's what metabiota did.

01:22:07.476 --> 01:22:12.798
And then at the beginning of the pandemic, they roll out tests and they say, oh, look, something is spreading.

01:22:13.518 --> 01:22:15.419
But it was actually a background signal all along.

01:22:15.779 --> 01:22:21.961
The other background signal that they don't talk about is this idea that there were lots of people having babies after World War II.

01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:28.524
And then after this, in the 70s and the 80s, world governments in the West tried to decrease family size.

01:22:29.417 --> 01:22:31.219
by all different kinds of means.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:44.070
And that has resulted in a population pyramid with a little bump that they've taken advantage of, an expected increase in all-cause mortality because we have more old people from the big families around World War II.

01:22:45.572 --> 01:22:53.899
And that expected increase in all-cause mortality used in a military operation, sweeping a few more together to create a sharper peak,

01:22:54.659 --> 01:22:58.621
has been misconstrued as a novel spreading pathogen.

01:22:58.661 --> 01:23:02.504
There's two background signals that none of these people will talk about.

01:23:02.664 --> 01:23:13.030
One of them is some speculation, and one of them is absolutely positively true, and that is the one about family size and the number of old people expected to die in the decade to come.

01:23:15.171 --> 01:23:18.633
None of these people have mentioned this in five years.

01:23:20.097 --> 01:23:35.150
They also won't talk about the many ways that on the academic bench at every university in America and in Europe and around the world, PCR is used to get very high fidelity measurements of the presence of a particular transcript.

01:23:37.752 --> 01:23:46.560
But all of the ways that this methodology is optimized on the academic bench, all of them, all of the ways

01:23:47.574 --> 01:23:54.900
The PCR has been optimized since its invention, has been optimized on the academic bench over the last 20 years.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:07.450
All of those things, all of them were not used in the diagnostics that were given EUA authorizations in America to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.320
None of them.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:14.141
None of the methodological advances in PCR were used.

01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:18.182
Single amplicons, single primer sets, that's it.

01:24:21.863 --> 01:24:25.783
And Jessica Rose, Kevin McKernan, nobody will talk about it.

01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:36.746
Will not list and define the ways, even in its purest form, that mRNA products would never have been appropriate for use in healthy humans.

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:37.846
None of them will talk about it.

01:24:38.971 --> 01:24:43.933
They just want to focus on the contamination and the rushing and the double-stranded DNA.

01:24:44.553 --> 01:24:48.434
And they want to blame all of the bad things on the double-stranded DNA.

01:24:48.495 --> 01:24:49.835
That is their goal.

01:24:50.415 --> 01:25:00.619
I said it for a year or more already, ever since Kevin McKernan and these people were talking about the double-stranded DNA as contamination.

01:25:01.752 --> 01:25:15.877
They will never define the countermeasures as transformations and transfections even after five years, even though they were commercial products and names of categories of commercial products on many websites before the pandemic.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:27.221
Just go to Sigma or some of these life sciences websites where they're dealing in chemicals and other stuff and you can find webpages for transfection and transformation products.

01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:28.682
It's just that easy.

01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:31.880
And none of these people will talk about it.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.582
It was on Robert Malone's resume, for shit's sake.

01:25:39.325 --> 01:25:50.311
And so the term infectious clone, which really just covers up semantically the use of synthetic DNA and RNA in virology experiments to transform and transfect cell cultures in animals.

01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:56.555
And none of these people, not the good guys on the dissident side that work for CHD,

01:25:58.018 --> 01:26:16.643
not the whistleblowers that work for FLCCC and conspicuously not the no virus people like Tom Cowan or Bailey's or Andy Kaufman will tell you that infectious clone is a semantic cue

01:26:17.665 --> 01:26:29.014
a semantic code word for when authors use synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA in cell culture or in animals as a proxy for virology.

01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:32.096
They just won't say it.

01:26:32.677 --> 01:26:43.145
Instead, they asked me to send them papers and said that I was on CHD's team and just part of this big security state operation.

01:26:47.239 --> 01:26:51.262
They are part of the show, just like CHD and Mary Holland is.

01:26:52.963 --> 01:27:01.650
They are part of the curation of a limited spectrum of debate that will never free our grandchildren, will never teach them this biology.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:07.214
And finally, they will never acknowledge that it's pretty clever to say that RNA can't pandemic.

01:27:07.254 --> 01:27:09.195
That's actually about as clever as it gets.

01:27:09.756 --> 01:27:11.077
Try to do it with two words.

01:27:15.342 --> 01:27:16.542
Just sucks for them, right?

01:27:16.582 --> 01:27:23.383
It just sucks because these things cannot be mentioned without them losing.

01:27:25.564 --> 01:27:36.986
That's why the last time that Kevin McKernan and I had a discussion about infectious clones was recorded on Rumble on March 17th, 2023, is still available.

01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:43.107
Why Stephanie Seneff, who recommends this book at the top, was in that video.

01:27:44.284 --> 01:28:10.841
why Jessica Rose was in that video, and why ever since then, Jessica Rose and John Bodwin and Stephanie Seneff and Kevin McKernan will not acknowledge that infectious clones are just transformation and transfection in cell culture, will not acknowledge that pharmaceutical companies can make as much DNA or RNA as they need to make, and it will be a pure quantity that can be made in no other way.

01:28:12.995 --> 01:28:14.255
Because that's what they're covering up.

01:28:16.276 --> 01:28:19.176
That's why those people were in Steve Kirsch's steering committee.

01:28:20.157 --> 01:28:22.657
That's why those people were on podcasts in 2020.

01:28:23.017 --> 01:28:31.699
That's why those people knew that the fear and cleavage site and HIV inserts and overcycling of PCR were the things to talk about.

01:28:32.619 --> 01:28:33.519
Because they were told.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.920
Because they were put in place.

01:28:41.325 --> 01:28:44.108
That's why they don't want to talk about endemicity anymore.

01:28:44.148 --> 01:28:50.254
The thing that Garrett said before the pandemic was the worst case scenario of a bat cave virus.

01:28:50.294 --> 01:28:52.556
The worst case scenario of a lab leak is endemicity.

01:28:54.839 --> 01:28:55.940
That's what you're trying to avoid.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.341
That's what the worst case scenario is.

01:28:57.361 --> 01:29:03.568
And that's exactly what Robert Malone said on Brett Weinstein's podcast was the worst case scenario and the likely one.

01:29:04.369 --> 01:29:10.193
even though Brett said that no, zero COVID is still possible if we could just get everybody to take ivermectin for a month.

01:29:10.734 --> 01:29:14.096
And then Steve said, yeah, silicoxib might be a good thing to add to that too.

01:29:16.338 --> 01:29:17.098
Stop lying.

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:19.320
The reason why they don't want to talk about.

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.581
Stop lying.

01:29:22.062 --> 01:29:33.230
The reason why they don't want to talk about that anymore is because endemicity is absolutely positively undifferentiatable from a background signal because we have no data from before 2020.

01:29:35.168 --> 01:29:42.174
They can say that the novel virus went endemic, but they have no scientific proof for it because we have no data from before 2020.

01:29:44.176 --> 01:30:03.532
And so the more parsimonious explanation is that a background signal has been told to us as going endemic, has been presented to us as spreading to endemicity, when in reality, it's just a background signal, just a noise that they've all conveniently agreed to coordinatedly lie about.

01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:06.969
From Robert Malone to Tony Fauci.

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:15.152
That's why in 2011, at a Who meeting, Robert Malone handed the mic back to Rick Bright.

01:30:16.713 --> 01:30:21.374
Not because he's a dissident, not because he's risking anything by being in D.C.

01:30:21.414 --> 01:30:25.616
yesterday or in Japan the day before, but because it's his job.

01:30:28.737 --> 01:30:42.802
It's his job to make sure that you don't understand that the national security state knew that more people were going to die for about five or eight years and knew that with very little coercion, we could get a peak to show up and then we could lie about it.

01:30:44.662 --> 01:30:53.225
And a mythology about a novel virus would be taught to our children, that they would pass on to their children.

01:30:54.505 --> 01:31:01.349
very conveniently transmitting really shitty information about our biology across generations.

01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:12.556
Exactly what these people have been concerned about for a really long time, about getting together a narrative that could transmit ideas across generations.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:23.323
Curiously enough, it's not about the transmission of the truth of Jesus Christ.

01:31:24.955 --> 01:31:41.570
It is the transmission of the truth about a pandemic that occurred in 2020 that fundamentally reorganized everything about the globe in our now soon to be defunct nation state model of governance.

01:31:42.891 --> 01:31:47.996
Because the collective consciousness is about to meet around the sphere.

01:31:49.107 --> 01:31:58.450
The no-sphere is starting to become one collective consciousness, and social media is facilitating that phenomenon.

01:31:59.091 --> 01:32:07.934
And that complexification is being sort of opposed by this uniformity of thought.

01:32:07.954 --> 01:32:10.215
They want the uniformity that's coming.

01:32:11.575 --> 01:32:13.156
They've created it themselves.

01:32:14.639 --> 01:32:20.221
because they need to fundamentally invert how our children think about themselves and their children.

01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:29.003
They need to transmit this information across the generational gap and they're relying on us to do it.

01:32:31.024 --> 01:32:33.044
And this is the information we need to transmit.

01:32:34.985 --> 01:32:37.545
That they murdered people and they're willing to lie about it.

01:32:38.806 --> 01:32:39.906
That's what we need to transmit.

01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:48.972
And the only way to do it is to start talking about 2020 and keep talking about 2020 to try to get a new consensus about these ideas.

01:32:49.612 --> 01:32:57.395
