00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I

02:53.860 --> 02:59.660
think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying we don't even recognize the truth no more and then since that

03:00.000 --> 03:04.240
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way like this

03:06.440 --> 03:10.760
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it and people

03:12.080 --> 03:15.160
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

03:15.320 --> 03:19.000
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

03:19.000 --> 03:22.360
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
No

03:45.120 --> 03:51.980
Mark mark mark you're so funny as a surgeon you should be speaking out on this

03:52.440 --> 03:57.800
You could save lives if she's but the fuck I didn't know anything about this. How am I meant to know about this?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.480
You know what? I don't know about everything

04:01.280 --> 04:02.520
like

04:02.520 --> 04:09.400
You shouldn't you shouldn't think that just because you're on to something that someone else you'd be doing it to

04:09.640 --> 04:14.200
Buddy we've all got our own jobs to do. I don't tell you what to do

04:16.600 --> 04:22.200
Anyway, I mean the reason why I try to get through to you get your number call you and you're busy last time

04:22.200 --> 04:27.240
And I'm not busy is that look I went back through the podcast and I'm afraid

04:28.640 --> 04:31.040
I think it wasn't good enough mate

04:31.800 --> 04:33.320
and I

04:33.320 --> 04:35.320
Don't know how to explain this to you, but

04:36.000 --> 04:38.840
You know, it was about it was just over an hour, but the thing is

04:39.520 --> 04:42.400
what was relevant was like literally just 15 minutes and

04:43.680 --> 04:48.600
It was just dragged out and there was not enough substance not enough facts not enough details

04:49.400 --> 04:52.000
and I would also say try and

04:52.840 --> 04:54.840
work on your presentation you

04:55.800 --> 05:02.400
Drag things out and speak very slowly and it's just you need to be a bit more punchy a bit more punchy

05:02.680 --> 05:05.600
But more animated bit more lively

05:05.600 --> 05:11.600
I mean, I don't know if you're just a bit flat that day or what I don't know, but you just I think you're

05:12.320 --> 05:14.320
I know your style

05:14.320 --> 05:19.100
You can have you just could inject yourself with a little bit more energy a little bit more animation

05:19.440 --> 05:21.920
so what I was gonna do actually was

05:22.920 --> 05:27.080
Create some clips of the podcast and do a sub stack

05:27.320 --> 05:33.400
And obviously credit you in reference you and talk about the opioid deaths and all that kind of stuff

05:33.520 --> 05:36.200
So that was the plan. I'm sorry mate. I've just

05:36.920 --> 05:40.280
Got a lot of fucking podcasts. I've got a lot of recordings

05:41.000 --> 05:47.600
I'm trying to keep the quality of the content quite high and I'm afraid on this occasion. It just

05:48.440 --> 05:50.440
It just wasn't good enough

05:50.440 --> 05:54.520
I know that sounds harsh, but I'm just being honest with you

05:55.520 --> 06:01.520
It just the quality wasn't up to scratch. All right, mate. Bye

06:04.640 --> 06:11.400
I'm not sure exactly who he is his name is J. J. Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for

06:11.800 --> 06:15.360
CHD and I believe he has a PhD in

06:16.040 --> 06:19.960
some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand

06:20.440 --> 06:22.440
I

06:50.440 --> 06:52.440
I

07:21.440 --> 07:26.120
I guess the weakness is is is is all over the place

07:27.400 --> 07:33.000
It really goes all the way back to where the heck did this guy come from and what did he really stand up for?

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
What was his real message from the very beginning and it doesn't seem to be like there was much of a message

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
He didn't really stand up usefully until

07:41.720 --> 07:48.280
2022 and then he got a steady stream of what I would consider to be you know people that are interesting to talk to

07:49.160 --> 07:54.120
He was connected to Steven for us to I consider to be a very good guy. I like him a lot

07:55.040 --> 07:58.920
But he put my first video behind a paywall he put

07:59.400 --> 08:06.360
Mike Eden's video behind a paywall and although he can say that they're on on other on other

08:07.240 --> 08:11.880
platforms or whatever it the point is is that what does he promote what does he sell?

08:12.040 --> 08:15.440
What does he put behind a paywall and why would he do that?

08:16.320 --> 08:22.640
Is the idea to save people if the idea is to save people then why are you putting anyone's?

08:23.080 --> 08:30.560
Work behind a paywall. Why aren't you just resting on the laurels of your message having enough?

08:31.160 --> 08:33.160
Having enough sort of value

08:33.400 --> 08:40.120
That that people will will start to spread it now. Here's here's where hold on a minute

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
What

08:43.240 --> 08:49.680
We're gonna do another test here. How are we doing? Are we okay? Are we? How's everybody feeling? Okay? How are we in the house tonight?

08:52.640 --> 08:55.800
The thing is is that it would be very easy

08:57.960 --> 09:02.640
For doc Malick it would be very easy for

09:03.520 --> 09:07.920
Robert Malone or Sasha Latipova whoever these other people are

09:08.120 --> 09:14.600
You know a Bitcoin experts on signal it would be very easy for those people to be succinct in

09:15.040 --> 09:20.080
The fact that well Jay's right about the fact that Jessica Hawkins right about the fact that

09:20.320 --> 09:25.840
Denny Rancor is right about the fact that I think there was no real evidence of spread in New York City

09:27.160 --> 09:33.440
Jay's right that it's interesting that infectious clones is almost a ubiquitous methodology and RNA virology

09:33.440 --> 09:39.080
And it's definitely the way that all these these these experiments are standardized now

09:39.080 --> 09:46.320
It becomes really curious to think that Barrick was already talking about the cheapness of making RNA and DNA in

09:47.240 --> 09:54.600
2013 now we have a representative from the human genome project telling us that one of the one of the craziest things is is that

09:54.600 --> 10:03.000
We're just on this this exponential some other mark off whatever curve it is that Kurtzweiler says is his going log rhythmic

10:03.040 --> 10:04.640
soon and

10:04.640 --> 10:07.140
All it means is that they can make some DNA

10:07.800 --> 10:12.080
Does it mean they can make it real pure or just kind of pure? I don't even know I

10:12.960 --> 10:15.500
Don't even know what to think when they say that they make a

10:16.400 --> 10:21.840
DNA molecule if I get that DNA molecule and I and I was able to lay them all out on the table

10:21.840 --> 10:24.640
Would they all be identical if that's that's what they made?

10:24.640 --> 10:30.920
I don't even know if the human genome project has produced technology that has that level of fidelity at this point

10:31.880 --> 10:35.000
But they are not talking about these batches anymore

10:35.000 --> 10:39.620
And what's really interesting is that when such a lot to pull this step in front of Craig

10:39.860 --> 10:44.320
Particopper and started taking over the story of batches and came on my stream for example

10:45.320 --> 10:51.160
It's interesting because the idea of placebo was not actually talked about the idea of

10:51.600 --> 10:55.560
Companies purposefully using placebo. This was more

10:55.800 --> 10:59.880
Misconstrued as maybe manufacturing differences or storage differences

10:59.880 --> 11:04.240
We don't know where these different batches come from we have no data

11:04.840 --> 11:09.360
Actually, which is really funny about the actual batches and their content

11:09.360 --> 11:15.360
We just have this loose correlation between people that were hurt and the batch that they report they had

11:19.360 --> 11:22.320
What a curious little thing that not saying that

11:22.640 --> 11:28.120
Transfection in healthy mammals is dumb and that all academic biologists that have used it on their bench

11:28.400 --> 11:32.720
Should have known better from the very beginning of the pandemic and how impossible it is for

11:33.360 --> 11:37.760
Doc Malick at this point not to know that this would be a sort of central

11:38.400 --> 11:43.960
kneecap to hit on every single person that came on his stream like let's do this

11:45.400 --> 11:50.240
There needs to be a unified understanding of how we were

11:50.800 --> 11:57.960
Bent over so to speak and it's incredible to me that instead of dealing with what we are saying

11:57.960 --> 12:04.560
Which is the protocols are murder and there are things about the protocols that we were allowed to talk about like Remdesivir and

12:05.120 --> 12:13.360
and snake venom and not at all about what Kyle side sidell's little videos revealed and what what Pierre Corey's

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
insistence about

12:15.760 --> 12:24.480
pulse ox and and low pulse ox being a primary symptoms that was spreading everywhere in New York when he arrived two weeks after the peak and

12:27.520 --> 12:30.200
So we have this thing where these people

12:30.560 --> 12:33.280
Wittingly or unwittingly maybe not in the beginning

12:33.280 --> 12:41.240
But eventually we're co-opted into going along with the idea that the big deal to solve was where the hell did this thing come from?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.800
who's responsible for this and

12:44.800 --> 12:50.840
And that's why people make the joke that Ralph Barrick loves me now because people think that I'm somehow protecting Ralph Barrick

12:51.440 --> 12:55.800
There's nobody to protect in this story. They're all part of a

12:56.440 --> 13:01.280
carefully orchestrated national security illusion that includes

13:02.320 --> 13:10.160
academics who have to publish papers that establish the pandemic potential in nature and in in laboratories and

13:10.480 --> 13:19.240
And so he's given talks where he has been spectacularly committed to this lie this potential and how his lab uniquely represents it

13:22.080 --> 13:29.800
And so instead of talking about any of this biology or trying to check any of this biology with any of his

13:29.840 --> 13:33.160
Guests that came after my original podcast with him

13:33.960 --> 13:40.120
Has Doc Malek ever bothered to say hey, what do you think about Jonathan Cooley's idea about transfection?

13:40.160 --> 13:45.000
And that we should have called it that from the beginning and transformation. We should have called it that from the beginning

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
What do you think about?

13:47.000 --> 13:54.520
Jonathan Cooley's idea of infectious clones being a like the the secret white-auto in the open that they don't really they can't do RNA

13:54.880 --> 13:58.880
Viruses, but they can do transfections in a cell culture and call it that

14:01.280 --> 14:09.960
And so it's interesting because in this Bitcoin chat forum that was is curated by a guy that I've already

14:10.200 --> 14:17.200
Declared a medler to his face several times on the on on the phone a few times

14:17.200 --> 14:20.240
Like I've had to say leave me alone at least three times

14:21.000 --> 14:27.400
Which my personal lawyer says is always already harassment, but we we never did anything about it, but it is true

14:28.600 --> 14:31.900
And so we have this situation now where

14:32.480 --> 14:34.360
Curiously enough

14:34.400 --> 14:39.480
Little Malek has been on this Bitcoin chat forum for quite some time now

14:39.480 --> 14:46.680
And of course he's on there all the time making fun of me and making fun of my connections with Mark and and how I'm

14:47.180 --> 14:49.180
I don't know what

14:49.960 --> 14:51.960
All the while he was

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
Trying to finagle a

14:54.800 --> 14:56.800
Nearly what is that?

14:57.160 --> 15:00.080
175 thousand dollars a year with a

15:00.560 --> 15:06.560
$50,000 signing bonus was what that mean it would be that first year would be like a hundred and seventy thousand dollars or so that's a

15:06.920 --> 15:08.920
pretty hefty sum of money

15:09.600 --> 15:13.080
For not really having stood up for any principles in

15:13.600 --> 15:15.080
2020 or

15:15.080 --> 15:19.480
2021 and so effectively not saving anyone in his own country never mind around the world

15:20.440 --> 15:24.160
And yet he presumed to assume the position of chief

15:24.960 --> 15:26.960
surgical officer of the

15:27.440 --> 15:29.440
wellness company Europe

15:31.080 --> 15:37.400
It could have been that he was being played it could have been that he he revealed himself to the people who maybe the wellness

15:37.400 --> 15:41.120
Company is actually not that bad and that's the reason why they never went with him

15:41.120 --> 15:47.240
I don't know anymore the speculation is wild at this stage, but all I know for sure is that

15:47.680 --> 15:49.680
That we are being misled

15:50.320 --> 15:56.800
We are being misled by a coordinated group of liars and the the bottom line is is that Sasha La Topova and

15:57.160 --> 15:59.680
Robert Malone were very recently on on

16:02.080 --> 16:07.440
Doc Malick's podcast and he says that he asked people for questions and he asked me for questions

16:07.440 --> 16:12.000
But the questions that I sent to me only asked two of them and two of them were softballs

16:13.360 --> 16:20.560
So it's curious because the other question that I suggested that he asked him had to do with the anthrax vaccine

16:21.200 --> 16:22.400
anthrax after

16:22.480 --> 16:26.320
2001 and what that all had to do with with where we are now

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And he did not ask him that question

16:31.040 --> 16:36.440
But then claimed that afterward that Jill sent him a really bad text, you know, like screw you man

16:36.440 --> 16:40.320
You totally screwed us and I just I'm sorry, but my

16:41.080 --> 16:43.080
personal conclusion about

16:43.360 --> 16:48.960
Ahmed Mollick is that he lied about that text because again if you wanted to impress somebody with a text

16:48.960 --> 16:56.480
You just send a picture and now sure enough. I'm sure in a few hours. I'll get a picture from from Doc Malick showing me the text from

16:58.240 --> 17:08.080
From from Jill Glasspool Malone, I'm sure I'm sure it'll come in immediately and I still won't believe it because that the whole concept that

17:09.760 --> 17:14.800
Somebody in the UK is spreading the truth and Robert Malone is going on their stream to do it

17:15.760 --> 17:17.760
After me or before me

17:18.400 --> 17:24.720
Who came before me who came after me on his stream? How did they do it? Who did they talk about? What's in the chats?

17:24.720 --> 17:30.960
You know these these kinds of things all really matter when you start to see that they are coordinating their responses in

17:31.360 --> 17:38.000
in sub stack even when mark or I are not even in the in the comments when somebody mentions me then

17:38.960 --> 17:47.280
Little Malick and and the and the Sasha La Topova have have kind of gagged up and said oh yeah JJ's a blah blah blah

17:48.000 --> 17:51.920
And it's very very impressive to think that they think that

17:52.480 --> 17:58.720
Americans never mind the rest of the people around the world who have been following this stream for a long time are going to believe

17:59.280 --> 18:04.400
A guy who showed up on the stream showed up on the scene two years too late

18:04.880 --> 18:08.080
Um and pretends that he stood up for something, but he didn't actually

18:08.720 --> 18:16.480
Um and never really lost his job. I mean, I don't really get what he means. I don't get how how much pain he's in

18:16.640 --> 18:22.000
Um because the guy built a studio in his backyard in order to start this podcast

18:22.000 --> 18:27.280
It's not like he didn't go all in on on on his work until they threw him out

18:28.240 --> 18:31.920
This guy went in all in on the podcast before he threw got thrown out

18:32.000 --> 18:37.040
I mean, it's kind of a joke to me really at this point that anybody takes that guy seriously

18:37.440 --> 18:41.600
But have you see these these private chats that i've been privileged to

18:42.160 --> 18:47.840
That these the way that these people coordinate their behavior and coordinate their little narratives about how

18:48.400 --> 18:55.360
How how lost jonathan kuli is what you need to see is that we are actually at the brick wall

18:55.760 --> 18:57.760
They've run out of actors. These

18:58.400 --> 19:03.280
These charlatans on regular television and regular social media

19:03.680 --> 19:08.560
Have been augmented for several years now by people on social media that include

19:09.120 --> 19:10.800
Robert melon, maryll nass

19:10.800 --> 19:15.920
A lot of the people that medall in the middle in the in the leadership of chd and ican

19:16.400 --> 19:22.640
As well as a lot of these other people on the internet like jessica rose people that were co-opted early like

19:23.040 --> 19:28.400
mcculla and and and pia kori and they're all wittingly or unwittingly

19:29.360 --> 19:31.360
Willingly or unwillingly

19:31.920 --> 19:38.480
Participating in in the maintenance of this illusion that benefits all of these people and all of them

19:39.600 --> 19:45.280
And all i want to do is make gentle the life of this world as we try to

19:46.000 --> 19:51.920
Pull our kids away from this mythology that all of these people with book deals

19:52.320 --> 19:53.600
With all of these

19:53.600 --> 19:58.160
Foreigners that claim that they're trying to save america and the world at the same time

19:58.240 --> 20:03.920
And that's why we've got to listen to them all of these people with dual citizenship in different places

20:04.560 --> 20:07.440
All of them have been meddling with us from the very beginning

20:08.720 --> 20:10.720
It is highly likely

20:11.040 --> 20:16.800
That this wave of lies has been coordinated beyond our wildest imagination since before

20:17.280 --> 20:24.320
We knew who robert malone was or who pia kori was or or who any of these people were back when canuit with causki

20:24.800 --> 20:30.160
And mike yeden were the only two people that we were hearing from or or wolf gang woda

20:31.600 --> 20:37.840
That that that's when this wave was created and it was created with a lot of coordinated lying

20:38.400 --> 20:43.840
Not just on regular tv but on social media and podcast bros with shows

20:44.320 --> 20:49.360
And so if you are here for a while you've been here at the top of the wave and welcome to it

20:50.480 --> 20:55.760
Um, this is a place where we stay focused on the biology. We don't take their bait and we love our neighbor

20:55.760 --> 20:59.840
But these people aren't our neighbors. These people are active medlers

21:00.400 --> 21:04.720
They have been trying to meddle with my family personally for over four years

21:05.280 --> 21:10.720
Never mind the last two years or so when the story really started to come out that that

21:10.720 --> 21:12.720
That

21:12.720 --> 21:17.040
This was just a long line uh one in the long line of of sort of

21:17.760 --> 21:18.960
Mythology

21:18.960 --> 21:26.640
Tomes that has been released in order to make sure that people are too confused to to step out of this mythology

21:27.280 --> 21:32.240
And if you think this is worthwhile, please share the stream with everybody and anybody that you know

21:40.720 --> 21:42.720
I

22:00.560 --> 22:05.200
Yeah, i've been hoping for a paradigm shift for a while now and I do actually think we're getting there

22:05.200 --> 22:10.320
And it's a lot of it has to do with the independent work of a guy by the name of mark kulak

22:10.960 --> 22:13.200
At husatonic it s

22:13.200 --> 22:21.360
Husatonic live on youtube live two and live three has helped me also to pull my own hands down

22:22.880 --> 22:26.480
And uh, I think it's going to require learning

22:26.960 --> 22:33.680
Biology and learning the history of these biological ideas in order to engage in the non-compliance that we want to engage in

22:34.160 --> 22:37.600
In order to be able to pull our children out of this mythology

22:37.600 --> 22:40.720
We need to really understand the way it was laid down

23:08.560 --> 23:12.000
Well for better or worse, we're back here. I hope that there is some

23:12.480 --> 23:17.680
Degree of relationship between the movement of my lips and the appearance of the sound in your ears

23:18.320 --> 23:20.320
Um, it is the 16th of may

23:21.280 --> 23:22.240
uh

23:22.240 --> 23:23.760
2024

23:23.760 --> 23:30.880
And uh, I needed to update my Nvidia card. I had to update my atam. I had to update the windows drivers

23:30.880 --> 23:36.080
It was all kinds of stuff. So i'm very happy. Thanks for saying that it's in sync and if you're lying to me

23:36.160 --> 23:37.680
I love you even more

23:37.680 --> 23:41.680
Um, ladies and gentlemen, this is giga ohm biological. I'm a human just like you

23:41.680 --> 23:45.280
Which means that I don't have a tech crew or anything like that. I could ask my sons

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
But actually i'm their tech crew

23:47.760 --> 23:55.520
Um, so, you know, we had trouble today, but we're back on and the message hasn't really changed the the amount that people try to ignore it

23:55.520 --> 23:57.840
Has has ramped up quite significantly

23:58.640 --> 24:01.200
And instead of talking about these three basic points

24:01.520 --> 24:08.080
They want to attribute bad motives or or some kind of military intelligence role for me because i'm self emulating

24:08.640 --> 24:13.120
emulating by by exposing some of these people now if these people are

24:14.080 --> 24:15.440
Are innocent

24:15.440 --> 24:18.960
Um, then it should be very easy for people to say, you know, jay's wrong

24:18.960 --> 24:23.280
And I totally agree with him when he says that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

24:23.680 --> 24:26.160
With the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

24:26.640 --> 24:31.760
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and rna cannot pandemic now

24:32.240 --> 24:39.440
There are lots of people who could take those three words at the bottom there rna cannot pandemic and run like hell with them

24:39.440 --> 24:40.720
But they're not

24:40.720 --> 24:43.920
Instead they're working very hard to attribute bad motives to me

24:44.320 --> 24:49.680
And bad motives to mark and this is just par for the course because the spread of bad ideas is much scarier

24:50.000 --> 24:55.360
And more dangerous than the spread of any rna molecule and I would argue that a lot of these people again

24:56.160 --> 25:02.240
Wittingly or unwittingly willingly or unwillingly have been participating in a national security

25:04.240 --> 25:13.280
Operation which was designed to make sure that we would adopt the understanding that pandemics happen it did happen it could happen again

25:14.240 --> 25:17.520
Um, this this is a problem for us, of course

25:18.080 --> 25:23.040
It has been described by this guy many times and i'm going to keep going because again

25:23.120 --> 25:24.640
This is a jazz show

25:24.640 --> 25:27.440
And so we've got to repeat this work over and over again

25:27.440 --> 25:34.560
But the argument that this guy makes the the presentation that this guy gives that you can look up on youtube under the name james giro donno

25:34.800 --> 25:37.920
It is a presentation that is very succinct, but it's also the

25:38.480 --> 25:40.480
brochure version of it there of course

25:41.120 --> 25:47.040
Lots and lots of layers to a plan like this and this guy goes around giving relatively public talks

25:47.440 --> 25:49.920
And certainly talks that can be posted on youtube

25:50.240 --> 25:53.440
And those talks again are the forward facing

25:54.320 --> 25:57.520
brochure version of what would be a real pandemic

25:57.840 --> 26:01.840
Operation which we've just experienced and are indeed still experiencing

26:02.320 --> 26:04.320
Um up right up until today

26:05.360 --> 26:08.880
My argument is is that the people can be identified

26:09.280 --> 26:12.720
Who say that the covid shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020

26:13.120 --> 26:18.880
If they're not willing to go back and revisit how the illusion of a pandemic was created

26:19.360 --> 26:26.560
Through a wicked combination of fraud and and and probably malfeasance and also murder

26:27.600 --> 26:32.480
We have a situation where a couple maybe mass casualty events, maybe

26:33.760 --> 26:34.720
mass

26:34.720 --> 26:40.240
Bookfaking events were used by social media in order to misconstrue

26:40.880 --> 26:44.160
What was probably a maybe a bad flu year

26:44.960 --> 26:49.200
Misconstrued it into the start of a worldwide pandemic

26:50.000 --> 26:53.680
That would impact all of the world's economies for several years

26:54.000 --> 26:58.560
And I really I really think it's important to consider the possibility

26:58.960 --> 27:03.760
That not just the people on television like tony fauci would be controlled

27:04.240 --> 27:12.160
but actually people like a senator who is participating in such an exercise would be controlled or at least in the sense of

27:12.960 --> 27:15.600
Unwittingly participating in the theater

27:16.240 --> 27:24.000
Which amplifies the threat of both a natural virus and a laboratory leak and the people on that side of the screen over there

27:24.560 --> 27:30.640
I believe especially the ones the farthest over here. I can see my arrow these guys over here all in this bunch

27:31.120 --> 27:32.480
um

27:32.480 --> 27:34.480
They are responsible for

27:35.440 --> 27:35.840
uh

27:35.840 --> 27:41.280
Sort of sculpting this limited spectrum of debate and there may be a mastermind in there or two

27:42.160 --> 27:44.400
My guess is if we go back to this picture

27:45.360 --> 27:52.000
Kevin McCurnan in terms of molecular biology knows more than everybody on that screen except for maybe

27:52.560 --> 27:54.240
Robert Malone who

27:54.240 --> 27:58.800
In my limited, you know, I've only watched him for let's say 25 hours or so

27:59.120 --> 28:02.960
He's never given me the impression that the guy knows a lot of details

28:03.520 --> 28:09.280
Um, he he's a capable memorizing and reading a lot of things that make it seem like he knows details

28:09.760 --> 28:11.920
Um, but it would be interesting to hear him talk

28:11.920 --> 28:16.720
Usefully about molecular biology in a basic sense because I haven't even heard him do that

28:17.280 --> 28:18.080
um

28:18.080 --> 28:25.680
So but other than that there's really nobody over there that's sophisticated enough even Jessica Rose who who had an almost aha

28:26.320 --> 28:32.320
uh, eureka moment when I was presenting in uh 2022 or 2023

28:32.880 --> 28:39.920
On on st. patrick's day with her and john bodewin and kevin mccurnan and stephanie sineff from mit

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
um this little five person

28:42.400 --> 28:49.760
Uh mini seminar was actually really interesting because there there were a couple of mealy mouth challenges to the idea

28:50.240 --> 28:53.680
Of infectious clones as being the basis for rna virology

28:54.400 --> 29:00.720
And those those objections were actually kind of amateur and it really showed that I don't know if he didn't prepare or

29:01.200 --> 29:04.400
The person that prepared him didn't prepare but but I had already

29:04.400 --> 29:07.920
I mean I was already aware of of this gene and I had already researched

29:08.000 --> 29:14.480
It was part of the reason why I was pretty confident that the that the fidelity of rna replication had not equal dna

29:14.560 --> 29:18.800
And there's still at least one or two orders of magnitude difference and so then there's still

29:19.200 --> 29:25.840
This whole concept of what are we talking about here his different depending on how you how you want to discuss fidelity

29:26.240 --> 29:28.720
And he tried a couple times to push back

29:28.800 --> 29:35.200
Just like bret weinstein has tried over several years to take little bits and pieces and pretend like he's listening

29:35.680 --> 29:39.760
like in 2021 or 2022 mentioning my name or

29:40.160 --> 29:43.040
Heather saying that oh transfection is what we should call it

29:43.440 --> 29:48.160
But then did they change that did they start calling it transfection? No, but tonight

29:49.360 --> 29:52.480
Today we're going to see a video where actually bret says

29:52.960 --> 29:58.720
transfection agent twice and it's on a tucker carlson interview, which is very interesting, right?

29:58.960 --> 30:03.120
What an interesting place to decide to be precise for the first time

30:03.360 --> 30:08.320
And then when you're talking about it to be precise in a particular way about a particular issue

30:08.720 --> 30:10.720
Which unfortunately for me

30:10.880 --> 30:14.000
Um is one of the reasons why i left panda because this

30:14.640 --> 30:19.920
This person was in panda and just drove me bananas with this theory

30:20.400 --> 30:23.840
All the time is if it explained everything and that we didn't have to learn

30:24.320 --> 30:29.280
Anymore biology because a few back of the napkin calculations about how many molecules are where

30:29.760 --> 30:34.640
Can explain the damage that's done with intramuscular injection? It just made me sick

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
And lo and behold two or three days ago

30:38.720 --> 30:45.280
This john kambal guy puts this guy on his stream and they talk about this stuff and so it's really spectacular because

30:45.840 --> 30:47.120
um

30:47.200 --> 30:52.800
I do really feel like i'm one of the people that's seen the alien earliest and i'm not talking about there's no virus

30:52.880 --> 30:58.400
That's not the alien the alien is this this amorphous mass of liars

30:59.200 --> 31:00.560
deceivers

31:00.560 --> 31:03.760
Wittingly and unwittingly performing as part of this

31:04.320 --> 31:08.160
This national security operation and I just can't believe

31:08.880 --> 31:10.880
How obvious it is to me now and how?

31:11.520 --> 31:15.360
How frustrated I can feel at sometimes that I didn't see it earlier

31:15.440 --> 31:17.680
I didn't take the advice of some people to see

31:18.560 --> 31:20.960
Some of these people from the angle that I do now

31:21.520 --> 31:22.880
um

31:22.880 --> 31:24.160
But they've all

31:24.160 --> 31:30.000
They've all been a part of this conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits mostly distraction and running out the clock

31:30.080 --> 31:31.120
but

31:31.120 --> 31:38.640
Also, just really making sure that nobody asks the right questions and they didn't just do it with Pulitzer prize winning cartoons

31:39.280 --> 31:44.240
They also did it with with people on the internet that that had little bros with shows

31:44.320 --> 31:47.360
That had big bros with shows that had big shows with bros

31:48.240 --> 31:50.640
And their whole idea was to prevent this

31:51.200 --> 31:57.680
This ability for us to say no, which is a very integral part of the principle of informed consent

31:57.760 --> 31:59.920
And I would argue that people like robert malone

32:00.640 --> 32:02.640
You don't even need to know

32:03.600 --> 32:06.480
His his background to know that his story

32:07.040 --> 32:10.400
And if you line them up month after month and year after year

32:10.720 --> 32:14.400
You can clearly see that this guy didn't just come out scream in the truth

32:15.280 --> 32:19.680
This is somebody who came out and very very titratively revealed what he knew

32:20.240 --> 32:27.200
Um even took back or corrected some of the things that he said and before he officially came out and ruined Brett Weinstein's life

32:27.280 --> 32:29.280
By getting him canceled on youtube

32:29.280 --> 32:31.600
Um his wife and he were actually seemingly

32:32.160 --> 32:36.400
Positioning themselves to get some kind of intellectual credit for having come up with the idea of

32:36.800 --> 32:40.640
Injecting people would live in nanoparticles in r&a might be a way to transfect them

32:41.600 --> 32:42.560
Um

32:42.560 --> 32:46.640
And you could call it vaccines and then you could get away with never having to test anything again

32:47.040 --> 32:49.280
Which is of course the interesting thing right

32:50.000 --> 32:52.320
Even back then when he was working on this stuff

32:52.560 --> 32:57.440
It was already obvious to them that the the childhood vaccine schedule was the place to be

32:58.160 --> 33:00.160
Are you kidding me? You don't think he knows that

33:00.800 --> 33:04.400
He didn't know that back then that all of his bosses didn't know that back then

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
So this whole idea

33:07.120 --> 33:14.000
That is that these people were seeding this scooby-doo narrative of a back cave virus or a gain of function lab leak

33:14.400 --> 33:18.000
And their idea behind seeding it was to slow roll us

33:18.560 --> 33:23.920
Into accepting the fact that there was a virus it did spread and that's why these people are also very insistent

33:24.320 --> 33:26.720
About their experience with this virus where we're on

33:27.120 --> 33:31.120
Robert Malone will insist that he was at a super spreader event and that's what makes him

33:31.600 --> 33:33.840
a card-carrying infected person

33:34.400 --> 33:38.720
Um, he will say that he got transfected because he had to travel, but then you'll hear

33:39.200 --> 33:44.400
Uh, steven hat Phil say on tommy's podcast that now you didn't have a card when we went to roa and it was pretty funny

33:44.720 --> 33:49.680
And then you have maryll das saying that she's been infected three times with covid

33:49.680 --> 33:52.480
Although she never tested for it. It was definitely those symptoms

33:52.880 --> 33:58.640
And of course she treated herself with ivermectin or some other magic thing that only works on this stuff and cancer

33:59.040 --> 34:04.240
And the other thing that find strange is that so many of these people have the same damn story

34:04.240 --> 34:06.880
They had to because they were early

34:08.880 --> 34:16.400
And they needed early legitimacy every one of them even kevin mccairn that guy way out in the boondocks of the internet

34:16.960 --> 34:18.960
Um streaming from japan

34:19.920 --> 34:25.920
That guy also had one of the earliest cases of covid and he says he got it at a super spreader rent in korea

34:26.480 --> 34:28.000
The

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
The guy who said in march of

34:30.400 --> 34:35.920
2020 that a billion people could die and that it was better to stay home and and and make masks

34:36.960 --> 34:42.640
That was streaming with paul cotrell and inviting me to stream with paul cotrell and fight against paul cotrell's sale of

34:43.120 --> 34:45.120
silver and stuff

34:46.640 --> 34:49.600
Drastic was the same kind of operation where you have people

34:50.160 --> 34:55.760
Laying down this narrative that you have a mystery to solve that you've already solved it that you're on the verge of solving

34:55.920 --> 35:01.680
And they're covering it up. So you got to work harder to make sure that the origin story is revealed

35:05.120 --> 35:07.120
To rule out

35:07.120 --> 35:08.240
that uh

35:08.240 --> 35:11.200
Somebody didn't let this puppy loose intentionally

35:12.080 --> 35:15.840
And who would have let who would want to let loose an agent

35:16.560 --> 35:20.480
In the the literally beating industrial heart of china

35:21.680 --> 35:24.720
Um, I doubt it was the people's republic china

35:25.520 --> 35:29.280
So, uh, I can't resolve, you know these different

35:31.280 --> 35:33.600
Potential ways that this agent could have gotten loose

35:34.000 --> 35:40.320
But but the fury and cleavage site and some of the other signs whether or not there is an hiv sequence in there

35:40.960 --> 35:41.840
um

35:41.840 --> 35:48.560
It it it kind of it looks an awful lot like something that came out of laboratory research and

35:50.080 --> 35:54.160
But in a sense it kind of doesn't matter because here we are

35:54.720 --> 35:56.720
You know, it's gone worldwide

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
now one of the things about this

35:58.880 --> 36:00.480
all this

36:00.480 --> 36:02.480
issue about what happened and we're on

36:03.360 --> 36:05.680
Is that I had this uh colleague that I

36:07.040 --> 36:12.640
What i'm reminded of when he says, you know, it's we're stuck with it now. It's gone worldwide. What's what's interesting to me

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
Is that um

36:15.840 --> 36:22.000
When we watched that that video with with judy mikovitz on the news in navada and she was talking about

36:22.560 --> 36:26.240
chronic fatigue syndrome and she was talking about her virus whichever one it was

36:27.440 --> 36:32.320
They were talking about a virus being a latent virus that was activated by vaccines

36:32.320 --> 36:35.680
And so it's always there in the background and that was what was scary about it

36:36.640 --> 36:41.040
That's what the they were defining the problem as a virus in the background

36:41.040 --> 36:42.960
That you couldn't do anything about it was already there

36:42.960 --> 36:45.200
It just had to test people to find out if they had it

36:46.000 --> 36:51.280
And that you might be able to vaccinate against that virus in order to make vaccines work better

36:52.880 --> 36:57.600
Think about this very carefully please think about it very carefully what he just said

36:59.440 --> 37:03.040
I don't know. Maybe I should even take it back a little bit just so you hear it

37:04.400 --> 37:07.760
Yourself here. We are, you know, it's gone worldwide

37:08.560 --> 37:11.040
Now one of the things about this all this

37:11.760 --> 37:14.400
So it's gone worldwide. So in a way

37:15.360 --> 37:17.360
They

37:17.360 --> 37:21.920
They got to the point where it's just in the background as quickly as they could and in fact

37:22.640 --> 37:29.920
The lab leak hypothesis and it's spreading faster than any virus ever in the world as charles rixie said and

37:30.400 --> 37:35.520
Fleming said and mccaren said it was designed it had had these fear and cleavage sites

37:35.600 --> 37:41.280
They never put in the vaccine and this one had it and now it flew around plus hiv and all this other stuff

37:41.280 --> 37:43.280
He said fear and cleavage site. He said hiv

37:43.680 --> 37:48.960
Sometimes they say staphylococcan and teratoxin B homologies or or other mimicry

37:52.720 --> 37:57.040
But the point should be very very very clear and I hope it is these people

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
laid down a narrative

38:00.480 --> 38:04.960
That would allow them to cover up the known and expected damage

38:06.160 --> 38:08.480
That would be caused by transformation and

38:08.480 --> 38:14.400
Transfection and to confound it with the release of a gain of function virus that spread so fast

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
We're just kind of stuck with it now

38:18.480 --> 38:23.520
Whereas remember in the brat wine steam podcast, which was just one month before this

38:24.400 --> 38:29.040
And brat was still going for zero covid and claiming that if we gave everybody ivermectin for a month

38:29.040 --> 38:32.160
We could get to zero covid and robermolo is kind of

38:32.640 --> 38:36.960
Maybe it's pop maybe I don't know if I agree with you, but it's not a terrible idea

38:38.560 --> 38:40.800
And now already a month later we're stuck with it

38:41.200 --> 38:46.720
Just like the the journalist garret on that's that cnn show that we watched said that you know

38:46.720 --> 38:52.000
The worst case scenario with these epidemics is if we're to go and epidemic is we're referring to go endemic

38:52.400 --> 38:56.480
Meaning we'd be stuck with it forever. We have another virus that we have to cope with

38:58.800 --> 39:05.680
In reality, that is the main message. That's what the scooby-doo mystery that we have been led to solve

39:06.160 --> 39:11.680
Gets you to accept whether you're on the left or the right whether you thought it early or whether you thought it late

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
Whether you're afraid of the shot or not

39:14.080 --> 39:21.040
The bottom line is is that every everybody on social media and everybody in the news is now coming to the realization that they must have kind of

39:21.280 --> 39:22.480
Well, I don't know

39:22.480 --> 39:27.840
Maybe they covered it up. I mean it could be and then you have this ed yarm guy who's insisting that no no

39:28.400 --> 39:34.400
The viruses from nature are bad enough because there's too many of us and we're encroaching on nature and it's happening all the time

39:34.720 --> 39:38.640
And there are millions of viruses in every mammal and yada yada yada

39:40.160 --> 39:43.520
And so you see where we are right you see how how

39:45.200 --> 39:50.720
Potentially dangerous it is if these people were let loose on us in order to

39:52.320 --> 39:59.280
Masquerade as heroes and and sculpt a limited spectrum of debate and what would really be scary

40:00.240 --> 40:08.240
Is if some of these people were already operating before the pandemic even started what would really be scary if Brett Weinstein's whole stunt at

40:08.800 --> 40:14.240
Evergreen state was just orchestrated in order to propel him onto the internet to give him some

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
seemingly spontaneous

40:17.040 --> 40:19.040
Incredibility as a podcaster

40:20.000 --> 40:23.840
All the while with his brother and joe rogan and all these people plotting to

40:24.400 --> 40:26.960
Set up a bros with joe's network that would have

40:27.440 --> 40:34.640
Sponsorships and and be able to be elevated by who by the people that own the social media on which these people are going to circulate

40:36.640 --> 40:45.040
And so who cares if there's censorship on youtube but they can get their message out and and and it can be amplified on places like twitter

40:45.840 --> 40:46.560
or

40:46.560 --> 40:48.320
Facebook or

40:48.320 --> 40:52.400
gab or getter or telegram or any of these other places

40:54.640 --> 41:00.480
And then when you take something like sub stack and you inject the possibility that money laundering could be going through there

41:00.480 --> 41:05.280
And nobody can monitor where the money's coming from or who's getting it or who's subscribing for real or not

41:06.080 --> 41:14.400
You can see all the openings for the reasons why Jessica rose rose on sub stack even though she writes sometimes only once a week

41:15.040 --> 41:22.720
Where robert malone writes on sub stack his own stuff maybe 17 to 25 pages a day plus posting other people's stuff

41:23.680 --> 41:29.280
And so all of these people are being elevated as part of this orchestrated controlled narrative

41:30.240 --> 41:34.080
That is designed to be a slow-motion controlled demolition of america

41:34.080 --> 41:38.480
We're supposed to eventually come to the conclusion what he just said right there

41:38.480 --> 41:40.800
What did he say he said that we did it

41:41.360 --> 41:45.680
We thought in this video he says that we thought that that the

41:46.640 --> 41:52.240
Chinese had spent a billion dollars a year on a containment infrastructure for our future SARS

41:52.560 --> 41:59.360
And so we were pretty confident that we could release a SARS virus on them in their in their metropolitan areas

41:59.440 --> 42:03.840
And it would it would never get to us because they're prepared for it. It would just screw them

42:05.760 --> 42:09.200
That's what robert malone just said in 2021

42:10.640 --> 42:16.240
And that's very disturbing if he's positioning himself to be part of an administration or positioning self

42:16.640 --> 42:22.240
Himself to advise a cabinet member or whatever it might be in a future administration. It's terrifying

42:25.280 --> 42:31.440
Because there is no question that the three things that we say at the beginning of this stream that we have on that green and yellow slide

42:31.840 --> 42:36.160
Are absolutely as close to the truth as any anti-vaxxer has ever gotten

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
It's i'm sorry to toot my own horn

42:39.280 --> 42:44.960
But all these people who have been working for so long have never been able to succinctly say what's going on here

42:45.440 --> 42:51.520
And that's one of the objections I have to somebody like maryll ness who well, maybe it wasn't a lab leak

42:51.600 --> 42:54.240
You know, maybe it was deliberate. That's one thing you have to consider

42:54.240 --> 42:56.800
But the other thing is you just look at the genome

42:57.440 --> 42:59.120
There are so many

42:59.120 --> 43:05.040
Things different things that have been changed. There's at least a dozen things in that genome that are very odd

43:05.840 --> 43:07.840
and that cause

43:08.400 --> 43:10.400
Specific

43:10.400 --> 43:12.160
medical problems

43:12.160 --> 43:14.000
So there are

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Things in that genome that are

43:16.320 --> 43:17.760
there to

43:17.760 --> 43:19.760
Impact your immune system

43:19.920 --> 43:22.880
You know and make it harder for you to fight off the infection

43:23.600 --> 43:24.560
There

43:24.560 --> 43:29.840
People knew when they created the vaccine for instance, the spike was very toxic

43:30.400 --> 43:35.920
Why would you take the most toxic part of this virus and make a vaccine out of that part you

43:36.720 --> 43:38.320
You'd need to

43:38.320 --> 43:38.960
to

43:38.960 --> 43:42.640
Decrease the toxicity before you made the vaccine, but they didn't

43:44.320 --> 43:49.920
There were when fauci had his phone call on february 1 with about a dozen virologists

43:50.800 --> 43:55.520
Um, it was mentioned that there were six different weird things in the genome

43:55.520 --> 43:58.720
So on february 1 february 1 2020

44:00.400 --> 44:02.800
These spooky virologists

44:03.040 --> 44:04.480
Um

44:04.480 --> 44:09.360
Who had who have worked on biological warfare issues before as well as other things

44:09.760 --> 44:13.600
Um, we're aware of six things in the genome that had probably been

44:14.160 --> 44:18.320
Uh added in a laboratory and we've discovered more since then

44:18.960 --> 44:24.960
So if you actually and i'm not a geneticist, i'm not a virologist, but I you know, I can read

44:26.880 --> 44:31.440
If you acknowledge that to be true and it's been very well documented

44:32.000 --> 44:34.960
There's no question, but that this was designed in the lab

44:35.520 --> 44:42.720
And I'd posit that there's a good chance that different parts of it were designed in different labs and then those parts were put together

44:43.600 --> 44:45.600
and um

44:45.600 --> 44:49.120
Since ralph barrack and shijangli were sharing

44:49.600 --> 44:54.480
Um, they're the mouse the humanized mouse model. They were sharing other things

44:54.960 --> 45:00.480
Um, it's certainly possible that bits from both left and there are other labs around the world

45:00.480 --> 45:04.160
I mean, there are coronavirus labs in australia in

45:05.200 --> 45:05.680
uh

45:05.680 --> 45:12.640
Singapore and Taiwan, you know and in europe. I mean they're all over so other ones in the united states as well

45:13.680 --> 45:18.320
So there are many possibilities from where it could have come from and

45:19.040 --> 45:23.600
In my mind so so we know it's it's been created in a lab

45:24.480 --> 45:29.920
Did it leak or was it deliberately spread and people say at first well it had to have been

45:30.800 --> 45:33.200
the wuhan lab because that's where it showed up

45:34.160 --> 45:41.280
But me having a background in biological warfare and tell you that you always are going to pick an organism

45:41.600 --> 45:43.440
So that it appears to be natural

45:43.920 --> 45:49.280
So you're gonna if you want to spread it you spread it in a place where the would where the lab leak would appear

45:49.920 --> 45:51.760
right, um, and you

45:52.960 --> 45:56.240
If you are able you use a strain that looks like a natural strain

45:56.800 --> 46:01.920
But the people who made this we're looking for a highly highly virulent organism

46:02.480 --> 46:04.160
She's a good mind reader

46:04.160 --> 46:09.760
So they couldn't make it look natural. They must have known that once scientists really got a hold of it

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
Um, they'd figure out

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
you know

46:14.640 --> 46:15.520
So

46:15.520 --> 46:20.720
The scooby-doo is being played on us and the objection that I have with with maryll nast is that

46:21.200 --> 46:26.640
With her decades-long experience with bioweapons, it seems like she could be a little bit more clear

46:27.200 --> 46:31.840
about the impetus for faking exaggeration, etc

46:31.840 --> 46:37.120
And instead she is very convinced of the fidelity and ability of

46:37.840 --> 46:40.320
virologists to generate something that can again

46:41.280 --> 46:43.280
By itself go around the world

46:43.760 --> 46:49.200
And I just cannot believe that after four years of this stuff that we still have people

46:49.600 --> 46:54.160
That are basically saying what I would have said in 2020 is if it's something profound

46:54.560 --> 46:57.680
And they are being amplified by fake media

46:58.480 --> 47:00.640
This person is definitely fake media

47:00.640 --> 47:05.280
I think that they're most fake media are just people that really want to be on screen

47:05.760 --> 47:07.600
Really just want to be famous

47:07.600 --> 47:11.440
And so they'll they'll if you're gonna give them a news show and tell them who to interview

47:11.840 --> 47:16.800
And tell them what not to say to a certain extent that there's a lot of people who will do exactly that

47:17.440 --> 47:19.920
Um, and they don't have to know that they're being played

47:20.320 --> 47:25.280
She can believe that maryll nast is totally good. In fact maryll nast can even believe what she's saying

47:26.000 --> 47:31.120
But I don't think that the amount of times that she's been in front of a microphone and the number of times

47:31.520 --> 47:36.640
That she's been asked to her opinion in front of the senate or in a podcast

47:37.680 --> 47:40.880
Or in an interview or or on a panel

47:41.360 --> 47:44.240
That she's ever been able to succinctly say that you know what?

47:44.240 --> 47:49.600
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting to the immune system is kind of dumb

47:50.000 --> 47:52.720
And that's why I spoke out against the anthrax vaccine

47:53.440 --> 48:00.800
That's why I work for chd because I think that a lot of these untested products are actually not working the way that they say they are

48:02.000 --> 48:09.120
But her message is always extremely titrated. Yes, we can find instances. We can find vlog posts

48:09.760 --> 48:12.800
But what i'm talking about is is that every single day

48:13.520 --> 48:20.480
That she gets somewhere she should be giving a a overarching message of public health is working against you

48:20.480 --> 48:22.480
But she's never done that

48:24.240 --> 48:26.800
It's always a very carefully titrated

48:27.360 --> 48:30.320
pseudo attack a pseudo pseudo reveal

48:31.280 --> 48:34.080
Because in reality she could have said that here too

48:34.720 --> 48:41.680
That this is just part of the same system that I've been fighting for five or ten years with chd and robert f Kennedy jr

48:42.000 --> 48:46.720
This is the same system that we got our horribly criminal vaccine schedule from

48:48.240 --> 48:52.480
But my guess is if you watch that whole interview there they won't even come close

48:53.360 --> 48:58.080
To to saying that and then you might say well, she can't say that or she'll get off the air

48:58.160 --> 49:00.720
She won't be able to be on rumble anymore. Well

49:02.960 --> 49:04.800
At what point in time is she gonna say it?

49:05.440 --> 49:11.120
Somebody like maryll nass who has supposedly been a bioweapons expert for like 20 years now somehow

49:12.640 --> 49:14.640
With no pub med record

49:17.760 --> 49:19.520
Or a small one, I guess I don't know

49:21.600 --> 49:26.320
I'm just confused ladies and gentlemen i'm confused because I don't know how it is possible

49:27.120 --> 49:33.680
That everybody is ignoring the fact that a lab leak of an rna is not

49:35.200 --> 49:38.000
Resulting in a pandemic is just simply not possible

49:38.400 --> 49:42.880
And it doesn't matter what hiv inserts or any other things that you change especially

49:43.920 --> 49:47.360
Especially think about this very carefully what she said in this video

49:47.760 --> 49:52.160
Especially if the dozen or so things that are changed in the viral genome

49:52.880 --> 49:56.480
Are changing and causing specific disease symptoms

49:56.880 --> 50:00.640
How do those changes help the virus to go from

50:01.200 --> 50:07.120
You know making a small outbreak after a guy comes back from a bat cave and and goes on a train

50:08.160 --> 50:09.680
to a

50:09.680 --> 50:15.440
Global pandemic that is still trackable now because it's on a background where it wasn't before

50:17.120 --> 50:22.480
All of those presuppositions of the national security narrative that there was a virus

50:22.560 --> 50:24.640
Wasn't a virus and then there was a virus

50:25.120 --> 50:30.240
That there wasn't a virus and then there was a new virus that there's a new virus and now we're stuck with it

50:30.480 --> 50:34.720
That it's most likely that they made it and that may explain why we're stuck with it

50:35.440 --> 50:37.440
Oh

50:37.440 --> 50:42.480
My they made it so maybe that's the reason also why when we chose the spike protein the most toxic

50:42.960 --> 50:46.480
Protein in the genome that we we are screwing everybody up

50:47.200 --> 50:54.400
And this ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to understand as a narrative about a spike protein that i've been trying to break since really 2021

50:55.440 --> 50:58.400
Somewhere in in between the in the first

50:59.040 --> 51:04.240
Quarter of 2021 is when I really started to be able to see that they were going to try and

51:05.040 --> 51:10.240
Do a bait and switch and had all these people talking about the spike protein for a year already

51:10.560 --> 51:12.560
Because their idea was they're going to blame

51:13.120 --> 51:14.620
the injuries from

51:14.620 --> 51:19.280
Transfection on the spike protein and now we have companies selling

51:19.760 --> 51:25.120
Products that that save you from the spike protein. They don't save you from the dangers of

51:25.520 --> 51:29.760
Transfection or from the potential for auto immunity from transfection. They

51:30.480 --> 51:32.480
Save you from the spike protein

51:35.120 --> 51:37.120
Let's listen to this dude

51:37.840 --> 51:39.840
Wait, what?

51:40.160 --> 51:41.200
Oh, yeah, sorry

51:41.200 --> 51:42.640
So we have this illusion, right?

51:42.640 --> 51:48.800
This is the illusion that they have been that's why ralph barrack is so important ralph barrack's work his actual publications

51:49.200 --> 51:55.040
And his and his postdocs and they'm believing it all is part of this illusion that what they're doing

51:56.000 --> 52:00.240
Is playing with pandemic potential? Are they playing with rnas? I think so

52:01.200 --> 52:07.200
Are they putting rnas on cell culture and then something is happening that maybe some membrane bound vesicles

52:07.200 --> 52:10.960
Something that might be able to be called an exosome or something like that is being produced

52:11.280 --> 52:15.280
And then that can provoke an immune response. It can provoke a

52:16.080 --> 52:21.440
An antibody neutralizing effect. It can it can be pulled down in a in a western blot

52:21.520 --> 52:28.240
It can be identified with a ELISA test that doesn't necessarily mean that now virology exists

52:28.320 --> 52:33.840
It just means that they can make dna they can make rna they can sequence for it. They can amplify parts of it

52:34.640 --> 52:40.160
And yet these little tricks these little these little baits and switches these little

52:40.640 --> 52:46.880
Shell games have been played and all those shell games always lead to so we made a synthetic version of the sequence

52:46.880 --> 52:51.600
We made dna of it. We made a lot of it. We put it on a cell culture and that's where we're going to start

52:53.920 --> 52:57.840
And at the very very best then they might take that thing and put it in some animals

52:58.320 --> 53:02.560
And then that's going to be their their model. So does flu exist

53:02.640 --> 53:05.040
I am sure that there are respiratory diseases

53:05.040 --> 53:10.720
And I'm sure that there are lots of people who believe that there is some kind of contagion that flies around

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
And it may very well be that there are

53:14.160 --> 53:18.320
But most likely then it would become a signal from other people

53:19.760 --> 53:24.320
A immune signal that is produced by other people's immune system

53:25.280 --> 53:29.120
Um a a signal produced by those people

53:30.080 --> 53:35.200
Um, I don't I don't purport to understand it. I don't even purport to say that flu isn't real

53:35.200 --> 53:41.280
You see the problem here flu virology is actually some of the more

53:42.320 --> 53:44.320
Let's say

53:45.440 --> 53:51.040
I mean they have some pretty pictures. They are able to grow stuff in those eggs and that's part of the problem

53:51.120 --> 53:53.360
Right, that's part of the reason why

53:53.360 --> 53:57.760
Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan are a little bit off. They're just it's an easy way

53:58.560 --> 54:00.560
out to nowhere

54:00.960 --> 54:08.240
We actually need to revisit all of these observations revisit all of these models so that we really do start to

54:09.600 --> 54:11.360
to

54:11.360 --> 54:18.240
Sort of take control again of our understanding of reality our model of reality because right now our model of reality

54:18.320 --> 54:21.600
Includes a worst case scenario that is a gain of function by a weapon

54:22.000 --> 54:26.160
And that model of reality is being forced on our children by

54:26.560 --> 54:29.360
Meryl nass and roberm alone and piacory

54:29.680 --> 54:36.800
And all of these people who refuse to look back at 2020 and 2021 and question what exactly happened

54:37.200 --> 54:38.640
And whether or not

54:38.640 --> 54:44.320
Denny rancor or jessica hockett or nick hudson or myself or mark kulek have anything

54:45.280 --> 54:50.560
To say worth listening to no they're never going to do that because they even amplify themselves

54:50.960 --> 54:54.160
Hand each other on twitter very obviously all the time

54:55.840 --> 55:01.520
Jessica rose almost as I don't think she's ever promoted me she might have promoted that that

55:03.200 --> 55:05.200
She might have promoted that that

55:07.600 --> 55:09.760
St patrick's day thing because she was in it

55:10.720 --> 55:15.040
Um, she may have promoted a interview that she was in when I gave her

55:15.040 --> 55:18.720
I interviewed her on my stream or when when we were on something together

55:18.800 --> 55:23.680
But she's never promoted my ideas as good never promoted my stream as good

55:24.160 --> 55:27.520
Never said anything about that first slide or about this one

55:27.920 --> 55:30.400
Ever since she had this really hey jay

55:30.800 --> 55:36.480
Are you going to tell us about the mixtape analogy and the seedy analogy because that one really worked for me

55:36.960 --> 55:41.120
After you I heard you say that I was up all night and it really made sense

55:42.560 --> 55:45.600
Made so much sense that she's never said anything about it again

55:45.760 --> 55:50.080
Never promoted the idea again never bothered to encourage anyone to listen to me again

55:51.600 --> 55:55.920
Because she is part of this this little nato crew

55:57.040 --> 56:03.280
This little international crew of people that is helping to your from your pilot genetic analysis

56:03.280 --> 56:04.960
Which is very nice is there

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
Some way to be predictive meaning

56:08.240 --> 56:11.760
Right now we're in a situation where we have to play whack-a-mole every 10 years

56:12.640 --> 56:18.320
Where a new one's going to emerge is there's some way we can look across the spectrum of the coronavirus and say

56:18.720 --> 56:22.800
You know, these are the three or four that we should be looking for in the next few years

56:23.040 --> 56:28.880
I think the advent of synthetic biology or synthetic genome design actually may allow us to get to that question cheaply

56:28.960 --> 56:33.360
So it's the price of synthesizing viral genomes get down to about five cents a base

56:34.160 --> 56:38.720
You know, it's going to cost $1,500 the synthesizer coronavirus genome which may scare that

56:39.600 --> 56:41.920
That don't want to say scare the hell out of some of us

56:42.560 --> 56:46.000
But it does allow us to ask those questions in an affordable manner

56:46.480 --> 56:50.240
The other way to do it even more cheaply is to actually clone out the spike genes

56:50.960 --> 56:58.960
And make in essence for confidence where you drop the spike gene of different bad coronaviruses that you think may have appropriate properties that could be

56:59.120 --> 57:01.120
emergent pre-emergent strain

57:01.760 --> 57:07.520
and characterize their ability to replicate in human self. So what is the spike gene according to my

57:08.480 --> 57:15.360
best guess understanding of exosomes when your body communicates between tissues or even communicates with

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
other cons specifics around you

57:18.240 --> 57:23.840
It will package small genetic signals either DNA or RNA most likely mostly RNA

57:24.400 --> 57:30.080
Into a small lipid particle called an exosome and on the outside of that exosome there may or may not be

57:30.640 --> 57:34.320
A protein which makes that message a little bit more specific

57:34.960 --> 57:36.960
like a mailbox finder or a

57:38.240 --> 57:42.480
Key and a lock kind of thing which again, we are attributing now and and

57:42.960 --> 57:47.040
Ralph barrick and all of these virologists attribute exclusively to viruses

57:47.120 --> 57:51.040
They've come up with a way of taking our lipids and and putting us

57:51.680 --> 57:58.240
A key molecule on the outside that works perfect with our our locks and it can go in different places

57:59.040 --> 58:02.640
And so what he's proposing basically is that there is a consensus

58:03.360 --> 58:09.360
Self-replicating RNA that we understand as this signal in bats and in other animals

58:10.320 --> 58:13.600
And we want to study it. So we're going to make this synthetic DNA

58:14.400 --> 58:19.600
Consensus of it and then we're going to replace the outside proteins which encode for

58:20.240 --> 58:23.840
What cells it can bind to or enter or what interact with

58:24.400 --> 58:32.000
And we're going to just change that one with recombinant DNA technology and make clones of all of these things just like we've explained before

58:32.480 --> 58:34.320
so essentially

58:34.320 --> 58:38.160
The diversity of coronaviruses has been greatly enhanced

58:38.720 --> 58:43.520
Because they just make synthetic versions of what they say they found in nature

58:44.000 --> 58:48.400
And then they work from there and the establishment of the virus itself is based on

58:48.960 --> 58:50.960
The making of that synthetic RNA

58:51.600 --> 58:56.160
And so what I find frustrating and what I think a lot of these people really want to try and distort

58:56.560 --> 59:01.040
Is that my argument isn't that that means that viruses exist in the way that they say

59:01.440 --> 59:06.000
It means exactly the opposite. It means that viruses don't exist in the way that they say

59:06.480 --> 59:12.240
They're almost intractable experimentally from mother nature and in order to overcome this problem

59:12.640 --> 59:16.480
They can create the illusion of all this extra diversity back there

59:16.960 --> 59:18.960
By using techniques

59:19.120 --> 59:21.120
Featured in a book like this

59:21.120 --> 59:26.320
The metagenomic sequencing techniques that are featured in the viral storm by and by nathan wolf

59:27.040 --> 59:31.280
And so you amplify all of the signals in the background and then you look for

59:31.840 --> 59:34.560
Signals that signal coronavirus to you

59:35.520 --> 59:41.280
But if of course there are exosomes from the mammal that you sampled there are exosomes from the environment

59:41.280 --> 59:45.440
There are there are bacteriophages from the environment and they all end up into this

59:46.000 --> 59:51.360
Modge podge of sample that you amplify everything in then the odds of you finding a

59:52.080 --> 59:58.720
Sequence that will give you a positive amplicon give you a positive signal for an RNA dependent RNA polymerase

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.400
Knowing full well that we use them and other animals must use them too

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.160
Then you're not really finding anything that's indicative of a coronavirus. You're finding an enzyme

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.400
And that's indeed how the solution was started. They find the enzyme

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.840
Then they say they look for the spike and then they take that spike and they make a whole

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:23.840
Self-replicating RNA DNA construct from it and they put that out of cell culture and then that becomes their virology

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.360
And so the only question is what really happens in those cell cultures and to what extent

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.720
Is that biologically relevant to the real world in my mind?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.800
It doesn't matter because what's biologically relevant in the real world is what he says

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.640
And what kevin mccarn says and are not kevin mccarn

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.120
But kevin mccernan says and what ray kirtzweiler says about the impact of the ever

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.680
exponentially decreasing cheapness of making RNA and DNA

01:00:53.600 --> 01:01:01.440
Now I would really like to talk to mike eden or someone else with some real manufacturing experience about what they can actually do

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.880
And what they claim they can do because if you talk to kevin mccernan

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.040
I guess kevin mccernan would say that if you want to make leaders of a pure dna molecule

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.280
That's really easy and to what extent that purity is pure

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.280
What kind of contaminants would be in there how much variation there would be in a quantity of that size?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.480
I don't know I don't know to what extent that they've lied about this stuff, but I do know it's pretty

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040
It's pretty likely that they have lied

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.160
It's pretty likely that when they try to make a pure copy of a dna molecule

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.640
They get it right most of the time, but not all of the time

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.680
Which again is a problem from the perspective of using this as a transfection or transformation

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.800
Technology basis in healthy humans

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:49.920
It's fine if you're trying to mess with the biology of an animal or the biology of a of a of a of a litter of animals

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.920
Or even the biology of a whole you know

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.840
A whole animal facility full of animals

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:02.080
That's very different than when you start to say that you're going to augment the immune system of a healthy child or even a pregnant woman

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.120
with transformation or transfection and and claim some

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.480
Extreme fidelity in the manufacturing or extreme control over the sequence that you're actually producing and to a large extent

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.240
We're supposed to take their word for it that has that becomes cheaper to make it

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.640
They're also making it better or with higher fidelity when my guess is is that

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.600
They try very hard for us not to know the real fidelity of this product and the products like it

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.680
They try to make us really not understand that and it may be that 99% of it is is the dna molecule that they claim

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.600
But that 1% could be very very deadly from an immune

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400
Immunological perspective

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.320
If you think about contamination and what signals we don't know

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:57.440
All of this stuff just discounts the the sacredness that's present at this irreducible complexity that these people don't want to acknowledge

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.400
And you can see that Ralph Barrick is kind of he's kind of uncomfortable with this

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.240
I think because he knows it's an illusion of consensus. He doesn't feel good

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:13.440
About talking about oh, you know, we're making stuff in laboratory. He doesn't want to be that guy, but that's his job

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.680
And so I think these people came out very very early and they had a lot of controlled narratives that they were going to roll out

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.960
And whichever ones rolled out and stuck they they amplified

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.040
And so they knew which ones they definitely wanted to amplify

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.520
You know the whole discussion of bears was a neutered discussion from the very beginning because oh my gosh all these numbers

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.240
And then you just have these other people on the other side saying yeah, but those numbers are not verified. That's just dumb

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.240
And so

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.560
An exclusive focus on bears from the very very beginning

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.760
That was only really complemented by a focus on the spike protein as evidence of gain of function was a completely neutered narrative

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.520
Nobody was ever going to win if that was your position and in fact

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.240
So many of the people that we ended up following in 2020 if you can remember back then

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:11.760
Really were exclusively focused on a gain of function spike protein as evidence and they were they were really really focused on

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.400
Really really focused on bears being evidence of something very very bad

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.040
And how many of these people were advocating for lockdowns just not lockdowns on everybody

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.160
I mean the great barington declaration is kind of a fraud in that sense to me because I didn't see through it

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.920
I signed the great barington declaration

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:44.240
It seemed reasonable to say that we shouldn't lock everybody down because I had kids in school and I didn't want them locked out

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:51.040
But at that time I didn't see that that was effectively just somebody pretending to stop the train pretending to stand up

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.360
Because they were epidemiologists

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:02.080
That's the crazy part about it. They could have looked at the data or demanded the data to understand exactly what was going on

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.280
But they in no way shape or form usefully or or or in any wise

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.800
Question the the illusion the narrative that was there this

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760
novel virus

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.040
They just questioned the lockdown

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.840
Some people were just standing up for early treatment and ivermectin

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:30.800
Some people were just standing up for the idea that no no there's natural immunity. That's ridiculous. There's overlapping immunity with

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.520
previous coronaviruses

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.320
And that's where I found myself arguing about the fact that well there are other sars and there were other sars

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.920
And so if there were lab leaks and stuff then maybe there's a background

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.400
That we're all immune to that there were all seroprevalent two at times

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.160
And so the idea that they're taking this background that we're all

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:58.080
reacting to all the time that we've always been reacting to that we're always seropleverant to some of the time and

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.240
Distorting it as a new signal from a new virus that just came out for the first time

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.360
And the concept that that

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.520
Idea

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.040
is just

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.200
Patently ridiculous to robert malone. It's so ridiculous. He won't even entertain the idea

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.360
It's patently ridiculous to sash a lot to pove it had to have been a toxins

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.800
And the d o d

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.600
And it's absurd to maryll nass who's a

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.440
Lifelong

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.680
Bioweapons expert and insists that she's been infected with covid untested three times

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.960
And that she's treated successfully a lot of people with ivermectin

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.960
And so obviously there was something new

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.800
Look at the symptoms that she's seen in her patients or heard in her telemed conversations

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.880
And so this is how it was created. It was a scooby-doo it was a mystery that we solved

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.720
And these people getting us to argue about different things were part of this mystery and getting us to spend hours

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.560
Arguing about some of these irrelevant things was part of this mystery because as long as you're working on those details

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.800
You're not asking the question of did they just murder people and lie about it

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.480
That's the only question that none of these people will ask

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.080
None of these people will state even as succinctly

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.880
As we have said it over the last few weeks

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.760
None of these people that are part of the team worst case scenario that's trying to confound the effects of a gain of function spike with a

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.520
A a still spreading risk additive pathogen

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.760
Most of the people on team worst case scenario are not americans

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.800
Most of the americans that are part of worst team worst case scenario. I think were co-opted early because they did try to stand up

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.160
I think that might be p.r. Corey. I think that might be

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.280
Uh ryan cole. I think that might be uh peter mccollum

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.920
And so we have to give them room and and and pray for them to have courage that they if this is indeed

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:14.720
The case that they have the courage to stand up and and and and free our children from this illusion and of course that would be

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.400
Uh a very very difficult move for any of them to make

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:27.520
But even privately calling me and edifying my work by saying dude you're on the right track would be really helpful from any of them

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.680
So if if there's any ounce of courage any of these people left

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.040
And they are still interested in trying to oppose the slavers that are are doing this to us

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.560
Now is really the time because the coming

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.320
The coming battles are going to get get pretty ugly. I can feel it already because we are again

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.000
Like I said, we are at the end now. There are no more actors to bring on stage

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.440
um

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.200
the the

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440
Actors are now being exposed

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:58.640
and

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.600
Robert Malone is really at the heart of these actors and the heart of this

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.520
This whole

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:13.360
Dissident movement. That's why he's traveled the world with sasha latipova and and jessica rose and maryll nass and and pere corey

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.360
And that's why they have hot tub pictures and and shoe pictures. Um, these are all

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
part of the same

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.360
Illusion of consensus and i'm i'm absolutely certain that what makes robert melon

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.960
Especially important to understand is how many people have been

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:38.560
Fooled by him how many people have been fooled by maryll nass to believe that these people are really standing up for us and are really

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.120
Fighting for america when in fact they are working for the people who are trying to destroy her

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.640
That's why he didn't save any americans from the shot. That's why he didn't bother to save

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.520
Any of the us military from the shot

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.560
And early on in the pandemic he was saying he worked for ditra and the dod and we and we and we but when it came

01:09:59.120 --> 01:09:59.760
to

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760
to saving people from a mandate

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.200
It's nowhere to be found he was just making sure novio was ready in case they got the call

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.160
He was just trying to make sure that steve kirsch had all his paperwork in for the euase

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.160
And

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.400
And I think these people are a lot of them now it's it's hard to excuse them anymore

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.040
I think they've been knowingly spreading these bad ideas notably knowingly interfering with me

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.120
Um and my ability to to earn a living with my

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.360
On behalf of my family and I think at some point

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.400
We're all going to have to come to the conclusion that even the novirus people at some point

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.400
Some of them were not playing a fair game and that's the reason why

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.400
They went around and around and around in the same hamster wheel of

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.560
Culturing viruses isolating viruses and purifying viruses

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.480
Rather than also talking about the fact that virology is so dumb

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.600
That they would actually lie about it. They would actually create fear uncertainty and doubt

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.800
They would actually give do not resuscitate orders under the idea that we we don't want any more spread

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.400
And so that they would have lots of people that would normally get an ambulance and maybe even get a get a little, you know

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.680
A shock and then then their heart attack would be okay

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.080
These people were allowed to die and we don't know how many people were allowed to die at home

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.200
But it doesn't seem like all the numbers in new york are real

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.280
Simply because there is no there are no traumatized emps

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.280
There are no traumatized nurses or or fire department members or police officers

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.640
That had to deal with the supposed leaf almost 5,000 people dying per week for three weeks

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.960
And so I think it was a very clever combination of

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.680
Pulling numbers from from december and january and declaring them dead in in

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.160
February or march

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.360
It could have been several months of data that was pulled forward

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.000
It could have been all kinds of different means of fraud

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.280
But the the chances that there were actually

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:12.720
About 25,000 people killed in five weeks in new york city and all those bodies were dealt with and there's no trauma from that

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.560
No memorial from that is highly unlikely

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.080
It's interesting that the story of the

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.960
Protocols being murder has always been sliced and diced into different things like remdesivir

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.480
Or or ventilators or anything like that

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.360
But they never really get to the point where anybody said that we weren't using antibiotics when we should have

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.120
That we used only one time. I've only heard one person say it was robert malone in 2021

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.240
That we used dexamethasone to beat down people's immune system so we could get them out of the hospital and send them to care homes

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.040
So imagine if you had these people in the icu

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.480
They were already sick with pneumonia and you wanted to get them out of the icu because covid's coming

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.320
And so you gave them dexamethasone and then sent them to a care home instead where they would die

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.160
They're pneumonia because they weren't in the icu anymore or something like that

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.360
Imagine what you can imagine if you're an md and not me

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.840
And why there's no md imagining how all the ways that we made a mistake and ended up murdering people

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.640
Why isn't any or any of these mds that are in front of us willing to go?

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.160
Hey, wait a minute

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.240
If I was right about ivermectin then that means they were wrong about

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.560
High flow oxygen. They were wrong about ventilators. They were wrong about gremdesivir

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.200
They were wrong about medazolab. They were wrong about morphine. They were wrong about not feeding people

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.960
They were wrong about not giving them water and they were wrong about all that stuff

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.160
But instead

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.760
Some most of these people just say if not all of them say that ivermectin ivermectin ivermectin they were wrong about ivermectin

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.320
And the list is not even done yet of course because in addition to the things we just mentioned there's a huge

01:13:53.040 --> 01:14:01.120
Increase in in the all-cause mortality across the younger age groups not associated with a risk additive spreading respiratory pathogen

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600
but with a risk additive

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.560
synthetic chemical opiate

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.520
That in extremely small quantities even on skin exposure can kill people

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.880
And the flooding of our streets with this material

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.680
Completely ignored by all these people that purport to be patriots

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.840
So the death certificate fraud and the financial incentives to commit it

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.520
The track and trace the masks the closures the mandates the pcr fraud the lateral flow test fraud

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.040
How many of these things were produced in china the pcr testing the lateral flow testing come on?

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.760
This is absolutely absurd

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.880
The sequencing fraud they claim that we could have but we didn't and now we have 15 million

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:50.960
Sequences of this virus but we haven't been paying attention to these hiv inserts or the fear and cleavage site

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.680
Or the staphylcocadenterotoxin B homology or any of these other mimicry

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.280
Sequences that we said were bad in the original sequence hell

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.880
We've got these we identified these amyloid eigenic sequences

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.400
But we haven't bothered to see whether they're in delta or an omicron either

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.760
And we identified a few pre antigenic sequences

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.560
But you know who cares they're really close to the receptor binding domain that everybody's paying attention to so

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.520
I wonder if we should pay attention to which variants those things are in

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.800
It's all part of a giant set of hamster wheels

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.400
It's like a great big lala palooza of liars and they've all been coerced or coordinatedly

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.800
Coordinatedly

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:44.160
Forced to accept this this narrative and to not question it until it's going to be okay on the script

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.880
And so a lot of them have made progress and all you're going to see some of the progress

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.880
They they should purport to have made but it's an illusion

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.320
It's an illusion because the illusion of consensus still exists that there was a risk additive pathogen

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.280
I think

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.680
I think I have this right do I have this right

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840
It's up here

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240
No, I don't

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.960
Hold on one second. Give me a second give me a second

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.160
How are you guys doing is it still in sync? Are we really killing it now? That's really great if it's true

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
Um

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920
How about that there we go

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.880
Okay, let's see if this works. Oh, man, what happened. I wanted my song. I didn't my song play

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.520
How come it's not playing what the hell

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.640
Cannot play media. Oh, I gotta I gotta escape. I guess I just

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360
Blue out some some circuits here

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.760
It'll come back. Don't worry. I trust I trust the machine

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.280
This this guy is pretty pretty stable with me

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.840
Okay

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:37.280
Okay, so today we are going to look at a video with um, Campbell and girodo and Weinstein about

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:44.000
Aspiration, I hope I spelled that correctly and we're trying to build an understanding of the illusion and how it was built

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.200
Mark's urodo is a really interesting character because

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.080
I've noticed a pattern

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.760
Some of these slowly being elevated people

01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.640
All share one common sort of connection that at one point in time in 2022 or late 2021

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.720
They were all involved in steve curses steering committee and

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.120
Also involved in panda

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.120
And a lot of these people were present in both groups when I was invited to present to panda for the first time

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.200
And I think it was after my second presentation at panda that I was finally

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.080
Invited to steve curses steering committee where I then found out that marxia redo

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.080
John bodewin matt crawford

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440
Jessica rose and

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.120
Stephanie sineff and even kevin mccurnan. We're all part of this group of people that kind of met every week on thursdays

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.400
And and and when I got invited to it, it's interesting because the first meeting that I showed up to

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:51.920
um, steve curse said almost word-for-word what george web said when I met him in

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.920
uh, eastern pennsylvania or central pennsylvania when

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.440
Him and and marqulak had coordinated this little thing to go to the windber institute and other things

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.200
I drove out there with my dog

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.400
And I met some of the supporters that that show up at some of these things and I met george web in person

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.440
And when he introduced me to the table or two of people there

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.920
Um, he introduced me as the great

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:22.000
Um, jonathan cooley or something like that and when I was in the in the steve curse podcast or per podcast when I was in

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.360
The steering committee when I first joined that group. Um, he said that it was such an honor to meet the

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.880
The whatever magnificent jonathan cooley or something like that. So whenever anybody introduces me like that

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.120
Or brings me into a group with a lot of overt praise

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.400
Um, i'm immediately turned off because I don't play

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.600
I'm not playing this. I don't I don't want to do this for that. That's not why i'm doing it

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:54.160
I'm doing it because I really feel like our sacred biology our irreducible complexity that I want my

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
Children to appreciate as beauty

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.360
Is being stolen from us by this by these people that are spreading this mythology that we can do

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:09.040
Back of them napkin calculations and think about things that are beyond our understanding right now

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.120
And it bothers me a lot that that john kambal is still

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.480
Confusing to people he saved no one in the uk from transformation

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.840
And he saved no one in the rest of the western world from

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.520
Transfection the same can be said for for a jeerado and the same can be said for bret

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.880
Weinstein and now we're going to see a podcast where they're featured together with a little tucker carlson too

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320
It's just crazy to me

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.280
Ah, there's a cardinal in the background that's sweet

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.600
And I think we can just demonstrate this at the most blatant form of what you're talking about so we have a

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.680
That's probably a slightly larger needle than we would use normally

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
But when we stick that in

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.440
We don't know where it's going because we can't see it now of course

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:10.160
We learn learn anatomical malan mark to put it in the heart of a muscle double toy muscle or fast as lotteralis or gastrocnemius

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.280
in the

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.480
In the gluteal region, but if you if it goes into a blood vessel then it's really quite simple that

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.520
This is full of water, but if you aspirate back

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.480
then what you can see

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.720
Is the blood will go in?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.400
however

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.000
if these

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.040
Transfection agents circulate around the body as we know they do and get taken up haphazardly

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.160
Then whatever tissues start producing use foreign proteins is going to be attacked by your immune system

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.240
So you definitely wouldn't want any of this getting near a person's heart or brain

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.760
um

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.280
Definitely not so if you don't want to get near a person's heart or brain where on

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.520
Late December 2021, Robert Malone said the spike protein would go

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
um

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.160
Just just curious if you noticed that

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.720
I mentioned somebody has received one of these Transfection shots and

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.520
Especially in the unfortunate case where

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.160
It has been injected intravenously, which isn't supposed to happen

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.520
But the instructions on this shot were not to aspirate the needle

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.400
The proper injection should involve pulling back on the plunger in the syringe in order to see if there's blood

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.680
If there's blood that indicates that you've landed in

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.640
A circulatory vessel and that you should back the needle off or plunge it farther so that you're not injecting indirectly into the vein

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.400
but

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400
in the case of these shots

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.920
Amazing as the sounds the advice was don't do that because it requires the needle to be in the person's arm longer

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.440
might create extra pain and they didn't want to create vaccine hesitancy was there excuse so anyway, you might get a big bolus of

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.080
This material and it might flow right through your heart and get taken up by a bunch of cells

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.800
Yeah, and of course tell us what that means mark

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.880
Well typically that would mean that you're inserted into a blood vessel

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.240
um

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.240
But along the way as you were you know pushing that needle down in the muscle, it's going to push on cells

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.720
It's going to counter

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.680
Small veins of vennels or art or small archeries

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:24.080
Arterials, um and and it's going to some of the first thing to remember is that marks you to do and

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.040
Brett Weinstein are

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.320
very close to not qualified to comment on this at all

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:38.400
And my guess is is that neither of them have done the requisite reading in order to really be able to comment on virology or

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.360
Or molecular biology at all but marx una doh

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.920
Has made a

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:51.040
Name for himself on sub stack by doing all kinds of back of that napkin calculations about how many particles are in this size of a bolus

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.160
And what that means for cells and all this other things

01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.960
And none of these calculations are meaningful because he's just some former farmer pharma exec

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.480
He's just somebody who worked for them before the pandemic started

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.960
So when he started speaking out as a

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.280
As an authority he was speaking out on behalf of having a career

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.840
Did he throw it away and not like Mike Eden did not like I did

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:26.000
Not like kurut with kausky did or or wolf gang wodok or any of these people did maryll nass lose anything so far

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:34.240
Has being an outspoken critic of of the anthrax vaccine and being featured in newspapers about it

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.040
Has that adversely affected her or is it just the the barn burning that happened

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.160
Push them and often cut them

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.280
And and and and that's I think

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.240
Uh, you know, I got I may I could uh as well. I think everybody got trapped into

01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:03.920
Um the way our brain works and and and and that is the fact that for for anybody who's experienced an intravenous injection

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.680
It has to be done in a certain way in a proper way and it's extremely complicated for doctors and nurses to do that right

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:19.280
And therefore the the the medical community has for most likely a hundred years

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Presumed

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.080
That it was

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.520
Oh, man

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.920
No, I'm sorry. If you still think stocks this is my max. So I don't have a

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.920
Passive income investment. I haven't fixed that yet. It's an old max. So I can't get all this an intravenous injection

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:45.600
It has to be done in a certain way in a proper way and it's extremely complicated for doctors and nurses to do that right

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560
and therefore

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.200
The the medical community has for most likely a hundred years

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.080
Presumed

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.240
That it was nearly impossible

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.720
to hit

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.720
A vessel

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.280
um when you're doing an intramuscular injection

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400
but the problem is

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.000
uh when you

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.240
Step back a minute and you say well is there another way

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.680
And the other way is fluid dynamics

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:22.160
Remember a muscle people don't realize that a muscle is actually fluid

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.280
It sells and interstitial fluid

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.000
So when you're inserting your your needle inside the muscle

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.920
And you're cutting through those vessels

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.440
These vessels are open in a fluid

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:38.880
Okay

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.120
And and we've known since uh pascal and bernuilla that that

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:49.840
That if ever you inject you push pressure on a liquid it'll go where there's least pressure

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.240
And and indeed there's least least pressure in those

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.120
in those vessels and therefore

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.760
It's not even we don't even need to prove it. It's a scientific law

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.120
If it's within the distance of of of of expansion

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.440
Of the vaccine injection or the dose

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.680
A bit of it will go if it's very close

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400
and if the

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.280
The the vessel it's cut is actually large enough a very big dose will go

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.320
um

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.160
If it's further away

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.160
The dose will diminish a bit like if you're um, you know around a fire

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.800
If you're too close to the fire

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760
As you're going away

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.000
There's still energy coming at you, but it's disseminated across and at one point you can't feel

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.840
The fire anymore. It's exactly the same thing

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640
That's happening and after that

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.320
What does it mean? It I mean if you can't hear how much bullshit that is already. I don't know

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.320
I mean that that's that's we could stop right there. He's equating

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.360
How the lipid nanoparticle preparation the transfection or transformation

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.280
Disperses from the injection site

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.400
Based on the idea of like light or heat from a fire

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.520
Um, not taking into account at all the chemical composition of the lipid nanoparticle

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600
Not taking into account at all

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.240
What what difference does that make?

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.560
You're still injecting an untested combination of substances

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.520
Into the muscle and expecting it to stay there and augment the immune system

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.520
And he's still telling a story

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.960
About how if we could just figure out how to do it right and it would stay there

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.600
Then we could use fully augment the immune system

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.760
Please

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.440
Please understand

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.760
That is the narrative that he's been pushing for like almost two years now

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:54.560
Behind the scenes in these forums as if he had solved the reason why previous vaccines were a problem

01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.280
Because if you inject these combinations of untested substances intramuscularly and you don't do it right

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680
It can cause autism

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:09.360
But if you aspirate and then do it slowly over several minutes so that you don't

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.360
You don't overstep the bounds of fluid dynamics

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.040
Then we can safely

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.680
Intramuscularly inject people with combination of substance combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.960
That is the argument that is being made here

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.200
Make no mistake about it

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.240
The only reason why most of you got hurt by the vaccine

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.240
The only reason why anybody gets hurt is because people don't do it right

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:45.920
It speaks nothing to the absolute ludicrous idea of trying to augment the immune system

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:51.680
By transforming or transfecting any of your body's cells to express a foreign protein

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:58.080
He wants you to completely ignore the absolute absurdity of that methodology cartoon

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.880
Whether it's transformation or transfection

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.680
He wants you to ignore that and instead try to generalize across all the intramuscular injections that we give

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.800
And understand that if we just did it right all of these

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.920
Bad side effects would probably disappear because

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.840
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is only dumb

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.480
If you don't aspirate or you push too hard

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.400
Instead you have a bolus

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:31.920
Which is a term that you know very well and very well John because in the medical

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.240
Establishment in hospitals when you want to deliver a drug

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.200
in a concentrated fashion

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.320
To the brain to do or to a contrast agent to the brain to do a brain scan for example

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.200
Or a drug to the heart or to deliver you actually inject it

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.840
with varying

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.600
speeds

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.760
Abolus a high concentration dose of particles

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.240
drugs or others

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.360
So that they are delivered in a concentrated fashion

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.920
So we know

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.200
That's

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.560
Systematically when you inject a vaccine, especially those curvy vaccines you are going to

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:18.080
Deliver somewhere into the body a concentrated dose of that vaccine

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.840
And that's a big problem

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.640
That's that's that's a very big problem because remember

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.680
So as long as the dosage isn't concentrated as long as you don't inject a bolus

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.960
It's going to be fine

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:36.960
If the lipid nanoparticle and its contents leak out through your body over the course of several hours

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.920
And thereby reach many more tissues in a much more dispersed way

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:48.560
I can tell you one thing for sure the likelihood of symptoms showing up in real time in a few days or a few weeks

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.640
is much lower

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:58.240
Because the immune system will attack fewer cells which means it will produce fewer possibilities

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:04.800
Maybe of an autoimmune reaction in any one place which means that any one place won't be damaged

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.200
You won't have a ruptured artery for the first three years

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.040
Or the first year like my friend nathan because it spread all through his body and the autoimmunity built up over time

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.120
And it was very slow

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.640
Whereas if you get a bolus in there and you can get it all in one place and maybe it'll destroy your aorta

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.640
But it won't be autoimmunity that destroys your aorta

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:35.120
It's just your immune system getting rid of the cells that express the foreign protein

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:43.200
The idea that challenging your immune system to decide whether or not they should just kill this cell or also build immunity

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:49.600
Immune memory to it is a very dumb challenge to put your immune system through and that challenge

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.560
I've argued with him before in private zoom meetings on panda and in front of steve kirsch

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.920
And he has talked over me and said that you're ridiculous jj and you're just too fired up

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.200
And none of this matters because bolus bolus bolus

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:11.040
This is a medler of the highest order being promoted by other medlers of the highest order

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.120
And the only reason why he wasn't on the dark horse podcast

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.400
Is because I sent a message to bret saying that if you have marx juda doe on your podcast

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.920
He is such a medler. You will look like a fool

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.040
And so instead what did the team do the team had bret go on on

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.560
On tucker carlson for a second time and in that second interview not the first interview

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.560
But the second interview he says

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.560
Agent twice and talks about the bolus theory

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.560
Meaning that the transfection agent might not be so bad if we were aware of the bolus theory

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.200
I hope you can see how malevolent

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.360
And how obvious it is that these people are not working for america. They are not helping americans

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.280
This is another foreigner

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.360
Campbell is a foreigner and they have very

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.680
uh

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.640
Developed opinions that do not question the fundamental narrative of a novel virus

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:19.200
That people needed to be transfected and transformed in order to prevent to to prevent it from going endemic

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.760
To prevent them from dying in the hospital that narrative

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.360
Is never questioned by these people when they say bolus bolus bolus bolus aspiration blood

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.680
And

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.720
That's why you can see john campbells still not saving anyone and neither is mike girdro

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.600
And for sure is not bret wine steam

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.640
I don't know if we had spoken about that last time, but these technologies emerge from

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.440
anti-cancer vaccines, right

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.680
Uh, what do anti-cancer vaccines do they they there's they're they're intended not to

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.280
trigger antibodies but to trigger t cells that are attacking tumors

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.400
So any one of these um

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.920
The transfected cells

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.040
It's interesting because he says attacking tumors. That's again

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.880
Him being a real shifty guy or being coached incorrectly on the the language, but any

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.360
effective

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.000
m rna aimed at a tumor is going to try to get the immune system to make a memory

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.840
That represents the cells in that tumor and allows it to differentiate from your own tissue

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.400
It's not to get t cells to go somewhere and do something

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:39.200
You're not putting a flag on the outside of the the tumor cells and then the t cells come in and act on that flag

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600
Which is exactly what?

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:50.560
Transfection to any protein if it's a spike protein or a viral protein or just an immunogen that was designed by epivacs and and and enovial

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.960
It is it is putting a flag on cells and telling the immune system

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.840
I dare you to kill this cell and not make memory to it

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.040
I dare you to kill this tissue cell and not make immune memory to it

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.320
I dare you to kill this one and not make immune memory to it

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.200
Even though

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:17.360
You're not supposed to be killing these cells anyway because they're on the inside of your body where the immune system is protecting rather than patrolling except for cancer

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:25.280
And so the immune system might want to make memory of cancer if it binds in so the immune system might want to make memory of a cell

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.360
That expresses a foreign protein and that might result in autoimmunity

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:38.160
And this man and robermalone and all of these people who have been inadequate and explaining that that was the fundamental objection to

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:41.600
Using transformation and transfection from the very beginning

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.200
It's a fundamental objection that we could have made from the very beginning

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.480
And the only reason why we did it is because these people are in a part of a coordinated effort to make sure we didn't

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.280
So

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.280
That would have taken

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.200
Part of those the vaccine a particle of vaccines will eventually get destroyed

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.760
By the immune system and if that's concentrated

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.120
Okay, if that's only if that's concentrated

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.480
That's a that's a real problem because it's going to

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080
To pose a challenge

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.640
To the environment

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.400
That is hitting we've never evolved for

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.680
you know large swaths of our

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.560
Linings of the the linings of our blood vessels to be it's not for nothing that he says we haven't evolved

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.760
It's very very coordinated. They want you to think about that, but this is a this is you're a product of nothing special

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.600
You're just a machine mindless machine made up of all kinds of little machines

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:55.360
And this this irreducible complexity is is an illusion and and a few back in the napkin calculations

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.000
We'll show you that it's really just fluid dynamics

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:06.160
Life and the immune system and an intramuscular injection is as simple as fluid dynamics going wrong

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:13.280
That's the reason why interacting with this irreducible complexity that we call the immune system is really

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:17.840
Complicated because intramuscular injection is difficult to do right

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.240
Joy by our immune system, right?

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.040
That's what we're seeing with with white cloth syndromes for example that you've been discussing recently

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.840
We've never evolved for that and it triggers a number of in that

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.800
So did he just suggest that that white cloth syndrome is explained by the bolus theory

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.760
Is he suggesting that the white cloths can be explained as what then

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.440
Are they clotting? What are they made of? I wonder if there's any IgG in there

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.560
I wonder if there's any light chain antibodies in that white stuff that they find in these people

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.200
Because one of the ways that

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.600
Transfection was known to probably go wrong

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.920
Would be to create a B so myeloma where you would have systemic amyloidosis

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.080
And the amyloidosis would be in the form of overproduced light chain antibody sequences

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.800
Made by B cells out of control

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.280
So I find it really interesting that somebody like kevin mccairn who's been on

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:27.600
Line for a very long time talking about amyloidosis and how the spike protein has amyloidogenic sequences in it

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.760
Has never bothered to explain to his viewers that

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.920
Amyloidosis at least from a systemic standpoint is most often

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.040
Manifest as a B cell myeloma or more rarely as a T cell myeloma

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:49.200
Which results in overproduction of light chain antibody proteins that start to link up and form amyloid

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.080
plaques

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.960
in cells and in in in in in uh extracellular spaces

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.280
And

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.800
So what you see very very clearly is a group of people

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.840
Like judy mikovitz and robert malone who have worked together or or crossed paths in their careers for years

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:19.200
That have been involved in the ongoing narrative about retroviruses called hiv or xmrv or or

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.400
Or human lymphocyte

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.560
uh

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.680
What is it htlv something like that all of these different retroviruses that are supposedly

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:38.240
Found by these people that are latent in the background that could explain vaccine injury could explain chronic fatigue syndrome and now suddenly

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.240
chronic peteam syndrome and all this stuff is just vanished and all it is is long covid and and here we are

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.120
Where a guy like marx uro doh is going to spend an hour and a half with

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.840
With john kamble talking bolus bolus bolus instead of murder and lies murder and lies murder and lies

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.920
And now it basically then it's just lies

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.320
Sis

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.640
Uh, which which are which should align very much with all of the um adverse events that we've seen

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.880
What?

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.080
There's two

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.760
the

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.920
uh, which which are which aligned very much with all of the

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.920
Of the the linings of our blood vessels to be destroyed by our immune system

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.920
Right, that's what we're seeing with with white cloth syndromes for example

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.920
That you've been discussing recently

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.640
We've never resolved for that and it triggers a number of imbalances

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.920
Uh, which which are which aligned very much with all of the um adverse events that we've seen

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.680
And there's two things that obviously we want to aspirate and

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.240
Stop pointing that out

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.120
National guidelines telling nurses and doctors not to aspirate. It's just unbelievable. We should be aspirating all injections

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.680
And as you pointed out mark

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.000
It's how quick you inject it. So if you if you inject something really quite slowly

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.600
Then you're going to get relatively low low pressure

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.640
If you inject if you inject it quickly

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.400
Unbelievable then you're going to get high pressure. It's going to be unbelievable

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.440
That they're playing this if we inject it quickly. We're going to destroy

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:26.240
These the walls of these delicate blood vessels as you say capillaries arterials venules very delicate walls

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.680
And that means that the fluid that we've injected this in this

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.080
Interstitial space is going to go into the blood vessels. Don't let them fool you first of all

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.640
He's holding up a great bang syringe. That's already stupid

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:42.320
I don't know what the volume of the shot was but it wasn't it wasn't multi milliliters

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.440
and so

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.440
again, we're talking about

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.760
We're misconstruing things as explaining more than they explain

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.560
Is it possible that a certain percentage of people are

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.720
Their reaction to an intramuscular injection is compounded by

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.720
by

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:04.240
In an ad verdant IV or or interior arterial injection. It's possible

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.640
I'm going to say that's not the case one of the anecdotes that he uses is these bodybuilders that are injecting a

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.560
milliliter to of

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.760
Of testosterone and when they do that sometimes they get a big tingling thing because it went intravenously and other times

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760
It doesn't and they can tell the difference

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.640
This doesn't change the fact that the testosterone seems to affect all the muscles in their body now does it

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.520
Whether or not they get the rush

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:34.480
And the numbness or whatever happens when they get an IV injection or whether it goes normally

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.120
The testosterone doesn't either

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.160
Affect only the muscle you injected in like that quad

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.280
But not the right quad but the left quad

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.120
Unless you hit the vein and then it'll affect all the muscles in your body

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.480
That's the ridiculousness of the discussion that they're having right here because that is

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:59.120
Indeed one of the anecdotal observations that marx juda doe used to throw out all the time

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.720
That supported the idea that bolus injection was important

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.760
And bodybuilders confirm it

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.760
Do they

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.800
Or do bodybuilders that know how to do intramuscular injection have to inject in every muscle

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.600
Or something like that

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.840
And I know you're going to argue. Oh, no rna's bigger or the lipid nanoparticles bigger

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:28.080
No, it's the fundamental argument that intramuscular injection when done correctly is is a okay way of putting stuff into somebody's body

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:35.360
I'm trying to make the argument that that fundamental idea of him holding a needle up in my face

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:42.080
Actually bothers me a lot because I don't actually understand why that's considered a good idea anymore

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.600
If you need it to go in you need it to either go here, right?

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.120
Or you need it to go here, but then very slowly

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.520
I don't think there's ever a good reason to put something in there

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.720
Now maybe if it's a pure substance with saline and it's a chemical that will go everywhere like testosterone

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.000
Then maybe the ramifications aren't and the and the repercussions are not that big of a deal

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:16.400
Maybe occasionally you will get some tissue damage or necrosis there because of the nature of the bolus idea

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.760
Maybe occasionally every once in a while. Maybe somebody has a heart attack from that or something. I don't know

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.840
But what I need you to see is that these two

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.640
fakers plus

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.080
Plus plus that faker on tucker carlson

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.920
They're all not talking about the fact that they they probably

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.920
Lied about how many people died in new york city and lied about how many people died in italy

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:49.680
And lied about how many people were testing positive and then lied about whether they were actually testing positive or they were just model projections

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.040
And this combination of lies and deception

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.240
And the spectacular commitment to believing all of them that was led by

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.960
Weinstein and Campbell

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.760
on youtube

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.320
Led everybody to think that the mystery to solve was where the hell did this king come from

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.120
And how bad is it going to be?

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:16.720
Instead of focusing on the biology the ridiculousness of transforming or transfecting

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:23.040
Innocent people that are healthy and have no risk added in pathogen to fear

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.240
None of that biology was questioned by marx geno doe the super smart guy

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.600
None of that biology has been questioned by this guy and this guy is actually waving a red needle in your face

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.480
To get relatively low low pressure

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.440
If you're injected if you inject it quickly

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.640
Then you're going to get high pressure it's going to go everywhere

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.320
And if we inject it quickly we're going to destroy

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:57.040
These the walls of these delicate blood vessels as you say capillaries arterials venules very delicate walls

01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.560
And that means that the fluid that we've injected this in this

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:06.640
Interstitial space is going to go into the blood vessels and you've actually calculated with Pfizer and Moderna, I believe

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.120
how big an area

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.800
this

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.800
Depot that there's this

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.400
Fomalous that's being given we'll occupy in the muscle. Yes. It's an expansion of fear in a way

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.360
From you know with the the needles tip

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.880
At the center and it's about 0.8 centimeters for Pfizer and about 1.1 if I recall

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.680
For modana because they have a larger dose there's 0.5 millimeter and 0.3 millimeter for Pfizer

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.680
so

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.920
Within that area you're at risk now. What's important after that?

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.040
Details that don't matter the size of the syringe was different. Oh, man. Maybe that explains it

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.920
Holy balls

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.000
Stan is that

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.160
There is also a preconceived idea

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.160
That it's okay, even if it's a small part of the dose

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600
Right and remember Pfizer

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.160
At least that's what they said originally

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:10.960
Had said that they their vaccine was 10 billion nanoparticles and Muliana said 40 billion now

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.880
I had calculated that a coin size, you know a coin size

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.000
aneurysm in the aorta is about

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.720
60,000 cells

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.720
Okay, so

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.720
60,000 nanoparticles hitting your aorta in a concentrated fashion

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.840
During that first minute, okay, because of what i'm talking about is this bolus

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.000
Has a very short window of opportunity between the moment

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.640
It's inactive because it's coated and the moment it's disseminated and completely fragmented and diluted

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.040
There's a short window

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.160
During which it can actually be very dangerous

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:56.640
And and so is he really now limiting himself to explaining all the those events that occur

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.920
Moments later or or minutes later

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.400
And all the other events then are not caused by this bolus, right?

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.880
That's almost what he's admitting right here. I wonder if john kamble will pick up on that

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.440
You know just so you understand that little

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.120
coin size aneurysm that that's will

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.040
Eventually, you know for five months later

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.560
You know crack and open up and you'll have this section of your aorta and you will die

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.320
um

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:31.280
This is zero points zero zero zero six percent

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.440
Of the Pfizer vaccine it's a tiny

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160
Share of it and therefore

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.920
And i'm not even talking about a stroke

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.880
In the brain or you know my best friend who had who had a leak an arterial leak had

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.440
His leak almost killed him and it was one millimeter

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.920
Uh

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.960
Why the one mill one square millimeter and and within 10 days he was dying

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.600
Uh because he was losing his blood

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:06.240
Uh, so and that's a one millimeter is

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.280
750 and so then what happened they closed the hole

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.520
There was no auto immunity. He's still alive. They just went in and found the one millimeter hole and closed it

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.520
What kind of bull shit story is this?

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:21.120
Uh and to tell yourself it's it's nothing

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:25.360
Therefore, this is this is did he really say that?

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
And that's what he was dying

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.880
Uh because he was losing his blood. Uh, so and that's a one millimeter is 750

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.560
One millimeter hole. Do you actually believe that there if there was a one millimeter hole

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.960
In an artery that your clotting mechanism wouldn't cover it

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.240
That the flexibility of the endothelial cells wouldn't close that hole easily that

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.000
That clotting wouldn't happen. Do you really build a one millimeter hole?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.560
Think about that for a second, please because you've had paper cuts that bleed shorter than that

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.520
You've had paper cuts that are

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.880
Are our centimeters long and and are able to clot up and close in a matter of minutes

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.440
I just can't believe he's saying this. What does that even mean?

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:17.760
How did they verify that there was a one millimeter hole in whatever arteries he's talking about?

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:22.640
This is the level of bullshit that they are engaged in right now

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:30.480
The level of cover that they think that they have already established with the with the mouth breathing tv watching public and the skilled

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.840
Social media users that are that this is aimed at

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:41.520
We are being actively insulted by the lack of depth that this this shitty model

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.840
Um even purports to explain it's extraordinary

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.960
Uh endothelial cells. It's it's nothing

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:53.040
Therefore, this is this is very important

01:51:53.520 --> 01:52:01.360
And I think what's going to we're going to have to to contemplate is completely overhauling the delivery mechanisms of vaccines

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.080
Um and potentially have other drugs

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.760
Uh that are causing uh, we're going to need all new technology to deliver this shit. Oh my gosh

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.200
You know we should call we should call robert melon because he

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:17.280
Has these devices at an obeo that you could electroperate the skin

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:24.720
And so we could convert all the the rna to dna and then we could electroperate that dna or rna into the skin

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.440
And we would avoid this problem all together

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:34.160
I think that that maybe mark jeera doh and and robert melon are on the same team. Wouldn't that be surprising

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.320
Similar problems

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.080
Of course, this is the way i've been taught to to give medicines or my life

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.960
I learned to do intramuscular injections when i was 18 and you

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:53.600
You put it in you take care to us again stabilizing the needle stop showing me the red needle

01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.400
Inject it relatively slowly

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:03.040
And yet for some reason the world health organization changed these guidelines. It's just bizarre

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:10.000
That the world health organizations would change safe tried and tested guidelines for what I consider to be on safe practice

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.120
It's obviously unsafe

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.080
That's certain and it's the fact that we've added that

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.280
The fact that we've added so many new shots

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.720
Okay

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:29.680
So by by my my calculation because even with aspiration for example if you take the the bodybuilders

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.200
So is he gonna point oh

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:34.480
Did you hear it the bodybuilders? So we're going we'll get we'll let him play

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.960
But you you you understand right that there's no useful objection here

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.600
In other words, he's a frenchman

01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:49.200
He could be very sophisticated enough to understand that hey, you know this national security state in the united states that push these shots

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:58.320
Yeah, have you ever compared the united states vaccine schedule to the french vaccine schedule you ever compared the united states vaccine schedule to the rest of the european schedule

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:04.800
Because it's notably different is he gonna say that no he's gonna keep repeating stuff about bolus bolus bolus

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.040
Because just like the rest of these team worst case scenario participants

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:13.760
They have one or two messages that they're supposed to stick to they have one or two

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.840
Questions that they want to make sure you ask and waste enough time and cognitive energy trying to

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.680
Pull yourself away from those questions that you don't use fully question the heart of the narrative

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:28.240
Which is that they murdered people and lied about it

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.640
Um

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:36.640
Have a tremendous experience with that and and they have a feedback loop that's immediate. It's called trend cough

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.800
when the when the when the steroids they inject themselves

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.480
Gets to the lungs they they start coughing and because they collapse so they have feedback

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.880
They know that even

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.440
World aspiration and and injecting slowly there's a minimum of two percent

01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.160
I believe that about five percent of injections are dangerous

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.400
and therefore

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.960
When you do so again now where you can hear it very clearly there is no other danger other than the misapplication

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:14.080
Of intramuscular injection and some combination of or rather some proportion are always bad because we do it wrong

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.360
And previously 30 seconds ago. He said we need new technologies to deliver vaccines

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.880
So is he questioning vaccines at all is he questioning the vaccine schedule in america versus other places

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:33.200
Is he questioning any of these disparities in terms of applying more and more of these vaccines to old people?

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:39.760
Is he zeroing in on any of the subtleties of this this, you know model that he has in his head?

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.400
absolutely not

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.600
Because he is 100 percent a medler

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:49.360
He is 100 percent working for them whoever they are

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.480
And generally speaking that is weaponized piles of money that are trying to control

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.520
Demolish the united states and have us do it for them

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:04.320
Math when you start I have in the book. I don't know if you it can show but fundamentally, you know, I

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.880
The more you vaccinate the less test of staying healthy you are and there's a point to which

01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:17.760
The entire population and notably the young because they've been vaccinated much more than we have

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.000
Much more

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.120
And so he is really trying to explain away all vaccine injury by the misapplication of intramuscular injection

01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:33.760
And the more shots you get the more likely it is that you're going to get unlucky and get an intramuscular injection that goes wrong

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:40.000
It has nothing to do with the untested combination of substances being injected into your body

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:43.120
Behind the barriers that your immune system

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.240
protects

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:52.800
And trying to usefully augment a sacred irreducible complexity that they don't have the knowledge

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:55.440
to usefully augment

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.400
My voice is starting to get tired so I might have to end it soon, but I hope you can see how awful this is

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.480
You do the simulation for example in the book. I have a simulation of

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.360
of the entire u.s. population

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.600
I did that really back of the envelope, but I end up with about 55 million people

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:25.360
with clinical injuries and about 190 million people with injury harmed by the vaccines

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.760
Right and and when you look at the ballpark figure, it's it's very it's very consistent with

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.840
the high

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.000
Level of disabled in the u.s. I think there's 64 million people

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.160
Who are disabled in the u.s. out of a population of 340 million

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:48.080
And one of my messages in the book at the end is is to say look we need to wake up

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.360
We need to awaken my conclusion is awake

01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:55.600
People we need to awaken to this because if we continue with us

01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:01.040
Then everybody's going to be sick and we're going to be in in in a in a civilization

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:04.880
Where you're going to have more people sick than actually healthy

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.840
and and for something as trivial

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.120
as as a poorly

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:18.400
Designed or flawed delivery protocol that's repeated billions of times. I've come from the automotive industry

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.200
In the automotive industry

01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.600
You know that if you if you you know if you have a problem on your car and you're

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:32.720
Automotive industry. I thought he worked for pharmaceutical companies on RNA vaccines for cancer. What is this shit?

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.960
And you sell 100 million cars. It's going to come back to haunt you

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:43.280
This is much worse than that. It is definitely a used car salesman at least from the perspective of a biologist

01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.760
He's a used car salesman. I don't know really what to say

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.360
Other than they are all lying about this graphic right here

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:52.000
They're all lying about what happened to New York and elsewhere

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:55.760
They're lying about whether those numbers are significant or not and they're not

01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.280
They're not significant and not for the reasons that they said

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.360
They instead are participating in a national security operation

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:08.400
Which is designed to invert our sovereignty to permissions and especially that of our children

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.120
We have to fight back against this in any way possible

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.200
And that includes exposing the people who are perpetuating these lies

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:20.240
They may not all be willingly participating. They may not all be wittingly participating

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:24.560
But most of these people on the screen are participating in hiding

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:30.800
the the the message of Byron brittle they are they are hiding the message of

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.600
Denny rancor they are hiding the message of

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:39.680
Of nick hudson and instead perpetuating the mythology of a dangerous novel virus for which

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:45.760
Transfection and transformation were briefly justified and likely came from gain of function and therefore will come again

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:50.640
That's why they have to ignore that they saw them in romani and didn't invite them

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:58.080
To share their insight at the senate but instead invited other people to come to the senate and instead

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:04.240
Invited the same people that have been speaking at these international covid summits for four years straight now

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.280
Saying the same thing

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:14.160
Very slowly titrating the left and the right the young and the old into accepting that there was a pandemic

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.560
It was a novel virus. It was probably released maybe on purpose

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:22.800
And it's got all these pieces that make people sick because they put them in there

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:28.960
And so we have to argue with the who or the who is going to take over the world

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.520
What I think that these people have effectively done is covered up the fact

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.320
That transfection and healthy humans was always criminally negligent and I certainly knew it

02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:48.000
And they are covering up the fact that we have figured out that RNA cannot pandemic the no virus stick didn't work on us

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.840
And the RNA virology is exactly as we said and more didn't work on us either

02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:03.520
And instead we have oscillated and and and studied and worked very hard to come to the conclusion

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.640
that they have lied about murder in order to

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.840
confound our understanding to the point where

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.240
Unwitting participants like doctors and nurses early on bought into it

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:18.080
And we have been sold books about it

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.760
And we have been been offered salaries to participate in writing these books

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.360
And uh all of these books do the same thing

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:36.160
And I do want to make one correction because this book

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:44.400
COVID-19 and the global predators is pretty close to spot on right there's a virus in here

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.320
There's bio-weapons in here

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:52.240
But they have that what this book does do very well is that it shows that they've been talking about this shit for a long time

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.640
And implying this threat for a long time and making plans

02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:01.920
To deal with the threat for a long time. And so I find it very curious in fact

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.480
that

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:10.800
For the last three or four years we were made to believe that the author of this book was suing the authors of this book because

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:17.120
The authors of this book said that this guy is misusing the term mass psychosis

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:26.320
And so we were supposed to believe that we weren't hearing anything from the breggans who have been speaking out against psychiatry and psychiatric medicine for decades

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.760
And we couldn't hear them because they were under pressure of this lawsuit from this guy

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:36.400
Who supposedly is the the whistleblower to to listen to

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:48.480
All about team worst case scenario, it's all about these medlers that

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.760
You know, you got to see them for what they are. They're all part of the same

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.480
Orchestrated theater

02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.720
Some of them didn't come in until act one or act two some of them were already on stage in the in the pre-show

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:07.520
Some of them were opening bands in 2017-18 and 19 on bros with shows podcasts

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:13.520
But anyway that they did it. This is how they did it. They declared a dangerous novel virus

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.520
But there may have already they may have characterized the background already

02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:24.880
They may have known what these tests would find. They also may know that the tests find nothing. It could be any way. It's a crime

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.400
I don't know what they did

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.480
I just know that what they said they did

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:35.120
Which is declared a dangerous pandemic and then responded poorly to it is an absolute lie and it's part of the stunt

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:37.520
the stunt script

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:42.960
It's very similar to the brochure version the spars pandemic the brochure version

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.280
James giordano's explanation but much more complicated because it involved

02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.760
Several coordinated liars on the internet ladies and gentlemen stop all

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.600
Transfections and humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.400
And uh, I think it's that song that I need to write have right there is that the right one except the right one

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.240
Yes, it is

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.200
Um, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. If you want to share this work

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.240
You can share it from giggle on biological.com. Can anybody confirm to me? Are we still in sync?

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:20.720
Have we figured this out? Thanks very much for joining me. Thanks for having the patience to be here right now

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.840
Um, perfect. Thank you very much pamela

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.000
Um, and uh, yeah, ladies and gentlemen, these are the people that support the stream

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.600
I will spend some time in the next couple of days updating this list

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.320
I need to work on my red pill expo

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.680
Presentation and I need to do some other things

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:45.040
Um for a consulting gig that I'm doing so it is possible that I won't be on tomorrow

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:48.400
There's nothing scheduled. It's also possible that I'll just randomly show up

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:50.880
Um, but I do need to do other things

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.080
Um, and that includes actual work to try and to try and make um some scratch

02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:58.640
Um to to complement or supplement

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:04.080
Um, the the wonderful support that I received from all those subscribers and the people that just

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:07.840
Send me money at my at my peel box. Thank you very much

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.600
To matt and eileen, I won't say anymore, but thank you very much

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.280
I

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:21.680
I really appreciate it and everybody else. Um, just thanks a lot and uh, I'll see you again probably sunday

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.400
But maybe tomorrow sunday for sure. Bye bye

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:33.440
It went blurry

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:38.400
Maybe I was just stepping in the wrong place. You see I can go back away from it. I don't get blurry. I don't know

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.960
It'll be all right. Um

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:43.360
I'll get in touch with molly james. I'll see what I can do

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:47.280
I
