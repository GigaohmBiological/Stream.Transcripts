00:09.164 --> 00:09.384
you you you

00:54.092 --> 01:05.037
I love the idea of protecting our brain and our thoughts like we do our physical eye, watching sharply for anything which might injure it and not letting even a speck of dust come near.

01:06.109 --> 01:09.831
what we hold most dear, what we see as sacred.

01:09.871 --> 01:11.731
I think this is really an important idea.

01:11.771 --> 01:17.594
I know that's not all that he's talking about there, but this applies to so much of what we're doing.

01:18.354 --> 01:24.377
And it is a really apt analogy for what social media tries to do with your brain.

01:24.757 --> 01:26.598
And the second cup of coffee is here.

01:26.658 --> 01:32.700
The reason why we are starting late is because my son and personal assistant,

01:34.355 --> 01:48.346
brought down a cup of coffee, and then I told him where to put it, and then within 30 seconds, I had punted it like a soccer ball, which was not... Not ideal.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.380
I thought this was so clever.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.223
I thought this was so clever.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.207
University of Pittsburgh didn't give a darn.

02:58.660 --> 02:59.400
Hello, Albert.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.201
Good to see you.

03:00.561 --> 03:04.483
We're going to watch a movie together with our friend Mark this morning just for fun.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.324
I've got a cup of coffee.

03:06.364 --> 03:08.285
You should get a cup of coffee if you need one.

03:08.986 --> 03:15.249
It's 1130 here in the Eastern time zone of America where we're trying to make things real again.

03:15.269 --> 03:19.551
I'm very happy to be online with Mark.

03:20.652 --> 03:22.573
It's been a long time since we've done a show together.

06:40.813 --> 06:42.813
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

06:42.833 --> 06:48.596
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

06:50.016 --> 06:51.717
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

06:53.353 --> 06:54.133
It's embarrassing.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.697
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:05.717 --> 07:11.819
It's 1131 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the 13th of October, 2024.

07:12.559 --> 07:20.082
We are here in our little hamster wheel, staying focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and loving our neighbors as best we can.

07:22.386 --> 07:27.393
I'm really excited to be here with my friend Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS.

07:28.554 --> 07:30.637
His first YouTube channel was cancelled.

07:30.657 --> 07:32.820
He has a Housatonic No.

07:32.840 --> 07:32.820
2.

07:33.561 --> 07:34.642
He's also on Rumble.

07:34.682 --> 07:35.824
He's also on BitChute.

07:35.844 --> 07:39.369
He's also archiving on our own Peertube channel.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.371
That's all really great.

07:41.411 --> 07:43.354
And we are fighting the same charlatans.

07:43.414 --> 07:58.432
It's actually Mark Kulak that I give a mountain of credit for, for opening my eyes to how far back the bench goes, if you will, back in time, the bench goes and how far back these charlatans go in terms of mentors.

07:59.393 --> 08:01.394
where these ideas have ultimately come from.

08:01.454 --> 08:15.998
And so in formulating my own response to this, I would like you to encourage your kids to learn the biology about intramuscular injection so that they understand that any combination of substances injected that way with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:16.658 --> 08:19.640
that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

08:19.660 --> 08:25.785
And most of their biology professors at school should have known an RNA cannot pandemic again.

08:25.845 --> 08:28.307
You know, maybe ask your biology professor about that.

08:29.488 --> 08:31.590
The mystery virus doesn't equal excess deaths.

08:31.630 --> 08:33.191
They expected these excess deaths.

08:33.231 --> 08:36.854
And in fact, they needed to use these excess deaths, makes excuses about them.

08:37.374 --> 08:41.177
Otherwise, they would have cost these Western nations a tremendous amount of money.

08:41.637 --> 08:45.900
Do you know why there was no evidence of spread of COVID in

08:47.241 --> 08:52.125
And in Africa, it's because they didn't have the age problem.

08:53.186 --> 08:57.429
And do you know why there are no lawyers that are really speaking and winning about this?

08:57.509 --> 09:00.231
Because they're making the wrong arguments.

09:01.277 --> 09:06.282
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, about transfection, and about RNA.

09:07.143 --> 09:20.016
And we need to break this illusion of consensus that we're trapped in by starting to ignore these people and stopping the skillful use of social media amongst our citizenry, amongst our friends, amongst our communities.

09:20.056 --> 09:20.997
It's all got to stop.

09:22.359 --> 09:29.646
or this new kind of totalitarianism will take root and our children will be enslaved by it.

09:29.826 --> 09:31.167
That's what I believe.

09:31.227 --> 09:32.588
That's what I think is really coming.

09:33.489 --> 09:41.116
And so if you want to help us fight against it, you've got to start teaching your kids to get off of social media, even Snapchat.

09:42.457 --> 09:52.122
and teach them that these weaponized piles of money use those military programs to get us to argue about stuff that benefits them and doesn't benefit us.

09:52.202 --> 10:01.227
And if we surrender to this model of quote-unquote free speech, the enslavement is all but assured.

10:02.796 --> 10:06.717
Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to a almost lifelong biologist.

10:06.978 --> 10:08.698
I didn't know what I wanted to be, a doctor.

10:08.758 --> 10:12.420
And then I taught high school for a while, trying to get into med school.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.842
And then I got into bench biology and I thought, oh my gosh, I found my dream job.

10:17.882 --> 10:20.943
And then for about 15 years, I chased it all around the world.

10:22.102 --> 10:30.690
and pictures like this are about all I've got left besides what's on NIH, National Library of Medicine, and the biology that I did learn.

10:31.911 --> 10:47.024
The skills that I did develop in terms of reading and understanding how the language in science is formulated in such a way that amongst scientists it's fine, but if you take that language and start

10:48.150 --> 10:58.574
and start taking it literally, it becomes a very big world of exaggeration and overstatement.

10:59.655 --> 11:04.877
Because it's okay to do that in a grant application, it's not okay to do that on TV, and yet that's where we are.

11:05.898 --> 11:10.339
If you want to find the work that we are doing, stream.gigaohm.bio is a good place to look.

11:12.583 --> 11:22.086
And, uh, I'm not really sure what else to say other than we're gonna keep working as hard as we can to put out as much, you know, worthwhile content as possible.

11:22.126 --> 11:31.930
It's become clear to me, it's become clear to Mark, um, that, you know, I'm just gonna toot, toot Mark's own horn here, if, so to speak.

11:33.050 --> 11:41.333
Um, but, I would, I would go so far as to say, um, that... Why didn't that work?

11:42.614 --> 11:43.495
Is that not on?

11:46.700 --> 11:47.681
Let's see here.

11:47.721 --> 11:48.963
Why don't I have that right?

11:50.325 --> 11:54.671
Why isn't this... Where's my... What the?

11:54.911 --> 11:56.193
Oh, I switched to the wrong one.

11:56.213 --> 11:56.273
Duh!

12:00.481 --> 12:04.164
So I would go so far as to say, sorry that's not the camera, this is the camera.

12:04.644 --> 12:26.001
I would go so far as to say that Mark Kulak, if you look at Mark's website, Housatonic ITS, and you look at the database and the wiki or whatever you want to call it that he's made, the archive of work that he's done, the quality of research that he's done, his ability to go down a path for a while and then realize that maybe this isn't

12:26.661 --> 12:36.344
have fruitful path or maybe these people aren't who I'm supposed to look at or his ability to look at things that other people are looking at, you know, and seeing different things.

12:38.405 --> 12:41.906
Mark makes one of the best shows on the internet and nobody watches it.

12:43.187 --> 12:48.869
Mark makes one of has and maintains one of the best archives of objective

12:50.336 --> 13:15.542
newspaper articles organized in some useful way, you know, I don't understand how it is possible that someone can produce so much obviously quality work and then also, you know, an occasional podcast or a video and be such of high quality all by himself and nobody watches.

13:17.048 --> 13:29.255
And I don't understand what's going on, but I do have to tell you that between Mark and I, I think there's two very high quality programs and very high quality streams of information being produced.

13:29.756 --> 13:45.265
And if you are going to surrender your attention and your conscious thoughts to a screen, I think the independent bright web of Mark and I is at least a refuge in the grand scheme of an ocean of malevolence.

13:46.165 --> 14:12.070
um and so this morning what i was hoping to do was uh let me switch over here and here that should be me down there and then let me escape out of here and oh there he is finally a little bored sorry about that mark i had to do some kind of introduction um welcome to the show sir you gotta unmute i think i have

14:13.018 --> 14:13.238
Hmm.

14:13.659 --> 14:14.800
Oh, I got you.

14:14.820 --> 14:15.200
I hear you.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.001
I can hear you.

14:16.061 --> 14:16.421
I'm listening.

14:18.043 --> 14:18.523
I can hear you.

14:19.304 --> 14:20.966
I'm listening to you through the live stream.

14:21.546 --> 14:21.907
Oh, okay.

14:21.967 --> 14:22.247
I see.

14:25.570 --> 14:25.811
Okay.

14:26.972 --> 14:36.361
Um, did you know that the craftsmen who built the pyramids all had haircuts?

14:37.649 --> 14:38.509
Oh wow, nice.

14:39.110 --> 14:39.570
Nice.

14:39.970 --> 14:40.910
Wow, I didn't know that.

14:41.570 --> 14:59.336
I didn't know this, but Bill Barr's dad, as part of this How and Why book in the 1960s, taught America's schoolchildren that the, what they call that, the bowler, the bowl haircut was in.

15:02.441 --> 15:03.661
I think that's what they modeled.

15:04.122 --> 15:07.923
I think they modeled the Empire's helmets after that too.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.664
Like, wow.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.404
And this is funny.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.645
Was he the artist?

15:14.765 --> 15:16.605
Was he the artist or just a consultant?

15:18.646 --> 15:20.787
He was the editor and he was the writer.

15:21.507 --> 15:25.048
The illustrator was a Robert Doremus.

15:27.209 --> 15:30.910
And of course, all the,

15:31.977 --> 15:36.461
Chinese people who built the Great Wall look exactly the same.

15:37.161 --> 15:40.604
Every single guy had exactly the same haircut, beard.

15:40.624 --> 15:42.225
I mean, nobody can tell them apart.

15:42.386 --> 15:43.687
Nobody can tell them apart.

15:45.308 --> 15:46.709
Regardless of age.

15:46.809 --> 15:47.250
One guy was 18.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.130
The other one was 57.

15:50.392 --> 15:51.033
All look the same.

15:51.913 --> 15:52.174
Wow.

15:52.234 --> 15:55.456
I love this unintentional racism of the past.

15:55.556 --> 15:56.137
Yeah, uh-huh.

15:59.212 --> 16:05.193
He makes Dr. Seuss look very innocuous.

16:05.233 --> 16:06.893
Why don't you use the Zoom audio then?

16:12.835 --> 16:14.275
What kind of amateur hour is this?

16:14.835 --> 16:16.915
Have you never been on somebody's program before?

16:21.116 --> 16:22.997
Your audio is not coming through my Zoom.

16:23.697 --> 16:24.617
Oh, maybe I'm muted.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.327
Hold on a second.

16:26.347 --> 16:27.767
Let me get my boneheaded plate.

16:27.847 --> 16:29.128
Oh, no, my audio is fine.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.469
It looks like it's transmitting.

16:31.010 --> 16:31.570
I can see it.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.131
It's green.

16:33.211 --> 16:33.691
Can't hear you.

16:34.071 --> 16:34.432
Hello.

16:34.492 --> 16:35.032
Hello.

16:36.673 --> 16:37.454
You can't hear me.

16:38.234 --> 16:38.895
I can hear you.

16:41.236 --> 16:43.537
And through your Zoom, I'm only getting you through the Zoom.

16:45.078 --> 16:47.220
You want to start over and come back or something?

16:47.260 --> 16:47.540
I don't know.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.901
I can start the meeting over again.

16:51.132 --> 16:55.840
I can see the audio going green on my Zoom window, so I think I can hear you.

16:56.802 --> 16:59.567
And you should be able to, in theory, hear me.

17:04.163 --> 17:09.066
I hear you or your show audio through zoom is your audio.

17:09.366 --> 17:11.327
Oh, maybe I have the air.

17:11.387 --> 17:12.348
Hold on one second.

17:12.388 --> 17:13.949
We'll see if I can fix this.

17:14.209 --> 17:14.669
Let's see.

17:14.769 --> 17:17.751
Audio musicians sound for musicians off.

17:17.831 --> 17:18.472
How about that?

17:18.532 --> 17:19.432
How do you hear it now?

17:20.253 --> 17:23.174
Test one, two, nothing yet.

17:23.955 --> 17:24.555
Nothing yet.

17:27.377 --> 17:27.677
Wow.

17:27.717 --> 17:28.338
That's weird.

17:30.579 --> 17:30.679
Um,

17:35.356 --> 17:38.119
I think you should go out of the meeting and come back in.

17:38.759 --> 17:40.862
I think that's the most, because I can hear you through Zoom.

17:40.922 --> 17:45.666
All right.

17:45.786 --> 17:48.169
I'm going to come back in.

17:48.389 --> 17:48.609
Yep.

17:51.332 --> 17:53.754
I got to turn my camera off before it goes bananas.

17:59.458 --> 18:00.279
So let's see.

18:00.339 --> 18:02.762
I got this guy over here, right?

18:02.822 --> 18:05.064
Yeah, and I can get that ready to go.

18:06.105 --> 18:07.046
Was this a good movie?

18:07.106 --> 18:07.546
I doubt it.

18:09.168 --> 18:09.728
I doubt it.

18:10.950 --> 18:12.311
It's probably not a very good movie.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.275
And then I'll pause this.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.240
And then I will, um, did I pause that?

18:23.444 --> 18:24.125
Yes, I did.

18:25.746 --> 18:28.288
And then I can go back over here and there's Mark.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.509
Can you hear me now, sir?

18:31.170 --> 18:32.892
Test one, two test one, two.

18:34.893 --> 18:35.414
I see you.

18:35.654 --> 18:37.015
I saw it on the screen up there.

18:37.876 --> 18:39.997
No, I saw it on the thing back there.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.100
Wait, wait, wait.

18:43.941 --> 18:44.261
Try it.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.363
Test one, two test one, two.

18:46.783 --> 18:48.124
I see it on the screen back there.

18:52.788 --> 18:53.048
Darn.

18:53.919 --> 18:55.040
Why isn't that not working?

18:57.661 --> 18:58.081
Try it again.

18:58.502 --> 19:01.243
Test one, two, this is Jay, hello, hello.

19:01.904 --> 19:05.386
Okay, okay, now it works, yep, good.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.928
That was actually partially my fault.

19:11.029 --> 19:13.010
It's all good, I was just teasing you, you know.

19:13.470 --> 19:18.013
You haven't been in front of your desk in a little while.

19:18.033 --> 19:23.116
Did you have a good, it wasn't really a break, you were still posting video.

19:24.232 --> 19:30.255
Well, once you're on a streak of however many consecutive days, you might as well just keep going.

19:32.837 --> 19:35.859
And how many days am I at right now?

19:36.079 --> 19:36.419
I don't know.

19:36.899 --> 19:37.600
I've lost track.

19:38.580 --> 19:41.882
But let's try to go for 100 consecutive days of posting content.

19:41.902 --> 19:42.222
Why not?

19:42.702 --> 19:43.683
Wow.

19:44.103 --> 19:44.423
OK.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.745
I don't think that's going to be very challenging for you.

19:47.565 --> 19:50.447
Well, once you just get into a groove, you realize that.

19:51.206 --> 19:54.308
It's just, you can just click the camera at any time.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.290
There's just so much stuff to do.

19:57.411 --> 20:01.013
Even if it's just, there's just thousands of articles.

20:01.073 --> 20:06.897
There's thousands of things to read that, that most people don't even know exist that I don't, that I forget exists myself.

20:08.459 --> 20:18.486
So you just get comfortable to the point where you just, you just, yeah, you can just roll out of bed, you know, change your shirt and just turn on the camera and you just don't care after a while, you know?

20:19.416 --> 20:21.679
And I'm having a lot of fun with that.

20:21.699 --> 20:22.600
It was a very busy trip.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.341
It was a good trip.

20:26.084 --> 20:29.828
Good to have that time, you know, everyone together away from the house.

20:29.868 --> 20:30.969
But it's wonderful to be back.

20:33.138 --> 20:35.939
and I've watched a little bit of this Vax3.

20:35.959 --> 20:42.700
And by the way, I don't think anyone does the show production that you do for a single, for a single show.

20:42.720 --> 20:52.303
I mean, I have some tricks, some, you know, like my video covers set up and sometimes I'll play some music, which of course is, I have no permission to play whatsoever.

20:52.363 --> 20:56.684
And you put it together and it gives you illusion that it's more put together.

20:57.444 --> 20:58.464
But I don't have like,

20:59.272 --> 21:05.916
all of the repetitive reminders, the messages that you do on Upon a Startup.

21:08.737 --> 21:18.222
You forget after a while that you're just one person with a whole ecosystem of a family around you that you still need to balance and you're doing it.

21:21.183 --> 21:27.627
We don't exactly know how many people work for a lot of other shows, but as you've picked up every once in a while, you hear someone say that they have a staff

21:28.951 --> 21:30.072
You're like, staff?

21:31.012 --> 21:32.393
Other people have staffs?

21:33.473 --> 21:34.634
There's no staff here.

21:34.654 --> 21:41.097
I mean, sometimes your wife will help out or someone will help me with a task, but that's it.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.498
There's no staff here.

21:42.518 --> 21:55.104
I can't even imagine what a well-meaning, hardworking, independent person could do if they suddenly had a staff of, I don't know, five people or two people

21:56.420 --> 21:58.363
for a month or two.

21:58.403 --> 21:59.344
I couldn't even imagine.

21:59.965 --> 22:01.627
It would be so scary.

22:01.908 --> 22:02.388
Exactly.

22:02.989 --> 22:11.000
I said this the other day on social media, which I don't know why, it just dawned on me, but at a certain moment you have enough money

22:11.801 --> 22:13.902
to pay people to make money for you.

22:14.522 --> 22:30.647
And so if we even had just somebody whose day was spent trying to get more attention to our website, it would actually double our current output because we can't do it.

22:30.847 --> 22:31.907
We don't have time to do it.

22:32.707 --> 22:38.809
I mean, on the other hand, though, I have to say that I think that there is the possibility that

22:39.793 --> 22:40.762
this level of

22:42.142 --> 23:08.552
integrity that we are establishing with this track record of just getting online and being able to hold our own is in the long run going to set us apart in a way that a lot of these people cannot set themselves apart if they were chosen and given seed money or given an editor or given some social media coach or just a person to promote them on several other websites.

23:08.652 --> 23:09.613
I don't know how it is

23:10.273 --> 23:24.769
that someone can start a podcast and suddenly have their shorts on Instagram and Spotify audio only and this and that and it just appears every time they do it is not possible to do by yourself.

23:24.849 --> 23:25.550
It's just not.

23:27.012 --> 23:28.834
It's certainly not on a daily basis.

23:28.894 --> 23:30.376
And so I think

23:31.610 --> 23:47.545
In a way, the switch to, we're just gonna produce as often as possible and screw all the marketing and screw all the editing and screw all the, I mean, you do really nice thumbnails, but I think you've been doing so many of them, you're just getting really good at it.

23:47.565 --> 23:49.126
You just get into a habit.

23:49.166 --> 23:52.810
You pick a couple of pictures, you throw one at an angle, right?

23:52.830 --> 23:57.434
You have a standard font, you use the Google Slides to change the color tones, and that's it.

23:58.550 --> 24:00.612
And sometimes you don't even know what it is.

24:02.134 --> 24:04.356
I don't even have show titles sometimes when I start.

24:04.676 --> 24:05.257
You know how it is.

24:05.677 --> 24:14.146
You want to start making a show about one idea, and then it morphs into something else because there's something that you really wanted to talk about, but you don't even know that until you start.

24:14.987 --> 24:18.090
So you just roll with it, and then you have an archive.

24:21.647 --> 24:26.030
I mean, right now I have a couple word files that I use as a bench.

24:26.231 --> 24:30.194
In other words, like you get there and you're like, oh, wow, that's another show, but I can't do that now.

24:30.274 --> 24:31.915
Otherwise I won't finish what I'm working on.

24:32.516 --> 24:39.522
So I throw that over into that word file and that word file is almost never opened because I don't have time to go backwards.

24:39.662 --> 24:40.342
It's crazy.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.255
I just find where we are almost absurd at this point.

24:47.276 --> 24:55.421
And I know that you also probably saw it because I made you watch it yesterday with this musical from Mickey Willis.

24:55.482 --> 25:04.267
But these kinds of things now really feel awful because it shouldn't be where we are five years after a

25:05.268 --> 25:10.950
fake crisis that these people at the same time are willing to characterize as an attack and a lies.

25:11.650 --> 25:26.574
But then they're able to make fun of it and make light of it and then also horribly misrepresent the bouquet of evil that was done with a musical that just made it about masks and multiculturalism.

25:26.614 --> 25:28.435
It was so bizarre to me.

25:30.578 --> 25:37.968
And so I don't have any high hopes for Vaxxed, but yeah, it's just... Yeah, the musical, it's gross.

25:39.551 --> 25:42.314
It's not really... I'm not surprised by anything in it, though.

25:43.076 --> 25:44.758
It's almost what I would have expected.

25:45.519 --> 25:46.460
No confessions.

25:50.265 --> 25:51.767
It's I don't have the words for it.

25:52.007 --> 25:54.309
No, it's it's exactly what I would have expected.

25:54.429 --> 26:06.180
And we can see how stubborn they are to not talk about or even just spend a few minutes on something other than masks and depopulation.

26:06.841 --> 26:08.542
And there's an unwillingness to do that.

26:08.782 --> 26:09.163
And so

26:11.067 --> 26:11.407
at all.

26:29.281 --> 26:35.506
but several hundred thousand dollars plus the promotions and effort for that to talk about masks.

26:36.286 --> 26:37.708
Masks were the least of the issue.

26:38.168 --> 26:39.829
And I texted you this earlier, Jay.

26:39.929 --> 26:42.711
I don't even think masks were meant to be part of the operation.

26:43.752 --> 26:45.654
I think that it was something in the background.

26:46.635 --> 26:56.883
And I think that the Nationalist Party of China screwed over the system by suddenly having people stop dying.

26:57.694 --> 26:59.137
and they suggested it was masks.

27:00.138 --> 27:06.529
I think that was the first big, you know, 28 pound monkey wrench and no one knew what to do with it.

27:06.649 --> 27:08.853
That, you know, masks were never meant to be part of the story.

27:09.741 --> 27:14.202
And then suddenly you had to have people come up and you're like, well, maybe it didn't start in a cave.

27:14.282 --> 27:17.942
Maybe it started in the United States and went to China.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.503
Maybe it's this, maybe it's that.

27:19.523 --> 27:21.003
They were coming up with all these stories.

27:21.583 --> 27:25.324
We should make the focus triple masking, quadruple masking, no masking.

27:25.704 --> 27:26.804
It was so stupid.

27:27.244 --> 27:35.846
I will actually give them the benefit of the doubt, okay, that they couldn't have possibly expected something that stupid to be the anchor of all the arguments.

27:35.926 --> 27:37.666
But that's, I think, how it started.

27:38.246 --> 27:38.406
What?

27:38.466 --> 27:39.367
How else do you explain it?

27:39.407 --> 27:39.888
China?

27:39.928 --> 27:40.308
That's it.

27:40.348 --> 27:41.289
No more people dying.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.071
So I got to show.

27:44.092 --> 27:46.374
Do you really think that that's what their story was going to be?

27:46.734 --> 27:47.034
That's it.

27:47.074 --> 27:47.975
No more people dying.

27:48.396 --> 27:48.716
That's it.

27:49.218 --> 27:54.120
I got to read you something that somebody sent me in a photocopy from their grandmother's diary.

27:54.180 --> 28:03.764
And it is about the Spanish flu, because I really, I know that you're a very big enthusiast of this history and how the numbers have continued to increase over time.

28:05.144 --> 28:11.247
And I think it's possible, honestly, that cloth, cotton,

28:12.501 --> 28:21.105
moist masks could actually be dangerous to wear for hours and hours on end, especially if you don't wash them, and especially if you already are sick.

28:21.866 --> 28:26.408
And so I'm not suggesting that, I just think it's very interesting.

28:26.448 --> 28:28.609
So let me see if I can put this over.

28:28.709 --> 28:29.870
No, that's not the right one.

28:29.890 --> 28:37.494
Before you even say that, sometimes we have, there's a lot of mosquitoes in this area of New England, especially during the high season.

28:37.534 --> 28:40.716
So I'll actually wear some head netting if I'm doing a lot of work outside.

28:41.676 --> 28:44.202
And just, I mean, head netting is not a mask, right?

28:44.222 --> 28:47.469
It's just meant to keep mosquitoes out of your face.

28:48.999 --> 29:02.466
And just that alone, okay, if I wear it for a few hours, I can actually, it actually starts to feel like my body's telling me that it's not safe to keep it on anymore.

29:02.486 --> 29:04.788
Like I've been breathing through it too long.

29:04.808 --> 29:08.750
These people don't wear bee suits, you know, for 10 hour shifts.

29:09.090 --> 29:15.393
Even though, you know, it's not like, they're not N95 masks, but even just that, your body tells you, it's like, you start to feel icky.

29:15.513 --> 29:18.375
Like you're breathing in something that's distasteful, your body's telling you.

29:18.915 --> 29:21.056
Take off the freaking shield, man.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.376
You know, breathe some fresh air.

29:22.936 --> 29:40.080
No, that's why I'm saying it, and that's why I'm bringing it up, because this leads me to this other idea, and I know you're very familiar with it, but if you're wearing a mask all day and then you're using this as a way of evaluating, and that would be a pulse oximeter,

29:40.740 --> 29:49.265
If you're using a pulse oximeter to evaluate your health while you're wearing a mask all day, I can see that as being a very, very quick recipe for, I better go to the hospital.

29:50.686 --> 29:52.207
Um, and that frightens me a lot.

29:52.227 --> 29:53.747
So this diary is really interesting.

29:53.787 --> 30:00.230
It says, um, it turned much cooler and has snowed a bit for the last three days.

30:00.550 --> 30:04.792
It reminds me of the first armistice day, November 11th, 1918, everybody going outside.

30:04.812 --> 30:06.193
I had to wear masks over.

30:11.275 --> 30:40.291
their nose and mouth like this and she draws a picture with white it says there and then little these these behind the ears it ties behind the ears it says um i've even put one on our dog and it was a day like this cold i was about 11 years old the mask was supposed to prevent spanish influenza but we all got it and thousands died with it

30:43.507 --> 30:54.626
so and so i think that's a person was buried in the today and the weather was so anyway that's the end of the little thing the weather was much like today anyway it's funny because

30:56.465 --> 30:59.708
They all got the flu and many thousands died of it.

30:59.728 --> 31:04.652
I think she probably means from the perspective of the newspaper, thousands have died from it.

31:04.672 --> 31:07.534
I don't think she means like she knew thousands of people.

31:08.095 --> 31:15.341
But anyway, it's just interesting because I really think that the masks are in any scenario, probably a bad idea.

31:15.561 --> 31:17.783
And I don't know if it's...

31:20.270 --> 31:31.055
I mean, I think also from the perspective of, you know, this is going to sound weird, but I had a CHD, I met someone at the CHD thing in,

31:33.391 --> 31:34.092
in Georgia.

31:34.312 --> 31:40.136
And she was this one of these two ladies that had gone on stage with the big green suit that was all blown up.

31:40.216 --> 31:46.862
I don't know if you saw those ladies, but they were environmental workplace OSHA kind of people.

31:47.722 --> 31:54.248
And, you know, so they were masters of masks and masters of protecting people from chemicals at the workplace and whatever.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.529
And they came on to tell

31:56.129 --> 32:06.234
how there are all these regulations about how long you can wear an N95 mask and why you can't wear it longer and why it needs to be changed and why they have all these regulations.

32:06.294 --> 32:15.159
And so it strikes me as somewhat interesting that there are professionals out there who I've heard testify about the

32:15.979 --> 32:32.045
the health hazard that masks represent and how well we know about it based on the fact that there are professional painters and auto mechanics and all these other people who need to wear respiratory protection at different times, and they're all warned about the potential hazards of long-term use of these things.

32:32.085 --> 32:37.187
So to me, it is... Oh, go ahead.

32:40.239 --> 32:50.586
We're not, we didn't evolve to need to wear masks, you know, and other non-breathable protective clothing.

32:51.647 --> 33:07.138
Now, if you were working with something that was very acidic or, you know, a really bad chemical, if you had to wear really thick gloves, right, protect your hands and your wrists or whatever, you're better off wearing the gloves than working directly with battery acid.

33:07.978 --> 33:14.922
But that said, if you had those gloves on for 12 hours and you don't breathe out of your hands, your hands are gonna be disgusting.

33:15.002 --> 33:17.244
Your skin is gonna be wrinkled up.

33:17.644 --> 33:19.445
You could actually get infections.

33:20.306 --> 33:25.869
You are not designed to wear non-breathable clothing or especially non-ventilated masking.

33:26.190 --> 33:31.453
But in certain conditions, it's better than the alternative in a short period of time.

33:32.173 --> 33:53.538
If you were working on a ship in the 1918 filled with animals that were probably sick, and if you needed to go into the non-ventilated area and feed them, you're probably better off wearing a mask, you know, for an hour with all these animals, 20%, which would probably die of a bacterial infection, pneumonia, than you are just walking around there without a mask.

33:54.239 --> 33:58.620
So everything, it's like, you know, everything has a benefit and a cost.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.560
You have to weigh the two.

34:00.660 --> 34:02.800
This is every single thing in life.

34:02.940 --> 34:20.623
And just this thought that you should just wear a mask all day long, regardless, is as stupid as, I don't know, it's like, you know, putting a baby in a bulletproof vest and just having, they have to stay in it till they die, or I don't know, these are just, these are stupid things.

34:20.663 --> 34:24.504
You have to weigh off the benefits and the costs of every one of these things.

34:24.604 --> 34:28.905
And the, I wonder, I never looked into this, but,

34:29.761 --> 34:39.705
chemical warfare was a big consideration in the World War I. I wonder what the conditions of those breathable masks were, of how those things were designed.

34:41.626 --> 34:52.431
If those actually created situations where either horses or people, they actually have pictures of horses wearing those gas masks for World War I. If you wear those long enough, that can cause any

34:53.869 --> 34:57.191
or to the mounts that were using them, bacterial infections.

34:57.211 --> 34:58.091
I never looked into that.

34:58.111 --> 34:59.652
I never thought about that possibility.

34:59.692 --> 35:08.835
But yeah, and you don't let, as you showed that apocalyptic movie, you don't let a catastrophe go to waste.

35:09.676 --> 35:14.838
You don't let a hurricane happen without giving people the idea that maybe the government can steer the weather.

35:17.159 --> 35:20.180
It's a horrible hurricane and people, instead of being like, wow,

35:21.547 --> 35:28.614
you know, these are one of the costs of living in Florida and maybe we should, you know, change zoning laws so people don't live within 10 feet of flood zones or something like that.

35:28.654 --> 35:36.622
People are like, well, I guess the government can control the weather, create nukes, have gain of function viruses and artificial intelligence.

35:36.682 --> 35:45.070
Let's just add to the fear pile instead of having a rational conversation about the fact that, you know, there's some areas that have some pretty harsh weather and some areas that don't.

35:46.030 --> 35:48.051
It's it's exactly the same thing.

35:48.111 --> 35:55.052
It drives me it drives me bananas so and anyways Vax three, baby.

35:55.632 --> 35:56.553
Yeah, Vax three.

35:56.613 --> 36:00.154
I'll hit play and you know, we'll see what happens We don't have to watch the whole thing.

36:00.314 --> 36:03.974
I have a hard stop at like What is it 12 now?

36:04.014 --> 36:09.256
I have a hard stop at like 12 or 130 I don't know how long you got but I mean we don't have to watch the whole thing.

36:09.536 --> 36:13.177
Just go here here here here

36:14.950 --> 36:18.413
And I got the chat over here so I can respond to some chat messages.

36:18.433 --> 36:19.374
Nice, nice, nice.

36:19.675 --> 36:20.215
While it's going.

36:22.617 --> 36:23.879
And where is this?

36:30.044 --> 36:35.229
And so what I find already striking is that they didn't start with the fact that we told you in Vaxxed One.

36:36.161 --> 36:40.922
We warned you in Vaxxed 2, and now here is Vaxxed 3.

36:41.062 --> 36:42.303
You know, like they could have done it.

36:42.323 --> 36:43.443
They got the water here.

36:43.583 --> 36:45.224
There's no shark theme, but.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.225
Now, that's an interesting thing to start with.

36:53.886 --> 36:56.527
They don't really tell you what those protocols are that kill them.

36:59.248 --> 36:59.868
They mislead.

37:00.088 --> 37:01.128
They won't say oxygen.

37:01.428 --> 37:01.988
No.

37:02.188 --> 37:04.109
I think they do say vents, not to be a, not,

37:04.873 --> 37:08.554
not to give out spoilers, but I think they say vents, but they'll never say oxygen.

37:08.974 --> 37:10.815
But the vents are not the answer.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.015
We've already figured that out.

37:12.075 --> 37:13.356
That's definitely not the answer.

37:13.376 --> 37:14.196
Correct.

37:14.216 --> 37:15.356
Oh, maybe the volume's not up.

37:15.416 --> 37:15.656
Sorry.

37:15.676 --> 37:15.836
My bad.

37:15.896 --> 37:18.577
New cases from entering our shores.

37:18.617 --> 37:18.837
Thanks.

37:19.537 --> 37:23.759
We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.088
120,000 known cases in 114 countries.

37:31.128 --> 37:34.229
And things will get worse than they are right now.

37:34.249 --> 37:36.010
We are in a national emergency.

37:36.370 --> 37:37.130
Back to normal.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.130
That's what people want to know.

37:38.170 --> 37:38.751
When does that happen?

37:38.771 --> 37:43.852
The only thing that will really allow life as we once knew it to resume is a vaccine.

37:43.992 --> 37:45.693
This will be the new normal.

37:46.411 --> 37:48.113
until a vaccine is developed.

37:48.433 --> 37:53.979
You have to get about 70 to 85 percent of the population vaccinated.

37:54.139 --> 38:01.467
If you get that many people vaccinated, you will have what we call an umbrella or a blanket of herd immunity.

38:01.527 --> 38:04.890
That means the vaccines will get us to

38:06.041 --> 38:08.243
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait what?

38:36.994 --> 38:40.156
Hold on a second, I couldn't find the space bar.

38:41.217 --> 38:42.258
Shit.

38:42.958 --> 38:44.119
What did you miss?

38:44.239 --> 38:46.461
I was just typing the paper.

38:46.761 --> 38:50.723
Number 159, Andrew Holland Kaufman.

38:52.285 --> 38:52.625
Okay.

38:53.666 --> 38:54.766
Interesting name there.

38:57.048 --> 38:58.549
Andrew Holland Kaufman.

39:01.411 --> 39:05.054
That is a tremendous weird name to me, but okay, whatever, I'm sorry.

39:05.114 --> 39:07.276
I just, I had to, I couldn't believe I saw it.

39:07.316 --> 39:07.536
I'm mad.

39:07.556 --> 39:11.399
The absurdity of what we live through is, it's just, it's really unfathomable to me.

39:11.419 --> 39:11.899
The world went mad.

39:11.919 --> 39:13.500
They went completely mad, but they weren't mad.

39:28.812 --> 39:31.713
because of unrelenting... Corey is the second person?

39:31.733 --> 39:37.854
Yeah, he was about to say, the second person they slapped on the screen is Corey in his tan glory.

39:37.914 --> 39:38.914
That's really amazing.

39:39.674 --> 39:40.775
None of it made any sense.

39:41.035 --> 39:47.876
Children playing instruments inside tents, wearing masks, and they're blowing into horns.

39:47.936 --> 39:51.517
Like, you go to a restaurant, you wear a mask, you take it off, and you eat and you breathe.

39:52.517 --> 39:53.677
None of it made sense.

39:54.137 --> 39:55.978
A lot of this started with fear, right?

39:56.018 --> 39:56.678
That's how...

39:57.856 --> 39:58.696
So this I have.

39:59.257 --> 40:00.357
And I was frankly shocked.

40:00.437 --> 40:06.780
This I have a problem with too, because I think that this person shouldn't be the lawyer that's doing it.

40:06.820 --> 40:09.962
That should be like Rolf Hazlehurst or somebody.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.923
She's like relatively new, Kim.

40:12.983 --> 40:16.065
I don't even, yeah, anyway, I think it's sketch.

40:16.905 --> 40:23.449
And they wore the masks and they stood six feet apart and they stayed locked down in their house and they took the shot.

40:26.810 --> 40:28.431
That was easy.

40:29.992 --> 40:34.716
Friends star Jennifer Aniston is cutting ties with people in her life who are unvaccinated.

40:34.996 --> 40:37.798
We have to stop coddling the moron.

40:37.878 --> 40:38.999
That guy's awesome.

40:39.039 --> 40:39.799
Get the shot.

40:39.839 --> 40:40.980
He makes me happy.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.161
He's so hilarious.

40:42.301 --> 40:43.682
Oh, my gosh.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.164
You now it's mandatory to get vaccinated.

40:47.124 --> 40:47.725
Their freedom.

40:47.905 --> 40:49.086
I want my freedom to live.

40:49.286 --> 40:55.210
They are all snowflakes and idiots.

40:55.939 --> 40:57.381
It's just hilarious to me.

40:57.401 --> 41:03.607
I just want to say to all of you cowards out there, don't be such a chicken squat.

41:03.707 --> 41:07.972
If you're willing to walk among us unvaccinated, you are an enemy.

41:08.132 --> 41:18.483
The persecution worked and people that I knew that I thought would never get a vaccine ended up getting a COVID shot.

41:18.723 --> 41:25.065
Those of us who got the vaccine, we know, you know, look, now I can stand here with my mask off and have this conversation with you.

41:25.445 --> 41:27.606
A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.

41:27.926 --> 41:31.387
Vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick.

41:31.487 --> 41:32.807
We get to herd immunity.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.688
I mean, the important thing to notice here is that these are all old hits, right?

41:36.728 --> 41:39.549
This video could have been made in 2022.

41:39.909 --> 41:42.930
This is not like... Not by letting everybody get infected.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.831
People are believing the information that they're being fed.

41:45.851 --> 41:46.771
They're not questioning.

41:47.051 --> 41:49.692
They're trusting the sources where it's coming from.

41:49.992 --> 41:51.873
And those sources are not to be trusted.

41:52.413 --> 41:55.914
And he's the president emeritus of FLCCC.

41:56.334 --> 41:57.755
I mean, I don't like to make fun of people.

41:57.795 --> 42:05.097
Doesn't it look like someone is rolling him up from the feet and the blood is just getting closer and closer to the skull?

42:05.497 --> 42:06.478
I think he's just tan.

42:06.798 --> 42:10.179
It's just like a Willy Wonka character.

42:11.322 --> 42:32.412
uh it to me it's just really yeah i don't i don't i don't understand it i don't wow it's it's mind-blowing to me prior to covid and so what i was going to say was is that he is the professor president emeritus used to be the president of flccc we found out a year and a half ago that he was taking a quarter million dollars a year from that organization as a salary

42:33.272 --> 42:46.377
And that organization is the one that published the protocol at the beginning of the pandemic that included seeking help at a hospital if you had a pulse ox lower than, I believe, 96, but it might've been 94.

42:46.977 --> 42:48.978
And whatever, that's crazy.

42:49.578 --> 42:59.782
And that's the same guy who said that we're running out of oxygen and people's pulse ox is below 80 and it's everybody in the hospital, even though he didn't arrive in New York until the peak was over.

43:01.186 --> 43:03.008
Anyway, I'll just... Those sources.

43:03.088 --> 43:07.430
It's a shorter list to tell you what was true than, you know, to tell you about all the lies.

43:07.591 --> 43:15.876
Everything was a lie about the vaccine, about the masks, about the tests, about the lockdowns, about school closures, about the safety, about the efficacy.

43:16.416 --> 43:21.399
The government was lying, the media was lying, and they're still lying.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.222
They're telling us the unvaccinated are dying in hospital.

43:25.402 --> 43:28.164
They're telling us the unvaccinated are spreading this disease.

43:28.404 --> 43:29.825
Everything we were told was a lie.

43:30.353 --> 43:32.375
There were so many lives during COVID.

43:32.395 --> 43:35.638
It was just wave after wave after wave.

43:36.379 --> 43:37.740
All these things that don't add up.

43:38.221 --> 43:40.082
So there's only one thing left for us to do.

43:40.363 --> 43:45.428
We need to get a bus and get back out on the road and find out for ourselves what is going on.

43:45.808 --> 43:47.750
Because only the people will tell us the truth.

43:47.830 --> 43:49.732
We knew that from the last bus.

43:50.212 --> 43:51.554
So it was time to get back out again.

43:52.816 --> 43:55.717
So on the first bus, we started to sign the names.

43:56.057 --> 44:00.318
We were honoring the people that had been injured or killed by vaccinations.

44:00.358 --> 44:03.599
And these were approved vaccinations on the first tour.

44:03.919 --> 44:06.980
So we'd sign the names on the bus and it would fill the bus up.

44:07.100 --> 44:10.381
I think that bus had been incredibly- So they didn't mention the movie.

44:10.401 --> 44:13.382
They just mentioned the bus, which is also really weird.

44:14.002 --> 44:15.322
I didn't know there was a second bus.

44:15.882 --> 44:16.863
That was a first bus.

44:16.923 --> 44:17.943
This is the second bus.

44:18.362 --> 44:20.804
Yeah, I didn't know they had more than one bus.

44:20.884 --> 44:25.746
I was wondering how they managed the real estate on the bus.

44:25.787 --> 44:27.768
I mean, it's the first bus.

44:27.868 --> 44:39.995
I mean, it was it was a incredibly powerful tribute and something to as part of an exhibition to show, right, or exhibit.

44:40.295 --> 44:41.196
It was very powerful.

44:41.516 --> 44:42.737
But and I always wondered, like, well,

44:43.820 --> 44:45.622
I thought the first one was just about filling up.

44:46.343 --> 44:49.727
And I don't know if they had rules about where to write things on the second bus.

44:49.747 --> 44:51.008
I didn't know there was a second bus.

44:51.329 --> 44:53.131
Did they say when they introduced that?

44:54.475 --> 45:00.822
Um, no, I think they're talking about the first bus from Vaxxed and then this is the second bus that they did for COVID.

45:00.922 --> 45:07.129
So they got a new bus for this movie to redo the bus theme from the first movie.

45:07.809 --> 45:08.750
I think that's what they mean.

45:08.770 --> 45:13.616
Important in uncovering the extent of vaccine injury.

45:14.881 --> 45:18.044
So we went to children's health events and said, we need.

45:18.104 --> 45:30.215
See, I just, I'm sorry, but I find this very disappointing because again, this is their time to shine, to say that we've been fighting the previous vaccine schedule because we know that that's already a problem.

45:30.635 --> 45:34.679
And this is a new one, but they're, they're so inept at, at, at.

45:35.856 --> 45:40.637
had accurately portraying what they claim is their legacy of fighting this.

45:40.757 --> 45:47.599
I just, I'm, I am not, I'm no longer thinking that this can be done just because they're not very good at it.

45:47.639 --> 45:56.421
This is the same as the not nearly sharp enough Aaron Seery complaint list that we looked at yesterday.

45:56.481 --> 46:01.762
I feel like you're just missing a huge opportunity, especially five years after the door opened.

46:03.482 --> 46:04.602
And they said yes.

46:05.023 --> 46:06.343
See the bus for the first time.

46:06.363 --> 46:08.124
There it is!

46:08.204 --> 46:10.384
There she is.

46:14.406 --> 46:17.847
Still not really teaching anybody anything yet.

46:17.867 --> 46:20.468
We managed to fund the bus and we're able to get out on the road.

46:20.848 --> 46:24.289
I must add, in much more style than the last bus.

46:24.569 --> 46:27.330
Are we live?

46:28.445 --> 46:29.146
Excellent.

46:29.546 --> 46:33.689
We're live here in Houston, Texas, with a huge announcement.

46:33.749 --> 46:34.969
It's a long awaited.

46:35.029 --> 46:37.291
So much hard work behind the scenes to make this happen.

46:37.851 --> 46:42.234
So we here at Children's Health Defense are going to go back out on the road.

46:42.314 --> 46:47.038
In September, we are going to push on through and speak to every single one of you.

46:47.358 --> 46:48.198
What have you been through?

46:48.218 --> 46:50.400
We are Children's Health Defense.

46:50.680 --> 46:56.524
What have your children been through, through COVID, through all of the issues that we've had over these last few years?

46:56.664 --> 46:58.265
We want to hear all of your stories.

47:00.506 --> 47:03.987
So the first thing we did was we turned up at an event.

47:04.307 --> 47:05.968
And it wasn't the beginning of the tour.

47:06.548 --> 47:08.829
It was just a little surprise visit.

47:09.069 --> 47:10.710
We are live at a secret location.

47:10.770 --> 47:12.151
I cannot tell you where we are.

47:12.211 --> 47:15.912
There were droves of vaccine injured.

47:15.932 --> 47:23.215
So that's when I was thinking, OK, we really are going to go out there and hear just tons of COVID or vaccination injuries and death.

47:24.416 --> 47:27.297
You are now going to see who is going to be our number one.

47:27.357 --> 47:27.797
Come on in.

47:28.996 --> 47:29.977
Tell everyone who you are.

47:30.037 --> 47:31.377
My name is Ernest Ramirez.

47:32.218 --> 47:34.199
I'm the father of Ernesto Ramirez Jr.

47:34.879 --> 47:36.580
And I'm honored to be here with you, Polly.

47:36.700 --> 47:37.260
We're thrilled.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.342
Children's Health Defense unanimously chose you.

47:40.362 --> 47:42.123
You're brave in the way you speak out about your son.

47:42.143 --> 47:43.223
Tell everybody briefly.

47:43.243 --> 47:45.604
We do know your story, but there may be some watching that do not.

47:45.844 --> 47:46.965
What happened to your son?

47:47.365 --> 47:50.347
Well, being a single parent, I was concerned with the COVID.

47:50.847 --> 47:53.768
And they lied to us, said it was safe and effective.

47:54.589 --> 47:56.550
So we went to get the vaccine.

47:57.150 --> 47:58.551
And five days later,

47:59.964 --> 48:05.405
After his first dose of Pfizer, he died suddenly.

48:05.665 --> 48:06.605
He just collapsed.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.026
And the government denies it.

48:09.306 --> 48:12.706
Everyone, no one wants to admit to the wrongdoing.

48:13.146 --> 48:16.287
And it just, I was upset.

48:16.387 --> 48:17.247
I got suicidal.

48:17.647 --> 48:20.688
The good Lord put me in this path to try to protect other children.

48:20.708 --> 48:22.808
So I do this to honor my son.

48:23.508 --> 48:26.328
And I know he'd want me to protect other kids.

48:29.625 --> 48:33.190
But that's the reason I do this.

48:33.210 --> 48:34.412
We have to protect one another.

48:34.933 --> 48:35.554
Yes, we do.

48:36.335 --> 48:40.881
Would you sign your son's name as number one, please, on the Children's Health Defense bus?

48:54.363 --> 49:00.546
We filled it up quite a few, I mean, 2025, just from that small visit of COVID deaths and injuries.

49:01.146 --> 49:10.290
We went back, we got the bus ready, and we were- Did she say COVID deaths and injuries, or did she say, it didn't sound like she said vaccines, and this is starting to annoy me.

49:11.211 --> 49:13.171
COVID deaths and injuries.

49:13.231 --> 49:13.492
See?

49:14.012 --> 49:19.414
Yeah, and I mean, I know you aren't, and I'm not questioning.

49:20.735 --> 49:22.936
I mean, we have no reason to, of course, question the

49:24.138 --> 49:25.679
chronological timeline of that.

49:25.759 --> 49:45.327
He took that vaccine, he died, the son did, but, and I'm sure, I have no reason to doubt that there's a causal relationship there, but are we talking about the fact that the vaccine was bad or why did he take it in the first place?

49:45.827 --> 49:46.868
Was it even necessary?

49:47.912 --> 49:49.494
That's such a huge part of it here.

49:51.095 --> 49:52.497
Was it necessary?

49:52.637 --> 50:07.111
Yeah, because the lie is not just that they said that it was safe, but that it was necessary, that they had a coordinated group effort to make sure that we thought it was necessary, to make sure that Ernesto was scared enough to think that he had to give it to his kid.

50:07.391 --> 50:07.892
Absolutely.

50:08.633 --> 50:08.773
Yeah.

50:10.464 --> 50:13.526
And they murdered people in America in order to create that illusion.

50:13.566 --> 50:15.928
I guess they probably murdered people in a lot of places.

50:15.988 --> 50:21.032
I know they murdered my father-in-law just by saying they didn't have enough people in the fricking hospitals to take care of him.

50:21.092 --> 50:28.198
But they did this all over the world where they had these, you know, inconvenient old people, I guess.

50:28.238 --> 50:30.860
I mean, I'm just, I'm shocked right now that,

50:31.724 --> 50:33.865
that, well, I'm not either.

50:34.005 --> 50:35.686
I didn't put that together.

50:35.886 --> 50:40.689
It was my father-in-law, who was actually my wife's stepdad.

50:41.149 --> 50:41.690
He died.

50:42.230 --> 50:43.811
Now, he wasn't young.

50:43.891 --> 50:45.852
He was 81.

50:47.773 --> 50:50.555
But he was reasonably healthy.

50:51.635 --> 50:57.659
And then after a year of taking those shots, his health had rapidly deteriorated.

50:58.892 --> 51:18.785
I think that there was a causal connection there, but again, you can't just say, well, everything would be great otherwise, but I suspect that he would have had a few more years to be there with his wife if it wasn't for that, and he didn't even need to take those in the first place.

51:19.853 --> 51:39.449
so a lot of these stories and injuries we went back we got the bus ready and we were ready to go we set the tour we had it all figured out where we're gonna go and we officially launched so everybody we will be live on chd.tv sign up for the bus alerts and we'll be going live tomorrow with stories we're on the road we're going out

52:05.967 --> 52:14.072
Think about how powerful it would have been if that big sign said COVID transfections injure and kill people instead of COVID vaccines.

52:14.753 --> 52:17.814
I mean, so many opportunities missed.

52:19.375 --> 52:20.996
Well, most people would have said, what's that?

52:21.497 --> 52:22.437
What's a transfection?

52:22.577 --> 52:23.038
Oh, no.

52:23.058 --> 52:24.419
And then they'd have to explain it.

52:24.719 --> 52:25.579
Oh, my goodness.

52:25.619 --> 52:27.541
Yeah, then you have to have the conversation.

52:27.841 --> 52:30.322
But the conversation never happens because people never use the word.

52:30.342 --> 52:30.462
Right.

52:53.007 --> 52:57.247
So after you get the shot, you're told to go wait in a chair for about 20 minutes.

52:57.739 --> 52:59.080
The lady's like, Natalie, you're free to go.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.601
And I was like, no, I said, no, I'm not.

53:00.621 --> 53:03.923
I was like, my heart rate is, sorry.

53:04.063 --> 53:06.985
Within 15 minutes, I noticed that I was starting to slur my words.

53:07.646 --> 53:12.029
40 minutes after I took that shot, I felt like I was on fire inside.

53:12.329 --> 53:27.339
I'm gonna go so far as to say that if Polly was really serious, then every one of these adults that came in saying that, oh, I got hurt by the shot, she would have slapped him in the face and said, now, can you imagine that they've been doing this to children and you didn't know it?

53:28.019 --> 53:38.802
that the vaccine schedule in America is just as shitty, has just as much sort of forceful nature behind it, just sort of do it, sit down and take it.

53:39.203 --> 53:49.246
It's the same thing, and they do it to children using school mandates, and my child was injured by it, Mary's child was injured by it, and you have to wake up now.

53:49.986 --> 54:00.435
but instead they make it all about their suffering and their experience and let them wallow in it instead of, and using it as a cognitive wake-up call to say, hey, guess what?

54:00.455 --> 54:01.336
It ain't just you.

54:01.696 --> 54:08.022
You're not the first person to figure out that the public health system is you being used against us, weaponized against us.

54:08.102 --> 54:09.623
It's been that way for a decade.

54:09.683 --> 54:11.605
Why don't they say that to these people?

54:13.506 --> 54:14.707
Like fire from within.

54:15.068 --> 54:16.549
Like my skin was on fire.

54:17.435 --> 54:23.120
Imagine if a two-year-old has its skin on fire from an injection, and what can they say?

54:23.760 --> 54:25.762
What can a six-month-old baby say?

54:25.782 --> 54:29.265
I mean, come on, this pisses me off.

54:29.665 --> 54:30.466
Down to my toes.

54:30.506 --> 54:34.749
I think it's O-I-S-I-N-H in appendix.

54:34.789 --> 54:36.170
My knees started buckling.

54:36.410 --> 54:38.492
I'm back.

54:38.532 --> 54:40.594
But they don't discuss the difference.

54:41.354 --> 54:42.555
Well, they point.

54:42.916 --> 54:44.597
Within three hours, I was in the hospital.

54:45.338 --> 54:46.739
My left side just drooped.

54:47.301 --> 54:49.983
you could see my whole left side of my face would drip.

54:50.023 --> 54:50.543
I still can't.

54:50.743 --> 55:01.370
I think in some ways, the goal, if people allow it to happen is for people to think still these people to think that these new vaccines have these effects, but the old ones don't.

55:01.891 --> 55:07.334
I mean, I think if they come to that conclusion, nobody at CHD is going to go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:07.374 --> 55:08.735
That's not the right way to think.

55:09.296 --> 55:14.899
Just like when Steve Kirsch was asked by Stu Peters, Hey, so you don't think anybody should take any vaccines anymore?

55:14.919 --> 55:15.980
He goes, no, no, no, no, no.

55:16.020 --> 55:16.881
That's not what I mean.

55:17.781 --> 55:19.583
Someday we might have good vaccines.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.645
And so I just, I feel this is mealy-mouthed.

55:22.805 --> 55:25.567
I feel like there's, again, an opportunity.

55:25.607 --> 55:27.889
There's a tee and there's a ball on it.

55:28.029 --> 55:37.576
And instead of hitting the ball out of the park, they just kind of knock it off the tee, or they accidentally kick the tee and knock off the ball, or they, you know, it's just some, it's ineptitude.

55:38.396 --> 55:38.817
Smile.

55:39.077 --> 55:40.178
And then I started having a seizure.

55:41.229 --> 55:42.389
Have you ever had seizures before?

55:42.409 --> 55:42.449
No.

55:42.629 --> 55:44.210
I'm previously healthy.

55:44.630 --> 55:45.530
My blood sugar was over 1,400.

55:45.570 --> 55:48.451
My organs were failing.

55:48.951 --> 55:50.512
I told my husband I wasn't going to make it.

55:50.652 --> 55:53.193
You know, they were like, how long has she been a diabetic?

55:53.253 --> 55:54.293
And he's like, never.

55:54.313 --> 55:55.933
Like, she's not a diabetic.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.714
My throat is tingling, and I'm covered in humps.

55:59.114 --> 56:01.975
She says we can't give her intravenous Benadryl.

56:01.995 --> 56:06.457
We can't give her intravenous steroids because it will stop the vaccine from working.

56:07.557 --> 56:09.197
Well, I asked him, well, should I get the next one?

56:09.237 --> 56:10.918
He said, yeah, either that or die from COVID.

56:12.731 --> 56:13.372
You gotta be kidding me.

56:13.392 --> 56:14.153
I just had a stroke.

56:14.753 --> 56:19.179
That following morning, I had the worst, most irritable pounding in my head.

56:19.199 --> 56:20.540
Like, bah, bah, bah.

56:20.881 --> 56:25.586
Shaky, weak, uneasy, shortness of breath, random chest pain.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.108
My memory was shot.

56:27.448 --> 56:30.312
Short-term memory, long-term memory.

56:30.825 --> 56:32.346
A couple of days later, I had tremor.

56:32.386 --> 56:36.388
What happens if a two-year-old's memory is shot or they have a pounding headache?

56:36.468 --> 56:41.530
I don't understand how we're not using this as an opportunity to dunk on this.

56:41.911 --> 56:43.251
And it's just shocking to me.

56:43.271 --> 56:44.892
It's in all four of my limbs.

56:45.312 --> 56:46.913
My talking was just all crazy.

56:46.933 --> 56:48.694
I was very disoriented and dizzy.

56:49.074 --> 56:51.415
Come to find out they think it was a mini stroke.

56:52.016 --> 56:58.159
And then from that day on, so this is a week, seven days after my vaccine, I was having three or four seizures every single day.

56:58.806 --> 57:02.069
I was getting hospitalized, like, every other week because of my chest pains.

57:02.569 --> 57:11.737
I left there nine days after being admitted with a non-working pancreas, on steroids, on beta blockers.

57:12.417 --> 57:14.899
Chronic inflammation, demyelination, polyneuropathy.

57:14.919 --> 57:17.661
I have tinnitus, heart palpitations, tremors.

57:18.082 --> 57:21.304
Tremors, you know, my chest was burning, dizziness.

57:21.905 --> 57:26.488
I had Guillain-Barre, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pericarditis.

57:27.189 --> 57:27.930
Myocarditis.

57:28.539 --> 57:29.300
myocarditis.

57:29.780 --> 57:34.923
It's an inflammation and damage of the heart muscle known as myocardium.

57:35.764 --> 57:38.285
This inflammation can reduce my heart's ability to pump blood.

57:38.726 --> 57:46.811
It can also cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid or regular heart rhythms, which fits perfectly with what I was experiencing back in California and even now.

57:47.351 --> 57:49.553
It was just crazy, the craziest symptoms.

57:49.913 --> 57:53.916
During my menstrual cycle, I have huge clots that I've never had before.

57:53.936 --> 57:57.178
A long blood clot in my sinuses.

57:58.115 --> 58:00.977
This is the bottom of my lung that is filled with blood.

58:01.577 --> 58:02.277
That's the day.

58:02.818 --> 58:03.018
Yeah.

58:03.618 --> 58:19.347
Every time that I see a specialist or see someone new in the health or medical field that acts as if they're trying to help me and figure this out, they just push me off to the next person.

58:20.248 --> 58:22.549
And I've already reclotted once.

58:24.310 --> 58:25.191
Those are my eyes.

58:25.711 --> 58:26.371
This is a huge,

58:29.306 --> 58:36.088
tumor about the size of a softball behind my eye.

58:36.388 --> 58:39.569
They said it was the most aggressive cancer that they've seen.

58:39.589 --> 58:40.329
I bet that hurt.

58:40.649 --> 58:41.369
Oh my gosh.

58:41.449 --> 58:46.711
I bounced around from hospital to hospital because nobody ever seen this type of tumor before.

58:46.731 --> 58:54.473
It's usually found in little kids and also dogs post rabies vaccinations.

58:55.487 --> 58:59.833
interferon is one of the most important chemicals that many of our cells make.

58:59.873 --> 59:01.314
There's a type one interferon.

59:02.135 --> 59:12.027
And this particular spike protein from this virus decreases that interferon, which when that spike protein is present, those cells

59:13.126 --> 59:20.708
suppress that interferon, and now it can't recruit your other immune cells to fight off important things, like cancer.

59:20.988 --> 59:21.928
I'm David Rastig.

59:22.228 --> 59:23.188
And what do you all think?

59:23.248 --> 59:25.589
Jay, Jay, is there any truth to what he just said?

59:26.869 --> 59:27.649
Oh my gosh.

59:28.049 --> 59:30.309
I mean, he just had a whole lot of information there.

59:30.409 --> 59:34.330
And I'm not in a position, I don't question things I can't understand.

59:34.810 --> 59:39.611
Well, I was going to say something, but I just kind of, I don't know what to do anymore.

59:39.631 --> 59:40.532
Oh, please, what were you going to say?

59:43.720 --> 59:53.647
What he's saying there was also something that was reported in 2021 about COVID, that COVID was causing people to make anti-interferon antibodies.

59:53.747 --> 01:00:02.353
And so this was a story that was told... Anti-interferon antibodies.

01:00:02.393 --> 01:00:07.797
Yeah, and interferon is a intracellular signal, well, it's an extracellular signal.

01:00:07.817 --> 01:00:12.120
Cells release it supposedly when they are virally infected.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:12.681
So when they're...

01:00:14.586 --> 01:00:20.976
Again, you have to kind of realize that as I talk, I'm still trying to sort out the virology from immunology.

01:00:21.036 --> 01:00:28.628
And right now, immunology accepts the idea or goes with the idea that interferon is released by cells that are

01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:30.490
hijacked by viruses.

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:39.537
And so, the idea is that the spike protein binds to interferon, but it can also cause you to make antibodies which overlap with interferon.

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:44.961
And so, if your body's making antibodies to interferon, then interferon can't stimulate the immune system.

01:00:45.001 --> 01:00:49.885
And so, it doesn't really jive either with the idea of a cytokine storm.

01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:53.788
So, if you can't activate your immune system with interferon, I don't know how you get a cytokine storm.

01:00:53.908 --> 01:00:54.248
Anyway,

01:00:55.701 --> 01:01:05.164
I just find it frustrating because it's such a simplified version of what Interferon does, where it's released.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:13.167
And so it's hard for me to argue with them because I know that they're standing on a bunch of literature they think is true, but I think it's a real oversimplification.

01:01:13.227 --> 01:01:19.189
And I'm very weirded out by the fact that Dave's here, but it's all good.

01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:22.410
I think Dave works for CHD now, which is interesting.

01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:24.937
Oh, sorry, wrong spacebar.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:43.430
for as long as we've known about cancers, are slow.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:44.730
It takes to develop.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:50.792
Blood cancers, typically a few years for blood cancers, and decades for solid tumors.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:54.613
It could be that interferon is also released by cancerous cells.

01:01:54.653 --> 01:02:02.935
I'm not really sure, but I would go, you know, somebody in the chat just said that Dr. Judy is big on interferon, and that's true.

01:02:04.946 --> 01:02:08.742
To me, Interferon represents something of a...

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:23.797
limited handhold that maybe the let's say biosecurity state or the NIH or the or DARPA or whoever these people are that work on the immune system for public health reasons.

01:02:25.098 --> 01:02:29.381
Interferon is one of these signals that they use as a proxy for activation.

01:02:29.481 --> 01:02:38.807
So I think one of the reasons why they know so much about interferon is because if they test for it and they find it then they can also think that maybe there will be antibodies to the thing that

01:02:39.227 --> 01:02:41.029
cause the interferon to be released.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:46.996
And so it's also something that is very likely figured into any designer protein they've ever made.

01:02:47.216 --> 01:02:55.105
Any, let's say, you know, identified epitope at EpiVax that they might have worked on at EpiVax would have had

01:02:55.686 --> 01:03:00.228
to figure in the idea that maybe we can put a little piece of interferon on here.

01:03:00.248 --> 01:03:12.913
And if you did that, and then you transfected people to a piece of interferon or a overlapping sequence of interferon, you would also expect this downside of, well, if you get antibodies to that part, that would suck.

01:03:12.993 --> 01:03:14.214
And the assumption

01:03:15.374 --> 01:03:27.585
Maybe I'm going too far here, but the assumption I think that people in this space would make is that interferon is a self-protein, and so your body would already have no T-cells to recognize it.

01:03:28.046 --> 01:03:32.530
And so it would be a safe addition to any designer protein.

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:36.414
And so for me, if you were worried about

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:53.366
a designer protein that you were going to transfix people to that had some overlap with interferon and you were worried that a subset of people might develop an antibody to it, then the best way to to nip that in the bud would be to tell a story about the novel virus doing the same thing.

01:03:53.406 --> 01:03:54.067
And so for me,

01:03:54.907 --> 01:04:06.013
At some point in 2021, I started to reverse that story in my head and think, wow, they laid that early on with these meddlers saying that, oh, look, there's anti-interferon antibodies.

01:04:06.574 --> 01:04:14.298
And that really came into my head when I learned about EpiVax and what they were looking for and how they were designing proteins and adding epitopes.

01:04:14.358 --> 01:04:23.423
And it dawned on me that one of the things they might do is add a little piece of interferon, assuming that because it's a self-protein, you wouldn't make antibodies to it.

01:04:25.658 --> 01:04:27.039
Anyway, I hope that made some sense.

01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:28.079
No, it makes sense.

01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:31.700
And someone, you said in the chat, Judy is big on it too.

01:04:31.761 --> 01:04:32.121
Yeah.

01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:33.561
I just searched on it.

01:04:34.562 --> 01:04:46.226
It was also brought up in a 2016 article with Jill Glasspool Malone, Robert Malone, Sina Bavari, and Veronica Soloveva regarding Zika vaccines.

01:04:46.346 --> 01:04:54.670
And they had a discussion that said Zika infection of the recipient host requires viral envelope protein binding and particle uptake into susceptible cells.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:05:15.577
It is mediated by specific receptors, which include DC-sign, AXL, Tyro3, TIM1, and triggers transcriptional activation of toll-like receptor 3, or TLR3, RIG, MDA, and interferon-stimulated genes, including OAS2, IG, ISG15, and MX1, and beta-interferon.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.679
We know that he's also involved in that.

01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:31.123
And the Zika vaccine, they were all looking at DNA and mRNA forms of having a Zika vaccine.

01:05:32.484 --> 01:05:37.406
Obviously that didn't roll out because the Zika epidemic, pandemic, whatever, ended in time.

01:05:38.826 --> 01:05:44.909
I do suspect that a lot of those technologies were ready to go and were probably just rebranded and rolled into SARS.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:48.891
the SARS, you know, the COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 response.

01:05:48.931 --> 01:05:54.534
So anyway, more reasons why finally everyone's all on the same stage right now.

01:05:54.794 --> 01:05:55.875
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:55.895 --> 01:05:57.636
With the musical.

01:05:58.596 --> 01:05:58.997
Sorry.

01:05:59.157 --> 01:05:59.917
No, no, it's good.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:00.738
That's a good point.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:02.859
It's a good, that's what we're here for.

01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:10.648
mRNA and DNA vaccines, these genetic injections, are devastating the immune system.

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:17.512
We know that's happening already, but now we're seeing a consequence of that devastated immune system.

01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:27.218
It's an acceleration of tumors that were probably already in you to begin with, were benign, probably go away on their own, you'd never know you had it.

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:32.021
But once your immune system is really, really depressed, now these things can develop rapidly.

01:06:32.882 --> 01:06:40.808
Not only that, but the spike protein itself binds to certain families of genes in our body that suppress cancers.

01:06:40.909 --> 01:06:43.230
It's a whole family of genes called p53.

01:06:43.971 --> 01:06:48.274
And there are several studies showing that this spike protein can bind to that.

01:06:48.555 --> 01:06:59.804
And so here he's quoting in vitro studies where the spike protein is produced in vitro in a cell culture, and then they look for interaction in a gel, or they look at interaction in some other way.

01:07:00.504 --> 01:07:10.435
And so all of these things prove really nothing about number one, whether the spike protein produced in your body is the same one used in that experiment.

01:07:10.876 --> 01:07:15.221
It doesn't prove a lot of these interactions are happening in your body, but they

01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:19.805
they happen when you put those two things in an otherwise empty dish.

01:07:19.965 --> 01:07:21.767
So it's tricky for me.

01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:33.298
I don't like the enthusiasm with which these people present what I know to be in vitro data as definitive high fidelity results that transfer directly to your body.

01:07:33.338 --> 01:07:34.099
I don't like that.

01:07:34.739 --> 01:07:35.960
And I don't like the idea.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.901
I get

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:42.328
more and more angry the more I realized that placebo was so easy.

01:07:42.488 --> 01:07:46.229
Like it's so obvious that they use placebo in order to get away with this.

01:07:46.409 --> 01:07:48.809
And it just, it drives me bananas.

01:07:48.909 --> 01:08:06.833
P53, the tumor suppressor protein P53 and the tumor susceptibility gene 101 or TSG 101 are involved in a complex regulatory loop that controls the level of P53, MDM2 and other proteins.

01:08:07.768 --> 01:08:09.369
It would be nice if he said that.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:23.959
Because the only person that Sina Bavari ever tried to hire as a young female assistant in his laboratory was named Jennifer Garris.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.222
And she was killed in a murder-suicide at the end of 2018.

01:08:28.722 --> 01:08:32.264
She's the only one that ever said no.

01:08:32.304 --> 01:08:35.827
The other ones kept working with Bavari, and they're all fine and rich.

01:08:39.878 --> 01:08:42.240
And was she working on that?

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.421
Was she working on that?

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.304
Yeah, that was her thing.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:09:06.049
And she also, when Venki Ramakrishnan was doing his presentation during his Nobel Prize or whatever it is, ceremony, he showed a picture of several people that he worked with closely at Utah that were part of his career in determining how the ribosome was mapped out.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:11.412
I fell off my chair, because dead in the center was a picture of Jennifer Garris.

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:15.258
No one talks about this shit.

01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:16.920
I'm sorry to curse.

01:09:17.581 --> 01:09:17.881
Wow.

01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:20.763
Everyone's got all their expertise, you know?

01:09:20.884 --> 01:09:24.647
And unless it involves a Jew or Epstein, it's not interesting to anyone.

01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:31.053
I'm just gonna start making up stories that Epstein was involved in TSG 101.

01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:32.494
Maybe then.

01:09:32.674 --> 01:09:33.435
Oh yeah, TSG 101.

01:09:34.076 --> 01:09:37.559
They experimented on kids in caves or some shit.

01:09:39.237 --> 01:09:41.120
It's the Zionist protein.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.462
Just make up shit like that.

01:09:43.765 --> 01:09:47.872
Whitney Webb and Polly, can you please start looking at TSG 101?

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:52.300
I swear to God, it involves the murder of Jennifer Garris and Epstein.

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:59.273
You have to tweet that though, otherwise- Look at all those fucking guitars in the background.

01:09:59.773 --> 01:10:01.295
You can't even listen, you watch one of my shows.

01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:06.779
And then that tumor suppressor family can't function properly, which allows cancers to take off.

01:10:06.799 --> 01:10:07.800
Sorry, sorry for the- No, it's all good.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:13.065
We're destroying their immune systems to the point where they can't resist the cancer.

01:10:13.085 --> 01:10:16.007
And the cancer cells are now growing like they are in cell culture.

01:10:16.447 --> 01:10:21.552
They don't have anything impeding their ability to proliferate.

01:10:22.253 --> 01:10:24.334
I reported to VAERS right away.

01:10:24.374 --> 01:10:40.285
I just find it very frustrating that Ryan Cole and David Rasnick are so serious and so sure that the immune system is being suppressed by the transfection, and that's what's enabling the cancers.

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:41.146
And that's it.

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:42.587
They know now.

01:10:42.707 --> 01:10:43.968
It's totally explained.

01:10:44.128 --> 01:10:49.972
And I find that, again, it's dropping a ball because by

01:10:51.175 --> 01:11:01.098
by offering such a simple explanation, it's very, very easy for anyone who spends any amount of time to figure out that that's not sufficient.

01:11:01.318 --> 01:11:13.202
And if they're interested in having Fauci or someone else confirmed, then that insufficiency will be enough for them to go right back to Fauci or right back to all these people and say, I guess these guys aren't lying.

01:11:13.482 --> 01:11:15.543
And they state it with such incredible confidence.

01:11:15.643 --> 01:11:17.163
Unbelievable.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.483
We see a connection between these two things.

01:11:20.224 --> 01:11:22.304
I have no idea what a TSG101 is.

01:11:22.944 --> 01:11:24.305
All I know is how to search for it.

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:26.805
And I find it popping up in various places.

01:11:26.845 --> 01:11:30.286
And I'm like, OK, there's some connections here that someone needs to explain.

01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:34.027
But I'm not going to suddenly show you a picture of, oh, it twists this way.

01:11:34.067 --> 01:11:36.387
And it must do this to the immune system.

01:11:36.567 --> 01:11:37.368
I have no idea.

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:38.468
I don't pretend to.

01:11:39.088 --> 01:11:44.130
I think it would, I think it would be a certainty that they state this stuff is really misleads people.

01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:52.374
Yeah, I think it would be really, really much more powerful if they say that neither the NIH nor us know what's happening.

01:11:52.834 --> 01:12:02.279
We only know that there is a striking correlation between people exposed to these materials and all of this bouquet of bad outcomes.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:06.661
And why offer any more explanation than that unless it is

01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:09.665
It's just frustrating again.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:19.421
You're just an it feels like you're just a number and it's just a data collection it's not even a follow-up to You know

01:12:20.999 --> 01:12:28.443
And they do this to the parents of children who are injured by the original, current, existing vaccine schedule.

01:12:28.463 --> 01:12:31.785
And again, why aren't we telling these adults?

01:12:31.805 --> 01:12:41.010
There should be one time where every one of these adults gets sat down and say, okay, you realize that the same exact laws, the protections, the lack of

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:49.260
of incentive to make anything safe, the lack of requirement to test, these are all missing from the regular childhood vaccine schedule.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.923
So use this as an opportunity to wake up, my friend.

01:12:52.304 --> 01:12:53.726
And they don't, they're not.

01:12:53.746 --> 01:12:57.451
If you're okay, they get to judge.

01:12:58.755 --> 01:13:06.001
They get to judge whether or not this is my new normal and this is what I have to fight every day.

01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:10.325
This is better than what I was before.

01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:19.352
She was in the bed for basically a year before she could actually talk and be present because it was so bad.

01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:24.917
I mean, she would have anywhere from 15 to 30 mini seizures throughout the day.

01:13:26.164 --> 01:13:27.984
I'm starting to go into one.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:29.665
Are you having an episode right now?

01:13:29.745 --> 01:13:30.665
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:32.465
Do you need me to stop filming?

01:13:32.545 --> 01:13:33.906
Nah, I'm okay.

01:13:34.146 --> 01:13:34.666
I'm okay.

01:13:35.186 --> 01:13:35.686
I'll be all right.

01:13:36.526 --> 01:13:38.246
What else am I supposed to do?

01:13:39.307 --> 01:13:39.887
I know.

01:13:39.927 --> 01:13:41.207
This is the life that I have now.

01:13:41.787 --> 01:13:43.147
I can't even have my grandbabies.

01:13:43.647 --> 01:13:50.189
Hold my... Babysit my grandp... Sorry.

01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:51.549
Is he okay?

01:13:52.182 --> 01:13:52.662
Yeah, he's fine.

01:13:52.682 --> 01:13:54.304
He's just flossing.

01:13:54.324 --> 01:13:55.084
No, it's the sonic.

01:13:55.144 --> 01:13:56.545
I can't push it back.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:59.448
This is too Madonna.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.569
Too Madonna.

01:14:01.589 --> 01:14:03.771
This is not a quality of life, you know?

01:14:04.151 --> 01:14:06.733
It's when you start thinking, OK, how do I end my life?

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.355
Life's different.

01:14:08.435 --> 01:14:10.096
We're fortunate, blessed.

01:14:11.257 --> 01:14:13.199
You know what I would go so far as to say?

01:14:13.219 --> 01:14:16.961
I think what's extraordinary here is that we are seeing that

01:14:17.765 --> 01:14:23.888
that hot batches of transfection are single dose nasties.

01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:36.033
I actually think that when you're just injecting an adjuvant and some recombinant proteins that you do need multiple exposure and that you have to get comparatively much more unlucky.

01:14:36.693 --> 01:14:40.495
My guess is the only reason why every single person

01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:45.759
that got transfected isn't pissed about it is because they use placebo.

01:14:46.319 --> 01:14:48.161
That almost has to be the case.

01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:50.082
I mean- Yeah, I agree.

01:14:50.783 --> 01:14:54.226
I really think that's- You know, doing as good as he's doing today.

01:14:54.246 --> 01:14:56.227
And they credit that really.

01:14:56.287 --> 01:15:02.072
All of the doctors had one thing they agreed on, and that's because he was in such good health before he had the shots.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:14.428
I went from, you know, squatting with a bar and 45s on each side and playing college softball to my physical therapy was me sitting on a table trying to lift my leg up.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:23.312
I spent 31 months sitting in an infusion center getting IVIG, that's intravenous immunoglobulins, just where I can do my everyday living.

01:15:23.692 --> 01:15:26.574
I can't, my life will never be the same ever again.

01:15:27.034 --> 01:15:30.096
It took driving away, it took my, I'm a professional photographer.

01:15:30.396 --> 01:15:33.658
It's interesting to hear that she got immunoglobulins.

01:15:33.698 --> 01:15:38.160
I don't know if they were aimed at something or if they, you know, that's a weird thing to drop out there.

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.361
Why did she get those?

01:15:39.421 --> 01:15:44.484
What did that, how does that help her and not anybody else who's, it's a weird thing to just drop in there.

01:15:44.524 --> 01:15:45.184
I didn't get that.

01:15:45.384 --> 01:15:50.927
I wasn't on that creative niche in my brain still doesn't function at all.

01:15:51.467 --> 01:15:52.408
I just want,

01:15:53.925 --> 01:16:02.332
to find someone that will help me get well and try to live the best life that I can with my family.

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:13.182
And the scary part is, is that let's be very honest, ladies and gentlemen, transfection is something that can potentially permanently change you as a pattern integrity.

01:16:13.742 --> 01:16:15.624
She may have no way out.

01:16:16.224 --> 01:16:24.767
there may be no cure for the new direction that her immune system is going and you can't turn that bus around.

01:16:25.287 --> 01:16:30.969
That's the reason why for 40 years there's been this term called original antigenic sin.

01:16:30.989 --> 01:16:38.072
Your immune system tends to learn in one direction and it has a hard time unlearning things.

01:16:38.672 --> 01:16:47.777
This is the reason why you can think of it as kind of a system that constantly has the brakes on in order to make sure that it doesn't make a mistake.

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:56.863
And then vaccination is designed to take the brakes off and let something happen so that they can call it a product.

01:16:58.894 --> 01:17:02.236
It's very scary to me, because that's the real prognosis.

01:17:02.336 --> 01:17:09.100
That's the reason why I told my friend Nate, yes, I do believe that you could still die from your shot, even though you think you're fine now.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.522
And he did die, because this is how it works.

01:17:11.562 --> 01:17:13.323
You can't turn this bus around.

01:17:14.356 --> 01:17:16.717
They kill mice when they're done, right?

01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:19.238
They definitely kill mice when they're done.

01:17:19.818 --> 01:17:21.399
You can't just keep testing it.

01:17:21.699 --> 01:17:21.859
No.

01:17:21.899 --> 01:17:25.501
It's one use, and then it's never the same.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.822
Because you go through this window.

01:17:28.902 --> 01:17:33.784
If you wanted to test the structural strength of, I don't know, maybe this was a piece of steel, right?

01:17:33.804 --> 01:17:37.086
If you want to see how strong it was, you apply pressure to it.

01:17:37.706 --> 01:18:00.282
under you know different uh all at one point where you distribute the load you measure it and then you don't use the same piece and then test it again because you've already stressed it you don't keep reusing the same point so once you're done testing it you kind of throw it back into the fire you need to make it again it's it's done if you want to test the strength of a piece of wood like from an engineering standpoint you test it once

01:18:00.982 --> 01:18:01.443
And that's it.

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:03.424
It's not the same piece after the test.

01:18:03.865 --> 01:18:05.847
You've damaged it in one way or another.

01:18:05.907 --> 01:18:07.348
It's not the same piece.

01:18:08.169 --> 01:18:13.914
So testing on humans thus is very expensive.

01:18:15.455 --> 01:18:25.625
The investment, money, time spiritually into one human being is a multi-million dollar investment.

01:18:26.947 --> 01:18:29.308
I mean, even just from the cold calculating standpoint.

01:18:29.968 --> 01:18:46.733
So yeah, so they're using placebos and I don't, I mean, you and I may have different opinions on this, but I don't believe that the plan was ever to roll out all of these mRNA, DNA shots at once.

01:18:47.673 --> 01:18:51.754
They were supposed to have had a surge in COVID in early 2020.

01:18:54.223 --> 01:19:06.388
because of, I don't know, a separation of people and distancing and masks and hospital protocols or events or whatever, they were supposed to get COVID under control.

01:19:06.968 --> 01:19:19.913
And then Fauci and Bright and the head of the CDC, they all said the same thing, 18 to 36 months, we will have a vaccine.

01:19:20.782 --> 01:19:21.302
and that's it.

01:19:21.462 --> 01:19:23.323
There was gonna be no more COVID.

01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:26.405
They were supposed to have solved COVID, no warp speed.

01:19:27.045 --> 01:19:32.248
Well, do you think they were just gonna take all the vaccines that were already manufactured and just throw them away?

01:19:33.473 --> 01:19:43.782
they were gonna roll them out slowly, probably even using placebo-type methodology into the population, probably with flu shots, and to see what happened.

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:48.486
And if every once in a while somebody died, well, shit happens.

01:19:48.946 --> 01:19:53.210
And they'll probably test positive for COVID, and then they can say COVID is still out there.

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:58.834
And that's why people will need to take their COVID shots when they're actually officially available.

01:19:59.335 --> 01:20:01.276
That's what was supposed to happen.

01:20:02.117 --> 01:20:07.961
So even this is a response to a narrative that didn't go exactly as planned.

01:20:08.401 --> 01:20:10.362
It was not supposed to be this massive rollout.

01:20:10.382 --> 01:20:16.586
They're trying to make lemonade out of the lemons, I guess, but this was not the plan.

01:20:18.227 --> 01:20:41.429
but yeah you you're the only person jay that's articulating it clearly these must be placebos for all of the reasons which i don't think you've done a good job yet at putting it into a list like these are the reasons why it's pretty obviously or most likely a placebo right i mean you just said another one of them you know uh the fact that people don't seem to slowly get their cardiac problems it's like

01:20:41.929 --> 01:20:45.137
everything's fine, and then you're almost dying or you do die.

01:20:45.418 --> 01:20:48.766
That is a very binary type of response.

01:20:48.806 --> 01:20:50.912
That's not a slow measured response.

01:20:51.812 --> 01:21:02.403
I think one devil's advocate position would be that, and you've felt this too, that one of the things that they've been trying to push on us is the idea that these were rushed.

01:21:03.044 --> 01:21:05.306
And so that's why they're contaminated or whatever.

01:21:05.346 --> 01:21:14.635
And so you could also see where you could blame the rush on the fact that Donald Trump made warp speed so fast and then now,

01:21:17.256 --> 01:21:24.938
When the truth comes out, it'll be like, well, at least part of the reason why we rushed it was because Donald Trump made us rush.

01:21:26.638 --> 01:21:29.839
I mean, I don't know, this is just minor business, but anyway.

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:34.560
No, no, no, and that kind of started after Warp Speed.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.081
There was no discussion of rushing and contamination early on.

01:21:39.381 --> 01:21:39.541
No.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:42.282
You could actually see, just do the metadata searches.

01:21:42.322 --> 01:21:44.242
That happens after Warp Speed was announced.

01:21:44.906 --> 01:21:52.811
because there was going to be no more ability to, you know, probably bleed these out or leak them out into the general population with other type of shots.

01:21:53.051 --> 01:21:53.271
Yeah.

01:21:53.532 --> 01:21:54.572
So then they started this.

01:21:54.632 --> 01:21:56.814
Well, you know, contaminated vaccines.

01:21:56.874 --> 01:21:57.734
Those are no good.

01:21:58.275 --> 01:22:01.276
So I mean, I or everyone.

01:22:01.357 --> 01:22:04.198
I mean, so many of us have had people impacted or killed by this.

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:04.859
You can have to.

01:22:04.999 --> 01:22:05.139
Yeah.

01:22:05.539 --> 01:22:13.547
I really think that you have a lot of, there's a lot of interesting data points to support this idea that they accelerated the timeline.

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:14.988
One of them is AstraZeneca.

01:22:15.028 --> 01:22:15.929
It was barely out.

01:22:16.589 --> 01:22:28.020
I mean, they didn't give it any time to go anywhere and they could have, you know, AstraZeneca could have been the first thing with Johnson & Johnson and left it go even longer if they wanted to, but somehow it did feel sped up.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.322
And so, yeah, it's hard to say.

01:22:30.522 --> 01:22:31.523
We're never going to probably know.

01:22:32.162 --> 01:22:32.843
It is about your sister?

01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:34.003
It is about my sister.

01:22:34.023 --> 01:22:35.264
Okay, tell us what happens.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.946
Take us back to when this occurred.

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:39.387
Unfortunately, the story's really short.

01:22:39.527 --> 01:22:39.888
That's it.

01:22:40.148 --> 01:22:41.008
She takes the shot.

01:22:41.469 --> 01:22:43.390
Ten days later, she's dead.

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:44.991
Her daughter got her heart starting.

01:22:45.011 --> 01:22:46.252
This is the hard part.

01:22:54.358 --> 01:22:56.620
And the, um, EMTs came.

01:23:00.316 --> 01:23:01.697
They put her in the ambulance.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:03.238
I believe they had to start her heart again.

01:23:03.258 --> 01:23:09.142
They took her to a hospital, and they diagnosed brain aneurysm.

01:23:09.922 --> 01:23:14.305
The reason I'm here, she can't speak for herself, and it has to stop.

01:23:14.826 --> 01:23:15.506
It has to stop.

01:23:15.546 --> 01:23:17.588
These things have to be off the market, because they are dangerous.

01:23:17.968 --> 01:23:18.308
And you know what?

01:23:18.348 --> 01:23:26.474
Mykel's one of the lucky ones, because she's not suffering like a lot of other people are from these vaccinations.

01:23:27.274 --> 01:23:27.854
One Madonna.

01:23:28.155 --> 01:23:28.555
One Madonna.

01:23:30.371 --> 01:23:36.140
There's another one one just one he was killed by the Pfizer vaccine He only took one shot.

01:23:36.301 --> 01:23:37.843
He took only one shot.

01:23:37.903 --> 01:23:44.854
You see this doesn't this and I Think it was placebo for sure He passed away suddenly

01:23:46.338 --> 01:23:52.461
Uh, he had been feeling, um, chest pains in the morning, around one o'clock in the morning.

01:23:52.521 --> 01:24:06.928
The only people that I lost during my entire life during high school were two kids that were two years younger than me on our basketball team were coming back from a, from, um, university of Wisconsin, Stout and Menominee.

01:24:06.948 --> 01:24:10.569
And they got hit head on by a drunk driver and were killed instantly.

01:24:10.649 --> 01:24:14.251
Those are the only two people of young age in my life.

01:24:15.037 --> 01:24:16.878
at the time when I was young that ever died.

01:24:17.258 --> 01:24:19.839
I don't know anybody that dropped dead on a football field.

01:24:19.919 --> 01:24:21.619
I don't know anybody who dropped dead in their bed.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:29.402
And so for me, I mean, I don't know what to say other than we need to wake people up.

01:24:29.562 --> 01:24:35.924
Obviously this is happening, but I think the only reason why it didn't happen more often is because they dosed it and they placeboed it.

01:24:36.684 --> 01:24:38.565
I went to Trumbull High School in Connecticut.

01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:41.086
I think the total size was

01:24:42.513 --> 01:24:46.235
1800 students, maybe four or 500 a class, I forget the exact number.

01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:59.981
And I wasn't exactly a very social person, so I might have missed something, but I only know, I know that there were two kids that died during the four-year period, you know, of high school.

01:25:00.561 --> 01:25:04.703
And they were in a, they were just, they were driving recklessly, they went off the road.

01:25:05.543 --> 01:25:07.824
Two, maybe even three kids died in that accident.

01:25:07.884 --> 01:25:09.705
I don't know of a single fatal drug overdose,

01:25:10.778 --> 01:25:23.238
or anything else during that four-year period, which is very different now, where you could have a small memorial garden filled with drug overdose deaths just for every high school graduation in some areas.

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:39.409
Dude, I can tell you a story that will, in retrospect, maybe, I'm still shocked because it doesn't come to my head very often, but the first week of school, after we moved to Pittsburgh, we didn't even understand what was going on.

01:25:39.449 --> 01:25:40.930
This is in 2016.

01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:50.239
We brought our son to the school and out in front of the school, a mom got out of her minivan, collapsed on the ground and died.

01:25:50.953 --> 01:25:52.534
and it turned out to be an overdose.

01:25:52.855 --> 01:26:01.602
And those kids ended up moving with their stepfather across the street from us in Pittsburgh, and our kids became friends.

01:26:01.682 --> 01:26:09.329
But like within the first week that we were here, their mom died at our school on the pavement when we were like, what, what?

01:26:09.509 --> 01:26:11.010
A mom died at school?

01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.811
You never told me this.

01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:14.533
And we never found out until- They never told me this, guys.

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:17.396
Months later that this lady had died of an overdose.

01:26:17.616 --> 01:26:18.237
And it was like,

01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:34.036
We still, you know, every time those girls would come up to our house and jump on our trampoline, it was like, I still can't believe that that's the lady that died on the sixth day we were at school in Pittsburgh.

01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:35.017
It was nuts, dude.

01:26:35.097 --> 01:26:42.260
And it still, all the way up until meeting you, never came clear to me that this was happening in America.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.321
It just wasn't on the news.

01:26:43.361 --> 01:26:44.461
It wasn't on my radar.

01:26:44.501 --> 01:26:45.522
I was working too hard.

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:52.528
you know, lost in being a young father and trying to make it as an academic.

01:26:52.628 --> 01:27:01.920
And it even happened at my kid's school, and our neighbors were affected by it, and it still was not consciously in my awareness.

01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:11.721
and not ashamed of it, I'm just shocked that the control of our attention was so thorough.

01:27:12.401 --> 01:27:18.585
I mean, and this, I apologize to the people watching who wanna get back to the movie, but just a second here.

01:27:19.546 --> 01:27:29.693
I mean, you know, the number of people who died last year, the US government isn't even releasing all of the data properly anymore, but it's about 3 million, 33 million, 200,000 or something like that.

01:27:33.283 --> 01:27:37.586
died of all causes last year within the United States of America, approximately.

01:27:38.406 --> 01:27:44.710
And with 120,000 fatal drug overdoses, I mean, it's very simple math.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:49.592
That means one out of every 30 deaths, all causes, was a drug overdose.

01:27:49.872 --> 01:27:50.193
One out of 30.

01:27:51.193 --> 01:27:54.575
And most of those were age, average age I think is about 27 to 29.

01:27:54.755 --> 01:28:03.000
And okay, I'd be willing to suggest that that is something that should be an election issue.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:05.937
even Trump won't talk about it.

01:28:06.157 --> 01:28:14.183
I mean, I give him rope because I know families who've worked with him and still have faith in him.

01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:19.107
So I hold back a little bit out of respect for a variety of reasons.

01:28:19.247 --> 01:28:22.409
Okay, I have reasons, but he's not even talking about it publicly.

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:28.594
Sure as hell, Kamala's not talking about it or Biden, but how can that not even come up?

01:28:29.355 --> 01:28:32.337
And if it did come up, well, people would have to start thinking, well,

01:28:33.587 --> 01:28:44.312
maybe over the last few years that had something to do with the data of increased mortality, dropping life expectancy that led to people to taking these shots that killed people on the first use of it.

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:51.276
Don't wanna say that, instead, this show actually started with Pierre Kory.

01:28:51.336 --> 01:28:52.556
Now I'll tie it in like that.

01:28:53.337 --> 01:28:59.360
A man who on his Jimmy Dore time denied that there was any role

01:29:00.177 --> 01:29:06.238
and increasing deaths of drug overdoses having anything to do with chopping life expectancy in the United States.

01:29:06.498 --> 01:29:08.259
He actually went out of his way to say that.

01:29:08.899 --> 01:29:10.259
Jessica Rose said that as well.

01:29:10.839 --> 01:29:12.339
And that's not mentioned in here.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.360
It's not the whole story.

01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:15.440
It's a huge story.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:25.382
It's not the entire story of all the horrible things that have happened, but it's like the list you keep saying with repetitiveness, Jay, which I think is the right thing to do.

01:29:26.909 --> 01:29:29.291
How can you tell the whole story without listing out these several things?

01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:30.751
It's not factored in at all.

01:29:31.312 --> 01:29:33.433
And it even impacts, in many ways, kids.

01:29:34.114 --> 01:29:35.815
Children's health defense, they won't talk about it.

01:29:35.895 --> 01:29:39.697
Either the teenagers who are killed or kids growing up without parents.

01:29:40.818 --> 01:29:43.159
Somehow, children's health defense misses this.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.762
And even if they don't wanna be focused on overdoses, which I could respect, right?

01:29:48.723 --> 01:29:56.208
Even at least mention it from the perspective of maybe these are reasons to not take these transfections which have killed people, they won't mention it.

01:29:58.109 --> 01:30:10.678
I'm not, I'm really, I'm also really not down with the idea anymore that, you know, when we were children or young adults or not young adults, when we were children, when we were students in school, there were groups like D.A.R.E.

01:30:11.499 --> 01:30:16.002
and we would get these like lectures about how you have to just say no to drugs.

01:30:16.082 --> 01:30:20.825
And the drugs that we were saying no to at the time when we were kids were basically keg parties.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:25.609
And maybe if you lived close enough to a big city, also weed, but

01:30:26.249 --> 01:30:34.560
In northern Wisconsin, we were being given the same pitch that people were being given in New York City, even though we didn't have access to anything really dangerous other than kegs.

01:30:35.241 --> 01:30:43.471
And for me, as a neurobiologist who has read a lot of literature about

01:30:44.820 --> 01:31:05.151
the circuitry of cocaine and the circuitry of heroin and how this hijacks the brain of a rat to behave in a certain way and that we know, we know that the circuits that are hijacked and the way that they are hijacked is a physiological change that kind of traps the animal within that circuit.

01:31:06.292 --> 01:31:24.367
if you take the the tv upstairs and you program only two channels into it and then you give the remote control to your kid and don't the kid doesn't know how to to reprogram the tv then there's only two channels there and and and that reprogramming if they can't figure out how to do it then they're stuck with those two channels

01:31:25.067 --> 01:31:38.233
And it is very equivalent to what happens in extreme cases of addiction where the circuitry of the brain is changed in such a way so that the correct output of behavior is almost impossible to generate.

01:31:38.714 --> 01:31:44.757
And so there's a tremendous amount of physiological change that needs to happen in order for that person to recover.

01:31:45.337 --> 01:31:53.301
And with these drugs that are now available on the street, there are levels of physiological changes that occur

01:31:54.281 --> 01:32:01.943
that you cannot blame people for in the same way that you could blame somebody who throws their life away on cocaine over three years.

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:06.445
It is just not the same at all.

01:32:07.245 --> 01:32:08.765
Oh, there's so many differences.

01:32:08.865 --> 01:32:12.787
I mean, everything you said is has truth to it.

01:32:13.267 --> 01:32:20.329
But even looking at a very simple level, we don't even need to need to you don't need to know a lick of biology, OK?

01:32:21.806 --> 01:32:27.771
The drug problems of the 1980s did not have a statistical impact on our demographics.

01:32:29.513 --> 01:32:31.594
Now they do.

01:32:31.654 --> 01:32:41.343
Now, I know most of what you said is true, but they did not cause life expectancy drops that were measured on the national level in the 80s.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.885
Yes, they impacted some areas more.

01:32:44.185 --> 01:32:46.227
And yes, it is absolutely true that some,

01:32:47.509 --> 01:32:49.851
demographics were impacted more.

01:32:50.472 --> 01:33:02.041
But even as much as the crack epidemic tended to impact impoverished Black Americans more than white Americans, on a statistical level, it did not cause life expectancy to go down.

01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:02.961
I'm not defending it.

01:33:03.402 --> 01:33:06.284
I'm just saying, now it does.

01:33:07.065 --> 01:33:11.668
So whatever has changed, okay, you don't even need to get into the biology.

01:33:12.509 --> 01:33:15.912
That data alone warrants

01:33:17.179 --> 01:33:21.142
conversation, especially since it's not even just the problem in isolation.

01:33:21.622 --> 01:33:42.657
It is then used as part of the oxygen issue, as part of a known bubble, and more people dying because of older age, and so on, to create a base of this perception where maybe people should be taking this vaccine, experimental vaccine, which then in and of itself kills more people.

01:33:43.638 --> 01:33:43.838
So

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:49.489
So the vax, not vax issue is just, well, maybe we just need a safer vaccine.

01:33:49.549 --> 01:33:57.382
I don't know if there's any discussion at all in this movie to suggest that maybe, maybe this wasn't even necessary in the first place.

01:33:58.325 --> 01:34:03.368
You know, they don't even have to take it to the point of murder with oxygen, although they should.

01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:08.190
They don't even have to go there, but they won't even, I don't even think they hinted that in this movie.

01:34:08.670 --> 01:34:10.511
It's such, it's so bad.

01:34:10.531 --> 01:34:16.354
The whole Vaxxed mission has been just misled on this movie.

01:34:16.974 --> 01:34:19.556
I'm sorry to hijack it with a lot of words there.

01:34:21.236 --> 01:34:22.957
No, you're not hijacking anything.

01:34:23.217 --> 01:34:24.938
Thank you for giving me the platform to say that.

01:34:24.978 --> 01:34:26.359
You're not hijacking anything.

01:34:27.799 --> 01:34:32.761
are playing a role of God right now and taking lives, and you cannot do that.

01:34:36.823 --> 01:34:39.824
You know, the benefit didn't outweigh anything, you know.

01:34:41.745 --> 01:34:44.086
You can't, you know, pick and choose.

01:34:44.886 --> 01:34:54.130
I pushed the other day this study that was done in Scotland and nowhere else really about how many people were killed

01:34:55.595 --> 01:35:02.759
there that were starved, that died of urinary tract infection or of thirst.

01:35:02.779 --> 01:35:10.403
And I find it really sad, actually, that more is not being said about these people.

01:35:10.503 --> 01:35:19.107
I mean... I have really good news.

01:35:19.707 --> 01:35:22.809
Today, our nation has achieved a medical miracle.

01:35:23.504 --> 01:35:27.145
We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months.

01:35:27.826 --> 01:35:31.427
This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history.

01:35:32.027 --> 01:35:36.428
The vaccines, let me say it again, are safe.

01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:38.769
They are safe.

01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:44.731
It's a really interesting message if they were really, I mean, it almost seems like they're telling you there's no good choice here.

01:35:46.072 --> 01:35:49.393
It's a really interesting message they just put out there, actually.

01:35:51.153 --> 01:35:52.294
And they are free.

01:35:53.939 --> 01:35:55.502
And they are effective.

01:35:56.565 --> 01:35:58.188
And it is that simple.

01:35:58.649 --> 01:36:04.281
The pandemic may have begun in China, but we are ending it right here in America.

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:05.840
of a

01:36:24.898 --> 01:36:29.583
the government would lie in a way that would kill millions of people or disabled millions of people.

01:36:29.623 --> 01:36:30.624
They can't fathom that.

01:36:30.764 --> 01:36:39.252
If you hadn't been vaccine injured or you didn't have a loved one and you understood that they were vaccine injured, you didn't know about how dangerous vaccines were.

01:36:39.332 --> 01:36:44.718
Robert Malone says Mary Holland and Catherine Austin Fitz are both bad guys in that 2022 substack race, says that

01:36:48.041 --> 01:36:51.964
Jane Ruby and George Webb are all bad guys too.

01:36:52.084 --> 01:36:54.066
He also says that these two ladies are bad guys.

01:36:54.606 --> 01:36:55.107
He did?

01:36:55.207 --> 01:37:04.494
Remember that for a hundred years the American public has been inculcated with these ideas vaccines are safe and effective, vaccines are safe and effective, vaccines are safe and effective.

01:37:05.055 --> 01:37:09.478
And the information about vaccine injury had been censored for a long time.

01:37:09.498 --> 01:37:09.598
Most

01:37:10.499 --> 01:37:23.229
Americans and most people around the world would have had no idea that if you got a vaccine, you could become paralyzed, you could have a stroke, you could have a neurodegenerative injury, you could die.

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:29.113
Most people, that would not enter into their consciousness that it could be that severe.

01:37:49.932 --> 01:37:54.256
I'm Claire Dooley, I'm 24 years old, and I'm the videographer on the Children's Health Defense Bus.

01:37:54.936 --> 01:38:01.482
Hi, my name is Caroline McGrady, and I am the outside manager for the Children's Health Defense Bus.

01:38:02.182 --> 01:38:07.767
I was expecting- Am I weird in thinking that the movie shouldn't be about these people at all?

01:38:08.067 --> 01:38:10.129
That they should be in the credits?

01:38:10.389 --> 01:38:12.391
Am I being weird by saying that?

01:38:12.431 --> 01:38:13.131
I don't think so.

01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:14.232
This is weird.

01:38:15.848 --> 01:38:20.851
well any opportunity to put you know attractive females on the video they're gonna do it

01:38:30.245 --> 01:38:36.248
At first, when we were listening to these stories, it was easy to isolate it to the specific hospital.

01:38:36.728 --> 01:38:43.512
But once we kept traveling and hearing the same exact story, we were absolutely shocked.

01:38:43.572 --> 01:38:45.313
And it wasn't just one, it was all.

01:38:45.493 --> 01:38:47.774
All of the hospitals were doing the exact same thing.

01:38:48.534 --> 01:38:53.497
They all came on, they all told the same exact story, and all these commonalities started rising out of it.

01:38:54.161 --> 01:39:02.945
But whenever one person after the next, after the next, after the next, comes in and says the same exact thing, you really start wondering, did these people really die of COVID?

01:39:02.965 --> 01:39:04.346
That's a nice house.

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:12.369
You're doing a great job, Grace.

01:39:12.829 --> 01:39:14.150
Grace had Down syndrome, as you know.

01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:17.011
And she could do everything.

01:39:17.091 --> 01:39:19.412
She could public speak.

01:39:19.432 --> 01:39:20.453
She played violin.

01:39:20.513 --> 01:39:21.393
She could read, write.

01:39:21.613 --> 01:39:22.674
There's nothing she couldn't do.

01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:25.010
Oh, you're doing great.

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:26.310
I taught her how to drive a car.

01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:27.371
She deer hunted with me.

01:39:30.213 --> 01:39:36.157
What happens that Grace ended up even going to hospital in the first place?

01:39:36.197 --> 01:39:39.059
Yeah, that's maybe the most important question.

01:39:42.121 --> 01:39:44.322
The most important question and they didn't answer it.

01:39:45.723 --> 01:39:47.964
What happened is on the morning of October 6th,

01:39:49.761 --> 01:40:00.534
Grace's oxygen saturation dropped to 88%, and we perceive that as an emergency because the protocol said if that number drops below 94%, admit yourself to the hospital.

01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:02.371
Did she look like she needed it?

01:40:02.391 --> 01:40:05.293
And that's the FLCCC protocol.

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:07.834
And they're not saying that in this interview.

01:40:08.034 --> 01:40:09.754
It's not that Scott didn't say it.

01:40:09.814 --> 01:40:10.995
It's that they made it edit.

01:40:11.015 --> 01:40:12.376
Did she go to hospital?

01:40:12.676 --> 01:40:13.576
No, she had a cold.

01:40:14.416 --> 01:40:23.460
Emergency room physician said, well, I think as a preventative, let's just check Grace into the hospital for three, four days, put her on oxygen and a steroid and get her home.

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.261
And I thought, well, that makes sense.

01:40:25.281 --> 01:40:26.261
Did everyone catch that?

01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:27.001
She had a cold.

01:40:28.826 --> 01:40:32.609
She would not have gone to the hospital if she had a cold.

01:40:32.829 --> 01:40:33.890
Everyone gets a cold.

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:37.592
Not even sure all the reasons why people get cold.

01:40:37.652 --> 01:40:38.473
She had a cold.

01:40:39.573 --> 01:40:42.135
Usually, we don't think go to the hospital if you have a cold.

01:40:42.655 --> 01:40:43.776
You know, you tough it out.

01:40:43.816 --> 01:40:45.297
You rest, whatever.

01:40:46.118 --> 01:40:53.063
She went to the hospital because somebody wrote a protocol regarding a pulse oximeter that spat out a number.

01:40:53.988 --> 01:40:57.390
which maybe isn't even accurate or mean anything.

01:40:58.111 --> 01:41:00.152
And Scott responded to that.

01:41:01.073 --> 01:41:10.999
That's why she went to the hospital, where if she probably just sat in a bed, I don't know, maybe took some ibuprofen, some water, some rest, she probably would have gone home.

01:41:11.659 --> 01:41:19.004
But the protocol, once you get to the hospital, wasn't just to relax, take an ibuprofen or whatever, maybe an

01:41:20.339 --> 01:41:23.300
heaven forbid, an antibiotic if someone has a temperature.

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:35.822
No, now you're getting oxygen because that stupid pulse oximeter said, oh, it's a low number, and people shouldn't get oxygen unless they, under very specific circumstances.

01:41:36.682 --> 01:41:41.583
And she got a lot of oxygen, which caused her health to rapidly deteriorate.

01:41:41.903 --> 01:41:43.224
That's the real story here.

01:41:43.344 --> 01:41:48.845
Three days, let's check her into the hospital for a few days, give her oxygen,

01:41:49.884 --> 01:41:50.805
and a steroid.

01:41:51.626 --> 01:41:55.930
And what did Robert Malone tell us that these steroids do?

01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:59.073
They suppress the immune system like a hammer.

01:42:00.354 --> 01:42:09.023
I mean, dude, it's gross because giving somebody pure oxygen and dexamethasone is exactly how you get them to get ARDS.

01:42:09.203 --> 01:42:11.145
It is disturbing.

01:42:11.685 --> 01:42:13.247
It is fricking disturbing.

01:42:14.215 --> 01:42:16.238
and I know that Scott explained it to them.

01:42:31.223 --> 01:42:35.486
that Scott said this, because Scott told you he said that, and it's not here.

01:42:36.206 --> 01:42:43.871
So somebody made a decision, one of those, I doubt it was the attractive 20-year-old girls that just gave their testimony to us.

01:42:44.251 --> 01:42:49.335
Somebody made a decision to be like, there's not enough room in here for those details to be shared.

01:42:49.455 --> 01:42:50.555
Someone made that decision.

01:42:51.556 --> 01:42:52.957
A fun day with my best buddy.

01:42:53.317 --> 01:42:56.139
She was so, she was a blessing, Polly.

01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.881
She was a special kid.

01:43:00.424 --> 01:43:05.688
Now that we have the records, we see that... Quite frankly, I'm surprised that Scott hasn't gone bananas.

01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:19.239
You know, the guy from France, all those years ago, was named De Gaulle, that also had a Down syndrome daughter who he loved his whole life as the most precious thing in the world.

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:27.766
And I don't know anybody that has a Down syndrome sibling that doesn't think they are the purest soul in the world.

01:43:29.672 --> 01:43:30.312
They're different.

01:43:30.532 --> 01:43:31.653
Obviously they're different.

01:43:31.933 --> 01:43:38.735
And they're mostly different in a way that makes regular people feel ashamed of themselves sometimes.

01:43:38.795 --> 01:43:46.237
And I think that if anything I get from Scott's description of his daughter, she was exactly one of these kinds of angels.

01:43:46.418 --> 01:43:46.898
It's just...

01:43:48.413 --> 01:43:56.478
The idea that this guy doesn't scream and yell online is absolutely a testament to how much better of a man he is than I am.

01:43:57.579 --> 01:44:01.161
A anesthesia drug called Prasodex was started on the 9th.

01:44:01.762 --> 01:44:03.363
I'm the healthcare power of attorney.

01:44:03.423 --> 01:44:06.244
Why wasn't I told what they're doing?

01:44:06.505 --> 01:44:11.508
Prasodex is supposed to only be used for 3-4 hours for anesthesia, for surgery.

01:44:12.248 --> 01:44:19.053
and the package insert for that med says that if you use it for more than 24 hours, it causes acute respiratory failure.

01:44:19.974 --> 01:44:28.200
If you look at Grace's death certificate, go all the way to October 13th, and their death certificate says, first cause of death, acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.822
So it's a cause and effect for using Procidex for more than 24 hours.

01:44:31.842 --> 01:44:33.483
She was on Procidex from October 9th.

01:44:34.304 --> 01:44:34.604
through.

01:44:34.744 --> 01:44:35.045
Thank you.

01:44:35.225 --> 01:44:36.465
I'm glad that they included that.

01:44:36.566 --> 01:44:36.846
I will.

01:44:37.186 --> 01:44:38.807
I will take back that they cut out everything.

01:44:38.867 --> 01:44:40.288
I'm glad that they at least included that.

01:44:40.308 --> 01:44:42.830
It's not the whole story, but thank God they put that in.

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.511
Yes.

01:44:44.971 --> 01:44:45.511
637 p.m.

01:44:46.172 --> 01:44:46.952
the day of her death.

01:44:47.332 --> 01:44:48.773
That's five full days.

01:44:50.414 --> 01:44:51.355
I'm a medical coder.

01:44:51.875 --> 01:44:52.596
And what does that mean?

01:44:53.076 --> 01:44:57.499
You look at medical records, every kind of medical record, all the diagnostics.

01:44:57.719 --> 01:45:02.002
You take that information and you put it into a code which goes to insurance.

01:45:02.637 --> 01:45:05.278
And that's how hospitals and physicians get paid.

01:45:05.338 --> 01:45:10.700
So if I do my job right, then the physician and the hospital make the most money and they don't get sued for fraud.

01:45:12.901 --> 01:45:16.262
I worked the ER during the start and height of COVID.

01:45:16.402 --> 01:45:19.303
I would hear patients come in if they'd have COVID.

01:45:20.236 --> 01:45:25.397
They weren't sick enough to be admitted, but sick enough to get maybe some treatment.

01:45:25.417 --> 01:45:31.818
I knew doctors were doing steroids occasionally just to help with some of the respiratory and coughing.

01:45:32.398 --> 01:45:35.599
But I would hear doctors say, sorry, there's no treatment.

01:45:35.639 --> 01:45:36.999
There's nothing we can do for you.

01:45:37.479 --> 01:45:42.480
By probably August or September, we started to see the waves of patients coming in with this respiratory.

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.401
I really think that people coming in with pneumonia from their masks

01:45:49.048 --> 01:46:05.176
if they were given dexamethasone and that's all that they can do for you, give you a steroid to decrease the symptoms and send you back home or admit you when you come back again, when you're sicker, is really, it really is a very important part of this.

01:46:05.836 --> 01:46:16.582
I can remember for many, many, almost two years straight, the guy with the bow tie, Ed Griffin or Dr. Griffin that streams with Vincent Ransom Yellow saying that,

01:46:17.342 --> 01:46:24.147
Just a reminder, at the beginning of every show for like a whole year, he was saying, just a reminder, antibiotics don't work on viral pneumonia.

01:46:24.848 --> 01:46:28.250
And he would repeat it every time he started his show.

01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:40.839
And I really believe that this is so important to understand that if for my leg infection that I had a few months ago, if I wasn't given antibiotics, I would have eventually probably died of sepsis.

01:46:40.879 --> 01:46:41.860
That's how it works.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:47:02.331
um and you can't have an advanced uh pneumonia and and have it go systemic and and have that go well like without antibiotics it's just not possible respiratory illness even then because i think the hospitals were trying to avoid overcrowding the system that we were not admitting patients like we should have

01:47:03.131 --> 01:47:13.739
The other thing that I wanted to bring up here, we're not going to get through the movie, I gotta go to basketball soon, is that I went to the doctor to get that fixed and I had to go to a crappy kind of med-express thing.

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:20.363
And that med-express thing was, how do I say it, it was...

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:33.502
It feels like a place that is very business-like and they have a lot of signs up, you know, that are very general like, you know, social distancing, we still do it here, this kind of thing.

01:47:34.022 --> 01:47:38.985
And one of the things that I noticed that was in the examination room, but also on every table in the waiting room,

01:47:39.685 --> 01:47:44.848
was a fact sheet about when antibiotics are appropriate.

01:47:45.629 --> 01:47:50.772
And one of the things that said at the top was, do not ask your doctor for antibiotics.

01:47:50.832 --> 01:47:54.315
The doctor knows when antibiotics are necessary.

01:47:54.895 --> 01:47:59.919
which is an extraordinary thing to have at the top of this piece of paper.

01:47:59.959 --> 01:48:00.239
Yes.

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:05.264
Do not ask your doctor for antibiotics, which is extraordinary.

01:48:05.364 --> 01:48:05.984
Like what?

01:48:06.745 --> 01:48:08.806
So then this sheet, I took pictures of them.

01:48:08.866 --> 01:48:12.670
I was going to do a whole show about it before, but it went into the bin of, I got to do that later.

01:48:13.150 --> 01:48:14.891
And I really think this is all,

01:48:15.612 --> 01:48:25.844
I mean, we have to, there's so much history to gather here yet, and there's so much, so many details that matter about how they were able to murder people for a couple years and get away with it.

01:48:27.173 --> 01:48:33.498
And although I think there are parts of this movie that are obviously very good, this part with Scott was pretty, pretty solid.

01:48:34.578 --> 01:48:38.921
There's just a whole bunch of this movie that's not solid and there's no excuse for it.

01:48:38.962 --> 01:48:39.502
There really isn't.

01:48:39.522 --> 01:48:41.884
They left in more than I thought.

01:48:41.924 --> 01:48:43.225
That's the first time I watched it.

01:48:43.625 --> 01:48:48.268
I heard from several people who talked with Scott that they cut out important parts.

01:48:48.628 --> 01:48:50.570
So I didn't know that they left that in.

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:55.834
They still could have mentioned the oxygen level because our talks,

01:48:56.496 --> 01:49:04.359
toxic oxygen level because, and I think that would have been better, of course, because a lot of people received supplemental oxygen.

01:49:04.379 --> 01:49:13.002
Not many people received that indiscriminate excessive use of the, was it a steroid, right?

01:49:13.142 --> 01:49:14.283
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:14.363 --> 01:49:19.004
So that was, and yeah, yeah, you're right, Jay.

01:49:19.084 --> 01:49:23.426
I mean, just giving everyone endless antibiotics is not,

01:49:24.382 --> 01:49:26.083
the cure to good health.

01:49:26.463 --> 01:49:30.724
They should be used only when necessary, but a bacterial infection.

01:49:32.385 --> 01:49:39.387
With people who already have damaged immune systems, we probably need more antibiotics than we should because we've already damaged our immune systems.

01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:42.368
That's another part to figure in.

01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:53.847
and anyways I'm sorry I know you need to get to your basketball camp and I just got pinged I need to start doing laundry too so we can continue this later if you want sure

01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:57.531
I mean, I don't know.

01:49:57.571 --> 01:50:00.233
We probably shouldn't waste much of our time on it anymore.

01:50:00.313 --> 01:50:02.475
But will you do a stream tonight?

01:50:02.515 --> 01:50:03.976
You're usually a Sunday night guy.

01:50:04.016 --> 01:50:05.097
I look forward to an 8 o'clock stream.

01:50:05.137 --> 01:50:06.338
Yeah, I may do a stream tonight.

01:50:06.398 --> 01:50:07.639
I did a little something earlier.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:11.742
There is more on later on.

01:50:11.762 --> 01:50:16.746
The only spoiler I'll give is that it does include some solid Corey time.

01:50:17.266 --> 01:50:17.307
Oh.

01:50:18.207 --> 01:50:23.373
where he will lecture us that ivermectin was the cure to the pandemic.

01:50:23.393 --> 01:50:24.254
Really?

01:50:24.274 --> 01:50:25.415
Oh, no.

01:50:25.796 --> 01:50:26.476
Oh, wow.

01:50:26.797 --> 01:50:27.397
Oh, yeah.

01:50:28.018 --> 01:50:28.619
Oh, wow.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.081
All we needed was ivermectin, baby.

01:50:31.782 --> 01:50:34.165
Well, then it looks like Brett Weinstein was right.

01:50:35.802 --> 01:50:36.102
All right.

01:50:36.142 --> 01:50:37.643
Well, I am going to cut it short.

01:50:37.683 --> 01:50:38.723
I think it's smarter that way.

01:50:38.763 --> 01:50:40.404
Otherwise, we could be here all afternoon.

01:50:41.765 --> 01:50:43.425
So where are you?

01:50:43.746 --> 01:50:45.226
Where do you want people to find you first?

01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:46.587
Are you going to go out live on YouTube?

01:50:46.627 --> 01:50:48.448
Are you doing Twitch now exclusively?

01:50:48.948 --> 01:50:52.509
I'm in a weird suspended state of my life to account now also.

01:50:52.569 --> 01:50:54.210
So nothing's been going to YouTube.

01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:56.051
I think that will change in another

01:50:57.594 --> 01:50:58.294
I'm working on it.

01:50:59.495 --> 01:51:01.056
They're being tough.

01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:04.797
But nothing, there's almost nothing on YouTube right now.

01:51:05.397 --> 01:51:14.061
So just, you know, I post copies of everything to Twitch and, not Twitch, excuse me, Rumble and BitChute.

01:51:14.882 --> 01:51:17.723
And I usually live stream to Twitch, but I can't leave it on there.

01:51:18.163 --> 01:51:21.965
You've been posting to BitChute long enough to get a sweatshirt or something already, haven't you?

01:51:22.705 --> 01:51:23.406
Believe it or not.

01:51:23.466 --> 01:51:24.726
I have like five shirts from them.

01:51:24.946 --> 01:51:39.916
Oh, wow hats, you know, unfortunately Well, i'm a i'm a big american and the european size are a little bit smaller so You know, uh, uh, you know, they're they're they're xl is like are you kidding me?

01:51:40.076 --> 01:51:40.316
Yeah.

01:51:40.336 --> 01:51:43.358
Yeah, I see you know anyways

01:51:44.842 --> 01:51:50.087
Um, yeah, no, I like, I like that platform, at least if they, I can put it up and it's, it's, it's always there.

01:51:50.128 --> 01:51:51.349
They never take anything down.

01:51:51.369 --> 01:51:52.790
They're very kind and respectful.

01:51:52.830 --> 01:52:02.860
And, uh, but yeah, uh, those two platforms and yeah, I'll stream something tonight, even if I, even if I just post something that I record today, I don't know, but all right.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:03.341
Thank you for this.

01:52:03.421 --> 01:52:04.001
I appreciate it.

01:52:04.041 --> 01:52:05.002
Keep up the great work, man.

01:52:05.022 --> 01:52:05.423
You bet.

01:52:05.463 --> 01:52:05.943
Thanks dude.

01:52:06.063 --> 01:52:06.464
See you soon.

01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:17.778
Ladies and gentlemen, we need a vaccine, a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America, about transfection, about RNA.

01:52:18.578 --> 01:52:27.987
If you liked what you saw, go to hucitonicits.com and find a way to share Mark's work, maybe even find a way to support him on Patreon, something like that.

01:52:28.507 --> 01:52:35.208
And if you like the work that I'm doing, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support this stream or share it as well.

01:52:35.848 --> 01:52:50.451
And if you have any critiques about how stream.gigaohm.bio works or how it's organized or what could be better, please post something at the soapbox and let me know because if it's not working well live, if it's not working well on the replay, we need to figure it out.

01:52:50.491 --> 01:52:52.731
Maybe we need to upgrade the server, et cetera.

01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:53.971
Thank you very much for coming.

01:52:54.592 --> 01:52:56.892
Have a great Sunday and I will see you again tomorrow.

01:52:58.212 --> 01:53:02.855
A brief one in the afternoon, because in the morning I think I have an away game tomorrow.

01:53:03.355 --> 01:53:20.044
And also maybe an away game on Tuesday, because Tuesday is the UK Doctors for COVID Ethics, where I will be speaking with Sukrit Bhakti, which is a really, really, I hope is going to be like a really awakening moment, you know, where we get

01:53:21.874 --> 01:53:24.540
We have some clarity, so I don't know.

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.923
Tuesday could be a big deal.

01:53:27.907 --> 01:53:29.070
And I don't know.

01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:30.112
Anyway, thanks, Mark.

01:53:30.232 --> 01:53:30.934
Thanks, everybody.

01:53:30.954 --> 01:53:31.715
See you again soon.

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:11.580
Aw, shoot.

01:54:12.066 --> 01:54:12.450
Dum-dum.
