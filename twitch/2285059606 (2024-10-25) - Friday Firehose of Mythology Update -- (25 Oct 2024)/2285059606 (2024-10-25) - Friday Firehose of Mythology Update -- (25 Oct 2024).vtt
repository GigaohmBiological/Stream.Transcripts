00:21.254 --> 00:21.554
and and

01:18.331 --> 01:27.699
And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, I need a caretaker.

01:30.962 --> 01:31.922
So God made a farmer.

01:34.785 --> 01:43.612
God said, I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board.

01:43.692 --> 01:44.613
So God made a farmer.

01:48.374 --> 01:52.936
I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.

01:53.216 --> 02:03.299
Somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to wait lunch until his wife's done feeding visiting ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon, and mean it."

02:03.619 --> 02:04.580
So God made a farmer.

02:09.441 --> 02:17.724
God said, I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt and watch it die, then dry his eyes and say, maybe next year.

02:19.634 --> 02:35.459
I need somebody who can shape an axe handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make harness out of hay wire, feed sacks, and shoe scraps, who, planting time and harvest season, will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then pain in from tractor back put in another 72 hours."

02:35.539 --> 02:36.500
So God made a farmer.

02:39.081 --> 02:49.104
God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor's place.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.630
So God made a farmer.

02:53.611 --> 03:05.318
God said, I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to yeen lambs and wean pigs and tend the pink-combed pullets who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow lark.

03:06.348 --> 03:20.975
It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners, somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake, and disc, and plow, and plant, and tie the fleece, and strain the milk, and replenish the self-feeder, and finish a hard week's work with a five-mile drive to church.

03:22.416 --> 03:35.542
Somebody who'd bail a family together with a soft, strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says,

03:36.800 --> 03:41.084
that he wants to spend his life doing what Dad does.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.227
So God made a farmer.

04:04.565 --> 04:04.946
you you

04:44.168 --> 04:44.470
you

05:20.367 --> 05:20.607
Oh.

05:48.171 --> 06:09.610
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.152
But I know for sure

06:12.537 --> 06:29.985
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.643
Testing, test, test, test, test, test.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.504
Testing one, two, test.

06:53.604 --> 06:55.525
Test one, two, testing.

06:56.006 --> 06:57.727
Test one, two, all of them.

06:59.308 --> 07:01.049
The title of today is all of them.

07:01.089 --> 07:04.271
I put Friday fire hose because I wasn't really sure what I was going to do.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.452
And then suddenly something fell in my lap.

07:07.473 --> 07:08.593
And so I decided to do it.

07:08.973 --> 07:09.674
So here we go.

07:10.014 --> 07:13.116
All of them is the title of this little get down.

07:14.477 --> 07:14.917
All of them.

08:00.615 --> 08:04.240
Only to be with you.

08:05.321 --> 08:07.203
Only to be with you.

08:24.915 --> 08:35.344
These city walls, these city walls are meant to be with you.

08:35.384 --> 08:44.953
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

08:46.414 --> 08:52.139
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

08:56.809 --> 09:20.404
Heart and lips, velvet healing Fingertips, they burn like fire This burning desire I have spoken with a ton of angels I have held the hand of a devil

09:43.786 --> 09:44.408
♪ But still ♪

10:39.424 --> 10:39.545
Okay.

11:07.654 --> 11:09.197
You haven't found.

12:26.421 --> 12:28.402
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

12:29.483 --> 12:34.225
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.346
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

12:39.046 --> 12:39.694
It's embarrassing.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.532
Oh, I love it, you guys.

12:52.612 --> 12:53.492
I really love it.

12:54.813 --> 12:58.154
Believe it or not, I got a reason why I played you too.

13:00.075 --> 13:06.758
We are back in the hamster wheel as always, jumping out of bed, running to work, doing our thing and going back to bed again.

13:06.778 --> 13:09.220
I hope this message finds you well.

13:10.360 --> 13:16.563
I hope your consciousness is not being sold to the highest bidder on social media for too long today.

13:17.283 --> 13:29.788
I hope that you are slowly but surely working to take back the control that these charlatans have over us and the power that they have because they inherited it.

13:31.693 --> 13:37.379
I hope that you have removed yourself or have begun to remove yourself from the illusion of social media.

13:38.279 --> 13:51.532
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, transfection in healthy humans was always criminal, and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are non-pattern integrities.

13:52.826 --> 14:10.584
It's pretty easy to say it and it's pretty easy to see it once you realize that these smart people have been keeping us pretty passive and obedient by participating in a very lively debate within a limited spectrum that keeps us trapped inside of an illusion, inside of an elaborate mystery mythology.

14:11.444 --> 14:28.759
um they first set us out all alone we hitchhiked and no matter whose car we got in we were going to be told this mystery virus narrative we were going to be told that this was what was going on that the excess deaths could be explained and in fact they can be explained by a whole long list of

14:29.660 --> 14:54.881
of lies about murder and those lies about murder extend to the point where there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and those lies about murder extend to the point where the lawyers that are on our side that purport to be fighting for our grandchildren are actually not because there's some basics some basic arguments they're not making and we've we've dropped a few of those uh the other day in a stream called dear Aaron

14:55.721 --> 14:57.122
If you haven't seen it, please do.

14:57.162 --> 15:05.789
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, about what transfection is and what it always was, and whether RNA can or cannot pandemic.

15:06.549 --> 15:13.374
This illusion of consensus created by these people with the purple and the blue and the red ideas, they're all there to mislead the young.

15:13.414 --> 15:22.060
And most importantly, most importantly, make sure that you understand that they are there to make sure that we teach the young.

15:22.941 --> 15:23.561
That's what it is.

15:23.621 --> 15:31.346
They're coercing adults into teaching the young that this illusion of consensus represents a real reality.

15:32.207 --> 15:41.553
And it doesn't really matter what exact spin on it, what exact sales pitch you choose to use, you're always going to be teaching your kids

15:42.529 --> 15:53.543
a version of this illusion of consensus, which is a limited spectrum of debate, which is how this new totalitarianism is constructed and how our children will be enslaved.

15:54.642 --> 15:56.983
And so it's, our role is still vital.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.883
That's why I have that slide in the beginning.

15:59.063 --> 16:12.408
Our role is to learn from these highly trained acolytes, accept the questions that these acolytes say are important, and then teach our children how those questions are being answered in real time.

16:13.208 --> 16:19.990
So that by the time we realize that it is too late and our children are enslaved like we were,

16:21.502 --> 16:28.427
And right now we have to deal with this added layer of social media and weaponized piles of money using social media against us.

16:29.328 --> 16:33.952
And we have this problem of trying to understand how social media is used against us.

16:34.012 --> 16:38.855
It is a group of people agreeing that other groups of people have the right idea.

16:39.316 --> 16:48.063
And by participating in this, we accept everything about what they're talking about and all of the problems and mysteries.

16:48.723 --> 16:51.066
that they agree are real, ladies and gentlemen.

16:51.086 --> 16:52.187
My name is Jonathan Couey.

16:52.207 --> 16:54.931
I'm a recovering academic biologist.

16:54.991 --> 16:58.455
I was a patch clamp physiologist and a biophysicist.

16:59.196 --> 17:03.782
I used to work on small conductance potassium channels and then I moved on to

17:06.125 --> 17:13.730
brain slices and studying neuronal circuitry in preps and also in live mice.

17:13.810 --> 17:16.812
There's a long record of that work on PubMed.

17:17.733 --> 17:24.898
Most of it's in vitro, but regardless, the name comes from that work, the gigaohm seal, the gigaohm biological news brief.

17:26.222 --> 17:33.284
You can find all of the recent work that we've done for the last, I don't know, let's say nine months or so on stream.gigaohm.bio slash home.

17:34.464 --> 17:36.385
There's the course we're working on building.

17:36.545 --> 17:44.307
It takes more reading than you might think to try to make a real biology 101 substitute or replacement or recovery course.

17:44.927 --> 17:49.768
There is an archive of significant videos and also an archive of my friend Housatonic Live there.

17:51.010 --> 17:52.252
So yeah, please check that out.

17:52.312 --> 17:57.220
Please share that, that link as the main link, maybe that you try to share.

17:57.280 --> 18:01.567
If you're going to share something, it doesn't necessarily need to be that, but that's a place where people can download it.

18:01.627 --> 18:05.033
It's a place where, um, things can be, uh,

18:06.288 --> 18:09.212
Things can be seen and viewed without having to log in.

18:09.592 --> 18:10.753
It works pretty smooth.

18:11.735 --> 18:14.818
I know that it can be glitchy, you need to sometimes refresh it.

18:15.940 --> 18:19.364
But I do think overall it's a pretty decent platform for a...

18:21.511 --> 18:23.652
amateur kind of, you know, just our thing.

18:24.092 --> 18:28.493
Peertube is a open source deal on GitHub that you can see how it works.

18:28.533 --> 18:32.255
You could also, I guess, go there and get the code and find out how hackable it is or something like that.

18:32.995 --> 18:35.676
I haven't updated the support list in a while.

18:35.776 --> 18:36.756
It's over there, I guess.

18:37.876 --> 18:39.217
And I apologize for that.

18:39.457 --> 18:45.259
But we are making preparations for not this weekend, but next weekend when we're having our first live live

18:46.879 --> 18:50.480
There are people coming from as far away as Switzerland to be here.

18:51.321 --> 18:53.881
There are some people that are threatening to come from Canada.

18:54.782 --> 19:07.206
And there are also some people that are coming in for the Brownstone meeting that may be altering their schedule or already being here until Monday, having Sunday wide open for, you know, sightseeing and that kind of thing.

19:07.566 --> 19:11.127
And it might be the perfect time to catch these people and get them out to Bethel Park.

19:11.807 --> 19:12.988
I hope you'll take the risk.

19:13.448 --> 19:17.190
We're not charging for entry or anything like that.

19:17.230 --> 19:23.813
There's a 250 person capacity and we're at about 25 right now, give or take 40.

19:24.273 --> 19:28.595
So if all the people that say they're coming are coming, I think we'll still have plenty of room.

19:29.235 --> 19:34.898
We might run out of some of the gift bags or we might not have as many door prizes as people come in.

19:36.138 --> 19:39.540
But, you know, it's going to be one of those things I've tried to make it very clear.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.321
You should not expect anything.

19:42.362 --> 19:48.145
You should come to this as a kind of family gathering that you don't have very high expectations for the food.

19:48.585 --> 19:50.066
And I think you'll be satisfied.

19:50.586 --> 19:54.768
Scott Schara will be there as the keynote speaker with his wife.

19:55.809 --> 20:01.672
And we also have Mark Kulak, president of Housatonic ITS, who's doing brilliant work right now,

20:03.073 --> 20:14.681
And Joe Marshall from the Liberty Perspective on Rumble, who I think also does very strong work, especially with regard to the kind of language games that are played.

20:14.701 --> 20:19.165
And you may or may not be aware of this, but Joe has a book, it's called The Last Call for Liberty.

20:19.245 --> 20:21.166
You can find that also on his website.

20:21.807 --> 20:23.868
And so it's the Liberty Perspective on Rumble.

20:24.489 --> 20:29.833
And Scott Shara has a Rumble channel called Deprogramming with Grace's Dad.

20:31.434 --> 20:37.777
And of course you can find Housatonic in a lot of places, Bitchute, Odyssey, Rumble.

20:37.837 --> 20:42.840
He's kind of one of those dudes who knows how to put his stuff in lots of places.

20:45.182 --> 20:49.967
You know, after five years of developing these kinds of habits and sticking to them, you get pretty good at it.

20:50.007 --> 21:01.417
Mark's one of those guys that, you know, his archive is another example where you just, you know, you do it and you keep doing it and you do it with a certain level of organization and a certain level of attention to detail.

21:01.457 --> 21:04.700
And after five years, you can have a pretty impressive sandbox.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.662
You can have a pretty impressive sandcastle.

21:06.702 --> 21:07.863
You can have a pretty impressive,

21:08.644 --> 21:09.605
I don't know, greenhouse.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.346
You can have a pretty impressive backyard.

21:11.466 --> 21:23.054
And so what that website, in my humble opinion, represents is just a very meticulous, thorough, and also relentless kind of pursuit of archiving the truth.

21:23.134 --> 21:25.035
And so kudos to Mark.

21:26.796 --> 21:43.085
I know he's probably on a roof not hearing this, but anyway, I'm just really happy that a lot of these friends of mine that I've met from a distance and seen from a distance and brought into my life from a distance are all going to come together and be some of them even in my house for dinner.

21:43.145 --> 21:43.965
It's just really great.

21:44.385 --> 21:45.627
I'm really excited about that.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.068
That's November 3rd.

21:47.128 --> 21:55.035
And remember that if you really wanted to throw money out the window, you could spend like $500 on a ticket and attend the Brownstone meeting for two days.

21:55.075 --> 22:03.103
That would be Friday all day and Saturday all day and see, you know, exciting panels on science like Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein.

22:04.864 --> 22:07.306
I'm not sure what I'm going to do while I'm there.

22:07.367 --> 22:12.171
I might put headphones in if I can't handle it anymore and click the noise reduction on.

22:12.471 --> 22:12.792
I don't know.

22:13.592 --> 22:20.119
But I'm excited about the weekend because of how many friends are coming together, how many people are going to be in our house and around our neighborhood.

22:20.159 --> 22:21.760
And that's just really exciting.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.444
So the title of today's show is All of Them.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.927
That should probably be a capital T there.

22:31.307 --> 22:53.155
and all of them end up working for the slavers is actually the under thing there and that's why I thought it would be really funny to start the show with you too because I don't think if you go all the way back to war or to some of their other earlier albums now they're all slipping my mind I used to really like you too when I was a lifeguard on a beach

22:54.055 --> 22:57.677
Lake Wasota and on the Yellow River in Kadat, Wisconsin.

22:58.738 --> 23:02.801
And if you look that up on Google or anywhere else, you're going to find that I was not a Baywatch lifeguard.

23:02.841 --> 23:05.942
I worked on the side of a river, so it was pretty mundane.

23:06.002 --> 23:09.665
Sometimes there would be as many as eight little kids in the water with a couple parents.

23:10.625 --> 23:14.788
It was not a huge beach, but it was a wonderful summer job.

23:15.529 --> 23:18.551
Anyway, and I listened to a lot of radio at that time.

23:18.811 --> 23:26.276
And at that time, you know, U2, I think, was still kind of just a pop band from Ireland or wherever they're from.

23:26.917 --> 23:30.039
Anyway, all of them eventually work for the slavers.

23:30.119 --> 23:36.123
And I think today what I want to do is especially try to address this slide.

23:36.183 --> 23:36.744
Sorry about that.

23:37.184 --> 23:39.105
This slide that I used in the beginning

23:40.186 --> 23:42.508
which is this is skillful social media use.

23:42.548 --> 23:48.973
You see this guy sitting in an elaborate chair that moves around in response to his joystick movements and to his pedal inputs.

23:49.594 --> 23:56.599
And the goggles, although there's a screen in front of him, the goggles are actually providing him with a 3D view that's responsive to his head position.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.764
And so it's a very engaging sort of starship battle.

24:02.444 --> 24:17.262
and in reality that is what x is that especially something like x but also telegram or any of these other places like signal where you think you're in a group with a group of people when in reality you've gone into a theater

24:18.283 --> 24:33.517
and a magic show and a lot of the people that are in the audience are also in on the gag and so if the audience members all go like that you shouldn't be so surprised because actually they're working with the people on stage if some of the audience members pretend to

24:34.578 --> 24:42.082
inhale a gas and die, you shouldn't be surprised because there are audience members that are part of the show, but you're not aware of it.

24:42.402 --> 24:47.064
That's how intense some of these social media platforms have become.

24:47.144 --> 24:57.069
A Discord server, for example, or a Telegram group, or even a Signal Chat could be 150 members of which only eight are real.

24:58.007 --> 25:06.550
And yet you are being led to believe that this is a spontaneous assembly of people that all think the same and are arguing and discussing things.

25:07.030 --> 25:22.955
And on this level of deception and military operation, you can never know for sure unless every one of those people in that group is somebody that you sat down at a table with, that you have their cell phone number, that you also exchange emails with, and they're the only people in that group chat.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.776
Otherwise, you've got no idea.

25:25.516 --> 25:26.656
Absolutely none.

25:27.116 --> 25:38.239
And that is true, especially for DM groups on Twitter, where half of them could be anonymous, in Discord servers, or in Telegram groups, or in signal chats.

25:38.379 --> 25:47.241
It's extraordinary how vulnerable we are to this manipulation, this illusion of consensus that is not at all a consensus.

25:47.301 --> 25:53.062
It could be only three people pretending to be 12 that invited you into that signal chat just for you.

25:56.286 --> 25:58.570
I think that this has happened to me more than once.

25:58.851 --> 26:03.379
And so all of them is a keep it real study hall, actually.

26:03.560 --> 26:07.868
And the reason why I say keep it real is because I want to look at a particular podcast

26:09.252 --> 26:19.360
called the Keep It Real podcast because it caught my attention and it I think presents a very teachable moment here in terms of how this is done.

26:19.400 --> 26:27.307
Now remember I started the stream with you two and I tried to make the argument that you two probably all wasn't always working for the UN.

26:28.147 --> 26:37.952
U2 probably wasn't always sold out to George Soros or to Blackwater or Blackrock or State Street or whoever they're sold out to.

26:38.332 --> 26:41.754
They weren't always on the team of the WEF.

26:41.814 --> 26:42.634
I'm sure of it.

26:43.795 --> 26:45.596
Because that's not how this works.

26:47.113 --> 26:52.896
And so the person that got my attention was actually somebody who I did not download the video.

26:52.916 --> 26:53.716
I was going to do that.

26:54.456 --> 27:13.885
But the first time that she caught my attention was actually, um, when number one, it seemed like she popped up in my, in my YouTube algorithm, even though I don't really have any fitness people in my YouTube algorithm, I only have

27:15.336 --> 27:18.718
The only thing I ever really click on are basketball coaches or basketball drills.

27:18.898 --> 27:23.461
I've never clicked on yoga or anything like that.

27:23.601 --> 27:28.203
I don't have, even though my wife has a YouTube channel that's yoga, I don't have that.

27:28.243 --> 27:31.825
And my stream or my feed on YouTube is curated.

27:31.885 --> 27:34.367
Like I tell it all the time, don't show me that.

27:35.027 --> 27:41.611
And so it was weird that this program popped in and that was a while back already, maybe two months ago.

27:42.639 --> 27:46.681
But then this week I saw this podcast pop in, it's called Keep It Real.

27:47.682 --> 27:54.746
And this podcast, I got the pink line there, you know, my life has never been the same and it was a vaccine injury lady.

27:55.326 --> 28:02.130
Now, the reason why this I found curious was because this vaccine injury lady was promoted by CHD recently.

28:03.550 --> 28:06.373
And so I recognized the face instantly.

28:06.873 --> 28:14.160
And so I went to this podcast and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it just absolutely blew my mind.

28:14.220 --> 28:17.884
I was like, how is it possible that all these words are being put together like this now?

28:18.928 --> 28:23.971
in 2024 by this person who, where did she catch my eye?

28:24.051 --> 28:35.238
She caught my eye because she was part of this most recent Senate hearing where this brother and sister, son-worshiping doctor siblings were there.

28:36.158 --> 28:38.780
And Jordan Peterson's daughter was there.

28:39.600 --> 28:44.463
And this lady was there, this Jillian Michaels or something like that, the one on the right.

28:45.304 --> 28:47.345
And then the vaccine injured one is on the left.

28:48.274 --> 28:50.315
And so I just went to her YouTube channel.

28:50.976 --> 28:58.962
I'm like, what is striking me as strange immediately was obvious because the first episode that I just noticed was episode 14.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.523
Episode 13 is with Dave Rubin.

29:01.703 --> 29:02.124
Uh-oh.

29:04.085 --> 29:06.987
And episode 12 was with Anna Kasparian.

29:07.047 --> 29:14.953
She's that person who just recently decided that she was gonna go from the blue team to the red team, like a few other people we know.

29:16.246 --> 29:19.913
And episode nine was with Matt Walsh.

29:20.374 --> 29:26.025
Oh, now I know that that guy is probably connected to some of this.

29:26.986 --> 29:28.846
theater on the internet.

29:29.046 --> 29:36.988
I'm pretty sure that Ruben is connected to Bret Weinstein directly as a founding member of the intellectual dark web.

29:37.008 --> 29:42.569
He's in the original photo with Peterson and Rogan and Shapiro.

29:43.390 --> 29:44.430
It's strange, right?

29:44.490 --> 29:49.711
So I keep looking and then, oh, episode five is Sabine Hazan

29:51.561 --> 29:59.563
who's this gut microbiome lady who, her claim to fame, the reason why anybody paid attention to her in the first place, do you remember?

30:00.083 --> 30:05.225
Is because she sequenced the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 from a gut sample.

30:05.705 --> 30:06.625
That's correct.

30:06.685 --> 30:07.765
I bet you didn't know that.

30:08.185 --> 30:09.806
That was her first claim to fame.

30:09.846 --> 30:18.148
And then she was talking about how people that take the shot are losing the bifidobacteria or whatever she's saying now.

30:19.048 --> 30:35.519
and you know she just casually admits that she's involved in over 200 clinical trials right now um so then i go to episode four and i'm like oh no you got to be kidding me episode four keeping it real with julian michaels is with drew pinsky in a shiny suit

30:38.443 --> 30:43.745
Oh, and then it gets worse, of course, because episode two is actually with Callie Means.

30:43.825 --> 31:00.092
This is the guy, the brother of the girl who were both on Tucker and who both got to go on Joe Rogan and who both were in front of Senator Ron Johnson's committee with Bobby Kennedy Jr.

31:02.033 --> 31:03.433
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:04.954 --> 31:07.635
and all these people were just in front of

31:08.769 --> 31:14.431
the Senate before or more recently, she more recently, him more recently, these two more recently.

31:14.451 --> 31:20.413
It might've even been the same week of this podcast for all I know, because that's all in 2024.

31:23.474 --> 31:24.755
So here's where it gets crazy.

31:24.815 --> 31:28.276
The very first podcast episode is with Michael Schellenberger.

31:28.316 --> 31:34.658
You can find some pretty interesting podcasts with none other than Brett Weinstein and Michael Schellenberger.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.859
Michael Schellenberger was running for something.

31:40.049 --> 32:07.635
that's her very first podcast i think it says two months ago there could be three but it's all in 2024 you can see the pink lines right so what i mean with all of them eventually at some point work for the slavers is exactly why i chose that um youtube song youtube you too song for the beginning uh

32:08.701 --> 32:28.928
beginning tunes because at some point YouTube was recruited by the weaponized piles of money and their acolytes to be part of the ruling structure on social media, the ruling structure on television, the ruling structure of the world, and they gladly accepted.

32:28.968 --> 32:36.570
I don't know if the whole band accepted or just Bono, but they weren't always part of the show.

32:37.546 --> 32:40.267
And I don't think she was always part of the show.

32:40.307 --> 32:52.912
In fact, if we go back to 2019, you will see that it's fitness video after fitness video, and most of the thumbnails are her on a fitness mat.

32:55.253 --> 32:58.515
And there's actually five years of this.

32:59.355 --> 33:01.756
Some of the videos get hundreds of thousands of views.

33:01.816 --> 33:04.437
Some only get 30,000 views in five years.

33:04.517 --> 33:06.358
But she has been busy.

33:08.649 --> 33:11.770
And she has a whole catalog of work that she has done.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.690
It looks like she's kept herself in shape.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.790
She looks like she's tried to share it with others.

33:16.290 --> 33:18.451
She looks like a legit cool lady.

33:21.951 --> 33:25.432
And then I thought to myself, well, then what happened during the pandemic?

33:25.492 --> 33:27.292
And so I just kept looking.

33:27.332 --> 33:30.333
You can go through everybody's entire video catalog, right?

33:30.353 --> 33:33.714
All the videos that are not private are just listed in chronological order.

33:33.754 --> 33:36.094
If you go to the video tab on their channel.

33:37.472 --> 33:41.834
So you go fast forward to 2021 and the Keep It Real podcast.

33:41.854 --> 33:50.377
Here's the number one, if you can see my arrow, here's the number one episode that was two months ago with Michael Schellenberger that I have right here.

33:50.878 --> 33:54.859
And if I go back to 2021, I see this little episode right down here.

33:54.899 --> 33:56.140
There's all, can you see all the...

33:57.020 --> 33:58.300
Can you see all the fitnesses?

33:58.380 --> 34:01.401
Fitness, fitness, fitness, fitness, fitness, fitness.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.162
She's got the same black outfit on.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.622
She looks like she could kick my ass.

34:05.803 --> 34:08.303
Like she's a hard fitness lady.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.504
But right down here, I see something really funny.

34:13.205 --> 34:13.705
What is that?

34:17.086 --> 34:17.206
Oh.

34:18.186 --> 34:24.808
Virologist Vincent Ranson Yellow on vaccine side effects, booster shots, antivirals, and more with Jillian Michaels.

34:27.153 --> 34:29.073
And several months later, what is this?

34:29.694 --> 34:37.095
Two or three years later, we've got, keeping it real, the first episode with Michael Schellenberger.

34:38.295 --> 34:38.615
Hmm.

34:39.416 --> 34:41.556
So I don't think she was always on the bad team.

34:41.596 --> 34:43.796
I don't even know if she knows she's on the bad team.

34:44.297 --> 34:49.278
Somebody might've just said, hey, we see that you've been on YouTube for a long time, but you're not really getting anywhere.

34:49.638 --> 34:50.778
Are you kind of giving up on it?

34:52.213 --> 35:16.077
we're looking for some new people and we got a whole lineup of guests for you if you can interview them and you know be cool that's how it works that's how it might have worked with me had i shown the right propensity to tell the right stories to accept the right mentors to accept the right direction this might have been me

35:18.763 --> 35:26.450
I might've been given a whole list of people that I just had to call and they would appear on my show and I could just do podcasts and it would rise.

35:30.113 --> 35:35.077
She's got one that has over 700,000 views now with Matt Walsh.

35:35.137 --> 35:40.402
So, you know, she's got a few, she's doing better than she did before by maybe a factor of 10 with some videos.

35:41.623 --> 35:43.305
And again, I'm not saying she's bad.

35:44.386 --> 35:45.807
I'm saying this is how it works.

35:48.550 --> 35:53.253
And so was Vincent on her show to find out whether she would be a good one for that side?

35:54.254 --> 36:01.578
Was he trying to figure out, okay, is this gonna be a lady that we can use or is this gonna be a lady that Robert Malone's team's gonna have to use?

36:01.998 --> 36:04.320
Maybe I'll go on her stream first and see what's up.

36:06.861 --> 36:11.304
So that's where we are, keeping it real, all of them study hall.

36:11.344 --> 36:14.006
Let's check these videos out because I think you're gonna love them.

36:14.106 --> 36:16.868
I think you're really gonna love the insight that they provide.

36:18.213 --> 36:25.518
I think you're really going to enjoy the insight that they provide you in terms of seeing where we are and how we've been bamboozled.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.740
Just give me my hard drive a second to find all these videos.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.501
I'm going to have to empty this folder I think.

36:31.561 --> 36:32.542
It's getting too big.

36:37.925 --> 36:38.926
It's really grinding there.

36:38.966 --> 36:39.566
Sorry about that.

36:41.948 --> 36:47.231
I have to put this on a different... Good to see everybody in the chat.

36:49.175 --> 36:50.536
I'm really happy you guys are here.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.358
I don't know why this is taking so long.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.659
Why can't it find the thing?

36:53.699 --> 36:54.921
I'm just going to use this to do it.

36:55.261 --> 36:57.143
So let's do the virology one first.

37:07.887 --> 37:19.169
All right, team, today on Keeping It Real, our conversation is with Professor Vincent Racaniello from Columbia University, and he is one of the preeminent virologists

37:20.086 --> 37:24.009
in the world, literally the foremost expert.

37:24.630 --> 37:25.511
All right, team.

37:26.071 --> 37:27.612
Now remember, oops, sorry.

37:28.073 --> 37:36.520
Remember that her episode number one, Keeping It Real, was with Michael Schellenberger about two and a half months ago or three months ago.

37:37.341 --> 37:48.170
So here she is, and it's very important to see that, with already an inset logo that says Keeping It Real, as if that podcast already existed.

37:51.212 --> 37:55.634
And I think you need to consider the possibility that this was her first audition.

37:55.714 --> 38:02.737
This was her first screen test for whether or not she might be useful for the needs that they have.

38:02.857 --> 38:06.318
You know, kind of a Shannon Joy, kind of Epi Girl.

38:07.213 --> 38:24.204
you know, whatever we need kind of podcasts that will just kind of absorb with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, whatever anybody says about bifidobacteria or the censorship of doctors on the internet or something like that.

38:26.205 --> 38:28.907
I really think that's what you can see here if you look carefully.

38:29.557 --> 38:37.424
All right, team, today on Keeping It Real, our conversation is with Professor Vincent Recagniello from Columbia University.

38:37.984 --> 38:49.194
And he is one of the preeminent virologists in the world, literally the foremost expert on viruses, or one of, top of the top.

38:49.674 --> 38:51.336
So let me start.

38:51.684 --> 38:54.126
We're not gonna watch the whole video.

38:54.146 --> 39:04.672
We're just gonna watch the first 10 or 15 minutes, and then we're gonna watch the first 10 or 15 minutes of that video with the vaccine person that just came out this week to compare where we are, right?

39:04.692 --> 39:08.255
Start by saying that, yes, of course, we're going to be talking about COVID and don't switch off.

39:09.295 --> 39:16.520
There's new information, information that's extremely hopeful and clear information, but most importantly, there is no bias.

39:17.761 --> 39:20.803
And we bring no bias to this podcast.

39:21.363 --> 39:26.231
So, for people who are not vaccinated for people who are vaccinated.

39:29.415 --> 39:30.336
respect your opinion.

39:30.356 --> 39:34.258
I understand the legitimate fears and concerns.

39:34.939 --> 39:42.944
I think it's critical that the media and the political parties get out of our health care decisions.

39:43.904 --> 39:52.270
I think the spread of misinformation because there are a variety of agendas out there are making the situation

39:53.030 --> 39:55.191
that much more difficult and that much more dangerous.

39:55.831 --> 40:08.918
So I wanted to have Professor Rockin' Yellow on to just give you pure information without bias, without an agenda, so you can make the best decision for yourself and your family.

40:09.298 --> 40:16.442
Now, I just want to point out that when I had my thing in my throat and my voice sounded like a frog, I couldn't talk like this because I would run out of breath.

40:17.461 --> 40:21.466
Um, so she sounds like she's in shape and remember that she was an athlete before this.

40:21.567 --> 40:34.243
So, um, it's, I'm just trying to make sure you see what I see to make sure that when I point out what I see again, you know, we're not, we're, we're not disagreeing, or at least, you know, what I'm talking about.

40:34.825 --> 40:40.411
And you can protect yourself and your family going forward, whether or not you choose to get the vaccine.

40:40.451 --> 40:45.295
There's still a lot that we can do, and there's still a lot to know.

40:46.036 --> 40:50.020
So we're gonna jump right in with Professor Vincent Racaniello.

40:51.696 --> 40:55.239
All right, guys, we are back with Professor Vincent Racaniello.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.062
And we are going to- He doesn't look comfortable.

40:58.142 --> 41:02.045
From the very first moment, he doesn't look comfortable and he will never look comfortable.

41:02.105 --> 41:02.906
Just notice that.

41:03.146 --> 41:05.148
We're talking about all things viruses.

41:05.868 --> 41:07.229
Yes, COVID is included.

41:07.370 --> 41:08.971
Yes, the vaccine is included.

41:10.232 --> 41:17.738
And Professor Racaniello, as you know, as I mentioned, I saw you on one of my favorite podcasts, Lex Fridman's podcast.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.201
Lex Friedman!

41:20.301 --> 41:21.542
Lex Friedman!

41:23.785 --> 41:24.526
That is funny.

41:26.127 --> 41:28.250
That's also, you know, that's a sign.

41:29.591 --> 41:30.332
That's a sign.

41:30.392 --> 41:31.553
That's like saying Twitter.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.175
I like Twitter.

41:34.236 --> 41:38.861
And you explained viruses, vaccines,

41:39.963 --> 41:47.848
And he actually explained that, number one, his wife worked on ivermectin for 20 years at Merck on Lex Friedman's podcast.

41:47.908 --> 41:59.535
Number two, he also explained on Lex Friedman's podcast, the three-hour version of it, that ivermectin was being tested in conjunction with remdesivir at some hospitals in New York City.

42:01.394 --> 42:02.995
Go ahead and find it for yourself.

42:03.556 --> 42:06.958
I don't watch those podcasts for nothing, and I remember when I watch.

42:07.519 --> 42:11.422
And when he was on the Lex Friedman podcast, those are two big takeaways.

42:12.263 --> 42:22.531
His wife worked for Merck on ivermectin for 20 years, and two, ivermectin was being tested with remdesivir in hospitals in New York City.

42:23.823 --> 42:32.791
everything in between in a way that I've never heard anyone do that made it very clear, very concise, and was totally unbiased.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.373
So first off, welcome to the show.

42:35.954 --> 42:36.734
Thank you for having me.

42:37.575 --> 42:47.684
And you were mentioning to me just a moment ago, that you have about 100,000 subscribers to your YouTube channel on your podcast.

42:48.865 --> 42:50.647
And it's called This Week in Virology.

42:51.834 --> 42:52.214
That's right.

42:52.234 --> 42:53.915
That's one of the podcasts we do.

42:54.075 --> 43:00.839
And because of the pandemic, as you might guess, we've had a huge jump in the number of people listening in.

43:00.919 --> 43:02.580
So we're about to hit that magic number, 100K.

43:04.065 --> 43:11.533
Um, but a hundred thousand subscribers for a podcast on virology, I think says a lot more about you.

43:11.553 --> 43:14.676
Do you see what I mean by, by it?

43:14.736 --> 43:22.284
We need somebody who can respond to the guests with enthusiasm and make it really seem significant.

43:22.445 --> 43:23.045
Wow.

43:24.073 --> 43:24.833
That's what we need.

43:24.893 --> 43:25.954
Can you do that for us?

43:26.234 --> 43:30.136
Then the pandemic, because there's so much information out there right now.

43:31.357 --> 43:45.085
And the fact that you've aggregated an audience when there's so much noise out there says so much about the way you communicate your information, which is another reason I'm so excited to have you on.

43:45.785 --> 43:47.626
So I want to start from the beginning.

43:48.587 --> 43:52.589
I think most of us don't even know what a virus is, right?

43:53.851 --> 43:54.031
Yeah.

43:54.291 --> 43:55.052
Is it an animal?

43:56.233 --> 43:56.834
What is it?

43:57.194 --> 43:58.695
What actually is it?

43:58.715 --> 43:59.456
That's a good question.

43:59.716 --> 44:02.658
It's something different from everything else.

44:03.641 --> 44:08.345
It's something really small you can't see that is not a cell.

44:08.445 --> 44:09.846
So we're made of cells, right?

44:10.146 --> 44:11.007
It's not a cell.

44:11.067 --> 44:11.928
It's much smaller.

44:12.729 --> 44:16.171
It's a little piece of nucleic acid, right?

44:17.072 --> 44:18.053
DNA or RNA.

44:18.073 --> 44:24.618
It's a little piece of that wrapped up in a protein and it needs to get inside of a cell to make more of itself.

44:25.532 --> 44:26.753
And that's what a virus is.

44:26.813 --> 44:40.162
And the thing that really surprised me when the whole pandemic began, and we began to talk to way more people, is that most people don't realize that they're all over, that you're full of them.

44:40.223 --> 44:42.524
You, Jillian, have many viruses in you.

44:42.684 --> 44:44.205
I do right now, and we're okay.

44:44.245 --> 44:46.487
And every living thing on the planet has viruses.

44:47.187 --> 44:48.208
That's just the way it is.

44:48.448 --> 44:49.069
They're everywhere.

44:50.874 --> 44:55.698
What makes one out of the, I don't know, should I say trillions?

44:56.078 --> 45:04.485
I mean, I remember you mentioning something about seawater having gazillions of viruses in a tablespoon or something.

45:05.065 --> 45:06.086
I'm sure I'm getting this wrong.

45:06.106 --> 45:11.451
This is from the, I'm paraphrasing what I remember from Lex's podcast, but I remember being

45:12.733 --> 45:16.877
Say Lex again, say Lex again, I dare you.

45:17.457 --> 45:25.643
So it's like if we're surrounded by viruses and we're inundated with viruses, why is one destroying the planet?

45:26.043 --> 45:34.750
What is it about that virus or the handful of viruses that are different than the trillions of others?

45:36.051 --> 45:37.092
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

45:37.132 --> 45:39.313
So most viruses

45:40.305 --> 45:40.987
don't hurt us.

45:41.708 --> 45:43.212
They pass through us.

45:43.472 --> 45:45.958
You know, all the viruses in the ocean pretty much don't hurt us.

45:47.239 --> 45:49.701
It's the ones that are closer.

45:49.721 --> 45:54.285
So first of all, mammals like us, they have lots of viruses.

45:55.186 --> 45:59.330
And those are the ones we tend to get, and we get them by accident.

45:59.550 --> 46:04.374
So mice and bats, as you know, they have a ton of viruses.

46:05.015 --> 46:09.539
And should we encounter them, we could get their viruses.

46:09.579 --> 46:12.021
So we get viruses from mice now and then.

46:12.942 --> 46:14.443
and everybody has mice in their house.

46:15.483 --> 46:18.744
I catch them all the time and I'm risking getting some virus.

46:19.024 --> 46:25.786
And it's just by accident that they have some virus that happens to be able to infect humans.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.006
It's just an accident.

46:27.586 --> 46:32.588
There's no point to it because those mice have their own viruses and the viruses do really well in mice.

46:33.328 --> 46:38.514
But if a human touches the mouse or if a human touches a bat, it might get one of their viruses.

46:39.034 --> 46:45.882
And every now and then, it just happens to be the right one to take off and infect lots and lots of people.

46:45.922 --> 46:47.343
So it's just an accident.

46:47.904 --> 46:48.845
There's nothing more than that.

46:49.716 --> 46:50.897
So that's fair.

46:52.038 --> 46:52.999
I can follow that.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.902
But I'm with you so far.

46:57.243 --> 47:00.807
But OK, I've got trillions living inside me, right?

47:01.547 --> 47:02.368
Trillions, who knows?

47:02.448 --> 47:03.269
Billions, zillions?

47:03.349 --> 47:04.190
You have a lot.

47:04.210 --> 47:10.876
Why are those not taking over my cells the way COVID would take over my cells?

47:11.116 --> 47:12.678
What's I don't get?

47:14.079 --> 47:15.921
So COVID is new to us, right?

47:16.081 --> 47:18.102
It's just, wow.

47:18.142 --> 47:18.683
December, 2019.

47:18.843 --> 47:24.647
So those other viruses aren't replicating or are those viruses just replicating, but our cells don't give a shit.

47:26.088 --> 47:27.729
You see how awkward this is.

47:27.749 --> 47:29.811
I don't think that she knows any better.

47:31.172 --> 47:34.494
She's asking questions that he doesn't want her to ask.

47:36.476 --> 47:36.936
He's taught.

47:36.976 --> 47:43.361
She's talking about a background, a gigantic thick background of RNA coded

47:44.838 --> 47:46.159
lipid particles, right?

47:46.219 --> 47:47.619
Lipoprotein particles.

47:47.659 --> 48:03.887
She's talking about a very, very hot background on which supposedly we can use PCR to pull up a signal that is significantly different than that background, even though that background must be replicating in some cells.

48:05.028 --> 48:07.129
That background must be doing something.

48:09.690 --> 48:18.596
I want you to think about how significant this is already, how awkward it is already, how ham-fisted this is already.

48:20.197 --> 48:34.627
He's not even differentiating between those viral signals that are replicating in our own microbiome, the bacteria that live inside of our gut, and those viruses that might be replicating either in our epithelium or elsewhere.

48:36.533 --> 48:41.455
There may be almost no viruses that are replicating in our own cells.

48:41.516 --> 48:50.440
And the vast majority of all RNA signals at that timescale may be composed of particles that are replicating in our own microbiome.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.802
The same is potentially true for our lungs.

48:56.023 --> 48:58.204
We have a very, very big problem.

48:59.298 --> 49:07.766
But if we carefully examine the recent past, we can find really, really stark evidence for this problem exposed.

49:07.946 --> 49:17.515
And it reveals the incredible exaggeration and the lack of fidelity of understanding that is actually hidden behind this virus narrative.

49:19.577 --> 49:23.621
And so it's going to be a very awkward transition to talk about transfection and transformation.

49:24.835 --> 49:30.395
if he's already so awkward talking about this, maybe we should go back a few seconds to make sure we catch that.

49:30.976 --> 49:32.137
at their viruses.

49:32.157 --> 49:37.040
So we get viruses from mice now and then, and everybody has mice in their house.

49:38.081 --> 49:40.163
I catch them all the time and I'm risking.

49:40.383 --> 49:42.905
We get viruses from mice all the time.

49:42.985 --> 49:44.546
Everybody has mice in their house.

49:44.586 --> 49:46.047
What kind of bullshit is that?

49:46.387 --> 49:47.488
Getting some virus.

49:47.768 --> 49:54.513
And it's just by accident that they have some virus that happens to be able to infect humans.

49:54.653 --> 49:55.734
It's just an accident.

49:56.314 --> 50:01.359
There's no point to it because those mice have their own viruses and the viruses do really well in mice.

50:02.059 --> 50:07.244
But if a human touches the mouse or if a human touches a bat, it might get one of their viruses.

50:07.784 --> 50:14.630
And, you know, every now and then it just happens to be the right one to take off and infect lots and lots of people.

50:14.670 --> 50:16.071
So it's just an accident.

50:16.532 --> 50:17.593
There's nothing more than that.

50:18.453 --> 50:19.634
So that's fair.

50:20.775 --> 50:21.736
I can follow that.

50:22.497 --> 50:24.639
But I'm with you so far.

50:25.981 --> 50:29.544
But OK, I've got trillions living inside me, right?

50:30.285 --> 50:31.086
Trillions, who knows?

50:31.186 --> 50:31.986
Billions, zillions.

50:32.087 --> 50:32.907
You have a lot.

50:32.927 --> 50:39.614
Why are those not taking over my cells the way COVID would take over my cells?

50:39.854 --> 50:41.416
What's I don't get?

50:42.817 --> 50:44.618
So COVID is new to us, right?

50:44.818 --> 50:49.701
It's just, you know, December 2019 or thereabouts, it found humans.

50:49.901 --> 50:55.625
And so it's kind of feeling its way around, to put it in one way.

50:55.805 --> 50:56.925
It's not gotten used to us.

50:56.985 --> 51:06.151
All the viruses that we have in us that are okay with us and we're okay with them, they've been with us a long time, probably before we were even humans.

51:06.171 --> 51:11.734
So they've had a long time to settle things out and kind of come to an agreement, you know,

51:11.934 --> 51:25.441
So the argument actually is, I hope you can hear it, that RNA has been pandemicing continuously despite our best efforts evolutionarily to stop it.

51:26.602 --> 51:40.869
Despite all of the layers of the immune system being thrown at this signal from different species for, in their model, thousands of generations.

51:43.939 --> 51:55.923
Despite all of that effort, there's still this group of not animals, can't quite come up with the right word because if he had the right word, it wouldn't apply.

51:56.664 --> 51:58.084
They're not pattern integrities.

51:58.284 --> 51:59.685
A molecule can't do this.

51:59.725 --> 52:02.166
It doesn't matter whether they have a fear and cleavage site or not.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.826
This is nonsense.

52:05.427 --> 52:12.750
And yet here he is telling you that this process of an RNA molecule being able to pandemic has been going on

52:13.863 --> 52:18.546
in perpetuity since the beginning of our history.

52:22.228 --> 52:38.759
So this whole story is based on the same thing that we discussed the other day after the Aaron, the dear Aaron Siri part, we discussed this idea of evolution because DNA, and then now everything is solved and all the answers are genes.

52:40.771 --> 52:51.138
And what you could better call genes are gears, because if you call them gears, then it'll make a lot more sense when I say that you can't just call everything a gene.

52:51.178 --> 53:00.404
But every time somebody morphs the meaning of that word or expands the umbrella coverage that that word can signify,

53:01.607 --> 53:13.351
We are more and more admitting that this whole model of genes and determinist biology is really just the bullshit watchmaker analogy.

53:15.612 --> 53:17.652
It's a bullshit watchmaker analogy.

53:18.933 --> 53:25.735
It doesn't matter how many beautiful Swiss watches you make, how many different examples you put out there.

53:28.476 --> 53:33.160
Those aren't ever going to become more Swiss watches, not in a million years.

53:33.640 --> 53:46.230
You might inspire a bunch of people to make shittier copies that use some of the mechanisms that are in that Swiss watch, but inevitably the copies won't be as good as the original if they're not made that way.

53:47.790 --> 54:01.540
There's no way that this watch or ten Swiss watches that are let out in the wild and exposed to all the people that can make watches are going to become a hundred more complicated watches and then after that a thousand more complicated watches.

54:03.862 --> 54:05.122
Not all by themselves.

54:07.824 --> 54:09.366
And yet that is the idea.

54:10.366 --> 54:16.391
That once you have DNA then you can have evolution and you can start from one cell and get to

54:17.768 --> 54:18.048
This.

54:20.149 --> 54:29.572
That's why Teilhard de Chardin goes so all in on the pith down man and went all and would have gone all in on the discovery of DNA.

54:31.433 --> 54:39.836
Because these discoveries allow him to frame creation as a process set in motion by God.

54:41.977 --> 54:46.018
A process set in motion by God that may still be ongoing.

54:49.540 --> 54:52.402
And that revealing that truth is something that God did.

54:55.363 --> 55:05.469
So that if humankind is a phenomenon, is going to rise to the occasion that God calls it to, then we're going to have to take control of the reigns of that phenomenon.

55:07.450 --> 55:10.252
And it goes all the way back to evolution because DNA.

55:10.292 --> 55:18.357
Because if there's evolution, and evolution is the process by which God created us, then it is also a process that God bequeathed upon us.

55:19.682 --> 55:22.444
gave to us, revealed the knowledge of.

55:23.965 --> 55:27.687
And so we're under an obligation to take this responsibility seriously.

55:27.747 --> 55:38.373
That's the argument that they make in those back rooms when they bring you two in and they say, hey Bono, hey, what do they call you, the edge?

55:38.974 --> 55:41.455
Yeah, and you're the bassist and you play drums.

55:41.835 --> 55:45.798
Yeah, so we need some help with the kids.

55:47.499 --> 55:48.940
We need some help with the kids.

55:50.274 --> 55:56.877
And we're looking to get together, you know, sort of a worldwide outlook on the future.

55:58.118 --> 56:04.701
And, you know, taking care of the environment and not polluting and cleaning up stuff and feeding the poor.

56:05.122 --> 56:06.502
And you guys are kind of into that.

56:07.263 --> 56:11.705
And we'll make you rich if you help us and the UN do it.

56:13.506 --> 56:15.387
Seems innocent enough in the 90s.

56:20.461 --> 56:23.962
And so, you know, talking to the most famous virologist on earth.

56:24.042 --> 56:25.302
Oh, what an opportunity.

56:25.702 --> 56:27.143
You could start a podcast with this.

56:27.363 --> 56:28.443
Ah, what could I call it?

56:28.503 --> 56:29.263
Keeping it real.

56:29.303 --> 56:30.184
That's a great idea.

56:30.524 --> 56:34.385
Maybe I need to make a logo before Friday when I'm interviewing Vincent.

56:38.906 --> 56:42.027
It's still available on YouTube, ladies and gentlemen.

56:42.047 --> 56:44.648
You can just go find these videos and the...

56:47.423 --> 56:54.885
the sting operation becomes more and more visible the more you look with intention.

56:55.205 --> 56:59.086
I'm gonna live here, and if you let me do that, I'm not gonna hurt you.

56:59.546 --> 57:01.646
That's kind of the agreement that's been worked out.

57:01.686 --> 57:04.507
Of course, it doesn't work that way, but that's the way I look at it.

57:04.787 --> 57:11.028
Whereas SARS-CoV-2 is brand new to people, and we're still negotiating.

57:11.628 --> 57:13.569
And maybe in 25, 50 years- Look at her face.

57:15.549 --> 57:35.143
twice are living with us a long time probably before we were even human so they've had a long time to settle so they have been with us probably before we were human evolution is real because of dna evolution is real because of dna evolution is real because biology 101

57:36.789 --> 57:38.030
I'm not going to hurt you.

57:38.050 --> 57:39.911
That's kind of the agreement that's been worked out.

57:39.931 --> 57:42.994
Of course, it doesn't work that way, but that's the way I look at it.

57:43.014 --> 57:44.255
Whereas SARS-CoV-2, I'm not going to hurt you.

57:44.715 --> 57:46.817
That's kind of the agreement that's been worked out.

57:46.857 --> 57:47.977
Of course, it doesn't work that way.

57:48.057 --> 57:49.659
But that's the way I look at it.

57:49.959 --> 57:52.040
Whereas SARS-CoV-2, I'm not going to hurt you.

57:53.422 --> 57:56.185
is brand new to people, and we're still negotiating.

57:56.806 --> 58:00.912
And maybe in 25, 50 years... Look at all those expressions.

58:00.992 --> 58:02.274
Look at all those expressions.

58:02.334 --> 58:03.435
They're so useful.

58:04.276 --> 58:05.778
They really draw the viewer in.

58:05.818 --> 58:06.860
This is a great audition.

58:07.140 --> 58:08.983
We won't think twice about it.

58:09.443 --> 58:15.930
But when viruses first come into people from some animal, they're pretty vicious because they're not used to it and we're not used to them.

58:15.990 --> 58:20.555
But all the ones we have, the trillions that you refer to, we're used to it.

58:20.875 --> 58:25.500
Plus, our immune system, right, is really good at keeping them down.

58:26.161 --> 58:31.046
Because if you get, say, an organ transplant and you have to take drugs that suppress

58:31.707 --> 58:40.169
your immune system so you don't reject the organ, then all these viruses rear up and cause big problems because the immune system is no longer there to keep them in check.

58:40.609 --> 58:46.510
So those are the things that make the viruses in us okay and brand new ones, not so much.

58:47.450 --> 58:47.770
Okay.

58:48.270 --> 58:58.732
I had seen on another podcast that over time, these infections, these viruses are supposed to get

59:00.457 --> 59:05.062
better at infecting us, but more benign, less dangerous.

59:06.063 --> 59:16.393
And so the debate about whether viruses start out more virulent and then become less virulent because they don't kill their host, this biological debate

59:17.014 --> 59:30.619
presupposes the existence of pathogenic RNA molecules, of free-range RNA molecules, of potentially gain-of-function RNA molecules with fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts.

59:32.640 --> 59:38.682
And so the argument is that even a gain-of-function virus will eventually become okay in the background of endemicity.

59:41.556 --> 59:48.341
And so just in case you can't see it, just in case you need to hear it, was she scripted?

59:48.541 --> 59:49.382
Is this a thing?

59:49.602 --> 01:00:00.010
I don't know, but I know for sure that she's not going to get out if she accepts this limited spectrum of debate about what viruses do when they first start out in a naive population.

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:09.197
Do they start out nasty and become nice or are they nice and then become nasty is the most ridiculous debate about what a,

01:00:09.717 --> 01:00:12.803
RNA molecule does when released in a population.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:21.443
it for I'm guessing the reason you just explained which is like hey I want to stay in my host longer.

01:00:21.463 --> 01:00:26.405
I don't want to kill you because if I kill you it doesn't benefit me.

01:00:27.465 --> 01:00:40.250
But then covid seems to be going the opposite way with variants that seem to be more dangerous which is counterintuitive to me and then you get all the rumors of like oh it's you know.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:41.950
It's engineered.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.951
This isn't typical behavior.

01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:49.292
I know that people have said that viruses, they change.

01:00:49.392 --> 01:00:50.532
They change all the time.

01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:51.232
It's very typical.

01:00:52.013 --> 01:00:54.233
But... Vincent is not enjoying this.

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:55.293
Stop, Julian.

01:00:55.673 --> 01:00:59.554
Do they change and become more benign, right, as you mentioned?

01:01:00.175 --> 01:01:04.335
Or is it common that you get these strains that are more nefarious?

01:01:05.236 --> 01:01:06.056
Nefarious?

01:01:06.909 --> 01:01:07.930
They're nefarious.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.451
They're nefarious viruses.

01:01:09.511 --> 01:01:12.753
Can you imagine if we had gain-of-function nefarious viruses?

01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:14.154
Whoa, that would be scary.

01:01:15.195 --> 01:01:19.418
So I don't think COVID is getting more nefarious.

01:01:19.478 --> 01:01:24.662
I think it's too early and it's too soon to make those conclusions.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:25.723
I should make that into a clip.

01:01:25.763 --> 01:01:29.465
The kind of observations they're based on are going to turn out not to be right.

01:01:29.946 --> 01:01:35.189
In fact, you know, when Delta first emerged, some people claimed it was

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.290
more serious, right?

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:38.031
Yeah, Doc.

01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:40.351
I mean, like crazy time.

01:01:40.391 --> 01:01:41.031
Yeah, I know.

01:01:41.192 --> 01:01:45.593
But now we're getting first, it's too soon to make those conclusions.

01:01:45.733 --> 01:01:49.994
And the kind of observations they're based on are going to turn out not to be right.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:55.716
In fact, you know, when Delta first emerged, some people claimed it was

01:01:56.636 --> 01:01:57.817
more serious, right?

01:01:57.837 --> 01:01:58.577
Yeah, Doc.

01:01:59.078 --> 01:02:00.899
I mean, like crazy time.

01:02:00.939 --> 01:02:01.579
Yeah, I know.

01:02:01.739 --> 01:02:05.341
But now we're getting reports that it's not.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.663
It's probably just the same as all the others.

01:02:08.723 --> 01:02:14.307
So it's, you know, when you have this rapid information coming out during a pandemic, not all of it is right.

01:02:14.567 --> 01:02:18.770
And that's why, like you said earlier, we try and sort this out on our podcast.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.572
Gee, I wonder if this is actually an audition for for him.

01:02:23.857 --> 01:02:25.737
and whether he can do tours or not.

01:02:25.798 --> 01:02:46.983
Because actually after this, you know, they pretty much make him the host of everything instead of the other way around where, you know, he might not be as adept as Robert Malone or Jessica Rose at going on podcasts and sort of bouncing off the kind of random questions that the probably naive hosts are asking if and if they're

01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:48.844
They're going off of a script.

01:02:48.944 --> 01:02:51.905
It's still them trying to make it feel natural.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:57.427
And so in this case, the rambling can often get Vincent into deep water that he can't swim out of.

01:02:57.667 --> 01:02:59.727
Give people the right information.

01:02:59.747 --> 01:03:00.608
And we're very critical.

01:03:00.668 --> 01:03:01.428
And we have time.

01:03:02.128 --> 01:03:03.129
We have an hour or two.

01:03:03.169 --> 01:03:04.189
Our podcast is long.

01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:06.030
So I think you're right.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:13.272
Over time, viruses that jump from animals into people, they become less able to cause serious disease.

01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:15.393
But it doesn't disappear, right?

01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:20.410
We have polio that's been around for thousands of years and it can still paralyze you, right?

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:24.251
But I mean, for the most part, polio is benign in most people.

01:03:24.851 --> 01:03:26.732
I'm curious about, hold on one second.

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:29.593
I'm just going to check this out.

01:03:36.656 --> 01:03:36.936
Hmm.

01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:50.468
I have a medical dictionary here from a while back.

01:03:52.509 --> 01:03:58.332
And I think Vincent just said that it's been around for thousands of years.

01:03:58.352 --> 01:03:58.933
Hold on a second.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.234
I think you're right.

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:07.478
Over time, viruses that jump from animals into people, they become less able to cause serious disease.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:09.639
But it doesn't disappear, right?

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:13.761
We have polio that's been around for thousands of years, and it can still paralyze you.

01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:15.122
Got the wrong one, sorry.

01:04:25.882 --> 01:04:47.898
I got a couple books here I'm gonna whip out and we'll just see what's up I think that's on the right one so I can probably just switch over to this camera right yes but I gotta put myself down here okay

01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:55.124
So the first book is this medical dictionary, encyclopedia, four volume thing from 1902.

01:04:57.145 --> 01:05:01.188
And I'm not saying that, you know, I could, you know, you just make fun of me, right?

01:05:01.488 --> 01:05:02.428
If you want, I don't care.

01:05:03.449 --> 01:05:07.451
I'm just going to look up to see if there's an, it's been around for, play what?

01:05:07.893 --> 01:05:08.093
Right.

01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:13.594
But I mean, for the most part, polio is benign in most people, but just now and then you get paralyzed.

01:05:13.654 --> 01:05:15.835
Measles can still cause problems.

01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:18.175
So polio is benign in most people.

01:05:18.255 --> 01:05:21.036
Sounds like asymptomatic transmission to me.

01:05:22.896 --> 01:05:25.016
Polio.

01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:32.218
I mean, if it's in here, I'm happy, right?

01:05:32.258 --> 01:05:32.958
Poli.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.861
Polioencephalitis.

01:05:56.433 --> 01:05:57.734
Okay, so let's see what it says.

01:05:57.774 --> 01:05:58.214
Here we go.

01:06:00.896 --> 01:06:03.858
Polio is here.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.621
Polyencephalitis.

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:13.654
is the inflammation of the brain, the gray matter of the cerebral cortex.

01:06:13.834 --> 01:06:19.918
The polioencephalitis is the inflammation of the gray matter of the cerebral cortex.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:21.178
It says go back up to that.

01:06:21.759 --> 01:06:34.286
Poliomyelencephalitis is the poliomyelitis associated with polyencephalitis.

01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:37.969
So polyencephalitis, polioencephalitis,

01:06:38.885 --> 01:06:42.128
Poliomyelencephalitis.

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.851
Poliomyelitis.

01:06:48.554 --> 01:06:57.442
Destructive inflammation of the larger multipolar ganglion cells in the anterior corona of the spinal cord occurring chiefly in children during their first dentition.

01:06:58.163 --> 01:07:04.769
It deprives certain muscles and often entire limbs of muscular power and parts affected undergo rapid atrophy.

01:07:07.136 --> 01:07:07.977
Okay, so it's there.

01:07:08.317 --> 01:07:08.677
It's good.

01:07:09.218 --> 01:07:09.498
I see.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.062
Thousands of years it was with us.

01:07:14.762 --> 01:07:15.903
I'm gonna check one more book.

01:07:17.024 --> 01:07:17.885
Polio.

01:07:18.786 --> 01:07:20.387
Maybe I have to look it up in the index.

01:07:20.547 --> 01:07:20.987
I don't know.

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:24.530
This is a really cool book.

01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:30.615
This book is called Domestic Medicine, Medical Practice, and it's from 1904, I think.

01:07:30.635 --> 01:07:31.996
Maybe 20, maybe 1914.

01:07:36.277 --> 01:07:38.477
Polio in the back.

01:07:39.077 --> 01:07:42.118
Index, polio, polio, polio, polio.

01:07:44.078 --> 01:07:44.818
It's not in here.

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:46.419
You can't treat it, apparently, then.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:47.099
It's not in there.

01:07:47.799 --> 01:07:49.179
Payers Patches is, though.

01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:50.179
Page 68.

01:07:50.339 --> 01:07:50.820
Interesting.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.260
Wonder what they knew about Payers Patches back in 1900.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:55.620
Page 68.

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:02.161
Dictionary of Drugs, Anatomy and Physiology.

01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:02.942
Ooh, wow.

01:08:02.982 --> 01:08:04.582
They knew about it already back then?

01:08:06.013 --> 01:08:13.001
68.

01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:13.001
I'm just going to put this under the... I don't know how easy it's going to be to put it under here.

01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:13.962
It's a gigantic book.

01:08:14.422 --> 01:08:19.588
Let's see if I can find the place where they're talking about the parent.

01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:20.590
Besides these,

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:38.801
Small glands which are found either alone, the solitary glands are together forming Peyer's patches and Brunner's glands and Lieberkuhn's follicles, all of which together secrete the intestinal juice whose principal action is to lubricate the food.

01:08:39.902 --> 01:08:40.343
Interesting.

01:08:41.499 --> 01:08:50.614
So, there they are mentioned already from the perspective of the veins and arteries and sort of anatomy of the gut.

01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:52.778
They already knew that Peyer's patches were there.

01:08:52.798 --> 01:08:54.360
So, I'm just going to go back to this and get going.

01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:58.387
It's just a random study hall to try and figure out what the hell's going on.

01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:20.730
Remember that this lady very recently was in front of the Senate as somebody speaking out against something and in need of a microphone, just like Jordan Peterson's daughter was, and just like Callie Means and his sister were, all people that really needed a microphone in front of Senator Ron Johnson to get in the congressional record.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.131
And this is one of them.

01:09:22.171 --> 01:09:23.491
And this is from 2021 when she interviewed

01:09:25.351 --> 01:09:27.793
Vincent Rack and Yellow kind of out of the blue.

01:09:28.894 --> 01:09:41.822
If you look at her YouTube channel, there's no reason to think that the person in the black leotard doing the jazzercise is going to be interviewing Vincent Rack and Yellow and has a podcast called Keeping It Real.

01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:43.363
There's nothing there.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:53.289
There are no other videos around it where she's in a normal outfit with a big microphone in front of her doing the keep it real podcast.

01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:54.310
Do you understand that?

01:09:54.370 --> 01:10:06.222
That didn't happen until almost two years later, three years later, where she does it with Michael Schellenberger or whatever his name is and calls that episode one.

01:10:06.562 --> 01:10:08.144
Do you see what I'm seeing here?

01:10:10.157 --> 01:10:16.503
But I think over time, in general, viruses get to be more adapted to their host.

01:10:17.003 --> 01:10:19.685
And the ones that are more recent, so take Ebola.

01:10:19.725 --> 01:10:23.428
Every time Ebola jumps over into people, horrible disease, right?

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:36.620
It never has a chance to change and get better in terms of disease because... Because Robert Malone's team shows up and ring-vaccinates all the villages around the outbreak, and that's what prevents the spread.

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:45.630
it then disappears, we get rid of it, and then the next time it's a new spillover from animals.

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:51.332
So I think my idea is that over time, yes, viruses become more benign, but not zero.

01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:52.372
It's not zero.

01:10:52.652 --> 01:10:55.173
I don't think they ever get more virulent.

01:10:55.893 --> 01:10:57.113
That doesn't make any sense to me.

01:10:57.173 --> 01:10:59.154
To kill your host faster doesn't make any sense.

01:10:59.674 --> 01:10:59.934
Okay.

01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:08.049
You bring up different viruses throughout history, measles, polio.

01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:13.194
Was the plague, was that a virus or a bacteria or we don't even know?

01:11:13.214 --> 01:11:14.895
The plague was a bacterium, yeah.

01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:15.956
A bacterium.

01:11:16.296 --> 01:11:18.278
Spanish flu was a flu, a virus.

01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:25.284
I feel as though, I wasn't alive for any of this, but

01:11:26.414 --> 01:11:29.777
You had measles, it seemed to kill kids, right?

01:11:29.857 --> 01:11:30.317
Measles.

01:11:31.718 --> 01:11:34.340
But they didn't shut down the globe.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:36.342
Why?

01:11:36.642 --> 01:11:36.962
Why?

01:11:36.982 --> 01:11:38.543
And they didn't with the Spanish flu.

01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:41.546
Was that just because we were a more callous species?

01:11:42.446 --> 01:11:49.212
Or I wonder, has the COVID response, what are your thoughts on the COVID response?

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.894
And before we even get to the vaccine, you're shutting it down.

01:11:53.951 --> 01:11:56.114
Masks seem like a small price to pay.

01:11:56.134 --> 01:11:59.619
Oh, they work really well or not like.

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:03.172
What do you think about the way we've handled this globally?

01:12:03.253 --> 01:12:09.758
Because it seems like masks seem like a small price to pay, whether they are super, they work really well or not.

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:13.301
What do you think about the way we've handled this globally?

01:12:13.361 --> 01:12:19.187
Because it seems like we've had things that are more dangerous throughout history and didn't respond this way.

01:12:19.227 --> 01:12:23.470
But I mean, nobody knows because there's so much misinformation and so much agenda.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:24.992
There's no clean information.

01:12:25.558 --> 01:12:29.560
Yeah, well, part of the problem is that Earth's population is now huge.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.321
It's bigger than it's ever been, right?

01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:34.282
And so that's actually contradictory, right?

01:12:34.322 --> 01:12:49.810
Because if you're going to say that the virus is constantly evolving, then the more people that the virus goes through, the more likely it is it's going to do whatever they say, which is, I guess, become less virulent and more efficient at replication or something like that.

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:50.951
It's going to be less deadly.

01:12:51.491 --> 01:12:57.576
And so the more people on the planet means it's going to be harder for a virus to sustain its novelty.

01:12:57.596 --> 01:13:04.162
You can't have it both ways.

01:13:04.222 --> 01:13:05.383
It doesn't make sense.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:10.888
But they definitely, they definitely have it both ways.

01:13:11.536 --> 01:13:13.697
potential impacts of viruses are greater.

01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:19.320
You know, there probably were plenty of viral outbreaks many years ago, but there were far fewer people.

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:20.181
There was no news.

01:13:20.481 --> 01:13:25.624
News didn't travel around the world, but it took forever to find out things that happened across the pond.

01:13:25.704 --> 01:13:34.029
So if that was the case, then every time somebody got on a ship and got off the ship, most of the people on the ship should have gotten deathly ill.

01:13:35.925 --> 01:13:50.721
Every time a colony ship landed somewhere like in Africa to, I don't know, buy some slaves and load up their ship, they should have gotten all kinds of viruses and the sailors on that slave ship should have been dead by the time the thing landed.

01:13:51.642 --> 01:13:55.386
Or the slaves should have gotten a virus and they should have all been dead.

01:13:57.273 --> 01:14:10.537
not dying of starvation or being chained to the bottom of a boat with seawater in it and shit and piss all over, but dead from the viruses that they've never seen because the sailors had never landed there before.

01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:13.058
It's so bizarre.

01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:16.199
I don't really understand how it's possible.

01:14:17.674 --> 01:14:21.518
you know, 1918 flu, we tried to shut things down.

01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:23.540
You know, we're just coming off a war.

01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:25.122
It wasn't very easy.

01:14:25.842 --> 01:14:27.764
So, that really caused a lot of havoc.

01:14:27.804 --> 01:14:30.607
But before then, there were certainly pandemics.

01:14:30.928 --> 01:14:35.572
We don't have a good record of them because before 1900, we didn't even know what a virus was.

01:14:36.173 --> 01:14:39.496
So, you know, with few people, you have less potential impact.

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:39.797
I think

01:14:40.537 --> 01:14:46.979
There are many reasons why, to answer your question, we had the response that we had for this one.

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:51.380
One is the population of the world is huge and there are a lot of susceptible people that can die.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.122
And there's also a lot of communication and news travels really quickly.

01:14:56.142 --> 01:14:58.222
And then we have politics, which is all wrapped up.

01:14:58.342 --> 01:15:04.404
I mean, the most dangerous thing about sailing on a ship during those days was getting scurvy.

01:15:06.124 --> 01:15:12.989
It wasn't the novel viruses that you were going to get exposed to three months later when you landed on a new continent.

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:14.891
It was the scurvy.

01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:29.403
If we had 7 billion people 200 years ago and a virus were introduced, you would hear about it.

01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:29.903
But we didn't.

01:15:29.963 --> 01:15:32.285
The population of the world was far, far smaller.

01:15:32.305 --> 01:15:33.646
And I think that's a big part of it.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:34.596
I understand.

01:15:34.616 --> 01:15:36.497
I understand.

01:15:36.517 --> 01:15:37.057
I understand.

01:15:37.177 --> 01:15:39.378
I'm going to shift gears on you for a second.

01:15:40.978 --> 01:15:46.660
Obviously, you know, the controversy surrounding the vaccine is huge.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.301
And I'm not passing judgment.

01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:50.801
I'm personally vaccinated.

01:15:50.821 --> 01:15:51.722
I had COVID.

01:15:52.142 --> 01:15:52.682
With that said,

01:15:53.462 --> 01:15:57.003
what ending the vaccine is huge.

01:15:58.124 --> 01:15:59.644
And I'm not passing judgment.

01:15:59.985 --> 01:16:01.145
I'm personally vaccinated.

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:02.085
I had COVID.

01:16:02.585 --> 01:16:10.128
With that said, you know, I have friends that are not friends that hate people that that are not.

01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:13.751
You know, I don't pass judgment.

01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:20.681
I just want people to get clean information because I think both sides have misinformation.

01:16:21.221 --> 01:16:25.327
And I'd like to play devil's advocate with you if that's okay.

01:16:25.687 --> 01:16:27.850
Number one, it doesn't work.

01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:29.933
People are still getting sick.

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:38.756
People are still getting sick, but really few people are getting sick, and whenever they do, that's what you get reported, right?

01:16:38.776 --> 01:16:39.537
I didn't hear it.

01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:40.978
Did she claim vaccine injury?

01:16:41.038 --> 01:16:42.899
Personally vaccinated, I had COVID.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:50.406
With that said, you know, I have friends that are not, friends that hate people that are not.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.569
I don't pass judgment.

01:16:54.609 --> 01:17:01.513
I just want people to get clean information because I think both sides have misinformation.

01:17:02.053 --> 01:17:05.375
And I'd like to play devil's advocate with you, if that's okay.

01:17:06.495 --> 01:17:08.657
Number one, it doesn't work.

01:17:09.457 --> 01:17:10.878
People are still getting sick.

01:17:13.039 --> 01:17:14.200
People are still getting sick?

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.360
Okay, I'm stopping it.

01:17:16.301 --> 01:17:17.341
I need to figure that out.

01:17:17.461 --> 01:17:19.142
That question needs to be figured out.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:19.683
Let's do...

01:17:20.985 --> 01:17:47.618
um julian michaels oh wow oh my gosh oh no way no freaking way okay so look here's what i'm talking about this is exactly what i'm talking about look

01:17:49.255 --> 01:17:52.140
I didn't do enough research before doing this show.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.983
I just went on because I wanted to do a show.

01:17:54.023 --> 01:17:54.604
Check this out.

01:17:54.764 --> 01:17:55.926
So I'm going on YouTube.

01:17:56.768 --> 01:17:58.190
Why are you doing that, you demon?

01:17:59.032 --> 01:17:59.433
Just go.

01:18:00.461 --> 01:18:01.321
I'm going on YouTube.

01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:02.982
Here's the video we're watching right now.

01:18:03.702 --> 01:18:06.743
Vaccine victim exposes, or the one I wanna watch.

01:18:07.243 --> 01:18:13.324
And you'll notice that there in that video, in episode number 14, she's got a desk and a set.

01:18:13.524 --> 01:18:14.425
Look, see the set?

01:18:14.465 --> 01:18:17.045
It says Julian Michaels in the background and stuff.

01:18:17.065 --> 01:18:20.826
This has got a whole set with microphones and those are fat mics.

01:18:20.886 --> 01:18:22.467
Those are like $300 mics each.

01:18:22.987 --> 01:18:24.087
So then we go down here.

01:18:24.587 --> 01:18:26.628
She was on CNBC

01:18:27.608 --> 01:18:28.549
Four weeks ago.

01:18:28.929 --> 01:18:30.531
She was on News Nation.

01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:32.292
She was on Fox News.

01:18:34.174 --> 01:18:36.916
She was on Inside Edition four years ago.

01:18:42.922 --> 01:18:45.264
Talking about the weight of people.

01:18:46.785 --> 01:18:53.211
And then here she is at the health round table one month ago in front of the Senate.

01:18:53.251 --> 01:18:53.972
What is she saying?

01:18:55.339 --> 01:18:56.962
Where is the outrage?

01:18:57.603 --> 01:19:02.870
So maybe by hitting you guys over and over, it will really piss you off.

01:19:03.091 --> 01:19:04.253
Yes, yes.

01:19:04.313 --> 01:19:04.913
So here I go.

01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:17.896
During the time that we've been given to speak with you today, roughly 800 people will die of an obesity-related disease that was completely... Okay, I don't know.

01:19:17.936 --> 01:19:18.977
This is not the whole thing.

01:19:19.017 --> 01:19:20.057
I don't want to see this one.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:21.058
I don't want to see this one.

01:19:21.078 --> 01:19:27.742
I want to see the whole thing, because what she says in front of the Senate is important, especially if she's claiming vaccine injury.

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:28.783
I don't know if she is.

01:19:28.803 --> 01:19:30.484
I don't think she is.

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:32.705
I don't want to... Oh, my gosh, look.

01:19:33.525 --> 01:19:34.366
Fox News.

01:19:35.467 --> 01:19:35.727
I mean...

01:19:38.032 --> 01:19:39.272
That's extraordinary.

01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:42.113
Okay, so we'll go back to this video.

01:19:44.294 --> 01:19:49.835
Now remember, this is the one where I showed you in the slide deck.

01:19:51.275 --> 01:19:56.356
This is the one where we are here.

01:19:59.357 --> 01:20:02.398
So these videos that I showed you with Michael Schellenberger,

01:20:03.553 --> 01:20:14.319
and Callie Means and Drew Pinsky and this lady from the Turks and Walsh and Rubin and Sabine Hazan.

01:20:14.339 --> 01:20:16.560
They're all in this year.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.201
They're all from the last two months.

01:20:19.101 --> 01:20:22.183
But then here is the episode one, Keeping It Real.

01:20:22.203 --> 01:20:22.843
Can you see that?

01:20:23.363 --> 01:20:29.126
And then we go for actually two years of, you know, she's making videos, but not every week.

01:20:30.207 --> 01:20:31.888
More like every three weeks or a month.

01:20:33.993 --> 01:20:38.161
And when we get down here, we see just out of nowhere, there's this video.

01:20:39.397 --> 01:20:40.417
And what video is it?

01:20:40.477 --> 01:21:03.725
It is a video with Vincent Rackin' Yellow where she calls Julian Michaels' podcast, Keeping It Real, even though it wouldn't be until two years later that she would have episode one, Keeping It Real with Michael Schellenberger, followed by episode two and four and 12 and 14, 14 that we will watch in a second, but this is just unbelievable.

01:21:04.383 --> 01:21:06.825
but really few people are getting sick.

01:21:06.865 --> 01:21:09.927
And whenever they do, that's what you get reported, right?

01:21:10.268 --> 01:21:15.672
Oh, the vaccine, this person was vaccinated and they got sick, they were in the hospital, but it's really rare.

01:21:15.692 --> 01:21:21.377
It's like less than a percent of vaccinated people are getting seriously ill.

01:21:22.357 --> 01:21:25.359
So, I think it's not right to say it doesn't work.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.121
There are multiple vaccines here in the U.S.

01:21:28.161 --> 01:21:28.902
We have three.

01:21:29.422 --> 01:21:30.583
They work really well.

01:21:31.123 --> 01:21:37.447
Yeah, you can get infected, but if you're vaccinated, you're probably not going to die.

01:21:37.487 --> 01:21:39.889
You're probably not even going to go in a hospital.

01:21:40.589 --> 01:21:44.010
And I think that's a pretty good trade-off to make.

01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:48.491
And so that's why I'm fully vaccinated and everybody I know is.

01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:51.652
So to say it doesn't work is just not right.

01:21:51.672 --> 01:21:52.212
I'm sorry.

01:21:52.592 --> 01:21:55.933
Everybody that I know is, is an illusion of consensus.

01:21:56.033 --> 01:22:00.754
Her and him both being vaccinated is an illusion of consensus, like it or not.

01:22:01.494 --> 01:22:04.856
That's the exact enchantment that all of these podcasts do.

01:22:05.356 --> 01:22:18.803
In fact, one of the reasons why you might put me and Mark Kulak and Joe Marshall and Scott Shara in a different bucket than all these people is that we don't need an interview.

01:22:20.664 --> 01:22:22.185
We have enough to say on our own.

01:22:23.566 --> 01:22:25.467
We're doing enough work on our own

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:32.960
Organizing enough thoughts on our own that we have enough to say on our own for hours and hours of our own content.

01:22:35.883 --> 01:22:37.764
And I would argue that Julian Michaels didn't.

01:22:37.964 --> 01:22:39.706
I would argue that Joe Rogan doesn't.

01:22:39.906 --> 01:22:42.088
I would argue that Brett Weinstein doesn't.

01:22:42.268 --> 01:22:46.252
I would argue that a lot of these people actually don't have very much to say.

01:22:47.453 --> 01:22:51.597
And that's why the majority of these people need a guest for every episode.

01:22:52.765 --> 01:22:54.707
Doc Malek has nothing to say.

01:22:54.727 --> 01:22:58.790
He didn't even have anything to say until three years into the pandemic.

01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:02.252
Of course he needs an interview for every episode.

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:15.603
And so wouldn't it be crazy if a teacher went in front of your kids, but every day the teacher just had somebody else come in the room and interviewed them and agree that they were very smart.

01:23:19.706 --> 01:23:21.427
How much would you think of that teacher then?

01:23:22.386 --> 01:23:30.951
especially if that teacher called themselves a biologist or called themselves a doctor, but then actually all they ever do is interview people.

01:23:33.832 --> 01:23:36.934
A fitness expert, but all you ever do is interview people.

01:23:37.634 --> 01:23:41.536
An athlete and journalist, but all you ever do is interview people.

01:23:42.157 --> 01:23:47.820
You don't come to any conclusions, then you're not a journalist, you're just a reporter.

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:52.238
You're not a thinker, you're just a performer.

01:23:55.103 --> 01:24:05.346
And if you don't have a catalog of hundreds of hours of insightful things to say, then interviewing people is really useless.

01:24:05.486 --> 01:24:12.269
It's just like, you're gonna bounce from one limited spectrum of debate to another, one magician to another.

01:24:12.309 --> 01:24:14.509
You don't know what card tricks are.

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.930
You don't know what cutting people in half is.

01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:18.951
You don't know what sleight of hand is.

01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:21.852
And so all of these people can just speak to you and it's all great.

01:24:23.348 --> 01:24:24.929
You are so smart.

01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:27.269
I mean, I can follow that.

01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:46.896
And if you understand how dangerous it is that some people can perhaps unwittingly be involved in this, and even now unwitting, do you think she would have gone on if Vincent Rack and Yellow said, okay, I've got some more people that I want you to interview.

01:24:48.696 --> 01:24:50.377
And also it comes with a sponsor.

01:24:55.182 --> 01:24:59.665
What would happen if Brett Weinstein or Joe Rogan or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:59.745 --> 01:25:03.207
or Elon Musk called her and said, I've got a list of people I want you to interview.

01:25:03.687 --> 01:25:05.088
I want to boost your podcast.

01:25:05.148 --> 01:25:06.329
I think you're really great.

01:25:06.729 --> 01:25:08.510
Why don't you start with Michael Schellenberger?

01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:10.431
Here's his contact information.

01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:18.876
And I've got this dude who will help you make some graphics and some thumbnails and take all of that mundane work out of having a podcast.

01:25:19.276 --> 01:25:23.759
Take all of that out of your hands so you can concentrate on your outfit and on your workout.

01:25:25.555 --> 01:25:26.936
Sounds like a win-win to me.

01:25:28.076 --> 01:25:29.637
Let's see how it's going in episode 14.

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:36.499
I'm sure you can imagine how that episode with Vincent continues, but let's not do that one.

01:25:36.519 --> 01:25:37.600
Let's do this one instead.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.701
I'm sitting there getting infusion.

01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:45.783
Our entire lives have been uprooted, and my life to the drug company is worth it.

01:25:45.803 --> 01:25:46.883
So did you see already?

01:25:46.903 --> 01:25:53.306
Okay, so Jillian Michaels is a podcast person.

01:25:56.118 --> 01:25:59.860
And remember her thing before this was fitness.

01:26:00.921 --> 01:26:07.244
She has years of sporadic fitness videos regularly there every three weeks, every month.

01:26:12.266 --> 01:26:20.070
But think about the fact that in her 14th episode, the list of the people that she's had and how she goes from having a white wall set

01:26:22.066 --> 01:26:38.208
and an oversized USB microphone to having a set equivalent to that of Doc Malek or equivalent to that of Tim Pool or Joe Rogan with multiple very nice low F-stop camera views.

01:26:39.571 --> 01:26:41.973
and sure 300 series mics.

01:26:41.993 --> 01:26:43.795
I'm sitting there getting infusion.

01:26:44.235 --> 01:26:49.879
Our entire lives have been uprooted and my life to the drug company is worth $1,200.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:58.006
In this episode, we're going to explore one of the most polarizing and controversial topics of our time, vaccine injuries.

01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:04.533
It's the only product in the United States where they cannot be sued for damages.

01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:09.076
My guest today is Brianne Dresen, and she's lived through this firsthand.

01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:10.957
My doctors didn't know what was going on.

01:27:11.357 --> 01:27:12.678
Look at that set.

01:27:13.538 --> 01:27:16.860
States where they cannot be polarized and infusion.

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.221
Our entire lives have been up.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:20.042
Look at it.

01:27:21.602 --> 01:27:27.626
Now, this room that I'm in right now could not accommodate a set with that, the camera that far back.

01:27:28.564 --> 01:27:31.466
I would love to have that but I can't and I'm not complaining.

01:27:31.527 --> 01:27:48.381
I'm just saying one of the reasons why I don't have that shot is because I would need the camera about four feet in the backyard for that in order to get that angle with the right probably would be a 50 millimeter equivalent or maybe an 80 millimeter equivalent depending on how far away I wanted it and how straight I wanted this angle to be.

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:53.032
But that's not like a room that she uses for other stuff at home.

01:27:53.673 --> 01:27:57.776
It's not like a room where she's not studying at that desk like I'm studying.

01:27:57.836 --> 01:28:06.302
She doesn't have basketball drill diagrams on the floor and all of her shoes under the couch there.

01:28:06.362 --> 01:28:08.744
That is a dedicated space.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:09.825
I don't care where it is.

01:28:14.184 --> 01:28:22.110
And that's something that she didn't have 14 episodes ago when Michael Schellenberger was on.

01:28:22.411 --> 01:28:25.993
And my life to the drug company is worth $1,200.

01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:28.075
In this episode, we're going to explore.

01:28:28.115 --> 01:28:31.818
I mean, Vincent's podcast has a studio in downtown New York.

01:28:32.298 --> 01:28:35.521
So I don't know where she is, but I bet she's not downtown New York.

01:28:35.621 --> 01:28:41.626
One of the most polarizing and controversial topics of our time, vaccine injuries.

01:28:42.068 --> 01:28:48.135
It's the only product in the United States where they cannot be sued for damages.

01:28:48.555 --> 01:28:52.700
My guest today is Brianne Drezin, and she's lived through this firsthand.

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.582
My doctors didn't know what was going on.

01:28:54.622 --> 01:28:57.605
My doctors kept asking me, they're like, what does the drug company say?

01:28:57.625 --> 01:28:59.447
Like, they're gone.

01:28:59.487 --> 01:29:00.048
I don't know.

01:29:00.448 --> 01:29:03.972
She was injured during the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trials.

01:29:04.452 --> 01:29:11.477
I mean, even this editing, to be very honest, with the music and with the cuts, it is well, well, well done.

01:29:11.517 --> 01:29:19.822
This is not somebody who taught herself Adobe Premiere and is editing these clips after she records them.

01:29:20.682 --> 01:29:26.646
And you want to see somebody who's actually taking footage and editing it the night of and putting it up the next day.

01:29:27.246 --> 01:29:29.808
Go look at, for example, Deion Sanders' son.

01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:39.593
He is doing it and you can see exactly how amateur it is and exactly how happy he is when he finds a new effect and then uses it all the time for like two weeks.

01:29:40.033 --> 01:29:46.637
This is somebody who got a crew hired who already knows how to make professional level quality cuts.

01:29:47.785 --> 01:29:53.026
I was patient number one in this study under Anthony Fauci and his department.

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:58.707
And in a world where the conversation around vaccines can be heated, divisive and extreme.

01:29:58.987 --> 01:30:04.349
I mean, there's a moving thing in the back that says, keep it real with with Jillian Michaels.

01:30:04.429 --> 01:30:06.889
It's like a it's like a morning program.

01:30:06.989 --> 01:30:07.829
I have this.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:09.090
Right.

01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.990
I have this.

01:30:11.437 --> 01:30:16.326
I can make this cut with that wipe, which I can show you exactly how I did it.

01:30:16.647 --> 01:30:18.871
And I can make this cut and that wipe.

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:19.693
Oh, sorry.

01:30:19.733 --> 01:30:20.434
That's the same one.

01:30:20.454 --> 01:30:21.737
I also have one with just a letter.

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:32.805
But I can show you exactly how I made that in After Effects, and that's not as fancy as what she's got here and what's going on here with the backgrounds and with these cuts and these wipes.

01:30:33.245 --> 01:30:37.227
And this is just somebody who's dedicated many hours to doing it, and it ain't her.

01:30:37.247 --> 01:30:44.131
Extremely nuanced, demonizing those who've experienced injuries is both hurtful and harmful to all of us.

01:30:44.471 --> 01:30:52.596
Your constitutional right to due process, your constitutional right to a fair jury trial, if you are injured by a COVID vaccine, they're automatically gone.

01:30:53.396 --> 01:30:59.959
your constitutional right to due process, your constitutional right to a fair jury trial.

01:31:00.059 --> 01:31:02.960
If you're injured by a COVID vaccine, they're automatically gone.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.221
Okay, and so now do we need to do it?

01:31:05.361 --> 01:31:05.961
Should we do it?

01:31:06.041 --> 01:31:08.502
Can anybody do it in the chat before I say it?

01:31:08.983 --> 01:31:11.764
Your constitutional right to due process.

01:31:11.844 --> 01:31:12.864
Why is this wrong?

01:31:14.065 --> 01:31:15.085
Why is that wrong?

01:31:15.145 --> 01:31:16.686
What is wrong with that argument?

01:31:18.413 --> 01:31:19.214
I can give you a hint.

01:31:19.374 --> 01:31:24.499
Aaron Siri is actually making that argument, but he made that argument using another word in front of it.

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:28.142
Procedural due process rights.

01:31:29.363 --> 01:31:32.926
He said fundamental procedural due process rights.

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:41.034
Procedural due process only exists as a term because there is a term substantive due process.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:52.862
and the fundamental right of due process is fulfilled by the CICP and the VICP because it is a process that you are due.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.461
It is a ritual that you are due.

01:31:56.861 --> 01:32:02.704
The ritual is designed to get you to accept the outcome regardless of whether it's good for you or bad for you.

01:32:03.145 --> 01:32:12.550
And due process could describe a jury trial or it could describe a CICP administrative court or a VICP administrative.

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.531
They both are due process.

01:32:15.171 --> 01:32:16.811
They both fit due process.

01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:25.134
More importantly, they both fit the fundamental procedural due process right that Erin Seery is arguing for.

01:32:25.534 --> 01:32:31.355
So this woman thinks she's dropping a bomb to this woman when she says the due process rights.

01:32:34.236 --> 01:32:34.796
It's wrong.

01:32:35.636 --> 01:32:41.138
And any lawyer worth their salt ought to be able to explain it because I'm explaining it right now, crystal clear.

01:32:42.014 --> 01:32:44.375
and I'm pretty sure I'm darn close to right.

01:32:44.855 --> 01:32:50.097
And if I'm not right, somebody correcting me would make progress for everyone.

01:32:52.618 --> 01:32:53.379
Let's listen again.

01:32:54.039 --> 01:32:56.420
And she's lived through this firsthand.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.301
My doctors didn't know what was going on.

01:32:58.341 --> 01:33:01.322
My doctors kept asking me, they're like, what does the drug company say?

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.763
Like they're gone, I don't know.

01:33:04.163 --> 01:33:07.725
She was injured during the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trials.

01:33:07.985 --> 01:33:09.926
So I was patient number one in this study.

01:33:10.666 --> 01:33:13.487
under Anthony Fauci's and his department.

01:33:13.808 --> 01:33:25.793
And in a world where the conversation around vaccines can be heated, divisive, and extremely nuanced, demonizing those who've experienced injuries is both hurtful and harmful to all of us.

01:33:26.153 --> 01:33:31.216
Your constitutional right to due process, your constitutional right to a fair jury trial,

01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:35.234
So due process and a jury trial are separate things.

01:33:35.314 --> 01:33:45.967
And again, I would say that the CICP and the VICP fulfill all of the requirements in our language to be due process.

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:50.693
Ritual that you are due, the king, you complain.

01:33:51.707 --> 01:33:53.509
Remember, the regular guy explained it.

01:33:53.589 --> 01:33:55.831
We needed a guy that could speak the language of the king.

01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:57.212
That's where the lawyer comes from.

01:33:57.712 --> 01:33:59.053
That's where that comes from.

01:33:59.093 --> 01:34:01.015
That's why it's the oldest profession on earth.

01:34:01.095 --> 01:34:02.737
Not the prostitute, but the lawyer.

01:34:04.118 --> 01:34:08.702
And the process that you are due, due process means that you're due a ritual.

01:34:09.022 --> 01:34:12.725
And that ritual plays the role of getting you to accept the outcome, good or bad.

01:34:13.566 --> 01:34:19.131
And so you don't have fundamental procedural due process rights being violated if you're given a due process.

01:34:20.396 --> 01:34:33.461
That is just ham-fisted bullshittery that I think is either wittingly or unwittingly being perpetuated precisely because Aaron Seery is the foremost authority on how to fight this stuff and he ain't fighting it.

01:34:37.022 --> 01:34:41.724
What we should be talking about is the fundamental right to sue for damages over $20.

01:34:44.195 --> 01:34:49.297
And that means that some court must have some jurisdiction over this.

01:34:49.598 --> 01:34:58.502
And if there is no court that has any jurisdiction, then Congress is in a way stripping the jurisdiction of all the court system.

01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:03.784
It's like taking away power from one of the three branches of government.

01:35:04.745 --> 01:35:06.005
And that's not really allowed.

01:35:06.045 --> 01:35:11.868
The Congress can't really do that except for under special circumstances and it should be done correctly.

01:35:13.615 --> 01:35:29.244
And so there would be a way to use legal principles and ideas that have previous precedents in American law to successfully argue that the PrEP Act could be struck as unconstitutional on its face in the way that is written.

01:35:31.345 --> 01:35:42.572
And that it is also possible, according to Robert Gallo himself in the article that we looked at in that podcast, that actually vaccines could be challenged as

01:35:43.865 --> 01:35:47.848
for strict liability on the basis of them being designed incorrectly.

01:35:47.888 --> 01:36:08.026
Now, if Jonathan Couey is right, an intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system could be shown to be dumb, then the vaccine schedule could be shown to be criminal and could be shown to be subject to strict liability because of that reason.

01:36:11.857 --> 01:36:16.418
When is Aaron Seery gonna go on a podcast and explain any of this stuff to a reasonable level?

01:36:17.218 --> 01:36:18.798
Is it really that complicated?

01:36:18.858 --> 01:36:23.680
It's just too much Goldman Sachs mumbo jumbo for any normal person to understand.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.781
So we gotta have some lady like this say these words that mean nothing together in combination.

01:36:29.021 --> 01:36:31.941
If you're injured by a COVID vaccine, they're automatically gone.

01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:35.722
Your constitutional rights are gone.

01:36:36.142 --> 01:36:39.563
This show is not meant to dissuade anyone from getting a vaccination.

01:36:40.239 --> 01:36:42.146
I mean, think about how nicely that...

01:36:43.211 --> 01:36:45.872
was cut in there over the audio of this cut.

01:36:46.292 --> 01:36:53.815
Those are very advanced editing things that only somebody with savvy and experience doing it would be able to do.

01:36:53.895 --> 01:36:54.235
Watch.

01:36:54.715 --> 01:36:55.735
They're automatically gone.

01:36:56.516 --> 01:36:59.537
Your constitutional rights are gone.

01:36:59.957 --> 01:37:03.358
This show is not meant to dissuade anyone from getting a vaccination.

01:37:03.438 --> 01:37:05.619
That is professional level editing.

01:37:06.119 --> 01:37:12.201
The timing of that, the way that this is layered in audio, this takes work and skill.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:13.900
and she ain't doing it.

01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:31.050
It's about Brianne's journey of pain, recovery, and relentless advocacy to ensure that we change the way any and all vaccine injuries are handled so that no one- We're gonna change the way that all vaccine injuries are handled?

01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:32.110
What?

01:37:33.311 --> 01:37:33.611
What?

01:37:34.472 --> 01:37:34.792
What?

01:37:35.732 --> 01:37:36.913
So where's the truth here?

01:37:38.166 --> 01:37:41.127
We're not anywhere near calling the vaccine schedule criminal.

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:47.670
We're not anywhere near calling the investigational vaccine countermeasures transfections and transformations.

01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:49.490
And we are in 2024.

01:37:49.851 --> 01:37:52.672
She's on her 14th podcast trying to keep it real.

01:37:53.872 --> 01:37:56.873
Your constitutional rights are gone.

01:37:57.293 --> 01:38:00.735
This show is not meant to dissuade anyone from getting a vaccination.

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.316
It's about Breanne's journey of pain,

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:15.265
relentless advocacy to ensure that we change the way any and all vaccine injuries are handled so that no one has to suffer the same way again.

01:38:15.745 --> 01:38:17.646
We are doing this for humanity.

01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:21.228
We're doing this to restore the rights of every single American out there.

01:38:21.758 --> 01:38:29.039
Join me as we tackle these hard truths and give a voice to those who have too often been silenced.

01:38:29.379 --> 01:38:31.740
There was no help that came.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:38.281
You can do that two eyes, two of the same camera trick by just putting one camera right there and one camera right there.

01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:41.021
And then you have them shooting at the same time.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:44.662
It's kind of a, it's kind of a cheap parlor trick, but it's definitely easy to do.

01:38:45.102 --> 01:38:47.063
And I kept waiting and waiting.

01:38:47.083 --> 01:38:49.103
Keeping it real with Jillian Michaels.

01:38:54.298 --> 01:38:54.618
Hi.

01:38:55.459 --> 01:38:55.679
Hey.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.440
How are you?

01:38:57.261 --> 01:38:58.902
Doing okay.

01:38:59.062 --> 01:39:01.945
They're missing a big JM here.

01:39:02.005 --> 01:39:05.208
They need a keeping it real logo right down here on the wood.

01:39:05.648 --> 01:39:06.149
They need that.

01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:07.150
They're missing that, yeah.

01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:08.151
Doing okay.

01:39:08.531 --> 01:39:09.852
The neon sign is coming.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:14.637
I was afraid to do this one.

01:39:15.814 --> 01:39:16.975
which I think you know.

01:39:16.995 --> 01:39:30.267
But I wanted to start by reading your letter to me because I think that it will give people some understanding of where we're going with this subject matter.

01:39:30.307 --> 01:39:33.850
And the reality is that neither of us are anti-vaxxers, right?

01:39:34.110 --> 01:39:35.692
And we'll get to all of that.

01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:37.814
Both of us appreciate

01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:44.091
that modern medicine saves lives, but with everything, there's a cost-benefit analysis.

01:39:45.073 --> 01:39:51.804
And, you know, when you explained to me, this isn't about a vaccine injury, it's about what happened after.

01:39:53.522 --> 01:40:04.569
So I was like I don't know about this man, you know, I'm not a doctor not a phd I'm not a scientist, I don't know anything about this technology haven't done my homework on it, I'm probably not the appropriate person.

01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:08.872
And then I got this letter and I do remember.

01:40:10.313 --> 01:40:15.476
Meeting I put I meet at the Capitol Noel well and she's your book agent.

01:40:16.195 --> 01:40:16.415
Yeah.

01:40:16.935 --> 01:40:17.296
Okay.

01:40:17.736 --> 01:40:33.003
So when I was at the Capitol testifying to the Senate about health and wellness- If I wasn't such an absolute asshole on wheels, I would probably already have a book agent too, right?

01:40:33.023 --> 01:40:38.045
But I'm just so ornery and mean that I don't have a book agent, but she's got one.

01:40:38.486 --> 01:40:43.648
Even though AstraZeneca, we already knew it was shitty because it was a transformation with adenovirus.

01:40:43.688 --> 01:40:44.729
Like, I mean,

01:40:45.819 --> 01:40:47.820
Come on, the Maha crowd.

01:40:48.521 --> 01:40:51.842
Noel, your your person came up to me and told me about this book.

01:40:52.403 --> 01:40:53.643
And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:55.404 --> 01:41:01.488
And then she actually followed through and she emailed me and I was like, oh, God, a book about a covid vaccine injury.

01:41:01.848 --> 01:41:02.208
Hold on.

01:41:02.448 --> 01:41:04.249
Let me just jump in front of a bus.

01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.232
And then I got this letter from you.

01:41:08.252 --> 01:41:10.313
Hi, Jillian.

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:15.702
I was the woman who was injured in the clinical trials for the AstraZeneca vaccine.

01:41:17.043 --> 01:41:26.088
My injury landed me and many others at the NIH headquarters to be researched and treated for our confirmed COVID vaccine injuries.

01:41:27.068 --> 01:41:29.770
Then the findings of their study were buried.

01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:32.431
Okay.

01:41:33.544 --> 01:41:41.587
After we went rounds with the NIH and the heads of the FDA, we realized that they had no interest in addressing the harms.

01:41:42.768 --> 01:41:59.215
And after learning the drug companies have broad immunity, we started the world's largest COVID vaccine injury support nonprofit with over 36,000 members in the United States and 20 global partnerships.

01:42:00.165 --> 01:42:14.853
We've built an underground network of physicians, emotional support networks, and a medical grant program that has issued $880,000 to people harmed, double what the U.S.

01:42:14.893 --> 01:42:16.554
government has paid out to date.

01:42:17.394 --> 01:42:20.596
We're basically doing what our government should be doing.

01:42:21.926 --> 01:42:22.987
in addition to advocates.

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.821
recompense for the people that are injured.

01:42:35.901 --> 01:42:37.261
So they rushed it.

01:42:37.621 --> 01:42:40.582
There are going to be people injured by the contamination.

01:42:40.602 --> 01:42:47.624
And so this group has provided a place for them to get financial recovery money, something, something, something.

01:42:47.664 --> 01:42:49.765
But understand what it is.

01:42:49.845 --> 01:42:55.367
If they say they're not trying to stop the vaccine, they're not anti-vaccine, they don't really know anything about the vaccine.

01:42:56.167 --> 01:43:13.801
it is an absolute disaster is what it is and um i'm gonna go to basketball because i don't think that we need to watch this anymore but if you wanted to you could find that on youtube and i think it's really really instructive to see what's going on here because again she was in front of the

01:43:14.542 --> 01:43:28.507
The Senate and nobody in front of the Senate in any of those sessions has ever talked about the population pyramid as being a source of a signal that could potentially bankrupt Western nations, especially those with healthcare.

01:43:28.527 --> 01:43:40.591
I think a lot of these nations were in the same boat, including China, and that's why it was really convenient to have a story to tell about a novel virus that could be used to sort of disguise the management,

01:43:41.351 --> 01:43:47.014
the management using murder of this problem, this aging population.

01:43:47.814 --> 01:43:52.397
They used a wide variety of methods to do it, but I think they did it very successfully.

01:43:52.417 --> 01:43:56.719
And that's why, since 2020 and before, these people have agreed that

01:43:57.159 --> 01:44:07.165
There are these viruses in the background, trillions of them, as Vincent Racaniello said, and that a new one just has that special, you know, quality of being novel.

01:44:07.765 --> 01:44:13.068
And the worst case scenario would be endemicity, which really Vincent Racaniello already assumed had happened.

01:44:15.289 --> 01:44:22.653
And they covered this up with a narrative about expected outcomes of the transfection that would be rolled out a year later.

01:44:24.933 --> 01:44:26.394
And they covered that up.

01:44:26.814 --> 01:44:29.236
And what it really is, is a background signal.

01:44:29.276 --> 01:44:34.999
You can't differentiate between endemicity and a background signal if you have no data from the 10 years before the pandemic.

01:44:35.039 --> 01:44:43.985
And yet, all of these people accept the same narrative and instead also accept the same narrative about all these interesting other stories that, again,

01:44:44.625 --> 01:44:50.328
presuppose the existence of a novel virus, the mystery of whom's origin must be solved.

01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:51.949
And that is the Scooby-Doo mystery.

01:44:52.029 --> 01:45:03.255
It's a narrative that is specifically designed to get you to accept these other things are happening because of the gain of function virus and the spike protein that we're infecting, transfecting people with.

01:45:03.915 --> 01:45:07.659
rather than transfection as a methodology.

01:45:07.859 --> 01:45:10.842
And of course, that's why they say the COVID shots are bad.

01:45:10.882 --> 01:45:11.502
Don't talk about 2020.

01:45:11.842 --> 01:45:16.407
That's why none of them are talking about the murder that happened and the big signal that underlies it.

01:45:16.987 --> 01:45:23.313
And that's why none of them will talk about the background signal in both the population pyramid and in the RNA that's

01:45:23.733 --> 01:45:25.134
you know, trillions of viruses.

01:45:25.875 --> 01:45:34.481
They won't talk about how PCR can be very accurate when used in a university and very inaccurate when used as a diagnostic in a military operation.

01:45:35.122 --> 01:45:44.589
They won't define the products that existed before the pandemic as transfections and transformations, because then you'd realize the investigational vaccines already had names.

01:45:45.409 --> 01:45:57.436
They won't tell you that in their purest form, neither of these methodologies would have been suitable for healthy humans because those would have been known dangers that even we go back to Jesse Gelsinger to know the truth about that.

01:45:57.836 --> 01:46:11.924
They're definitely not gonna tell you that the transformation and transfection in cell culture is what virology is because then the grift of the no virus people would be exposed and that whole sort of limited spectrum of debate would fall apart.

01:46:11.964 --> 01:46:14.005
And that's also why nobody will just say,

01:46:14.505 --> 01:46:19.930
that RNA cannot pandemic because then the whole house of cards would collapse.

01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:28.917
Don't forget ladies and gentlemen this was me and this is you every time you get on social media and think there's a chance that somebody might go viral and save us.

01:46:29.578 --> 01:46:34.442
That's not how this works and it hasn't worked that way in a long time and maybe never.

01:46:37.116 --> 01:46:41.819
definitely weaponized piles of money have put acolytes in front of us and tricked us into arguing with them.

01:46:42.339 --> 01:46:47.022
Arguing with them has gotten us to accept this narrative and we're now passing it on to our children.

01:46:47.462 --> 01:46:52.265
If we do that, our children will be in the same situation that we found ourselves in at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:46:53.045 --> 01:46:56.248
trying to sort out a mystery that gets us enslaved.

01:46:56.328 --> 01:46:58.309
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining me.

01:46:58.369 --> 01:47:02.032
If you haven't seen it, please watch the Dear Senator Ron Johnson video.

01:47:02.112 --> 01:47:04.334
I'm very proud of the thoroughness of that message.

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:12.080
Again, these are a list of things that people won't talk about, and I think you can see through people when you use this as a filter.

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:19.726
Remember that endemicity cannot be differentiated from a background when you don't have any data from the decade before the pandemic started.

01:47:20.247 --> 01:47:23.630
And remember that the way they're getting away with it is by not talking about 2020.

01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:27.593
I love it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:27.633 --> 01:47:28.033
I love it.

01:47:28.094 --> 01:47:28.714
I can't wait.

01:47:28.814 --> 01:47:30.436
November 3rd is coming really fast.

01:47:30.476 --> 01:47:32.918
If you haven't made any plans, make sure you do.

01:47:32.998 --> 01:47:35.000
Try to be here in Bethel Park on Sunday the 3rd.

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.961
It'll definitely be worth your time to be here.

01:47:38.141 --> 01:47:43.162
If you haven't, please already go to gigaohmbiological.com and see if there's a way you might be able to support us.

01:47:43.622 --> 01:47:45.603
We need all the help we can get right now.

01:47:45.743 --> 01:47:46.963
So thank you very much.

01:47:47.023 --> 01:47:50.604
And if you share the stream, share it at stream.gigaohm.bio because we pay for that one.

01:47:50.984 --> 01:47:51.564
Thanks very much.

01:47:51.664 --> 01:47:52.485
See you soon.

01:47:52.565 --> 01:47:53.085
See you soon.

01:47:53.145 --> 01:47:53.585
See you soon.

01:49:46.738 --> 01:49:50.920
Don't forget, live in Bethel Park on November 3rd.

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:55.481
I would really love it if the entire chat would be there in person.

01:49:55.521 --> 01:49:58.722
I know that's not possible, but you know, it's just a nice thing to think about.

01:49:59.122 --> 01:49:59.863
Thanks for joining me.

01:49:59.883 --> 01:50:00.443
See you again tomorrow.
