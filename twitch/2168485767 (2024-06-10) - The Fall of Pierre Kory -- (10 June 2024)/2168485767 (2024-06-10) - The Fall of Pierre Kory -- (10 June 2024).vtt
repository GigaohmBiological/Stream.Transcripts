03:43.109 --> 03:46.251
Please, please, please go somewhere.

03:46.271 --> 03:49.273
Please go somewhere and announce that this is happening.

03:49.873 --> 03:54.937
This might be the most important broadcast that GigaOM Biological has ever done.

03:55.577 --> 03:59.740
So if you're going to share something live, this is the one to share.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.942
Because this present, once it's opened,

04:04.523 --> 04:08.769
The landslide is going to start today, I think, ladies and gentlemen, if it hasn't started already.

04:09.871 --> 04:16.820
So please take the extra time to share this and make sure that as many people as possible are here to witness it.

04:18.443 --> 04:19.264
Let's get this done.

04:49.282 --> 05:01.134
I said to Ryan, I said, Jedis don't give up.

05:01.654 --> 05:07.940
I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup.

05:08.281 --> 05:10.803
But if he made a mistake, he would try and right that wrong.

05:10.863 --> 05:12.885
So right there, we had a fundamental difference.

05:14.198 --> 05:15.339
It's not my story anymore.

05:15.579 --> 05:16.880
It's somebody else's story.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.663
And Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective.

05:22.343 --> 05:25.566
That's the crux of my problem.

05:26.386 --> 05:27.787
Luke would never say that.

05:28.468 --> 05:29.008
I'm sorry.

05:29.048 --> 05:33.071
Well, in this version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars.

05:33.411 --> 05:35.452
This is the next generation of Star Wars.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.494
So I almost had to think of Luke as another character.

05:38.514 --> 05:40.375
Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.

05:40.436 --> 05:42.417
He's not my Luke Skywalker.

05:42.797 --> 05:44.018
But I had to do what

05:44.458 --> 05:48.141
Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well.

05:48.201 --> 05:52.644
But listen, I still haven't accepted it completely, but it's only a movie.

05:52.744 --> 05:53.744
I hope people like it.

05:53.784 --> 05:54.925
I hope they don't get upset.

05:54.985 --> 06:00.809
And I came to really believe that Ryan was the exact man that they needed for this job.

06:02.971 --> 06:07.714
So the real question here with regard to putting Mark Hamill on the spot,

06:08.817 --> 06:14.201
really is to illustrate that all it takes is a spectacular commitment to lies.

06:15.162 --> 06:26.230
Mark Hamill just has had to stay committed long enough, keep his mouth shut long enough, for them to make the millions of dollars and ruin the Star Wars franchise just like they intended.

06:27.190 --> 06:36.818
It's easy for an eight-year-old to see that what was written as the sequels to the original trilogy and the prequels, they're all terrible.

06:37.459 --> 06:51.950
But the ones that were just recently released during kind of this transition into this bizarro world that we're now in, there's no way to explain it with creativity or with a subtle pivot to a new story.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.814
They just destroyed something that they could have otherwise just made up something else.

06:57.074 --> 07:07.061
And Mark Hamill just had to stay committed long enough to that lie so that it would effectively be irrelevant what he thinks.

07:07.901 --> 07:09.042
And that's why I show it.

07:09.102 --> 07:23.652
There's lots of people that are involved in the pandemic right now that could have told us a lot sooner and will eventually tell us, but they won't actually tell us that they knew all along that they are actually responsible

07:24.372 --> 07:25.933
for all the tickets being sold.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.115
They're responsible for everybody getting on the bandwagon.

07:29.155 --> 07:33.638
And it's partly because when they could have, they didn't say it.

07:34.319 --> 07:37.060
And in fact, they agreed not to say it.

07:37.841 --> 07:43.385
And then more than one of them went on a podcast and said it and didn't say it.

07:44.252 --> 07:55.095
And when you go back to 2020 and 21, there's nothing else to see other than the very actual spiritual wickedness that exists in these places.

07:55.716 --> 07:58.476
Ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be one of the most important shows.

07:58.977 --> 08:04.178
And this whole summer is going to be full of these important shows unless they start erasing pretty quick.

08:04.338 --> 08:06.959
Oh, wait, we've archived it all already.

09:00.051 --> 09:00.132
you

09:37.779 --> 09:41.961
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

09:42.461 --> 09:46.642
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

09:47.123 --> 09:51.304
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

09:53.185 --> 09:54.746
I think truth is good for kids.

09:55.186 --> 09:58.947
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.088
We want everybody to feel good.

10:01.108 --> 10:03.189
That's not the way life is.

10:05.967 --> 10:09.889
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

10:11.690 --> 10:12.390
And I have lied.

10:12.410 --> 10:13.451
I'm sure I'll lie again.

10:13.471 --> 10:14.411
I don't want to lie.

10:14.892 --> 10:16.232
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

10:16.352 --> 10:17.393
I try not to be a liar.

10:17.413 --> 10:18.253
I don't want to be a liar.

10:18.814 --> 10:21.535
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

10:25.441 --> 10:43.975
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

10:43.995 --> 10:53.563
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

10:57.295 --> 11:10.206
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

11:10.307 --> 11:15.831
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

11:16.132 --> 11:18.073
It's just a big hassle in the end.

11:20.095 --> 11:34.422
No, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

11:34.482 --> 11:36.983
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

11:42.731 --> 11:43.131
so so

12:23.310 --> 12:30.432
The unfortunate thing for Sam Harris is that that recording is from the eighth podcast that Bret Weinstein ever did.

12:30.952 --> 12:41.456
The eighth podcast that actually occurred in December of 2019, right before the extremely deadly pandemic that we wouldn't be able to tolerate the anti-vax position during.

12:42.236 --> 12:46.258
So it's more than a premonition.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.739
It's more than a prediction.

12:47.939 --> 12:52.321
It was a pre-programmed part of the script.

12:52.521 --> 12:57.543
And what we're really doing, Replay Sound is a quarter of me.

12:57.563 --> 13:01.905
Okay, so I should turn myself down a little bit, I guess.

13:02.485 --> 13:05.288
Um I got the music really low but my ears, I don't know.

13:05.648 --> 13:07.249
Thanks for the feedback though Pamela.

13:08.050 --> 13:11.853
Um we are still in interesting times.

13:12.453 --> 13:17.117
Um it's gonna get more interesting I think because the truth is about to

13:18.223 --> 13:19.464
get a few more dimensions.

13:20.165 --> 13:30.393
And as the truth, as we add more dimensions to the truth, as we look backwards, what we perceive to be true and what is true starts to overlap.

13:30.934 --> 13:33.016
And that's really not useful to these people.

13:34.417 --> 13:39.501
Because our consciousness is a prime real estate that they've been in control of for four years.

13:40.242 --> 13:42.183
And as we start to escape control,

13:43.761 --> 13:51.467
and we start to see things for what they really are, we also start to see people for who they really are.

13:57.411 --> 14:08.199
Sometimes I'm starting to get suspicious because still nobody's really talking about this list.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.442
Still there's really nobody talking about this list.

14:16.331 --> 14:38.048
The only person that really dares to talk about this, of course except for my friend Mark Kulak of Housatonic who I do absolutely trust, is occasionally Nick Hudson and occasionally an anonymous account that I think is someone in Australia.

14:39.319 --> 14:42.840
Jikki Leaks, these are the only two people besides Mark.

14:43.701 --> 14:58.625
So this whole list right here, this whole list right here, it's only Mark and occasionally Nick, and occasionally Jikki Leaks, because I don't really pay attention to that too much.

14:58.725 --> 15:03.147
But I do notice that Nick has done it, these two lists right here.

15:04.344 --> 15:12.612
mentioning that the protocols are murder, that gain-of-function is a mythology, that they fooled us into doing it, and that all it takes is a spectacular commitment to lies.

15:14.253 --> 15:15.414
It's not very many people.

15:19.298 --> 15:27.985
And maybe, maybe I don't care about what other people think about me as long as they don't attribute bad motives, but just keep

15:28.993 --> 15:31.155
pointing out what we're teaching.

15:31.215 --> 15:44.447
So if Jiki stops pointing out what we're teaching and starts attributing just bad motives, I don't know, then I guess I stop, you know, listening or communicating or I don't really promote him.

15:45.127 --> 15:46.268
He's in a different trap.

15:46.348 --> 15:47.549
See, that's part of the problem.

15:47.649 --> 15:48.930
Clucky Ducky, the same thing.

15:49.671 --> 16:04.783
Clucky and Ducky have never done and said anything disparaging to me, never said don't follow me, and never really promoted things that I necessarily disagree with, except for maybe they still have some faith that there's a gain-of-function virus.

16:04.863 --> 16:13.169
But it took me three years of hard work to see through the gain-of-function virus narrative, and so maybe it'll take other people longer.

16:14.550 --> 16:17.933
I'm noticing a pattern of people who do not

16:19.955 --> 16:22.496
acknowledge Giga Home Biological.

16:22.756 --> 16:28.499
And if they do, they acknowledge it in a bad way, in a negative way, or in a non-useful way.

16:31.000 --> 16:41.525
And this list of people that doesn't acknowledge Giga Home Biological in a useful way, it spans the entire list of characters in this play.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.979
You can, I have selfies with all of them.

16:45.039 --> 16:46.500
They all know who I am.

16:46.540 --> 16:47.881
They've all shaken my hand.

16:47.901 --> 16:56.586
They've all told me face to face that they love the work that GigaOM Biological does, but you'd never know if you looked at their social media.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.749
You'd never know that they learned anything from me.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.571
And that's really the extraordinary part.

17:03.591 --> 17:10.236
You can be listed as the foremost, the first expert that contributed to a book.

17:11.377 --> 17:16.002
And that person who wrote that book can completely ignore you as an expert.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.827
Even as soon as one month after the book is released.

17:22.128 --> 17:34.381
And so they're in an interesting place because as GigaOM Biological and our followers are surfing this wave, this manufactured wave of lies, the liars have to pretend that we're not surfing it.

17:35.677 --> 17:43.144
The liars have to pretend that we're just in the water like everybody else and not on our way to the shore in style.

17:43.845 --> 17:51.912
But actually we are on our way to the shore in style and it might even be not the skilled TV watchers down here anymore.

17:53.834 --> 17:54.975
We might have to edit this.

17:55.896 --> 17:59.740
We might have to edit this and say the coordinated

18:06.036 --> 18:12.980
Liars, actually, are being run over by the wave of lies.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.481
And that's really actually where we might be.

18:20.164 --> 18:20.864
It's interesting.

18:21.765 --> 18:32.211
I'm very, very curious as to whether or not we can stay focused on the biology, not take their bait on social media and love our neighbor enough to get out of this, but I think we can.

18:38.376 --> 18:44.221
So please keep sharing because this is really crucial that as many people as possible get where we are.

18:44.821 --> 18:56.310
And that means even sharing this with Jiki because maybe we can learn more about these loyalties that these people have and how they're not related to saving America.

18:56.350 --> 18:58.532
Because I'll tell ya, I'm gonna be real straight.

18:59.673 --> 19:16.854
I'm an American, and the way that I understand this situation is that everybody, because we each have different legal systems, and we have a different set of laws that has been used against us, it's actually important for individual states to organize a way

19:17.535 --> 19:20.117
to repel this action.

19:20.597 --> 19:31.884
So Pennsylvania needs to locally organize and make sure that there aren't laws in Pennsylvania which do not allow us to engage in informed non-compliance.

19:32.304 --> 19:42.411
We need to look if there are laws in every of the 50 states and how they could be used potentially against us in cooperation with or in concert with federal laws.

19:42.831 --> 19:48.940
And these are very serious legal issues that we need real lawyers that are taking it seriously.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.623
We need them to be working on this.

19:51.763 --> 19:51.944
Look.

19:53.373 --> 19:54.553
We don't need music for this.

19:54.593 --> 19:55.534
We just need people.

19:56.314 --> 19:57.214
You just need somebody.

19:57.714 --> 20:18.760
We need real lawyers in America that understand the legal system, that have been working in it for years, that understand the problem that we face and to organize in such a way so that each individual state has a group of people, a group of patriots that's genuinely interested in making sure that the laws of that particular state are such

20:19.648 --> 20:33.116
that the PrEP Act and the 21st Century Cares Act and all this other shit, the 21st Century Cures Act, I don't know, that cannot work together in concert to enslave us.

20:35.358 --> 20:47.025
And so we can talk all we want about censorship on social media and all these other non-issues with lots of lawyers screaming and yelling about how the who is gonna do all this stuff,

20:47.884 --> 21:05.482
When in reality, what we need are state-by-state organizations, little groups that are organized with real expertise, lawyers that are maybe volunteering their time to make a citizen's effort to remove

21:06.408 --> 21:18.896
the teeth or even the public health laws in general that have been put in place to enable this kind of thing to happen again and to prevent it from ever happening again.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.500
And so anybody that's doing that I think is legitimate.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.381
I just don't know very many people who are.

21:25.401 --> 21:34.387
I mean, Meryl Nass has decided to start another nonprofit organized against the who when she was already helping CHD who's organized against the who.

21:37.150 --> 21:47.661
And so we don't have these organizations of lawyers that are actually working to change the appropriate laws that people like Catherine Watt have outlined as well.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.223
We need to get rid of all these things, change all of these things.

21:50.263 --> 21:51.524
We have no lawyers.

21:52.225 --> 22:05.482
that are working to do this and we have no lawyers that are trying to educate anyone in Pennsylvania about how Pennsylvania laws need changing or how Illinois law needs changing or why Pennsylvania law is an example for how they could do it in Illinois.

22:05.542 --> 22:10.348
I don't know because there's no lawyers who are taking this as serious.

22:11.974 --> 22:19.122
There isn't one lawyer that I know of on social media that is saying that, you know, the laws in such and such a state are pretty good.

22:19.142 --> 22:26.792
And maybe we should use those as a template for other laws and other states, or we could use that law as a template to show you why those laws are lame.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.396
There's no lawyer, not one talking about this stuff.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.978
This should be terrifying.

22:35.444 --> 22:36.585
And yet nobody cares.

22:36.665 --> 22:39.969
The whole social media seems to agree that this is just a non-issue.

22:39.989 --> 22:44.554
Like what is Jonathan Cooey talking about with informed non-compliance?

22:45.275 --> 22:46.096
What is he saying?

22:46.997 --> 22:48.739
He's just trying to divide everybody.

22:48.799 --> 22:51.141
No, I'm trying to show you that there is no one.

22:52.343 --> 22:53.984
There's no one coming to our rescue.

22:54.845 --> 22:55.286
No one.

23:06.820 --> 23:06.900
So,

23:41.233 --> 23:43.874
I will admit, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

23:43.914 --> 23:48.517
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

23:48.577 --> 23:49.377
It's June 10th.

23:49.417 --> 23:52.419
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

23:53.639 --> 23:55.720
I'm very happy that everyone is here.

23:55.740 --> 24:05.165
I just want to make very clear that first and foremost, I think as a rule, number one, anonymity on social media is great.

24:05.785 --> 24:26.272
But anonymity as far as being a thought leader or anonymity as far as being somebody who is going to, let's say, purport to be a patriot of a particular country and purport to be someone who's really trying to help not themselves, but their children and their children's children, I don't think anonymity is often very helpful.

24:26.932 --> 24:39.606
And I understand that there are people who have to remain anonymous because of the life situation that they're in, but I will say it over and over again, there's not a single anonymous account that I trust.

24:40.467 --> 24:41.868
And that includes JikiLeaks.

24:42.429 --> 24:47.514
JikiLeaks has been interesting because, as I've pointed out repeatedly, he doesn't really

24:49.266 --> 24:50.627
publicly attack me.

24:50.727 --> 24:55.771
He's publicly attacked a lot of other people, but he or she has not publicly attacked me.

24:55.791 --> 25:04.697
And if he or she has, I have not seen it, and that's fine, because I don't take these anonymous accounts very seriously.

25:04.757 --> 25:12.823
But I do think that interacting with something, some of them, especially one as prominent as Jiki, who I think is

25:14.397 --> 25:18.621
can be pretty confidently linked with a substack that we all know the name of.

25:21.784 --> 25:31.132
I do feel like there's been a lot of good ideas that have been promulgated by this account, and it's important to see that.

25:33.311 --> 25:38.835
Part of the way that I myself have pulled myself through this cave is to watch these patterns.

25:39.035 --> 25:46.480
And I don't care about the vast majority of these accounts because the vast majority of these accounts haven't had a, there's no pattern to look at.

25:47.701 --> 25:55.867
They haven't been there in my view, but this account has been around for a long time and more or less behaving pretty consistently.

25:57.620 --> 26:03.304
And so if it's useful to watch the behavior of this account, then I watch it.

26:03.504 --> 26:21.456
And if it's useful to watch some of these other accounts, I think you should, but you always need to understand that the moment you're paying attention to an anonymous account, you don't know for absolute certain whether you're watching the pattern of that person or a collection of people or worse.

26:22.574 --> 26:31.840
And so that's why I err on the side of, you know, if you're trusting anonymous accounts, you could be trusting yourself to foreign traders, which is very, very likely.

26:33.361 --> 26:44.868
And the worst case scenario is still bad, or sorry, the best case scenario is still quite significant because each country is its own trap.

26:44.928 --> 26:47.150
They were shown a different social media.

26:47.930 --> 26:50.272
They saw a different set of influencers.

26:51.892 --> 26:56.536
I mean, there's this whole thing in Australia called Quillette or something like that.

26:56.576 --> 26:59.078
It's kind of like a substack, but it's not a substack.

27:00.219 --> 27:04.642
And they had all of their own debates and their own arguments down there.

27:05.102 --> 27:18.773
And they had their own, you know, forums and their own social media groups that were all different bubbles that were seeing a different reflection of what was happening in the United States, a different fraction of the

27:20.234 --> 27:22.895
the limited spectrum of debate that was presented to us.

27:24.516 --> 27:43.423
We can't, it would be very, very dangerous to try and put a cap on the amount of distortion that was created on purpose, even between different states and different TV regions in America.

27:43.943 --> 27:48.505
Nevermind the amount of distortion that was created across languages

27:50.737 --> 27:57.060
or across time zones or across whole government infrastructures.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.921
They all have their own private partnership with the media of their own countries.

28:01.361 --> 28:12.386
And so they had their own preexisting set of medium level influencers and medium level discussion forums and medium level thought bubbles.

28:14.327 --> 28:20.169
And there's no way for any of us from our perspective, where our IP address is,

28:22.540 --> 28:26.062
to see what other people with other IP addresses see.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.022
There's no way.

28:29.984 --> 28:36.827
And those people are allowing those thoughts in their head all the time as they scroll the same way that we were.

28:37.567 --> 28:42.570
And because we were under the assumption that, well, when we scroll, we either see the same thing that they see.

28:43.110 --> 28:45.231
And that's just absolutely absurd.

28:46.840 --> 29:05.345
And so it's possible that through the careful use of these social media tools and the pre-programming of them, that people have been very efficiently led to believe that good people in one region are bad from the perspective of another region and vice versa.

29:06.556 --> 29:18.651
so that the groups that we have established in each individual country are actually focused on bad guys in other countries, which is a pattern that was established very early by people like Kevin McCairn.

29:20.134 --> 29:27.721
that extremely early in March of 2020 already knew that Andrew Kaufman in America was somebody that I needed to oppose.

29:29.322 --> 29:33.786
And Sam Bailey in New Zealand is somebody that we all need to oppose.

29:34.527 --> 29:45.036
What an interesting random choice out of the, what is it, seven billion people on the planet to just pull out of the hat that you're sure that the no virus people that we have to oppose are these two?

29:48.260 --> 30:17.851
And I only have examples from my experience of looking backwards and seeing how scripted these people were, but we all have an experience that we scrolled through on social media, that if you can peel back the layers of your own memory and look back on it, you're gonna see that it didn't matter what stage you went to in this Lollapalooza of lies, you were gonna essentially get onto this train where you were influenced by a group of people who seemed to agree about particular questions.

30:21.229 --> 30:24.551
And if you want homework, all you gotta do is go on the internet and find it.

30:26.072 --> 30:27.373
I'm a human just like you.

30:27.473 --> 30:28.994
I got a limited amount of time.

30:29.054 --> 30:30.535
I got kids that want my time.

30:30.615 --> 30:43.643
I have a wife that I'm trying to maintain a relationship with as a friend and as a colleague and as a lover and as a best friend and as a life partner.

30:46.986 --> 30:50.448
And so it's a, this is just a real guy here.

30:52.566 --> 30:57.329
And I'm going to be in South Dakota this coming weekend.

30:57.649 --> 31:02.992
And like I've done for the entire pandemic, I'm going to put it all on the line.

31:03.912 --> 31:07.314
I'm going to play it as if this is my one chance.

31:07.434 --> 31:13.518
I'm going to Madison Square Garden, and they're actually going to give me a spotlight and the microphone.

31:14.398 --> 31:15.119
What are you going to say?

31:16.940 --> 31:17.920
That's how I'm playing this.

31:21.355 --> 31:22.835
And I'm not going to pull any punches.

31:23.856 --> 31:25.896
I do think that there is a message here.

31:25.916 --> 31:29.837
I do think there's a message here.

31:31.017 --> 31:33.798
And I am going to try and leave them with these thoughts.

31:34.998 --> 31:41.660
But I hope you won't be disappointed if the talk is sharper than that.

31:44.841 --> 31:46.602
You've only seen me improvise.

31:47.582 --> 31:57.045
You've only seen me just basically shoot from the cuff for four years in the sense of I throw up a video or I throw up a slide and I talk about it.

31:58.145 --> 32:00.086
You've never seen what I do when I plan it.

32:03.067 --> 32:08.569
And none of these people have actually, which is actually probably what makes them the most frightened.

32:11.152 --> 32:15.674
But they don't really have any options at this stage, other than to maybe run me over.

32:20.015 --> 32:22.456
And then my children will be their problem.

32:24.137 --> 32:29.639
So, we don't need to fear any free-range RNA molecules, I assure you of that.

32:29.939 --> 32:37.102
And these people have gotten a lot of influencers to agree that we don't need to worry about the murder because this was a lab leak.

32:38.499 --> 32:44.263
And they've also gotten a bunch of influencers to agree that the old vaccine schedule isn't even on our radar anymore.

32:44.303 --> 32:47.045
I mean, it's the new vaccine schedule that we're concerned about.

32:56.431 --> 33:01.715
And it's the spectacular commitment to these lies that what's allowing them to do it.

33:02.597 --> 33:03.818
It is that concert.

33:04.458 --> 33:10.863
This is the harmony between all of the acts at this Lollapalooza of lies.

33:11.864 --> 33:12.845
It's the same.

33:13.746 --> 33:16.468
This is the song they will all cover.

33:17.168 --> 33:32.280
And they cover it in their own way, with their own set of instruments, with their own set of unique quirks, maybe with a surfboard picture or, I don't know, a comment from their graduate students.

33:36.345 --> 33:40.947
And so I think that this is pretty much the most succinct summary of where we are right now.

33:41.768 --> 33:43.668
There aren't very many people you can trust.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.671
Actually, the less you hear about them, the more likely it is you can trust them.

33:50.432 --> 33:59.696
And so as you watch these people rising through social media with 200,000 followers and saying all kinds of things that everybody sees,

34:02.031 --> 34:05.314
just realize that that can only happen if it's by permission.

34:06.055 --> 34:13.642
There is no one that reaches the level of 250,000 followers on Twitter that hasn't reached that with permission.

34:15.463 --> 34:25.573
There's just no other way to explain how it is that somehow or another, I mean, I guess it's possible, but there's no other way to explain what you see.

34:27.623 --> 34:30.044
These people are playing a very malevolent game.

34:30.345 --> 34:41.249
Wittingly or unwittingly, they are essentially traitors to the American Republic and to all the free countries of the West that thought that we were all on the same team somehow, NATO or whatever they call it.

34:43.710 --> 34:51.454
These people have all agreed to agree that we need to fear free-range RNA molecules, and it's the one lie that they're not going to question.

34:52.423 --> 35:04.373
And the only people that were pretending to usefully question it from 2020, 21 and 22 are up there in the corner and they didn't do a very good job of it for a long time.

35:05.374 --> 35:07.016
And I think that was also by design.

35:07.836 --> 35:13.861
And so that's why they don't like me either because I have critique for their 2020 and 21 presentations as well.

35:14.742 --> 35:18.726
Just like I have critique for my own, but a lot of the reason why I

35:20.020 --> 35:32.346
was unable to succeed in being where I am now in 2021 was precisely because of these people on this screen and the selfies that I've taken with them.

35:34.207 --> 35:48.095
And so that's why I have a particular vendetta with a particular group of people that I'm pretty sure have been lying consistently since the beginning of the pandemic and why I feel an obligation to call them out as if every stream is my last stream.

35:49.304 --> 35:54.965
I have to call out these people because I believe that this is the story that breaks their back.

35:55.085 --> 35:56.906
This is the story that breaks the reed.

35:57.006 --> 35:58.746
It bends it too far and it snaps.

36:00.907 --> 36:15.090
Once you start to inspect what it is precisely that these people said in 2020 and how they were able to say it uncensored or conspicuously censored, you start to realize that the pattern is unmistakable.

36:16.547 --> 36:19.468
And you don't have to look at any particular cast of characters.

36:19.528 --> 36:25.531
It's just unfortunate or fortunate for me that most of the cast of characters has interacted with me.

36:26.191 --> 36:28.532
So many of them decided to come to Pittsburgh.

36:29.032 --> 36:36.335
So many of them decided to be on my podcast early on before they realized how far off script they were gonna have to go.

36:37.675 --> 36:43.898
In fact, before they realized that there is no how far off script do we have to go before Cooey shuts his mouth.

36:47.008 --> 36:59.674
That's why I feel like I need to call out particular people who have been exposed to me in very particular ways by very particular people using very particular words, mostly flattery and then cover up.

37:00.895 --> 37:02.476
Flattery and then talking over.

37:06.812 --> 37:27.298
And make no mistake about it, I don't think this is exciting for me to be able to, or have to, or feel the need to use as armor the fact that I think it is very likely that the guy in the middle is on the same team as the lady over here, and the guy up there, and the lady down there in the bottom corner, and maybe even Tess.

37:28.158 --> 37:40.804
I just think Tess probably doesn't know to the extent to which she's being used by Epigirl and by Anthrax Lady and by Ditraman.

37:45.446 --> 37:46.227
So it's not fun.

37:47.147 --> 37:50.969
That's why I'm streaming like every one of these streams is my last stream.

37:52.069 --> 37:52.890
Because it could be.

37:54.053 --> 37:58.640
For whatever reason, I think that now I'm really causing a problem.

38:01.004 --> 38:02.706
I'm really causing a problem for them.

38:05.130 --> 38:06.532
What I want is high morbidity.

38:07.093 --> 38:08.075
I want people to complain.

38:08.856 --> 38:09.297
So what do I do?

38:10.040 --> 38:10.720
I go to Des Moines.

38:11.341 --> 38:13.622
Ladies and gentlemen, the people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines.

38:13.642 --> 38:14.422
I lived there for four years.

38:14.802 --> 38:15.562
I go to Des Moines.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.324
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

38:19.104 --> 38:19.924
I go to Seattle.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.065
I infect a couple of cases there.

38:22.746 --> 38:24.486
I go to North Carolina.

38:24.666 --> 38:26.127
I go to Wisconsin.

38:26.507 --> 38:33.250
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

38:33.710 --> 38:34.931
These individuals complain.

38:34.991 --> 38:36.832
Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

38:37.072 --> 38:38.933
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

38:39.758 --> 38:44.403
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

38:44.984 --> 38:58.940
Wouldn't it be really crazy if the bug wasn't even a toxin, but it was just getting people to use supplementary oxygen in a maladaptive, nasty way so that they would progress to ARDS?

39:02.455 --> 39:11.041
So instead of seeding a toxin like Sasha Latupova, so sure that the DOD did, there's no viruses, but they use toxins instead.

39:11.101 --> 39:21.788
Just like James Giordano said, it couldn't be a really bad idea that gets misconstrued as either a virus or a toxin.

39:21.808 --> 39:23.289
And we can argue about that forever.

39:26.018 --> 39:41.301
Because as long as you're arguing about whether it was a toxin or what toxin it was, or whether it was a virus or an exosome or whatever, you're not acknowledging that there are other ways that the protocol could have been used to create the illusion of a pandemic.

39:43.081 --> 39:47.502
And so if you do remdesivir, for example, well, then they still got to get in there somehow.

39:49.862 --> 39:53.363
If you do ivermectin, then you presume the existence of the virus.

39:55.629 --> 40:08.960
And so there's one key issue to all of this that is missing, and that is, of course, that SARS and SARS-2 are associated specifically with ARDS.

40:09.040 --> 40:09.821
And you can look it up.

40:09.861 --> 40:17.067
There's papers all over the universe of this, thousands of them, throughout the history of this recent mythology.

40:18.928 --> 40:20.690
Now, keep in mind, stay with me here.

40:22.108 --> 40:26.811
All you gotta do is get to ARDS in order to get to a SARS virus.

40:28.493 --> 40:46.386
And so if the way to get to ARDS is simply the poor application of supplemental oxygen, and you could get doctors to accept a story about we don't know what to do, we don't have anything, this is a new thing.

40:46.946 --> 40:50.789
The best we can do is supplemental oxygen.

40:52.281 --> 41:03.587
you might have a very, very interesting adaptation of the, again, remember, public facing version of the biosecurity narrative.

41:04.888 --> 41:15.614
The public facing version is, James D'Origiano says, is that you release a toxin and then you tell everybody on the internet that it's spreading with asymptomatic prodrome stuff.

41:18.689 --> 41:25.733
So maybe the secret version is that you don't release a toxin, you just start with some murder and lie about it.

41:27.314 --> 41:38.420
And specifically lie about all the ways that the murder is happening so that nobody realizes how it's happening, which is, I think it's possible.

41:39.180 --> 41:45.684
In fact, it's worth seriously considering the possibility that it was the pulse ox lie

41:55.000 --> 41:56.941
I think it's really worth considering this.

42:00.363 --> 42:21.796
It's worth considering because Brett Weinstein is a very curious little meddler in this, who I was in a signal chat for a long time with some very conspicuous players that include an account by the name of Rollergator, Dr. Rollergator.

42:21.836 --> 42:22.977
You can find him on Twitter.

42:23.857 --> 42:30.699
Chris Martinson, Alexandros Marinos, who was exclusively on ivermectin for more than a year.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.921
Brett Weinstein, his wife.

42:37.482 --> 42:47.245
Chris Martinson, who is a retired pharma exec who's living off the grid and who was promoted by PBS NewsHour in 2008 or 2010 or whenever it was.

42:51.306 --> 43:08.697
All of those people have consistently ignored me since learning almost everything they purport to know from me in that little signal chat, which is still unfortunately for them preserved on my phone and elsewhere.

43:12.359 --> 43:14.880
So it feels like the clock is ticking.

43:16.161 --> 43:20.804
It feels like they're just running out the clock and the clock is actually running out on them.

43:23.473 --> 43:25.735
That's why I'm calling all these names out.

43:25.855 --> 43:28.497
That's why I am confident that we can do it.

43:30.079 --> 43:48.354
Because once you realize where this all comes back to, once you realize that these pictures could not exist if I was wrong, the patterns that these people behave and follow could not be otherwise.

43:48.854 --> 43:50.496
It just simply can't be possible.

43:52.418 --> 44:00.105
The only way to explain this is that all these people are ignoring me because the truth is inconvenient.

44:01.326 --> 44:03.668
The truth is really a problem.

44:04.910 --> 44:06.131
We're not supposed to get there yet.

44:10.077 --> 44:11.778
And so we're trying to break free of this.

44:12.179 --> 44:18.444
I'm trying to break free of this limited spectrum of debate by assuming that that's what all these people are doing and it's working very well.

44:18.964 --> 44:27.171
We had a very interesting revelation yesterday about the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

44:27.791 --> 44:33.856
When we realized that something very interesting was missing from the hero Corey timeline.

44:37.478 --> 44:40.981
a timeline that has been curated by only certain people.

44:41.341 --> 44:47.365
I'm not so interested in Pierre Kory that I've actually sat down and done a timeline of it.

44:47.445 --> 44:54.971
I've been focused on this stuff, and more importantly, focused on trying to find as many different ways as possible to say those three things.

44:56.712 --> 45:05.259
And although people have come around and said, yeah, I really like what Jay's saying, very few of them, and I mean very few, are able to just share it.

45:06.021 --> 45:10.010
You know, like you could clip this as a picture and put it on your tweet or something like that.

45:10.070 --> 45:14.219
But very few, no, actually almost no one has done that.

45:15.061 --> 45:16.965
No one that's not in our chat regularly.

45:21.209 --> 45:25.512
And we've seen this crack pipe theme go around now with debunk the funk jumping on board.

45:25.913 --> 45:26.953
And it's hilarious, right?

45:26.993 --> 45:39.883
Because this again is the best response that they have to me trying to get somebody to say that weaponized piles of money have gotten a lot of people on the internet to agree that it's not murder, but it was gain of function.

45:41.825 --> 45:45.287
And they've gotten it to happen by performing this little act.

45:47.649 --> 45:49.170
And I think one of the most

45:50.214 --> 45:53.919
egregious of these performers is Pierre Kory.

45:55.361 --> 46:04.833
I think it's possible that Pierre Kory and a few people that worked with him are responsible for this being lost, that nobody's talking about it.

46:04.853 --> 46:08.258
You know who the person who first talked about this was?

46:09.514 --> 46:12.215
You know who the first person that brought this to us was?

46:12.675 --> 46:22.719
You're gonna think, oh, maybe it was Jonathan Engler, or was it Jessica Hockett, or was it, I don't know, maybe it was, who else is really good in this field?

46:22.759 --> 46:26.881
Maybe it was Mark Kulak, or maybe it was Jonathan Cooley who thought of it.

46:27.261 --> 46:31.963
All, all of those would be, all of those would be wrong.

46:32.703 --> 46:33.884
It was Grace's dad.

46:36.041 --> 46:39.563
Grace's dad actually, and look that guy up, please.

46:40.584 --> 46:54.434
Grace's dad is the one that pointed out that the FLCCC protocol recommended that if your pulse ox was below 94, you should seek help immediately.

46:55.374 --> 46:56.095
Stop lying.

46:56.995 --> 46:58.256
That's pretty significant.

46:59.037 --> 47:03.880
It's also pretty significant that nobody shares Grace's dad's work.

47:04.540 --> 47:05.001
Nobody.

47:06.041 --> 47:07.982
Where is he on the internet?

47:08.022 --> 47:09.043
Where is he on Twitter?

47:09.083 --> 47:13.926
Where's these people, all these mice sharing the story of Grace's dad?

47:13.966 --> 47:16.788
Where's CHD sharing the story of Grace's dad?

47:16.848 --> 47:21.331
Where are all these people sharing the story, having him on their podcast?

47:22.892 --> 47:23.353
Nowhere.

47:24.413 --> 47:31.198
But Grace's dad is the one who showed us that the FLCC protocol said 94%, you better go to the hospital.

47:32.038 --> 47:33.620
And who's the head of the FLCCC?

47:35.472 --> 47:37.514
Who's the one who's been pushing that train around?

47:38.856 --> 47:41.759
Chalking his hands up on podcasts every week.

47:59.761 --> 48:02.844
Grace's dad, big shout out to Grace's dad.

48:02.884 --> 48:04.706
He saw stuff that we did not see.

48:04.806 --> 48:09.310
I can't believe I didn't see it, but shout out to Grace's dad.

48:09.350 --> 48:10.832
Let's listen to Pierre and Brett from 2021.

48:12.293 --> 48:22.823
I believe the date is June 1st, which would mean in the timeline of the theater, they thought that it would be better to bring Pierre Cory on stage first.

48:23.709 --> 48:37.102
so that when Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone showed up a couple weeks later, Bret Weinstein would already have developed his schtick with regard to ivermectin being the ultimate prophylactic.

48:37.796 --> 48:51.280
which if you have forgotten on June 21st, 2020, Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch went on the Brett Weinstein podcast for a three hour tirade about how they were going to save everyone.

48:52.020 --> 48:59.983
And the main message was basically prophylactic use of ivermectin for 30 days would clear the earth and get us to zero COVID.

49:05.126 --> 49:09.807
So I'm going to really admit I haven't watched this movie since this video since it came out.

49:09.827 --> 49:17.510
And I don't even know if I watched it when it came out because I wasn't really following Brett and his podcast.

49:17.570 --> 49:21.531
I was connected with Brett before I knew who Brett really was.

49:21.591 --> 49:22.371
And that's the truth.

49:23.972 --> 49:26.352
Somebody told me, do you watch Brett Weinstein?

49:26.673 --> 49:28.973
And I said, I don't even know really who that is.

49:29.353 --> 49:32.554
And then I looked him up and I thought, yeah, connect me with him.

49:33.975 --> 49:34.655
That's the truth.

49:36.673 --> 49:45.099
And so if you knew who that person was who said, do you know who Brett Weinstein was, then you would be able to go, wow, wait a minute, what, really that person?

49:47.201 --> 49:48.281
And so I know who it is.

49:48.301 --> 49:55.567
And I can say it out loud whenever I want to, but people who have been following me for a long time know definitely who that is.

49:56.573 --> 50:00.856
It's a very conspicuous name in my 2021 timeline.

50:01.817 --> 50:07.261
That's very conspicuously absent from my 2022 and 23 and 24 timeline.

50:08.822 --> 50:12.965
In fact, vanished in 21 already for all practical purposes.

50:15.106 --> 50:21.150
It's a very, very interesting web that I exist within.

50:21.951 --> 50:24.413
And most of these people still think they have some

50:27.455 --> 50:30.398
some semblance of a disguise left, which is pretty funny.

50:32.319 --> 50:36.443
But I'm just telling everybody now, just trying to be honest to all of y'all out there.

50:37.203 --> 50:44.409
I know who almost all of you are because of the mistakes that you make or made.

50:45.370 --> 50:47.652
And this one here, this one is really good.

50:48.413 --> 50:50.414
This one is really, really good.

50:51.835 --> 50:54.358
Let's take a look at what we've got here.

50:55.638 --> 50:59.260
I need to look for Corey, Brett, Rogan.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.701
No, we don't want that one.

51:00.741 --> 51:02.682
That one I think was later.

51:02.702 --> 51:08.625
We need Corey and the Brett.

51:09.246 --> 51:10.787
Alex Jones, no.

51:11.227 --> 51:11.647
Where is it?

51:12.287 --> 51:13.068
I just saved it.

51:15.529 --> 51:17.010
I just don't remember what I named it.

51:17.050 --> 51:18.531
Sorry guys, I don't mean to do this.

51:19.251 --> 51:19.592
Darn it.

51:22.513 --> 51:23.154
There it is, sorry.

51:49.602 --> 51:59.390
He is also a- Hey folks, welcome to the Dark Horse Podcast.

51:59.730 --> 52:00.771
I am Dr. Brett Weinstein.

52:00.831 --> 52:09.698
I am sitting with Dr. Pierre Kory, who is the president and chief medical officer of the FLCCC, which is the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance.

52:10.038 --> 52:13.260
He is also a lung specialist and an ICU specialist.

52:13.681 --> 52:14.681
Welcome Dr. Kory.

52:15.002 --> 52:15.782
Brett, thanks for having me.

52:15.902 --> 52:16.423
Really good to be here.

52:16.963 --> 52:19.644
I could not be more excited about this podcast.

52:19.744 --> 52:27.268
I really have the sense that the story that you and I are about to delve into couldn't possibly be more important.

52:27.348 --> 52:31.790
There's a tremendously hopeful aspect of it, and there's a tremendously frightening aspect of it.

52:32.710 --> 52:36.552
And I am just simply looking forward to having it in the world well understood.

52:37.252 --> 52:44.015
Before we do that, though, I think I need to say a word or two in light of the fact that there is what we will talk about, an industrial strength campaign

52:44.536 --> 52:49.136
to censor this story and I need to say something rather directly to those who are most likely to attempt to censor it.

52:50.441 --> 53:07.193
What I want to say is that Dr. Corey is not only an advocate for a therapy that is incredibly useful in the context of COVID-19, but he is also someone who has pioneered therapies already that are now the standard of care for COVID-19 patients.

53:07.813 --> 53:11.396
That means he has earned the right to talk about whatever he thinks is important.

53:11.596 --> 53:12.016
Thanks, Pamela.

53:12.036 --> 53:18.881
For my part, as you know, I was also very early on the lab leak hypothesis, and I was very careful about how I presented it.

53:18.941 --> 53:20.042
And of course, in the last month,

53:20.562 --> 53:22.843
That hypothesis has been vindicated.

53:23.284 --> 53:34.510
Everyone, including Dr. Ralph Baric, who is the leading expert in the world on bat-borne coronaviruses and their modification in the lab, has acknowledged that a leak from the lab in Wuhan, China is plausible.

53:34.850 --> 53:39.153
I have also earned the right to talk about what I want to talk about and what I think is necessary.

53:39.573 --> 53:45.076
So he's earned the right to talk about it because he was ahead on the lab leak, which has now been vindicated.

53:45.096 --> 53:47.398
That's a pretty remarkable statement to make.

53:48.218 --> 53:50.199
on June 1st, 2021.

53:51.961 --> 53:52.461
Don't you think?

53:53.442 --> 54:11.394
In retrospect, like he's the head of the Scooby-Doo Mystery Solving Team and he's declared that after being the sleuth of sleuths and wearing a bandana and goggles when it was needed, he's now figured out that this was a lab leak and therefore he was actually smart to have isolated.

54:12.318 --> 54:18.723
He was actually smart to have worn the goggles and the bandana because he avoided the lab leak.

54:18.783 --> 54:20.965
You see where this is going, where it went?

54:22.006 --> 54:23.367
We are now gonna have a conversation.

54:24.187 --> 54:27.050
And if you don't like it, that YouTube is your problem.

54:27.550 --> 54:30.673
We are entitled to discuss this because a lot depends on it.

54:30.953 --> 54:33.275
And we'll- Screw you, YouTube.

54:33.295 --> 54:38.038
It sounds a lot like some teenage girl that did in 2019.

54:38.079 --> 54:39.139
Screw you, YouTube.

54:40.060 --> 54:41.961
We do when issues are don't like it.

54:42.681 --> 54:47.004
I have also earned the right to talk about what I want to talk about and what I think is necessary.

54:47.264 --> 54:48.625
We are now going to have a conversation.

54:49.425 --> 54:52.287
And if you don't like it, that YouTube is your problem.

54:52.807 --> 54:55.889
We are entitled to discuss this because a lot depends on it.

54:56.189 --> 55:02.152
And what we do when issues are complex is we hash them out and figure out what's true through dialectic.

55:02.172 --> 55:02.952
So that's what we're going to do.

55:03.473 --> 55:03.613
Yeah.

55:04.293 --> 55:09.574
I appreciate that you already said a few things but I'd like that hopeful part because there is a lot of weirdness.

55:09.614 --> 55:13.035
The censorship is unpleasant but ultimately this is a message.

55:13.075 --> 55:18.036
There's a really hopeful message about science here and so that's why I'm really glad to be here.

55:18.136 --> 55:28.019
I'm glad to see just more scientists of credibility willing to really look at the evidence behind a phenomenally effective therapy and so like I said, I'm really happy to be here.

55:28.559 --> 55:28.799
Great.

55:29.019 --> 55:40.202
Well, let me say, I think the evidence is incredibly compelling, and that the fact that it is compelling, and yet not widely known, is an important fact in and of itself.

55:40.502 --> 55:42.243
There are layers to an onion to this story.

55:42.383 --> 55:52.986
And whatever it is that causes an obviously useful therapy to be suspected in ways that it shouldn't be, based on the evidence, whatever that thing is, is also a disease of sorts.

55:53.506 --> 55:58.347
Somehow, we have to get to a place where evidence-based medicine really means evidence-based medicine.

55:58.957 --> 56:19.758
okay so they are already establishing what questions they're going to ask and where the limited spectrum of debate is and it's a hopeful message about science using the word science in exactly the same way that debunk the funk used it with zoobie a couple days ago using the word science exactly the same way as tony fauci used it

56:21.843 --> 56:24.644
And Brett Weinstein doesn't seem to need to correct him at all.

56:24.704 --> 56:28.785
He agrees that there's some capital S science with a trademark after it.

56:31.526 --> 56:38.228
This is in June of 2021 when people needed clarity and people with principles.

56:38.288 --> 56:45.671
And here's two people that are agreeing that we are the two guys with principles and they are lying about that.

56:47.731 --> 56:51.916
And if two people agree to lie to us, we're in big trouble.

56:53.478 --> 57:01.347
Just like I told you the story about my two little boys thinking about fooling their little sister with the Minecraft game in a computer in the other room.

57:02.888 --> 57:08.275
If two people agree to lie to you, it's very difficult to see through it.

57:09.545 --> 57:32.416
And I am making the accusation that because this was a national security operation that was intending to use America as an example for the rest of the world of what happens when you screw up a response to a virus, these people were recruited wittingly or unwittingly, are participating wittingly or unwittingly in this charade

57:33.746 --> 57:40.170
that something especially dangerous is happening in America because they are especially bungling their response to it.

57:42.911 --> 57:51.376
That's what's happening right here because Australia locked down and New Zealand locked down and, and Japan wears masks all the time.

57:55.046 --> 58:10.411
You must remember very hard, try to remember where we were at this time in 2021 to understand how significant it is that these two jackasses are so dead on balls narrative that it's impossible to explain by chance.

58:12.580 --> 58:12.920
I agree.

58:13.361 --> 58:13.841
No, you're right.

58:13.981 --> 58:15.062
I like that you just said disease.

58:15.082 --> 58:18.684
I mean, it is, it's, it's a symptom of dysfunction in our system.

58:18.844 --> 58:25.029
I mean, our system is creating this problem around a really effective medicine and it's, it's really damaging.

58:25.229 --> 58:25.549
All right.

58:25.609 --> 58:26.770
So I'd like to step back.

58:26.850 --> 58:36.537
So wait, which is the disease COVID-19 or is the disease, the, the censorship or the inability to, what are they talking about?

58:38.138 --> 58:39.579
I got to go back and play that again.

58:39.599 --> 58:41.641
This is going to be a long video.

58:41.661 --> 58:42.121
It looks like.

58:43.308 --> 58:52.551
The evidence is incredibly compelling and that the fact that it is compelling and yet not widely known is an important fact in and of itself.

58:52.851 --> 59:08.657
There are layers to an onion to this story and whatever- Now keep in mind, right, if this is June 2021, then that means Pierre Kory has already served as a witness for something to do with George Floyd, right, or not?

59:09.477 --> 59:12.738
We need to put this in the right order.

59:14.195 --> 59:23.699
And I don't know what the right order would be, but other people could see this as a challenging sort of thing to Pierre Corey's legitimacy.

59:23.919 --> 59:33.363
If he is revealed to have participated in the George Floyd bonanza, for example, charade, whatever that was, I don't even care.

59:34.644 --> 59:36.184
You know, that they used it against us.

59:36.224 --> 59:42.647
You know, that it was some kind of orchestrated thing that made them burn down things all over the place so that they could test their algorithms.

59:44.381 --> 01:00:05.339
many different ways they can drive people bananas with what bad ideas can they drive people bananas the easiest if they don't discuss this and it's already occurred if he just kind of omits it from his history oh yeah by the way not only did i rush into the burning house that was new york city in april of 2020 because i'm such a hero

01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:17.916
but I also rushed into the courtroom to make sure that the death of George Floyd was based or was blamed on the cops like it should be instead of on whatever else that criminal might've been on.

01:00:21.337 --> 01:00:23.978
I'm not trying to take a stance on George Floyd.

01:00:23.998 --> 01:00:32.001
I'm trying to make you realize that it is unbelievably remarkable that this gentleman participated in that.

01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:43.353
The same gentleman that was put in front of the Senate of either Texas or the United States after what happened in New York to testify about it.

01:00:45.874 --> 01:00:57.079
Did they murder people in New York City with an on-ramp to ventilators created by ARDS that was derived solely from the misapplication of

01:00:58.169 --> 01:01:04.491
of oxygen as so eloquently described by none other than the star of the show, Kyle Seidel.

01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:16.435
Has this actually led to a break in what was supposed to be a, you know, solidify Pierre Kory as the authority on certain things now?

01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:44.157
Because if we're all just gonna conveniently omit that this guy provided the testimony and the expert testimony in the George Floyd case, and that's not relevant to him also having an ivermectin book, also being in front of the Senate, also touring the world for international COVID conferences, also being in hot tub photos, also being in shoe photos,

01:01:46.004 --> 01:01:54.150
Having met me multiple times associated with CHD, ladies and gentlemen, the brick wall is visible.

01:01:55.852 --> 01:02:02.257
We have already illustrated time and time again how Brett Weinstein's not playing fair because of how he behaved with Bobby Kennedy.

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:09.783
I've already illustrated many times why it doesn't feel like Bobby Kennedy's playing fair with me given what I am represented as in his book.

01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:15.664
Yet somehow or another, he's happy to promote Bret Weinstein.

01:02:15.704 --> 01:02:17.905
CHD is happy to promote Bret Weinstein.

01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:19.566
CHD is happy to sell that book.

01:02:19.626 --> 01:02:27.272
It's just a very inconvenient fact that Jonathan Cooley's in that book, and it's a very inconvenient shit what Jonathan Cooley put in that book.

01:02:30.073 --> 01:02:32.175
They really thought they were gonna get away with it.

01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:40.543
that they would be able to absorb the story of my family getting screwed because I opened my mouth.

01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:55.973
My family losing their income and their means of making a living because I opened my mouth and I had a legitimate career, a legitimate track record of just trying to do science and not taking a big salary for it because I was dumb.

01:02:57.654 --> 01:03:02.798
Because Dan Wilson said, I'm raising a second kid and if you know anything about academia, I'm not going there.

01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:05.447
I was dumb.

01:03:06.228 --> 01:03:07.108
I was naive.

01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:12.892
I thought science was really a pursuit worth pursuing and that's why nobody liked how I did it.

01:03:13.852 --> 01:03:17.174
Nobody wanted the questions answered that I wanted answered.

01:03:17.214 --> 01:03:18.595
That's why I couldn't get grants.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.256
That's why I never really succeeded.

01:03:21.414 --> 01:03:35.566
Why I have a 20-year track record of getting paid about $45,000 a year for doing something that very, very, very few people in the world would even attempt to do, never mind pretend or say that they had the expertise to do it well.

01:03:37.508 --> 01:03:38.829
Why did I choose those words?

01:03:38.889 --> 01:03:40.050
Because that's the reality.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:53.901
The kinds of experiments that I was trying to do when I was in my real wheelhouse of electrophysiology were experiments that a handful of people on earth can do now, nevermind back then.

01:03:55.681 --> 01:04:09.164
And some of the most famous neuroscientists at the time knew my name, knew me by first name basis, would recognize me from across the hall of neuroscience where 30,000 people were and put their hand in the air and waved to me.

01:04:12.642 --> 01:04:19.305
I'm not some guy who pretends to have had a lab about Tourette's syndrome in monkeys in South Korea before the pandemic.

01:04:19.785 --> 01:04:32.952
I'm actually a guy who worked for a Navy captain at the University of Pittsburgh, whose wife worked for McKenzie at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine when I was told not to come in anymore.

01:04:34.353 --> 01:04:37.474
Those aren't details that I'm just adding because they're spicy.

01:04:37.914 --> 01:04:40.976
Those are details because unfortunately they just remain part of this,

01:04:42.122 --> 01:04:44.423
giant pile of truth that I can't forget.

01:04:48.906 --> 01:04:50.527
While what's the story with Brett?

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:51.867
What's the story with Corey?

01:04:51.907 --> 01:04:53.108
It seems really weird.

01:04:54.689 --> 01:04:56.250
Because they forget plenty of stuff.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.651
They omit plenty of things.

01:05:02.912 --> 01:05:05.894
Their backstories are always so well-sculpted, you know?

01:05:06.394 --> 01:05:24.207
Like Dan Wilson, who used to think that 9-11 was a big conspiracy, and then more recently, like right before the pandemic, pulled his head out and realized that they told us the truth all along on TV, and started to crusade for the truth on television.

01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:29.311
And now Zuby elevates him as somebody worth talking to.

01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:33.555
And we're supposed to believe that Zuby's a good guy.

01:05:35.659 --> 01:05:37.363
Just like Brett Weinstein's a good guy.

01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:39.106
Just like Pierre Cory's a good guy.

01:05:39.146 --> 01:05:42.934
And they're all lying, and they're all on the same team.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:56.325
it is that causes an obviously useful therapy to be suspected in ways that it shouldn't be based on the evidence, whatever that thing is, is also a disease of sorts.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:06:01.689
Yeah, somehow we have to get to a place where evidence based medicine really means evidence based medicine.

01:06:03.098 --> 01:06:05.479
This is the opposite of trying to be precise.

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:12.220
So instead of, okay, we're going to keep our language crisp and we're going to explain to people what's going on right now.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.760
No, I'm going to add another disease.

01:06:14.481 --> 01:06:16.521
I'm going to add another disease to this discussion.

01:06:16.561 --> 01:06:20.042
And that's the disease of holy shit.

01:06:20.402 --> 01:06:21.082
Stop lying.

01:06:21.482 --> 01:06:26.483
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be able to keep my cool with this because I really think that it's time for the pressure.

01:06:26.543 --> 01:06:27.503
It's time to stomp.

01:06:29.224 --> 01:06:30.664
It's time to break through the floor.

01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:34.293
We're all gonna fall through the ceiling here.

01:06:38.832 --> 01:06:39.252
No, you're right.

01:06:39.272 --> 01:06:40.533
I like that you just said disease.

01:06:40.553 --> 01:06:44.136
I mean, it's a symptom of dysfunction in our system.

01:06:44.296 --> 01:06:48.479
I mean, our system's creating this problem around a really effective medicine.

01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:50.461
And it's really damaging.

01:06:50.661 --> 01:06:50.981
All right.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.662
So I'd like to step back a little bit.

01:06:52.922 --> 01:06:58.147
Obviously, the best thing to do from the point of view of an interesting discussion is go right to the heart of the matter.

01:06:58.187 --> 01:07:01.389
But I really think it's important that a couple of things are on the table first.

01:07:01.889 --> 01:07:02.590
Stop lying!

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.412
Number one on that list is your organization, BFL-PCC.

01:07:05.432 --> 01:07:05.993
Stop lying!

01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:09.674
is not an ivermectin organization on the table.

01:07:10.054 --> 01:07:15.235
Obviously, the best thing to do from the point of view of an interesting discussion is go right to the heart of the matter.

01:07:15.255 --> 01:07:18.316
But I really think it's important that a couple of things are on the table first.

01:07:19.497 --> 01:07:26.119
Number one on that list is your organization, the FLCCC, is not an ivermectin organization.

01:07:26.139 --> 01:07:34.301
It was founded, as I understand it, to discover what the most useful therapies for COVID-19 were in the early days of the pandemic.

01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:39.284
So in the early days of the pandemic when he's implying we didn't know anything.

01:07:40.285 --> 01:07:45.128
We had no idea what to do for respiratory disease at the start of the pandemic because this was a new one.

01:07:49.951 --> 01:07:59.977
Make sure you hear it very clearly what they're doing in June of 2021 to make sure that they sort of shore up the narrative and the shore up the understanding of what just happened in 2020.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.202
Make sure everybody's very clear that we're all on the same page.

01:08:04.603 --> 01:08:09.907
He's teeing up this guy who's now got to tell the story that he's prepared.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:21.236
So I want you to think very carefully about how you would act if you're finally being queued up, finally going to go, OK, now here's where I'm actually going to start to perform.

01:08:22.017 --> 01:08:24.379
And I'm a little bit shit and bricks.

01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:29.383
It's basically like what my daughter's going to go through tonight at her first piano recital.

01:08:30.233 --> 01:08:31.214
You've been practicing.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:36.740
It's fine when you did it off, you know, on your piano or on the piano at the church when you're doing the rehearsal.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:48.292
But now when everybody shows up and you got your pretty dress on and everybody's there and the food's waiting outside and it's time to go up, how do you react?

01:08:49.653 --> 01:08:52.036
How does the nervousness manifest itself?

01:08:53.069 --> 01:08:54.530
Do you want to say something about where you started?

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.851
Yeah.

01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:58.614
So the first thing I have to say is that we start with Professor Paul Marek.

01:08:58.674 --> 01:09:06.361
So Paul Marek, he's actually the most published intensivist in the history of our field who's actually practicing medicine.

01:09:06.701 --> 01:09:09.264
The other doctor who published more doesn't see patients.

01:09:09.744 --> 01:09:12.847
So Paul is sort of a giant in our field, well-known internationally.

01:09:12.907 --> 01:09:17.991
What happened was when COVID was rolling to our shores, and it really kind of hit New York and Seattle,

01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:23.054
Some prominent doctors went to Paul and said, hey, you got to come up with a protocol.

01:09:23.074 --> 01:09:25.355
Because Paul's well known for his protocols for sepsis and whatnot.

01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:28.856
Get a group of your colleagues, put together a protocol to treat this.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:29.577
And that's what he did.

01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:31.778
And I'm honored to be a member of that team.

01:09:31.818 --> 01:09:35.339
And so Paul and I started talking with the group, and we put together a protocol.

01:09:35.579 --> 01:09:44.623
And our first protocol actually included blood thinners, pretty aggressive, and corticosteroids at a time when every national and international society

01:09:45.263 --> 01:09:46.784
basically said there's insufficient evidence.

01:09:46.824 --> 01:09:49.146
Now we're already being disingenuous here, right?

01:09:49.186 --> 01:10:02.854
Because if the protocol says you need to seek help when you have a 94% pulse ox and the place that a person seeks help believes in the TV narrative, then you're not going to get what the FLCCC recommends.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:18.446
you're not gonna be able to take the FLCCC protocol and say, hey doc, hey look, I got this protocol off the internet and the protocol off the internet says that I have a pulse ox of 94, I'm supposed to come to you and then you're supposed to give me this stuff.

01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:23.688
It seems like that's what they're proposing here.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:33.212
That the FLCCC protocol is something that you can just print out and take to the emergency room and then other doctors will read it and follow it.

01:10:34.107 --> 01:10:35.508
What else are they implying here?

01:10:39.629 --> 01:10:44.932
And how naive would it be for you to take a protocol to your doctor and say, hey doc, I got this off the internet.

01:10:45.472 --> 01:10:50.534
And it's not what the CDC says, but I would really like you to follow it.

01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:56.533
Just keep in mind what what else are they proposing if they're not proposing that?

01:10:56.954 --> 01:11:00.797
Hey, you got to come up with a protocol because Paul's well known for his protocols for sepsis and whatnot.

01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:11.068
Get a group of your colleagues put together a protocol to treat this and that's what he did and I'm honored to be a member of that team and so Paul and I started talking with the group and we put together a protocol and

01:11:11.588 --> 01:11:22.945
Our first protocol actually included blood thinners, pretty aggressive, and corticosteroids at a time when every national and international society basically said there's insufficient evidence and do not use.

01:11:22.985 --> 01:11:24.847
In fact, they thought corticosteroids were harmful.

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:34.113
I was actually invited to give a Senate testimony back in May, where I testified in the Senate that it was critical to use corticosteroids, that lives were being lost.

01:11:34.673 --> 01:11:36.954
And as you might know, I got killed for that.

01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:38.114
We got killed for that.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:41.376
I wonder if he's talking about May of 21 or May of 2020.

01:11:42.196 --> 01:11:44.897
That's interesting.

01:11:45.277 --> 01:11:47.078
He says he put together a protocol.

01:11:47.198 --> 01:11:48.799
I'm asking who would follow it.

01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:54.441
What does it mean if a bunch of rebel doctors puts together a protocol online?

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:57.650
if no one will ever follow it.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:10.996
And the primary recommendation for people that are going to decide what to do was that you have a 94% pulse ox, you should go to the hospital, which is actually telling people to go online and order a pulse ox.

01:12:12.757 --> 01:12:14.558
How else are you going to know what your pulse ox is?

01:12:15.018 --> 01:12:22.743
So, if I have two pulse oximeters and I put them on my fingers and I find out that they don't read the same thing from the same person, what would happen then?

01:12:22.783 --> 01:12:26.486
What situation would we be in if that was the case?

01:12:26.506 --> 01:12:29.388
I'm just trying to figure out what would happen.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.230
What would you interpret that as if

01:12:33.078 --> 01:12:36.779
We had two pulse oximeters that couldn't read the same number.

01:12:36.799 --> 01:12:46.921
I mean, how close am I to having COVID right now if these things say what they say like this?

01:12:46.941 --> 01:12:46.921
98, 97.

01:12:48.761 --> 01:12:50.982
Sorry, the other one quit starting over again or something.

01:12:51.022 --> 01:12:51.342
I don't know.

01:12:51.382 --> 01:12:52.282
Maybe the battery's dead.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:53.822
I might have to charge it up.

01:12:55.143 --> 01:12:56.163
I hope they are chargeable.

01:12:56.183 --> 01:12:57.983
96, there it is.

01:12:58.083 --> 01:12:59.284
I have a 96% pulse ox on one side.

01:13:03.305 --> 01:13:05.967
Does that mean I have to go to the hospital now or was it 94?

01:13:07.888 --> 01:13:09.490
That's also quite significant, right?

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.810
If it was 94.

01:13:15.014 --> 01:13:27.123
And so my point is, is that one simple way without a toxin would be to just sell a bunch of shitty ones of these and then put good ones back on the market a few months later.

01:13:29.042 --> 01:13:31.124
I mean, that would require no toxins.

01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:34.347
You could use Amazon to do it and you could use social media to do it.

01:13:34.387 --> 01:13:38.230
People implying that pulse ox is a great way to figure it out.

01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:46.637
That's what Pierre Cory said on YouTube that one consistent thing with all these patients was their pulse ox was low in the 80s.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.281
And he's a lung expert, right?

01:13:51.501 --> 01:13:58.528
So here we are listening to him on Brett Weinstein in June of 2021.

01:13:59.008 --> 01:14:04.373
And he's not talking about the fact that he was a witness for the George Floyd thing at all.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:08.636
It's weird.

01:14:11.616 --> 01:14:15.580
totally criticized for not having an evidence base to say that on.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.681
And we actually did.

01:14:16.981 --> 01:14:18.602
Our reading of the evidence was that you had to use it.

01:14:18.642 --> 01:14:20.744
And so that's how we came together.

01:14:20.764 --> 01:14:22.226
And that was the first components of our protocol.

01:14:22.246 --> 01:14:24.868
But like you said, ivermectin was not in our protocol initially.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.650
So I find this just stunning.

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:36.739
You discovered as clinicians that corticosteroids and blood thinners were important in the treatment of covid patients.

01:14:36.779 --> 01:14:41.323
And in trying to make this point, you were criticized and then vindicated.

01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:43.125
This is now standard of care.

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:50.632
And now this is part of what I would argue from the non MD perspective is part of that narrative.

01:14:51.434 --> 01:15:00.778
This is very similar to the narrative that there are more cardiac arrests and strokes as a result of the gain-of-function incapacitating agents circulating the globe.

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:10.502
And so this dovetails very nicely to what they were trying to confound as a novel circulating pathogen.

01:15:11.022 --> 01:15:13.023
Of course, this is seeding more

01:15:13.903 --> 01:15:21.366
little breadcrumbs about why it's a novel pathogen because, you know, this is the first time we've ever needed to use blood thinners to treat people.

01:15:23.707 --> 01:15:25.687
So this is a crazy new virus, right?

01:15:25.747 --> 01:15:27.448
And who was one of those people?

01:15:27.508 --> 01:15:36.351
That is also like Richard Fleming, who was promoted a lot by Kevin McCairn in 2020 and 2021, and who blocked me very early on Twitter.

01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:47.713
So all of these performers were part of a coordinated lollapalooza of lies.

01:15:48.194 --> 01:16:00.488
And because when we look backwards, they line up so uncannily, it would be very, very dangerous for our kids' future not to acknowledge this pattern and to figure out why it's there.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:04.172
I think it's because they're all part of the show.

01:16:04.412 --> 01:16:05.133
Standard of care.

01:16:05.393 --> 01:16:05.973
Standard of care.

01:16:05.993 --> 01:16:13.139
So in thinking about this question, right, there's a barrage of nonsense that comes back when you even say the word ivermectin.

01:16:13.379 --> 01:16:15.141
People have to realize who they're up against.

01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:20.826
They're up against people who have not only been successfully treating patients but have been innovating the standard of care.

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:24.609
The very same people are now talking about ivermectin and its potential, and that is

01:16:25.089 --> 01:16:27.011
Oh yeah, I forgot to remind you of one thing.

01:16:27.051 --> 01:16:31.476
They were talking about steroids a minute ago and talking about how steroids are hurting people.

01:16:31.936 --> 01:16:44.990
But don't forget around this same time, about a month later, Robert Malone, after appearing on Brett Weinstein's podcast, is going to go on a podcast with Paul Cattrall and explain to Paul Cattrall and this guy Neely

01:16:47.552 --> 01:16:57.939
that they are killing people by giving them steroids and then sending them out of the hospital because the steroids are like a brick to the immune system and knock down the immune response.

01:16:57.979 --> 01:17:02.281
And so get rid of all the symptoms, but then send people home with secondary pneumonia and they die.

01:17:06.264 --> 01:17:16.290
So what an interesting dichotomy of opinions that Brett Weinstein doesn't seem sophisticated enough to sort out, even though they appeared in sequence on his podcast in the same month.

01:17:18.413 --> 01:17:20.635
Should have had a notebook or something and took notes, right?

01:17:20.675 --> 01:17:21.555
If he's not equipped.

01:17:24.858 --> 01:17:29.441
But I think he was probably counting on other people to provide the script and he was just going to go along with it.

01:17:29.461 --> 01:17:31.743
He's just got to ask the questions and provide the mic, right?

01:17:33.308 --> 01:17:38.433
I hope you're able to see as much as I can see in which what you say about this drug has to be taken.

01:17:50.965 --> 01:18:01.890
And so as irrelevant as it would be for me to say that I've been a scientist for 20 years and so I know what I'm talking about now, the only thing you have to evaluate is what I'm saying now.

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:07.252
You don't have to go back and see whether or not I was doing great science or crappy science.

01:18:07.312 --> 01:18:11.634
And if you do, I'd be proud of you to go back and look and find out that I did great science.

01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:19.524
Science that influenced a lot of people that were trying to think about the same problems that I was.

01:18:19.584 --> 01:18:25.287
And in fact, my ideas are still influencing their way of thinking about the problems that they're trying to solve.

01:18:27.908 --> 01:18:35.332
And I would be willing to bet that the only other neuroscientists that is in this narrative by insertion cannot make that claim.

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:44.237
And that should tell you everything you need to know about this poser and all of these posers.

01:18:45.489 --> 01:18:48.192
Brett Weinstein can't make a claim to suffrage.

01:18:48.253 --> 01:18:50.696
He can't make a claim to sacrificing anything.

01:18:51.236 --> 01:19:00.668
He was a tenure track professor at a podunk college and then elevated by a fake social media event to the point where he was given a

01:19:01.289 --> 01:19:18.594
half a million dollar settlement to transition to podcasting right before the pandemic started and allowed to elevate himself in front of the Senate to talk about this woke problem in America so that he would be an artificially elevated position to talk about it when the pandemic started.

01:19:19.997 --> 01:19:21.639
His brother was elevated that way.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:34.973
Brett Weinstein's whole crew of Intellectual Dark Web was elevated that way before the pandemic so that trusted sources of information would be present even on the backwoods of the internet.

01:19:38.296 --> 01:19:39.297
That's why they were there.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.701
That's why they're there now.

01:19:44.753 --> 01:19:46.094
There's no other way to see it.

01:19:46.394 --> 01:19:51.919
Nobody gets 200,000 followers because they are awesome.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:05.110
It's because they're irrelevant or they can be used to control people's attention and keep it focused on something that will not get them out of the trap.

01:20:06.155 --> 01:20:15.637
Anybody that's providing information that would usefully get you out of the trap will never attain 200,000 followers, never.

01:20:18.718 --> 01:20:20.938
It will never happen, that's my prediction.

01:20:21.618 --> 01:20:29.960
So you can just basically make your choice by not following anybody with over 200,000 followers and then just see what you find.

01:20:32.521 --> 01:20:34.161
Maybe even put the threshold lower

01:20:38.486 --> 01:20:39.966
and lung disease is Umberto Maduri.

01:20:40.046 --> 01:20:43.187
And he is part of our five that started the FLCCC.

01:20:43.207 --> 01:20:46.948
There's a lot of his guidance around steroids that we put it in our protocols.

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:53.969
And so, I mean, I keep saying you can't call upon more credibility and experience, not only in evidence-based, but in clinical.

01:20:54.069 --> 01:21:06.632
But Eric is more important because Eric is a liaison probably between the, a liaison between the weaponized piles of money that he works for,

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:10.603
and his father's information.

01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:13.644
Bret Weinstein is a useful idiot.

01:21:14.164 --> 01:21:25.907
Bret Weinstein was elevated by his own brother on the Portal podcast before he started his own podcast and elevated in a very yucky sort of way where

01:21:26.869 --> 01:21:55.417
His brother, Eric, basically did a three-hour podcast blowing sunshine up Brett's butthole, saying that he was one of the most smart and insightful biologists in the world, and that he was being way too humble about how super smart he was and about how everybody needed to know who he was as an evolutionary biologist and a thinker, putting him on par with Dawkins and all these other people.

01:21:57.025 --> 01:22:01.508
That's real, that's still available on the internet, and that happened before the pandemic.

01:22:02.649 --> 01:22:05.851
Not by accident, but by design.

01:22:07.312 --> 01:22:15.037
And their connection to the weaponized piles of money that Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are connected to is not accidental.

01:22:15.537 --> 01:22:22.461
Their pseudo-worship of Elon Musk as the sort of ultimate philosopher

01:22:25.638 --> 01:22:28.860
Superman guy is just not by accident.

01:22:30.341 --> 01:22:34.783
And their almost uniform promotion of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:34.823 --> 01:22:37.605
for the last couple months is also not by accident.

01:22:40.907 --> 01:22:42.748
Because they all agree on a novel virus.

01:22:42.788 --> 01:22:44.369
They all agree that millions were killed.

01:22:44.389 --> 01:22:48.971
They all agree that millions more were saved, could have been saved by particular things.

01:22:49.592 --> 01:22:52.213
And likely this will come again because this was a lab leak.

01:22:52.733 --> 01:22:53.534
They all agree.

01:22:56.676 --> 01:23:11.386
Robert Malone, Bobby Kennedy, Pierre Corey, the Weinstein brothers, Peter McCullough, Jessica Rose, Kevin McKernan, Kevin McCairn, Charles Rixey, Mary Holland.

01:23:14.087 --> 01:23:15.408
How long can the list go?

01:23:15.508 --> 01:23:21.192
Meryl Nass, all of them are certain something strange happened.

01:23:22.253 --> 01:23:23.774
Certain that something novel

01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:25.737
cannot be denied.

01:23:26.157 --> 01:23:28.381
Certain that they may have had it multiple times.

01:23:30.124 --> 01:23:32.308
Certain that ivermectin is part of the story.

01:23:34.612 --> 01:23:37.537
Certain that infectious clones are not worth talking about.

01:23:37.738 --> 01:23:38.118
Certain

01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:47.713
medicine, literally treating critical illnesses for decades.

01:23:47.833 --> 01:23:48.573
And that's what we do.

01:23:49.254 --> 01:23:53.096
So I have my own trajectory into this story much later than yours.

01:23:53.837 --> 01:23:59.460
You know, as I started to understand how strange this story was, and that, of course, spurred me on to dig deeper and deeper.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.443
The thing that I find so strange about it, you know, I've been to a number of these battles.

01:24:05.383 --> 01:24:06.304
This isn't my first rodeo.

01:24:06.344 --> 01:24:08.045
It spurred me on to dig deeper and deeper.

01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:13.028
The thing that I find so strange about it, you know, I've been to a number of these battles.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.010
This isn't my first rodeo, as some would say.

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:17.871
In general,

01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:33.128
The people who one ends up defending in such a circumstance, they are fringe, and they may have something very important to say, but there is something about them that is hard for people to understand at first.

01:24:33.928 --> 01:24:35.729
You guys, you're blue chip.

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:38.570
You guys are absolutely unimpeachable.

01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:40.310
You couldn't ask for better credentials.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.151
You couldn't ask for a better publication record.

01:24:42.651 --> 01:24:47.533
How long are they going to insist that their past record means that they have to be right?

01:24:48.766 --> 01:24:52.570
How many more times are they gonna insist that I've earned the right to speak up?

01:24:54.091 --> 01:24:55.693
I mean, how far are we into this already?

01:24:55.733 --> 01:24:56.694
It's impressive, right?

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:05.003
You guys are, you know, center of your discipline, and yet you are being dismissed as if you were kooks on the fringe making wild-eyed claims.

01:25:05.603 --> 01:25:20.329
So, you know, I have to say, I haven't seen a battle like this, and I'm a bit excited to see what happens when, you know, the heroes of the story are also squeaky clean and, you know, speaking plain English.

01:25:20.549 --> 01:25:22.050
We're not fringe, right?

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.532
Yeah.

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:24.492
Okay, that's remarkable.

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:30.077
Before we get to the ivermectin question, though, I do want to talk to you a little bit about what it looked like.

01:25:31.278 --> 01:25:32.239
What it looked like.

01:25:32.339 --> 01:25:37.223
Okay, so remember what I said a little earlier, I thought I was queuing this up, but I was a little early.

01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:47.049
How does one behave when they are about to say what they have prepared to say?

01:25:48.731 --> 01:25:53.636
How does someone behave when they're about to actually tell a lie and they know they have to get it right?

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:55.878
How does someone behave?

01:25:57.296 --> 01:26:13.056
as you as a lung specialist, an ICU specialist, were encountering COVID patients and coming to understand what they were really sick with, rather, I mean, I, as you are not French, are also squeaky clean and, you know, speaking plain English.

01:26:13.256 --> 01:26:14.457
We're not French, right?

01:26:14.477 --> 01:26:15.018
You are not French.

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:17.160
Yeah, so okay, that's remarkable.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:30.086
Before we get to the ivermectin question, though, I do want to talk to you a little bit about what it looked like as you, as a lung specialist, an ICU specialist, were encountering COVID patients and coming to understand what they were really sick with.

01:26:30.146 --> 01:26:34.268
Rather, I mean, I remember the early days of the pandemic and the sort of groping for reason.

01:26:34.308 --> 01:26:36.109
Why do the symptoms look like this, right?

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.950
Is it a lung disease?

01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.630
Is it a blood disease?

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:38.370
What is it?

01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:40.631
So what did happen with these patients?

01:26:41.092 --> 01:26:43.573
So that's something that Kevin McCairn,

01:26:44.827 --> 01:26:50.616
Charles Rixey, Richard Fleming, Walter Chestnut,

01:26:51.874 --> 01:27:16.782
Jessica Rose, on the internet, they all agreed that the ACE2 component, that the AIDS component, that the mitochondrial component, the clotting component was all based on the spike protein, the gain of function spike protein that had a fear and cleavage site, which enabled it to be the most contagious virus that mankind has ever encountered in modern times.

01:27:18.936 --> 01:27:22.863
These guys aren't questioning any of that at all, and in fact, adding a layer to it.

01:27:24.344 --> 01:27:30.446
As a lung specialist, an ICU specialist, we're encountering COVID patients and coming to understand what they were really sick with.

01:27:30.506 --> 01:27:34.607
Rather, I mean, I remember the early days of the pandemic and the sort of groping for reason.

01:27:34.647 --> 01:27:36.668
Why do the symptoms look like this, right?

01:27:36.728 --> 01:27:50.392
And so they're implying that ARDS is developing, that people are having clotting problems, and that this is all evidence of a novel spreading pathogen that, again, Mary Holland agrees was strange, that

01:27:51.232 --> 01:28:12.049
that Meryl Nass has testified over and over on camera that was strange that she's had it three times even though she didn't test and so this narrative needed to be solidified it needed to be shored up they needed to put sandbags around it and the narrative is that it's a novel disease with a novel presentation

01:28:14.554 --> 01:28:21.444
And that novel presentation is based on the fact that there's ACE2 everywhere, so it can attack all kinds of different organs.

01:28:22.065 --> 01:28:23.688
Can have all kinds of different effects.

01:28:26.471 --> 01:28:50.851
And they spent months and months with people like Spartacus and people like Richard Fleming, talking on Kevin McCarron's podcast and other podcasts about the details of the implications of the ACE2 binding and how, because it's so high affinity for ACE2, then its effects are even worse than a regular ACE2 binding virus.

01:28:52.571 --> 01:29:01.255
All this was bubbling in the background, fired up in a million different ways, at a million different platforms, by a million different podcasts.

01:29:01.315 --> 01:29:20.582
That's the background on which these two guys are talking about this interesting new syndrome that has aspects of a respiratory disease, but also aspects of some kind of clotting disorder, which would conveniently then also be linked to the J&J shot

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:23.213
in about another, what, month?

01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:23.654
Two months?

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:27.976
lung disease, is it a blood disease?

01:29:28.236 --> 01:29:28.717
What is it?

01:29:29.017 --> 01:29:30.957
So what did happen with these patients?

01:29:30.977 --> 01:29:32.118
What did you realize about them?

01:29:32.238 --> 01:29:40.700
Yeah, so, sorry about clearing my throat, but is it rather, I mean, I remember the, as you, here comes the lie.

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.940
So, okay, that's remarkable.

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:47.282
Before we get to the ivermectin question, though, I do want to talk to you a little bit about what it looked like.

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.542
The ivermectin question is the easy one.

01:29:49.582 --> 01:29:51.203
That's the story he's ready to tell.

01:29:51.823 --> 01:29:54.425
Covering up the murder is what happens right now.

01:29:54.525 --> 01:29:56.667
Covering up the fraud is what happens right now.

01:29:56.767 --> 01:30:05.534
Covering up whatever happened in New York City and whatever happened around the United States in 2020 is gonna happen right now by Pierre Kory.

01:30:05.894 --> 01:30:11.619
And so this is the, he's stepping to the free throw line right now and the entire stadium is screaming.

01:30:12.455 --> 01:30:13.336
How does he react?

01:30:13.736 --> 01:30:25.505
Like, as you, as a lung specialist, an ICU specialist, were encountering COVID patients and coming to understand what they were really sick with, rather, I mean, I remember the early days of the pandemic and the sort of groping for reason.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.346
Why do the symptoms look like this, right?

01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:28.187
Is it a lung disease?

01:30:28.227 --> 01:30:28.867
Is it a blood disease?

01:30:29.147 --> 01:30:29.608
What is it?

01:30:29.908 --> 01:30:31.869
So what did happen with these patients?

01:30:31.889 --> 01:30:33.030
What did you realize about them?

01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:37.113
Yeah, so, sorry about clearing my throat, but

01:30:38.374 --> 01:31:04.808
you know it was clearly you know what was clearly recognized early on is that it was a disease of phases right so it started out as a general viral syndrome most people recovered self-limited and it's like a cold right sometimes a little keep in mind he's having him testify about what supposedly all the doctors in the united states know he's this is june of 2021 he's gonna testify and describe what every doctor in america that's worked at a hospital should already know

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:13.771
And any doctor that listens to this right now should be going down a little list of stuff and say, yep, check, I saw that, check, I saw that, check, I saw that.

01:31:15.192 --> 01:31:15.832
But they didn't.

01:31:18.533 --> 01:31:23.676
The doctors that didn't see this didn't ask the question of, wait, what he's describing, I never saw that.

01:31:26.838 --> 01:31:36.314
No doctors now in 2024 are gonna say what he describes could come from the misapplication of high flow nasal oxygen for a few hours.

01:31:36.354 --> 01:31:37.556
Are any of you aware of that?

01:31:38.117 --> 01:31:40.141
We're not gonna have one of these MDs say this.

01:31:44.326 --> 01:31:46.908
It's not going to happen because the lie was started right here.

01:31:46.948 --> 01:31:48.809
Listen carefully because it's about to happen.

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:51.472
What was clearly recognized early on is that it was a disease of phases, right?

01:31:51.492 --> 01:31:53.473
So it started out as a general viral syndrome.

01:31:53.793 --> 01:31:56.556
Most people recovered, self-limited, and it was like a cold, right?

01:31:56.596 --> 01:31:58.297
Sometimes a little bit more severe than a cold.

01:31:58.337 --> 01:32:06.143
But everyone quickly realized that around day 5, 7, 8, there was a proportion of patients who suddenly started dropping their oxygen levels.

01:32:06.183 --> 01:32:07.724
And basically, their lungs were inflamed.

01:32:07.784 --> 01:32:09.846
And we now know that it's a cell called the macrophage.

01:32:10.226 --> 01:32:12.406
which gets activated and literally attacks the lungs.

01:32:12.466 --> 01:32:17.267
And so you have this sort of immune response that is attacking the lungs and the lungs start to fail.

01:32:17.587 --> 01:32:18.748
So a macrophage.

01:32:18.988 --> 01:32:27.729
So a macrophage is attacking the lungs as opposed to high flow oxygen being given over the mouth with a mask leading to ARDS.

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:35.390
And we have papers that show in monkey studies from 1989 that if you give 80% pure oxygen

01:32:39.062 --> 01:32:42.906
to a monkey, they will develop ARDS almost as fast as if you give them 100%.

01:32:42.947 --> 01:32:49.114
And we have Kyle Seidel telling us that they were giving 100% at 60 liters per minute.

01:32:49.474 --> 01:32:59.445
We have lawsuits that are coming through in Oklahoma right now, which feature a primary thing on the protocol, which was this high flow

01:33:00.226 --> 01:33:06.388
nasal oxygen being given for hours, leading to a progression that got people on ventilators.

01:33:06.448 --> 01:33:15.791
So this lung expert, this critical care expert, seems to be unaware that inappropriate use of high flow oxygen could lead

01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:30.240
to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and that it's a danger in the ICU to use high flow oxygen because they're not able to report the damage that's happening in their lungs if they're unconscious.

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:35.143
And there is no clarity here at all that that's even possible.

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:44.450
And curiously enough, since we've arrived at this through the help of Grace's dad and others,

01:33:45.819 --> 01:33:57.903
the emphasis of the potential for this one detail to open everybody's eyes has been absolutely discarded from the table by almost everyone.

01:33:57.963 --> 01:34:10.367
The only people that are consistently mentioning on a regular basis that don't forget, no doctors are talking about high flow supplementary oxygen as a wrong idea.

01:34:11.488 --> 01:34:16.069
No doctors, none, zero, zip, just me, just Mark.

01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:19.830
The ones that we have talked to have said, obviously it's stupid.

01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:24.990
And the papers that we have found say that it is empirically damaging.

01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:39.353
There are entire companies that are based around a feedback loop between a pulse oximeter and an oxygen humidifying

01:34:42.313 --> 01:34:53.120
supplementary air system so that the amount of oxygen in the supplementary air being humidified by the device is regulated by the pulse ox that is being read.

01:34:55.362 --> 01:34:58.864
If we were running out of ventilators, I bet we didn't have enough of those machines.

01:35:00.549 --> 01:35:28.315
If the videos that we've seen from Kyle Seidel are true, if the comfort ship that pulled into New York really did have an oxygen plant on it and they were shipping supplementary oxygen to all of these places and putting people on supplementary oxygen until they complained about pain and the progression of a disease that they thought was a novel virus, but was actually the oxygen mask that they were given two hours ago.

01:35:31.095 --> 01:35:34.863
And this lung specialist seems to be completely unaware that that was possible.

01:35:41.394 --> 01:35:45.095
is like an amoeba-like cell that goes around basically garbage collecting.

01:35:45.155 --> 01:35:46.196
It does a little more than that.

01:35:46.216 --> 01:35:47.136
It's a scavenger cell.

01:35:47.196 --> 01:35:48.537
It was attacking the lung tissue.

01:35:48.597 --> 01:35:49.917
It's the front line of defense, right?

01:35:49.957 --> 01:35:54.319
And it goes into the lungs and it causes a lot of inflammation.

01:35:54.359 --> 01:35:56.060
And so that inflammation injures the lung.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.181
And so you could see the lungs starting not to work.

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:00.781
And so it's pretty dumb.

01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:04.603
So it's interesting because he's not even really blaming it on the virus.

01:36:04.643 --> 01:36:08.644
The virus isn't causing the macrophage to show up and cause inflammation.

01:36:08.684 --> 01:36:10.025
The macrophage is just shit.

01:36:13.382 --> 01:36:21.548
It's really an interesting presentation of the mythology and it's not a very cohesive one.

01:36:23.749 --> 01:36:36.779
In my mind, it reveals 100% the fact that these guys are working down a script that they're not even familiar enough to understand that it has holes and that they might need to stay away from some holes in it.

01:36:37.179 --> 01:36:38.600
I mean, it's amazing to me.

01:36:39.911 --> 01:36:57.276
Clearly, the landslide is about to happen because this poser was not only involved in curating the New York narrative all the way to the US Senate, but was involved in curating the George Floyd narrative all the way to his civil trial.

01:36:57.816 --> 01:37:07.979
This guy is responsible for curating a narrative about who his father is, who his brother is related to, and how that might have resulted in weaponized piles of money being able to make a lot of profit

01:37:09.068 --> 01:37:14.372
off of intellectual property or the trends in the value of intellectual property.

01:37:15.152 --> 01:37:24.639
You know, like the antibody patent paradox threatens to change the intellectual property value of lots and lots of pharmaceutical companies around the world.

01:37:24.779 --> 01:37:27.861
And that happened right at the beginning of the pandemic somehow.

01:37:30.987 --> 01:37:32.388
commonly a severe lung disease.

01:37:32.668 --> 01:37:38.810
And what I will never forget in my life is those early months because, and I'm gonna go back to that steroid thing.

01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:43.392
We saw patients, just this disease marching straight to the ventilator.

01:37:43.852 --> 01:37:45.793
And so many people were landing on ventilators.

01:37:46.173 --> 01:37:48.494
And you remember, people were running out of ventilators.

01:37:48.514 --> 01:37:52.035
And there was two- But they would only run out of ventilators if they needed them, right?

01:37:52.075 --> 01:37:52.896
And how would they need them?

01:37:53.016 --> 01:37:54.256
Oh, I'm in so much pain.

01:37:54.336 --> 01:37:55.677
Can you take this mask off?

01:37:55.757 --> 01:37:58.838
No, I mean, maybe this is just the COVID progression.

01:38:00.475 --> 01:38:12.103
We could sedate you and then you won't feel the burning pain of the progression of acute distress, respiratory distress disorder, or whatever its syndrome, ARDS.

01:38:14.273 --> 01:38:22.440
No mention at all that there is a possibility that supplementary oxygen, if given high flow or too long, could damage lungs.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:31.127
And so we've got to be really careful, as these people come into the hospital and overwhelm our ERs, that we don't misuse oxygen.

01:38:32.248 --> 01:38:34.110
We have to be very careful about this.

01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:36.352
There's nothing, nothing at all.

01:38:37.332 --> 01:38:46.820
that approaches a nuanced understanding about how to approach an unknown respiratory disease where the primary indicator is a low pulse ox.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:39:02.112
If you were aware that misapplication of high flow nasal oxygen in a supplementary way might lead to ARDS, you would certainly warn about it if the primary symptom to the disease that you thought was going around ended up being low pulse ox.

01:39:04.386 --> 01:39:09.028
And you would be a little bit more nuanced when you said, everybody's just ending up on the ventilators.

01:39:09.048 --> 01:39:32.741
Well, how could that happen by accident or by, how could that happen unbeknownst to the young doctors that are manning these posts when the old doctors were told to go home and to give an early retirement, where the attendings became the residents and the residents were told by the administrators to follow the protocol.

01:39:37.449 --> 01:39:46.714
What hospital actually allows a doctor from another state to just show up at their doorstep and start practicing in their hospital?

01:39:49.276 --> 01:39:58.901
In his testimony to the George Floyd trial, whenever that happened, that letter clearly states that he's licensed in Wisconsin and Illinois.

01:39:59.982 --> 01:40:05.945
So if he's licensed in Wisconsin and Illinois, how the hell can he go to New York City and start treating people

01:40:07.202 --> 01:40:08.343
and be on the front line.

01:40:08.403 --> 01:40:09.163
How does that work?

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:13.005
Did they have to waive his certifications?

01:40:14.325 --> 01:40:16.466
Or did New York City do something else?

01:40:20.488 --> 01:40:36.216
And why doesn't he mention that he was in New York City and lost his job in Wisconsin in the testimony that describes his background for his expert letter for the George Floyd trial that says that he suffocated from the cops?

01:40:39.164 --> 01:40:39.824
reasons for that.

01:40:40.204 --> 01:40:48.006
One is because the entire healthcare community globally said this is a viral disease, so supportive care only.

01:40:48.146 --> 01:40:49.746
You're talking about Tylenol and fluids.

01:40:50.386 --> 01:40:51.826
Tylenol and fluids.

01:40:52.066 --> 01:40:55.887
And because we don't have enough ventilators, maybe we can give you supplementary oxygen.

01:40:56.107 --> 01:40:58.528
Careful, careful.

01:41:00.568 --> 01:41:06.429
That's nowhere gonna come even close to the front because that's exactly what this was for.

01:41:07.975 --> 01:41:21.999
They are constructing the limited spectrum of debate that these two guys and their friends are gonna agree to argue about for the next three years and effectively run the clock out on our kids all the way till right now today.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.744
They're not going to ask any more questions than the ones they detail right here.

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:33.726
And they're going to focus on those ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.

01:41:33.766 --> 01:41:34.487
How did they get there?

01:41:34.587 --> 01:41:35.027
I don't know.

01:41:35.328 --> 01:41:40.452
And as they did supportive care only because there was no randomized controlled trials letting them do like everyone talks about evidence-based.

01:41:40.493 --> 01:41:43.435
I'm always like, what about experience-based medicine?

01:41:43.475 --> 01:41:45.117
Like I've been doing this for 30 years.

01:41:45.177 --> 01:41:47.959
Why can't I do what my experience tells me to do?

01:41:47.979 --> 01:41:50.222
I don't have randomized controlled trials, but to do nothing.

01:41:50.965 --> 01:41:52.886
was leading to ventilator shortages.

01:41:53.086 --> 01:41:56.927
Okay, I want to clear one thing up for my audience who won't be familiar with the term.

01:41:57.027 --> 01:42:10.553
Tylenol is likely contributing to the problem with vaccines because vaccines are given and often, often, often parents are told to give them Tylenol for the pain or the symptoms that occur afterward.

01:42:12.874 --> 01:42:18.336
It's malevolent as malevolent can be written with boldface letters and all capitals.

01:42:19.697 --> 01:42:20.457
It's malevolent.

01:42:22.421 --> 01:42:37.393
This is a coordinated group of liars that's covering up the criminal vaccine schedule in the United States and using lies about murder to make us or trick us into teaching a mythology about gain-of-function viruses to our kids.

01:42:39.334 --> 01:42:41.776
They work for the slavers, ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:42.777 --> 01:42:44.078
There's no other way to see it.

01:42:45.048 --> 01:42:47.329
and then make a point about what you've just said.

01:42:47.369 --> 01:42:54.911
The first thing is, what did you call this policy of Tylenol and... Supportive care only.

01:42:55.071 --> 01:43:01.332
So the idea here is that, historically speaking, we have had very little to do about viruses.

01:43:01.392 --> 01:43:07.254
We've been tremendously effective with antibiotics against bacteria, against fungi,

01:43:07.794 --> 01:43:09.936
They don't, in general, work against viruses.

01:43:10.256 --> 01:43:13.558
And antiviral therapies have been a dicey business for a long time.

01:43:13.858 --> 01:43:15.559
What does work has been vaccines.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:26.186
But if you get to a pandemic and you don't have a vaccine, what you were effectively being told is, look, there's not a whole lot of positive intervention you can... I mean, are you getting sick yet?

01:43:34.371 --> 01:43:35.332
Are you getting sick yet?

01:43:36.565 --> 01:43:38.566
Antibiotics don't work for viruses.

01:43:38.726 --> 01:43:47.208
Isn't that what Dr. Griffin says on the, on This Week in Virology every week?

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:51.389
That antibiotics don't work for viral pneumonia.

01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:56.751
They use the term viral syndrome, or it's a typical viral syndrome.

01:43:56.771 --> 01:44:00.392
You know, most people, it passes in five days or so, like a common cold.

01:44:03.044 --> 01:44:10.949
Over and over again, reinforcing in the minds of everybody listening to this June 1st, 2021 podcast, there's definitely a novel virus.

01:44:11.009 --> 01:44:11.629
I mean, come on.

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:15.572
It's got symptoms that are clotting and lungs.

01:44:15.632 --> 01:44:16.152
It's weird.

01:44:16.512 --> 01:44:17.213
It's strange.

01:44:20.055 --> 01:44:21.175
It comes in phases.

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:26.979
And we're guilty of giving supportive care only.

01:44:28.373 --> 01:44:37.938
But the one supportive care that Kyle Seidel said they were running out of, that Pierre Cory doesn't seem to be able to mention, is the supplementary oxygen.

01:44:39.098 --> 01:44:46.882
No one seems to mention supplementary oxygen as the on-ramp for ARDS.

01:44:47.002 --> 01:44:47.342
No one.

01:44:47.863 --> 01:44:56.007
Even though there are papers in the literature that show it, that somebody like Mark Kulak, who's not even an MD or a biologist, is the first one to have reported on.

01:44:56.067 --> 01:44:56.427
Not me.

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:08.027
not Paul Merrick or Pierre Cory, the experts in critical care and lungs pulmonary medicine.

01:45:09.828 --> 01:45:11.729
They're not gonna tell you that that's dangerous.

01:45:14.131 --> 01:45:17.974
Even though they damn well should know it's dangerous, they're not even gonna say that they've used that.

01:45:19.275 --> 01:45:24.759
One of the things that we do because we're running out of ventilators is that we can give people supplementary oxygen.

01:45:24.799 --> 01:45:26.020
It's not even on the list.

01:45:27.622 --> 01:45:34.428
but we know from countless people that went into the hospital and never came out that that was one of the first things they got.

01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:37.411
We know that from the UK.

01:45:38.212 --> 01:45:39.793
We know that from New York.

01:45:39.893 --> 01:45:43.496
We know that from the Oklahoma case that's going through right now.

01:45:43.536 --> 01:45:54.046
We know that from a lot of these people that haven't bothered to look at their protocol because they were told their friend or their relative didn't get remdesivir or didn't get midazolam.

01:45:54.906 --> 01:46:02.469
But if they got supplementary oxygen for a day or two upon entry into the hospital, all bets are off.

01:46:07.532 --> 01:46:13.374
If they got supplementary oxygen for more than four or five hours, all bets are off.

01:46:13.414 --> 01:46:15.855
You don't need remdesivir or midazolam anymore.

01:46:15.875 --> 01:46:17.636
You just need to make a few more mistakes.

01:46:19.417 --> 01:46:23.719
And depending on the comorbidities of the person that you're treating, those mistakes could all be different.

01:46:27.025 --> 01:46:31.587
Pierre Cory is a liar, and that's why he's involved in the George Floyd trial.

01:46:32.287 --> 01:46:40.831
Pierre Cory is a liar, that's why he was elevated in 2020 with respect to New York, even though he's not licensed in New York state.

01:46:42.471 --> 01:46:51.155
Pierre Cory is a liar because he was elevated by the liar, Brett Weinstein, who I know is a liar because he lied to me for more than a year, personally.

01:46:53.776 --> 01:46:56.637
And I would go to court and testify about it.

01:46:59.062 --> 01:47:05.405
And I would submit all of the evidence that I have on my hard drives as part of my testimony.

01:47:09.447 --> 01:47:19.171
Brett Weinstein's father is a huge piece on this board that nobody's talking about because, again, Brett Weinstein's father connects him directly to Bobby Kennedy and that whole family.

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:28.879
because John F. Kennedy appointed Brett Weinstein's dad as the first patent lawyer to the Department of Justice.

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:37.766
And he contributed intellectually, really contributed intellectually to the ideas that formed the basis for the FDA.

01:47:40.968 --> 01:47:48.534
And Mark has done a spectacular job of bringing some resources together, which show that way beyond a shadow of a doubt.

01:47:50.046 --> 01:47:53.469
We've never heard any of these historians talk about Kefauver.

01:47:54.049 --> 01:47:57.772
Only Mark talks about that senator.

01:48:01.115 --> 01:48:10.183
Only Mark has shown why it's interesting that Brett Weinstein's dad worked on a thalidomide case in Denmark at the time that he worked on it.

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:11.464
Only Mark.

01:48:13.692 --> 01:48:20.858
Not Shannon Joy or Tommy or, you know, Cullen and Goodman or McCarron and Rixey.

01:48:23.119 --> 01:48:27.923
No Jessica Rose podcast about this or Substack about this.

01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:28.243
Nope.

01:48:29.444 --> 01:48:29.885
Crickets.

01:48:31.066 --> 01:48:33.447
Because they're all part of the same team.

01:48:33.487 --> 01:48:39.072
That's why they also have toured the world together for the last four years and show up on stage so often together.

01:48:41.516 --> 01:48:47.659
And that's why if you look at their pattern of cross-promotion, they never cross-promote me and they always cross-promote each other.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.822
It is a lollapalooza of liars and it doesn't matter whose stage you go to.

01:48:53.842 --> 01:48:56.123
You're gonna hear the same covers.

01:48:57.202 --> 01:48:58.102
has been vaccines.

01:48:59.063 --> 01:49:05.746
But if you get to a pandemic and you don't have a vaccine, what you were effectively being told is, look, there's not a whole lot of positive intervention you can do.

01:49:06.066 --> 01:49:09.487
So let's just make them comfortable, rescue them if they need to be rescued.

01:49:09.507 --> 01:49:10.888
But other than that, kind of hands off.

01:49:11.368 --> 01:49:13.409
But here's one of the mistakes.

01:49:13.469 --> 01:49:16.370
So it is correct to say we don't have good antiviral therapies.

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:19.332
It's incorrect to say that they were dying of the virus.

01:49:19.472 --> 01:49:20.932
We knew relatively early on.

01:49:21.293 --> 01:49:25.515
By the time they get to the ICU and they're that sick, there's not a lot of viral replication going on.

01:49:25.535 --> 01:49:28.057
In fact, you can't culture virus after about day seven or eight.

01:49:28.577 --> 01:49:32.179
Look at how many things about virology they know all about.

01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:36.562
They know when virology can be cultured and they're nodding.

01:49:36.602 --> 01:49:37.882
Yeah, I know that too.

01:49:37.962 --> 01:49:38.943
I've read that as well.

01:49:39.403 --> 01:49:45.267
Boy, what a handy thing that we understand virology exactly the same way, even though virology

01:49:46.554 --> 01:49:55.282
is the greatest set of lies and exaggerations ever perpetrated on mankind, as far as I can tell.

01:49:56.142 --> 01:49:58.124
And I am very late to that show.

01:50:00.146 --> 01:50:02.268
There were people before the pandemic who knew it.

01:50:05.491 --> 01:50:12.537
And it was not me, because unfortunately, I did not save my daughter from the childhood vaccine schedule in America.

01:50:12.557 --> 01:50:13.978
I was that dumb.

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:17.304
and I will live with it for the rest of my life.

01:50:24.129 --> 01:50:27.111
And so it's actually disease of inflammation, not viral invasion.

01:50:27.151 --> 01:50:33.697
In fact, in autopsy series, only 20% do they find what's called cytopathic changes from the virus into the lung.

01:50:33.737 --> 01:50:39.141
And so it wasn't, you didn't have to go after the virus at that point, you had to actually check the inflammation.

01:50:39.281 --> 01:50:41.383
Okay, so again, I wanna do a little translation for the audience.

01:50:42.023 --> 01:50:49.712
So inflammation, and by the way, this is a place where I would take doctors to task, but doctors often treat something like inflammation as if it's inflammation, as if it's simply bad.

01:50:49.932 --> 01:50:54.697
The fact is, inflammation is an adaptation that often gets out of control and can easily kill you, right?

01:50:54.818 --> 01:50:55.478
Over exuberant.

01:50:55.538 --> 01:50:56.860
So we have to bring it into check.

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:57.300
Yes.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.143
So what you're telling me is that COVID patients were infected with the virus.

01:51:02.404 --> 01:51:06.606
It triggered a pathway that is part of healing, but triggered an overreaction.

01:51:06.707 --> 01:51:10.729
And the patients who were dying on these ventilators weren't really dying of the virus being so very active.

01:51:10.889 --> 01:51:15.753
They were dying of this cascade of events that follows the body's attempt to fight off a pathogen it's never seen.

01:51:15.853 --> 01:51:25.079
It was a reaction to, in fact, one of the most impressive studies that Paul actually highlighted is that they, what we think triggers the inflammation.

01:51:25.099 --> 01:51:26.740
He keeps using Paul.

01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:30.622
Paul is the reason why you should believe Pierre.

01:51:31.163 --> 01:51:33.684
Paul is the guy who highlighted this study.

01:51:33.724 --> 01:51:35.345
Do you see what is happening there?

01:51:37.226 --> 01:51:40.268
My interpretation of this would be that Paul Merrick's a good guy.

01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:50.774
And Paul Merrick has been saying things like, there's no pandemic, or we don't need the CDC to help us, or there's lots of easy ways to treat an unknown respiratory disease.

01:51:51.215 --> 01:51:54.717
And they needed to step in and make that corrected.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:05.147
And so the way they correct it is they show deference to his expertise and laud him as the guy that they're really rallying behind.

01:52:05.548 --> 01:52:08.150
But then it's actually Pierre Kory that goes on all the shows.

01:52:09.711 --> 01:52:11.412
It's Pierre Kory that gets the book deal.

01:52:11.693 --> 01:52:15.596
It's Pierre Kory that testifies at the George Floyd trial.

01:52:16.837 --> 01:52:21.160
Even though he's pretending like, you know, I'm just rallying behind Paul Merrick because he's so great.

01:52:22.659 --> 01:52:24.502
I think Paul Merrick knew it was a lie.

01:52:24.522 --> 01:52:33.237
I think Paul Merrick's main message was probably it's a lie and that doctors should just be allowed to treat and that needed to be absorbed.

01:52:34.284 --> 01:52:40.928
So they created the FLCCC and they put Corey in front of him and he's actively stepping in front of him right now.

01:52:40.988 --> 01:52:42.388
That's why he keeps mentioning him.

01:52:42.849 --> 01:52:50.873
It is pseudo-deference to make sure that everybody that was following Paul Merrick now sees that it's time to follow this guy instead.

01:52:51.693 --> 01:52:58.557
It's kind of like what they tried to do with Sasha Latupova when they had her do a sub stack about the video with, with, um,

01:52:59.827 --> 01:53:06.412
with James Giordano and then try to pretend that she had just stumbled upon that video and used it to make a similar point that I'm making.

01:53:07.573 --> 01:53:11.676
It's the same, and it's really awkward once you see how they do it.

01:53:11.716 --> 01:53:17.221
They just pretend to promote somebody that they intend to step in front of.

01:53:17.881 --> 01:53:25.608
And it's exactly what Bret Weinstein did to me in 2021 and what I think Bobby Kennedy did with me in that book.

01:53:25.788 --> 01:53:27.329
If I will not go along,

01:53:27.850 --> 01:53:38.956
with the lab leak narrative and claim that I'm the guy who figured it out, then they'll just step in front of me and let someone else say it and forget the fact that they paid me for a year to help them write that book.

01:53:39.016 --> 01:53:43.639
They can just ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist because that's what they gotta do.

01:53:45.114 --> 01:53:46.715
That's what you see happening right here.

01:53:46.735 --> 01:54:03.043
There's no other way to explain how it is that I was paid for a year and a half by that organization, and now they won't even say my name, even though my name is in that book six different times, plus in the acknowledgements, plus in the index, plus in the glossary and list of characters.

01:54:06.885 --> 01:54:11.968
It's the most inconvenient truth in the world right now, the Wuhan coverup book.

01:54:15.373 --> 01:54:18.054
We need every household in America to own that book.

01:54:18.734 --> 01:54:22.516
If only because they'll just be more and more terrified of it.

01:54:23.796 --> 01:54:25.277
Because the truth is inside of it.

01:54:26.778 --> 01:54:30.779
The Sina Bavari and Allison Totura paper is detailed in there.

01:54:30.959 --> 01:54:37.302
The use of recombinant DNA and RNA to create what virology calls infectious clones

01:54:39.355 --> 01:54:40.576
is detailed in that book.

01:54:41.397 --> 01:54:47.922
And a very succinct statement that they don't even need a virus to pull this stuff off is very succinctly in that book.

01:54:49.583 --> 01:54:58.130
And they desperately hoped that if they allowed me to say everything that I tried to say in that book, that they would get away with absorbing me.

01:55:01.773 --> 01:55:02.494
And what happened?

01:55:02.534 --> 01:55:08.659
They had to fire me at the beginning of 2024 because I called out Robert Malone and Meryl Nass as meddlers.

01:55:10.322 --> 01:55:14.005
When I still believed that Bobby was good, they had to fire me already.

01:55:17.367 --> 01:55:25.472
And now, in retrospect, there's no other conclusion I can come to that every single one of these people, to the extent that they could, has played me.

01:55:26.473 --> 01:55:29.375
And the list is very, very long, unfortunately.

01:55:32.777 --> 01:55:36.580
But all my son ever says to me is, doesn't that just mean that you're right, Dad?

01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:46.835
And it's because of the love of my kids and my wife that I keep going, because there's nobody else telling me I'm right.

01:55:47.955 --> 01:55:53.339
Actually, the viral debris, it's the RNA that actually has this, it triggers this massive response to the virus.

01:55:53.399 --> 01:55:55.681
It's not the virus, it's actually the debris of the dead virus.

01:55:55.701 --> 01:55:57.282
The inflammation is actually the viral debris.

01:55:57.302 --> 01:55:59.243
It's the RNA that actually has this.

01:56:00.084 --> 01:56:04.146
The viral debris, the RNA, it's not the proteins that they make.

01:56:04.627 --> 01:56:07.729
I think Kevin McCairn thinks that the virus makes a lot of protein.

01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:10.344
It's the RNA.

01:56:11.145 --> 01:56:11.707
Wow.

01:56:12.128 --> 01:56:15.896
I mean, I think that he doesn't understand virology as well as he's coming off here.

01:56:16.938 --> 01:56:17.960
It's the RNA.

01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.882
Wow.

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.683
this cascade of events that follows the body's attempt to fight off a pathogen it's never seen.

01:56:24.803 --> 01:56:34.912
It was a reaction to, in fact, one of the most impressive studies that Paul actually highlighted is that they, what we think triggers the inflammation is actually the viral debris.

01:56:34.932 --> 01:56:39.456
It's the RNA that actually has this, it triggers this massive response to the virus.

01:56:39.496 --> 01:56:42.218
It's not the virus, it's actually the debris of the dead virus that does it.

01:56:42.258 --> 01:56:45.681
So it's- Well, let me flag something for the future.

01:56:46.941 --> 01:56:58.764
My advisor, who's now gone, a guy named Dick Alexander, used to talk about the point in a respiratory illness when you stop coughing on behalf of your virus and start coughing on your own behalf.

01:56:59.124 --> 01:57:15.468
And the point he was making was that actually these pathogens... Wait, his former advisor, who's not with us anymore, named Dick Alexander, had something anecdotally interesting to say about a respiratory disease?

01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:18.497
Am I hearing this correct?

01:57:18.818 --> 01:57:21.351
What in the absolute shit hell is he talking about?

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:34.129
My advisor who's now gone, a guy named Dick Alexander, used to talk about the point in a respiratory illness when you stop coughing on behalf of your virus and start coughing on your own behalf.

01:57:34.489 --> 01:57:42.355
And the point he was making was that actually these pathogens necessarily induce changes that cause them to be passed on.

01:57:42.475 --> 01:57:48.260
So they will create irritation, they will create inflammation, they will create all kinds of phenomena that are symptoms that are actually

01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:51.582
basically the ecology that allows them to thrive.

01:57:51.602 --> 01:57:51.982
To transmit.

01:57:52.043 --> 01:57:52.243
Right.

01:57:52.923 --> 01:57:56.026
Oh, so the virus intentionally makes us cough.

01:57:56.926 --> 01:58:04.052
It's intentionally irritating our lungs so that we take the time to cough it out and disperse it on others.

01:58:06.814 --> 01:58:16.542
If you need help, what I see here is a person who's working really hard to try and make sure you understand all of these phenomenon that occur

01:58:17.569 --> 01:58:25.393
are out of your control and are caused by things that are outside of you or inconveniently get inside of you.

01:58:28.435 --> 01:58:31.777
Things that you can't control, things that you'll need a vaccine for.

01:58:31.877 --> 01:58:32.877
Brett just said it.

01:58:32.977 --> 01:58:38.400
Antibiotics work great for bacteria, but we've learned that viruses are really gotten rid of by vaccines.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:42.963
And if you don't have a vaccine and it's a virus, well then we're in pretty big trouble here.

01:58:45.478 --> 01:58:46.859
Rewind and listen to it again.

01:58:46.899 --> 01:58:48.980
He said that about five minutes ago or 10 minutes ago.

01:58:51.421 --> 01:59:10.912
This is so incredibly dead on balls narrative and so incredibly awkward in its inbuilt, seemingly unacknowledged incongruencies that there is no other way than to see these two as malevolently participating in some kind of course correction.

01:59:12.213 --> 01:59:13.594
that seems to be necessary.

01:59:13.634 --> 01:59:31.247
They had to do these podcasts to try and get the narrative back on track, to make sure that social media was solving the Scooby-Doo mystery as intended, rather than wherever we were in 2021, maybe waking up from Jonathan's Cooey's review that is titled, Pause All Transfections.

01:59:34.281 --> 01:59:42.244
Maybe we're having to deal with the fact that Byram Bridal is trying to tell everybody to pause all transfections because this shit goes everywhere.

01:59:45.425 --> 01:59:52.548
I suspect it was probably Byram Bridal that has inspired more of this course-correcting narrative curation than me.

01:59:54.232 --> 01:59:56.814
Could be Mike Yeadon, could be Wolfgang Wodach.

01:59:56.854 --> 02:00:03.057
But the bottom line is, is we're not where the national security state and DITRA wanted us to be.

02:00:03.478 --> 02:00:06.720
And so this is the way that they have decided to course correct.

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:13.284
Using the trusted sources that were put in place before the pandemic to try and course correct.

02:00:14.244 --> 02:00:20.388
And so here we have the humble Pierre Kory, certified in Wisconsin and Illinois,

02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:42.065
expert for the Floyd trial, expert for the Senate on what happened in New York City, now making sure to succinctly define what happened in the first year of the pandemic on Les Weinstein's son's podcast, Eric Weinstein's brother's podcast.

02:00:45.208 --> 02:00:48.490
Peter Thiel's advisor's brother's podcast.

02:00:49.670 --> 02:00:57.189
Bret Weinstein's father's Les Weinstein's son's podcast.

02:00:59.850 --> 02:01:10.079
And so, in a sense, I don't know why it's the viral debris, but there's a pretty good chance that this virus learned that by creating debris, it could cause a lot of stuff to accumulate in the lungs that got ejected in some chaotic way.

02:01:10.459 --> 02:01:10.759
Who knows?

02:01:10.819 --> 02:01:11.180
It could be.

02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:12.941
I didn't think of it that way.

02:01:13.021 --> 02:01:13.702
It's worth thinking about.

02:01:13.942 --> 02:01:16.504
But the other point I wanted to... So he hasn't thought of it that way.

02:01:16.564 --> 02:01:22.429
Brett's got actually some interesting alternative theories for how a respiratory virus can cause disease.

02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:25.792
obvious that virology hasn't figured it out yet.

02:01:25.852 --> 02:01:29.234
Otherwise, these two guys wouldn't be like, yeah, I guess that's a possibility too.

02:01:29.795 --> 02:01:34.258
It's such a novel virus that, you know, we're going to have to draw new cartoons about how this one might work.

02:01:34.859 --> 02:01:45.787
And so since I spoke out so early about the, the lab leak, I've earned the right to speak out against the, about the possible mechanisms of how this gain of function virus works.

02:01:47.827 --> 02:01:50.268
I'm not putting any, I'm not going too far here.

02:01:50.288 --> 02:01:51.828
This is exactly what they're implying.

02:01:52.168 --> 02:01:54.269
In June of 2021, they know everything.

02:01:54.329 --> 02:01:58.630
They are certain what they know, and they're certain that they have the right to say it because you know.

02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:08.493
Making reference to your sense as a clinician that you were, you know, effectively having your hands tied behind your back when you knew a whole lot about patients and we're learning more every day, right?

02:02:08.513 --> 02:02:10.154
You needed to be freed to try things.

02:02:10.374 --> 02:02:13.515
And the point I would make is once upon a time,

02:02:14.349 --> 02:02:17.071
Before we were born, doctors were scientists.

02:02:17.311 --> 02:02:21.013
They had fewer tools, but what they had was a whole lot of experience.

02:02:21.053 --> 02:02:24.615
And even, I want to bring attention to the house call, which has now effectively gone extinct.

02:02:25.076 --> 02:02:31.420
But the house call allowed a doctor who didn't have a huge range of pharmacological agents

02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:52.189
tools at his disposal but what he did have was the ability to observe patterns right so if people what he did have according to kevin mckernan on april 24th 2020 was a bag full of weed according to kevin mckernan the most prescribed pharmaceutical in the early history of the united states was just cannabis

02:02:53.587 --> 02:02:56.128
So I guess Brett's not aware of that history.

02:02:56.148 --> 02:03:00.491
People on one side of town were sick with something, and people on the other side of town weren't.

02:03:00.731 --> 02:03:02.812
Maybe there was something in the water, for example.

02:03:02.832 --> 02:03:13.337
So anyway, that ability to observe patterns was part of a scientific mindset that my impression, having interacted with doctors over my lifetime, is that that mindset has basically dwindled.

02:03:13.497 --> 02:03:16.038
I love that you're going back, because I love the history of medicine.

02:03:16.139 --> 02:03:20.821
And when I read stuff from 100 years ago, you're constantly shocked by how much they knew.

02:03:21.181 --> 02:03:21.681
Oh, really?

02:03:21.741 --> 02:03:23.201
I'm interested about what they knew.

02:03:23.261 --> 02:03:26.242
Let's do something here, because that just queues this up.

02:03:26.262 --> 02:03:26.962
We might as well do it.

02:03:27.002 --> 02:03:31.743
I gotta unplug for a second, because this is attached to my shorts.

02:03:44.705 --> 02:03:48.866
I don't know if you guys remember or not, but a couple weeks ago,

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:59.175
I spent too much money on a set of books that are the Foster's Encyclopedic Medic Dictionary from 1896.

02:04:12.688 --> 02:04:13.428
It looks like this.

02:04:13.548 --> 02:04:14.508
It's four volumes.

02:04:15.729 --> 02:04:17.449
And I'm in volume four.

02:04:18.349 --> 02:04:22.230
And it is from M-I-N-N to Z-Y-T-H.

02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:27.391
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna try not to tear any pages and I don't have my white gloves.

02:04:28.931 --> 02:04:31.632
Because somebody put this in my hands for a reason.

02:04:31.892 --> 02:04:34.492
And so I don't think we have to worry about it going anywhere.

02:04:35.092 --> 02:04:37.873
What I thought would be interesting would be to look up smallpox.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.861
Because smallpox is of course something that they were familiar with in the 1800s.

02:04:45.202 --> 02:04:46.862
And so I should be able to do S-M.

02:04:46.902 --> 02:04:49.183
I'm so bad with guide words.

02:04:49.263 --> 02:04:50.103
It's hilarious.

02:04:50.163 --> 02:04:53.124
I remember doing this as a kid and being really bad at it too.

02:04:54.865 --> 02:05:01.527
E-I-H-I-J-K-L-M-N.

02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:02.407
Sorry.

02:05:03.148 --> 02:05:04.928
M-M.

02:05:05.768 --> 02:05:06.569
Smallpox.

02:05:06.609 --> 02:05:07.109
Here we go.

02:05:11.095 --> 02:05:16.297
Okay, now what kinds of things do you think you should see in the definition of smallpox?

02:05:16.898 --> 02:05:19.379
If we go to the, whoops, sorry.

02:05:20.739 --> 02:05:24.081
If we go to the, what the hell?

02:05:24.121 --> 02:05:24.801
Why isn't this on?

02:05:29.644 --> 02:05:30.624
Okay, sorry about that.

02:05:31.024 --> 02:05:32.565
I'll switch over here quick.

02:05:34.577 --> 02:05:38.559
So what should we see if we look at smallpox in this book?

02:05:38.619 --> 02:05:44.682
Now I'm not going to turn any pages underneath the camera because that's how I screwed up last time.

02:05:44.962 --> 02:05:45.962
I got to move my mouse.

02:05:47.243 --> 02:05:55.366
I'm trying to respect the book as much as possible while at the same time realizing that this book is going to die no matter what I do to it because I'm not a museum.

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.187
So here we go.

02:05:57.207 --> 02:05:58.308
I'm going to slide over here.

02:05:59.358 --> 02:06:00.859
And we're going to look at smallpox.

02:06:01.319 --> 02:06:06.480
And I'm going to try and, this is not very easy for me because this is not the space supposed to be.

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.681
It's supposed to be where I write.

02:06:08.981 --> 02:06:10.902
So it's not going to be totally readable.

02:06:11.022 --> 02:06:11.822
I, oh shit.

02:06:12.162 --> 02:06:12.443
Sorry.

02:06:12.663 --> 02:06:13.183
I get that.

02:06:13.203 --> 02:06:14.823
I'm going to break my setup here.

02:06:16.144 --> 02:06:20.005
But I'll try and put it next to the keyboard a little bit so you can kind of see it.

02:06:20.045 --> 02:06:22.926
And then maybe if I push it down, it will become a little bit more in.

02:06:25.707 --> 02:06:27.008
Maybe I can push it down with this.

02:06:27.788 --> 02:06:27.968
So.

02:06:30.037 --> 02:06:43.164
It says, an infectious, contagious, acute febrile disease chiefly characterized by a pustular exanthem upon the skin.

02:06:43.804 --> 02:06:58.412
In most cases, the eruption begins about the fourth day of the fever in the form of papules that turn first into vesicles and then into pustules attended with phlegmonous inflammation.

02:07:00.222 --> 02:07:11.870
which are succeeded by crusts and finally by more or less marked circuitruses or pits, variola pustulosa.

02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:23.137
In other cases, the exanthem does not become pustular, but is characterized by an intense arithmetosis, congestion and hemorrhages.

02:07:24.258 --> 02:07:29.902
So that sounds nasty, but I'm not really, they're not saying dead.

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:48.765
in which vesicles fill with, so wait, intentional inoculation in an unvaccinated person, smallpox occurring causally and not intentional inoculation in an unvaccinated person.

02:07:49.765 --> 02:07:57.928
So it seems to imply here also that when you inoculate somebody, they can also get smallpox, but that's not smallpox.

02:07:57.988 --> 02:07:59.228
That's variola, but I'm,

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:01.341
Okay, I'm reading it.

02:08:04.823 --> 02:08:14.191
But don't you find it a little strange that they don't say that it's a deadly virus or that it's a deadly disease that has killed millions of people already?

02:08:14.251 --> 02:08:23.659
Because isn't that the history of smallpox, that we're supposed to believe that millions of people were killed by it, yet there in a medical dictionary, they don't bother to say that it's deadly?

02:08:26.496 --> 02:08:38.028
The pustules lead to pits, so scarring on people's face seems like the most awful part about it, because they don't mention death.

02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:42.550
I find that pretty extraordinary.

02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:57.220
For a person who really likes the history of medicine, I wonder if he's aware of how much sanitation and aseptic technique and good food contributed to the decline of disease.

02:09:00.363 --> 02:09:06.347
I think it's very extraordinary that I don't have to work very hard with a book like this to find countless examples of that.

02:09:07.458 --> 02:09:13.801
where something that we're told has a very specific history doesn't seem to mention that specific history here at all.

02:09:15.722 --> 02:09:21.624
This book marker right here marks the page where they talk about vaccination.

02:09:22.925 --> 02:09:25.185
I can't wait to open up that page when it's needed.

02:09:28.267 --> 02:09:29.147
I love this book.

02:09:29.367 --> 02:09:32.008
I think this set of books is so spectacular.

02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:35.610
And I think it might be this, actually this module,

02:09:37.165 --> 02:10:04.765
this oh yeah so check this out the other thing that's in this is they all have this very special page in the front that's got like this artwork that if you think I you don't want me to touch the others pages and you definitely don't want me to touch this this artwork is in the fourth volume it's the only color artwork in the book and it's in the very front of the book and what is it it's pictures of crystals that come out of the urine

02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:12.217
It is principal and normal, abnormal constituents of human urine redrawn by some dude.

02:10:13.278 --> 02:10:14.019
Check these out.

02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:16.222
How cool is that?

02:10:17.824 --> 02:10:18.605
How cool is that?

02:10:18.645 --> 02:10:20.888
So every one of these volumes

02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:24.441
Seems to open with a plate like that.

02:10:24.542 --> 02:10:30.965
Like if you see it, it's a plate that's got this very thin page of something that covers it.

02:10:31.025 --> 02:10:33.747
It's super, oh careful, don't bend things.

02:10:34.367 --> 02:10:35.488
It's super cool.

02:10:35.528 --> 02:10:37.809
These books are like the treasure of all treasures.

02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:42.412
I'm so happy that somehow or another I ended up being able to acquire them.

02:10:42.892 --> 02:10:48.335
And I just, whenever I'm cued, which just happened right now, I feel like I got to pull them in.

02:10:48.415 --> 02:10:50.957
So anyway, here we go.

02:10:51.581 --> 02:10:55.377
Back to the Pierre, Corey, and Brett Weinstein show.

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:57.329
with very little of it.

02:10:57.349 --> 02:11:02.712
I mean, they don't have the experiments or the techniques to discover what now we know.

02:11:03.012 --> 02:11:05.174
They did it all by powers of observation.

02:11:05.514 --> 02:11:09.377
And really, medicine was created by the best doctors who had the keenest powers.

02:11:09.397 --> 02:11:14.240
So the giants of medicine had these unbelievable powers of observation, and they were able to do a lot.

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:20.044
And that's why I always say to my students, I always say that what separates sort of them from me, we've read the same books.

02:11:20.084 --> 02:11:20.764
We all have the textbooks.

02:11:22.185 --> 02:11:23.826
But an expert has pattern recognition.

02:11:23.846 --> 02:11:25.867
You just see diseases play out.

02:11:25.907 --> 02:11:28.428
You see how different people react to same illnesses.

02:11:28.448 --> 02:11:30.069
And you just get to see patterns and patterns.

02:11:30.489 --> 02:11:39.493
And what happened to me, I love talking about this, but every time I came to the bedside of a patient and there was something wrong with them, I always had to very deliberately kind of analyze like it could be this or this or this.

02:11:39.973 --> 02:11:42.995
And after about a couple of years being immersed in ICU medicine,

02:11:43.675 --> 02:11:46.757
I noticed that I could now walk into a room.

02:11:46.777 --> 02:11:47.398
1894, did you see that?

02:11:47.418 --> 02:11:50.420
With very little information, just kind of know what was going on.

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:52.682
It suddenly became like intuitive and second nature.

02:11:52.702 --> 02:11:53.062
I have four.

02:11:53.082 --> 02:11:55.544
And it was all just about observing patterns.

02:11:55.564 --> 02:11:56.064
I have four of them.

02:11:56.084 --> 02:11:56.925
I think that's really key.

02:11:57.165 --> 02:12:05.111
And that's why with this disease, this is not an ego exercise, but we knew you had to anticoagulate these patients within like four patients.

02:12:05.551 --> 02:12:08.393
We knew they were clotting to degrees that we hadn't seen.

02:12:08.493 --> 02:12:12.877
And there was so much controversy around putting someone on a blood thinner, which

02:12:13.377 --> 02:12:17.181
People are put on blood thinners in hospitals for far less reasons than we were promoting with this.

02:12:17.782 --> 02:12:20.145
And so it was just evidence-based maniacism.

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:21.046
It was bizarre.

02:12:21.206 --> 02:12:26.592
Like, now you can't observe, you can't make clinical reasoning, you can't deduce, you need a trial before you do anything.

02:12:26.752 --> 02:12:30.196
Okay, so this is, I must tell you, exactly the same thing in my field.

02:12:30.536 --> 02:12:41.449
The people who are really good evolutionary biologists or ecologists, evolutionary ecologists in the best cases, have intuition, they know how to follow a hunch, they know how to figure out when their hunches are wrong.

02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:44.813
The point is, it's an art more than a science, actually.

02:12:45.914 --> 02:12:51.620
In the case of a brand new pandemic that is spreading like wildfire, this is, of course, exactly the mindset that you want.

02:12:51.660 --> 02:13:07.096
You want... In the case of a novel pandemic that's spreading like wildfire, just like Charles Rixey has explained for the last four years straight because of a furin cleavage site that cued me off into knowing it was a lab leak... Stop lying!

02:13:12.392 --> 02:13:31.520
I hope you can see that just like the podcasts of Kevin McKernan in 2020, the podcasts of these people in 2021 reveal them as the Red Inn narrative curators that were brought on the scene to try and get the thing back on track, to try and get us back on the rails.

02:13:32.745 --> 02:13:51.947
because maybe warp speed or something had accelerated things that they are introducing things at different times and so the way that they intended to do it over a few years was accelerated into a couple or maybe even into one and there are so so awkward here

02:13:52.932 --> 02:14:16.328
The only way to see this is not that, wow, we're finally figuring it out in June of 2021, but no, actually we're so off course that we have to have Les Weinstein's son, Eric Weinstein's brother, do a podcast with a number of people that are involved in curating the narrative.

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:21.171
And that includes Pierre Cory, that includes Robert Malone, that includes Steve Kirsch, et cetera.

02:14:23.208 --> 02:14:33.751
This is the real-time history of the pandemic narrative being curated by the real-time players that are working for the slavers.

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:38.803
that I've been trying to call attention to for almost three years now.

02:14:39.143 --> 02:14:48.529
People who are capable of deducing that there is some pattern, and then figuring out whether they were fooled by some sort of noise pattern, or whether it was actually something, testing a hypothesis.

02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:56.094
But there is a point at which you know, and you know better than a study, because you've acted on that hunch, and you've seen that the patients get better, and it happens enough times that it can't

02:14:56.314 --> 02:15:07.140
The fact of the matter is, Dark Horse and that symbol is just as revealing as the lion mask that Robert Malone uses behind himself.

02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:15.544
There's an army unit for the love of God that says they're called the Dark Horse and they do psi-ops.

02:15:15.624 --> 02:15:17.185
That's not by accident.

02:15:18.123 --> 02:15:30.413
And if you wanted to be a person who was trying to bring the truth, you would not choose something that you could just Google and find out was a term used to describe the PSYOPs in American armies.

02:15:32.395 --> 02:15:33.636
Like you just wouldn't use it.

02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:39.221
Instead, they used it.

02:15:40.442 --> 02:15:40.722
random.

02:15:41.203 --> 02:15:47.847
And so anyway, there's something about the mindset of the moment in which it's all about peer review.

02:15:48.567 --> 02:15:58.074
And the mindset of the moment makes me draw my attention back to the interview on 60 Minutes of Alex Karp, the head of Palantir.

02:15:58.974 --> 02:16:04.258
Because that's another guy who I think revealed things that we should have seen a long time ago.

02:16:05.575 --> 02:16:14.804
pretending on 60 Minutes that he was interested in the big issues, you know, like how do we really know something and whether or not citizens can actually participate in a democracy.

02:16:16.565 --> 02:16:26.995
Basically talking about the same things that Edward Bernays talked about in 1920 already, the statement that I use over and over again that I got from Veer Sharav,

02:16:28.530 --> 02:16:37.784
which is that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized opinions and habits of the masses is an absolutely integral part to a democracy.

02:16:40.342 --> 02:16:42.444
And that's what you are witnessing right here.

02:16:42.604 --> 02:16:45.106
That's what you are witnessing on social media.

02:16:45.146 --> 02:16:47.007
That's what you are witnessing on TV.

02:16:47.087 --> 02:16:55.533
It is a coordinated Lollapalooza of liars that has been elevated artificially to ask questions that cannot save our children.

02:16:56.054 --> 02:17:06.001
And they have been doing it to us before the pandemic, but during the pandemic, they have done it in a way and in a magnitude and on a crescendo never before seen in human history.

02:17:06.949 --> 02:17:12.713
these published peer reviewed papers, and it's all about the official guidance from, you know, the WHO and the CDC.

02:17:12.933 --> 02:17:24.039
And it's basically a kind of intellectual authoritarianism that is so bizarre in the context of a complex system like medicine, especially in the context of a brand new disease that, you know, we're all not expert.

02:17:24.099 --> 02:17:29.423
And so they're actively participating by pretending that they are not part of that system.

02:17:30.163 --> 02:17:31.284
But in fact, they are.

02:17:31.924 --> 02:17:39.727
They work for the same people, they work for the same weaponized piles of money, and that's why they are asking specific questions that will trap us.

02:17:41.508 --> 02:17:50.512
That's why so many of us are still trapped, because this was so convincing at the time, and no one is being allowed to look back at it and reconsider it.

02:17:51.493 --> 02:17:52.674
except for by me and Mark.

02:17:53.555 --> 02:17:56.078
No one else wants to look back and reconsider it.

02:17:56.498 --> 02:18:00.463
They want you to focus specifically on what did Pierre Kory say last week?

02:18:01.364 --> 02:18:05.188
What did Pierre Kory say on the Jimmy Dore show?

02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:10.474
What did Pierre Kory say in response to so-and-so's substack?

02:18:12.298 --> 02:18:23.701
Why doesn't anyone realize that Pierre Corey was the witness in the Floyd trial and find that a little strange because he's not a doctor in Minnesota.

02:18:26.722 --> 02:18:28.703
And he was supposed to be in New York then.

02:18:31.543 --> 02:18:33.144
What the hell is going on here?

02:18:35.987 --> 02:18:46.158
And is the internet gonna be just as silent about this anomaly as they have been about the anomaly of, hey, wait a minute, you know, Grace's dad brings up an important point.

02:18:46.198 --> 02:18:53.847
What if this whole thing was started with the FLCC and others saying that low pulse ox was a reason to go to the hospital?

02:18:57.398 --> 02:19:03.460
Why is it that Grace's dad is the only person that's ever brought that up to me in all the years that I've been working on this?

02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:09.002
Why is it that since I've come upon this, even the people that I trust most don't seem to be able to repeat it?

02:19:17.405 --> 02:19:18.605
Mark and I are the only ones.

02:19:22.526 --> 02:19:24.527
There are no experts that we can simply default to.

02:19:24.688 --> 02:19:26.249
Everybody's, you know, a novice.

02:19:26.809 --> 02:19:29.511
I like that term, intellectual authoritarianism.

02:19:30.051 --> 02:19:34.634
There are no intellectual authorities we can defer to because we're all novices.

02:19:34.754 --> 02:19:35.135
Why?

02:19:35.675 --> 02:19:40.078
Because it's a novel virus that's killing millions of people for which we have no cures for.

02:19:40.098 --> 02:19:43.400
It likely came from a laboratory and I was the first one to say it.

02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:49.684
So, you know, I have the right to speak up now and it'll probably come again because, you know, viruses are out there.

02:19:49.704 --> 02:19:50.925
That definitely happens.

02:19:50.965 --> 02:19:52.266
Viral syndromes are real.

02:19:53.046 --> 02:19:58.069
And so I guess it'll come again if this was a lab leak and maybe this is a good one and the next one will be worse.

02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:05.272
2021 of June, this coordinated Lollapalooza of liars was already a year deep.

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:11.762
Actually, although I don't know that it was occurring to this degree or even remotely to this degree pre-COVID.

02:20:12.243 --> 02:20:17.247
I actually I looked around in COVID and I started to see like all the institutions coming up with their treatment protocols.

02:20:17.607 --> 02:20:26.215
You weren't allowed to stray from the protocol even like if you're an expert and you're like I want to like literally the leaders of the hospitals were saying don't use and you couldn't do anything.

02:20:26.415 --> 02:20:30.860
So the interesting thing about this is this is not the argument that that

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:36.462
And I'm just remembering because remembering the truth means you don't have to remember anything, just what pops in.

02:20:37.382 --> 02:20:44.665
This is not, not, not, it's not the argument that Peter McCullough made.

02:20:45.285 --> 02:20:47.866
Listen to it again and then I'll tell you what Peter McCullough said.

02:20:48.783 --> 02:20:50.344
Everybody's, you know, a novice.

02:20:50.885 --> 02:20:53.006
I like that term, intellectual authoritarianism.

02:20:53.486 --> 02:20:59.531
And it actually, although I don't know that it was occurring to this degree or even remotely to this degree pre-COVID.

02:21:00.031 --> 02:21:05.035
I actually, I looked around in COVID and I started to see like all the institutions coming up with their treatment protocols.

02:21:05.395 --> 02:21:08.017
You weren't allowed to stray from the protocol, even like if you're an expert.

02:21:08.257 --> 02:21:10.899
All the institutions coming up with their protocols.

02:21:10.959 --> 02:21:13.260
That's the opposite of what Peter McCullough was arguing.

02:21:14.121 --> 02:21:16.243
Peter McCullough was actually arguing that, hey,

02:21:17.582 --> 02:21:31.452
Usually when something like this happens, Yale and Harvard and Texas Tech and every one of these hospitals prides themselves on coming up with their own protocol.

02:21:33.634 --> 02:21:35.135
And for COVID, nobody did that.

02:21:40.619 --> 02:21:41.640
Dude, this is huge.

02:21:43.052 --> 02:21:45.233
And I told you this was going to be an important stream.

02:21:45.433 --> 02:21:53.336
Every stream that we do from now on, knowing what we know, is going to contribute directly to the coming landslide.

02:21:55.597 --> 02:22:00.579
Where all of these posers are discarded as one chorus.

02:22:01.999 --> 02:22:05.721
Because they have revealed themselves as one chorus.

02:22:07.241 --> 02:22:11.503
Where so many of them are convinced that Pierre Kory, George Floyd expert,

02:22:12.938 --> 02:22:13.498
is a hero.

02:22:13.838 --> 02:22:19.041
Pierre Cory, high flow oxygen expert, is a hero.

02:22:24.784 --> 02:22:26.885
Or at least the person to argue with.

02:22:29.096 --> 02:22:35.201
and you're like, I wanna like, literally the leaders of the hospitals were saying, don't use, and you couldn't do anything else.

02:22:35.241 --> 02:22:36.401
You couldn't actually doctor.

02:22:36.441 --> 02:22:38.703
And suddenly I felt like I was being handcuffed.

02:22:38.863 --> 02:22:39.464
It was bizarre.

02:22:39.624 --> 02:22:41.065
I've never seen that in my life before.

02:22:41.105 --> 02:22:41.605
I have the same.

02:22:41.645 --> 02:22:45.108
But how, it only takes your hospital to handcuff you, right?

02:22:45.168 --> 02:22:53.854
And speaking of all hospitals in America and saying it felt like handcuffed, the only hospital that made you feel handcuffed was the one in Wisconsin, right?

02:22:53.894 --> 02:22:56.416
Because that's why you went to New York.

02:22:57.930 --> 02:22:59.351
I hope we get to that part soon.

02:22:59.631 --> 02:23:06.377
The doctors have been demoted, forcibly demoted from the position of scientific clinician to technician.

02:23:06.497 --> 02:23:14.844
And the point is you're really delivering a prepackaged good more than you are- That couldn't happen unless they sent all the attendings home, which they did.

02:23:14.964 --> 02:23:26.134
So they're overlooking part of the PSYOP here as well, that they put young residents in charge because old doctors were in danger of the spreading novel pathogen.

02:23:26.784 --> 02:23:29.547
to understand your patient and what they're sick with and what they therefore need.

02:23:29.868 --> 02:23:30.708
And it's a travesty.

02:23:31.089 --> 02:23:32.530
I've never been asked to do that before.

02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:38.617
I've always been asked to use the best extent of my experience and judgment and insight to best help the patient.

02:23:38.637 --> 02:23:39.518
That's the oath I took.

02:23:39.738 --> 02:23:46.285
The oath wasn't do what the gods of science and we – Paul calls the healthcare leaders the gods of science and knowledge, right?

02:23:46.546 --> 02:23:47.587
The Paul thing again.

02:23:49.128 --> 02:24:01.680
We're just little mortals and we have to listen to the gods and I've never been asked that before to get advice from – oftentimes, I'm sorry but I don't want to sound so dismissive but many of them are really desk jockeys.

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:03.241
I mean they're not on the front lines.

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.344
They're reading some papers.

02:24:06.364 --> 02:24:07.645
They think they know what the disease is.

02:24:07.665 --> 02:24:08.946
They don't know what this disease is.

02:24:09.166 --> 02:24:15.170
They're not sweating it out, seeing day to day the manifestations, the responses to therapy, the lack of responses.

02:24:15.391 --> 02:24:18.193
They don't understand this disease, and yet they're telling everyone how to treat it.

02:24:18.213 --> 02:24:25.078
And I find it, we want- What's implied here, of course, is that Brett and Corey understand the disease.

02:24:26.198 --> 02:24:31.703
What's implied here is that as his experience-based medicine understands the disease, they just got to listen to him.

02:24:32.708 --> 02:24:35.010
This is some pretty high elevation right now.

02:24:35.130 --> 02:24:40.194
We're pulling back on the hand glider and going as high as we can right now.

02:24:40.314 --> 02:24:41.235
Listen to me.

02:24:41.315 --> 02:24:43.297
These people don't understand this disease.

02:24:43.677 --> 02:24:45.599
A seat at the table, expert clinicians.

02:24:45.639 --> 02:24:47.100
Where's the expert clinician committee?

02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:47.481
Right.

02:24:48.021 --> 02:24:49.482
I absolutely agree.

02:24:50.722 --> 02:24:57.385
Now, why does the expert physician or clinician committee now contain the same people?

02:24:57.445 --> 02:25:09.650
It contains, let's see, Robert Malone, who's not a clinician, Meryl Nass, who only is a backwoods doctor from Maine, who actually is primarily famous for her anthrax blog.

02:25:11.011 --> 02:25:13.052
What other clinicians are in the thing?

02:25:14.332 --> 02:25:15.473
Is Jessica Rosen?

02:25:15.533 --> 02:25:16.833
No, she's not a clinician.

02:25:17.874 --> 02:25:21.076
What about Jill Glasspool Malone?

02:25:21.156 --> 02:25:22.476
No, she's not a clinician.

02:25:23.477 --> 02:25:27.659
What about maybe Brian Hooker?

02:25:27.719 --> 02:25:28.800
No, he's not a clinician.

02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:30.240
What about Laura Logan?

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.281
No, not a clinician.

02:25:31.581 --> 02:25:32.562
How about the Canadians?

02:25:32.682 --> 02:25:35.823
No, those were politicians and bloggers.

02:25:35.943 --> 02:25:36.944
No.

02:25:37.564 --> 02:25:38.425
What other doctors?

02:25:38.525 --> 02:25:42.067
Pierre Corey, Peter McCullough,

02:25:43.021 --> 02:25:46.143
Merrill Nass, Robert Malone.

02:25:46.363 --> 02:25:53.167
I'm having trouble coming up with the MDs that he would propose to be on the clinical committee.

02:25:54.367 --> 02:26:07.555
It's a little weird because, again, the story that they're telling is that all doctors in the world should be able to tell us about the symptoms of COVID from last year, even though he insists he's the only one who knows.

02:26:08.749 --> 02:26:11.431
All these doctors don't know anything, but he knows.

02:26:12.012 --> 02:26:17.076
And he's known since 2020, back when he went to New York, which he's not being very specific about.

02:26:20.459 --> 02:26:21.880
Stop lying!

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:24.102
I see that at the level of doctoring.

02:26:24.322 --> 02:26:26.804
I see that at the level of the pandemic itself.

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:27.184
Yes.

02:26:27.344 --> 02:26:27.524
Right?

02:26:27.684 --> 02:26:30.206
The fact is, we have a novel phenomenon.

02:26:30.307 --> 02:26:33.329
It came potentially from an unusual source, right?

02:26:33.369 --> 02:26:34.870
A knowable source, potentially.

02:26:35.271 --> 02:26:37.212
What we are supposed to do about it to actually

02:26:38.513 --> 02:26:57.408
take care of it so that it does not become a permanent fellow traveler of humanity that take there's the conundrum will it become a permanent traveler of humanity or will we be able to get to zero covid another crucial idea that brett weinstein needs to spike into the ground as many times as he can in june of 2021 apparently

02:27:00.689 --> 02:27:07.154
It's really smart, insightful, courageous people who have been totally liberated to have whatever discussions need to be had.

02:27:07.214 --> 02:27:13.259
Instead, we're in a situation where if we open our mouths and say the wrong words, suddenly there are warnings appended to what we've said.

02:27:13.419 --> 02:27:14.280
It's insane.

02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.262
It's limiting discussion, limiting choices, limiting approaches.

02:27:17.322 --> 02:27:17.963
And killing people.

02:27:18.083 --> 02:27:18.483
It's hurting.

02:27:19.924 --> 02:27:24.288
And I don't know, do we, do we have whatever discussions to be had?

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:30.372
Instead, we're in a situation where if we open our mouths and say the wrong words, suddenly there are warnings appended to what we've said.

02:27:30.492 --> 02:27:31.373
It's insane.

02:27:31.453 --> 02:27:34.355
It's limiting discussion, limiting choices, limiting approaches.

02:27:34.415 --> 02:27:35.596
And it's hurting.

02:27:35.937 --> 02:27:37.898
And killing people, said Brett.

02:27:38.198 --> 02:27:38.779
Interesting.

02:27:38.839 --> 02:27:40.240
I think that needs to be corrected.

02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:40.660
Yes, it's.

02:27:41.701 --> 02:27:42.221
And I don't know.

02:27:42.822 --> 02:27:44.983
He didn't say, yes, they are killing people.

02:27:45.043 --> 02:27:46.163
Yes, it is murder.

02:27:46.704 --> 02:27:47.664
It's malpractice.

02:27:47.724 --> 02:27:48.364
It's something.

02:27:48.424 --> 02:27:49.065
No, no.

02:27:49.145 --> 02:27:50.205
Pierre did not say that.

02:27:50.265 --> 02:27:52.306
That was not what Brett was supposed to say there.

02:27:52.486 --> 02:27:55.588
And totally liberated to have whatever discussions need to be had.

02:27:55.648 --> 02:28:01.651
Instead, we're in a situation where if we open our mouths and say the wrong words, suddenly there are warnings appended to what we've said.

02:28:01.771 --> 02:28:02.631
It's insane.

02:28:02.731 --> 02:28:05.613
It's limiting discussion, limiting choices, limiting approaches.

02:28:05.673 --> 02:28:06.833
And it's hurting.

02:28:06.853 --> 02:28:07.013
Yes.

02:28:08.274 --> 02:28:11.216
And I don't know what do we... Corey wanted to say hurting people.

02:28:11.276 --> 02:28:11.556
Yes.

02:28:11.957 --> 02:28:12.217
Yeah.

02:28:12.237 --> 02:28:12.457
Yeah.

02:28:12.597 --> 02:28:12.817
Right.

02:28:12.897 --> 02:28:13.538
Killing people.

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.659
Did we all forget the history books that we read?

02:28:15.699 --> 02:28:17.901
Like, when has censorship ever been a good thing?

02:28:17.941 --> 02:28:18.241
Yeah.

02:28:18.281 --> 02:28:19.762
When are the censors ever the good guys?

02:28:20.963 --> 02:28:23.025
When has that ever led to a societal good?

02:28:23.125 --> 02:28:24.506
And now it's censorship.

02:28:25.967 --> 02:28:42.918
Well, that is, I mean, and I really hope that whatever thing it is inside of YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn that has its meetings, I hope they look at this and they sit down and somebody in the room is courageous enough to look at everybody else and say, are we the bad guys in this story?

02:28:42.958 --> 02:28:44.519
And if so, how did that happen?

02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.261
I get the intention, right?

02:28:47.341 --> 02:28:51.424
So you want to protect people because medical misinformation might harm them.

02:28:51.784 --> 02:28:54.286
But what I find, I have two problems with that, which is

02:28:55.226 --> 02:29:13.391
who's the who's gonna you know if you're gonna limit science i mean science that's antithetical to science science is about exploration here we are again using science like debunk the funk dan wilson uses it science is a hard subject for people to understand science is hard for people about the season and scientists never discovered

02:29:14.091 --> 02:29:15.252
at the NIH building, right?

02:29:15.292 --> 02:29:17.693
It's actually the people on the ground doing experiments, making deductions.

02:29:18.113 --> 02:29:21.294
We should flow the information to them, not they flow information to us.

02:29:21.574 --> 02:29:22.135
So that's that.

02:29:22.215 --> 02:29:34.160
And then the placing of medical misinformation on a par with like violent hate speech, white supremacy, like, I'm sorry, but medical, you know, medical information, it's not as harmful as you would think.

02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:37.745
I mean, you know, people are afraid that... So there is medical misinformation.

02:29:37.805 --> 02:29:48.520
Wait, I thought that we were saying something like there is nothing certain in medicine or that biology is so complex we can't know anything for certain or not every cure would be good for every person.

02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:50.223
No, no, that's not what they're saying at all.

02:29:53.211 --> 02:29:54.914
Make sure you're very clear about that.

02:29:54.954 --> 02:29:56.156
That's not what they're saying at all.

02:29:56.176 --> 02:30:06.112
They're not talking about the irreducible complexity that needs respecting or the infinite diversity that is sorely misunderstood or not understood at all.

02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:10.833
They're talking about something very different, not the other way around.

02:30:11.093 --> 02:30:11.654
So there's that.

02:30:11.734 --> 02:30:23.664
And then the placing of medical misinformation on a par with like violent hate speech, white supremacy, like, I'm sorry, but medical, you know, it's not as harmful as you would think.

02:30:23.844 --> 02:30:31.310
I mean, people- So how helpful are they being right now by saying that medical information, medical misinformation is not as harmful as you might think?

02:30:34.502 --> 02:30:40.554
How is this the relevant discussion to have, the relevant question to ask, the relevant answers to debate?

02:30:46.596 --> 02:30:50.398
afraid that you're gonna espouse some medicine that's not gonna work and they're gonna hurt someone.

02:30:51.158 --> 02:30:54.180
I think people do not need to be protected to that extent.

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:55.280
I mean, people have judgment.

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:56.461
They do lots of things in the world.

02:30:57.181 --> 02:30:57.802
You know what I'm saying?

02:30:57.822 --> 02:30:58.982
Censorship's not the answer to that.

02:30:59.042 --> 02:31:05.025
Well, I would say censorship's not the answer to people trying their best.

02:31:07.967 --> 02:31:15.171
But their whole assumption is based on the idea that the national security state and its actors would never lie to us

02:31:16.081 --> 02:31:19.462
in agreement, in concert about something that didn't exist.

02:31:20.062 --> 02:31:21.063
That would be crazy.

02:31:22.983 --> 02:31:31.466
We're supposed to believe that these guys are doing their best to pull our head out and expose the lies that the national security state is covering up.

02:31:32.796 --> 02:31:51.880
when in reality, they are seeding the other half of a limited spectrum of debate that makes almost certain our kids and our grandkids will never see the lie of the national security state, which is the gain of function mythology and the vaccine schedule in America.

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:53.560
Those are lies.

02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:59.621
They are criminal enterprises and mythologies that they want to use to enslave everyone in the world.

02:32:00.205 --> 02:32:05.090
The problem is that you get the harm to people on both sides, right?

02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:12.118
If you try to constrain things to only the information that we're really, really, really certain of, you're going to kill a lot of people because you're not going to benefit from the exploration.

02:32:12.138 --> 02:32:22.069
And if I can actually just draw an analogy between what you do, you know, with your individual patients and the situation that civilization has caught in with COVID more broadly.

02:32:22.969 --> 02:32:30.573
In the ICU, and I don't know I've never been an ICU doc, but in the ICU you are dealing with people who are really sick.

02:32:31.133 --> 02:32:32.233
Their lives are on the line.

02:32:32.253 --> 02:32:33.174
The sickest of the sick.

02:32:33.214 --> 02:32:33.374
Right.

02:32:33.474 --> 02:32:39.297
Now if I'm in that bed, right, and you're my doctor, my sense is I do not want you

02:32:40.277 --> 02:33:00.135
So terrified that you may kill me trying to help me that you are paralyzed I want you to take your best shot at getting me through it and I am accepting That you may kill me because the chances are you are more likely to help me So when we are talking about the question of what these therapies are we are in the middle of a brand new disease?

02:33:00.155 --> 02:33:02.457
Yeah, we are discovering if it turned out that

02:33:03.174 --> 02:33:07.958
that you were wrong about ivermectin, then some people would die.

02:33:08.078 --> 02:33:14.883
But the number of people who have already died because we haven't used this drug is absolutely immense.

02:33:15.503 --> 02:33:17.705
So the point is, look, let's be adults.

02:33:17.745 --> 02:33:26.031
So that's a pretty certain thing to be certain about, that ivermectin, if was used correctly, would save millions of people.

02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:44.606
from something that they're not even sure is killing anyone, can't be sure is killing anyone, and seem the farthest away from coming to the conclusion that the national security state could just lie and use something as simple as high flow nasal oxygen as a I don't know what else to do kind of situation.

02:33:45.805 --> 02:33:52.909
and send all of the doctors who are old enough and have the experience to know that that wouldn't be a good place to start.

02:33:53.009 --> 02:33:59.392
Send them home and tell them that you're too old and that you shouldn't stay in the ER because, you know, you could be in danger.

02:34:00.993 --> 02:34:13.519
They offered faculty members early retirement at the start of the pandemic so that they could re-staff emergency rooms and they put residents in charge.

02:34:14.946 --> 02:34:18.227
And they had hospital administrators brief them on the response.

02:34:20.048 --> 02:34:29.672
And these people did not have the requisite experience to question the application of supplementary oxygen in response to a low pulse ox.

02:34:32.353 --> 02:34:34.734
I think wherever this was done, people were killed.

02:34:36.198 --> 02:34:40.302
and I think it was central to the murder that was necessary.

02:34:40.362 --> 02:34:42.084
It can't all be fraud.

02:34:42.444 --> 02:34:45.787
The stuff that happened in New York City can't all be fraud.

02:34:46.188 --> 02:34:52.574
There's no way to take the position that the transfection in doses that were hot didn't hurt people.

02:34:52.634 --> 02:34:57.499
There's no way to take the position that, oh, you know, I don't know anybody that was hurt by the shot.

02:34:58.817 --> 02:35:15.460
Because if you take a position like, I don't know anybody that's hurt from the shot, then you're discarding every person on the internet before and after the pandemic that claims that they were hurt by a vaccine or their child was hurt by a vaccine and the temporal correlation is too great.

02:35:17.168 --> 02:35:30.462
If you are able to make that statement on social media, say, I don't think that the current shots are necessarily hurting anyone, you are definitely not really helping us right now, because that's not a question that we need to ask.

02:35:32.093 --> 02:35:37.617
The only question we need to ask is why weren't more people hurt by the transfection?

02:35:37.657 --> 02:35:49.004
Because according to me, if they were good and the doses were there and the lipid nanoparticles were made correctly, in the best case scenario, there should be more people hurt by the shot.

02:35:50.666 --> 02:35:56.109
That's my statement that nobody else is picking up on, but that's the correlate of placebos.

02:35:56.930 --> 02:36:01.333
If you rolled out placebos to make sure that a signal would never be discernible,

02:36:02.796 --> 02:36:16.304
and at the same time rolled out somebody that was gonna exclusively use VAERS as evidence of a signal, then you could create a limited spectrum of debate where you could get people who would just say, I don't know anybody that was hurt from the shot.

02:36:16.784 --> 02:36:18.726
Oh, I know lots of people who were hurt from the shot.

02:36:19.146 --> 02:36:32.294
Well, I don't know anybody that said that the vaccine schedule was bad before the pandemic, and I know somebody who's saying that the vaccines are bad now, and she's using VAERS to show that there was no signal before the pandemic, and now there is one.

02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:44.141
And so you can have an epigirl that says that the flu vaccines did more damage than the COVID vaccines.

02:36:44.201 --> 02:36:51.549
And you can have an epigirl that says, no, no, the COVID vaccines are doing more damage than all the vaccines that came before it combined.

02:36:53.391 --> 02:36:56.555
And now you've crafted the ultimate, the ultimate

02:36:58.004 --> 02:37:14.714
limited spectrum of debate because you have a limited spectrum that's bordered on one end by one set of ridiculous proposals that the VAERS signal from COVID reveals that the COVID vaccines are worse than anything that came before it, including flu and all the childhood vaccine schedule.

02:37:15.395 --> 02:37:20.558
And then you have another EpiGirl saying that, no, no, it was fraud in New York.

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:25.841
There were no bodies in New York and I don't think anybody's dying from the shot now.

02:37:31.004 --> 02:37:34.766
And so if you have somebody who says, no, no, no, no, we invented the mRNA.

02:37:34.826 --> 02:37:35.647
It works great.

02:37:35.807 --> 02:37:37.788
And Peter Cullis told us it works great.

02:37:38.108 --> 02:37:42.330
And then you have someone else over here saying, no, no, no, it's the lipid nanoparticle.

02:37:42.370 --> 02:37:43.031
It's terrible.

02:37:43.411 --> 02:37:46.353
And it was an incapacitating agent and they always knew it.

02:37:47.313 --> 02:37:49.775
Nah, none of these doses were any good.

02:37:49.795 --> 02:37:51.035
It was just a toxin.

02:37:52.176 --> 02:37:58.920
Then you have another set of epigirls that argues about two ends of a spectrum that don't usefully question the

02:38:00.287 --> 02:38:03.028
presumptions of all of those limited spectrums.

02:38:03.048 --> 02:38:17.411
They're all based on the same lie of a novel virus that's circulating around, that's causing a strange situation and strange behavior and strange set of symptoms that strangely we have no way of treating.

02:38:17.491 --> 02:38:25.073
So we just have to say supportive care and hope that your viral syndrome passes like another one.

02:38:28.874 --> 02:38:29.275
about this.

02:38:29.455 --> 02:38:30.396
People are dying.

02:38:30.716 --> 02:38:31.337
They are dying.

02:38:31.377 --> 02:38:35.682
What we would like to figure out as quickly as possible is what is the way to reduce that.

02:38:35.702 --> 02:38:36.383
Oh my gosh.

02:38:36.443 --> 02:38:45.494
My son went on a trip with his friend to go stay somewhere and go to water slides and stuff like that.

02:38:46.425 --> 02:38:49.228
And he texts me to say, we didn't get a hotel.

02:38:49.288 --> 02:38:53.031
We got an Airbnb with a hot tub and a heated pool.

02:38:53.812 --> 02:38:55.553
Holy ships.

02:38:55.713 --> 02:38:56.995
Am I, am I not?

02:38:57.155 --> 02:38:57.755
I am missing.

02:38:57.775 --> 02:38:58.456
I am not.

02:38:59.697 --> 02:39:02.540
My sons are having a good time for the next couple of days.

02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:03.380
That's pretty fun.

02:39:03.561 --> 02:39:04.501
I'm very excited.

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:04.902
Wow.

02:39:05.819 --> 02:39:06.980
Congratulations, boys.

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:07.600
That number.

02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:10.342
And I also think we overfocus on death.

02:39:10.482 --> 02:39:14.485
The amount of damage that people are suffering who get sick and recover is immense, too.

02:39:14.505 --> 02:39:16.006
Those people will lose years of their lives.

02:39:16.026 --> 02:39:16.846
No question.

02:39:16.866 --> 02:39:19.788
So, you know, the question really is, how do we minimize those?

02:39:19.948 --> 02:39:22.470
Those people will use lose years of their lives.

02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:23.811
What is he talking about there?

02:39:23.871 --> 02:39:24.551
Well, I got off.

02:39:24.851 --> 02:39:25.752
I got really far.

02:39:25.832 --> 02:39:26.012
Whoa.

02:39:26.252 --> 02:39:30.536
this drug is absolutely, it's immense.

02:39:30.636 --> 02:39:31.978
So this drug is ivermectin.

02:39:32.358 --> 02:39:34.540
The point is, look, let's be adults about this.

02:39:34.721 --> 02:39:35.641
People are dying.

02:39:35.982 --> 02:39:36.582
They are dying.

02:39:36.642 --> 02:39:41.307
What we would like to figure out as quickly as possible is what is the way to reduce that number.

02:39:41.788 --> 02:39:44.050
And I also think we overfocus on death.

02:39:44.170 --> 02:39:48.174
The amount of damage that people are suffering who get sick and recover is immense too.

02:39:48.214 --> 02:39:49.696
Those people will lose years of their lives.

02:39:50.316 --> 02:39:54.882
So the question really is, how do we minimize the net harm of this disease?

02:39:54.942 --> 02:39:59.907
And the answer is, there is no way to do it without some people dying as we figure out, as we get our bearings.

02:39:59.968 --> 02:40:00.708
There's no way to do it.

02:40:00.768 --> 02:40:01.229
I agree.

02:40:01.249 --> 02:40:10.220
And Umberto Maduro talks about this a lot, is that we are just demoralized at the lack of really emergency thinking, which is a risk-benefit analysis.

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:13.041
Everything I do at the bedside of a patient is a risk-benefit.

02:40:13.541 --> 02:40:18.042
Anytime I prescribe a medicine, it's because I believe that the chances of benefit are greater than the harm.

02:40:18.122 --> 02:40:20.482
And you can do that on any amounts of evidence.

02:40:20.502 --> 02:40:22.583
You can do it on unassailable mountains of evidence.

02:40:22.603 --> 02:40:24.103
You could also do it on little evidence.

02:40:24.483 --> 02:40:26.724
I thought Brett was about to drink out of a candle.

02:40:27.504 --> 02:40:28.904
You're going to make a risk-benefit ratio.

02:40:28.924 --> 02:40:34.845
And the idea that we're not going to use a really safe drug, which has nothing, every study shows nothing but benefit.

02:40:35.045 --> 02:40:35.286
OK.

02:40:35.866 --> 02:40:37.006
And why we're not employing it.

02:40:37.626 --> 02:40:39.108
Well, this is the impossible question.

02:40:39.148 --> 02:40:44.937
And I will say, when I started to detect the message that you guys were sending out, I was cautious about it, right?

02:40:44.957 --> 02:40:48.222
I looked at this and I thought, Whoa, fair, you know, be cautious.

02:40:48.282 --> 02:40:50.746
There's a there's a drug, it has positive effects.

02:40:51.146 --> 02:40:52.809
Why am I not seeing it discussed more?

02:40:53.389 --> 02:41:08.064
And then as I went deeper into the evidence, and as you all generated more evidence and put it into the world, and as the natural experiments that are in the world revealed themselves and showed the very same pattern, it became clear that this was actually taken in the aggregate.

02:41:08.564 --> 02:41:28.717
the amount of evidence is incredible right this is a very clear signal it'd be hard to miss it unless that was your purpose unless you had some confusion or reason not to want to know and then actually ivermectin and water is safer than water because the ivermectin will kill all the parasites in the water so i mean mark you're totally spot on but not quite

02:41:28.877 --> 02:41:43.006
And if you extrapolate from that, you get into some very strange territory about why, in light of this tool that is apparently at our disposal, safe, highly effective, not only highly effective at treating these patients, but preventing people from coming down with COVID.

02:41:43.306 --> 02:41:46.108
What would it mean if we had that at our disposal and didn't use it?

02:41:46.528 --> 02:41:48.950
So, let's talk a little bit about the evidence.

02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:50.311
What is ivermectin?

02:41:50.411 --> 02:41:54.494
So, ivermectin, right, it's one of the most common medicines in the world.

02:41:54.554 --> 02:41:56.235
It actually works against parasites, right?

02:41:56.255 --> 02:41:59.718
So, worms, different parasitic diseases that affect humans and animals.

02:41:59.738 --> 02:42:07.764
So, it's very... Given once annually to people with unclean water.

02:42:08.404 --> 02:42:12.828
Given once annually to people that live in third world countries.

02:42:14.471 --> 02:42:14.711
Right?

02:42:14.932 --> 02:42:15.873
Once annually.

02:42:15.973 --> 02:42:33.131
So, you know, if somebody told you that you could take this poison at a low dose once annually and it might help you, that's a little different than saying that you can use it prophylactically at a different dose on a daily basis to prevent a respiratory disease indefinitely, which is what these guys are about to say.

02:42:33.972 --> 02:42:35.193
Common medicine given to animals?

02:42:36.334 --> 02:42:41.857
And also one that- Common animal medicine indeed, but how often is it given and at what dose?

02:42:41.937 --> 02:42:45.918
Again, this is not being precise, but precisely the opposite.

02:42:47.159 --> 02:42:51.921
Nobel prize because it essentially transformed the health status of huge portions of the globe.

02:42:52.261 --> 02:43:02.926
So there's a- Not by regular application, but by annual application and not by large doses, but you know, we've got to be precise here and we are not being precise.

02:43:03.006 --> 02:43:04.607
Instead- Stop lying!

02:43:05.632 --> 02:43:13.738
lot of continents where parasitic diseases were endemic and I mean absolutely were decimated the health status of really low and middle income countries.

02:43:14.299 --> 02:43:17.381
One of them is a disease called onchocerciasis or river blindness.

02:43:17.401 --> 02:43:25.067
It literally causes blindness and there were some populations in Africa, some societies where I think it's like 50% of the men by the time of age 40 were blind.

02:43:25.367 --> 02:43:29.370
So you had like villages where like all the people were blind and here comes ivermectin

02:43:29.810 --> 02:43:33.751
It's known to be this really effective, and it basically eradicated the disease.

02:43:34.131 --> 02:43:37.112
And so it's been used now for 40 years, 4 billion doses.

02:43:37.752 --> 02:43:42.454
The WHO has administered mass distribution programs to many of those areas.

02:43:42.514 --> 02:43:48.195
And so for that reason, it's one of the greatest feats of a medicine in history.

02:43:49.196 --> 02:43:51.416
Maybe on the part, maybe not as big as penicillin.

02:43:51.436 --> 02:43:53.097
That's one of the biggest discoveries.

02:43:53.937 --> 02:43:55.598
literally, it's on that shelf, right?

02:43:55.638 --> 02:44:01.122
And that's just the persons or persons or organization that put it on that shelf is the who.

02:44:02.003 --> 02:44:06.546
So he's essentially not telling you that all doctors around the world agree.

02:44:07.427 --> 02:44:10.489
He's not telling you that all doctors in America agree.

02:44:10.949 --> 02:44:15.432
He's not telling you that the consensus in Western medicine is that this thing is badass.

02:44:15.973 --> 02:44:17.194
What is he saying here?

02:44:18.014 --> 02:44:18.895
Please hear it.

02:44:21.035 --> 02:44:27.102
He's saying that the who says this is on the list of essential medicines, of the who.

02:44:28.884 --> 02:44:36.413
The same people who are now telling us that we need to fight the who, we're using the who as an argument for ivermectin.

02:44:41.175 --> 02:44:42.036
I hope you can see it.

02:44:42.376 --> 02:44:43.537
Parasites, right?

02:44:43.797 --> 02:44:47.400
So as I understand the story, it's discovered in the early 70s.

02:44:48.141 --> 02:44:49.822
So the first discovery was identified in like 70, 75.

02:44:49.982 --> 02:44:56.067
By Satoshi Nomura, a Japanese scientist.

02:44:56.127 --> 02:44:58.589
Not to be confused with the guy who invented Bitcoin.

02:44:58.909 --> 02:44:59.829
A scientist, biologist, yeah.

02:44:59.849 --> 02:45:03.470
And he discovered it in, it was produced in the soil by bacteria, I think?

02:45:03.490 --> 02:45:10.431
So he was, yeah, what he was doing, his expertise was looking at substances made by microorganisms, sort of like penicillin, right?

02:45:10.831 --> 02:45:14.192
And what their effects were as a medicine against other organisms, right?

02:45:14.212 --> 02:45:16.872
Because many organisms make substances to ward off other organisms.

02:45:16.932 --> 02:45:23.273
And so he would take organisms from the soil and look at the substance they created and then test them as medicine.

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:24.154
That was his expertise.

02:45:24.654 --> 02:45:26.754
And what's so fascinating about ivermectin is that-

02:45:26.834 --> 02:45:29.958
It's too bad they didn't use the domain server to look at all those things.

02:45:30.038 --> 02:45:31.760
It might not have taken them so many years.

02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:38.989
They could have just simulated the interaction with different viral proteins and discovered the stuff in the soil a lot quicker.

02:45:40.347 --> 02:45:43.549
He found the microorganism near a golf course outside of Tokyo.

02:45:44.310 --> 02:45:47.192
And it's an organism called Streptomyces.

02:45:47.512 --> 02:45:50.694
And so it made this substance, which is actually called avirumectin.

02:45:51.414 --> 02:45:58.759
But to this day, that microorganism in Japan is still the only place you can find.

02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:03.863
Now it's obviously produced everywhere, but the source is still in the soil in Japan.

02:46:03.903 --> 02:46:05.744
It's never been found from any other sources.

02:46:06.024 --> 02:46:20.198
Just an anecdote here, Vincent Ransom Yellow's wife actually worked for the company that owned the patent on ivermectin and worked on that particular substance for its entire presence at Merck.

02:46:21.317 --> 02:46:22.498
just in case you care.

02:46:22.518 --> 02:46:25.500
So it's really, really wild, his discovery.

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:26.821
And so that's cool.

02:46:26.941 --> 02:46:27.301
That's cool.

02:46:27.462 --> 02:46:38.630
So I must say, as an evolutionary biologist, this also strikes a chord because I am much more concerned about a totally novel molecule that we have created in a laboratory.

02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:45.695
And the reason I'm more concerned about it is that there's every possibility when you create something in the laboratory that our ancestors will never have encountered anything like it.

02:46:45.735 --> 02:46:47.897
And therefore, our bodies may not know what to do with it.

02:46:48.177 --> 02:46:49.558
But a natural molecule,

02:46:49.758 --> 02:46:53.180
Can anybody give me a link for Dr. Shiva's cytosol?

02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:54.440
That would be fun.

02:46:56.001 --> 02:47:08.587
Is something you can't, you know, obviously if it's endemic to Japan, most of our ancestors probably never encountered the exact molecule, but the chances that they have encountered many molecules like it and therefore will be able to process it in some reasonable way is very, very high, right?

02:47:08.788 --> 02:47:09.568
Wow.

02:47:09.728 --> 02:47:13.450
So this is an interesting tangent of questions that don't need to be answered.

02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:15.091
He's suggesting that although

02:47:15.891 --> 02:47:25.214
this organism is unique to Japan, we've been exposed to other organisms and probably related toxins and so we don't need to be afraid of the ant poison.

02:47:28.715 --> 02:47:31.476
Wow, what an interesting statement to make.

02:47:31.516 --> 02:47:43.760
Why would they give a Nobel Prize to somebody who discovered something that they claim is found nowhere else and a single organism found nowhere else if it's actually all kinds of related compounds are found in soils all around the world?

02:47:44.696 --> 02:48:02.201
What an interesting thing for Bret Weinstein to say, which seems to only really make a mealy-mouthed argument for why nobody should be afraid of taking ivermectin, because there's probably all kinds of different kinds of ivermectin in every soil all around the world, that even though this one's native to Japan, we're exposed to all of these!

02:48:03.161 --> 02:48:04.541
Stop lying!

02:48:04.862 --> 02:48:06.122
Holy shit!

02:48:08.325 --> 02:48:09.426
not to know what to do with it.

02:48:09.686 --> 02:48:25.034
But a natural molecule is something you can't, you know, obviously, if it's endemic to Japan, most of our ancestors probably never encountered the exact molecule, but the chances that they have encountered many molecules like it, and therefore will be able to process it in some reasonable way is very, very high, right?

02:48:25.494 --> 02:48:27.695
Unlike something like Tylenol, for example.

02:48:27.875 --> 02:48:28.376
I like that.

02:48:29.255 --> 02:48:29.795
I like that.

02:48:30.276 --> 02:48:34.758
Whereas if you've never encountered Tylenol, some people could have a very bad reaction to it.

02:48:35.179 --> 02:48:44.044
But because everybody's run into Ivermectin or its related components, in theory, because I'm an evolutionary biologist, I have the right to say stupid shit like this.

02:48:44.464 --> 02:48:46.825
In theory, it could be in all the soils.

02:48:46.885 --> 02:48:55.150
And so unlike Tylenol, that everybody could in theory have a bad reaction to, it's highly unlikely with this soil substance because it's found everywhere.

02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:57.452
And I'm an evolutionary biologist, so trust me.

02:48:58.072 --> 02:48:59.412
Holy shitballs.

02:48:59.613 --> 02:49:00.833
Can you get this book down there while you can?

02:49:00.853 --> 02:49:01.053
Thank you.

02:49:01.073 --> 02:49:04.254
Well, yeah, because really that was in recognition not only of the discovery but really the impacts on global health.

02:49:04.294 --> 02:49:05.555
And the WHO, that's like some of the hidden

02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:25.042
heyday of the WHO is their early work on some of those diseases.

02:49:26.343 --> 02:49:28.584
But the story goes on, right?

02:49:28.684 --> 02:49:30.625
Oh, Pamela, you're so sharp.

02:49:30.645 --> 02:49:32.026
You see why we love Pamela?

02:49:32.386 --> 02:49:44.914
Pamela sees even better in the sense of implying that ivermectin and its related soil bacteria producing stuff in North America and elsewhere

02:49:45.534 --> 02:49:51.140
means that everybody's seen some form of ivermectin before, so you're much more likely to be able to deal with it.

02:49:51.660 --> 02:50:02.711
There's a subtle little subconscious component of that that suggests that if it's a lab leak and he's right about it, then this could be a noveler virus than we've ever seen before.

02:50:03.191 --> 02:50:07.015
More novel than ever and more novel could mean, oh my goodness.

02:50:09.557 --> 02:50:10.298
Thanks, Pamela.

02:50:11.601 --> 02:50:20.185
I don't know how many times I can say thank you to you, but I definitely am saying thank you directly to you today for everything that you've done for my family.

02:50:20.245 --> 02:50:20.705
Thank you.

02:50:23.767 --> 02:50:28.049
2012, the first study started coming out of labs in virus models.

02:50:28.129 --> 02:50:30.630
So they started looking at cell culture models in labs.

02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:36.193
They showed that ivermectin was like working against Zika and dengue and West Nile and influenza.

02:50:36.233 --> 02:50:37.373
Like it was showing.

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:39.474
It fixes everything.

02:50:41.053 --> 02:50:51.585
Oh my gosh, it's Ebola and Zika and every major biosecurity threat we've encountered with Robert Malone since his career started.

02:50:53.488 --> 02:50:55.591
But the story goes on, right?

02:50:55.611 --> 02:51:00.516
So around 2012, the first studies started coming out of labs in virus models.

02:51:00.616 --> 02:51:03.099
So they started looking at cell culture models in labs.

02:51:03.119 --> 02:51:09.686
They showed that ivermectin was like working against Zika, and dengue, and West Nile, and influenza, like it was shown.

02:51:09.726 --> 02:51:11.908
Can we, I've never seen those papers.

02:51:12.569 --> 02:51:20.612
We need to verify whether those papers exist and who wrote them because that's pretty amazing going antiviral properties Malone said it was awesome for Zika.

02:51:20.712 --> 02:51:22.172
Okay, you see I don't know.

02:51:22.192 --> 02:51:26.174
I don't know everything that's for damn sure There's just too much shit to remember.

02:51:26.234 --> 02:51:26.454
I mean

02:51:27.293 --> 02:51:28.374
And half of it's lies.

02:51:28.874 --> 02:51:31.056
You've got to keep track of those, too.

02:51:31.136 --> 02:51:32.036
So it's like a lot.

02:51:32.096 --> 02:51:32.997
But thanks, Mark.

02:51:34.558 --> 02:51:35.099
As usual.

02:51:35.599 --> 02:51:36.459
An experiment.

02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:39.422
So here you have this phenomenal anti-parasite drug.

02:51:39.782 --> 02:51:43.204
And now it's showing that it has efficacy against viruses.

02:51:43.244 --> 02:51:46.547
And so that's where the antiviral story, which is, I think,

02:51:47.367 --> 02:51:53.512
Again, we're going to talk about it in terms of COVID, but I actually think I'm so... Go back to the hopeful part.

02:51:53.592 --> 02:51:57.736
I am so interested in the future of this drug against other viruses as well.

02:51:57.976 --> 02:52:00.678
Can I just say something completely different about flat tires?

02:52:00.718 --> 02:52:03.440
Have I told you the story about flat tires that happened to me?

02:52:03.961 --> 02:52:11.347
I used to have bike flat tires all the time, and I found this stuff, which I can't show you now because I can't unplug.

02:52:12.047 --> 02:52:13.688
It's like this gel.

02:52:14.673 --> 02:52:25.736
that you squirt inside of a tire that you never want to inflate again and it just flows around in there with these little particles of rubber and other shit and when you get a puncture

02:52:27.077 --> 02:52:50.579
that stuff as the wheel rolls it flows into the hole and punctures plugs it for good and then you can reinflate the tire and it's good and so i had a flat tire on my electric wheel and in order to change the electric wheel tire you have to take the whole damn thing apart like it's a disaster and so i decided i'm just going to try this stuff and see if it works so i squirted it in the tire

02:52:51.460 --> 02:52:55.684
I rolled it around and I inflated the tire and that tire is solid as a rock.

02:52:56.244 --> 02:53:06.774
And supposedly according to this stuff, even if you get another puncture you can pull out the blade and roll it around and then reinflate it and roll it around again and it'll repair itself.

02:53:06.874 --> 02:53:14.701
It will self-heal for years to come because whatever's in there is like silicon or something and so it doesn't dry out.

02:53:15.862 --> 02:53:17.143
This product is cheap.

02:53:18.115 --> 02:53:26.459
And you can put it in like bike tires and wheelbarrow tires and lawnmower tires and four-wheeler tires.

02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:33.463
And when they get punctured, you can run a little bit and then you can pump them back up and you can drive home.

02:53:33.543 --> 02:53:35.164
And probably you can use them forever.

02:53:35.544 --> 02:53:36.444
It's freaking cool.

02:53:37.685 --> 02:53:41.407
And so anyway, it works a lot better than ivermectin on flat tires.

02:53:41.647 --> 02:53:43.788
Before we get to that, we should talk about COVID.

02:53:43.828 --> 02:53:46.770
But yeah, you know, well, but I think this fits beautifully.

02:53:46.810 --> 02:53:56.995
So it's not like this was, you know, when I heard that ivermectin had some utility, and then I looked into the the evidence for it, my assumption was that people were just throwing random molecules to see what stuck.

02:53:57.095 --> 02:53:57.495
And so I

02:53:57.935 --> 02:54:13.312
throwing random molecules and see what's stuck nobody does that why would they need to do that when in the beginning of february or late january a volunteer team led by ditra commander or ditra colonel uh robert malone

02:54:14.393 --> 02:54:42.791
used the domain program server, AI, whatever it was, top secret technology to interface an X-ray crystallography model of the 3CL protease with all known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog to identify ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and remdesivir as the four likely candidates that would provide relief from

02:54:43.391 --> 02:54:48.716
this novel virus from the the catalog of stuff that we had already approved?

02:54:50.478 --> 02:54:59.687
Why would we need to throw random stuff at it if we had technology like the domain server already spitting out answers and ivermectin was one of them?

02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:06.194
Are they going to acknowledge that ivermectin was identified by the domain server?

02:55:09.181 --> 02:55:10.162
I haven't heard it yet.

02:55:10.362 --> 02:55:14.685
That is a more tenuous connection than, actually, this does have broad antiviral effects.

02:55:14.705 --> 02:55:16.006
Ten years of experiments.

02:55:16.086 --> 02:55:17.987
There just haven't been clinical trials of it, right?

02:55:18.027 --> 02:55:18.227
Right.

02:55:18.468 --> 02:55:30.136
And then, you know, the story with COVID is that a group in Australia published a study, I think it was late April of 2020, showing that in their cell culture model, it basically eradicated all viral material within 40 days.

02:55:30.236 --> 02:55:35.158
Wow, in their cell culture model in Australia, it eradicates all viral material.

02:55:35.218 --> 02:55:45.602
I wonder if he's talking about proteins or RNA because he told us earlier in this lecture that it's the RNA and the scraps of RNA that caused the macrophages to go ape shit.

02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:54.553
This is the beginning of the end, ladies and gentlemen.

02:55:54.573 --> 02:55:55.735
This is the landslide.

02:55:55.815 --> 02:56:03.726
Today, Pierre-Corey, you have been chosen to be exposed and it is the start of something wonderful.

02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:06.429
And so it showed this phenomenal efficacy.

02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:08.271
in the petri dish, right?

02:56:08.351 --> 02:56:09.131
In the lab, right?

02:56:09.151 --> 02:56:14.975
And so I always say, you know, very few, and you're going to know this too, very few molecules make it from the bench to the bedside, right?

02:56:14.995 --> 02:56:16.796
There's a whole bunch of stuff that has to happen, right?

02:56:17.016 --> 02:56:18.937
You know, the concentrations have to be appropriate.

02:56:19.178 --> 02:56:22.019
The safety has, and then it has to work in a human model, right?

02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:28.604
Here's something that nobody has managed to articulate that I'm going to articulate right now that I've kind of been saving for

02:56:29.324 --> 02:56:32.365
deep in a stream because nobody can watch three hours.

02:56:32.446 --> 02:56:36.007
I mean everybody complains about how hard it is to watch three hours of the truth.

02:56:36.567 --> 02:56:39.949
So Jay's wasting his time when he does these three-hour things.

02:56:39.989 --> 02:56:45.792
It'd be great if he could do 10-minute stuff to summarize this Lollapalooza of liars more simply.

02:56:47.421 --> 02:56:48.982
I want you to think about something here.

02:56:49.502 --> 02:56:51.183
The story of viruses.

02:56:51.263 --> 02:56:57.868
Let's talk about the story of viruses and let's do... This is trying very hard to make a clip for Jeff.

02:56:58.368 --> 02:57:04.112
Jeff from Earth is a friend of mine from Canada who has a Instagram account where he puts all these clips.

02:57:04.532 --> 02:57:13.578
This is a clip for Jeff and so we're just gonna kinda... For the last... I'll start it again.

02:57:14.638 --> 02:57:15.639
So here's where the clip starts.

02:57:16.775 --> 02:57:23.798
So we've been watching Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory talk about our best understanding of the biology of the pandemic.

02:57:23.818 --> 02:57:27.740
And this video is from June of 2021.

02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:36.904
And interestingly, there are a lot of details that they get wrong about the basic cartoon virology that we have come to understand as a result of the mainstream media.

02:57:37.404 --> 02:57:59.381
and social media united presentation of this mythology around RNA viruses that I tend to try and summarily dismiss by simply saying that RNA cannot pandemic and any virologist, biologist, molecular biologist worth their salt could explain very easily why that's not possible even if there is a fear and cleavage site or two

02:57:59.941 --> 02:58:03.023
that is inserted into this very special RNA molecule.

02:58:03.424 --> 02:58:11.590
One of the really interesting things about ivermectin is that nobody is really offering up a mechanism by which it stops viral replication.

02:58:11.650 --> 02:58:17.394
And in fact, the only person who's ever offered a hint of a mechanism has been Robert Malone.

02:58:17.814 --> 02:58:23.479
The guy who, at the beginning of his coming out party, was very adamant in declaring himself

02:58:24.099 --> 02:58:38.621
a collaborator with DITRA and a we are the DOD kind of statement and claiming that he spun up a team on advice and phone call from Mike Callahan and that team he spun up used

02:58:39.582 --> 02:58:54.136
volunteer work to identify four compounds using a top secret DITRA program called DOMAIN to scan all of the drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog to identify, among others, ivermectin.

02:58:54.736 --> 02:59:14.694
Now, interestingly, according to Robert Malone, they were all identified as drugs that would interact with the 3Cl protease, which is supposedly the enzyme, one of the 31 proteins or so encoded by the viral genome, which is responsible for the replication of the virus or of the genome or of something.

02:59:14.734 --> 02:59:17.817
We don't really know because they're not very specific about it.

02:59:17.937 --> 02:59:19.999
And that's the only details.

02:59:22.369 --> 02:59:27.073
Besides, the only other person that's ever tried to explain the same thing, and who was that?

02:59:28.535 --> 02:59:28.975
Do you know?

02:59:29.295 --> 02:59:30.396
It was John Campbell.

02:59:31.017 --> 02:59:43.068
And actually, John Campbell, the nurse practitioner from the UK that has seamlessly risen to 3 million subscribers on YouTube and never really been meaningfully censored,

02:59:44.423 --> 02:59:53.447
explain to us with small little cut out pieces of paper how ivermectin gets in the way of the 3Cl protease and doesn't allow it to do whatever it does.

02:59:55.968 --> 03:00:05.572
Now the interesting thing about this is that virology has never identified the proteins that are responsible for hijacking

03:00:06.673 --> 03:00:07.874
the machinery of the cell.

03:00:07.934 --> 03:00:08.954
Why is this important?

03:00:08.974 --> 03:00:11.256
Well, let me explain it to you very simply.

03:00:11.856 --> 03:00:22.742
Virology suggests that we don't make exosomes, that we don't package RNA and DNA and send it around with the intention of communicating signals.

03:00:23.362 --> 03:00:32.828
Because if we did, then that would imply that a machinery inside of our cells already exists to package RNA and DNA into signals

03:00:33.871 --> 03:00:44.856
And that would undermine the Baltimore scheme of virology, which puts all of these entities and their special enzymes outside of us.

03:00:46.926 --> 03:00:51.708
All the clever ways of using DNA and RNA in virology are outside of us.

03:00:51.788 --> 03:00:57.471
And we're limited to the DNA to RNA through a ribosome to protein.

03:00:58.232 --> 03:00:59.973
All the other tools don't belong to us.

03:01:00.053 --> 03:01:06.336
All the other tools are not utilized in our systems, but are exclusively the provenance of virology.

03:01:07.536 --> 03:01:14.780
And yet after years and years of studying these foreign invaders that have all these clever enzymes,

03:01:16.363 --> 03:01:22.944
They haven't identified any of the proteins that tell our cells to do something that they don't already do.

03:01:24.364 --> 03:01:27.725
Because according to virology, we don't make signals like this.

03:01:28.185 --> 03:01:32.406
We don't package RNA or DNA out and send it around.

03:01:33.406 --> 03:01:40.908
We take DNA and translate it to RNA and then we make protein out of that RNA and we regulate that RNA to regulate our protein.

03:01:41.268 --> 03:01:42.988
And our proteins get folded and stuff.

03:01:46.127 --> 03:01:54.031
And so somewhere in there, there must be viral proteins that make our cells do something that they don't already do, which is produce virus.

03:01:56.132 --> 03:02:12.940
And so as my wonderful chat has pointed out, if you don't have a really well understood mechanism by which the hijacking of our cellular machinery is prevented by this medicine, then you don't have anything.

03:02:14.249 --> 03:02:22.951
If you don't have a reason beyond, well, the domain server printed it out, you don't have anything.

03:02:23.871 --> 03:02:39.634
And it seems as though Pierre Cory is not even gonna claim that he has the domain server, which is an interesting omission because in a couple of weeks, Robert Malone is gonna be on this same podcast and also not really say it.

03:02:40.612 --> 03:02:41.233
Interesting, huh?

03:02:41.513 --> 03:02:42.674
Because we're not petri dishes.

03:02:42.734 --> 03:02:50.801
But anyway, so you get, you know, very few can make that leap and then hit the goals of safety and efficacy, right?

03:02:50.962 --> 03:02:53.444
And at an adequate concentration, right, to be effective.

03:02:53.464 --> 03:02:55.866
And so great, it worked in the lab.

03:02:56.367 --> 03:03:00.150
Now remember, that was a time where, I mean, literally the world was going insane, right?

03:03:00.190 --> 03:03:01.011
I mean, people were dying.

03:03:01.031 --> 03:03:05.395
There was so much that was going on that a couple of countries, Peru in particular,

03:03:05.475 --> 03:03:11.818
And keep in mind, girl, Catherine Organic says that lung cancers have a signature MI.

03:03:12.258 --> 03:03:21.022
It's an interfering RNA in the exosomes, in the micro RNA in the exosomes in the breath.

03:03:22.343 --> 03:03:23.584
I don't know why I'm looking at that camera.

03:03:24.124 --> 03:03:34.469
The important thing to understand is that even that story of exosomes and their shedding by cancer cells has been very carefully

03:03:35.865 --> 03:03:44.592
curated so that we still don't come to the conclusion that if cancer cells signal with exosomes, are there also exosomes that come from healthy cells?

03:03:45.112 --> 03:03:54.480
And the kind of subconscious implication by the entire cancer field, and in fact, reinforced by the rhetoric of the virology field, is that

03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:02.606
even when exosomes are present, they're a signal of pathology and not part of what would be a natural signaling regime.

03:04:02.646 --> 03:04:11.233
And so, just to keep that clear, Catherine Organic is right on the money and she's an incredibly great member of our community.

03:04:11.253 --> 03:04:14.295
I just want to clarify what she's saying a little bit there.

03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:19.101
They did the boldest move, and because of it, that was really emergency.

03:04:19.241 --> 03:04:27.023
I'm very well aware that McCullough has already pushed mRNA transfection as a cure for mRNA transfection.

03:04:27.063 --> 03:04:27.943
I'm already aware of it.

03:04:28.523 --> 03:04:31.144
I just don't really know what to do about it yet, but it's awful.

03:04:31.244 --> 03:04:32.425
Thinking emergency action.

03:04:33.105 --> 03:04:36.186
They actually, in their national health ministry, they got together.

03:04:36.226 --> 03:04:41.247
They saw what was happening on the ground in Peru, and based on a basic science lab experiment,

03:04:41.807 --> 03:04:48.629
They recommend that ivermectin to the population, which is not crazy, because as you point out, there's a lot that can go wrong between the bench and the bedside.

03:04:48.749 --> 03:04:51.689
But in this case, it wasn't like some molecule works at the bench.

03:04:51.729 --> 03:04:53.630
What the hell is going to happen when you knew it was safe?

03:04:53.650 --> 03:04:55.410
You knew it was safe because so many people had taken it.

03:04:55.430 --> 03:04:56.150
It was safe.

03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:58.211
It may not work in the human as it did in this.

03:04:58.351 --> 03:05:00.051
But you knew that you weren't going to hurt anyone.

03:05:00.111 --> 03:05:00.371
Right.

03:05:00.431 --> 03:05:00.691
Right.

03:05:00.871 --> 03:05:01.151
Right.

03:05:01.171 --> 03:05:02.032
So why not try it?

03:05:02.072 --> 03:05:03.012
And then you would imagine.

03:05:03.192 --> 03:05:08.053
I don't think that that's true, because if you were applying it in animals once a month,

03:05:09.522 --> 03:05:21.872
or you were applying it in people once every spring, it's not the same thing as now making recommendations for different dosages as a prophylactic and regular use.

03:05:24.434 --> 03:05:30.640
Again, you can sit somebody down and say, you know, you can use ayahuasca once and it might make you, you know, see things differently.

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:35.664
And you can also say, you can put ayahuasca in your water bottle every day.

03:05:36.764 --> 03:05:39.266
And those are two very different recommendations.

03:05:41.387 --> 03:05:47.572
Telling somebody that, you know, you should really try something is a little different than you should use it regularly.

03:05:49.834 --> 03:05:58.380
And these subtleties, you know, like if something works for cancer, that doesn't mean it works for healthy people.

03:05:59.120 --> 03:06:05.545
If something works for people that have bad water, it doesn't mean that it works for people that don't have bad water.

03:06:08.686 --> 03:06:15.735
And the risk-benefit ratio is not being discussed here at all because, again, they're trying to confuse you with these things.

03:06:16.916 --> 03:06:19.319
The object is to start a debate.

03:06:20.287 --> 03:06:41.132
that's gonna self-sustain itself for a couple years about ivermectin and that's why the close collaborator in that signal chat that I was trapped in, Alexandros Marinos, also spent an enormous amount of time discussing and arguing about ivermectin effectiveness at the exact same time that this bullshit was going on and nothing else.

03:06:42.330 --> 03:06:50.975
actually got really pissed when I finally tweeted out, dude, can you talk about anything else besides ivermectin?

03:06:51.395 --> 03:06:55.277
And then his reaction was, hey, who are you to tell me what to talk about?

03:06:58.779 --> 03:07:06.764
Well, I'm telling you because you don't seem to have had any principles at the start of this pandemic and still don't have any principles now, Alex.

03:07:08.049 --> 03:07:34.271
because you're part of the same group of posers that has a ridiculous amount of certainty about how good a patriot Elon Musk is, about how an absolute inability to acknowledge Palantir as a terrible force in America and around the world, an inability to acknowledge that virology has been under skepticism for many, many decades.

03:07:35.222 --> 03:07:48.009
and that the vaccine schedule has had challenges for many decades that all of us were unaware of and these people are definitely not going to come to a realization of in good time in 2021 like I did.

03:07:49.149 --> 03:07:50.130
No, no, no, no, no.

03:07:51.996 --> 03:07:53.037
the evidence would accumulate.

03:07:53.057 --> 03:08:02.984
If it works in people and it's safe enough to try it and you've got an emergency situation where you don't have another effective therapy, then okay, you give it to people, you know, it's a hail Mary, but lo and behold, the evidence accumulates.

03:08:03.004 --> 03:08:03.745
So what happened?

03:08:04.665 --> 03:08:05.506
It was very controversial.

03:08:07.356 --> 03:08:08.577
So first of all, a couple of things happened.

03:08:08.597 --> 03:08:13.481
So the way I understand in the beginning is that it was part of the national guideline, but it was really attacked.

03:08:13.541 --> 03:08:17.164
So a lot of scientists thought that was irresponsible, unproven.

03:08:17.465 --> 03:08:22.749
You know, the cry of these is this... Notice that we're not talking about hydroxychloroquine at all.

03:08:22.869 --> 03:08:29.675
So hydroxychloroquine was a scandal before ivermectin was, and we're not talking about that.

03:08:30.476 --> 03:08:36.700
being a sort of pretense for or another way to look at the response of the system.

03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:37.500
And why is that?

03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:42.583
I think that's because if you talk about hydroxychloroquine, then you've got to seed

03:08:45.299 --> 03:08:49.281
authority to Peter McCullough because Peter McCullough spoke out earlier.

03:08:49.842 --> 03:08:57.406
He spoke out about hydroxychloroquine and spoke out about the idea that the NIH can't say that it's causing swollen hearts.

03:08:57.946 --> 03:09:04.810
I've got the technician in the world that's held the most hearts and she can tell you that hydroxychloroquine isn't going to cause swollen hearts.

03:09:04.850 --> 03:09:06.731
That was a very big problem for them.

03:09:07.861 --> 03:09:13.367
Peter McCullough probably was co-opted at that stage by actual coercion.

03:09:13.867 --> 03:09:23.537
If there's anybody in the narrative that I think had a van come to his house and basically threatened him to shut up or disappear, it's Peter McCullough.

03:09:24.696 --> 03:09:33.563
And part of it is because I see a pattern of people like Pierre Cory and Robert Malone trying to get people to turn against Peter McCullough.

03:09:33.603 --> 03:09:48.335
The first time I ever heard Peter McCullough was a bad guy was when Robert Malone and Matt Crawford and a few other people decided to tell me that the wellness company is bad and the people that take money from the wellness company are bad.

03:09:49.196 --> 03:10:13.150
I didn't know who the wellness company was until Robert Malone and Mark Kulak, sorry, not Mark Kulak, sorry, Robert Malone and Matt Crawford and Liam Sturgis and probably a few other people that I could name insisted that the wellness company was worth looking at.

03:10:14.659 --> 03:10:22.061
And there are a lot of other people that have insisted that the wellness company is worth blogging about, worth arguing about, worth being present in the chat about.

03:10:24.221 --> 03:10:37.445
And essentially, when I first heard of the wellness company, it was at the inaugural CHD conference where I met Jill and Robert and Bobby and Pierre Corey and Ryan Cole.

03:10:37.485 --> 03:10:38.965
I met them all in the same place.

03:10:40.126 --> 03:11:00.762
as well as seeing Rixie for the second time in person, as well as meeting Matt Crawford for the first time in person, all at the inaugural CHD meeting, where Matt Crawford didn't register, but got permission to register late on the day of the conference because Meryl Nass spoke for him.

03:11:03.624 --> 03:11:07.988
Again, you know, it's just inconvenient truths that I can't forget because they actually happened to me.

03:11:09.554 --> 03:11:12.535
because those people actually told me those stories.

03:11:14.536 --> 03:11:24.779
And then I pass those stories on to people in CHD and vouched for Matt Crawford needing a ticket because Merrill Nass vouches for him.

03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:34.843
And then at that meeting is when Matt Crawford said that, you know, did you know that the wellness company is paying people like Peter McCullough and that maybe Peter McCullough is a bad guy.

03:11:35.953 --> 03:11:42.479
The same conference where Matt Crawford had dinner with, or lunch with Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone.

03:11:43.159 --> 03:11:52.687
Even though they supposedly don't really know each other, they first met at the inaugural international COVID summit, wherever it was in San Paolo or somewhere like that.

03:11:53.368 --> 03:11:54.489
That's where they first met.

03:11:56.531 --> 03:11:57.872
How is that even possible?

03:12:04.502 --> 03:12:12.405
Don't forget that the story with Matt Crawford, I think, is something like his family was military intelligence and him and his brother were in a rape cult.

03:12:13.125 --> 03:12:23.769
And because Matt Crawford was triggered by something said in a private phone call by somebody that I know, that I was supposed to drop somebody that I know and trust.

03:12:24.289 --> 03:12:30.351
And because I didn't do that, now Matt Crawford in his Bitcoin secret chat has been consistently

03:12:31.071 --> 03:12:49.388
um slandering and lying about me and lying about all the ways that he tried to help my family stop lying and keeps kept contacting me for months even though i kept saying in the chat please stop contacting me leave me alone i don't believe you you're a liar

03:12:52.622 --> 03:12:53.723
They're all liars.

03:12:53.803 --> 03:12:56.326
They have all coordinatedly worked together.

03:12:56.486 --> 03:13:14.243
And Matt Crawford worked together with Brett Weinstein for longer than almost any of these people because he was in that original Signal chat and then pretended to get in a fight with Alexandros Marinos so that I would leave that chat angry after Brett Weinstein said he didn't need to listen to me in a Zoom meeting.

03:13:14.583 --> 03:13:16.926
And then I would go to Matt Crawford and say, what are we going to do?

03:13:18.069 --> 03:13:20.171
And then Matt Crawford would say, let's start a business.

03:13:20.231 --> 03:13:21.572
Let's make a curriculum.

03:13:22.092 --> 03:13:32.601
Let's sell shares in properties and in collectibles that we'll store at airports to people with Bitcoin.

03:13:34.673 --> 03:13:42.436
That's a real proposal that was supposedly meant to save my family, proposed by Matt Crawford, the rounding the earth guy.

03:13:43.017 --> 03:13:53.021
We were gonna have like, you know, valuable stuff like baseball cards and gold stored in airport lockers that we would then sell to people with Bitcoin who had nothing better to do with their money.

03:13:54.322 --> 03:14:04.046
That was a real proposal that he claims in his Bitcoin forum, even though he doesn't give you any details, is one of many businesses that he tried to start with Jay to try and help him.

03:14:09.005 --> 03:14:10.946
That's why they're all up on the wall over there.

03:14:17.208 --> 03:14:21.590
I'm never gonna forget any of this, because it actually happened to me.

03:14:22.771 --> 03:14:27.593
Because I have it all written down in notebooks, because I have all the screenshots from all these fakers.

03:14:29.173 --> 03:14:34.616
Anybody wants to write a book with me that will have all of these screenshots in it,

03:14:35.618 --> 03:14:48.608
Anybody that wants to fund the actual history of the pandemic and how the lie was constructed, Mark and I could write a hell of a book, and we wouldn't need that much money and that much time.

03:14:48.688 --> 03:14:51.710
You know, if you gave us a year's salary, we could get it done.

03:14:53.512 --> 03:14:54.412
Nobody's gonna do it.

03:14:56.114 --> 03:15:01.398
Not one book publisher in the world is free to do it.

03:15:02.899 --> 03:15:04.120
Because the books right here

03:15:06.169 --> 03:15:07.811
All the stuff is right there.

03:15:07.831 --> 03:15:12.257
I got four different hard drives with it on there and there are other places too.

03:15:13.078 --> 03:15:14.380
It can't go away anymore.

03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:18.446
It's just a question of when somebody wants to make a million bucks selling that book.

03:15:20.526 --> 03:15:23.348
It'll certainly outsell the Ivermectin book of this clown.

03:15:24.048 --> 03:15:27.510
Insufficient evidence that I always hear, and that actually probably applied back then.

03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:32.653
There was really not sufficient evidence, but you could say on a risk-benefit ratio, it's reasonable.

03:15:32.674 --> 03:15:36.156
But anyway, it was very controversial, and so it wasn't widely adopted.

03:15:36.196 --> 03:15:42.199
I think a lot of people didn't agree with that, and fairly soon after that, after a lot of discussion, they removed it from the national guidelines.

03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:48.323
Many states did adopt it and began to distribute ivermectin in Peru.

03:15:48.863 --> 03:15:59.569
And what you saw in those states, every time they began a campaign, they began it at different times across the summer, spring and summer, every time it was followed by precipitous declines in case counts and deaths.

03:15:59.769 --> 03:16:03.211
And really the excess deaths were plummeting in all these regions in Peru.

03:16:04.031 --> 03:16:10.164
But what's interesting so that what I think is a landmark paper and probably the one of the most important people in this story besides Paul Marek, right?

03:16:10.185 --> 03:16:11.608
So going back to that, here we go.

03:16:11.668 --> 03:16:12.750
Where are we going to go here?

03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:13.451
Where are we going to go?

03:16:15.131 --> 03:16:22.335
My call is we're going to go to DDA Royal in France, and he's going to say that this guy was doing early treatment with hydroxychloroquine.

03:16:22.355 --> 03:16:27.097
That's my guess, because you wouldn't want to go to Zev Zelenko, right?

03:16:27.117 --> 03:16:30.279
We don't want to promote any American patriots, so we got to go to France.

03:16:30.339 --> 03:16:31.059
That's my guess.

03:16:31.359 --> 03:16:38.703
Identification, right, of the evidence is, you know, when we talk about pattern recognition, it's really Paul who identified that there was something happening around Ivory.

03:16:38.843 --> 03:16:39.023
Wow.

03:16:39.783 --> 03:16:40.904
Paul Merrick again.

03:16:41.145 --> 03:16:42.245
Paul, Paul, Paul.

03:16:42.326 --> 03:16:43.607
Paul is the guy.

03:16:43.687 --> 03:16:48.751
Paul is the man that Pierre Cori is stepping in front of.

03:16:48.951 --> 03:16:49.191
Paul.

03:16:50.097 --> 03:16:53.799
Paul Ivermectin, he noticed this pattern based on just a few studies.

03:16:54.339 --> 03:16:56.880
He saw the magnitudes and what it was showing.

03:16:57.260 --> 03:16:59.481
And he said, I think this is something.

03:16:59.501 --> 03:17:01.662
Because we've been studying all of the trials on everything.

03:17:02.102 --> 03:17:03.023
So many were failing.

03:17:03.083 --> 03:17:05.464
So many were conflicting, unsatisfying.

03:17:05.724 --> 03:17:06.885
But here comes Ivermectin.

03:17:06.945 --> 03:17:09.626
And the signal around Ivermectin was really astonishing.

03:17:09.646 --> 03:17:14.008
And even the lead researcher for Unitaid and WHO, he found it remarkable too.

03:17:14.488 --> 03:17:16.869
There was a team that was looking at repurposed drugs since last June.

03:17:17.169 --> 03:17:18.670
They were on their seventh molecule.

03:17:19.210 --> 03:17:23.812
and he had heard about Ivan, I think it was because of our advocacy, and suddenly that's all.

03:17:23.892 --> 03:17:33.016
I don't know if Zev Zelenko was a PSYOP, but I know for sure there's a video of Zev Zelenko saying that it is an abomination to have transfected children.

03:17:34.062 --> 03:17:43.687
He used like the worst word in Hebrew to describe the desecration of children and equated that to what they were doing with the shots.

03:17:43.807 --> 03:17:50.751
And so if he was a PSYOP, it's also possible, of course, that Zev was extremely manipulated.

03:17:52.352 --> 03:17:57.715
Because remember, everybody very early on that was fighting for this had to be extremely manipulated or killed.

03:18:00.461 --> 03:18:07.203
So if Zeb was a PSYOP, it doesn't necessarily mean because he chose to be, but because he was so efficiently meddled with.

03:18:07.583 --> 03:18:12.585
You can honestly, seriously, I want you to understand how I see it, okay?

03:18:14.245 --> 03:18:16.846
I'm gonna say something very serious when I say this.

03:18:21.968 --> 03:18:24.549
And I am being very serious when I say this.

03:18:24.589 --> 03:18:28.170
The reason why I have this link right here, Scooby,

03:18:29.594 --> 03:18:37.734
is because I think I was so efficiently manipulated by people like Brett Weinstein that I wrote a review that is mostly bullshit.

03:18:38.948 --> 03:18:49.093
I wrote a review that doesn't usefully challenge the existence of a novel pathogen, doesn't usefully challenge the abomination of transfecting healthy people.

03:18:49.153 --> 03:18:55.776
It doesn't usefully challenge the ridiculousness of using transfection to augment the immune system.

03:18:55.796 --> 03:19:02.380
It almost gave them everything they wanted and that's why Asim Malhotra, no sorry,

03:19:03.140 --> 03:19:03.760
What was his name?

03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:10.241
This other Malhotra guy that was on Twitter decided to promote it right when it came out.

03:19:11.002 --> 03:19:19.824
The same guy that coordinated the PCR paper that Claire Craig and Mike Eden and Kevin McKernan are on.

03:19:19.864 --> 03:19:20.604
It's all the same.

03:19:21.024 --> 03:19:23.064
Coordinated by this guy, Malhotra.

03:19:24.685 --> 03:19:31.706
Not the UK heart doctor, but another guy with the same name who looks very creepy and was very creepy on the internet for a very long time.

03:19:32.575 --> 03:19:45.662
Calling everybody glowies I don't remember why I'm saying this now, but I I wanted to say it because of whatever they said here So I'm gonna go back and see what they said here and play it again

03:19:48.024 --> 03:19:48.805
of our advocacy.

03:19:49.366 --> 03:19:50.768
And suddenly that's all they studied.

03:19:50.848 --> 03:19:52.049
And he saw the same thing.

03:19:52.090 --> 03:19:54.993
He saw everything breaking in this remarkable reproducible.

03:19:55.214 --> 03:19:57.477
It's what these people call fakers.

03:19:57.597 --> 03:20:02.503
So glowies are people that are like limited hangouts or people that are controlled opposition.

03:20:03.104 --> 03:20:31.796
people that are acting anonymously on the internet are called glowies and people that are acting as as as uh fake people are glowies and this is what a lot of these mouse army type people and this mahaltra guy who is a co-author on this pcr paper with mckernan um that's what they talk about can i just show you what i mean um just to show you who i'm talking about here uh let's see if i have it um

03:20:33.902 --> 03:20:34.603
Where did I put it?

03:20:34.683 --> 03:20:36.404
Oh, it's in the Downloads folder, I think.

03:20:37.725 --> 03:20:37.965
Yeah.

03:20:38.886 --> 03:20:39.106
Right?

03:20:39.126 --> 03:20:40.387
Is it?

03:20:40.467 --> 03:20:40.827
Oh, no.

03:20:40.847 --> 03:20:42.248
I guess it's in there.

03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:45.971
Who would I need to look at?

03:20:48.012 --> 03:20:48.653
Where is it?

03:20:49.653 --> 03:20:50.234
Kirsch?

03:20:50.454 --> 03:20:56.798
No, it would be... Where is it?

03:20:56.858 --> 03:20:57.819
Where did I save it?

03:20:57.879 --> 03:20:59.240
Come on, come on, come on.

03:21:07.014 --> 03:21:13.482
Because there's a video of Kevin McKernan and Naomi Wolf.

03:21:17.709 --> 03:21:23.150
and this guy who coordinated the selection of the authors for the paper.

03:21:23.170 --> 03:21:39.114
And the reason why I know this guy coordinated it is because in my live interview with Thomas Binder, Thomas Binder confirmed, because I asked him which one of those authors was responsible for assembling the list, and he said the Malhotra guy was.

03:21:41.974 --> 03:21:44.675
Come on, where is Naomi and

03:21:47.532 --> 03:21:51.755
and McKernan and Mahaltra.

03:21:51.795 --> 03:21:52.916
Where did I save that?

03:21:52.976 --> 03:21:54.957
I guess I'm gonna have to just go look for it again.

03:21:55.958 --> 03:22:00.681
Maybe I can look in the downloads, show all downloads.

03:22:05.364 --> 03:22:08.766
Oh yeah, that's right, I did it with that other program, so it's in a separate folder.

03:22:08.786 --> 03:22:11.508
Okay, hold on, I almost got it, here we go.

03:22:11.588 --> 03:22:14.410
That would be here, that would be here, that would be here.

03:22:14.470 --> 03:22:15.811
Yes, here I got it, sweet.

03:22:16.596 --> 03:22:18.080
You're not gonna believe this video.

03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:21.047
It's only a short one, but it is a video.

03:22:21.669 --> 03:22:22.010
Here we go.

03:22:22.915 --> 03:22:31.301
The author's stated goal was to create a test that could detect a virus when the virus wasn't present.

03:22:32.161 --> 03:22:35.984
What I'm suggesting is that this guy right here is definitely an op.

03:22:36.664 --> 03:22:38.766
And he has been an op from the very beginning.

03:22:38.826 --> 03:22:47.292
He was a manipulating weirdo on social media, probably a UK kind of 77th Brigade kind of person.

03:22:48.380 --> 03:22:58.147
And this guy, right here, is actually the dude who Thomas Binder told me on my show, coordinated the assembly of the PCR paper.

03:22:59.068 --> 03:23:16.301
The PCR paper that had Mike Yeadon, Thomas Binder, Claire Craig of the Heart Group, and this guy, and that guy, all complaining that the Corman-Jorston WHO PCR test was not fit for purpose.

03:23:17.970 --> 03:23:23.136
and that their proposals for changing the methodology would be more fit for purpose.

03:23:23.536 --> 03:23:36.211
And here we are in 2021 in the actual business of Kevin McKernan with Naomi Wolf of Bannon fame.

03:23:38.871 --> 03:23:49.414
talking to that person from the UK, I believe, that assembled this fake paper that was gonna be fake opposition to the PCR test.

03:23:49.794 --> 03:24:00.118
And here she is trying to understand their motivations and promoting them, actually in person with Kevin McKernan at his office.

03:24:00.218 --> 03:24:03.919
Look, that's his office.

03:24:03.979 --> 03:24:07.200
There's his symbol of medicinal genomics.

03:24:11.547 --> 03:24:12.068
Let's listen.

03:24:12.368 --> 03:24:17.954
In addition to that, he didn't have virus, coronavirus COVID-19 to work with.

03:24:18.174 --> 03:24:19.256
Ah, Bobby's in Germany.

03:24:19.316 --> 03:24:20.056
Thank you very much.

03:24:20.137 --> 03:24:23.100
Bobby's a German, even better, even better.

03:24:24.241 --> 03:24:27.324
Drawing the sequencing from a computer database.

03:24:27.645 --> 03:24:28.426
Is all of that correct?

03:24:29.503 --> 03:24:40.794
Yes, only I would say he had an intention to pick up the virus when it was present, but in his design he admitted that he couldn't do a very good job with imperfect information and it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

03:24:41.114 --> 03:24:41.615
Bobby!

03:24:42.115 --> 03:24:44.578
Bobby Malhotra, that's his name, that's right.

03:24:44.618 --> 03:24:46.800
I wonder if, no, he can't be related to the other.

03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:48.722
It would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

03:24:49.062 --> 03:24:55.185
And when you say pick up, meaning the test would indicate returning positive if there were other coronaviruses.

03:24:55.245 --> 03:24:58.407
And for the lay person, I didn't know this either, everything is a coronavirus.

03:24:58.467 --> 03:25:00.107
I mean, things, I don't mean that.

03:25:00.207 --> 03:25:03.089
Many cold viruses are also called coronavirus.

03:25:03.149 --> 03:25:08.291
In fact, COVID-19, it sounded so exotic and scary when we first learned about a coronavirus.

03:25:08.311 --> 03:25:10.672
Look at his eyes flashing back and forth.

03:25:10.712 --> 03:25:12.533
Where are they flashing back and forth to?

03:25:12.573 --> 03:25:14.734
I'm gonna go back so that you can see what he's doing.

03:25:15.355 --> 03:25:17.656
This is not somebody who's very comfortable

03:25:18.416 --> 03:25:19.637
This is... look at his hands.

03:25:19.697 --> 03:25:20.998
Look how tight his hands are.

03:25:21.018 --> 03:25:23.560
And why does he keep glancing down?

03:25:24.581 --> 03:25:25.561
Watch carefully.

03:25:26.162 --> 03:25:26.702
Look at this.

03:25:27.143 --> 03:25:29.364
They got this guy on a MacBook over here.

03:25:30.966 --> 03:25:42.194
Yes, I would say he had an intention to pick up the virus when it was present, but in his design he admitted that he couldn't do a very good job with imperfect information and it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

03:25:42.434 --> 03:25:46.277
And that it would pick up... Other Asian coronaviruses.

03:25:46.838 --> 03:25:47.118
Stop!

03:25:49.405 --> 03:25:56.087
So now we're trying to get confused as to whether it's a background signal or not but we're not going to actually say it's a background signal or not.

03:25:56.427 --> 03:26:05.209
We're going to make a differentiation between Asian coronaviruses and other coronaviruses even though in virology coronaviruses are found by looking for a 328 base pair

03:26:07.390 --> 03:26:10.832
sequence that's conserved on all RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.

03:26:10.872 --> 03:26:15.294
That's how coronavirus biology was done until the pandemic started.

03:26:15.334 --> 03:26:29.100
But don't let me insert anything that might damage this lovely narrative about heroes from Germany and a pot company and Yale, a poetry major.

03:26:30.500 --> 03:26:31.161
Stop lying!

03:26:32.248 --> 03:26:38.214
So really, it's actually that the positive is not specific for SARS-CoV-2, but it's more general.

03:26:38.254 --> 03:26:40.076
So they're not even really debating anything.

03:26:55.043 --> 03:26:58.304
other than the specificity of the Corman-Joriston protocol.

03:26:58.624 --> 03:27:10.287
They're not even talking about false positives like they say in the paper with the primer-dimers and stuff, which is definitely mentioned in the paper, that they don't even seem to bother wanna tell Naomi Wolf as part of their narrative.

03:27:10.988 --> 03:27:14.348
It's just that it's not as specific as they said.

03:27:16.569 --> 03:27:19.630
Asking the wrong questions in spades is what they're doing.

03:27:21.002 --> 03:27:24.023
Naomi Wolf could be partially being misled right now.

03:27:24.063 --> 03:27:24.843
That's possible.

03:27:25.323 --> 03:27:32.244
But the idea that she doesn't know that she's participating in the curation of the narrative was laughable.

03:27:32.264 --> 03:27:33.164
Of course she knows.

03:27:34.324 --> 03:27:35.205
Of course she knows.

03:27:35.225 --> 03:27:37.545
I think it's a coronavirus.

03:27:37.925 --> 03:27:39.225
I don't mean that.

03:27:39.265 --> 03:27:42.166
Many cold viruses are also called coronavirus.

03:27:42.226 --> 03:27:48.187
In fact, COVID-19, it sounded so exotic and scary when we first learned about a coronavirus, but many, many

03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:51.202
Ordinary cold viruses are coronaviruses.

03:27:51.502 --> 03:27:52.143
Is that correct?

03:27:52.163 --> 03:27:52.563
It's correct.

03:27:52.583 --> 03:27:54.425
There's four that we watch very closely.

03:27:54.445 --> 03:28:00.791
HKU1 is the name of one, OC43, and NL63, and NL229.

03:28:01.972 --> 03:28:06.395
Those are the four ones that are commonly tracked, but there's in fact thousands of them.

03:28:07.857 --> 03:28:10.919
In fact, there are thousands of them, but we can only track four?

03:28:11.020 --> 03:28:13.081
Isn't that a really weird statement to make?

03:28:13.141 --> 03:28:14.683
Isn't that a really weird stance?

03:28:17.825 --> 03:28:26.531
paper, we can't guarantee that this will return a positive that doesn't also pick up other Asian cold viruses, is that correct?

03:28:26.551 --> 03:28:27.132
Yes, that's right.

03:28:27.232 --> 03:28:28.913
All right, pick up again, Bobby, please, from there.

03:28:29.733 --> 03:28:43.483
Yeah, so to pick it up from there, he sent his prototype PCR test to Hong Kong, to Roche Lab, and by luck, it gave a positive test result.

03:28:43.643 --> 03:28:46.205
And immediately, Christian Drosten's

03:28:46.678 --> 03:28:55.039
sent over his protocol to the WHO and also to US surveillance because he was very happy about it that it was positive.

03:28:55.520 --> 03:29:00.420
And yeah, it was all a little bit of a guessing game in this case.

03:29:00.440 --> 03:29:11.602
So basically there's no way to know if that first historic positive PCR test was some Asian person with a cold or someone with an early detected COVID-19 case.

03:29:11.642 --> 03:29:12.182
Is that correct?

03:29:13.303 --> 03:29:14.323
It is correct.

03:29:14.443 --> 03:29:15.363
I would say it is correct.

03:29:24.361 --> 03:29:26.850
It's not a casual step or gilding the lily.

03:29:27.091 --> 03:29:28.777
It's an absolutely essential.

03:29:31.101 --> 03:29:42.950
This video is produced under the pretense that the person who made the video thinks that these two guys are misleading her and the person who produced the video could be right or wrong.

03:29:42.971 --> 03:29:54.340
I'm not saying that they're right or wrong, but they are making the argument that what's happening here is that these two guys are lying to her about why the PCR test is flawed and essentially it doesn't really matter.

03:29:54.960 --> 03:30:02.345
Because we are arguing about the wrong thing if we're arguing about whether they're misleading or about the specificity or not the specificity.

03:30:02.745 --> 03:30:06.848
Because as long as we're arguing about that, we're not arguing about the existence of viruses.

03:30:07.228 --> 03:30:09.609
We're all accepting that there are thousands of viruses.

03:30:09.669 --> 03:30:15.173
And the question only is, how specific is the test for those thousands of viruses or not?

03:30:16.094 --> 03:30:16.454
You see?

03:30:18.215 --> 03:30:22.678
And so even though it seems like we're having a very vigorous debate where we're actually exposing something,

03:30:23.968 --> 03:30:25.389
We're just running in a hamster wheel.

03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:31.392
And what's most important is who is suggesting that we run in this hamster wheel.

03:30:31.812 --> 03:30:40.316
Who is participating in this malevolent barbershop quartet of liars that's agreeing that these are the right questions and these are the right answers.

03:30:40.657 --> 03:30:41.797
It is Naomi Wolf.

03:30:44.098 --> 03:30:44.419
It is

03:30:45.612 --> 03:30:48.735
Kevin McKernan, and it is this Bobby Malhotra.

03:30:48.815 --> 03:30:54.460
Bobby Malhotra promoted my review on my Scooby-Doo site immediately.

03:30:55.941 --> 03:30:56.762
Immediately.

03:30:57.843 --> 03:31:03.668
And then kind of dropped me when I started to backpedal on what I had said in the review, as everybody did.

03:31:04.268 --> 03:31:05.409
Everybody loved the review.

03:31:05.889 --> 03:31:12.175
Everybody hated it when I started to say that I might not have been right about everything in the review, including Bobby.

03:31:14.696 --> 03:31:21.491
Interestingly, it was after I published that review that Kevin McKernan finally got on my radar and needed to be on my show.

03:31:23.616 --> 03:31:25.039
Maybe to reinforce the review?

03:31:26.061 --> 03:31:29.542
make sure that I didn't read too far anymore.

03:31:29.762 --> 03:31:38.104
The final step sequencing to make sure that what looks like it could be COVID-19, but could also be a bunch of other Asian cold viruses.

03:31:38.184 --> 03:31:38.484
Okay.

03:31:38.504 --> 03:31:41.085
So I'm going to, I'm going to leave this one.

03:31:41.465 --> 03:31:46.427
Um, that last step of sequencing to make sure this is COVID-19 was not taken.

03:31:46.607 --> 03:31:47.647
I'm going to leave this one.

03:31:47.987 --> 03:31:52.368
Um, because I want to go back to the other video and I hope I can do that with just this little click here.

03:31:52.388 --> 03:31:54.669
Oops.

03:31:59.792 --> 03:32:04.756
because of the hazard that it carries with it, if there is a safe and effective treatment available.

03:32:05.036 --> 03:32:11.060
So if there are two things that the ivermectin treatment appears to be, it's safe and effective, right?

03:32:11.201 --> 03:32:13.322
Not only safe and effective, but a prophylactic, right?

03:32:13.602 --> 03:32:16.304
So it does a job that the vaccines do, right?

03:32:16.604 --> 03:32:20.607
So there is no basis to grant the emergency use authorization.

03:32:20.827 --> 03:32:22.449
And I would also point out, as long as we're here,

03:32:23.129 --> 03:32:29.791
that there is something so bizarre about the fact that the challenge to ivermectin is not that it is a terrible drug.

03:32:29.911 --> 03:32:32.651
It is that the evidence for it is not strong enough, right?

03:32:33.211 --> 03:32:38.953
There's only one explanation for why the 80s and the 90s were better than we are now, and it's social media.

03:32:39.493 --> 03:32:41.073
There's no other explanation.

03:32:41.093 --> 03:32:42.374
You don't need to look to TV.

03:32:42.814 --> 03:32:44.594
You don't need to look to video games.

03:32:44.634 --> 03:32:46.155
You don't even need to look to porn.

03:32:46.195 --> 03:32:49.596
What you need to look to is the phone and social media.

03:32:51.036 --> 03:32:51.316
That's it.

03:32:53.231 --> 03:32:58.375
If we got rid of the phones and social media, we could back this truck up really fast.

03:32:58.916 --> 03:33:10.345
The only reason why the illusion of consensus that these jackasses, that these jackasses are the ones we need to pay attention to is because of the illusion of consensus created on our phones.

03:33:13.087 --> 03:33:19.492
If there's anything I've learned from the pandemic, it is my ability to not react to the bullshit that's on here.

03:33:20.916 --> 03:33:24.319
is paramount to the success of GigaOM Biological.

03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:40.135
My ability to successfully navigate this bullshit has been central to the progress that we've made in the last few weeks because there are still people that are actively coordinating their lies to me.

03:33:42.512 --> 03:33:49.739
actively coordinating their lying to me, about me, behind my back, and to my friends.

03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:51.761
Actively, there are still people.

03:33:52.362 --> 03:33:56.165
And if you are one of them, know that I know who you are.

03:34:00.169 --> 03:34:00.730
Because I do.

03:34:03.449 --> 03:34:04.210
That's what they claim.

03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:05.651
I think this is bullshit.

03:34:05.771 --> 03:34:06.452
Of course it's bullshit.

03:34:06.532 --> 03:34:17.500
Even if it was true, the emergency use authorization effectively allows vaccines a very low standard that they have to meet because this is an emergency and we have to get them out immediately.

03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:19.382
Yeah, the bar was set a little bit low, Brad.

03:34:19.402 --> 03:34:20.062
Is that what you're saying?

03:34:20.082 --> 03:34:20.903
It was set very low.

03:34:20.923 --> 03:34:24.746
So they could leap over and become massively used and distributed throughout the world.

03:34:24.846 --> 03:34:25.046
Right.

03:34:25.146 --> 03:34:27.168
And they are a marvel, I must say, technologically speaking.

03:34:27.248 --> 03:34:31.771
But at the same time, you're setting the bar for them exceedingly low because this is an emergency.

03:34:32.111 --> 03:34:32.712
So wait, what?

03:34:34.434 --> 03:34:39.576
Did they just agree that the shots that are being released are a marvel?

03:34:42.597 --> 03:34:44.678
Because this is an emergency and we have to get them out immediately.

03:34:44.698 --> 03:34:46.698
Yeah, the bar was set a little bit low.

03:34:46.718 --> 03:34:48.019
Is that what you're saying?

03:34:48.039 --> 03:34:51.940
So they could leap over and become massively used and distributed throughout the world.

03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:52.220
Right.

03:34:52.340 --> 03:34:53.501
And they are a marvel, I must say.

03:34:54.101 --> 03:34:56.022
They are a marvel, I must say.

03:34:58.002 --> 03:34:59.783
They are a marvel, I must say.

03:35:03.979 --> 03:35:14.084
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

03:35:18.946 --> 03:35:21.707
And this has been Pierre and Brett in 2021.

03:35:22.928 --> 03:35:30.892
And we have been trying to work to build an understanding of the illusion that these traders created and are still curating today.

03:35:32.250 --> 03:35:46.282
with the hopes that they and their colleagues will be successful at running out the clock so that the alternative understanding that GigaOM Biological and a few other people are pushing will never become common knowledge.

03:35:48.263 --> 03:35:57.331
That what becomes common knowledge will be the accepting of the pandemic and its explanation being a gain-of-function virus that wasn't as bad as the next one could be.

03:35:59.301 --> 03:36:06.946
And I believe that all of these people that I'm naming on this screen and have named on other screens and in other rants are responsible for this.

03:36:07.826 --> 03:36:19.353
And that is why the strongest pattern that you will see in the behavior of these people is that they can't acknowledge that at least Jonathan Cooey gets these three things right.

03:36:20.211 --> 03:36:30.938
At least Jonathan Cooley is correct, and it is really the inevitable conclusion that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

03:36:31.719 --> 03:36:32.420
We don't know enough.

03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:38.183
They're never going to say that, just like they're never going to say that, well, he's probably right.

03:36:38.824 --> 03:36:45.589
We should have known better because transfection and transformation have been on the academic biology bench for 20 years.

03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:59.309
And everybody that's done a PhD in biology has done an oral examination where they were asked to explain the basic path from DNA to protein.

03:37:00.030 --> 03:37:10.039
And so they have to know that RNA can't be responsible for a pandemic if what we're told about how DNA and RNA lead to proteins is true.

03:37:14.281 --> 03:37:17.406
And of course, there are easier ways to say it that these people aren't going to say.

03:37:17.426 --> 03:37:25.918
They're never going to say that we don't need to fear wild RNA molecules, even ones that have special fear and cleavage sites or special HIV inserts.

03:37:31.598 --> 03:37:38.140
Ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:45.462
And yeah, this has been Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

03:37:45.983 --> 03:37:47.383
The dam is starting to break.

03:37:48.463 --> 03:37:59.267
Pierre Kory, it seems to be Pierre Kory and his track record might be the straw that breaks the camel's back because Pierre Kory is

03:38:04.498 --> 03:38:07.479
is just the tip of the iceberg.

03:38:07.780 --> 03:38:10.982
And I think that we have identified almost all of them.

03:38:11.242 --> 03:38:12.863
And so they need new people, I guess.

03:38:12.883 --> 03:38:21.108
They're gonna need some new people to mess with me because all the others have failed.

03:38:22.690 --> 03:38:26.752
It's only five more days until I leave for South Dakota.

03:38:27.753 --> 03:38:30.655
Only five more days to send the van to my house.

03:38:32.472 --> 03:38:33.356
Only five more days.

03:38:41.775 --> 03:38:44.477
Okay, I promise I'm gonna go fix this list right now.

03:38:44.558 --> 03:38:47.000
After I go to the bathroom, I'm gonna update this list.

03:38:47.580 --> 03:38:49.262
I apologize if you're not on there yet.

03:38:49.302 --> 03:38:50.943
You'll definitely be on there tomorrow.

03:38:51.504 --> 03:38:52.825
I love you all very, very much.

03:38:52.985 --> 03:38:53.425
Thank you.

03:38:54.126 --> 03:38:56.688
Freedom is definitely measured in ohms, Pamela.

03:38:57.529 --> 03:39:03.414
And the high resistance on this stream has a lot to do with you guys.

03:39:03.474 --> 03:39:04.796
Thanks a lot for being here.
