00:59.964 --> 01:01.446
But you can tell if someone's lying.

01:02.107 --> 01:03.869
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.371
And I have lied.

01:06.392 --> 01:07.433
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:07.453 --> 01:08.394
I don't want to lie.

01:08.874 --> 01:10.236
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:10.356 --> 01:11.377
I try not to be a liar.

01:11.397 --> 01:12.258
I don't want to be a liar.

01:12.819 --> 01:15.542
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:21.647 --> 01:28.693
the masks, or behind, you know, proper testing, or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right?

01:28.713 --> 01:30.755
This technology that had never been used widely.

01:31.255 --> 01:33.116
None of that is over.

01:33.217 --> 01:41.543
And as Sasha Latifa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

01:41.783 --> 01:44.466
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

01:44.926 --> 01:49.670
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity, having had it

01:49.930 --> 01:53.352
For two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

01:53.553 --> 02:01.498
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

02:01.678 --> 02:08.403
All of that was on a global basis.

02:38.683 --> 02:40.264
I think truth is good for kids.

02:40.684 --> 02:44.506
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:44.987 --> 02:46.587
We want everybody to feel good.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.929
That's not the way life is.

03:38.831 --> 03:38.951
Yeah.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.341
I don't care how you get there.

04:10.361 --> 04:13.042
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.703
The goal is to win.

04:30.219 --> 04:31.279
Good morning, everybody.

04:31.359 --> 04:32.260
Welcome to the show.

04:32.280 --> 04:37.662
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistant, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

04:38.402 --> 04:40.363
It's here that we stay focused on the biology.

04:40.403 --> 04:42.064
We don't take the bait on social media.

04:42.104 --> 04:43.124
We try to love our neighbor.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.806
Certainly, we try to know who they are by getting off of social media.

04:47.986 --> 04:49.348
I gotta clear my throat a little bit.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.148
I apologize.

04:51.009 --> 04:52.310
That's the main message here.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.452
We gotta get our kids off of social media.

04:54.512 --> 04:57.455
It's the 26th of June, 2025.

04:57.515 --> 05:00.178
We shouldn't still be pretending like this is okay.

05:00.798 --> 05:02.920
Autism spectrum... Sorry, Brian.

05:03.481 --> 05:05.823
I don't like the word autism.

05:05.923 --> 05:06.804
He was vaccine-damaged.

05:06.964 --> 05:07.745
I understand, Brian.

05:07.905 --> 05:11.028
Autism spectrum disorder is indeed a myth used to make sure that

05:11.688 --> 05:20.874
Intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason or an answer.

05:21.695 --> 05:29.040
The same can be said for pandemics and gain of function and all of these things that are even better than a nuclear bomb at killing everybody.

05:29.060 --> 05:34.583
This is all nonsense and we need to start teaching our kids the way out.

05:34.603 --> 05:41.108
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, then you will not be able to free yourself.

05:42.810 --> 05:57.329
I noticed a very interesting pattern on social media this morning when I decided to open up an account on Blue Sky and then was challenged to start following people and it was shocking to me going on Blue Sky how many of these

05:58.050 --> 06:08.499
entities and people and idea factories and whatever news sources like the Vigilant Fox are just not present on Blue Sky.

06:08.559 --> 06:14.504
It's almost as if they don't care to save or to interact with any of those Americans.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.265
It's almost

06:15.965 --> 06:44.904
like they they like being separated they like the the the independent uh independent media my ass ladies and gentlemen if you don't follow him or don't know who he is i can't imagine you're watching this live but if you are uh please follow housatonicits.com because that is the man um and also please follow this substackbiologyphenomenon.substack.com it's all about the murder and lies in scotland i think one of the places where

06:45.564 --> 06:52.670
Maybe more than anywhere else in the Western world, you can see a clear signal of the management of the population pyramid.

06:52.730 --> 06:55.632
Ladies and gentlemen, once you know the truth, it will set you free.

06:56.353 --> 06:57.954
That is the goal of this stream.

06:58.554 --> 07:00.136
I hope in some ways... What?

07:00.196 --> 07:02.718
That's the wrong... What is that doing up there?

07:02.778 --> 07:04.119
Hold on one second.

07:04.879 --> 07:07.922
You need to be the mixtape and then this will work just fine.

07:10.162 --> 07:11.683
It's good to see everybody in the chat.

07:11.783 --> 07:12.524
Good to be here.

07:12.544 --> 07:16.046
This is GigaOM Biological coming to you live from Pittsburgh.

07:16.086 --> 07:18.308
That could be a picture of Pittsburgh there.

07:19.789 --> 07:20.570
You don't have to.

07:21.110 --> 07:23.512
It could really be a picture of Pittsburgh.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.435
And so welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:27.455 --> 07:29.696
This is GigaOM Biological.

07:31.357 --> 07:32.298
Very happy to be here.

07:32.338 --> 07:34.099
It is a message from America.

07:35.468 --> 07:42.652
Because I'm American, my kids are American, we live on American soil, and this is our community.

07:43.393 --> 07:46.495
I want to help everybody, but this is a message coming out of America.

07:46.515 --> 08:00.043
If you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave, and if not, you might be a person who is a skilled TV watcher, a skilled social media user, who isn't staying focused on the biology, who regularly takes their bait on social media, and maybe

08:00.623 --> 08:02.084
doesn't even know who your neighbors are.

08:02.104 --> 08:04.526
I hope that's not the case, but if so, welcome to the show.

08:04.566 --> 08:05.327
You're welcome here.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.669
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.631
I'm chief biologist at GigaOM Biological.

08:10.651 --> 08:17.676
You can find the stain of my Akata magic work on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

08:18.436 --> 08:20.158
I also used to work for Children's Health Defense.

08:20.178 --> 08:26.943
I wrote a couple articles for The Defender, not that many, because my job was to stay out of the spotlight there.

08:27.883 --> 08:38.495
I did help Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the current Health and Human Services Secretary for the United States of America, write his book, The Wuhan Cover-Up and the Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race.

08:39.116 --> 08:42.619
I'm listed in there, I'm quoted in there, I'm in the glossary or the...

08:43.360 --> 08:44.901
cast of characters, if you will.

08:45.482 --> 08:50.166
I've also met Jay Bhattacharya more than a few times over the course of the pandemic.

08:50.206 --> 08:52.488
Had lots of conversations with him over tacos.

08:53.709 --> 09:00.094
I guess I haven't been able to make much of an impression on him because he's not a biologist.

09:00.214 --> 09:03.957
Anyway, haven't heard from him since he became the head of NIH.

09:04.038 --> 09:05.319
Congratulations to him.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.300
I heard he's kicking a lot of ass.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.722
We're trying to do the same thing here.

09:09.122 --> 09:18.311
This started out as a lowly, innocent YouTube channel that was supposed to get me tenure or help me maybe be an attractive faculty member.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.232
That didn't work out.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.593
Now I have two YouTube channels.

09:20.713 --> 09:23.295
One that I'm currently streaming to, which is JC in the Woods.

09:24.638 --> 09:28.059
Um, and that's just because I don't really want to risk JC on a bike.

09:28.099 --> 09:29.140
I really like that channel.

09:29.180 --> 09:30.760
That content's really special to me.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.641
It's going to be something that I remember for a long time.

09:34.441 --> 09:45.645
Um, and how this works is that I've got a few, uh, you know, a hundred or so supporters that send me anywhere from 10 to a, to a thousand dollars a month and, and it adds up to rent and, and food.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.565
And that's about it.

09:47.446 --> 09:51.207
Um, but I do work and I do work a lot and I do think, um,

09:52.290 --> 10:02.532
I do think it's working out that people are sharing, people are finding it, more people are finding stream.gigaohm.bio than ever before, which is our own host.

10:03.092 --> 10:11.314
It doesn't work perfectly, but if you're having problems with it working perfectly, what you can do is just click the download link there and then download it.

10:11.414 --> 10:13.614
Once it's downloaded, of course, it'll play fine.

10:15.235 --> 10:20.036
And, you know, there's also, it's on YouTube, it's on Rumble, where we're,

10:20.996 --> 10:23.377
We're trying to be a lot of places on Twitch.

10:23.437 --> 10:24.277
It's also there.

10:25.698 --> 10:27.578
And so, you know, I don't like Twitch.

10:27.658 --> 10:32.360
Twitch is a really weird platform, but it was one of the few places where I could just go and hang out.

10:32.880 --> 10:37.761
I mean, nobody was going to bother me there because they have so much trash on Twitch.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.702
There's just so much trash on Twitch.

10:40.762 --> 10:48.068
So if you're here and you've managed to get here without being distracted by Twitch, again, congratulations for doing that.

10:48.309 --> 10:50.310
Oh gosh, that's an old transition.

10:50.390 --> 10:51.991
I forgot that I had that.

10:52.011 --> 10:52.632
It's such a great...

10:54.332 --> 10:55.153
little mix there.

10:55.553 --> 10:56.674
Thank you very much for being here.

10:56.754 --> 10:57.455
Let me switch over.

10:58.736 --> 11:00.157
It's good to see everyone in the chat.

11:00.237 --> 11:01.698
We have 40 viewers already.

11:01.798 --> 11:02.559
Welcome to the show.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.760
This is Giga Home Biological.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.701
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

11:05.501 --> 11:07.403
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage.

11:08.924 --> 11:12.127
We are the, coming from Pittsburgh, the home of

11:13.803 --> 11:14.943
The Home of Mr. Rogers.

11:16.684 --> 11:24.006
I don't have that guy on the wall back there painted by a high school kid from my local high school.

11:24.026 --> 11:26.967
You know, the high school where Matthew Crooks went.

11:28.987 --> 11:31.748
I don't have that painting up there lightly.

11:31.768 --> 11:33.388
I don't put that up there lightly.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.029
I think that guy was a pretty great dude.

11:37.207 --> 11:41.191
I think how he lived his life and the example that he set was a pretty great example.

11:41.251 --> 11:48.420
It's not the example that everybody can set or it's not the example that anyone else would set, I don't think, except for Fred Rogers.

11:48.480 --> 11:56.549
But I'm happy that I now live in the city where he was from and I like to think that a lot of the character

11:57.510 --> 12:08.743
of the older people, you know, adults in Pittsburgh has been influenced directly or indirectly by his presence and his attitude and his open-mindedness and his love.

12:09.664 --> 12:14.228
And so I, you know, do I aspire to be like him?

12:14.248 --> 12:19.154
I don't really know, but do I want to have a vibe that's closer to his than

12:19.794 --> 12:32.799
Than anyone else that I can think of I guess so I want to be a biology teacher at some point, but it's hard Because America, let me just clear that America is I can't do that.

12:32.839 --> 12:44.124
I guess I have to do this and Then that okay, that's better But America is under attack and and it's a Trojan horse and

12:45.516 --> 12:47.596
in the sense of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:47.636 --> 12:54.898
was used as kind of a front man, as an independent candidate, actually scripted in a Skyhorse book.

12:56.218 --> 13:03.259
And it really feels quite disturbing to be where we are from my perspective, because I worked with a lot of these people.

13:03.599 --> 13:10.180
I tried to move their position forward, sharpen their thinking, sharpen their messaging.

13:10.260 --> 13:14.201
And I was really shocked

13:15.290 --> 13:32.274
by the lack of progress that anybody has made and was willing to make with regard to the messaging and instead everybody's really focused on this big top tent of health freedom and getting Bobby elected or getting him in the White House or whatever they've

13:32.862 --> 13:33.503
accomplished.

13:33.983 --> 13:38.186
And I'm making the argument, the accusation that I don't think very many people are making.

13:38.767 --> 13:41.269
And that is that this is all really scripted bullshit.

13:41.309 --> 13:46.373
These three people, for example, are a very, very bad joke on our children in America.

13:47.454 --> 14:01.745
And to see it any other way is to be bamboozled by social media and mainstream media, which is really just one conglomerate of bullshit, because the people that are performing on social media are also regularly performing on mainstream media, or their, their

14:02.694 --> 14:04.296
puppeteered counterparts.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.342
And so I'm going to start with this video this morning because this was yesterday.

14:24.144 --> 14:25.545
And so this is yesterday.

14:25.565 --> 14:38.789
This is the illustrious Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccines, the savior of Western civilization, who's traveled the world for five years while juggling an emu farm and horse breeding business.

14:39.881 --> 14:47.572
to spread the word about how the mRNA might not be good for everybody, might be good for some people.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.917
It's hard to really tell exactly what he thought about the mRNA.

14:50.997 --> 14:54.562
One of the best ways to experience the mRNA

14:55.183 --> 15:04.790
illustrious nature of his ability to disambiguate things is to watch his presentation to the kids on the Hawaiian beach from 2021.

15:04.930 --> 15:11.014
That's a really remarkable display of intellectual prowess.

15:11.674 --> 15:23.022
Him and his wife in their bare feet essentially bring these kids up to speed on all of the major biological ideas that are necessary to understand

15:23.542 --> 15:29.883
in order to make an informed decision about whether or not they themselves should transfect them.

15:30.024 --> 15:33.044
They themselves should accept transfection.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.246
It's one of the greatest videos I've ever seen.

15:39.906 --> 15:44.667
And so, after so many years of sacrificing almost everything,

15:45.580 --> 16:03.212
to travel the world and speak out against this stuff, to organize a dissident movement that spanned national borders, even organizing international cruise meetings across off the coast of Turkey, where all these international dissidents could come together.

16:03.612 --> 16:07.455
International COVID summits, six of them were organized by this man.

16:08.621 --> 16:23.709
So that these, you know, rare breed of human could be all around the world, letting people know that, you know, COVID is a PSYOP that we're never going to figure out that it's a military operation, but we're not sure what military it is.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.810
It doesn't matter because you'll never figure it out.

16:27.672 --> 16:36.516
And this culminated in my humble opinion with the COVID summit meeting that took place in Romania in November of 2023.

16:40.845 --> 16:52.572
Anyway, this was him at the ACIP meeting yesterday, breaking all the molds, clearing the table, throwing the money changers out of the temple.

16:52.632 --> 16:53.253
Here he goes.

16:53.393 --> 16:59.336
Clarification, there are two windows of time, post-vaccination.

17:00.417 --> 17:04.820
Post-vaccination being defined as having completed at least two doses, correct?

17:06.874 --> 17:14.756
Are you referring to a specific analyses like the rapid cycle analyses or are you speaking more generally?

17:15.156 --> 17:17.137
I'm speaking of the data that you shared here.

17:17.237 --> 17:27.520
So you, the windows of time that you're presenting data on are either 28-day or 42-day post-vaccination defined as fill in the blank.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.921
Okay, for death analyses.

17:28.941 --> 17:29.781
Yes, that is correct.

17:29.961 --> 17:30.101
Yes.

17:30.121 --> 17:33.542
Okay, so post-vaccination being one dose, two dose.

17:35.142 --> 17:37.384
We looked at at least one dose.

17:37.504 --> 17:41.787
And then for our VSD analyses, we looked at, we did three different analyses.

17:41.847 --> 17:44.810
So we did after the primary series, so completion of a primary.

17:45.730 --> 17:48.112
Can you feel the pressure that he's putting on?

17:48.192 --> 17:51.354
Can you feel how much winning this is?

17:51.434 --> 17:58.139
Because Robert Malone, sitting on the ACIP, is making this lady from the CDC sweat.

17:58.580 --> 18:02.743
She can barely answer his question because it's so sharp it hurts.

18:04.416 --> 18:09.378
then we did after the original booster and then we did after the Omicron booster.

18:09.858 --> 18:30.324
And then for the analysis of AE association, that analysis, so you were just referring to deaths, the analysis of AE association was also limited to a time window of 28 days?

18:31.616 --> 18:34.437
We have a number of different ways that we look at.

18:34.537 --> 18:40.498
So there's a few different windows that we look at depending on kind of which analytic method we're using.

18:41.339 --> 18:49.661
I'd like to invite Eric Weintraub who's our kind of expert in methodologies to kind of walk through the different post-vaccination intervals that we use.

18:52.105 --> 18:54.247
She hands off, that's fantastic.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.349
I wish I could say I was adding that reverb.

19:08.303 --> 19:12.825
each new vaccine that has come as a recommendation up to this past season.

19:13.605 --> 19:26.251
And what that allows us to do is then also scan within the 42 days to see if there is any other intervals that might be elevated using using Martin Koldorf's clustering technique.

19:27.075 --> 19:29.597
to look for increased risk during certain time periods.

19:30.158 --> 19:39.806
So it's very common for us to to look at 42 days and then also look at a comparison time and our comparison time historically for most of these outcomes are going to be days 43 to 84.

19:40.306 --> 19:50.755
Roger, so in in this analysis or these analyses

19:52.633 --> 20:04.780
My understanding, because I frankly, if you'll forgive the coaching, the slide... See again, this is a demonstration for people who don't know who the hell this guy is.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.963
Now the reason why I brought this up before is because I want to emphasize it now.

20:10.004 --> 20:13.406
That my... Why is this still playing?

20:13.786 --> 20:15.927
My limited experience with

20:19.164 --> 20:31.770
My limited experience with this whole social media thing led me to believe that because these people are much better than me, they have social media everywhere, right?

20:31.810 --> 20:33.171
They're on all the things.

20:33.251 --> 20:35.952
They do all the platforms, but actually they don't.

20:37.549 --> 20:59.827
A tremendous number of people that are members of the Health Freedom Movement, despite the fact that they've moved on to being online doctors, are representing themselves both professionally and personally, very specifically, on X. They aren't also on Blue Sky.

21:00.788 --> 21:03.450
They aren't also pushing Facebook pages.

21:03.531 --> 21:06.213
They aren't also pushing Instagram accounts.

21:07.810 --> 21:11.612
The only people that push Instagram accounts are people that have clothes to sell.

21:11.772 --> 21:12.872
That's really the truth.

21:13.312 --> 21:31.280
And since most of these health freedom people don't have clothes to sell or they have supplements to sell, so I bet some of them are on Instagram, but it's impressive how many conservatives are not on Blue Sky and how many conservatives

21:32.236 --> 21:55.067
Liberals are not on X and I think we've become woefully unaware of how much of an echo chamber X is for our side that we're just Those people are just riding around in circles in there thinking they're making mileage even arguing with each other but they're actually arguing with people who aren't trying to get out and Many of them are puppets

21:56.738 --> 22:07.263
And the 1% of us that are awake, surrounded by 4% of them who are puppets, are invisible to the rest of the 85% of the world.

22:08.683 --> 22:13.325
And that can be a combination of programming and just overwhelming firehose effect.

22:14.286 --> 22:18.408
And so remember that there is a huge part of the American population

22:19.110 --> 22:21.791
that doesn't give a shit about the ACIP.

22:22.312 --> 22:33.537
But that part of the population that's worried that the ACIP has been depopulated and repopulated with people who are all anti-vax might actually be paying attention.

22:34.217 --> 22:43.702
And so Robert Malone, seeming to show some kind of impromptu, improvised critique, excuse my critique, excuse my coaching,

22:45.609 --> 22:48.691
This guy is not a coach for anything, I assure you.

22:50.312 --> 22:53.654
And I hope you don't mind, I'd like to be your biology coach.

22:53.714 --> 22:59.638
This guy is a US agent, maybe a NATO agent.

22:59.818 --> 23:03.320
I don't know who he works for, but he is not a patriot.

23:04.488 --> 23:10.913
He is not somebody who has the best interest of our grandchildren in mind, not even my family in mind.

23:10.973 --> 23:19.199
This is a man who I believe is probably could be best characterized as a traitor to America's children.

23:19.920 --> 23:25.984
He is selling us out to some other global interest or some other global pile of money.

23:26.124 --> 23:30.368
I don't know what it is, but he's not a horse farmer and an emu breeder.

23:31.360 --> 23:39.282
and an activist who just happened to go to the Vatican and to the Italian parliament with Steve Hatfill.

23:39.802 --> 23:41.943
This is just absurd at this moment.

23:42.743 --> 23:52.026
And remember that Steven Hatfill is a special advisor to the CDC and the CDC's director was just confirmed while this bullshit was going on.

23:53.052 --> 23:54.172
So you kind of missed that.

23:54.572 --> 24:01.274
The CDC director told us all about her vision for that particular organization and it ain't good.

24:01.834 --> 24:11.357
And that's also supposedly under the purview of our health and human services secretary, the great hero, the man on the white horse, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:12.737 --> 24:17.441
And his, this is his script writer right here, this guy, this performer.

24:18.102 --> 24:30.353
Lists a series of AEs that have been among the... And this performer, sorry I want to finish that, is auditioning now for mainstream.

24:30.413 --> 24:35.938
He's now auditioning for social media to be able to deploy him on the other side.

24:37.233 --> 24:39.454
And we're supposed to rally behind him, right?

24:39.494 --> 24:41.596
Because he's our guy.

24:41.676 --> 24:48.860
We're supposed to defend him now against our family's critique of him being an anti-vaxxer that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.342
appointed by saying that, look, he's not an anti-vaxxer at all.

24:52.402 --> 24:54.583
He just wants these studies done right.

24:54.603 --> 24:57.425
65 assessed.

25:00.433 --> 25:14.760
is a little hard to, it would be preferable if that was structured in a way that we really knew what all of those 65 analyses were and we could, you know, sort it by alphabetical order or something.

25:15.501 --> 25:26.686
So I infer, having tried to pick through that, that hypertension, tachycardia, and POTS were analyzed and were not correlated.

25:28.979 --> 25:34.962
And so he's gonna go on to help them tell this story about how they didn't find signals there.

25:35.022 --> 25:37.883
And so they're only reporting those signals and he's fine with it.

25:38.843 --> 25:41.385
Don't underestimate what's happening here.

25:42.225 --> 25:52.950
This guy came out on the Brett Weinstein podcast, telling us stories about CIA agents and AI programs for DITRA.

25:54.332 --> 25:56.574
and spinning up your team.

25:57.075 --> 26:06.724
This guy right now is on the ACIP, and this guy right now is advising the guy at the head of the FDA, the head of CBER, and the head of HHS.

26:06.805 --> 26:14.132
He has the ear of all of them, if not the script also provided for none other than my friend Jayanta Bhattacharya.

26:15.660 --> 26:21.124
And I have to assume that because Jayanta Bhattacharya specifically said, you know, you got to stop naming names.

26:21.664 --> 26:25.987
You got to just teach the biology because you're so good at it, even though I don't understand what you're talking about.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.369
And please stop saying Robert Malone's name.

26:30.650 --> 26:36.654
Not Robert F. Kennedy Jr., not Rixey, not Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone.

26:37.935 --> 26:49.997
And so I assume that Robert Malone is the guy who got Jay Bhattacharya where he is and is probably giving him all the smart things to say and all of the clever word combinations to use while he's doing his huge podcast tour.

26:51.018 --> 26:59.159
Because that seems to be what the NIH director does now, just like the FDA director, just like the head of CBER, just like, I guess, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:59.199 --> 26:59.439
does.

26:59.479 --> 27:02.360
I mean, he's even been on with Dr. Drew and shit.

27:07.566 --> 27:09.210
Second video from yesterday.

27:09.932 --> 27:10.915
Or this is from today.

27:11.456 --> 27:11.616
Over.

27:13.279 --> 27:16.940
Thank you very much, and I think we're going to proceed to the voting.

27:16.980 --> 27:22.662
So, the draft vote is ACIP recommends, and there's actually two of them.

27:22.702 --> 27:35.685
The first one is ACIP recommends infants aged less than eight months, born during or entering their first RSV season, who are not protected by maternal vaccination, receive one dose of Glesrovimab.

27:36.185 --> 27:38.626
And I want to just clarify that this is not in addition

27:40.642 --> 28:05.298
So the ACIP has an Israeli who works at MIT, has a Dutch guy that worked at Harvard, and has an emu farmer and horse breeder who lives in Virginia, who used to work for the Who, and Gavi, and Salve, and Ditra, and Merck, and Didi, Bola, and Zika, and

28:06.598 --> 28:17.726
used to sleep on the couch of David Hone and has a friend named Mike Callahan who's a liar, has a friend named Peter Cullis who's a liar.

28:18.106 --> 28:19.748
Yeah, that guy's also on this.

28:20.188 --> 28:22.209
It's remarkable what's going on here.

28:25.661 --> 28:46.789
uh the neosemimab which has already been recommended so it's basically that and so now we're talking about the recommendation that we're gonna give monoclonal antibodies at eight months to any baby who was whose mom was not vaccinated for rsv

28:47.921 --> 28:52.943
And the crazy part is, is that there's no consideration for whether the mom is breastfeeding the baby.

28:53.423 --> 28:55.964
It's just whether the mom was vaccinated for RSV.

28:56.004 --> 29:07.729
And if she was not vaccinated for RSV, that at eight months, they're recommending an infusion, an infusion of a monoclonal antibody.

29:08.069 --> 29:09.730
I cannot make this shit up.

29:10.951 --> 29:14.032
The child will receive either, uh, either

29:16.432 --> 29:22.035
or the mother would have received the vaccination during pregnancy.

29:22.075 --> 29:26.278
So there's one of these three should be done in addition to that instead of.

29:27.772 --> 29:32.237
Do we have a motion for this?

29:32.477 --> 29:38.542
And so now remember the way that the ACIP works is that they play with the parliamentary procedure of it.

29:38.663 --> 29:44.548
And so the decisions become legal when they follow parliamentary procedures.

29:44.588 --> 29:45.709
So somebody has to

29:47.794 --> 29:51.956
nominate it or propose it, then someone has to second it, and then they have a vote.

29:52.016 --> 29:55.217
And then if the vote goes, then the chairman has to declare something.

29:55.837 --> 30:05.641
And so you will notice that during this procedure, at some point, the foreigner from Holland is not actually going to say the words that are necessary.

30:05.702 --> 30:11.164
And his secretary is going to get a message on her phone, and she's going to write something down, and then he's going to say it.

30:11.744 --> 30:22.390
And that's because it is this parliamentary procedure which becomes the legal or civil, or I don't know how they do it, but you can feel it, that it's the procedure, it's the due process.

30:24.311 --> 30:27.352
And understand that, that's how our system works, it's due process.

30:27.372 --> 30:29.433
There has to be some ritual that they follow.

30:29.934 --> 30:31.134
And so this is a ritual.

30:31.695 --> 30:35.937
And so putting people in place that are still gonna follow the ritual,

30:37.682 --> 30:51.809
None other than Martin Kildorff can be quoted as saying yesterday in their meeting that if you wanted people, if you believe that all vaccines are good, or you believe that all vaccines are bad, then you shouldn't want this committee to exist.

30:53.549 --> 31:00.233
So the committee already believes that some vaccines are good and some vaccines might be less good.

31:00.633 --> 31:02.634
And so there's a reason for them to exist.

31:02.714 --> 31:05.355
That's the premise of this ritual.

31:07.358 --> 31:11.660
I move for approval of this draft recommendation language.

31:11.881 --> 31:12.061
Over.

31:13.421 --> 31:13.802
Thank you.

31:13.862 --> 31:14.722
And do I have a second?

31:17.704 --> 31:19.325
Yes, I second.

31:20.205 --> 31:21.226
Okay, we have a second.

31:21.326 --> 31:22.607
So let's vote then.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.888
My wife thinks that Martin Kulldorff is Swedish.

31:25.929 --> 31:27.509
I'm not sure about that, though.

31:27.750 --> 31:28.310
I'm not sure.

31:28.970 --> 31:32.932
And why don't we start with Dr. Malone?

31:34.573 --> 31:35.014
Vote yes.

31:36.648 --> 31:37.069
Dr. Hebron?

31:37.851 --> 31:38.492
I vote yes.

31:38.512 --> 31:39.974
Dr. Pagano?

31:40.876 --> 31:41.116
Yes.

31:42.018 --> 31:42.459
Dr. Lebe?

31:43.824 --> 31:53.309
I vote no, I just want to clarify that my... Oh, Retsef Levy from MIT votes no because he doesn't think it's ready.

31:53.449 --> 31:57.691
Wow, this committee has actually finally some truth in it.

31:58.152 --> 31:59.732
Don't you feel so good?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.753
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:01.874 --> 32:02.634
saved us.

32:02.794 --> 32:05.996
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

32:06.496 --> 32:07.857
Stop lying!

32:08.637 --> 32:10.138
It's just all one big show.

32:11.206 --> 32:12.347
This is all bullshit.

32:12.467 --> 32:27.935
Even if he is a, he cannot be just a really dumb MIT professor who just believes everything biological that he's told and then, you know, applies his smarts to it.

32:27.995 --> 32:29.336
That's not possible.

32:30.076 --> 32:38.360
Just like it's not possible that that guy is a horse breeder and an emu breeder and most of the time would rather be on his farm.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.461
That's bullshit.

32:41.408 --> 32:48.654
Objection is based on the fact that I don't feel this is ready to be administered to all healthy babies.

32:48.754 --> 32:52.437
I think we should take a more precautionary approach to this.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.261
But I respect the discussion and the opinions of my colleagues.

32:57.341 --> 32:57.921
I vote no.

32:57.982 --> 32:58.262
Thank you.

32:58.862 --> 32:59.142
Thank you.

32:59.182 --> 33:01.985
And so you make no real biological statement.

33:02.185 --> 33:05.488
I don't think that this is ready to roll out in all healthy babies.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.270
Then make the argument why?

33:09.994 --> 33:15.189
Because most healthy babies don't need to be augmented in order to survive RSV.

33:16.854 --> 33:22.037
We're not talking about making sure that, you know, mandating breastfeeding.

33:22.538 --> 33:31.543
Why aren't we talking about the stupidly obvious mega benefits of breastfeeding with regard to the first eight months of our children?

33:31.603 --> 33:42.570
But we're talking about the administration of one of three monoclonal antibody products and making sure they're available for people that need them, not just people who have insurance.

33:43.111 --> 33:45.172
How is it even fricking possible?

33:47.731 --> 33:51.094
unless this is all just one great big malevolent show.

33:53.116 --> 33:53.756
Dr. Meisner?

33:54.757 --> 33:54.977
Yes.

33:55.578 --> 33:56.298
Dr. Petchworth?

33:57.980 --> 33:58.520
I vote no.

33:59.881 --> 34:03.504
And I'm articulating yes.

34:04.285 --> 34:11.231
And so that lady back there is also going to say something about the mRNAs and how the mRNA is not totally okay.

34:11.711 --> 34:15.094
And so people are also cheering that lady, Vicky, whatever her name is.

34:15.154 --> 34:15.875
And it's a joke.

34:17.472 --> 34:32.827
It's a joke because they're still just using the same, you know, neutered language where everything's a vaccine, everything's public health, everything's a countermeasure or everything is, you know, got a VE or, you know, COVID is real.

34:32.907 --> 34:34.128
It's all bullshit.

34:35.049 --> 34:41.856
And this show right here was made for you because on the same day, the CDC director was being confirmed.

34:43.189 --> 34:45.770
And you did not want to hear it.

34:45.830 --> 34:47.051
They didn't want you to hear it.

34:47.091 --> 34:52.654
They wanted you cheering on this ACIP meeting and thinking that this was some form of winning.

34:53.914 --> 35:00.257
Because after the music break, you're not going to believe what the CDC director said in her introductory remarks.

35:01.538 --> 35:05.680
I have five votes for yes and two votes for no.

35:07.821 --> 35:11.803
And we also have a second draft vote.

35:12.768 --> 35:21.111
which is, and this was presented yesterday at the meeting, approve the updated vaccines for children resolution for prevention of RSV.

35:22.872 --> 35:26.793
So, we'll do the same order, Dr. Malone.

35:35.854 --> 35:37.595
I wasn't aware that we were going to have this vote.

35:39.016 --> 35:40.216
It is essentially the same vote.

35:40.296 --> 35:45.479
It's just making sure that this product is available in the vaccine for children's program.

35:46.363 --> 35:47.804
Malone's not sure, man.

35:48.245 --> 35:50.667
I'm not sure if I should have done this or not.

35:51.547 --> 35:58.673
I'm, you know, I've got some books, and I like to sell the books, and so I'm gonna try and look like a cool guy here.

35:58.693 --> 36:07.040
And, you know, I'm friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but I'm really just a horse breeder, and I'm cool.

36:08.761 --> 36:11.724
This is the utmost in fraud.

36:12.762 --> 36:16.523
just one of the most fraudulent men in America.

36:17.784 --> 36:25.187
And essentially, because CHD has never disowned him, because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:25.307 --> 36:36.331
still follows him, I mean, these people are all just one malevolent network of saboteurs, shitheads, that have taken advantage of every

36:37.287 --> 37:05.768
Damaged kid parent in America that they could and ignored every damaged kid parent that they had to in order to achieve Whatever shit goal this is which is turning us over to the highest bidder Tricking us into accepting this digital prison that we're all gonna get walked right into occluding by people like CHD and Bobby Kennedy who CHD is gonna completely ignore the fact that Bobby Kennedy's interested in getting wearables and

37:06.768 --> 37:08.244
on every kid in America.

37:11.892 --> 37:28.863
I mean the level of just sabotage, just absolute failure that CHD represents for having been around so long and accomplished so little that at their second conference, their best message they had was rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies and courage over fear.

37:29.364 --> 37:30.605
Courage over fear.

37:30.645 --> 37:34.207
How much courage do they have when they just don't say it?

37:34.848 --> 37:37.569
That intramuscular injection can murder people.

37:37.609 --> 37:39.751
That intramuscular injection is poison.

37:42.762 --> 37:45.243
And instead, they say shit like Rise and Resist.

37:45.683 --> 38:01.229
And they raise money for millions of dollars to pay people really fat salaries to sit at home and raise money and make bullshit fricking podcasts that do nothing but promote a different form of globalism.

38:01.269 --> 38:04.591
Like, oh, the WHO is bad, or the UN is bad.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.091
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:06.111 --> 38:07.412
is playing 5D chess.

38:08.272 --> 38:11.713
Mary Holland's been working so hard for so long.

38:12.314 --> 38:15.275
She deserves a quarter million dollars a year in salary.

38:15.355 --> 38:17.836
Man, she's like the smartest lawyer on earth.

38:18.636 --> 38:20.036
It's a giant sham.

38:22.417 --> 38:35.502
The whole health freedom movement is a giant sham from Andrew Wakefield all the way up to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I don't think is clever enough to know exactly how badly he's been played.

38:36.570 --> 38:43.293
I think he actually had a very good gut feeling that he shouldn't get involved with the vaccine issue, but he did it because his handlers told him to.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.474
His handlers promised him the White House for shit's sake.

38:49.775 --> 38:50.736
That is my understanding.

38:51.076 --> 38:51.656
Is that correct?

38:53.037 --> 38:57.218
Yeah, so can I hear the actual language that I would be voting on?

39:01.240 --> 39:02.901
All right, my wife has it in the chat.

39:02.921 --> 39:04.021
It looks like he's Swedish.

39:04.221 --> 39:04.581
I lose.

39:08.251 --> 39:09.012
Stop lying.

39:09.252 --> 39:10.472
He says it to me too.

39:10.532 --> 39:13.554
So, you know, it's real now that fearless in the chat, that's what happens.

39:18.677 --> 39:21.199
So he wants to know the resolution.

39:21.259 --> 39:26.582
Sorry, you missed it, but they're kind of freaking out right now because Robert Malone says, I didn't know that this was going to be a vote.

39:27.002 --> 39:29.764
Can I see the exact text that I'm voting on?

39:29.824 --> 39:32.906
Cause I don't want to just, you know, willy nilly cast a yes vote.

39:34.256 --> 39:38.599
I think if we can go to slide.

39:43.123 --> 39:44.985
Doctor Koldorf, can I make a comment?

39:46.586 --> 39:48.828
Please do.

39:49.568 --> 39:53.171
And I and I appreciate Doctor Malone's questions.

39:55.634 --> 40:01.999
This is extremely important that VFC cover this product.

40:03.530 --> 40:12.417
It is very important to ensure equity in our country so that

40:14.464 --> 40:25.754
So this is going to be putting these monoclonals on the vaccine schedule for kids, I believe vaccines for kids, so that insurance companies are forced to support them.

40:25.854 --> 40:32.060
So three monoclonal antibodies available for kids after eight months if their mom didn't get an RSV vaccine.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.281
That's really where we are.

40:36.699 --> 40:50.794
and Robert Malone is voting yes but he's also going to vote yes for the availability of the RSV vaccine which will be applied during pregnancy kind of the same thing that he was all for with regard to Zika you see this is an absolute

40:51.929 --> 41:09.925
just he's just a pawn we've been played we've been played by him and all the people around him that used his script to play us from robert malone to meryl nass to mary holland to jessica rose to pierre corey to

41:11.358 --> 41:15.861
Peter McCullough, they're all playing the same script.

41:16.141 --> 41:20.044
Even Mary Talley Bowden, like it or not, is playing the same script.

41:20.124 --> 41:26.368
That's why she's never questioned the idea that they have a PCR test that can test for 17 different viruses.

41:26.408 --> 41:27.289
Of course they can.

41:32.412 --> 41:38.196
All children have X of these monoclonal antibodies.

41:38.956 --> 41:39.877
It would not be right

41:41.072 --> 41:52.859
because these are expensive products that only well-insured children, or in families that are well-insured, have access to this product.

41:52.959 --> 41:54.680
It's their volume that's low, sorry.

41:55.941 --> 42:07.308
I think we've all discussed the fact that this is an effective product, and I would strongly encourage everyone to make it available to all children.

42:08.149 --> 42:19.094
Yeah, Cody, I just was surprised because this language was not in our briefing document for approved language for voting.

42:19.654 --> 42:22.916
But I saw on the prior screen that was just displayed.

42:25.178 --> 42:39.471
I know my confusion is resolved because the issue here is just the nuance of similar approval, but specifically for the VFC program, if I'm understanding correctly.

42:39.511 --> 42:40.132
Is that the case?

42:41.519 --> 42:55.143
I can clarify, so typically after a vote occurs on the recommended product, then there is a resolution by the committee to add that to the formulary for the FC program.

42:55.363 --> 42:56.604
Thank you for the clarification.

42:57.484 --> 42:58.524
Malone votes yes.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.246
Malone votes yes, over.

43:03.126 --> 43:04.706
This is Malone votes yes, over.

43:04.806 --> 43:06.287
Malone votes yes, over.

43:07.955 --> 43:09.837
We'll hold on a little bit.

43:09.957 --> 43:12.058
Dr. Daskalakis.

43:12.158 --> 43:13.379
Totally just a point of order.

43:13.479 --> 43:18.944
I'm not sure if we necessarily have a motion to approve and a second on this vote yet.

43:19.364 --> 43:22.967
So you may want to do that as well.

43:23.427 --> 43:24.088
Did you hear that?

43:24.168 --> 43:26.349
So we don't have a motion to approve it yet.

43:26.369 --> 43:29.532
So it's all got to be done by parliamentary procedure.

43:29.552 --> 43:30.152
Otherwise,

43:31.093 --> 43:32.774
otherwise it doesn't become official.

43:32.814 --> 43:36.816
And so they're kind of clowning here and people keep trying to clue them in on it.

43:36.856 --> 43:37.816
That guy's now doing it.

43:37.956 --> 43:40.978
It's pretty impressive actually, because again, this is a ritual.

43:41.518 --> 43:46.700
It is due process that allows these things to then be essentially law, right?

43:46.741 --> 43:52.583
Because if they are on the vaccine schedule for kids, then insurance companies are required to pay for them.

43:52.663 --> 43:53.424
It's impressive.

43:54.484 --> 43:59.488
about 50% of American children get their vaccines and immunizations through VFC.

43:59.508 --> 44:01.270
So that's the background.

44:01.310 --> 44:01.610
Thank you.

44:01.950 --> 44:02.551
Yeah.

44:02.651 --> 44:04.252
Malone moves.

44:07.315 --> 44:07.615
Okay.

44:08.476 --> 44:08.896
I second.

44:11.258 --> 44:12.519
So now they're fighting over it.

44:12.559 --> 44:17.203
So now that was Martin saying, well, then I motion to approve this.

44:17.263 --> 44:19.445
And then Malone was going to say, I motion.

44:19.465 --> 44:20.686
And then he said, oh, I second it.

44:21.365 --> 44:25.248
And so they're all just trying to get in on the parliamentary procedure because it's so fun.

44:26.309 --> 44:30.272
While voting, can you please state your name, whether you have conflict of interest, and then you vote.

44:30.693 --> 44:31.674
Malone votes yes.

44:32.374 --> 44:35.317
And do you have a conflict of interest?

44:35.437 --> 44:36.477
No conflict of interest.

44:37.779 --> 44:38.139
Thank you.

44:38.679 --> 44:39.200
Dr. Hibblen.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.903
Dr. Hibblen first appreciates the clarification.

44:43.823 --> 44:45.285
Secondly, I vote yes.

44:45.925 --> 44:47.827
Third, I have no conflicts of interest.

44:48.748 --> 44:49.449
Dr. Pagano?

44:49.829 --> 44:53.252
I vote yes and no complications, no contradictions.

44:53.753 --> 44:54.333
And your name?

44:55.575 --> 44:58.457
No complications, no contradictions, he said.

45:00.940 --> 45:02.261
These people are clowns.

45:02.281 --> 45:03.022
James Pagano.

45:04.110 --> 45:07.211
Okay, so let's support it then because he has, he just wants access.

45:07.291 --> 45:14.854
He's, he's kind of naive to the fact that if it's on the schedule or it's on the vaccines for kids schedule that some majority of doctors are just going to push it.

45:34.278 --> 45:35.018
Dr. Meissner?

45:36.519 --> 45:41.680
Cody Meissner votes yes, and I have no conflict.

45:41.720 --> 45:42.280
Dr. Papsworth?

45:47.202 --> 45:47.602
Sorry.

45:52.343 --> 45:57.725
Sorry, I vote yes, and I believe that I am required to read a statement.

45:57.905 --> 46:03.807
I don't know whether I have a conflict or not.

46:04.622 --> 46:08.125
but it's as required.

46:08.205 --> 46:11.647
Yeah, somebody's laughing about whether or not she has a conflict or not.

46:11.807 --> 46:23.095
And now she's gonna tell you that she's not holding, she's holding the legal limit of the amount of stock that she can own and still serve on the committee.

46:23.676 --> 46:25.997
And so she's not gonna tell you how much that is.

46:26.358 --> 46:28.940
She's just gonna tell you that she's under that amount, which is,

46:29.620 --> 46:31.481
an extraordinary admission.

46:31.661 --> 46:33.262
It's just, it's just gross.

46:33.322 --> 46:35.184
This whole thing is so pro forma.

46:35.224 --> 46:38.105
It's like a, it's, it's a joke on our grandkids.

46:38.586 --> 46:40.987
Under the ACIP policies and procedures.

46:41.067 --> 46:51.774
I'm also disclosing that I own shares in the healthcare sector fund that includes holdings relative relevant to the ACIP, including vaccine manufacturers,

46:52.386 --> 47:10.672
However, the amount of that shareholding is- My guess is, is that for purposes of immunity to manufacturing problems and that kind of thing, I would be willing to bet that getting them on the Vaccines for Children CDC list allows them to avoid that liability.

47:10.692 --> 47:12.013
But I don't know, I'm not a lawyer.

47:12.113 --> 47:13.573
I don't even play one on the internet.

47:13.593 --> 47:14.674
But thanks for the question.

47:14.714 --> 47:15.494
Sorry, Catherine.

47:15.534 --> 47:17.495
Sorry, Oseen.

47:18.055 --> 47:18.875
I don't know how to say it.

47:19.215 --> 47:21.336
Under the Office of Government Ethics,

47:22.006 --> 47:29.593
regulatory de minimis amount, I understand that I, therefore, can fully participate in the ACIP meeting.

47:32.355 --> 47:32.735
Thank you.

47:32.755 --> 47:33.476
Can you state your name?

47:35.057 --> 47:36.018
Vicky Pubsworth.

47:36.578 --> 47:36.959
Thank you.

47:37.499 --> 47:38.740
My name is Martin Kulldorff.

47:38.900 --> 47:41.603
I have no conflict of interest, and I vote yes.

47:43.467 --> 47:46.928
So we have a vote of seven to zero on this.

47:46.968 --> 47:47.749
So thank you.

47:48.489 --> 47:55.311
And again, I really want to stress thank you very much for the working group for the enormously thorough work you've done.

47:55.391 --> 47:57.552
Thank you for the CDC staff.

47:58.532 --> 48:09.957
And especially thank you for my fellow members of this group who at very short notice have really emerged yourself into this issue.

48:16.336 --> 48:35.887
I mean you have to say it right I mean if he's Swedish then it makes it even worse in a way because Sweden was one of those places that they used also against us in some way or another didn't have really lockdowns and so it's just all just very disturbing to me I think 16 days ago so

48:39.325 --> 48:51.596
There was a very short time to very quickly get all the information that was needed, both presentations yesterday but also a lot of information in addition to this.

48:51.656 --> 48:52.877
So thank you so much.

48:55.063 --> 48:57.724
Dr. Kulldorff, can I make one comment?

48:57.844 --> 49:12.131
I would just like to recognize the contributions of Jefferson Jones who has led the workgroup throughout this procedure and has just done an exemplary job.

49:12.911 --> 49:13.111
Over.

49:14.672 --> 49:16.233
Thank you and I should also state

49:19.358 --> 49:25.740
You know who is Indian and has been in America for a really long time and I'm pretty sure is a traitor to my grandkids?

49:26.060 --> 49:29.301
It's Jayanta Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH.

49:29.842 --> 49:35.564
And they were together on the Great Barrington Agreement with some chick from Oxford.

49:36.224 --> 49:46.455
So as far as I'm concerned, being in America for a really long time doesn't make you any less of a foreigner, especially if the whole idea for you to do is to play a role like this.

49:47.356 --> 49:51.740
Then just like Jayant Bhattacharya, who did all of his degrees at Stanford,

49:52.741 --> 49:58.826
Um, you know, just like the lady that we're confirming for CDC director who did all of her degrees at Stanford.

49:59.367 --> 50:03.831
Just like this guy who's just, you know, he works at Harvard, but he's a good guy.

50:03.931 --> 50:04.851
Gotta be a good guy.

50:04.891 --> 50:07.854
Cause there's no, not everybody at Harvard's a shithead.

50:08.655 --> 50:10.396
Um, it's just, it's, I don't know.

50:10.536 --> 50:12.558
I don't know what to tell you anymore, but, uh,

50:14.044 --> 50:24.849
I've got a viewer who claims to have been able to have regular communication with him, and that's fallen apart pretty drastically since Jay Bhattacharya got into NIH.

50:24.869 --> 50:32.193
And that's because they can't really, they can't have an interaction anymore because of how this guy just doesn't seem to be able to see it.

50:34.314 --> 50:42.878
It's hard to accept that America has been victimized by a Trojan horse, that people like Mary Holland are actually traitors, but it's true.

50:43.604 --> 50:44.785
It's really true.

50:45.945 --> 50:47.046
So thank you very much.

50:49.767 --> 50:59.953
So I just want to encourage our CDC colleagues to, we have post-marketing data now.

51:00.213 --> 51:10.699
I think we should hopefully see soon analysis on regarding deaths and more broad kind of analysis on broader set of potential adverse events.

51:11.460 --> 51:19.186
Again, I think we want to make sure that alongside the benefits, we understand the risks, regardless of the decisions of whether to use it or not.

51:19.206 --> 51:22.529
We need to have transparency about what is the trade-off here.

51:22.989 --> 51:29.915
And I think that the analysis yesterday was very, very well done, but limited to certain periods of time and certain

51:30.555 --> 51:32.836
And so this is, again, remember, not for us.

51:32.896 --> 51:42.319
This is supposed to appeal to people who don't know who these people are, who haven't been arguing with these people for five years, who don't know who Robert Malone is, but it sounds like he's a dude who might know a lot.

51:42.939 --> 51:45.200
That's the whole illusion they're trying to pull off here.

51:51.943 --> 51:55.164
So this is where they left off as far as when I was watching.

51:56.224 --> 51:58.725
Talking about the flu from somebody from Sandvoort.

52:00.014 --> 52:02.015
So good morning, I'm Dr. Pedro Felagatti.

52:02.055 --> 52:04.915
I'm a Global Clinical Development Director at Sanofi.

52:05.235 --> 52:12.478
And today I'm joined by my colleague, Dr. Tinus Meret, North America Medical Head for Influenza and COVID Vaccines.

52:13.178 --> 52:14.518
I'll be presenting today.

52:14.598 --> 52:16.539
So why doesn't it say Sanofi on here?

52:16.619 --> 52:18.399
Why doesn't it say that on his slide?

52:18.519 --> 52:18.999
Oh, there it is.

52:19.039 --> 52:20.000
Sorry, it's right behind me.

52:20.060 --> 52:20.980
Sanofi, there you go.

52:21.590 --> 52:28.416
So he sells a quadrivalent flu vaccine and he's going to present what again?

52:28.917 --> 52:32.920
The results of our phase 3 immunobridging non-inferiority trial.

52:34.001 --> 52:37.805
Phase 3 immunobridging non-inferiority trial.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.827
The absolute most absurd

52:42.327 --> 52:46.630
scientific idea that you can really enunciate with English words.

52:46.950 --> 53:05.961
And now Retsif Levy and Robert Malone and all these other hypergeniuses are going to sit there and listen to a presentation from some guy from Sanofi who's on the influenza working group for the ACIP meeting and telling you about the immunobridging to non-inferiority

53:07.640 --> 53:09.582
of a quadrivalent flu vaccine.

53:09.762 --> 53:12.445
And we're supposed to believe, again, that this is a victory, right?

53:12.485 --> 53:14.027
Because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:14.487 --> 53:16.189
is at the head of HHS.

53:16.869 --> 53:24.457
And the head of FDA is getting rid of all the petroleum-based dyes in Heinz ketchup and in all Nestle products within a year.

53:24.897 --> 53:31.124
So if there's anything about this that isn't winning, it's just that most of us haven't gotten the T-shirt yet.

53:31.764 --> 53:39.611
of the quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine which is licensed as flu block in older children and adolescents compared to adults.

53:40.492 --> 53:41.232
Next slide please.

53:43.834 --> 53:48.939
For full disclosure of my conflicts... And so you don't need any convincing that this is bullshit.

53:49.019 --> 53:51.221
I'm gonna give you a little music break here

53:52.231 --> 53:55.634
And then we're gonna get on with the show.

53:55.654 --> 53:59.736
I hadn't picked anything out yet though.

53:59.796 --> 54:01.458
Did I have anything lined up there?

54:02.118 --> 54:03.219
Maybe I'll just do this one.

54:03.279 --> 54:04.360
Thank you very much for being here.

54:04.420 --> 54:04.760
See you soon.

54:20.970 --> 54:22.631
think, but you can tell if someone's lying.

55:09.709 --> 55:11.478
Millionaire.

55:40.511 --> 55:41.574
Send you down to war

56:17.603 --> 56:18.724
It's a great track.

56:19.544 --> 56:20.164
Welcome back.

56:20.905 --> 56:21.545
Good to be here.

56:21.565 --> 56:24.827
I'm very happy to be presenting today.

56:24.847 --> 56:26.228
I feel pretty good.

56:26.988 --> 56:31.831
I figured out that actually aspirin works much better than I thought for pain relief.

56:32.956 --> 56:37.561
And so, I actually was able to shoot around yesterday.

56:37.621 --> 56:38.742
I put 100 shots up.

56:38.802 --> 56:40.865
I'm not saying that I was bouncing out of the gym.

56:41.986 --> 56:44.188
There was some pain, but today it's a little better.

56:45.489 --> 56:50.515
I haven't taken as many milligrams as today as I did yesterday, and so I'm already dialing it back.

56:51.496 --> 56:53.998
But I feel very good about the fact that I'm not, you know, I'm

56:56.046 --> 56:57.967
I feel like it's now healing, which is good.

56:58.428 --> 57:03.292
It is just back pain is something I wouldn't wish on anybody except for some of the people in this picture.

57:04.813 --> 57:05.814
There's my buddy Nathan.

57:06.294 --> 57:07.115
Rest in peace, bud.

57:07.996 --> 57:08.956
This is just crazy.

57:09.337 --> 57:13.860
A disaster for rural America, a disaster for low income and working class people.

57:14.481 --> 57:22.708
We must not devastate an already broken health care system in order to give tax breaks to billionaires who have never ever had it so good.

57:23.328 --> 57:24.129
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

57:26.513 --> 57:26.853
Thank you.

57:27.154 --> 57:29.776
Dr. Menorrez, your opening statement, please.

57:38.184 --> 57:51.356
Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and members of this committee, I am humbled to be here today before you, and I am honored to be nominated by the President to be the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

57:52.830 --> 58:00.812
I'm joined by my friends and my family, including my children, Bella and AJ, who are my inspiration in all things.

58:01.212 --> 58:01.352
Oh.

58:02.533 --> 58:04.193
I want to start by telling you about myself.

58:05.453 --> 58:08.894
I grew up in rural Wisconsin, the daughter of a dairy farmer.

58:10.275 --> 58:13.236
I learned the meaning of hard work very early in life.

58:14.516 --> 58:20.097
When illness struck our herd, my father had to sell the farm and he became a police officer.

58:21.538 --> 58:21.998
Oh, what?

58:24.026 --> 58:25.987
I would like to hear more about that.

58:26.248 --> 58:34.392
That when illness struck our herd, my father had to sell the farm and he became a police officer.

58:34.532 --> 58:37.714
That sounds strange to me.

58:42.177 --> 58:43.638
I mean, I'm just saying it sounds strange.

58:43.678 --> 58:45.178
I don't know if that means she's a bad guy.

58:45.218 --> 58:46.279
Of course she's a bad guy.

58:46.299 --> 58:47.740
She worked for DARPA and ARPA.

58:47.820 --> 58:50.722
She helped build ARPA, ARPA-H.

58:50.982 --> 58:52.263
Like this woman is,

58:53.328 --> 58:58.231
is a direct descendant from Joe Biden's administration that developed ARPA-H.

58:58.392 --> 59:04.576
Like, how is it possible that we're ignoring the fact that she is the confirmed CDC director?

59:04.636 --> 59:06.237
Listen to this diatribe.

59:06.477 --> 59:07.037
To support us.

59:08.558 --> 59:15.543
My mother also worked wherever she could, in factories, clerical jobs, and my favorite, as a librarian.

59:17.024 --> 59:22.328
Though we didn't own a television, we always had the world at our fingertips through books.

59:23.553 --> 59:32.197
Hard work, community resilience, fiscal responsibility, and the importance of education are the core values this upbringing instilled.

59:33.258 --> 59:41.642
We had little money, so through academic scholarships and side jobs, I paid my own way through college, attending the University of Wisconsin.

59:42.723 --> 59:52.408
It was here during my first semester, at the dawn of the genomics era, that I discovered a passion for science and health innovation, and I have not stopped since.

59:53.041 --> 59:55.003
The dawn of the genomics era.

59:55.023 --> 59:57.745
You see, she walked right in exactly when she wanted to.

59:57.785 --> 59:59.106
It's so lucky for her.

59:59.126 --> 01:00:05.391
I earned my PhD in microbiology and immunology and conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford.

01:00:06.727 --> 01:00:17.494
My academic work focused on two deadly diseases, African sleeping sickness, which in its most severe forms is 100% fatal without treatment.

01:00:18.475 --> 01:00:23.598
And toxoplasmosis, once a leading cause of death in HIV AIDS patients.

01:00:23.758 --> 01:00:24.219
There it is.

01:00:24.379 --> 01:00:24.739
Oh, sorry.

01:00:24.779 --> 01:00:25.579
I buzzed over it.

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:26.420
I buzzed over it.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:26.700
Sorry.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.281
But did you hear it?

01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:30.262
It's a leading cause of death.

01:00:31.543 --> 01:00:34.986
Toxoplasmosis is a leading cause of death in HIV patients.

01:00:35.762 --> 01:00:37.163
That's one of the things she worked on.

01:00:37.203 --> 01:00:55.970
So unlike myself or Mark, so many of these people have an absolute direct line mentorship connection to the HIV narrative and have done significant work contributing to its edification.

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:58.651
It's almost without fail.

01:00:59.807 --> 01:01:13.023
that every person that is in this narrative has walked through or been trained by somebody who has a direct line to Bob Gallo, to Murray Gardner, to Tony Fauci, to Francis Collins, all these people.

01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:16.126
It's remarkable.

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:17.328
It's crazy.

01:01:18.499 --> 01:01:39.543
And it holds true also for somebody like Paul Offit, who connects himself directly to Stanley Plotkin and Hilary Koprowski, calls Hilary Koprowski a hero, included Hilary Koprowski in his Vax Hero card set from the CHOP Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

01:01:39.603 --> 01:01:44.423
They made a Vax Hero card set that you could order by mail.

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:46.604
And Hilary Koprowski is one of the cards.

01:01:47.444 --> 01:01:48.184
I shit you not.

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:59.973
So all of these people are descended from the same group of men that had these big ideas about genetics and taking control of the human species and the evolution of it.

01:02:02.074 --> 01:02:07.075
And this lady is directly descended from these people, trained at Stanford.

01:02:08.815 --> 01:02:14.517
in infectious diseases now at the head of the CDC after helping to establish ARPA-H.

01:02:15.017 --> 01:02:35.425
How much more malevolent could this script be if the vast majority of the people who would have any objection to her at all are busy watching Robert Malone and Retzif Levy and Martin Kulldorff performing for two days straight on the ACIP meeting just saying yes and doing parliamentary procedure shows?

01:02:36.745 --> 01:02:38.066
This worked for over a decade.

01:02:39.144 --> 01:02:58.811
While treatments for African sleeping sickness and toxoplasmosis remain limited, public health advancements like screening and prevention programs have addressed toxoplasmosis, one of two deadly diseases, African sleeping sickness, which in its most severe forms is 100% fatal without treatment.

01:02:59.811 --> 01:03:04.833
And toxoplasmosis, once a leading cause of death in HIV AIDS patients.

01:03:05.973 --> 01:03:07.514
I did this work for over a decade

01:03:08.595 --> 01:03:20.148
While treatments for African sleeping sickness and toxoplasmosis remain limited, public health advancements like screening and prevention programs have drastically reduced the burden of both diseases.

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.433
These experiences cemented my belief.

01:03:25.695 --> 01:03:28.218
Good public health saves lives.

01:03:30.316 --> 01:03:33.901
After academia, I shifted to shaping public health policy at the federal level.

01:03:34.702 --> 01:03:40.789
I helped establish the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, prioritizing investments in medical countermeasures.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:47.297
At the Department of Homeland Security, I led efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to the world's deadliest pathogens.

01:03:48.396 --> 01:03:54.261
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, priority prioritizing investments.

01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:58.404
And after academia, I shifted to shaping public health policy at the federal level.

01:03:59.204 --> 01:04:05.309
I helped establish the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, prioritizing investments in medical countermeasures.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.651
Isn't that BARDA?

01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:08.651
Isn't that BARDA?

01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:10.012
Didn't she just say BARDA?

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.835
I swear that she just says BARDA.

01:04:12.895 --> 01:04:16.738
I led efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to the world's deadliest pathogens.

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:23.134
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, I served on the Ebola task force.

01:04:23.495 --> 01:04:32.962
That's weird because I think also, I think also, I think also Stephen Hatfield was involved in Ebola.

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:35.784
I think also Robert Malone was involved in Ebola.

01:04:35.824 --> 01:04:36.485
Can you imagine?

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.586
They might even know each other.

01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:38.807
Maybe they all know each other.

01:04:39.768 --> 01:04:46.053
Here I saw the incredible work of public health, but I also saw the vulnerabilities in communication,

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:50.352
outbreak modeling, and global health security preparedness.

01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:55.096
When public health is neglected, it costs lives.

01:04:56.377 --> 01:05:07.807
Finally, during my time at ARPA-H, I led efforts to develop high-risk, high-reward breakthroughs in AI technologies, regenerative medicine, cancer diagnostics, and healthcare tools to support rural areas.

01:05:09.788 --> 01:05:12.530
Health technology innovation is America's next frontier.

01:05:13.683 --> 01:05:18.884
by investing in innovators and entrepreneurs, we will save lives and drive economic growth.

01:05:19.145 --> 01:05:19.525
Wow.

01:05:19.745 --> 01:05:23.886
But these advancements will- Save lives and drive economic growth.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:26.887
It's like everybody's on the same script of progress.

01:05:26.987 --> 01:05:30.948
It's remarkable how little we're paying attention to this.

01:05:32.517 --> 01:05:44.586
will only be effective if we invest in public health infrastructure that enables them to be utilized on a population scale.

01:05:45.686 --> 01:05:50.910
What good is a potentially life-saving discovery if there is no translation to make it usable?

01:05:51.931 --> 01:05:53.672
That's where CDC plays a vital role.

01:05:54.653 --> 01:05:56.294
Outbreaks are only getting more frequent.

01:05:57.159 --> 01:06:07.605
There's Ebola and Mpox in Africa, MERS in the Middle East, Zika and Arupush in South America, and now H5N1, avian influenza across nearly every continent.

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:14.308
These- So much so that they killed all the chickens in Canada already and they're gonna vaccinate all the chickens in America.

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:15.749
Scary, scary.

01:06:16.289 --> 01:06:19.071
These threats are in our backyard or always just a flight away.

01:06:20.721 --> 01:06:22.422
Always just a flight away.

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:25.504
In case you don't know how it works, maybe you haven't seen the movie Contagion.

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:34.168
Or maybe you haven't seen the beginning of the Planet of the Apes, the new version, because there they also have a nice little two-minute montage about how viruses can travel around the world.

01:06:34.684 --> 01:06:39.247
CDC must be fully prepared to defend the American people from these known biological risks.

01:06:39.847 --> 01:06:44.830
And as importantly- I wonder if she considers opioids a biological risk to anybody.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.310
I'm curious about that.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:49.692
That's funny because I haven't heard much about that.

01:06:49.752 --> 01:06:54.095
She's pretty focused on them, their diseases.

01:06:54.415 --> 01:06:58.097
Be prepared to defend against those we have not yet seen.

01:06:58.577 --> 01:06:59.638
Whoa, scary.

01:07:00.358 --> 01:07:03.360
If confirmed, I will focus CDC on three top priorities.

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.912
The first is restoring trust.

01:07:06.853 --> 01:07:11.477
I will rebuild credibility by making CDC leadership more public facing and accountable.

01:07:12.058 --> 01:07:14.640
Oh man, wouldn't it be cool if they did a podcast too?

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.902
Because that makes me feel great about the FDA.

01:07:16.942 --> 01:07:27.311
That's the only reason why I trust Marty and Vinay is because they're regularly being painfully transparent on their podcast with John A or whatever her name is.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:32.038
data transparency with a focus on protecting patient privacy and security.

01:07:32.058 --> 01:07:37.870
I will ensure all recommendations are backed by publicly available gold standard science.

01:07:40.576 --> 01:07:49.141
Don't forget that right now, gold standard science includes using PCR to find more than 17 different viral pathogens in one test.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:55.664
Don't forget that PCR can also be used to diagnose a wide variety of genetic causes of, I don't know, stuff.

01:07:56.184 --> 01:08:00.387
And so genetic sequencing is something you shouldn't be afraid of, you should embrace.

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:04.709
Don't forget, don't forget, coming to your doctor soon.

01:08:05.151 --> 01:08:11.377
In strengthening public health infrastructure, we must invest in innovation to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:12.758
Is his name Vinayak?

01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:13.900
Okay, Vinayak.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.761
I'll call him Vinayak from now on.

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:19.865
I will prioritize near real-time situational awareness to detect outbreaks early.

01:08:20.686 --> 01:08:26.688
I will prioritize bringing state-of-the-art technologies to CDC, including our labs and diagnostic development.

01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:34.311
I will work with state and local public health officials to help build a modernized public health infrastructure across the country.

01:08:34.991 --> 01:08:41.674
I will support a precision preventive health operational model to offer tailored health strategy to meet the needs of all Americans.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:50.825
So this is starting to sound like personalized medicine a little bit and also building a public health network that's modern sounds quite scary.

01:08:51.366 --> 01:09:00.695
Maybe even building a data infrastructure so that medical records could be shared in real time and we could monitor real time diagnosis of stuff.

01:09:00.755 --> 01:09:03.357
Maybe all that stuff is gonna be integrated in her idea.

01:09:03.878 --> 01:09:06.981
Third, evidence-based rapid decision-making.

01:09:08.325 --> 01:09:11.695
We know the next outbreak is not a matter of if, but when.

01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:14.142
I have learned first- Did she say when?

01:09:15.174 --> 01:09:21.940
I think she said when, and because she said when, I have to go back and listen to her say when, because that's some remarkable shit.

01:09:23.081 --> 01:09:25.203
Nobody talks like that, in my humble opinion.

01:09:25.603 --> 01:09:26.564
Did she say when?

01:09:26.885 --> 01:09:29.907
First hand, crises demand clear plans and decisive action.

01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:30.648
She said when.

01:09:30.988 --> 01:09:34.411
I will implement the next outbreak is not a matter of if, but when.

01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:39.096
I learned first hand, crises demand clear plans and decisive action.

01:09:39.796 --> 01:09:51.525
I will implement tested, evidence-informed, predefined protocols to avoid confusion and delays, and strengthen risk communication so the public receives timely, consistent guidance based on fact, not fear.

01:09:52.246 --> 01:09:56.409
These priorities support the President's and the Secretary's vision of a healthier America.

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:01.113
To achieve them, I will lead with integrity, transparency, and purpose.

01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:05.795
and work with Congress to maximize health outcomes and protect the American people.

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:09.536
Thank you and the Secretary's vision of a healthier America.

01:10:10.557 --> 01:10:18.920
To achieve them, I will lead with integrity, transparency, and purpose and work with Congress to maximize health outcomes and protect the American people.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.282
Maximize, maximize health outcomes with Congress.

01:10:25.063 --> 01:10:28.524
I'm going to maximize health outcomes with Congress.

01:10:29.745 --> 01:10:30.545
Holy shit.

01:10:31.598 --> 01:10:36.344
Thank you for your time and for considering my nomination, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

01:10:36.785 --> 01:10:37.125
Thank you.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:40.510
I will actually defer to my Don Dias to begin with.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:41.251
Senator Paul.

01:10:42.032 --> 01:10:45.497
For me, the cool whip thing was family guy.

01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:46.037
Am I wrong?

01:10:46.077 --> 01:10:48.160
I thought that was family guy that did the cool whip.

01:10:48.901 --> 01:10:49.182
Anyway.

01:10:52.637 --> 01:11:04.548
I don't know who scripted her, but the same person who scripted her scripted Rand Paul.

01:11:04.568 --> 01:11:06.950
Let's hear what Rand Paul's got to say about the school.

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:11.888
him to take down three prominent scientists.

01:11:12.008 --> 01:11:17.635
The implication was, use whatever means, use the media, use reporters, but damage their reputations.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:23.843
One of these scientists is now the head of NIH, Jay Bhattacharya.

01:11:24.344 --> 01:11:26.226
Do you think that was an appropriate use of his office?

01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:43.525
So I'm not familiar with that particular encounter, but we need to make sure that we are open to letting the scientists... Is it an appropriate use of the office for Francis Collins to have emailed the head of NIH and say, take down scientists that he disagreed with?

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.787
We need to make sure that we are open.

01:11:46.107 --> 01:11:46.928
Isn't that wrong?

01:11:46.988 --> 01:11:50.450
I thought Francis Collins was the head of NIH and he emailed other people.

01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:53.432
So he's already saying it wrong, right?

01:11:53.532 --> 01:11:55.934
The head of NIH is now Jay Bhattacharya.

01:11:56.716 --> 01:11:57.836
Jayanta Bhattacharya.

01:11:57.876 --> 01:12:03.018
And before that, it was Francis Collins during the pandemic.

01:12:03.238 --> 01:12:07.340
And he emailed Tony Fauci, who was head of NIAID.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.161
It's interesting, but wrong.

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:12.922
It's sort of a yes or no question.

01:12:13.142 --> 01:12:14.623
Is it an appropriate use of office?

01:12:14.643 --> 01:12:18.244
Because the question goes, is it an appropriate use of the office?

01:12:18.284 --> 01:12:25.647
She's smiling because she knows this is part of the theater, that he's supposed to grill her and put pressure on her to admit that Fauci was a bad guy.

01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:30.884
to email other government scientists and say take them down.

01:12:31.304 --> 01:12:34.447
Take down these people that are disagreeing with us and have a different opinion.

01:12:34.867 --> 01:12:35.948
It is not something I would do.

01:12:36.869 --> 01:12:39.772
I welcome an open and honest debate and scientific discourse.

01:12:39.852 --> 01:12:42.654
I'm disappointed that we don't get a little better answer from that.

01:12:44.139 --> 01:12:45.961
What better answer could she give?

01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:48.184
What a joke of a theater this is.

01:12:48.284 --> 01:12:51.647
And she's obviously aware of how joke of a theater this is.

01:12:51.727 --> 01:12:52.348
Come on.

01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:56.212
You read OSTP, uh, 2015 to 2016.

01:12:56.853 --> 01:13:06.083
Was any of the research between Ralph Baric and, uh, with the Wuhan Institute of Virology subject to the pause on gain of function during your period of time there?

01:13:06.738 --> 01:13:16.586
I don't know the specific details of that, but all federally funded research that met the standards of gain of function should have been paused under that gain of function pause.

01:13:16.906 --> 01:13:18.887
Right, but several were granted exemptions.

01:13:18.987 --> 01:13:21.930
Are you aware of an exemption that was granted to the Wuhan research?

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:33.719
Can you imagine that in 2025, that at the CDC director's confirmation hearing, just think about it for a second, who was the head of the CDC during the pandemic?

01:13:33.759 --> 01:13:35.300
We're talking about somebody like

01:13:38.777 --> 01:13:39.718
Rochelle Walensky.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.041
Like, what are we talking about here?

01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:45.904
Also a person who worked at Harvard, also a person who worked on AIDS.

01:13:50.839 --> 01:14:12.230
It's a continuous line of these people who are either indoctrinated acolytes or indoctrinated agents who understand the illusion of consensus about this biology that they are maintaining and given their own little section of the narrative to curate, you know, like African sleeping sickness or toxoplasmosis as it applies to HIV.

01:14:12.671 --> 01:14:16.533
And then once they have their little expertise, they can start to be paraded around in these

01:14:17.193 --> 01:14:29.838
in these pseudo-intellectual circles to be grilled by these scripted lawmakers, who are scripted because of course they are part of the same national security theater that these actors are.

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:39.322
And once you see that the only way a national security theater like this would work is if it enlisted the people who have classified access to begin with,

01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:48.953
Then you understand why even the election of these people might be needing of controlling because it's part of a national security imperative to do so.

01:14:50.894 --> 01:14:51.754
I am not aware of that.

01:14:53.095 --> 01:15:00.320
Do you believe that the research that was being done over that period of time and subsequently was gain of function research?

01:15:01.528 --> 01:15:06.531
I haven't had an opportunity to look at the research, but I share your concerns about gain of consciousness.

01:15:06.811 --> 01:15:09.633
No, I think she was working at ARPA-H before this.

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:13.736
So, you know, I mean, she's got every reason to know what happened during the pandemic.

01:15:14.156 --> 01:15:14.896
Written about it.

01:15:14.916 --> 01:15:16.297
I mean, we've been talking about it.

01:15:16.317 --> 01:15:17.818
15 million people died.

01:15:17.958 --> 01:15:20.980
See, what we're trying to do is recite the narrative.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.561
So he's reciting the narrative.

01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:26.543
Aren't you aware that everybody on social media accepts the following?

01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:27.524
And then he lists them all.

01:15:28.496 --> 01:15:32.500
And she can say, well, I'm not sure about all that stuff, but then he's going to list them all again.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.681
You're aware of this, right?

01:15:33.721 --> 01:15:34.302
And that, right?

01:15:34.322 --> 01:15:38.506
You're aware of the novel virus and that it killed millions and that millions more were saved.

01:15:39.007 --> 01:15:41.990
And that if we don't regulate gain of function, another one could come again.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.091
You're aware of that, right?

01:15:44.244 --> 01:15:46.365
You're going to be in charge of infectious disease.

01:15:46.405 --> 01:15:51.707
You know, you think you might have an opinion on, you know, where this came from and what happened.

01:15:52.528 --> 01:16:05.793
And, you know, even EcoHealth, which was funding the research in Wuhan, finally sends a letter back to NIH and they say, thank you for releasing the pause on our gain of function research.

01:16:06.534 --> 01:16:13.177
And so there's going to be no discussion of the half a million odd Americans that died as a result of the

01:16:14.133 --> 01:16:41.736
Whatever you want to call it, it's a drug disaster on American streets, in American families, that have left grandkids with grandmothers and grandfathers, have ruined families, and lowered the life expectancy of America in a way that the novel virus could never have done because there is no novel virus.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:46.931
It is a purposeful managing of the American population problem.

01:16:46.951 --> 01:17:02.755
The American population was set up and people like this have no real sympathy for the people who might fall into the trap of opioids for one reason or another because they are managing a problem like a prison guard would think of the prison population.

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:10.768
They are thinking of us a lot more like farm animals and they are on the managing end of things.

01:17:10.828 --> 01:17:21.173
And so, you know, you're not gonna understand all the choices that they have to make, all the trade-offs that they have to make in their daily lives in order to perform this theater.

01:17:21.213 --> 01:17:31.697
But I assure you, this guy imagines that the trade-offs that he is making for his family and for the future of his family are the best trade-offs to make.

01:17:31.878 --> 01:17:34.679
And part of those trade-offs are to perform this theater.

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:40.243
Because he is, it's impossible that he doesn't know it's a theater.

01:17:40.403 --> 01:17:49.190
Otherwise, his incredible lack of progress from 2020 until now, where he's still saying, did you see me on the news in 2020?

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:50.871
Just in case, should we play it again?

01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:54.554
Do you want me to tell you what I said on the news in 2020?

01:17:54.614 --> 01:17:55.815
Because I can say it again.

01:17:57.616 --> 01:17:59.358
It's no different than what he's doing right now.

01:18:02.338 --> 01:18:10.645
With regard to royalties, recently Secretary Kennedy fired members of the CDC Vaccine Committee.

01:18:10.805 --> 01:18:16.990
Now we're going to talk about royalties and the fact that they're buying people off and that's why this is all happening because people make money.

01:18:17.711 --> 01:18:19.112
Stop lying!

01:18:19.352 --> 01:18:20.513
It's so bad.

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:22.195
It's so bad.

01:18:23.186 --> 01:18:40.281
The only people who could fall for it are people who don't know already that this guy has been acting with them for five years, that don't know who Robert Malone is, and have no idea that this lady is part of the same malevolent show, because this malevolent show is gonna capture everyone if they have their way.

01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:46.966
Robert Malone is gonna play a great role in capturing everyone, not just us.

01:18:47.467 --> 01:18:48.748
His job with us is done.

01:18:51.479 --> 01:18:58.684
One of the things we've been asking for for years is that they release their and reveal if they get royalties from pharma.

01:18:59.024 --> 01:19:01.406
I think this is a basic good government request.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:06.128
We've passed it unanimously in another Senate committee with Republican and Democrat support.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:13.813
Previous heads of the CDC and the Biden administration were adamantly opposed to revealing or any transparency.

01:19:14.494 --> 01:19:15.414
Will you support

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:23.720
members, all members in decision-making processes revealing their royalties that they get from pharmaceutical companies?

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:38.309
I believe that anyone who is serving in this type of a role that is so critically important to make independent, conflict-free decisions needs to be fully transparent on any funding that they're getting from any product developer.

01:19:41.351 --> 01:19:41.952
That's all I have.

01:19:43.192 --> 01:19:43.893
Senator Sanders.

01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:46.935
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:19:49.236 --> 01:20:04.021
Um, Dr. Manara's, um, today's secretary Kennedy announced that he will be ending us funding for the global alliance for vaccines and immunizations.

01:20:05.642 --> 01:20:06.462
Oh my gosh.

01:20:06.522 --> 01:20:12.024
They're ending the funding for Gabby until Gabby gets their, their act together.

01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:18.013
What will this nominated woman for CDC director think of that travesty?

01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:19.094
Oh my goodness.

01:20:21.155 --> 01:20:26.720
You just a moment ago said that you believe, as I do, that public health saves lives.

01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:28.962
Ending U.S.

01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:36.829
funding, according to the Global Alliance, will lead to 1.2 million preventable deaths.

01:20:37.429 --> 01:20:40.392
1.2 million kids will die if we don't give Gavi their money.

01:20:41.829 --> 01:20:48.733
agree with Secretary Kennedy that we should end our support for providing life-saving vaccines around the world?

01:20:50.534 --> 01:20:56.938
I believe that global health security preparedness is a critical and vital activity for the United States.

01:20:57.198 --> 01:21:03.782
As I shared in my opening remarks, I saw firsthand what happens when you have- You did, and I agree with you.

01:21:04.603 --> 01:21:10.366
My question, though, is do you think we should end our support for providing life-saving vaccines around the world?

01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:12.550
I think vaccines save lives.

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:17.373
I think that we need to continue to support the promotion of utilization of vaccines.

01:21:17.934 --> 01:21:19.755
I wasn't involved in that decision making.

01:21:20.155 --> 01:21:24.358
If I'm confirmed as a CDC director, I will certainly look into it, and I'm happy to follow up with you.

01:21:25.979 --> 01:21:26.299
Thank you.

01:21:26.579 --> 01:21:29.602
Doctor, the American Medical Association

01:21:30.509 --> 01:21:42.202
has adopted a policy that recognizes the substantial body of scientific evidence that has disproven a link between vaccines and autism.

01:21:43.837 --> 01:21:55.204
President of the American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that any effort to undermine decades of research, finding no link between vaccines and autism, quote, poses a threat to the health of children and our nation.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:56.285
End of quote.

01:21:56.305 --> 01:22:04.270
Do you agree with the American Medical Association that there is no scientific proven link between vaccines and autism?

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:07.652
I have not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.

01:22:08.649 --> 01:22:10.670
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:30.905
No causal link between vaccines and autism, but I can tell you right now there is a causal link between the appearance of a pandemic and the population pyramid because there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was converted into an illusion of a pandemic by using simple, non-specific PCR tests to convert an irreducible background

01:22:31.425 --> 01:22:33.947
into something that they said was spreading.

01:22:34.307 --> 01:22:46.134
This anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was threatening to bankrupt some of our Western nations and certainly threatening to change the demographics of our countries if we don't immigrate enough people to fill in the bottom.

01:22:46.614 --> 01:22:48.636
That's really what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:49.176 --> 01:22:55.120
Something that was anticipated was sculpted using murder and lies and then they put clowns like Denny Rancor out there

01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:03.267
to write papers with 150 figures to disguise that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality as something that was caused by the shots.

01:23:04.088 --> 01:23:05.389
And of course, that's nonsense.

01:23:05.469 --> 01:23:13.757
Otherwise, this graph wouldn't exist of America losing control of respiratory disease for a couple years and then figuring it out again at the end of 2022.

01:23:14.397 --> 01:23:16.559
That's because they murdered people.

01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:19.042
And one of the craftiest ways they did it

01:23:19.602 --> 01:23:25.646
is by giving people supplementary oxygen when they came in the hospital and pretending that that's not really a toxic thing.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:31.610
When in fact, before the pandemic, it was known that you couldn't just give people oxygen willy-nilly.

01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:35.293
That's why oxygen bars went in and out so quick as they did.

01:23:36.013 --> 01:23:45.500
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth, both as a process and an endpoint, and you need to believe in endemicity in order for this narrative to exist.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.743
And that's why they say that racism is endemic in America.

01:23:49.243 --> 01:23:53.066
If you're using PCR tests to find any of their ghosts, including the 17 PCR tests

01:23:55.107 --> 01:24:01.731
targets that Mary Talley Bowden was using in 2021, then you are using their tests to find their ghosts.

01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:05.793
And that does not make their ghosts real, and it certainly doesn't make you a Ghostbuster, Mary.

01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:10.676
And if you don't wake up and figure it out soon, our grandchildren will be enslaved by this bullshit.

01:24:11.096 --> 01:24:16.259
So you are part of a fake anti-vax movement that I too was a part of, and I figured out.

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:21.722
And everybody needs to wake up and apologize to their kids for buying into this fake anti-vax movement.

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:24.063
It's a very simple way to say it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:29.226
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:24:30.006 --> 01:24:31.527
And transfection is a crime.

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:36.029
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:38.591
Go back to that really quick so you can see it.

01:24:39.771 --> 01:24:42.913
And you can see the evidence that this is all a myth.

01:24:42.973 --> 01:24:48.476
This is all a story in order to get you to accept this idea that babies and all of that data

01:24:49.116 --> 01:24:52.777
is something that you owe society, that belongs to society.

01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:57.538
And the NIH is already doing it because Claire Craig was already doing it before the pandemic.

01:24:57.578 --> 01:25:02.899
Because Kevin McKernan was already figuring out ways to get the American public to do it before the pandemic.

01:25:02.939 --> 01:25:07.999
Because Tony Fauci was trying to figure out ways to get the American public to do it before the pandemic.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:16.061
Because Stephen Hadfield and Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Tess Laurie and Claire Craig are all part of the same illusion

01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:20.745
The same narrative, the same team worst case scenario.

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.427
And that's why they were all on stage together.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:27.471
That's why these people deserve nothing but ire.

01:25:27.951 --> 01:25:29.392
They are some of the worst people on earth.

01:25:30.614 --> 01:25:31.234
Thanks for being here.

01:25:31.254 --> 01:25:31.975
I'll see you again tomorrow.
